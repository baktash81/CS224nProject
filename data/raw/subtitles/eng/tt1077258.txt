1
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,504
Real pretty tonight, Holly.

2
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,062
God damn it, girls.

3
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,541
If you're gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!

4
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:10,569
Smokin' hot. Whew!

5
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:17,447
Cherry, darlin',
I told you too many fuckin' times--

6
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:19,455
you can't be up there cryin'
and all that shit.

7
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:21,252
You know what a go-go dance is?

8
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,922
Useless talent number 12?

9
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,985
No, it's a happy dance.

10
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:27,996
You get up there
and you dance happy.

11
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,294
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

12
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,292
I'm quitting.

13
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:34,166
You say that
at least one night a week.

14
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,705
I mean it this time.

15
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:41,176
I need a dramatic change in my life.

16
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:42,609
I've always said you're funny.

17
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,705
Like that Chris Rock...
only prettier.

18
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:47,374
But if you don't stop
all that cryin' and shit,

19
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,748
I'm gonna have to fire
your fuckin' ass,

20
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,719
and I don't want to fire your ass
'cause I like lookin' at your ass.

21
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,778
"Any girl leaving early"

22
00:03:52,856 --> 00:03:54,619
"must check out with their finger"

23
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:56,818
"and have a bye-bye slip."

24
00:03:58,495 --> 00:03:59,860
Here's my finger.

25
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,059
And here's my bye-bye slip.

26
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,470
We're gonna need some cash.

27
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,861
Dick. Fuck!

28
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:33,918
Aah!

29
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,191
Oh!

30
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,707
Ass bag!

31
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,302
Aah!

32
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:07,562
All right, boys. Come on.

33
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,395
All right, all right. Come on.

34
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,907
You guys know the drill, huh?

35
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:23,945
Wait here, Lieutenant.

36
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,506
I'll handle this.

37
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:31,380
Hey, Abby.

38
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:36,817
I can see you've had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

39
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:40,558
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

40
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,598
Well, they--they escaped.

41
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,724
Uh...

42
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,234
All three?

43
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:47,770
Yeah, l--

44
00:05:47,837 --> 00:05:49,236
I don't know, uh--

45
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,035
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--

46
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:53,803
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

47
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:56,735
And you know the rules.

48
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:57,837
Hold on.

49
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:00,712
I'm out.
I swear, Abby, I'm--I'm--

50
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:02,183
You're not gonna
see me anymore, okay?

51
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,651
Not so fast.

52
00:06:09,926 --> 00:06:12,190
I also want your balls.

53
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,464
I'm really quite attached to them.

54
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,268
Oh, sweetheart.

55
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,866
I was really attached to my specimens.

56
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:30,538
Now they're out there in the night
doing God knows what.

57
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,105
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.

58
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:38,047
Hey. Hey! What are you guys--

59
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,679
Let me go, you motherfuckers!

60
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:42,190
Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!

61
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:43,520
You don't need Abby!

62
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:44,560
There's more!

63
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:46,425
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!

64
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:49,056
Fuck!. Motherfucking pussies!

65
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:51,464
Let me go, you son of a bitch!
I can get you more!

66
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,263
No! No! No! Aah!

67
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:55,930
Aaaaah!

68
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,445
Pick this up, please.

69
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:42,374
Where's the shit?

70
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,349
The shit's right there.

71
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:48,050
The deal is still good.

72
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:51,756
No, it's not.

73
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:54,853
You held out on me.

74
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,956
Now I want all of it.

75
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,184
Uhh!

76
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,623
Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

77
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,424
You certainly have.

78
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:28,521
So...

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,865
I'll ask you one more time.

80
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,769
Where's...

81
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,002
the...

82
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,635
shit?

83
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,304
Everywhere.

84
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:25,684
Oh, balls.

85
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:11,156
Get that thing away from my pumps!

86
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,861
It's just overheating.

87
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:16,966
I need to get to town.

88
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:22,240
It's just a stripped radiator cap.

89
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,711
Water leaks when it heats up.

90
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,550
No pressure.

91
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,952
You okay?

92
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,424
I'm just cherry.

93
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,654
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I'll be right in.

94
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,292
Here, take this with you.

95
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:47,063
That's your good spring water.

96
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:49,263
Ain't nothin' good about it.
I bottled it myself.

97
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,068
I get it right there out of the dam.

98
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,042
Thanks...

99
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,600
J.T.

100
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:57,509
We're serving inside tonight.

101
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,571
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.

102
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:00,911
I gotta go.

103
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,077
Savin' lives, are you?

104
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,419
Now, how did you know that?

105
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,628
Now, that's a rump roast.

106
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:19,428
Mmm.

107
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:37,309
Open the shades.

108
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:40,478
Get some light in here.

109
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:47,927
Nice night.

110
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,696
Coffee.

111
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:55,768
Oh, shit.

112
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,365
I couldn't get off work this week.

113
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,040
But you only have to stay till 10:00.

114
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,943
A friend of mine will be here before
10:00 to pick up Tony.

115
00:12:08,017 --> 00:12:10,952
I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

116
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,284
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

117
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:15,153
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

118
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,226
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

119
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,763
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

120
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:33,098
I'll leave him watching TV.

121
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,908
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

122
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,339
Thank you.

123
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,616
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

124
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:48,350
Fell out.

125
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:50,187
Wow.

126
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:52,420
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

127
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:56,522
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

128
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:59,363
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

129
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:00,663
Amen.

130
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,772
Who was that you were talking to?

131
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:07,207
Babysitter.

132
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:09,977
She's on her way.

133
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,012
- You believe her?
- No.

134
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:19,014
Me, neither.

135
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:42,136
Fucking catastrophe.

136
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:14,306
- Hey.
- Hey.

137
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,035
- How's it goin', J.T.?
- All right.

138
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,414
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

139
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:24,042
Cup of coffee
and a pack of cigarettes, please.

140
00:14:26,622 --> 00:14:27,884
Free of charge.

141
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,356
Tonight...

142
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:31,017
is a special night.

143
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,723
What's so special about tonight?

144
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:36,628
Been open 25 years.

145
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,308
You should've thrown a party.

146
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,139
I did. See the balloons?

147
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:52,079
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

148
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,309
Who's the first?

149
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:55,645
Right there.

150
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,251
Must be passin' through.

151
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:05,021
Seems only strangers eat here.

152
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:08,820
I still eat here, J.T.

153
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,559
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

154
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,033
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you're eatin'.

155
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:24,037
Hello, Palomita.

156
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:29,250
I don't go by that name anymore.

157
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:31,781
Why not?

158
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:35,923
'Cause it's the name you gave me.

159
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,461
So, uh...

160
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:44,523
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?

161
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:48,130
Never did.

162
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,437
I thought for sure you would.

163
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:55,471
Talked about it enough.

164
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:56,773
That's the problem with goals--

165
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,906
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

166
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:02,075
That's my jacket.

167
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,550
I looked for it for two weeks.

168
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:07,213
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

169
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,053
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

170
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,258
So, um...

171
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,762
what are you doing now?

172
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,427
I'm going to be a standup comedian.

173
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,596
Really?

174
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:27,404
You're not funny.

175
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:30,969
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody,

176
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:33,345
but they all say I'm hysterical.

177
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:36,109
But you're not.

178
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:37,652
Great. Well, that's just fantastic,

179
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,655
because I believed everybody,
and I've already booked shows in town.

180
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,054
Now what am I gonna do?

181
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:45,321
Yeah. Yeah, that--
that sucks, really.

182
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:49,520
There's a difference
between being frank

183
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:51,999
and being dick.

184
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:54,332
Yeah, well...

185
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:56,371
it was really good seeing you again.

186
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,200
Oh. Um...

187
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:01,209
what name do you go by now...

188
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:03,108
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

189
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,737
Cherry.

190
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:07,574
Cherry Darling.

191
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,277
Sxounds like a stripper.

192
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:13,754
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

193
00:17:13,823 --> 00:17:15,222
There's a difference.

194
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,690
Right.

195
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:18,851
Well...

196
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,923
you'll always be Palomita to me.

197
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:37,303
I need a ride.

198
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,878
What do you say, El Wray?

199
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:48,216
I'll give you a ride.

200
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:57,730
Good-bye, Bill.

201
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,064
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

202
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,902
Hey. What's up, Doc?

203
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,076
The little lady's lookin'
pretty good there, I gotta say.

204
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,772
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

205
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:11,938
I'm kiddin'. Heh.

206
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:15,674
- Take a look at that shit.
- What happened to your arm?

207
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:18,015
Well, uh... I got bit.

208
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:20,385
Bit? Bit by what?

209
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:22,788
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

210
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,750
I need some Bactine or something?

211
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:27,953
Whew.

212
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:31,291
Can't you just...sew it up?

213
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,062
Well, normally I would.

214
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,933
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

215
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:38,166
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

216
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,037
Oh, shit. Check this out.

217
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:42,270
When this was still a military hospital,

218
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,370
this one guy came back
from lraq with this.

219
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:45,471
Whew!

220
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:47,709
Chronic herpetic lesions.

221
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:50,343
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

222
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:51,579
kind of like a fountain.

223
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:53,144
Oh, Jesus.

224
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:54,746
Well, how'd you treat it?

225
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:58,954
Fuck that. I was never in lraq.

226
00:18:59,028 --> 00:19:01,155
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

227
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,130
I swear to God.
I've got these lraqi eyeballs

228
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,167
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

229
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,361
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

230
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:08,960
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.

231
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:10,437
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

232
00:19:11,574 --> 00:19:13,337
Bot fly, do you think?

233
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:16,742
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

234
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,473
That looks like gout.

235
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:22,412
He's running a temperature of 105.

236
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:24,112
- Is that bad?
- It's high.

237
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,483
Bad will be 108.

238
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:29,149
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

239
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:31,455
And--and probably die.

240
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:33,419
Say "ahh."

241
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,930
- Alhh.
- Oh! Jesus!

242
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:37,829
Oh, nice.

243
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,265
Black abscessed tongue.

244
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:41,826
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

245
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:49,869
What are you doing?

246
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:52,138
Shut up, Joe.

247
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:06,220
Baby...get the needles.

248
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:09,692
Be right there.

249
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:13,031
Right now.

250
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:13,966
Asshole.

251
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:30,181
It's spreading.

252
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:32,313
Holy shit.

253
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:34,515
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

254
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,057
See this?

255
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,526
This shows the advanced stages
of gangrene and epidermal rot.

256
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,256
- And this over here...
- Advanced rot?

257
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,925
...shows the swelling of tissues
and the lack of any type of circulation.

258
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,468
See, you're telling me
that you just got this bite?

259
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:50,004
- Yeah, just like a half hour ago.
- What I'm seeing here

260
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:52,370
is a deep impact wound
with several virals

261
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,102
and secondary bacterials,

262
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:57,236
and that, by the accumulation of
denuded tissue around the incision marks,

263
00:20:57,313 --> 00:21:01,682
indicates that you've had this bite
for over 14 days.

264
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,411
Uh... uh, at least 14 days.

265
00:21:03,486 --> 00:21:04,714
Could that be possible?

266
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,347
14 days? No way. I mean--

267
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,584
Well...what is today?

268
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,890
Today's Wednesday.

269
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:14,088
The 15th.

270
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:16,655
Of April.

271
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,326
Aw, hell. Can't I just get
a tetanus shot or something?

272
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:22,399
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

273
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,200
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

274
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:25,797
It's sppreading all the way
upp to your shoulder.

275
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,605
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

276
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:30,770
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

277
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:32,370
Well, shouldn't I get a second oppinion?

278
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,344
Hi, Joe.

279
00:21:36,151 --> 00:21:38,642
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

280
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:40,985
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

281
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:42,148
These...

282
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:44,457
...are my friends.

283
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:45,653
My yellow friend...

284
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:49,963
- ...is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

285
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:52,963
My blue friend...

286
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:54,525
you'll barely feel.

287
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:58,733
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

288
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,297
See how fast my friends work?

289
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:05,278
And after my red-headed friend...

290
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:07,440
... you'll never see me again.

291
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:09,507
...see me again, see me again.

292
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:17,623
They all react differently.

293
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:24,022
Now what?

294
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,090
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia--

295
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:27,760
in loving memoy

296
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:42,211
It's not the radiator.

297
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:45,046
Damn it.

298
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:05,933
All right.

299
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:07,373
Fuckin' thing.

300
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:09,206
Cheapp--whoa.

301
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,573
Damn light.

302
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:14,542
Ohh.

303
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:25,657
Hey. Hey!

304
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:27,559
Hey! Bastard!

305
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,029
Bastard!

306
00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:40,098
Oh, thank God.

307
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:41,233
Oh.

308
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:43,137
Oh. Hey!

309
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:44,702
Hey! Hey!

310
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:48,006
Get outta
the fuckin' road, bitch!

311
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:02,395
Ohh! Stop!

312
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:03,590
Stop!

313
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,463
Please! Stop!

314
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:10,865
No! No!

315
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:28,018
What the hell was that?

316
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,317
People picking up road kill.

317
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:33,952
What, like an armadillo?

318
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:36,194
Deer.

319
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,796
You get a lot of them around here.

320
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:42,367
You know, I read a statistic that said...

321
00:24:42,438 --> 00:24:47,933
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

322
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,240
60% of that's from road kill.

323
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,248
People eat road kill?

324
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,283
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

325
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,079
and a deer darts out
in front of you,

326
00:24:57,152 --> 00:25:00,280
if you blink or brake or swerve--

327
00:25:00,355 --> 00:25:02,084
shit, you'll just kill yourself.

328
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,647
So, what do you do?

329
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:05,318
Just ppick 'em off...

330
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:06,861
just like this.

331
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,419
Send it flying away from you.

332
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:09,987
Unacceptable.

333
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,589
Not really.

334
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,595
It's just a clear case of you or him.

335
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:18,105
Or her.

336
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:19,771
Oh, fuck!

337
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,339
Aah! Aah!

338
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:37,716
Cherry?

339
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:43,061
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

340
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:44,531
It wasn't a deer.

341
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:49,632
Cherry! Cherry! No!

342
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,250
Aah!

343
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,264
Palomita.

344
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:29,468
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

345
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:31,911
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

346
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,675
possible spinal trauma...

347
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:36,341
one severed limb.

348
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,180
Where's the leg?

349
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:41,085
Three sickos attacked her.

350
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,953
I shot at them.

351
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,188
I never miss.

352
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,857
They took the leg with them.

353
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:06,072
You'll have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

354
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:07,513
He has to sign her in.

355
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,743
Do what, now?.

356
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:10,717
Well, he's with her.
He's respponsible for her.

357
00:27:10,786 --> 00:27:13,755
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

358
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:17,218
Okay.

359
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,623
Okay! Fuck!

360
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,051
Hey, Block.

361
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:28,433
No, you do it.

362
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:32,400
Suit yourself.

363
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,305
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

364
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:37,838
Nothing.

365
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:40,575
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

366
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:42,139
Come on, Wray.

367
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,742
You know you're not supppposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

368
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,754
Not even hunting?

369
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:49,188
Not even hunting.
And you know that.

370
00:27:49,258 --> 00:27:50,850
Not with your history.

371
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:54,054
And here I stick my neck out for you.

372
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,359
I stick it out far.

373
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:59,161
Now you've got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

374
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:02,129
A missing leg that's now missing?

375
00:28:02,204 --> 00:28:04,297
And here you're saying
in front of everybody

376
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:06,204
that someone up and snatched it?

377
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:07,674
And that you shot at 'em with a gun

378
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,836
that you never should've had
in the first pplace?

379
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,174
And that now they're gone?

380
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,114
What if I find the leg?

381
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:16,446
So, now you know where it is?

382
00:28:16,518 --> 00:28:19,510
You'll tell us where it is,
give us a full confession, you're saying?

383
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:21,715
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

384
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,950
My thought exactly.

385
00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:30,556
I know it sounds a little arrogant
puttin' upp a sign--

386
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,123
"Best damn barbecue in Texas..."

387
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,032
"Period."

388
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:38,266
But, hell...

389
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,501
who's gonna come in here
and argue about that?

390
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:45,576
Oh, yeah.
Big contest comin' up.

391
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:47,540
Mm.

392
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:51,181
I'm workin' on the perfect sauce.

393
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:53,247
Yeah.

394
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:55,987
That'll put me on the Food Channel.

395
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,050
Put this pplace back on the mapp
where it belongs.

396
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:01,425
I'll talk to you later.

397
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:16,373
Can I interest y'all in a plate of
soon-to-be-award-winnin' barbecue?

398
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,282
You're from Dinky's, ain't ya?

399
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:27,550
Well, you tell that sumbitch,

400
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:30,216
he thinks he's gonna come over here
and get my recippes...

401
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:34,525
well, I got a double-barreled answer
to his query right inside.

402
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,664
God damn, that's good.

403
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,530
Doctor Block!

404
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:49,441
Three fresh ones rollin' in!

405
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:50,637
Christ, you're kidding.

406
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:52,942
Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.

407
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,414
DOAs?

408
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:55,882
Have Andy pick 'em up.

409
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:58,647
He's already on 620
picking up another two.

410
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:01,316
Fucking Wednesday nights.

411
00:30:03,058 --> 00:30:04,992
That's unsanitary, Doc.

412
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,994
Not if I'm the only one using it.

413
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:09,360
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.

414
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:11,899
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

415
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:12,956
Fuck.

416
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:15,094
You might cut yourself pretty good.

417
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:17,263
Then I'd know I was not calm.

418
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:26,144
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

419
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,607
Somebody call my wife.

420
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,800
DC-2?

421
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:52,132
Mm.

422
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:54,833
Yeah.

423
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:59,245
Well, what about
countering with atroppine?

424
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:03,309
Yeah.

425
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:08,288
Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.

426
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:12,783
Well, boys, I'm beat.

427
00:31:12,861 --> 00:31:15,625
I gotta get home.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

428
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:18,029
All right, then.
Thanks for the extra help, Earl.

429
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,761
Hey, Wray.

430
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:21,462
You in trouble again?

431
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,629
Just passin' through, I hope.

432
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:24,831
Well, me, too.

433
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,066
How's the wife, Earl?

434
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,541
Well, she's not too good.

435
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:31,704
Thanks for askin'.

436
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:35,341
Most of it's her own doin', you know.

437
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:37,510
Smokin' them goddamn cigarettes.

438
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:39,213
Pack a day for 40 years.

439
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:43,722
Yeah, she doesn't want anything
to do with, uh...chemo.

440
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:47,751
So...it does take its toll.

441
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:49,922
You don't smoke, do you, Wray?

442
00:31:50,866 --> 00:31:51,924
No.

443
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:55,531
That's probably good.

444
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:58,970
See y'all.

445
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,143
You're gonna start by telling me

446
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:04,906
when you first started
carrying this gun.

447
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:08,244
And then we'll move up

448
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:10,750
to when you first set eyes
on this gal Cherry.

449
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:56,895
Okay.

450
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:58,894
Okay.

451
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,304
Sheriff Hague.

452
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:12,175
It's J.t, Sheriff.

453
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:14,306
J.T., how's the barbecue business?

454
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:18,810
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

455
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,946
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

456
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:22,421
I wish there was something
I could do.

457
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:25,857
Right now I ain't callin' my brother.
I'm callin' the sheriff.

458
00:33:25,927 --> 00:33:28,293
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

459
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:30,661
Well. there ain't no trouble.
Not yet. anyway.

460
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:33,394
I got two delinquents been hangin'
around here for over an hour.

461
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:35,595
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

462
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,034
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

463
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:42,543
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

464
00:33:42,611 --> 00:33:45,307
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

465
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,213
You give me that recipe, or I'll raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

466
00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:50,751
Brother. ain't no Texan's ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.

467
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:52,980
That's a fact.
He'll take it to his grave.

468
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:55,488
I could be bleedin' like a stuck pig.
I ain't gonna tell you.

469
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:58,185
I could be dyin' in your arms.
I ain't gonna tell you!

470
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,989
- Heh heh heh.
- We'll see about that.

471
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:05,223
You gonna look.

472
00:34:06,868 --> 00:34:08,335
or you gonna eat?

473
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,309
You called for me?

474
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,211
I need for you to see this.

475
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:24,108
Looks like a no-brainer.

476
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:25,584
What does that mean?

477
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:27,246
No brain.

478
00:34:27,322 --> 00:34:30,018
Scoopped clean out of her skull.

479
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:31,820
Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.

480
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:34,418
Don't tell me.
Uh... Iiquefactive necrosis.

481
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,824
You think?

482
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:38,058
Oh, sure, yeah.

483
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:39,725
Thank you. That'll be all.

484
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:49,574
Oh...

485
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:55,876
Did you know she was back in town?

486
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:58,979
No.

487
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,619
I didn't.

488
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,724
What happened to her?

489
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:11,792
I don't know, baby.

490
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:19,197
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

491
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:23,442
We have.

492
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:27,248
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.

493
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:31,318
I mean, we--
we stopped before.

494
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:37,351
I--

495
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:39,620
I haven't talked to her in a while.

496
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,762
But you've written each other.

497
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:51,834
Here and there.

498
00:35:51,906 --> 00:35:53,669
But not--

499
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:55,266
What are you doing?!

500
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:58,645
Let me see your last three messages.

501
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,448
- You have no right.
- I don't?

502
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:06,483
I don't have a right?

503
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,114
Show it to me.

504
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,951
Show it to me.

505
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:14,187
No.

506
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:16,494
Aah!

507
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:18,930
Now, that's just to take the sting off.

508
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:23,961
Show it to me.

509
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:26,029
No, please.

510
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:28,974
- Show... it...to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

511
00:36:33,214 --> 00:36:35,774
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

512
00:36:47,095 --> 00:36:48,460
That's pretty fast.

513
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,301
Oh, what do I know, my love?

514
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,031
Exactly.

515
00:36:57,105 --> 00:37:00,836
That you're a cheating, lying...

516
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,842
sack.

517
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:07,143
I didn't want to hurt you.

518
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:09,775
But you did.

519
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:11,216
Bill...

520
00:37:11,286 --> 00:37:13,345
you're insane.

521
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:18,118
And I was afraid...

522
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:21,491
of what you might do to me,

523
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:23,394
to our son.

524
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:26,730
I'm the mother of your son.

525
00:37:27,268 --> 00:37:28,257
Aah!

526
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,074
And after this one...

527
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,671
I'll never see you again.

528
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,225
Doc.

529
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:54,921
What?

530
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:57,624
You gotta see this.

531
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:59,291
I'll be right there.

532
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:12,070
Where the hell are the bodies?

533
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:14,080
That's what we wanted to show you.

534
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:15,206
They're gone.

535
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,581
They didn't just get upp
and walk out, did they?

536
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,211
Mmm-hmm

537
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:26,783
Shut the fuck up!

538
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:30,530
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

539
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:31,587
What the hell's going on?

540
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,328
Alh, he was causin' a ruckus
over at Skipp's place, so I cuffed him,

541
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:38,099
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off.

542
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:40,766
Quit your hollerin' and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

543
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:43,333
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

544
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:45,641
He bit my finger clean off!

545
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:47,510
Fucking shit!

546
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,277
Get out there and book him,

547
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,318
'cause I'll fuckin' kill him
if I have to do it.

548
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:52,944
Carlos, go get him.

549
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:56,889
Wray, you stay put.

550
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:20,142
Are you sure he's in there?

551
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:22,711
He was.

552
00:39:22,784 --> 00:39:24,274
Motherfucker.

553
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,080
He's gone.

554
00:39:59,988 --> 00:40:01,353
Broke out the window.

555
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:03,390
Where's my finger?

556
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,982
Found your ring.

557
00:40:05,059 --> 00:40:07,721
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

558
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:10,689
I didn't get
a good look at mine.

559
00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:16,426
That him over there?

560
00:41:04,452 --> 00:41:05,419
Whoa! Whoa!

561
00:41:05,486 --> 00:41:06,817
Aah!

562
00:41:09,657 --> 00:41:11,454
Wray?

563
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:24,598
Fuck.

564
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,736
You motherfucker!

565
00:41:30,812 --> 00:41:32,040
Uhh!

566
00:42:02,376 --> 00:42:04,810
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

567
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:06,107
He's infected.

568
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,579
With what?

569
00:42:07,648 --> 00:42:08,842
Everything.

570
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,646
Wray!
Dropp the fuckin' gun.

571
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,317
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?!

572
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:22,385
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

573
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:25,159
Fine. But we're taking my car.

574
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:32,105
I'm riding with you.

575
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,100
Don't make any sudden moves.

576
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:50,413
Viral infections.

577
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,657
They came pouring in.

578
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:56,663
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

579
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:58,756
Highly contagious.

580
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,596
What do you think?

581
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:04,196
Self-preservation comes to mind.

582
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:06,763
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

583
00:43:08,075 --> 00:43:10,407
First let me get my wife.

584
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:19,604
I love you, sweetie.

585
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,204
There you go, bunny rabbit.

586
00:44:21,282 --> 00:44:22,806
Come on, come on.

587
00:44:22,884 --> 00:44:24,545
Open up, now.

588
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:26,780
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

589
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:29,414
We don't want you checkin' out
right this--

590
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:32,220
God...damn.

591
00:44:33,127 --> 00:44:34,219
Ramona.

592
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:38,695
You been fartin' like a goddamn
pack mule since I met--

593
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:39,755
God damn!

594
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:41,461
I hate to do this to you Earl.

595
00:44:41,535 --> 00:44:44,003
but we need evey man on the job!

596
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:45,663
The shit has hit the fan!

597
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,834
Bring some guns...and ammo!

598
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,775
Meet me at my brother's!

599
00:44:50,845 --> 00:44:52,312
I gotcha. I'll be there.

600
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:55,815
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

601
00:44:55,883 --> 00:44:57,009
Come on.

602
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:00,615
Ramona.

603
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,182
Ramona.

604
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:08,550
Aah!

605
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:42,121
Uhh!

606
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:45,654
Aaaah!

607
00:45:45,733 --> 00:45:47,360
Oh, my God.

608
00:46:44,058 --> 00:46:45,719
What the hell is goin' on?

609
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,061
Are you gonna give me a gun?

610
00:46:51,132 --> 00:46:52,895
Are you fucking kidding me?

611
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:15,485
Fuck.

612
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:20,157
Oh! Fuck me!

613
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:21,626
God damn it!

614
00:47:21,695 --> 00:47:24,425
Let's sort this shit out, boys!

615
00:47:28,402 --> 00:47:29,835
Dumbass.

616
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:31,927
Yeah.

617
00:47:32,073 --> 00:47:34,473
Not today! Not today!

618
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,840
Fucking Wednesday nights!

619
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:40,406
Aaah!

620
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:14,841
Uhh!

621
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:37,534
Palomita?

622
00:48:41,342 --> 00:48:43,207
Get up. We're leaving.

623
00:48:43,277 --> 00:48:44,710
I can't walk.

624
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:46,905
So what? Get up!

625
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:48,073
- Get--
- Aah!

626
00:48:48,149 --> 00:48:49,241
Uhh!

627
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,109
Motherfucker.

628
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:53,813
Look at me!

629
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:55,082
Look at me!

630
00:48:56,457 --> 00:48:58,857
I was gonna be a standup comedian.

631
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:00,553
But who's gonna laugh now?

632
00:49:00,628 --> 00:49:02,493
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.

633
00:49:02,563 --> 00:49:03,655
Let's go.

634
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:05,358
It's not funny. It's ppathetic.

635
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:06,899
Would you stop cryin' over fuckin'...

636
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:08,127
spilled milk?

637
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,363
I have no leg!

638
00:49:19,446 --> 00:49:21,812
Now you do.
What do you think?

639
00:49:26,387 --> 00:49:28,685
You could carry me, Wray.

640
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:30,986
Yeah? You never wanted that before.

641
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:32,987
Why start now?

642
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:37,519
Alh-ah!

643
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,128
Uhh!

644
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:42,294
Alhh!

645
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:43,427
Uhh!

646
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:48,199
This is fucking ridiculous.

647
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:55,438
The sheriff must've
taken the others to J.T's.

648
00:49:55,516 --> 00:49:56,608
Get in.

649
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:05,082
God damn it, wait for me.

650
00:50:15,903 --> 00:50:18,463
My leg's stuck in the door!

651
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:20,473
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.

652
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:22,304
Will you just leave it alone?

653
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:23,809
Why is this happening to me?

654
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:26,778
I don't know. Just--
just do me a favor right now and just...

655
00:50:26,847 --> 00:50:28,644
stay strong.

656
00:50:29,984 --> 00:50:31,417
"Stay"?

657
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:34,954
Yeah, baby. Stay.

658
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,748
Okay, my name is Electra.

659
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:40,020
Fucking listen.

660
00:50:40,094 --> 00:50:41,721
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.

661
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:45,892
It's furry.

662
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:48,865
No.

663
00:50:48,936 --> 00:50:50,631
He's a furry one.

664
00:50:50,704 --> 00:50:53,138
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".

665
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:55,300
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?

666
00:50:57,511 --> 00:50:59,979
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want--I don't give a shit.

667
00:51:08,689 --> 00:51:10,156
Oye. chica.

668
00:51:10,224 --> 00:51:11,919
- You said 10:00!
- I'm sorry.

669
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:14,153
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!

670
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:16,719
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

671
00:51:16,797 --> 00:51:18,321
That's right.

672
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,367
Then start doing it.

673
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,097
Oh!

674
00:51:24,138 --> 00:51:25,833
Uhh!

675
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:29,407
Tony! We're leaving!

676
00:51:30,944 --> 00:51:32,639
Wait, my tarantula.

677
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:34,578
Bring it. Let's go.

678
00:51:34,648 --> 00:51:36,013
And my turtle.

679
00:51:36,784 --> 00:51:37,808
And my scorppion.

680
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:41,184
We're not all octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

681
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,688
"Octopi."

682
00:51:42,756 --> 00:51:45,691
Ohh...come on, let's go.

683
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:53,426
Tony, what did I tell you?

684
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,230
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

685
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:58,771
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.

686
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:01,399
What about my pocket bike?

687
00:52:01,475 --> 00:52:02,772
It's in the trunk.

688
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:04,242
Aah!

689
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:06,609
Where do you think you're going,
you fucking bitch?!

690
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:10,840
We're gonna fuckin' kill you!

691
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,760
Are you sure you want to do this?

692
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,900
Everybody grab a badge and a gun.

693
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:37,375
You're all deputies
as of this moment foitward.

694
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:39,036
Except for you, Wray.

695
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:48,881
Yo.

696
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,321
What do we got?

697
00:52:51,392 --> 00:52:53,155
Something's wrong up there.

698
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:56,361
J.T. always comes out and greets.

699
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,522
Let's go.

700
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,734
Try not to shoot yourselves.

701
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:04,731
Don't shoot each other.

702
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:07,304
But especially...

703
00:53:09,877 --> 00:53:11,242
don't shoot me.

704
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:19,818
J.T.?

705
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:29,392
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!

706
00:53:34,635 --> 00:53:36,398
God damn, J.T.

707
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:38,894
Yah!

708
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:50,310
Barbecue?

709
00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:52,716
Asshole.

710
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:57,155
Damn good sausage link, J.T.

711
00:53:57,224 --> 00:53:58,953
Best in Texas.

712
00:53:59,026 --> 00:54:01,187
Must've passed out
after I killed those things.

713
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,254
Nice shootin'.

714
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:06,629
Everybody gather up supplies.

715
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,258
We head out in 20!

716
00:54:12,406 --> 00:54:13,464
I think I nailed it.

717
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,599
Holy shit, I think I finally cracked it.

718
00:54:15,676 --> 00:54:19,009
I finally found my--
my award-winning barbecue sauce!

719
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,080
Your blood's in it.

720
00:54:26,286 --> 00:54:28,186
God damn it, he's right.

721
00:54:45,906 --> 00:54:47,635
Hey, my other tooth fell out.

722
00:54:49,176 --> 00:54:50,473
Heh.

723
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,603
It sure did.

724
00:54:54,448 --> 00:54:56,643
Hey, your tooth fell out, too.

725
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,584
We're toothless buddies.

726
00:55:02,656 --> 00:55:05,090
Oh, we sure are.

727
00:55:12,633 --> 00:55:15,067
I want you to open that for Mommy.

728
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:20,698
Now, take the gun.

729
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:23,740
Careful.

730
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:27,644
And if anyone comes to the door
that isn't me,

731
00:55:27,714 --> 00:55:29,739
I want you to shoot them, okay?

732
00:55:29,816 --> 00:55:31,841
I'm not kidding, Tony.

733
00:55:31,919 --> 00:55:33,580
You shoot them...

734
00:55:33,654 --> 00:55:35,679
just like your video games.

735
00:55:35,756 --> 00:55:38,691
You shoot them in the head.

736
00:55:38,759 --> 00:55:40,624
What if it's Dad?

737
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:43,720
Especially if it's your dad.

738
00:55:56,009 --> 00:55:58,409
And be careful
where you point that thing.

739
00:55:58,478 --> 00:55:59,843
You'll blow your own face off.

740
00:55:59,913 --> 00:56:01,710
I'll be right back.

741
00:56:01,815 --> 00:56:04,511
I love you.

742
00:56:25,305 --> 00:56:26,294
Tony!

743
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:30,067
Aah!

744
00:56:30,177 --> 00:56:31,474
Hello, baby.

745
00:56:35,182 --> 00:56:36,308
Ohh!

746
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:49,828
I'm gonna eat your brains...

747
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:53,228
and gain your knowledge.

748
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,096
Stay away!

749
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:01,805
Look what you did to our son!

750
00:57:09,316 --> 00:57:10,578
Stay away!

751
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,050
God damn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

752
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:21,094
Daddy!

753
00:57:23,797 --> 00:57:25,424
Get your sorry ass in here!

754
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:26,488
Aah!

755
00:57:29,002 --> 00:57:32,096
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.

756
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:33,469
Right this way.

757
00:57:34,374 --> 00:57:35,636
Watch that meat.

758
00:57:35,742 --> 00:57:37,107
Meet my wife.

759
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:40,936
Jesse James Custom Dominator.

760
00:57:41,014 --> 00:57:43,414
I made Jesse a pplate of barbecue
so goddamn good,

761
00:57:43,483 --> 00:57:45,917
he made this baby for me
free of fuckin' charge. Heh heh heh.

762
00:57:45,986 --> 00:57:48,011
Got anything that could
transpport more peopple?

763
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,780
Where's the top?

764
00:57:51,858 --> 00:57:54,088
This baby's chopped permanent.

765
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:56,186
Ain't got no roll bar, chicken wire,
none of that shit.

766
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:58,196
- No protection.
- But she's fast.

767
00:57:58,265 --> 00:58:01,234
Nitrous-injected,
350-horsepower engine.

768
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:03,132
Who are you?

769
00:58:03,203 --> 00:58:04,261
I mean, really.

770
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:06,566
Wray's Wreckage.

771
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,631
That's what it says on your truck.

772
00:58:13,647 --> 00:58:15,672
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

773
00:58:15,782 --> 00:58:17,579
I'm nobody.

774
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:20,983
It's the easiest thing to remember.

775
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:23,351
So remember it.

776
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:28,786
Just stack 'em
on top of the counter.

777
00:58:31,098 --> 00:58:32,725
Hey, you want some barbecue?

778
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,926
Heh heh heh. Best in Texas.

779
00:58:35,001 --> 00:58:36,525
Aw, no, thanks.

780
00:58:36,603 --> 00:58:38,195
What's the matter,
you don't eat meat?

781
00:58:38,271 --> 00:58:39,932
Oh, I eat meat.

782
00:58:40,006 --> 00:58:42,440
I also eat lots of shit.

783
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:44,306
You see this?

784
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:45,571
What's that?

785
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:46,942
Shit-eating grin.

786
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:50,476
You ought to be a comedian.

787
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,949
What do you think of the leg?

788
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:54,248
Oh, that's funny.

789
00:58:55,822 --> 00:58:57,346
How's your stump?

790
00:58:57,424 --> 00:58:59,289
They knocked it out something fierce.

791
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,519
Still can't feel a thing.

792
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:04,827
This must be the real Bone Shack.

793
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,228
Old J.T. knows how to live.

794
00:59:09,302 --> 00:59:11,702
Like fuck he does.

795
00:59:14,608 --> 00:59:16,473
I like how you say "fuck".

796
00:59:16,543 --> 00:59:18,602
Good. Fuck you.

797
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:20,876
Fuck me?

798
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:27,246
Oh, so, now you're the comedian.

799
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,550
Go ahead, drop your pants.

800
00:59:29,623 --> 00:59:31,784
That'll be good for a laugh.

801
00:59:31,892 --> 00:59:34,258
I highly doubt that.

802
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:42,392
That's my jacket.

803
00:59:42,469 --> 00:59:44,403
Yes, I know.

804
00:59:44,471 --> 00:59:46,439
I looked for it for two weeks.

805
00:59:47,374 --> 00:59:51,333
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick::.

806
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:53,641
I was walking out on you.

807
00:59:53,713 --> 00:59:57,046
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

808
00:59:57,117 --> 01:00:00,814
So, if you're gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

809
01:00:00,887 --> 01:00:02,821
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

810
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:06,120
'cause I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

811
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,124
Did you find what was in the pock:et?

812
01:00:10,197 --> 01:00:11,858
Fuck no.

813
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:13,297
Look for it.

814
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,035
No, the other one.

815
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:30,213
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

816
01:00:31,852 --> 01:00:33,410
You took the jacket.

817
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:37,853
And I looked for it for two weeks.

818
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,217
Read it.

819
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:49,865
"Two against the world."

820
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:53,970
Remember that?

821
01:00:55,642 --> 01:00:57,200
I never forgot it.

822
01:00:58,144 --> 01:01:00,635
Then why'd you leave?

823
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:04,145
Because you didn't believe in us,

824
01:01:04,217 --> 01:01:05,616
or in me.

825
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,335
I figured one of them new deputies
might end up shootin' me,

826
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:32,030
but not you, Tolo!

827
01:02:32,105 --> 01:02:33,595
Sorry. I'm sorry.

828
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,572
- Dumbass.
- You're gonna be all right.

829
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:37,132
- McGraw's here.
-  Now, now, now.

830
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,337
- And a whole bunch of others.
- Everybody in!

831
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:40,401
Come on!

832
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,970
Over here.

833
01:02:42,082 --> 01:02:43,674
Move your ass! Come on!

834
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:03,766
What did I tell you, Tony?

835
01:03:04,804 --> 01:03:07,204
Don't point the gun at yourself.

836
01:03:08,008 --> 01:03:09,976
Didn't I tell you that?

837
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,606
Thank you for telling me about...

838
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,738
you know.

839
01:03:14,814 --> 01:03:16,679
Don't mention it.

840
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,581
That's an order.

841
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:20,346
If I had known that you were...

842
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:24,848
El Wray...

843
01:03:24,924 --> 01:03:27,188
I wouldn't have given you
such a hard time.

844
01:03:27,293 --> 01:03:29,887
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.

845
01:03:29,963 --> 01:03:32,454
Need-to-know basis, that kind of shit.

846
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:33,863
Take this.

847
01:03:36,136 --> 01:03:37,694
Do what you do best.

848
01:03:39,973 --> 01:03:41,873
No, you're not!

849
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:43,340
Don't give him the gun. Not--

850
01:03:43,443 --> 01:03:44,933
Give him the gun, Tolo.

851
01:03:47,013 --> 01:03:48,605
Give him the gun.

852
01:03:49,749 --> 01:03:51,341
Give him all the guns.

853
01:04:04,631 --> 01:04:06,565
Holy shit.

854
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:11,027
That boy's got the devil in him.

855
01:04:14,307 --> 01:04:15,331
We gotta fight them off.

856
01:04:16,276 --> 01:04:17,743
Get to our vehicles.

857
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:20,805
Everyone behind me!

858
01:04:32,158 --> 01:04:33,648
Outside now!

859
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:53,805
God damn you!

860
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:06,125
Everybody back inside!

861
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:16,726
You, Skip.

862
01:05:16,803 --> 01:05:17,770
Front and center.

863
01:05:17,837 --> 01:05:21,568
You go out front,
start up the Kill Dozer.

864
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:23,768
We'll need it to transport
the other survivors.

865
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:26,277
You fuckin' crazy?
I'm not goin' out there.

866
01:05:26,379 --> 01:05:28,779
- I'll cover you.
- I'm not goin'.

867
01:05:28,848 --> 01:05:30,281
I never miss.

868
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,318
Come on, Skipp.

869
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:34,250
It's go-go.

870
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,220
Not cry-cry.

871
01:05:36,289 --> 01:05:38,314
Cherry!

872
01:05:48,568 --> 01:05:50,126
Oh, dear.

873
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:59,205
Alh!

874
01:06:15,795 --> 01:06:16,784
Aah!

875
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:38,843
J.T.!

876
01:06:38,918 --> 01:06:40,715
You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible.

877
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,878
Everyone else on board!

878
01:06:41,955 --> 01:06:43,547
Skipp, grab the ttwins!
Come along with me!

879
01:06:43,656 --> 01:06:45,886
You take the chopper.

880
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:47,586
I need someone else
to drive my truck!

881
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:48,991
I'll do it.

882
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,057
You're bleedin' like a stuck pig.

883
01:06:53,132 --> 01:06:55,225
Your vision's blurred
and you're on your last legs.

884
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:56,598
Anything else?

885
01:06:56,669 --> 01:06:58,193
Don't wreck it.

886
01:06:59,672 --> 01:07:01,105
Somebody grab the slaw!

887
01:07:01,174 --> 01:07:03,039
You can't have no barbecue
without coleslaw!

888
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:04,667
- Give me a gun.
- Take this.

889
01:07:05,678 --> 01:07:06,906
Fucking cool!

890
01:07:08,881 --> 01:07:10,940
All right, y'all, head out.
I'll hold 'em off.

891
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:14,945
I can take care of myself.

892
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:17,215
Bye, Daddy.

893
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:20,482
Do you remember how to ride a bike?

894
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,323
Useless talent number 32.

895
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:24,654
Good.

896
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:26,460
Anyone else have a car?

897
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:33,402
Now, you're sure you're okay
driving this thing?

898
01:07:33,473 --> 01:07:34,804
Hell yeah.

899
01:07:37,844 --> 01:07:40,404
Dakota...
we're sorry about Tony.

900
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:42,306
Thanks.

901
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:45,907
Your engine is shot
and you've got three blown tires.

902
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:47,976
But I've got his ppocket bike
in the trunk.

903
01:07:49,822 --> 01:07:51,221
Is it fast?

904
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,282
Zero to fifty in four seconds.

905
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:55,293
You ride with her.

906
01:07:56,396 --> 01:07:58,057
I'm Cherry.

907
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:59,655
You sure are.

908
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,461
Move out!

909
01:08:02,568 --> 01:08:04,559
Damn shame.

910
01:08:38,004 --> 01:08:39,494
Rusty!

911
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:41,436
Aah!

912
01:08:41,507 --> 01:08:42,940
God damn it!

913
01:08:43,009 --> 01:08:43,998
Aah!

914
01:09:20,413 --> 01:09:23,246
Sheriff! How much ammo we got?

915
01:09:25,218 --> 01:09:26,651
Not enough.

916
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:41,931
Don't shoot!
We're not infected!

917
01:09:50,977 --> 01:09:53,639
All survivors gotta come with us.

918
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,341
Especially you...

919
01:09:57,617 --> 01:09:59,346
El Wray.

920
01:09:59,419 --> 01:10:01,853
I don't go by that name anymore.

921
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:18,365
It's okay. It's okay.

922
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:22,634
We're here in quarantine
with the other survivors.

923
01:10:32,919 --> 01:10:34,181
Where is here?

924
01:10:35,388 --> 01:10:37,083
The old army base.

925
01:10:38,024 --> 01:10:39,924
El Wray?

926
01:10:41,594 --> 01:10:42,891
That you?

927
01:10:43,896 --> 01:10:46,888
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.

928
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:48,729
I'm a scientist...

929
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:51,235
and a businessman.
Not military.

930
01:10:51,304 --> 01:10:55,001
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

931
01:10:56,609 --> 01:10:58,804
They're stealing biochemical weapons.

932
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:00,173
DC-2?

933
01:11:00,246 --> 01:11:02,612
Also known as "Project Terror."

934
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:06,715
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.

935
01:11:06,786 --> 01:11:08,754
You were supplying it to them.

936
01:11:10,022 --> 01:11:13,082
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.

937
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:15,127
It's under our feet.

938
01:11:15,228 --> 01:11:17,128
Ten stories down.

939
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,630
What about countering
with atropine and PAM-2?

940
01:11:19,699 --> 01:11:23,567
Interferes with the neurotoxic delivery,
sets off the cell-blaster,

941
01:11:23,636 --> 01:11:27,094
and you're gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body.

942
01:11:27,173 --> 01:11:28,606
Apetizing.

943
01:11:28,674 --> 01:11:32,303
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.

944
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:33,936
It delays the negative effects.

945
01:11:34,013 --> 01:11:35,480
They need it...

946
01:11:36,582 --> 01:11:37,810
Iike a drug.

947
01:11:37,884 --> 01:11:40,444
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people

948
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,681
are not affected by the gas itself,

949
01:11:42,755 --> 01:11:45,280
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.

950
01:11:45,358 --> 01:11:46,985
What do you want to do?

951
01:11:49,996 --> 01:11:51,657
Mexico.

952
01:11:51,764 --> 01:11:53,527
Put our backs against the ocean

953
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:55,191
and defend ourselves from there.

954
01:11:55,301 --> 01:11:57,132
No. We have to get back to my lab.

955
01:11:57,203 --> 01:11:59,194
This infection will sppread
all over the world,

956
01:11:59,272 --> 01:12:01,263
to every man, woman and child,

957
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:02,898
unless I finish my antidote.

958
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,636
You have an antidote?

959
01:12:13,352 --> 01:12:15,286
You! You!

960
01:12:15,354 --> 01:12:16,252
Come with us.

961
01:12:17,557 --> 01:12:18,581
Move it!

962
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:20,823
Move it, Peggy!

963
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:25,161
Uhh!

964
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:40,172
Do you like Ava Gardner?

965
01:12:41,347 --> 01:12:42,507
I'm sorry?

966
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:49,010
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?

967
01:12:50,656 --> 01:12:52,089
Yeah, I guess.

968
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:55,018
I was just thinking that you, uh...

969
01:12:55,094 --> 01:12:57,119
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.

970
01:13:05,104 --> 01:13:07,095
You got something
you want to say to me?

971
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:10,137
I have nothing to say to you.

972
01:13:10,209 --> 01:13:12,109
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

973
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:15,204
'Cause I could've swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.

974
01:13:16,082 --> 01:13:17,606
You want to say "fuck you" to me?

975
01:13:18,284 --> 01:13:19,842
Not at this moment.

976
01:13:22,555 --> 01:13:24,079
You know what this is?

977
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:27,149
A gun.

978
01:13:27,226 --> 01:13:29,319
It's simplicity itself.

979
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:32,321
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...

980
01:13:33,265 --> 01:13:35,256
and you pull the little trigger here...

981
01:13:36,068 --> 01:13:38,400
and a little bullet comes out of here.

982
01:13:38,471 --> 01:13:41,736
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

983
01:13:42,842 --> 01:13:44,036
And you know what?

984
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:47,802
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

985
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:55,412
Don't taunt me, tramp.

986
01:13:55,488 --> 01:13:58,787
I am not one to be taunted.

987
01:13:58,891 --> 01:13:59,983
You got it?

988
01:14:02,928 --> 01:14:05,089
Let me here you say, "l got it."

989
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:07,496
I got it.

990
01:14:07,566 --> 01:14:09,431
You damn well better.

991
01:14:16,842 --> 01:14:18,742
Tool.

992
01:14:24,183 --> 01:14:26,048
God damn it, that's it.

993
01:14:26,919 --> 01:14:28,614
I figured it out.

994
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:31,051
Salt.

995
01:14:31,123 --> 01:14:32,590
Got it all figured out. It's salt.

996
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:34,148
Blood is salty.

997
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:36,660
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.

998
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,825
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

999
01:14:39,932 --> 01:14:41,024
What are you doing, J.T.?

1000
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,034
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.

1001
01:14:43,135 --> 01:14:45,433
It'd just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.

1002
01:14:45,504 --> 01:14:47,904
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

1003
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:49,873
Don't do nothin' stuppid, J.T.
I got it covered.

1004
01:14:49,942 --> 01:14:52,911
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

1005
01:14:56,682 --> 01:14:57,979
- Dropp the gun!
- J.T.!

1006
01:14:59,685 --> 01:15:01,175
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!

1007
01:15:01,287 --> 01:15:02,652
Don't shoot!

1008
01:15:02,722 --> 01:15:03,882
J.T., you all right?

1009
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:06,386
Uhh!

1010
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:15,023
Hey, you all right, bro?

1011
01:15:15,134 --> 01:15:16,965
God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.

1012
01:15:17,036 --> 01:15:18,469
Not at all.

1013
01:15:18,537 --> 01:15:20,164
Wait here.

1014
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,400
Oh...I sure will.

1015
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,478
Goddamn sauce.

1016
01:15:34,687 --> 01:15:37,019
"Women in Cages".

1017
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:38,886
See them in action.

1018
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:42,224
See them in love.

1019
01:15:42,294 --> 01:15:44,762
See them in terror.

1020
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:47,390
White skin on the black market.

1021
01:15:47,466 --> 01:15:50,663
Soft flesh for hard cash.

1022
01:15:50,736 --> 01:15:52,795
"Women in Cages. "

1023
01:15:52,872 --> 01:15:54,999
I'm gonna go get my dick wet.

1024
01:15:55,074 --> 01:15:57,269
She's got one leg.

1025
01:15:57,343 --> 01:15:59,004
Easier access.

1026
01:16:01,113 --> 01:16:02,444
You got a point.

1027
01:16:09,889 --> 01:16:12,255
Get the rest of this shit uppstairs
and we'll blow this entire floor.

1028
01:16:12,324 --> 01:16:13,313
Yes, sir.

1029
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:28,836
Get Lewis down here.

1030
01:16:30,843 --> 01:16:32,435
He's getting his dick wet, sir.

1031
01:16:32,511 --> 01:16:34,672
Get him the fuck down here now!

1032
01:16:45,157 --> 01:16:46,488
Lewis?

1033
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:47,617
Wilson?

1034
01:17:03,609 --> 01:17:04,735
Where are my men?

1035
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:06,903
I've got several right here.

1036
01:17:09,281 --> 01:17:10,680
What the fuck's this?

1037
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,978
Their balls, sweetheart.

1038
01:17:16,655 --> 01:17:18,953
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.

1039
01:17:19,024 --> 01:17:21,254
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

1040
01:17:21,327 --> 01:17:22,351
Because I earned it.

1041
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:23,985
How do you figure that?

1042
01:17:24,063 --> 01:17:27,362
You want the story?
I'll spin it for you quick.

1043
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:30,300
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

1044
01:17:30,369 --> 01:17:33,497
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands

1045
01:17:33,572 --> 01:17:37,303
and our balls in our throats,
lookin' for America's most wanted.

1046
01:17:37,376 --> 01:17:38,866
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.

1047
01:17:38,944 --> 01:17:41,071
For once, our intel
was right on the money.

1048
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:42,374
I come around a corner--

1049
01:17:42,448 --> 01:17:44,382
bam, there he is,
lookin' me right in the eyes.

1050
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,576
Wait.

1051
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:47,619
You killed bin Laden?

1052
01:17:47,686 --> 01:17:51,053
I put ttwo in his heart,
one in his compputer.

1053
01:17:51,156 --> 01:17:53,147
So that was you.

1054
01:17:53,225 --> 01:17:54,522
Yeah.

1055
01:17:55,394 --> 01:17:56,691
That was me.

1056
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:00,821
Class-A clusterfuck.

1057
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,199
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,

1058
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:08,104
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.

1059
01:18:08,173 --> 01:18:12,075
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.

1060
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:14,304
No cure.

1061
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,814
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side

1062
01:18:16,882 --> 01:18:18,907
willing to sell us batches of this shit.

1063
01:18:18,984 --> 01:18:22,249
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

1064
01:18:22,321 --> 01:18:25,813
Then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace,

1065
01:18:25,891 --> 01:18:29,019
the experiment and its survivors,

1066
01:18:29,094 --> 01:18:30,755
you'd find a cure.

1067
01:18:30,829 --> 01:18:33,525
I swore to my men
that I'd do everything in my power

1068
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:35,089
to keepp them alive.

1069
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,327
And that's what I intend to do, Wray.

1070
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:40,869
Understand?

1071
01:18:42,408 --> 01:18:44,740
I never had a choice.

1072
01:18:47,746 --> 01:18:49,145
Neither do l, sir.

1073
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:53,985
God bless you
and your service to this country.

1074
01:19:00,759 --> 01:19:02,056
You're a doctor?

1075
01:19:02,761 --> 01:19:03,853
Heh.

1076
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:06,695
I was earlier tonight.

1077
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:10,831
I always wanted to be a doctor.

1078
01:19:10,903 --> 01:19:14,134
Instead, I can do...

1079
01:19:14,206 --> 01:19:15,605
this.

1080
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:19,542
Ohh. Useless talent number 66.

1081
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:24,844
I'm very pliable.

1082
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:26,544
A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.

1083
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:30,054
She said at some point in your life,

1084
01:19:30,122 --> 01:19:33,319
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.

1085
01:19:34,259 --> 01:19:36,352
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.

1086
01:19:36,428 --> 01:19:38,760
I'm not that optimistic.

1087
01:19:38,831 --> 01:19:42,392
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

1088
01:19:42,468 --> 01:19:43,730
She'd say...

1089
01:19:44,603 --> 01:19:46,571
when you're stuck in that spiral...

1090
01:19:47,573 --> 01:19:48,938
you reach up.

1091
01:19:49,742 --> 01:19:52,643
What if there's nothing up there?

1092
01:19:53,545 --> 01:19:55,274
Just reach up.

1093
01:19:57,116 --> 01:19:58,344
You're a dancer.

1094
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:00,918
I was earlier tonight.

1095
01:20:00,986 --> 01:20:03,580
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!

1096
01:20:06,258 --> 01:20:08,385
Get your ass up!

1097
01:20:10,295 --> 01:20:13,787
Now, I'm starved for entertainment, baby,
and that means you.

1098
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:14,855
Radio!

1099
01:20:17,102 --> 01:20:19,593
Wail, baby, now!

1100
01:20:24,043 --> 01:20:25,943
' to a pay...

1101
01:20:26,011 --> 01:20:27,000
That's--

1102
01:20:27,112 --> 01:20:29,910
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1103
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:32,144
Dance it up.

1104
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:35,253
Keep dancing!

1105
01:20:35,988 --> 01:20:37,683
'Cause now. I'm jaded...

1106
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:41,487
I have seen me
some crazy ass shit in my day...

1107
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:45,896
but ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

1108
01:20:45,998 --> 01:20:48,694
I have seen me a stripper
with one breast,

1109
01:20:48,801 --> 01:20:51,736
and I've seen me a stripper
with 12 toes,

1110
01:20:51,837 --> 01:20:54,328
and I've seen me a stripper
with no brains at all,

1111
01:20:54,406 --> 01:20:57,534
but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

1112
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:59,543
And I've been to Morocco.

1113
01:21:00,612 --> 01:21:02,375
Dance, bitch!

1114
01:21:04,183 --> 01:21:05,946
Break a leg!

1115
01:21:07,019 --> 01:21:09,078
Break it off! Ha ha!

1116
01:21:18,497 --> 01:21:20,727
Dance for me, motherfucker.

1117
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:22,664
- Uhh!
- Aaaaah!

1118
01:21:22,734 --> 01:21:23,428
Aah!

1119
01:21:23,502 --> 01:21:26,198
Ohhhh!

1120
01:21:34,746 --> 01:21:36,907
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

1121
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:39,506
Actually, yes.

1122
01:21:39,585 --> 01:21:41,553
You gave me some wood,

1123
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:43,611
now I'm gonna give you...

1124
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:46,715
some fuckin' wood!

1125
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:48,760
Alh--ah!

1126
01:21:56,235 --> 01:21:59,204
Alhh!

1127
01:21:59,271 --> 01:22:01,796
The gas! You need your gas!

1128
01:22:01,874 --> 01:22:03,933
No! Fuck the gas, fuck it.

1129
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:06,443
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

1130
01:22:17,823 --> 01:22:19,154
Aah!

1131
01:22:19,258 --> 01:22:20,452
Uhh!

1132
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:22,459
Where'd you get that?

1133
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:24,688
Useless talent number 37.

1134
01:22:26,131 --> 01:22:27,826
Aaaaah!

1135
01:22:47,452 --> 01:22:49,443
Uhh! Uhh!

1136
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:52,852
I broke my leg.

1137
01:22:52,925 --> 01:22:55,655
That's okay.
I made you something.

1138
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,523
I do believe in you.

1139
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:02,765
Always have.

1140
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:05,428
I believe that you could be better.

1141
01:23:05,504 --> 01:23:07,802
You deserve better,

1142
01:23:07,873 --> 01:23:09,534
even better than me.

1143
01:23:10,409 --> 01:23:11,637
Right now,

1144
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:13,644
I need you to become...

1145
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,807
who you're meant to be.

1146
01:23:17,716 --> 01:23:18,910
Stand.

1147
01:23:24,489 --> 01:23:26,821
I'd stand clear if I were you.

1148
01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:35,292
Oppen that door, will you, baby?

1149
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,745
Uhh!

1150
01:24:03,495 --> 01:24:05,622
They've destroyed most of the tanks.

1151
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:08,991
Any that are left
we'll get on our way to the helicoppters.

1152
01:24:09,067 --> 01:24:11,297
There are two helicopters,

1153
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:13,395
big enough to take all of us.

1154
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,966
Who can fly?

1155
01:24:19,111 --> 01:24:21,511
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

1156
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,172
I can fly, but...

1157
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:25,216
no way in hell I'm gonna fly tonight.

1158
01:24:25,284 --> 01:24:27,081
Okay. Cool.

1159
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:28,413
I'll fly.

1160
01:24:29,721 --> 01:24:30,915
Let's go.

1161
01:24:37,062 --> 01:24:38,859
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

1162
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:41,794
You'll take care of this for me,
then, Sheriff?

1163
01:24:43,068 --> 01:24:44,729
With pleasure.

1164
01:24:44,803 --> 01:24:46,065
Three minutes.

1165
01:24:47,005 --> 01:24:49,166
Your brother's a good man, J.T.

1166
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:50,833
Best in Texas.

1167
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:55,205
Hop on.

1168
01:24:58,517 --> 01:24:59,882
No, the other way.

1169
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:01,248
Oh.

1170
01:25:03,889 --> 01:25:06,449
No. The other way.

1171
01:25:53,638 --> 01:25:56,072
The helicopters are
on the other side of this wall.

1172
01:26:03,048 --> 01:26:04,310
We make a run for it!

1173
01:26:04,383 --> 01:26:07,546
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

1174
01:26:07,652 --> 01:26:08,880
Don't you get it?

1175
01:26:08,987 --> 01:26:11,478
We're the antidote.

1176
01:26:11,556 --> 01:26:13,046
Well, is there another way around?

1177
01:26:13,158 --> 01:26:15,058
Wait here.

1178
01:26:41,286 --> 01:26:45,120
I don't suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around? Heh.

1179
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:46,851
Take that as a no.

1180
01:26:48,827 --> 01:26:50,454
We have to get over that wall!

1181
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:57,034
I was thinkin' we could build us
a new place,

1182
01:26:57,102 --> 01:26:59,229
right there where the old one was.

1183
01:27:00,105 --> 01:27:01,663
You cook,

1184
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:03,367
I work the back.

1185
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:07,941
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

1186
01:27:08,013 --> 01:27:11,346
We share the recippe,
we share the rent.

1187
01:27:16,488 --> 01:27:18,786
Start at 250 degrees.

1188
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:23,517
I knew it.

1189
01:27:23,595 --> 01:27:25,062
For how long?

1190
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,530
- 12 pounds?
- Sure.

1191
01:27:27,599 --> 01:27:29,794
12 pounds, 12 hours.

1192
01:27:29,901 --> 01:27:31,960
Wrapped in tin foil, right?

1193
01:27:32,037 --> 01:27:34,164
I don't use no goddamn foil.

1194
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,263
Damn.

1195
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:37,603
Tomatoes? Fresh?

1196
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:40,009
Canned.

1197
01:27:40,078 --> 01:27:41,739
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1198
01:27:41,813 --> 01:27:43,041
You score me some?

1199
01:27:43,114 --> 01:27:44,638
Oh, yeah.

1200
01:27:44,749 --> 01:27:46,717
'Cause we're brothers.

1201
01:27:48,386 --> 01:27:50,547
Thank you for this.

1202
01:27:50,622 --> 01:27:52,180
You just remember...

1203
01:27:52,257 --> 01:27:55,158
you got to take this recipe
to your grave.

1204
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:59,424
I think I can...
goddamn guarantee that.

1205
01:28:24,356 --> 01:28:25,948
That's our cue.

1206
01:28:28,326 --> 01:28:29,987
Cherry, darling...

1207
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:33,229
it's all you.

1208
01:29:04,563 --> 01:29:05,825
Let's go!

1209
01:30:11,096 --> 01:30:12,791
Aah!

1210
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:14,958
Wray!

1211
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:19,831
Damn it, Wray.

1212
01:30:19,904 --> 01:30:21,132
Ohh.

1213
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:25,434
Okay. You need to get up
'cause we're leaving.

1214
01:30:50,035 --> 01:30:52,435
They told me I'd find you here.

1215
01:30:55,774 --> 01:30:58,675
I was beginning to lose hope.

1216
01:30:58,777 --> 01:31:00,540
I'm sorry...

1217
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,341
but I lied.

1218
01:31:05,784 --> 01:31:09,379
I did want to hurt you.

1219
01:31:11,022 --> 01:31:12,887
My turn.

1220
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:26,998
No more dead bodies
for Daddy tonight.

1221
01:31:28,573 --> 01:31:31,064
Never did like that son of a bitch.

1222
01:31:32,844 --> 01:31:37,144
About as useless
as a pecker on a pope.

1223
01:31:43,354 --> 01:31:44,514
Don't touch anything.

1224
01:31:44,622 --> 01:31:45,884
I want to fly it.

1225
01:31:45,957 --> 01:31:48,187
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you're doing!

1226
01:31:48,293 --> 01:31:49,487
- I do know what I'm doing!
- No, you don't!

1227
01:31:49,561 --> 01:31:51,825
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up, sit down...

1228
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:53,693
and don't fuckin' touch anything!

1229
01:32:00,205 --> 01:32:01,331
Everybody sit down!

1230
01:32:08,213 --> 01:32:09,703
Whoo!

1231
01:32:18,056 --> 01:32:19,114
Hit the wipers.

1232
01:32:24,929 --> 01:32:26,453
Go on, leave me.

1233
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:29,193
I am not leaving you here like this.

1234
01:32:29,267 --> 01:32:32,168
Motherfuckers around here
eat road kill.

1235
01:32:33,972 --> 01:32:36,634
See? I'm funny.

1236
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:39,002
I made you laugh.

1237
01:32:39,077 --> 01:32:40,237
Go to the ocean.

1238
01:32:40,345 --> 01:32:43,371
Put your bacs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

1239
01:32:43,448 --> 01:32:46,144
I'm not leaving you, Wray.

1240
01:32:47,318 --> 01:32:49,513
It's two against the world.

1241
01:32:50,789 --> 01:32:52,381
It will be.

1242
01:32:53,892 --> 01:32:55,291
I promise.

1243
01:32:56,127 --> 01:32:57,924
I never miss.

1244
01:32:59,364 --> 01:33:01,161
Don't worry, baby.

1245
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,068
You'll find your way.

1246
01:33:19,117 --> 01:33:22,575
Reach up!

1247
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:36,865
Reach up!

1248
01:34:23,248 --> 01:34:25,614
It's like you said
it would be, Wray.

1249
01:34:27,685 --> 01:34:30,279
I'm like you said I would be.

1250
01:34:30,355 --> 01:34:32,016
I find the lost...

1251
01:34:32,991 --> 01:34:34,288
the weary...

1252
01:34:35,593 --> 01:34:37,584
those that have no hoppe.

1253
01:34:37,662 --> 01:34:40,654
I find them and I lead them...

1254
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:44,157
to a land we've made for ourselves.

1255
01:34:45,536 --> 01:34:47,504
The land by the sea.

1256
01:35:21,873 --> 01:35:23,636
It's beautiful.

1257
01:35:24,642 --> 01:35:27,042
She's beautiful.

1258
01:35:29,047 --> 01:35:32,676
I wish you could see us, us two.

1259
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:35,516
It's like you said it would be.

1260
01:35:36,788 --> 01:35:38,813
Two against the world, baby.

1261
01:35:39,724 --> 01:35:41,521
Two against the world.

1262
01:39:40,631 --> 01:39:46,269
See the pyramids along the Nile
