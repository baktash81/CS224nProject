00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:19,242
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of four orphans brought together by fate.</i>

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,252
<i>They didn't know it yet...</i>

3
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,255
<i>but there was something greater</i>
<i>in store for them-</i>

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,325
<i>something epic.</i>

5
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,076
<i>Meet our first orphan- Lucy.</i>

6
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,911
<i>She had been raised by</i>
<i>a kindly old museum curator.</i>

7
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,917
- <i>But alas...</i>
- Ohh!

8
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,385
<i>he was murdered.</i>

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,057
Ow.

10
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,891
Oh, please don't die.

11
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,398
Please don't die. You're all I have.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,128
You're on my hand.

13
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,139
Oh, sorry.

14
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,767
It's a code.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,010
But what is it?

16
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:29,647
Oh, my God! Oh, God!
The code! Please! Give me another clue!

17
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,082
I didn't read the book on tape.

18
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,128
Habeas corpus.
<i>E pluribus unum.</i>

19
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,096
God.
Um, the code, please.

20
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,203
<i>Your body is in the shape</i>
<i>of a letter. Is it the letter "D"?</i>

21
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,542
<i>Please! Please!</i>

22
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,171
Um, that's an "A"!

23
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:03,988
<i>It's "V"! "V"! Uh, "I"! "I"!</i>

24
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,623
Um, "N"!

25
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,095
Uh- Um-

26
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,998
Um, "I"-

27
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,402
Oh! "C"! "C"!
"I-C"!

28
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,468
"I"! "I."
Da-Da-Da- Da Vinci!

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,044
Right!

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,710
<i>Oh, God. Oh.</i>

31
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,344
Oh.

32
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,823
"So lame the hair of Tom."

33
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,264
Wait. "Lame."

34
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,266
"Lame" is a-

35
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,201
"Lame" is a seven-letter word.

36
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,570
The code is seven!
Right!

37
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,522
Oh, thank-

38
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,304
Right.

39
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,905
<i>Then there was</i>
<i>our next orphan, Edward.</i>

40
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:41,646
<i>He was living in a Mexican monastery</i>
<i>with all the other children.</i>

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,591
I'm not eating that.

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,066
Be grateful, Eduardo.

43
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,001
Today I made something
especially scrumptious.

44
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:13,413
Nacho!

45
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,355
Nacho!

46
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,487
Nacho!

47
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:33,769
Nacho...

48
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:39,277
Nacho...

49
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,678
cheese flavored Doritos are delicious!

50
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,022
Ah-choo!

51
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,727
I'm sick of this!

52
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,028
I'm going to be
a <i>lucha libre</i> wrestler.

53
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,836
You think you are better
than the other orphans?

54
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,635
- Yes.
- Chanchito!

55
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,735
<i>Come. Teach him a lesson</i>
<i>in humility.</i>

56
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,558
You gotta be kidding me.

57
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,495
You like the flavor
of the beans going up your nose?

58
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,398
Just take his arm
and spin it around!

59
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,375
Chanchito, throw him off the table.

60
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,684
Sweet!

61
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,280
And stay out, <i>cabr√≥n</i>!

62
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,969
<i>Our next orphan, Susan...</i>

63
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:16,269
<i>was on her way to Namibia to</i>
<i>meet her new adoptive parents.</i>

64
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,581
- Can I get you a cocktail?
- Just some water.

65
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,278
Okay.
What can I get you to drink?

66
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,412
<i>More juice, please.</i>

67
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,265
I chose the wrong day to fly!

68
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,703
Enough is enough!

69
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,672
I've had it with these motherfuckin'
snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

70
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,174
- So have I!
- <i>Enough is enough!</i>

71
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,179
I've had it with these motherfuckin'
snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

72
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,943
- Right!
- I've had it...

73
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,951
<i>with these motherfuckin' snakes</i>
<i>on this motherfuckin' plane!</i>

74
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,021
Why do you keep saying that?

75
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,023
Because Internet bloggers
love it when I say...

76
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,617
I've had it with these motherfuckin'
snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!

77
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,526
All right.
We get it already. Okay?

78
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,566
No, I don't think you do!

79
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,570
<i>I've had it with these motherfuckin'</i>
<i>snakes on this motherfuckin' plane!</i>

80
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:56,130
- Why are you yelling?
- Shit, bitch, I'm <i>always</i> yellin'!

81
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm Samuel motherfuckin' Jackson!

82
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,544
Bitch?

83
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,045
- The designer understands these things.
- Darling, you look great.

84
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,392
I'm so hot.

85
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,842
Yes!

86
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,921
<i>And finally...</i>

87
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,923
<i>our last orphan, Peter.</i>

88
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:50,394
<i>He made his home among</i>
<i>the undesirables of society- the mutants.</i>

89
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,932
<i>But even there he was an outcast.</i>

90
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,276
Hi, Mystique.
Hi, L.C.

91
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,475
Right, um, so, anyway,
I was wondering...

92
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,986
would you like to come
to the homecoming dance with me?

93
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,425
As if.

94
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,304
Nice hair, Rogue.

95
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,716
You talkin' to my girl...

96
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,786
numbnuts?

97
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,055
Asshole.

98
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:54,246
- <i>Fight. Fight. Fight.</i>
- Fight! Fight!

99
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,184
What are you gonna do about it?

100
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,920
He's unleashing his powers!

101
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,766
He's gonna spread angel wings!

102
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,705
More like chicken wings!

103
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,183
<i>Break it up.</i>
<i>Break it up.</i>

104
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:35,522
You all know Peter is too much
of a pussy to stand up for himself.

105
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,376
Aah!

106
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,996
<i>And for these four orphans...</i>

107
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,157
<i>life would never be the same.</i>

108
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,385
Gross.

109
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,869
<i>Welcome.</i>

110
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,775
<i>You</i> must be Susan.

111
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,542
And you... are Peter.

112
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,144
And you're Edward.

113
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,812
And you-

114
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,386
You're Lucy.

115
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,629
I've been expecting you.

116
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,529
So, come on!

117
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,932
Ooh!

118
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,760
I love your legendary candy.

119
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,824
A chocolate river!

120
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,571
Mmm!

121
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,079
It's delicious!

122
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,681
It's so delicious!

123
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,022
Yea!

124
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,960
Chocolate!

125
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,968
That's, uh-

126
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,732
- That's actually the sewer line. Yeah.
- <i>It's delic-</i>

127
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,642
<i>Children, do you want to know...</i>

128
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,312
what makes all my candy
taste so special?

129
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,753
Uh-huh.

130
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,553
It's a special, secret ingredient.

131
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,063
It's real human parts.

132
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,827
There's gonna be a little itty-bitty piece
of each and every one of you...

133
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:06,063
inside of the Yummy Yum candy-
literally.

134
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,605
I'm gettin' out of here.

135
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,240
Let us out, freak!

136
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,279
Let us out, freak!

137
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,077
No, no.
I can't do that.

138
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,117
- Yes, you can.
- Yes, you can.

139
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,948
You're... mine now.

140
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,276
Aah!

141
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,458
Aah!

142
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,386
Stop! Let me go!

143
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,244
Ow!

144
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,251
Aah!

145
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,885
What are you doing?

146
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,757
- Willy told me he wanted his knob polished.
- Dumb-ass.

147
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,729
We've gotta get out of here.

148
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,561
- We gotta get out of here.
- I just said that.

149
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,568
You just said that.

150
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,299
Where are we gonna go?
I don't have a home to go back to.

151
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,933
I thought this golden ticket
was my lucky break.

152
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,569
The curator was all I had.

153
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,080
I never had anyone.
I raised myself.

154
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,641
And that's why you have
such a tough exterior?

155
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,812
Yeah.

156
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,947
And you're kinda bitchy.

157
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,825
- Why us?
- Because we're four kids nobody would ever miss.

158
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,829
We'll be stuck here till we die.

159
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,092
Shut up, Edward.
You're scaring her.

160
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,658
Don't tell me what to do!
You're not my father!

161
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,432
- Two for flinching.
- Oww! Aah!

162
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,270
Leave Peter alone.
He was just sticking up for her.

163
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,179
I can take care of myself.

164
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,908
Like it or not,
we're all in this.

165
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,920
<i>It's obvious we don't like each other,</i>
<i>but if we're going to survive...</i>

166
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,922
we have to stick together.

167
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,753
Aah!

168
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,021
- Ow.
- Was the fight over?

169
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,426
I didn't know.

170
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,436
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Shh! Someone's coming.

171
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,369
<i>Who wants to chew my gum balls?</i>

172
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,204
It's Willy. Hide!

173
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,454
<i>Where are you?</i>

174
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,043
<i>I'm gonna find you.</i>

175
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,062
Wow.

176
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,505
Wow.

177
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,042
Ooh! Oh.

178
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,082
Ooh.

179
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,733
Ooh.

180
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,553
It's stuck.
It's- It's stuck.

181
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,625
It's- It's stuck.

182
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,755
You can do it!

183
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,891
My tongue!

184
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,767
My ba-a-a-a-ad.

185
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,209
Where am I?

186
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,075
The world of Gnarnia.

187
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,058
<i>Oh!</i>

188
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,220
A silent "G," as in "gnome."

189
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,764
Or "gnarly."

190
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,766
- For legal purposes.
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,928
- I'm Mr. Tumnus.
- Oh, my name is Lucy.

192
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,730
What are you?

193
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,205
I'm a faun.
Half man, half goat.

194
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,710
- Oh, so you mean-
- Yeah. Dad screwed a goat.

195
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,808
These are my folks.

196
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,114
<i>Oh!</i>

197
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,086
- You have her goatee.
- Thanks.

198
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,024
- And you?
- Oh. No.

199
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,099
Both of my parents are human.

200
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,827
Eew. Gro-o-o-ss!

201
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,100
Aah- No. Yeah.

202
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,074
So, you are
a daughter of Eve, huh?

203
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,145
Uh-huh.

204
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,480
How rude of me.
Let me show you around.

205
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,921
Oh. Oh! Oh!

206
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,961
<i>I- I-</i>

207
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,502
Welcome to my faun crib.

208
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,521
Come on. Let's go.

209
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,424
Let's see what's in the fridge.

210
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,205
Ooh!
Always gotta have Cristal.

211
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,202
For when Diddy's in the house.
Yo, Diddy!

212
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,389
Say "What's up?" to the honeys.

213
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,877
Check out my plasma.

214
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,378
Say hello to my little friend!

215
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,673
Wanna play us?
Okay. Let's play.

216
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,614
<i>Scarface</i> is the shit!

217
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,453
I'm Tony Fauntana!

218
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,187
You mess with me,
you're messing with the best!

219
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:38,100
You ain't a true player unless
you got flat screens everywhere.

220
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,104
In the toilet,
when I'm taking a leak.

221
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,231
Say hello to my little friend!

222
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,376
Wanna play us?
Okay, let's play!

223
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,140
This is my favorite part.

224
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,211
Whew!

225
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,450
Under the couch for when
I'm looking for change.

226
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,057
Boo-yah!
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Ching!

227
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,655
On the top of her head
for when she, you know...

228
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,927
shines my hooves.

229
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,337
So now you all seen my crib.

230
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,812
So get the hell out!

231
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,610
Well, I really should
be getting back.

232
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:32,349
No, but you, um, must stay.

233
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,358
Oh, Mr. Tumnus,
I'll never forget you.

234
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,155
Please take this
to remember me by.

235
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,467
And I you.

236
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,431
I'm sorry.

237
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,509
Lucy...

238
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,547
you are in danger.

239
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,811
- What are you-
- You must go now.

240
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,318
Oh! What's wrong?

241
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,547
Take this.
It will explain everything.

242
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,863
<i>Confirm identification.</i>

243
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,942
My eyes! My-

244
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,878
Oh.

245
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,971
Well, that's better than LASIK.

246
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,684
The evil White Bitch who rules Gnarnia...

247
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,192
has ordered anyone
who finds a human to turn them in.

248
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:46,059
I brought you ba-a-a-ack
to my lair to betray you...

249
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,064
but I couldn't do it.

250
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,361
You are a true friend.

251
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,564
She has plunged our
once-peaceful land into eternal winter.

252
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,233
Under her two terms,
we now have...

253
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,573
wiretaps, no gay marriage...

254
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,877
not to mention her bumbling
of the hurricane relief effort.

255
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:10,444
And-And the White Bitch
doesn't care about black people.

256
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,725
There is a small
resistance movement.

257
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,786
They learned she's developing
a weapon of mass destruction...

258
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,957
that can kill all of us.

259
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,038
Wait, a real W.M.D.,
or, like, a fake Saddam one?

260
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,231
No, a <i>real</i> one.

261
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,274
That sounds bad.

262
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,709
Go now, before she finds you.

263
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,803
- But-
- <i>There's no time to argue.</i>

264
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,313
Go no-o-o-o-ow!

265
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,077
<i>This message</i>
<i>will self-destruct in one second.</i>

266
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,652
Wait-What?

267
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,495
<i>Come out, come out,</i>
<i>wherever you are.</i>

268
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,493
- Lucy?
- <i>Who wants to play with Willy?</i>

269
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,438
Lucy, move over.
I need someplace to hide.

270
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,606
Lucy. Lu-

271
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,942
Who lives here?
Liberace?

272
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,722
Aah!

273
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,625
This is a really big wardrobe.

274
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,022
What a MI LF.

275
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,499
Kneel before the queen!

276
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,337
You're a son of Adam.

277
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:43,771
A what?
No, I'm Edward.

278
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,775
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
I-

279
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,345
- I was following Lucy into the wardrobe and-
- Lucy?

280
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,914
- How many are in your family?
- No.

281
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,575
Lucy, Peter and Susan
are <i>not</i> my family.

282
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,676
We're all just a bunch of orphans.

283
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,085
The prophecy!

284
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,352
Please.

285
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,893
Let me help you up.

286
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,291
Wow.

287
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,961
- Oh, you must be parched.
- Yes.

288
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,637
<i>Whoa.</i>

289
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,912
Wow. A 40?

290
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,923
- Ah.
- Drink.

291
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,996
Fresh dog piss.
Go ahead.

292
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,437
Yeah!

293
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,940
I love this place.

294
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,443
And this can all be your new home.

295
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,571
With my help, you can be king.

296
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,977
Wha-What? King?

297
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,189
He can't be king-
Oww!

298
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,088
And you would be my queen?

299
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,827
I've never had a girlfriend before.

300
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,367
Oh!

301
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,510
Ah!

302
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,945
How about that?

303
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,182
Oh, but first
I must meet the others.

304
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,351
<i>Why? You're not gonna make</i>
<i>Peter king too, are you?</i>

305
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,895
Oh! No.

306
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:50,525
But every king
needs subjects to boss around.

307
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,337
But, Your Majesty-

308
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,311
Behold, my white castle.

309
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,482
<i>White Castle?</i>

310
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,485
I feel like I've been there before.

311
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:13,079
Bring me the others,
and I'll crown you king.

312
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,660
Yes!

313
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,247
Lucy?

314
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,613
Edward!

315
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,209
You went through
the wardrobe too.

316
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,516
- <i>Lucy!</i>
- <i>Lucy!</i>

317
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,682
- <i>Edward!</i>
- Edward?

318
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,618
This is quite a hiding place.

319
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,061
We have to go now.
We're in grave danger.

320
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,225
Oh, no, no. We should stay right here.
What's the hurry, Lucy?

321
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,235
I mean, they just got here.

322
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,032
Hey, look!
I'm spelling my name!

323
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,472
- Mm-mmm.
- Please!

324
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,045
We have to go.
Mr. Tumnus told me.

325
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,581
Mr. Tumnus?
Who the bloody hell's that?

326
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,549
I love Sudoku!

327
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,253
He's a goat-man...

328
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,222
and he warned of great peril!

329
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,225
- Oh, Lucy.
- Fine!

330
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,728
If you think I'm lying,
just go ask him yourself!

331
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,423
Hmph.

332
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,261
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

333
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,007
Hey, look!
Nicole Richie!

334
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,408
<i>Mm-mmm.</i>

335
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,454
Mr. Tumnus?

336
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,125
Shit.
I know what happened.

337
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,634
- What the hell is that thing?
- It's a talking beaver!

338
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,533
- Holy shit!
- Get it outta here!

339
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,368
No!
Motherf-

340
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,339
<i>Something in my groin tells me</i>
<i>you're not used to a talking beaver.</i>

341
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,851
My name is Harry Beaver.

342
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,383
Mr. Tumnus is my life partner.

343
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,289
<i>Mmm. Sweet man.</i>

344
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,154
Mr. Tumnus was taken
by the White Bitch.

345
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,699
She's hot-
I mean, never heard of her.

346
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,794
The evil ruler. She arrested
Mr. Tumnus for hiding a human.

347
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,169
Is there anything
we can do to help?

348
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,174
Uh, yes.
You must go to Aslo.

349
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,040
He's waiting for you
at the Ancient Table.

350
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,877
- Who's Aslo?
- Who's Aslo?

351
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,644
He's the true king of Gnarnia.

352
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,379
- Not for long.
- <i>Hello? The prophecy?</i>

353
00:35:56,487 --> 00:36:01,151
The four of you will join Aslo and lead
the resistance to destroy the White Bitch.

354
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,386
- Us?
- <i>Yes. You're all heroes.</i>

355
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,519
Especially you, Peter.

356
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,192
<i>My son,</i>
<i>I have sent you to Earth for a reason.</i>

357
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,496
<i>You will be the savior</i>
<i>of all mankind.</i>

358
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,609
<i>You are truly invincible.</i>

359
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,791
Oh, my God! You shot me
in the fucking eye! That really hurts!

360
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:40,091
Why would you do that?
That was so unnecessary! You bastard!

361
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,696
- But I can't be.
"But I can't be." Why him?

362
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:53,243
Well, maybe not Superman,
but a hero all the same.

363
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,312
It's your destiny.

364
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,983
<i>Do you think you were</i>
<i>all brought together by chance?</i>

365
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,249
Look at the clues.
They're all around you.

366
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,993
Oh, that's nice.

367
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,082
We're all in the painting.

368
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,083
But what does it mean?

369
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,401
Right.

370
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,400
It's a "cryptix."

371
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,976
The curator taught me
how to decipher these.

372
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,975
Upsy-daisy.

373
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,865
Be careful.

374
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,839
Well, what is it?

375
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,708
It's our birth certificates.

376
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,680
We all have the same last name
and the same parents.

377
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,491
- I don't get it.
- You're all related!

378
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,595
Brothers and sisters.

379
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,995
You're a family, for Christ sakes!

380
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,660
- Sorry.
- Is it really true?

381
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,762
None of us ever had
a real family before.

382
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:05,706
None of us ever had a real family before.

383
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,007
<i>It's true.</i>
<i>You're quadruplets.</i>

384
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:12,605
- But our parents-
- Killed by the White Bitch.

385
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:17,882
<i>Then she separated the four of you</i>
<i>so the prophecy would never be fulfilled.</i>

386
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,092
Where's Edward?

387
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,127
Hey, honey, I'm home.

388
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,256
Hey, buddy.
Did you miss me?

389
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,767
Ohh!

390
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,101
- Why?
- <i>'Cause I ain't your buddy!</i>

391
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,708
Where are the others?

392
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,711
I thought we had something special.

393
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,714
I even got a tattoo
with your name on it.

394
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,657
<i>That looks more like</i>
<i>50 Cent's tattoo, you idiot.</i>

395
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,886
Shit!
They did the wrong one.

396
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:03,595
I won't ask again.
Where is the rest of your family?

397
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,068
I told you,
they're not my family.

398
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,507
<i>Tell me where they are.</i>

399
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,009
Never.

400
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,919
Yeah, they went to Mr. Tumnus's house.

401
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:29,058
Yes! Yes!
You just got punk'd! Yes!

402
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,994
He did it!
He did it!

403
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,929
Say it to the camera.
Come on, say it right there.

404
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,932
- Say it!
- I just got punk'd.

405
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,628
Schwow! Yeah!

406
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:44,003
We just punk'd Edward!
Schwow! Schwow! Yeah!

407
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,874
That was awesome!
Yeah! Yes!

408
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,606
This thing up here is all me, baby!

409
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,614
The trucker hat-
That's awesome!

410
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,981
I did it. You love it.
You'll take it. Punk'd 'im!

411
00:40:56,086 --> 00:41:00,045
- That was really funny! Oh, my gosh! Too funny!
- You are so annoying!

412
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,853
No, that was really funny though!

413
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,396
Schwow! Schwow! Schwow!
Schwow! Schwow!

414
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,058
Candy-ass trucker hat!

415
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,295
Schwow. Schwow.

416
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,372
Silas!

417
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,880
The kids are with Mr. Tumnus.

418
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,043
I want you to find them
and kill them.

419
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:33,249
Persona non grata.
Magna cum laude.

420
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:49,335
Urts-hay oh-say ood-gay!
Ooh!

421
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,908
Ood-gay.

422
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,001
<i>Ooh.</i>

423
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,103
No. No!

424
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,182
- Here. You goin' to prison.
- Ow! Dude!

425
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,350
- Edward!
- Edward!
- Edward!

426
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,423
- <i>Edward!</i>
- Mr. Tumnus!

427
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,070
I miss the smell of you, Harry Beaver.

428
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,310
Eew.

429
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,310
Oh, yeah.

430
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,580
The White Bitch did this to you?
Shit!

431
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,658
And now she has Edward.

432
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,159
- We must rescue hi-
- Get ahold of yourself, Lucy!

433
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,320
- Holy-
- <i>It's too dangerous.</i>

434
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,160
If she catch you,
you are as good as dead.

435
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,429
Um, that's me.

436
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,406
"The resistance has found out...

437
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,534
"that the White Bitch has completed
her weapon of mass destruction...

438
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,475
and is going to launch it
in 24 hours."

439
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,777
Let's get the hell out of here!

440
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,477
Aslo is the only one
that can help now.

441
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,282
Then take us to him.

442
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,358
What'd you do that for?

443
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,595
I forgot.

444
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,599
Before you meet Aslo,
you must train.

445
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:26,534
Only then you can defeat
the White Bitch...

446
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,537
and save your brother.

447
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,506
I'll meet you at Aslo's.
May the Force be with you.

448
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:48,616
Someone's coming.
The bitch is on to you. You must go now.

449
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,388
There you will train.

450
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,395
Go!

451
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,166
Mr. Tumnus?

452
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,635
I will stay behind
and fight him off.

453
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,734
No matter what,
you must not come back for me.

454
00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,405
- Yep.
- <i>Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!</i>

455
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,108
Run!

456
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,991
Stop!

457
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:33,160
If you want them,
you'll have to go through me first.

458
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:38,603
Please! Help!

459
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,007
He needs our help!

460
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,443
- <i>Help!</i>
- No, Susan, Lucy.

461
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:45,640
He... wants us to go on.

462
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,217
He sacrificed himself for us.

463
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,253
<i>Peter, if you can hear me...</i>

464
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,289
<i>come back now!</i>

465
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:58,520
<i>I definitely underestimated</i>
<i>the situation.</i>

466
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,562
<i>I'm in a lot of pain!</i>

467
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,566
What should we do?

468
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,569
Uh, we can't go back.
We have to-

469
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:11,698
- We have to do what's best
for Edward and for Gnarnia.
- <i>Screw Gnarnia!</i>

470
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,870
He's testing us.

471
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:19,244
<i>This is not a test!</i>
<i>I can see my brains!</i>

472
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,424
<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>

473
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,201
Welcome!
My name is Harry Potter!

474
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,707
Aren't you a little old
to still be a student here?

475
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,210
Nonsense.
I am but 14.

476
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,611
As are my two best friends,
Ron and Hermione.

477
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,885
Greetings.

478
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,754
Hope you chicks are on the pill.

479
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,756
Harry likes to get wasted...

480
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,053
then show off
his sorcerer's stones.

481
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:43,131
They are definitely too old
to still be doing this shit.

482
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,134
We shall train you
so you can defeat the White Bitch...

483
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,136
and restore peace to Gnarnia.

484
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:51,503
We'll show you everything we know,
like how to use...

485
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,168
the invisibility cloak.

486
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,643
Oh, no!
I'm completely invisible!

487
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:06,518
Where am I?
Who's that?

488
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,592
- Where am I? I could be anywhere.
- Harry. Harry!

489
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,661
Where am I?

490
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,665
Step off, Potter!

491
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,365
Right.
Wrong cloak.

492
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,703
Let the training montage begin!

493
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,709
Cue inspirational music.

494
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,779
Blame the cloak.

495
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,417
- Get your hips nice and square.
- Okay, uh-

496
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,043
- All right. I'll set it up for you.
- Okay.

497
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,122
- <i>You ready?</i>
- Yeah, I'm ready.

498
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,431
Ipso facto "patrolo!"

499
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,472
Oh! Yeah!

500
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,273
Confront your fear!

501
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,281
Do not cower
in the face of danger!

502
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:10,479
Let nothing stand in the way of defeating
your enemy! Come on, Peter!

503
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,953
Stop being such a little nancy boy!

504
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,617
<i>Schoolgirl! Pussy!</i>
<i>Chicken!</i>

505
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,434
Congratulations, Peter.
Your training is now complete.

506
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:39,947
- You are now ready to meet Aslo.
- Yes!

507
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:45,616
This crystal will finally
put an end to the resistance.

508
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:49,249
I will start a series of earthquakes...

509
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,260
that will collapse all of Gnarnia...

510
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,694
and grow a new continent...

511
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:58,131
where only I
and my followers will live.

512
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,936
<i>Yo, Bitch, that's pretty much</i>
<i>the plot of</i> Superman Returns.

513
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,168
Pretty much, yeah.

514
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,825
It's an I.M. from Silas.

515
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,559
<i>"The... keeds...</i>

516
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,098
"have...

517
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,226
esca-puh-duh."

518
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,897
<i>"Escap-puh-duh."</i>

519
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,998
"The keeds have esca-puh-duh."

520
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,703
The kids have escaped!

521
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,804
<i>Duh!</i>

522
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:53,017
I've got to catch and kill those children
before they ruin everything.

523
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,387
See what else Edward knows.

524
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,323
Let me out!

525
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,827
Oh, I gotta get outta here.

526
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,330
I'm never gonna see
my family again.

527
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,524
I'll get you out of here, mate.

528
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,040
Captain Morgan!
I love your rum!

529
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:17,371
No!
Captain Jack Swallows.

530
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,276
At your service.

531
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:25,287
Jack Swallows?

532
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,687
That's kinda gay, dude.

533
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,691
Mmm.

534
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:34,355
I believe in your quest, son,
and I'll reunite you with your family.

535
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:38,298
I've got a ship waiting for us.

536
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:41,394
Shh.

537
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,303
How are we gonna
get out of here?

538
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,399
Ah!

539
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,576
Man down! Man down!

540
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,651
I could have faked it!

541
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,755
Quick!
He needs your help!

542
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,532
Come, come!
We haven't got all day!

543
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:52,105
Mmm!

544
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,541
Wow!
A real pirate ship!

545
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,670
<i>Peter, Lucy and Susan</i>
<i>won't believe this.</i>

546
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,779
Hey, this is awesome.
What's it like being a pirate?

547
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:06,015
Yo-ho, Ed, let me
break it down for you.

548
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,179
Word to the Kraken!

549
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,910
Time is winding, old boy.

550
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,080
So where's your family, eh?

551
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,125
They're on their way to
the Ancient Tables to meet Aslo...

552
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,127
where he's assembled
the resistance.

553
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:55,096
Interesting.

554
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:57,223
God, you're easy.

555
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,336
Thanks, love.
Oh, my.

556
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,273
Wait. So this whole thing was a setup
just to get information out of me?

557
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,512
Sorry, mate.
This isn't even a working pirate ship. Savvy?

558
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,919
- Oh, shit!
- It was nice doin' business with you, love.

559
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,759
Bugger!

560
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:36,498
I'll get you for this...

561
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,302
you-you-

562
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,640
you... bitch.

563
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:51,619
I always hated you,
Captain Jack Swallows.

564
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,194
You think I like wearin' this
funny-lookin' hat? I'll roast your nuts!

565
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,696
So...

566
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,562
your family's going to Aslo.

567
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,728
Summon the troops.

568
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,635
<i>If it's a war they want...</i>

569
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,799
it's a war they will get.

570
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,547
Let's start things off
with a bang, shall we?

571
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,708
- But you'll kill millions.
- Billions.

572
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,813
Come on.
Let me hear you say it.

573
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,914
- My family will stop you!
- Wrong!

574
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,892
Ooh!

575
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,366
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

576
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,741
Oh! Ooh!

577
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,249
Oh! Ooh!

578
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,253
Damn that <i>Superman</i> plot!

579
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,261
My name Borat.

580
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:46,131
This my country of Gnarnia.
Is nice!

581
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:57,837
She is my sister.

582
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:01,974
She is number four faun prostitute
in all of Gnarnia.

583
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,985
Nice!

584
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,464
Aslo?

585
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,762
Mmm!

586
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,361
Where you goin', doll face?
I just took my Cialis.

587
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,441
Screw you, Aslo!

588
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,007
Ah, thanks a lot.

589
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,603
You're Aslo the Lion?

590
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:35,275
Li-man-
half lion, half man.

591
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:39,788
- So you mean you're-
- My father Siegfried boinked a lion.

592
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:44,292
But, you know,
what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

593
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:49,195
Let me guess. The prophecy family.

594
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,563
Uh-huh.
We've come a long way.

595
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,728
Whatever.
You're missing one.

596
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,739
- Yes, our brother Edward.
- Yes, our brother Edward.

597
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,168
He betrayed you,
went to the White Bitch.

598
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,042
- Well, it wasn't his fault.
- Yada yada yada.

599
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:10,484
- But the prophecy says-
- "But the prophecy, the prophecy."

600
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,919
Fine.
I'll help you get Edward back.

601
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,353
- Oh!
- Mmm!

602
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:18,553
But there's something
you've got to do for me.

603
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,794
What are you in here for, Mel?

604
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,769
You know.

605
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,206
Glug, glug.
Vroom, vroom.

606
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,539
Whoo!

607
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,443
Listen, sugar tits.
F.Y.I.

608
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:45,350
I like to sleep in the buff.

609
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,329
Wow.

610
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,628
Yeah.

611
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:03,433
- That was spectacular.
- My butt's sore.

612
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,440
Uh-oh!

613
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,942
Dutch oven!

614
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,706
<i>Ooh!</i>

615
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,986
It's Aslo!

616
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:35,429
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

617
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,443
Huh?

618
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,083
Come on, kids.

619
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:06,193
Peter? Lucy! Susan!

620
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:10,698
Oh, you guys, I've been such a prick.
Won't you ever forgive me?

621
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,734
We already have.

622
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,703
- We're a family now.
- We're a family now.

623
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:19,366
I like the sound of that.

624
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:27,245
- I love you guys.
- Oh, have your Dr. Phil moment later.

625
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,080
- Now get out of here!
- Go, go, go.

626
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,195
Good-bye, Aslo.

627
01:01:57,037 --> 01:01:58,971
What?
What's wrong?

628
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:01,597
He didn't make it.

629
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,573
Oh, shit! A talking beaver!

630
01:02:03,677 --> 01:02:05,304
Wait!

631
01:02:08,215 --> 01:02:11,150
<i>Oh, it's hard out here</i>
<i>for a beaver.</i>

632
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:14,414
You forgetful bitch!
I already met you.

633
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:17,046
I know. Yeah.

634
01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:22,789
Aslo never came back.
The White Bitch killed him.

635
01:02:22,896 --> 01:02:26,161
And it gets worse.

636
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:33,171
It's over.

637
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,168
The White Bitch
will surely rule forever.

638
01:02:37,277 --> 01:02:39,575
But we have you.
You will lead us.

639
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,170
You're the future
kings and queens of Gnarnia.

640
01:02:42,282 --> 01:02:44,978
It will be an honor
to fight for you, my lords.

641
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:47,178
We'll fight for you.

642
01:02:49,256 --> 01:02:51,156
And so will we.

643
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:54,659
We'll stand behind you, Peter.

644
01:02:54,761 --> 01:02:59,494
That bitch has threatened
our mutant way of life for too long.

645
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,931
We believe in you.

646
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:09,541
Tomorrow, we fight.

647
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:12,009
So tonight, we party!

648
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:18,210
Hello, Gnarnia!
Are you ready for rock and roll?

649
01:03:45,979 --> 01:03:48,607
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

650
01:03:48,715 --> 01:03:51,707
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

651
01:03:51,818 --> 01:03:53,979
Yeah!

652
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:55,850
Yeah!

653
01:03:55,956 --> 01:03:57,856
You're up, Sis.

654
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:01,018
Uh-uh.
I like to keep a clear head.

655
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:03,823
Come on. Loosen up for once.
You wanna-

656
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,730
You wanna, you know,
get your swerve on, like this.

657
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:11,361
Like that. And then-

658
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:15,430
No. Why?
What's the worst that could happen?

659
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:21,543
- Maybe just one.
- All right.

660
01:04:25,385 --> 01:04:27,910
- Whoo-hoo!
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

661
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,353
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

662
01:04:30,457 --> 01:04:32,687
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

663
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:51,071
Hi.

664
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:53,771
Hi.

665
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,611
So, you're gonna be
the king of Gnarnia?

666
01:04:59,185 --> 01:05:01,483
- That's what they say.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

667
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:04,921
I think that's so hot.

668
01:05:05,025 --> 01:05:09,223
Why don't we get out of here.

669
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:15,163
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

670
01:05:15,268 --> 01:05:19,170
Chug it!

671
01:05:19,272 --> 01:05:23,800
Whoo! Yeah!

672
01:05:54,107 --> 01:05:56,268
I'm okay.

673
01:05:56,376 --> 01:05:58,139
You're good?

674
01:05:59,813 --> 01:06:02,304
- Hmm?
- I'm okay.

675
01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:08,051
Oh!

676
01:06:30,176 --> 01:06:34,704
Oh.

677
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:46,550
- You know, I've got special powers.
- Uh-huh.

678
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,424
I'm a shape-changer.

679
01:06:49,529 --> 01:06:52,521
I can change my form into anything.

680
01:06:52,632 --> 01:06:54,190
What do you like?

681
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,291
Uh-

682
01:06:58,638 --> 01:07:02,096
Big hooters
with silver dollar nipples?

683
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,176
All right.

684
01:07:10,884 --> 01:07:13,910
And a ghetto booty.

685
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,046
Like- Like a lot of junk
in the trunk, say.

686
01:07:17,157 --> 01:07:21,218
Kinky. Mmm.

687
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:27,632
Badonkadonk.

688
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:30,965
- And a mono-brow!
- Come again?

689
01:07:31,071 --> 01:07:33,665
Mono-brow! Mono-brow!
King wants a mono-brow!

690
01:07:33,773 --> 01:07:35,741
Okay, okay.

691
01:07:41,514 --> 01:07:43,948
And big, flabby grandma arms.

692
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,644
Oh!

693
01:07:46,753 --> 01:07:51,053
Bingo wings,
like a fat, blue Britney Spears.

694
01:07:51,157 --> 01:07:53,921
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

695
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:58,493
Come here!

696
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:26,124
Where is everybody?

697
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:33,460
I don't know. Maybe it had something to do
with Susan puking on everyone last night.

698
01:08:34,567 --> 01:08:36,467
We seem to be outnumbered.

699
01:09:08,168 --> 01:09:10,363
No.

700
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,870
I'm not running anymore.

701
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:20,678
Ow!

702
01:09:25,485 --> 01:09:27,715
Oh!

703
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:31,348
We may not have the numbers on our side
or the weapons she possesses...

704
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:33,584
but we have something
far more powerful.

705
01:09:33,693 --> 01:09:35,558
Perky breasts?

706
01:09:38,097 --> 01:09:39,997
The strength of our family.

707
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:42,897
I'd follow you anywhere, brother.

708
01:09:52,912 --> 01:09:54,937
<i>Oh, my-</i>

709
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:02,183
Revenge is... mine!

710
01:10:02,288 --> 01:10:04,256
Jack Swallows!

711
01:10:09,863 --> 01:10:13,959
Payback is a bitch, White Bitch!

712
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:18,731
You owe me your soul,
Jack Swallows, and it's time to pay up!

713
01:10:54,507 --> 01:10:57,635
Oh!
She's blinded me, matey!

714
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,188
Oh, bugger!

715
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:12,953
What a tool.

716
01:11:16,596 --> 01:11:18,496
Show them no mercy.

717
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:11,181
Take that, Kumar!
Huh!

718
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:27,927
No!

719
01:12:37,443 --> 01:12:39,604
Oh, yes.

720
01:12:42,215 --> 01:12:45,048
Yes, that's right.
Grovel.

721
01:12:47,153 --> 01:12:51,453
Just like your parents did
before I killed them.

722
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,274
<i>Wow. Let's slow things down</i>
<i>for a better look.</i>

723
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:23,482
Ah.

724
01:13:23,589 --> 01:13:24,988
<i>Oh! Oh, dear.</i>

725
01:13:28,661 --> 01:13:33,064
Oh, that's-
That-That is dis-

726
01:13:41,541 --> 01:13:43,441
Oh.

727
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:13,500
Ooh!

728
01:14:23,883 --> 01:14:26,784
Let's get 'em!

729
01:15:15,768 --> 01:15:18,066
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

730
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,390
It's the crystal!

731
01:15:43,496 --> 01:15:46,260
- We're all gonna die!
- We're all gonna die!

732
01:15:47,567 --> 01:15:50,400
Give me the remote control.

733
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:59,469
Yes!

734
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:10,054
No, stop.
We will not stoop to her level.

735
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,715
I hate those fuckin' kids.

736
01:16:13,826 --> 01:16:16,693
The new Gnarnia
will be a democracy...

737
01:16:16,796 --> 01:16:19,356
complete with due process.

738
01:16:19,465 --> 01:16:23,629
She shall be given a fair trial,
judged by a jury of her peers.

739
01:16:23,736 --> 01:16:27,331
<i>Sorry, Bitch.</i>

740
01:16:29,709 --> 01:16:32,610
Right.

741
01:16:32,712 --> 01:16:34,976
Oh, screw her anyway.

742
01:16:36,849 --> 01:16:39,511
Make a beaver a hole.
Get your butt out of my face.

743
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:41,951
<i>Hot, moist beaver comin' through.</i>

744
01:16:42,054 --> 01:16:45,148
May I present
the kings and queens of Gnarnia!

745
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:48,694
Peter the Heroic.

746
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:51,422
<i>Susan the Just.</i>

747
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:54,090
<i>Edward the Loyal.</i>

748
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,432
<i>And Lucy the Dumb Shit.</i>

749
01:16:58,537 --> 01:17:00,505
All hail!

750
01:17:30,736 --> 01:17:34,866
<i>And so it was</i>
<i>that Peter, Susan, Edward and Lucy...</i>

751
01:17:34,974 --> 01:17:37,841
<i>restored peace to Gnarnia.</i>

752
01:17:37,943 --> 01:17:42,937
<i>They were orphans no more.</i>
<i>They were now a family.</i>

753
01:17:44,216 --> 01:17:48,152
<i>They ruled Gnarnia</i>
<i>for many years to come.</i>

754
01:17:48,254 --> 01:17:51,746
<i>That is, until they found</i>
<i>the wardrobe once again.</i>

755
01:17:51,857 --> 01:17:53,757
Let's cross streams.

756
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:04,501
There we go.

757
01:18:04,603 --> 01:18:06,867
Oops!
A little bit of blood.

758
01:18:19,285 --> 01:18:21,185
It's-

759
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:28,626
- It's the wardrobe.
- It's been so long.

760
01:18:28,728 --> 01:18:30,889
It's been so long.

761
01:18:32,131 --> 01:18:35,100
Chuck Norris rules.

762
01:19:15,508 --> 01:19:17,976
We're young again!

763
01:19:19,745 --> 01:19:22,179
Jagshemash!

764
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:26,741
You did it!
You make movie film have happy ending.

765
01:19:29,355 --> 01:19:30,982
Not!

766
01:21:02,848 --> 01:21:04,782
Oh, my-

767
01:21:09,154 --> 01:21:12,555
- <i>Let us out, freak!</i>
- No can do.

768
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:14,717
I-

769
01:21:17,897 --> 01:21:23,733
No.
Captain Jack <i>Swallows</i>!

770
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:27,795
Captain Jack <i>Swallows</i>!

771
01:21:27,907 --> 01:21:30,705
- Shit. Swallowing!
- <i>Cut.</i>

772
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:34,768
No!
Captain Jack <i>Swallows</i>!

773
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,644
Sorry.

774
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:41,550
Wait. Can I ask you
something about the sucking?

775
01:21:41,654 --> 01:21:43,884
Am I-

776
01:21:43,989 --> 01:21:46,514
Am I, like, sucking the chrome off,
or is it-

777
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,525
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I mean- Okay.

778
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,788
<i>Here we go.</i>

779
01:21:53,465 --> 01:21:56,457
Oh! Hey!

780
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:59,538
Mmm. Mmm!

781
01:21:59,638 --> 01:22:02,664
Well, guess what.

782
01:22:02,775 --> 01:22:05,141
- <i>What?</i>
- Guess what.

783
01:22:05,244 --> 01:22:08,509
First-

784
01:22:08,614 --> 01:22:10,980
Mi, mi, mi, mi,
mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi!

785
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:14,450
When I'm makin' you stuff,
quit cryin' and eat it!

786
01:22:14,553 --> 01:22:17,647
Your mother ate it!
She liked it. It was <i>fine</i>.

787
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:33,001
- Where did I hit him? I hit him on the head.
- <i>Cut!</i>

788
01:22:39,578 --> 01:22:41,546
Shit.

789
01:22:46,452 --> 01:22:49,080
We'll stand behind you, Peter.

790
01:22:49,188 --> 01:22:51,884
That bitch has threatened
our way of life-

791
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:55,017
Our mutant-
Shit. Sorry. Bollocks.

792
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:57,459
She shall be given a fair trial...

793
01:22:57,563 --> 01:23:00,794
judged by a jury of her peers.

794
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:03,333
We shall build a courthouse...

795
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:06,802
with crushed velvet drapes
and ample parking.

796
01:23:08,407 --> 01:23:10,375
I'm so hot.

797
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,807
Oh, my gosh. I passed the yellow line.
I just don't see it.

798
01:23:16,915 --> 01:23:21,682
Li-man-
half lion, half man.

799
01:23:21,787 --> 01:23:23,687
<i>So you mean you're-</i>

800
01:23:23,789 --> 01:23:25,814
My mom went to a party
at Siegfried and Roy's.

801
01:23:25,924 --> 01:23:29,485
She got drunk, and then
it was her turn in the barrel.

802
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:31,495
It's a brutal game.

803
01:23:31,597 --> 01:23:34,566
Justice shall reign supreme...

804
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:38,433
even for elves and fauns...

805
01:23:38,537 --> 01:23:41,995
albinos and the Irish.

806
01:23:49,948 --> 01:23:53,543
- I saw stripes!
- No! Man!

807
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:57,110
We shall revolutionize
the health system.

808
01:23:57,222 --> 01:23:59,588
There will be no more
teenage pregnancies...

809
01:23:59,692 --> 01:24:02,058
without my consent...

810
01:24:02,161 --> 01:24:04,095
and without their consent.

811
01:24:04,196 --> 01:24:07,256
I shouldn't have had sex with Shrek!

812
01:24:07,366 --> 01:24:11,826
Like it or not, we're all in-

813
01:24:11,937 --> 01:24:15,100
- You okay?
- No. But go ahead.

814
01:24:15,207 --> 01:24:18,108
- Like it or not, we're all in this.
- Like it or not-

815
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,110
- Oh, I can't even do it now.
- Let's do it.

816
01:24:20,212 --> 01:24:24,239
Damn that Shrek!
He said he wasn't a carrier.

817
01:24:24,349 --> 01:24:28,547
Because, sweet tits,
we're four kids nobody would ever miss.

818
01:24:28,654 --> 01:24:30,952
We'll be stuck here
till we dizz-i rizz-i.

819
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,994
Don't t-zelle me what to d-zoo!

820
01:24:37,096 --> 01:24:39,621
The White Bitch is no more.

821
01:24:39,732 --> 01:24:41,666
Now, we shall be queens.

822
01:24:41,767 --> 01:24:47,637
Last night, I had sex
with a unicorn. Nice!

823
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:52,507
Hey, look.
It's Lindsay Lohan.

824
01:24:52,611 --> 01:24:54,670
I haven't got
enough left for Roseanne.

825
01:25:02,888 --> 01:25:05,152
- Oh. So I was supposed to- I supposed to fall?
- <i>Cut it.</i>

826
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:07,157
- It's supposed to hit me, right?
- <i>Yes.</i>

827
01:25:08,594 --> 01:25:11,654
- Ooh!
- <i>Cut!</i>

828
01:25:11,764 --> 01:25:15,996
Oh. But I need something
about the others first.

829
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:18,626
But first- Sorry.
Give me your hand.

830
01:25:20,205 --> 01:25:22,639
Oh, no!

831
01:25:22,741 --> 01:25:26,973
But kings need to boss
their subject's ship-What's the line?

832
01:25:27,079 --> 01:25:29,445
Yes.

833
01:25:29,548 --> 01:25:35,487
Bring me the others, and I'll crown you
the throne. Shit. Crown you what?

834
01:25:43,428 --> 01:25:46,226
I'm big.
I got big balls.

835
01:25:46,331 --> 01:25:48,595
See <i>Epic Movie</i>...

836
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:52,796
or drunk Mel Gibson will hurt me.

837
01:25:52,905 --> 01:25:54,873
Not!

838
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,803
you.

839
01:26:02,314 --> 01:26:04,714
So now you all seen my crib.

840
01:26:04,817 --> 01:26:07,047
So get the hell out- Oh!
