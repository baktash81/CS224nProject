00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,383
Daddy, do you know what l saw?

3
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,895
lt was the most fantastic thing.
Come look.

4
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,898
My son.

5
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,059
Look, son,
l'm really busy...

6
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:32,661
but l'll tell you
what l do need.

7
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,899
l need some good luck.

8
00:08:45,457 --> 00:08:50,053
Okay, Mr. Lucky,
it's time we divvy up the loot.

9
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,793
Look at all of these things.
What a night.

10
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:59,733
What do you think of this?
This is pretty. l'll take those.

11
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,171
Try that.
lsn't that pretty?

12
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,039
l better keep that.
That's pretty nice.

13
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,908
l think l better take that.
You shouldn't have that.

14
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,244
l better take that.
You're too young for that.

15
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:15,684
Look at that watch.

16
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,689
l'll take that.
That's a pretty watch.

17
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,959
lt's time l got myself another knife.
So l oughta give you this.

18
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:30,335
You never know when a knife
might come in handy.

19
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,367
You want some gold?
There's lots of gold.

20
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:48,209
You know, l'll bet this is
the most valuable piece here.

21
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:52,416
lt's Bucephalus, the magic horse
of Alexander the Great.

22
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,824
A long time ago, this king
was gonna kill Bucephalus...

23
00:09:56,894 --> 00:10:00,125
because he was so wild
the king couldn't ride him.

24
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:03,932
He had Bucephalus brought
into a big arena.

25
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:07,300
People came from all around.

26
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:10,398
They wanted to see this horse
that was the biggest...

27
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:15,003
and the blackest and the strongest,
most beautiful horse that ever was.

28
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,913
King Philip walked out there
and looked at some of his men.

29
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:21,747
He said, 'Kill that horse.'

30
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,084
Just then a voice called out
from the edge of the crowd.

31
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,750
lt said, 'l can ride that horse.'

32
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:32,592
Everybody said, 'Who said that?'

33
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:38,499
lt was a little kid, just about
your size, just about your age.

34
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:40,935
King Philip said...

35
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:46,773
'Son, if you can ride that horse,
you can have that horse.'

36
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,547
So Alexander walked out
into the big arena.

37
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:56,713
Standing in the middle of the arena
was Bucephalus.

38
00:10:56,788 --> 00:10:59,848
He was big, and he was strong.

39
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:04,161
He was pawing the ground...

40
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,890
and there was fire in his eyes...

41
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,558
and there was smoke
coming out of his nose.

42
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,295
He went--

43
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,733
Alexander walked up...

44
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,070
then quick as a cat,
he jumped up on his back.

45
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:20,406
He grabbed hold
of that long, black mane...

46
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,173
and away they went,
like lightning.

47
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,738
He jumped right over the crowd,
over the stand...

48
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,411
and went ridin' out
over the hill.

49
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:32,088
Everybody said, 'Whew!'

50
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,724
Smoke comin' out of his nose!

51
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,425
Fire in his eyes.

52
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,262
Fire in his eyes!

53
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:45,393
That's the way l heard the story.

54
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:50,337
Here. l want you
to have this.

55
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,906
Bucephalus.

56
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,315
Dad, what's going on?

57
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,378
- Ow!
- Alec!

58
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,852
- Alec, come here!

59
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:18,191
Just take it easy.
We'll be okay.

60
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:21,257
- What's happening?
- l don't know. Put this on.

61
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:24,062
Help me with this. Here.
Come here, son.

62
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:25,796
Put this life vest on.

63
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,031
lt's okay.
Tie the bottom.

64
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:39,749
Let's get outta here!

65
00:14:09,447 --> 00:14:13,543
Hang onto that rail!
Stay right there!

66
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,381
l'll be back!

67
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:25,026
Stay there! l'm gonna help these guys!
Don't move! Hang on!

68
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,018
- Help!
- Hey, Alec!

69
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,660
Dad!

70
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:42,171
Help!

71
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,136
Dad!

72
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,616
Help!

73
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,377
Help!

74
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,853
Help!

75
00:47:23,202 --> 00:47:26,035
He saved my life.

76
00:47:26,105 --> 00:47:28,505
l can't leave the island
without him.

77
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:32,203
- He'll die without me.

78
00:47:48,828 --> 00:47:50,489
Stop!

79
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,016
Let me go!

80
00:48:17,724 --> 00:48:19,021
Black!

81
00:48:23,796 --> 00:48:26,094
Black, come on!

82
00:48:40,346 --> 00:48:41,904
Black!

83
00:49:56,355 --> 00:49:59,381
'Ode to Alec Ramsey.'

84
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:02,223
'l think that l shall never see...

85
00:50:02,295 --> 00:50:07,323
a boy as brave as Alec Ramsey.

86
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,961
Hunger and thirst,
in fear and pain.

87
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:13,699
He lived because
his heart had aim.

88
00:50:13,773 --> 00:50:17,334
A horse
as black as night to day...

89
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,072
a beast, a god...

90
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:23,479
with whom he did stay.

91
00:50:23,549 --> 00:50:26,746
They slept on the sand
and played in the ocean.

92
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:30,755
And rode over the island
in a singular motion.

93
00:50:30,823 --> 00:50:34,919
Now, here he sits,
a hero among boys...

94
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:40,762
with the love of a horse,
much more than mere toys.'

95
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:22,893
l'm very happy
to have my son back.

96
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:29,292
Thank you. l wish you could have
saved his father too.

97
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:42,746
You're kind of a pretty horse.

98
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:21,943
- What--

99
00:54:30,662 --> 00:54:32,095
Black, no!

100
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:46,503
No!

101
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:50,347
Black, come back!

102
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:58,186
Alec!

103
00:55:33,325 --> 00:55:35,190
Wow!

104
00:55:37,028 --> 00:55:39,724
Yes, l saw a black horse!
lt ran thataway!

105
00:57:31,443 --> 00:57:32,876
Whoa.

106
00:57:38,183 --> 00:57:40,549
What happened to you?

107
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:45,884
- Everything.
- Everything?

108
00:57:45,957 --> 00:57:47,948
That's a whole lot.

109
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:49,960
Can't be everything.

110
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:59,566
You lost a black horse.

111
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,407
Yeah. Have you seen him?

112
00:58:05,477 --> 00:58:08,412
Do you know where he is?

113
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:13,243
- Napoleon...

114
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:16,446
did you tell me
you saw a black stallion?

115
00:58:27,198 --> 00:58:29,666
Well, what did he say?

116
00:58:31,336 --> 00:58:34,601
He says,
'Well, not very far from here.'

117
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:39,274
Just past the dairy...

118
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:42,871
there's a big black barn.

119
00:58:42,947 --> 00:58:46,280
Then you see a long bunch
of skinny trees...

120
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:47,875
that you walk around.

121
00:58:47,952 --> 00:58:52,616
Then you go right by a morning star.

122
00:58:52,638 --> 00:58:55,106
You keep following that star...

123
00:58:55,174 --> 00:58:59,110
and see a large patch
of green grass.

124
00:58:59,178 --> 00:59:00,645
Then you stop.

125
00:59:00,713 --> 00:59:02,704
Then you listen.

126
00:59:02,782 --> 00:59:06,809
Pretty soon you'll see
just what you've been looking for.

127
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:31,809
Hey, Black!

128
00:59:55,768 --> 00:59:57,065
Black?

129
01:00:58,064 --> 01:00:59,156
Black!

130
01:01:02,502 --> 01:01:04,993
Black, it's you!

131
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:14,244
You okay?
l knew it was you.

132
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,625
What do you think
you're doin' over there, sonny?

133
01:01:35,702 --> 01:01:38,796
l'm gettin' my horse!

134
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:50,713
You're a big, fat thief!

135
01:01:52,952 --> 01:01:55,011
- Nobody's a thief.
- You are!

136
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:57,522
l said, 'Nobody's a thief.'

137
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:02,822
Who do you think you're callin' a thief?
This is my place.

138
01:02:02,895 --> 01:02:04,863
l'm thinkin' that's my horse.

139
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:08,230
No, he's mine!

140
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:12,135
Hold on, son.
Wait a minute.

141
01:02:15,308 --> 01:02:18,072
- What are you gonna do here, buddy?

142
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:22,080
What are you gonna do?

143
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,123
Easy.

144
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:49,202
Maybe he is yours...

145
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:53,837
but l spent all last night tryin'
to catch this wild horse.

146
01:02:53,913 --> 01:02:55,847
All night l spent.

147
01:03:02,021 --> 01:03:05,149
You're just lucky l got him
instead of the police.

148
01:03:05,224 --> 01:03:06,657
Hear me?

149
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:14,625
He kicked a garbageman?

150
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:18,128
He's somethin', all right.

151
01:03:18,204 --> 01:03:20,138
Did you have any breakfast?

152
01:03:34,454 --> 01:03:38,015
Henry, l think
he likes it out here.

153
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:54,637
Tried cows. lt didn't work.

154
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:59,344
5:00 in the morning.

155
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:00,674
Chickens--

156
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:06,715
They just about drove me nuts.
Chickens.

157
01:04:06,786 --> 01:04:12,656
Look, if you clean this stall up
in here real good...

158
01:04:12,725 --> 01:04:16,286
and you get it fit for him,
l could let you have it.

159
01:07:48,808 --> 01:07:51,834
There are too many red cards.

160
01:07:59,852 --> 01:08:02,446
ls The Black fast?

161
01:08:02,521 --> 01:08:04,455
He's fast.

162
01:08:05,992 --> 01:08:08,358
Fast enough
to be a racehorse?

163
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:14,028
That Black is a desert horse.

164
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,432
He's fast, all right.
Sure, he's fast.

165
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:20,336
But he hasn't got any papers.

166
01:08:20,406 --> 01:08:23,341
Fast or not, l don't think
they'd ever let him run.

167
01:08:26,445 --> 01:08:29,209
Can l ask you a question?

168
01:08:29,281 --> 01:08:31,010
Sure.

169
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:34,109
Why did you stop training?

170
01:08:40,292 --> 01:08:42,226
l got tired.

171
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,603
Do you think you'll ever
try it again?

172
01:09:04,683 --> 01:09:06,150
Sure, l do.

173
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:09,818
Sure.

174
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,463
lt's work.

175
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:23,294
Worth it, though.

176
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,236
Hold onto him good, son.
Stay in the center of him.

177
01:09:30,309 --> 01:09:32,470
Turn him around the other way.

178
01:09:32,545 --> 01:09:36,140
The other way, son.
Bring him in and turn him around.

179
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:38,376
Now send him down around here.

180
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:44,106
lt comes as no surprise
that again this week...

181
01:10:44,183 --> 01:10:47,175
both Sunraider,
the fiery red stallion from the West...

182
01:10:47,253 --> 01:10:49,551
and Cyclone,
the sleek gray from the East...

183
01:10:49,622 --> 01:10:51,817
have won their races with ease.

184
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:55,223
They have won
with monotonous regularity.

185
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:59,560
But, hey-hey,
let's see these two champions...

186
01:10:59,632 --> 01:11:01,395
run head-to-head.

187
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:04,959
Perhaps horse fans will be treated
to the match race of the century.

188
01:11:05,037 --> 01:11:09,565
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville,
from Belmont.

189
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,073
Lookin' this way.
Not lookin' down on the ground.

190
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:17,911
Lookin' straight ahead.
That's right.

191
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:22,951
You want to see what's comin',
you look underneath your arm.

192
01:11:24,056 --> 01:11:26,581
Not over your shoulder.
Down under here.

193
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:31,255
ln here. See what's going on
down there, all around you.

194
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:34,163
You can scoot and boot,
understand?

195
01:11:34,233 --> 01:11:37,259
Then you've got your balance.

196
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:42,766
Keep your knees in close
when you're puttin' your stirrups on.

197
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:47,710
Check down underneath here too.
Get that leather outta your way.

198
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:51,147
Pull it back in there underneath
so that your knees--

199
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:54,049
Nothin' in the way in here.
All right.

200
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:58,055
Now you're up. Feel that?
Feel that in your legs?

201
01:11:58,123 --> 01:12:01,559
Hmm? Feel it pullin'
on your legs back here?

202
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:03,060
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

203
01:12:03,128 --> 01:12:06,222
Look ahead down the lane.

204
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:08,823
No, you don't jump
straight up and down.

205
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:11,392
Just try and keep your body
as still as possible.

206
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:15,167
He'll be movin'.
He'll be makin' that rhythm.

207
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,233
You just go on with him.
You don't have to pump him.

208
01:12:19,311 --> 01:12:22,747
Just kind of go
straight ahead with him.

209
01:12:22,815 --> 01:12:25,909
Just like you're throwing it away,
like this.

210
01:12:25,984 --> 01:12:29,044
Throw it away.
That's right.

211
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:30,816
Throw it away.
That's right.

212
01:12:32,157 --> 01:12:35,752
When a horse starts outta that gate,
you've got to remember this.

213
01:12:35,828 --> 01:12:39,696
Remember, you don't want him
to outbreak you.

214
01:12:39,765 --> 01:12:42,097
You know what that means?
That horse starts to settle--

215
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:45,762
They open that gate, wham, like that.

216
01:12:45,838 --> 01:12:48,363
Some of 'em just scat!

217
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,670
You can't do that,
so you grab a handful of mane...

218
01:12:50,743 --> 01:12:53,541
just before he says, 'Go,'
so he don't outbreak you.

219
01:12:53,612 --> 01:12:58,208
Because they'd open that gate,
and you'd just be sittin' in midair.

220
01:12:58,283 --> 01:13:00,547
You understand?

221
01:13:00,619 --> 01:13:03,213
- This Black can outbreak you.
- Right.

222
01:13:03,288 --> 01:13:05,415
He can move right on out there.

223
01:14:25,604 --> 01:14:27,799
You know, Alec...

224
01:14:29,308 --> 01:14:30,741
'secrecy.'

225
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:34,073
That's the key word.

226
01:14:36,081 --> 01:14:37,844
Yeah. Okay.

227
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:40,407
Don't just say, 'Okay.'
Know what l'm talking about.

228
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:45,583
lt's a secret.
You and me, we have a secret.

229
01:15:07,646 --> 01:15:11,047
Now, listen to me.
We'll just make this an easy workout.

230
01:15:11,116 --> 01:15:12,549
- You understand?
- All right.

231
01:15:12,618 --> 01:15:16,554
Get him used to this place.
Jake and l will be here with Napoleon.

232
01:15:16,622 --> 01:15:19,716
You go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me.

233
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:21,816
l'll give you the start
by dropping my hand.

234
01:15:21,894 --> 01:15:25,386
Then l want you to work him
for a half mile.

235
01:15:25,464 --> 01:15:27,898
l want to you to breeze him
for a half mile...

236
01:15:27,966 --> 01:15:29,558
then pull him up, nice and easy.

237
01:15:29,635 --> 01:15:32,832
Go down to the half-mile pole
and watch me.

238
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,511
Come on! Let's go!

239
01:16:45,308 --> 01:16:47,469
Too much horse for your boy.

240
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:03,323
Jake, he's gonna be all right.

241
01:17:15,605 --> 01:17:18,199
Hyah. Come on, Nappy.
Let's go.

242
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,618
- Whoa.

243
01:17:46,169 --> 01:17:50,105
Come on! Giddap! Go on, get him!

244
01:17:50,173 --> 01:17:52,641
Pull him up!

245
01:17:53,743 --> 01:17:56,837
Pull him up, Nappy!
On the inside!

246
01:18:02,385 --> 01:18:04,012
Come on, Jake.

247
01:18:12,428 --> 01:18:16,194
Hey, your hand's-- You all right?

248
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:18,063
l'm okay.

249
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,365
l better walk him now.

250
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:24,372
All right, go ahead.
Cool him out, son.

251
01:18:31,781 --> 01:18:34,045
Did you get what l got?

252
01:18:36,452 --> 01:18:39,216
Right on the button.

253
01:18:40,957 --> 01:18:45,394
That horse has got speed
he ain't even tapped yet.

254
01:18:50,233 --> 01:18:51,825
You're not--

255
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:57,339
You're not actually--
You're not.

256
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:59,398
You are outta your mind.

257
01:18:59,475 --> 01:19:03,673
That monster has no more business
being out on this track with class--

258
01:19:03,746 --> 01:19:05,680
He's fast, but he's wild.

259
01:19:05,748 --> 01:19:08,342
You saw him zigzagging
all over the course.

260
01:19:10,753 --> 01:19:13,017
What about his papers?

261
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:20,384
- He ain't got any.
- He ain't?

262
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:22,693
That's taste.

263
01:19:22,765 --> 01:19:26,257
What are you gonna do?
Hitch him up to a plow?

264
01:19:26,336 --> 01:19:27,598
No.

265
01:19:30,106 --> 01:19:31,573
l got an idea.

266
01:19:38,281 --> 01:19:40,044
A match race?

267
01:19:40,116 --> 01:19:42,209
Cyclone?

268
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:44,719
You are too much.

269
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:47,381
You are really too much.

270
01:19:47,457 --> 01:19:50,392
You got me thinking crazy too.

271
01:21:11,874 --> 01:21:14,604
Squeeze my hand.
l want to try something here.

272
01:21:14,677 --> 01:21:16,736
You feel that?
That's a pretty good grip.

273
01:21:16,813 --> 01:21:21,079
That's not bad, but we're gonna
have to work on your grip.

274
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:25,086
What l used when l was a rider
was this ball. See how--

275
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:27,748
- What does a ball do?
- lt strengthens your band.

276
01:21:27,824 --> 01:21:32,261
No matter what you're doin'
through the day, just use this ball.

277
01:21:32,328 --> 01:21:36,856
Let me see you do it. Next time you
grip my hand, we'll see a difference.

278
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:40,334
This reporter has
the hottest racing news of the year.

279
01:21:40,403 --> 01:21:41,836
Hold onto your hats.

280
01:21:41,904 --> 01:21:44,270
The most sensational
match race imaginable...

281
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,503
between Cyclone from the East
and Sunraider from the West...

282
01:21:47,577 --> 01:21:50,705
is finally set for the afternoon
of August 15 at Santa Anita.

283
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:53,772
They'll go over two gruelling miles
to prove once and for all...

284
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,045
which is really
the greatest champion.

285
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:59,782
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville
from Belmont.

286
01:22:22,378 --> 01:22:26,246
Well, whoever you are...

287
01:22:26,315 --> 01:22:28,249
here we go.

288
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:10,691
lt's open.

289
01:23:26,275 --> 01:23:29,438
Sure is quiet in here today.

290
01:23:29,512 --> 01:23:31,571
Anything wrong with that?

291
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:35,083
The Black, he--

292
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:40,085
He just wouldn't play.

293
01:23:40,156 --> 01:23:44,923
He just stands there
and looks out into the rain.

294
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:49,525
Maybe The Black is blue today.

295
01:23:49,599 --> 01:23:52,067
- Did you ever think of that?
- 'Blue'?

296
01:23:52,134 --> 01:23:55,467
Rain, man, rain.

297
01:23:55,538 --> 01:23:56,835
Rain.

298
01:24:01,444 --> 01:24:05,380
We're gonna show everybody that he's
the fastest horse in the world.

299
01:24:09,118 --> 01:24:11,382
You think you know that animal?

300
01:24:11,454 --> 01:24:13,388
Yeah, l know him.

301
01:24:16,626 --> 01:24:18,321
l don't know.

302
01:24:23,132 --> 01:24:25,191
l get a funny feeling.

303
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:32,974
l feel right now that you better
let that horse stay wild, Alec.

304
01:24:37,313 --> 01:24:39,406
lt's his soul.

305
01:25:02,437 --> 01:25:05,235
Easy, Black.

306
01:25:43,645 --> 01:25:46,910
- He ain't gonna show.
- l don't wanna hear that.

307
01:25:46,982 --> 01:25:50,440
He'll show. He'll be here.

308
01:25:55,357 --> 01:25:58,019
He probably doesn't even remember us.

309
01:25:58,093 --> 01:26:02,689
- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.

310
01:26:02,764 --> 01:26:05,858
l tell you, he's gonna be here.
He's busy.

311
01:26:05,934 --> 01:26:07,458
He's a little jumpy.

312
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,204
Come on. We'll work him.
Get him out there.

313
01:26:24,219 --> 01:26:25,447
Henry!

314
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,387
- You okay?
- Where'd he get you?

315
01:26:28,457 --> 01:26:31,221
- On my arm.
- Here?

316
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:33,454
- ls it broken?
- Leave it alone!

317
01:26:33,528 --> 01:26:35,462
lt's all right.
He just nicked me.

318
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:37,896
Will you please stop?

319
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:40,901
All right. What?

320
01:26:44,206 --> 01:26:45,639
lt's him.

321
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:53,510
- lt's him.
- No.

322
01:26:53,582 --> 01:26:58,019
lt's him, by God.
l tell you, it's him.

323
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:05,025
lt is him.

324
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:13,568
Yeah. All right. lt's him.

325
01:27:20,442 --> 01:27:24,378
All right. Give him a leg up there.

326
01:27:27,582 --> 01:27:30,050
Remember, this is our big chance.

327
01:27:30,118 --> 01:27:32,279
lt's up to you.

328
01:27:32,354 --> 01:27:34,379
Take him out.

329
01:28:09,257 --> 01:28:11,157
Come on! Bring him on!

330
01:29:30,839 --> 01:29:33,569
Hey! He's out cold.

331
01:29:33,642 --> 01:29:36,008
He passed out.

332
01:29:37,412 --> 01:29:41,041
Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady.

333
01:29:41,116 --> 01:29:42,879
- Got him.
- Give me your knife.

334
01:29:42,951 --> 01:29:46,887
- All right.
- Watch it. Hold him steady.

335
01:29:46,955 --> 01:29:48,547
Whoa, sonny.

336
01:29:48,623 --> 01:29:52,059
Here.

337
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:09,477
- Where'd you get this animal?
- Get him off.

338
01:30:09,544 --> 01:30:12,377
Good boy.

339
01:30:12,447 --> 01:30:14,881
- Get him outta here.
- l got him.

340
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,578
Watch yourself.
Watch it, sir.

341
01:30:17,652 --> 01:30:20,246
Whoa, boy.

342
01:30:47,282 --> 01:30:49,876
What happened?
Did l fall off?

343
01:30:51,219 --> 01:30:52,516
No.

344
01:30:52,587 --> 01:30:56,387
No, you hung on like a champ.

345
01:31:07,302 --> 01:31:09,998
What happened?
Where's The Black?

346
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:12,733
lt's all right.
Don't worry about it. lt's fine.

347
01:31:12,807 --> 01:31:15,105
He's over in the van with Nappy.

348
01:31:21,983 --> 01:31:25,077
He did good, didn't he?

349
01:31:25,153 --> 01:31:26,620
He did great.

350
01:31:26,688 --> 01:31:28,622
You did great.

351
01:31:31,793 --> 01:31:33,761
You all right?

352
01:31:44,339 --> 01:31:48,503
- How did you like what you saw?
- l wasn't disappointed.

353
01:31:49,277 --> 01:31:51,211
Disappointed?

354
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:54,874
You never saw a horse
run like that in your life.

355
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:57,008
This could put you back
in the action, eh, Dailey?

356
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:03,182
Don't get hard with me.
You know l never liked it.

357
01:32:03,258 --> 01:32:04,691
l need this race.

358
01:32:05,927 --> 01:32:08,395
l need it bad,
and you can do it.

359
01:32:11,466 --> 01:32:13,934
Will you do it?

360
01:32:14,002 --> 01:32:16,061
lf that horse goes like that
with a kid...

361
01:32:16,137 --> 01:32:19,698
- what will he do with a real rider?
- The race.

362
01:32:20,809 --> 01:32:22,470
Nice going, kid.
You got guts.

363
01:32:36,691 --> 01:32:38,852
You heard me say
that Cyclone and Sunraider...

364
01:32:38,927 --> 01:32:40,918
are the fastest horses
in the world today.

365
01:32:40,995 --> 01:32:44,487
l'm going to eat those words now
because l've seen another horse...

366
01:32:44,566 --> 01:32:47,364
that defies the imagination,
that runs like a demon possessed...

367
01:32:47,435 --> 01:32:50,029
at night, alone,
at speeds beyond belief.

368
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:52,539
He's never run a race,
and he comes out of nowhere...

369
01:32:52,607 --> 01:32:56,043
but he could be the greatest
sensation in racing history.

370
01:32:56,111 --> 01:32:58,477
So l challenge the owners
of both Cyclone...

371
01:32:58,546 --> 01:33:03,711
and Sunraider to meet this mystery horse
in their upcoming match race.

372
01:33:03,785 --> 01:33:05,446
This isn't a joke.

373
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,887
This mystery horse is real,
and l'll stake my reputation on it.

374
01:33:08,957 --> 01:33:12,393
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville
from Belmont.

375
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:21,667
Do you know any
real good, famous jockeys?

376
01:33:21,736 --> 01:33:26,070
There are a lot of 'em.
George Wolf, the lceman.

377
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:29,736
That's just what they call him.
Georgie Wolf.

378
01:33:29,811 --> 01:33:32,245
They call him in the newspapers
the lceman...

379
01:33:32,313 --> 01:33:35,077
because he sits chilly
on a horse.

380
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,243
That means he sits there
and he can wait.

381
01:33:37,318 --> 01:33:39,582
He knows what to do.
He's studying a horse.

382
01:33:39,654 --> 01:33:43,920
He's up there ridin',
goin' on with him.

383
01:33:43,992 --> 01:33:46,586
You know what l mean?
He's sittin' up there, goin' on...

384
01:33:46,661 --> 01:33:48,686
just studyin' him!

385
01:33:48,763 --> 01:33:52,529
Studyin' him.
Just studyin' him.

386
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,034
When it's time to make his move...

387
01:33:55,103 --> 01:33:57,867
he'll say--

388
01:33:57,939 --> 01:34:00,509
Here comes the lceman!

389
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:21,795
Mom, do you want me
to mow the lawn...

390
01:34:21,863 --> 01:34:24,388
or wash the dishes
or something?

391
01:34:28,603 --> 01:34:30,036
Sure.

392
01:34:30,105 --> 01:34:34,565
Why don't you make all the beds
and vacuum in here too?

393
01:34:57,599 --> 01:35:01,000
- Mom, have you read this here? See?
- What is it?

394
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:07,139
This is more about that mystery horse.

395
01:35:08,209 --> 01:35:09,642
Boy.

396
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:20,719
Remember last year when they were
giving away aluminum ballpoint pens?

397
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:23,314
- The Black is the mystery horse.
- lt's amazing the lengths...

398
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:28,385
they will go to get people
to go to a horse race.

399
01:35:28,463 --> 01:35:30,624
And l'm gonna ride him.

400
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:32,758
- l'll get it!

401
01:35:32,834 --> 01:35:35,302
What did you say? Wait!

402
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:39,739
Alec, wait one more second.
What did you say? Say that again.

403
01:35:39,808 --> 01:35:42,743
The Black is the mystery horse,
and l'm gonna ride him.

404
01:35:42,811 --> 01:35:45,644
Alec, that horse
is not the mystery horse.

405
01:35:45,714 --> 01:35:48,774
Even if he were,
you're not gonna ride him.

406
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:51,444
lt was a secret.
l told you as soon as l could.

407
01:35:51,519 --> 01:35:54,682
You're not supposed to keep
secrets from your mother.

408
01:35:57,092 --> 01:36:00,027
- Someone's at the door.
- l know!

409
01:36:02,097 --> 01:36:05,032
- Mrs. Ramsey, how--
- Oh.

410
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:09,764
The Black is the mystery horse,
and you're gonna ride him in a race.

411
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:18,541
All right. Well, well, well.

412
01:36:18,613 --> 01:36:21,207
lsn't this just fascinating timing?

413
01:36:21,282 --> 01:36:24,046
What's been going on
between you two guys and that horse?

414
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:27,555
- l have a right to know.
- Guess you've been talking to Alec.

415
01:36:27,622 --> 01:36:32,059
l have been trying to. Would you like
to tell me something about this?

416
01:36:32,127 --> 01:36:35,062
- l'd be happy to.
- Come in, please.

417
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:40,898
lt's quite a long story,
Mrs. Ramsey.

418
01:36:41,970 --> 01:36:44,404
l'm sure it's a long story.

419
01:36:44,472 --> 01:36:47,441
But you've got to be kidding,
thinking l'll let him ride in a race.

420
01:36:47,509 --> 01:36:50,672
My son could get killed
in a horse race.

421
01:36:50,745 --> 01:36:53,680
l think you
could be exaggerating.

422
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:57,013
l'm not exaggerating.
Don't lie to me, Mr. Dailey.

423
01:36:57,085 --> 01:37:01,021
You're willing to risk his life?
l'm not willing to risk his life.

424
01:37:01,089 --> 01:37:04,525
l've lost a husband,
and l'm not gonna lose a son.

425
01:37:04,592 --> 01:37:09,859
l wouldn't hurt that boy
for anything in the world.

426
01:37:09,931 --> 01:37:13,867
What kind of dreams
are you filling his head with?

427
01:37:13,935 --> 01:37:18,531
lt's much more than just a race.

428
01:37:18,606 --> 01:37:22,372
Your son has his heart set on it.

429
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:28,044
Good-bye, Mr. Dailey.

430
01:37:28,116 --> 01:37:30,050
Good-bye, Mrs. Ramsey.

431
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:52,836
So what happened to the new deal,
the clean slate?

432
01:37:57,078 --> 01:38:01,515
Alec, l can't let you
ride in that horse race.

433
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,517
lt's ridiculous.

434
01:38:07,455 --> 01:38:08,888
l'm sorry.

435
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,237
What is that?

436
01:38:24,939 --> 01:38:27,533
Alexander the Great's horse.

437
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:44,884
Dad gave it to me...

438
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:48,654
just before the storm.

439
01:38:58,406 --> 01:39:04,174
lt reminds me
of The Black and me.

440
01:39:06,614 --> 01:39:12,018
Alexander's father gave it to him...

441
01:39:12,086 --> 01:39:14,020
before he died.

442
01:39:19,928 --> 01:39:24,365
l was in the water.

443
01:39:24,432 --> 01:39:26,764
l couldn't breathe.

444
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:30,032
lt was dark and...

445
01:39:30,104 --> 01:39:31,537
l--

446
01:39:36,778 --> 01:39:39,372
l yelled out for Dad, but--

447
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:48,047
l looked up,
and there was The Black...

448
01:39:48,122 --> 01:39:50,716
and l grabbed onto him.

449
01:39:50,792 --> 01:39:52,919
He saved your life, didn't he?

450
01:40:08,643 --> 01:40:10,076
Oh, Alec.

451
01:40:14,482 --> 01:40:17,315
What am l gonna do?

452
01:40:24,392 --> 01:40:26,417
l gotta ride.

453
01:40:51,286 --> 01:40:52,719
Okay, Alec.

454
01:41:57,451 --> 01:42:00,579
Neville planned the publicity?

455
01:42:00,654 --> 01:42:03,589
l'll bet the mystery horse
don't even show.

456
01:42:06,794 --> 01:42:09,388
Did you see that?

457
01:42:10,965 --> 01:42:13,229
l'll beat him.

458
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:18,602
- l heard Mendoza's comin' in.
- Who's missing from the room?

459
01:42:18,672 --> 01:42:22,108
- That beats him right there.
- Yeah. Who rides him?

460
01:42:22,176 --> 01:42:24,576
Where did that guy over there
get them silks?

461
01:42:24,645 --> 01:42:28,513
- Looks like he's ready for Halloween.
- lt sure does.

462
01:42:33,854 --> 01:42:35,913
Rider number one, up.

463
01:42:41,095 --> 01:42:45,259
- Number one, sir.
- Add two pounds.

464
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:47,197
Got that, George?

465
01:42:58,179 --> 01:43:00,147
Rider number two now.

466
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:04,683
Thank you.

467
01:43:05,953 --> 01:43:07,887
Rider number three.

468
01:43:12,693 --> 01:43:15,321
Number three?
Number three?

469
01:43:15,396 --> 01:43:16,829
How do l look?

470
01:43:16,897 --> 01:43:19,058
Number three, please.

471
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:21,693
l don't think he's gonna show.
lt's been a joke.

472
01:43:35,816 --> 01:43:40,185
The mystery rider.
Hop on the scale.

473
01:43:40,254 --> 01:43:44,088
-He's not strong enough to go two miles.
-No way. Too small.

474
01:43:44,158 --> 01:43:48,151
- Rider on the scale, please.
- He's on the scale, sir.

475
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:50,094
He's on the scale?

476
01:43:52,933 --> 01:43:54,366
Add it on.

477
01:45:19,953 --> 01:45:22,421
Okay. All right.

478
01:45:24,458 --> 01:45:28,485
Take him out.
All right, bring him right on out.

479
01:46:06,533 --> 01:46:10,025
Two miles.
They'll come by the stands twice.

480
01:46:10,104 --> 01:46:11,571
The stands are jammed.

481
01:47:18,806 --> 01:47:21,206
He's moving on the black horse,
the mystery horse.

482
01:47:27,281 --> 01:47:29,044
Bring that horse.

483
01:47:52,573 --> 01:47:54,131
Cyclone, settle! Whoa!

484
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,518
Whoa!

485
01:48:50,664 --> 01:48:52,461
Stop, Black!

486
01:48:54,067 --> 01:48:56,126
There's some problem
with the mystery horse.

487
01:49:22,062 --> 01:49:24,530
Cyclone keeping the pace.

488
01:49:53,427 --> 01:49:55,395
They're in the front turn now.

489
01:52:40,861 --> 01:52:43,421
He's won!
The mystery horse won!

490
01:52:56,276 --> 01:52:58,744
This, ladies and gentlemen--

491
01:53:37,317 --> 01:53:42,084
This horse has got a leg like iron.
lt's gonna be all right, son.

492
01:53:45,025 --> 01:53:46,287
Henry!
