1
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,659
My name is Joy Adamson...

2
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:36,129
and for many years my husband George
was senior game warden...

3
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:39,759
of the northern frontier district
in Kenya.

4
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:44,670
for some of those years we had a lioness
for a friend, whose name was Elsa.

5
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,806
get down, you fool.

6
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,345
because of the danger from poachers...

7
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:02,982
George and I had been looking
for a new home for Elsa and her family.

8
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:06,550
so when the trouble came,
George knew the area I was scouting...

9
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:09,290
and could send Nuru to find me.

10
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:42,291
I had paused briefly in a Masai village
to witness an increasingly rare sight...

11
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,195
in modern East Africa--

12
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:47,963
the rituals and ceremonies
of the Morani, or young warriors...

13
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,665
prior to a hunting expedition.

14
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,663
Nuru, what is it?
It's Elsa. Very sick.

15
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:22,636
Well, what do you mean?
I think she's dying.

16
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:38,709
I think she's dying.

17
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:42,723
I think she's dying.
How could she be?

18
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,783
she'd seemed in perfect health
when she brought her babies...

19
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,795
to visit us at Christmas.

20
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:13,216
she and her sisters
had been our babies once...

21
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,722
and we their only family.

22
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,684
but from the very beginning
there was a special feeling...

23
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,661
between Elsa and ourselves.

24
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:30,231
Of course, it was hard
not to love them all.

25
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:09,443
When they grew older, it became clear
that we couldn't cope with all three.

26
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:22,949
sadly, we had to let Elsa's two sisters
go to a zoo in Holland.

27
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,823
but we refused to part with her.

28
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,799
in return, she gave us the gift
of her love and friendship and trust--

29
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:46,074
a gift she extended to Nuru,
our houseman...

30
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:49,379
and Makedde, our chief game scout,
as well.

31
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:54,054
but it was when she became fully grown
that our difficulties began.

32
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,597
The final straw was
the elephant stampede she caused.

33
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:18,709
not the two-year-old baby elephant
she brought home for a souvenir...

34
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,443
but the damage that had been done
to local crops.

35
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,451
although we suspected
there would be trouble...

36
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,885
we were stunned when John Kendall...

37
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,287
the district commissioner
and George's boss...

38
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,952
told us we couldn't
keep Elsa any longer.

39
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,291
I'm not responsible for the decision.

40
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,389
Don't you see she's too big now
to be allowed to roam about...

41
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:41,869
even with Nuru or,
with all respect, yourselves?

42
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,801
And you can't keep her caged.
That would only frustrate her...

43
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:47,842
and could easily make her vicious.

44
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:51,675
I'm sorry, but I think you've got to
find some zoo that will take her.

45
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:55,740
You'd have no difficulty. She'd make
a wonderful attraction for any zoo.

46
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,808
Well, of course
we've always known that--

47
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,787
I'm certain we can easily find
a good zoo for her in a month.

48
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:04,384
I don't want her to go to a zoo.

49
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:08,320
I want to set her free.

50
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:11,059
You're mad.

51
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,363
You can't be serious.
You'd be sentencing her to death.

52
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:14,993
You might as well shoot her here.

53
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:20,136
John's right. She can't fend for
herself. She's never killed to eat.

54
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,905
She'd starve in the bush.
But we could teach her.

55
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:26,607
You've waited too long. Anyway,
it's never been done successfully.

56
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:31,051
But we could try.
You know how intelligent she is.

57
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,747
Well, we could teach her, train her.

58
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,017
George, please! Let's try.

59
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:40,190
I know you think I'm foolish,
but I know Elsa.

60
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:44,790
She'd be miserable in a zoo.
Don't you see she's been free too long?

61
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:51,131
John, as a friend,Just give us
three months to try. Please!

62
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:55,776
Please?

63
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:00,108
All right, my dear. I'll get you three
months, but you're wasting your time.

64
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:27,132
for a long while it seemed
as if John Kendall was right.

65
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,576
When we introduced her
to her first boyfriend...

66
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,579
it was a disaster.

67
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,377
she had no idea
how to fend for herself.

68
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:53,191
and finally, she became so ill
that she almost died.

69
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,712
It won't do.

70
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,639
Look, by now it's perfectly obvious
we've made a mistake.

71
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:19,551
She can't fend for herself.
She can't live with other animals.

72
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,249
She can't do anything a wild animal
has to do to in order to survive.

73
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:26,158
You-- well, we've made too good
a job of her.

74
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:29,595
We've made her tame, and it's too late
to try and make her go wild now.

75
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:33,623
All we're doing is torturing her,
making her miserable.

76
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,636
How can you be so cruel?

77
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,039
Do you think I enjoy it?

78
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:42,304
Oh, I don't know what's going on
in that head of yours anymore.

79
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:45,039
You've got this fixed idea.

80
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:47,308
What's wrong with a zoo anyway?

81
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:50,249
Nothing, except she won't be free.

82
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:52,582
Is freedom so important?

83
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:55,418
Yes! Yes, it is.

84
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,755
She was born free,
and she has a right to live free.

85
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:02,558
Well, why don't we live in some nice,
comfortable city? Other people do.

86
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:06,123
But we've chosen to live here
because it represents freedom to us.

87
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:10,328
Because we can breathe here.

88
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:12,066
That's because we're fit for it.

89
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,074
But she can be too!

90
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,573
She can. She can.

91
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:28,188
She'd be safe in a zoo.

92
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:30,816
Oh, yes. Safe.

93
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,759
And fat and dull...

94
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:37,389
and lazy, like some cow
on a milking machine.

95
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,101
Look. Joy, tell me honestly.

96
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,438
You just don't want to give her up.

97
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,536
What you're hoping is that
she can go on living out here.

98
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:56,380
Wild, but not too wild. And you can see
her now and then. That's it, isn't it?

99
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:00,080
That's not the whole truth.
But I won't deny I would like it.

100
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:03,147
It's impossible.
It can't happen.

101
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:07,456
If she were able to go wild, which I
doubt, then that'll be the end of it.

102
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,929
You'll never see her again.

103
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:13,024
But at least she'd be free!

104
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,070
At least she wouldn't be in a cage
for the rest of her life.

105
00:14:19,474 --> 00:14:23,843
but she recovered and proved
that she could indeed...

106
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:26,574
hold her own as a wild lioness.

107
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,188
but still she remained our friend...

108
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:45,391
and always brought her cubs to visit us
whenever we camped in her territory.

109
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,171
We rarely glimpsed her mate, but
we were always aware ofhis presence...

110
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,106
somewhere nearby.

111
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:02,506
although the cubs seemed to sense
the bond between their mother and us...

112
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:06,611
and although they made themselves
at home and accepted their free meals...

113
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:09,714
and the cod liver oil
they were so mad about...

114
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,055
they kept their distance too.

115
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,532
for our part, George and I had agreed...

116
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:26,938
never to fondle or to hold them
as we had Elsa...

117
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,500
but rather to let them grow up
wild and free.

118
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,416
from the start, the leader of the cubs
was one of the two males--

119
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:42,013
Jespah, which in swahili means
""brave leader. ''

120
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,050
and he was, in fact, the bravest
and the brightest of the three.

121
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,619
Little Elsa, like her mother
had once been...

122
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,861
was the smallest of the litter,
but very clever.

123
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,731
The third cub, another male,
was very shy...

124
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,773
so we called him Gopa...

125
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,401
which in swahili means ""timid. ''

126
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:05,139
Little Elsa worshiped Jespah...

127
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:09,741
while cautious Gopa
always brought up the rear.

128
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,787
They were a happy family.

129
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:42,007
but now, if Nuru was right,
Elsa was dying.

130
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,977
if it was true,
who would look after the cubs?

131
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:19,579
Thanks, Dave.

132
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,693
So it wasn't poachers?

133
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:38,425
No. It was definitely
some kind of an infection.

134
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:41,798
Though there have been poachers
around.

135
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,304
And her mate?

136
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:49,071
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen the cubs' father at all.

137
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,576
That's very strange.

138
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:52,078
What about the cubs?

139
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:56,116
They've disappeared.

140
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:01,549
They'll starve! They're much too young
to fend for themselves.

141
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,217
Yes, Joy. I know.

142
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:09,124
I'm sorry.
You must be tired.

143
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:11,722
I'll be all right
now you're here.

144
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,570
Will you take me to where she is now?

145
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,075
Yeah.

146
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:46,800
Is this all that remains of Elsa?

147
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:48,802
Of our life together?

148
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:52,273
Is this the end?

149
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,039
No. She'll always be alive for us.

150
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:58,578
You know that.

151
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,079
Yes.

152
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,184
Yes, she will.

153
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,541
That sounds like the cubs.

154
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,546
Better look.

155
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:47,755
They'd grown considerably
since I'd seen them last.

156
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:53,096
but it was plain that they were puzzled
by the disappearance of their mother.

157
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:06,709
and then I did a very foolish thing.

158
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:18,053
My poor little Jespah.

159
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:29,828
We'd better get something on that
straight away.

160
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:42,348
Yes. I know what I did wrong.

161
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:46,945
I know. I said I would never
try to treat them like pets--

162
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,285
never try to touch them.

163
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:51,587
Well, the exact words were...

164
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,288
""They were born wild,
so they have to live wild.''

165
00:21:55,363 --> 00:22:00,801
But how can one be sure that they'll
live at all now that Elsa's dead?

166
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:06,170
Well, they'll either live or die...

167
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,504
like other wild animals,
won't they?

168
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:13,712
If you think that's easy for me
to say, you're wrong.

169
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:15,715
I know. Thank you.

170
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:20,946
The thing is, they're too young
to hunt for themselves.

171
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:24,150
If they were part of a pride,
they'd learn.

172
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,995
They may join a pride,
with any luck at all.

173
00:22:29,063 --> 00:22:33,261
Or they may not.
As it stands, we're their pride.

174
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:36,235
Ah,Joy, it just--
Listen, George. Please.

175
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:40,206
We could teach them to hunt
for themselves. We did it with Elsa.

176
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:43,573
And it would be much easier with them
because they're already wild.

177
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:47,444
Jespah's intelligent. He'd soon learn,
and then he'd teach the others.

178
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:51,451
We don't have the time.
We had six months with Elsa.

179
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,044
Now we have no time at all--
and me?

180
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,784
I shouldn't be here.
I have work to do.

181
00:22:56,858 --> 00:22:59,850
George, isn't there anything
that you can do?

182
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:03,419
They're Elsa's cubs. Please.

183
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:11,728
I suppose I could ask
to take my leave now.

184
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,070
But I'm only due six weeks.

185
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:18,571
You are an absolute darling!

186
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:23,106
Six weeks! Well, anything can happen
in six weeks. We've had miracles before.

187
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:25,675
Well, before we start
counting on miracles...

188
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:28,483
first we have to find out
where those three little perishers live.

189
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,831
so we went looking for
the ""three little perishers. ''

190
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,360
but it was like looking for three
very small needles in a vast haystack.

191
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:13,901
Watch out.
There could be leopards.

192
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:29,648
Dangerous beast.
I thought he'd got me.

193
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,912
I wish there was some other way back.

194
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:37,719
Yeah, so do I.

195
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,090
Do you want me to carry you?
No, thanks.

196
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,527
Well, how about carrying me?

197
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:44,030
Idiot.

198
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:23,130
all too quickly
George's leave was over.

199
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,636
We were miserable at having to stop
looking for the cubs.

200
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:42,313
Just in case they ever did come back,
we left them a farewell meal...

201
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,848
and some of their favorite drink,
cod liver oil.

202
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:10,014
I'm sorry, darling.

203
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:12,018
I know you are.

204
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:15,655
You've been wonderful.

205
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:19,793
But I'm not going to stop looking for
them until I know they're all right.

206
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,260
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

207
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,000
I never thought you wouldn't.

208
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,832
So will I, somehow.

209
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:58,423
actually, I was able to return
in a few days.

210
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,926
and George came back
as soon as he could.

211
00:28:00,995 --> 00:28:03,429
but we found no trace of them.

212
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:16,303
east africa is beautiful,
but it's not a safari park...

213
00:28:16,377 --> 00:28:19,676
where attendants look after
and feed the animals.

214
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:27,420
in the bush, carnivorous animals
kill and eat other animals...

215
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,956
in order to stay alive themselves.

216
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:59,545
The cubs would have to learn to hunt
if they were to survive...

217
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,556
and we hoped that Jespah,
with his innate courage and ingenuity...

218
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:06,092
would provide the necessary leadership.

219
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,592
but if they couldn't learn to kill
for themselves...

220
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:52,257
they would have to become scavengers
and freeloaders...

221
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,893
like the hyenas and the vultures...

222
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:02,704
and the marabou storks.

223
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:07,042
if they joined this motley crew, they'd
have to take their chances among them.

224
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,516
With some animals, especially
young ones like themselves...

225
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:21,486
the cubs would maintain
a kind of armed neutrality.

226
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,102
but the cubs had no parents
to protect them...

227
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,037
particularly against other species...

228
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:16,941
with whom there would always be an
instinctive hostility...

229
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,001
and, indeed, warfare.

230
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:08,278
but on the whole,
we were more worried...

231
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:11,483
about the danger from human beings.

232
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:16,655
east africa is very large and impossible
to keep under constant watch...

233
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,496
particularly as poaching has become
more sophisticated in recent years.

234
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:07,508
but the sad truth was...

235
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:11,017
that for the cubs,
all human beings were dangerous.

236
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,382
Lady!

237
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:14,784
Where is that silly dog?

238
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,259
Come on. Here.

239
00:37:34,234 --> 00:37:36,634
Oh, my god!
Herbie! Lions!

240
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,506
Don't panic!

241
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:54,820
Our great hope was that the cubs
would find and be adopted by a pride...

242
00:37:54,888 --> 00:37:56,788
and in that way learn by example...

243
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,623
how to hunt and eventually
feed themselves.

244
00:39:08,028 --> 00:39:11,486
but if the cubs were not accepted
by a pride...

245
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:16,299
then there was great danger that hunger
might drive them towards villages...

246
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:17,802
and domestic animals.

247
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:41,053
at this time, George's duties took him
into the area I was searching.

248
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,221
so while he kept an eye out
for the cubs...

249
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:48,233
I was able to go into nairobi to meet
our friend and publisher Billy Collins.

250
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:07,576
Billy had been a friend of Elsa's too.

251
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:10,646
indeed, the last time Billy
visited us...

252
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:13,284
he and Elsa had,
in a manner of speaking...

253
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,487
spent the night together--

254
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:18,429
an experience Billy never forgot.

255
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:44,953
but that was in happier days.

256
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,517
now as I took Billy to our camp,
we ran into bad luck...

257
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:51,496
in the midst of a large troop
of baboons.

258
00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:56,802
The trouble with baboons is...

259
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,237
that while they may look deceptively
appealing from a distance...

260
00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:02,400
they can be extremely dangerous.

261
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,576
John, thank you.

262
00:41:46,653 --> 00:41:49,486
It was all right, but I was beginning
to wonder if they'd ever go.

263
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:51,820
Oh, you remember Billy Collins,
don't you?

264
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:54,325
Nice to see you.
Welcome back.

265
00:41:54,394 --> 00:41:56,794
John, you're not here by coincidence,
are you?

266
00:41:56,863 --> 00:42:01,323
No. I've been trailing you all the way
from the airport. There's trouble.

267
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:04,564
Not George?
No. The cubs.

268
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:09,135
A report has come in that they've
been raiding villages...

269
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:12,701
and killing goats in the Tana River
area, just outside the reserve.

270
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:16,112
George is checking on it now.
Sorry.

271
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:19,251
You see, if it's true, I'm afraid
they'll have to be destroyed.

272
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:21,082
But it can't be true.
I don't believe it.

273
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:28,253
Under the circumstances,
Billy canceled his visit with us...

274
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:30,762
and I hurried to George
to learn the truth.

275
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:35,094
On the way I had to pass
the same rock...

276
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:38,228
where Elsa and her family
had lived so happily.

277
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,934
and here I had
the most wonderful surprise.

278
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:44,636
Nuru, would you pass me
the field glasses, please?

279
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:50,342
What is it?

280
00:42:51,718 --> 00:42:55,415
The cubs. They've found a pride.

281
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:57,979
Over there, on Elsa's rock.

282
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:00,253
Are you sure?
Look.

283
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:10,426
It's very far, you know.
Maybe you drive closer.

284
00:43:10,503 --> 00:43:12,266
No, no.
That might scatter the pride.

285
00:43:14,974 --> 00:43:16,908
Yes.

286
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:19,171
Yes, I'm sure of it.

287
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:21,110
It couldn't be a coincidence,
not on Elsa's rock.

288
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,776
Ah, yes. That's Jespah.
I'm almost positive.

289
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:29,380
But if those are the cubs, they're not
raiding villages. It would be too far.

290
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:32,323
Yes. It would be too far.

291
00:43:32,392 --> 00:43:35,452
I hope you are right.
I'm sure of it.

292
00:43:36,629 --> 00:43:38,563
I can't wait to tell George.

293
00:43:41,668 --> 00:43:45,035
Okay. Tell him
I'll pay for all the goats.

294
00:44:06,192 --> 00:44:09,787
George, it isn't the cubs.
We've seen them up on Elsa's rock.

295
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:11,353
They'd never get this far.

296
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:14,332
When did you see them?
Early this morning, didn't we?

297
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,768
I think so. But we see them
through field glasses.

298
00:44:17,837 --> 00:44:19,498
Yes.

299
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:21,904
It wasn't Elsa's cubs that you saw.

300
00:44:21,975 --> 00:44:23,738
I wish it had been.

301
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,938
Jespah, Gopa and Little Elsa
raided the village next to this one...

302
00:44:27,013 --> 00:44:30,642
early this morning-- and I didn't see
them through field glasses.

303
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:34,244
I saw them close.
They were our cubs.

304
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,719
I'm sorry, darling.

305
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:40,250
So what do we do now?

306
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:42,961
I'll show you.

307
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:48,595
All these villages here
are the targets.

308
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:53,435
The cubs pick whichever one they
happen to fancy at any time.

309
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:56,942
It spreads out our scouts
pretty thin, I can tell you.

310
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,379
I don't want the cubs shot, George.
Neither do I.

311
00:45:02,882 --> 00:45:04,679
I've made a deal with the elders.

312
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:07,481
We buy every goat
that's hurt or killed...

313
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:10,614
and they've agreed not to shoot or harm
any of the cubs...

314
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,022
until we can think of a way
to handle this.

315
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:17,722
This goat-buying business
has turned out somewhat expensive.

316
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,258
That doesn't matter.

317
00:45:21,334 --> 00:45:23,666
Now, the real problem
is how to discourage the cubs...

318
00:45:23,736 --> 00:45:25,431
from raiding these villages.

319
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:31,068
That's right. Now, they were driven off
from that village there this morning.

320
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:35,308
So there's a pretty good chance
we may see them here tonight.

321
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:04,294
I'm afraid it's perfectly obvious
we're responsible.

322
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,703
But how were we to know--
We introduced the cubs...

323
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:10,743
to goat meat
when they were very small.

324
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:12,573
And when they couldn't join a pride...

325
00:47:12,645 --> 00:47:15,546
when they found difficulty in hunting
other wild animals...

326
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:18,482
quite naturally they turned back
to tame goat.

327
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:22,851
You can't blame them.
No. But it obviously can't go on.

328
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:24,583
It can't.
They'll have to be moved.

329
00:47:24,657 --> 00:47:30,118
Taken away from here to where there are
no people or domestic animals nearby.

330
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:33,097
That's right.
But first we have to catch them.

331
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,191
And that's not going to be easy now,
my love.

332
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:49,148
I understand it is the cubs.
We're afraid so.

333
00:47:50,216 --> 00:47:52,013
So what happens now?

334
00:47:52,085 --> 00:47:56,249
Well, I've arranged a warning system
that should keep them away.

335
00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:57,812
That'll be ready in a day or two.

336
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,849
It will mean keeping quite a few of the
game scouts in the area, I'm afraid.

337
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:04,192
I'm afraid all this
sounds a bit temporary.

338
00:48:04,263 --> 00:48:07,130
We realize this is not
a permanent solution.

339
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,397
Obviously the cubs will have to be
caught and moved away from here.

340
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,596
Moved? Where?

341
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:15,368
Somewhere away from villages,
people and domestic livestock.

342
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:19,844
To a reserve. We had thought of the
Serengeti. It's a paradise for wildlife.

343
00:48:19,912 --> 00:48:24,372
Yes. It also happens to be 700 miles
away. How do you propose to do it?

344
00:48:26,586 --> 00:48:31,182
Well, obviously the first thing
that we have to do...

345
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:35,694
is find where the cubs are lying up,
which has to be around here somewhere.

346
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:39,789
Then we'll have to
lure them away somehow.

347
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:45,270
Then after we've gained their confidence
and fed them regularly--

348
00:48:45,338 --> 00:48:50,708
to keep them out of temptation's way
and also to keep them away from here--

349
00:48:52,412 --> 00:48:54,937
we'll get them into cages.

350
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:57,847
Again, somehow.

351
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,078
And then we'll drive them
to Serengeti.

352
00:49:00,153 --> 00:49:03,680
I see. And how long do you think
all this will take?

353
00:49:03,756 --> 00:49:07,248
Well, a great deal will
depend upon luck, of course.

354
00:49:07,326 --> 00:49:10,056
I know what John means.

355
00:49:10,129 --> 00:49:12,723
Bad luck or good,
it's going to take too long a time...

356
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:17,395
for a senior game warden who's got
other things on his plate as well.

357
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,338
What are you talking about?
I am right, aren't I,John?

358
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:25,343
No. If you can round up the cubs
in a week or so, there'd be no problem.

359
00:49:25,411 --> 00:49:29,074
We'll ship them somewhere.
It's impossible.

360
00:49:29,148 --> 00:49:33,312
It can't be done.
Not in two or three weeks.

361
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:35,320
It could take months.

362
00:49:42,395 --> 00:49:44,863
I think I have to resign.

363
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:50,358
George, you've never said anything
about resigning.

364
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:52,267
You can't. You mustn't let him.

365
00:49:52,338 --> 00:49:54,397
I don't intend to.
I'm not gonna have it, George.

366
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:57,102
I think it's the only way.
No, George!

367
00:49:57,176 --> 00:49:59,644
I'm not gonna lose you for three cubs,
even Elsa's cubs!

368
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:02,340
I'd rather have them put down.
I mean it.

369
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:05,714
John, couldn't we
talk about this tomorrow?

370
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:09,319
Yes. By all means.

371
00:50:10,356 --> 00:50:13,416
But it's your life
that I'm thinking about.

372
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:16,587
You can't do it.
You can't leave the service.

373
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:20,359
And I tell you again, I have to. There's
no telling how long this will take.

374
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:23,869
I can't ask for any more leave.
I have got to resign.

375
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:26,530
But the service has been
your whole life.

376
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:30,269
Twenty years, you've given it.
Twenty years.

377
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:31,867
It's given me a lot too.

378
00:50:31,944 --> 00:50:34,469
The best years of my life.
Then how can you leave it?

379
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:37,744
Because we have an obligation
to those cubs of Elsa's.

380
00:50:37,817 --> 00:50:41,810
Now you said that yourself when
all this started, and you were right.

381
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:47,053
So why not give in?
And give us a kiss.

382
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:51,563
But I know why you're doing it.
You make me feel very selfish.

383
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,360
Selfish?

384
00:50:53,432 --> 00:50:56,560
Why, you're a bloody saint,
you are.

385
00:51:01,474 --> 00:51:03,874
He'll only be a moment.
Oh, good.

386
00:51:03,943 --> 00:51:06,241
His drawings for the cages took longer
than we thought.

387
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:09,406
He's been up all night.
Here they are.

388
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:14,083
Thank you.
Sorry to keep you,John.

389
00:51:14,153 --> 00:51:15,586
It's all right.

390
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:23,695
I'm really sorry about leaving
the service. Ah, you know that.

391
00:51:23,763 --> 00:51:27,460
Not as sorry as I am, I'm afraid.
I had plans for you.

392
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:31,970
Oh, yes. Another five years, and I'd get
a gold watch and a six-course dinner.

393
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:35,496
No, George. I'd hoped you'd
take my place when I retired.

394
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:38,874
What?
Mmm.

395
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:43,841
good Lord, I'd no idea.

396
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,146
I'm terribly sorry.

397
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:48,449
I'm a bit slow on the uptake
this morning.

398
00:51:51,991 --> 00:51:53,822
You're a good friend.

399
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:55,724
Well, I'll do my best
with the Serengeti.

400
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:57,763
I'll let you know as quickly
as I can.

401
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,025
But I don't know how much time
I can give you here.

402
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:02,727
I wouldn't count on more than
three months, if that, either of you.

403
00:52:02,802 --> 00:52:04,736
Of course, we understand.

404
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:08,635
Look after yourself, won't you?
Yup.

405
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,508
And get some sleep.
As soon as I can.

406
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:16,738
Nuru?
Coming.

407
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:31,322
George did resign, and Makedde
left the service with him.

408
00:52:31,397 --> 00:52:33,228
All right, Makedde.
Let's get to work.

409
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,624
George set about strengthening the
thorn barriers surrounding the villages.

410
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:13,468
Then he and Makedde inaugurated
an early warning and defense system.

411
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:20,874
The idea was to frighten the cubs away
from the villages...

412
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:24,439
without damage to either the cattle
or the cubs, if possible.

413
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,736
and the system had its chance
the very next night.

414
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,747
I think our young friends
have had a little surprise.

415
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,310
So far, so good.

416
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:04,549
Now what? We wait some more?

417
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:07,524
Oh, yes. Now that we know
they're on the prowl tonight...

418
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:10,221
we do indeed wait some more.

419
00:54:10,296 --> 00:54:13,663
If I know Jespah, he won't give up
that easily.

420
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,512
Well, it works.

421
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:10,317
Now all we've got to do is find out
where those cubs are living these days.

422
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:51,826
good morning.

423
00:56:52,825 --> 00:56:55,089
This was the great test.

424
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:58,130
The cubs were older
and wilder now.

425
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:00,859
Would they remember George?

426
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:04,391
Would they still at least have
their old passion for cod liver oil?

427
00:57:15,381 --> 00:57:18,407
it was essential that George
should get them to trust him now...

428
00:57:18,484 --> 00:57:22,011
at this meeting,
for there might never be another.

429
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,108
as always, it was Jespah
who made the decision.

430
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,745
It's good luck they like
cod liver oil, eh?

431
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:27,547
Yes. Thank god forJespah--
he remembered.

432
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:33,354
You know, that cub could very easily
become my favorite lion.

433
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:37,191
Well, now we know where they live.

434
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,699
You get some sleep.
You work all the time.

435
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:43,599
Makedde, the real work starts now.

436
00:58:43,669 --> 00:58:45,432
We're going to have to
feed them every day.

437
00:58:45,504 --> 00:58:48,098
We're going to have to move them
away from the villages.

438
00:58:48,173 --> 00:58:50,801
And do you know when we start?

439
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:55,404
Yes, I do. Right now.

440
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:02,010
George immediately made a new camp...

441
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:04,385
as near as possible
to the cubs'hiding place...

442
00:59:04,456 --> 00:59:07,425
and as far as possible
from the villages and their goats.

443
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:17,398
Then he began to lure the cubs
towards the new camp for their meals...

444
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:22,429
in order to ward off temptation
and evil thoughts of domestic cattle.

445
00:59:51,236 --> 00:59:54,899
but all this took time,
and so did everything else.

446
00:59:55,841 --> 00:59:58,605
I put George's plans into work...

447
00:59:58,677 --> 01:00:01,612
only to discover
that we had other problems as well.

448
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:05,373
You see, I'm awfully very sorry,
Mrs. Adamson...

449
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:08,215
but, you see, your account
seems to be overdrawn.

450
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,225
Well, I knew it was low,
but I had no idea.

451
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:17,353
Look, I am expecting
some money soon.

452
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:19,727
Do you think the manager would
let me have an overdraft?

453
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:21,732
I will go and ask him.

454
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,960
Thank you.

455
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,728
Oh, hello,Joy.

456
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:28,830
John, hello.

457
01:00:28,907 --> 01:00:30,738
Is there anything wrong?

458
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:34,143
No, nothing. I'm just waiting.
I see.

459
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,649
Well, I have news for you--
some good, some bad.

460
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:39,707
I was going to write this afternoon.

461
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:42,083
No, please don't.
Tell me now.

462
01:00:42,154 --> 01:00:45,282
Well, the good news is
the Serengeti will take your cubs.

463
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:49,728
That's wonderful. Thank you.
Thank you,John.

464
01:00:49,795 --> 01:00:51,786
And the bad news?

465
01:00:51,864 --> 01:00:55,823
I'm afraid I can't get you more than 60
days to capture them and get them out.

466
01:00:56,935 --> 01:00:59,927
Sixty days. I see.

467
01:01:00,005 --> 01:01:03,463
Well, we'll Just have to get
Jespah to cooperate somehow.

468
01:01:04,743 --> 01:01:07,143
Thank you,John.
I know you did your best.

469
01:01:07,212 --> 01:01:10,648
good morning. We'll be very happy to
give you an overdraft, Mrs. Adamson.

470
01:01:10,716 --> 01:01:13,810
For as much as you need.
Thank you.

471
01:01:17,556 --> 01:01:20,491
Thank you very much indeed.
Not at all.

472
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:25,330
I do wish you'd say something,
anything,John.

473
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:27,592
I can't stand your silent disapproval.

474
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:31,067
Why should I disapprove?
I'm sure everyone in the whole world...

475
01:01:31,136 --> 01:01:33,604
is accustomed to people
giving up a job and a career...

476
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:37,506
spending themselves broke, using up
their life savings over some lion cubs.

477
01:01:37,576 --> 01:01:39,066
I'm sure you're right.
About what?

478
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:41,578
Everything.
You're always right.

479
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:43,615
If you needed money,
why didn't you come to me?

480
01:01:43,682 --> 01:01:45,946
Because there's a limit,
even to a friendship like ours.

481
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:48,646
Besides, you've done enough
for us already.

482
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,816
Unless you'd like to help me find
a special truck we're going to need.

483
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:56,394
Come on.

484
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:01,559
finally the cages and
the specially built truck were ready.

485
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:04,932
but by then,
we had all too little time left.

486
01:02:11,577 --> 01:02:13,340
I was getting desperate...

487
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:17,974
and I knew that George must be waiting
for my return with equal anxiety.

488
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,255
I hated to stop even for one night...

489
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:28,384
and agreed to only because we would
have lost our way in the darkness.

490
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,435
That night, some of the enemies
we'd made among poachers...

491
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:49,242
took their chance at revenge.

492
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:07,861
Are you all right?

493
01:03:20,145 --> 01:03:22,443
Luckily, they'd not tried
to burn our new truck as well...

494
01:03:22,514 --> 01:03:26,974
or perhaps Nuru's shots had frightened
them away before they were ready.

495
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,653
dear Nuru--
we've always owed him a great deal.

496
01:03:53,078 --> 01:03:56,275
You see? I've got them.
Oh, very good.

497
01:03:56,348 --> 01:03:58,782
Where's Bwana George?
He's up there.

498
01:04:08,694 --> 01:04:09,956
Boo!

499
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:14,359
I'm more accustomed to cheers,
actually.

500
01:04:17,202 --> 01:04:19,796
I missed you.
I'm surprised you had time.

501
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,478
How did you manage it?
Tell you later. How was Nairobi?

502
01:04:28,547 --> 01:04:30,344
I'll tell you later.

503
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:35,815
You must be--
You must be exhausted.

504
01:04:39,224 --> 01:04:42,751
They look marvelous.
They should do.

505
01:04:42,828 --> 01:04:44,762
They eat like pigs.

506
01:04:51,937 --> 01:04:53,199
What's that for?

507
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:56,934
It's my early-warning system to tell
the villagers that the cubs are about.

508
01:04:57,843 --> 01:04:59,868
But I don't think there'll be
any raids tonight.

509
01:04:59,945 --> 01:05:02,880
They've put away
enough food today, I think.

510
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:05,940
That's the second part
of my system.

511
01:05:06,018 --> 01:05:09,579
So, you won't be
on guard duty tonight.

512
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:13,216
No. I don't think I will.

513
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,225
good.

514
01:05:15,293 --> 01:05:16,760
I think so.

515
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,374
glad you're back.

516
01:05:30,442 --> 01:05:32,376
So am I.

517
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:42,045
Oh, God, not tonight.
Damn.

518
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:07,101
it was probably only sheer high spirits
that brought the cubs there...

519
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:09,579
but the consequences were disastrous.

520
01:06:09,648 --> 01:06:11,343
and, as luck would have it...

521
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:14,579
it was Jespah
who caused the disaster.

522
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:22,786
for, by entering a hut,
he had made himself an outlaw.

523
01:06:35,173 --> 01:06:39,769
Luckily, the boy who shot Jespah was
too young to be allowed poisoned arrows.

524
01:06:39,845 --> 01:06:42,905
Otherwise,Jespah would have been
dead in minutes.

525
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:47,350
but the arrowhead remained
in his side, and the wound was open.

526
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,426
The very next day,
we started setting up...

527
01:06:55,494 --> 01:06:58,930
the combined traps and cages
George had designed...

528
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:01,898
because, ironically,
to guarantee the cubs their freedom...

529
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:04,936
we had to make them prisoners first.

530
01:07:05,804 --> 01:07:09,570
Obviously, it would have been simpler
if we could have used tranquilizers.

531
01:07:09,641 --> 01:07:13,907
but, in our opinion, the chances
of a fatal overdose were too great.

532
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:20,351
so we had to do it another way,
and, as it turned out, the hard way.

533
01:07:22,187 --> 01:07:26,385
We had three cages, and there could
only be one cub in each cage...

534
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:30,986
because we knew that fear
and frustration in close confinement...

535
01:07:31,062 --> 01:07:33,394
would make them fight
and hurt each other.

536
01:07:33,465 --> 01:07:38,129
additionally, we had to capture
all three cubs simultaneously...

537
01:07:38,203 --> 01:07:42,799
because the ones that were not trapped
would never come near the cages again.

538
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:50,610
and we had to keep the cage doors
from breaking bones when they came down.

539
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:57,183
George devised a way of operating
the traps from two different positions.

540
01:07:58,256 --> 01:08:00,247
Ready?

541
01:08:02,227 --> 01:08:04,058
and, finally, it was all done.

542
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:07,257
We could only keep our fingers crossed
and hope for the best.

543
01:08:10,502 --> 01:08:15,633
but that same day we received the worst
news of our lives from Nairobi.

544
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:27,485
and John Kendall's letter told us that
we had only 60 days to get the cubs out.

545
01:08:30,322 --> 01:08:33,450
With no time to be lost,
we set to work immediately...

546
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:36,050
luring the cubs towards the cages.

547
01:08:44,903 --> 01:08:47,633
Whoa! Take it easy.

548
01:09:01,019 --> 01:09:04,819
I think something will
have to be done about Jespah.

549
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,833
at last we got them there.
and, to our joy...

550
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:27,276
they approached the cages
with no sign of fear.

551
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:55,865
That first day, we thought we were going
to have an astounding stroke of luck.

552
01:10:12,023 --> 01:10:15,220
and then we knew it would not be
as easy as all that.

553
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:24,024
Oh, well.
There's always tomorrow.

554
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:33,499
and tomorrow, and tomorrow...

555
01:10:33,578 --> 01:10:36,741
until only two weeks remained...

556
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:40,307
while the cubs did
everything possible to fray our nerves.

557
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,631
get in further, Little Elsa, please.

558
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,085
go on,Jespah, get in!

559
01:11:48,653 --> 01:11:50,814
To make it all worse,
it was now clear...

560
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,154
that the arrowhead had not
worked itself out of Jespah's body...

561
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:56,159
but was still imbedded
in his side...

562
01:11:57,262 --> 01:12:00,197
and that his wound was,
in fact, festering.

563
01:12:33,364 --> 01:12:38,165
You know something? Even if it doesn't
work, it was a brilliant idea.

564
01:12:38,236 --> 01:12:39,828
Thank you.

565
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:46,576
You're very talented.
You could have gone far.

566
01:12:46,644 --> 01:12:50,171
I am devoid of ambition.

567
01:12:52,484 --> 01:12:55,044
Yes, I know.

568
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,145
That's why I love you.

569
01:13:58,316 --> 01:14:03,379
go on,Jespah.
Stop messing about. go in.

570
01:14:19,537 --> 01:14:21,266
Oh, blast.

571
01:14:39,857 --> 01:14:43,122
Well, we'll try again tomorrow.

572
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:46,289
We're running out of tomorrows.

573
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:40,310
It's all right.
They'll be holed up somewhere.

574
01:15:40,385 --> 01:15:42,182
They'll be back when they're hungry.

575
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:49,121
It's Jespah's wound
I'm worried about.

576
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:54,524
We've got to do something
about that arrowhead.

577
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:57,227
Elsa died of an infection, remember?

578
01:15:59,003 --> 01:16:00,937
Yes, I remember.

579
01:16:03,775 --> 01:16:07,211
But it didn't seem to be troubling him
too much the last time we saw him.

580
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,012
Though it should come out,
of course.

581
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:16,677
Come on.

582
01:16:16,754 --> 01:16:19,018
Cheer up.

583
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:22,355
The sun'll be out tomorrow,
I promise you.

584
01:16:26,864 --> 01:16:29,298
George was wrong.

585
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:32,803
High in the mountains, the heavy rains
were culminating in a flash flood.

586
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:34,701
it came at dawn.

587
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:55,959
Joy, wake up!
My god! What's happened?

588
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:40,028
god, those cages!

589
01:17:41,839 --> 01:17:45,070
If they've been damaged by the flood,
we've had it.

590
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:39,896
it was too much.

591
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:44,935
it was just too much.

592
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:49,163
now it seemed that everything
had fallen apart on us...

593
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,731
and we were down to our last week.

594
01:18:57,148 --> 01:19:01,847
as for the cubs, they never came back
after the night the cage doors jammed.

595
01:19:11,128 --> 01:19:13,096
I'm afraid I've had it.

596
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:16,326
Come on. I'll take you back.

597
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,732
I'll take myself back, thank you.

598
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:36,783
I'm sorry, darling.
It's Just...

599
01:19:36,854 --> 01:19:40,551
that I've never been so depressed
in all my life.

600
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,855
We've three days left.

601
01:19:44,395 --> 01:19:48,195
We've got three days
and eight hours.

602
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:49,858
Come on.

603
01:20:08,653 --> 01:20:11,747
I think I'll watch
just a little while longer.

604
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:25,322
You've done it! You've done it!

605
01:21:27,231 --> 01:21:32,225
Oh, I'm not prejudiced,
but you are absolutely wonderful!

606
01:21:36,674 --> 01:21:38,608
It's easy when you know how.

607
01:21:48,886 --> 01:21:54,153
as quickly as possible, we set out
on our 700-mile trek to the Serengeti.

608
01:22:47,278 --> 01:22:51,942
it was a difficult trip. it must have
been even more difficult for the lions.

609
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:06,488
Welcome to the Serengeti.

610
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:07,826
Thank god.

611
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:34,451
He's lost his brakes.

612
01:24:07,658 --> 01:24:10,092
We've got to get ahead
and stop them.

613
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:15,323
He's trying to pass.

614
01:24:24,642 --> 01:24:25,939
Here we go.

615
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:34,341
Hold tight!

616
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:04,179
Welcome to the Serengeti.

617
01:25:07,651 --> 01:25:09,243
Welcome to the Serengeti.

618
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,844
Thank you.
My name's Weaver.

619
01:25:10,921 --> 01:25:13,481
And may I congratulate
and thank you for a good job.

620
01:25:13,557 --> 01:25:16,993
What I mean is,
you've made me richer by 12 pounds.

621
01:25:17,061 --> 01:25:19,120
There were, among my colleagues...

622
01:25:19,196 --> 01:25:21,926
certain skeptics who thought
you'd never make it.

623
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:24,092
We're happy to have disappointed them.
good!

624
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:26,329
Now, let's see
those famous cubs of yours.

625
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:32,642
You can release them anywhere around
here. There's lots of game and water.

626
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,473
It's a paradise.

627
01:25:34,545 --> 01:25:36,740
Well, they look in pretty good shape,
everything considered.

628
01:25:36,814 --> 01:25:39,408
We hope to have them in much better
shape by the time we leave.

629
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:43,317
By the time you leave?
I'm sorry, but you can't stay, you know.

630
01:25:44,822 --> 01:25:47,290
But we can't leave them until they're
able to fend for themselves.

631
01:25:47,358 --> 01:25:49,724
We can't allow you
to hunt for them here.

632
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:52,261
They're going to have to
learn their trade like any other cubs.

633
01:25:52,329 --> 01:25:54,024
But other cubs have
a mother to teach them.

634
01:25:54,765 --> 01:25:56,027
I'm sorry.

635
01:25:57,935 --> 01:26:01,132
You mean you really want us to leave?
Yes.

636
01:26:02,273 --> 01:26:04,833
Now, I promise you
we'll keep an eye on them.

637
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,503
But if they're ever going to join up
with a wild pride...

638
01:26:07,578 --> 01:26:10,342
this is where it's gonna happen,
okay?

639
01:26:25,262 --> 01:26:29,323
it was not the way we'd planned it
or what we'd hoped for.

640
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,300
and we were desperately worried
about Jespah...

641
01:26:31,368 --> 01:26:33,336
but there was nothing
that we could do about it.

642
01:26:33,404 --> 01:26:36,373
and so we drove them
to an area that reminded us...

643
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,738
of where Elsa and her cubs
had lived happily...

644
01:26:38,809 --> 01:26:40,401
many long months before.

645
01:27:04,601 --> 01:27:06,262
it had been a lengthy journey...

646
01:27:06,337 --> 01:27:09,033
and the cubs,
after being caged for so long...

647
01:27:09,106 --> 01:27:11,597
were afraid to venture
out of their prisons.

648
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,337
Thank you, Makedde.

649
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,894
Oh, come on,Jespah.
You know you love it.

650
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,967
good-bye,Jespah.

651
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:35,009
good-bye, Gopa...

652
01:29:37,087 --> 01:29:38,679
Little Elsa.

653
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:46,695
Will we ever see them again,
do you think?

654
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,934
They'll be all right.

655
01:29:55,105 --> 01:29:57,539
At least they're free.

656
01:30:07,651 --> 01:30:10,779
Yes, they were free.

657
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:13,823
They would still have
their problems to face...

658
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:15,722
and dangers to meet...

659
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:18,022
but they were free--

660
01:30:18,095 --> 01:30:20,120
living free.
