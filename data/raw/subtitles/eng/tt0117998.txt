1
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,650
<i>It's in the center of the circle in
Kingfisher County, moving north.</i>

2
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,310
<i>Tornado warning continues now
and has been extended officially.</i>

3
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,150
<i>I gave this to you earlier.
It's extended over into Oklahoma Cou--</i>

4
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,620
<i>They're calling all of
Oklahoma County right now....</i>

5
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,457
Jo common.

6
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:10,298
-What is it, Mommy?
-We have to get up.

7
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,219
We must go to the storm cellar!

8
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,139
What's happening?

9
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:15,099
Come on, sweetie.

10
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:17,020
Hurry!

11
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,890
Mommy's got you.

12
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,811
TV says it's big.

13
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,362
We're going to the storm cellar.

14
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:30,442
We must move! Hand her to me!

15
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:34,993
Come on! Let's move.

16
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:41,715
Go to the center of your
house if there's no cellar.

17
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:51,297
My Lord!

18
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:55,378
Come on!

19
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,298
We're almost there!

20
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:59,218
Take her! Take her!

21
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,859
I'll get the door!

22
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,970
-Get in!
-Hurry!

23
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,890
It's coming!

24
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:07,850
Quick!

25
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,411
Light the lamp!

26
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:17,452
Daddy! Toby's still outside!

27
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,373
Toby, come on, boy!

28
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:20,313
Good boy!

29
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:24,874
It's okay, Toby.

30
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:33,756
Grab Jo!

31
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:38,307
Daddy!

32
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,028
Take Jo!

33
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,890
God!

34
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,731
I can't hold it.

35
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,572
Jesus! Oh, God!

36
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:05,172
I can't hold it!

37
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:29,147
Stay with me, Jo!

38
00:04:58,404 --> 00:05:04,645
At 7 a.m. in Oklahoma City,
the temperature is 75 degrees.

39
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:15,427
Look, caps are already
starting to break.

40
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:20,228
All the models are forecasting
lifted indices from -6 to -10.

41
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:25,019
If the cells keep building, there could be
a record outbreak of tornados.

42
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,580
This is going to be a long day.

43
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:56,676
Are you sure she'll be there?

44
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,557
If I know Jo, she's already dragged
her department into the field.

45
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:04,358
Day like today, it's to be expected.
She forgets everything except work.

46
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,318
You're nervous.

47
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:07,228
Nervous?

48
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,188
No.

49
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:10,109
Do I look nervous?

50
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,069
No.

51
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:14,900
Well, yeah, you do a little. You know.

52
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,860
I want to get it over with.

53
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,741
She said she signed the papers?

54
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,661
That's what she said.

55
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,532
You don't think so?

56
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:25,452
I think so.

57
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:29,053
Give me a kiss.

58
00:06:33,374 --> 00:06:38,645
Okay, Professor! Hang on there.
I think I fixed it.

59
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,795
I got it.

60
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,716
Fuck me! This thing is useless!

61
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:46,316
Sorry!

62
00:06:46,796 --> 00:06:47,517
Wait, wait!

63
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:50,397
Good! Give me a reading!

64
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:55,188
Okay, boss lady, hold your horses.

65
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,109
Which way do you want it?

66
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:59,029
The dry line is stalled.

67
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:06,471
Scan WNW, look at mid-levels for
rotation, and increase the P.R.F.

68
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,571
If I mistreat you girl

69
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:14,132
Sure don't mean no harm

70
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:23,014
All I'm saying is, don't fold the maps.

71
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:24,925
I didn't.

72
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,805
Kansas is a mess. There's a
big crease through Wichita.

73
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:32,366
Roll the maps.

74
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:37,167
The storm chasers.

75
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:41,228
Who's that handsome devil?

76
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,148
Gentlemen.

77
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:46,989
The Extreme! It's the Extreme!

78
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,870
Don't start that shit.

79
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,661
A manly handshake ensues.
How you doing, man?

80
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,581
I'm doing great.

81
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:59,462
Oh, man!

82
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:03,303
I'd like you to meet Melissa.
This is Dusty.

83
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:07,133
Dustman's been chasing
with us since we started.

84
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,054
Listen...

85
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:10,964
...where's Jo?

86
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,845
She's by the Doppler.

87
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,725
Broke down again.
Running out of grant money.

88
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:20,566
Why don't you hang out here for a
little while. I'll be right back.

89
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:24,397
Dusty, why don't you
explain to Melissa...

90
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,238
...why you're the way you are.

91
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,118
Come on.

92
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,999
Man, Jo's going to wig
when she sees he's back.

93
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,909
I'm not back.

94
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,510
The prodigal son returns.

95
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:46,222
Hi, Joey.

96
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:55,814
Hiya, Jo.

97
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:58,934
I'm happy you found us.

98
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:01,815
How you doing?

99
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:02,775
It's going good.

100
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:06,606
You see the sky today?

101
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,526
She's really talking.

102
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,447
Catch.

103
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:15,238
It's the biggest series of storms in
12 years. One lined up after another.

104
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,158
N.S.S.L.'s never seen anything like it.

105
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:20,039
Is that right? So, Jo,
about the divorce papers--

106
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,959
Do you have a sec?

107
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:25,550
Excuse me.

108
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,710
This thing's acting up again.

109
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,631
The focus mount's jammed.

110
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:32,511
There's grass in the auto-focus.

111
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,462
Should I clean it?

112
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:36,342
Not unless you want to sketch tornados.

113
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:37,302
Welcome back.

114
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,183
I'm not back.

115
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,014
You want the papers?

116
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:45,934
I came here for them.

117
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:47,855
They're signed and ready.

118
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:48,815
Good. Let's see them.

119
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,735
Right now?

120
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:51,695
That'd be nice.

121
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:54,576
What's the urgent urgency?
You act like you're getting married.

122
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:58,167
I am.

123
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:08,959
Is it Melinda?

124
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:09,919
Melissa.

125
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,830
Wasn't there a Melinda somewhere?

126
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,750
There's only been Melissa since you.

127
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,631
Not much for browsing, are you?

128
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,231
I guess I'm not.

129
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:24,072
There you go.

130
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:39,656
You missed a page.

131
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:43,246
Right here.

132
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:49,968
Where'd this come from?

133
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:52,128
What're you doing?

134
00:10:52,368 --> 00:10:54,049
Can I read it first?

135
00:10:54,289 --> 00:10:55,969
It's the same as December.

136
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:56,929
I didn't read it then.

137
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:00,750
Christ, would you sign it
so we can get out of here?

138
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,710
Please.

139
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,631
"We?" She's here?

140
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,471
She's with Dusty. Now,
please, sign the document.

141
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:09,392
With Dusty? What's wrong with you?

142
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:11,312
I want to meet her.

143
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:12,272
No, you don't.

144
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:16,103
Christ.

145
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,984
The suck zone.

146
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,864
It's the point...

147
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:24,745
...basically at which the twister...

148
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:25,705
...sucks you up.

149
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:30,486
That's not the technical
term for it, obviously.

150
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:31,447
I'm Jo Harding.

151
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:33,367
Nice to meet you.

152
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,287
Bill told me the happy news.

153
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:38,168
-Which?
-Us. Marriage. Jo, Melissa.

154
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,088
It's happy news.

155
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:42,009
I guess it seems sudden.

156
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:42,959
Sudden?

157
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,840
Dude, you're taking the vows?
That's sweet.

158
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,680
We wanted to get it done before
Billy started his new job.

159
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,601
That's right. Weatherman.

160
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,521
What?

161
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:54,481
-Don't say it.
-I said, weatherman.

162
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:56,402
-It's great.
-You have that tone.

163
00:11:56,642 --> 00:11:58,312
If you have a problem--

164
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:03,823
I don't have a problem
being a weatherman.

165
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,944
Dr. Melissa Reeves.

166
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,864
Very nice to meet you.

167
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,465
You too.

168
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,496
New truck?

169
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,456
That's right.

170
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,337
Boy, oh, boy. New job...

171
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:23,257
...new truck...

172
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:25,178
...new wife. It's a whole new you.

173
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,088
This is awkward.

174
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:28,048
Tell me.

175
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,959
I thought you'd come alone.

176
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,879
You said you'd meet me--

177
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,800
It's about Dorothy.

178
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,720
Dorothy?

179
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,601
What about her?

180
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,481
She's here.

181
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:45,072
Show me.

182
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,785
I can't believe you did it.

183
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,655
We built 4.

184
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:04,256
She work?

185
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:16,009
Thought you'd want to be
here for her first time out.

186
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:19,849
It wouldn't be right
if you weren't here.

187
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,730
This is going to be good!

188
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,601
How sweet is that?

189
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,521
It's Bill's concept.

190
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,392
The Extreme. It came from his brain.

191
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:32,312
I had a hand in it.

192
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:35,193
It is great.

193
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,113
What is it?

194
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:40,954
It's an instrument pack for studying
tornados. First one in history.

195
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:41,914
It's very exciting.

196
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,785
Scientists have studied
tornados forever...

197
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,665
...but nobody knows
how a tornado works.

198
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,586
We don't know what happens inside...

199
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:53,416
...because nobody can take
measurements inside the funnel.

200
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:56,297
That's what she's going to do.

201
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:57,257
How?

202
00:13:57,497 --> 00:14:00,128
We put her up inside a tornado.

203
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,768
She opens...

204
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,849
...and releases hundreds
of these sensors...

205
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,690
...that measure all parts of
the tornado simultaneously.

206
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,571
You see, it's like this:

207
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,441
These sensors go up the funnel
and radio back information...

208
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:20,282
...about the internal structure,
wind velocities....

209
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:23,153
We'll learn more in 30 seconds
than in the last 30 years.

210
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:25,073
Get a profile for the first time.

211
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:26,994
What will that do?

212
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,834
If we know how tornados work,
we can design a warning system.

213
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,745
Aren't there warnings already?

214
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,625
-The civil defence--
-They're not good enough.

215
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:36,586
Right now it's 3 minutes.

216
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:40,426
If we can get this information,
we can increase it to 15.

217
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,307
Give people a chance to get to safety.

218
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:47,858
That's what they're trying to do.

219
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,889
I can't believe you did it.

220
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:56,730
Well, we did it.

221
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,571
How do you get it in?

222
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:03,441
You get in front of it and
put it in the damage path.

223
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,362
And then get out again quickly.

224
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:08,242
That's the suck zone.

225
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:10,163
Excellent! We got major action!

226
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:16,644
N.S.S.L. says the cap is breaking,
towers are going up 30 miles.

227
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,705
Let's go.

228
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:21,665
We're moving!

229
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:23,585
It's fatty time!

230
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:25,506
Laptop.

231
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:30,067
We're waiting! Let's go!

232
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:34,858
Joey, Haynes, a little help!

233
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:42,780
Smooth.

234
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,700
There's Dusty!

235
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,561
Come on! You're always last!
Let's go!

236
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:51,401
We're going third. Preacher follow.

237
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,362
Get the camera!

238
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:53,322
I got it!

239
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:57,163
They can handle this.
They know what they're doing.

240
00:15:57,403 --> 00:16:00,043
This is what they do.

241
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,003
They live for this.

242
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,914
Dorothy 2 & 3 ready.

243
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:04,834
Dorothy 4 ready.

244
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,715
Sure you don't want to go?

245
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:09,635
Go with them?

246
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,236
No, they'll be fine.

247
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,347
-Did she sign the papers?
-Shit!

248
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:17,297
She didn't?

249
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,217
Hurry. We can catch them!

250
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:21,138
Glad you're back!

251
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:23,058
I'm not back!

252
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,018
Rabbit.

253
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,939
Yeah, boss?

254
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,500
Can we do better than the 30?

255
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,531
Not for a while. It's best to stay
on it until we pass the creek.

256
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,411
Copy that.

257
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:41,292
Once we catch up to them,
take the truck and go home.

258
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:45,123
I'll get them signed, see you tonight.

259
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:50,634
This is interesting.
I'm going to tag along.

260
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:07,187
Jonas! Son-of-a-bitch!

261
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,108
Who is that?

262
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:11,988
Jonas Miller. He's a night crawler.

263
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:16,779
We all started out in the same lab, then
Jonas got himself corporate sponsors.

264
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,650
He's in it for the money,
not the science.

265
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,570
He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets.

266
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,411
But he's got no instincts.

267
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:29,972
And he doesn't have Dorothy.

268
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:35,723
I think we have fleas.

269
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:38,844
Jo, come back.

270
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:40,764
You change your mind?

271
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:45,315
Yeah. Why's Jonas here?

272
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:49,386
I'm not sure.

273
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:54,907
I bet he's asking himself
the same thing about you.

274
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,708
Shit! Hold on!

275
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:05,460
God damn! Son-of-a-bitch!

276
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,411
This essentially was a false alarm.

277
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:16,972
The radar appeared solid.

278
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:21,043
-How long till it's fixed?
-10 minutes, 15 tops.

279
00:18:21,283 --> 00:18:22,963
Sounds good.

280
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,844
What drives me is the unknown.

281
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,725
What if we could predict
the tornado's path?

282
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,605
How many lives would be spared
by an early warning system?

283
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:33,526
And D.O.T. 3...

284
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:34,476
...is the answer.

285
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:39,987
The first digital
orthographic telemeter.

286
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:45,028
Inside, she holds hundreds
of these sensors which...

287
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:49,829
...when released into the tornado,
transmit back data on wind speed...

288
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:51,739
...pressure and dew point temperature.

289
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,660
Why didn't you tell me?

290
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,540
Don't.

291
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,421
And what will soon be the
center for all studies.

292
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,341
You shit!

293
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,222
Think I wouldn't find out?!

294
00:19:04,462 --> 00:19:06,132
Get him off me!

295
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:08,053
What's wrong?

296
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:09,003
What's the matter?

297
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:11,884
You stole my design, you bastard!

298
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:13,804
What do you mean?!

299
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:17,645
Dorothy. You took her, you damn thief!

300
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:21,476
Oh, I get it. You want to
take credit for my design.

301
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,396
You're a liar.

302
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:25,316
She was our idea.

303
00:19:25,557 --> 00:19:27,237
Unrealised idea.

304
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:28,197
Unrealised.

305
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:31,078
That ain't worth shit unless it flies!

306
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:33,958
Guys! Guys! All my guys,
get a grip on yourself.

307
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:36,829
We both know he'll never
get it up in the air.

308
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,660
Well, let me enlighten you people!

309
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,580
This baby has satellite comlink.

310
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,461
We got on-board pulse Doppler.

311
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,381
We got Nexrad real time.

312
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,252
We're going to make history.

313
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:52,172
So stick around.

314
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:55,053
The days of sniffing the dirt are over.

315
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,013
Better than what you sniff.

316
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,894
We'll see who gets there first, pal.

317
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,814
By the way...

318
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:04,655
...l really enjoy your weather reports.

319
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,565
You slime!

320
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,436
Come here!

321
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:13,037
Get off!

322
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:18,798
He's a corporate kiss-butt.

323
00:20:20,238 --> 00:20:22,869
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

324
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:23,829
One day.

325
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:27,670
I'll give you one day.
Whether she flies or not, I'm gone.

326
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,590
Honey?

327
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,550
Is everything okay?

328
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,471
-Everything's fine.
-Are you sure?

329
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:35,341
Yeah, everything's okay.

330
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:40,132
I'm going to hang out here.
Why don't you get us some cold drinks?

331
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,733
Okay, sweetheart.

332
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:12,749
Jo, I don't know what's wrong
with Bill. He's wacko. He's crazy.

333
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:13,709
You ought to get a leash on him.

334
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:15,630
He's your problem, not mine.

335
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,471
This storm's going to be a lot
bigger than we anticipated.

336
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,301
I got reports of mesos from
Grand County to Logan.

337
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,182
Sharing information with me?

338
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:30,023
No, I was curious as to which
way you were going to head.

339
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:32,893
Southeast, I think.

340
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:34,814
To the counter.

341
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:39,365
Two lemonades to go, please.

342
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:43,446
-Nothing changes.
-Pardon me?

343
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,366
He'll wait and see what Bill does.

344
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,247
May I have a coffee to go?

345
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:52,798
That man is waiting for Bill?
Why?

346
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:21,824
You're telling me that Billy
knows what a storm is thinking?

347
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:25,654
Something like that. Gum?

348
00:22:25,895 --> 00:22:28,535
My aunt called him a human barometer.

349
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:31,406
He hasn't really told me about all this.

350
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:38,837
If you must pee, do it now. There's not
many places to stop on the road.

351
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:44,598
You're still in love with him.

352
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,600
Check, please.

353
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,520
Not that I blame you.

354
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,982
I hope this isn't a desperate
attempt to keep him in your life.

355
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,783
We're together.

356
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,615
Hey, man.

357
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:17,215
What's up?

358
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:20,336
Going green.

359
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,296
Greenage.

360
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:24,177
-Saddle them up.
-You got it, boss.

361
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:27,998
I need a sector scan on that cell.
Keep looking for a hook.

362
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,918
What are my dew points doing?

363
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,838
Points up to 70, sir.

364
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:32,799
I got a lemonade.

365
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,639
We must go. Follow us in the
truck, but stay behind Dusty.

366
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,470
You'll be safe there. I must go with Jo.
Let's move out, people!

367
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,071
Where are we going?

368
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:51,753
Thanks, I'll drive.

369
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:57,494
Let's pack it up. Let's go.

370
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:12,847
It's a wonder of nature baby!

371
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,713
Hey, you guys!

372
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:04,888
Dr. Melissa Reeves here.

373
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,808
Hello, Donald.

374
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:11,359
No, you got me in my car.

375
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,520
Oklahoma

376
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,361
Where the wind comes
sweeping down the plain

377
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,321
And the waving wheat

378
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:23,112
This feeling of inadequacy is coming
from you. Julia doesn't resent you.

379
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:25,983
We've talked about this before.

380
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,863
She did not marry your penis.

381
00:25:29,103 --> 00:25:35,344
Okay. All right.
She didn't only marry your penis.

382
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:38,465
So?

383
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,386
So...

384
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:42,296
Amazing coloring there, isn't it?

385
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:44,216
Look at the mammatas.

386
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:47,097
Those tops have got to be
spiking about 40,000 feet.

387
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:51,888
-It's a good thing.
-It's a very good thing.

388
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,808
You met her at the station?

389
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:56,689
-I don't want to fight.
-I'm not fighting. I'm talking.

390
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:00,280
I don't want to fight.

391
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,400
She's nice.

392
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,321
She's not nice?

393
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:07,241
-I know what you meant.
-You do?

394
00:26:07,481 --> 00:26:08,201
Don't do this.

395
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,992
I'm making civilised conversation here.
You're biting my head off.

396
00:26:13,232 --> 00:26:14,913
Jesus.

397
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:17,793
Yes, she's very nice.

398
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:23,305
No, she does not work at the station.

399
00:26:23,785 --> 00:26:28,096
She's a therapist.

400
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:33,137
Yours?

401
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:35,057
You couldn't resist it.

402
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:37,938
I'm not saying you need therapy.

403
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:39,858
Wait. I need therapy?

404
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,818
I didn't say that.

405
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,739
Why would I need a therapist?

406
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,609
-I don't know.
-You're the doctor.

407
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:48,480
I don't know...

408
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
...inability to finish things.

409
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,281
Maybe rushing into things
you can't quite commit to.

410
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:54,241
You asked me.

411
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,162
You asked me!

412
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:59,992
Bullshit! I may have walked out, but at
least I showed up in the first place!

413
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:02,873
-You never had an idea.
-There's a road thing going on.

414
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:05,754
You never knew what
being married means...

415
00:27:05,994 --> 00:27:10,555
...like stability and supportiveness
and a house and neat stuff like that!

416
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,515
I'll drive.

417
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,145
Then would you?

418
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:19,897
Goddamn.

419
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:23,977
Someone should warn
her about your temper.

420
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:25,898
She obviously has no idea.

421
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:28,768
Stay out of it. I know what I'm doing.

422
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:29,729
What are you doing?

423
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,609
They're getting better at this.

424
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:34,530
You know what? If you're happy...

425
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,450
Thank you.

426
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,331
I am happy. I'm a happy person.

427
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:43,161
I'm happy with the way
things are going in my life.

428
00:27:43,402 --> 00:27:46,032
-I'm happy with-with-with--
-Melissa?

429
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:47,952
I know her name! Yes, with Melissa.

430
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:49,873
You look happy.

431
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:50,833
I am!

432
00:27:51,073 --> 00:27:55,394
Shit. Shit!

433
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,465
You going to wrap this up soon?

434
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:00,425
What?

435
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:04,266
Are we going to chase this tornado or
do you want to catch the next one?

436
00:28:04,506 --> 00:28:07,147
Shit!

437
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:10,027
-Is it on the ground?
-I got it.

438
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:13,628
Easy.

439
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,331
Bear right. It's on an easterly course.

440
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:31,122
The Weather Service has issued
a tornado warning till 11 a.m.

441
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:33,042
Dr. Miller?

442
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:34,962
I think they turned left.

443
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:38,563
Do it.

444
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:44,544
We'll intercept. Get ready to set up.

445
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:49,105
You got it.

446
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:57,987
-Get further ahead of it.
-I know what I'm doing.

447
00:28:58,227 --> 00:28:58,947
Cut across.

448
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:00,858
-Get into that field.
-I'll get ahead of it.

449
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:02,778
Want to drive?

450
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:05,659
-Would you like to drive?
-I'd love to.

451
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:11,180
Distances are about 3 miles south-east.
Let's see what she does.

452
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:14,291
Go in there.

453
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,201
You'll miss it.

454
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:18,121
Hold on a second.

455
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:21,722
Lost your nerve?

456
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:25,563
Tighten your seat belt.

457
00:29:28,924 --> 00:29:34,195
Where are you? We lost visual.

458
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:40,196
Having fun?

459
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:41,146
We must get out of this.

460
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:44,747
Really?

461
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,858
2 miles. Picking up speed.

462
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:49,778
Sometime this week would be good.

463
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:53,379
I'm trying.

464
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,579
You mad?

465
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,460
I will be later. Now I'm
trying not to kill us.

466
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,931
Funnel's getting thicker!
It's moving fast! Coming towards you!

467
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,012
It's turning!

468
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,922
-I can't see it.
-You will!

469
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:12,803
You're too close! It won't work!
Get out!

470
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:16,634
Oh, shit!

471
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:19,514
It's too steep.

472
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:24,075
This was a great idea!

473
00:30:34,148 --> 00:30:36,788
That wasn't so bad. Let's go!

474
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:41,339
Why can't we spend a
normal day together?

475
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,380
We're in the damage path!
This is crazy! Forget it!

476
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,251
-No, it's going to hit us!
-We can still do this!

477
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:54,772
There's no time! Come on! Come on!

478
00:30:56,212 --> 00:30:57,893
Grab hold of something!

479
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:01,483
I know!

480
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:12,276
What are you doing?!

481
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,236
I want to see it!

482
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,156
Come back!

483
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:18,747
Come on!

484
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:33,140
Look out!

485
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:04,787
Oh, God.

486
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:09,828
Oh, my God!

487
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:11,748
It's gone.

488
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,629
It's gone.

489
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:18,219
Where's my truck?

490
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,221
There it is.

491
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:26,141
Oh, God!

492
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:29,742
Are you okay?

493
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:31,902
Are you okay?

494
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:33,803
You just missed that truck!

495
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:34,763
Awesome!

496
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,644
That's awesome!

497
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,564
Oh, God, Billy!

498
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:41,484
Are you okay?

499
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:43,405
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

500
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:45,325
She just missed the truck.

501
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:47,246
What happened to you?

502
00:32:47,486 --> 00:32:51,076
Nothing, we're okay. We were safe.

503
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,997
It's trashed.

504
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:53,957
Hang on.

505
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:58,758
It's over. It's over. It's all over.

506
00:32:58,998 --> 00:33:01,639
Are you okay?

507
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:06,180
She's okay.

508
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,181
There is some good news.

509
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:15,782
It did fly.

510
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:18,892
What was it like?

511
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:20,813
It was windy.

512
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:21,773
Windy.

513
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,693
That's intense.

514
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:25,614
Move it.

515
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:26,574
That's intense.

516
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:30,415
The Auto Club's here.

517
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:35,196
Maybe we should stop,
see if they need help.

518
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:37,116
They're fine.
Pay attention to the road.

519
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:40,957
You're fashionably late again.

520
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:42,877
Give me a kiss.

521
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:46,718
Get out of here! Get out of here!

522
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,639
Loser!

523
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:49,589
Find your own twister!

524
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,509
Losers!

525
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:54,390
Move on!

526
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,270
Tough luck, you guys!

527
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,191
Let's go.

528
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:02,061
I'll get them clean.
Let's get Dorothy 2 ready.

529
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:04,932
You got full coverage on that truck?

530
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:07,813
Liability only.

531
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:12,374
Liability only.

532
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:15,494
It's a pretty truck.

533
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:20,045
Thank you.

534
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:25,086
Don't even think about it.

535
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:29,637
No way.

536
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:37,309
This is the caboose! This is the
caboose! I'm waiting for orders.

537
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:39,469
Go ahead.

538
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:42,350
-It's your truck.
-No, you should.

539
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,230
The battle zone should
be north-east of 81 .

540
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:47,151
The battle zone?

541
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:48,111
What're we doing?

542
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:50,031
We're going again.

543
00:34:50,272 --> 00:34:52,902
But back there you almost got killed!

544
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:54,822
Just a close call.

545
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:58,653
You're going to cross 15
at Oklahoma 412. 412.

546
00:34:58,893 --> 00:35:01,534
Copy that. Haynes,
what's on the Mesonet?

547
00:35:01,774 --> 00:35:06,085
Winds are continuing to back.

548
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:10,886
Okay, guys, lets go get it.

549
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:55,245
Mobile lab.

550
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:58,126
Is it me, or is the
main updraft shifting?

551
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:01,006
Upper-level winds are veering.

552
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:03,887
It might dissipate. Do we have
time to get in front of it?

553
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:08,678
Rotation is increasing. Shear is
90 knots. 50 outbound, 40 inbound.

554
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,559
We see a very pronounced hook.

555
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,479
Checking for you now.

556
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:16,360
We're getting south-east
gusts at 40 miles per hour.

557
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,280
Approaching 150 in the funnel.

558
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,111
Storm motion is 225 degrees
out of the south-west.

559
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:26,662
We're in position. Proceed.

560
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,375
Howdy!

561
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:43,936
Must admire their spirit.

562
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,657
There's your pal.

563
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:58,319
What're you doing?

564
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,360
Look at the updraft.

565
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,320
The angle.

566
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,240
It's going to shift course.

567
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,151
You sure?

568
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:10,071
It's definitely a sidewinder.

569
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,031
It'll move left.

570
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,952
-Is that bad?
-Was there a road?

571
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:16,552
You're right! Go!

572
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:39,807
Donald, now's not a good time.

573
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:44,368
All right, put Julia on, Donny.

574
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:48,449
Looking very good.

575
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:54,910
About a 4 miles up, hang a right,
let's deploy and we'll be done.

576
00:37:56,351 --> 00:37:58,031
Shit!

577
00:37:58,271 --> 00:38:00,912
Shit, it's moving away!

578
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:05,473
Looks like they'll intercept.

579
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:14,105
You told me this thing was going
to stay on the same heading!

580
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,265
We're close.

581
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:18,185
I know.

582
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,096
Where does this road take us?

583
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:22,976
It feels unnatural, but
with Donald's motility...

584
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:27,767
...you won't have a baby the usual
way, even standing on your head.

585
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:30,648
She's a reproductive therapist.

586
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,568
Laurence-- Damn.

587
00:38:32,808 --> 00:38:36,409
We must get ahead of this storm.

588
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:37,369
Be right with you.

589
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,240
I can't talk now. I'll call you back.

590
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,121
South. Shifting due south, copy.

591
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:46,961
We have an F-2, ladies and
gentlemen. Possibly F-3.

592
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:52,713
Read me? There's very, very large
rope on the ground. Very large.

593
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:56,543
It looks like it's turning.
The atmosphere is unstable.

594
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:57,504
Repeat, unstable!

595
00:38:57,744 --> 00:38:58,464
This is Rabbit!

596
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:01,344
It's heading this way!

597
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:02,305
This is Sanders.

598
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:06,146
We are driving due east on a
road we've been on for 6 miles.

599
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,937
We've got an F-3 sitting here
on the ground. A beauty!

600
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:12,857
Jo, it's Barn Burner!

601
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:14,777
It won't hang out long!

602
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:15,738
It's not hanging out.

603
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,288
We got it! We see it!

604
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:29,881
We're getting slammed in here.
You better hang back.

605
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:47,144
-Is this thing loaded?
-Yeah, go for it.

606
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:48,344
Rain bands.

607
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:49,305
Look at the surf.

608
00:39:49,545 --> 00:39:53,866
Shit, horizontal rain! Hang on!

609
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:00,817
Jesus, I've never seen
clutter like this.

610
00:40:01,057 --> 00:40:02,737
I don't think anyone has.

611
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:07,298
Flash frequencies are high.

612
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:13,050
We're in the core.

613
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:18,081
We got sisters!

614
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:21,681
Oh, my God.

615
00:40:22,162 --> 00:40:23,842
Julia, I can't talk now.

616
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:26,712
-We're under the flanking line.
-I realise that.

617
00:40:26,953 --> 00:40:29,593
We can't attack from the south.
We'll get rolled.

618
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,474
Watch me.

619
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:39,915
I know you're upset. You just must
breathe. We both got to breathe.

620
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:43,976
Cow.

621
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:49,497
I must go, Julia! We got cows!

622
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:53,578
Another cow!

623
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:57,169
I think it was the same one.

624
00:40:57,649 --> 00:40:59,329
We got drunkards. We got no path!

625
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:00,290
Get us out of here!

626
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,851
-I'm trying!
-Floor it!

627
00:41:09,171 --> 00:41:12,512
Look out!

628
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:26,905
Oh, God! Oh, God!

629
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:54,971
See that carousel? Did you see?

630
00:41:55,211 --> 00:41:59,522
It was incredible.

631
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:09,114
Oh, honey--honey--

632
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:14,145
Did you see that?

633
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:17,986
It's all right. Come on, it's okay.

634
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:23,507
No, I'm not okay. This is not okay.

635
00:42:24,947 --> 00:42:27,578
Oh, Christ, I'm sorry.

636
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:29,498
Honey, I didn't think.

637
00:42:29,738 --> 00:42:33,339
When you used to tell me
that you chased tornados...

638
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:38,130
...deep down I always
thought it was a metaphor.

639
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,051
It's okay. It's okay.

640
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,881
Three times a lady!
Did you see the inflow jets?

641
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,762
See?! I was in the middle of it!

642
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:50,603
I'm thinking it might not
be too bad of an idea...

643
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,483
...if we left, because there
was too many tornados there.

644
00:42:53,723 --> 00:42:58,284
Are you kidding? This thing's not over.
We've only seen the start.

645
00:42:58,515 --> 00:42:59,235
You know...

646
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:02,115
...we're close to Wakita.

647
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:04,996
Aunt Meg wouldn't mind a pit stop.

648
00:43:05,236 --> 00:43:06,906
We crave sustenance.

649
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:10,747
Guys, we are not invading my aunt.

650
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:11,707
Food.

651
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:14,578
Food.

652
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:20,099
We're absolutely not going.

653
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:30,891
There's the spot. Just do it.

654
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:34,492
Great.

655
00:43:44,564 --> 00:43:48,155
Come on, honey.

656
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:49,115
Come on.

657
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:52,956
You must meet her, she's great.
Meg, how are you?

658
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,837
-How are you?
-It is so good to see you!

659
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:56,797
You too.

660
00:43:57,037 --> 00:43:58,717
The other day I told Jo...

661
00:43:58,957 --> 00:44:00,628
...how much I miss you.

662
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:03,498
You haven't seen my new work.

663
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:05,419
Oh, honey.

664
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:07,339
You've seen some action.

665
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,259
You should've seen it.

666
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:10,220
Boys!

667
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,820
Give me some loving!

668
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:23,652
In a lightning storm, grab your
ankles and stick your butt up.

669
00:44:23,893 --> 00:44:26,533
It's the safest orifice to get hit.

670
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:28,453
I'd like to get hit, see what it's like.

671
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:31,324
Real lemonade. Meg, I'm moving in!

672
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:35,875
Look out. Make a space.

673
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:46,427
Look out.

674
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:49,548
God, you got a lot of beef.

675
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:52,429
-Where'd you get this beef?
-Did you see my cows?

676
00:44:52,669 --> 00:44:56,029
No.

677
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,190
Cool.

678
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,150
You slaughter them.

679
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,011
Nice. Potatoes.

680
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,931
Grab it now.

681
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:10,412
Meg's gravy is famous.
It's practically a food group.

682
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:12,573
Shower's free.

683
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:16,164
I'm next.

684
00:45:17,604 --> 00:45:20,244
I want that.

685
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:23,125
How can you watch this garbage?

686
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:26,966
Pardon me. You must see this.

687
00:45:27,206 --> 00:45:29,836
Like for you to be out
there chasing tornados?

688
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:31,747
It's a thrill.

689
00:45:31,987 --> 00:45:34,627
Man vs. nature. Battling the elements.

690
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:36,548
What a weasel.

691
00:45:36,788 --> 00:45:40,389
As a scientist, can you
actually predict tornados now?

692
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:42,309
No, they're unpredictable...

693
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:45,190
...as my unfortunate
colleagues found out today.

694
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,020
But we hope to change all that
with a system I have devised.

695
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,941
God, he sucks.

696
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:51,901
Shut up!

697
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:53,821
Turn him off.

698
00:45:54,062 --> 00:45:54,782
What a wiener.

699
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:58,612
He's so in love with himself.
I thought it was a summer thing.

700
00:45:58,853 --> 00:46:00,533
He'll rue the day.

701
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:03,404
He'll rue the day he came
up against The Extreme.

702
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:05,324
-Hear, hear.
-Amen, baby.

703
00:46:05,564 --> 00:46:08,205
Bill, I'm talking imminent rue-age.

704
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:11,085
Imminent rue-age.

705
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:14,926
I was just wondering, why do
you call Billy "The Extreme"?

706
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,797
'Cause Billy is The Extreme.

707
00:46:18,037 --> 00:46:21,637
Bill's the most out-of-controllest
bastard in the game.

708
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:25,478
No, I think I came in second.

709
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:26,438
I've seen him in high gear.

710
00:46:26,678 --> 00:46:29,309
You guys must get new stories.

711
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:30,269
I'll go clean up.

712
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:32,180
So...

713
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,100
...we get this one near Daleton.

714
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,060
God!

715
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,941
We're close and Jo's got the VID on it.

716
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:39,861
She's filming it.

717
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:44,662
Suddenly, this shitty-looking green
Valiant pulls up right in the way.

718
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,583
She starts yelling and this...

719
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:51,374
...loser stumbles out of the car.
He's got a bottle of Jack Daniels.

720
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:52,334
He's naked.

721
00:46:52,574 --> 00:46:54,254
He's butt-naked.

722
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:56,165
Not naked.

723
00:46:56,405 --> 00:46:59,045
I was not naked!

724
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:00,966
He's without apparel.

725
00:47:01,206 --> 00:47:01,916
Half-naked.

726
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:07,677
Naked. So, Jo's yelling at him
to get out of the way, right?

727
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:09,597
So...

728
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:12,478
...he just strolls up to the twister...

729
00:47:12,718 --> 00:47:14,398
...and says, "Have a drink!"

730
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,279
And he chucks the bottle
into the twister and...

731
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:19,189
...it never hits the ground.

732
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,070
Twister caught it, sucked it right up.

733
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,941
Honey, this is a tissue of lies.

734
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:26,861
There was another Bill...

735
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:27,821
...an evil Bill...

736
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:29,742
...and I killed him.

737
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:33,332
I love him!

738
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:46,055
That was a good-size twister.
What was that? An F-3?

739
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:47,015
F-2.

740
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:48,926
I'm lost again.

741
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,767
It's the Fujita scale. It measures a
tornado's intensity by how much it eats.

742
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:53,717
Eats?

743
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:55,637
Destroys.

744
00:47:55,877 --> 00:47:58,518
That encounter we had was
a strong F-2, F-3, maybe.

745
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:01,398
We'll see F-4's today.

746
00:48:01,638 --> 00:48:02,359
That'd be sweet.

747
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:07,150
Four is good. Four would
relocate your house efficiently.

748
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:11,711
Is there an F-5?

749
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:14,831
What would that be like?

750
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:19,382
The finger of God.

751
00:48:20,822 --> 00:48:25,133
None of you has seen an F-5?

752
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:28,974
Just one of us.

753
00:48:38,086 --> 00:48:39,766
Forget it.

754
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:41,687
Doesn't matter what you do...

755
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:43,607
...you'll still be beautiful.

756
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,528
You're biased.

757
00:48:45,768 --> 00:48:48,408
Yes, I am.

758
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:50,319
Sounds like old times.

759
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,909
Yes, it does.

760
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:57,030
He didn't keep his part of the bargain.

761
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:58,951
Which part?

762
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:03,752
To spend his life pining for you
and die miserable and alone.

763
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:08,303
That so much to ask?

764
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:13,344
I don't know.

765
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:19,095
Bill always went his own way,
usually the same way you were going.

766
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:22,926
Seems like a long time ago.

767
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:26,526
Not so long, Jo.

768
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:31,327
He's here, isn't he?

769
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:37,079
That is so beautiful.

770
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,199
We got one!

771
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:43,080
F-3, mile outside of Parlaine!

772
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,881
This is for Garfield county,
including the city of Enid.

773
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,741
This storm has developed
in the last 15 minutes.

774
00:49:50,982 --> 00:49:55,542
Doppler radar shows that
this is an intense storm.

775
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:56,503
Ride with Dusty, okay?

776
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,423
-What's SELS say?
-Big!

777
00:49:58,663 --> 00:49:59,383
Let's go!

778
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:01,304
Where's Jonas?

779
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,224
-He's in Milston.
-30 miles away.

780
00:50:03,464 --> 00:50:05,134
-Can we beat him?
-I'm working on it.

781
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:06,095
Thanks for stopping by.

782
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:08,015
Sorry to eat and run.

783
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,896
It's what you live for.

784
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:11,856
Good to see you.

785
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:13,776
It's okay.

786
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:15,697
Tasty cow, Aunt Meg.

787
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:16,657
It's for you.

788
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:17,607
Thank you.

789
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,528
You and me, right?

790
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:20,478
Sweet.

791
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:22,398
Sweet.

792
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:23,358
Nice meeting you.

793
00:50:23,598 --> 00:50:27,919
Likewise. You better run.

794
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,080
Keys.

795
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,921
Please. You're welcome.

796
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:37,511
Hang on.

797
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:38,712
We'll go through town.

798
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:43,513
We'll take Meyers Road past the fire
station, then 132 to the 44 east.

799
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:48,064
If there's shortcuts, let us know.

800
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,871
Rabbit, time to impress me.

801
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:28,352
A mile up there's a little detour.
We'll walk in the woods.

802
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,816
It gets bumpy here, folks.

803
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:50,417
Let's get you wired.

804
00:51:55,688 --> 00:52:00,009
Excuse me.

805
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:06,730
Okay, you're on.

806
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,672
An ordinary person spends his life...

807
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:15,592
...avoiding tense situations.

808
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,512
Repo Man spends his life...

809
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:23,024
...getting into tense
situations, Beltzer!

810
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,025
What do you got?

811
00:52:29,265 --> 00:52:31,905
Turn left here toward that farm.

812
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:34,786
You sure?

813
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,617
Trust me. Rabbit is good.
Rabbit is wise.

814
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:40,537
-Mother of God.
-Jesus Christ.

815
00:52:40,777 --> 00:52:42,448
This is a field.

816
00:52:42,688 --> 00:52:45,328
I know. Keep going beyond it,
through that brush.

817
00:52:45,568 --> 00:52:48,209
See that brush right in front of you?

818
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:50,129
Yes, we see it. What's beyond that?

819
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:51,089
Beyond what?

820
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,050
Beyond what?

821
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,841
The brush! A brick wall,
a bearded lady, what?

822
00:52:57,081 --> 00:53:01,402
It's the highway!

823
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:02,602
Where's the road?

824
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:04,522
Where's the road?

825
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:08,123
It should be any moment.

826
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:16,025
Hello.

827
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:16,985
Shit.

828
00:53:17,225 --> 00:53:18,905
She's insane.

829
00:53:19,145 --> 00:53:21,786
You're insane.
You trying to kill someone?

830
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:22,746
Really?

831
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:26,577
It was nice of you to see 10
people on the road and not stop!

832
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:30,418
Very good. Let's keep
this channel clear.

833
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:34,979
Dirt bag.

834
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,230
We have to get off this road.

835
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,190
Don't guess.

836
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,070
I'm not. Make a right turn.

837
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,030
Want to drive?

838
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,630
Just turn!

839
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,300
Do we follow?

840
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,100
We do not.

841
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,090
What's he doing?

842
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,010
I don't know.

843
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:19,480
Find this road. It's like Bob's road.

844
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,600
Touchdown!

845
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,520
We have touchdown.
Tornado is on the ground.

846
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,440
Listen to this.

847
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,360
It's coming down Route 33.

848
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,280
We're on 33.

849
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,190
What's the path?

850
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,070
It's going about 35 miles an hour.

851
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,980
-Do you see this?
-I can't.

852
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,900
Where is it? Hello.

853
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,820
Where're you looking?

854
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,740
-Where?
-Direction, Rabbit.

855
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,700
North-northeast.

856
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,660
See it?

857
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,580
Got anything?

858
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,540
North-northeast, do you copy?

859
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,460
It's coming right at us.

860
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,290
Axis's gone vertical.
Sucker's really gaining strength.

861
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,210
Do you see it?

862
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,090
No.

863
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,890
We don't have a visual! Repeat!
We don't have a visual! Help us out!

864
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:03,850
Where is it?

865
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,720
I got it. It's the best
motion I've ever seen.

866
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,270
The base of this fatty's over 1/2 mile.

867
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,310
If you're going east on 7, it's coming
over the hill in a few minutes.

868
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,230
This is the one. I feel it.

869
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,150
It must be there.

870
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,030
Maybe it stalled.

871
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,950
No, I think Rabbit's right.

872
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,780
It's going to show its ugly
face right over that hill.

873
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,700
What do you think?

874
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:35,250
You going for it?

875
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,330
Time for deployment.

876
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:45,800
Oh, man. This is the
fun part, sweetheart.

877
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,640
We got hail.

878
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,200
Hail. We got hail.

879
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:04,270
Pull over.

880
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,180
That's good.

881
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,780
We got a big one!

882
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,900
Upflow, Beltzer! We have upflow.
Copy.

883
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,780
I'm checking it.

884
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,620
I'm checking. She's almost up.

885
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,540
Now, this is it.

886
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,090
I'll get her ready.

887
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,960
You see them?

888
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:35,920
You see them?

889
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,840
The red truck went toward the core!

890
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,390
Is he talking about Billy?

891
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,550
Are you okay?!

892
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,150
Yes! Keep going!

893
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,890
Beltzer, we got a view!

894
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,810
I see it!

895
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,730
Okay, I got it!

896
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:09,250
That's no moon! It's a space station!

897
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:15,010
We have debris!

898
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,260
They're in the bear cage!

899
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,180
Oh, my God!

900
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,140
Oh, my God!

901
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,060
Look at this!

902
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,980
Take a peek!

903
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,860
You can really feel it
with a telephoto lens!

904
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,780
What's wrong?

905
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,740
What's wrong?

906
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,620
You people are crazy, do you know that?

907
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,490
Are you set up? We're not
leaving till we get this.

908
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,040
And she's the craziest one of them all!

909
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,750
Okay, she's almost ready!

910
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,710
Hold on!

911
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:20,230
We're almost there! We're almost there!

912
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,220
This is fine!

913
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,180
No, a little closer!

914
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,770
A little closer!

915
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,570
Close enough.

916
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:43,490
Hurry! Get the tailgate!

917
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,410
You got it?

918
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,280
She's set. Help me get her down.

919
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,240
Hurry!

920
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,800
Let's go!

921
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,910
Hurry!

922
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,830
Damn! We got to go!

923
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,750
We can do it!

924
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,350
-Come on!
-It's stuck.

925
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,860
Look out!

926
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,440
Come on! Hurry!

927
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,200
Where'd it go?

928
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,120
Where is it?

929
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,040
What's going on?

930
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,910
I don't believe this.

931
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,870
What the hell!

932
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:49,430
What's the Doppler say?

933
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:54,220
The cone of silence.

934
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:03,090
Bill, Jo, it's over.

935
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,970
The thing was stable and then it...

936
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,890
It's gone.

937
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:11,730
-It's backbuilding!
-It's not through yet.

938
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,610
You're right. It's backbuilding.

939
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,530
We got a jumper!

940
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:18,450
It's backbuilding! Track it!

941
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,310
Yeah, Jo! Data's incomplete!

942
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:25,150
You guys should get out!

943
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,070
Bill, help! Help me!

944
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,990
We should leave.

945
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,910
-Forget the sensors!
-Help me!

946
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,830
We must get out of here now!

947
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,750
Beltzer'll see if it drops!

948
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:40,500
It's not going to drop anywhere
near us! It'll drop on us!

949
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,380
We can still do this! Wait!

950
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,300
Go back!

951
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,220
Forget it! Forget it!

952
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,730
Go back! It's not too late!

953
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,760
-Go back!
-Forget it! It's too late!

954
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,680
Help me!

955
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,600
Help me!

956
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,520
What're you doing?

957
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,440
The pack's wasted! It's over!

958
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,320
What's wrong? We can still do this!

959
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,240
Listen to you! You're obsessed!

960
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,160
You've never seen what it can do!

961
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,040
-I just saw it!
-You've never seen it!

962
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,780
You've never seen it miss this house,
miss that house and come after you.

963
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,580
Christ, Jo, is that
what you think it did?

964
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,500
You don't know.

965
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,420
Why can't you forget it?!

966
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:32,300
You don't understand.
You'll never know.

967
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,210
When's it going to be enough?

968
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:39,010
How close do you have to get?!
Talk to me! Jo, things go wrong!

969
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,850
You can't explain it!
You can't predict it!

970
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:46,690
Killing yourself won't
bring your dad back.

971
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,560
I'm sorry he died.
But it was a long time ago.

972
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,440
You've got to move on.

973
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:56,270
Stop living in the past and look
at what's right in front of you.

974
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,190
What're you saying?

975
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:01,790
Me, Jo.

976
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,820
You better come here and look at this.

977
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,900
Velocities are maxed out.
Those two cells converge....

978
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:57,420
Inbounds and outbounds have doubled.

979
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:20,140
There have been tornado sightings.

980
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,940
The latest reported just to the
north-east of Canton a few minutes ago.

981
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,780
Wait a second. I've just been handed
this--. This is official now.

982
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:35,260
A tornado has been reported moving
through Canton a few minutes ago.

983
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,720
Can I have 8 coffees to go, please?

984
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,930
Two coffees.

985
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,720
Long day.

986
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:40,710
I've been thinking about the sensors.

987
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:45,510
The way they scattered out
there today on the highway.

988
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:47,430
I'm starting to wonder...

989
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:51,260
...if the funnel'll carry them.

990
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,180
Too light?

991
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,060
I don't know. Maybe the
whole thing's too light.

992
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,620
What can we do?

993
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:03,740
I'm not sure.

994
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,610
This is a very dangerous situation.

995
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:10,440
If you have loved ones in the
area do not try to help them.

996
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:15,000
You'll only be a hindrance to them.

997
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,840
Thank you.

998
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:31,730
Shit. Jesus, it's coming.

999
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:38,690
It's coming! It's headed right for us!

1000
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,600
It's already here.

1001
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,200
Everybody, underground!

1002
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,840
Honey!

1003
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,680
Come on!

1004
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:21,610
Jo, come on!

1005
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:23,770
Get underground!

1006
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:28,330
Take cover, now!

1007
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,110
Close the doors!

1008
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:43,670
Doors! Doors!

1009
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,550
Come on!

1010
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,460
Come back!

1011
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:55,420
Take my hand!

1012
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,290
Take my hand!

1013
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:02,130
Come on, hurry!

1014
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:06,930
Come on! Get in here! Get in here!

1015
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:11,480
Go, go, go! Come on!

1016
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,560
Everyone down in the pit!

1017
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,520
Get down!

1018
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,400
Everybody down!

1019
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,960
Move!

1020
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,770
Stay calm!

1021
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:11,910
I got it.

1022
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:23,660
It's okay!

1023
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,570
My head.

1024
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:27,490
You're okay.

1025
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:30,370
-It's not okay!
-It'll be over soon!

1026
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,290
This is insane!

1027
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:34,210
Stay calm!

1028
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:39,730
This is driving me crazy!
I don't want to do this!

1029
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:14,260
It's okay, honey.
It's going to be okay.

1030
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,920
Chewed my lips off wondering
if he was coming back home.

1031
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,800
I've never been so
frightened in my life.

1032
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,760
Was I on key?

1033
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,720
You were.

1034
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,270
Wow, that's a wonder.

1035
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:23,310
Look at the truck. It's trashed.

1036
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:36,020
Of course, tornado activity continues.

1037
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,860
Reports from Fairview indicate
a drive-in was blown away.

1038
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,740
We know there's injuries
and the damage is massive.

1039
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:45,620
Is that what it was like up on the hill?

1040
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,540
That? No.

1041
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,450
We were lucky.

1042
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:54,240
Those were just downdrafts
and microbursts.

1043
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,080
The tornado just sideswiped us.

1044
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,960
Which way is it headed?

1045
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,520
It's banking north-east.

1046
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,230
It looks to hit Wakita.

1047
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,140
I'm going. I'm going. Let's go.

1048
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:21,100
We're going!

1049
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,020
Get me a route around the storm.

1050
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,940
Light up! Let's go!

1051
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:25,900
Wait!

1052
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:26,850
Where's the phone?

1053
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,730
-The lines are down.
-I'm going.

1054
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:31,650
Damn it.

1055
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:32,610
I'll drive.

1056
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:37,410
We can jump on the 38 exchange
and cross Highway 132.

1057
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,330
Honey, it's Meg. I got to go.

1058
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,250
I'm going back.

1059
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:43,170
Good. You'll be safe at the motel.

1060
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:46,030
See you in the morning.

1061
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,910
I won't be there.

1062
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:50,830
What?

1063
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:52,750
Why?

1064
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:54,670
What do you mean?

1065
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:57,550
I'm saying good-bye.

1066
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:01,390
You know what?
I can't compete with this.

1067
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:03,300
I don't know where to start.

1068
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,220
Don't do this now.

1069
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:10,740
Sooner or later it would have ended.
We both know that.

1070
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:14,810
The funny thing is...

1071
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,730
...I'm not that upset.

1072
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:19,610
What does that mean?

1073
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:24,160
We can do it! Come on! Let's move!

1074
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,280
I didn't mean it to happen.

1075
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,200
Billy, I know.

1076
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,080
It's okay.

1077
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,680
Come on.

1078
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,840
You go ahead.

1079
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,720
She needs you.

1080
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:43,580
I hope Aunt Meg's okay.

1081
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,500
What about you?

1082
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,420
Don't worry about me.

1083
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,980
I know my way home.

1084
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:56,060
We can be to Wakita in an hour.

1085
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,650
Come on.

1086
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:15,960
Oh, my God.

1087
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:26,510
They had no warning.

1088
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,080
Jo, wait!

1089
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,670
Wait!

1090
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:18,300
Careful, this house could go any second.

1091
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,940
Take a flashlight.

1092
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:33,650
This whole place is ready to go.

1093
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:40,360
Careful.

1094
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,320
Did you hear that?

1095
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:51,870
-I heard something.
-Easy.

1096
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:57,630
Careful.

1097
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,330
She's down here!

1098
01:17:10,570 --> 01:17:15,850
Meg, we're here! We're coming down!

1099
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,930
Get this off her.

1100
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:20,890
Hang on.

1101
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:22,810
Don't move.

1102
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,770
-Ready?
-Watch your head.

1103
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:24,720
Go.

1104
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,640
Go.

1105
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,560
I got it.

1106
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,480
Easy. Are you okay?

1107
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:35,040
No, I'm all right. I'm fine.

1108
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:39,830
Oh, God.

1109
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:43,900
Hurry.

1110
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:48,460
-Let's go.
-Can you walk?

1111
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:51,340
Watch out!

1112
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,090
Joey, take my watch.

1113
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:06,680
Go. Careful.

1114
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,840
We're coming out!

1115
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,800
Get an ambulance!

1116
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,680
Get an ambulance! Move it! Now!
Go!

1117
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,280
Give me the lamp.

1118
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,270
How about steak and eggs?

1119
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:26,110
-How nice you all came over.
-There you go.

1120
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:29,710
Nice and slow.

1121
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:41,450
Easy, easy.

1122
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:45,290
Grab Mose for me! I think
he's a little shaken up.

1123
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:49,850
Don't worry, I'll get him!

1124
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,970
Is she okay?

1125
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:54,890
We'll probably keep her overnight.

1126
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:55,850
Forget it.

1127
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:58,720
-I'm all right.
-You're going to the hospital.

1128
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,600
Okay, I'll go. But I'm
going to drive myself.

1129
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:06,150
Your car's in a tree around the corner.

1130
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:08,310
It's okay.

1131
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:11,910
It's okay.

1132
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,620
The F-4 that hit Wakita has
now moved to the Northeast.

1133
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:29,420
I've just gotten word in that an even
stronger tornado has started to form...

1134
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:34,200
...25 miles south where the two
storms met and combined forces.

1135
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,080
Weather Service says this is unusual.

1136
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,960
Oh, my God.

1137
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,800
Look at this. Here, look at this.

1138
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,640
We're talking about winds in
excess of 300 miles an hour.

1139
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,600
What're you doing?

1140
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,470
I want to see how you are. How is she?

1141
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:56,030
I was worried about you.

1142
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,100
-Look at this.
-It's nothing.

1143
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:04,900
He says I have a bump on the
head and maybe a broken wrist.

1144
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:05,860
Let me see that.

1145
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,650
There's nothing to see.
It doesn't hurt.

1146
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,530
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1147
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:18,330
Stop blaming yourself.
You got me out of the house.

1148
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:20,250
It's got to stop.

1149
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,170
I didn't have any warning.

1150
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:29,590
The sirens went off a few seconds before
it hit. I didn't get downstairs.

1151
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:32,710
I'm sorry.

1152
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:35,590
I was listening to the
radio and...l mean...

1153
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:37,510
You may not want to know,
but it's happening.

1154
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:43,030
N.S.S.L's predicting an F-5.

1155
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,100
It's going to happen to someone else.

1156
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,980
You go stop it.

1157
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,860
I don't know how.

1158
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,740
I think you do.

1159
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:00,530
You've been chasing these things
since you were a little kid.

1160
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:01,490
It's what you do.

1161
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:06,040
Go. Do it.

1162
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,380
You all right?

1163
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:31,940
I thought you were going with Meg.

1164
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:37,700
What is it?

1165
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,730
What is it?

1166
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:47,290
I know how to make Dorothy fly.

1167
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,950
Of course.

1168
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:02,870
Of course.

1169
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:05,750
I need every aluminium can you can find.

1170
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,670
We need cutters and duct tape.

1171
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:14,390
I want to get the last Dorothy on the
back of my truck. Both of them, now.

1172
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:17,990
We're gone!

1173
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,610
Are you ready?

1174
01:23:19,850 --> 01:23:22,480
We're good.

1175
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,400
We're good? Good.

1176
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,000
We're very good.

1177
01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:34,950
Let's go! Come on!

1178
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,830
-You get them done?
-I think so.

1179
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:41,430
Beautiful.

1180
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:53,170
Good?

1181
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,090
Great job. Be ready to record.

1182
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,010
Ready?

1183
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:57,970
Be careful.

1184
01:23:58,210 --> 01:23:59,890
Don't follow too close.

1185
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,490
You got it, boss!

1186
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:11,160
We're back in business.

1187
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,920
Come on, let's go.

1188
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,070
Half a mile more?

1189
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,950
Sounds right.

1190
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,870
I'll put her in the road.

1191
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:26,740
Won't someone hit it?

1192
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,300
Nobody'll be there.

1193
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:42,100
Hurry!

1194
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:44,730
Let's go.

1195
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,600
Okay, that's good!

1196
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,160
-Got it?
-Let's go!

1197
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,230
You in position?

1198
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,830
Ready for contact!

1199
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,750
This is it.

1200
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:16,620
It'll work.

1201
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,580
Just another minute.

1202
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:22,130
We're ready!

1203
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,730
Come on, come on, take her!

1204
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:38,680
Too light.

1205
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:42,280
No, it's not.

1206
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:48,030
-We're losing it.
-No, she can still fly.

1207
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:01,460
Get in!

1208
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:14,170
Oh, my God!

1209
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:17,760
Get us off this thing!

1210
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,480
Hurry!

1211
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,160
What is that?

1212
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:38,150
What is that?

1213
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:41,030
Hurry!

1214
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:44,620
Hurry!

1215
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,460
This is not good!

1216
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:57,090
Hurry!

1217
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:12,430
Go!

1218
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,740
Son-of-a-bitch!

1219
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,660
Jo, Bill, you all right?

1220
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:38,580
Can you guys hear me?

1221
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,490
We're okay.

1222
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:44,330
Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion?

1223
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:48,880
We saw it.

1224
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,000
This monster's moving north-east on 80!

1225
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:52,960
Copy?!

1226
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,880
This is it.

1227
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,800
Last one.

1228
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,680
Last time.

1229
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,560
Mobile lab to Mobile One.
Ground speed is increasing.

1230
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,440
The base is a mile wide.
We can't see it anymore.

1231
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,390
What's your location?

1232
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:11,180
I am right alongside her!
She's beautiful!

1233
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:16,700
We're ready to play, so pull
back and prepare to monitor.

1234
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:20,780
They had to be somewhere.

1235
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:23,660
Path is stable, copy that.

1236
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,610
Men...

1237
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,530
...this is it.

1238
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:28,450
Stay sharp back there.

1239
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:32,290
They have position.

1240
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:35,170
They could make it.

1241
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:40,680
Not unless they anchor the pack.

1242
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,790
Jonas, can you hear me?

1243
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,710
Not now.

1244
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:48,590
Jonas, listen to me.
The pack is too light.

1245
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:51,470
The twister'll toss it. Anchor it.

1246
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:54,350
Sharing valuable information, Jo.

1247
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,310
I'll consider that. Thanks.

1248
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:57,230
Listen to me!

1249
01:28:57,470 --> 01:28:59,150
What?

1250
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:01,060
Can you see them?

1251
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,020
Jonas, what's your position?

1252
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,940
Howdy, Bill.

1253
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,850
We're heading north-east, parallel...

1254
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,730
...about to pull off
ahead of it on the left.

1255
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:11,610
Hang back a minute. We got
a good view from back here.

1256
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:15,450
She could shift or track and if
she does, she'll come right at you.

1257
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:18,330
Let's do that. He'd never
put us in harm's way.

1258
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:21,200
When I want your opinion, I'll give it.

1259
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,080
Shut up, put your foot on
the gas, and stay on course.

1260
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,040
It's unbelievable!

1261
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,000
What's wrong?

1262
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,880
The base is so huge!
It must be at least a mile wide!

1263
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,800
Do you copy?

1264
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:31,760
Listen to me!

1265
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,680
Get off this frequency!

1266
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,590
She's shifting.

1267
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:39,420
Oh, my God.

1268
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:41,340
Jonas, I'm telling you!

1269
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:44,220
Eddie, I know you can hear me!

1270
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,820
Get out!

1271
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:56,450
Look out!

1272
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:23,550
Damn!

1273
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:26,430
Stupid!

1274
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:28,350
We tried.

1275
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,890
We can do nothing.

1276
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:37,930
-Yes, we can.
-Ground speed is increasing.

1277
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:43,450
Get ahead of it quickly,
or she'll bury you.

1278
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:04,790
We have debris!

1279
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:08,390
Right!

1280
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:13,180
Right!

1281
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:16,060
Left!

1282
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,100
-What now?
-I have no idea.

1283
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,980
You still with us?

1284
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:25,900
Oh, my God.

1285
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:30,440
I think we're going in.

1286
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,950
Maybe we should get off this road.

1287
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:49,870
You may be right.

1288
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:52,750
Are you okay?

1289
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:53,710
You set up?

1290
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:56,590
-We're set. You going in?
-We are.

1291
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:58,500
-You ready?
-I'm on it.

1292
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:02,100
Be careful.

1293
01:32:13,130 --> 01:32:16,490
She's up.

1294
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:22,480
Where are they?

1295
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,270
Doppler tracking is great!
Wind speed increasing!

1296
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:31,830
I've never seen anything like this.

1297
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,630
They're going to punch the core.

1298
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:49,340
Ready?

1299
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:52,220
Let me set the cruise control.

1300
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:54,140
We're good.

1301
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:56,050
On three?

1302
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:59,640
On three.

1303
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:04,440
Go!

1304
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,360
Ready?

1305
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,280
Ready.

1306
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,240
One!

1307
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,190
Two!

1308
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:19,790
Three!

1309
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,540
Go...

1310
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:32,500
...go...

1311
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:37,050
...go! Go!

1312
01:33:56,710 --> 01:33:58,390
Dorothy's flying!

1313
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,310
She's flying!

1314
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:01,270
Look!

1315
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,230
We're in!

1316
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,110
I don't believe it! We're in!

1317
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:07,030
We'll be very popular!

1318
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,950
-She's flying!
-Look at that!

1319
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:11,820
It's beautiful. It's working.
It's Christmas time.

1320
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,740
We're inside! It's working!

1321
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,620
-Dorothy did it!
-I'm getting readings!

1322
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,500
This is it! We did it, man!

1323
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:23,090
We just made history.

1324
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:27,890
You guys, it's about to shift north-east.

1325
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:31,960
You should get out of there!
Do you copy?

1326
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,520
Do you copy?

1327
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:43,240
Run!

1328
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:18,730
The barn! Come on!

1329
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:22,560
Look out!

1330
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:28,550
Here!

1331
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:33,110
Go! Hurry!

1332
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:38,870
To the barn!

1333
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:51,330
Stay down!

1334
01:35:56,610 --> 01:35:59,250
My God! Who are these people?

1335
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:02,840
I don't think so.

1336
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,640
Quick!

1337
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:20,350
Oh, my God!

1338
01:36:20,590 --> 01:36:23,940
Come on!

1339
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:31,620
Run for it!

1340
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,680
Get down!

1341
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:58,470
Come on!

1342
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:24,610
Here!

1343
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:32,050
These pipes go down at least 30 feet.
We anchor to it, we may have a chance!

1344
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,160
No good!

1345
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,760
This!

1346
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:43,550
Get in!

1347
01:37:53,620 --> 01:37:56,980
Hold on!

1348
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,920
Hang on!

1349
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,750
-You all right?
-Are you?

1350
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,540
Look at that.

1351
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:15,100
It didn't take the house.

1352
01:40:20,370 --> 01:40:22,050
We did it.

1353
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:23,010
Yeah, we did.

1354
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,930
Dorothy really flew.

1355
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:29,490
It was a good idea.

1356
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:34,530
We've got so much to do.

1357
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:36,440
I'll get grant approval
for a warning system.

1358
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:39,310
We need a bigger lab.
You must start analysing data.

1359
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:41,230
I do?

1360
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:45,070
We must generate models of the
data, and I must run the lab.

1361
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:46,990
You do the analysis, I'll run the lab.

1362
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:52,510
You're running the lab?
I don't think so.

1363
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:59,460
Do you always have to
do things the hard way?

1364
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:04,250
We got it, guys! The sensors worked!
The computers went crazy! We got data!

1365
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:07,130
It's the biggest twister on record!

1366
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:10,970
Check out that sky.

1367
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:13,830
You know what?
I think we've seen enough.
