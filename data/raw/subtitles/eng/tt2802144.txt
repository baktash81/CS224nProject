I say again, We have secured Falcon.

5
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:49,852
I will count from one to ten. Within
that you'll tell me what I wanna know.

Otherwise...

7
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,464
the number ten is the

00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:22,222
Shit.

19
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,327
Fucking missed it

20
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,431
How did I fucking miss it...

21
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:32,642
Merlin, I apologize for
putting you in this position.

22
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:34,546
You trained him well.

23
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,653
James,

24
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,532
your training is over.

Sir

28
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,684
I'll deal with this mess.

29
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:54,737
Personally.

31
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:03,206
I very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.

32
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:04,264
I hope you understand.

33
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,393
How can I understand?

34
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:07,438
You won't tell me anything!

35
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,369
I didn't even know he
wasn't with his squad.

36
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,655
I'm so sorry, I can't say more.

37
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,737
I would like to present you
with this medal of valor.

38
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:21,144
If you look closely on the
back, there's a number.

39
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:24,050
And as a more concrete
gesture of our gratitude,

40
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:25,250
we'd like to offer you a...

41
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,734
Let's call it a favor.

42
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:30,101
The nature of it is your choice.

43
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:34,002
Just tell the operator:
"Oxford's, not Brogue's".

44
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,820
And then I'll know it's you.

45
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,881
I don't want your help.

46
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:41,988
I want my husband back.

47
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,196
What's your name, young man?

48
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:52,623
Eggsy.

49
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,115
Hello, Eggsy.

50
00:03:55,123 --> 00:03:57,128
Can I see that?

51
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,437
You take care of this, Eggsy.

52
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:07,285
All right?

53
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,454
And take care of your mom too.

56
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:57,905
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

57
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,600
Oh for god's sakes, just strip it off.

58
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:04,399
I am under very strict
instructions not to hurt you.

59
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,758
Look, you've made a mistake.

60
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,672
I am university lecturer.
I've got no money.

61
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,375
This isn't about money.

62
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,072
Our boss just wants to just talk to you.

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,760
Am I meant to find that reassuring?

64
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,037
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

65
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,695
Do you like whiskey?

66
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,722
Red, get a '62 Dalmore.

67
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:25,203
Hhmm...

68
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:28,333
Honestly, this whiskey is amazing.

69
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:30,599
You will shit.

70
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,714
I suppose asking to borrow a cup
of sugar is a step too far?

71
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:18,416
Professor Arnold,

72
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:20,496
I'm here to take you home.

73
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:33,080
Hmm... 1962 Dalmore.

74
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,183
It would be a sin to spill any.

75
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,647
Don't you think?

76
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,041
Can you hold these?

77
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:22,098
Please.

78
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,161
Thank you.

79
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:43,737
Everything is clean.

80
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,213
My kind of welcome.

81
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,134
No stomach for violence.

82
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:02,824
I mean, literally.

83
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,441
I see one drop of blood, that is me..

84
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,396
Done.

85
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,846
I am like...

86
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:08,869

87
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,754
Listen, I'm so sorry...

88
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,232
you had to witness all this unpleasantness.

89
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,965
Due to our uninvited guest.

90
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:18,311
But I promise you,

91
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:21,373
By the time I find out who he works for...

92
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:26,084
you and I will be the best of friends.

93
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:34,334
To the shop, please.

94
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,654

Galahad.

97
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:16,857
The others were beginning to wonder if
we were going to have a double toast.

98
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:22,919
Gentlemen, I am thankful to say
that it's been 17 years...

99
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,411
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

100
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:31,321
Lancelot was an outstanding
agent and a true Kingsman.

101
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,024
He will be sorely missed.

102
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:35,979
To Lancelot.

103
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,849
<b>To Lancelot</b>

104
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,653
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

105
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:50,347
I want each of you to propose a candidate

106
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:52,254
and have them report to UK HQ

107
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:55,171
No later than 9 p.m. GMT.

108
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,283
Thank you.

109
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,462
Merlin.

110
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:01,664
Come in.

111
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:05,219
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries

112
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:07,922
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

113
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,478
Glasses, gentlemen. Please.

114
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,814
Uganda, 2012. Synthetic Cathinone.

115
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:18,820
You put it in the water supply
of a guerrilla army base.

116
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:22,929
Rage, cannibalism. Multiple fatalities.

117
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:26,136
Chechnya, 2013.

118
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:27,806
Insurgents turned on one another.

119
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,647
Indisputable, the work of our mercenaries
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

120
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:34,040
So what happened to Lancelot?

121
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,743
He tracked them to this
property in Argentina.

122
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,100
And while he had them under surveillance,

123
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,368
he became aware that they
had effected a kidnapping.

124
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:45,115
So he executed a solo rescue mission...
which failed.

125
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:49,377
<i><b>This is his last transmission:

126
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:52,224
- Who is he?
- Some climate change doomsayer.

127
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,898
Expounded something called Gaia theory about
the world healing itself or some such.

128
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,506
But what's curious, is
he's not actually missing.

129
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:01,710
This is Professor Arnold.

130
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,817
At Imperial College, this morning.

131
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,128
It's all yours. And don't forget
your membership proposal.

132
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,535
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time.

133
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:14,998
17 years

134
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:18,749
and still evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

135
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:22,584
Need i remind you, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man.

136
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:25,581
He was as much Kingsman material
as any of them.

137
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,701
More so.

138
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:29,769
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

139
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:34,479
Let's face it, Galahad.
Your little experiment failed.

140
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:38,404
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

141
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,104
With respect?

142
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:42,799
The world is changing.

00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,540
Oi, Oi, Eggsy.

182
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:25,221
I swear,
you're in fucking trouble.

183
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,290
Floor it, Eggsy.

184
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:45,022
Hey yeah Dean, look it's me.

185
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:47,128
Eggsy just stole my fucking car.

186
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:51,623
I've come out of the pub, He's done 15 about
donuts on my fucking face and then he's drove off.

187
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:56,924
No, I cant, He's disrespecting me
and so he's disrespecting you.

188
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,612
<i>Thickie.</i>

189
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:47,009
Foxes are vermin, cuz.
You should've driven it over.

190
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:49,113
I should've done a lot of things.

191
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,217
I'll sort this, get out of the car.

192
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,321
Get out of the fucking car.

193
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,749
Eggsy, there is no such thing
as honor among thieves.

194
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:10,559
Now you can start giving me some
names of the boys you were with...

195
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,480
Or you go down.

196
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,450
It's up to you.

197
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:18,609
I want to exercise my
right to a phone call.

198
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,185
Well, I hope it's to your mom...

199
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:27,426
to tell her that you're gonna to be
18 months late for your dinner.

200
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,889
<i>Customer complaints.
How may I help you?</i>

201
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:05,774
My name's Eggsy Unwin. Sorry, Gary Unwin.

202
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,339
And I'm up shit creek, I'm in
an urban police station and

203
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,033
my mom said to call this number
if ever I needed help...

204
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,590
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.</i>

205
00:17:13,691 --> 00:17:15,251
Wait, wait

206
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,177
Oxford's not Brogue's?

207
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,446
<i>Your complaint has been duly noted,</i>

208
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:25,251
<i>and we hope that we've not lost you
as a loyal customer.</i>

209
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:37,543
Yeah...

210
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:40,547
Shit, What?

211
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,562
Yes, I totally understand.

212
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:08,932
Eggsy

213
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:11,123
Would you like a lift home?

214
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:12,581
Who are you?

215
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,519
The man who got you released.

216
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:15,587
That ain't an answer.

217
00:18:15,922 --> 00:18:18,126
A little gratitude would be nice.

218
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,976
My name is Harry Hart.

219
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:23,230
And I gave you that medal.

220
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:26,344
Your father saved my life.

221
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,056
So before you was a tailor, were
you in the army?

222
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:33,782
Like an officer?

223
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,247
Not quite.

224
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:37,340
So where was you posted, Iraq or something?

225
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,571
Sorry, Eggsy. Classified.

226
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,477
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

227
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,384
The day your father died,

228
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,008
I missed something.

229
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,750
And if it weren't for
his courage, my mistake

230
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,821
would have cost the lives
of every man present.

231
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,860
So I owe him.

232
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:59,213
Your father was a brave man.

233
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:00,358
A good man.

234
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:04,524
And having read your files, I'd think he'd be
bitterly disappointed in the choices you've made.

235
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,148
You can't talk to me like that.

236
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,447
Huge IQ, great performance
in primary school.

237
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,174
And it all went tits up.

238
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:14,392
Drugs, petty crime, never had a job.

239
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:15,872
Do you think there's a lot
of jobs going around here?

240
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:18,529
Doesn't explain why you
gave up your hobbies.

241
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,686
First prize, regional
under tens' gymnastics

242
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:24,365
Two years in a row. Your coach had you
pegged as Olympic team material.

243
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:26,051
Yeah and when you grow up
around someone like my

244
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:27,596
step-dad, you pick up new
hobbies pretty quick.

245
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:30,378
Ah of course, always someone else's fault.

246
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,005
And who's to blame you for
quitting the Marines?

247
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,713
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

248
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,693
Because my mum went mental.

249
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,347
Banging on about losing
me as well as my dad.

250
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,331
Then we wouldn't be cannon
fodder for snobs like

251
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,935
you, judging people like
me from your ivory towers.

252
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:48,844
With no thought about why we do what we do.

253
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,777
We ain't got much choice, you get me?

254
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:54,390
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses...

255
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,517
we would do just as well as you,

256
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,020
if not better.

257
00:19:58,138 --> 00:20:00,142
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking a piss?

258
00:20:01,844 --> 00:20:04,950
Some more examples of young men who
simply need a silver suppository?

259
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:07,054
Ya, they are exceptions. Come on.

260
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:08,394
Nonsense, we haven't finished our drinks.

261
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,473
After you nicked his
car, Dean says you're a

262
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,691
fair guy I don't give a
shit what your mum says.

263
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,470
Listen, boys.

264
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:19,519
I've had a rather emotional day,
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,

265
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,977
and I'm sure it's well founded...

266
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,616
I would appreciate it enormously
if you could just leave us in peace...

267
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:28,612
until I finish this
lovely pint of Guinness.

268
00:20:31,907 --> 00:20:34,613
You should get out of the way, Granddaddy.
Or you'll get hurt a lot.

269
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,717
He ain't joking, you should go.

270
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,056
Excuse me.

271
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:49,034
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith's Street.

272
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:55,868
Manners...

273
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,321
maketh...

274
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:02,549
man.

275
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,207
Do you know what that means?

276
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:15,799
Then let me teach you a lesson.

277
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:28,526
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

278
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:15,399
You fucking... You fucking...

279
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:19,844
"STUN"

280
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,040
Amnesia

281
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:58,557
Sorry about that.

282
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,171
Needed to let off a little steam.

283
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,277
Heard, yesterday a friend of mine died.

284
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:07,333
He knew your father too, actually.

285
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,047
I do apologise, Eggsy. I should not
have done this in front of you.

286
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:16,640
No. Please.. I won't say nothing,
I swear.

287
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:18,471
If there is one thing I can
do, it's keep my mouth shut.

288
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:20,929
- You won't tell a soul?
- I swear, I've never crossed anyone out.

289
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:22,966
Is that a promise?
- On my life.

290
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:29,079
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

291
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,384
You're right about the snobs.

292
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,050
But there too, there are exceptions.

293
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,893
Best of luck with everything.

294
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:54,632
<i>In celebrity news, The Richmond Valentine
movie premiered in Hollywood, last night.</i>

295
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,699
<i>The story of the Internet
billionaire's rise to power</i>

296
00:23:57,724 --> 00:24:00,469
<i>is expected to be this
award season's hot ticket.</i>

297
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,418
<i>One notable absence

298
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,582
<i>Iggy Azalea, still missing
three days after...</i>

299
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:11,167
Eggsy, just go. Please
because he's gonna...

300
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,955
- Please don't hurt him.
- Fuck off!

301
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,361
Shut the fuck up.

302
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,724
Who was with you in that fucking pub?

303
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:22,942
- I want to know the name of the geezer you was with.
- I was not with anyone.

304
00:24:23,572 --> 00:24:26,595
I don't know what you're on about.

305
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:30,320
- Fucking tell me his name.
- I don't know what you're fucking on about.

306
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:38,100
<i>You listen to me, I want to know who you
was with in that pub. You Understand?</i>

307
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:40,186
<i>I want to know his fucking name.</i>

308
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,171
<i>I don't know what you're fucking on about.</i>

309
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:49,414
Fuck off.

310
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,258
I could kill you right now and no one
in the the world will know it.

311
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:55,744
<i>But I would.</i>

312
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,168
I have enough evidence
on your activities to

313
00:24:58,193 --> 00:25:00,242
have you locked up for
the rest of your life.

314
00:25:00,318 --> 00:25:02,323
<i>Mister Dean Anthony Baker.</i>

315
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,329
<i>So I suggest you leave the boy alone.</i>

316
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,079
<i>Or I shall be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.</i>

317
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,735
<i>Eggsy, meet me at the tailor's
I told you about.</i>

318
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,915
What the fuck's going on here?

319
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,364
Eggsy, you fucking maggot...

320
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,083
Here's we gotta arrest him.

321
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:21,111
<i>Hey... hey... hey</i>

322
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,779
Come here.

323
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:36,948
You wanker!

324
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:37,997
I'll have you soon.

325
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:06,409
I've never met a tailor before.

326
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,022
But I know you ain't one.

327
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:13,955
Come with me.

328
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,820
Come on here.

329
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:31,023
What do you see?

330
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:34,182
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

331
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:38,075
I see a young man with potential.

332
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,182
A young man who is loyal.

333
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:44,586
Who can do as he is asked,

334
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:46,745
and who wants to do something
good with his life.

335
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:50,602
Did you see the film "Trading Places"?

336
00:26:50,626 --> 00:26:52,630
No

337
00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:56,013
How about "Nikita"?

338
00:26:56,172 --> 00:26:58,177
"Pretty Woman"?

339
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,370
All right.

340
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:01,924
My point is, the lack of a
silver spoon has set you

341
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:04,254
on a certain path, but
you needn't stay on it.

342
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:09,518
If you're prepare to adapt and learn,
you can transform.

343
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:12,147
Oh, like in "My Fair Lady"?

344
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,955
I know you're full of surprises.

345
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,859
Yes, like "My Fair Lady"

346
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:22,569
Only in this case, I am offering you the
opportunity to become a Kingsman.

347
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,473
A tailor?

348
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,982
A Kingsman agent.

349
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,485
- Like a spy?
- Of sorts.

350
00:27:32,742 --> 00:27:33,945
Interested?

351
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,536
You think I've got anything to lose?

352
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:49,125
Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

353
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:53,634
In 1919, a great number of them had lost
their heirs to World War 1.

354
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:57,743
That meant a lot of money
going un-inherited.

355
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:02,352
And a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

356
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,908
Our founders realized
that they could channel

357
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,387
that wealth and influence
for a greater good.

358
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:11,371
And so began our adventure.

359
00:28:11,471 --> 00:28:14,536
An independent international
intelligence agency

360
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:17,437
operating at the highest
level of discretion.

361
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,966
Without the politics and bureaucracy...

362
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,996
that undermine the integrity of
government run spy organizations.

363
00:28:24,623 --> 00:28:27,527
A suit is the modern gentleman's armor.

364
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,912
And the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

365
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:34,820
- How deep does this fucking thing go?
- Deep enough.

366
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:21,118
Shit. We're late.

367
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,575
Your father had the same look on his face.

368
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,437
As did I.

369
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:54,424
Come on.

370
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:59,298
- Galahad.
- My code name.

371
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,703
Late again, sir.

372
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:02,831
Good Luck.

373
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:04,548
In you go.

374
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,153
Fall in.

375
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:22,341
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

376
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,978
You are about to embark
on what is probably the

377
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:27,180
most dangerous job
interview in the world.

378
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:32,267
One of you and only one of you
will become the next Lancelot.

379
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:36,476
Can anybody tell me what this is?

380
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,996
- A body bag, sir.
- Correct.

381
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,989
- Charlie, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

382
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,694
In a moment, you will
each collect a body bag.

383
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,824
You will write your
name on that bag.

384
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,207
You will write the details of your
next of kin. On that bag.

385
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,061
This represents your
acknowledgment of

386
00:30:53,086 --> 00:30:54,838
the risks that you
are about to face...

387
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:57,005
as well as your
agreement to strict

388
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,049
confidentiality, which
incidentally if you break...

389
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:05,837
will result in you and your next
of kin being in that bag.

390
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,044
Is that understood?

391
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:11,950
Excellent.

392
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:13,477
Fall out.

393
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:22,203
Roxanne. But..

394
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:23,899
Call me Roxy.

395
00:31:23,975 --> 00:31:25,417
- I am Eggsy.
- Eggy?

396
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:26,505
No, Eggsy

397
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,491
Eggy... and where did
they dig you up?

398
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:31,816
You know we are not allowed
to discuss who proposed us.

399
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,325
No need to bite his head off.

400
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,624
Charlie's only making
conversation, right Charlie?

401
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,704
I'm Digby.

402
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,383
Digby.

403
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:40,683
Eggy, this is

404
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:41,328
Rufus.

405
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:42,695
Rufus, Eggy.

406
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:47,852
So Eggy, are you
Oxford or Cambridge?

407
00:31:47,877 --> 00:31:48,879
Neither.

408
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:50,158
St. Andrews? Durham?

409
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,459
Oh wait, I think we may have met.

410
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,166
Did you serve me at the McDonalds
in Winchester Service Station?

411
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,409
No.

412
00:31:57,628 --> 00:32:00,153
But if I had, I give you an
extra helping of secret sauce.

413
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:02,102
It's definitely St. Andrews.

414
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:06,063
- Just ignore them.
- Do you need a pen?

415
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:06,790
Cheers.

416
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:08,693
- Amelia, isn't it?

417
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:10,722
- Amelia,
- Eggsy

418
00:32:10,746 --> 00:32:11,975
Hi Eggsy!

419
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:14,036
Don't take any notice
of those guys.

420
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:15,508
That's what I told him.

421
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:19,292
It's just scare tactics.

422
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:21,107
Classic army technique.

423
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:22,622
No one's gonna die.

424
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,548
Shame.

425
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:32,646
Great, so you don't know,
the CIA don't know.

426
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,648
Nobody knows who this guy is?

427
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:36,002
Fine.

428
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:38,055
Seriously, it's fine.

429
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:40,079
Well, it's not really fine but

430
00:32:40,104 --> 00:32:41,662
it's not why I'm here.

431
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:43,739
Hell man, you know me?

432
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,435
Money's not my issue.

433
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:47,994
I could have retired straight
out of MIT, fucked off

434
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:50,239
to some island and let
the business run itself.

435
00:32:50,357 --> 00:32:53,513
Nobody told me to try
and save the planet.

436
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,590
I wanted to.

437
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:58,774
Climate change research, lobbying,
years of studying, billions of dollars.

438
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,012
And you know why i quit?

439
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:05,900
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

440
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:08,671
Hence, my epiphany.

441
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:11,701
Money won't solve this.

442
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:14,152
Those idiots who call
themselves politicians,

443
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:16,035
they bury their heads
in the sand...

444
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:18,771
and stood for nothing but re-election.

445
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:23,627
So I spent the last two years trying
to find a real solution.

446
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:26,149
And I found it.

447
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,532
Now, If you really want to make
the world a better place...

448
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:32,874
I suggest you open
your fucking ears

449
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:35,140
because I'm about
to tell it to you.

450
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,267
Go on, Mr. Valentine.

451
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,106
I'm still listening.

452
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:43,369
As long as you agree to all my terms.

453
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,377
No one panic. Listen to me. Stay calm.

454
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,689
- Use snorkels.
- Use snorkels?

455
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:44,749
- Shower heads.
- Shower heads?

456
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,853
She's right. Go. Fucking go.

457
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:50,229
And what about pulling the fucking door?

458
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:15,513
Congratulations

459
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,515
on completing your first task.

460
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:20,097
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

461
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:22,402
For those who 're still confused

462
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:24,653
If you get a breathing
tube run the U-bend of

463
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:26,735
a toilet, you have an
unlimited air supply.

464
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:29,216
Simple physics. Worth remembering.

465
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:30,149
Eggsy,

466
00:36:30,174 --> 00:36:32,671
Well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

467
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,018
He is probably seen enough of 'em.

468
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,956
Yeah you can all wipe those
smirks off your faces.

469
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,462
Because as far as
I am concerned,

470
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,024
every single one
of you has failed.

471
00:36:41,442 --> 00:36:44,448
You all forgot the most important thing:

472
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,552
Teamwork.

473
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:03,794
So much for classic army technique.

474
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:07,810
35,

475
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:10,027
5.

476
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,807
That's it.

477
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:18,815
Hello?

478
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,273
Can I help you?

479
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:24,055
Yes, I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

480
00:37:25,334 --> 00:37:28,180
Really? Well, it's actually
quite fascinating.

481
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:31,742
My colleague died
trying to rescue you.

482
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,719
And I'm sure you saw how
well-trained he was.

483
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:36,657
So I suggest you tell me who kidnapped you
and why they let you go.

484
00:37:36,758 --> 00:37:38,783
I have no idea what you're talking about...

485
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:41,172
I can not say, it was...

486
00:37:41,668 --> 00:37:44,674
Oh for god's sake, I barely touched you.
How man are...

487
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,399
<font color="#ff0000">"IMPLANT ACTIVATED"

488
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,406
Fuck that guy, whoever he is, I'm gonna...

489
00:38:09,533 --> 00:38:11,488
He made me kill
Professor Arnold.

490
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:13,350
Goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

491
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,248
Well the good news is

492
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:16,365
we know the emergency and
surveillance systems work.

493
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,485
You know what is not good news?

494
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:20,163
"My colleague died."

495
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:21,922
That's what he said.

496
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:24,455
This is an organization
and they are all over us.

497
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,636
Whoever you spoke to...

498
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:30,370
I told you, I am in contact with the
KGB, MI6, Mossad and Beijing.

499
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,575
They all insist he
wasn't one of theirs.

500
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,602
Beijing.

501
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:38,086
So freaky how there's no recognizable name
for the Chinese Secret Service.

502
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:41,093
Now that's what you call a secret, right?

503
00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:42,634
You know what?

504
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:47,104
Fuck it. We need to speed things up.
Bring the product release forward.

505
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:50,813
They are only halfway into production.
Speeding it will cost a fortune.

506
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:54,018
Do I look like I give a fuck?
Just get it done..

507
00:38:55,723 --> 00:38:59,692
As some of you will have
learned last night:

508
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:03,740
Teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

509
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,254
We are here to enhance your skills,
test you to limits.

510
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:11,256
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

511
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:13,557
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

512
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:16,019
You will care for it,
you will teach it.

513
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:19,173
And by the time they are fully trained,
so will you be.

514
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,878
Those of you who are still here, that is.

515
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,829
Do you understand?

516
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:25,911
Choose your puppy.

517
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:29,695
A poodle?

518
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,528
What?

519
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:32,749
They are gun dogs.

520
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,672
Oldest working breed.

521
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:36,032
Easy to train.

522
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:39,052
A pug?

523
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:42,114
It's a bulldog, isn't it?

524
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:46,150
It would get bigger though, wouldn't it?

525
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:51,339
Ssshhhit

526
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:56,551
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

527
00:39:56,952 --> 00:39:59,958
No direct brain trauma at all.

528
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:01,871
How much longer can he be out?

529
00:40:01,896 --> 00:40:03,991
That's the million-dollar question.

530
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,207
We don't know what he was
exposed to in there.

531
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:07,598
What about Harry's footage?

532
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:09,427
It didn't stream to
his home terminal?

533
00:40:09,556 --> 00:40:11,529
Encrypted and uncrackable.

534
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:14,749
If and when he comes round,
you might wanna have

535
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:16,717
a word with him about
sharing his password.

536
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:18,297
Is he gonna be alright?

537
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:21,951
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

538
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,431
But there is hope. Okay?

539
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:25,936
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on your training.

540
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:28,041
Make it through the
test, make him proud.

541
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,639
Come on, J. B. Come on.

542
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:44,337
I am not coming last cause of you.

543
00:40:44,883 --> 00:40:47,661
J. B, I'll shoot you, goddamn.
I'll fucking shoot you.

544
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,564
Merlin said we're not allowed to hold you.

545
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,775
Bollocks.

546
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,242
Water.

547
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:41,928
Come on then.

548
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:42,778
Eggsy, you forget it.

549
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:44,446
Oh what's wrong mate,
can't take a joke?

550
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,407
Seriously, you'll get turned out and it's
just not worth it.

551
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,457
Maybe I don't give a fuck
about getting kicked out.

552
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:49,684
Really? Come on, you player.

553
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,724
Charlie, fuck off.

554
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,422
Yeah, go on, walk away.

555
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:56,449
Dickhead.

556
00:41:57,705 --> 00:41:58,968
Come on, J. B.

557
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:00,435
It's all right.

558
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,532
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test.

559
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:17,573
Starting now.

560
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:23,760
<i>- New target. 800 meters.
- It's unbelievable. You're still here.</i>

561
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,180
Lingering on like some big steaming shit
that just won't flush.

562
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:28,379
Roger that.

563
00:42:28,404 --> 00:42:31,487
Target identified. And how
about you shut the fuck up.

564
00:42:31,563 --> 00:42:32,606
Positive discrimination.

565
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:33,856
It's worth it.

566
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,830
Like those fucking steak
cooks who go down seaways

567
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:39,127
because their mum's a
one-legged lesbian.

568
00:42:39,203 --> 00:42:41,074
You don't know fuck-all about my grades.

569
00:42:41,176 --> 00:42:43,337
Oh forgive me. I'm sure
you're highly educated.

570
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:44,364
Fire when ready.

571
00:42:46,508 --> 00:42:49,013
How's that for positive discrimination?

572
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:02,942
I wanna thank you both for listening.

573
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:06,336
And I really, really appreciate
your traveling all this way,

574
00:43:06,361 --> 00:43:07,476
Your Royal Highness.

575
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,612
And you too, Prime Minister.

576
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:12,286
I think this is quite brilliant.

577
00:43:12,763 --> 00:43:15,468
It is absolutely brilliant.

578
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,778
You are completely crazy.

579
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,100
I'm sorry, Your Royal Highness...

580
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,055
but you got a big role to play...

581
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:37,415
in getting the Scandinavian
region back on track.

582
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:39,262
You're popular,
inspirational and

583
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:41,547
you have the power to
galvanize the people.

584
00:43:42,124 --> 00:43:44,529
Now whether you're on board or not...

585
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,383
I am going to have to insist

586
00:43:46,408 --> 00:43:49,664
on getting you somewhere I
can ensure your safety.

587
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,878
How about you, Prime Minister?

588
00:43:51,903 --> 00:43:52,971
You in or out?

589
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,052
Well, I think it's
about time that

590
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:57,080
a politician did
something that...

591
00:43:57,657 --> 00:44:00,160
actually made a difference.

592
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:01,390
Too true.

593
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,171
Take her away.

594
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:08,747
Drink?

595
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,909
Why not?

596
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,294
Wait, help me.

597
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:18,100
Do not worry. No harm will
come to the princess.

598
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,710
Well I'm Republican anyway,
so it really doesn't matter.

599
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,115
Release the princess.

600
00:44:58,685 --> 00:44:59,967
Okay, you're done.

601
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,415
Not too bad, right?

602
00:45:02,092 --> 00:45:03,974
I hardly felt a thing.

603
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:05,624
Welcome aboard.

604
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:08,233
The pleasure is all mine.

605
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:15,927
Ever heard of knocking?

606
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:18,751
Only when I'm casing
a place to rob.

607
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:21,132
Amelia said you wanted to see me.

608
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:24,139
Hope J. B.'s training is going
as well as yours is.

609
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:25,375
Sit.

610
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:30,652
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

611
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:33,458
Your test results are even
better than I could've hoped.

612
00:45:35,863 --> 00:45:37,053
Come in.

613
00:45:41,292 --> 00:45:43,956
Eggsy, I need to have a
private conversation.

614
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:45,023
You're dismissed.

615
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:49,559
Nonsense, let him observe.
He'd learn a thing or two.

616
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:52,197
As you wish. Take a look at this.

617
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:59,063
Fucking hell. That's his... harry.

618
00:45:59,914 --> 00:46:01,263
You blew up his head?

619
00:46:01,288 --> 00:46:02,944
Its a bit much, isn't it?

620
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,728
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

621
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:08,028
Here. Under that scar.

622
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:11,161
Did my hardware pick up the
signal that triggered it?

623
00:46:11,237 --> 00:46:13,141
Fortunately, yes.

624
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:14,663
Unfortunately, the IP address

625
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,675
it traced it to is registered
to the Valentine Corporation.

626
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:20,657
It's not much of a lead.
They have millions of employees worldwide.

627
00:46:20,757 --> 00:46:23,363
No, Richmond Valentine is a genius.

628
00:46:26,347 --> 00:46:29,026
Did you not see his announcement today?

629
00:46:29,476 --> 00:46:30,595
No.

630
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:36,591
<i>We each spend on average</i>

631
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:40,423
<i>$2,000 a year on cellphone
and internet usage.</i>

632
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:44,310
It gives me great
pleasure to announce,

633
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,335
those days are over.

634
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:51,622
As of tomorrow, every man, woman and child
can claim a free SIM card...

635
00:46:51,722 --> 00:46:56,031
compatible with any cellphone,
any computer and...

636
00:46:56,132 --> 00:47:00,240
<i>utilize my communications network
for free.</i>

637
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,850
<i>Free calls. Free internet. For everyone.</i>

638
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:07,287
<i>Forever.</i>

639
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:25,835
Valentine's assistant has
the same implant scar.

640
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:29,301
I think Mr. Valentine and I
shall have a tête-à-tête.

641
00:47:32,508 --> 00:47:35,113
He's having a gala dinner next week.

642
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:36,497
I'll get you an invitation.

643
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:38,044
You need to be careful though.

644
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,284
Since you were out, hundreds of VIPs
have gone missing.

645
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:42,857
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

646
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,197
Then I suggest you make my alias

647
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:47,029
somebody worth kidnapping.

648
00:48:00,968 --> 00:48:02,480
You don’t like heights?

649
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:04,499
Yes it's okay I've done it before.

650
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:07,080
Probably alright if I don't think of it.

651
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:12,091
Hey, you'll be alright,
You're top of the class.

652
00:48:13,895 --> 00:48:18,003
<i>Listen up, your mission is to land in the
target without the radar detecting you.</i>

653
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:22,126
If I read you on the radar or
you miss the target, you go home.

654
00:48:22,312 --> 00:48:23,816
Is that understood?

655
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:29,427
<i>Drop zone coming up. 20 seconds.</i>

656
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,033
Here we go.

657
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:44,669
- I really don't think I can do this.
- Of course you can't.

658
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:46,664
Get to the back and I'll
show you how, yeah.

659
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:56,676
Eggsy, Eggsy.. wait. Hang on.

660
00:48:57,155 --> 00:48:59,159
Roxy, just stop fucking about.

661
00:49:00,693 --> 00:49:02,196
Follow me, yeah?

662
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,036
<i>Roxy, it's now or never.</i>

663
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:23,288
Jump.

664
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:44,866
Good girl, Rox.
I'm glad you made it.

665
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:05,365
My my, you're all very cheerful.

666
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,259
You really think it was gonna
be that straightforward?

667
00:50:08,335 --> 00:50:10,740
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

668
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,594
A Kingsman agent
needs to be able

669
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:14,372
to solve problems
under pressure.

670
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:19,158
Like what to do when one of your group
has no parachute.

671
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:22,966
No parachute? Who?

672
00:50:23,274 --> 00:50:24,840
Fuck. Which one?

673
00:50:24,865 --> 00:50:26,624
What do we do?

674
00:50:26,748 --> 00:50:29,980
I told you. Aim for the target
coming under the radar.

675
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:32,629
And I hope not to be
scraping one of you up.

676
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,597
But if I do have to and
you're inside the target...

677
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:37,795
means I'll be very impressed.

678
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:45,413
<i>Everybody listen, I've got a plan.</i>

679
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:49,708
<i>Pair up. Grab the closest person to you.</i>

680
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:53,830
<i>Rufus, come on.</i>

681
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:54,856
Oh fuck.

682
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:56,560
<i>Rufus!</i>

683
00:50:56,668 --> 00:50:57,987
<i>Oh shit! I can't</i>

684
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:03,206
<i>Fuck!!!</i>

685
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:05,054
<i>Fucking cock.</i>

686
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,126
<i>Rufus, you wanker.</i>

687
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,258
<i>We are an odd number now.</i>

688
00:51:10,283 --> 00:51:14,092
<i>- Quick, make a circle.
- Fuck. Right boys. Let's do it.</i>

689
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,734
<i>We'll pull our cords one by one.</i>

690
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:25,006
<i>When we know who's it, the person
on the right grabs him.</i>

691
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,034
<i>Ok, Eggsy</i>

692
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,407
Good plan, Eggsy. You have 30 seconds.
Come on now. Hurry up.

693
00:51:30,808 --> 00:51:32,411
<i>You first.</i>

694
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:34,440
<i>Fuck</i>

695
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:39,554
<i>OK, Me next.</i>

696
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:45,325
<i>See you on the ground, boys.</i>

697
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:49,227
<i>Now me.</i>

698
00:51:58,253 --> 00:52:01,168
<i>Roxy, no matter what happens now,
I've got you. Alright?</i>

699
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:06,275
<i>OK, Eggsy</i>

700
00:52:06,388 --> 00:52:07,311
<i>You first, okay?</i>

701
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:08,338
<i>Yep</i>

702
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:22,172
Shit.

703
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,706
Oh Shit.

704
00:52:36,314 --> 00:52:37,317
<i>Rox</i>

705
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,368
Hugo, Digby,

706
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:02,725
You don't land in the K
then you're not in the K.

707
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:04,705
Rufus, you opened too soon.

708
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,733
You were all over the radar.

709
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,814
All three of you, pack your bags. Go home.

710
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:12,859
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.

711
00:53:12,884 --> 00:53:14,951
You have set a new record.

712
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:17,548
Opening at 300 feet,
that's pretty ballsy.

713
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:20,161
Well done on completing another task.
Follow.

714
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:24,338
Sorry sir, but why the fuck
you choose me as the gimp?

715
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:27,868
- Am I the expendable candidate?
- No no no. You don't talk to me like that.

716
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,611
If you have a complaint, you came here
and you whisper in my ear.

717
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:40,247
You need to take that
jape off your shoulder.

718
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:14,552
Mr. DeVere. It's a pleasure to meet you.

719
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:17,291
I am sorry. I seem to
have my dates muddles up.

720
00:54:17,392 --> 00:54:20,364
Oh no no. I canceled the
gala because of you.

721
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:23,019
Anybody willing to
donate that much

722
00:54:23,044 --> 00:54:25,298
deserves their own dinner.
Come in.

723
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:27,560
Thank you.

724
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,959
Gotta admit, I was really
intrigued to meet you.

725
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:34,127
There are not many
billionaires I do not know.

726
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:35,019
I don't doubt it.

727
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:38,066
Obviously, I have had my people
looking into your affairs

728
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:40,447
and that's some pretty
old money you're from.

729
00:54:40,523 --> 00:54:41,964
How'd your folks make it?

730
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:44,639
Property, mostly.
Property in the markets.

731
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,421
Nothing personal, if that's your concern.

732
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:51,229
No, I'm just in to find out what kind of
person you are. I'm sure you understand that.

733
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,261
I most certainly do.

734
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:53,357
Hope you're hungry.

735
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:54,550
I'm famished.

736
00:54:54,575 --> 00:54:56,464
Good. Grab a seat.

737
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:19,764
I'll have the Big Mac, please.

738
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:20,714
Great choice.

739
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:24,198
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

740
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:26,366
Tastes great with
this '45 Lafite.

741
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:27,631
A classic pairing.

742
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:31,513
May I suggest Twinkies with
1937 Château d'Yquem for pudding?

743
00:55:31,613 --> 00:55:33,270
I like it

744
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:37,125
So you want to donate to my foundation?

745
00:55:37,526 --> 00:55:40,732
You are aware that I wind
things down in that area, right?

746
00:55:41,093 --> 00:55:44,099
Climate changes affect us all,
Mr. Valentine.

747
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,246
And you are one of the few powerful people
who seems to share my concerns.

748
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:50,327
I stepped things down because
I wasn't getting anywhere.

749
00:55:50,428 --> 00:55:53,159
Every bit of research kept
pointing to the same thing.

750
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:55,864
The carbon emissions are a red
herring, and we are past the

751
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:58,494
point of no return no matter
what remedial actions we take.

752
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:00,310
You know your shit.

753
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,527
I sometimes envy the blissful
ignorance of those less well-versed

754
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:05,894
in their shit.

755
00:56:07,088 --> 00:56:09,092
As Professor Arnold always said:

756
00:56:09,192 --> 00:56:12,142
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live with the

757
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:15,229
horrifying knowledge of its
host's fragile mortality."

758
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:18,806
There are not a lot of
people who know about him.

759
00:56:21,518 --> 00:56:24,224
Do you like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

760
00:56:27,631 --> 00:56:30,337
Nowadays, they're all a little
serious for my taste.

761
00:56:30,938 --> 00:56:33,643
But the old ones... marvelous.

762
00:56:33,944 --> 00:56:36,583
Give me a farfetched
theatrical plot any day.

763
00:56:36,588 --> 00:56:38,979
The old Bond movies. Oh, man.

764
00:56:40,057 --> 00:56:43,765
Ah, When I was a kid,
that was my dream job.

765
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:46,270
A gentleman spy.

766
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:49,974
I always felt the old Bond films were
only as good as the villain.

767
00:56:50,249 --> 00:56:54,258
As a child, I rather fancied
a futuristic colorful megalomaniac.

768
00:56:56,091 --> 00:56:59,358
What a shame we both had to grow up.

769
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,310
Bon appétit.

770
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:10,922
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

771
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:14,429
I'll have my people get in touch with yours
and it's all good.

772
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:18,037
Thank you for such a "Happy Meal".

773
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:25,653
- Well, you want me to follow him?
- Nah.

774
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:28,458
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

775
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,170
We'll know his every move for the next 24
hours. Finally find out who he works for.

776
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:38,588
Valentine didn't let
me out of his sight.

777
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:40,456
All I got was this,
on the way in.

778
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:48,701
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

779
00:57:49,002 --> 00:57:50,890
The FBI have been
monitoring them for years.

780
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:52,633
Do you think Valentine
is a supporter?

781
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:56,069
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

782
00:57:56,918 --> 00:57:57,845
Oh, by the way,

783
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,650
the ever-growing list
of missing persons...

784
00:58:00,726 --> 00:58:03,766
Now includes Scandinavian Royalty.

785
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,639
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

786
00:58:08,743 --> 00:58:11,649
Just let me out, you PSYCHO!

787
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:14,756
I told you, you're free
to go anytime you want.

788
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:17,787
As long as you agree
to my conditions.

789
00:58:17,812 --> 00:58:19,089
I don't agree.

790
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:22,163
And I am never ever going to agree!

791
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:23,673
Enough yet.

792
00:58:23,775 --> 00:58:25,340
Bitch.

793
00:58:29,487 --> 00:58:33,695
<i>The list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks.</i>

794
00:58:33,796 --> 00:58:37,804
<i>And world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers.</i>

795
00:58:37,904 --> 00:58:41,111
We are doing everything in our
power to find princess Tilde.

796
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:46,121
You know, governments and security forces
worldwide are working together...

797
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:48,900
to find the person behind these abductions.

798
00:58:49,128 --> 00:58:52,226
<i>In other news, people all
over the world continue to</i>

799
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:55,465
<i>wait in line day and night
to get their free SIM card.</i>

800
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:58,247
Mrs. P. You get one?

801
00:58:58,347 --> 00:59:00,953
Yeah, I've been queuing up all day.

802
00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:05,462
<i>This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine...</i>

803
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:08,569
<i>has already seen over a
billion cards distributed.</i>

804
00:59:08,669 --> 00:59:10,172
At ease.

805
00:59:11,775 --> 00:59:14,321
So you thought you were
done for the day, huh?

806
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:16,485
Probably not.

807
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:20,494
- A party?
- Tonight. In London.

808
00:59:21,596 --> 00:59:23,299
- Who is this?
- Your target.

809
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,080
Your mission is to use your
NLP Training to win over

810
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,735
the individual in the
photograph in your envelope.

811
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:32,318
And when I say "win over", I
do mean in the Biblical sense.

812
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:33,650
Easy

813
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:36,252
Most girls love a bit rough.

814
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:38,300
We'll see about that, yeah.

815
00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:40,335
Who is that anyway?

816
00:59:46,548 --> 00:59:50,256
I just had to come over
and say "Amazing eyes".

817
00:59:50,356 --> 00:59:52,862
- You wearing color contacts?
- No.

818
00:59:53,162 --> 00:59:56,369
- You so are
- Oh my god. 'Negging'. That's hilarious.

819
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:58,874
I haven't had anyone try
that since the 90s.

820
00:59:58,899 --> 00:59:59,901
Excuse me?

821
01:00:00,077 --> 01:00:02,688
"Negging". Saying something
negative to a pretty

822
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:05,111
girl in order to undermine
her social value.

823
01:00:05,288 --> 01:00:08,013
Its supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

824
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,923
Absurdly basic neurolinguistic
programming technique.

825
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,187
Is it just me or does this
champagne taste a little bit funny?

826
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:14,495
That's an acquired taste, mate.

827
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:17,112
- I think it's just cheap.
- Get one of these instead. They're delicious.

828
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:20,323
You know, if you're interested in ornamental
techniques, this guy is textbook.

829
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:22,493
See what he just did? Its
called an 'opinion opener.

830
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,352
He got you talking with
a neutral question...

831
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:28,637
got all of us involved in the conversation,
so that you crave individual attention.

832
01:00:28,737 --> 01:00:31,129
Nah, I'm just saying that the
champagne tastes weird...

833
01:00:31,154 --> 01:00:33,972
Lady Sophie, Montague Herring,
phone call for you at reception.

834
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:37,054
- Be right back.
- See you in a bit, yeah.

835
01:00:37,455 --> 01:00:40,998
- Good job, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.
- You alright?

836
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,397
Sorry to eavesdrop...

837
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:45,968
but there is a much easier way to
guarantee getting someone home.

838
01:00:46,173 --> 01:00:47,877
Rohypnol.

839
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:51,986
Or even something stronger.

840
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:11,122
Who the fuck are you?

841
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:13,731
Where am I?

842
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:18,962
This knife can save your life.

843
01:01:23,299 --> 01:01:24,301
Fuck

844
01:01:24,903 --> 01:01:27,300
My employer's got two
questions for you, Eggsy.

845
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,617
What the fuck is Kingsman?
And who is Harry Hart?

846
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:33,362
I do not know what the fuck that is.

847
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:36,146
Oh Eggsy, I just killed
two of your friends

848
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:38,241
because they gave me the
same bullshit answer.

849
01:01:40,453 --> 01:01:42,945
Just cut the fucking ropes, please.

850
01:01:43,253 --> 01:01:45,391
Eggsy, is the Kingsman worth dying for?

851
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:49,821
Fuck You

852
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:04,809
Congratulations.

853
01:02:04,834 --> 01:02:06,265
Bloody well done.

854
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:11,945
- How'd the others do?
- Roxy passed with flying colors.

855
01:02:12,454 --> 01:02:13,931
Charlie's up next.

856
01:02:13,956 --> 01:02:15,184
Want to watch?

857
01:02:16,262 --> 01:02:17,766
Yeah, alright.

858
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,275
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

859
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:25,742
No fuck, it isn't shit
I'll tell all you want, please.

860
01:02:25,983 --> 01:02:27,365
Chester King's Arthur,

861
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,216
head of a spy agency;
It's called Kingsman.

862
01:02:30,292 --> 01:02:33,298
Thank you Charlie. Much appreciated.

863
01:02:33,322 --> 01:02:35,326
Come on, It wasn't the fucking deal

864
01:02:45,023 --> 01:02:47,199
I had such high hopes for you.

865
01:02:47,224 --> 01:02:49,256
You are a bloody disgrace.

866
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:50,835
I'm so sorry

867
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,663
Please untie me.

868
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,443
Untie yourself.

869
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:58,651
Arthur, please.

870
01:03:02,505 --> 01:03:04,510
Anyone?...No

871
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,570
Galahad, Percival. Congratulations.

872
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,475
You candidates have reached the
final stage of the testing process.

873
01:03:10,576 --> 01:03:14,379
As tradition allows, you now have
24 hours to spend with them.

874
01:03:14,986 --> 01:03:16,210
Eggsy, you should know

875
01:03:16,235 --> 01:03:18,016
your father reached this point.

876
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:19,595
From now on,

877
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,125
there are no safety nets.
Understood?

878
01:03:25,608 --> 01:03:27,111
Good. Dismissed.

879
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:33,324
Charlie, time to go home.

880
01:03:33,348 --> 01:03:34,958
Fuck you

881
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:36,908
My fucking dad's gonna hear about this.

882
01:03:39,437 --> 01:03:41,441
"To pee or not to pee?"

883
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:46,101
That was the headline the day after I
diffused a dirty bomb in Paris.

884
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:49,475
- "Germany 1 - England 5."
- I missed that game.

885
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,625
I was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at Pentagon.

886
01:03:57,776 --> 01:03:58,953
My first mission.

887
01:03:58,978 --> 01:04:02,435
I foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

888
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:04,489
Not everybody had thanked you for that one.

889
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,715
The point is, Eggsy, nobody thanked
me for any of them.

890
01:04:07,997 --> 01:04:11,555
Front page news, and all these occasions
were celebrity nonsense.

891
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:15,529
Because it is the nature of Kingsman that
our achievements remain secret.

892
01:04:15,713 --> 01:04:19,020
A gentleman's name should appear in the
newspaper only three times:

893
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,626
When he's born, when he
marries and when he dies.

894
01:04:21,726 --> 01:04:25,133
And we are, first and foremost, gentlemen.

895
01:04:25,233 --> 01:04:26,452
Pretty fucked then.

896
01:04:26,553 --> 01:04:30,091
Its like Charlie said,
I am just a pleb.

897
01:04:30,192 --> 01:04:33,911
Being a gentleman has nothing to do with
the circumstances of one's birth.

898
01:04:34,052 --> 01:04:36,056
Being a gentleman is something one learns.

899
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,214
Yeah, but how?

900
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,125
Alright, first lesson,

901
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,010
you should have asked me
before you took a seat.

902
01:04:44,482 --> 01:04:45,619
Second lesson,

903
01:04:45,644 --> 01:04:48,054
how to make a proper martini.

904
01:04:48,074 --> 01:04:50,483
Yes, Harry.

905
01:04:53,888 --> 01:04:57,023
Goddamn it. It fucking hurts.

906
01:04:57,201 --> 01:04:59,654
You are the one who asked for
a biometric security system.

907
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:01,133
What's wrong with
a simple switch?

908
01:05:01,209 --> 01:05:02,586
A simple switch?

909
01:05:02,612 --> 01:05:06,143
This is an extremely
dangerous machine.

910
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:10,729
It should only be operated by someone
responsible and sane as me.

911
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:13,923
Bad shit can happen
if it falls into the wrong hands.

912
01:05:14,436 --> 01:05:16,240
SYNC MAIN TERMINAL

913
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:19,879
- Are we done here? Shit
- No, now this one,

914
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:22,076
for the test of the church.

915
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:26,161
This one just has a short range.
A simple switch will do.

916
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,757
So you gonna teach me how to talk proper
like in 'My Fair Lady'?

917
01:05:34,879 --> 01:05:35,906
That'd be absurd.

918
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:39,012
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.

919
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:41,694
Its about being at ease in one's own skin.

920
01:05:41,794 --> 01:05:46,134
As Hemingway said:"There is nothing noble
in being superior to your fellow man."

921
01:05:46,303 --> 01:05:50,308
"True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

922
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:56,906
Now, the first thing every gentleman
needs is a good suit.

923
01:05:57,026 --> 01:06:00,333
By which I mean a bespoke suit.
Never off the peg.

924
01:06:00,433 --> 01:06:02,834
And Kingsman suits are
always bulletproof,

925
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:04,365
So let's get you measured.

926
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:07,270
And whether you get the job
or not, you will have a

927
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:10,177
lasting and useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.

928
01:06:10,454 --> 01:06:14,162
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

929
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:16,248
Fitting Room 2 is available.

930
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:18,695
One does not use
Fitting Room 2...

931
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:21,327
when one is popping one's cherry.

932
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:25,285
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting
Room 3, while we wait.

933
01:06:34,905 --> 01:06:37,410
- So we going up or down?
- Neither.

934
01:06:38,813 --> 01:06:43,022
- Is this it?
- Of course not. Pull the hook on your left.

935
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:51,500
Oh, Yes

936
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,045
Very very nice.

937
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:59,457
You're going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit.

938
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,666
An Oxford is any formal shoe,
with open lacing.

939
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:06,973
This additional decorative
piece is called broguing.

940
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:10,439
- "Oxford's, not brogue's."
- Words to live by, Eggsy.

941
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:11,606
Words to live by.

942
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,286
Try a pair.

943
01:07:13,515 --> 01:07:15,639
Your weapon scores are
excellent, by the way.

944
01:07:16,392 --> 01:07:17,943
These you're familiar with.

945
01:07:18,132 --> 01:07:20,000
And this is our standard issue pistol.

946
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,566
Its quite unique. As you all
see it, it also fires a

947
01:07:22,591 --> 01:07:25,335
shotgun cartridge for use in
messy close-range situations.

948
01:07:25,411 --> 01:07:28,252
How do they feel? Now do your
very best in impersonation

949
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,446
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.

950
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:35,031
No, Eggsy.

951
01:07:38,839 --> 01:07:40,343
That is sick.

952
01:07:41,244 --> 01:07:43,369
In the old days, they had a
phone in the heel as well.

953
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:44,561
How do I get it back in?

954
01:07:44,663 --> 01:07:47,382
It is coated with one
of the fastest-acting

955
01:07:47,407 --> 01:07:50,187
neurotoxins known to
man, so very carefully.

956
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,975
I had a lot of fun with this.

957
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:58,781
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

958
01:07:59,382 --> 01:08:01,438
Poison. Harmless when ingested.

959
01:08:01,463 --> 01:08:03,916
But at a time,
convenient to you...

960
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:06,998
it can be remotely activated.

961
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:08,301
Primed.

962
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:10,506
Lethal.

963
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:15,226
And what about these? What do these do?
Electrocute you?

964
01:08:15,327 --> 01:08:17,976
- Don't be ridiculous. It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up...

965
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:20,627
If you want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

966
01:08:20,727 --> 01:08:23,540
A gentleman traditionally wears
the signet on his left hand, but

967
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:26,162
a Kingsman wears it on whatever
hand happens to be dominant.

968
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,245
If you touch the contact behind the ring,
it delivers 50,000 volts.

969
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,454
And what about them? What
makes them so special?

970
01:08:33,755 --> 01:08:36,761
Nothing. That technology is caught up
with the spy world.

971
01:08:38,565 --> 01:08:40,263
Put it back, Eggsy.

972
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,880
Perfect timing. Gentleman's just finished.

973
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:52,294
Mr. DeVere.

974
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:55,532
What a coincidence.

975
01:08:55,557 --> 01:08:59,132
You're totally the
reason I'm here.

976
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:04,190
When you left my house, I was searching for
that dope-ass smoking jacket you had on.

977
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:08,127
And since I'm going as Royal Ascot, apparently
you need one of these penguin suits...

978
01:09:08,628 --> 01:09:11,333
Here I am. What are you doing here?

979
01:09:11,634 --> 01:09:14,039
What's up man? Richmond Valentine.

980
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,528
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

981
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:20,453
Another coincidence. So am I.

982
01:09:20,954 --> 01:09:24,160
- Did you have any chance to think further on my proposal?
- Most definitely.

983
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:27,768
My people will be getting in
touch with you very soon.

984
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:28,894
I guarantee it.

985
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:33,944
A word of advice: Ascot requires top hat.

986
01:09:34,682 --> 01:09:38,440
I might suggest Lock & Co.
Hatters,

987
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:39,717
St. James.

988
01:09:39,793 --> 01:09:41,993
"Lox", as in smoked fish?

989
01:09:42,018 --> 01:09:43,952
As in "locked up".

990
01:09:46,908 --> 01:09:50,050
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

991
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:52,921
You all talk so funny.

992
01:09:59,535 --> 01:10:02,673
Gentlemen, would you look after him please?

993
01:10:15,268 --> 01:10:18,274
Now this is a dope-ass top hat.

994
01:10:20,278 --> 01:10:23,485
Gazelle, lets go Ascotting.

995
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:28,996
<i>Your hat is fine Bill, come on.
Don't make me late for the queen.</i>

996
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:32,504
<i>Come on, Gazelle. We're gonna be late.</i>

997
01:10:32,905 --> 01:10:35,911
<i>How far is Ascot? How far?</i>

998
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,375
Merlin said you wanted
to see me, sir?

999
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,402
Sit down.

1000
01:10:48,638 --> 01:10:51,644
Pretty dog. What's his name?

1001
01:10:51,744 --> 01:10:52,600
J.B.

1002
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:55,016
- As in "James Bond"?
- No.

1003
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:59,460
- "Jason Bourne"?
- No. Jack Bauer.

1004
01:11:01,055 --> 01:11:02,166
Bravo.

1005
01:11:02,767 --> 01:11:05,468
It pains me to admit it,
Eggsy, but I think that

1006
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:08,303
one day you might be as
good a spy as any of them.

1007
01:11:15,795 --> 01:11:17,359
Take it.

1008
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:25,415
Shoot the dog.

1009
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:33,933
This weapon is live.

1010
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,041
Shoot the dog.

1011
01:12:16,422 --> 01:12:17,925
Give me the gun.

1012
01:12:28,748 --> 01:12:30,952
At least the girl's got balls,

1013
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,437
Get out.

1014
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:38,091
I knew you couldn't make it.

1015
01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:42,978
Go home.

1016
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:47,186
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

1017
01:13:11,036 --> 01:13:16,047
Welcome to Kingsman, Lancelot.

1018
01:13:42,402 --> 01:13:45,609
Oh god, I've been so worried about you.

1019
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:50,965
Oh my Dais, look how big you've got.

1020
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,113
- Where is he?
- I am fine.

1021
01:13:58,138 --> 01:14:00,700
Eggsy, please please, just
don't get involved...

1022
01:14:00,776 --> 01:14:03,922
No, I should never have
left you on your own.

1023
01:14:03,948 --> 01:14:05,384
This stops right now.

1024
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:06,501
Be right back.

1025
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,765
Oh Mugsy, so you're back?

1026
01:14:14,865 --> 01:14:16,820
You nicked a fucking taxi now?

1027
01:14:17,877 --> 01:14:20,546
Yeah. Can I have a word about my mom's
black eye?

1028
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:23,079
You wanna have a word with
me, you get out of that cab,

1029
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:25,506
I'll knock you straight back
down on your fucking arse.

1030
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:30,550
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

1031
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:36,076
Go on lads. There'll be two hits:
Me and him and then he and the floor.

1032
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:41,025
Come on in, you prick.
Let's see what you got, eh.

1033
01:14:41,126 --> 01:14:42,308
What are you doing?

1034
01:14:43,518 --> 01:14:45,382
Remote car.
What are you doing?

1035
01:14:45,674 --> 01:14:47,029
Now you've gone all bollocks.

1036
01:14:48,054 --> 01:14:49,870
Come on, he'll beat my fucking mother.

1037
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:52,380
Come back when you've grown a pair. Mugsy.

1038
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:16,856
You throw away

1039
01:15:16,881 --> 01:15:18,694
your biggest opportunity

1040
01:15:18,718 --> 01:15:20,305
over a fucking dog.

1041
01:15:20,357 --> 01:15:23,721
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

1042
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:27,009
You shot a dog just
to get a fucking job?

1043
01:15:27,034 --> 01:15:28,075
Yes, I did.

1044
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:34,276
Mr Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit.

1045
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:38,446
You shot your dog
and had it stuffed?

1046
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:40,349
You fucking freak.

1047
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:41,399
No. I shot my dog and

1048
01:15:41,424 --> 01:15:43,523
then I brought him home
and continued to care

1049
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:46,487
for him for the next eleven years
until he died of pancreatitis.

1050
01:15:47,565 --> 01:15:50,067
- What?
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

1051
01:15:50,636 --> 01:15:52,641
It was a fucking blank.

1052
01:15:52,946 --> 01:15:54,852
Remember Amelia?

1053
01:15:54,876 --> 01:15:55,481
Yeah

1054
01:15:55,482 --> 01:15:59,791
She didn't drown. She works in our tech
department in Berlin. She's fine.

1055
01:15:59,891 --> 01:16:03,899
Limits must be tested. A Kingsman only condones
the risking of a life to save another.

1056
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:07,105
As my father saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his?

1057
01:16:07,206 --> 01:16:09,540
What you've get him stuffed here also?

1058
01:16:10,914 --> 01:16:14,121
Can't you see that everything I have done
has been about trying to repay him?

1059
01:16:19,732 --> 01:16:20,865
Harry, listen to this.

1060
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:23,361
Valentine's alarm is
saying something of note.

1061
01:16:23,741 --> 01:16:26,078
<i>You know what I love about pen and paper?</i>

1062
01:16:26,447 --> 01:16:28,952
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1063
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:32,660
Our worldwide tour was a complete success.

1064
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,451
We have total coverall.

1065
01:16:35,552 --> 01:16:39,307
- Like when all your numbers in bingo are crossed out.
- Bingo!

1066
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:43,658
Bingo, the game.
You have played Bingo, right?

1067
01:16:43,783 --> 01:16:45,787
Do I look like I play bingo?

1068
01:16:47,779 --> 01:16:48,948
Point is...

1069
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:53,704
<i>if our tests go well at church tomorrow,
we are good to go.</i>

1070
01:16:54,004 --> 01:16:56,675
South Glade Mission Church.

1071
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,716
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
- Will do

1072
01:16:59,817 --> 01:17:02,522
- I am so sorry. I'm gonna do..
- You should be.

1073
01:17:02,723 --> 01:17:05,428
You stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

1074
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:11,638
"Kentucky, U.S.A"

1075
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,646
<i>And I say to you: Bear witness.</i>

1076
01:17:14,892 --> 01:17:18,039
Watch the news. Watch the news.

1077
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:22,914
AIDS, floods
The blood of the innocents spilled.

1078
01:17:23,015 --> 01:17:28,026
And yet there are those
who doubt this is the wrath of God.

1079
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:33,638
Our filthy government condones sodomy.

1080
01:17:33,938 --> 01:17:36,443
Divorce, abortion.

1081
01:17:36,844 --> 01:17:39,430
And yet some still doubt,

1082
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:43,281
this is the work
of the Antichrist.

1083
01:17:43,595 --> 01:17:47,834
You do not have to be a
Jew, a nigger, a whore...

1084
01:17:47,935 --> 01:17:51,537
or an atheistic science
loving evolution spouter.

1085
01:17:51,703 --> 01:17:53,003
<i>Charming sermon.</i>

1086
01:17:53,028 --> 01:17:55,121
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

1087
01:17:55,300 --> 01:18:00,010
So my friends, although he is a just God,
he is justly...

1088
01:18:00,181 --> 01:18:03,004
The One and there will be no turning back

1089
01:18:04,853 --> 01:18:06,233
Are you sure we
are out of range?

1090
01:18:06,258 --> 01:18:08,084
We're over a 1000 feet away.
What's wrong?

1091
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,166
- What if the calculations are wrong?
- You just have to trust me.

1092
01:18:12,347 --> 01:18:14,922
Jews, nigger, fag lovers.

1093
01:18:15,075 --> 01:18:18,582
And the devil is burning
them for all eternity.

1094
01:18:18,682 --> 01:18:19,885
Excuse me.

1095
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:22,412
Where are you going?

1096
01:18:22,437 --> 01:18:24,418
Hey, what's your problem?

1097
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:28,567
I am a Catholic whore,
currently enjoying congress

1098
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:31,408
out of wedlock with my
black Jewish boyfriend...

1099
01:18:31,484 --> 01:18:33,929
who works in a military abortion clinic.

1100
01:18:34,114 --> 01:18:37,747
So hail Satan. And have a
lovely afternoon, madam.

1101
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,126
Oh shit, he's leaving. I'm
starting the test now.

1102
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:46,941
Hope enough of these
freaks have our SIM cards.

1103
01:18:51,449 --> 01:18:53,453
Ask you to sit down...

1104
01:18:53,554 --> 01:18:56,702
Leave this church like the infidel you are.

1105
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,581
You will eat your babies.
You will drown in the blood of the Lord.

1106
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:07,879
He will cast.

1107
01:19:13,944 --> 01:19:15,179
Holy fuck.

1108
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:18,777
Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

1109
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,751
Jesus...

1110
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:06,007
<i>Galahad, can you hear me?</i>

1111
01:20:06,508 --> 01:20:09,715
Harry, Harry.. what the heck is going on?

1112
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,842
Just turn the volume down please.

1113
01:20:14,124 --> 01:20:15,836
I didn't expect it to
be that effective.

1114
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:17,656
What kind of response
are we talking of?

1115
01:20:18,133 --> 01:20:19,335
100%.

1116
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:23,544
So everyone's been infected
Whether they have SIM card or not?

1117
01:20:23,745 --> 01:20:26,250
And its added benefit of
wiping out the Kingsman.

1118
01:20:26,651 --> 01:20:28,303
Not yet.

1119
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,073
Oh you need to see this.

1120
01:23:21,918 --> 01:23:25,897
What did you do to me?
I had no control.

1121
01:23:27,129 --> 01:23:29,334
I killed all those people.

1122
01:23:30,537 --> 01:23:33,042
- I wanted to.
- Clever, isn't it?

1123
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:36,342
In simple terms, its a
neurological wave that triggers

1124
01:23:36,367 --> 01:23:39,565
the centers of aggression
and switches off inhibitor.

1125
01:23:39,656 --> 01:23:43,163
Transmitted through your nasty
free SIM cards, I assume?

1126
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,099
You know what this is like?

1127
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:51,681
Its like those old movies we both love.

1128
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:53,986
Now I'm gonna tell you my whole plan...

1129
01:23:54,086 --> 01:23:57,994
and then I'm gonna come up with some
absurd, convoluted way to kill you...

1130
01:23:58,094 --> 01:24:01,201
and then you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

1131
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:03,506
That sounds good to me.

1132
01:24:04,307 --> 01:24:06,312
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1133
01:24:10,749 --> 01:24:12,753
No

1134
01:24:20,742 --> 01:24:22,507
Is he dead?

1135
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:25,131
That's usually what happens when
you shoot someone in the head.

1136
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:29,625
- It feels good, Right?
- No no, it does not feel good. It felt fucking awful.

1137
01:24:29,961 --> 01:24:32,517
What? You just killed how
many people in that church.

1138
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:33,392
This is one guy.

1139
01:24:33,469 --> 01:24:35,673
No..No... No, they killed each other.

1140
01:24:37,978 --> 01:24:40,514
Okay, send off the
countdown clock

1141
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:42,512
This party starts tomorrow.

1142
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:18,719
Arthur?

1143
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,476
<i>- Are you there?
- Sadly, I am.</i>

1144
01:25:25,077 --> 01:25:28,076
Assemble the Kingsman.

1145
01:25:32,593 --> 01:25:36,624
<i>Can't you see that everything I have done
has been about trying to repay him?</i>

1146
01:25:57,036 --> 01:25:59,227
<i>I see a young man
with potential,</i>

1147
01:25:59,252 --> 01:26:02,279
<i>who wants to do something
good with his life.</i>

1148
01:26:11,021 --> 01:26:13,026
<i>Kingsman</i>

1149
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:21,996
Arthur, Harry is dead.

1150
01:26:22,598 --> 01:26:24,552
Galahad is dead.

1151
01:26:25,103 --> 01:26:28,109
Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.

1152
01:26:28,209 --> 01:26:30,831
Well then you know what
that psycho's doing.

1153
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:33,522
How many people in the world
have got those SIM cards?

1154
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,394
Valentine can send a signal
to any of them.

1155
01:26:35,419 --> 01:26:38,654
All of them. If they all go homicidal at
the same time, then..

1156
01:26:38,731 --> 01:26:41,027
Indeed, and thanks to
Galahad recordings

1157
01:26:41,153 --> 01:26:43,389
we have Valentine's confession.

1158
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:47,149
The intelligence has been passed on to the
relevant authorities.

1159
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:48,853
Our work is complete.

1160
01:26:48,878 --> 01:26:53,386
And a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend it is too.

1161
01:26:54,164 --> 01:26:55,366
And that's it?

1162
01:26:56,368 --> 01:26:58,072
Come sit down, boy.

1163
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:06,189
This is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy.

1164
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:10,999
And we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1165
01:27:11,099 --> 01:27:13,876
Galahad was very fond of you.

1166
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:20,118
And on this occasion, I think it is
acceptable for us...

1167
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,824
to bend the rules a little.

1168
01:27:24,327 --> 01:27:27,834
- These are all Kingsmen?
- Yes, our founder members.

1169
01:27:29,538 --> 01:27:32,043
I want you to join me in a toast.

1170
01:27:33,947 --> 01:27:35,150
To Galahad.

1171
01:27:37,712 --> 01:27:39,716
To Galahad.

1172
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:46,056
Harry said you don't like
to break the rules, often.

1173
01:27:46,081 --> 01:27:47,110
Why now?

1174
01:27:47,248 --> 01:27:48,935
You're very good, Eggsy.

1175
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,106
Perhaps I'll make you my
proposal for Galahad's position.

1176
01:27:53,288 --> 01:27:55,752
Provided we can see eye to eye

1177
01:27:55,777 --> 01:27:58,322
on certain political matters.

1178
01:28:01,205 --> 01:28:03,148
Can you guess..

1179
01:28:03,173 --> 01:28:05,265
What this is?

1180
01:28:05,622 --> 01:28:07,687
I don't have to.
Harry showed it.

1181
01:28:07,712 --> 01:28:08,987
You click it, I die.

1182
01:28:09,121 --> 01:28:11,326
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1183
01:28:12,725 --> 01:28:13,831
Bravo.

1184
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:17,338
Valentine won you over. Somehow

1185
01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:20,545
Once he explained, I understood.

1186
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:23,151
When you get a virus, you get a fever.

1187
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:27,252
That's the human body raising its
core temperature to kill the virus.

1188
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:32,169
Planet Earth works the same way:
Global warming is the fever...

1189
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,334
Mankind is the virus.

1190
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:37,505
We are making our planet sick.

1191
01:28:37,781 --> 01:28:40,268
A cull is our only hope.

1192
01:28:40,387 --> 01:28:43,095
If we do not reduce our
population ourselves,

1193
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,122
there's only two
ways this can go:

1194
01:28:45,698 --> 01:28:49,706
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.

1195
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:53,104
- Either way...
- The result is the same:

1196
01:28:53,715 --> 01:28:55,919
The virus dies.

1197
01:28:56,721 --> 01:29:00,069
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

1198
01:29:00,329 --> 01:29:02,934
If we don't do something, Nature will.

1199
01:29:03,034 --> 01:29:07,043
Sometimes a culling is the only way to
ensure that this species survives.

1200
01:29:08,045 --> 01:29:12,955
And History will see Valentine as the man
who saved humanity from extinction.

1201
01:29:13,055 --> 01:29:16,062
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

1202
01:29:16,462 --> 01:29:20,551
All his rich mates, they get to live. And then when
he thinks its worth saving, he's keeping them safe.

1203
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:25,281
- Whether they agree with him or not.
- And you, Eggsy.

1204
01:29:25,582 --> 01:29:32,058
In Harry's honor, I am inviting you to
be part of a new world.

1205
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,206
It's time to make your decision.

1206
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:46,500
I would rather be with Harry.

1207
01:29:46,526 --> 01:29:47,528
Thanks.

1208
01:29:47,828 --> 01:29:49,031
So be it.

1209
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,580
The problem with us
common types is,

1210
01:30:08,605 --> 01:30:10,809
that we are light fingered.

1211
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:13,510
Kingsman's taught me a lot.

1212
01:30:13,535 --> 01:30:15,009
But slight of hand...

1213
01:30:15,486 --> 01:30:17,190
<i>Yes, they're our our founder members.</i>

1214
01:30:19,804 --> 01:30:21,699
I had that done already.

1215
01:30:24,445 --> 01:30:28,760
You dirty little fucking prick.

1216
01:31:03,186 --> 01:31:07,883
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down.
It's verified.

1217
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:12,042
Arthur's phone's just
received an update text about

1218
01:31:12,067 --> 01:31:13,833
getting to safety. We
don't have a lot time.

1219
01:31:13,909 --> 01:31:16,680
- What you gonna do?
- The question is what we gonna do.

1220
01:31:17,015 --> 01:31:19,521
God knows who's in Valentine's
pocket and who's not.

1221
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:21,953
We've no choice.

1222
01:31:22,928 --> 01:31:25,132
We are gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

1223
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:29,723
Follow me.

1224
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:52,890
- The fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

1225
01:31:52,991 --> 01:31:54,328
What you're playing with...

1226
01:31:54,429 --> 01:31:57,192
is a prototype personal
trans-atmospheric vehicle.

1227
01:31:57,293 --> 01:32:00,350
It was developed as part of
Reagan's Star Wars project.

1228
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,734
Its pretty basic, but
it should still work.

1229
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,317
We're going to take out one
of Valentine's satellites.

1230
01:32:05,617 --> 01:32:08,123
We're gonna break the chain.
Stop the signal.

1231
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,327
It will take him a couple
of hours to reboot it.

1232
01:32:10,528 --> 01:32:14,706
Which buys us enough time for you to get me
into Valentine's mainframe...

1233
01:32:14,807 --> 01:32:16,811
so I can shut it down.

1234
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:21,150
Lancelot, you are going to be using it.
Get into your halo suit.

1235
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:32,674
Swedish Air Force

1236
01:32:33,157 --> 01:32:35,981
<i>The Swedish Prime Minister requesting
permission to land.</i>

1237
01:32:41,192 --> 01:32:43,088
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1238
01:32:46,804 --> 01:32:48,808
- Please.
- Thank you.

1239
01:32:49,309 --> 01:32:52,991
- So how many more are we expecting?
- Not many. Most have their own bunkers.

1240
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,311
I figure we're just getting
really nervous once.

1241
01:32:56,825 --> 01:32:58,528
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1242
01:33:00,132 --> 01:33:03,439
It seems the implant can emit
some kind of counter signal...

1243
01:33:03,539 --> 01:33:06,934
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM card.

1244
01:33:07,147 --> 01:33:09,351
The waves that turns everyone
into a psycho killer?

1245
01:33:09,451 --> 01:33:12,010
Quite. But what they probably didn't
tell anyone...

1246
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:16,142
Is that it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command.

1247
01:33:16,466 --> 01:33:20,544
Valentine's selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning.

1248
01:33:20,976 --> 01:33:23,822
He had to be sure that it didn't
blow up to the wrong people beforehand.

1249
01:33:23,882 --> 01:33:25,829
And how does this help us right now?

1250
01:33:26,788 --> 01:33:29,493
It doesn't. Roxy, here we go.

1251
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:45,487
The higher you go,
The more the balloons expand.

1252
01:33:45,928 --> 01:33:49,435
When you reach the edge of the atmosphere,
they will explode.

1253
01:33:50,137 --> 01:33:52,508
You need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

1254
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:53,802
The edge of the atmosphere.

1255
01:33:53,945 --> 01:33:57,151
And once you've deployed, you'll need
to release for descent fast.

1256
01:33:58,154 --> 01:33:59,397
Good luck.

1257
01:34:01,661 --> 01:34:03,258
You can do this, okay?

1258
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:06,707
Eggsy, come on.
Time is not our friend.

1259
01:34:29,419 --> 01:34:32,726
Getting in with Arthur's invitation,
you gonna need to blend in.

1260
01:34:32,826 --> 01:34:36,554
- I'm supposed to be Arthur?
- His invitation's in his phone.

1261
01:34:36,683 --> 01:34:39,140
Give them this and give
his real name: Chester King.

1262
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:41,845
- And what about you?
- I'm the pilot. I'm gonna stay here.

1263
01:34:42,547 --> 01:34:44,084
Is that gonna fit me?

1264
01:34:44,109 --> 01:34:46,377
A bespoke suit always fits.

1265
01:34:46,655 --> 01:34:49,286
Just be grateful Harry
had it made for you.

1266
01:34:49,311 --> 01:34:50,313
Get dressed.

1267
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,256
The fuck's wrong with them?

1268
01:34:53,281 --> 01:34:56,099
I don't know. Could have something
to do with mass genocide?

1269
01:34:56,175 --> 01:34:58,266
Give me the mic.

1270
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:03,190
Everybody listen up.

1271
01:35:04,689 --> 01:35:07,104
What the fuck wrong with you people?

1272
01:35:07,299 --> 01:35:12,810
I just want to remind you that today
is a day of celebration.

1273
01:35:13,712 --> 01:35:17,234
We must put aside
all thoughts of death,

1274
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:19,482
and focus on birth.

1275
01:35:19,749 --> 01:35:23,572
The birth of a new age.

1276
01:35:23,934 --> 01:35:28,142
<i>We mustn't mourn those who
give their lives today.</i>

1277
01:35:28,944 --> 01:35:31,349
<i>We should honor their sacrifice.</i>

1278
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:33,353
She got my number to call me back...?

1279
01:35:33,454 --> 01:35:37,161
<i>And their role in saving
the human race.</i>

1280
01:35:39,023 --> 01:35:44,016
We must put aside doubts and guilts.

1281
01:35:44,276 --> 01:35:48,485
You are the chosen people.

1282
01:35:49,387 --> 01:35:54,398
When folks tell their kids the story
of Noah's Ark, is Noah the bad guy?

1283
01:35:54,899 --> 01:35:57,604
Is God the bad guy?

1284
01:35:57,905 --> 01:36:00,911
How about the animals marching two by two?

1285
01:36:01,412 --> 01:36:02,915
Of course not.

1286
01:36:03,517 --> 01:36:08,527
Yes, that's it. So let's turn
that frown upside down.

1287
01:36:09,128 --> 01:36:14,859
Eat, drink and party.

1288
01:36:15,742 --> 01:36:18,749
And I'll see you all in the new age.

1289
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:47,055
<i>Rox, its me. How's the view?</i>

1290
01:36:50,014 --> 01:36:52,419
<i>- Hideous.
- Mine's pretty sweet.</i>

1291
01:36:52,519 --> 01:36:55,380
<i>- They made you one of these suits yet?
- No, not yet.</i>

1292
01:36:55,526 --> 01:36:57,948
<i>That's something to
look forward to then.</i>

1293
01:36:57,973 --> 01:37:00,683
<i>We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.</i>

1294
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,449
<i>Good luck.</i>

1295
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,662
Looking good, Eggsy.

1296
01:37:14,593 --> 01:37:17,020
Feeling good, Merlin.

1297
01:37:22,683 --> 01:37:26,730
This is November 2-4-7 Charlie Kilo
requesting permission to land.

1298
01:37:29,898 --> 01:37:31,401
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

1299
01:37:36,362 --> 01:37:38,751
Fuck me.

1300
01:38:05,264 --> 01:38:07,475
Eggsy, We're on.

1301
01:38:22,408 --> 01:38:23,611
Chester King.

1302
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:26,034
Mr. King, welcome.

1303
01:38:26,221 --> 01:38:30,598
I'm sure you've adhered to Mr Valentine's
strict no weapons policy...

1304
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:31,271
but if you don't object..

1305
01:38:31,287 --> 01:38:32,856
- Of course.
- Thank you

1306
01:38:33,431 --> 01:38:35,524
Do you have any luggage?

1307
01:38:36,538 --> 01:38:40,446
Congratulations, Mycroft. You just
graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1308
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:43,177
- Cheeky.
- Understood?

1309
01:38:43,202 --> 01:38:44,204
Good.

1310
01:38:45,657 --> 01:38:46,914
Thank you.

1311
01:39:13,014 --> 01:39:16,157
<i>Eggsy, find a laptop.
Get me online.</i>

1312
01:39:16,182 --> 01:39:18,049
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

1313
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:21,232
<i>And remember: Try to blend in.</i>

1314
01:39:21,532 --> 01:39:23,536
Would sir care for a drink?

1315
01:39:24,037 --> 01:39:25,489
Martini. Gin,

1316
01:39:25,515 --> 01:39:27,970
not vodka, obviously.

1317
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:31,804
Stirred for 10 seconds while glancing
it an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1318
01:39:31,829 --> 01:39:33,080
Thank you.

1319
01:39:36,163 --> 01:39:38,129
Merlin, you clock in this?

1320
01:39:38,154 --> 01:39:40,195
Yes I am. Stay focused.

1321
01:39:40,873 --> 01:39:43,378
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1322
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:44,881
<i>Yes, Merlin.</i>

1323
01:39:46,384 --> 01:39:48,589
<i>Eggsy, get me online. Now.</i>

1324
01:39:49,892 --> 01:39:51,094
Yep. I'm on it.

1325
01:39:52,197 --> 01:39:54,730
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1326
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:56,730
These balloons won't
last much longer.

1327
01:39:57,407 --> 01:39:59,111
<i>Start to engage missile.</i>

1328
01:40:14,744 --> 01:40:17,750
The society is dead.
Long live society.

1329
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:20,456
Amen to that.

1330
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,389
- Morten Lindström.
- Chester King.

1331
01:40:24,414 --> 01:40:25,791
How'd you get online?

1332
01:40:25,867 --> 01:40:29,656
Oh well, it's a closed network, you see.
For authorized connections only.

1333
01:40:33,383 --> 01:40:34,986
I've got a fix on the satellite.

1334
01:40:35,087 --> 01:40:35,774
Do you have the correct time?

1335
01:40:35,775 --> 01:40:37,410
I think I'm still
on my last time zone.

1336
01:40:37,482 --> 01:40:39,293
Oh yeah. Lets see now.

1337
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:55,217
Eggsy, I'm in. Get
your arse back to the plane now.

1338
01:40:55,218 --> 01:40:56,011
I'm on my way.

1339
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:59,538
Lancelot, good luck.
Firing in three, two...

1340
01:41:06,823 --> 01:41:07,956
Nice and slow.

1341
01:41:08,057 --> 01:41:09,438
What the fuck are
you doing here?

1342
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:11,574
Well, my family was naturally invited.
Obviously.

1343
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,685
Now get the fuck up. Slowly.

1344
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:16,569
Lancelot, hurry up and fire.

1345
01:41:16,594 --> 01:41:18,219
The other balloon is gonna blow.

1346
01:41:18,381 --> 01:41:21,452
<i>Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second.</i>

1347
01:41:23,292 --> 01:41:26,277
Valentine, I've caught a fucking spy.

1348
01:41:26,645 --> 01:41:28,304
V-Glass, zoom.

1349
01:41:29,242 --> 01:41:31,246
It's that young valet.

1350
01:41:34,167 --> 01:41:35,635
Son of a bitch.

1351
01:41:35,735 --> 01:41:36,907
<i>Got it.</i>

1352
01:41:47,526 --> 01:41:49,142
Oh shit. Sound the alarm.

1353
01:41:51,211 --> 01:41:52,504
I'm not taking any chances.

1354
01:41:52,675 --> 01:41:55,365
Okay, you send out two minutes warnings.
I'm starting the override.

1355
01:41:58,361 --> 01:41:59,864
<i>Countdown initiated.</i>

1356
01:42:09,184 --> 01:42:10,687
- You see him?
- Right here.

1357
01:42:19,907 --> 01:42:23,113
Eggsy, take a left. Two guards up ahead.

1358
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:37,143
Lancelot, release now.

1359
01:42:47,565 --> 01:42:50,571
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead and then right.
There's two more.</i>

1360
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,886
All right, everybody on your feet.
Countdown to V-Day.

1361
01:42:58,387 --> 01:43:00,091
<i>Welcome into new age.</i>

1362
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:27,321
Eggsy, next left. Got a narrow tunnel.

1363
01:43:35,962 --> 01:43:37,282
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:35,296
Biometric Security Detected

1384
01:44:38,898 --> 01:44:40,457
What's going on?

1385
01:44:40,483 --> 01:44:42,430
Is there a problem?

1386
01:44:43,207 --> 01:44:46,214
Come on, there's no need for guns.
I'm just a pilot.

1387
01:44:49,288 --> 01:44:51,292
Fuck.. Merlin.

1388
01:44:52,928 --> 01:44:54,431
Get in here.

1389
01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:59,987
Come on.

1390
01:45:03,777 --> 01:45:06,216
- Let's go the fuck out of here.
- We can't.

1391
01:45:06,315 --> 01:45:08,723
I can't get into
Valentine's machine.

1392
01:45:08,748 --> 01:45:10,585
It's got biometric security.

1393
01:45:11,233 --> 01:45:14,440
You're gonna have to get in there and
make sure his hand never touches that desk.

1394
01:45:14,637 --> 01:45:16,161
You taking a fucking piss?

1395
01:45:16,186 --> 01:45:17,300
I'm afraid not.

1396
01:45:21,062 --> 01:45:22,768
Let's me have that then.

1397
01:45:23,345 --> 01:45:24,667
This is mine.

1398
01:45:24,692 --> 01:45:26,927
I'll show you yours.

1399
01:45:44,307 --> 01:45:45,676
Good choice.

1400
01:45:48,365 --> 01:45:49,902
How long to relink
the satellite chain?

1401
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:51,232
It can take an hour.
Maybe two.

1402
01:45:51,308 --> 01:45:53,743
Bullshit. Just bring these
two closer together.

1403
01:45:53,744 --> 01:45:55,609
But that's not yours.

1404
01:46:00,572 --> 01:46:02,516
V-glass, call E-man.

1405
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:06,862
E, its V. Listen man, I got a
little hiccup on this end.

1406
01:46:06,887 --> 01:46:08,109
I need a piggyback.

1407
01:46:08,186 --> 01:46:12,056
One of my satellites just went
down but is right next to one of yours.

1408
01:46:12,695 --> 01:46:16,403
You read my mind. How long before you
make that happen?

1409
01:46:19,409 --> 01:46:20,588
Go.

1410
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,624
We should be coming back online.

1411
01:46:29,532 --> 01:46:30,635
10%

1412
01:46:35,343 --> 01:46:37,578
Valentine using someone else's satellite.

1413
01:46:37,603 --> 01:46:38,716
He's gonna reconnect the chain.

1414
01:46:38,741 --> 01:46:40,586
Its gonna take him no time at all.

1415
01:46:40,654 --> 01:46:42,157
Its at 20%.

1416
01:47:00,295 --> 01:47:03,502
Eggsy, Valentine's got a present for you.
Get a move on.

1417
01:47:37,273 --> 01:47:40,479
- Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?
- Not yet. But he will be soon.

1418
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:41,827
Good.

1419
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,980
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1420
01:48:09,445 --> 01:48:10,612
As am I.

1421
01:48:10,737 --> 01:48:13,387
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

1422
01:48:13,549 --> 01:48:16,054
Rox, I need a favor.

1423
01:48:16,429 --> 01:48:19,906
Call my mum and tell her to
lock herself away from Dean

1424
01:48:19,931 --> 01:48:21,089
and the baby.

1425
01:48:22,568 --> 01:48:24,071
And tell her I love her.

1426
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:41,608
Merlin, you remember those implants you
said were of no use to us?

1427
01:48:42,858 --> 01:48:44,803
Any chance you could turn them on?

1428
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:51,328
My turn to play, Valentine.

1429
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:02,251
Oh no. What the fuck is he...

1430
01:49:02,275 --> 01:49:04,279
I cant stop this.

1431
01:49:15,095 --> 01:49:17,099
ACTIVATE SECURITY IMPLANTS?

1432
01:49:17,222 --> 01:49:18,766
Yes, please.

1433
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:22,694
SECURITY IMPLANTS ACTIVATED

1434
01:49:22,718 --> 01:49:24,722
Nooo....

1435
01:50:22,311 --> 01:50:24,202
That was fucking spectacular.

1436
01:50:24,435 --> 01:50:26,778
Merlin, you're a fucking genius.

1437
01:50:27,243 --> 01:50:30,580
What the fuck is happening out there?

1438
01:50:34,856 --> 01:50:36,889
Aren't you that princess
who went missing?

1439
01:50:36,914 --> 01:50:37,954
Can you get me out?

1440
01:50:38,152 --> 01:50:39,906
Well if I do, will
you give me a kiss?

1441
01:50:39,931 --> 01:50:41,683
I've always wanted
to kiss a princess.

1442
01:50:41,761 --> 01:50:44,406
If you get me out right now,
I will give you more than just a kiss.

1443
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,270
You motherfucker.

1444
01:50:47,371 --> 01:50:49,168
<i>Did you really I
was stupid enough</i>

1445
01:50:49,193 --> 01:50:51,604
<i>to implant one of those
things in my own head?</i>

1446
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:53,584
<i>What are you? Fucking crazy?</i>

1447
01:50:54,587 --> 01:50:57,092
All those innocent people
killed and for what?

1448
01:50:57,793 --> 01:51:00,499
You didn't stop shit.

1449
01:51:02,203 --> 01:51:04,009
Fine, I have locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

1450
01:51:04,017 --> 01:51:07,438
As I said, put your daughter in the
bathroom and throw away the key.

1451
01:51:07,614 --> 01:51:09,768
It's still happening.

1452
01:51:10,374 --> 01:51:12,802
<i>- You fucking insane?
- Just do it.</i>

1453
01:51:39,982 --> 01:51:41,828
Eggsy, the signal's started.

1454
01:51:41,853 --> 01:51:45,016
Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now.

1455
01:51:45,193 --> 01:51:47,698
Sorry, love. Gotta save the world.

1456
01:51:47,798 --> 01:51:51,292
If you save the world,
would you do me in the asshole?

1457
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:54,347
I will be right back.

1458
01:51:55,815 --> 01:51:56,939
Good luck.

1459
01:52:03,531 --> 01:52:04,852
London.

1460
01:52:33,042 --> 01:52:34,188
Rio.

1461
01:52:49,999 --> 01:52:51,131
Get down.

1462
01:52:52,835 --> 01:52:54,037
You did it.

1463
01:53:03,257 --> 01:53:05,298
This glass is not gonna hold long.

1464
01:53:06,964 --> 01:53:08,592
You stay here.

1465
01:53:10,672 --> 01:53:13,667
- Merlin, quickly how do I get up there?
- Keep shooting. I'm find a route.

1466
01:53:13,717 --> 01:53:15,621
Understood.

1467
01:53:50,856 --> 01:53:53,863
We are back up.

1468
01:54:01,178 --> 01:54:02,681
This is great.

1469
01:54:10,952 --> 01:54:13,076
Eggsy, fucking get on with it.

1470
01:54:13,685 --> 01:54:15,189
Kick his ass, darling.

1471
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:24,126
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai.

1472
01:54:32,673 --> 01:54:34,677
Kill that motherfucking...

1473
01:54:51,813 --> 01:54:54,366
Eggsy, the world is going to shit.

1474
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:06,114
- Is he dead yet?
- Not yet.

1475
01:55:06,215 --> 01:55:08,920
Stop playing with your foot. Kill him.

1476
01:56:27,786 --> 01:56:28,988
Gazelle.

1477
01:56:29,012 --> 01:56:31,017
Gazelle!

1478
01:56:42,016 --> 01:56:44,020
<i>Come on.</i>

1479
01:56:46,533 --> 01:56:47,732
<i>Kill him.</i>

1480
01:57:30,818 --> 01:57:32,321
<i>Well done son.</i>

1481
01:57:33,612 --> 01:57:34,616
Yes!

1482
01:57:34,855 --> 01:57:35,556
Yes! Eggsy

1483
01:57:35,829 --> 01:57:37,440
Well done, Eggsy.

1484
01:57:37,465 --> 01:57:39,360
And you, Lancelot.

1485
01:57:41,741 --> 01:57:45,226
I am sorry. Mommy
would never hurt you.

1486
01:57:45,251 --> 01:57:47,778
Mommy would never hurt you.
I am so sorry.

1487
01:57:50,635 --> 01:57:51,762
You okay?

1488
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:57,474
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

1489
01:57:58,677 --> 01:57:59,879
He was right.

1490
01:58:15,511 --> 01:58:17,310
'Sup man?

1491
01:58:17,411 --> 01:58:21,124
Is this the part where you say some
really bad pun?

1492
01:58:21,925 --> 01:58:23,831
Its like you said to Harry:

1493
01:58:27,099 --> 01:58:29,304
This ain't that kind of movie, bro.

1494
01:58:30,944 --> 01:58:32,147
Perfect.

1495
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:53,939
Eggsy, where you going?

1496
01:58:53,965 --> 01:58:56,522
There's no need for champagne
We have got lots on the plane.

1497
01:59:03,713 --> 01:59:05,706
Did you save the world?

1498
01:59:05,731 --> 01:59:06,944
Yes I did.

1499
01:59:09,721 --> 01:59:11,856
So, You gonna come in?

1500
01:59:11,881 --> 01:59:13,304
Yes, I am.

1501
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:20,729
Merlin, this cell's locked.
How do I get in?

1502
01:59:23,054 --> 01:59:24,651
<i>26-25.</i>

1503
01:59:28,955 --> 01:59:31,722
Merlin, you're the governor.

1504
01:59:33,598 --> 01:59:35,986
<i>You owe me, Eggsy.</i>

1505
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:44,015
Eggsy

1506
01:59:48,631 --> 01:59:50,541
Oh my word.

1507
02:00:37,728 --> 02:00:40,629
Michelle, turn that shit off, its
turning me nutty.

1508
02:00:41,469 --> 02:00:43,318
I rather like that song.

1509
02:00:43,461 --> 02:00:45,386
Leave it on eh, Mom.

1510
02:00:48,776 --> 02:00:50,803
Mugsy's back.

1511
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:53,355
You finally come to have that
word with me, have you son?

1512
02:00:53,771 --> 02:00:55,415
Or are you going to run
away again and pretend

1513
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:57,014
you're getting another
coat dress like that?

1514
02:00:57,090 --> 02:00:59,094
You mean this?

1515
02:01:00,038 --> 02:01:01,693
No.

1516
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:05,393
I know this bloke who's just taken
over a tailor shop up on Seville Road.

1517
02:01:05,755 --> 02:01:07,759
He's got me a job, Mom.

1518
02:01:08,535 --> 02:01:10,539
Comes with a lot of perks.

1519
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,185
Including a house.

1520
02:01:13,992 --> 02:01:15,997
Come and live with me there, Mum.

1521
02:01:16,629 --> 02:01:18,633
- Come on.
- Sit down, you.

1522
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,818
Only place she'll be visiting is
you in fucking hospital, do you hear?

1523
02:01:22,918 --> 02:01:26,388
Just leave him alone.
Eggsy, go please. Just go away.

1524
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:29,051
All right

1525
02:01:29,254 --> 02:01:30,880
Yes, just do as mommy says.

1526
02:01:30,981 --> 02:01:33,130
Why don't you ask that tailor
friend of yours to knock up

1527
02:01:33,155 --> 02:01:35,185
a nice chicken costume,
it would suit you ya mug.

1528
02:01:38,126 --> 02:01:40,597
As a good friend once said:

1529
02:01:41,857 --> 02:01:43,199
Manners...

1530
02:01:44,706 --> 02:01:45,990
maketh...

1531
02:01:48,755 --> 02:01:50,440
man.

1532
02:01:50,783 --> 02:01:52,672
- Dean?
- Shut the fuck up.

1533
02:01:52,858 --> 02:01:55,216
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove your manners
up your fucking...

1534
02:02:00,403 --> 02:02:02,302
So...

1535
02:02:02,327 --> 02:02:06,700
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

1536
02:02:06,701 --> 02:02:07,703
The End @
