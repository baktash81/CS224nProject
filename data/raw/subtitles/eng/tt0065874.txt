1
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,246
<i>Sheriff.</i>

2
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,682
<i>Sheriff?</i>

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,684
<i>Sheriff,
do you hear me?</i>

4
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:24,088
<i>Your wife says don't forget
bring home the corn.</i>

5
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:27,659
<i>You goin' out
to Dorfin's place?</i>

6
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,594
<i>Where are you now,
Sheriff?</i>

7
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:36,868
Sheriff?

8
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,870
Sheriff, do you hear me?

9
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,806
Sheriff!

10
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:05,196
I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine

11
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:10,101
I keep my eyes wide open
all the time

12
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:15,006
I keep the ends out
for the tie that binds

13
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:17,375
Because you're mine

14
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:19,511
I walk the line

15
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:34,726
I find it very, very easy
to be true

16
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:39,297
I find myself alone
when each day is through

17
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:43,902
Yes, I'll admit
that I'm a fool for you

18
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,738
Because you're mine

19
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:48,807
I walk the line

20
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:03,722
As sure as night is dark
and day is light

21
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:08,727
I keep you on my mind
both day and night

22
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:13,632
And happiness I've known
proves that it's right

23
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,034
Because you're mine

24
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,537
I walk the line

25
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,436
You've got a way
to keep me on your side

26
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:56,274
You give me cause for love
that I can't hide

27
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:01,046
For you I know I'd even try
to turn the tide

28
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:03,582
Because you're mine

29
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,850
I walk the line

30
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:22,433
I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine

31
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:27,772
I keep my eyes wide open
all the time

32
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,677
I keep the ends out
for the tie that binds

33
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,046
Because you're mine

34
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,816
I walk the line

35
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,218
Because you're mine

36
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:42,854
I walk the line

37
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,624
Because you're mine

38
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,292
I walk the line

39
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,347
Oh, step on it, Buddy. Come
on, we can go faster than this.

40
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:26,965
Oh, the sheriff's car.

41
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,701
We're gonna get beat,
Buddy.

42
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:40,344
Oh! Oh! Oh!

43
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:46,184
Buddy, oh!

44
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,479
You all right?

45
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,615
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:20,551
<i>Get up outta there.
Yes, sir.</i>

47
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,589
Who's in the bushes?
Huh?

48
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,027
Somebody run off.

49
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:33,064
Oh, well, that was Buddy,
but he ain't but a kid.

50
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,667
He just gets scared, you know,
like kids will with the law.

51
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:43,775
He have a license? Oh, he
wasn't driving. I was driving.

52
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,277
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

53
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,980
- Your license.
- Um, you see,

54
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,183
Buddy and me was hangin' around
the house, you know, nothin' to do.

55
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,186
And, uh, he found
these here alligator shoes.

56
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,288
Wait, I'll show you.
Just a minute.

57
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,926
See, he found these here
alligator shoes up on a hillside,

58
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:06,330
and he put 'em on and he
started playin' like a boy will.

59
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,266
Well-

60
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,536
Sir, my license
ain't here.

61
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,277
- What's your name?
- Alma McCain.

62
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,279
Where do you live?

63
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,315
Up on Gatesboro Road.
We ain't been there long.

64
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,617
We was livin'
in Loomis Canyon.

65
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:30,955
- Who's we?
- My pa and me and Buddy and Clay.

66
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,825
Clay's almost 18.

67
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,727
They ain't home now.
They're workin'.

68
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,998
- Where do they work?
- Factory.

69
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,000
But it's workin',
and only for a while.

70
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,170
And we think that's
real fine for us.

71
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:53,577
That's real fine.

72
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:58,449
Mm-hmm. Uh, they're at
Kingman. They make pot handles.

73
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,688
You got a ma?
No, sir.

74
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,490
I do the cookin' and cleanin'
and look after Buddy though.

75
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:11,562
Well, maybe you don't know it,
but the way I seen it,

76
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,998
there was a boy
drivin' this truck.

77
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,668
And you're sure
not a boy now, are ya?

78
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:21,372
No, sir. No.

79
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,783
I'd appreciate it
you didn't arrest Buddy,

80
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,785
as I'm responsible
for him.

81
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,956
<i>And, uh, well,
he's real young.</i>

82
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,331
Well, I-I'd just
appreciate it, that's all.

83
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,171
Get in.

84
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,184
Tell your daddy
that Sheriff Tawes said,

85
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,586
"People who drive
oughta get a license...

86
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:45,156
and do it
in a proper manner."

87
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,358
I will, sir.
I really will.

88
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,493
And I'm much obliged
to you, Sheriff.

89
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,730
And, uh,
you best tell your brother...

90
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,666
to start wearin' shoes
his size.

91
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,969
Yes, sir.

92
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,361
Got a riddle for ya,
Daddy.

93
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,097
Hmm? You know where man learn to talk?

94
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,535
<i>'Fraid not. Man learned to
talk listenin' to parrots.</i>

95
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,209
Oh, it's just
a fool thing.

96
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,411
Eat your beans, Grampa.

97
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:45,616
You see, people have to teach
the parrot, so it can't be.

98
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,422
Dog's barkin' all night.

99
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,725
It's Andy's dog.
Gettin' old though.

100
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,996
Henry, you want
more gravy?

101
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:00,664
Sybil, I'll make more gravy
for you and the sheriff.

102
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:06,237
<i>Edith Owens's brother's
in the gospel group,</i>

103
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,173
<i>and there's gonna be a
gospel fest next weekend.</i>

104
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,175
I didn't hear ya.

105
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,878
<i>Edith Owens's brother's
in the gospel group.</i>

106
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,680
<i>That's real fine, ain't it? Real fine.</i>

107
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,758
Well, it's easier
for us here, ain't it?

108
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,294
That's just fine
for us all, don't it?

109
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,505
Now tell me again,
what did he say to you?

110
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:42,640
Well, he asked my name.

111
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:46,677
You just say your name? I
just say I'm Alma McCain.

112
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:50,248
And what did he say to that?
Exactly what did he say?

113
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:54,052
Um, he asked me
what you did.

114
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,120
And what'd you tell him,
exactly?

115
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,122
Well, I-I tell him
what you did.

116
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,058
I tell him you made
pot handles.

117
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:06,097
You mention Georgie?

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,299
No, I didn't say
nothin' about Georgie.

119
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,374
<i>You get the sugar?
Yes, sir.</i>

120
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,477
He see the sugar?
Oh, I don't know.

121
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,246
You sure?
I didn't see nothin'.

122
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,517
Well, we don't buy sugar
in Shelton no more.

123
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:35,059
Well, maybe he did see the sugar, but,
well, I didn't see him see the sugar.

124
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,164
All right.
Then what'd he do?

125
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,200
Nothin'.

126
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:46,670
How do you know he smelled
you most?

127
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:48,672
How do you know he didn't
smell the whiskey most?

128
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,611
I don't know. He just
didn't seem to, that's all.

129
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,779
She's wearing violet,
not whiskey.

130
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,982
Hey, shut up,
you hear me?

131
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,990
- Did he touch you?
- Huh?

132
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:08,025
I said,
did he touch you?

133
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,495
No.

134
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:12,430
I bet he wanted
to touch her though.

135
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,904
He wanna touch you?

136
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,178
I don't know.

137
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:46,197
If we lose
that out there,

138
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,504
we don't have
that still,

139
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,506
we ain't
got nothin'.

140
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,344
Might as well
be niggers.

141
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,825
Mornin'.
Mornin'.

142
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,496
Yeah, that'll be
all right, home.

143
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,637
Mornin', Sheriff.
Mornin'.

144
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,175
<i>You say he's giving you
real trouble.</i>

145
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,212
<i>Well, all right,
calm down.</i>

146
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,714
Sheriff, Mrs. Wesson's
on the line.

147
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,782
She says you best
get out there fast.

148
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,755
Old man Linton's plumb loco
about them cuttin' down that tree.

149
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,057
He'll be comin' over,
Mrs. Wesson.

150
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,797
<i>He is hurryin',
Mrs. Wesson.</i>

151
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:57,368
<i>Bye. You sure that tree's on her lot?</i>

152
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,605
<i>We checked the deed.</i>

153
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,641
<i>She's got every right
to cut that tree down.</i>

154
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,047
Sheriff?

155
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:14,852
I forgot to tell you...

156
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,087
there's a federal man
in town.

157
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:24,995
- Come here?
- No, he, uh,

158
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:28,999
was talkin' to Kelly in the pool
hall, and Kelly sniffed him out.

159
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:32,570
Kelly told me there's
a federal man in town.

160
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,975
Well, leave him alone.

161
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:40,978
We'll hear from him
when he's ready.

162
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:08,939
<i>Just show up
Friday morning, Ezra.</i>

163
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:13,043
<i>You can tell that
to the judge, Ezra.</i>

164
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,446
<i>Then you be here, on time.</i>

165
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,416
<i>Well, you won't get in no
trouble if you're here on time.</i>

166
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,719
<i>I know all about it.</i>

167
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,255
Well, then you get
your uncle to bring you down.

168
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,359
<i>All right, Ezra.
All right.</i>

169
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,328
<i>Good night, Ezra.</i>

170
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,949
<i>Sheriff.</i>

171
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:56,620
Um, Alma McCain.

172
00:15:56,688 --> 00:16:00,524
From Gatesboro. Remember when
the truck went off the road?

173
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:06,063
Well, um,

174
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,967
you see, Clay and me was
comin' in to a drive-in show,

175
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:13,437
and I said to him, I'd like to go in
to town and see the sheriff personally,

176
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,374
and tell him I'm obliged
the way he didn't arrest Buddy.

177
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,743
And when we get here,
he says to rush.

178
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,745
And I said
I didn't wanna rush.

179
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,046
<i>And then, well,
he lost his temper,</i>

180
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,649
<i>and, uh, well, he just
rolled right off without me.</i>

181
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,619
I-I mean,
he just "tooked" right off.

182
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,954
Afraid he'll be late
for the show, I guess.

183
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:33,758
That's a damn thing to do.

184
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:38,396
Well, Clay
- He has a terrible, terrible temper, Clay does.

185
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,598
He works with my pa
at the factory.

186
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,633
Pot handles.

187
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,168
That's right,
pot handles.

188
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,876
But, I don't- I don't- I
don't mean to bother you none.

189
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:56,246
It's just that I wanted to
tell you that I appreciate it.

190
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:59,884
<i>I-I mean, I really appreciate
what you done for Buddy.</i>

191
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,588
And that's all
I got to say.

192
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,928
- I'm not gonna take your time.
- Oh, no, it's all right.

193
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:14,565
About time, I mean.
It's all right.

194
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,541
Would you like
a Dr. Pepper?

195
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,645
All right.

196
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,387
You ever seen
a courtroom?

197
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,090
No, sir,
I haven't.

198
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:48,065
It burned down in '28. They
built it up again though.

199
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:52,970
Well, it looks-
looks good as new now, huh?

200
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,341
Never was new,
I don't think.

201
00:17:57,408 --> 00:17:59,276
Oh.

202
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:05,683
There's lots of seats
and, uh-

203
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:11,489
Uh, well, this here
is the judge's bench.

204
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,826
And the American flag.

205
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,196
Oh, I know that.
I mean, I know the flag.

206
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:23,834
Well, I suppose you do
know the flag, all right.

207
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,937
Uh-huh. We used to pledge
allegiance to the flag.

208
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:31,341
Of course, I never pledged allegiance
to the flag quite so big though.

209
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:38,015
Oh, my God. It went
right up through my nose.

210
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:40,784
You all right?
Oh, that burned.

211
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,153
Well, that must be the
pepper in the Dr. Pepper.

212
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:49,159
Must be. Oh.

213
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:51,729
You all right now?
Thank you.

214
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:05,776
Um-

215
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,245
Well, I guess
you're kinda stuck,

216
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:10,247
with your brother
takin' off like that.

217
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:14,585
Tooked off just like that.

218
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,756
Well, he gonna come back?

219
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:22,726
Well, knowin' Clay, he'll
go to the show and then, uh-

220
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,862
then go out and get drunk...

221
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,165
and won't think about nothin' till mornin'
- everybody's sleepin'.

222
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:31,234
It's just like Clay
to do a thing like that.

223
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,789
You wouldn't be going
that way, would you?

224
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:24,888
It don't sound
so good no more.

225
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:26,890
That's the trouble
with them things.

226
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,226
Batteries wear out
before your song's over.

227
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:43,040
You can turn in that
next grove there. Hmm? Oh.

228
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,446
You can stop right here
if you want.

229
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,692
Don't the road
go on in?

230
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,773
It's all right.

231
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,909
Well, listen now.

232
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,844
I didn't have
nothin' in mind.

233
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:27,384
But it's all right.

234
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:19,302
It's me.

235
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:55,105
<i>Had a phone call-
Mr. Bascomb.</i>

236
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,742
<i>He get you? He said he tried
the office, but you was out.</i>

237
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:04,314
I had to see about some
trouble, uh, out on Horse Pike.

238
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,417
Kids,
down from Sutton.

239
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,519
<i>Said he'd get you
in the mornin'.</i>

240
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,574
<i>Who is he?</i>

241
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:33,877
He's a revenue man.

242
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,014
<i>Whiskey?
Mm-hmm.</i>

243
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:41,685
<i>I thought the Dentons were the last
with any kind of still worth goin' after.</i>

244
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:45,422
<i>Why don't they just let 'em
be? They don't hurt nobody.</i>

245
00:23:46,991 --> 00:23:49,492
<i>Maybe some new people
will come in, huh?</i>

246
00:23:54,598 --> 00:24:00,053
So, when you get a little time, why, the
people from Washington would appreciate...

247
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,090
your making a list
of those who got the habit.

248
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:08,028
Or, uh, those
you ever caught.

249
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:13,934
Or, uh, those
who've been suspect.

250
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,269
Many as you can
will be appreciated.

251
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:19,673
People from Polderaine,
Loomis Canyon, Finchberg.

252
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,442
Well, you just go back as
far as you think's necessary.

253
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,813
You want a list now? Oh,
no, no, no, not this minute.

254
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:29,849
I'll wander back in
in a few days or so.

255
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:32,652
I'll give every one of them to
you out of my head right now.

256
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,088
Elsie, put 'em down while I
call 'em off. Mister- Mister, uh-

257
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:37,824
Uh, Hunnicutt.
Hunnicutt.

258
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:40,660
Well, Mr. Hunnicutt, we don't
wanna oversimplify our work...

259
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:43,496
to those up there in the
tower, now do we, huh?

260
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:46,733
You just take your time.

261
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:51,571
Well, many thanks, Sheriff.
We'll get on it for ya.

262
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,542
You know, uh, not much
action around here, huh?

263
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:59,613
Now, your barber told me I'd have
to go all the way over to Sutton...

264
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,849
to find any life
after sunset.

265
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:06,352
Of course, unless I wanna
take in a civic meetin'.

266
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,354
Yeah, that's about it
for Shelton.

267
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:11,257
Regular action here, that's
what you find in these hills.

268
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:13,559
Yeah, I suppose so.

269
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:17,063
People here just try
to survive, that's all.

270
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:20,399
Some make a little moonshine.
Don't really harm nobody.

271
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:24,838
Just pushin' a little extra
sometimes so as they don't end up...

272
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:28,041
with their chins in their hands
for the rest of their lives.

273
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:36,549
Well.

274
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,446
On this side of the law

275
00:26:07,514 --> 00:26:09,783
On that side of the law

276
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,985
Who is right
Who is wrong

277
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:15,155
Who is for
and who's against the law

278
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:19,859
Well, you see I didn't
really mean you any harm

279
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:23,797
But I simply couldn't make it
on the farm

280
00:26:23,864 --> 00:26:26,099
When the land
won't give a lot

281
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,401
You gotta do
with what you got

282
00:26:28,468 --> 00:26:32,338
And all I got's
the muscle in my arm

283
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:36,743
Well, I wouldn't ever hurt
my fellow man

284
00:26:36,811 --> 00:26:40,680
And, mister, it seems to me
you'd understand

285
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:42,716
I'm just tryin'
to help myself

286
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:45,218
Without hurtin'
anybody else

287
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:49,055
And a man has got to do
the best he can

288
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:51,390
On this side of the law

289
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,727
On that side of the law

290
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:56,395
Who is weak
Who is wrong

291
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:59,565
Who is for
and who's against the law

292
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:16,515
Oh, I didn't really mean
to let my family down

293
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:20,486
And I'm not givin' you
the runaround

294
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:24,858
I had rather be dead than to
have to bake my daily bread

295
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:28,928
And I pay my way
no matter where I'm bound

296
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:32,932
Well, I didn't really think
that I did wrong

297
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,803
Just as long as I stayed here
where I belonged

298
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:41,474
I did the only thing I could
same as anybody would

299
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:45,211
Yes, I was simply trying
to get along

300
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,546
On this side of the law

301
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:49,883
On that side of the law

302
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,085
Who is right
Who is wrong

303
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:55,989
Who is for
and who's against the law

304
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:10,469
On this side of the law

305
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:12,806
On that side of the law

306
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:15,308
Who is right
Who is wrong

307
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,477
Who is for
and who's against the law

308
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,585
Roe, come here!

309
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:18,537
They never know nothin'
about my comin' to you.

310
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:29,815
Tell them I want
this stuff outta here.

311
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,051
They wouldn't have stood
for it. I done it on my own.

312
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,487
Tell 'em
to get it out fast.

313
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:41,427
I swear, it had nothin'
to do with it, honest!

314
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:43,429
I'll write to you.
Don't write!

315
00:29:43,497 --> 00:29:46,065
I wanna see you again. I'll
let you know when you can come.

316
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:49,502
Don't you do nothin'
like that. You hear me?

317
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,607
Don't you take
no chance like that.

318
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,920
We gonna be in
trouble, Alma?

319
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:11,424
I don't know, Buddy.

320
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:09,248
Instrumental ]
Here you go.

321
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,621
<i>Rack 'em.</i>

322
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:44,017
<i>Do it again.</i>

323
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:51,384
- Can't you sleep, Pa?
- Old man Linton, they cut his tree.

324
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:54,153
I heard about it.

325
00:32:54,221 --> 00:32:57,723
Tried to hold on to something
ordinary as shade.

326
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,526
It weren't his tree, Pa.

327
00:33:05,332 --> 00:33:08,334
Got a message the other day. I was nappin'.

328
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:11,837
<i>Dog started barkin',
brought me full awake.</i>

329
00:33:11,905 --> 00:33:17,009
Girls will be back. We'll get
your mother, go fishin', all of us.

330
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:21,780
<i>Okay, Pop.
Dog's barkin'.</i>

331
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:27,153
Countryside on fire. I sit
up, there are your sisters.

332
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:29,755
They're comin' back.
I know it.

333
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:36,362
Maybe they will, Pop.

334
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,666
You get to bed real soon,
you hear?

335
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:50,376
Get your paperwork done,
Henry?

336
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:53,613
Yeah.

337
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:13,699
Do your back?

338
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,922
Mornin'.
Hiya.

339
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:42,195
Looks like
I had 'em all.

340
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:44,230
Or just about.

341
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:47,933
Cullen. I figured
about Cullen-

342
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:50,002
two convictions.

343
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,539
'Cept he's 87 years old.

344
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:58,177
Yeah, this damn county
goes back to the dinosaurs.

345
00:34:58,245 --> 00:35:02,114
Everything goes back to the dinosaurs. Mm.

346
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,551
<i>Before I forget, Wylie,</i>

347
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:07,853
<i>you gotta see
that revival tent today.</i>

348
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:12,391
Make sure they don't set too many
chairs in there like they did last time.

349
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:18,097
Standing on the promises
of Christ my King

350
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:23,736
Through eternal ages
let His praises ring

351
00:35:23,803 --> 00:35:29,275
Glory in the highest
I will shout and sing

352
00:35:29,343 --> 00:35:34,513
Standing on the promises
of God

353
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:40,286
Standing, standing

354
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:46,626
Standing on the promises
of Christ our Savior

355
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:53,466
Standing

356
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:58,804
I'm standing on the promises
of God

357
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,318
<i>I'm glad you come.</i>

358
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:47,453
They're all gone.

359
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,988
Won't be back
for a time.

360
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:59,465
I'm glad
you figured it.

361
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:02,267
Oh, I can't figure
nothin' right now.

362
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:07,873
I have to see you. I have
to see you all the time.

363
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:10,242
I gotta see you too. I've
been waiting every day to hear.

364
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,145
I told you I would. Well, I
just couldn't wait no more.

365
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:15,414
Best not to come
direct to you.

366
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:20,986
Ain't that right?
It's all right now.

367
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:35,401
For a minute there
I thought I'd get caught.

368
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,703
Everybody hangin' around.

369
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:44,443
Caught?
Yeah, at your car.

370
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,879
Didn't you find it?

371
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,415
What- What do you mean?

372
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:53,252
Well, my note.
I put it in your car.

373
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:55,254
What are you
talking about?

374
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:57,723
Your car was at the tent. I seen it today.

375
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,658
I was there with Buddy.

376
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:04,830
Weren't you
at the tent?

377
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:08,401
What did it say? I seen
your car over there.

378
00:38:08,468 --> 00:38:10,403
No, no, the letter,
what did it say?

379
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,009
It- It just said
to come tonight.

380
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:20,613
Is that all?

381
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,915
Your name on it?
No.

382
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:24,917
You sure?
Honest.

383
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:27,986
Say where to come?

384
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:32,758
No, I just- I just put
"Come tonight" on it.

385
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:35,528
I mean, I figured
it was your car.

386
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:38,397
- Wasn't that your car?
- No.

387
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,766
Well, it was.
I seen it there.

388
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:47,406
The letter, where'd you leave it
in the car? Where'd you leave it?

389
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:50,142
Exactly, I mean.
Well, I'm not sure.

390
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:53,278
On the dash somewhere.
I was in a rush.

391
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,213
I wanted you
to find it.

392
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:01,921
Whose car was it?

393
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:09,829
- It was one of my deputies.
- Well, he can't do nothin'.

394
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:14,166
He don't know nothin'. I mean,
it could have been anybody.

395
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:16,836
I'm sorry.
I'm awful sorry.

396
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:23,776
Maybe I can still get it.

397
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:26,278
That's right.
Maybe he missed it.

398
00:39:26,346 --> 00:39:28,514
That'd be good,
wouldn't it?

399
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,856
Oh, I ain't gonna
hurt ya.

400
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,994
Why, I ain't never
gonna hurt ya.

401
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:20,032
What's he runnin' for?

402
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:25,437
Alma done
scared him off.

403
00:40:32,478 --> 00:40:34,914
I said,
what's he runnin' for?

404
00:40:39,419 --> 00:40:41,954
Where I put the note
weren't his car.

405
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,420
What's the matter with you?
Can't you settle down?

406
00:42:27,193 --> 00:42:29,828
<i>I said, "You wanna be
shot out of a cannon?"</i>

407
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:34,432
My head, you know,
made one of those quick moves.

408
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,136
'Cause animals, sometimes when they come
out, they get the lights or something.

409
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:40,205
And, uh, I've been attacked
several times on this show.

410
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:43,341
We're gonna take a station
break. We'll be right back.

411
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:46,812
Stupid.

412
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,447
You ate in the dark,
you drip all over.

413
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:55,054
Legs all stuck up
with mayonnaise.

414
00:42:57,924 --> 00:42:59,892
What are you looking
around for?

415
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:04,029
What do you see out there?

416
00:43:07,366 --> 00:43:10,736
Just like you,
starin' in the dark.

417
00:43:12,038 --> 00:43:13,906
Stupid.

418
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,975
Why don't you go to hell?

419
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:19,277
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

420
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:22,114
Weather report says
cloudy days are holding on.

421
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,116
The winds coming up
on the east ridge.

422
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,753
Showers here in the local mountains.
Temperatures holding the same.

423
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,224
And the mud slide on Davis Road has been
cleared and traffic gets through as usual.

424
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:36,728
This is WQQR, Valley Mountain
weather, and here is more music.

425
00:43:53,947 --> 00:43:56,681
Open the door
for the sheriff, Buddy.

426
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:00,252
Go on.

427
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,007
You find the note?

428
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,877
No.

429
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,452
That, uh, federal man,
did he leave town?

430
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:37,622
He'll be back.

431
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:43,295
He went off though.
That's good, isn't it?

432
00:44:43,363 --> 00:44:46,765
He'll be back.

433
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,018
McCain?

434
00:45:06,086 --> 00:45:09,154
I want that whole outfit
sunk in the river.

435
00:45:09,222 --> 00:45:11,290
Everything.
Two days, you hear?

436
00:45:12,993 --> 00:45:15,160
We'll try, Sheriff.
Well, then get started.

437
00:45:19,532 --> 00:45:21,833
And don't you think
I don't mean it.

438
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:24,470
You got nothin' on me.
I'll just deny anything.

439
00:45:25,738 --> 00:45:29,441
I know that, Sheriff.
I never figured we had.

440
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:32,711
We get caught, it's our
own fault, not yours.

441
00:45:32,778 --> 00:45:35,647
I'm just obliged to you
for letting us off like this-

442
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:39,418
I mean, givin' us time,
no matter what reason you got.

443
00:45:42,822 --> 00:45:44,689
Get in the truck.

444
00:45:51,864 --> 00:45:56,735
Tawes, you know what we are.
We don't mean no harm.

445
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:59,204
There's a federal man now.
There's no choice.

446
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:05,477
- He have to know about us?
- Sooner or later he'll know.

447
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:09,415
We'll take our chances.

448
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:12,217
After all, you won't be gettin'
the worse of it, you hear?

449
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,553
You'll keep on gettin'
the best of it.

450
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:17,856
We got arrangements,
you hear?

451
00:47:02,068 --> 00:47:06,871
Oh, when the day was ended

452
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:11,977
I was still not satisfied

453
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:18,183
I knew everything I touched
would wither and would die

454
00:47:20,353 --> 00:47:24,656
And love is all
that would remain

455
00:47:24,724 --> 00:47:27,826
And grow from
all these seeds

456
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:30,829
I kept you waitin'.

457
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:35,967
Flesh and blood needs
flesh and blood I'm sorry.

458
00:47:36,035 --> 00:47:40,205
And you're the one I need

459
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:51,350
It's almost time
for bed, Grampa.

460
00:48:04,897 --> 00:48:06,898
You'd think in a world
where there's death,

461
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:09,601
there'd be no time to hate,
wouldn't you?

462
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:17,142
That's what I used to think
when we got married.

463
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:21,112
When we had
our whirlwind.

464
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:25,350
I used to think things
like that.

465
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:27,286
Guess I read it
somewhere.

466
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:39,964
Swept you clean off your feet
in that whirlwind, didn't I?

467
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:43,702
Before you knew it, you had Ellen
Haney around your neck, didn't ya?

468
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:56,948
Magazine I read said people
never really know each other.

469
00:48:57,016 --> 00:49:00,686
Even married people
it said.

470
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:05,757
And I fully understand that people
are entitled to their privacy.

471
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,695
I mean, people who
care about each other...

472
00:49:09,762 --> 00:49:12,997
can't even pretend to know
everything about each other.

473
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:15,800
Don't you agree?

474
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:17,802
I expect so.

475
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:22,073
I guess only enemies
can pretend that.

476
00:49:23,776 --> 00:49:26,378
Yes, they do.
That's right.

477
00:49:26,446 --> 00:49:30,249
Oh, Henry.
That's such good thinkin'.

478
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:32,651
That's really meaningful.

479
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,821
Only enemies pretend
to know a person fully.

480
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:41,293
You see what kind
of mind you have.

481
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:46,197
I always believed you could run for a much
bigger county office if you had an urge to.

482
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:50,168
And I would certainly stand
behind you if that's what you want.

483
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:54,873
I mean,
anything you want, Henry.

484
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,581
Just 'cause the magazine says
we don't know each other...

485
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:05,584
don't mean we can't help
each other, does it?

486
00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:13,458
Anything you want, Henry.

487
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,460
Just anything.

488
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,713
<i>Sheriff!</i>

489
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,715
You like to scare
the hell out of me.

490
00:51:09,782 --> 00:51:13,685
Them little radios, they
take these? Oh. Harley?

491
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:15,687
<i>That's all right.
I'm in the back.</i>

492
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:19,991
Never mind, Ida. What size batteries
these transistor radios take? Nine?

493
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:21,993
<i>Good afternoon, Sheriff.
They're for the sheriff.</i>

494
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:26,130
<i>Nine.
Uh-huh. Nine.</i>

495
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:28,132
A bag.

496
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,335
How's Ellen Haney?
She's fine.

497
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,839
That's good, what with
all the sickness around.

498
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:36,307
I hear they'll be buryin'
Colonel Anderson soon.

499
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:38,877
Is Colonel Anderson dead? No,

500
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:43,582
but Doc Ellison says
he will be next Tuesday.

501
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:52,657
I'll sweep out
your chimney

502
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:55,360
Yes, and I will bring
you flowers

503
00:51:55,428 --> 00:52:01,266
Yes, and I will do for you
most anything you want me to

504
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:03,902
If we live in a cottage

505
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:06,471
You will feel
like it's a castle

506
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:09,207
By the royal way
you're treated

507
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:13,478
And attention
shown to you

508
00:52:13,546 --> 00:52:18,550
I'll be right beside you
no matter where you travel

509
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:21,185
Yes, and I'll be there
to cheer you

510
00:52:21,253 --> 00:52:23,889
Till the sun comes
shining through

511
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:26,591
And if we're ever parted

512
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:29,327
I will keep the tie
that binds us

513
00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:34,065
And I'll never let it break
'cause I love you

514
00:52:37,269 --> 00:52:40,004
Honey, I will bring
you honey

515
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:42,641
From the bee tree
in the meadow

516
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:45,544
And the first time
there's a rainbow

517
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:48,480
I'll bring you a pot of gold

518
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:50,882
I'll take all your troubles

519
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:53,452
And I'll throw 'em
in the river

520
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,220
And I'll bundle down
beside you

521
00:52:56,288 --> 00:53:01,359
And I'll keep you
from the cold

522
00:53:01,427 --> 00:53:06,731
I'll be right beside you
no matter where you travel

523
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:09,267
Yes, and I'll be there
to cheer you

524
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:12,170
Till the sun comes
shining through

525
00:53:12,237 --> 00:53:14,706
And if we're ever parted

526
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,075
I will keep the tie that binds us Ghosts.

527
00:53:17,142 --> 00:53:19,444
Hmm? And I'll never let
it break 'cause I love you

528
00:53:19,512 --> 00:53:22,380
Ghosts.
Oh.

529
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,586
We used to think there
was ghosts here. Uh-huh.

530
00:53:29,755 --> 00:53:32,256
Hear all kind
of things.

531
00:53:32,324 --> 00:53:34,759
And who was we?
My sisters.

532
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:40,098
What'd you hear?
Oh, sounds.

533
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:47,405
They're all dead now.

534
00:53:47,473 --> 00:53:50,141
Sixteen years.

535
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:53,311
Car got hit on the highway
goin' into Nashville-

536
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:56,515
They and my mother.

537
00:53:56,582 --> 00:53:59,317
My pa, he still
don't believe it.

538
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,831
You go to church,
don't ya?

539
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:18,202
Well, I mean,
being sheriff and all.

540
00:54:24,677 --> 00:54:27,145
I'm sorry
about your people.

541
00:54:32,418 --> 00:54:34,819
You see the lake
over there?

542
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,893
That was our place.

543
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:44,029
You mean they
took it from you?

544
00:54:44,096 --> 00:54:46,297
They took us from it.

545
00:54:48,367 --> 00:54:52,704
Oh. Huh.
I near forgot.

546
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,320
Oh.

547
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:15,794
I gotta put them in now.

548
00:55:18,698 --> 00:55:21,967
Johnny Paul.
The sweet life

549
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:27,973
You can promise me
the moon and all those stars

550
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:33,344
You can tell me that you
want me and you need me

551
00:55:33,412 --> 00:55:37,849
But it don't mean a thing
without you, babe

552
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:42,520
Well, let I you take me out
last Friday evening

553
00:55:42,588 --> 00:55:47,358
And you talked about
the perfume in my hair

554
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:51,963
And just because
I let you hug and kiss me

555
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,499
You think our next date's
gonna be

556
00:55:54,566 --> 00:55:56,501
A swingin' affair
Henry?

557
00:55:56,568 --> 00:56:01,439
Now I must confess you've got
a spark to burnin'

558
00:56:01,507 --> 00:56:05,744
But that spark could start
a fire if it was fanned

559
00:56:56,495 --> 00:56:59,297
Come on now, Henry.

560
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,980
Henry?

561
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:21,452
Henry, I don't wanna play
this game no more.

562
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,355
Oh!

563
00:57:24,423 --> 00:57:27,558
You scared the daylights
out of me.

564
00:57:30,963 --> 00:57:35,033
You- You're really terrible,
you know that?

565
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:41,840
What's the matter?

566
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:46,644
- Go off with me, Alma.
- Hmm?

567
00:57:46,712 --> 00:57:48,512
Go off with me.

568
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:54,318
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

569
00:57:54,386 --> 00:57:56,387
Anywhere you want.

570
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:59,557
- Mmm, Chicago.
- All right.

571
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:07,098
- In an airplane. I've never been in one.
- In an airplane.

572
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,768
Just think of the things I
could bring back from Chicago.

573
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:11,770
Aw, we wouldn't come back.

574
00:58:11,837 --> 00:58:15,807
You know I've never been farther than
Knoxville. Probably never will either.

575
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:20,044
Got an uncle who lives in Waco, Texas,
and he come up for a reunion once.

576
00:58:20,112 --> 00:58:22,313
Said I could come visit him,
but I never heard.

577
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:25,016
Well, we're gonna go
farther than Waco.

578
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,685
We're goin' to California.
Go on into Canada.

579
00:58:27,753 --> 00:58:29,854
California?

580
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,967
You're a good man,
Henry.

581
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:49,307
How about that federal man? He
ever talk about the federal man?

582
00:58:49,374 --> 00:58:51,943
No, never does.
Hey, Buddy, come on.

583
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:55,146
Help me with this stuff. I'm comin'.

584
00:58:55,214 --> 00:58:58,516
What the hell does that
sheriff talk about all day long?

585
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:01,686
Well, mainly
he jokes a lot.

586
00:59:01,753 --> 00:59:03,922
Today-
Today he says-

587
00:59:03,989 --> 00:59:06,557
Pa, today he says we was
goin' to Chicago.

588
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,559
Chicago.
Him and me.

589
00:59:08,627 --> 00:59:13,097
And then he says
maybe even California.

590
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:16,534
Ah, damn. But he's real fine natured.

591
00:59:16,601 --> 00:59:19,737
You know, he has a wife
and a young girl.

592
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:22,173
He even goes to church time to time. Mmm.

593
00:59:22,241 --> 00:59:25,310
Pa says we gonna go to
the gospel tent. Yeah.

594
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,411
We gonna cleanse We gonna cleanse

595
00:59:27,479 --> 00:59:30,481
Our sinful souls
Our sinful souls

596
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:33,584
We're gonna get 'em all. All right!

597
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:35,586
Alma?
Yeah?

598
00:59:35,654 --> 00:59:37,956
I want you to tell
that sheriff somethin'.

599
00:59:38,023 --> 00:59:42,060
You tell him, if he's gonna
take you off to California,

600
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:44,929
he'd better get us
a new cook first.

601
01:00:02,714 --> 01:00:04,648
Hi.
Hi.

602
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:10,554
We gonna get me a hundred
dollars on Tuesday.

603
01:00:10,622 --> 01:00:13,524
A hundred dollars?

604
01:00:13,592 --> 01:00:15,960
I'll get you
some new clothes soon.

605
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:20,064
Hey, I seen a dress in
Sutton. Could I get that?

606
01:00:22,434 --> 01:00:25,336
Hmm.

607
01:00:44,856 --> 01:00:46,891
This oughta make
Mr. Bascomb happy.

608
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:49,461
Where have you been?
In some catfight?

609
01:00:49,528 --> 01:00:53,565
Over at the Crobins' place
yesterday. Just doin' a little pokin'.

610
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:56,601
Huh. He just about
shot me outta there.

611
01:00:56,668 --> 01:00:59,670
Bet you were real polite,
weren't ya?

612
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:04,242
Manners don't
solve crimes, Elsie.

613
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,282
Anything? Oh, just Worley Holden for Wylie.

614
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,385
I forgot to tell ya.
What he want?

615
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:19,924
He said 'bout your discussion as to
whether Kyle Rush is a Hebrew or not.

616
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:23,027
He found out-
He's not.

617
01:01:23,095 --> 01:01:26,231
Well, he don't exactly
look like Christmas.

618
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:28,666
That list for Bascomb.

619
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:34,606
This all of it?
All that's registered.

620
01:01:34,673 --> 01:01:36,941
Shiner's a sneaky fella.

621
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:39,477
They don't all make a habit
out of signing up.

622
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:42,013
Pokin' around on your own can
be dangerous, you know that?

623
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,884
Some of these people not too friendly. I
told you before not to go nosin' round on 'em.

624
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:51,789
Next time
you go out lookin',

625
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:53,958
tell somebody where you're
goin', unless I go with you.

626
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:08,273
Waterfront Patrol or
the San Diego main office?

627
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,276
Look, operator, I don't care.
I have this problem.

628
01:02:11,343 --> 01:02:14,279
<i>Now, look. Get me
the San Diego main office.</i>

629
01:02:23,121 --> 01:02:25,356
Hello?
Your operator.

630
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,527
Operator.

631
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:48,213
Grit my teeth

632
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,849
And face a new day dawning

633
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:55,453
Take a deep breath

634
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,523
Then get up and go

635
01:03:00,226 --> 01:03:03,661
Tie the same old
weary shoes

636
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:06,797
And walk
the same old pathway

637
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:09,300
I never see a face

638
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:13,170
That I don't know

639
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:19,143
Oh, God, if I could
just pack up and go

640
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,615
Hungry for some other face

641
01:03:23,682 --> 01:03:27,418
Hungry for some other place

642
01:03:27,486 --> 01:03:29,554
Needin' somethin'

643
01:03:29,622 --> 01:03:33,391
And I know what
God, I know what

644
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:37,762
I'm tired of seein'
the same old road

645
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:40,732
Tired of carryin'
the same old load

646
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,835
Hungry for somethin'
I ain't got

647
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:50,275
Her face
across that table

648
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:53,978
Every mornin'

649
01:03:54,045 --> 01:03:59,950
And lately I don't notice
that she's there

650
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,822
Always leave
that breakfast table

651
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:07,725
Feelin' so damned empty

652
01:04:07,793 --> 01:04:10,961
She knows there's
somethin' wrong

653
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:14,499
But I don't care

654
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:17,201
Oh, God, how much
more of this

655
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:21,205
Can I bear

656
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:21,932
You'd better be goin'.

657
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,402
I'm gonna stay
with you.

658
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:26,937
But you gotta get home.

659
01:05:56,368 --> 01:05:59,103
Mama, Sheriff's back.

660
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:13,651
Go on to school,
Sybil.

661
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,667
That man, Bascomb, called.

662
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,337
What'd you tell him?

663
01:06:34,506 --> 01:06:36,974
I told him you wasn't here,
that's all.

664
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:39,844
He said he just got in town.
He'll be at the office.

665
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,946
Uh-huh.

666
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:48,118
She a pretty girl?

667
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:54,459
If that's all then,

668
01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:56,694
well, from time to time a-

669
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:59,497
a man your age does seek out
a young girl sometimes,

670
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:01,499
<i>The Reader's Digest
tells how-</i>

671
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:04,802
Oh, that ain't it,
Ellen Haney.

672
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,804
Young though, huh?

673
01:07:14,045 --> 01:07:16,380
That ain't it.

674
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:18,716
Well, then what is it, Henry?

675
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:23,921
Just somethin' different?

676
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:26,256
Somethin' you need that bad,
Sheriff?

677
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:17,542
I told Sybil you're
gonna be all right.

678
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:26,884
I want you to know I've always
tried to be honest with you.

679
01:08:26,952 --> 01:08:31,522
By that I mean I've never just wanted to be
a diplomatic type, if you know what I mean.

680
01:08:35,326 --> 01:08:40,130
I know it's hard for you
to hear me say how I feel.

681
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:42,366
Maybe you never did
feel the same way.

682
01:08:43,936 --> 01:08:46,470
Maybe I don't have much
to give you anymore.

683
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:51,208
But Sybil and me, we do
have full respect for you.

684
01:08:51,276 --> 01:08:53,210
And we want you to know that,

685
01:08:53,278 --> 01:08:56,080
and we don't want you to be
rash about doin' somethin'.

686
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:01,018
<i>Henry, tell me
what to do!</i>

687
01:09:01,086 --> 01:09:03,721
You want us to go
to Aunt Carla's for a while?

688
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,226
Just do what you have to do, Ellen Haney.

689
01:09:09,294 --> 01:09:13,430
- You're goin' off with her, ain't ya?
- I don't know.

690
01:09:16,768 --> 01:09:18,836
Oh, God, Henry!

691
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,247
Well, friends,
it's not there.

692
01:09:30,315 --> 01:09:33,183
And there's no more places
to search but here.

693
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:39,590
Eat molasses on my peas

694
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:42,493
I done it all my life

695
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,996
Doesn't make 'em any better.
Just-

696
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:46,931
Keeps 'em on my knife

697
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,768
Keeps 'em on your knife, huh? Yeah.

698
01:09:50,836 --> 01:09:55,006
Buy a drum like that, you oughta
get free aspirin with it.

699
01:09:55,073 --> 01:09:57,642
Free aspirin, huh?

700
01:09:57,709 --> 01:10:01,646
- Did you give him the list?
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.

701
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:04,615
Let's go to the park.

702
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:07,885
Hey, yeah. That's a good idea. Well,

703
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,987
what we have to do
right now...

704
01:10:10,055 --> 01:10:14,424
is run a fine-tooth comb
right through Jenkins.

705
01:10:14,492 --> 01:10:17,962
How about my taking all the
territory from the highway...

706
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:22,199
in through Sandy Rock
and the reservoir,

707
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:25,136
and your boys can
check out the north hump?

708
01:10:25,203 --> 01:10:28,072
Of course, that's with
your blessin', Sheriff.

709
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,507
Doesn't seem no more choice,
does it? How many men you got?

710
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:32,977
Three, comin' up in the
morning. Then they can take in,

711
01:10:33,045 --> 01:10:34,979
uh, from Cavender.

712
01:10:35,047 --> 01:10:37,048
That's all
through here.

713
01:10:37,115 --> 01:10:41,085
Elsie'll line out some maps
for 'em. And, uh, Wylie,

714
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:45,723
you go on in from Finchberg. Uh, you
know people in Finchberg better than me.

715
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:48,392
Why me in Finchberg?
Because I'll take in...

716
01:10:48,459 --> 01:10:50,394
from the highway
to the reservoir.

717
01:10:50,461 --> 01:10:52,697
That's why.

718
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,135
Well, sounds like
that oughta do it.

719
01:10:59,637 --> 01:11:02,039
Mr. Bascomb?

720
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:09,646
Of course, uh, that list
might not be complete.

721
01:11:09,715 --> 01:11:13,784
Like I was over at Sutton the other
day looking through some records-

722
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,786
findin' old names,

723
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:19,724
old roads
barely on the map.

724
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:23,327
And like I come across
the name McCain-

725
01:11:23,394 --> 01:11:26,263
people up in
Loomis Canyon.

726
01:11:26,331 --> 01:11:28,199
Sure ain't there now though.

727
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:33,537
Shiners?
Ooh. Hell, yeah.

728
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:36,373
They have a record
way back,

729
01:11:36,441 --> 01:11:39,176
maybe two or three
generations.

730
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:42,046
Real slippery. Yeah. Movin' all the time.

731
01:11:42,114 --> 01:11:44,048
Yeah.

732
01:11:44,116 --> 01:11:46,851
You take people
like this McCain.

733
01:11:46,918 --> 01:11:48,886
His daddy taught him.

734
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:52,522
And he'll teach his own,
and they'll teach theirs.

735
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,992
Got himself a lot
of students too.

736
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:59,363
Two sons livin' at home,
and he's got a daughter.

737
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:02,566
And she's got herself
a husband.

738
01:12:02,634 --> 01:12:05,269
Of course, he's in prison
up at Capesville,

739
01:12:05,336 --> 01:12:09,273
so odds are he knows
how to make the juice already.

740
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,309
Anyhow, they're, uh,
livin' somewhere in these hills.

741
01:12:12,377 --> 01:12:16,881
Well, we can't catch 'em all. That's
for sure. Well, now, that's hard to know.

742
01:12:16,948 --> 01:12:19,917
Okeydoke.

743
01:12:19,985 --> 01:12:23,954
Well, I'll swing on down to the
cabins. Uh, get my people set up.

744
01:12:24,022 --> 01:12:26,924
Looks like I'm gonna have
to be around for a while.

745
01:12:26,992 --> 01:12:32,196
Uh, I must say, Sheriff, your
motels leave something to be desired.

746
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:37,802
And what you need is a place
around here with hot sheets.

747
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,874
Bye.

748
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:48,045
<i>Well, Elsie,</i>

749
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:51,515
<i>it's early yet.</i>

750
01:12:51,582 --> 01:12:56,620
<i>Maybe I can get somethin' done
in Finchberg today.</i>

751
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:11,168
You're hurtin' me, Henry. You're
hurtin' me. Why didn't you tell me?

752
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:14,238
How come you didn't tell me? I
don't know what you're talkin' about!

753
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,007
I'm talking about
your husband in Capesville!

754
01:13:19,277 --> 01:13:24,114
How long you married?

755
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:26,717
I don't know.
About a year, I guess.

756
01:13:26,784 --> 01:13:30,620
How come you didn't
tell me? He's in prison.

757
01:13:30,688 --> 01:13:34,158
Pa says don't tell nobody.

758
01:13:34,226 --> 01:13:37,228
It ain't like I lied to ya.
Henry, please!

759
01:13:37,295 --> 01:13:39,263
You love him?

760
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:43,700
Answer me!
You love him?

761
01:13:43,768 --> 01:13:45,635
I hardly knowed him.

762
01:13:55,146 --> 01:13:58,082
How'd you find out?

763
01:13:58,149 --> 01:14:00,084
Well, Hunnicutt,
he knows.

764
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:03,053
About everything?
I don't know how much.

765
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:05,756
He's just playin' with us now.
That's the way he does.

766
01:14:05,823 --> 01:14:07,758
He mighta known
all along.

767
01:14:07,825 --> 01:14:10,494
What ya gonna do?

768
01:14:15,133 --> 01:14:17,501
We're gonna go.

769
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:19,870
Gonna be all right.

770
01:14:19,938 --> 01:14:24,909
What? And you don't have to worry none.

771
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:28,745
Huh. There ain't
nobody gonna hurt you.

772
01:14:28,813 --> 01:14:33,217
Not your pa and not your
husband and not nobody.

773
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:36,086
I don't know
what you mean.

774
01:14:36,154 --> 01:14:38,655
Well, just what
we was talkin' about.

775
01:14:38,723 --> 01:14:40,791
A whole-

776
01:14:40,858 --> 01:14:43,227
whole nother kind of life.

777
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:47,231
Oh. But we was
just talkin' then.

778
01:14:47,299 --> 01:14:51,868
But I figured, you got your
people and I got my people.

779
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:53,938
No, you don't have
to worry about that.

780
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:56,673
I ain't with her no more.

781
01:14:58,576 --> 01:15:00,744
Oh, now,
wait a minute, hon.

782
01:15:00,812 --> 01:15:03,880
I mean, there's no way
my people gonna let me go.

783
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:08,919
I mean, they'd never let me go. There
ain't no way that they can stop us.

784
01:15:08,987 --> 01:15:13,090
Oh, God. Henry,
you got me so scared.

785
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:16,493
Well, listen, now. Don't you wanna
change your mind on me. Now don't-

786
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:18,495
don't hurt me again,
Henry.

787
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:21,165
<i>You don't wanna change your mind.
It's gonna be trouble, Henry.</i>

788
01:15:21,232 --> 01:15:23,633
You ain't changin' your mind. I
just didn't know it was gonna be-

789
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:25,869
Well, it's gonna be. It's gotta be. But-

790
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:29,039
But maybe it can't be. May
- Nothin' to worry about.

791
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:32,209
Maybe it can't be. Don't
you worry. Don't you worry.

792
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,278
Come on.

793
01:15:36,381 --> 01:15:41,185
Now you go on home and pack your
things in a bag and meet me back here.

794
01:15:41,252 --> 01:15:44,088
They'll be home by now. They
won't let me go. They won't let me.

795
01:15:44,155 --> 01:15:47,524
They got nothin' to say. You don't have to
be scared. They'd stop us. We'd get caught.

796
01:15:47,592 --> 01:15:50,961
Well, no. When they go to work? Um.

797
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:54,164
What time they go to work?
Sunup, I guess.

798
01:15:54,232 --> 01:15:56,166
You meet me here
tomorrow mornin',

799
01:15:56,234 --> 01:15:58,802
soon after sunup as you can,
right here on this spot.

800
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:03,407
And we're gonna drive to Sutton,
and draw money from the bank there.

801
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,942
You'll see.
There won't be no trouble.

802
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:11,615
All right, now.
You go on.

803
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:14,684
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

804
01:16:14,752 --> 01:16:18,922
Maybe California!

805
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:22,292
Go on.

806
01:16:34,005 --> 01:16:35,939
Love you, Alma.

807
01:16:38,976 --> 01:16:40,911
Love you.

808
01:16:44,615 --> 01:16:47,051
<i>Here, Roe!</i>

809
01:16:51,456 --> 01:16:54,691
Sheriff's office.
Hunnicutt.

810
01:16:54,759 --> 01:16:56,460
Roe!

811
01:16:58,263 --> 01:16:59,896
<i>Come here, Roe.
Come here, boy.</i>

812
01:16:59,964 --> 01:17:02,899
Roe!

813
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,772
That dog don't seem
too friendly.

814
01:17:11,876 --> 01:17:14,244
You live here?

815
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:24,555
Can I ask your name?
Alma McCain.

816
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:28,292
I just thought
I'd do my job now.

817
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:30,227
Save me another trip.

818
01:17:31,463 --> 01:17:34,498
Just what is it
you wanna do?

819
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,900
Actually,
it's a federal matter-

820
01:17:36,968 --> 01:17:40,070
Internal Revenue.

821
01:17:40,138 --> 01:17:42,506
I'll put it simple-

822
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:45,242
Somebody's making whiskey,
illegal.

823
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:48,845
And we gonna
find out who.

824
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:53,717
So, I'm just... pokin'
around, place to place.

825
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:01,891
Tell you this though-

826
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:04,828
and maybe I'm speakin'
out of turn-

827
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:08,999
but my cousin's
a big official in Knoxville.

828
01:18:09,066 --> 01:18:12,669
He caters to all the
automobiles in the county there.

829
01:18:12,737 --> 01:18:16,440
And he's from,
uh, year to year,

830
01:18:16,508 --> 01:18:18,942
one of the judges
on the Miss Knoxville contest.

831
01:18:23,381 --> 01:18:27,518
And, uh, if you don't mind
a compliment,

832
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:29,453
you're a real pretty girl.

833
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:36,560
Girl winnin' that contest goes
all the way to Atlantic City.

834
01:18:38,729 --> 01:18:40,597
You ever hear
of Atlantic City?

835
01:18:42,433 --> 01:18:44,834
It's in Vermont.
It's a summer place.

836
01:18:51,442 --> 01:18:53,377
No McCain registered to vote.

837
01:18:53,444 --> 01:18:57,214
- No McCain payin' property taxes.
- We come from Loomis Canyon.

838
01:18:57,282 --> 01:18:59,683
No, no, no, no, no.

839
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,685
It's all the same books,
ma'am.

840
01:19:01,752 --> 01:19:04,521
I don't know nothin' about
books. You'd better talk to my pa.

841
01:19:04,589 --> 01:19:07,457
<i>Of course, I'm not
the real sheriff.</i>

842
01:19:07,525 --> 01:19:09,826
Real sheriff's
a man called Tawes.

843
01:19:09,894 --> 01:19:12,128
Fine sheriff.

844
01:19:12,197 --> 01:19:14,298
Fine man.

845
01:19:14,365 --> 01:19:16,833
Righteous man.

846
01:19:19,204 --> 01:19:21,205
Actually, you might say godly.

847
01:19:21,272 --> 01:19:23,707
Well, there ain't
nobody home!

848
01:19:23,774 --> 01:19:26,343
Husband at work?

849
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:29,346
They're all workin' at Kingman.
They make pot handles.

850
01:19:29,414 --> 01:19:33,250
That so? That's so. And
they'll be home real early.

851
01:19:33,318 --> 01:19:35,452
Pot handles, hmm?

852
01:19:36,854 --> 01:19:40,790
Look, you better
come back later.

853
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:42,892
I don't know
what you mean.

854
01:19:50,801 --> 01:19:53,637
Come on, girl.

855
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:55,805
You know damn well
what I mean.

856
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:40,984
Hello?

857
01:20:41,051 --> 01:20:44,488
Oh, yes.
Yes, Pollard.

858
01:20:57,935 --> 01:21:01,605
Let's see what
we can find.

859
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:04,207
Well, it he didn't go to
Finchberg, where would he go?

860
01:21:04,275 --> 01:21:07,844
What would keep him this way? I don't know.

861
01:21:07,912 --> 01:21:12,048
Want me to tow it out, Sheriff?
Nah, I wouldn't move it yet.

862
01:21:12,116 --> 01:21:14,050
The way I see it, your
deputy ain't even been here.

863
01:21:14,118 --> 01:21:19,022
Somebody just drove his car down this way.
Figures to throw you off his track. Huh?

864
01:21:19,089 --> 01:21:21,725
Tawes?

865
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,727
Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Might be.

866
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,729
Anybody have it
in for him?

867
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,465
Well, I know half a dozen
who'd like to get in on him.

868
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:31,435
Yeah. Of course, maybe he caught
on to what we're lookin' for.

869
01:21:31,502 --> 01:21:33,804
Maybe it's a lot closer
than we think.

870
01:21:33,871 --> 01:21:37,073
Parks and Lloyd will be driving
in soon. We can still poke around.

871
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:40,610
Maybe if we all spread out a little,
and I'll check towards Gatesboro.

872
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:52,222
The sheriff!

873
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,878
McCain?

874
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:42,005
The sheriff's here.

875
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:47,477
By himself?
Didn't see nobody else.

876
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,880
He's comin' at me.

877
01:22:49,947 --> 01:22:53,016
Put that down. Goddamn
it! I said put that down!

878
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:56,119
Are you gonna let him take
us? He ain't gonna take nobody.

879
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:58,722
Now, you just keep shut, you
hear? They gonna get us now?

880
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:00,657
Shut up!

881
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:12,235
Goddamn fools.

882
01:23:12,303 --> 01:23:15,439
Well, what do you think we was gonna
do? You think we had any choice?

883
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:18,608
- You didn't have to kill him!
- Yes, we did. We had to kill him.

884
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:24,815
- You can't bury him here.
- Ain't nobody gonna find him here.

885
01:23:24,882 --> 01:23:26,817
Ain't nobody gonna
find him here?

886
01:23:26,884 --> 01:23:30,353
They're working their way down through
the east hill now with dogs! There's a fed!

887
01:23:30,421 --> 01:23:32,355
He makes his livin'
lookin' for your mistakes.

888
01:23:32,423 --> 01:23:37,093
- Where do you figure to bury him?
- I don't know.

889
01:23:37,161 --> 01:23:40,931
I don't know.
I gotta think.

890
01:23:48,806 --> 01:23:51,641
Where's Alma?

891
01:23:51,709 --> 01:23:55,445
- Don't you go tryin' to stop us.
- I ain't stoppin' nothin'.

892
01:23:55,513 --> 01:23:58,348
- Where is she?
- I figured she was with you.

893
01:23:58,415 --> 01:24:01,485
You was gonna meet her at that house,
weren't you? That's where she must be.

894
01:24:05,255 --> 01:24:07,290
She know about this?
Sure, she knows!

895
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:09,693
You think he didn't
try to make her?

896
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,529
You think you wouldn't
of shot him any quicker?

897
01:24:15,666 --> 01:24:19,102
We ain't for killin',
but I don't feel sorry for him.

898
01:24:28,278 --> 01:24:30,213
Yeah.

899
01:24:32,282 --> 01:24:36,185
You get your truck
and all your stuff...

900
01:24:36,253 --> 01:24:38,187
and clear out.

901
01:24:38,255 --> 01:24:40,590
Come on. I'll take care of this. Get out!

902
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:45,228
Leave that.

903
01:24:45,295 --> 01:24:47,230
McCain!

904
01:24:51,201 --> 01:24:55,471
Don't you worry none about her.
I'll take fine care of her.

905
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:52,261
Hey! Sheriff!

906
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:58,602
I spotted your car
back up there.

907
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:03,573
I figured maybe all the sheriffs around
here are mysteriously disappearin',

908
01:26:03,641 --> 01:26:05,809
like in those
science fiction books.

909
01:26:05,876 --> 01:26:10,279
Mushrooms killin' off all
the politicians I read once.

910
01:26:10,347 --> 01:26:14,517
I-I was just
lookin' through in here.

911
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:17,286
I thought I heard sounds
back off the road.

912
01:26:17,354 --> 01:26:21,791
- No soap?
- There's nobody in there.

913
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,397
Found a still.

914
01:26:28,465 --> 01:26:30,834
Down the river-
not too far.

915
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:33,269
You're almost
on top of it yourself.

916
01:26:33,337 --> 01:26:37,573
It's gone now.
Not gone long though.

917
01:26:37,642 --> 01:26:40,276
Hey, you know, who, uh
- who lived there at Gatesboro Road?

918
01:26:40,344 --> 01:26:42,278
No. No, I don't.

919
01:26:42,346 --> 01:26:45,882
Your man, Pollard, says,
uh, old Gimple place.

920
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:48,551
Gimple, well.
That's what he says.

921
01:26:48,619 --> 01:26:52,155
I thought that was empty. They
must've moved in there on their own.

922
01:26:52,222 --> 01:26:55,925
Yeah, that's what
your dep figured.

923
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:58,561
Hey.
Somethin' wrong?

924
01:26:58,629 --> 01:27:02,198
No, I was just wondering'
how far they got by now.

925
01:27:05,169 --> 01:27:08,905
They move in and out like animals,
don't they? You sure can't figure 'em.

926
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:12,642
Well, they're just tryin' keep
warm, Vogel, like you and me.

927
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:16,680
Hey, uh,
one more, huh?

928
01:27:21,418 --> 01:27:23,887
Well, Sheriff, looks like
you got yourself a manhunt.

929
01:27:23,954 --> 01:27:28,324
My bet says that if I could find
my whiskey, you could find your man.

930
01:27:51,782 --> 01:27:53,717
Alma!

931
01:27:56,553 --> 01:27:58,487
<i>Alma?</i>

932
01:28:01,092 --> 01:28:03,026
<i>Alma!</i>

933
01:28:05,562 --> 01:28:08,297
<i>Alma, you in here?</i>

934
01:28:26,016 --> 01:28:28,484
Alma!

935
01:29:05,389 --> 01:29:07,523
Alma!

936
01:30:57,634 --> 01:31:00,736
Beside a singin'
mountain stream

937
01:31:00,804 --> 01:31:03,539
Where the willow grew

938
01:31:03,607 --> 01:31:06,142
Where the silver leaf
of maple

939
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:09,578
Sparkled in the mornin' dew

940
01:31:09,646 --> 01:31:12,481
I braided twigs of willow

941
01:31:12,549 --> 01:31:15,151
Made a string
of buckeyed beads

942
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:18,454
But flesh and blood needs
flesh and blood

943
01:31:18,522 --> 01:31:21,291
And you're the one I need

944
01:31:21,358 --> 01:31:25,061
Flesh and blood
needs flesh and blood

945
01:31:25,129 --> 01:31:28,497
And you're the one I need

946
01:31:28,565 --> 01:31:31,767
I leaned against
the bark of birch

947
01:31:31,835 --> 01:31:34,703
And I breathed
the honey dew

948
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:37,473
I saw a northbound
flock of geese

949
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:41,077
Against the sky of baby blue

950
01:31:41,145 --> 01:31:43,779
Beside the lily pads

951
01:31:43,847 --> 01:31:46,849
I carved a whistle
from a reed

952
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:50,019
Mother Nature's quite a lady

953
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:53,456
But you're the one I need

954
01:31:53,523 --> 01:31:56,159
Flesh and blood
needs flesh and blood

955
01:31:56,226 --> 01:31:58,294
And you're the one I need

956
01:32:11,575 --> 01:32:15,178
A cardinal sang
just for me

957
01:32:15,245 --> 01:32:17,180
And I thanked him
for the song

958
01:32:17,247 --> 01:32:20,350
Then the sun went
slowly down the west

959
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:23,319
And I had to move along

960
01:32:23,387 --> 01:32:25,989
These were some
of the things

961
01:32:26,056 --> 01:32:29,459
On which my mind
and spirit feed

962
01:32:29,526 --> 01:32:32,295
But flesh and blood
needs flesh and blood

963
01:32:32,363 --> 01:32:35,831
And you're the one I need

964
01:32:35,899 --> 01:32:38,401
Flesh and blood
needs flesh and blood

965
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:42,571
And you're the one I need

966
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:46,509
So when the day was ended

967
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:50,613
I was still not satisfied

968
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,749
I knew everything I touched

969
01:32:53,817 --> 01:32:57,987
Would wither and would die

970
01:32:58,055 --> 01:33:02,858
And love is all
that will remain

971
01:33:02,926 --> 01:33:05,561
And grow from all these seed

972
01:33:05,629 --> 01:33:09,298
Mother Nature's quite a lady

973
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:12,168
And you're the one I need

974
01:33:12,236 --> 01:33:15,471
Yes, flesh and blood
needs flesh and blood

975
01:33:15,539 --> 01:33:19,942
And you're the one I need

976
01:33:49,339 --> 01:33:51,274
Let her be.

977
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:54,043
It's all over, Sheriff.
The arrangement's done now.

978
01:33:55,812 --> 01:33:58,047
Alma.

979
01:34:00,617 --> 01:34:02,918
It's all right now.
We can do what we like now.

980
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:09,092
- Alma!
- Don't you see it's over, Sheriff?

981
01:34:09,159 --> 01:34:10,826
<i>Henry!</i>

982
01:34:12,796 --> 01:34:15,598
You're comin' with me.
No. I can't come with you.

983
01:34:24,908 --> 01:34:26,942
Buddy!

984
01:34:28,812 --> 01:34:31,280
<i>- Tawes!
Henry!</i>

985
01:35:28,205 --> 01:35:33,075
I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine

986
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:37,913
I keep my eyes wide open
all the time

987
01:35:37,981 --> 01:35:42,885
I keep the ends out
for the tie that binds

988
01:35:42,952 --> 01:35:45,221
Because you're mine

989
01:35:45,289 --> 01:35:48,023
I walk the line

990
01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:03,939
I keep a close watch
on this heart of mine

991
01:36:04,007 --> 01:36:08,844
I keep my eyes wide open
all the time

992
01:36:08,912 --> 01:36:13,716
I keep the ends out
for the tie that binds

993
01:36:13,783 --> 01:36:16,185
Because you're mine

994
01:36:16,253 --> 01:36:18,654
I walk the line
