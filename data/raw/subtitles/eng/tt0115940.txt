00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,915
TALES OF THE FOUR SEASONS

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,374
A SUMMER'S TALE

3
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,582
MONDAY, JULY 17

4
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,874
TUESDAY, JULY 18

5
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,457
MOONLIGHT PANCAKE HOUSE

6
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,290
Margot?

7
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,374
Yes? So what'll it be?

8
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,582
Cocoa with whipped cream.

9
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,332
Dash of ginger?

10
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,665
No, thanks.

11
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,082
Right with you!

12
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,707
Finished?

13
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,999
Coffee?

14
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,124
The check?

15
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,790
WEDNESDAY, JULY 19

16
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,249
Hi!

17
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,290
Hi... Have we met?

18
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,457
You don't recognize me?

19
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,249
- We met in Rennes?
- No, last night, in the restaurant.

20
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:36,999
The waitress? I didn't recognize you
with your hair wet.

21
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,207
Yes, I forget how it changes me.

22
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,665
Well, I'm going in.

23
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,124
Was it nice?

24
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,374
The water? Chilly.

25
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,082
I like it.

26
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,457
Borderline.

27
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,082
This your first time here?

28
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,790
In Dinard, yes.
I'm from nearby: Rennes.

29
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,540
I'm from Saint Brieuc.

30
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,040
Waiting for someone?

31
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,915
Not now. Not exactly.

32
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,582
Sit down.

33
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,040
My stuff's over there.

34
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,915
Go get it.

35
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,540
You alone here?

36
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,874
For the moment.

37
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,415
On vacation?

38
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,790
Yeah.

39
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,707
I mean, you're not here to work?
I work, as you know.

40
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,624
I'm just an ordinary vacationer.

41
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,582
But I'll be working as of August 15.

42
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,957
Where? Here?

43
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,582
No, with a design firm in Nantes.

44
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,165
I just got my Master's in math.

45
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,915
I got my Ph.D. In ethnology.

46
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,374
Ethnology?

47
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,249
You sound surprised.
Did you think I was a career waitress?

48
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,165
Not really.

49
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,540
Lots of students take summerjobs.

50
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,832
Have you?

51
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,915
No, I'm lucky to have math,
makes it easy to tutor

52
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,749
or find high-level temp jobs.

53
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,207
You'll be an engineer?

54
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,249
No.

55
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,999
Computers?

56
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,207
No, I'd rather teach.

57
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,832
I'll earn less,
but I'll have lots of free time.

58
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,457
That's nice.

59
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,374
Maybe. I don't want to plan my life
around money.

60
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,665
If I had, I'd have ruined mine.

61
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:39,290
What'll your doctorate get you?

62
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,749
Nothing. Not even the right
to do research.

63
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:48,207
I have a plan,
but I can't talk about it yet...

64
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,874
After high school,
I needed a change.

65
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,707
I went to Vietnam and Malaysia.

66
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,874
I fell in love with a guy
who had a job back here.

67
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,457
We nearly got married.

68
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,499
That killed my wanderlust.

69
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,832
I realized I had a lot more to say

70
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,582
about Brittany
than about Indonesia.

71
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,790
So I did my thesis
on the people here.

72
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,249
Mainly the descendants
of the old Newfoundlanders.

73
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,415
We know lots on the Celtic Bretons,
less on the Gauls.

74
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,082
I was so fascinated

75
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,082
that when my guy and I broke up,
I just stayed on.

76
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,790
The weird part of it is

77
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,582
that I later met a guy
who's really a world away:

78
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,582
He's in the Peace Corps
in the South Pacific.

79
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,790
I could have gone out there, too.

80
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:50,582
But no, I'm waiting faithfully,
like a sailor's wife.

81
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:57,040
I earn some money working
in my aunt's restaurant.

82
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,999
So I'm pretty free.

83
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:04,665
Tomorrow I go see
an ex-Newfoundlander

84
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,457
and who lives now on the Rance river.
Want to come?

85
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,207
You got a car?

86
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,790
I do.

87
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,332
The guy's only 12 miles from here.

88
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,582
OK.

89
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,290
THURSDAY, JULY 20

90
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,624
Folklore doesn't interest me much.

91
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:37,374
I'm better at composing than playing.

92
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,707
But nothing's ever really new.

93
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,665
American rock grew out
of blues and country,

94
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,374
which both have roots
in old Irish ballads.

95
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:55,207
Brittany has a rich tradition.
Do you know it?

96
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,374
Not well. I can't say I like it.

97
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,499
Bagpipes always sound
the same: Boring.

98
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,749
No, there are lovely things,

99
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,790
like Celtic troubadour airs.

100
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,207
I don't know them.

101
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,707
- And the chanties in the restaurant.
- You noticed?

102
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,082
I always notice music.

103
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,957
Did you pick them?

104
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,749
Yes, I bought the tape
for my ethnology work.

105
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,040
Did it inspire you?

106
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,582
There's a current
of Celtic rock

107
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,499
and another of sailors' rock,
I prefer the latter.

108
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,707
I want to write a song
like "Valparaiso".

109
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,207
You know it?

110
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,290
Lots of people sang on board,

111
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,290
but it was mostly for fun,

112
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,040
they weren't work songs.

113
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,957
Not like the long-haul traders,

114
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,415
the old sailing ships.

115
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,249
There the chanties
were timed to the work:

116
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,540
Raising the anchor
or running up sail...

117
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:48,540
we "hoisted" sail,
only flags were run up.

118
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,832
So it was...

119
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:57,665
it was all lost,
those work chanties are gone.

120
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:02,374
We used to do what we called
working your back,

121
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,415
digging trenches
in the salt in the hold

122
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,832
to salt cod after
it was sliced and cleaned.

123
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,040
They were taken down
into the hold,

124
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,999
laid out and salted one by one.

125
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,624
To make room
for the cod you had to dig

126
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,707
and the songs paced
the shoveling,

127
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,415
set the work rhythm,

128
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,040
a couplet for so many
shovelfuls of salt.

129
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,540
I hear you sing well.

130
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,499
Could you sing us something?

131
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,249
The most common of the chanties

132
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:46,249
was one about ranks,

133
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,499
mocking a captain who limped.

134
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,582
We were always giving nicknames

135
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,249
and making fun of people who had...

136
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,749
peculiarities.

137
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,249
We called the captain "Lug-leg"

138
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,165
because he dragged his leg.

139
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,582
Sailors said "lug" for "drag."

140
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,332
So it was
"Lug-leg, if you keep it up,

141
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,707
you won't have any sailors left.

142
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,040
Lug-leg if you keep it up

143
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,499
Not a seaman will remain.

144
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,290
Do you know Lug-leg,
the Grand Banks fisherman...

145
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,249
The Grand Banks are between

146
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:28,540
France's St. Pierre and Miquelon Islands

147
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,582
and Canada's Atlantic coast.

148
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,790
So, where was I?

149
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,790
Lug-leg, the Grand Banks fisherman,

150
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,374
Who's always chiding his sailormen,

151
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,040
Lug-leg if you keep it up

152
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,290
You won't have any sailors left.

153
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,457
Lug-leg if you keep it up,

154
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,290
Not a seaman will remain.

155
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,999
Come for dinner tonight, I'm buying.

156
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,749
I can't do it all the time,
but now and then.

157
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,207
Thanks, but don't bother about me.

158
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,374
The folks I live with are away,
so I can cook.

159
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,749
Being alone after dark is sad.

160
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,499
Not for long.
I have friends coming in soon.

161
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,915
A good reason to come tonight.

162
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,582
No, I'll make music,
and I'm expecting a call.

163
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,624
OK, see you tomorrow,
if you're free.

164
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,415
If I'm not I'll call you.

165
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,582
How are you, Mom?

166
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,249
No, I was out

167
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,124
walking along the river
with friends.

168
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,415
No mail for me?

169
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,207
FRIDAY, JULY 21

170
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,374
Cute girl.

171
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,665
Which one?

172
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,582
The one you were ogling.

173
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,374
I don't ogle girls.

174
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,665
You should, since you're alone.

175
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,540
Maybe I looked at her,
but it's not what you think.

176
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,499
In fact, I'm expecting someone.

177
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,915
So you told me.

178
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,582
I said "friends," but in fact...

179
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,540
It's a girl?

180
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,499
You guessed it!

181
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,249
Your girlfriend?

182
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,832
Not exactly.

183
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,165
When's she due?

184
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,665
- Around the 20th.
- That's today.

185
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,665
In theory, yes.

186
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,415
She's coming to join you, right?

187
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,499
No, I'm the one who...

188
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,249
It's complex. I'd have
to tell you the full story.

189
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,499
So tell.

190
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,957
It's pretty dull.

191
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,332
It's not.

192
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,665
OK, but I'll simplify it.

193
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,582
We met a few months ago.

194
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,374
She's a bright girl, terrific IQ.

195
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,457
Tried for diplomatic school

196
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,040
but then lost interest.
Hates the atmosphere.

197
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,832
We've a lot in common.

198
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,874
Because of your music?

199
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,582
That's one thing.

200
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,624
She's not in love with me.

201
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:11,957
I feel she...
doesn't take me seriously.

202
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,290
At least for now.

203
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,040
We planned to vacation together,
then she left

204
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,957
with her sister... for Spain.

205
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:27,499
On her way back
she'll visit cousins

206
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,457
who have a place nearby.

207
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:33,624
She said they bore her,
and told me to stop by.

208
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,040
Charming!

209
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:41,582
She even asked me
to take her on a trip

210
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,749
to the Isle of Ouessant.
Neither of us knows it.

211
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:49,915
Me neither. I must go someday.

212
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,207
If she backs out,
think of me. Promise?

213
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,499
Sure...

214
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,249
Do you know when she's coming?

215
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,249
You checked with her cousins?

216
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,999
You'll laugh:
I don't know where they live.

217
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,040
Around here,
that's all she said.

218
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,582
No name or no phone number,

219
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,040
she didn't have it when she left.

220
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:26,040
She was supposed to send it,
but hasn't written at all.

221
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,832
You came anyway?

222
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,832
You think I'm bats, huh?

223
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,915
No, I think it's lovely.

224
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,540
Worse still, I don't much love her.

225
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,499
Not madly.

226
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,499
Her not writing doesn't matter.

227
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,874
At home we never dated,
we ran into each other.

228
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,665
It became a habit.

229
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,915
A habit of coincidence.
Quite a system!

230
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,582
I must be going.

231
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,332
- Coming to dinner?
- Not tonight, I want to make music.

232
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,790
And wait for a phone call.

233
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,082
See you tomorrow, if you're free.

234
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:15,582
It's Saturday, but I'll fit you in.

235
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,040
SATURDAY, JULY 22

236
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,665
Coming with us?

237
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,499
No, I'm off to bed.

238
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,415
Come on, it's Saturday.

239
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,915
We'll go to "The Hut".

240
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,082
What's that?

241
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,165
A disco in St. Lunaire.

242
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,457
OK.

243
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,999
MONDAY, JULY 24

244
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,582
How can you be comfortable
with all those guys?

245
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,165
I'm comfortable with everyone.

246
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,582
It's my training.

247
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,040
As a waitress?

248
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,999
No, dummy, as an ethnologist.

249
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:36,124
I'm curious about people.
No one's totally uninteresting.

250
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:40,040
Not as individuals,
but in groups, yes.

251
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,957
I hate groups.

252
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,582
I don't like to join them.

253
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,207
Anyway, I couldn't if I wanted to.

254
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,790
Got a lot of friends?

255
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,915
A few, good ones.
I see them one at a time.

256
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,374
Guys?

257
00:28:56,875 --> 00:29:00,040
Yes, Lena's the only girl I see now.

258
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,499
No female friends?

259
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,415
You, now.

260
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,332
- This the first time?
- Just about.

261
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,999
Guys and girls can't be friends?

262
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,624
Sure, why not?

263
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:18,207
But mostly I want a girlfriend,
not a buddy.

264
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,165
And if you can't find one?

265
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,165
Without a girlfriend,
I shun friends.

266
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:27,999
So you put up with me
only because of your...

267
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,124
Lena?

268
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,624
Yes, Lena.

269
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,082
I wonder what she's like.
Got a photo?

270
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:39,124
In my bag,
I'll show you later.

271
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,415
The restaurant's over there!

272
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,082
See it?

273
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,040
Cezembre Isle is there...

274
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,665
The Petit Be... the Grand Be...

275
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,832
St. Malo's hidden behind them.

276
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,332
There's St. Servan,
with the Solidor tower.

277
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:13,957
Funny, my folks
had a record of Suzy Solidor.

278
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:19,165
Singing sea chanties.
I guess she took the tower's name.

279
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,624
She must have. It's funny.

280
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,290
Where's the photo?

281
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,165
I know her!

282
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,290
She came and played volleyball.

283
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,790
I don't see you two together.

284
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,749
Who do you see me with? No one?

285
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,957
On the contrary.

286
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:57,457
With the girl the other night, yes.

287
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:00,374
Which girl?

288
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,374
You know.

289
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,957
The brunette in the tan dress?

290
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,790
- You're crazy!
- Why?

291
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,624
She's pretty.

292
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,790
Maybe, but she's not my type.

293
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:18,040
I'm sure you're her type.
She was eyeing you.

294
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,707
She wasn't. You're putting me on.

295
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,582
Her type doesn't go for me.

296
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:25,915
Look who she was with.

297
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:28,999
She sent them all packing.

298
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,749
What's wrong?

299
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,499
It's nice to be in love.

300
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,499
WEDNESDAY, JULY 26

301
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,624
She's a week late.

302
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,874
She has a poor sense of time.

303
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:04,582
And never sends a postcard.
I know the type.

304
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,665
You kidding me?

305
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:11,457
I'm only half waiting for her,
and having fun meanwhile.

306
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,582
I met you, so I'm not wasting my time.

307
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,874
Thanks.

308
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,999
What if you hadn't met me?

309
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,540
I don't know. But I don't like "if's."

310
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,832
Exactly where did she go?

311
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,290
Around Spain, nowhere in particular.

312
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,374
- Driving?
- Yes.

313
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,540
With her sister, you said?

314
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:34,374
And her sister's guy.

315
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,749
That all?

316
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:37,665
In a car.

317
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,374
A car has at least 4 seats.

318
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,915
I don't believe
they took another guy.

319
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:48,582
Anyway, I've imagined the worst,
so why discuss it?

320
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,499
You're philosophical.

321
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,957
And not madly in love.

322
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,832
I told you so.

323
00:32:56,583 --> 00:33:01,540
If she doesn't love me, tough.
A girl I love has to love me.

324
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,332
Since no one loves me,
I don't love anyone.

325
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,040
Want to know what I think?

326
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:17,457
Neither of you loves the other.
Is she even for real?

327
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,415
You saw her photo.

328
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,582
Photos prove nothing.

329
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:27,707
Maybe she's real, but you hardly
know her. She's not why you're here.

330
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,540
If so, you think I'm an idiot?

331
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,040
Well, I am.

332
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,874
You may not see what I mean.

333
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,582
I'm not strong on conquest,

334
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,290
on pushing my luck.

335
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,332
But I like luck to push me.

336
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:47,957
Understand?

337
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,332
For example?

338
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,999
The day she said she'd be here
on the 20th,

339
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,915
I ran into a friend from here

340
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:01,165
who lent me his room
for my vacation.

341
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,874
Such situations excite me.

342
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:07,457
They may or may not
make things happen.

343
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,540
Is that crazy?

344
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:11,915
Certainly not.

345
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,832
I'm really that way, too.

346
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:21,707
My interest in Brittany arose
because the time was right.

347
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,915
For my love affairs, too.

348
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:30,207
Circumstances were against me,
but it all worked out.

349
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,582
I saw I valued my independence.

350
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,665
My guy's an archaeologist.

351
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:41,124
We can't go along on each other's
field trips.

352
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,499
Then you'd always be apart?

353
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,040
Not always. A bit.

354
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,707
That's not so bad.

355
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,707
You love him?

356
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,207
Of course.

357
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,249
But he's still a stranger.

358
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,207
I can't get in too deep yet.

359
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:02,874
When he returns, we'll be here
for quite a while.

360
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,374
Then we'll see.

361
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,582
But your problem's not mine.

362
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,624
THURSDAY, JULY 27

363
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:15,915
Instead of hanging around,
get a girl for the summer.

364
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,874
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

365
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,040
Why not?

366
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,582
It's my fate.

367
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,415
I never achieve anything
I don't believe in.

368
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,124
You believe in Lena?

369
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,124
I wonder.

370
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,540
You think too much.

371
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,582
There are lots of pretty girls here.

372
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,040
But I don't know them.

373
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,582
And I don't talk to strangers.

374
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:50,957
And the one the other night?

375
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,665
Will you say hello if you see her?

376
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,790
Yes, if she looks at me.

377
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,665
Then what?

378
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,665
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

379
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:03,249
That's not true for me.

380
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:08,332
If I don't like the girl
to start with, I mess it up.

381
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,290
I'm the opposite.

382
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,540
I didn't start out liking
my first boyfriend.

383
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,874
It only worked because he tried hard.

384
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,290
It didn't last?

385
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,874
It lasted 3 years.

386
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:37,582
With the other guy,
I made the pitch. That's better.

387
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,790
I like to initiate things.

388
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,415
So do I.

389
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,957
What do you mean?
You just said you didn't.

390
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:48,040
No, I like to initiate.

391
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:49,582
I try hard

392
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,082
when I feel there's
the slightest chance.

393
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:58,999
But I dream of being
an effortless lady-killer.

394
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,874
They work hard at it,
even if it doesn't show.

395
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,957
There's one thing
I refuse to do.

396
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:09,999
What's that?

397
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,749
Join a group.

398
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:15,582
Solene's an independent girl.

399
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:18,582
The girl the other night?
You know her?

400
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,665
We're both from St. Brieuc.

401
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,124
I haven't seen her again.

402
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,040
She's a temp in a bank at home.

403
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,832
She's here on Saturday.

404
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,582
I think she's split up
with her boyfriend.

405
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,332
Wants a guy for the summer?

406
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:38,874
I guess so.

407
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,415
She must have found one by now.

408
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:45,749
She's hard to get,
but that won't bother you.

409
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:50,290
I'm luckier with picky girls.

410
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,582
Lena?

411
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:53,249
Yes, for example.

412
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,290
If you like.

413
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:05,374
- What are you thinking of?
- Nothing.

414
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:09,499
That's not true, I admit.

415
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,207
As you guessed, Lena's a pretext.

416
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,082
I only want a girl for the summer.

417
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:21,124
I'd take the first one
to come along, but no one's come,

418
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:23,415
so I just dream of the prettiest.

419
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,249
Cynicism doesn't become you.

420
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,207
I'm joking.

421
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:30,165
Not entirely.

422
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,582
Meaning what?

423
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,165
You know what I mean.

424
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,582
MONDAY, JULY 28

425
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:43,707
My only problem, with a group,

426
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:47,832
is not how to communicate,
but how to be.

427
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,540
To be or not to be.

428
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,332
That's the question.
Pedantic, maybe, but true.

429
00:38:55,833 --> 00:39:00,082
It's true for everyone.
Groups intimidate individuals.

430
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:05,124
Some people fit in easily
and blossom.

431
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,374
I feel everyone's alive
around me but me.

432
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,915
I don't exist,

433
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,707
I'm transparent, invisible.

434
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,790
I see others, they don't see me.

435
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,207
You're lucky.

436
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,165
I'd like that at times.

437
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:27,499
I'm not like you.

438
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:29,290
I'm not curious.

439
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,415
I'm not an observer.

440
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,790
I'm not anything.

441
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,040
That's not so!

442
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,790
When I'm with
a really crummy guy,

443
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,124
really insignificant,

444
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,582
girls notice him, not me.

445
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,749
And the harder I try,
the worse it is.

446
00:39:57,166 --> 00:40:00,665
Through running yourself down?
It's vanity, no?

447
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:03,957
Listen, I don't think I'm a horror,

448
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:05,582
or stupid.

449
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,374
It's that I'm hard to pigeon-hole.

450
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,749
I seem young...

451
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:17,582
People expect me to be
cute and sweet, then find I'm not.

452
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,832
Like you, they call me a cynic.

453
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,415
Not true!

454
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:25,915
It is.

455
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,832
You're the only girl
who can bear me.

456
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,374
Even Lena...

457
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,290
Stop it!

458
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,999
Or you may become unbearable.

459
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,249
You say you seem young.

460
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:42,749
You do.

461
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,457
So be patient, your day will come.

462
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,124
You think so?

463
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:50,790
Of course.

464
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,415
Some people lose out with age.

465
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,457
Your kind improves.

466
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,249
How do you know?

467
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,832
Intuition, feminine or not.

468
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,707
I've been told that
by a graphologist

469
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,832
who seemed reliable.

470
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,957
He said I'd come into my own at 30

471
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,915
in every way: Emotional,

472
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:20,707
physical, intellectual.
He impressed me.

473
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:23,332
He's right.

474
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:27,790
You'll find love, but not yet.

475
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,582
Maybe that's why girls hold you off.

476
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,582
They want to wait.

477
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:39,582
In my case, guys rushed me

478
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,582
and I rushed to them.

479
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,665
At 18 I longed to be a woman,
to have a baby.

480
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,665
Then I learned to wait.

481
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,082
But for some months
I've felt rushed again.

482
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,165
You want your boyfriend back.

483
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,207
Mainly to see if I love him.

484
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:06,124
I'm sure you'll find a great girl,
better than Lena.

485
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,874
From the way you talk about her...

486
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,790
Meanwhile,
I can't live as ectoplasm.

487
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,040
You mean in a cocoon?

488
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,540
That's no better.

489
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:21,707
If you can't realize yourself
in full, do it halfway.

490
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,540
Maybe you can even stretch it
to three-fourths.

491
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:31,499
You're great: You kid me about
what I kid myself about.

492
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:34,999
Are there topics you avoid?

493
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,499
Lots of them.

494
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,082
Like what?

495
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:41,874
I won't say, not even to you.

496
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,374
I won't even tell them to myself.

497
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,999
And Lena?

498
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,999
She joke about your foibles?

499
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:53,624
Yes, unfortunately.

500
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,707
She knows it annoys you?

501
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,040
Luckily, no.

502
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,332
She does it naively.

503
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,915
She's sensitive,
but she lacks your humor.

504
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,832
Sometimes, to muddle things,

505
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,999
I fake anger over trivialities.

506
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,374
- It works?
- Yes.

507
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,582
Sly devil!

508
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:37,040
Now you can't say you wasted
all your time with me.

509
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:39,124
Silly.

510
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,832
It's purely symbolic,
and it'll stay that way.

511
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,374
That's how I took it.

512
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,582
Then everything's clear.

513
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,082
What are you whistling?
Did you write it?

514
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,707
No.

515
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,790
Well, yes. But it's not ready yet.

516
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,124
SATURDAY, JULY 29

517
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,582
- Have you seen Ronan?
- Who?

518
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:54,874
Ronan, he was with us
the other night.

519
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,374
Tall and dark, has a kayak.

520
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:00,540
No. Your pals aren't out this early.

521
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:01,915
I know.

522
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:05,582
In fact, I'm trying to avoid him.

523
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,332
In that case...

524
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,832
I'm not in the mood for him today.

525
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,915
What are you up to?

526
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,124
- I'm going swimming.
- Alone?

527
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,665
Yes.

528
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,540
Not waiting for anyone?

529
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,957
Maybe Margot, but I doubt it.
Saturdays she's busy.

530
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:29,082
She and I know each other
from Saint Brieuc.

531
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:31,624
Is she your girlfriend?

532
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:35,665
No, I only met her last week,
in the restaurant.

533
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,749
Makes no difference.

534
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:41,165
With us it does. We meet
now and then on the beach.

535
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,249
You alone here?
At your parents' place?

536
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:49,249
Not even. Surprised?

537
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:53,499
I just had a chance
to borrow a friend's room.

538
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,665
It's my first time here,
I know no one.

539
00:45:57,833 --> 00:45:59,290
Except Margot.

540
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:05,707
I don't feel like swimming.
Let's go to St. Malo.

541
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,499
In my car.

542
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,124
What'll we do there?

543
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:14,749
We can swim there.
The tide will be in.

544
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:19,582
My uncle has a boat.
We can go for a ride.

545
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,624
I don't even know him.

546
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,582
You'll be welcome.

547
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:29,832
He and my aunt are easy-going.

548
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,915
I'm always bringing friends.

549
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,332
Cheers!

550
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,790
Your uncle plays?

551
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:33,707
No, his wife, Maiwen.

552
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:35,915
Don't mess with it.

553
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,540
Don't worry, I can play.

554
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,624
Know that?

555
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,749
No.

556
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:09,457
I am a pirate's daughter

557
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:13,832
They call me the buccaneer lass...

558
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,165
It's a sea chanty!

559
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:19,874
- You don't know it?
- No, never heard it.

560
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:24,082
It's pretty.
Keep going, if you can.

561
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,832
Sure I can, I wrote it.

562
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,707
- No!
- I did!

563
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,749
Can you read music?

564
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:32,540
I can make it out.

565
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,415
I sang in a choir.

566
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,915
- That's it.
- Right?

567
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,415
No, wait...

568
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,624
That's it.

569
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,999
Go on like that. Right.

570
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,999
- Four times?
- No, three.

571
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,665
That's it.

572
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,999
- Once more.
- And then...

573
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,749
It goes up...

574
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,165
Keep going up.

575
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,499
Yes, it's a natural.

576
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,082
That's it...

577
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:29,040
Then the end.

578
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,207
Am I in tune? Do I hold it?

579
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,790
One beat?

580
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,540
Can you read all the lyrics?

581
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,832
Yes.

582
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:51,332
Shall we try it?

583
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:52,915
Sure.

584
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:05,999
I am a pirate's daughter,

585
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:10,707
they call me the buccaneer lass.

586
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,999
I love the wind... I love...

587
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:17,415
I love the swell,

588
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:21,415
I slice through the sea
as through a throng,

589
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:25,499
A throng, a throng.

590
00:51:29,916 --> 00:51:33,582
Quickly, quickly my pretty ship,

591
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:37,749
We will give 'em all the slip

592
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:41,582
And sail to San Francisco,

593
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,582
Going by Valpa... No, that's off.

594
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,207
Going by Valparaiso

595
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,040
To the Aleutian Isles,

596
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:57,082
Across the Indian Sea.

597
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:02,999
I want to go to the end of the world

598
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:07,999
To see if the earth is round.

599
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,582
That's terrific!

600
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,540
You really wrote it?

601
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,082
You have a lovely voice.

602
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,749
I like writing songs,
gets me off math.

603
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:31,415
They're mostly blues,

604
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:34,665
but hearing a sailor sing
gave me the idea.

605
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:40,040
The words are tougher.
I usually work with a buddy

606
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,749
who's a poet.

607
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:47,749
If it's not too folksy, take it.
The girl it's for won't like it.

608
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,124
- Margot?
- No, someone else.

609
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:55,249
Your girlfriend?

610
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:57,582
In a way, yes.

611
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:01,540
"In a way"? Then drop her.

612
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:05,457
- I will, if...
- If what?

613
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,624
If she doesn't show up.
She hasn't written.

614
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,582
- Where is she?
- In Spain.

615
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,665
- With a guy?
- Hardly. With her sister.

616
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:21,707
- When's she get back?
- She was due a week ago.

617
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,707
Another reason to drop her.

618
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,540
I have, just about.

619
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,790
You got a guy?

620
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,540
I have two.

621
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:40,832
I dropped the first one last week,
and the other... today.

622
00:53:57,583 --> 00:54:00,415
Can Gaspard
come boating with us today?

623
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:02,832
- Delighted.
- Sure.

624
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,290
Alain.

625
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,915
Maiwen.

626
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:19,832
I am a pirate's daughter,

627
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,999
they call me the buccaneer lass.

628
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:28,374
I love the wind, I love the swell,

629
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,707
I slice through the sea
as through a throng,

630
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:35,957
A throng, a throng...

631
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:40,415
Quickly, quickly my pretty ship,
We will give 'em all the slip

632
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:44,707
And sail to San Francisco,
Going by Valparaiso

633
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:50,040
To the Aleutian Isles,
Across the Indian Sea.

634
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:54,624
I want to go
to the end of the world

635
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:59,249
To see if the earth is round.

636
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:11,832
I'll let no one pass me by.

637
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,915
I'll never, never give way.

638
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:20,540
I always sail in a straight line,

639
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:23,832
As light and white as a swan,

640
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,624
A swan, a swan...

641
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,624
Welcome to the club, my dear Gaspard.

642
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,665
A great sailor is born.

643
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,082
I don't know about that.

644
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:16,582
To our niece, too.

645
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,999
- And our accordionist.
- He's back.

646
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,665
I enjoyed it.

647
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,165
Nice outing on the water.

648
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:29,124
How did you come to write
such a song?

649
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:30,957
And in the rock era!

650
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,582
That's not my usual style.

651
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,124
I do mostly blues.

652
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:40,082
I have a classical guitar,
that I don't usually play.

653
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,874
So I noticed.

654
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:48,749
I handled your 3 flats,
by switching to minor...

655
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:53,540
But don't use naturals
that aren't on my accordion.

656
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,540
How's it tuned? It's a standard...

657
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,165
A standard diatonic scale.

658
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:03,165
Where the notes were missing,
we went "la-la-la"...

659
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:05,040
That made it special...

660
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:08,124
Yes, it matched the local color.

661
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,999
But a pirate's daughter,

662
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:15,957
it's an odd idea, eh? No, really...

663
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:20,082
I admit, when I write other music

664
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,374
I have different aims. I wanted

665
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,832
to write a sea chanty

666
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,332
that didn'tjust revert
to an old tune.

667
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:34,415
I didn't try
to modernize an old tune,

668
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,832
I tried to put myself
in the mind

669
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,915
of a sailor writing a song.

670
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:42,874
But it's not a sailor's song.

671
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,707
No, it's a love song.

672
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:47,915
He wrote it for a girl.

673
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,332
For you, of course.

674
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,582
No, for someone else.

675
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:55,790
But he's sweet
and gave it to me anyway.

676
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,624
I... did write it...

677
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:04,124
OK, relax...

678
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,582
Don't justify it.

679
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,540
I did write it for a girl.

680
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:13,040
It's not worth discussing... at table.

681
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,249
We're off to bed.

682
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,749
You'll be OK?
You know the house, Solene?

683
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,332
No problem.

684
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:28,457
Good night.

685
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:19,582
Listen, my uncle doesn't care,

686
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:22,415
but I have a principle.

687
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,374
You may not think so,
but I have principles.

688
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:32,249
I never sleep with a guy
the first time.

689
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,624
Me, too, I'd rather wait.

690
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,832
Take the daybed, I'll go upstairs.

691
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:56,082
SUNDAY, JULY 30

692
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,957
Margot!

693
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:56,124
You were missed yesterday.

694
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:58,790
I was in St. Malo.

695
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:02,040
We went boating with my uncle.

696
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,582
Why don't you come some day?

697
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:08,290
Thanks, but the restaurant
keeps me too busy.

698
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:12,874
I must be off. Have fun.

699
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,540
You've got a great place!

700
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,832
You kidding? It's not mine.

701
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:32,582
Belongs to a friend.
I sleep in the kitchen.

702
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,082
Anyway, I must be off.

703
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,707
And I warned you...

704
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,749
Never the first time.

705
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:29,665
Absolutely.

706
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:33,832
You tickle me, Gaspard.

707
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:37,874
I love you.

708
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,665
You know, beginning August 5
I'm on vacation.

709
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,957
- You coming here?
- No way.

710
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,207
And you?

711
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:56,165
I go to work on the 15th.

712
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:59,832
I may stay here until then,
or I may not.

713
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,249
Where are you going?

714
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,082
I don't know.

715
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,957
I feel like wandering.

716
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:09,832
- Far?
- Not necessarily.

717
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:14,999
I was born here,
but I don't know Brittany well.

718
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,290
I bet you haven't seen Ouessant.

719
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,707
No.

720
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,582
I'd love to.

721
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,207
Want to go?

722
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,082
I'll take you.

723
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,415
We can stay with friends.
Even if you're broke.

724
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,082
Money's no problem.

725
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,540
Well, then?

726
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,415
Let me think...

727
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,582
About what?

728
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:45,165
Scared of your girlfriend?
She's not here.

729
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,999
She may come back.

730
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,082
Well, make up your mind. Now!

731
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:57,124
I'm no substitute.
It's yes or no now.

732
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,165
Well?

733
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,207
- Hold on.
- No.

734
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:06,457
One... two...

735
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,290
- three.
- Let's say yes.

736
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:11,874
"Let's say yes", hell! Just yes!

737
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:13,624
Just yes, then.

738
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,082
Yes?

739
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,124
I said yes.

740
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:21,582
- You're on?
- Yes-yes-yes!

741
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,790
If you duck out, we're through.

742
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,290
I'm set on that.

743
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:29,499
Another principle?

744
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:31,999
No exceptions to that, either.

745
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:34,124
MONDAY, JULY 31

746
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,165
How's my Romeo?

747
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,415
You were right, she's nice.

748
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:56,415
Just nice?

749
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,790
Among other things.

750
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:01,624
Feel reassured?

751
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,582
About what?

752
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,249
About there being nice girls around.

753
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,207
About your own existence,
as you said.

754
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,999
From that point of view, yes.

755
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:15,582
You look all dreamy.

756
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,040
So what'll we do?

757
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:22,874
Don't want to talk about it?
OK with me.

758
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:25,665
You still want to see me?

759
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,540
Sure thing.
Besides, she's away this week.

760
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:33,457
I see. I'm the substitute.

761
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:38,332
In fact, a substitute for a substitute.
You're organized!

762
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:43,832
Shall we go?

763
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,624
I don't want to discuss it,
but I do anyway.

764
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:55,415
I feel so differently now
that I can't shut up.

765
01:05:55,666 --> 01:05:59,582
Want to shout it from the housetops?

766
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:03,124
No, simply tell it to you.

767
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,290
- You elated?
- Sure.

768
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,124
Triumphant?

769
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,457
That's not the word.

770
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:15,165
You're triumphant,
just look at you!

771
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:20,499
And I saw you as a lovesick puppy.

772
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:23,624
I was wrong about Solene.

773
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,749
She's your type after all?

774
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:29,540
No, but we have a lot in common.

775
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:32,499
More than I have with Lena.

776
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:35,874
So which do you choose?

777
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:39,874
At first I let her lead me on,

778
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:43,249
mainly for revenge on Lena...

779
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:48,124
Or to feel what Lena feels
when she's courted,

780
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,165
to put it mildly...

781
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:55,415
I was sick of feeling
inferior to her.

782
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,749
I wanted to give her something
to scold me for.

783
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,707
But now I value Solene for herself.

784
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,415
So?

785
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:07,707
So I've made a decision.

786
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,624
If Lena's not back by the weekend,

787
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:14,665
I'm off to Ouessant with Solene.

788
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:20,249
- That so?
- She's hot to go.

789
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,874
You're still playing both ends.
It's either or.

790
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,207
Don't say that!

791
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,082
So to you, all girls are the same.

792
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:30,415
I'm saying the opposite.

793
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,290
You disappoint me.

794
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,665
How could you fall
for such a vulgar girl?

795
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,957
She's not vulgar.

796
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,540
And you threw me in her arms.

797
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:47,832
Come off it!
You lack the courage of your convictions.

798
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:52,582
I was right about a substitute.
You sicken me!

799
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:56,415
All guys are blinded by vanity.
No risks for you.

800
01:07:56,583 --> 01:08:00,415
Some nit snares you
and you think you're a great lover.

801
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:03,665
- What am I doing with you?
- Come on, Margot...

802
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:16,540
- You distort what I say.
- I don't! I got the picture.

803
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,499
Leave me be!

804
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,915
Sorry, did I hurt you?

805
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,332
Yes.

806
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,165
You hurt me, too.

807
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:30,540
I'm glad.

808
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:36,040
We gonna part stupidly like this?

809
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:39,332
Yes, stupidly.

810
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,582
Your stupidity saves you.

811
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:45,832
I refuse to take you seriously.

812
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:49,207
Boys are so dumb! They're so dumb!

813
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:53,040
Even the dumbest girls
don't sink that low.

814
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,957
You're right, I'm a jerk.

815
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:59,999
What I said wasn't what I meant.

816
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,999
- Just the opposite, I...
- Shut up!

817
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,874
Don't make things worse.

818
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,582
What I meant to say was

819
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:10,207
I'll never betray Lena
unless she betrays me.

820
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:13,332
You're funny.
Always justifying yourself.

821
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,249
Look, I never asked Solene
to go to Ouessant.

822
01:09:18,666 --> 01:09:20,999
It just came up in conversation.

823
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:23,999
I wouldn't ask 2 girls to go.

824
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:29,332
Two? Three. You forgot me.

825
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,665
That was a joke.

826
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:36,665
Serious with the others,
but a joke with me!

827
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:40,165
Friendship's a gag,
but trifles are serious!

828
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,082
You're committed.

829
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,790
How do you know?

830
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:46,749
I can be replaced at the restaurant.

831
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:48,790
OK, let's go.

832
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:51,874
You'd die if I said yes.

833
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:55,707
No, because I've got myself
into a bind.

834
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,749
I won't get you out of it.

835
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,582
Shall we make peace?

836
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,290
Sorry...

837
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:13,207
My reactions are unpredictable.

838
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,624
Don't judge me by them.

839
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:21,790
You can be as irked
by a friend as by a lover.

840
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:27,624
I had the wrong image of you.
Takes getting used to.

841
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:29,415
I disappoint you?

842
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:32,290
On the contrary.

843
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:36,332
You're not as dumb as you look.

844
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,415
Girls like you.

845
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:40,374
Not the one I want.

846
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,582
You really want her?

847
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,207
You're right, I'm not sure.

848
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,915
I'll wait and see.

849
01:10:48,416 --> 01:10:51,332
- You have to choose.
- I doubt that.

850
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,915
It'd serve you right
if you had to choose.

851
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:59,040
I bet I won't have to.
They'll both dump me.

852
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:02,374
Why this lack of confidence?

853
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,624
You don't believe any of this.

854
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,749
Sometimes I'd like to bite you!

855
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,249
Go ahead.

856
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:11,499
What would your girlfriends say?

857
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,499
That leaves no trace,

858
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:23,790
but it's to be applied sparingly.

859
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,040
TUESDAY, AUGUST 1

860
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,915
Gaspard? It's Margot.

861
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,999
Hi, how are you?

862
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,582
- Did I wake you?
- No.

863
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:40,165
I can't come this afternoon.

864
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:43,165
I must go to St. Malo
with my aunt.

865
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,332
See you tomorrow... OK?

866
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,124
- I'd given you up. When'd you arrive?
- Just now.

867
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:30,124
I tried to call you.

868
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:32,374
Did you get my letter?

869
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,790
Not till I got back.

870
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:37,124
I wondered if you were still here.

871
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,624
You could've left an address.

872
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:43,207
You're right, I didn't.

873
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,624
Anyway, I wasn't here.

874
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:50,915
We found each other without effort.
That's better.

875
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,707
You're tanned and handsome.

876
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:58,415
Just right.

877
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,290
What are you up to now?

878
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:02,874
I was just passing by.

879
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:05,874
- Looking for me, I hope?
- No, I didn't expect you.

880
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:09,082
Well, here I am. Do you mind?

881
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,249
Did you have other plans?

882
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:17,040
Come, my cousins are on the beach.

883
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:03,540
You do pretty well.

884
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,582
I'm glad to see you.

885
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:19,665
Believe it or not,
I've thought a lot about you lately.

886
01:14:20,458 --> 01:14:22,874
You're not easily forgotten.

887
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:27,624
In fact, you're better
at a distance than up close.

888
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:29,332
Then I'll leave.

889
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:31,999
You're vain.
It was a compliment.

890
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:35,915
You hold up at a distance,
like a good painting.

891
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:37,707
I'd gotten it.

892
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,790
Some guys just collapse,

893
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:43,624
like the people I've met lately.

894
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:45,165
What people?

895
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,457
My sister's boyfriend, for one.

896
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,040
He's not really nasty,
but what a pest!

897
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:56,374
The kind who's always arguing.

898
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,124
You say white, he says black.

899
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,957
How can my sister stand him?

900
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,290
When I'm there, I take the heat.

901
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,540
You can give as good as you get.

902
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:09,749
And how!
At first I enjoyed the game.

903
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:13,707
Game, hell!
He has no sense of humor.

904
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:16,874
Two weeks of that is exhausting.

905
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:20,415
I'm amazed I didn't fry my brain.

906
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,999
Two weeks?

907
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:25,499
I left them after two weeks,

908
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:28,415
they went on to Italy.

909
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,457
But you didn't come home?

910
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,040
I needed a change of scenery.

911
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:35,040
So I went to see friends

912
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:37,332
I'd vaguely promised to visit.

913
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,624
Who?

914
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,499
You don't know them.

915
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:45,040
Where?

916
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,040
Above the Riviera.

917
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,707
With your "ex" of 2 years ago?

918
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,707
Not with him, with friends of his.

919
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,832
He's not there this year.

920
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,915
Don't worry, he and I are through.

921
01:16:01,583 --> 01:16:03,165
You could've written.

922
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:05,040
I didn't think I'd stay.

923
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:09,999
And you're so jealous,
always imagining things.

924
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,124
Did you have fun there?

925
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,707
Not much.

926
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:27,374
They were all over me.

927
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:31,790
It's no fun having
three or four guys after you.

928
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,415
Three or four?

929
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:35,665
At least three.

930
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:39,582
The fourth wasn't bad, but...

931
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:44,457
Some days I'd like to be
stupid and ugly.

932
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:49,749
I only meet guys
who want to paw me.

933
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,874
Never anyone I can just talk to.

934
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,582
I think it's a shame

935
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,624
that 9 times in 10,
when a guy talks to a girl

936
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:02,415
he's got another thought in mind.

937
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:04,040
What thought?

938
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,790
An ulterior motive.

939
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:09,540
Don't play dumb, you understood.

940
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,790
Nothing harm in thoughts.

941
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:15,374
Cynicism doesn't suit you.

942
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:17,499
Cynical? Why?

943
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:20,124
Yes, cynical, like the others.

944
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:23,124
Whereas you can usually be talked to.

945
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:25,165
And the others?

946
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,957
I seldom meet a boy
whose conversation is anything

947
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:33,207
but a bid to puff himself up,

948
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,415
to strut like a rooster.

949
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,332
Those 3 down there were unbelievable.

950
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:43,207
You took them down a peg?

951
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:44,749
Of course,

952
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:48,082
but being on the defensive is tiring.

953
01:18:01,416 --> 01:18:03,457
Another thing,

954
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:06,457
not just because of them,

955
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:09,790
I came to hate the South.

956
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,290
I wanted coolness,

957
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:15,457
mist,

958
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,582
wet sand.

959
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:22,249
A sea without tides is dreary.

960
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:31,874
- When do we go to Ouessant?
- Whenever. Tomorrow?

961
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,540
You kidding? I just got here!

962
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:39,749
After Monday it'll be too late.

963
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:43,874
Know what I found down South?

964
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:47,790
There were lots of old books
in my bedroom.

965
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:51,207
Jules Verne, adventure stories...

966
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,124
I found a story set on Ouessant,

967
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,207
told by the nephew of a salvager.

968
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,499
"The Secret of the Seas" in paperback?

969
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,582
- You know it?
- You bet! It was my bedside book.

970
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,749
I know it by heart,
I can describe the characters:

971
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:13,582
Old Mengham, with his derby hat,
Capt. Prigent, the godfather,

972
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,957
Carsen, Le Louarn, Marie Naour...

973
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,124
It's no kid's book,
it won a major prize.

974
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:24,207
Not the book, the author,
Andre Savignon,

975
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,832
for "Daughters of the Rain."

976
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:31,915
It takes place on Ouessant,
but it's too sad for kids.

977
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,082
On the life of the islanders.

978
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,165
I'll lend it to you.

979
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:41,874
Good! We must go there!

980
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:49,957
I'll be gone for months, leaving Margot.

981
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:54,249
Raise the sail, Santiano!

982
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:58,124
I was sad, my spirits were low

983
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:02,665
Leaving the harbor of St Malo.

984
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,665
What's that song?

985
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,082
"Santiano". You don't know it?

986
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,832
Sure I do.

987
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,207
Very timely! In the mist you can see

988
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:14,665
St. Malo. There!

989
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:19,499
You said you'd write me a sea chanty.

990
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:23,290
It's not quite ready.

991
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:29,582
Hurry... finish it before I leave.

992
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:37,124
You work in...

993
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:41,332
business... You're at a business college?

994
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,582
Yes, I'm in business...

995
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:47,624
I worked for a French company
in New York...

996
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:49,415
In plastics...

997
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:54,290
I dabbled in music, but gave that up.

998
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,999
It wasn't really my thing.

999
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:59,540
But you did some nice stuff...

1000
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:03,457
I wasn't a pro,
I couldn't live off it.

1001
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,040
You aren't making it your life?

1002
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,665
Yes, I am.

1003
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:12,165
It can be my life without becoming...

1004
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,707
a commercial product.

1005
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:19,415
You can live off it
and stay outside the system?

1006
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,957
I'm going to bed, I'm tired.

1007
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,707
- Already?
- Yeah, I'm bushed.

1008
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,165
See you tomorrow?

1009
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:32,665
Let's meet at "La Potiniere",
behind the big hotels.

1010
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:35,374
- What time?
- 2 p.m. OK?

1011
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:46,165
- What are you doing, Gaspard?
- Guess I'll go home.

1012
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:48,332
Come with us to "The Hut".

1013
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:51,624
I have to be up early...

1014
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:53,790
- That's too bad...
- Thanks, anyway.

1015
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:56,582
See you soon. 'Night!

1016
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:00,457
So... what's next?

1017
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,582
We go for a drink.

1018
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,582
WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 2

1019
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,124
- I tried to call you.
- I was asleep.

1020
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:52,665
This time I can't make it.

1021
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:54,915
Lena!

1022
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:59,457
See, you were wrong to despair.

1023
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:01,957
What about Solene?

1024
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:03,582
No problem.

1025
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:08,624
Good thing I didn't really
commit to her.

1026
01:23:09,166 --> 01:23:12,332
She's delightful, lovely...

1027
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:14,374
but Lena is one and only.

1028
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:20,540
She's my ideal,

1029
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:24,332
even if she isn't the ideal woman.

1030
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,290
She's my kind of woman.

1031
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:30,415
I feel it so strongly
that I can't explain it.

1032
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:33,082
I've never seen you so elated!

1033
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,749
Meeting Solene made me realize

1034
01:23:35,916 --> 01:23:38,249
how much I cared about Lena.

1035
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:40,332
And it gave me confidence.

1036
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,707
Really?

1037
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:46,332
You're very clever.
I'm so happy for you.

1038
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,165
That's why I'm telling you.

1039
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:50,915
I know it won't upset you as before.

1040
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:52,457
What upset me?

1041
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:56,790
Nothing.
Forget I mentioned it.

1042
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:01,124
I have to go.

1043
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:05,207
To all your loves!

1044
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:54,832
Hi. Is Lena there?

1045
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:02,124
Sorry. I couldn't reach you.

1046
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:04,832
Our plans got changed.

1047
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:07,665
I'm at their mercy,
I don't have a car.

1048
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:09,874
But I'll come tomorrow.

1049
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,957
THURSDAY, AUGUST 3

1050
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:14,582
Sorry about yesterday.

1051
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:17,457
How could I reach you?

1052
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:20,332
You're never home and I'm out a lot.

1053
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:23,665
And my cousins hog the phone.

1054
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:27,874
I told you, I'm not free,

1055
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,832
I have commitments.

1056
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:34,665
Cedric and Thomas make plans:
As their guest, I have to go along.

1057
01:25:35,041 --> 01:25:37,790
Usually, it's fun, too.

1058
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,790
Tomorrow we go to Jersey.

1059
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,707
To meet an English friend
for a golf match.

1060
01:25:42,875 --> 01:25:45,165
- You play golf?
- No.

1061
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,374
Well a bit, and I'd like to learn.

1062
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:51,540
Sunday there's a garden party.

1063
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:53,707
When are you back?

1064
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:57,040
Monday or maybe Tuesday...

1065
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,957
And our trip?

1066
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:03,290
- We'll go later in the week.
- We can't!

1067
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:07,374
Wednesday's too late!
Next Monday I start work.

1068
01:26:07,541 --> 01:26:11,665
I'm due in Nantes Saturday
to get the key to my room.

1069
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,999
And all my stuff is in Rennes.

1070
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:18,540
You've got 3 days, that's enough.

1071
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:23,957
And we won't find a room in August.
We'll go for the day.

1072
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:31,415
I just want to see the island,
not spend the night.

1073
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:33,457
That's not what you said.

1074
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,999
I said nothing.

1075
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:39,290
I hate being rushed.
Get back by Sunday.

1076
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,207
Impossible.

1077
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,540
If you really wanted to...

1078
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:45,957
It's not up to me.

1079
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:48,499
Don't look so dismayed.

1080
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:50,915
3 days is more than enough!

1081
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,957
I told you: I hate rushing things.

1082
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:57,332
For someone who wants to be different,

1083
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,665
you have no spirit of adventure.

1084
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:04,665
I don't like your cautious,
bureaucratic side...

1085
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:08,499
Bureaucratic...
Now I've heard everything!

1086
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:10,707
Ajourney must be prepared.

1087
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:13,540
Are seafarers bureaucratic?

1088
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,332
You're not one.
Just a common tourist.

1089
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,707
I'll live with it.

1090
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:25,999
We could have found a room.
And I have a tent.

1091
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,624
I don't want to spend
the night there!

1092
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,790
You don't want to spend time with me.

1093
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:37,665
You said part of the vacation was for us:
I haven't seen you.

1094
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:44,707
I told you:
I have to spend time with my cousins.

1095
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,290
They say I'm with you a lot.

1096
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:52,999
No. They have their girlfriends
and understand you have a guy.

1097
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:56,915
They can't understand
why the guy is you.

1098
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:03,082
So what?

1099
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:05,707
So nothing.

1100
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,832
I told you what they think.

1101
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:13,999
They can't see what I see in you.

1102
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:16,874
They feel that...

1103
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,207
you don't make the grade.

1104
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,582
And that our trip isn't so innocent.

1105
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,374
What matters, their opinion or yours?

1106
01:28:27,583 --> 01:28:31,624
The point is...
they think I'm your girlfriend.

1107
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:34,915
If so, and I don't want to be mean,

1108
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:38,165
- I don't think you make the grade either.
- So what?

1109
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:41,957
So nothing.

1110
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:46,124
But it puts me in a spot.

1111
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,624
If you cared for me a bit,
you'd understand.

1112
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:53,749
I wish you'd just act like a friend.

1113
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:56,540
You know you're more than that.

1114
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:58,124
Maybe.

1115
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,832
But it's a shame.

1116
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:04,582
It was so nice the other day.
You regret it?

1117
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:07,040
You make me regret it.

1118
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,915
To say the least!

1119
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:23,165
I just want to hold your hand.

1120
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:27,874
- Then the arm or the shoulder.
- I said no! Let go!

1121
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:31,957
Just the hand.
I'm not doing anything.

1122
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,624
Why?

1123
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:37,582
Because!

1124
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:40,124
I don't have to explain.

1125
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:46,082
Why do we have to do what you want,
not what I want?

1126
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,582
I say the same thing to other guys.

1127
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:55,707
I'm so much better than
all the guys who buzz around me.

1128
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,332
Why should I do what they want?

1129
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,832
Why should they impose
their will on me?

1130
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:09,457
I don't want to give anyone anything.

1131
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:12,915
Not the slightest portion
of my freedom!

1132
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:16,915
Or only to the man I'll love...

1133
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:19,957
when I meet him.

1134
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,624
I thought I loved two boys...

1135
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:27,707
It was a mistake.

1136
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:31,332
I won't make a third mistake.

1137
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,249
Just leave me alone!

1138
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:43,415
Leave me alone! Go home!

1139
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:46,457
One more step
and you'll never see me again.

1140
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,999
FRIDAY, AUGUST 4

1141
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,874
You said we'd never meet again:
I'm free as a bird.

1142
01:31:06,041 --> 01:31:07,249
Lena gets back tomorrow.

1143
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:10,832
Maybe only on Monday.

1144
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:14,749
- What about your trip?
- To Ouessant? There's a snag.

1145
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:19,290
We parted on bad terms yesterday.

1146
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:24,540
That's her: One day's all white,
the next all black.

1147
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:29,999
Tuesday was our whitest day,
yesterday our blackest.

1148
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,999
At any rate, it was very gray.

1149
01:31:32,416 --> 01:31:33,457
So you're not going?

1150
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:36,415
Just for the day,
which makes no sense.

1151
01:31:37,750 --> 01:31:40,374
If she doesn't back out.

1152
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:41,707
Go with Solene.

1153
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:43,624
No way!

1154
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,165
Why not, if Lena drops you?

1155
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:47,249
I promised Lena,

1156
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:49,374
and it seems to matter to her.

1157
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:53,915
- You said if she didn't show up...
- But she did.

1158
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:57,707
And it made you mad, rightly so.

1159
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:02,124
Aren't you meeting Solene tomorrow?

1160
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:05,665
- Yes, at 10 a.m.
- Will you go?

1161
01:32:05,875 --> 01:32:08,915
Sure, to explain and verify.

1162
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,832
- To verify what?
- The difference.

1163
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:15,290
It'll make me love Lena again.

1164
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:19,665
- The opposite may happen...
- Then I no longer love Lena.

1165
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:21,082
Which may be true.

1166
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,332
So you'll go with Solene?

1167
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,707
Not to Ouessant.

1168
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:28,457
Even if you drop Lena?

1169
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:33,374
If I go, it'll be with you.

1170
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:37,582
- That's no solace to her.
- Yes it is!

1171
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:42,249
Sure, because I don't count.

1172
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:45,915
Why are you so mad at her?

1173
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:48,374
- 2 days ago you idolized her.
- No reason.

1174
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:53,249
But she's right,
I don't stand a chance with her.

1175
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:55,915
She'd told me before,
now I believe her.

1176
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:58,165
And as a friend?

1177
01:32:58,333 --> 01:33:01,790
I much prefer you.

1178
01:33:04,083 --> 01:33:06,249
Why did she show up so late?

1179
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:08,457
I don't know.
She was with some guys.

1180
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,874
- Lovers?
- Not even.

1181
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:13,832
I hope not.
I don't question her.

1182
01:33:14,666 --> 01:33:16,374
Does she question you?

1183
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:18,874
No. She's too involved with herself.

1184
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:28,332
- You told her about Solene?
- Lena? You crazy?

1185
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,707
So you hide things too.

1186
01:33:30,875 --> 01:33:33,957
I wish I could be frank with her.

1187
01:33:34,166 --> 01:33:36,040
But she overreacts.

1188
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:41,457
I didn't want to spoil
our first idyllic day.

1189
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:44,707
Or make our second one even stormier.

1190
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:47,374
And I hate lying.

1191
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:51,082
Nonsense.
All the more reason to tell her.

1192
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:54,832
If it doesn't come up,
I don't have to lie.

1193
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:59,124
How can I tell her the truth,
if I don't know it myself?

1194
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:03,249
Does Solene appeal to me, or not?

1195
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:07,749
Either way I'd be exaggerating.

1196
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:11,540
Did you tell her about me?

1197
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,457
Of course not.

1198
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,582
Yet you had nothing to hide.

1199
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:19,790
- You know how you feel about me.
- Sure.

1200
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,957
We had other things to discuss.

1201
01:34:24,583 --> 01:34:27,415
More important
than the little waitress!

1202
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:29,790
Don't talk like that

1203
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:34,957
OK.

1204
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:38,665
Mentioning other girls
might intrigue her.

1205
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:43,082
I want her
to become interested in me by herself.

1206
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:47,915
Anyway, that's not the problem.

1207
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:51,165
It's not, does she love me?
It's, do I love her?

1208
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:56,999
Our happiness Tuesday
was too good to be true.

1209
01:34:57,166 --> 01:35:00,082
It wasn't real, I wasn't myself.

1210
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:10,915
You'll like this:

1211
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,165
I'm only myself with you.

1212
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:17,582
I'm not myself with Solene.

1213
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:22,582
It's like a journey,
being in a story.

1214
01:35:23,291 --> 01:35:26,249
Trying to be someone who isn't me.

1215
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:28,332
And with Lena?

1216
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:31,957
I also play a character
I invented for her,

1217
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:34,165
to cope with her scorn.

1218
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,540
I have to.

1219
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,290
She sees me her way,
forcing me out of myself.

1220
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:45,249
You change with me, too.

1221
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:48,207
I can't make up my mind about you.

1222
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:52,582
First I saw you as lovesick,

1223
01:35:53,291 --> 01:35:55,082
then as a clumsy Romeo,

1224
01:35:56,166 --> 01:35:58,957
then as craftier than you seemed,

1225
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,874
then as quite naughty,

1226
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:08,040
then as basically decent,
but still a bit crafty...

1227
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:13,290
Not far off!
So you're not comfortable with me?

1228
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:16,457
Sure I am.

1229
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:19,540
- You're yourself?
- Yes.

1230
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:22,457
That's not surprising.

1231
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:25,707
It's easier with a friend
than a lover:

1232
01:36:25,958 --> 01:36:27,999
You don't have to pretend.

1233
01:36:30,041 --> 01:36:34,124
Maybe Ouessant isn't
a good place for a romantic escapade.

1234
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:36,249
That's what I think.

1235
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:41,999
- Then you come with me.
- That again!

1236
01:36:42,416 --> 01:36:44,040
What about my job?

1237
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:46,332
You said you could get time off.

1238
01:36:46,708 --> 01:36:48,207
Maybe...

1239
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:51,832
But you asked other girls.
They didn't turn you down.

1240
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:55,207
I'm turning them down.
I've picked you.

1241
01:36:55,375 --> 01:36:57,665
I'll give them all up for you.

1242
01:36:58,083 --> 01:37:00,207
Don't drop anything for me!

1243
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:03,915
Actually, I'm not.
They'll both back out.

1244
01:37:06,583 --> 01:37:08,999
You resent being a substitute?

1245
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:12,749
No, I'm above all that.

1246
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:15,665
You see...

1247
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:18,624
I want to go to Ouessant.

1248
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:23,040
I like to take a few days off,
get some fresh air,

1249
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:26,040
get away from the restaurant.

1250
01:37:27,416 --> 01:37:32,165
Spend a few whole days with you,
even if it's risky.

1251
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:37,832
But I'd just be a stopgap.

1252
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:41,582
And I don't want to be.

1253
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:45,124
We'll go later...

1254
01:37:45,875 --> 01:37:47,874
When you've failed.

1255
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:52,665
Winter is the best season.

1256
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:11,957
What's wrong?

1257
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:14,457
You're crying?

1258
01:38:15,291 --> 01:38:17,665
No... laughing.

1259
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:20,707
Why?

1260
01:38:21,958 --> 01:38:24,540
Your predicament makes me laugh.

1261
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:29,749
You're like a bum
who wakes up a millionaire.

1262
01:38:29,916 --> 01:38:33,874
Aren't three girls at a time too many?

1263
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:36,832
SATURDAY, AUGUST 5

1264
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:53,165
I warn you, I don't have a car.

1265
01:38:53,333 --> 01:38:54,999
Mine's on the blink.

1266
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,624
We'll go by train.

1267
01:38:57,791 --> 01:39:00,082
Costs about $40 each.

1268
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,749
We'll split it, OK?

1269
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:06,499
There's a snag about Ouessant.

1270
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:09,582
About Ouessant?

1271
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:12,165
I'd promised to take someone else.

1272
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:14,874
Who?

1273
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:18,374
Your girlfriend?

1274
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:21,999
Why not say so?

1275
01:39:22,958 --> 01:39:26,790
So go with her!
I'll leave, good-bye!

1276
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,082
No, I'm not going with her.
We just about broke up.

1277
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:34,582
- She's back?
- Yes, and things are lousy.

1278
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,874
So? Where's the problem?

1279
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:41,707
- I said I'd take her.
- You said you'd take me.

1280
01:39:41,916 --> 01:39:45,665
But she was first.
I should've told you.

1281
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,749
But aren't you two through?

1282
01:39:50,875 --> 01:39:54,082
That's why I hate
to play dirty with her.

1283
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,165
What's dirty about it?

1284
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:59,124
If you ditch her,
you're free of her.

1285
01:40:02,583 --> 01:40:03,874
Let's go elsewhere?

1286
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:08,207
- Won't change a thing.
- To Guernsey or Sercq.

1287
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:10,124
I know all the islands.

1288
01:40:10,833 --> 01:40:13,207
We said Ouessant. Why change?

1289
01:40:13,916 --> 01:40:15,249
There's no point.

1290
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:20,957
Unless you're hoping
to patch things up with her.

1291
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:24,790
Then don't count on me.

1292
01:40:25,708 --> 01:40:27,915
I'm very exacting

1293
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,999
about some things.

1294
01:40:31,583 --> 01:40:34,749
I commit all the way
and expect the same.

1295
01:40:34,916 --> 01:40:36,957
I hate double-dealers.

1296
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:43,915
Men are so low,
they don't take risks.

1297
01:40:44,166 --> 01:40:46,999
They never ditch a girl
until they've snared another.

1298
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,582
You told me you had two guys.

1299
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:54,874
I said I was dumping two.
That's not the same thing.

1300
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,999
One was my real boyfriend,

1301
01:40:58,666 --> 01:41:00,165
the other...

1302
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,957
was a possible replacement...

1303
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:06,790
You see...

1304
01:41:07,791 --> 01:41:10,332
I wasn't afraid of dumping both.

1305
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:15,665
Now I have no one... But you...

1306
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:18,165
- I have no one either.
- Liar!

1307
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:21,665
She's here.
Is she staying with you?

1308
01:41:21,833 --> 01:41:24,374
I told you there's nothing between us.

1309
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,665
She's staying with her cousins.

1310
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,124
Is she a slender girl
with straight blonde hair?

1311
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:34,624
Are her cousins called Cedric and...

1312
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:35,957
Thomas.

1313
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:42,290
You like that girl?

1314
01:41:42,625 --> 01:41:44,082
Surprised?

1315
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,040
Nothing surprises me.

1316
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,582
So go with her.

1317
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:58,207
I don't want to, even if she does.

1318
01:41:58,375 --> 01:42:02,707
It's a matter of principle.
Like you, I also have principles.

1319
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:04,832
Weird principles!

1320
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:10,165
I could go to Ouessant
with a male or female friend.

1321
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:14,832
But with not you.
I'd rather go elsewhere.

1322
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:16,874
I don't see the difference.

1323
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:21,124
I also asked another girl to go...

1324
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:24,790
Margot... she's just a friend.

1325
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:28,124
You don't waste any time!

1326
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:30,540
Now I'm in third place!

1327
01:42:31,458 --> 01:42:33,332
I thought you were naive.

1328
01:42:34,041 --> 01:42:35,582
So say I'm cynical!

1329
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:38,707
Cynical? Not you!

1330
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:41,374
No one could say you were that.

1331
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,332
But you have a twisted mind.

1332
01:42:46,666 --> 01:42:49,040
If you took Margot,
I'd understand.

1333
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:52,207
Friendship's serious.

1334
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:55,499
Maybe more than love.

1335
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,915
Enough said.

1336
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:07,874
Answer me: Are we going or not?

1337
01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:10,457
You won't go elsewhere?

1338
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:13,665
You're so stubborn!
Want to go or not?

1339
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,915
- To Ouessant?
- Yes, since you insist.

1340
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:18,374
No regrets?

1341
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:21,499
I may seem indecisive, but I'm not.

1342
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:25,457
My problem has been solved.
So let's go.

1343
01:43:26,458 --> 01:43:28,582
- Tomorrow morning?
- No.

1344
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:32,707
I've got things to do here
and in St. Malo.

1345
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:36,957
- Let's say Monday.
- Not later. I can only stay till Friday.

1346
01:43:37,125 --> 01:43:38,624
That'll be fine.

1347
01:43:39,125 --> 01:43:41,082
We'll catch the train at Lamballe,

1348
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:44,540
Tuesday we board the ferry
even if it's stormy.

1349
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:47,290
We're both good sailors.

1350
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:50,124
I'm a pirate's daughter

1351
01:43:50,291 --> 01:43:53,290
They call me the buccaneer lass

1352
01:43:53,708 --> 01:43:55,165
I'm a girl

1353
01:43:55,333 --> 01:43:57,415
from Ouessant...

1354
01:43:57,583 --> 01:44:00,082
People stop and stare at me.

1355
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:04,582
I have to go.

1356
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:08,332
I promised some people I'd stop by.

1357
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:11,582
I'm going to a party tonight,
but I can't take you.

1358
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:16,124
I'll sleep till noon, so I'll phone you...

1359
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:19,165
at 2.30 PM sharp.

1360
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,832
- If you're at home.
- I'll be there.

1361
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,415
SUNDAY, AUGUST 6

1362
01:44:54,416 --> 01:44:55,749
You're there?

1363
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:57,540
Of course.

1364
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,207
- Is this Lena?
- Who else could it be?

1365
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:04,832
Aren't you in Jersey?

1366
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,290
Yes, but I'm catching
the boat in an hour.

1367
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:12,165
You're right,
let's go to Ouessant tomorrow.

1368
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,624
You said you didn't want to go.

1369
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:21,290
What? I want to more than ever!

1370
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:27,082
- Can you hear me?
- Yes... So?

1371
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:31,749
Hope I'm forgiven for the other day.
I was in a foul mood.

1372
01:45:31,916 --> 01:45:34,707
I swear it, now I'll be an angel.

1373
01:45:36,666 --> 01:45:38,707
- You don't believe me?
- Yes I do.

1374
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:42,332
I want to see you.
Let's have dinner.

1375
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,874
I'm all out of coins.

1376
01:45:45,708 --> 01:45:48,915
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, but...

1377
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:52,124
See you at "La Potiniere" at 8.30.

1378
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:15,624
- Yes, it's me.
- I'm me, too.

1379
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:21,374
I just called, your line was busy.

1380
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:24,165
Your visits go OK?

1381
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:26,040
Yes, but they're not over.

1382
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:30,124
Tonight I have to go to a party.
Come with me.

1383
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:33,540
- In Dinard?
- No, St Malo.

1384
01:46:34,333 --> 01:46:36,165
We can sleep at my uncle's.

1385
01:46:36,666 --> 01:46:40,499
Take your things.
Meet you there at 8 PM.

1386
01:46:41,041 --> 01:46:42,290
I'm coming!

1387
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:44,915
I have to run... Big hug!

1388
01:47:40,166 --> 01:47:42,374
Hi. Is Margot there?

1389
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:44,582
She's in the kitchen.

1390
01:47:44,875 --> 01:47:46,582
Don't disturb her.

1391
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:49,624
Ask her to call Gaspard
as soon as she can.

1392
01:47:49,791 --> 01:47:52,499
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1393
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,999
Hi, Gaspard. It's Thierry.

1394
01:48:09,166 --> 01:48:11,540
I've finally got something for you.

1395
01:48:11,666 --> 01:48:15,582
That 8-track tape-recorder
I told you about.

1396
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:18,165
The guy's willing to sell.
It's a steal.

1397
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:21,790
$600 now, and the rest in 6 months.

1398
01:48:21,958 --> 01:48:23,749
That's great!

1399
01:48:23,916 --> 01:48:26,999
My savings,
plus next month's pay, I can do it.

1400
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:28,790
I can just make it.

1401
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:31,582
But we have to move fast.

1402
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:34,457
Be in La Rochelle tomorrow morning.

1403
01:48:34,833 --> 01:48:36,332
Tomorrow morning?

1404
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,082
OK, I'll be there.

1405
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:48,707
In fact it's great timing.

1406
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:51,707
I'll leave now.

1407
01:48:51,875 --> 01:48:53,165
Thanks.

1408
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,874
Hi, Gaspard.
It's Margot. What's wrong?

1409
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:11,624
Now or then? Big difference!

1410
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:14,457
Now I'm happy, then I was sad.

1411
01:49:14,791 --> 01:49:19,249
Suddenly, my whole life changed.
I'll explain.

1412
01:49:19,416 --> 01:49:22,415
I'm on the 5 o'clock boat.
Meet me at the pier?

1413
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:28,082
I gave in to Solene

1414
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:32,165
because I felt Lena
would ditch me in the end.

1415
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:37,999
But she came back just for me.
I was ashamed.

1416
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:41,665
Serves you right.
You had two irons in the fire.

1417
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:42,915
Three!

1418
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:45,374
Now I count too?

1419
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,957
Deciding on the phone is tough.

1420
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,582
Leaving without a word?

1421
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,082
- I'll write them.
- To say what?

1422
01:49:55,583 --> 01:49:56,999
The truth:

1423
01:49:57,166 --> 01:50:00,582
I found an 8-track recorder.
My music comes first.

1424
01:50:01,083 --> 01:50:03,249
They're nice girls,
they'll understand.

1425
01:50:04,583 --> 01:50:07,457
Without the music,
what'd you have done?

1426
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:09,874
I have no idea.

1427
01:50:10,791 --> 01:50:14,332
I've never been in a spot like that.

1428
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,874
Things always worked themselves out.

1429
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:20,707
They have again.

1430
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:28,040
Now you and I can go
to Ouessant whenever you want.

1431
01:50:29,166 --> 01:50:31,874
That's no longer possible.

1432
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,999
My boyfriend wrote:
He'll be back in September.

1433
01:50:36,958 --> 01:50:38,249
So I'll go with him.

1434
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:43,957
He wanted to go there too.
I'm so sorry.

1435
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:48,915
I told you:
Nothing ever happens to me.

1436
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:51,874
Not even an innocent
outing with a girl.

1437
01:50:53,291 --> 01:50:54,624
It's my fate.

1438
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:57,290
You had it coming to you.

1439
01:50:57,833 --> 01:50:59,165
No.

1440
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:02,957
Yes. Think about it.

1441
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:07,082
Time to go.

1442
01:51:27,416 --> 01:51:31,832
I'm in Rennes now and then.
We can meet.

1443
01:51:33,625 --> 01:51:35,874
Best of luck!

1444
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:40,374
I won't forget our walks.

1445
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,665
Me neither.

1446
01:52:26,416 --> 01:52:30,540
I'll be gone for months, leaving Margot.

1447
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:35,249
Raise the sail, Santiano!

1448
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:39,957
I was sad, my spirits were low

1449
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:44,165
Leaving the harbor of St Malo.

1450
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:48,499
I was sad, my spirits were low,

1451
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:52,749
Leaving the harbor of St Malo.
