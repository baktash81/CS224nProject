[announcer] <i>Welcome to
the World Extreme Games.</i>

3
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,502
[crowd cheering]

4
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:03,173
<i>Up next,
we have Tommy Schooner,</i>

5
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:06,944
<i>attempting his calling card,
the "Schoonerama."</i>

6
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:11,249
<i>This is an incredibly
difficult trick.</i>

7
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,088
<i>Tommy is the only one
to successfully pull off</i>

8
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,092
<i>this daring maneuver
in competition.</i>

9
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:30,334
<i>He's beginning his approach,
gathering speed.</i>

10
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:32,872
[cheering continues]

11
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,274
<i>There's no turning back now!</i>

12
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,987
<i>Oh! And Tommy Schooner
is down!</i>

13
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:51,558
Trash can: 30, Tommy: 0.

14
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,327
You okay?

15
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,997
Yeah.

16
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,198
Ugh. I really thought
you had it that time.

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,567
I didn't.

18
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,337
You think you have
one more in you?

19
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:07,272
[scoffs] I think we've done
enough damage for one day.

20
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,740
[chuckles]
You're probably right.

21
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:10,410
I have to go home
for dinner soon anyway.

22
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:13,245
Ooh! Watcha having? Steak?
I could really go for a steak.

23
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:14,448
You wanna take
the footage home?

24
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,617
Add it to the collection?

25
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,217
Uh, we get anything good?

26
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,686
Yeah, we got
some cool stuff of...

27
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,154
Buddy. [chuckles]

28
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,356
As usual.

29
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,057
And plenty of you falling.

30
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,758
As usual.

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,194
Thanks, I'll be sure
to use those.

32
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:27,927
See you tomorrow?

33
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,330
Yeah, first day
of summer break.

34
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,366
Yeah, freedom!

35
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:36,263
[Buddy talking indistinctly]

36
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,501
Oh! I can smell dinner.

37
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:41,336
Steak!

38
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,602
Give me my board, Tommy.

39
00:04:42,604 --> 00:04:44,205
Come on! Come on!

40
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:46,074
Give me my board.

41
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:48,874
No.

42
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,680
That smells like vegetables.

43
00:04:50,946 --> 00:04:52,514
Your flight comes in
on Thursday, right?

44
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,383
<i>Yup, mid-morning. The tour
scheduled a car for me.</i>

45
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:57,251
<i>Should I meet you guys
at the office?</i>

46
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:59,185
That'd be perfect.
Can you grab your board?

47
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,422
I wanna look at it, make sure
it's holding up all right.

48
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,491
<i>It's holding up great.
No problems at all.</i>

49
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:05,428
<i>The trucks were a little
tight but I loosen them.</i>

50
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,531
Hey, guys.

51
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,500
Oh! Hey, Tommy.

52
00:05:12,535 --> 00:05:14,170
How was the skateboarding?

53
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:15,304
Don't ask.

54
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:16,305
What's for dinner?

55
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,141
It was... okay.

56
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,010
Hey, Sally.

57
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,681
<i>Hey, Tommy.
Looking sharp in the get-up.</i>

58
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,184
Oh. Yeah.

59
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,286
Thanks.

60
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:32,757
Oh, man, quinoa?

61
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,490
Gross.

62
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:35,290
How's London?

63
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,527
<i>Great. It's such a cool city.</i>

64
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:39,562
<i>I'm ready for the tour
to be over, though.</i>

65
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,663
Bring me back anything cool?

66
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:42,331
Actually, that reminds me,

67
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,634
make sure you come home
with your new board.

68
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,435
We wanna make sure
that they can see

69
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:47,805
that you're definitely using the
Mark III on the competition circuit.

70
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,239
<i>Yes, Dad, you mentioned
that yesterday.</i>

71
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,208
Oh. Right, sorry.

72
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,412
Uh, I've got some ideas
on the new campaign, too.

73
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,782
I've got some mock-ups
I can show you in the office.

74
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,417
Smells great, Mom,
what is it?

75
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,219
Garbage.

76
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:03,389
I'm gonna try
to order delivery.

77
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,590
I am calling it
"quinoa-meanwa."

78
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:10,229
It's got kale,
quinoa and tofu...

79
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,062
and a whole lot of spices.

80
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,398
Everything a
growing boy needs.

81
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,633
And no meat?

82
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:18,637
Hey, you two promised that we would
eat my way on Sundays, all right?

83
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,675
I'm just kidding,
I'm sure it's delish.

84
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,273
Uh, I'll be back
when it's ready?

85
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:25,711
Uh, no, you'll be back five
minutes before it's ready,

86
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,078
so you can set the table.

87
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,213
Probably in about 20.

88
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,449
All right, will do.

89
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,316
Come on, Bud.

90
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:46,361
I don't see what's so funny.

91
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,031
Those were some sick moves.

92
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,301
[Mary] Tommy, dinner's ready.

93
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,571
Okay, be right down.

94
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:58,607
He can rush down
for "quinoa-meanwa,"

95
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:00,811
but I'm holding out
for real food.

96
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,712
I'm Buddy, by the way.
Bulldog.

97
00:08:02,714 --> 00:08:04,481
<i>Man's best friend.</i>

98
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,316
<i>Skateboarder extraordinaire.</i>

99
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,687
The filmmaker you saw
is my best mate Tommy.

100
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,088
A couple months ago,
he took up skateboarding.

101
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,425
I'm not sure why,

102
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,294
he's not so great at it.

103
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,296
[groans]

104
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,639
His sister, Sally,
on the other hand,

105
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,473
she was the one
calling from London,

106
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:32,344
she's one heck of a skater.

107
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,623
<i>She's so good in fact,
a few months ago,</i>

108
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,859
<i>she went onto some sort of
world skateboarding tour.</i>

109
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,828
<i>It's pretty cool.</i>

110
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,465
<i>This year, Sally became
the face of Modern Skate,</i>

111
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,570
<i>the skate company
that Tommy's parents started.</i>

112
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,137
<i>I don't totally understand how
all the business stuff works,</i>

113
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,607
<i>because, you know, I'm a dog,</i>

114
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,543
but I think it's working
out pretty well.

115
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,778
Oh, yeah, and that's Alice,

116
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,848
<i>she's Tommy's best friend.
Well, after me.</i>

117
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,884
<i>She's really cool.</i>

118
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:11,518
<i>She likes to make movies, too.</i>

119
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,754
<i>She gives great belly rubs.</i>

120
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:15,555
[Tommy] Buddy, dinner!

121
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:17,792
Oh, man, the good stuff!

122
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:26,902
Come on!

123
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:29,938
Dig in, Buddy.

124
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:32,941
[mumbles] Thank you.

125
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,449
Okay. [clears throat]

126
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,418
Smells great, Mom.

127
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,852
Well, it tastes even better.

128
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:45,989
George?

129
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:47,656
- Dinner.
- Oh. Sorry.

130
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,559
[sighs] Sally seems super
stoked for the new campaign.

131
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,162
I can't wait
to see her Thursday.

132
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,163
Oh. Did she say
how the tour was going?

133
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:57,165
Yeah, great, yeah, she's
definitely the crowd favorite.

134
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,499
She said at the autograph
tent yesterday,

135
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,233
her line was twice as long
as the others.

136
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:01,202
That's awesome.

137
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:03,504
Yeah, we couldn't buy
this kind of publicity.

138
00:10:03,506 --> 00:10:05,173
Yeah, well, we could,
but it'd be expensive.

139
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:07,076
Yeah, well, we definitely
are fortunate.

140
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,512
So, Tommy, how was your day?

141
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:11,212
Pretty good. Oh, I'm getting
better at the move...

142
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,246
You know, I was thinking,

143
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,849
I wonder if anyone else
on the tour

144
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:15,653
would wanna be part
of the campaign.

145
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,724
Uh, I don't know.

146
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,392
And I really don't think
that we have it in the budget

147
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:24,762
to have another spokesperson.

148
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,896
So, Tommy, you were saying...

149
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:27,897
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

150
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,532
Besides, Sally should be enough,
she's the best.

151
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,535
This meeting just has
to go perfect on Friday,

152
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:34,303
I really wanna
knock their socks off.

153
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:35,972
But tomorrow we should go over
the posters again,

154
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,575
gotta nail the layout.

155
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:40,011
May I be excused?

156
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:43,547
Also, Jerome should
dial in Sally's board,

157
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,548
and we have some
backups ready, too.

158
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,585
You know, we don't want anything
to go wrong in the demo.

159
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,557
You agree? What?
What? What'd I do?

160
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:59,497
Tommy was trying to tell you how
his skateboarding went today.

161
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:00,965
What?

162
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,566
Oh, well, gee, I'm sorry.

163
00:11:02,568 --> 00:11:05,004
Yeah, you should know
I'm amped for this meeting.

164
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,806
If we wow the investors, it
could take the company global.

165
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,709
I know.

166
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:11,844
But will you please just spend
some time with Tommy this week?

167
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:13,714
Yeah, I will.

168
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:18,817
What is this stuff anyway?
Let me try this.

169
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:19,953
Quinoa.

170
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,788
- What is it?
- Quinoa.

171
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,958
Well, it looks...
looks delicious.

172
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,359
[stutters]
Yeah, it looks great.

173
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,794
- Hmm.
- [phone rings]

174
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:29,763
Hold on.

175
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,766
Yeah, it's Mr. Hoffman.

176
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,634
<i>Hello, Mr. Hoffman?</i>

177
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,401
Hello, George.

178
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,538
I'm just calling to make sure we're
still on track for our meeting.

179
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,075
My time is valuable,
and I don't want to waste it.

180
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:42,709
Yes, sir, absolutely, sir.

181
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:44,744
Everything is coming together
very well,

182
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,512
I think you're
going to be impressed.

183
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:47,749
Excellent.

184
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:51,153
Time is money, George, and I
will not waste either one.

185
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,753
Great, uh, looking forward
to meeting you.

186
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,921
Thank you.

187
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,891
All right, bye.

188
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
This meeting's
going to be great.

189
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,530
Are you going
to finish your...

190
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:02,763
great dinner?

191
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,031
Yeah, yep.

192
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:06,001
Can you pass me
whatever's in that bowl?

193
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,335
It's called tofu
and vegetables.

194
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,703
You should get to know them.

195
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:10,838
Can you just eat it
like normal food, though?

196
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,144
Mmm-hmm. They can be your
friends, unlike pizza.

197
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,645
- Pizza's my friend.
- Mmm.

198
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,582
Okay. [clears throat]

199
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:34,231
[alarm rings]

200
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:42,739
I'm late for school!

201
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:52,583
Wait a minute...

202
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,585
It's summer break.

203
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,622
[exhales sharply]

204
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:02,260
[yawns]

205
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,705
Morning, sleepyhead.

206
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,308
Hey, there, Tommy.

207
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:16,740
Hey, guys.

208
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,542
Welcome to the world,
sleepyhead.

209
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:20,713
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh. That must be Mrs. Crowley.

210
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,580
Crotchety Crowley?

211
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:23,547
What is she doing here?

212
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,683
Be nice,
she's your sitter today.

213
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:26,853
Sitter?

214
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:28,553
But I'm too old
to have a sitter.

215
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,954
Yes, Tommy, a sitter.

216
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,990
You're not old enough
to be home alone.

217
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,992
I didn't have
a sitter last summer.

218
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:35,626
That's because
Sally was here.

219
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,763
It's just for a few days
until she gets back.

220
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,166
[groans]

221
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,833
You can still play around
the neighborhood.

222
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,069
We're just not gonna leave you
here totally by yourself.

223
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,771
Oh, boy.

224
00:13:45,773 --> 00:13:48,173
Nobody in the neighborhood
likes Mrs. Crowley.

225
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:51,010
No candy, no TV,
no loud noises.

226
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,477
The worst.

227
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:53,679
Well, welcome back,
Mrs. Crowley,

228
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,847
I know that
it's been a few years.

229
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,284
Yes, it has been.

230
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:57,918
Tommy?

231
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,086
You've gotten... taller.

232
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,223
[indistinct TV chatter]

233
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,025
Thanks?

234
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:07,060
Well, everything
appears to be the same here.

235
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,895
Do you still have
that lovely grill out back?

236
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:10,530
Uh, we do.

237
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,665
Excellent. I would love
to cook my lunch on it,

238
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:16,669
I'm using a special spice rub that
was taught to me by the maharaja,

239
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:18,406
when I watched his children.

240
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,209
Uh, sure, you can help yourself
to the pool area and the grill.

241
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,978
Our house is your house.

242
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,013
Uh, okay, dear,
shall we get going?

243
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:26,981
Uh, yes.

244
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,884
Hey, will you please be good
for Mrs. Crowley?

245
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:32,755
She always cooks weird food.

246
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,688
It smells funny.

247
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,358
Hey, be nice.

248
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:40,527
Okay, let me know, give me a
call if you need anything,

249
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,496
and we'll be back by 6:00.

250
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:43,867
- Thanks again.
- Mmm.

251
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:53,944
Hey,

252
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,443
there's a new trend
sweeping the nation

253
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,013
and now I'll never know
what it is.

254
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,648
Children... and dogs...

255
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,320
should spend
their days outside.

256
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,245
Man, I just don't get it.

257
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:30,914
Sally gets to travel the
world on her stupid tour,

258
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,051
but I can't even relax
on my first day off in months.

259
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:36,955
[Buddy] A well-earned day off,
algebra was a killer this year.

260
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:39,890
Does anyone care
what I think? Huh?

261
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:42,394
"Children must spend
their days outside."

262
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,464
Kicked out of my own house.

263
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,898
It's not like anyone pays
attention to me while I'm home.

264
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,701
- Which reminds me...
- Uh, Tommy? Tommy?

265
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:50,935
- ...why is it so hard for Dad to listen to me...
- Tommy!

266
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:52,038
You might wanna watch
where you're going!

267
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,975
Scooter! Why don't you
watch where you're going?

268
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:58,109
Oh, boy.

269
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,577
That's Frankie.

270
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,415
He's kind of got it out for
Tommy for some reason.

271
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,019
Scooter... [laughs]

272
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:09,188
...the goal is
to stay on your board.

273
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,458
Didn't your sister
ever teach you that? [laughs]

274
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:19,631
Oh, hey, Schooner...
or should I say "Scooter,"

275
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,134
since that's more your speed.

276
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,936
How's your best friend,
the pavement?

277
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:34,881
Ouch!

278
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,249
Better call the doctor,

279
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,953
someone's gonna have
a bad case of road rash.

280
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:41,256
Back at it again?

281
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,126
For a smart kid,
you don't learn, do you?

282
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,028
Why don't you just leave the
skateboarding to your sister?

283
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,033
I'm sorry, Frankie, I didn't
mean to run into you.

284
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,368
I'm a good dog, but I'll bark at
him a bunch if you want, Tommy.

285
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,105
Good luck, Scooter,

286
00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:58,906
maybe if they add "asphalt
belly flopping" as an event,

287
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,476
you can join your
sister on tour.

288
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,045
Oh, yeah, Frankie?

289
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,812
Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is?

290
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:05,948
You wanna dance, Schooner?

291
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:07,983
Yeah, yeah, I do.

292
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,052
You think you're so much better than me?
Prove it.

293
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:11,987
You don't wanna go down
this road, Tommy.

294
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,157
Skate-off, you and me.

295
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,360
Pick a time.

296
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,326
Friday, the Oaks Skate Park.

297
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,530
You're on.

298
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,197
I can't wait to embarrass you
out there, Scooter.

299
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,067
I'm about to tell
everybody about this.

300
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,505
Oh, yeah, Scooter!

301
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,574
Scooter!

302
00:17:30,275 --> 00:17:31,909
And it's "Schooner"!

303
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,280
Uh... what just happened?

304
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:39,384
Tommy, what did you just do?

305
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:45,056
I think I just challenged Frankie
to a skate-off on Friday.

306
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:49,461
I'm not sure though, I think I
might've blacked out for a sec.

307
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,428
Nope, you totally did.

308
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,231
What were you thinking?

309
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,134
I don't know, he just...

310
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:58,936
What did I do?

311
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:01,974
Okay. It's okay.

312
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,842
You've been practicing a lot.

313
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,945
I can't skate!
I'm terrible at it.

314
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,446
Well, maybe you
can't beat Frankie,

315
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:12,050
but at least you can avoid
embarrassing yourself?

316
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:17,956
[groans]

317
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:19,959
Oh.

318
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:22,095
[groans]

319
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:33,407
You were saying?

320
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:36,342
Okay, well, there's gotta
be some way out of this.

321
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:38,277
Nope, we shook on it.

322
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,247
Backing out now
would only be worse.

323
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,951
I'd be the spineless kid who
backed out of his own challenge.

324
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,419
Yeah...

325
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:48,255
We have to move.

326
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:50,057
I hear Vancouver's nice
this time of year.

327
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:54,728
I can't go to Canada,
I don't have a passport.

328
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,863
I do love
Canadian bacon, though.

329
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,033
Well, now I think
you might be overreacting.

330
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:01,704
Do they have skateboarding
in Paraguay?

331
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:05,338
They do.

332
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,508
There's literally nowhere
on Earth I can escape this.

333
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,808
[Mrs. Crowley] Tommy!

334
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,545
Five more minutes in the room!

335
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:13,716
Don't want that computer
rotting your brain!

336
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,117
[Tommy groans]

337
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:18,956
Crazy Crowley's gonna kick
me out of the house again.

338
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,424
I can't even hide, how does
she always know where I am?

339
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,227
Well, she is a babysitter,
and that's kind of her job.

340
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:28,164
[humming]

341
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,101
[gasps] Ah.

342
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:33,504
She's ready.

343
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:00,030
W-What? It...

344
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,798
It can't be!

345
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,299
Okay, Tommy,
let's think about this,

346
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,803
there's got to be some alternative
to leaving the country.

347
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,239
[sniffing]

348
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,775
What's that smell?

349
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,075
Mrs. Crowley's probably cooking
some of her weird food.

350
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,310
Weird?

351
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,579
That's the sweet smell
of certified angus.

352
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,382
Somebody open this door.

353
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,550
If Sally were here, she can
give me a few pointers,

354
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,518
maybe a trick or two?

355
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,789
Well, we have a week, I'm
sure you can learn something.

356
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,560
But she doesn't get back till
Thursday, that's way too late.

357
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,196
What is that?

358
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,065
It kind of smells like...

359
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,835
<i>Steak!</i>

360
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,706
<i>No!</i>

361
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:23,719
[distorted scream]

362
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:41,569
[Buddy] Excellent job with
the marinade, Mrs. Crowley.

363
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:43,172
Is that turmeric
I'm tasting?

364
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,375
Tommy Schooner!

365
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:49,545
If I could swim the English
Channel as a 70-year-old,

366
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:52,215
I think I can make my way
out of your parents' pool!

367
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,391
Hey, do you got a sec?

368
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,862
Yeah, I'm just on hold
with Mr. Hoffman's office.

369
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:06,995
Oh, yeah,
these are looking great.

370
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:07,899
Yeah, what are your thoughts?

371
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,199
Uh, I mean,
I think it's a good start.

372
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,400
- I've got a few notes for the printer.
- Hmm.

373
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:13,001
But I think
that would be pretty good.

374
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:14,537
Yeah. No, I love it.
This one's great.

375
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,840
[cell phone rings]

376
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,344
Hello, Mrs. Crowley?

377
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:22,714
He did what?

378
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:26,383
I am so sorry,
we will be right home.

379
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:28,284
- We gotta go.
- No, what about Mr. Hoffman?

380
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,754
You're gonna have
to call him back.

381
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:33,925
What did she say happened?

382
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,628
[Mr. Hoffman] <i>Hello, George.</i>

383
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,596
George?

384
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:40,331
Hello? George?

385
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,811
And here's a little extra
for your dry cleaning.

386
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:55,012
Again, Mrs. Crowley,
we are just so sorry.

387
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:58,382
Not half as sorry as you're going
to be tomorrow, young lady.

388
00:22:58,384 --> 00:23:00,752
I'm putting you two
on the babysitter blacklist

389
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:05,256
until you two teach that boy
and his mutt some manners!

390
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,827
- Mrs. Crowley, if there's anything...
- Mmm!

391
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:08,695
Blacklist.

392
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,336
That can't be
a real thing, right?

393
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,874
Uh, no. [sighs]

394
00:23:20,341 --> 00:23:22,776
So, what was up
with that, Tommy?

395
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:26,479
- Dad, I...
- You know what, I get it.

396
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:28,448
You think you're too old
for a babysitter,

397
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,484
so you pushed
an old woman in a pool?

398
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:31,652
No, what happened was...

399
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,386
Great way to demonstrate
your maturity.

400
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:34,787
I mean, if that's supposed
to prove to us

401
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,690
that you're responsible enough that
you don't need a babysitter...

402
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:38,625
No, I was just trying to...

403
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,596
Don't interrupt me, young man.
Just go straight up to your room.

404
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:43,665
We'll call you down
for dinner.

405
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:50,539
Don't you think you were
just a little harsh on him?

406
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:53,507
- Maybe.
- [both sigh]

407
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:55,610
I wouldn't wanna spend all day
with Mrs. Crowley, either.

408
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:56,913
Well, no one does.

409
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:00,582
- Hey.
- Hey.

410
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:03,519
See the board
Sheckler just released?

411
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,888
Doesn't look that great.

412
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,421
Oh.

413
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:10,325
So...

414
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:16,332
What are we gonna do
about Tommy?

415
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,601
Oh, no luck with
the babysitter?

416
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:22,472
[sighs]
No, everyone was booked.

417
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,909
Well, we'll try
a couple in the morning.

418
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,812
I mean, babysitter blacklist
can't be a real thing.

419
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,748
Thanks, but I meant in
general, not just tomorrow.

420
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:35,385
He's a pre-teen, I'm sure he's just
trying to figure out who he is.

421
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:38,522
Who is he?

422
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:40,825
What do you mean?

423
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,429
You and Sally...

424
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,967
have been best buds
since she was born.

425
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:54,005
And I'm just a little worried
that Tommy feels left out.

426
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:56,540
I mean, you know that is why

427
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,742
he started taking up all this
skateboarding stuff recently.

428
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,109
No, he always skated.

429
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,379
No.

430
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,783
We have always given him
skateboard stuff.

431
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:07,687
It's only recently that
he started focusing on it.

432
00:25:09,722 --> 00:25:12,091
Okay, I'll talk to him
this week.

433
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:15,094
Uh, next week,
after the pitch meeting.

434
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:17,630
Okay.

435
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:20,666
- Thank you.
- Sure.

436
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:23,870
- Good night.
- Good night.

437
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,707
Seriously, it's like, they
didn't make any improvements

438
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,744
to the last model,
though, you know?

439
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:34,147
Please, don't stay up all night
scouting the competition.

440
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:35,883
I know how you get.

441
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,520
Just... what are
they thinking?

442
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:43,057
They didn't even change
the graphics.

443
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:44,825
George.

444
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:49,530
It's like they don't
wanna sell skateboards.

445
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,599
- George.
- No, that's good for us.

446
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,567
We'll sell more.

447
00:25:57,339 --> 00:25:59,271
No, it's fine,
we'll sell 'em, you know?

448
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:00,406
- George!
- Okay, good night.

449
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:01,576
Love you.

450
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:12,053
Are you sure?

451
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:14,156
Okay, thank you.

452
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,691
No. No one can come. I think
the blacklist is a real thing.

453
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:20,194
Oh, man, that just means I'm gonna
have to work from home today.

454
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,662
[George] Well, no,
that's not a good idea,

455
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,564
the posters have to get out to the printer.
I'll stay home.

456
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:25,135
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

457
00:26:25,535 --> 00:26:26,768
No, wait, you have a meeting.

458
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,537
No, I think it's a call...

459
00:26:29,538 --> 00:26:31,606
No, you're right,
it's a meeting.

460
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,043
I could come with you guys.

461
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:36,311
Really?

462
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:38,715
Yeah, it's cool. I could come
to work with you guys, and...

463
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:41,783
I'm sorry about yesterday.

464
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:43,753
[sighs] Well, the office
isn't gonna be much fun.

465
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,453
It's cool, I don't mind,

466
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:48,457
and it is my fault that we
can't get a babysitter.

467
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:50,094
I promise I won't
cause problems.

468
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:54,097
- Can you be ready in 15?
- You bet.

469
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:58,768
[Buddy] They hand down
our sentence?

470
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,569
We're off to the big house,
aren't we?

471
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:02,006
It's gonna be perfect.

472
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:05,609
I'm gonna pick up a few pointers
at the skate company, and...

473
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:09,814
Watch out, Frankie, I'm gonna get a
crash course at kicking your butt.

474
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:11,615
Crash course?

475
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,052
You might wanna rethink
your choice of words, Tommy.

476
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:24,629
[Buddy] I just wanna thank you guys
for letting me tag along today.

477
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:27,764
I've been thinking about taking
some business courses online,

478
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:30,937
and I think it'll really help
getting some real world experience.

479
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:38,009
You can hang out
in my office if you want.

480
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,780
Tommy, my man! Haven't seen you
in a minute. How's it hanging?

481
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:43,748
Yeah, pretty good, I just
started summer break, so...

482
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,316
Nice.

483
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,220
How I miss those
carefree summer days.

484
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,421
I was looking at the Mark
III, by the way, sick trucks.

485
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:51,789
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

486
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:55,295
The Mark IV is gonna
blow your mind.

487
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:58,132
You wanna come check out
our prototype?

488
00:27:58,733 --> 00:27:59,630
Go ahead.

489
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:00,434
- Yeah, sure.
- Sweet.

490
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,304
Welcome to the workshop.

491
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:08,942
When it comes
to skateboarding,

492
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:11,677
it's all about manipulating
the center of mass

493
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,215
to increase the inertial
payout of the bearings.

494
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:17,616
Of course, it helps if you can
get the coefficient of friction

495
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:21,387
down to about
point-five, point-two.

496
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:23,957
But by increasing
the drag ratio

497
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:26,061
and decreasing the weight,

498
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:28,995
I've hit a real
Lorentzian transformation

499
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:31,065
between the rider
and the board,

500
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:35,635
which obviously is gonna give you
some ridiculous speed yields

501
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:37,738
when you run it
outside of the simulations.

502
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,775
I was hoping for a business practical,
not a lesson in space-time.

503
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:45,079
Uh, Jerome, all this
is pretty fascinating.

504
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:46,782
Right?

505
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:51,654
Yeah, totes, but how can I
relate this to, say, a trick?

506
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:57,327
Dude, like every
single way possible.

507
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:59,329
All right, check it.

508
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,932
Let's say you're booking along
at some velocity...

509
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,633
V, right?

510
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:08,605
And you wanna maximize your airtime
and your delta T, over here, right?

511
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:11,973
It's all about this integral
over the cosine of the vector,

512
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:15,146
which spits out your
Y component, and...

513
00:29:17,014 --> 00:29:21,684
ultimately, the amount of force you
gotta spit out on this distance, X,

514
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:23,221
in relation to
your fulcrum point.

515
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:26,889
I think he's saying
you gotta push down hard

516
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,391
on the back of the board
to make it go high,

517
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,894
but I might've missed a step.

518
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,628
Uh, let me start over.

519
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,765
Uh, Jerome,
I just remembered,

520
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:39,737
I gotta help my mom out
with... something.

521
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,573
All good, little man.

522
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,810
Anytime you wanna unlock the secrets
to the skateboard universe,

523
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,145
stop on by.

524
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:48,045
All right, thanks.

525
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,215
Come on, Buddy.

526
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,386
That was fast.

527
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,787
Ugh.

528
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:57,888
Way over my head.

529
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,756
[chuckles] Yeah, most
people are with him.

530
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,594
I think I noticed a
miscalculation on his notes.

531
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:05,196
But my trigonometry
is a little rusty.

532
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:07,066
Are these for
the pitch meeting on Friday?

533
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,836
Yep, gotta impress
Mr. Hoffman.

534
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:14,006
He represents one of the largest
investment firms in Los Angeles,

535
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:17,141
so if they see
something they like,

536
00:30:17,143 --> 00:30:19,812
it could take Modern Skate
to the global market,

537
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:23,748
and maybe it would get
your dad enough funding

538
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,786
to get that skate park built
that he's always wanted.

539
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:27,421
That's exciting.

540
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:29,021
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:30,691
Can we get a bigger pool?

542
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:33,694
Ha-ha. What? So you can push
another babysitter in?

543
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:37,630
I'm never going to be able
to live that down, am I?

544
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:38,799
Nope.

545
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:40,935
Huh.

546
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,136
- [sighs]
- What? What's wrong?

547
00:30:43,138 --> 00:30:44,105
Ah...

548
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,505
I just can't put
my finger on it.

549
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:49,009
I just feel like something is
missing from this campaign.

550
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,246
Nah, Sally's great.

551
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:52,914
She's gonna
knock their socks off.

552
00:30:53,181 --> 00:30:54,282
[chuckles]

553
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,517
What, what's so funny?

554
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,888
Oh, that's just a phrase your
father used the other night.

555
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:04,859
How did Sally get so good
at skateboarding?

556
00:31:08,164 --> 00:31:12,033
Oh, geez, I mean, she started
with your dad when she was four.

557
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,502
Did you ever go out with her?

558
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:17,271
Who me? [laughs]
No. I never learned.

559
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:19,607
Um, your father tried to teach
me when we were dating

560
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,077
and I thought I was
gonna break my neck.

561
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,816
Dad skated when he was a kid?

562
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,453
What, are you kidding?

563
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:32,921
I mean, your father
lived for skateboarding,

564
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,524
that's why he started
this company.

565
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,859
I guess I never
thought of him

566
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:40,364
being involved in any other
way than the business.

567
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,002
Well, maybe you
should go talk to him.

568
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,038
You know, I'm sure he would
love to share that with you.

569
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,208
Yeah, maybe.

570
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,844
Do you mind if I go
mess around on the half pipe?

571
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,949
Be my guest, I have to finish
proofing these, anyway.

572
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,157
[sighs]

573
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,137
Is this leftover quinoa?

574
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:22,542
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
you said you liked it.

575
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,545
I did say that,
I love it, thank you.

576
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,881
Does Tommy want some?

577
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,284
Oh, no, he already ate.

578
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,118
I made him a sandwich earlier.

579
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,853
Mmm. Sandwich.

580
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,190
[Mary] Hey, how'd the meeting
go this morning?

581
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:40,725
Good, good, the factory said
they can triple the units

582
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:41,626
as soon as we
give them the word.

583
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:42,596
That's great.

584
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,165
Did Tommy come
and talk to you earlier today?

585
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:46,933
No, what's up?

586
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:50,369
He just asked me how Sally
got so good at skateboarding,

587
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:51,905
so I told him
to come talk to you.

588
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:54,842
Really? Yeah,
tell him that's fine.

589
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:58,010
Well, if he does, will you please
just make some time for him?

590
00:32:58,012 --> 00:32:59,180
Of course.

591
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,625
[inaudible]

592
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:31,813
Hi, yeah, the pepperoni pizza I
ordered for the Modern Skate offices,

593
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:34,315
yeah, I just wanted to remind
you to, when you get here,

594
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,386
call my cell phone,
not the main line.

595
00:33:36,886 --> 00:33:38,186
Okay.

596
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:39,956
Oh, yeah, just five minutes?
Great, thank you.

597
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:42,091
Hey, Tommy, what's up?

598
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,259
Sorry to bother you
on the phone.

599
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:46,362
No worries,
nothing important.

600
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:48,665
How's everything going
for the campaign?

601
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,099
Great, really great.

602
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:52,068
Gonna launch us
into the stratosphere.

603
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:57,239
I was looking at the Mark IV with
Jerome, it looks really cool.

604
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:59,209
Yeah, he's doing some
next level stuff over there.

605
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:03,112
I cannot wait to try it out
when it's available.

606
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:04,481
Really?

607
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:08,284
Yeah? Uh... I mean, I'm sure
he can lend you a board,

608
00:34:08,286 --> 00:34:10,287
a prototype,
if you're interested.

609
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:14,324
Well, you know,
I'm okay with my board.

610
00:34:14,326 --> 00:34:16,093
Old reliable, you know?

611
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:17,995
Let me see it.

612
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,364
All right, here you go.

613
00:34:21,366 --> 00:34:22,667
Yeah, it's a good board.

614
00:34:23,201 --> 00:34:25,069
Solid construction...

615
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:28,338
Wait, is this
Sally's old Mark II?

616
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,008
[chuckles] It sure is, yeah.

617
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,144
Yeah, this is a good board.

618
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:34,380
Think she did
her first 50-50 on it.

619
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,350
Man, would I love to unlock
some of that magic.

620
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:42,389
Well, you know, it's not about the
board, it's all in the shoes.

621
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:44,089
Oh, really?

622
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:47,092
No, no,
I'm just kidding.

623
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:49,727
It's all in the rider, I mean,
you just gotta put the time in.

624
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:50,963
You wanna practice a little?

625
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,299
- That'd be awesome!
- Tonight?

626
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:57,269
Oh, man, really?
You sure you aren't too busy?

627
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:58,869
I'm never too busy
for you, buddy.

628
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:00,373
Yeah, we'll hit the skate
park by the house.

629
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,475
Thanks, Dad.

630
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,242
Sure. Yeah, I've got a few more
hours of work here to finish up,

631
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:05,143
and then we'll go.

632
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,379
Nice.

633
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:07,582
This came for you.

634
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:09,247
Uh, me? I didn't...

635
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:11,249
I didn't order a pizza.

636
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:13,319
Oh, that's funny because
it's got your name on it.

637
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,388
Well, I gotta go.
[chuckles]

638
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,591
Thanks again, Dad.

639
00:35:17,258 --> 00:35:19,759
I'm taking him to
the skate park tonight.

640
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:22,230
Oh, good, I'm glad you're
doing one thing I ask of you.

641
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,199
I love you,
and your quinoa-meanwa.

642
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,003
But it's not pizza.

643
00:35:31,073 --> 00:35:32,307
Oh, there you are.

644
00:35:42,452 --> 00:35:45,252
I'm just glad
all this stuff still fits.

645
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:47,556
It's been a while.
All right, here goes nothing.

646
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:24,161
[exhales sharply]

647
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,531
That was pretty good.

648
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:30,567
Well, thanks, I don't know
how I missed that one,

649
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,069
I used to do those
in my sleep.

650
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,472
I'd score it an 8.6.

651
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:38,343
Okay, your turn, Tommy.

652
00:37:03,636 --> 00:37:06,238
I'd give it a... 2.1.

653
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,341
Okay, pretty good.

654
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:11,442
I didn't fall,
that's an improvement.

655
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:14,180
He's self-taught. I'm changing
my score to a five-even.

656
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:17,383
It's fine,
these things take time.

657
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:21,187
Say I didn't have time.

658
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:22,889
What do you mean?

659
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,125
Say I didn't have until...

660
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,492
I don't know... Friday?

661
00:37:27,494 --> 00:37:29,228
What happens Friday?

662
00:37:30,265 --> 00:37:32,364
Nothing, nothing
is happening on Friday.

663
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:33,667
Nothing good.

664
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:38,906
But say, hypothetically, I had
to learn a trick by Friday,

665
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:40,808
where would you start?

666
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,478
Okay. Uh...

667
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,879
How's your ollie?

668
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:50,385
Let's say, hypothetically,
that I can't do one.

669
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:55,658
[chuckles] Okay, we have
our work cut out for us.

670
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:57,826
Let's head down here.

671
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:00,994
Okay, so when you're ready to jump,
you're gonna bend your knees,

672
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:03,564
push down on the back,
and then when you jump,

673
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:06,233
that's when you slide your front
foot forward, like that, okay?

674
00:38:06,235 --> 00:38:07,935
And it should make that sound
as you do it...

675
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:09,203
[mimics scraping noise]

676
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:10,471
...just tearing up your shoes,

677
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:12,742
so we have to buy new shoes
all the time, okay?

678
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:16,577
When you do that, that's what makes the
board kind of come up and level out.

679
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:17,746
All right?

680
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:19,214
Simple, right?

681
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,050
Yep.

682
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,450
I got four knees to bend.

683
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:23,887
I'll sit this lesson out.

684
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:27,023
All right, you got this.

685
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,058
- Okay, so I bend the knees...
- Yes.

686
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,292
- Back...
- Yep.

687
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:33,094
- Slide up...
- Yep.

688
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:35,398
When you're jumping, you tear up
your shoes, just like I taught you.

689
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,935
Okay. Did Sally
learn this way?

690
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,636
Oh, yeah, I mean, I think
we were skating together

691
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:42,671
since she was like,
four, I think.

692
00:38:42,673 --> 00:38:44,207
She was a quick learner?

693
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,645
She was, uh, she took to a
board like a duck to water.

694
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:51,682
And, you know, I was skating more
then, too, I had more time...

695
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,351
I don't know, I think by the
time you were old enough,

696
00:38:55,353 --> 00:38:58,053
she was so advanced, and I was
busy with the company and...

697
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:00,224
It's cool, this is fun now.

698
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,492
- Yeah, right?
- Oh, yeah.

699
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:03,993
You know what, let's...
Wanna try another one?

700
00:39:03,995 --> 00:39:05,730
I'll be your human safety net.

701
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:07,432
All right, whoa. Got it.

702
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,267
- All right, ready?
- Yep.

703
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:13,873
Bend your knees,
and three, two, one, pop!

704
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:17,474
- All right!
- I didn't fall!

705
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:19,477
No, but you got
the baby ollie.

706
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,813
- All right, let's go for a toddler ollie.
- Okay.

707
00:39:22,715 --> 00:39:24,617
Three, two, one, pop!

708
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:29,085
Okay, might've been another baby,
but three years old maybe,

709
00:39:29,087 --> 00:39:30,388
I don't know
what toddlers are.

710
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,390
- Okay, we're good though.
- I didn't fall, so...

711
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:35,260
We're making progress,
we're both still alive.

712
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,310
[inaudible]

713
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:13,500
Thanks for coaching
me today, Dad.

714
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:15,568
No problem.

715
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,204
I don't know if you'll be ready for
anything on Friday, hypothetically,

716
00:40:18,206 --> 00:40:20,842
but you're definitely better now
than you were even a few hours ago.

717
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:22,742
Hey, Tommy. Hey, Mr. Schooner.

718
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,847
- Hey, Alice, nice to see you.
- You, too.

719
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,714
You guys skate around a bit?

720
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,483
Yeah, he was just teaching
me a few moves for...

721
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:31,320
you know, Friday.

722
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,355
- Oh. Okay, okay!
- Yeah.

723
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:36,927
Oh. Oh, cool.

724
00:40:37,794 --> 00:40:39,193
Yeah, actually turns out he's
got some pretty sweet moves.

725
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:43,066
Okay, all right, I'm gonna go home,
it's my night to cook dinner.

726
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:44,500
Uh, you'll be there soon?

727
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:46,200
Yeah.

728
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:47,703
Okay, Alice,
you guys have fun.

729
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:50,907
So...

730
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:54,245
still up
for that skate-off?

731
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:57,714
Gotta. I mean,
my reputation's on the line.

732
00:40:58,148 --> 00:41:00,181
Plus, my dad taught me
a bunch today,

733
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:02,619
and with Sally's help on Thursday, I
think I'll be able to hold my own.

734
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:04,354
If you say so.

735
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,855
You wanna practice some more?

736
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:07,690
No. You brought
the camera, right?

737
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:09,794
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Let's shoot around a little.

738
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:18,603
Alice, is the camera rolling?

739
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:21,939
Rolling.

740
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,608
[Tommy] All right.

741
00:41:24,677 --> 00:41:27,912
Okay, I just need better than an
8.6 and I take home the gold.

742
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:34,250
Hey, Scooter.

743
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:35,853
Hey, Frankie.

744
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:37,789
Your dog skates, too?

745
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:41,693
Man, is there anyone in your family
who can't skate, other than you?

746
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:44,194
Nice one, Frankie.

747
00:41:44,196 --> 00:41:47,466
Listen, why don't we do this
right now, and get it over with?

748
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:49,601
Really?

749
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:50,737
Psych!

750
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:52,804
No way I'm letting you off
that easy.

751
00:41:52,806 --> 00:41:56,874
I'm gonna make you look silly in
front of the biggest crowd possible.

752
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:59,578
Hey, Frankie, you mind
getting out of my shot?

753
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,148
Your big head's
getting in the way.

754
00:42:01,581 --> 00:42:03,815
I'm done wasting my time
with you nerds, anyway.

755
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:04,951
Laters.

756
00:42:06,854 --> 00:42:08,655
Thanks, Alice.
Camera still rolling?

757
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,222
Rolling.

758
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,827
All right, ready,
and three, two, action!

759
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,596
[Buddy] Coming in
for my close-up.

760
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,168
[barking]

761
00:42:21,502 --> 00:42:24,705
9.1.
Buddy takes home the gold!

762
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:27,473
Buddy!

763
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:28,574
Buddy!

764
00:42:28,576 --> 00:42:29,510
Buddy!

765
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:31,813
[Tommy] Good job, Buddy!

766
00:42:36,618 --> 00:42:38,586
[groans]

767
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:40,687
Come on, Frankie!

768
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:42,992
Sally's never gonna respect
moves like that.

769
00:42:56,271 --> 00:42:58,839
You're a pro, yes, you are.

770
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:01,575
Good job, Buddy, good job.

771
00:43:01,577 --> 00:43:03,145
Okay, let's go,
let's go back, boy.

772
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,589
Thanks again for dinner,
Mr. and Mrs. S.

773
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,264
I gave you pure gold
to work with, as usual.

774
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,712
Nice job, good job, Buddy.

775
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:36,814
You're welcome.

776
00:43:48,728 --> 00:43:49,894
[groans]

777
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,598
- [both laugh]
- Wait a minute, replay that.

778
00:43:56,502 --> 00:43:57,568
[groans]

779
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,105
<i>Come on, Frankie.</i>

780
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:02,574
<i>Sally's never gonna respect
moves like that.</i>

781
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:06,779
- Oh!
- Did he just say "Sally"?

782
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:09,413
Looks like someone's
got a little crush.

783
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:10,781
Ugh!

784
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,119
Gross, no way.

785
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,553
This is too good.

786
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:17,290
We can't use this, right?

787
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:20,892
Not unless you wanna make him the
laughing stock of the entire school.

788
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:22,661
So tempting.

789
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:25,598
Wait.

790
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:30,171
[groans]

791
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,673
<i>Come on, Frankie.</i>

792
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:35,875
You guys mind keeping it down?

793
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:37,677
I had a tough day riding.

794
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:44,652
Same thing we did
at the park, yep.

795
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,253
Great.

796
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,724
[phone rings]

797
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,693
Modern Skate.

798
00:44:53,695 --> 00:44:54,896
All right, ready?

799
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,157
Yes!

800
00:45:30,901 --> 00:45:32,402
[indistinct]

801
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:37,207
[inaudible]

802
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:13,312
So, what do you think?

803
00:46:14,213 --> 00:46:17,581
Whoa. Mom, these look awesome.

804
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:21,153
Aw. Thanks. I think the printer
did a pretty good job.

805
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:22,719
You've got
a great eye, though.

806
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:24,790
The image, like, really pops.

807
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:26,859
Aw. That's so sweet.

808
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,331
So, how is skateboard
training coming along?

809
00:46:31,697 --> 00:46:33,697
Okay, yeah,
Dad's a good teacher.

810
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,467
And you were right, he's a pretty
baller skateboarder still.

811
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,405
[laughs]
I don't doubt that.

812
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,742
So, why the sudden interest
in skateboarding?

813
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:49,282
- Oh, no reason, I just really...
- [Buddy barks]

814
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:51,418
What in the world?

815
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,721
Welcome home, Sal.

816
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:01,060
Oh! So good to see you!

817
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:02,228
Oh, good, you came.

818
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,230
I was trying to tell you,
Sally's here!

819
00:47:04,232 --> 00:47:06,899
- You got in early.
- Yeah, about an hour or so.

820
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:09,237
- Luckily, the driver was already there.
- Oh, good.

821
00:47:09,837 --> 00:47:11,203
Hey, monkey, good to see you.

822
00:47:11,205 --> 00:47:12,374
Hey.

823
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:21,483
[laughter]

824
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:23,884
Welcome back.

825
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:27,287
Okay, well, gang, in honor
of my lovely daughter,

826
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:30,958
and the face of our company,
returning home from her... 13?

827
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,959
Fifteen.

828
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:33,996
Fifteen-country tour,

829
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:36,999
what do you say we take the
rest of the afternoon off?

830
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,867
Yeah!

831
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:41,336
Billy, wanna get us
some pizzas?

832
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:43,172
Okay. Put it on
the company card.

833
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:50,812
So, which was your
favorite country?

834
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:54,615
- Uh, either Italy or England.
- Nice.

835
00:47:54,617 --> 00:47:57,852
Italy was just gorgeous, and we
didn't have great weather in England,

836
00:47:57,854 --> 00:47:59,722
but London was super cool.

837
00:47:59,724 --> 00:48:00,856
Nice.

838
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:02,157
How was the end
of the school year?

839
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,725
Uh, it was okay.

840
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:06,130
One B, the rest were As.

841
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,265
Mark Jacobson
got his bike stolen.

842
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,302
And then someone let a frog loose
in the girls' locker room, so...

843
00:48:12,304 --> 00:48:14,269
[laughs] Was it you?

844
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:17,072
No, I did convince
one of the teachers

845
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:21,278
to play a movie for three straight
classes for "cultural purposes."

846
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,483
So Dad told me yesterday that
you guys were skateboarding?

847
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:28,919
Yeah, he was just teaching me
a few moves.

848
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:30,322
What brought that on?

849
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:33,655
Well, I've been trying
a little, since you left.

850
00:48:33,657 --> 00:48:36,562
You could tell, he was bummed
when you were gone, so...

851
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:39,295
Aw. That's really
sweet of you.

852
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:41,166
- Shut up.
- [laughs]

853
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:45,403
Ugh. And then I went and did
something pretty stupid.

854
00:48:45,837 --> 00:48:47,005
Uh-oh.

855
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:51,275
So I was mad at Dad 'cause he
made me have a babysitter,

856
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:53,077
and for some other things,

857
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:56,115
and then I ran into Frankie,

858
00:48:56,315 --> 00:49:01,253
like, literally, ran into
Frankie, on the street.

859
00:49:01,255 --> 00:49:03,087
- Frankie from the skate park?
- Yes.

860
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:04,924
Always hung around
with Stewart and Worm?

861
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:07,394
Yeah, that Frankie.

862
00:49:07,928 --> 00:49:11,297
And he said some things, that
like, normally doesn't bug me,

863
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:13,467
but I just let it get to me,

864
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:18,138
and I challenged him
to a skate-off...

865
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,374
tomorrow.

866
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:22,342
Oh, monkey.

867
00:49:23,178 --> 00:49:25,244
You were always good at getting
yourself into trouble.

868
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,979
And you were always good at
getting me out of trouble, so...

869
00:49:27,981 --> 00:49:29,816
There you are, I want you
to meet the sales team,

870
00:49:29,818 --> 00:49:31,150
they're gonna be a big part
of the meeting tomorrow.

871
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:32,353
Talk later.

872
00:49:35,824 --> 00:49:39,594
Hey, buddy, it's okay, your dad's
just really excited for this meeting.

873
00:49:39,828 --> 00:49:41,963
It's fine, I get it.

874
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:50,003
Mike, here's the one who decided to
use the softer metal on the trucks.

875
00:49:50,005 --> 00:49:51,838
[Buddy] Too much
excitement today.

876
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,173
I think I overdid it.

877
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:55,010
[George] But it hasn't been
a problem, right?

878
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:58,112
Well, she's been
on cement parks,

879
00:49:58,114 --> 00:50:00,215
pre-fab, kind of
traditional parks as well,

880
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:01,950
and no real issues.

881
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:07,457
...designs and color wise,
I mean...

882
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:10,292
[woman] She's all about
purples...

883
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:13,795
What is it, Tommy?

884
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:15,130
I think Mr. Hoffman is here.

885
00:50:15,132 --> 00:50:16,098
What?

886
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:20,370
Okay.

887
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:23,707
Uh, Mr. Hoffman...

888
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:26,741
[clears throat] My goodness...

889
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:29,145
George, it's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

890
00:50:29,147 --> 00:50:31,380
Good to finally meet you, too,
Mr. Hoffman.

891
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:33,449
You're here early.

892
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:35,317
Yeah, I tried to tell you that
the other day on the phone,

893
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:37,486
but we got disconnected.

894
00:50:37,488 --> 00:50:40,022
Anyway, I thought I'd come by and introduce
myself before our meeting tomorrow.

895
00:50:40,024 --> 00:50:42,024
I hope that didn't cause
any inconvenience.

896
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:43,759
No, not at all.

897
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:44,994
We're just taking
a little break

898
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:46,963
because my daughter
came in early as well.

899
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,233
Hi, Mr. Hoffman, I'm Sally Schooner.
I've heard so much about you.

900
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:52,402
That's good.

901
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:54,971
She actually just got back from a
world tour, she's been skating...

902
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:59,142
Oh, yes, I am very well aware of Sally
and her skateboarding accomplishments.

903
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,512
Ah.

904
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:03,280
Well, great, I'm sure you'll
learn even more tomorrow

905
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:04,881
when you see
the great ad campaign

906
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:07,218
that our marketing team
has been working on.

907
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,353
Mr. Hoffman, Mary Schooner, head
of marketing here at Modern Skate.

908
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:12,924
And yet another Schooner,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

909
00:51:12,926 --> 00:51:15,126
You truly have
a family company here.

910
00:51:15,328 --> 00:51:17,195
Yes, very much so.

911
00:51:17,197 --> 00:51:18,963
And please come in,
we got pizza coming.

912
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,700
Oh, no, thank you.

913
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,302
I appreciate that, but we're gonna go.
We do look forward to seeing

914
00:51:23,304 --> 00:51:25,970
what you're going to be presenting
us in the morning. Good evening.

915
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:27,004
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

916
00:51:27,006 --> 00:51:27,905
Schooner family.

917
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:29,075
Thank you.

918
00:51:35,014 --> 00:51:37,282
[nervously]
Did that feel like...

919
00:51:37,284 --> 00:51:39,151
Tomorrow's gonna be
a total disaster?

920
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:43,055
He seemed much more pleasant
on the phone.

921
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:44,022
Yeah.

922
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:45,791
Who wants pizza?

923
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:48,061
Ooh! I'll have a slice.

924
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,029
I'm sorry.

925
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,549
So let me get this straight.

926
00:52:08,551 --> 00:52:10,316
You challenged Frankie,

927
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:12,488
who's probably been skateboarding
since he was seven,

928
00:52:12,821 --> 00:52:14,690
to a skate-off tomorrow,

929
00:52:15,123 --> 00:52:18,193
and you've kind of been skating,
for what, three months?

930
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,530
I'd say like 80/20, like...

931
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:24,599
skating to goofing off.

932
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:29,203
But I envision myself pulling, like, this
sweet move that nobody's seen before.

933
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:30,871
That's helpful, right?

934
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:32,306
What's the trick?

935
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,508
I don't know, I'm not an
expert at this stuff.

936
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,112
You're ridiculous.

937
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:38,480
Is Vancouver
out of the question?

938
00:52:38,482 --> 00:52:39,649
What?

939
00:52:39,949 --> 00:52:41,718
It's a little town in Canada.

940
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,420
They make
a lot of movies there.

941
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:46,321
Some say it looks like New
York, but I can always tell.

942
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:47,692
Never mind.

943
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,060
I've just been working
really hard this past week,

944
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:55,265
and wondering if you could give me
a few, like, last minute pointers?

945
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:59,235
Tommy, it takes more than a
week to get good at anything,

946
00:52:59,237 --> 00:53:00,738
let alone skateboarding.

947
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,258
I don't think my scale
goes high enough for that.

948
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,362
Maybe a 12?
Fifteen?

949
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:28,900
You think I could learn how to do any
part of what I just did in a week?

950
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,469
That sequence alone took months
of practice for each part,

951
00:53:32,471 --> 00:53:35,375
based on years of effort to
master the most basic skills.

952
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:37,275
So I'm doomed.

953
00:53:37,577 --> 00:53:39,644
Vancouver it is.

954
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:40,746
I'll pack a bag...

955
00:53:41,014 --> 00:53:43,114
Of what, I don't quite know.

956
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:44,948
I didn't say that.

957
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,318
I just think you need to set
realistic goals for yourself,

958
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,288
and appreciate how much
work goes into things.

959
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,095
You think I could get as good as you
are with one of these in just a week?

960
00:53:57,097 --> 00:53:59,598
I've seen you and Alice running
around with the camera every day

961
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,835
since Dad got his for
Christmas three years ago.

962
00:54:02,236 --> 00:54:05,239
Not to mention all the time you
spend watching movies in your room.

963
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,341
I've seen like ten movies in my
life, and they're all rom-coms.

964
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:10,576
Not true.

965
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:12,446
I made you watch
<i>Cowboys vs Dinosaurs.</i>

966
00:54:12,714 --> 00:54:14,248
Classic.

967
00:54:15,616 --> 00:54:17,250
And it was very good.

968
00:54:17,252 --> 00:54:19,621
All I'm saying is,
these things take time.

969
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:22,589
But I don't have time.

970
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:25,558
I'm gonna embarrass myself if I
don't do something tomorrow.

971
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,261
Well, let's see
what you've got.

972
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,586
I hear Vancouver is lovely
this time of year.

973
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,621
Seventy-eight
and sunny yesterday.

974
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,658
You're like the best skater
in the world,

975
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,464
isn't there a piece of magical
advice you can give me?

976
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,330
All I can suggest is,
do your best.

977
00:55:03,332 --> 00:55:05,569
Whatever you're best at,
do it the best you can.

978
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,602
Whatever you're worst at,

979
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,238
do that to the best of
your abilities, as well.

980
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,242
Eight grade is gonna be rough.

981
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:16,244
Hopefully, everyone has a great summer
and they'll forget about tomorrow.

982
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,180
I'm sure some
dance craze viral video

983
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,784
will bump you down to the
number three spot this summer.

984
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,252
Let's get home.

985
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:46,542
You've definitely got the riding
straight and stopping thing down.

986
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,779
Thanks, but even
Buddy can do that.

987
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:50,716
[Buddy] What exactly
is that supposed to mean?

988
00:55:52,518 --> 00:55:56,587
Please don't tell Mom and Dad
about this stupid bet,

989
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:59,491
I don't want them to know how
much of an idiot I was about it.

990
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:01,693
All good, mum's the word.

991
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:04,696
Besides, I think they're still a little
stressed over the meeting tomorrow.

992
00:56:21,147 --> 00:56:23,282
It's fine, right? I mean,
tell me it's gonna be fine,

993
00:56:23,284 --> 00:56:26,150
because maybe they were just tired
from traveling all day, right?

994
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:28,754
I mean, I hope so, because they
basically walked into a pizza party.

995
00:56:28,756 --> 00:56:30,589
I mean, they think they're
coming to a place of business,

996
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,325
and there we all are,
4:00 p.m. on a Thursday,

997
00:56:33,327 --> 00:56:36,395
just relaxing, about to
chow down on some pizza,

998
00:56:36,397 --> 00:56:39,231
and then, I ask them
if they wanna stay?

999
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,401
I mean, we don't even know if
they like pizza, they're from LA!

1000
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:44,336
Yes, George, I'm sure they like
pizza, everyone likes pizza.

1001
00:56:44,338 --> 00:56:46,539
Okay, that's true, good point,
everyone likes pizza.

1002
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:49,543
So, yeah, they're probably just tired,
it's what, a seven-hour flight from LA?

1003
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:50,879
Hon, will you relax?

1004
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,446
Take a seat.

1005
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:54,449
[George sighs]

1006
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:59,352
I have been going over all the
boards for the presentation,

1007
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:01,890
and you know
this material cold.

1008
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:07,862
And if they pass, then I'm perfectly
content with the pool size we have.

1009
00:57:07,864 --> 00:57:10,465
I'm sorry. Sally, what was
your read on Mr. Hoffman?

1010
00:57:10,801 --> 00:57:12,433
I thought he was nice.

1011
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:14,468
Quiet but
he was probably tired.

1012
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:16,336
Tired. Yeah, right, see?

1013
00:57:16,338 --> 00:57:18,272
I'm just overreacting.

1014
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:20,241
Oh, here's an idea, have you guys
ever thought about trying to...

1015
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:21,375
Mary, can I take
a look at your tablet?

1016
00:57:21,377 --> 00:57:22,878
I wanna review
the earnings reports.

1017
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,146
Maybe if we can't wow them
with the campaign,

1018
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:26,415
we can do it with the numbers.

1019
00:57:27,784 --> 00:57:30,419
Tommy, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

1020
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:32,923
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

1021
00:57:33,222 --> 00:57:35,126
Hey, Tommy. Just do your best.

1022
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:38,493
Thanks, and thanks for going
to the skate park with me.

1023
00:57:38,495 --> 00:57:39,663
[George] Ah-ha!

1024
00:57:40,129 --> 00:57:40,964
There's a mistake
in the numbers.

1025
00:57:40,966 --> 00:57:42,934
Ah, there's a mistake
in the numbers.

1026
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,634
I told Steve to double check
all these reports, and...

1027
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:49,237
Oh, no, no, no.
These reports are perfect.

1028
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:51,909
Is everything gonna be all right?
Dad's really stressing.

1029
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:55,945
This pitch meeting
is really important,

1030
00:57:55,947 --> 00:57:58,716
and Dad just found out

1031
00:57:58,718 --> 00:58:01,452
that Sheckler Boards just signed a
huge deal with a Chinese company.

1032
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:05,658
If we can't compete,
we could lose the business.

1033
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:09,560
I don't want you to worry,
you're gonna be great.

1034
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:12,429
I just hope that we have
what Mr. Hoffman wants,

1035
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,733
and if we don't, we don't.

1036
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,003
All right? And we're gonna
figure something out.

1037
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,802
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1038
00:58:18,804 --> 00:58:21,305
We spend how much
every year on staplers?

1039
00:58:21,307 --> 00:58:23,575
Oh. I need to rein
your father in.

1040
00:59:10,693 --> 00:59:13,660
Okay, Mr. Hoffman,
esteemed colleagues,

1041
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:16,231
we want to extend
our warmest thanks to you

1042
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:19,201
for traveling so far
to meet with us today...

1043
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:21,903
Um, it's too much, though,
right, it's too formal?

1044
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,570
I had this perfect,
it was perfect,

1045
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:25,338
and now I can't
remember how I started it.

1046
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,276
I just think that we need
to get some sleep.

1047
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:32,780
You are going to nail
this presentation tomorrow.

1048
00:59:32,782 --> 00:59:35,349
This deal is dead if it
doesn't go well tomorrow.

1049
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:37,820
George, I am well aware.

1050
00:59:38,353 --> 00:59:40,554
We have both put
months of work into this,

1051
00:59:40,556 --> 00:59:43,159
and a few extra hours tonight
isn't going to save it.

1052
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:47,965
Okay? It's just going to make us
both tired and unable to focus.

1053
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:50,099
Okay, okay, you're right.

1054
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,602
Thank you. Sorry.

1055
00:59:54,872 --> 00:59:55,839
Good night.

1056
00:59:57,842 --> 00:59:59,310
If it goes well,
we could...

1057
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,844
there could be
a Modern Skate park downtown.

1058
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:03,013
George...

1059
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:04,814
sleep.

1060
01:00:08,586 --> 01:00:10,352
Did you like
"esteemed colleagues"

1061
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:11,588
because I could say
"honored colleagues..."

1062
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,756
George...

1063
01:00:13,524 --> 01:00:15,592
- I'm just saying it's an easy switch.
- Sleep.

1064
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,629
Sleep.

1065
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:23,034
Okay.

1066
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:26,805
- But you feel good about it, right?
- George, oh, my goodness!

1067
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:28,839
I love you.

1068
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:30,707
- I love you, too.
- Thanks for loving me.

1069
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:31,876
- [laughs]
- I know it's hard.

1070
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,880
[sighing]

1071
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:05,078
[sighs]

1072
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:18,126
[alarm ringing]

1073
01:01:27,068 --> 01:01:28,236
Mom?

1074
01:01:29,804 --> 01:01:30,972
Sally?

1075
01:01:32,774 --> 01:01:33,741
Dad?

1076
01:01:38,013 --> 01:01:39,214
Ahh!

1077
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:43,385
Mrs. Crowley.

1078
01:01:44,086 --> 01:01:45,718
What are you doing here?

1079
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,224
Mmm. I dropped the blacklist
a few days early.

1080
01:01:49,558 --> 01:01:52,025
Your father sounded desperate
on the phone.

1081
01:01:52,027 --> 01:01:55,163
And he promised to make me
some saffron risotto.

1082
01:01:55,165 --> 01:01:56,332
[chuckles]

1083
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,736
[cell phone rings]

1084
01:02:01,537 --> 01:02:02,671
Hello?

1085
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:06,142
Hello, Mom.
Why is Mrs. Crowley here?

1086
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:08,744
Your father thought it was gonna
be best for you to stay home.

1087
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:11,080
<i>He just wasn't sure
how Mr. Hoffman would feel</i>

1088
01:02:11,082 --> 01:02:13,048
with a kid running
around at the meeting.

1089
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,116
But I thought I was going
with you guys today.

1090
01:02:15,118 --> 01:02:17,019
Tommy, I'm sorry.

1091
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:19,390
<i>I... Maybe you can stop by
after the meeting, okay?</i>

1092
01:02:20,091 --> 01:02:21,724
I'm sorry, I have to go.

1093
01:02:22,193 --> 01:02:23,761
No, no, no...

1094
01:02:26,529 --> 01:02:27,864
That's too late.

1095
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:29,965
I'm toast.

1096
01:02:29,967 --> 01:02:31,700
[Buddy] <i>Toast?</i>

1097
01:02:31,702 --> 01:02:33,903
<i>No, that smells more
like creamed wheat.</i>

1098
01:02:33,905 --> 01:02:35,340
I don't think she's looking.

1099
01:02:35,606 --> 01:02:36,874
Okay, come on, let's go.

1100
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:02,268
[Alice] Hey, Tommy!

1101
01:03:06,005 --> 01:03:06,973
Hey, Buddy!

1102
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:10,910
[Buddy] Good morning, Alice.
Always a pleasure.

1103
01:03:12,545 --> 01:03:14,045
You ready for this?

1104
01:03:14,047 --> 01:03:15,780
As I'll ever be.

1105
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:17,950
All right, what tricks
are you gonna do?

1106
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:19,917
Did Sal give you pointers
last night?

1107
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:22,888
I don't know,
I don't have any tricks.

1108
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,424
Look, you gotta
have something.

1109
01:03:25,793 --> 01:03:27,725
- Wait, not even an ollie-to-manual?
- No.

1110
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:29,295
It's pretty simple, here,
let me show you how to do it.

1111
01:03:29,297 --> 01:03:30,562
Alice!

1112
01:03:30,564 --> 01:03:32,197
I don't want you to show me!

1113
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:34,032
I suck at skateboarding.

1114
01:03:34,034 --> 01:03:36,802
I get it, and everyone else
is better at it than I am.

1115
01:03:36,804 --> 01:03:38,637
Well, I didn't
mean it like that.

1116
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:41,207
It's fine, okay?

1117
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:44,445
This is my problem, and I
need to deal with it myself.

1118
01:03:46,881 --> 01:03:50,251
Fine, you wanna be by yourself
so bad, then be my guest.

1119
01:03:52,554 --> 01:03:54,188
Alice, I'm sorry, I...

1120
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:56,990
[Buddy] You know, I think I'm
gonna ride on ahead myself.

1121
01:03:56,992 --> 01:03:58,257
I'll see you there, Tommy.

1122
01:03:58,259 --> 01:03:59,861
[Tommy] You, too? Buddy?

1123
01:04:09,238 --> 01:04:11,138
How cute.

1124
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,040
Looks like the whole pack
is here except the leader.

1125
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:14,443
Excuse me?

1126
01:04:14,777 --> 01:04:16,878
I'm sorry, Alice.
I didn't mean to...

1127
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,015
Hey, I'm a lone wolf,
and you better watch yourself.

1128
01:04:25,788 --> 01:04:27,156
Let's get this over with.

1129
01:04:27,857 --> 01:04:28,858
[Buddy] Agreed.

1130
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,199
Hey, George.

1131
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,967
Mr. Hoffman's here.

1132
01:04:38,602 --> 01:04:39,569
Okay.

1133
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,875
Mr. Hoffman, esteemed
colleagues, friends...

1134
01:04:47,612 --> 01:04:49,913
[crowd booing and yelling]

1135
01:04:58,856 --> 01:05:01,757
Scooter! I'm glad
you could make it.

1136
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:03,859
For a minute there, I thought
you weren't gonna show,

1137
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:06,129
but from what I've seen, that
may have been the wiser choice.

1138
01:05:06,131 --> 01:05:08,031
Let's just get
this over with.

1139
01:05:08,033 --> 01:05:10,232
What's that? I don't
think they heard you.

1140
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:12,736
I said, let's just
get this over with.

1141
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:14,406
Oh. We're just
getting started.

1142
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:19,276
On Monday, I was riding down the
street, minding my own business,

1143
01:05:19,278 --> 01:05:23,049
when Tommy Schooner here, in a hurry
to get somewhere, bowled me over.

1144
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:24,650
[whistles]

1145
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:32,223
I never seen him coming, but seeing
how much of a skilled skater he is,

1146
01:05:32,225 --> 01:05:33,393
he had to see me.

1147
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:35,428
<i>He said to me...</i>

1148
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:37,695
Get out of my way,
you little pip-squeak.

1149
01:05:37,697 --> 01:05:39,898
"Get out of my way,
you pip-squeak."

1150
01:05:41,202 --> 01:05:42,401
I never said that.

1151
01:05:42,403 --> 01:05:44,303
Quiet, I'm telling a story.

1152
01:05:45,405 --> 01:05:48,840
<i>So there I was, afraid of
what this big bully...</i>

1153
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:50,109
[mumbles]

1154
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:52,614
...of a kid was
gonna do to me.

1155
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,048
Was he gonna take
my lunch money?

1156
01:05:59,053 --> 01:06:01,421
There wasn't school on Monday.
Why would you have lunch money?

1157
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:03,991
Was he gonna take
my beloved skateboard?

1158
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,461
[Tommy] <i>What would I do
with two skateboards?</i>

1159
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:09,997
Or was he just gonna beat me up and
leave me on the side of the street?

1160
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,967
[Tommy] <i>Not to mention, my dad
owns a skateboarding company.</i>

1161
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:16,236
I really have
no use for your board.

1162
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,238
You're really hung up
on that point, aren't you?

1163
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,974
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

1164
01:06:20,475 --> 01:06:22,909
No, instead, he said...

1165
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:24,844
I'm gonna humiliate you
in front of everybody.

1166
01:06:24,846 --> 01:06:27,046
...this Friday,
at the skate-off.

1167
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:29,185
[cheering]

1168
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:47,402
Wow, I really remember those
events happening differently.

1169
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:49,371
Hope I'm not
sleepwalking again.

1170
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:53,610
Mr. Hoffman, esteemed friends,
welcome, again, to Modern Skate.

1171
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:10,026
[cheering]

1172
01:07:18,203 --> 01:07:21,037
So here we are.
Today's the day.

1173
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,906
The gauntlet was thrown,
the challenge was accepted.

1174
01:07:23,908 --> 01:07:26,509
I feel like I represent
all little guys when I say,

1175
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:29,912
enough is enough,
and stand up to this bully.

1176
01:07:29,914 --> 01:07:32,181
I'm vastly outmatched
by his superior skill,

1177
01:07:32,183 --> 01:07:33,115
but I can only hope that...

1178
01:07:33,117 --> 01:07:34,318
Just go on with it already!

1179
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,320
Right, yeah.

1180
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:36,655
Sorry.

1181
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:38,657
Grip or graphic?

1182
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:40,157
Grip.

1183
01:07:50,402 --> 01:07:51,370
Grip it is.

1184
01:07:52,104 --> 01:07:53,473
You wanna go first or second?

1185
01:07:53,873 --> 01:07:55,340
Uh, you can go first.

1186
01:07:55,342 --> 01:07:58,377
My "superior" skills can wait
just a little bit longer.

1187
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:03,381
Okay, video is one thing,

1188
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:06,485
but let's see how it compares
to the real deal.

1189
01:08:06,487 --> 01:08:10,591
Now as you can see, Sally is
riding on the new Talon Mark IV.

1190
01:08:10,857 --> 01:08:12,157
Now this model
isn't even out yet,

1191
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,958
but I can assure you,

1192
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,596
it's going to blow the Mark
III numbers out of the water.

1193
01:08:16,598 --> 01:08:19,164
Now, our chief engineer,
Jerome Walker,

1194
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:21,134
can explain
the improvements we've made.

1195
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:22,804
Right on, thank you, George.

1196
01:08:23,104 --> 01:08:25,072
Sure, and in English, please.

1197
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:29,542
The Mark IV uses a new polycarbon
synthetic in the board

1198
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:31,444
which increases
the tensile strength

1199
01:08:31,446 --> 01:08:33,512
and decreases the mass
by an order of 25.

1200
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:35,283
- [George clears throat]
- But...

1201
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:39,654
In other words, we've made our
boards stronger and lighter.

1202
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:41,254
We've also increased
the coeffic...

1203
01:08:41,256 --> 01:08:43,658
[clears throat] The
slipperiness of the bearings,

1204
01:08:43,992 --> 01:08:46,796
making this the smoothest gliding
board that has ever been made.

1205
01:08:47,062 --> 01:08:49,364
It's like... It's like
you're riding on a cloud.

1206
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:51,466
- George.
- Thanks, Jerome.

1207
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,335
And we've already spoken
with our manufacturers,

1208
01:08:54,337 --> 01:08:57,172
and they're ready to increase
output to match demand.

1209
01:08:58,374 --> 01:08:59,342
Any questions?

1210
01:09:05,482 --> 01:09:07,248
Rules are as follows:

1211
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,787
each person has 30 seconds to
complete as many tricks as possible.

1212
01:09:11,087 --> 01:09:14,423
When finished, our panel of
judges will hold up their scores.

1213
01:09:14,924 --> 01:09:15,891
The highest score wins.

1214
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,561
Good luck.

1215
01:09:18,162 --> 01:09:19,228
You're gonna need it.

1216
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:21,062
Thanks.

1217
01:09:21,064 --> 01:09:22,264
You, too, Frankie.

1218
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,701
Start the clock!

1219
01:09:31,308 --> 01:09:33,443
[cheering]

1220
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,959
You can have the rest
of my time, Tommy.

1221
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:51,629
I don't think
I'm gonna need it.

1222
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,465
I give the rest of my time
to my opponent.

1223
01:09:54,467 --> 01:09:55,431
[applause]

1224
01:09:55,433 --> 01:09:57,367
[inaudible]

1225
01:09:57,369 --> 01:09:58,671
What's the score?

1226
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:01,540
I'd give it a six.
Six and a half.

1227
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,375
[cheering]

1228
01:10:08,547 --> 01:10:09,548
A 9.1?

1229
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,918
What routine
were you watching?

1230
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:15,254
All right, Tommy,
give him what he deserves.

1231
01:10:16,223 --> 01:10:17,724
So what's it gonna be, Tommy?

1232
01:10:18,057 --> 01:10:19,793
I hope your sister
gave you some good advice.

1233
01:10:20,727 --> 01:10:25,732
She did, actually, and she
said to do what I do best.

1234
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:27,767
Oh! I can't watch.

1235
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:30,336
And what I do best...

1236
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:34,239
isn't skateboarding, and I
stand no chance beating you.

1237
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:36,376
What I do best...

1238
01:10:38,345 --> 01:10:39,312
is this.

1239
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:45,351
[groaning]

1240
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:47,455
<i>Come on, Frankie!</i>

1241
01:10:48,322 --> 01:10:49,957
<i>Sally's never gonna respect
moves like that.</i>

1242
01:10:51,292 --> 01:10:53,693
That's what I do best.

1243
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,562
And if you don't stop bullying
these kids in this neighborhood,

1244
01:10:56,564 --> 01:11:00,401
I'm gonna make sure everyone
in our school sees that video.

1245
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:03,703
And everybody knows
that I'm not a great skater,

1246
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:06,241
and I realize I have
nothing to lose,

1247
01:11:06,442 --> 01:11:10,445
but you just proved how great
of a skateboarder you are,

1248
01:11:10,447 --> 01:11:12,712
and when this video comes out,

1249
01:11:12,714 --> 01:11:15,350
and that cute little
"eek" sound you make...

1250
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,587
Well, the bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

1251
01:11:19,722 --> 01:11:23,359
Look, Tommy, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

1252
01:11:24,294 --> 01:11:25,260
Really?

1253
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:29,530
Yeah, I mean,
your family is super cool.

1254
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:31,432
Your dad makes skateboards,
that's awesome.

1255
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:32,633
And your sister...

1256
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:35,571
Wait, you do have
a crush on my sister.

1257
01:11:35,573 --> 01:11:37,373
What? No.

1258
01:11:37,674 --> 01:11:38,841
Ugh!

1259
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,844
Gross, you do!

1260
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,243
- Ugh!
- Shut up, man!

1261
01:11:42,245 --> 01:11:44,646
[scoffs]
Man, it's cool.

1262
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:48,418
Just be a little nicer to me, and
I'll put in a few good words.

1263
01:11:49,186 --> 01:11:51,755
Come on, is someone gonna skate?
I've got stuff to do!

1264
01:11:52,691 --> 01:11:56,360
Hey, man, I'm sorry about
everything and here...

1265
01:12:01,766 --> 01:12:04,502
I yield the rest of my time.

1266
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,403
Phew.

1267
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:20,385
A 2.0? What competition
were you watching?

1268
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,753
Right?

1269
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,990
Let me know when the guy starts
judging dog shows, I'm in.

1270
01:12:26,391 --> 01:12:31,228
I officially declare Frankie,
winner of today's skate-off.

1271
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,364
[cheering]

1272
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:43,542
[all chanting] Frankie! Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!

1273
01:12:52,586 --> 01:12:54,719
So that's who we are
as a company,

1274
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:59,291
and we hope that you'll see us
as a valuable investment,

1275
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:03,029
and agree to partner with us as we
go to the next level, together.

1276
01:13:03,764 --> 01:13:05,633
Mr. Schooner, um...

1277
01:13:06,701 --> 01:13:09,402
thank you very much for the
presentation, and for your hospitality.

1278
01:13:10,204 --> 01:13:11,439
Uh...

1279
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,407
Unfortunately, I cannot
invest in your company.

1280
01:13:16,444 --> 01:13:19,013
Oh, uh... [clears throat]
Do you mind if I ask why?

1281
01:13:19,614 --> 01:13:20,581
Quite simply...

1282
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:24,052
there's just nothing
special about it.

1283
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:25,887
I mean, you have
a lovely family,

1284
01:13:26,354 --> 01:13:27,653
and your product seems
to be very good,

1285
01:13:27,655 --> 01:13:29,791
and your daughter
is exceptionally talented,

1286
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:31,793
but I've seen this all before.

1287
01:13:33,629 --> 01:13:36,665
I was really hoping to witness
something unique here today.

1288
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:41,037
I understand.

1289
01:13:41,605 --> 01:13:43,772
Uh, would you at least
stay for lunch?

1290
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,509
It'll be ready soon,
and we've got so much food.

1291
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,980
I appreciate the offer. Uh...

1292
01:13:52,716 --> 01:13:54,484
Sure. We can stay for lunch.

1293
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:57,854
Okay, great, lunch it is.

1294
01:14:03,493 --> 01:14:04,662
You lost.

1295
01:14:05,596 --> 01:14:09,098
I know, the skate-off at least.
And hopefully, not a friend.

1296
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:13,602
I was being a jerk back
there, and I was stressed,

1297
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:15,471
and I knew you were
trying to help,

1298
01:14:16,574 --> 01:14:19,710
but took my stress out on you, and
I've just gotta stop doing that.

1299
01:14:20,678 --> 01:14:21,979
We cool?

1300
01:14:24,515 --> 01:14:27,551
I left my 50-millimeter lens
at your house, so...

1301
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:29,654
I guess we're cool.

1302
01:14:31,355 --> 01:14:32,822
Any news from Sally
on the presentation?

1303
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:34,726
Oh. Yeah, let me check.

1304
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:41,666
[text alert rings]

1305
01:14:57,349 --> 01:14:58,517
- [cell phone beeps]
- Oh, man.

1306
01:14:59,485 --> 01:15:01,485
It's not going good.

1307
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:03,956
I knew I should've gone to the
meeting, my talents are wasted here.

1308
01:15:04,257 --> 01:15:05,858
That's not good,
what was wrong?

1309
01:15:06,927 --> 01:15:09,495
They wanted something unique.

1310
01:15:09,696 --> 01:15:12,329
How about a skateboard
wrapped in bacon?

1311
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:14,267
Bet you've never seen
one of those before.

1312
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,270
Come on!

1313
01:15:16,503 --> 01:15:17,769
[Alice] Where are we going?

1314
01:15:17,771 --> 01:15:19,740
Modern headquarters!
I have an idea!

1315
01:15:22,777 --> 01:15:24,509
What's your idea?

1316
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:26,613
I'm gonna give
them something "unique."

1317
01:15:27,548 --> 01:15:28,716
Whoa, wait!

1318
01:15:33,353 --> 01:15:35,690
<i>Stop!</i>

1319
01:15:50,572 --> 01:15:53,842
[chuckles]
That was awesome!

1320
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:55,976
You are getting better.

1321
01:15:55,978 --> 01:15:58,812
I give that a 20! Paws down!

1322
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:01,650
Maybe I should've tried a move
back there, against Frankie, huh?

1323
01:16:02,785 --> 01:16:04,853
Well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

1324
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:06,688
[chuckles] Oh.
We gotta get to Modern.

1325
01:16:11,762 --> 01:16:13,896
[inaudible]

1326
01:16:27,343 --> 01:16:28,978
George, you know what, we
actually misjudged the time,

1327
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,478
we have to get
to another meeting.

1328
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,846
Oh, are you sure? It's just
gonna be a few minutes.

1329
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:33,016
No, no, it's fine.

1330
01:16:36,854 --> 01:16:39,889
When we get there, we gotta
assess the situation, okay?

1331
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:42,958
We can't just be two kids and a dog
barging into an important meeting.

1332
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,627
You got it, chief!

1333
01:16:44,962 --> 01:16:46,864
Alice, I'm gonna need
your help with the TV.

1334
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:53,637
That smell. It's...
It's incredible!

1335
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:55,773
Sorry, Tommy,
no time to waste!

1336
01:16:56,507 --> 01:16:57,775
Buddy, wait!

1337
01:17:02,513 --> 01:17:04,447
- We do have to go, thank you, though.
- Okay.

1338
01:17:04,449 --> 01:17:05,782
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you, Mr. Hoffman, thank you for your time.

1339
01:17:05,784 --> 01:17:06,751
Of course.

1340
01:17:07,019 --> 01:17:08,186
[Tommy] Buddy!

1341
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,148
Oh!

1342
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:09,648
- Uh... We're very sorry.
- So sorry!

1343
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,953
[laughing] Uh, we are sorry.

1344
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:13,721
Alice?

1345
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,926
Oh. Sorry about the mess.

1346
01:18:46,657 --> 01:18:50,225
I'm Tommy Schooner, I'm head
of special marketing projects,

1347
01:18:50,227 --> 01:18:53,464
and I'm sure you've already
met Buddy Schooner,

1348
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:55,765
the other face
of Modern Skate.

1349
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:58,701
[Buddy] Pleasure!

1350
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:02,171
You wanted something unique, and
I give you, Buddy and Sally,

1351
01:19:02,173 --> 01:19:07,744
the family skateboarding
human-dog team.

1352
01:19:09,747 --> 01:19:11,782
We're still
work-shopping the name.

1353
01:19:17,122 --> 01:19:17,888
Now that...

1354
01:19:20,825 --> 01:19:22,027
is something unique.

1355
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:25,464
A skateboarding dog?

1356
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:27,966
It's brilliant.

1357
01:19:31,003 --> 01:19:31,970
Mr. Schooner...

1358
01:19:33,706 --> 01:19:35,341
I'm gonna invest
in your company.

1359
01:19:36,642 --> 01:19:37,708
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1360
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:38,910
Congratulations.

1361
01:19:39,746 --> 01:19:41,946
- Thank you, Mr. Hoffman, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1362
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:43,549
Sorry about your face.

1363
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,417
Thanks. Thanks, Bill.

1364
01:19:46,219 --> 01:19:48,219
I do think the food's
still okay if we're careful.

1365
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:50,288
- No, we're fine.
- Or we could just order pizza.

1366
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,091
We'll order pizza.

1367
01:19:52,093 --> 01:19:53,993
Bill, can we get some...
Put it on the company card.

1368
01:19:56,029 --> 01:19:58,365
[applause]

1369
01:20:06,673 --> 01:20:09,842
Great job, everybody. Now,
less hugging, more eating.

1370
01:20:09,844 --> 01:20:11,344
Well, it was
certainly a pleasure

1371
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:13,612
to meet you and your lovely
family, Mr. Schooner.

1372
01:20:13,614 --> 01:20:15,915
Hopefully, one day, you'll get out
to Los Angeles so you can meet mine.

1373
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:17,649
We'd be happy to.

1374
01:20:17,651 --> 01:20:20,087
Thanks again for the opportunity.
You won't regret it.

1375
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:22,856
I know I won't. We're gonna
make a lot of money together.

1376
01:20:22,858 --> 01:20:24,124
Great.

1377
01:20:24,126 --> 01:20:25,758
Come on, honey,
let's show Mr. Hoffman out.

1378
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,227
Sounds good. Gentlemen.

1379
01:20:30,298 --> 01:20:32,598
Tommy Schooner,
I owe you an apology.

1380
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,836
I never knew you had such
a talent for filmmaking.

1381
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:38,306
Thanks, and it's okay.

1382
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,674
No. It was easy for me
to connect with your sister

1383
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:43,311
because we both like
the same things.

1384
01:20:44,546 --> 01:20:47,148
But I should've spent more time getting
to know you and your interests,

1385
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:49,316
not just going to
the skate park with you

1386
01:20:49,318 --> 01:20:51,554
because you started
being interested in mine.

1387
01:20:52,622 --> 01:20:55,990
Thanks, Dad, and I know you've
had a lot on your plate.

1388
01:20:55,992 --> 01:20:58,326
No, that's no excuse,
you're my son.

1389
01:20:58,328 --> 01:21:00,429
I love you and I've
always got time for you.

1390
01:21:01,297 --> 01:21:03,030
Plus, that video is amazing!

1391
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:04,534
You have more of those?

1392
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:09,905
Well, Alice and I did make a short
film about a ghost in our basement.

1393
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:11,408
Oh, what's it called?

1394
01:21:12,009 --> 01:21:13,809
- <i>The Ghost in the Basement.</i>
- [laughs]

1395
01:21:13,811 --> 01:21:15,277
Of course it is, all right.

1396
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:17,314
What did we know?
We were ten.

1397
01:21:17,781 --> 01:21:19,983
Okay, I'll tell you what.
[clears throat]

1398
01:21:20,684 --> 01:21:23,419
When we get home tonight, we'll
watch <i>The Ghost in the Basement.</i>

1399
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:26,189
And then if you want,
spend the summer here,

1400
01:21:26,723 --> 01:21:28,159
making videos
for the campaign.

1401
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,860
You gave yourself a title, the
least I can do is give you a desk.

1402
01:21:31,862 --> 01:21:34,232
- Sound good?
- Sounds great!

1403
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:38,868
Now be honest,
do you like the quinoa?

1404
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:41,105
Ugh. No, I've been flushing it down
the toilet for about a week...

1405
01:21:41,107 --> 01:21:42,206
Thank you.

1406
01:21:42,408 --> 01:21:44,140
[Buddy] I see
you guys watching me.

1407
01:21:44,142 --> 01:21:45,543
I'm always in the spotlight.

1408
01:21:46,212 --> 01:21:47,613
Nice job with the video.

1409
01:21:48,114 --> 01:21:49,981
Thanks.

1410
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:51,516
I hope you don't mind sharing
the spotlight with a dog.

1411
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:52,850
It's not just any dog.

1412
01:21:52,852 --> 01:21:55,621
It's the best skateboarding
dog in the whole world.

1413
01:21:55,988 --> 01:21:59,823
[Buddy] Go ahead, shower me with compliments,
but I still won't work on weekends.

1414
01:21:59,825 --> 01:22:00,993
So how'd your skate-off go?

1415
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,462
Okay. I lost.

1416
01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:06,999
- There's no surprise there.
- Nope.

1417
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:08,934
Did you attempt any tricks?

1418
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:14,139
No. I did take your advice,
and kind of feel bad about it.

1419
01:22:14,141 --> 01:22:15,307
How so?

1420
01:22:17,811 --> 01:22:19,844
It's wrong to bully someone,

1421
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:22,383
even though you're trying to
get him to stop bullying you.

1422
01:22:23,217 --> 01:22:24,383
Correct.

1423
01:22:24,385 --> 01:22:26,386
Two wrongs don't
make a right.

1424
01:22:26,753 --> 01:22:30,089
[Buddy] Two wrongs don't make
a right, but three lefts do!

1425
01:22:31,192 --> 01:22:33,493
Do you think you could
give me a hand with something?

1426
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,728
Of course.

1427
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:36,163
Thanks.

1428
01:22:38,732 --> 01:22:40,569
[Buddy] Oh, yeah,
I'm shredding!

1429
01:22:41,303 --> 01:22:42,603
Check it out!

1430
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,375
Hey, Frankie!

1431
01:22:48,075 --> 01:22:49,409
Oh. Hey, Scoot...

1432
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:50,978
I mean, Schooner.

1433
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,349
Come to say hi?

1434
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:57,984
Yeah, and to apologize.

1435
01:22:57,986 --> 01:23:01,022
Kind of a bully move I pulled
back there, using the video.

1436
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:06,327
[beeps]

1437
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:08,497
- We good?
- Yeah, we good.

1438
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,933
Oh, and...
someone's here to see you.

1439
01:23:12,935 --> 01:23:14,135
Huh?

1440
01:23:15,506 --> 01:23:16,504
Sa...

1441
01:23:16,506 --> 01:23:17,538
Hey, Frankie.

1442
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,275
Sally Schooner?

1443
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:21,409
It's good to see you again.

1444
01:23:21,411 --> 01:23:23,513
I heard you won some sort of
amateur skate competition today?

1445
01:23:23,947 --> 01:23:26,280
Yup, I guess I did.

1446
01:23:26,282 --> 01:23:29,252
Well, I just wanna say
congratulations, and give you this.

1447
01:23:31,921 --> 01:23:33,356
See you around, Frankie.

1448
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:39,193
Hey, thanks for
your help today.

1449
01:23:39,195 --> 01:23:41,163
You did a great job pretending
to flirt with Frankie.

1450
01:23:41,165 --> 01:23:42,432
Who said I was pretending?

1451
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:45,867
Ugh. Gross, no, Frankie?

1452
01:23:45,869 --> 01:23:48,170
[chuckles] What?
He's kind of cute.

1453
01:23:48,172 --> 01:23:50,240
Ugh. I can't,
I'm gonna be sick.

1454
01:23:57,849 --> 01:23:59,215
You coming, dear?

1455
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:00,316
We're about to watch
<i>Ghost in the Basement.</i>

1456
01:24:00,318 --> 01:24:02,151
In the basement.

1457
01:24:02,153 --> 01:24:04,355
I'm coming, I'm coming.
All right, who wants popcorn?

1458
01:24:04,357 --> 01:24:08,092
Uh, I think everybody. So,
Tommy, how long is this movie?

1459
01:24:08,426 --> 01:24:10,529
It's about... four hours.

1460
01:24:11,963 --> 01:24:13,464
Okay, wow.

1461
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:15,466
- No. He's kidding, it's like 12 minutes.
- [laughs]

1462
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:18,102
Thank goodness, because I did not
make enough popcorn for that.

1463
01:24:18,104 --> 01:24:22,107
All right, I guess it's time to
hit it on <i>Ghost in the Basement.</i>

1464
01:24:23,209 --> 01:24:24,376
And...

1465
01:24:24,877 --> 01:24:26,110
Action!

1466
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:51,672
And cut!

1467
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:53,239
Nice.

1468
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:55,040
All right,
that work for you guys?

1469
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:56,474
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah, that works for us.

1470
01:24:56,476 --> 01:24:58,444
Then that's the last shot
before lunch.

1471
01:24:58,446 --> 01:24:59,979
- Good!
- Great!

1472
01:24:59,981 --> 01:25:01,913
Hey, Sally, Buddy, why don't
you guys come over here?

1473
01:25:01,915 --> 01:25:03,517
I wanna get a nice group photo
of all of us for the website.

1474
01:25:03,519 --> 01:25:05,451
Good idea, Ma Schooner.

1475
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:07,888
Let's make sure the Modern
banner's in the picture.

1476
01:25:08,323 --> 01:25:10,692
There we go... [clears
throat] all right.

1477
01:25:16,532 --> 01:25:18,634
Hold the phone.
Do I smell...

1478
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:20,567
[sniffs]

1479
01:25:20,569 --> 01:25:23,305
Oh, my gosh.
That smells like...

1480
01:25:23,539 --> 01:25:25,807
Oh, it can't be.
Oh, it is!

1481
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:28,276
[inaudible]

1482
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:35,683
Oh, my gosh, it's steak!

1483
01:25:35,685 --> 01:25:38,218
Oh, come on, guys, I'm being
good, take the picture.

1484
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,556
Hurry up, I'm so hungry!

1485
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:43,258
Oh, man, I can't wait!

1486
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,829
- Take the picture.
- [Buddy] Come on, guys, I'm being good.

1487
01:25:46,262 --> 01:25:47,330
I'm a good boy!

1488
01:25:48,665 --> 01:25:49,932
[camera shutter clicks]

1489
01:26:14,291 --> 01:26:17,495
[announcer
speaking indistinctly]

1490
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:20,932
[announcer] <i>Please
welcome Tony Hawk!</i>

1491
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:24,467
- Hey, what's up, George?
- Hey, man.

1492
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:26,603
- Good to see you!
- You, too. Thanks for coming out.

1493
01:26:26,605 --> 01:26:29,439
Congrats on taking Modern
Skate global, that's huge.

1494
01:26:29,441 --> 01:26:32,208
Yeah, dude, well, we couldn't
have done it without you.

1495
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,010
- Seriously, thanks, man.
- See you, man.

1496
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:35,346
Yeah, get back to your stuff.

1497
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:40,986
[indistinct chatter]

1498
01:27:02,408 --> 01:27:05,312
Oh, man. I just had
the craziest dream.

1499
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,514
Wouldn't it be cool
if I could snowboard?

1500
