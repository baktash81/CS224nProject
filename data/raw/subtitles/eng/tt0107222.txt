How many were there?

180
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,581
Three.

181
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,874
No, four.

182
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,794
Which is it?
Three or four?

183
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,800
I don't remember.

184
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,969
Do you remember
their names?

185
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,516
Let's see now,
you go out with a guy,

186
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,852
and you take his friends
along for the ride

187
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,562
and you don't know his name?

188
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,231
We didn't go for a ride.

189
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,067
We stayed at the house.

190
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,197
Dressed like that?

191
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,073
Why did you go
home with them?

192
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:03,327
I said, "why did you
go home with them?

193
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,330
Because I know them.

194
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,249
Obviously, you didn't
know them well enough.

195
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,334
Address?

196
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,714
I already gave you
their address.

197
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,716
Speak up, miss,
I can't hear you!

198
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,593
I already gave you
their address!

199
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:24,181
Your address.
I want your address.

200
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,020
What's the difference?

201
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,188
Does it really matter?

202
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,235
You won't be able
to keep 'em in jail.

203
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,736
Will you?

204
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,529
Off the record?

205
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,949
Not the way
you're dressed.

206
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,035
Why are you on their side?

207
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,999
What did I do
that makes me wrong?

208
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,541
[Vickie] Miss?

209
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,336
If you press charges
against these men,

210
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,090
the lawyers are gonna
be a lot harder on you
than sgt. Harris.

211
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,721
You still wanna
press charges?

212
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,348
I've already
been violated.

213
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,602
Why do I need to be
violated by you?

214
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,583
[Woman] I went inside
just to see a friend.

215
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,253
One minute we're talking,

216
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,215
the next minute, four guys
are tearing my clothes off.

217
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,887
They hurt me.

218
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,056
My friends raped me.

219
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,146
[Footsteps]

220
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,316
There's two of them now.

221
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,401
The other three
must be upstairs.

222
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,361
Okay.

223
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,155
You stay here.

224
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,157
I'll be right back.

225
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,081
Hey! It's Maria!

226
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,959
And she brought
a friend this time.

227
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,170
Ooh, hoo!

228
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:21,465
She looks better
than you, Maria.

229
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,634
Ooh, yeah!

230
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,555
You broke my nose, bitch!

231
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,733
Hey, baby.
You come to party?

232
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,735
Oh, I sure did.

233
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,905
[Snorting]

234
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,956
Come on, that's it.
Come on in.

235
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,749
You swing at me
and I'll cut you.

236
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,751
I swear I'll cut you.
Drop it!

237
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,547
Come on.

238
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,298
Good girl.

239

I got something to tell you.

After.

240

Right now, you just
shut your mouth.

It's pretty important.

After.

242
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,726

Yeah?

244
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,979
Yeah.

245
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,231
I'm gonna take
from you, baby.

246
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,025
What are you gonna take?

247
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,610
Everything you got.

248
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,365
Why don't you start with this?

249
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,329
Pick up the phone.

250
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,374
Pick it up!

251
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,092
Please don't kill me.

Dial 9-1-1.

254
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,083
[Al] Hey, where were you?
I was worried about you.

255
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,127
I called. Nobody was home.

256
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,881
How worried were you?

257
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,884
All this garlic, and you still
smell like a cheap whore.

258
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,802
Well, I worked vice
tonight, you know?

259
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,180
Drove around for seven hours
picking up two-bit hookers.

260

What do you want me to do,
smell like an altar boy?

I wasn't doin' anything.

262
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,854
You know, I came home
like a good little boy.

I've given you
one last chance.

264

You blow it,
I don't know what I'll do.

265

I don't wanna
find out.

No, you don't.
Wipe the lipstick off your face.

Oh, honey, you know
how those hookers are.

You know, all that shit
all over their faces.

269
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,957
Hey, I spoke
with the captain today.

270

He's still pretty hot.

271
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,298
I tried to
smooth things out.

272
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,386
What the hell
did I do wrong?

273
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,138
You know, you weren't supposed
to get in the limousine.

274
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,640
You weren't
supposed to do that.

275
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,017
I don't deserve
to be off this case.

276
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,477
I can push it along.

I don't know.

00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,565
He thinks you're making
it too personal.

Well, it is personal.

vickie, you know?

to prove it every day.

a nice gesture,

help me out,

time for the next parole review.

If the people on the outside are
anything like those two cops...

I'm better off in here.

335

say at this time.

of my brother.

become my fuckin' problem?!

Hey, listen, Holmes, you know,
I've been there for you.

343

No, no, you've been
there for yourself.

Your shipment
wasn't delayed, man.

345
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,201
You lost it.

Hey, that's not
what I told you?

the shipment.

That ain't
what I heard.

have stories, huh?

I heard you need
a replacement fast.

Sold! To the lucky Colombian
in the thrift shop suit.

364
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,244
Now get
the man's stash

365
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,372
and save his ass from
the powerful hand of the mooch.

366
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,416
You don't wanna beg
for your life, Salvador.

367
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,959
I mean, what'd
you guys do, huh?

368
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,711
Did you have to
kiss his ass

369
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,213
so he wouldn't
pull the trigger? [Laughs]

This is your case.

The Colombian cowboys
are tryin' to make up
for that lost shipment.

390
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,629
There's a war out there
and there's bodies all over.

Who cares if these people
kill each other?

I care! A life is a life!
Good or bad.

The less blood on the pavement,
the more I sleep.

My phone's been ringing

00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,435
Then why is he coming out
of the emergency room

446

and you're dressed as if
you're going to noon tea?

showed your I.D.

you showing a badge.

intent, to kill?

go to the park. No, no,
don't go to the park!

Last time you went to the park,
you shot a guy in his leg.

Well,
the doll sure didn't.

If he took care of me the way
he takes care of that car...

527
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,121
I'd be set.

528
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,624
I better get outta here
before the captain catches me.

529
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,292
What has he
got you doin'?

530
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,710
Told me to take
the afternoon,

531
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,754
go to the beach,
go to the park.

532
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,298
The park?
Don't go to the park.

533
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,343
Remember what happened
the last time?

534
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,261
I know.

535
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,139
Lock this up for me.
<b></b>
Okay.

536
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,350
I'll get it later.
<b></b>
Take care.

537
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,568
[Splash]

538
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,126
Boo!

539
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:07,723
[Both laughing]

540
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,395
What are you
doin' here?

541
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,522
I used to live here!

542
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,398
Vickie!

543
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,608
Vickie! Come here!

544
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,193
No, you come here.

545
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,403
I don't understand
this woman.

546
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,863
What the hell's
the difference?

547
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,865
You got caught anyway.

548
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,533
[Laughing]

549
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:31,038
You jerk!
[Laughs]

550
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,137
[Al] Honey, it's
not what you think!

551
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,556
It's worse than
what I think.

552
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,476
Is this what you want?
Huh? Is it?

553
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,436
Look, it's not
what you think!

554
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,188
Not my car.

555
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,316
It's ours.

556
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,986
What are you, nuts?
What are you doin'?

557
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:07,366
No, not my car!

558
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,327
No, no,
no, no, not my car!

559
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,670
Bitch! Fuck! Damn it!

560
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,725
Never know what's gonna
happen when you wake up

561
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,603
in the morning, huh?

562
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,522
Hey, uh...
Give you a call?

563
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,608
No. But have a good life.

564
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,969
[Woman]
♪ when the dream comes down ♪

565
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,722
♪ on this blackened town ♪

566
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,767
♪ the sun has gone... ♪

567
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,645
You put his car on fire.

568
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:03,357
Stewart,
I like your style.

569
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,858
The lowlife
deserved it.

570
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,777
Hey,
I'm on your side.

571
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:10,572
I'm only sayin' I wish I was
there for the fireworks.

572
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,409
It was better than any
4th of July I remember.

573
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,789
Listen...
I've got a guest room.

574
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,083
Well, it's not
really a guest room,

575
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,418
but it's a nice,
clean place,

576
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,087
and it's got a bed.

577
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,756
You can hang up
your clothes and...

578
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,883
You're welcome to it.

579
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:33,095
Thanks.
I'll think about it.

580
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,765
How about
the Colombian cowboys?

581
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,434
Hey, slow down.

582
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,187
You break
Philly the pig's wrist.

583
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,898
You almost blind him
by putting out his left eye.

584
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,401
You blow up your
boyfriend's car--
<b></b>
ex!

585
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,110
Ex-boyfriend's car,

586
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:52,280
and now you want me to send you
out to chase a lunatic

587
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,741
who threw you out
of a moving limousine.
<b></b>
Yeah.

588
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,618
We'll think about it
in the morning.

589
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,788
Now how about that room
for a nice night's sleep?

590
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,707
I think I have
a place.

591
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:04,459
If it doesn't work out,
can I call you?

592
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,004
Anytime.

593
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,595
Anytime, kid.

594
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,773
Not bad.

595
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,068
Not bad,
but you're still shy.

596
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,445
It's not all here.

597
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,906
I still got a few days
before the week's out.

598
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,410
Don't go loading no gun
for my head yet, mooch, huh?

599
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,829
It's not me gonna be
loading the gun.

600
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:46,418
I still got a few plays left.
I get it any way I have to.

601
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,169
No more junk.

602
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,380
The word on the street is
that I authorized this sweep.

603
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:53,800
The streets lie.

604
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,635
Yeah, in the streets
they know no truths.

605
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,764
What they do know is,
they are a lot of dead bodies

606
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,433
laying out there,
and I have their junk.

607
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,352
This doesn't make me
look very honorable.

608
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,896
You work for me.

609
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,441
If you make a hit,
it's as if I made the hit.

610
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,278
You know, baby,
we don't need them.

611
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,407
[Laughs]
Oh, we don't need them.

612
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,161
What you gonna do, huh?

613
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,164
Go door-to-door personally
like a fuckin' avon lady?

614
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,917
You idiot, huh?
You second class citizen.

615
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,919
You lowlife degenerate

616
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,171
who should have been left
in the old country

617
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:34,800
under a cow pullin'
on its tits.

618
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,426
Pullin' the leche,

619
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,220
and squeezin' the nipples.

620
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,431
I told you I'd get
the shit back.

621
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,141
I got it, didn't I?

622
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,769
Half,
you piece of shit!

623
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,020
Half.
You're halfway home.

624
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,940
You know you're gonna
get the rest.

625
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,734
You listen to me,
you fuckin' cockroach,

626
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,947
I don't care how you do it,
you and your buddy here, huh?
Mr. Spontaneous.

627
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,658
But you get the rest

628
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,202
and you leave the other
suppliers alone.

629
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,037
Okay.

630
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,249
Okay.

631
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,087
[Man] Will you stop
working already?

632
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,172
You're doing the work of
tomorrow morning's shift.

633
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,758
Papa, it's just
in my nature.

634
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,386
Sweetheart, about what
you were talking about...

635
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,346
Would you stop
it already?

636
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,347
[Vickie] Hello?

637
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,932
You didn't
lock the door?

638
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,226
No. Vickie! What
are you doing here?

639
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,228
How'd you know
where to find me?

640
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,814
Got your address off the police
report. You work here?

641
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,899
No,
she owns the place.

642
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,486
Papa, this is detective Stewart
of the LAPD. Remember?

643
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,281
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Gonzales.

644
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:43,952
My father was Mr. Gonzales.
I'm Nick.

645
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,540
Bullshit with the formalities.
Come on, let's have a drink.

646
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,002
That's my papa.

647
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,887
I used to have an old
friend that used to say,

648
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,930
"after a hard day's work,

649
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,891
"there's nothing like
a good drink."

650
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:06,892
Who said that?

651
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,770
Me! [Laughs]

652
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,983
My daughter,
she's all I have left.

653
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,818
Her, and this business.

654
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,113
When I heard what those animals
did, I wanted to...

655
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,741
But I believe
in justice.

656
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,786
I just want her to come home
and live with me, that's all.

657
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,539
Maybe talk some
sense into her--
<b></b>
papa, don't start!

658
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,249
Hey, just for
a few months, huh?

659
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:32,834
Just till after the trial.

660
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,212
I haven't lived at home
since I was 18.

661
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,546
Hey,
it'll be fun, huh?

662
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,048
It'll be fun for you.

663
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,841
You sound just
like your mother,

664
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,468
may she rest
in peace.

665
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,428
I might have a solution
that'll make you both happy.

666
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,473
Talk some sense into him.
<b></b>
Tell her I'm right.

667
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,642
You're afraid of her
living alone, right?

668
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,936
Wouldn't you be?

669
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,103
Absolutely.

670
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,647
You see?

671
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,065
So if she wasn't
living alone,

672
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,234
she could live on
her own, right?

673
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:00,237
All I want her
to be is happy.

674
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,072
She's suffered enough.

675
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:05,075
And it would make
me happy to stay.

676
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,420
I just got off
the phone with my father.

677
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,089
How is he?

678
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,216
He sends his love.

679
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,260
And that's
from him, too.

680
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,553
He says stay as
long as you like.

681
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,888
And so do I.

682
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,098
Thanks.

683
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,977
You sleep all right?

684
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,938
Yeah.

685
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,983
It was great.

686
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,318
It's the first time
I've slept in years

687
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,531
without worrying if I'd wake up
and not find al there.

688
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,992
God, I was so stupid.

689
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,994
We're all stupid
when we love.

690
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,414
That's it.

691
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,917
It's over with.

692
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,043
We'll see.

693
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,881
No, that's it.

694
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,466
God, I hope that's it.

695
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,135
Me too.

696
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,471
Do you have
anybody special?

697
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,889
Nope.

698
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,183
I gave up looking
a long time ago.

699
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,436
If it happens,
it happens.

700
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,770
[Sighs]

701
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,899
I'm done with the bar scenes,
the nightclubs...

702
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,943
I'm over it.

703
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,070
You have to
work today?

704
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:27,073
No.
Finally a day off.

705
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,742
Come on.
<b></b>
Where are we going?

706
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,952
Let's get dressed.

707
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,381
You're a victim only
because you don't know how

708
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,175
to defend yourself.

709
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,600
Crime, murders, rape.

710
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,686
Even gunfire's
a common occurrence

711
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,396
in today's neighborhoods.

712
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,150
You have two main defenses
we're here to learn today.

713
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:06,196
Number one is your
intelligence and observation.

714
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,114
Stay out of unlit
parking lots.

715
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,034
Lock your
windows and doors.

716
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,953
Use your common sense
and be smart.

717
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,039
Number two is knowing
your strength

718
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,125
and your attacker's
weaknesses.

719
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,002
Just because
you're small,

720
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,713
doesn't mean you
don't have strength.

721
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,632
Tom.

722
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:29,302
The attacker in most cases
grabs you from behind.

723
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,390
He does this so you
can't see his face.

724
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,853
A rolled up magazine is
a great weapon on the street.

725
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,524
I hear you're available.

726
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,080
I'll see you next week.

727
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,665
Don't forget,
tell your friends.

728
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:01,209
It's free, compliments of
your local police department.

729
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,255
You know, you sound
just like fluffy,
the crimestopper dog.

730
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,340
"Compliments of your
local police department."

731
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,426
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf!

732
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,761
Are you making fun of me?

733
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,097
I only make fun
of people I like.

734
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,099
You wanna get
a cup of coffee?

735
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,268
Why?

736
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,021
Since you don't
have a boyfriend...

737
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,106
Word travels fast.

738
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,191
Like fire.

739
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,485
Every time I see you,
you ask me out.

740
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,904
If I was going out
with someone like you

741
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,614
I wouldn't even look
at another girl.

742
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,241
Oh, spare me, Tom.

743
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,617
What, you don't
believe me?

744
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:38,121
I just want an original
line once from a guy.

745
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,998
All set?
<b></b>
Ready?

746
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,333
Hi! Tom. I'm vickie's
new boyfriend.

747
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,293
[Chuckles]

748
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,669
That's original.

749
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,087
Maria, this is
detective Tom Martin.

750
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,131
Tom and I went through
the academy together.

751
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,467
Yeah, vickie's always been
lookin' for a big brother,

752
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,177
and I've been
lookin' for a date.

753
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,512
Well, maybe now you
can both have your way.

754
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,181
I've got some
things to do.

755
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:59,267
Should I drop you at the house,
or do you wanna come along?

756
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,229
Or, I could drop
you off at the house,
after coffee.

757
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,647
Will you be
all right?

758
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,066
I'll be fine.
Nice meeting you.

759
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,610
Nice meeting you, too.

760
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:12,780
Have her home by 11 o'clock
or I'm callin' the cops.

761
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,241
Coffee?

762
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,160
After the fight.

763
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,411
What fight?

764
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,321
What was that
all about?

765
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,282
How about dinner
instead of just coffee?
<b></b>
Why?

766
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,159
I just won
a hundred bucks.

767
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,370
You didn't have to get
your face beaten in.

768
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,331
I don't eat
that much.

769
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,833
You sure you have
the energy for dinner?

770
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,418
Absolutely.

771
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,962
I'm gonna make this a night
you'll never forget.

772
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,715
I know just
the right place.

773
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,145
[Woman] Enjoy your dinner.

774
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,689
[Tom] So why'd you stay
with him so long?

775
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,567
[Vickie] I'll probably spend
a long time on that one.

776
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,403
Let's leave it
for my therapist.

777
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:01,491
Seven years off and on...
That's a long time.

778
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:04,035
We used to laugh a lot.

779
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,288
I guess over the years,
the laughter just sorta stopped.

780
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,499
What about love?

781
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,626
What about it?

782
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,711
Do you still
love him?

783
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,130
I don't think you ever
stop loving somebody

784
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,548
you've loved
for so long.

785
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,801
You know it just
doesn't work that way.

786
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,302
That's pretty
dangerous.

787
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,554
So is wakin' up
in the morning.

788
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,015
Good evening, gentlemen,
dinner for three?

789
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,562
You all cooperate,
no one'll get hurt.

790
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,106
Please, oh, god,
don't hurt anybody.

791
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,650
I'll give you all the money
out of the cash register.

792
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,360
You got $100,000?

793
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,195
[Man]
Where's your husband?

794
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,864
[Woman, sobbing]
He's in the kitchen.

795
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,449
[Man]
Hit the office safe.

796
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,993
[Crying]

797
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,496
You have two children,
don't you?

798
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,206
Why?

799
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,332
Just answer the question.

800
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,627
I have a boy
and a girl.

801
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,299
Who are you?
What do you want?

802
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,844
You owe the man,
Nicky, baby. Big time.

803
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,429
[Nick]
I'll pay you.

804
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,806
I promise
I'll pay you!

805
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,350
He ain't gonna listen, Nick.
Too late for that.

806
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,811
You son of a bitch, Nicky!

807
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,355
Shut up!
I'll get it.

808
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,108
Tell him I'll get it.
You hear me?

809
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,527
He ain't gonna wait
no longer. Sir, stand up.

810
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,570
[Nick] Don't!

811
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,488
How was your
last meal?

812
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,576
I'm tellin' you,
believe me, Nicky,

813
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:29,203
this is not
good for business.

814
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,621
Every week you
don't pay me,

815
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:34,041
I come in here and get
a boy and I get a girl.

816
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,127
In one week, it's gonna
be your children.

817
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,503
You! Stand up.

818
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,881
[Nick]
No, not again!

819
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:44,051
No! Not again!
Please. Kill me.

820
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,596
If I kill you, who's
gonna pay the money?
<b></b>
Kill me!

821
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,014
I'll give you all my money.

822
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,683
I don't want your money.
I want your life.

823
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,226
It's not on the menu.

824
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:59,942
[Woman] Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

825
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,195
Aren't you gonna help me?

826
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:04,322
You're doin' fine.
You're doin' fine.

827
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,240
Get up, get up!

828
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:06,908
You okay?

829
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,994
[Siren blares]

830
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,496
Stay down.

831
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,917
Go, go!

832
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,595
Down. Down!

833
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,064
Now you help me.

834
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,482
I didn't bring my gun,
okay?

835
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,984
I thought we were just
going out to dinner.

836
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,409
Are you gonna
be all right?

837
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,953
I just can't
get used to it.

838
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,875
Thank god you can't
get used to it.

839
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,295
Oh.

840
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:44,755
You all right?

841
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,669
Where the hell
have you been?
<b></b>
Like you give a shit!

842
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,005
I've been up all night
worried sick about you!

843
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,050
Let go! Get the fuck
away from my car!

844
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,397
I'm sorry.

845
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,566
All right, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

846
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,735
Okay?

847
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,784
Damn it!

848
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,457
Can we...?

849
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,127
I don't wanna
lose you, vickie.

850
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,588
You've already
lost me.

851
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:11,050
Don't say that, all right?

852
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,679
We can work it out, all right.
I've done some stupid things.

853
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,516
I still love you.

854
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,524
Roberto melendez.

855
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,651
Yeah, county corrections,
all right, thank you, goodbye.

856
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,778
Vickie, message.

857
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,993
Hey, what the hell
was all that about?

858
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:39,328
Roberto melendez,
county corrections,
something like that.

859
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,623
What do I look like?
A blue...

860
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,672
That's
my recommendation.

861
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:50,214
Let's say you're right.

862
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:52,842
Let's say she is
holding something,

863
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:53,968
information through
Roberto melendez.

864
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,970
I think internal affairs
should be told.

865
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,639
This has nothing to do
with your personal life

866
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,517
or the fact that
you couldn't get
melendez to talk?

867
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,478
This has nothing to do
with that situation.

868
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,816
I think she should turn over
the information she has

869
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,484
and be suspended.

870
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,695
Well, let me tell
you what I think.

871
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,572
Let's say she is
withholding information.

872
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:17,783
Maybe this internal affairs
bullshit might refuel her fire.

873
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:22,246
Let's put her back
out on the street.

874
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,706
Put a tail on her.

875
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,750
Maybe something
might happen

876
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,918
to her out on
the street that could...

877

880
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,347
She has me drinking.

881
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,983
Let's go.
We're working tonight.

882
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:52,902
Didn't you have
enough fun last night?

883

more time, all right?

884
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,782
You take orders from me.

885
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,117
Got it? I take 'em
from the captain.

886
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:01,869
And he takes 'em from god.

887
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,746

consider themselves.

888

What have we got goin'?

889
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:08,084
We're shadowing
vickie Stewart.

890
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,294
Following detective Stewart?

891
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:14,006
Is this part of a case?
Or is this part of you?

892
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:15,800
My orders.

893
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,427
I think she should be told.

894
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,471
Keep your mouth shut,
and do as you're told.

895
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,847
Look, if she's in danger,

896
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,391
she oughta be
told what's goin' on.

897
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,893
You're not asked
to think, officer Martin.

898
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,896
You can be
officer Martin very quickly.

899
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,691
Detectives do get turned
into officers again. Easily.

900
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:33,859
Is that a threat?

901
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,737
It's a fact.

902
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:37,279
No.

903
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:43,619
Fact is you've
got a problem with this.

904
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,539
I don't think you'd be
the best protection

905
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,749
for detective Stewart.

906
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,838
So, so, so, so,
what are you sayin' then?

907
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,968
You don't think
I'm gonna do a good job?

908
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:02,847
You think I won't protect her
when something goes down?

909
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:07,393
That's exactly
what I'm sayin'.

910

You don't have a choice.

You're either in all the way,
or you're not in at all.

914
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,336
I can get you
out of here.

They come to my cell.

They wanted what you want.

You help me get these guys.

Like liberace or charo,

923
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,718
he's just Salvador.

924
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,433
My cousin--
Mia Sanchez.

You know how
we people are.

926
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,853
We're all cousins.

927
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:21,902
He had a sweet tooth,
you know, for the hookers?

928
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,698
He keeps her
in a penthouse.

929
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:30,202
The metropolitan hotel.
Sunset boulevard.

930
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,582
You find Mia...

931

Let's play,

932
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:43,090
Then you'll find Salvador.

Give me the officer's names.

934
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,014
I didn't hear any names.

935

No names.

The pain and the laughter.

938

More pain and more laughter.

939
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,032
And there was no more pain.

940

he went out into the fields

and packaged it

small problem.

it back to me.
