1
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:03,814
What did you eat?

2
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,984
You had rations for two weeks.

3
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,319
You were inside
for nearly four months.

4
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,822
I don't remember eating.

5
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,868
How long did you think
you were inside?

6
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,289
Days.

7
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,041
Maybe weeks.

8
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,255
What happened to Josie Radek?

9
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,391
- I don't know.
- What about Sheppard?

10
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,560
Thorensen?

11
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,023
Dead.

12
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:47,733
Ventress?

13
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,323
I don't know.

14
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,409
Then what do you know?

15
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,760
<i>This is a cell.</i>

16
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,762
<i>Like all cells,</i>

17
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>it is born
from an existing cell.</i>

18
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>And by extension,</i>

19
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,104
<i>all cells were ultimately
born from one cell.</i>

20
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,314
A single organism

21
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:13,193
alone on Planet Earth,
perhaps alone in the universe.

22
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,779
About four billion
years ago

23
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,032
one became two.
Two became four.

24
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,203
Then eight, 16, 32.

25
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,123
The rhythm
of the dividing pair,

26
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,333
which becomes

27
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,294
the structure
of every microbe,

28
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,214
blade of grass, sea creature,
land creature,

29
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,757
and human.

30
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,969
The structure
of everything that lives

31
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,139
and everything that dies.

32
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,143
As students of medicine,
as the doctors of tomorrow,

33
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,811
this is where you come in.

34
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,647
The cell we're looking at

35
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,482
is from a tumor.

36
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,317
Female patient,
early thirties,

37
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,153
taken from the cervix.

38
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,988
Over the course
of the next term,

39
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,907
we will be closely examining
cancer cells in vitro

40
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,993
and discussing
autophagic activity.

41
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,828
Professor?

42
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,912
Hi, Katie.

43
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,165
I read the John Sulston
paper last night.

44
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,167
I still feel I'm not working
hard enough.

45
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm behind the other students,
they find everything easier.

46
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,463
You aren't,
and they don't, okay?

47
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,756
Lena!

48
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,009
Dan.

49
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,635
I've been looking
for you at lunch,

50
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,554
but you never
seem to be around.

51
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,848
I've been catching up
on some writing.

52
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,017
All work and no play.
It's...

53
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,518
Not healthy.

54
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,565
I wanted to ask,
do you have plans Saturday?

55
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,485
Sarah and I have
a few people over.

56
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,695
A garden party
while the weather holds.

57
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,032
Actually, I do have plans.

58
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,617
I think it'll be a lot of fun.

59
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,118
Thanks, Dan,
I really appreciate it,

60
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,078
but I'm going
to paint our bed...

61
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,955
The bedroom.

62
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,793
It's been a year, Lena.

63
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,297
You're allowed
to come to a barbecue.

64
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,424
It is not a betrayal

65
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,843
or an insult to his memory.

66
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,056
I'm gonna paint the bedroom.

67
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,666
Oh, God.

68
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,672
Oh, my God.

69
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,516
I thought
you were gone

70
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,520
forever.

71
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,902
Kane?

72
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,217
No one knew anything
about your unit.

73
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,010
I contacted everyone.

74
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,720
Everyone I could.

75
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,556
The other partners knew
just as little as me.

76
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,021
Was it covert?

77
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,776
Maybe.

78
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,987
What's that mean, "Maybe"?

79
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,075
Okay, yeah. It was covert,
yeah, I think so.

80
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,910
Pakistan again?

81
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,874
I don't know
where it was,

82
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,378
or what it was.

83
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,754
How is that possible?

84
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,215
Was... Was it warm?

85
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,758
Was there snow?

86
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,094
Did the people there
speak Portuguese,

87
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,805
or Swahili, or Pashto?

88
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,477
How long have you been back?

89
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,022
I don't know.

90
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,691
How'd you get back?
What base did you fly into?

91
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,027
I don't know.

92
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,236
What about the rest
of your unit?

93
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,529
Did they come back with you?

94
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,201
You must be able
to tell me something.

95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,788
You vanished off the face
of the Earth for 12 months.

96
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,041
I deserve a better explanation
than no explanation.

97
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,625
Does it matter?

98
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,524
Kane,

99
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,527
how did you get home?

100
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,491
I was outside.

101
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,077
Outside the house?

102
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,662
No.

103
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,290
No, I was outside the room.

104
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,169
The room with the bed.

105
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,798
The door was open,

106
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,842
and I saw you.

107
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,515
I recognized you.

108
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,520
Your face.

109
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,036
I don't feel very well.

110
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,255
Stay with me, baby.

111
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,132
I'm right here with you.

112
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,509
Male, 31, hemorrhage,
in seizure.

113
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,137
Stay with me, baby.
I love you.

114
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,556
Baby, look at me.
Can you do something?

115
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,061
You call for a police escort?

116
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,822
Easy, easy!

117
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,420
- Out of the truck now!
- Out!

118
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,422
- Out of the truck now!
- What are you doing?

119
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,216
- Move! Out, out!
- Don't shoot!

120
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,969
- Out, out, out!
- What is going on?

121
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,637
- Do not move!
- What are you doing?

122
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,889
You can't move him.

123
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,808
Let him go! Let him go!

124
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,146
Let him go!

125
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,457
You must be feeling dreadful.

126
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,169
It's a hangover from
the sedative you were given.

127
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,171
Come on, sit down.

128
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,010
Who are you?

129
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,689
My name is Dr. Ventress.

130
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,108
I'm a psychologist.

131
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,902
Why am I talking
to a psychologist?

132
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,864
Am I in
a psychiatric hospital?

133
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,033
- No.
- Then what?

134
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,868
Where am I?

135
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,745
Where's my husband?

136
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,457
You served in the military
for seven years.

137
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,670
I'm a professor
from Johns Hopkins.

138
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,214
I want to know what the fuck
I'm doing here.

139
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,549
You r research area

140
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,844
is the genetically programed
life cycle of a cell.

141
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,345
Where is my husband?

142
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,432
Yeah, I'd like to talk
about Sergeant Kane.

143
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,727
When did he arrive back home?

144
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,522
I want to see a lawyer.

145
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,441
You're not gonna be able
to see a lawyer.

146
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,406
Did he explain
how he got back?

147
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,783
No.

148
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,078
Did he contact you at any
point while he was away?

149
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,621
No.

150
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,751
What did he tell you about
his mission when he returned?

151
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,502
Nothing.

152
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,754
What about before he left?

153
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,589
Did he ever mention
where he was going,

154
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,673
what he was doing?

155
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,550
He never said, I never asked.

156
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,719
But you made regular requests

157
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,555
for information
from his unit CO

158
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,683
until six months ago,
and then you stopped.

159
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,187
Why was that?

160
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,774
Thought he was dead?
Time to move on?

161
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,194
It's not easy to move on.

162
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,280
I didn't.

163
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm done answering questions.
It's your turn.

164
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,710
Your husband's here.

165
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,047
He's extremely ill.

166
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,966
- In what way?
- Multiple organ failure.

167
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,220
Massive internal bleeding.

168
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,016
He must have been exposed
to some sort of radiation,

169
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,018
some kind of virus.

170
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,645
You have to tell me
where he was,

171
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,146
what he was doing.

172
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,068
I could actually help him.

173
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,406
<i>A religious event?</i>

174
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,492
<i>An extraterrestrial event?</i>

175
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,953
<i>A higher dimension?</i>

176
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,581
We have many theories.

177
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,291
Few facts.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,419
It started around
three years ago.

179
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,630
Blackwater National Park
reported that a lighthouse

180
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,008
was surrounded
by something they termed

181
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,426
a "Shimmer."

182
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:12,263
One of the wardens
went in to investigate.

183
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,390
Never returned.

184
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,268
The event was classified.

185
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,229
Since then, we've approached
by land, by sea,

186
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,192
sent in drones, animals,
and teams of people.

187
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,402
But nothing comes back.

188
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,739
And the boundary's getting
bigger, it's expanding.

189
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,533
So far, it's eating into
barely populated swampland,

190
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,912
which we evacuated
under the pretext

191
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,622
of a chemical spill,

192
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,832
but that won't
last much longer.

193
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,043
In a few months,

194
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,463
the area will have grown
to where we are right now.

195
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,010
And then
we're talking cities,

196
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,970
states,

197
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,140
and so on.

198
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,311
You say nothing comes back.

199
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,563
But something has.

200
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,775
Yes.

201
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,618
He's dying.

202
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,454
Yes.

203
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,292
We need to come
to an agreement

204
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,877
about what to do with you.

205
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,505
You're not going
to let me go home?

206
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,302
Is that what you want?
To go home?

207
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,641
No.

208
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,935
I want to be with him.

209
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,914
You're not talking to me.

210
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,834
Sorry.

211
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,420
Zoned out.

212
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,464
Thinking about
the next mission?

213
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,427
No.

214
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,346
I was just looking
at the moon.

215
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,518
It's always so weird seeing it
like that in the daylight.

216
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,187
Like God made a mistake.

217
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,522
Left the hall lights on.

218
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,149
God doesn't make mistakes.

219
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,777
That's somewhat key to
the whole being-a-god thing.

220
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,364
Pretty sure He does.

221
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,618
You know He's listening
right now, don't you?

222
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,955
You take a cell,
circumvent the Hayflick limit,

223
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,248
you can prevent senescence.

224
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,835
I was about to make
the exact same point.

225
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,712
It means the cell
doesn't grow old,

226
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,880
it becomes immortal.

227
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,423
Keeps dividing, doesn't die.

228
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,386
We see aging
as a natural process,

229
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,805
but it's actually
a fault in our genes.

230
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,517
I get really turned on
when you patronize me.

231
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,602
It's really hot.

232
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:07,980
Without it, I could keep
looking like this forever.

233
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,025
Okay, well, that could
constitute a mistake.

234
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,533
You didn't tell me where
you're heading this time.

235
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,580
I know there's something
strange about this mission.

236
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
Why?

237
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,714
The silence around it
is louder than usual.

238
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,594
Kind of angling
for a clue here.

239
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,100
So...

240
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,231
We'll be under
the same hemisphere.

241
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,609
What does that tell me?

242
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,781
It tells you that if you
step outside and you look up,

243
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,826
we'll be looking
at the same stars.

244
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,703
Holy fucking shit.

245
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,995
- What?
- Are you kidding?

246
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,122
What?

247
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,124
You think that's what I do
while you're away?

248
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:09,500
What?

249
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,293
You think I'm out
in the garden,

250
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,921
pining, looking up at the sky?

251
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,965
Shut up.

252
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,259
Oh, to think
my beloved Kane...

253
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,385
All right. Okay.

254
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,430
...is looking
at this selfsame moon.

255
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,639
Stop it.

256
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,351
Oh, my distant celestial friend...

257
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,270
No, no!

258
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,231
Please care
for my brave soldier.

259
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,483
Jesus! You know what? You are
disrespectful, seriously.

260
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,819
Not only to your former
comrades in the armed forces,

261
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,987
but also to the President.

262
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,071
You forgot the flag.

263
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,991
I'm getting
to the motherfucking flag.

264
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,117
Oh, my hero!

265
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,286
- Screw you.
- Okay.

266
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,380
She's all by herself.

267
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,299
Don't you think
we should make friends?

268
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,134
Well, obviously you should.

269
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,343
Yep, I'll do it.

270
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,348
Hey.

271
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,017
Hey.

272
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,686
- Am I intruding?
- No, not at all.

273
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,147
Cool.

274
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,983
You know,
always see you here alone.

275
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,236
I'm guessing
you probably feel

276
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,530
weird or awkward.

277
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,700
Somewhat, I guess.

278
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,370
Don't. Seriously, don't.

279
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,456
The people here put themselves

280
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,749
to sleep
in the fetal position,

281
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,542
making cooing noises.

282
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,836
It's freaky, you know.

283
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,464
I'm Anya.

284
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,673
Lena.

285
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,884
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

286
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,054
Why don't you come
and meet my crew?

287
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,889
Come make friends.
Come on.

288
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,726
Ladies, meet Lena.

289
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,895
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

290
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,689
Yeah, that's Cassie Sheppard
and Josie Radek.

291
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,233
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

292
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,068
Do you want
to have a seat?

293
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,736
Thank you.

294
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,863
So, first day
at the Southern Reach.

295
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,031
Yes.

296
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,201
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

297
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,411
You all been here a long time?

298
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,248
Yeah, right from the start.

299
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,749
I'm a geomorphologist.

300
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,044
I've been testing the magnetic
fields around the boundary.

301
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,506
Which is like using confetti
to test a hurricane.

302
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,551
And I've been here

303
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,262
10 months? Ten months!

304
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:27,847
Paramedic from Chicago.

305
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,557
Tried to join an NGO, but
my application got flagged,

306
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,433
so Southern Reach got me.

307
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,726
Only two months.

308
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,103
I'm a physicist.

309
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,897
I came straight from
my Cambridge post-doc.

310
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,607
She's very smart.

311
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,068
What's your story, Lena?

312
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,487
I'm from Johns Hopkins.
Biologist.

313
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,322
- There you go.
- Biologist?

314
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,782
- Told you she was smart.
- What?

315
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,158
We had a bet
on your profession,

316
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,286
and Josie had "biologist,"
of course.

317
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,332
- I had "law enforcement."
- I had you as single.

318
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,127
Jesus! Do you have to hit on
everyone, like all the time?

319
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,712
Come on. Fuck that.
Under the circumstances,

320
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,298
I think I'm allowed to roll
the dice a few more times.

321
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,800
Under what circumstances?

322
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,764
Well, yeah,
crazy as it seems...

323
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,267
Crazy as it is.

324
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,771
We are headed that way.

325
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,944
You're going into the Shimmer?

326
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,237
Six days and counting.

327
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,991
- You three?
- Four.

328
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,492
Ventress.

329
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,162
Dr. Ventress?

330
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,289
Team leader.

331
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,125
- All women.
- Scientists.

332
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,211
The previous teams have been
largely military, so yeah.

333
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,632
What do you think
happened to them?

334
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,759
Well, there are two theories

335
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,677
of what went wrong
in the Shimmer.

336
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,971
One, something kills them.

337
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,682
Two, they go crazy
and kill each other.

338
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,519
There was one military
guy who made it out.

339
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,646
Yeah.

340
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,022
Sergeant.

341
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,358
Yeah, but you heard about
the state that he was in.

342
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,532
Kane,

343
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,704
I know why you went in.

344
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,256
I am so sorry.

345
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,885
And I know what I have to do.

346
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,266
<i>So, you didn't tell
them about your connection</i>

347
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:18,934
<i>to Sergeant Kane.</i>

348
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,271
I thought
it would complicate things.

349
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,897
What?

350
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,775
What would it complicate?

351
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,325
Why are you going
into the Shimmer?

352
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,329
The mission statement is to

353
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:42,833
reach the supposed source of
the Shimmer, the lighthouse.

354
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:46,962
Enter, acquire data,
and return.

355
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,759
But I don't think that
that's your mission statement.

356
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,432
No.

357
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,985
I've been watching the
phenomenon for a while now.

358
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,946
I profile the volunteers.

359
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,325
I pick the teams.

360
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,163
They enter. I watch.

361
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,834
I watch it grow closer.

362
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,090
There's only so long
one can do that.

363
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,010
But you need to know
what's inside?

364
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,555
Yes. I do.

365
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:42,976
So do I.

366
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,771
So that's the complication.

367
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,774
You want to come with us.

368
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,277
I can't do anything
for him here.

369
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,572
Soldier-scientist.

370
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,661
You can fight. You can learn.

371
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,706
You can save him.

372
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,965
You requested to join
the mission.

373
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,467
You knew all
other missions had failed,

374
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,512
and the only survivor
was barely surviving.

375
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,764
That was a brave choice.

376
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,058
Lowed him.

377
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,521
I'm only trying to understand
what drove you.

378
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,151
Lowed him.

379
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,280
So I went in.

380
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,863
And then we get
some real meals.

381
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,742
Spaghetti. Here's Radek's
vegetable crackers.

382
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,038
Cornbread. That's not so bad.

383
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,373
You're finally awake.

384
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,710
Got to give me a second.
I'm a little disoriented.

385
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,420
Join the club.

386
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,089
You don't remember
setting up camp, do you?

387
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,760
I don't remember anything

388
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,054
after we reached
the tree line.

389
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,181
None of us do.

390
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,767
And we did a food inventory.

391
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,603
From the depletion, it looks
like we've been out here for

392
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,772
at least three or four days.

393
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,358
That's not possible.

394
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,443
That's what I said.

395
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:07,741
Guys, I've been checking
my comms and nav equipment.

396
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,327
They boot up fine, no problem
with the electronics,

397
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,953
and the camera is working,

398
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,915
but anything that sends
a signal out of the Shimmer

399
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,249
is down.

400
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,585
Even though we've probably
got about 20 satellites

401
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,296
above us right now.
And check this out.

402
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,468
So we have got

403
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,388
no compass, no comms,
no coordinates,

404
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,348
and no landmarks.

405
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,308
Well, we know
we're in the state park.

406
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,603
We head south, hit the ocean,
then just follow the shoreline

407
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,687
until we hit
the perimeter wall.

408
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,855
Right?

409
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,941
How do we know what's south?

410
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,651
Come on, Josie, you know this.

411
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,653
Hour hand at the sun.

412
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,156
Split the difference between
the hour hand and 12.

413
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,324
South.

414
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,411
Good. We're oriented.

415
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,870
We weren't really expecting

416
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,956
the comms equipment to work,
were we?

417
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,999
I mean, there's been
three years of expeditions

418
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,876
and three years
of radio silence.

419
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,130
Let's pack up and get moving.

420
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,549
We've already lost
a lot of the day.

421
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,319
I'm gonna check this out.

422
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,112
Get us out of this damn swamp.

423
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,238
All right.

424
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,282
Let's check out the hut.

425
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,512
Looks like someone's about
to have a wedding.

426
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,058
These are very strange.

427
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,560
Why?

428
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,064
They're all so different.

429
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,607
To look at them,
you wouldn't say

430
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,859
that they're the same species.

431
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,946
But they're growing from
the same branch structure.

432
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,824
So it has to be
the same species.

433
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,535
It's the same plant.

434
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,247
It's like they're stuck
in a continuous mutation.

435
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,498
A pathology?

436
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,875
Yeah, well,

437
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,379
you'd sure as hell
call it a pathology

438
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,297
if you saw this in a human.

439
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,101
Jackpot

440
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,894
Sheppard.

441
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,604
Mode of transportation.

442
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,194
Anything interesting in there?

443
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,489
No. It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before...

444
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,992
Radek?

445
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,494
Radek!

446
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,664
- Radek!
- It's got my bag!

447
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,040
Radek!

448
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,504
Something's got my bag!

449
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,674
It's got my bag!

450
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,598
- Josie, what's happening?
- What's going on?

451
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,642
Grab my shoulder!

452
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,397
Get her. Come on.

453
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,108
I got her!

454
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,154
You're good. You're good.

455
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,989
Okay.

456
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,498
Let's sit you down.
Help me with her bag.

457
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,043
Okay, just breathe.
It's okay, you're just fine.

458
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,337
- What the hell happened?
- Something in the water.

459
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,600
Get up! Get up! Go.

460
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,195
Shit! Get back.

461
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,909
Sheppard!

462
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,744
Sheppard, watch out!

463
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,749
Holy fuck!

464
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,462
It's exactly the same
as the flowers.

465
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,840
Look at the teeth.

466
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,801
Concentric rows.

467
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,763
Something here is making giant
waves in the gene pool.

468
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,807
Sharks have teeth like that,
don't they?

469
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,143
Do you think
it's a crossbreed?

470
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,731
You can't crossbreed
between different species.

471
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,444
Lena, this is getting heavy.

472
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,706
The mutations
were subtle at first.

473
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,169
More extreme as we grew
closer to the lighthouse.

474
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,839
Corruptions of form.

475
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,675
Duplicates of form.

476
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,343
Duplicates?

477
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,723
Echoes.

478
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,897
Is it possible
these were hallucinations?

479
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,817
I wondered that myself.

480
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,404
But they were shared
among all of us.

481
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,366
It was dreamlike.

482
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,369
Nightmarish?

483
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,079
Not always.

484
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,542
Sometimes it was beautiful.

485
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,113
You hurt?

486
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,241
It's just a bruise.

487
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,577
Must have gotten that
from the gator.

488
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,162
Yeah.

489
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,002
So, where'd you learn
to shoot?

490
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,674
I was in the military
before I was an academic.

491
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,759
Marines?

492
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,761
Army. Seven years.

493
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,305
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

494
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,765
Yeah.

495
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,686
All other lives
feel like a lifetime ago.

496
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,272
We were kids,
I was married.

497
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,441
Which do you carry
around your neck?

498
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,277
A husband or a child?

499
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:23,695
Husband.

500
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,867
He was in the Army, too.
That's... That's how we met.

501
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,286
"Was" in the Army? He quit?

502
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,122
K.l.A.

503
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,709
I'm sorry to hear that.

504
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,254
Guess there had
to be something.

505
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,630
What do you mean?

506
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,385
Volunteering for this.

507
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,138
It's not exactly something
you do if your life is in

508
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,723
perfect harmony.

509
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,560
We're all damaged goods here.

510
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,229
Anya is sober,

511
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,064
therefore an addict.

512
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,317
And Josie wears long sleeves

513
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,484
because she doesn't
want you to see

514
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,153
the scars on her forearms.

515
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,905
She's tried to kill herself?

516
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,158
No, I think the opposite.
Trying to feel alive.

517
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,329
Ventress?

518
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,832
Yeah. As far
as anyone knows,

519
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,795
no friends, no family,
no partner, no children.

520
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,840
No concession in her at all.

521
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,552
<i>You'?</i>

522
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,013
I also lost someone.

523
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,225
Not a husband, though.

524
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,020
A daughter. Leukemia.

525
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,397
God, I'm sorry.

526
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,900
In a way,
it's two bereavements.

527
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,738
My beautiful girl

528
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,075
and the person I once was.

529
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,368
Hey, hey.

530
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,787
We got something here.

531
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,403
This used to be
the headquarters

532
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,988
of the Southern Reach

533
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,782
before the Shimmer
swallowed it.

534
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,704
More mutations.

535
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,164
They're everywhere.

536
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,166
Malignant.

537
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,419
Like tumors.

538
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,714
Is that the old mess hall?

539
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:48,798
Yeah.

540
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,259
Let's billet there. Come on.

541
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,756
There's beds and bags.
You think people are here?

542
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,966
Were here.

543
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,802
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with the past tense.

544
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,741
Damn.

545
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,499
Shit.

546
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,761
This shit is heavy.
Can't carry this.

547
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:34,612
Lena, what you got going on?

548
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,199
Guys, check this out.

549
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,620
Peyton. Mayer.

550
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,666
Kane. Shelley.

551
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,377
Those were the soldiers
on the last expedition.

552
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,878
Looks like they
were using this room

553
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,547
as their base of operations.

554
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,423
Why are some of the names
crossed out?

555
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,134
Let's not jump to conclusions.

556
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,426
I don't know, maybe we should.

557
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,719
Yeah.

558
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,721
This is a plan-view
of the base, right?

559
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,390
Yep. This is the mess hall.

560
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,891
- That's the building we're in?
- Yep.

561
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,434
I think that the times
by the names

562
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,145
are a guard rota,

563
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,522
so if they were guarding the
perimeter, we should, too.

564
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,482
- Copy that.
- Yep.

565
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,664
This might be able
to tell us something.

566
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,587
"For those that follow."

567
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:36,424
I believe that means us.

568
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,601
Memory card.

569
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,646
I should be able to play this.

570
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,447
It's working.

571
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,869
<i>All right?</i>

572
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,460
<i>- Okay?
- Okay_</i>

573
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,586
<i>Okay-</i>

574
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,057
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

575
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,725
Ready? Okay.

576
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,908
Shit.

577
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,952
What is he doing?

578
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,754
No, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

579
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,215
Hold him. Hold him down.

580
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,513
There. There.

581
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,572
Okay. So we know what happened
to the last group,

582
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:24,865
they went insane.

583
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,368
There was something
alive inside that man.

584
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,953
No, that was a trick
of the light.

585
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,037
What?

586
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,497
I've been a paramedic
for 10 years. All right?

587
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,207
I've scraped people
off the side of the road.

588
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,168
You see some weird shit.
That was a trick of the light.

589
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,420
His insides were moving.

590
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:40,131
No, it was shock, Radek.
That was a shock response.

591
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,215
Watch it again.

592
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,717
No, I'm not gonna
fucking watch it again!

593
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,885
That was not intestines.
It was like a worm.

594
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,887
Okay, then you
watch it, Sheppard!

595
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,476
Where are you going?

596
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,826
- Where'd she go?
- Just ahead.

597
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,425
What is it?

598
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,469
I don't know.

599
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,780
I don't want
to stay here tonight.

600
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,281
We don't have a choice.

601
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,077
- Please.
- Come on.

602
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,038
It's too late in the day
for us to move on.

603
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,832
Come on, let's go outside.

604
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,042
That's nice of you.

605
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,380
Why aren't you here?

606
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,134
I got to leave a day early.

607
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,719
What?

608
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,096
Wait, today?

609
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,558
- Right now.
- Shit.

610
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,852
But we had
a whole day planned.

611
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,313
We were gonna drive
to the country.

612
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,940
- We can't.
- Can you at least...

613
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:51,947
"Now" means right now?

614
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,660
Yeah.

615
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,207
What is it?

616
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,507
I do

617
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,470
love you,

618
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,430
Lena.

619
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,975
I love you, too.

620
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,325
Hey.

621
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,579
The mystery unraveling?

622
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,332
Something's unraveling.

623
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,960
I think you're doing okay.

624
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:31,839
Look, Josie's
getting some rest.

625
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:32,965
Yeah.

626
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,925
With the help
of a little sedative.

627
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,553
How about you? Get some sleep?

628
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,430
Some.

629
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,474
I'm at least
as freaked as Josie.

630
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,811
I'm just hiding it better.

631
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,941
I should check on Ventress.

632
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,777
Yep.

633
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,268
What are you doing up?

634
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,062
You're not supposed
to relieve me until 3:00.

635
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,105
I'm done sleeping
for the night.

636
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:31,899
Okay.

637
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,777
Come look at this.

638
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,448
Okay, this is where we are,

639
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,576
and that's the lighthouse.

640
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,870
Southwest is Ville Perdu.

641
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,790
It's a small community
we evacuated two years ago.

642
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,335
I think we should
head there tomorrow,

643
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,087
and then head out
for the coast

644
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,005
the following morning.

645
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,801
Good.

646
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,682
You Okay?

647
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,981
I was gonna say, when

648
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,110
you didn't tell the team
about your connection to Kane,

649
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,195
I wasn't sure
if that was a good idea.

650
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,783
But after seeing
that footage,

651
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,912
yeah...

652
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,873
I'm not sure how they would
have reacted to you.

653
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,254
Why did my husband volunteer
for a suicide mission?

654
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,381
Is that what you think
we're doing?

655
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,341
Committing suicide?

656
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,177
You must have profiled him,
you must have assessed him.

657
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:44,805
He must have said something.

658
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,101
So you're asking me
as a psychologist?

659
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,353
Yeah.

660
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,481
Then as a psychologist,

661
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:59,111
I'd say you're confusing
suicide with self-destruction.

662
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,782
Almost none of us
commit suicide

663
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,493
and almost all of us
self-destruct.

664
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,747
In some way,
in some part of our lives.

665
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,500
We drink, or we smoke.

666
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,336
We destabilize the good job

667
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,007
or the happy marriage.

668
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,972
But these aren't decisions,
they're...

669
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,349
They're impulses.

670
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:30,726
In fact,

671
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,103
you're probably
better equipped

672
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,481
-to explain this than I am.
- What does that mean?

673
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,983
You're a biologist.

674
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,737
Isn't self-destruction
coded into us?

675
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,739
Programed into each cell?

676
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,826
What was that?

677
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,411
Don't know.

678
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,174
Josie, wake up.

679
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,425
Wake up, Josie, come on.
Wake up.

680
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,593
Something's happening.

681
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,762
- Do you see anything?
- No.

682
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,931
What happened?
I heard a noise.

683
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,642
What?

684
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,771
Something's come through
the fence.

685
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,856
Through the fence?

686
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,608
It's ripped open
like a fucking zipper.

687
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:27,449
- I can't see anything.
- Yeah, neither can I.

688
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,036
Sheppard!

689
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,621
Sheppard!

690
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,414
- Fuck.
- What's going on?

691
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,667
Sheppard was just next to me,
and something took her.

692
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:39,628
Fuck! Fuck!

693
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,547
- Sheppard!
- Shit.

694
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,384
Help me!

695
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,886
Help me!

696
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,601
Sheppard!

697
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,315
Sheppard!

698
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,598
We have to go back.
We have to go back now.

699
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:33,849
She's right.

700
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,642
Right?
In what sense?

701
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,436
We've been
attacked twice.

702
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,521
We lost one of our own.

703
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,440
We have evidence
the previous team

704
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,649
went nuts and chopped
each other up.

705
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,277
I really don't know how much
more right she has to be.

706
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,862
We haven't reached
the lighthouse.

707
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,322
We still don't
understand the cause

708
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,656
or the nature of the Shimmer.

709
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,408
We have data,
observations, photographs.

710
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,492
She has hella footage.

711
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,244
All of which
makes the phenomenon

712
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,621
less explicable, not more.

713
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:00,334
I'm gonna
get to the lighthouse.

714
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,336
And I'm fine going on my own.

715
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,379
You just need to decide

716
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,924
whether you're coming
with me or not.

717
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,146
It's like she doesn't even
notice that Sheppard is dead.

718
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,483
She's crazy.
She's a crazy old bitch.

719
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,110
And thanks for
the fucking backup, Lena!

720
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,447
I didn't realize
there were sides.

721
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,531
Yeah.

722
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,908
Yeah, there are sides.

723
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:37,037
Okay. Then I agree with you,
we should go back.

724
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,039
Good. Okay, great.
There we go.

725
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,624
Okay, so the three of us

726
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,334
-can just pack up our...
- Hold on a minute.

727
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,627
Hold on.
We should go back, yes.

728
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,171
But it took us, what,
six days to get here?

729
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:49,091
And the coast
is two days away.

730
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:52,177
And as Sheppard said,

731
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,887
when we get to the coast,

732
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,556
we can just follow it until
we hit the perimeter wall.

733
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,767
You're saying that we get out
by going deeper in?

734
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,227
Yeah, if you like. Yeah.

735
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,603
"Like"?

736
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,523
No, I don't fucking "like."

737
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,028
This isn't
some bullshit tactic

738
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,363
to get us to the lighthouse,
is it?

739
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,199
This is not about
the lighthouse, okay?

740
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,868
I believe that the coast
is the best route out.

741
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:22,666
Okay?

742
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,097
You lied to them.

743
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,811
I didn't know
what going back meant.

744
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,689
Why it would be safer
than going forward.

745
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:47,899
You didn't know,

746
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,318
but you made the decision
to continue as if you did.

747
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,987
Ventress made the decision.

748
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,282
Ventress had cancer,
she was never coming back.

749
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,784
You knew she was sick.

750
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,619
I had guessed.

751
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:04,332
And you wanted to continue?

752
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,753
Yes.

753
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:10,005
I did.

754
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,595
She could still be alive.

755
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,263
It's highly doubtful.

756
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,391
We need to know.

757
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,020
Go.

758
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:08,980
Fine.

759
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,526
I'm coming with you.

760
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,153
I'll go alone.

761
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,303
Did you find her?

762
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:46,972
Yeah.

763
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,349
She's dead.

764
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,333
You Okay?

765
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,294
Fine.

766
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,546
Just leave me the fuck alone.

767
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,449
We'll camp here tonight.

768
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,202
It's another two hours' walk
up the coast.

769
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,575
They've grown this way.

770
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,078
That doesn't make any sense.

771
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,246
I think it does.

772
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,757
At first, I thought
the radio waves

773
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,592
were blocked by the Shimmer,

774
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,844
and that's why no one
inside could communicate

775
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:52,180
with base or GPS.

776
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,141
But the light waves
aren't blocked,

777
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,685
they're refracted. And...

778
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,109
It's the same with the radios.

779
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,820
Signals aren't gone.

780
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,613
They're scrambled.

781
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,121
That leaf in your hand.

782
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,998
Do you know what you'd get
if you sequenced it?

783
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,625
What?

784
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,837
- Human Hox genes.
-"Hox"? What does "Hox" mean?

785
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,464
They're the genes
that define the body plan,

786
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,091
the physical structure.

787
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,054
And the plants
have human body plan.

788
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:37,434
Arms attached to shoulders,
legs to hips.

789
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,185
It's literally not possible.

790
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,396
It's literally
what's happening.

791
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:45,483
The Shimmer is a prism,

792
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,485
but it refracts everything.

793
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,697
Not just light
and radio waves.

794
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,325
Animal DNA. Plant DNA.

795
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:56,870
All DNA.

796
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,788
What do you mean, all DNA?

797
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,666
She's talking about our DNA.

798
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,753
She's talking about us.

799
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,989
All right.
I guess this is the bedroom.

800
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,368
Let's secure doors
and windows.

801
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,538
This was a mistake.

802
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,334
Okay.

803
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,384
You spend more time away from
your husband than with him.

804
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,888
You can't talk to him
about work,

805
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,222
and he won't talk
to you about his.

806
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,266
And there is a clear physical

807
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,185
and intellectual connection
between us.

808
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,645
Have I covered the bases?

809
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,896
You forgot to mention
your wife.

810
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,230
I love my wife.

811
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,401
She's blameless in this.

812
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:25,286
Come on, Lena.

813
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,081
What's really going on here?

814
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,752
You think that something
may have happened to him?

815
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,258
Or you think he knows.

816
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,137
That's it, isn't it?

817
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,766
You think somehow he's found
out about our affair.

818
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:50,186
Has he found out?

819
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,271
Yes.

820
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:56,943
You should go.

821
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:00,822
- No, Lena, I...
- Dan.

822
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,741
I'm not interested in talking,

823
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,993
or anything you have to say.

824
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,496
Just get dressed and get out.

825
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,625
You know,
it's not me you hate.

826
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,085
It's yourself.

827
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,756
No, Dan, it's you, too.

828
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,595
It's never gonna happen again.

829
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:31,978
You lying bitch!

830
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,398
- What's going on?
- No.

831
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,817
You don't get to ask
that fucking question.

832
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,360
You answer it!

833
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,682
Brother.

834
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:12,769
Boyfriend.

835
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,688
Husband.

836
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:20,818
Husband.

837
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,739
Why didn't you tell us?

838
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,159
You knew.

839
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,536
Obviously.

840
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,792
Did you know?

841
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:41,506
Okay.

842
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:46,928
So, there are two theories

843
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,137
of what went wrong
in the Shimmer.

844
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,807
One is that something in here
killed them. Two

845
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,726
is that they went crazy
and they killed each other.

846
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,688
Josie nearly got killed
by an alligator,

847
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:00,233
and Cass did get killed
by a bear.

848
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,946
So, yes, theory one, it fits.

849
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,283
But

850
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,579
I didn't actually see a bear.

851
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,582
And neither did Josie.

852
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,669
The only people who saw a bear
were Lena and Ventress.

853
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,089
So nothing's confirmed.
Everything's on their word.

854
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:27,593
Everything's on Lena's word.

855
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,554
And what we know now...

856
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:37,478
What we know
is that Lena is a liar.

857
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:40,064
Shut the fuck up!

858
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:44,986
Lena, you're a liar.

859
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:48,990
Did you kill Cass?

860
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,536
Did you lose your shit?

861
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,790
Or do you think
that I've lost my shit,

862
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,292
and now we're just gonna
fuck each other up?

863
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:00,751
That's theory two.

864
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,265
When I look at my hands

865
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,517
and my fingerprints,

866
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,478
I can see them moving.

867
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,613
If I let you go

868
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,490
and you tie me to a chair
and cut me open,

869
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:36,871
are my insides gonna move
like my fingerprints?

870
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:48,007
But I'm not the one
tied to a chair.

871
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,512
You are.

872
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,894
Help me!

873
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,315
Help me!

874
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,275
Help me!

875
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:07,902
Cass?

876
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,031
You said she was dead.

877
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,369
Cass! Cass, I'm coming!

878
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,206
Cass, is that you?

879
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:04,750
Help me!

880
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,587
Help me!

881
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,424
Help...

882
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,606
Don't react.

883
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,324
...me!

884
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,645
Help...

885
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,078
...me!

886
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,380
Help me.

887
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,739
What are you doing?

888
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:43,659
- I'm leaving.
- Now?

889
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,038
- It's not even light yet.
- I don't have time to wait.

890
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,957
We are disintegrating!

891
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,334
Our bodies as fast as
our minds. Can't you feel it?

892
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:55,588
It's like the onset
of dementia.

893
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,759
If I don't reach
the lighthouse soon,

894
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,761
the person
that started this journey

895
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:04,430
won't be the person
that ends it.

896
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:06,891
I want to be the one
that ends it.

897
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,247
We should go, Josie.

898
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,799
How long was your husband
in the Shimmer?

899
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,135
It's hard to say, exactly.

900
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,890
Theoretically,
as long as a year.

901
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:35,604
That's a long time to be
inside and remain intact.

902
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:38,565
I'm not so sure he was intact.

903
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:44,071
I'm right

904
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,950
about the refractions,
aren't I?

905
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,493
Yeah.

906
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,453
I checked my blood last night.

907
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,333
It's in me.

908
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,547
It will be in all of us.

909
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:11,432
It was so strange hearing
Sheppard's voice

910
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,976
in the mouth
of that creature last night.

911
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,564
I think, as she was dying,
part of her mind became

912
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,900
part of the creature
that was killing her.

913
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:26,196
Imagine dying frightened
and in pain

914
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,200
and having that as the only
part of you which survives.

915
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,911
I wouldn't like that at all.

916
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,434
Ventress wants to face it.

917
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,603
You want to fight it.

918
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,899
But I don't think I want
either of those things.

919
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,282
Josie?

920
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:18,957
Josie.

921
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,797
Josie.

922
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:54,785
One by one, all gone,
except you.

923
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,539
How do you explain that?

924
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,420
Is it something
I need to explain?

925
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,797
Yes, you do.

926
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,680
I had to come back.

927
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,350
I'm not sure any of them did.

928
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,535
Hey.

929
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,040
Hey.

930
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,792
I thought I was a man.

931
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:44,593
I had a life.

932
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,346
People called me Kane.

933
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,476
And now I'm not so sure.

934
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,149
If I wasn't Kane, what was I?

935
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:06,782
Was I you?

936
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,620
Were you me?

937
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:27,385
My flesh moves like liquid.

938
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,307
My mind is

939
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:35,936
just cut loose.

940
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:37,938
I can't bear it.

941
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,192
<i>I can't bear it.</i>

942
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:44,110
<i>I can't bear it.</i>

943
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,076
You ever seen
a phosphorus grenade go off?

944
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,412
They're kinda bright.

945
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:57,457
<i>Shield your eyes.</i>

946
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,878
If you ever get out of here,
you find Lena.

947
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,297
I will.

948
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,258
No.

949
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:13,723
Five, four, three, two...

950
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:10,006
It's the last phase.

951
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:14,052
Vanished into havoc.

952
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:20,392
Unfathomable mind.

953
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,481
And now beacon.

954
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,233
Now sea.

955
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:33,863
Dr. Ventress?

956
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,078
Lena?

957
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:49,087
We spoke.

958
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:52,257
What was it we said?

959
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,181
That I needed to know

960
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:02,851
what was inside
the lighthouse.

961
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,771
That moment's passed.

962
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:12,777
It's inside me now.

963
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,364
What's inside you?

964
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:18,742
It's not like us.

965
01:32:19,451 --> 01:32:21,786
It's unlike us.

966
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:26,458
I don't know what it wants.

967
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,293
Or if it wants.

968
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,171
But it will grow

969
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:33,965
until it encompasses
everything.

970
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,636
Our bodies and our minds
will be fragmented

971
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,138
into their smallest parts

972
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:44,267
until not one part remains.

973
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:49,814
Annihilation.

974
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,494
So it was alien.

975
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:19,086
Can you describe its form?

976
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:24,717
No.

977
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:27,428
Was it carbon-based or...

978
01:44:31,223 --> 01:44:32,475
I don't know.

979
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:36,520
What did it want?

980
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:40,107
I don't think
it wanted anything.

981
01:44:40,566 --> 01:44:43,110
But it... It attacked you.

982
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:45,863
It mirrored me.

983
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:47,948
I attacked it.

984
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:51,118
I'm not sure it even knew
I was there.

985
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,370
It came here for a reason.

986
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:55,998
It was mutating
our environment.

987
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:58,042
It was destroying everything.

988
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,378
It wasn't destroying.

989
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:04,757
It was changing everything.

990
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:07,968
It was making something new.

991
01:45:10,721 --> 01:45:12,014
Making what?

992
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:21,190
I don't know.

993
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:28,489
A team reached the lighthouse
a few hours ago.

994
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:30,783
Everything is ash.

995
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:34,745
If what you encountered
was once alive,

996
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,164
it seems it's now dead.

997
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:02,231
Now will you tell me
what happened to my husband?

998
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:04,859
<i>When the Shimmer disappeared,</i>

999
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,777
<i>his blood pressure stabilized</i>

1000
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:09,363
<i>and his pulse rate
started to rise.</i>

1001
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,616
<i>A few hours later,
he was not only awake,</i>

1002
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,118
<i>he was lucid.</i>

1003
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,038
<i>He's still in isolation,
obviously.</i>

1004
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:20,374
<i>So am I.</i>

1005
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:05,502
You aren't Kane.

1006
01:47:07,296 --> 01:47:08,505
Are you?

1007
01:47:14,845 --> 01:47:16,138
I don't think so.

1008
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:25,564
Are you Lena?
