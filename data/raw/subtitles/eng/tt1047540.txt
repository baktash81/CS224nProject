1
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:44,848
<i>Okay, welcome back.</i>

2
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:47,494
<i>This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies...</i>

3
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:49,459
<i>and we've got a good one,
my friends.</i>

4
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:52,834
<i>Top of the ninth here at Chukchansi
Park, and a beautiful night.</i>

5
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:55,301
<i>We can actually feel
that fall is finally an its way.</i>

6
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:59,338
It's a rather crisp 107 degrees, but dry.

7
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:02,806
We've got 15,000 sweaty and bloated
people all pumped up on Churros...

8
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,104
rooting on our Fresno Grizzlies.

9
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:08,613
And Brad, this is why I love
announcing Minor League Baseball...

10
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:11,045
because I get to say names
like "River Cats..."

11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,981
or the "Rancho Cucamonga Quakes."

12
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:15,086
I don't have to ever say boring names

13
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:17,282
like "Tigers," or "Red Sox," or "Cubs."

14
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:19,566
Okay, we got a little
break in the action...

15
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,562
as they're having
a little meeting on the mound.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,787
Artie, do you know what time it is?

17
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:28,833
I sure do, Brad.
It's time for Artie's Kiss Cam!

18
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:32,767
Thank you, Gwen.

19
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,407
Let's see what kind of young lovers

20
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,873
we got at the ballpark tonight.

21
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:37,373
All right, there's a kiss.

22
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,046
Well, you know one thing when you see

23
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:41,045
a kiss like that, they're married.

24
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:43,148
Wait, wait, we've got a proposal.

25
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:45,979
"Will you marry me, Clara? Love, Nate."

26
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:49,645
There's our young Romeo now.
And He has scored!

27
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,126
Brad, that is what
you young people would call a "hottie."

28
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,161
He's got Britney Spears
and he's about to give her the ring...

29
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,160
and he goes the other way!

30
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,458
I can't believe what I am seeing...

31
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:03,124
and I'm sure she's
got a great "personality," but, oh my.

32
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:05,131
I thought Jerry Garcia was dead.

33
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,670
What's he doing
in the stands marrying him?

34
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,605
Here at Chukchansi Park,
love is blind, and apparently so is Nate.

35
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,904
All right, let's get back to the action

36
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,207
as the meeting breaks up on the mound.

37
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,975
Here's the situation.
First and third, two outs.

38
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:20,885
<i>And here's the pitch.</i>

39
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,816
<i>Swing and a miss. Diaz fires down to third.</i>

40
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:23,819
<i>They've picked him off third!</i>

41
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,288
<i>- You're out!
- Ballgame aver!</i>

42
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,518
I'll tell you, Myers is
getting an earful...

43
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:31,788
and as my mom used to say,
"There's no cure for dumb."

44
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,330
Gwen! We won.

45
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,502
And that closes out
the last game of the season.

46
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,137
The Grizzlies take
the Sacramento River Cats...

47
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,738
by a score of three to one.

48
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,340
We'll be right back with a happy recap.

49
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,505
That is a bad way to end a game.

50
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,341
Artie. Mr. Decker.

51
00:02:50,104 --> 00:02:54,985
I want to say thank you
for what has been an awesome semester.

52
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,487
I mean, you taught me a lot,
and... I got you this.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,658
What did you do, Brad?

54
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,225
It's got all the famous calls
you told me about.

55
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,023
Harwell, "Red" Barber, Scully, Russ Hodges.

56
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,380
You know, that's really great,
Brad. Thank you so much.

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,167
Well, as the great Yogi Berra once said,

58
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,736
"It ain't over till it's over."

59
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,065
Well, this Fresno Grizzlies season is over.

60
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:18,266
I'm Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies.

61
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,605
So, on behalf of Brad Zolick
and the late Gwen Foster on the organ...

62
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:25,750
good night everybody,
thanks for listening and lights out, Alice.

63
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,876
I love this job.

64
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,184
I'm fired?

65
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,053
I'm sorry, Artie. I'm changing everything.

66
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,092
New logos, new uniforms, new music.

67
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,045
All the deadwood is
floating to the sawmill.

68
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,031
I'm deadwood?

69
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,533
You're old school.
You reminisce and you tell stories.

70
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,431
All our sponsors are for hearing aids,

71
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,299
beds that go up and down, and scooters.

72
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,473
Not the cool kind, the sad kind.

73
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:51,202
We need someone who's wired in.

74
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:51,968
To what?

75
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:53,302
Facebook.

76
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,035
- How many friends do you have?
- I don't have any friends.

77
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,269
- Have you made any posts?
- No.

78
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,743
- What was your last update?
- My what?

79
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,280
- Have you poked anybody?
- I haven't poked anybody!

80
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,746
- Has anybody poked you?
- No.

81
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,920
The thing is Artie,
even if you were connected...

82
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,910
I don't know that I'd want
to be poked by you.

83
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,287
- How many apps do you have?
- I don't have any apps.

84
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,457
- You don't have any apps?
- No.

85
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,716
- Everyone has apps.
- I don't have an app.

86
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,052
- Do you play Angry Birds?
- Angry Birds?

87
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,127
Who's your favorite Angry Bird?

88
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,218
I don't have a favorite Angry Bird!

89
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,296
Everyone has a favorite Angry Bird.

90
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,786
I don't have a favorite Angry Bird!

91
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:15,891
Hashtag.

92
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,608
When was the last time you hashtagged?

93
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,397
Are you out of your mind?
What the heck are you talking about?

94
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,570
We need announcers that tweet.

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,561
I'll tweet.
I'll make whatever noise you want.

96
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:25,802
Sorry, Artie, my mind's made up.

97
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,808
Feel the burn, everyone.

98
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,208
And one, two, three, four.

99
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,177
Okay, okay.

100
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,711
How are we doing, Diane?

101
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,943
Oh, my sciatica.

102
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:11,552
My other sciatica.

103
00:05:16,414 --> 00:05:18,223
Ten minutes to cheesecake, ladies.

104
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:20,790
There we go. Good job.

105
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,487
Hi, Artie.

106
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,360
Hi, ladies.

107
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:25,694
Caught the end of the game.

108
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:28,667
"No cure for dumb." Funny.

109
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,737
- Yeah.
- Funny.

110
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,631
Don't fall, hon.

111
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,310
I got it.

112
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,708
All right, everybody,
pull your core in.

113
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,806
I don't have a core.

114
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,641
Work those abs.

115
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,620
You know, Artie,
this could turn out to be a good thing.

116
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,519
It could give us more "us" time.

117
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:54,059
You mean me wearing a captain's
hat following you around Costco?

118
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:56,289
You don't want to retire? Fine.

119
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,491
You were offered a job
teaching broadcasting at Fresno State.

120
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,964
You could teach young people.

121
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:02,959
I could,
but why should they know what I know?

122
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,301
Ever the nurturer.

123
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:08,500
I don't want to teach,
I want to do. I still have the dream.

124
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,541
The Giants?

125
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:12,737
Yeah, the Giants.
I've been chasing this job for 35 years.

126
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,746
You give up your dream, you give up.

127
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:15,983
I'm not quitting.

128
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:17,743
I feel 10 years younger than I am,

129
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,478
and I look 10 years younger than that.

130
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:22,486
So basically, you're asking
a 38-year-old to retire.

131
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,590
You're 38? Paint the house.

132
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:29,058
Artie, to me, you're the best
announcer in the whole world.

133
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:31,528
You should be broadcasting for the Giants.

134
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,928
But after all these years, honey...

135
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:36,203
something tells me
they don't have you on speed dial.

136
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:42,369
- It'll be okay.
- I'm sorry.

137
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:50,276
<i>H-life awake.</i>

138
00:06:50,473 --> 00:06:54,421
<i>Garage activated. Vehicle charging.</i>

139
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,056
<i>Solar panels activated.</i>

140
00:06:57,246 --> 00:07:00,921
<i>Good morning, Harper, Turner and Barker.</i>

141
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,528
<i>Waffles ready.</i>

142
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:04,754
<i>Coffee ready.</i>

143
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,568
<i>Time for breakfast.</i>

144
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:09,293
But-but, Mom.

145
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:11,870
Honey, hold on one second.

146
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,909
Well, I can have that up for
you in about three hours.

147
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,235
Yeah, one hour,
that's what I meant. Sure, I can hold on.

148
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,243
Stupid!

149
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,382
- What's the matter, honey?
- I missed a note.

150
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:25,452
Come and have breakfast.
You're going to get it.

151
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,713
You know that you always do.

152
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:28,114
Yeah, I'm right here.

153
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,654
Right. And when would that be?

154
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,825
That's so soon. You got to be kidding me.

155
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,152
Dad! Dad.

156
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,659
I'm the soysages,
Turner gets the Wheatie-O's.

157
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:39,457
Okay. Hey, babe, can you take over here?

158
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:40,934
- I'm on a call.
- I'm on a call.

159
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,458
Thank you.

160
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:47,930
But-but M-Mom! Th-The other
k-kids are gonna w-watch them.

161
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,475
Honey, I don't think you'd
really enjoy the Saw movies.

162
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,770
<i>Remember when we went to see Avatar...</i>

163
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,248
and you spent the last two hours

164
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:55,542
with your head inside my purse?

165
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,843
I-I-I was l-looking for the gum.

166
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,410
I'm right here.

167
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,779
I can't believe it.
My computer just crashed.

168
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,446
I'll have to call you right back.

169
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,593
Barker, can we discuss
some of the many other possibilities...

170
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:10,991
for today's wardrobe,
including some involving pants?

171
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:12,987
Honey, can I talk to you outside
for a second?

172
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:16,034
Sure. I have nothing but time.

173
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:20,266
D-Dad? C-Can I watch the Saw movies?

174
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:21,269
Sure.

175
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:23,169
Yeah!

176
00:08:23,364 --> 00:08:26,140
Wait. That's way inappropriate.

177
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:29,843
What's up?

178
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:35,814
That was nice. Like a little mini date.

179
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,988
Crazy year, right?

180
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:39,817
I mean, the whole thing.
Moving to Atlanta for my job.

181
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:41,618
Yeah, it's had its challenges.

182
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,056
Well, guess what.
That was my boss on the phone...

183
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:45,855
and the H-life has been nominated

184
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:48,331
for "Best New Product of the Year."

185
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:52,303
That's fantastic!

186
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:54,973
I know! They're flying us both next week.

187
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:58,575
Five days of lectures
and networking and love.

188
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,701
Saturday is Harper's audition.

189
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:01,879
Yeah, but it's at night.

190
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:03,509
We'll fly back early. We'll make it.

191
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:04,845
Also, Turner has speech therapy.

192
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,449
I have to buy Harper a dress
for the audition.

193
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,050
We're supposed
to take the kids to the symphony...

194
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,881
Honey, we haven't had a
vacation since Barker was born.

195
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:13,182
That's five years.

196
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,953
This conversation is the longest we've been
alone in months.

197
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,720
So, great.
I'll call my parents, they'll fly down.

198
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:21,421
They'll be happy
to watch the kids while we're gone.

199
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,603
A cruise. What cruise?

200
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:31,469
The one that we bought them
for their 40th anniversary.

201
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,871
<i>I said just get them matching tracksuits.</i>

202
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,809
Look, we'll figure something out, okay?

203
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,240
Well, we could always call your parents.

204
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:49,392
Oh, you're serious.

205
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:52,791
Yeah. They haven't seen the kids
in what, a year?

206
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:56,590
Ten months is not quite a year.

207
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,098
Call them.

208
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,440
- They're not coming.
- Don't you need to talk to them first?

209
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,510
You know that they're just going to
say that they can't make it.

210
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:11,440
What? What?

211
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,508
- What?
- The itch.

212
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:16,276
You're kidding.
You're getting your "Artie and Diane Rash"?

213
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:19,581
Have you forgotten how they disapprove
of the way that we parent?

214
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:24,022
My father doesn't listen.
My mother, she's a tornado with lipstick.

215
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,189
Alice, we need this vacation.

216
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:28,455
And as you know...

217
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,297
who's going to be with you
in the Hilton Head?

218
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,503
Nigel?

219
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:36,672
That's right.

220
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,640
In fact, have you heard me new song?

221
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,806
<i>I'm gonna lave you
till the police come</i>

222
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:50,212
Anything for you, Nigel.

223
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,653
Carl flushed my pillow down the toilet.

224
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:57,519
<i>Toilet overflowing.
Bathroom flooded.</i>

225
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:00,389
Okay, I'll call my parents.

226
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,763
Artie, pick up the phone!

227
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,097
What are you doing?

228
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,606
I can't hear you, the phone's ringing.

229
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:16,711
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

230
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,676
<i>- Alice, how are you?
- Is Mom around?</i>

231
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,849
Yeah, hold on, I'll get her.

232
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:21,914
Your daughter.

233
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:23,066
Put her on speakerphone.

234
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:25,016
Don't tell her I was fired.

235
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,056
- Oh, my.
- I got it.

236
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:30,384
- Put her on hold.
- I know.

237
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:31,525
- Put her on hold.
- I'm trying.

238
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:32,625
- Put her on hold.
- I can't.

239
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,262
- Put her on hold.
- You're making me tense.

240
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,486
Now, put her on hold.

241
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,723
It's right there.

242
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,298
I'm gonna start a fire, here.

243
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:40,729
Hi, Alice, what's going on?

244
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:45,395
Well, now that you ask...

245
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:49,941
Phil has to go away next week and
I'd really like to go with him.

246
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,908
<i>And we need someone to watch the kids,</i>

247
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:53,843
<i>so I was wandering, would you want ta?</i>

248
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,516
No. No.

249
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,283
We'd love to!

250
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:59,018
Listen, I'm cooking dinner.

251
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:01,746
I'll call you back in a
little bit for the details.

252
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:03,680
She said yes.

253
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,790
You said yes.

254
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:07,018
Artie, we practically
never see our grandchildren.

255
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,287
We've never seen their new house.

256
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:09,792
They've never been to Fresno.

257
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,590
I just got fired. I'm licking my wounds.

258
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:13,199
I'll lick them. Come on!

259
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:14,800
They need someone to take care of the kids.

260
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:16,334
Can't the house do it?

261
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,695
We have one child.

262
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:22,342
These three kids are the only
grandchildren we're ever going to have.

263
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,946
I'm awkward around those kids.
I don't think they like me.

264
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,848
Honey, they don't see you enough.

265
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,542
They have to know you better
before they don't like you.

266
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,989
No, but it's a real thing, Di.
And it all comes from Alice.

267
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,714
Like the last time,
the little one left the house...

268
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,193
wearing flippers and a bathrobe.

269
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:42,661
Sol made a little joke.
I said, "This one, any hope for normal?"

270
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:45,127
And I got this withering gaze.

271
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,492
Like you're giving me now.

272
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,668
Well, first of all...

273
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,861
it might be a good thing
if you learned "the little one's" name.

274
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,061
It's Barker.

275
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:57,710
Di.

276
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,413
Listen to me, I'm fragile right now.

277
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:02,673
I need a job.

278
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,408
I don't need Alice's disapproval.
I'm not going.

279
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:07,712
- You're going.
- That's what I meant.

280
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,719
Her whole way of raising
her kids is a giant...

281
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,520
in our face.

282
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,321
It's her generation. It's just their way.

283
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,392
Hey, what are you looking for, sailor?

284
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:22,535
If you haven't found
it yet, it's not there. I'll help you out.

285
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,735
- Come on!
- He's not done groping.

286
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:31,604
And could she
have found anyone less like me to marry?

287
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:34,841
What's your
problem with Phil? He's such a sweet guy.

288
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,539
He is sweet. I think he breastfed the kids.

289
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,513
Perfect, it's raining.

290
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:41,827
Scattered showers, honey.
It'll be over in 20 minutes.

291
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:42,954
It's an omen.

292
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,090
- What's it an omen of?
- Impending doom.

293
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,054
- I have a great idea.
- What's that?

294
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:48,090
Shut up!

295
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:49,890
I'll think about it.

296
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,932
- You know what grandparenting is?
- What?

297
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,258
A second chance.

298
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,401
That's pretty good.

299
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:00,232
- And you know what Alice told me?
- What?

300
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:03,434
The kids are over-the-moon excited
about our coming.

301
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:04,541
Why them?

302
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,575
Because they're your grandparents
and they love you.

303
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,769
D-Do we have to wear these?

304
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:13,547
Well, Grandma made them.
And she thinks you like them.

305
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:15,420
Why would she think that?

306
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:17,888
Because I told her that you did.

307
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,492
Look, it's going to be okay. I promise you.

308
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,422
You know, they're very funny.

309
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,926
Grandpa tells lots of jokes...

310
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:27,790
that you won't get.

311
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,768
So just laugh.

312
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:34,837
Just laugh and I promise you
we'll get through this week.

313
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,501
Remember, Mama loves you very much.

314
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,141
They're here!

315
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:47,182
Oh, no.

316
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,350
Hi!

317
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:54,456
Hi!

318
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:55,853
This is a McStadium.

319
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:57,585
Hey, thanks for coming.

320
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:58,592
Hello, Phil.

321
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:01,459
Oh, my goodness!
They're wearing their shirts.

322
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,930
I told you, they love those shirts!

323
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,501
Give me a kiss.

324
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:09,973
I'm so excited.

325
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:12,165
This one's gonna be prettier
than her grandma.

326
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:13,776
- Harper.
- I know.

327
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,946
How's the fiddle coming? Still fiddling?

328
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:17,473
Hello, boys, still single?

329
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:22,788
Mom, you brought groceries?

330
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:23,919
You know Dad.

331
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:26,248
He just wanted to make sure
you had food here for him.

332
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,618
Okay, and toilet paper?

333
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:31,488
Well, I know what I like. Aloe.

334
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:34,258
Are those for us?

335
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:35,989
Those are definitely for you!

336
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:38,134
Yep. One for each of you.

337
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:40,030
Here you go. And for you.

338
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,671
S-Super Squirters! Awesome!

339
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,771
You bought them guns.

340
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:44,872
Yeah.

341
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:47,977
Dad. We don't do guns.

342
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,443
Hey, if you think
that's something, wait until you see this.

343
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:53,708
This is classic Artie.

344
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:58,484
Artie Decker bobbleheads.

345
00:15:58,677 --> 00:15:59,883
Here you go. Look at this?

346
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,183
What do you say?

347
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,621
That's creepy. Make it stop!

348
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:06,387
Thank you, Grandpa.

349
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:07,893
Th-Thank you, G-Grandpa.

350
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,794
Hey, you know what?
Since we're all gonna be pals now...

351
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:14,663
instead of calling me
"Grandpa," why don't you call me "Artie"?

352
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,863
So it's "Grandma and Artie"
now? What are you, my boyfriend?

353
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,564
No, listen. We went through
all those names last time.

354
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,869
I don't want to be "Mup-Mup,"
or "Bup-Bup," or "Boop-Boop."

355
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:23,170
Those are puppet names.

356
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,577
My name is Artie.
Always been Artie. Call me Artie.

357
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:28,580
Can I call you "Farty"?

358
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:30,516
That's not a name, dope.

359
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,212
Hey, that was a put-down.
You owe me three put-ups.

360
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,089
I like your shoes.
I like your shirt. I like your hair.

361
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,055
Let's go inside.

362
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:39,284
You guys all have to change because

363
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,485
we're going out for dinner. Come on.

364
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:41,993
Get the bags, Farty.

365
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,264
Alice, this is a beautiful house.

366
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,369
Thank you.

367
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,096
- It's a prototype.
- Prototype?

368
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:55,209
<i>Welcome, Alice and Phil and Harper
and Turner and Barker and...</i>

369
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,004
<i>two unidentified guests.</i>

370
00:16:58,202 --> 00:16:59,272
But that's not strange.

371
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,278
It's the H-life.

372
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:03,007
It's Phil's invention.
It's what he's worked on all this time.

373
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,086
This is the brain center
to this fully automated...

374
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,450
voice-activated, prototype smart house.

375
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:12,092
And I'm just going to enter you two
into the system right now.

376
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,522
All right.

377
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,453
Beam me up.

378
00:17:16,653 --> 00:17:17,927
You all get these portables...

379
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,591
and if there are any problems,
Turner understands the whole system.

380
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:22,868
Turner does?

381
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,198
Well, if Turner can do it,
I certainly can't.

382
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,606
Alice, this is so beautiful.

383
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,612
How's work, Dad? How's your season?

384
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,247
Very good. Yeah, we had a good season.

385
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:35,939
Yeah, a lot of good kids.

386
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,777
You know, your dad still signs off

387
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,579
every broadcast, "Lights out, Alice."

388
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,722
- Really?
- Yeah.

389
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,373
See, when Alice was a little girl,

390
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:44,754
I wasn't home a lot to put her to bed...

391
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,393
so on the radio I would say...

392
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,053
"Lights out, Alice,"
and it sort of stuck, you know?

393
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,397
That's really nice.

394
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:52,465
Yeah.

395
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:54,256
I thought so.

396
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:55,925
What's this?

397
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,399
It's some photos.

398
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,777
Pipi and Papi look great.

399
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:05,809
Yeah.

400
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,571
Here you are.

401
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,306
Oh, yeah.

402
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,677
I took that picture!

403
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,045
That was a great day, yeah.

404
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,879
Farty wet his pants!

405
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,147
Barker, indoor voice.

406
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,459
Farty wet his pants! Farty wet his pants!

407
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:23,923
Guns.

408
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,462
Guns.

409
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,337
That's so hot!
What are you doing? It's too hot!

410
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,064
Here, do it yourself.

411
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,173
What's the matter?

412
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:41,014
- Do you realize what we are?
- What?

413
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,940
We're the "other" grandparents.

414
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:44,549
We can't be all four.

415
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,946
I'm serious.

416
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,462
They have their real grandparents

417
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,952
that they love and put up on the mantle...

418
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:51,020
and then there's us.

419
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,522
And who's putting those pictures
on the mantle?

420
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,253
Our daughter. She is not
sticking up for us.

421
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:00,592
I don't think the kids
even know what I do. Or did.

422
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:02,324
Look, Artie, I know you're upset

423
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,127
about getting kicked in your career...

424
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:05,895
but we need to focus, buddy.

425
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:07,732
Our grandchildren are going to love me.

426
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,909
- What about me?
- That's your problem.

427
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,942
Welcome!

428
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,048
- New people.
- Hello.

429
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:29,125
These are my parents.
They're going to watch the kids this week.

430
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,887
Welcome to Healthy Tiger.

431
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,190
All healthy Pan Asian food.

432
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:34,093
What's that?

433
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:36,530
No MSG, no gluten, no sodium.

434
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:38,897
Just healthy food.

435
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:42,104
I'm drooling already.

436
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:44,298
Pan Asian, just like me!

437
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:45,806
My mother's Japanese,
my father's Chinese...

438
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:48,479
my kids are Korean
and they go to Hebrew day school.

439
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:50,410
<i>Oy vey</i>

440
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:52,413
Come on. Yeah!

441
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,280
How do you ruin Chinese food?

442
00:19:55,809 --> 00:19:56,981
Okay.

443
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,789
We seem to have an empty chair.

444
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,220
No, no, that chair is for Carl.

445
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,057
- Who's Carl?
- Barker's friend.

446
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,593
How nice. When's he coming?

447
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:06,093
He's already here.

448
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:08,391
Hi, Carl. You look great.

449
00:20:08,588 --> 00:20:10,158
Did you get a haircut?

450
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,603
Tell him.

451
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:16,303
Carl is Barker's imaginary friend.

452
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,804
He's a kangaroo.

453
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:20,172
Maybe we should have eaten
at the Outback.

454
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,616
Kids, go wash your hands.

455
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:31,718
Come on, Carl.

456
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:33,720
Bye, Farty.

457
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,757
He's in a real
"testing the boundaries" phase.

458
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,828
Plus, he's also a little constipated.

459
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:41,733
Now, you're talking my language.

460
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:43,631
I have some stuff that will blow his mind.

461
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:45,343
They used it to blast out the Chunnel.

462
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,960
Thank you, Lord Arthur.

463
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,298
Now, do you have any
special instructions for us?

464
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,615
Like, what the kids like to do,
what they like to eat.

465
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,268
Yes, Mom, great. Thank you.

466
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:55,742
First of all, they don't eat any sugar.

467
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,005
No Carvel?

468
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:58,773
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

469
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,247
We have tried to introduce
just a little bit of sugar...

470
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,286
and it was like going off the rails
of the crazy train.

471
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,821
My gosh!

472
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:08,892
And there's another subject
I'd like to discuss.

473
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:10,016
Sure, anything.

474
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:11,126
Your language.

475
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,663
He won't curse. I'll
break his freaking arm.

476
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:16,099
That's great, but that's not what I meant.

477
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,529
You see, there's a way
that we talk to our kids.

478
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:20,704
For instance, where you would say "No"...

479
00:21:20,893 --> 00:21:23,271
we would say,
"Consider the consequences."

480
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:25,031
Or where you would say, "Don't"...

481
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,369
we would say, "Maybe you should try this."

482
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:29,640
Or where you would say...

483
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,871
"Quit your whining,
you're giving me a headache"...

484
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,448
we would say, "Use your words."

485
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,084
You see, that way, the child feels

486
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:37,720
that he has value, he has worth.

487
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,547
He is heard.

488
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:41,323
It's a way.

489
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:44,189
Let's order.

490
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,058
Great.

491
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,657
That's very good, but if you stay

492
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:51,459
inside the lines, it looks better.

493
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,329
Here, look at mine, see?

494
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:55,505
Dad, we don't really worry about lines.

495
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,168
Honey, draw whatever
your imagination tells you.

496
00:21:58,363 --> 00:22:01,674
But what's the point
of having lines if you're just going to...?

497
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:02,844
Artie.

498
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:06,482
That's beautiful.
That's absolutely beautiful.

499
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:07,979
It's very avant-garde.

500
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:09,880
- Picasso.
- Exactly.

501
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:12,920
You didn't finish your dinner.
You know the great thing about Chinese...

502
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:17,082
I mean, Pan Asian food,
is that if you mush it all up it's...

503
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,724
What happened?

504
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,397
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

505
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,998
He doesn't like his food to touch.

506
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:26,735
I didn't know! Look, I'm un-smushing.

507
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,837
There's so much un-smushed Pan Asian.

508
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:34,071
- What?
- Use your words, Barker.

509
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:36,001
Use your words.

510
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,238
Farty ruined my food! Evil Farty.

511
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,382
Evil Farty, what have you done?

512
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,744
Mama! Dada!

513
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:46,114
Don't go!

514
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,254
I have to go.

515
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:48,389
Don't go!

516
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:50,223
Would you...? I'm trying to let go!

517
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:51,552
Don't go!

518
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:53,753
Don't go!

519
00:22:54,985 --> 00:22:56,362
D-Don't go!

520
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:57,361
Just let go.

521
00:22:57,554 --> 00:22:58,794
He's just so strong.

522
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,764
Let go, baby. Let go, baby.

523
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:02,766
- Just get in the car.
- I am trying.

524
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,564
Barker, honey, just...

525
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,069
- Get in the car.
- I love you.

526
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:07,173
I'm trying to get in the car!

527
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,241
Get in the car.

528
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:09,308
Bye.

529
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,376
No!

530
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:11,608
Drive.

531
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:12,575
Bye, honeybun.

532
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,042
Goodbye, goodbye.

533
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:15,477
Honey, Stop!

534
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:16,649
Bye.

535
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:19,783
- Go.
- Yay!

536
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:21,587
I'll be home really soon.

537
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:22,983
No!

538
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:25,921
Barker's hyperventilating.
Stop the car, please.

539
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:28,594
- Go, go, go!
- Yay!

540
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,424
Give me your worst, worst case scenario.

541
00:23:31,621 --> 00:23:33,658
Everybody dies.

542
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:38,837
Then anything short of that will be
a happy surprise.

543
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,169
Onward.

544
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,608
- Really go now.
- No!

545
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,272
Good heavens.

546
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,882
Time for breakfast.
Come on, we got to get to school.

547
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:53,178
Okay. Let's get this party started!

548
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:54,821
It's going to be great!
It's going to be awesome!

549
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,456
We are going to have so much fun.

550
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:59,126
This is going to be
the best week of your life!

551
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,293
- Right, Artie?
- Sure thing, Regis.

552
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:04,555
Okay. Here we go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

553
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:06,494
Oh, my gosh.

554
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,533
This is it, right?

555
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:12,728
Yeah. I'll see you on the other side.

556
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:17,206
These are done.

557
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:19,037
Hot skillet! Sorry.

558
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:21,214
All right. Here are your sausages.

559
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:22,507
Soysages.

560
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:24,809
Soysages? What are you, from the Bronx?

561
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,766
Did Mom leave my
eggless egg salad for lunch?

562
00:24:26,908 --> 00:24:28,649
Eggless egg salad?
How would I recognize it?

563
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,345
<i>The toast is ready.</i>

564
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:31,585
Di, we have to make lunch!

565
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,260
I know. It's on the counter.
Make the sandwiches.

566
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:36,326
All right. My waffles, my waffles!

567
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:38,596
I got it.

568
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:43,161
Five second rule. Got it.

569
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:46,896
N-Not too much almond milk
in the c-cereal. It g-gets too wet.

570
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:48,369
Is this the right amount?

571
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,565
Well, eat fast.

572
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,036
Okay. Here you go.

573
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,576
You have to cut up the berries...

574
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:56,771
and put one piece in each hole
in the multigrain waffle.

575
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:58,245
This food can touch?

576
00:24:58,472 --> 00:24:59,951
Eggless egg salad coming up.

577
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,586
Okay, put the lettuce,
hit it with the lettuce.

578
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:03,777
It's fine, they will never know.

579
00:25:03,978 --> 00:25:05,753
No crust, no crust.

580
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:07,666
Now there's no sandwich.
Look what you made.

581
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:13,064
I like them, Carl likes them. Right, Carl?

582
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:16,928
And your opinion has value.
And, what's the other one?

583
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:17,932
Worth.

584
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,231
But I know from experience
that wearing heels can be tricky.

585
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:22,634
Especially during recess.

586
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,538
Wouldn't you and Carl
both be more comfortable in sneakers?

587
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,643
No.

588
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:28,643
Hey, what's going on?
We are going to be late.

589
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:32,144
<i>It's Project Hun way.</i>

590
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,649
I tried handling
it like Alice said, but it's not working.

591
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:36,583
All right, get the other two
in the car, I'll handle this.

592
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:37,448
Artie.

593
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:39,454
It's okay. Let me try.

594
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,152
Take off those shoes
and I'll give you a dollar.

595
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:45,421
- Five.
- Two-fifty.

596
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:46,791
Deal.

597
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:48,928
Just punch in "go to school."

598
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:51,568
Why is this easier than
you just telling me how to get there?

599
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,499
<i>I heard that.</i>

600
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:56,071
Is he in there?

601
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:57,536
It's Dad, and it's a recording.

602
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:59,005
It's just a little family joke.

603
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:02,145
Yeah, it's interesting
because, usually, jokes are funny.

604
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:03,837
But hey, why kill time laughing?

605
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:05,243
Okay, here you go.

606
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,416
- Thank you.
- What?

607
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,527
"Go garage." Go garage.

608
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,551
Say it with force.

609
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:09,686
Go garage. Go garage.

610
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,454
Welcome back, Alice.

611
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:13,181
Mommy!

612
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,916
Alice, what happened? Where's Phil?

613
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:17,185
He's on his way to the airport.

614
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,420
I'm going to meet him in a few hours.

615
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,528
There's an 8:00 flight tonight.

616
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,459
But...

617
00:26:20,653 --> 00:26:21,653
One of my clients called.

618
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:23,574
They need me to update
their website immediately.

619
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:25,044
Can't it wait until you get back?

620
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:27,604
No, it's ESPN.
There's a crisis with the X Games.

621
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,864
You work for ESPN?

622
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:31,622
Yeah, I'm one of their web
designers. Honey, get in the backseat.

623
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:33,369
Really? I didn't know that.

624
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:37,276
It's interesting. ESPN. Really?

625
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,381
Nice school.

626
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:42,347
How long have you been working for ESPN?

627
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:43,645
About five years.

628
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:45,219
Really?

629
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,955
Turner...

630
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:51,991
Artie is going to pick
you up after school...

631
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:54,186
and take you to speech therapy today.

632
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,832
Wh-Wh-Where are you-you going to be?

633
00:26:57,022 --> 00:26:58,899
Grandma and I are going
to buy Harper a dress.

634
00:26:59,091 --> 00:27:00,229
Great.

635
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:01,199
Have a good day, you two.

636
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:02,565
See you later.

637
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:04,401
I can't believe I'm going to get a tardy.

638
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:05,931
Six tardies are an absent.

639
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:07,235
How many does this make?

640
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:08,570
One.

641
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:12,211
Does she seem a little tightly wound?

642
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:15,351
You know, she has HAS.
High Achievement Syndrome.

643
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,518
Did you make that up?

644
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,743
Yes.

645
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:18,921
Hurry up, I can't get a tardy.

646
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:22,285
I know she's a little tightly wound.
But we're working on it.

647
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:24,586
Work on it soon before she explodes.

648
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:30,559
W-W-Watch where you're going,
Tu-Tu-Tu-Turner.

649
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:32,697
S-S-Sorry.

650
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,898
Hey, did you see that?

651
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:37,731
Dad, no. No.

652
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,339
Turner's therapist says that he has

653
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:41,017
to work out peer conflicts on his own.

654
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:42,110
He has a therapist?

655
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,540
He had one,
and now he has a new one, Dr. Jimmy.

656
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:45,941
Also a kid?

657
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:46,911
No.

658
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,745
ESPN again. I need to get to a Wi-Fi.

659
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,443
Maybe I can use the one here.

660
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:54,083
Go ahead, I'll get Barker to school.

661
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,189
Are you sure?

662
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:56,619
Sure. What's the problem?

663
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,088
Okay.

664
00:27:58,783 --> 00:27:59,761
Got the H-life.

665
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:02,764
But then pick me up here.
Don't leave me stranded.

666
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:04,364
Have I ever left you stranded?

667
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:05,966
Four times when I was a kid.

668
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:08,364
I love how you remember everything.

669
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:21,242
Okay, Barker, hop out.

670
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,213
I can't. I'm still buckled in.

671
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:24,215
Carl, unbuckle him.

672
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:26,820
Hello? He's at a doctor's appointment.

673
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:29,452
Stupid me. Okay.

674
00:28:36,586 --> 00:28:38,626
Boy, this is harder than
one of your grandma's bras.

675
00:28:38,788 --> 00:28:39,789
I'm going to be late.

676
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:41,798
I'm tr...

677
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:46,737
It works, okay? Your horn works.

678
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,939
I won't need this by the time you're done.

679
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:01,154
Here you go. Here.

680
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,824
Careful, he's a runner.

681
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:07,284
Bye, Farty.

682
00:29:09,652 --> 00:29:11,529
One second.

683
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:13,428
- Hey, Ash.
- Hey, Cody.

684
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,296
- Did you get my Evite?
- Yep, I'm coming.

685
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:16,970
Cool.

686
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:20,299
This is my friend, Harper. This is Cody.

687
00:29:20,495 --> 00:29:21,838
- Hey.
- Hi.

688
00:29:22,464 --> 00:29:24,535
I'm having this birthday
thing Friday night.

689
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,677
There's going to be a DJ, and my parents

690
00:29:26,835 --> 00:29:28,712
promised not to be ridiculously lame.

691
00:29:28,904 --> 00:29:30,110
Right. Parents.

692
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:33,878
So, if you want to swing by,
that would be pretty cool.

693
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,682
I can't.

694
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:44,329
I got this thing the next day.

695
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,055
- She has a thing.
- I got a thing.

696
00:29:46,255 --> 00:29:47,825
Okay. That's cool.

697
00:29:48,023 --> 00:29:49,366
Yeah. No, it's super cool.

698
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:51,538
Well, if you change your mind,
just, you know...

699
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,206
Yeah. Totally, I'll...

700
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:54,373
Cool.

701
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,136
Bye.

702
00:29:58,567 --> 00:29:59,307
Stop it.

703
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,011
Microwave on.

704
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,206
<i>Garbage disposal on.</i>

705
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:07,744
<i>Vacuum cleaner on.</i>

706
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:10,998
Oh, please, just let me do the dishes.

707
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,223
<i>Welcome back, Artie Decker.</i>

708
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,694
What a morning.

709
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,387
It's 9 AM, I need a martini.

710
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:20,861
Tell me something.

711
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:22,832
Did you believe that story?

712
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:25,231
Absolutely not. What story?

713
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:27,201
Alice's work emergency.

714
00:30:27,295 --> 00:30:28,365
You think she was lying?

715
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:30,667
Why couldn't that
work have been done at Hilton Head?

716
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,038
It's like she doesn't
trust us with her kids.

717
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:34,838
Like she thinks we're idiots.

718
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,545
By the way, where is she?

719
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,423
Where have you been?

720
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,692
I know.

721
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,397
You know, Harper, when I was your age...

722
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:06,009
this was my favorite time of the day,
right after school.

723
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,337
Why, what did you do?

724
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:08,774
We used to go to my friend Heidi's house...

725
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:11,381
put on her mother's clothes,
blast music and smoke.

726
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:12,949
Mom!

727
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,019
Don't smoke. Don't smoke.

728
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,128
Oh, Lulu, that was so great.

729
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,199
Honey, you're really
starting to take control...

730
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,029
and literally holding the reins.

731
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:32,726
Okay, Turner...

732
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,902
would you like to share?

733
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,153
Good work, Turner.

734
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:54,291
Awesome.

735
00:31:57,517 --> 00:31:59,587
Super job, Lulu. See you next week?

736
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,923
Thank you.

737
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,157
That was really awesome.

738
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,961
I take it you're Turner's grandfather.

739
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,494
Hi.

740
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:10,336
I'm Artie Decker.

741
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,236
Cassandra.

742
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,172
You seem to be having some trouble

743
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,973
embracing our program, am I right?

744
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,273
Well, let me say first,

745
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,407
that I have professional experience
in this area.

746
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,745
Oh, wonderful.
Where did you receive your degree?

747
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,011
Oh, no degree. No.

748
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:27,520
I speak for a living.
I'm a baseball announcer.

749
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,927
Little different than a PhD
in speech therapy from Yale. Right?

750
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,963
Right, Yeah.

751
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,633
That's a point well taken.

752
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,665
But on the other hand,
I sat here for almost an hour...

753
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:41,599
and I saw these kids
do everything but speak.

754
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,364
So, are you training them to be mimes?

755
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,042
Because a lot of those jobs
are being shipped overseas.

756
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,740
"I'm walking, but there's wind,

757
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,819
"but there's no wind." You know?

758
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:01,846
Okay. I am employing
the Houghton method.

759
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,083
Now these kids, they're under
too much pressure to speak...

760
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:07,456
so we make it very clear that in
here, they need not say a word.

761
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,825
They're currently in a movement phase.

762
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:10,999
Yeah, I saw that.

763
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,499
They're moving everything but their lips.

764
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,331
And he wears these ear buds all the time.

765
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,667
What's that about?

766
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,534
He is listening to the words
that he has trouble with...

767
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,676
and then when
he's comfortable, he can repeat them.

768
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,106
And it's helping him a lot.

769
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,336
How can you tell?

770
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,544
Listen, I haven't seen the kid in a year...

771
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,876
and frankly, I don't see
any improvement at all.

772
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,519
<i>What I see is my grandson is now Flight 38</i>

773
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,316
from Salt Lake.

774
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:36,019
Hey, Turner!

775
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,214
Cassandra's just telling me
how great you're doing.

776
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:41,024
She sees so much improvement. It's great.

777
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:47,795
Sometimes I shouldn't move my lips.
I'm sorry.

778
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,371
That's not bad.

779
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:56,043
"Not bad"?
She looks like a 12-year-old widow.

780
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,980
- I do?
- You do.

781
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:01,843
But that's perfect
for a classical music program.

782
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:03,745
Well, what about this?

783
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,012
This is perfect for someone
with a cute little hiney.

784
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:08,545
I love it.

785
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:11,248
Mom, it's for a concert,
not to meet the fleet.

786
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:14,258
Hey, it's an audition,
and all auditions are alike.

787
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:15,759
"Get their attention!"

788
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,488
You sell the sizzle, not the steak.

789
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:19,488
That's how I got all
those weather girl jobs.

790
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:21,398
So, are you a trained meteorologist?

791
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,569
Trained?

792
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,830
Oh, honey, I had a tight
dress and a pointer.

793
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:26,439
I used to sing my forecasts.

794
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,191
As a matter of fact, sometimes your mom

795
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:30,370
used to sing them with me on TV.

796
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,773
Mom, you never even told me that!

797
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:32,869
I mentioned it.

798
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:34,949
Remember our winter song?
That was our best one.

799
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:36,311
No, I don't remember that one.

800
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:37,406
Sure you do.

801
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:38,846
We sang it 1,000 times.

802
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,715
I love you. Come on, please.
No one's watching.

803
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:42,855
Only for you.

804
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:44,353
Ready?

805
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:48,893
<i>Button up your overcoat
in the wintry breeze</i>

806
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:53,055
<i>Take good care of yourself
'cause it's nine degrees!</i>

807
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:54,691
Good job, Mom.

808
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,766
Do the spin.

809
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:58,768
Okay.
I'll never shop at Bloomingdale's again.

810
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:00,736
You still got it, kiddo.

811
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,603
That was great.

812
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:04,701
All right, now...

813
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,101
you've got to try this on.
I'm dying to see this on you.

814
00:35:07,269 --> 00:35:08,577
- Okay.
- Okay.

815
00:35:08,771 --> 00:35:12,981
Mom. She cannot wear
a cocktail dress to the audition.

816
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:15,416
I'd like to feel that
you're listening to me.

817
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:17,331
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Did you say something?

818
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:18,620
No, no.

819
00:35:18,814 --> 00:35:20,760
Look at this. This is a hot little number.

820
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,828
Oh, not for her. For me.

821
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,795
Cue the band.

822
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:32,194
Hey. What are you doing?

823
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:33,872
Guarding the door.

824
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:35,040
Can I go in?

825
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,368
Not today, sir.

826
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:37,599
Is he crying?

827
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:39,940
He doesn't cry, he makes the face.

828
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,706
I didn't mean to upset him.

829
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:45,976
You should've used your exit shoes.

830
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:46,811
My What?

831
00:35:47,008 --> 00:35:50,478
Exit shoes, to walk away
and not use a red voice.

832
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:52,248
And a red voice is...?

833
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:56,452
Super-mad sounding.
You shouldn't use it. Never.

834
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:59,825
That's why you have a cool toolbox.

835
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:02,194
It's where you keep your cool blue voice,

836
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,429
your exit shoes and your repair squares.

837
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:06,232
Where did you learn all this?

838
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:07,337
Preschool.

839
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:09,735
You mean, there are more kids like you?

840
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:12,741
I'm doomed. All right, I'm going in there.

841
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,311
What's in it for me?

842
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:21,185
Thank you.

843
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:23,512
The little capitalist.

844
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:28,289
Hi, there.

845
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:32,294
All right, so I am taking a repair
square out of my cool toolbox...

846
00:36:32,486 --> 00:36:35,262
to say in my blue voice, that I am sorry.

847
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:38,102
So, are we good now?

848
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:39,200
No.

849
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:41,031
- Would you like five dollars?
- No.

850
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:43,936
An unopened package
of men's size 34 underwear?

851
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:44,939
No.

852
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:46,975
Is there anything I can do
to make this right?

853
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:50,474
W-Well, th-there is one thing.

854
00:36:56,576 --> 00:36:59,853
They made six of these?

855
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:01,692
<i>No.</i>

856
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:04,857
Now, this is Artie's idea of fun.

857
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:07,664
Look at that.

858
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:10,164
Who knew ice cream could be a cake?

859
00:37:10,357 --> 00:37:12,359
Yeah. All right, now here's the deal.

860
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,936
Just little pieces...

861
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:17,164
and you don't tell Mommy
about the movie...

862
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:20,037
and I don't tell her about the cake.

863
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:22,940
Okay? All right? Deal? Friends again?

864
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:23,909
High five! All right.

865

Back to you, Herb.

878
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,894
Oh, it's your dad, I'll be right in.

879
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:18,829
Hi!

880
00:38:19,023 --> 00:38:20,525
Today is your lucky day, Ms. Rosen.

881
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:23,331
The catfish just jumped
right into your frying pan.

882
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,906
Yeah, Artie Decker, "De Voice" is in town.

883
00:38:26,097 --> 00:38:28,509
He heard about your X Games
and he would love to audition.

884
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,544
I'm just walking in.
Video chat me in 2 minutes, okay?

885
00:38:31,736 --> 00:38:34,342
Hi, Artie, we're back!
Did you have fun with the boys?

886
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,546
Look at this place!
We're going to have to call FEMA!

887
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:39,448
Cake.

888
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:41,385
- Where's Artie?
- He left!

889
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:42,557
He left?

890
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:44,055
If your mother sees this...

891
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,193
What's going on?

892
00:38:46,584 --> 00:38:48,086
Hi.

893
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,421
What did you do?

894
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:51,430
I just got here!

895
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,931
You gave them cake?

896
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,569
I gave them slivers.

897
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,102
Why? Why, Artie?

898
00:38:56,394 --> 00:38:58,965
Because he upset Turner at Speech Class.

899
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:00,124
- What?
- It was nothing.

900
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:01,468
I just asked a question.

901
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:03,045
"Why is nobody speaking?" That's all.

902
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,442
<i>Hello, lave!</i>

903
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:09,277
<i>I can't wait for
you to get here, me little rabbit.</i>

904
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,020
Not now! My.

905
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,878
Did he have a tattoo?

906
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,458
Harper?

907
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,196
Mom! You lied to me!

908
00:39:22,386 --> 00:39:24,093
Yogurt is not like ice cream!

909
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:25,223
No, honey.

910
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:28,733
Baby?

911
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:31,736
- My favorite!
- Harper!

912
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:41,913
This perfectly sums up
your entire approach to parenting.

913
00:39:42,105 --> 00:39:43,083
We had an approach?

914
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:44,251
I don't know.

915
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:48,048
<i>Would Artie and
Turner like to continue watching Saw?</i>

916
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:50,225
You must be mistaken.

917
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:52,325
<i>Saw, Rated R for strong graphic violence,</i>

918
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:53,622
<i>nudity and language.</i>

919
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:54,817
No.

920
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:56,626
<i>Why did he give them cake?</i>

921
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:59,160
Because he does what he wants
and she defends him!

922
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,390
Where are the kids now?

923
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:03,235
Oh, I put them
on the treadmill until they calm down.

924
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:05,929
<i>I told you my parents cauldn't handle this.</i>

925
00:40:06,128 --> 00:40:09,109
Maybe it's just a case
of first-day, worst-day.

926
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:13,303
Hey. You better hurry up.
You're going to miss your flight.

927
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:15,983
Honey, I don't think
that I should go today.

928
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,039
Maybe I should go tomorrow morning.

929
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,084
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

930
00:40:19,675 --> 00:40:21,245
<i>We 'll still have four days together.</i>

931
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:22,585
<i>Okay.</i>

932
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:23,984
You look good in cake.

933
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,126
What in the world is wrong with you?

934
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:32,827
What did I say?

935
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:34,524
What did I say to you?

936
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,845
Just talk to me. Don't yell.

937
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,905
I said, "Artie,
this is a second chance for us."

938
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:39,370
I said, "Artie, please behave."

939
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,133
I said, "Artie, I really want
those kids to love us!"

940
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:45,005
Or can't you remember
all the way back to yesterday?

941
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,179
Okay, that's what I did.

942
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:48,348
When the cake
went in their mouths they loved me!

943
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,484
Yeah, and now Alice
doesn't want to leave us alone with them.

944
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:52,651
She doesn't trust us!

945
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:53,819
She said that?

946
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:55,454
On the phone to Phil.

947
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:58,651
I accidentally overheard her
when I was listening at the door.

948
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,492
She thinks we're a pair of knuckleheads.

949
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:03,193
Especially you!

950
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:08,660
It's the bottom of the ninth, Artie.

951
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,700
We're going to lose the game.

952
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:12,333
Shape UP-

953
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,354
Wonderful.

954
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,160
Bravo.

955
00:41:42,222 --> 00:41:45,533
Harper, that was wonderful!

956
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:46,704
I stunk.

957
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:47,975
You most certainly did not!

958
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:51,504
Wasn't she wonderful?

959
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:52,507
No.

960
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,873
This will not be good enough
for your audition!

961
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:56,571
You must practice more!

962
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,410
When my daughter underperforms,
I shun her.

963
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:01,609
This girl should be shunned!

964
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:05,080
Practice, practice, practice!

965
00:42:05,913 --> 00:42:07,517
Gee whiz.

966
00:42:07,715 --> 00:42:10,594
Wasn't she the villain
in the last James Bond movie?

967
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,925
Sweetie, don't listen to her.

968
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:17,264
You know back in Amarillo,
when Artie was announcing there...

969
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,699
I got this audition
to be the local weather girl.

970
00:42:19,893 --> 00:42:21,804
Well, I was so uptight.

971
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:25,273
Artie took me out the night before and we
both got bombed!

972
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:27,537
And the next day I got the job.

973
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:29,771
So, you're saying I should drink?

974
00:42:31,038 --> 00:42:32,778
No, no, no. I'm not saying that.

975
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:35,612
I am saying that perhaps you could relax.

976
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:37,208
You could go out with your friends.

977
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:40,120
You could have some fun Friday night.
You know?

978
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:43,858
Friday, I was invited to a...

979
00:42:48,154 --> 00:42:48,996
No.

980
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:50,266
No, no, no!

981
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,099
I have three more days!
I have to practice! I have to...

982
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:56,933
I have to practice every second!

983
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,877
Doctor Schveer?

984
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:03,472
Yes?

985
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,445
Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot.

986
00:43:05,638 --> 00:43:06,810
But I would like to let you know that...

987
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,646
if you ever speak
to my granddaughter like that again...

988
00:43:09,842 --> 00:43:11,203
there will be nothing left of you,

989
00:43:11,244 --> 00:43:12,524
but some red hair and an accent!

990
00:43:12,712 --> 00:43:14,487
Is that clear, comrade?

991
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:40,713
Thank you. Here you go.

992
00:43:44,576 --> 00:43:45,577
Carcinogens.

993
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:48,011
Oh, the first one just laid a base.

994
00:43:48,113 --> 00:43:50,593
This is the real thing.
I'm at the ballpark.

995
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:56,491
He likes baseball?

996
00:43:56,688 --> 00:43:57,666
Yeah, he likes lots of things.

997
00:43:57,856 --> 00:44:01,360
He likes sports.
He likes science, he likes movies.

998
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,868
He likes cake.

999
00:44:03,061 --> 00:44:04,233
Touché.

1000
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:07,941
He's just hidden behind that... stutter.

1001
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:10,739
Well, you know, kids have a way
of working these things out.

1002
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:12,214
No, they don't, Dad.

1003
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:14,077
That's why there's prison.

1004
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:17,735
All right, guys, bring it in!

1005
00:44:17,776 --> 00:44:19,456
Bring it in! Get all those hands in there.

1006
00:44:19,543 --> 00:44:20,453
Come on.

1007
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:23,921
Everybody on three. One, two, three...

1008
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:26,061
Let's have fun!

1009
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:29,798
I am so excited about this.

1010
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:31,265
Let's play!

1011
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:32,365
He's pitching!

1012
00:44:32,556 --> 00:44:33,296
Yeah.

1013
00:44:33,491 --> 00:44:34,492
He has a good arm.

1014
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:35,570
Like Mom, like son.

1015
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,738
Yeah, right.

1016
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,270
No, you had a hose.

1017
00:44:38,462 --> 00:44:40,203
But then you hit puberty
and you got all girlie on me.

1018
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:42,399
Well, gee, Dad,
I'm so sorry that I hit puberty.

1019
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,880
I was so proud of you back then.

1020
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,607
You were usually the only girl out there.

1021
00:44:46,003 --> 00:44:48,210
You used to stand up to those stinky boys.

1022
00:44:48,405 --> 00:44:50,316
Do you remember that summer
when you worked for me in the booth...

1023
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:52,249
keeping score and doing stats?

1024
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:53,820
You were so cute, sitting there

1025
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:55,948
scrunched over your little pencil.

1026
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:58,048
You never saw that ball coming, did you?

1027
00:44:58,149 --> 00:44:59,429
You could have yelled "Incoming"

1028
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,370
I was on the air.
I didn't want to start a panic.

1029
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:03,260
You do love that job.

1030
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:04,489
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1031
00:45:04,688 --> 00:45:05,666
Yeah, I do.

1032
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:06,834
Batter up!

1033
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,638
This is that bully kid.

1034
00:45:09,827 --> 00:45:10,998
Yeah, Ivan.

1035
00:45:11,194 --> 00:45:13,572
I would so like to see
Turner strike him out.

1036
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:24,610
Strike!

1037
00:45:25,041 --> 00:45:28,284
Strike one!
Hey, he is really good. He's really good.

1038
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:29,957
Way to go, Turner!

1039
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:31,124
Turner Simmons on the mound...

1040
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:33,794
a young Cuban prospect
who escaped on a raft.

1041
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:35,428
He's facing Ivan, a miserable child

1042
00:45:35,518 --> 00:45:37,119
who is loathed and despised by everyone.

1043
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,155
Dad!

1044
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,964
Swing and a miss! Strike two!

1045
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,664
One more strike and it's back

1046
00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:47,298
to the dugout
for this eight-year-old bullfrog.

1047
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:48,407
Dad...

1048
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:51,737
The yearbook said
Ivan is "Most likely to do time."

1049
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,113
Simmons looks at him.

1050
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:58,408
He shakes it off.

1051
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:03,656
Here's the pitch.

1052
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,317
Strike three!
You're out of there!

1053
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,587
Lights out, Alice!

1054
00:46:14,056 --> 00:46:16,002
Way to go, Turner! Way to look!

1055
00:46:16,258 --> 00:46:18,704
Blue, Blue! That's three strikes!

1056
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,007
One, two, three! Out of there!

1057
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,504
Time!

1058
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:24,000
It's okay!

1059
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,270
This is my dad and he's new here!

1060
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:29,208
Oh, okay. There are no outs in this game.

1061
00:46:29,872 --> 00:46:31,715
No outs? How is that possible?

1062
00:46:31,907 --> 00:46:35,445
They hit until they get on base.

1063
00:46:35,644 --> 00:46:37,351
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

1064
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:39,184
Dad, why don't we just sit down?

1065
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:42,127
All right.

1066
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:44,285
But you know that's kind of stupid!

1067
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,832
Because if you just think of the song...

1068
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:49,298
<i>'Cause it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out...</i>

1069
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:50,834
<i>at the old ball game</i>

1070
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:51,731
Not...

1071
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:53,304
<i>until you get a hit</i>

1072
00:46:53,495 --> 00:46:55,975
He's right!
I hate these games! What's the point?

1073
00:46:56,164 --> 00:46:58,734
The point is for the kids
to enjoy the game without competition.

1074
00:46:58,933 --> 00:47:00,310
Yeah, but competition is the game.

1075
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:01,571
You know, it's like life.

1076
00:47:01,769 --> 00:47:02,873
Let me ask you something.

1077
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,750
I mean, how do you even
know who's winning?

1078
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:06,318
In this league, we don't keep score.

1079
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:09,878
Every game ends in a tie.

1080
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,319
Oh, no.

1081
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:15,585
No agony of defeat? Just
the thrill of a tie?

1082
00:47:15,783 --> 00:47:17,353
It's good they don't keep score!

1083
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:18,859
Yeah, 'cause your kid stinks.

1084
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:20,589
Oh, I will bust you up!

1085
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:22,358
The old guy's right. It's boring.

1086
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:23,193
See?

1087
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,132
It is not boring!

1088
00:47:25,493 --> 00:47:27,302
They're children and they're having fun!

1089
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:29,839
And there's plenty of time
in their lives to keep score!

1090
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:31,476
- And you are out!
- No, I'm not.

1091
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,577
Oh, yeah. Turner, you struck him out.

1092
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:34,974
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

1093
00:47:35,169 --> 00:47:35,977
- You're out.
- No, I'm not!

1094
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:36,875
- You're out!
- No, I'm not!

1095
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:38,175
- Three strikes, you're out!
- No, I'm not!

1096
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:39,510
Barker, what's going on?

1097
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:41,311
Farty is going crazy.

1098
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:42,487
Again?

1099
00:47:42,677 --> 00:47:44,054
- You're out!
- No, you're out!

1100
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:49,919
Ivan, no hitting!
Use your words!

1101
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:51,527
Yes, Mom.

1102
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:56,064
I'm angry that you said I was out.

1103
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:05,834
Well, it's not boring anymore.

1104
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,277
How is this Artie's fault?

1105
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,109
All I saw was
that little monster grab a baseball bat...

1106
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,683
and hit your father in his...
special place.

1107
00:48:14,874 --> 00:48:17,081
Well, you didn't see what led up to it.

1108
00:48:19,446 --> 00:48:21,357
- It was my fault.
- Oh, honey.

1109
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:23,455
You threatened her violin teacher?

1110
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:25,085
She says "threatened."

1111
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:27,390
I say "defended my granddaughter."

1112
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,091
- Phil?
- Hey.

1113
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,396
Hey, we won. I won!

1114
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,767
I won! Can you believe it?

1115
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:37,908
Oh, my gosh!

1116
00:48:38,098 --> 00:48:40,704
That's fantastic! That's fantastic!

1117
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,776
- Daddy won!
- Congrats, Dad!

1118
00:48:42,968 --> 00:48:45,778
So, they're
giving me the award tomorrow night.

1119
00:48:45,971 --> 00:48:47,075
When are you getting here?

1120
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,232
You don't know
what's going on here. It's madness.

1121
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,584
We can't leave our children
with my parents.

1122
00:48:51,777 --> 00:48:53,984
So, what are you saying?
That you're not coming?

1123
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:56,625
Phil, please listen to me.
Try to understand.

1124
00:48:56,815 --> 00:48:57,793
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1125
00:48:57,983 --> 00:49:00,293
Yeah. I understand perfectly.

1126
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:01,556
All right.

1127
00:49:03,655 --> 00:49:04,963
See you when I get back.

1128
00:49:09,762 --> 00:49:11,708
Okay. We're going home.

1129
00:49:11,897 --> 00:49:12,875
No.

1130
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:14,233
No?

1131
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:15,437
Artie and the kids are going home.

1132
00:49:15,634 --> 00:49:17,580
I am taking you to the airport.

1133
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:18,475
What?

1134
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,741
Alice, your dad and I have

1135
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:22,978
bent over backwards
to try to do things your way.

1136
00:49:23,175 --> 00:49:24,984
You haven't bent over at all.

1137
00:49:25,177 --> 00:49:27,316
Oh, I'm bent. Believe me, I'm bent.

1138
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:29,049
Now, look. You asked us to come here

1139
00:49:29,148 --> 00:49:30,252
and take care of our grandchildren...

1140
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:32,224
and you haven't given
us the chance to do it.

1141
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,727
You have been on our backs,
especially your dad's...

1142
00:49:34,919 --> 00:49:35,897
ever since we got here!

1143
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,296
Okay, take his side,
because you always do anyway.

1144
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:40,560
And for a good reason.

1145
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:42,533
Because after your kids grow up,

1146
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,468
your husband is the one who stays.

1147
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:47,302
Alice, I know
you're trying to be a perfect parent...

1148
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,842
but, honey, there's no such thing.

1149
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:52,241
And frankly, you need to show Phil...

1150
00:49:52,437 --> 00:49:56,146
he's not just their father,
he's also your husband.

1151
00:49:56,974 --> 00:49:59,682
Alice, I'm your mom.
Take it from me, I really get it.

1152
00:49:59,877 --> 00:50:02,448
"Love the man, love the dream."

1153
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:04,456
Well, your husband's dream
is coming true...

1154
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:07,289
and part of that dream
is you being there with him!

1155
00:50:07,485 --> 00:50:09,294
How can you not go?

1156
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:11,124
Oh, honey, you have to go.

1157
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:13,263
You're going!

1158
00:50:13,658 --> 00:50:14,864
What about my clothes?

1159
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:16,131
I don't think he wants you in clothes.

1160
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:17,635
Besides, your luggage is already there.

1161
00:50:17,829 --> 00:50:20,139
Hey, kids, Mommy's finally going.

1162
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:21,708
What about my audition?

1163
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:23,674
I'll take care of it! It'll be fantastic!

1164
00:50:23,868 --> 00:50:25,040
See you at the ranch.

1165
00:50:25,236 --> 00:50:26,510
No. Bye!

1166
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:27,681
This is a happy day-

1167
00:50:27,871 --> 00:50:29,976
<i>Happy day</i>

1168
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:33,381
Could you drive? I don't feel good.

1169
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:03,517
Gonna stand
there gawking? Gonna let me in?

1170
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:22,426
No score here in the bottom
of the seventh with 2 outs.

1171
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:25,697
The Giants and the Atlanta
Braves locked into a pitching duel.

1172
00:51:25,895 --> 00:51:27,875
Lincecum and Hudson,
both have been fantastic.

1173
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:31,670
As Buster Posey steps in,
takes a strike in the inside corner.

1174
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:34,609
I got to tell you friends,
this is one of those nights...

1175
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:39,013
72 degrees, 45,000 fans,
smell of the popcorn, the hot dogs...

1176
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,449
all of those clichés,
but I'll tell you something...

1177
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:43,681
there's no other place I'd rather be.

1178
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:45,916
Posey hits
a line drive to third and that'll do it.

1179
00:51:46,115 --> 00:51:48,026
That's it, no score through seven.

1180
00:51:48,217 --> 00:51:52,597
We'll be back. This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Giants.

1181
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:03,139
<i>Reminder: No school today.</i>

1182
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,278
<i>You have tickets for the symphony.</i>

1183
00:52:06,802 --> 00:52:08,713
What's wrong with your face?

1184
00:52:08,904 --> 00:52:10,705
Oh, and you're such
a pleasure in the morning?

1185
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,280
You're not going to like this.

1186
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:17,545
Barker!

1187
00:52:24,986 --> 00:52:26,021
Is it coming off?

1188
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,531
Well, not exactly.

1189
00:52:27,722 --> 00:52:30,259
Sorry, Farty.

1190
00:52:35,563 --> 00:52:36,541
Let's go!

1191
00:52:36,731 --> 00:52:38,733
I gotta go number two!
I gotta go number two!

1192
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,538
No, we're already late!

1193
00:52:40,735 --> 00:52:42,214
Artie, just take him.

1194
00:52:42,403 --> 00:52:44,246
All right. Okay, batter up! Let's go.

1195
00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:47,215
No, no, he can hold it, guys.
He's fine, he can hold it!

1196
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:48,614
The symphony starts at two!

1197
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:52,657
Quarter?

1198
00:52:52,747 --> 00:52:53,817
Not today, thank you.

1199
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:55,321
Okay.

1200
00:52:55,516 --> 00:52:56,995
- Hey, buddy.
- Sorry!

1201
00:52:58,253 --> 00:52:58,753
So sorry.

1202
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:00,288
That's not human.

1203
00:53:01,522 --> 00:53:03,331
- Hurry up!
- Yeah.

1204
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:06,100
Okay. Here we go.

1205
00:53:06,293 --> 00:53:07,897
Yeah.

1206
00:53:08,128 --> 00:53:09,232
Okay, there you go.

1207
00:53:09,429 --> 00:53:11,466
I can't sit on that.

1208
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:12,939
I'll give you 10 bucks.

1209
00:53:13,133 --> 00:53:15,170
Daddy always sings to me.

1210
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:22,443
<i>Come out, come out, Mr. Daodie...</i>

1211
00:53:22,643 --> 00:53:26,352
<i>and swim in the swimming pool</i>

1212
00:53:26,546 --> 00:53:30,494
<i>I know it's dark where you're hiding...</i>

1213
00:53:30,684 --> 00:53:34,632
<i>but out here it's really coal</i>

1214
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:41,537
<i>Come on, come on, Mr. Daodie...</i>

1215
00:53:41,728 --> 00:53:45,266
<i>'cause we've got something to do</i>

1216
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:49,306
<i>And if you hurry...</i>

1217
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:53,645
<i>you 'll meet Carl the kangaroo</i>

1218
00:53:55,409 --> 00:53:56,547
Yes!

1219
00:53:57,411 --> 00:53:59,981
Hey, buddy, can you keep singing?

1220
00:54:01,681 --> 00:54:04,252
<i>Come out, come out, Mr.</i>

1221
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,297
Come on.

1222
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:09,864
He's still out there! We're okay!
We're okay!

1223
00:54:10,056 --> 00:54:11,592
Nothing's the matter.

1224
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:14,863
Thank you very much.

1225
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,701
This way. Come on, honey.

1226
00:54:20,633 --> 00:54:22,044
Oh, we made it.

1227
00:54:23,602 --> 00:54:27,049
Big crowd. Must be helmet night.

1228
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:31,684
It wasn't that funny.

1229
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:57,007
Carl and I want to leave.

1230
00:54:57,202 --> 00:54:58,374
Don't leave your seat.

1231
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,878
You said "don't."

1232
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:01,982
Consider the consequences, mister.

1233
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:04,914
It's not me, it's him.

1234
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:07,517
I'm sorry. Kids.

1235
00:55:09,547 --> 00:55:11,527
Barker? Barker?

1236
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,389
Hey, come back here!

1237
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:19,391
Don't go "no". Yes! Get.

1238
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,840
Who brings a child to Tchaikovsky?

1239
00:55:32,036 --> 00:55:34,209
Me. Voodoo-man.

1240
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,810
Carl, come on!

1241
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,386
- Gr-Grandma?
- Yes, dear?

1242
00:55:40,578 --> 00:55:42,615
Artie's ch-chasing Barker.

1243
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:44,656
Oh, that's nice, dear.

1244
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:47,126
What?

1245
00:55:50,154 --> 00:55:52,532
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1246
00:55:52,723 --> 00:55:55,169
Excuse me. Barker! Get back here!

1247
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,997
- Stop it!
- Barker!

1248
00:55:57,194 --> 00:55:58,332
Oh, my...!

1249
00:55:58,529 --> 00:55:59,974
Where is he?

1250
00:56:00,164 --> 00:56:01,837
- Over there!
- Barker!

1251
00:56:02,032 --> 00:56:03,136
Barker!

1252
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,311
Carl!

1253
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:06,708
Get over here!

1254
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:09,447
Let's see.

1255
00:56:11,642 --> 00:56:12,985
- Artie?
- I'm sorry!

1256
00:56:13,177 --> 00:56:14,554
I can't take this anymore!

1257
00:56:14,745 --> 00:56:17,851
This whole "teachable moments"
and protecting their self-esteem...

1258
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:19,356
and nobody gets punished!

1259
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,655
And every game ends in a tie!

1260
00:56:22,186 --> 00:56:24,393
All I hear is
"Use your words. Use your words".

1261
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:27,694
But the word
they never use with these kids is "no"!

1262
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:38,370
Come on, Mr. Decker.

1263
00:56:38,568 --> 00:56:40,849
The other patients
are waiting for you in Arts and Crafts.

1264
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:42,516
One second.

1265
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:44,480
I am very sorry for what happened here.

1266
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:47,484
Just split it with her.

1267
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,852
Thank you.

1268
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:50,820
Savages.

1269
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:11,637
Well, he'll be there.

1270
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:14,007
Yeah, Artie Decker.
You're going to love him. He's a pro's pro.

1271
00:57:14,203 --> 00:57:16,479
Tomorrow, 11 AM, Piedmont Park.

1272
00:57:16,672 --> 00:57:18,015
I'll see... He'll see you then.

1273
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:20,346
All right, bye now.

1274
00:57:20,543 --> 00:57:22,420
Piedmont Park, map.

1275
00:57:23,513 --> 00:57:24,514
Dinner!

1276
00:57:25,081 --> 00:57:26,185
Who was that?

1277
00:57:26,382 --> 00:57:28,658
Market research.
Always at dinner time. How do they know?

1278
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:32,525
Hey, kids, would you sit down?

1279
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:35,690
I have something I want to clear up.
Something's bothering me.

1280
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:36,995
I just want to say...

1281
00:57:37,192 --> 00:57:40,503
I was never, ever
going to actually spank Barker.

1282
00:57:41,196 --> 00:57:42,476
But you threatened to spank him.

1283
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:43,575
But I never was going to do it.

1284
00:57:43,765 --> 00:57:45,767
- But he didn't know that.
- That's why it worked.

1285
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:49,081
- There we go!
- It looks great!

1286
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:50,249
Thank you, honey.

1287
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:52,509
Th-This isn't what-what we asked for.

1288
00:57:52,707 --> 00:57:55,244
Yes, I know. I got your e-mails. But...

1289
00:57:55,443 --> 00:57:57,389
This is how a family eats.

1290
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:00,685
We all sit at one table
and we all eat the same thing.

1291
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:02,190
It's not how we eat.

1292
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:03,795
But you know something, Barker...

1293
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:06,522
Grandma worked very hard
to make your mom's recipe...

1294
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:08,257
just the way that your mom makes it...

1295
00:58:08,456 --> 00:58:11,266
so I think that we owe her the
courtesy of eating it and enjoying it.

1296
00:58:11,526 --> 00:58:14,097
Oh, honey, thank you. That is so sweet.

1297
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:19,813
I'm going to order a pizza. Who's in?

1298
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:30,286
Hey, you've been sitting here for hours.

1299
00:58:30,477 --> 00:58:32,286
Are you playing a game?

1300
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:34,390
That looks like fun.
Do you just press it here?

1301
00:58:34,582 --> 00:58:35,560
No, no, no!

1302
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:36,650
<i>Game aver.</i>

1303
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:40,254
Sorry.

1304
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:42,996
Turner, let me ask you a question.

1305
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,671
You ever watch the X Games?
Stuff like that?

1306
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:46,929
<i>S-S-Sometimes.</i>

1307
00:58:47,127 --> 00:58:48,834
Yeah. Do you think you know the lingo?

1308
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:53,671
You mean like "h-heinous,"
or "gn-gnarled out," or "n-nose bone"?

1309
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:54,902
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

1310
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:57,844
Listen, how about later I tuck you
in and we talk more about this?

1311
00:58:58,038 --> 00:59:02,077
S-Sure. Except for the t-tucking in.
I'm eight.

1312
00:59:02,276 --> 00:59:03,254
Okay, I get it.

1313
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:06,084
And, listen, I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you the other day.

1314
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,123
Wh-Which day was th-that?

1315
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,351
Touché.

1316
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:11,952
One other thing.

1317
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:15,826
This Ivan kid, he's a punk.
Stand up to him.

1318
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:20,166
Anything he starts,
you can finish. Believe in yourself.

1319
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,966
And once you believe
in yourself, you can do anything.

1320
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:25,836
You can look trouble right in the eye
and just wink at it.

1321
00:59:26,032 --> 00:59:28,273
And everything will be okay.
It's all attitude.

1322
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:30,272
Now, how do you turn this on?

1323
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,381
Th-That's just a t-table.

1324
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,613
Okay, let's go.

1325
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:43,488
<i>Goodbye, Harper,
Turner, Barker, Diane and Farty Decker.</i>

1326
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:44,684
She did that on purpose.

1327
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:46,725
Remember, you're taking Barker
for a play date.

1328
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:47,854
Okay.

1329
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:49,831
Alice says this is very,
very important.

1330
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:51,024
They're still new here...

1331
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:53,465
and Barker hasn't had
a chance to make new friends, okay?

1332
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:54,571
I got it.

1333
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:55,967
Bye, Barker.

1334
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:57,140
Bye.

1335
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,243
Let me ask you something.

1336
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,300
This play date kid, he's imaginary, too?

1337
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:03,641
- No.
- How will I know how to get there?

1338
01:00:03,836 --> 01:00:06,180
Use the R-life.
Turner already punched in the address.

1339
01:00:06,372 --> 01:00:08,749
Okay. Di, can you pick up
Barker after the play date?

1340
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,886
Pick him up? You're supposed
to stay with him the whole time.

1341
01:00:11,076 --> 01:00:12,996
What? When did his play date
become my play date?

1342
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:14,649
I can't help you! I got to go, hon.

1343
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:15,756
No, I..

1344
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:17,259
Okay.

1345
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:18,894
- Bye.
- Bye. Have fun!

1346
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:19,892
Okay.

1347
01:00:20,085 --> 01:00:21,996
All right. Have a good time!

1348
01:00:22,187 --> 01:00:24,929
We're going to
have a great time at the play date!

1349
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:27,103
How would you like to ditch this play date?

1350
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,499
I hate play dates. No one talks to Carl.

1351
01:00:29,695 --> 01:00:30,975
Well, how rude are those people?

1352
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:32,938
Would you like to do something fun
with me?

1353
01:00:33,131 --> 01:00:34,735
Great. All right, let's go.

1354
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:37,343
R-life, find me a mall.

1355
01:00:42,374 --> 01:00:43,944
Do you guys want to go
to the skatepark later?

1356
01:00:44,142 --> 01:00:45,712
I-I-Ivan!

1357
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:48,948
What do you want, T-T-Turner?

1358
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:50,285
Listen, p-punk!

1359
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:52,587
Anything that you start...

1360
01:00:52,784 --> 01:00:54,889
I-I can f-finish!

1361
01:00:57,923 --> 01:01:00,233
We were at our locker and he ran up...

1362
01:01:00,425 --> 01:01:02,961
and it was such an awkward silence.
I had no idea what to say.

1363
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,764
So, are you coming to my party?

1364
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,909
Oh, hi. Oh, I don't think that I can.

1365
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,579
I got to go. See you tonight, I hope.

1366
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,637
Oh, please don't go.

1367
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,577
He so likes you.

1368
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:28,623
So, Tony, are you
going to bust a 900 today, dude?

1369
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:31,163
Or are you going show us
something that's going to blow our minds.

1370
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,493
Something we've never seen before?

1371
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,828
I don't know. Maybe I'll try a 900...

1372
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,104
and then give you a tattoo
right in the middle of it.

1373
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,632
Come on! We're late!

1374
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:39,171
But I have to go pee-pee!

1375
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,172
I don't have a song for that.

1376
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:58,515
Sorry.

1377
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,720
Talk a little bit about that
particular night and you hitting the 900.

1378
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,523
It wasn't something I planned to do.

1379
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:06,191
It was just I had hit my best...

1380
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,360
I got to go pee!

1381
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,902
How does it feel to be back in Atlanta?

1382
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,905
Hey, I'm here.
Sorry I'm late. Motorcycle trouble.

1383
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:18,042
I'm Artie "Mad Dog" Decker!
What's up, homeslice?

1384
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,212
You're Artie Decker?

1385
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,904
Reporting for duty.

1386
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:22,415
We up for the same job?

1387
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,550
I hope not.

1388
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,420
Wait a second. You don't know who this is?

1389
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:26,678
Of course I do.

1390
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,579
Dude, this is Tony Hawk, man!

1391
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:30,883
Yeah, Tony Hawkman. How you doing?

1392
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,058
All right.

1393
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,727
- Who's the kid?
- This is my agent.

1394
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,228
Too many facelifts.

1395
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:37,829
If he gets one more,
he's going back in time.

1396
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,729
I'm going to go take my runs.

1397
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:46,207
So, how do we roll?

1398
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:47,430
How do we roll?

1399
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:48,699
Well, we roll this way.

1400
01:02:48,897 --> 01:02:50,417
The riders are practicing, so you just

1401
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:51,978
ad lib like it's the actual event.

1402
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:53,441
Just call it like I see it?

1403
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:55,239
- That's it.
- Okay, dope.

1404
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:57,110
Hey, can't have a kid up here, man.

1405
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:58,580
No, no, no. Kid's with me. He's fine.

1406
01:02:58,774 --> 01:02:59,616
We're just going to go right over there.

1407
01:02:59,808 --> 01:03:01,788
I promise you,
everything's going to be good.

1408
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,891
You sit right here. Okay?

1409
01:03:07,082 --> 01:03:08,789
Carl and I have to go pee-pee.

1410
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:09,792
Just give me one minute...

1411
01:03:09,985 --> 01:03:11,896
and I promise
you can do all the peeing that you want.

1412
01:03:12,087 --> 01:03:13,225
But we really...

1413
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,628
Farty has spoken.

1414
01:03:14,823 --> 01:03:16,734
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah, coming.

1415
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:21,263
- Okay.
- Go! Go, go.

1416
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:22,441
Hello there, everybody!

1417
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:23,905
It's a beautiful day
and thanks for coming out!

1418
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:25,169
- Here's one...
- Cut!

1419
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,176
- What?
- He's finished. The run's over.

1420
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:28,977
All right.

1421
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:31,117
Give me one more chance.
I'm just warming up.

1422
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:32,944
Hey, even Sinatra cleared his throat.

1423
01:03:33,141 --> 01:03:34,347
All right, pops, come on. Try to keep up.

1424
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:36,181
Ready? Three, two...

1425
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:41,117
It is on and it is epic.

1426
01:03:41,315 --> 01:03:43,591
We're expecting to see
a frontside heelflip 540...

1427
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:46,958
990 body varial with a Cab 7 Melon Grab.

1428
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:48,565
Melon Grab, my cousin got arrested

1429
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:49,977
on the subway for melon-grabbing.

1430
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:56,632
Tony started when he was very young.

1431
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:58,267
He actually skated out of his mother.

1432
01:03:58,466 --> 01:03:59,536
Can I ask you something?
I wonder about this.

1433
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:01,475
- Absolutely.
- How do you practice these tricks...

1434
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:02,704
before you get really good at them?

1435
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:06,317
Do you say, "I'm just
going to do this. Somebody get a mop"?

1436
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:08,350
Wait. Is that a kid on the half-pipe?

1437
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:09,644
Barker!

1438
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:11,846
Barker!

1439
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:15,990
Barker, what are you doing?

1440
01:04:16,517 --> 01:04:18,053
I told you I had to pee.

1441
01:04:18,252 --> 01:04:19,452
Is all that coming out of you?

1442
01:04:19,587 --> 01:04:21,624
- I saved it up.
- When? Since birth?

1443
01:04:42,108 --> 01:04:44,179
What you did back there
was pretty dangerous.

1444
01:04:44,377 --> 01:04:45,185
Do you know that?

1445
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:46,914
Carl told me to do it.

1446
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:51,194
I don't think Carl is being
a very good friend to you.

1447
01:04:51,384 --> 01:04:53,887
For a kangaroo,
he's something of a thrill-seeker.

1448
01:04:54,087 --> 01:04:57,591
And I think it's time
that you start telling Carl what to do.

1449
01:04:58,091 --> 01:04:59,229
One other thing.

1450
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,562
I was supposed to...

1451
01:05:02,262 --> 01:05:05,709
watch after you today,
and I didn't do a good job.

1452
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,104
I'm sorry.

1453
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:12,114
So, Farty would appreciate it...

1454
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:14,148
if when we get home...

1455
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:17,781
you don't tell
anyone what happened. Okay?

1456
01:05:18,578 --> 01:05:20,057
Twenty bucks.

1457
01:05:21,348 --> 01:05:22,156
Deal.

1458
01:05:22,582 --> 01:05:24,323
Let's go home. Come on.

1459
01:05:29,688 --> 01:05:31,429
Carl, come on.

1460
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:35,765
- How could you?
- What?

1461
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:36,939
You think I don't know?

1462
01:05:37,129 --> 01:05:38,335
I want my 20 bucks back.

1463
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:39,736
He's just a little boy!

1464
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:40,910
He's fine.

1465
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,080
Fine? Take a look at him.

1466
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:45,077
Not him. Turner.

1467
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,351
What are you talking about?

1468
01:05:46,438 --> 01:05:50,284
I'm talking about Turner
and that brilliant advice you gave him.

1469
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:54,715
Hey.

1470
01:05:58,183 --> 01:06:00,663
I have to ask, did you hit him back?

1471
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:02,764
- No.
- Why not?

1472
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:04,764
B-Because I hit him f-first.

1473
01:06:04,957 --> 01:06:06,231
Then he...

1474
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:09,099
He started screaming
and s-someone helped him fight me.

1475
01:06:09,294 --> 01:06:10,974
Two against one? How big was this other...

1476
01:06:11,163 --> 01:06:12,767
It was his little sister.

1477
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:13,966
She did this.

1478
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:16,468
Turner, this is all my fault.

1479
01:06:17,136 --> 01:06:19,638
When I said stand
up for yourself, I didn't mean hitting.

1480
01:06:20,371 --> 01:06:21,179
All right, listen.

1481
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:25,109
Oh, boy. The older I get,
the lower the floor gets.

1482
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,147
Turner, can I share something with you?

1483
01:06:29,347 --> 01:06:31,759
Just between me and you.
No one else knows this.

1484
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:33,451
This is just two guys talking.

1485
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:37,258
When I was your age,
I was very shy because I was short.

1486
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:38,934
I didn't talk to anybody.

1487
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:40,534
And my self-esteem...

1488
01:06:40,725 --> 01:06:45,003
You know, the way
I feel about myself, was really bad.

1489
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:46,470
Do you ever feel that way?

1490
01:06:47,532 --> 01:06:50,035
Yeah? Well, you know what? You shouldn't.

1491
01:06:50,234 --> 01:06:51,804
Because you're a great kid.

1492
01:06:52,637 --> 01:06:55,049
All right, I want to play you something.

1493
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:57,515
Hey, house, I want to play something.

1494
01:06:58,076 --> 01:06:59,384
Okay.

1495
01:07:01,612 --> 01:07:02,784
Okay.

1496
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:05,892
Now, the first time I heard this...

1497
01:07:06,084 --> 01:07:09,224
I knew right away that
I had found my voice.

1498
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,366
I knew that I had to become
a baseball announcer.

1499
01:07:12,556 --> 01:07:13,477
And once I knew that...

1500
01:07:13,557 --> 01:07:15,917
it didn't matter what anybody
else thought or said about me.

1501
01:07:16,026 --> 01:07:18,233
Sh-sh-shot heard round the w-world?

1502
01:07:18,428 --> 01:07:20,738
Right. The shot heard round the world.

1503
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:21,931
Let me tell you about it.

1504
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:27,705
It's 1951. Long time ago.

1505
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:30,214
Brooklyn Dodgers,
New York Giants.

1506
01:07:30,407 --> 01:07:31,886
And they hated each other.

1507
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:34,385
L-Like Luke S-Skywalker and D-Darth Vader.

1508
01:07:34,578 --> 01:07:35,556
Worse.

1509
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:38,658
Well, the baseball season ends
and they're tied.

1510
01:07:38,849 --> 01:07:40,419
Now, this one game would decide...

1511
01:07:40,617 --> 01:07:42,119
who would go to the World Series

1512
01:07:42,219 --> 01:07:43,698
against the great New York Yankees.

1513
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,764
Biggest game in the history of New York.

1514
01:07:46,523 --> 01:07:48,161
Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs,

1515
01:07:48,258 --> 01:07:49,862
the Giants are losing 4 to 2...

1516
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:52,631
and a batter
named Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.

1517
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:56,476
<i>Bobby Thomson
up there swinging.</i>

1518
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:57,747
<i>He's had two out of three,</i>

1519
01:07:57,834 --> 01:07:59,040
<i>a single and a double, and Billy Cox is...</i>

1520
01:07:59,236 --> 01:08:01,842
Close your eyes. Close your eyes, come on.

1521
01:08:02,038 --> 01:08:04,847
Close your eyes and you can see it.

1522
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:07,047
<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i>

1523
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:08,963
<i>Lockman without
too big of a lead at second“</i>

1524
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:11,245
<i>but he 'll be running like the wind
if Thomson hits one.</i>

1525
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,258
<i>Branca throws.</i>

1526
01:08:12,448 --> 01:08:15,088
<i>There's a long drive!
It's gonna be, I believe...</i>

1527
01:08:15,284 --> 01:08:16,888
<i>The Giants win the pennant!</i>

1528
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:20,431
<i>The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant!</i>

1529
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:22,225
<i>The Giants win the pennant!</i>

1530
01:08:22,424 --> 01:08:26,065
<i>Bobby Thomson hits into the lower
deck of the left field stands!</i>

1531
01:08:26,262 --> 01:08:27,673
<i>The Giants win the pennant...</i>

1532
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:30,707
<i>and they're going crazy,
they're going crazy!</i>

1533
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,846
<i>And home!</i>

1534
01:08:33,369 --> 01:08:34,507
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

1535
01:08:34,703 --> 01:08:36,046
<i>I do not believe it!</i>

1536
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,118
<i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i>

1537
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:42,585
<i>and they're picking Bobby Thomson up“</i>

1538
01:08:42,778 --> 01:08:44,382
<i>and carrying him off the field!</i>

1539
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,753
That's what gave me my dream.

1540
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:49,349
Now the big dream,
of course, was to announce for the Giants.

1541
01:08:49,485 --> 01:08:50,463
D-Did you?

1542
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,425
No. But...

1543
01:08:53,622 --> 01:08:54,965
Y-You still might?

1544
01:08:56,824 --> 01:08:58,132
You never know.

1545
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,603
C-C-Can I h-hear it again?

1546
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:02,734
Sure.

1547
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,609
<i>Bobby Thomson
up there swinging.</i>

1548
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:08,007
<i>He's had two out of three,</i>

1549
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,062
<i>a single and a double,
and Billy Cox is playing...</i>

1550
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:18,284
Honey, we're going to play a
game. You want to join us?

1551
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:20,424
- Grandma, I can't.
- Why?

1552
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,135
Because if I don't do well tomorrow...

1553
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,058
then I won't get into
the Atlanta Youth Symphony...

1554
01:09:24,252 --> 01:09:25,613
which is a feeder for Juilliard...

1555
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,540
which offers a graduate class
with Sarah Chang...

1556
01:09:27,655 --> 01:09:29,726
whose students are virtually guaranteed

1557
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:31,064
to get into the Berlin Philharmonic...

1558
01:09:31,259 --> 01:09:33,060
which is the orchestra
I most want to play in.

1559
01:09:33,328 --> 01:09:34,306
- Sweetheart.
- Yes.

1560
01:09:34,495 --> 01:09:35,616
Berlin's not going anywhere.

1561
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,970
Well, neither am I if I don't practice.

1562
01:09:38,499 --> 01:09:41,446
Okay, I'll tell the boys.
But you're sure now?

1563
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:42,512
Yes.

1564
01:09:42,704 --> 01:09:44,183
Okay.

1565
01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:49,417
Gentlemen, the game is called Kick the Can.

1566
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,112
Are you going to recycle that?

1567
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:53,382
I-It's d-dirty out here.

1568
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:54,718
And windy!

1569
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:56,952
I know. It's called "outside."

1570
01:09:57,451 --> 01:09:59,089
Is she coming?

1571
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:00,655
Oh, too bad.

1572
01:10:00,854 --> 01:10:02,993
All right, guys, the object of the game,

1573
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,161
kick the can without getting tagged!

1574
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:06,804
Okay, here we go!

1575
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,473
Come on!

1576
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:09,902
Kick... Come on.

1577
01:10:10,097 --> 01:10:11,770
S-Sounds b-boring.

1578
01:10:11,965 --> 01:10:13,069
Boring?

1579
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:14,507
Yeah?

1580
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:16,977
Who wants a chance to clobber old Artie?

1581
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:17,978
Right.

1582
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:20,482
And then see him eat dirt!

1583
01:10:20,807 --> 01:10:22,252
And then kick the can so hard...

1584
01:10:22,442 --> 01:10:24,422
it goes in one ear and out the other!

1585
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,014
I do! I do!

1586
01:10:27,214 --> 01:10:28,693
I do!

1587
01:10:28,882 --> 01:10:29,917
In my ear?

1588
01:10:30,117 --> 01:10:31,425
Out of my way, Farty.

1589
01:10:32,552 --> 01:10:33,394
Over here!

1590
01:10:33,587 --> 01:10:34,565
Good kick!

1591
01:10:34,755 --> 01:10:35,859
Turner, it's mine!

1592
01:10:39,593 --> 01:10:40,765
I got it, I got it!

1593
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:42,965
Look out for me, I'm Super Artie!

1594
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:45,808
Watch it, watch it!

1595
01:10:46,766 --> 01:10:47,801
Pass me the can!

1596
01:10:48,134 --> 01:10:49,204
Over here.

1597
01:10:50,236 --> 01:10:51,544
Farty!

1598
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,876
Well!

1599
01:10:56,075 --> 01:10:57,611
Okay. Let the games begin!

1600
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:09,958
Come on!

1601
01:11:51,296 --> 01:11:52,400
Are you okay?

1602
01:11:52,497 --> 01:11:53,532
I'm fine.

1603
01:11:53,732 --> 01:11:55,769
You should see the other guy!

1604
01:11:59,404 --> 01:12:01,042
- I got more ice.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

1605
01:12:01,239 --> 01:12:02,650
It should be stopping soon.

1606
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:04,149
I should start dinner.

1607
01:12:04,342 --> 01:12:05,412
Grandma?

1608
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:06,511
Yes, dear?

1609
01:12:07,579 --> 01:12:10,059
I know my audition is tomorrow,
but I practiced all day.

1610
01:12:10,248 --> 01:12:12,089
And you said I should relax
the night before...

1611
01:12:12,183 --> 01:12:13,992
and there's this party tonight.

1612
01:12:14,185 --> 01:12:15,858
It's the first party
I've been invited to since we moved.

1613
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:17,362
What if I just went for a half an hour...

1614
01:12:17,555 --> 01:12:19,675
came right back home,
got a really good night's sleep?

1615
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:21,032
What kind of a party?

1616
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:23,197
Just this party for some boy.

1617
01:12:25,163 --> 01:12:26,141
He kind of likes me.

1618
01:12:27,232 --> 01:12:28,801
I'll do your make-up!

1619
01:12:40,043 --> 01:12:41,181
I wish we could stay.

1620
01:12:41,378 --> 01:12:43,289
Yeah, we should do this, like...

1621
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,322
Yeah, like...

1622
01:12:44,515 --> 01:12:46,290
- Every week?
- Yes.

1623
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:48,690
<i>The child
that was involved was not injured.</i>

1624
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,331
<i>Take a look and a listen to this.</i>

1625
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:52,728
<i>It was scary. I was about
to nail this 900...</i>

1626
01:12:52,923 --> 01:12:55,665
<i>and there's this kid up there
just whizzing away.</i>

1627
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:58,533
<i>I hit his stream
and I fishtailed, and now it's on YouTube.</i>

1628
01:12:58,729 --> 01:13:01,005
It's got more hits than
Charlie the Unicorn.

1629
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:03,701
<i>And when I asked what he was
doing, you know what he said?</i>

1630
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,814
<i>"I was chasing Carl, my kangaroo. "</i>

1631
01:13:07,004 --> 01:13:08,847
<i>That's one twisted little dude.</i>

1632
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,146
<i>This is from Tony Hawk's practice
run this morning at the X Games.</i>

1633
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:15,086
<i>And you know, it kind
of begs the question...</i>

1634
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:17,156
<i>what kind of parent would let their child</i>

1635
01:13:17,247 --> 01:13:19,693
<i>wander out onto the half-pipe?</i>

1636
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:28,995
Hey!

1637
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:30,861
How is this for bonding?

1638
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:32,262
I taught them how to shave.

1639
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,832
Yeah. Show her your legs, boys.

1640
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:37,164
That's great!

1641
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:41,105
And guess what? I ordered
Chinese“ I mean, Pan Asian, for dinner.

1642
01:13:42,634 --> 01:13:43,704
Noodles!

1643
01:13:43,902 --> 01:13:45,263
All right, go upstairs and change.

1644
01:13:45,437 --> 01:13:47,610
When you come down,
we're going to arm-wrestle Grandma.

1645
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:51,186
How come we just had one?

1646
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:52,514
It's not too late.

1647
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:55,089
It's really late. Come here,
I want to show you something.

1648
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,226
- What?
- Look at this.

1649
01:13:57,415 --> 01:13:59,190
- That's Alice's song.
- Yeah.

1650
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:01,227
She was, like, three or four years
old, how did she remember?

1651
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:03,899
I don't know,
but it's at the top of her playlist.

1652
01:14:06,057 --> 01:14:09,470
We must have sang that song
a thousand times to her in the car!

1653
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:11,368
- You know you want to.
- I don't want to sing it.

1654
01:14:11,563 --> 01:14:14,702
<i>Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom-ba-doo-hoo-whom</i>

1655
01:14:15,266 --> 01:14:18,304
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1656
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:22,541
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh, who wrote the book of love?</i>

1657
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:26,620
<i>I got to know the answer
was it someone from above?</i>

1658
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:29,848
<i>Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom ba-doo-hoo-whom.</i>

1659
01:14:30,481 --> 01:14:31,892
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1660
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:33,857
What is that?

1661
01:14:34,051 --> 01:14:36,088
<i>Chapter one says you lave her,</i>

1662
01:14:36,186 --> 01:14:38,188
<i>you love her with all your heart</i>

1663
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:40,266
<i>Chapter two, you tell her...</i>

1664
01:14:40,457 --> 01:14:42,368
<i>you're never
never never never ever gonna part</i>

1665
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,631
<i>And chapter three, remember...</i>

1666
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:46,637
<i>the meaning of romance</i>

1667
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,639
<i>And chapter four, you break up</i>

1668
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:50,607
<i>But you give her just one more chance</i>

1669
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:54,442
<i>Oh, I wonder, wonder,
whom-ba-doo-hoo-whom</i>

1670
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:57,551
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1671
01:14:57,808 --> 01:15:01,119
<i>I wonder who</i>

1672
01:15:01,312 --> 01:15:02,222
Yeah.

1673
01:15:02,313 --> 01:15:07,386
<i>Who wrote the book of love?</i>

1674
01:15:09,485 --> 01:15:11,431
Thank you.

1675
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:13,390
Grandma?

1676
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,467
We're down here.

1677
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,937
Oh, boy.

1678
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:21,438
Oh, Harper. Oh, this is great.

1679
01:15:22,098 --> 01:15:23,076
Wait, my camera.

1680
01:15:23,266 --> 01:15:24,506
Okay.

1681
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:30,244
Oh, honey, you look so great!

1682
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:32,582
Thank you.

1683
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:33,753
You look so beautiful.

1684
01:15:33,943 --> 01:15:35,943
Artie, what do you think
of your granddaughter now?

1685
01:15:40,383 --> 01:15:41,862
Doesn't she look like her mom?

1686
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:43,496
Just like her mom.

1687
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:46,166
Hey, it stopped raining.

1688
01:15:46,356 --> 01:15:49,200
Carl says we should go outside
and play again!

1689
01:15:49,392 --> 01:15:51,133
Oh, no, Barker, it's too muddy.

1690
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:52,931
But he wants to.

1691
01:15:53,129 --> 01:15:55,473
Barker, remember what we talked about?

1692
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:59,040
You're the boss of Carl.
You tell him what to do.

1693
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:03,606
We can't go out now, Carl.

1694
01:16:05,173 --> 01:16:06,777
Carl, no!

1695
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:08,679
- Stop!
- What's wrong?

1696
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:12,017
He ran away.
He said he's never coming back.

1697
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:14,160
Oh, he'll come back.
He has to pick up his mail.

1698
01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:15,487
Yeah, mail.

1699
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:16,790
Makes sense.

1700
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,165
- Barker!
- Carl!

1701
01:16:20,255 --> 01:16:21,199
Artie, get him.

1702
01:16:21,289 --> 01:16:23,166
<i>Barker has left without adult supervision.</i>

1703
01:16:23,358 --> 01:16:25,463
Carl, don't go!

1704
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:27,439
Barker!

1705
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:28,530
Goodbye, Artie Decker.

1706
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,802
Barker!

1707
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,849
How many heart attacks can you give me?

1708
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,186
Oh, no, no, no!

1709
01:16:41,376 --> 01:16:42,787
- Barker, are you okay?
- He's fine.

1710
01:16:44,146 --> 01:16:45,216
What, are you hurt?

1711
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:47,155
Look, can't you see?

1712
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,488
He's dead, the car killed him!
Carl is dead!

1713
01:16:50,686 --> 01:16:53,188
What? No! I killed Carl?

1714
01:16:53,554 --> 01:16:55,397
Oh, honey, he's fine. He's just dazed.

1715
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:57,269
Yeah, yeah. Carl, you're okay, aren't you?

1716
01:16:57,324 --> 01:16:58,964
Yeah, I'm all right, mate. I'm all right!

1717
01:16:59,093 --> 01:17:00,902
- That wasn't Carl, that was you!
- Shut up!

1718
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:02,574
No, he's not all right!

1719
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:05,500
He's dead! He's mushed all over the road.

1720
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,237
His head is here and his body's over there!

1721
01:17:08,436 --> 01:17:12,248
It's your fault! You made me get
into a fight with him!

1722
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,442
We are so past weird.

1723
01:17:15,609 --> 01:17:17,054
I love Carl!

1724
01:17:17,244 --> 01:17:19,383
I even pack extra fortune cookies for him!

1725
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,651
Excuse me, what's Chinese for mental case?

1726
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:24,088
Hello?

1727
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,952
We were cruising
and heard the alarm. Is everyone okay?

1728
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,700
Yes.

1729
01:17:33,894 --> 01:17:36,602
No, he's dead! The car killed him!

1730
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:38,674
He came out of nowhere!

1731
01:17:38,866 --> 01:17:40,539
Officer, you're wasting your time.

1732
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,296
What happened? Why are the police here?

1733
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:43,744
Why is the alarm on?

1734
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:45,177
- Oh, hi!
- Mommy!

1735
01:17:45,371 --> 01:17:46,645
- Was there a break-in?
- It's nothing.

1736
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,878
It's absolutely nothing.
What are you doing home?

1737
01:17:50,076 --> 01:17:51,214
I killed Carl!

1738
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,186
- What?
- You killed Carl? How?

1739
01:17:53,379 --> 01:17:55,552
Who is Carl? Is he a family member?

1740
01:17:55,749 --> 01:17:56,591
- Yes!
- No!

1741
01:17:56,783 --> 01:17:58,421
He's a kangaroo!

1742
01:17:58,618 --> 01:17:59,528
He's a what?

1743
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:00,857
Turner, your eye!

1744
01:18:01,054 --> 01:18:02,226
How did that happen?

1745
01:18:02,889 --> 01:18:03,867
Artie did it?

1746
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:07,594
Oh, no, no, no. Ivan's sister did it.
I did that.

1747
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:08,772
You hit Mom?

1748
01:18:08,862 --> 01:18:09,897
It was an accident!

1749
01:18:10,096 --> 01:18:11,336
Ma'am, would you like to file a complaint?

1750
01:18:11,531 --> 01:18:12,532
No!

1751
01:18:12,632 --> 01:18:13,702
We were playing a game.

1752
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,279
That's the dress.

1753
01:18:15,468 --> 01:18:16,708
Does she have make-up on?

1754
01:18:17,971 --> 01:18:19,211
Don't growl at us.

1755
01:18:19,405 --> 01:18:20,245
This is unbelievable.

1756
01:18:20,406 --> 01:18:22,579
We leave and she's 12,
we come home and she's 16.

1757
01:18:22,942 --> 01:18:23,920
Boys, go in the house.

1758
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:25,680
Turner, turn off the alarm, please.

1759
01:18:25,879 --> 01:18:27,586
You know, you're not supposed
to be back until tomorrow.

1760
01:18:27,781 --> 01:18:29,522
Well, we were just so curious...

1761
01:18:29,716 --> 01:18:32,720
as to why Barker was nearly
killed this morning at the X Games!

1762
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:34,523
Get your taser ready.

1763
01:18:35,421 --> 01:18:36,399
That's not right.

1764
01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:38,693
Barker was at a play date
this morning with Artie.

1765
01:18:38,891 --> 01:18:39,801
Yeah?

1766
01:18:43,495 --> 01:18:45,532
I was in a little bind...

1767
01:18:45,731 --> 01:18:48,041
and I had to take him
with me on some business.

1768
01:18:48,233 --> 01:18:49,974
What business did you have
at the X Games?

1769
01:18:50,169 --> 01:18:52,149
Yeah, Artie, what business?

1770
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,648
Aren't we forgetting
the most serious issue here?

1771
01:19:01,847 --> 01:19:02,882
What issue?

1772
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:05,257
The death of an imaginary kangaroo.

1773
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:06,451
He's imaginary?

1774
01:19:06,652 --> 01:19:07,630
Yes!

1775
01:19:09,822 --> 01:19:10,800
You can go.

1776
01:19:15,761 --> 01:19:18,264
Would someone please explain
what happened to Carl?

1777
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:19,703
We were playing Kick the Can...

1778
01:19:19,865 --> 01:19:22,141
and it started to rain,
so we all came indoors...

1779
01:19:22,334 --> 01:19:24,837
and I was helping
Harper get dressed for her party.

1780
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:26,983
A party? You're throwing a party?

1781
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:27,972
No, Dad, I'm going to a party.

1782
01:19:27,973 --> 01:19:28,576
No, Dad, I'm going to a party.

1783
01:19:28,774 --> 01:19:29,752
For a boy who likes her.

1784
01:19:29,942 --> 01:19:31,579
A boy? What boy?

1785
01:19:31,776 --> 01:19:34,188
The night before your audition?
Are you kidding?

1786
01:19:34,378 --> 01:19:35,516
I told her she could go.

1787
01:19:35,713 --> 01:19:38,694
It's ridiculous. It is out of the question.

1788
01:19:38,883 --> 01:19:40,760
Maybe it's ridiculous for me to spend

1789
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:42,695
all my time practicing the violin...

1790
01:19:42,887 --> 01:19:46,357
never doing anything else
and auditioning for a school tomorrow...

1791
01:19:46,557 --> 01:19:48,537
where I'm never going to do anything else

1792
01:19:48,626 --> 01:19:50,537
the whole rest of my life.

1793
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,974
Well, she's using her words.

1794
01:19:57,168 --> 01:20:00,377
Harper. Harper!
I cannot allow you to take a talent...

1795
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:03,780
a gift to which you have
dedicated so much time and effort...

1796
01:20:03,975 --> 01:20:06,285
and throw it away on a whim.

1797
01:20:06,477 --> 01:20:09,481
I hate you and I wish
anyone else was my mother!

1798
01:20:11,048 --> 01:20:12,994
Maybe not those words.

1799
01:20:13,384 --> 01:20:14,556
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

1800
01:20:14,752 --> 01:20:16,792
I couldn't have
gotten through the week without you.

1801
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:24,760
I say we head for the airport right now.

1802
01:20:24,928 --> 01:20:27,534
Don't even take our clothes
we just skedaddle.

1803
01:20:31,401 --> 01:20:34,405
I followed you for 35 years, Artie.

1804
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:41,754
Wherever you needed to be,
that's where I was.

1805
01:20:42,612 --> 01:20:44,649
No complaints.

1806
01:20:46,416 --> 01:20:48,692
Well, some.

1807
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,897
But this week...

1808
01:20:54,024 --> 01:20:57,198
This week was supposed to be about
us and our grandchildren.

1809
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,174
Not you.

1810
01:21:01,865 --> 01:21:03,401
Not you.

1811
01:21:07,003 --> 01:21:10,212
Did you have to go to that audition?

1812
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:14,717
It's not one of my better moments.

1813
01:21:18,147 --> 01:21:20,650
For one wonderful hour...

1814
01:21:22,084 --> 01:21:26,897
we weren't the "other" grandparents.

1815
01:21:30,993 --> 01:21:32,472
There you are.

1816
01:21:33,629 --> 01:21:35,267
You okay?

1817
01:21:36,865 --> 01:21:39,471
I've had better Mommy days.

1818
01:21:40,302 --> 01:21:44,148
You know, it may not have been
horrible to let her go to that party.

1819
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,751
I know.

1820
01:21:45,941 --> 01:21:48,979
I just walked into that
scene and I freaked.

1821
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:53,189
I can't believe my parents killed Carl.

1822
01:21:53,716 --> 01:21:56,162
Well, I was thinking about that.

1823
01:21:56,352 --> 01:22:00,596
You know, they didn't kill
Carl, only Barker could do that.

1824
01:22:02,057 --> 01:22:06,802
And it somehow took us
not being here for him to do it.

1825
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:10,637
So, what's your point?

1826
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:14,176
Maybe we coddle him too much.

1827
01:22:15,136 --> 01:22:17,844
Maybe he needed a little tough love...

1828
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:20,110
to let go of his imaginary friend.

1829
01:22:20,308 --> 01:22:24,950
But, Phil, that would make my father right.

1830
01:22:25,413 --> 01:22:27,984
Yeah. We can't have any of that.

1831
01:22:30,985 --> 01:22:31,827
Harper?

1832
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:36,796
I could come back.

1833
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:39,130
No, no, no, it's okay.

1834
01:22:39,327 --> 01:22:41,307
I'm going to check on Barker.

1835
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:45,504
Thanks, Phil.

1836
01:22:53,674 --> 01:22:54,652
I'm sorry.

1837
01:22:58,246 --> 01:22:59,384
For what?

1838
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,150
Narrow it down for me, Dad.

1839
01:23:01,349 --> 01:23:02,725
For this week.

1840
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:06,262
For almost getting Barker hurt today.

1841
01:23:06,353 --> 01:23:08,196
I just feel terrible about that.

1842
01:23:10,257 --> 01:23:12,066
What were you even doing there?

1843
01:23:18,065 --> 01:23:20,773
I was on an audition.

1844
01:23:21,635 --> 01:23:23,637
Because the Grizzlies fired me.

1845
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,374
What?

1846
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:29,047
Why didn't you tell us?

1847
01:23:29,242 --> 01:23:30,380
Because it's humiliating.

1848
01:23:30,577 --> 01:23:32,079
Why would they do that?

1849
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:34,122
You're so good at that job.

1850
01:23:34,981 --> 01:23:35,959
Maybe not good enough.

1851
01:23:38,518 --> 01:23:39,895
Alice...

1852
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:42,014
your mom was really hoping...

1853
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:45,435
that this trip would help bring
her closer to her grandchildren.

1854
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:47,966
And she and Harper have developed

1855
01:23:48,061 --> 01:23:51,065
a relationship that's kind of great...

1856
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:55,301
and I don't want
to see that end just because I screwed up.

1857
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:01,875
What about you?

1858
01:24:02,308 --> 01:24:04,618
Don't you want a relationship
with your grandchildren?

1859
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:06,517
Of course I do.

1860
01:24:06,712 --> 01:24:08,123
I mean...

1861
01:24:08,314 --> 01:24:12,194
like an hour
before you came home, it was really good.

1862
01:24:13,152 --> 01:24:15,257
It's just that sometimes...

1863
01:24:17,223 --> 01:24:18,930
I don't feel...

1864
01:24:19,325 --> 01:24:20,497
What?

1865
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:24,535
Welcome, here.

1866
01:24:30,236 --> 01:24:32,341
What happened to us, Dad?

1867
01:24:36,142 --> 01:24:38,679
How old were you when Harper was born?

1868
01:24:38,911 --> 01:24:40,185
Twenty-six.

1869
01:24:40,379 --> 01:24:41,700
Did you know what you were doing?

1870
01:24:42,014 --> 01:24:43,015
No.

1871
01:24:43,983 --> 01:24:46,896
I was 23 when you came along.

1872
01:24:47,085 --> 01:24:50,726
And I was terrified, because you didn't
come with any instructions.

1873
01:24:50,922 --> 01:24:52,731
And I thought I was doing okay.

1874
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:57,236
Because unlike my father,
I wasn't constantly telling you...

1875
01:24:57,428 --> 01:25:00,409
what an annoying little waste
of time you were...

1876
01:25:00,598 --> 01:25:02,669
and believe me, I'm cleaning that up.

1877
01:25:02,867 --> 01:25:05,677
And I thought that we were
actually having fun.

1878
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:09,340
Me and the weather girl...

1879
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:13,148
and the cutest little girl you ever saw,
traveling around the country.

1880
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:16,223
But then years go by,
and your daughter goes off to college...

1881
01:25:16,414 --> 01:25:20,055
and she doesn't come home
for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

1882
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:22,655
Or summers.

1883
01:25:22,854 --> 01:25:24,197
Or ever.

1884
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:28,166
And you get these clues, this inkling...

1885
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:31,465
that perhaps all those years
she wasn't having such a good time...

1886
01:25:31,663 --> 01:25:36,703
and that maybe she thought
you didn't do such a good job.

1887
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:39,780
And that really hurts. Doesn't it?

1888
01:25:42,439 --> 01:25:44,112
Yes.

1889
01:25:44,474 --> 01:25:47,944
So, little girl,
I have to give you three put-ups.

1890
01:25:49,313 --> 01:25:50,291
- No, Dad.
- Please.

1891
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,390
It's okay.

1892
01:25:51,582 --> 01:25:55,052
Harper, Turner, Barker.

1893
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:57,732
They're great kids
and you're a really good mother.

1894
01:25:58,655 --> 01:25:59,656
Yeah.

1895
01:25:59,856 --> 01:26:02,598
I'm basking in the glow
of my children's affection.

1896
01:26:02,793 --> 01:26:04,898
Harper? She didn't mean anything.

1897
01:26:05,095 --> 01:26:06,403
I mean, she's 12.

1898
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,599
Get ready, it's going to get a lot worse.

1899
01:26:09,833 --> 01:26:13,645
Only, don't let her turn her back on you.

1900
01:26:13,837 --> 01:26:15,783
Because that will break your heart.

1901
01:26:18,809 --> 01:26:19,981
Harper?

1902
01:26:21,812 --> 01:26:22,790
No.

1903
01:26:23,814 --> 01:26:28,092
Barker has a special request
for tomorrow, before the audition.

1904
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:30,756
And it involves all of us.

1905
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:50,979
Carl, your two favorite things were milk
and tofu dogs.

1906
01:26:51,173 --> 01:26:53,653
Now, you can have both forever.

1907
01:27:11,193 --> 01:27:13,764
Grandma, thanks for decorating the box.

1908
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:17,034
Oh, honey, it was my pleasure.

1909
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:21,878
Carl...

1910
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:24,551
Can Artie say something nice for Carl?

1911
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,911
Me?

1912
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:36,528
How do you...

1913
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:41,125
I'm sorry, Carl.

1914
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:43,929
He died so young.

1915
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,271
How do you say goodbye
to somebody you could never say hello to?

1916
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:50,704
It's hard.

1917
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,604
I didn't get to see Carl very often,

1918
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,272
but then again, nobody else did.

1919
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,418
Except for Barker...

1920
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:02,383
which is what made him so special.

1921
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:07,657
Carl wasn't just Barker's friend,
he was a part of him.

1922
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:11,092
And that made him a part of all of us.

1923
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:16,899
Carl, you will forever be in our hearts.

1924
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:19,298
Keep on hopping, buddy.

1925
01:28:47,821 --> 01:28:48,629
Okay.

1926
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:51,132
Alice, you take Harper backstage.
We'll grab some seats.

1927
01:28:51,325 --> 01:28:52,303
Barker, Turner, you're with us.

1928
01:28:52,526 --> 01:28:53,726
- Good luck.
- Knock them dead.

1929
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:54,839
Thanks.

1930
01:28:55,028 --> 01:28:56,336
Break a leg.

1931
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:57,941
Bye, Dad.

1932
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:22,424
Don't applaud. That's that woman!

1933
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:24,463
<i>Good evening.</i>

1934
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:28,797
<i>Welcome family, friends
and distinguished judges...</i>

1935
01:29:28,995 --> 01:29:31,601
<i>to the Atlanta Performing Arts Center.</i>

1936
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:34,108
<i>I am Doctor Schveer.</i>

1937
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:41,016
<i>We have 74 amazingly talented musicians...</i>

1938
01:29:41,207 --> 01:29:45,678
<i>all vying for one position
at this prestigious conservatory.</i>

1939
01:29:45,878 --> 01:29:48,518
<i>So, without further ado I give you</i>

1940
01:29:48,614 --> 01:29:51,220
<i>Chet Halloran on the saxophone</i>

1941
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,795
Yeah! Go Chet!

1942
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,751
Hang on a second, honey.

1943
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:32,168
You know,
when you were just five years old...

1944
01:30:32,357 --> 01:30:34,928
we took you to that
little music school for the first time.

1945
01:30:35,126 --> 01:30:38,903
And all the other kids
they were just banging on things.

1946
01:30:39,965 --> 01:30:42,571
One kid tried to play another kid.

1947
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:47,380
But from that very first day, you played.

1948
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:49,275
And not just played...

1949
01:30:49,474 --> 01:30:52,717
you had this look
of such fulfillment on your face.

1950
01:30:52,978 --> 01:30:55,117
And I said to your dad,
"Whatever it takes..."

1951
01:30:55,313 --> 01:30:57,155
"whatever we have to do, I always"

1952
01:30:57,248 --> 01:30:59,728
"want to see that look on her face."

1953
01:31:01,218 --> 01:31:03,721
Lately, I'm not seeing it.

1954
01:31:04,622 --> 01:31:08,434
So, honey, do you
really not want to switch schools again?

1955
01:31:11,762 --> 01:31:12,900
Okay.

1956
01:31:13,664 --> 01:31:15,803
What do you say we ditch this audition?

1957
01:31:17,434 --> 01:31:18,504
Really?

1958
01:31:18,702 --> 01:31:21,478
Yeah. It's okay.

1959
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:26,146
Mommy, I didn't mean what I said.

1960
01:31:27,011 --> 01:31:28,513
Oh, baby.

1961
01:31:29,179 --> 01:31:32,649
I wouldn't want anyone else to be my mom.

1962
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:34,659
And I love you.

1963
01:31:34,852 --> 01:31:38,265
That's good
because you're my only daughter.

1964
01:31:38,622 --> 01:31:42,661
And you know,
I don't really understand the boys.

1965
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:45,966
I know. How weird are they?

1966
01:31:48,899 --> 01:31:50,002
Yeah, yeah!

1967
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:51,200
Hi, baby.

1968
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:58,043
We regret to inform you
of a slight change in our program.

1969
01:31:58,241 --> 01:32:00,221
Harper Simmons has forfeited her slot...

1970
01:32:02,545 --> 01:32:04,024
and her future.

1971
01:32:04,213 --> 01:32:06,489
Since the next performer is warming up...

1972
01:32:06,683 --> 01:32:08,663
we're going to have to take
a 10 minute break.

1973
01:32:12,055 --> 01:32:13,500
Hey, what's going on?

1974
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:15,263
She's not going to audition.

1975
01:32:15,458 --> 01:32:17,019
You're not disappointed in me, are you?

1976
01:32:17,193 --> 01:32:19,673
Oh, no, no, no. That's
not even a possibility.

1977
01:32:19,862 --> 01:32:21,773
Is this is all my fault? It is, isn't it?

1978
01:32:21,965 --> 01:32:24,002
I came 3,000 miles
to ruin my granddaughter's life.

1979
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,042
It's not your fault.

1980
01:32:25,234 --> 01:32:26,941
- Really?
- It was our choice.

1981
01:32:27,136 --> 01:32:28,012
I love you.

1982
01:32:28,204 --> 01:32:29,979
Here, take my picture, Phil.

1983
01:32:30,907 --> 01:32:31,851
Get in there.

1984
01:32:39,148 --> 01:32:40,024
Where's Turner?

1985
01:32:40,216 --> 01:32:41,456
You! Kid!

1986
01:32:44,186 --> 01:32:45,392
Turner!

1987
01:32:53,095 --> 01:32:55,132
<i>Bobby Thomson, up there swinging.</i>

1988
01:32:55,697 --> 01:32:57,335
<i>He's had two out of three,
a single and a double...</i>

1989
01:32:57,532 --> 01:33:00,308
<i>and Billy Cox is playing him
right an the third base line.</i>

1990
01:33:00,502 --> 01:33:02,914
<i>One out, last of the ninth. Branca pitches.</i>

1991
01:33:03,105 --> 01:33:06,484
<i>Bobby Thomson takes a strike
called on the inside corner.</i>

1992
01:33:06,675 --> 01:33:08,586
<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i>

1993
01:33:08,777 --> 01:33:09,653
<i>He's had a single and a double“</i>

1994
01:33:09,845 --> 01:33:13,918
<i>and he drove in the Giants
first run with a long fly to center.</i>

1995
01:33:14,116 --> 01:33:15,720
<i>Lockman without
too big of a lead at second...</i>

1996
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:18,727
<i>but he 'll be
running like the wind if Thomson hits one.</i>

1997
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,990
<i>Branca throws.</i>

1998
01:33:20,188 --> 01:33:22,225
<i>There's a long drive!
It's gonna be, I believe...</i>

1999
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:26,236
<i>The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant!</i>

2000
01:33:26,428 --> 01:33:28,271
<i>The Giants win the pennant!</i>

2001
01:33:28,463 --> 01:33:30,238
<i>The Giants win the pennant...</i>

2002
01:33:30,432 --> 01:33:32,173
<i>and they're going crazy.</i>

2003
01:33:32,367 --> 01:33:34,040
<i>They're going crazy!</i>

2004
01:33:34,236 --> 01:33:37,011
<i>And home!</i>

2005
01:33:37,204 --> 01:33:38,765
<i>I don't believe it! I don't believe it!</i>

2006
01:33:39,473 --> 01:33:40,781
I do not believe it!

2007
01:33:40,975 --> 01:33:43,285
<i>Bobby Thomson hit a line drive...</i>

2008
01:33:43,477 --> 01:33:46,253
<i>into the lower deck of
the left field stands“</i>

2009
01:33:46,447 --> 01:33:49,018
<i>and the place is going crazy!</i>

2010
01:33:49,216 --> 01:33:52,959
<i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i>

2011
01:33:53,154 --> 01:33:55,464
<i>and they're picking Bobby Thomson up</i>

2012
01:33:55,556 --> 01:33:57,797
<i>and carrying him off the field!</i>

2013
01:34:01,495 --> 01:34:03,475
Yeah! Yeah!

2014
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:15,982
I saw it. I saw it, Artie.

2015
01:34:16,577 --> 01:34:18,454
Call me Grandpa.

2016
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:26,390
My big boy. How on earth...?

2017
01:34:26,587 --> 01:34:28,065
Grandpa taught me.

2018
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:39,637
Your father was wrong.

2019
01:34:41,468 --> 01:34:42,970
So was yours.

2020
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:48,316
Oh, Al.

2021
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,986
How much would it
embarrass you if I kissed you right now?

2022
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:57,454
I think a lot.

2023
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,822
As soon as we get home.

2024
01:34:59,018 --> 01:35:00,361
Okay, I look forward to it.

2025
01:35:00,553 --> 01:35:02,863
Dr. Schveer, I shun you.

2026
01:35:03,056 --> 01:35:04,933
You are shunned.

2027
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,060
My friends, it's taken me over 35 years
to say these words...

2028
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:11,732
it's opening day for the Giants

2029
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,310
and we've got a capacity crowd.

2030
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,673
Giants are out in the field.
There's Charlie "The Naz" Naznic...

2031
01:35:15,869 --> 01:35:18,145
batting .290, takes his
stance at the plate.

2032
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:21,318
Yes, Art. Let's see
if Naz can get his team out of a jam.

2033
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,111
Okay, Turner, here's the action.

2034
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,218
Naz swings!

2035
01:35:24,409 --> 01:35:25,609
He gets some wood on that one!

2036
01:35:25,644 --> 01:35:26,850
Hard drive to Barker Simmons.

2037
01:35:26,979 --> 01:35:28,014
It's through his legs.

2038
01:35:28,213 --> 01:35:29,783
Walters has it. No, Walters loses it.

2039
01:35:30,883 --> 01:35:33,523
Sherman's got a glove down.
No, he stopped to pick his nose.

2040
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:35,995
Now, Douglas is sitting down
and taking off his shoes...

2041
01:35:36,188 --> 01:35:37,948
because his mom said to me
before the game...

2042
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:39,831
"Sometimes he's in another world."

2043
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:41,663
Sherman still working
on that thing in his nose.

2044
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:43,635
Man, that must be really packed in there!

2045
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:44,739
You betcha!

2046
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:46,000
Naz rounds second, heads for third.

2047
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:48,337
Sherman has the booger!
Sherman has the booger!

2048
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:51,572
I don't believe it! I do not believe it!

2049
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:53,374
The other players are coming over
to examine it.

2050
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:55,210
I can see it from here!

2051
01:35:55,407 --> 01:35:58,013
You could take
an aerial photograph of that thing!

2052
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:01,214
I'm sure there's going
to be orange slices in the locker room...

2053
01:36:01,413 --> 01:36:02,373
and a couple of tissues.

2054
01:36:02,414 --> 01:36:05,486
Meanwhile, Naz scores.
And that is another home run!

2055
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:10,763
The Giants are still leading, 34 to 27.

2056
01:36:10,956 --> 01:36:12,162
What a first inning!

2057
01:36:12,357 --> 01:36:13,199
You're telling me.

2058
01:36:13,392 --> 01:36:15,098
I hope the second inning is shorter

2059
01:36:15,193 --> 01:36:16,866
because grandpa needs a bathroom break.

2060
01:36:17,195 --> 01:36:19,175
Go Barker!

2061
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:20,671
Our next batter is coming
up to the plate.

2062
01:36:20,865 --> 01:36:23,072
He's number three, Barker Simmons.

2063
01:36:23,267 --> 01:36:25,372
Yeah, Barker!

2064
01:36:25,603 --> 01:36:29,176
Young man with incredible
power. Three-foot-four and 45 pounds.

2065
01:36:30,241 --> 01:36:32,744
He hits it to shortstop. Oh, it's through!

2066
01:36:32,944 --> 01:36:34,305
Barker heading towards first base.

2067
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:35,516
No, he makes a right turn!

2068
01:36:35,713 --> 01:36:37,386
He makes a right turn.

2069
01:36:37,582 --> 01:36:38,617
Barker, go back!

2070
01:36:38,716 --> 01:36:40,195
He's going the wrong way.

2071
01:36:40,918 --> 01:36:42,226
What are you doing here?

2072
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,127
I just wanted to say hi.

2073
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:46,393
He just wanted to say hi.

2074
01:36:46,591 --> 01:36:48,111
Well, I don't think I've ever heard...

2075
01:36:48,226 --> 01:36:49,866
Turn around, everybody. Take our picture.

2076
01:36:49,961 --> 01:36:51,599
Okay, picture.

2077
01:37:04,675 --> 01:37:06,813
<i>I got to tell you friends,
this is one of those days.</i>

2078
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,991
<i>Seventy-eight degrees,
the sold out crowd of 56 fans...</i>

2079
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:12,091
<i>the smell of the popcorn, the hot dogs“</i>

2080
01:37:12,282 --> 01:37:14,762
<i>the loud pushy parents,
and the crying kids.</i>

2081
01:37:14,951 --> 01:37:17,830
<i>But I'll tell you something,
there's no other place I'd rather be.</i>

2082
01:37:18,021 --> 01:37:20,433
<i>Andes my grandson Barker
said to me this morning...</i>

2083
01:37:20,624 --> 01:37:22,729
<i>"Man, your feet smell like cheese. "</i>

2084
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:25,065
<i>This is Artie Decker,
De Voice of the Peewee Giants..</i>

2085
01:37:25,262 --> 01:37:26,297
