1
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:21,292
That's it.
100 honours, and 90 below.

2
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:24,087
Nicely done, Strangways,
I have to give it to you.

3
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,508
I must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, Professor.

4
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,592
Right.

5
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,553
Must you break off
at this time every evening?

6
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:37,600
My managing director has a call put
through to me every day about this time.

7
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,727
Hurry back.

8
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:43,272
20 minutes. And don't try
doctoring any hands for me.

9
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:46,859
Same again.

10
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,572
Bless you, master.

11
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,133
- Hurry, man.
- Get away, quick.

12
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,405
W6N, W6N, W6N.

13
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,949
Calling G7W.

14
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,285
How do you hear me? Over.

15
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,538
G7W London, G7W London.

16
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,332
Receiving you. Over.

17
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:47,211
Stand by to transmit. Wait. Out.

18
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,152
Here.

19
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:43,309
Hello, W6N. Over.

20
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,901
Foreman of signals - urgent.

21
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,326
Get me the Ml6 radio security control.

22
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,536
What is it?

23
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:05,832
W6N Kingston, Jamaica - broken contact
just after they came up on transmission.

24
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:09,127
- Broken or faded?
- Broken. We still have the carrier wave.

25
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,589
- On both emergency frequencies?
- No joy on either. I'm still calling.

26
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,925
Let me know as soon as they come up.

27
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:24,892
Foreman of signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

28
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:27,562
No, sir, it's not a technical fault.

29
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:29,313
Yes, sir.

30
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:31,274
Will you tell him, sir?

31
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,567
Very good.

32
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:42,785
- Excuse me, sir. Are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr James Bond.

33
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,706
- What name should I say?
- Just give him my card.

34
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:50,126
Would you like to leave
your coat over there?

35
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:37,090
The house will cover the difference?

36
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:53,272
- I need another thousand.
- I admire your courage, Miss...?

37
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,567
Trench... Sylvia Trench.

38
00:07:56,651 --> 00:08:00,029
I admire your luck, Mr...?

39
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,616
Bond... James Bond.

40
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,037
Mr Bond, I suppose you wouldn't
care to raise the limit?

41
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,082
I have no objections.

42
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,503
Now...

43
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:25,388
- Looks like you're out to get me.
- It's an idea, at that.

44
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,557
Eight.

45
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,604
- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.

46
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,816
AndrÃ©, I must pass the shoe.

47
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,862
I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.

48
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,327
Have those changed, will you?

49
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:56,294
Too bad you have to go.
Just as things were getting interesting.

50
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:57,920
Yes.

51
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,673
Tell me, Miss Trench,
do you play any other games?

52
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,843
I mean, besides <i>chemin de fer?</i>.

53
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:07,388
Golf, amongst other things.

54
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:10,475
- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow?

55
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:14,437
And we could have dinner
afterwards, perhaps?

56
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,231
Sounds tempting.

57
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:21,069
May I let you know in the morning?

58
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:23,613
Splendid.

59
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,616
My number's on the card.

60
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,802
See if he's there, will you?

61
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:53,226
James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you.

62
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:57,980
007 is here, sir.
He'll see you in a minute.

63
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,149
Moneypenny.

64
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:04,737
- What gives?
- Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.

65
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:08,366
You never take me
to dinner looking like this.

66
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:12,078
- You never take me to dinner. Period.
- I would, you know.

67
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:17,250
Only M would have me court-martialled
for illegal use of government property.

68
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:22,004
Flattery will get you nowhere.
But don't stop trying. Now...

69
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:26,134
- What's all this to-do about?
- Strangways. It looks serious.

70
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:31,264
We've been burning the air between here
and Jamaica for the last three hours.

71
00:10:31,347 --> 00:10:34,851
- In you go.
- Don't forget to write.

72
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,992
Good evening, sir.

73
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:55,538
It happens to be 3am.
When do you sleep, 007?

74
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,041
Never on the firm's time, sir.

75
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,209
Sit down.

76
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:08,426
Jamaica went off the air,
in the middle of the opening procedure.

77
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,013
We've checked up
and Strangways has disappeared.

78
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,850
So has his secretary.
We'd only just sent her out there.

79
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,936
Was Strangways on something special?

80
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,397
An inquiry from the Americans.

81
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:26,110
There is massive interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

82
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:30,114
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

83
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:33,785
- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.

84
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:39,999
Throwing the controls of a guided missile
off balance with a radio beam.

85
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:45,338
Five million dollars' worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the South Atlantic

86
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:49,342
and finishing up in the Brazilian jungle
is bad enough.

87
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,346
But now they're gonna try orbiting
a rocket round the moon.

88
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,767
The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.

89
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,311
A fellow by the name of Leiter.

90
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:04,857
I've heard of him, but never met him.
Has he found out anything important?

91
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:08,528
You'd better ask him.
You're on the 7 o'clock plane to Kingston.

92
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:13,658
That gives you exactly
three hours 22 minutes.

93
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:15,743
Armourer.

94
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:21,082
You'll get the background papers
at the airport, in a self-destructor bag.

95
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:24,127
You can study them during the flight.

96
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,588
I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.

97
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,549
Sir.

98
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,928
Take off your jacket.

99
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,477
Give me your gun.

100
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:48,276
This damn Beretta again.
I've told you about this before.

101
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:51,904
You tell him, for the last time.

102
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:56,951
Nice and light, in a lady's handbag.

103
00:12:57,035 --> 00:13:01,664
- No stopping power.
- Any comments, 007?

104
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:07,336
I disagree. I've used a Beretta for
ten years and never missed with it yet.

105
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,758
But it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital.

106
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:16,179
A double-O number means you're
licensed to kill, not get killed.

107
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:21,601
Since I've been head of Ml7, there's
been a 40 drop in double-O casualties.

108
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:25,313
I want it to stay that way.
You'll carry the Walther.

109
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:29,609
Unless you'd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties.

110
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,279
No, sir. I would not.

111
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:36,449
Then from now on
you carry a different gun. Show him.

112
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:44,374
Walther PPK: 7.65 mil with a delivery
like a brick through a plate-glass window.

113
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:48,586
Takes a Brausch silencer
with little reduction in muzzle velocity.

114
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:51,964
- The CIA swear by them.
- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.

115
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,841
Thank you, sir.

116
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,260
- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.

117
00:13:56,344 --> 00:14:00,306
- All right. Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

118
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,521
- 007.
- Sir?

119
00:14:06,604 --> 00:14:09,524
Just leave the Beretta.

120
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:31,587
Miss Moneypenny, forget
the usual repartee. 007's in a hurry.

121
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,599
Ciao.

122
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,768
Good luck.

123
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:29,187
There. Now you made me miss it.

124
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,816
You don't miss a thing.
How did you get in here?

125
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,402
I decided to accept your invitation.

126
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,115
That was for tomorrow afternoon.

127
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,118
Do you always dress this way for golf?

128
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:48,373
I changed into something more
comfortable. I hope I did the right thing.

129
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:52,460
You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.

130
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:56,339
- I have to leave immediately.
- That's too bad.

131
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:02,011
Just as things were
getting interesting again.

132
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,519
When did you say you had to leave?

133
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,437
Immediately.

134
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,484
Almost immediately.

135
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,832
Hello, New York. Your Pan Am 323
just landed Kingston, Jamaica.

136
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,278
Taxi.

137
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,865
- All right, then. Go ahead.
- Help yourself.

138
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:08,244
- Taxi.
- Mr Bond, sir?

139
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,163
Yes?

140
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:13,291
I'm Mr Jones,
chauffeur from Government House.

141
00:17:13,374 --> 00:17:16,586
That's fine. We can drop
my luggage off on the way.

142
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,714
- I want to check my reservation.
- I can do that.

143
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:23,134
No, no. You just take care of the bags.

144
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,613
- Government House?
- Yes.

145
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:47,450
- Principal Secretary, please.
- Hold the line, please.

146
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,832
- Who wants him?
- James Bond, Universal Exports.

147
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,293
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr Bond.

148
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,254
Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.

149
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:03,966
- Are you free for lunch at one o'clock?
- That'll suit me fine.

150
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,554
- By the way, have you sent a car for me?
- Car? I didn't think you wanted one.

151
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:11,391
Quite right.
One o'clock, then.

152
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:15,353
Forgive me if I'm a few minutes late.

153
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,666
- Where to first?
- Government House, but there's no hurry.

154
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,877
Just take me for a ride.

155
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,744
Do you always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.

156
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:17,832
Sorry, sir, but I think
there's some fellow trying to follow us.

157
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:24,547
Then I suggest you try and lose them.

158
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,693
Take the next turning on the right.

159
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,965
Now, Mr Jones. Talk fast,
before your friend doubles back.

160
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,385
Who are you working for?

161
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:15,390
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was just sent to meet you at the airport.

162
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:18,893
- But by whom?
- By...

163
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:21,479
- Government House.
- I don't think so.

164
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:25,733
Both hands on the wheel.
I'm a very nervous passenger.

165
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,153
Get out. Move!

166
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:32,615
Keep your hands where I can see them.

167
00:20:56,764 --> 00:20:59,017
Get up.

168
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,907
- Now talk.
- All right.

169
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:20,204
Let me have a cigarette.

170
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:36,304
To hell with you.

171
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:01,579
Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.

172
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:10,505
Cyanide in a cigarette? Fantastic.

173
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:13,383
- No less.
- Duff, what have you got for us?

174
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:18,721
The car was stolen and we haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.

175
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:21,015
But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.

176
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:26,270
- Well, news of my arrival leaked.
- We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.

177
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:31,484
Perhaps not. I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets.

178
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:34,028
Anything more we can do for you?

179
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:36,698
I want to meet the last people
to see Strangways.

180
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:40,159
Nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four.

181
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,495
- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent...

182
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:46,457
Metallurgist, runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

183
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:50,503
- Potter...
- Old general. Been here for ages.

184
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,548
- We'll start with those.
- Want them brought in?

185
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:58,344
- Lord, no. I want to meet them socially.
- I can introduce you at the club.

186
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:03,016
- I'd like to see Strangways' place.
- I'll run you up there now.

187
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,363
Go on in.

188
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,079
That's her blood patch.

189
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:29,751
- They've grouped it as O Rh positive.
- That's her group, all right.

190
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,555
The set was still switched on
when we came round.

191
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:45,725
We tried to get through,
but it was dead the other end.

192
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:51,272
And it'll stay dead. All frequencies are
changed immediately security's broken.

193
00:23:58,196 --> 00:24:01,866
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

194
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:06,371
- Geology a hobby of Strangways?
- Not that I know of, no.

195
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,880
Who's the man with Strangways?

196
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:21,094
- One of the local fishermen.
- He drove the car that tailed me.

197
00:24:21,177 --> 00:24:26,057
Is that so? That gives us something
to work on. I'll have him checked.

198
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,062
You do that. I want to change
before I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.

199
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:41,781
One medium-dry vodka martini.
Mixed like you said, and not stirred.

200
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:45,243
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.

201
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:06,657
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that.

202
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:11,871
Or is it? <i>Cherchez la femme.</i>
His secretary was very nice indeed.

203
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:15,458
- Did you know her?
- I've seen her around.

204
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,087
None of you can throw any light
on what happened to him?

205
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,632
His conversation? Any hint?

206
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:26,344
I never heard him talk about anything
but big-game fishing and bridge.

207
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:31,182
He got the fishing bug three weeks ago.
He's been out practically every day since.

208
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:33,434
It must have cost him something.

209
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:37,939
These fishermen ask the earth to charter,
and Quarrel's the most expensive of all.

210
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:40,149
- Quarrel?
- A Cayman Islander.

211
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:42,860
- He keeps a boat in the harbour.
- I see.

212
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,327
Thank you.

213
00:26:52,662 --> 00:26:55,164
Excuse me.
Where do I find Quarrel?

214
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,416
He him.

215
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:10,930
Your name Quarrel?

216
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:12,682
Maybe.

217
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:16,936
I'm a friend of Commander Strangways.

218
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,234
Ain't that nice?
I like people who's friends of people.

219
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:27,905
I thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him.

220
00:27:27,989 --> 00:27:30,908
As far as I know, nothing happened.

221
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:33,911
Unless you know different.

222
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:37,999
Where did you take him in your boat?

223
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:42,879
You see that, captain?
That there's the Caribbean.

224
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,840
That's where. Fishing.

225
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:49,635
I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.

226
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:51,888
It's not for hire.

227
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,432
Seems I came to the wrong address.

228
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:56,309
That's all right.

229
00:27:56,392 --> 00:28:00,563
If you'll excuse me,
I got business to attend to.

230
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,682
Pussfeller.

231
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:59,455
Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed.

232
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,667
You got the right one this time
if you likes good eating.

233
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,254
I do, if the conversation matches it.

234
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:11,634
Back at the boat too public.
In there it different.

235
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:13,511
After you.

236
00:29:13,594 --> 00:29:15,680
Sure thing.

237
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:25,148
- Hey, man! You see we get some privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel.

238
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:35,074
- Take a seat.
- I'm fine.

239
00:29:35,158 --> 00:29:39,620
OK, mister.
Supposin' you start the conversation.

240
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:41,789
How's about it?

241
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:56,471
Ain't no use you struggling.
Pussfeller wrestles alligators.

242
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:04,979
Right! Up slowly and face that wall.

243
00:30:14,447 --> 00:30:16,532
Hold it.

244
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:24,832
Gently, bud, gently.
Let's not get excited.

245
00:30:29,545 --> 00:30:32,048
Frisk him.

246
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:45,603
Nothing.

247
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,732
Interesting.
Where were you measured for this?

248
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:51,859
My tailor, Savile Row.

249
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:55,196
Is that so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

250
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,616
Felix Leiter.
Central Intelligence Agency.

251
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,995
- You must be James Bond.
- You mean we're fighting the same war?

252
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:09,002
When I saw you leave the airport with
the opposition, I figured I must be wrong.

253
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:11,129
This is Quarrel.

254
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:14,632
- No hard feelings, I hope?
- Only a sore hand. Glad to know you.

255
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:19,095
- Pussfeller owns the place.
- I hope he cooks better than he fights.

256
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,806
Nobody died from my cooking - yet.

257
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:01,763
There you are.
Cape Canaveral is screaming.

258
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:05,266
They don't want anything to go wrong
with this moon rocket launch.

259
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,853
Yet Strangways didn't think
the interference came from here?

260
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:13,858
- I suppose you cased the joint?
- I checked unofficially.

261
00:32:13,941 --> 00:32:17,028
You limeys can be touchy
about trespassing.

262
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,864
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the islands.

263
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:22,450
You found nothing?
Where did you look?

264
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:28,122
Just about everywhere.
Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.

265
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,959
- Checked them all thoroughly?
- All except Crab Key. We had no right.

266
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:35,213
- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...

267
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,885
Get her, Quarrel, and the camera.

268
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:47,141
Evening, missis.

269
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:50,687
You're hurting.

270
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,732
The captain wants you
to have a drink with us.

271
00:32:54,816 --> 00:32:58,861
- You're hurting me.
- You can't mean it.

272
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:09,122
Good evening.

273
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:18,673
- Why do you want another picture of me?
- I only got your hat at the airport.

274
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:22,510
- Tell this ape to let me go.
- Why do you want a picture at all?

275
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:26,055
Because that's the way I earn my living.

276
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:28,516
Who pays you?

277
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,519
<i>The Daily Gleaner.</i>

278
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:34,439
Pussfeller. Pussfeller.

279
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,360
- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?

280
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:44,407
She come here sometimes.
You want for me to get rid of her?

281
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,078
No. Just ring the <i>Gleaner.</i> Find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight.

282
00:33:50,204 --> 00:33:52,332
They didn't send me. I work freelance.

283
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:55,043
Freelance? For whom?

284
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:57,086
You...

285
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:01,466
Tell us and he'll stop.

286
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:11,976
We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want me to break her arm?

287
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,562
Another time.

288
00:34:17,857 --> 00:34:21,611
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.

289
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,031
Run along, freelance.

290
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:29,118
You'll be sorry.
You'll all be sorry, you rats.

291
00:34:33,331 --> 00:34:38,419
One takes cyanide, another would have
had her arm broken. Neither would talk.

292
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:43,341
- Who puts that sort of scare into people?
- I think maybe we'd better find out fast.

293
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:46,302
You were talking about Crab Key?
Why can't we go there?

294
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:50,598
It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

295
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:53,851
I had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look.

296
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:58,564
They found nothing but a bauxite mine.
Low-scan CH radar setup.

297
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:03,444
- There's nothing illegal about that.
- Crab Key scares me plenty.

298
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:06,531
Friends of mine went out
there once after seashells.

299
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:09,033
Only trouble, they never came back again.

300
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:11,619
The local fishermen won't go near it.

301
00:35:11,703 --> 00:35:13,955
Strangways and me, we slip in at night.

302
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:17,834
He take some samples, we came straight
back. Don't do to hang about there.

303
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:23,089
- What kind of samples?
- Bits of rock, sand, water.

304
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:26,175
I see.

305
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:28,761
Crab Key begins to interest me.

306
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:31,514
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

307
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:34,642
Nothing much. Except his name.

308
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,769
Dr No.

309
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:15,016
- I'd like to see Professor Dent.
- Have you an appointment?

310
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,852
James Bond.
We met yesterday at the club.

311
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:21,481
Very well.
He's somewhere in the lab.

312
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:23,649
Is Professor Dent there?

313
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,820
Oh, never mind.

314
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,990
Morning, Professor.

315
00:36:31,074 --> 00:36:33,368
Mr Bond.
Anything I can do for you?

316
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:37,580
Yes. I came across this
in Strangways' office.

317
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:39,832
Your receipt.

318
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:44,921
- Yes, that's right.
- Can you tell me anything about it?

319
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:49,592
Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.

320
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:53,971
He brought some samples in for testing,
convinced they were valuable.

321
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:55,807
Were they?

322
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,018
Of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

323
00:36:59,102 --> 00:37:03,564
- Can I see them?
- I threw 'em away.

324
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:08,486
- Do you know where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.

325
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:13,324
- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.

326
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:17,704
- Why so certain?
- Not geologically possible.

327
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:21,624
Thank you, Professor. It's very kind of you
to spare me your time.

328
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,876
You're very welcome, Mr Bond.

329
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,462
Professor...

330
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:31,092
Allow me.

331
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:36,180
Morning.

332
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:58,244
- I have to get to Crab Key.
- You know the procedure.

333
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:01,622
There's no time for that.
I'll take responsibility.

334
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:04,834
- Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
- Come on.

335
00:38:48,836 --> 00:38:52,382
- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.

336
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:39,512
Sit down.

337
00:39:47,228 --> 00:39:51,524
Why have you disobeyed
my strictest rule and come in daylight?

338
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:55,069
I had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.

339
00:39:55,153 --> 00:40:01,367
Yes, I know. I gave orders that he should
be killed. Why is he still alive?

340
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:04,829
- Our attempts failed.
- Your attempts failed.

341
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:09,417
I do not like failure. You are not
going to fail me again, Professor.

342
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,587
No. I came to warn you.

343
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,090
- Warn me?
- Tell you.

344
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:19,844
Bond has discovered
those rock samples came from Crab Key.

345
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:22,305
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

346
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:26,476
I hope not. If he does,
I shall hold you responsible.

347
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,645
Do I make myself clear?

348
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:32,065
Yes, quite clear.

349
00:40:33,107 --> 00:40:36,027
Go to the table.

350
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,958
You see what is in the cage?

351
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,504
Pick it up.

352
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:58,466
Pick it up.

353
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,809
Tonight.

354
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:26,911
- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.

355
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:33,501
The car you ordered has been delivered.
It's in number five parking lot.

356
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:37,130
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, Mr Bond.

357
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:42,482
- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Bond.

358
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:48,279
Sorry to trouble you so early. I need
all you have on Dr No and Crab Key.

359
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:52,575
Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr No.

360
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:56,829
- What do you know about this island?
- Not much, except there's a bauxite mine.

361
00:44:56,913 --> 00:44:59,666
Dr No runs it like a concentration camp.

362
00:44:59,749 --> 00:45:03,294
I've heard rumours,
but no one's complained officially.

363
00:45:04,712 --> 00:45:08,716
- Miss Taro, just leave them here.
- We can't find them anywhere.

364
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,555
- What do you mean? Who had them last?
- Commander Strangways. Both files.

365
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:16,724
All right, Miss Taro.

366
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:20,853
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

367
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:23,439
On the contrary.

368
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:26,609
I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.

369
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:31,906
By the way, that came for you
from London, in the diplomatic pouch.

370
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:39,580
A present from home.

371
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,169
Can I get out that way?

372
00:45:57,974 --> 00:46:01,769
That's a naughty habit -
listening at keyholes.

373
00:46:01,853 --> 00:46:04,856
I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.

374
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:07,692
Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.

375
00:46:07,775 --> 00:46:11,320
Forget it.
It's not very important anyhow.

376
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:14,991
I'd hate to think you were spending
all afternoon looking for them.

377
00:46:15,074 --> 00:46:17,452
No. I have the afternoon off.

378
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:22,123
There's a coincidence. So have I.
Why don't you show me round the island?

379
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:25,710
What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?

380
00:46:25,793 --> 00:46:27,670
You should say yes.

381
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,173
I should say maybe.

382
00:46:30,256 --> 00:46:33,968
Three o'clock at my hotel... maybe?

383
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:37,930
- Yes, maybe.
- Good.

384
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:52,904
The luminous dial activates it.
Hold this.

385
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:56,908
Where exactly did
Strangways place those samples?

386
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:59,911
- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.

387
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,960
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

388
00:47:08,044 --> 00:47:12,215
- Lose something?
- Take a look at this Geiger reading.

389
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:19,514
Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key were radioactive.

390
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:23,393
Yet Professor Dent told me they were
worthless chunks of iron ore.

391
00:47:23,476 --> 00:47:27,271
- He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.
- I intend to find out which.

392
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:30,358
Quarrel, how soon can you
get us over to Crab Key?

393
00:47:30,441 --> 00:47:34,028
Well, it's like this here, captain.

394
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:37,240
Strangways, he done take samples
of all the islands.

395
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:41,703
- We could check the nearest ones first.
- No. It's Crab Key I'm interested in.

396
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:45,498
I done take the commander there.
We got away without trouble.

397
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:49,085
It don't do for a man
to tempt providence too often.

398
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:52,213
- You see, there's a dragon.
- What?

399
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:57,010
Native superstition.
Started by Dr No, probably.

400
00:47:57,093 --> 00:47:59,637
All right, Quarrel. We won't force you.

401
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:03,307
Leiter and I will go after dark,
if you'll give us directions.

402
00:48:03,391 --> 00:48:09,772
I gets my navigational directions
from my nose, my ears - my instincts.

403
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:13,943
Anyway, I'll be here about seven.

404
00:48:15,236 --> 00:48:17,030
Fine.

405
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:26,539
Mr Bond, there's
a telephone message for you.

406
00:48:26,622 --> 00:48:29,751
Johnny, what have you done with it?

407
00:48:52,273 --> 00:48:53,941
Hello?

408
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:56,069
Mr Bond.

409
00:48:56,152 --> 00:49:00,698
I was thinking, why don't you
collect me at my apartment?

410
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:05,995
It's lovely up here in the mountains.
Nice and cool.

411
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,039
All right.

412
00:49:08,122 --> 00:49:11,292
You leave the Port Royal road
out of Kingston,

413
00:49:11,376 --> 00:49:16,214
then along the Windward Road,
until you get to the cement factory.

414
00:49:16,297 --> 00:49:18,466
Then you turn left.

415
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:22,595
Follow the road up the hill,
down the other side,

416
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:25,890
then two miles further on, on the left,

417
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:29,352
Magenta Drive 239.

418
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,148
I'll be waiting for you.

419
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:16,334
How did it happen?

420
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:20,296
I think they were
on their way to a funeral.

421
00:51:40,024 --> 00:51:42,777
Just a minute.

422
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:55,456
- You did invite me, remember?
- Of course.

423
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,168
I just didn't expect you here so soon.

424
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:02,338
Yes, come in.

425
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:08,678
I'll just go and put some clothes on.

426
00:52:08,761 --> 00:52:12,098
Don't go to any trouble on my account.

427
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:14,976
Please.

428
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:19,439
Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.

429
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:26,988
I feel one of us should answer it.

430
00:52:33,911 --> 00:52:35,038
Hello.

431
00:52:35,121 --> 00:52:37,832
Yes. I know, he's here now.

432
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:45,298
I don't know what happened.

433
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:50,345
Right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.

434
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:54,807
I'll have to go now.
I'll call you later.

435
00:52:58,353 --> 00:53:01,230
You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.

436
00:53:01,314 --> 00:53:03,191
What do you mean?

437
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:07,445
Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.

438
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:13,117
- It's rather beautiful.
- Thank you.

439
00:53:13,201 --> 00:53:16,204
- Do you always wear it up?
- Don't you like it that way?

440
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:18,206
Yes, very much.

441
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:23,044
With your sort of face, it's wonderful.

442
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:28,007
- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.

443
00:53:28,091 --> 00:53:31,427
Look. No hands.

444
00:53:46,192 --> 00:53:49,737
I'm hungry. Let's go out and eat.

445
00:53:49,821 --> 00:53:55,493
- I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.
- I'm feeling Italian and musical.

446
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:59,247
- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.

447
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:02,291
It's more fun... alone.

448
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:05,586
Yes, but I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.

449
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:10,258
- I like cooking.
- Forget it. May I use your phone?

450
00:54:12,468 --> 00:54:14,554
Who are you ringing?

451
00:54:14,637 --> 00:54:16,723
Taxi.

452
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:23,312
James Bond here. Can I have
a car sent to 2171 Magenta Drive?

453
00:54:23,396 --> 00:54:26,524
As soon as you can, please.
Thank you.

454
00:54:27,692 --> 00:54:31,946
- I thought you came by car.
- Damn thing wouldn't start.

455
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,532
That explains...

456
00:54:35,283 --> 00:54:36,993
Explains what?

457
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:39,620
Why you need a taxi.

458
00:54:39,704 --> 00:54:42,081
Why I need a taxi?

459
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:45,293
Careful - my nail varnish.

460
00:54:55,094 --> 00:54:58,848
- The lights.
- No, I always leave them on.

461
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:06,731
- What's going on?
- Book her, Superintendent, will you?

462
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:08,900
And...

463
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:12,654
be careful of her nail varnish.

464
00:57:36,673 --> 00:57:39,384
Drop it, Professor, and behind you.

465
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:48,559
It's funny, I thought you'd turn up
sooner or later. Sit down.

466
00:57:50,687 --> 00:57:52,772
The girl talked?

467
00:57:52,855 --> 00:57:54,691
But of course.

468
00:57:54,774 --> 00:57:57,568
I was suspicious
at the Queens Club anyhow.

469
00:57:57,652 --> 00:58:01,322
You were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.

470
00:58:02,657 --> 00:58:04,742
And then later at the lab,

471
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:10,957
you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.

472
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,959
Very clever, Mr Bond.

473
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:18,756
You're up against more than you know. If
you shoot me, you'll end like Strangways.

474
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,885
- And you killed him?
- He was killed, but never mind how.

475
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:25,763
Who are you working for, Professor?

476
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:29,684
You might as well know, as you won't live.
I'm working for...

477
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:37,233
It's a Smith & Wesson.
And you've had your six.

478
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:56,836
- Better late than never.
- Everything ready?

479
00:58:56,919 --> 00:59:00,048
Yeah, for the last two hours.

480
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:03,760
Don't worry, Quarrel. It'll be fine.

481
00:59:03,843 --> 00:59:08,181
Bottom part of where my belly
used to be tells me different.

482
00:59:08,264 --> 00:59:11,100
For me, Crab Key will be
a gentle relaxation.

483
00:59:11,184 --> 00:59:15,063
- From what? Dames?
- No, from being a clay pigeon.

484
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:50,890
This is as far as we go with the engine.
Make with paddle and wind from now on.

485
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:53,059
OK.

486
00:59:55,895 --> 00:59:59,607
- Let me go with you.
- No, we settled that. It's my beat.

487
00:59:59,691 --> 01:00:02,819
But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.

488
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:06,072
Canaveral can only wait
48 hours for that moonshot.

489
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:11,869
If we're not back in 12, then it's your beat.
You'd better bring your marines with you.

490
01:00:11,953 --> 01:00:16,124
Quarrel, if you see a dragon, get in first
and breathe on him, you hear?

491
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:19,794
With all that rum in you, he'll die happy.

492
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:50,992
Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.

493
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:02,503
Hard about, captain. Now!

494
01:01:30,031 --> 01:01:32,408
Cover it up.

495
01:01:32,492 --> 01:01:37,830
We'd better get some sleep before
it gets light. I'll be down this end.

496
01:02:55,325 --> 01:02:57,827
Who is that?

497
01:03:03,082 --> 01:03:07,295
It's all right. I'm not supposed
to be here, either. I take it you're not.

498
01:03:07,378 --> 01:03:12,008
- Are you alone?
- What are you doing? Looking for shells?

499
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:16,137
- No, I'm just looking.
- Stay where you are.

500
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,186
- I promise I won't steal your shells.
- I promise you you won't, either.

501
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:28,316
- Stay where you are.
- My intentions are strictly honourable.

502
01:03:48,419 --> 01:03:50,797
What's your name?

503
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,341
- Ryder.
- Ryder what?

504
01:03:53,424 --> 01:03:55,551
Honey Ryder.

505
01:03:56,594 --> 01:04:01,391
- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.

506
01:04:02,934 --> 01:04:06,896
- What's your name?
- James.

507
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:11,609
Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?

508
01:04:11,693 --> 01:04:13,778
Of course. I always do.

509
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:16,823
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

510
01:04:16,906 --> 01:04:22,495
My boat is too small to be noticed.
And I often come here to get the shells.

511
01:04:22,578 --> 01:04:25,873
At first they tried to catch me,
but they couldn't.

512
01:04:25,957 --> 01:04:30,336
- Now they don't bother any more.
- They will this time.

513
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,633
- Don't bother with those now.
- Don't bother?

514
01:04:35,717 --> 01:04:37,802
Are they valuable?

515
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:42,473
This one is worth $50 in Miami. 50.

516
01:04:45,476 --> 01:04:48,187
You promise you won't tell anyone?

517
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:49,939
I promise.

518
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:53,401
- Hey, come and take a look.
- It's all right. He's with me.

519
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:57,363
Captain, what do you think of that?

520
01:04:59,324 --> 01:05:01,409
What's the matter?

521
01:05:05,163 --> 01:05:09,334
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover. Come on.

522
01:05:36,903 --> 01:05:39,405
They're here all right.

523
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:42,492
OK, folks!
Come out and you won't get hurt.

524
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:48,623
Stand up and show yourselves
or I'll be forced to open fire.

525
01:05:51,084 --> 01:05:54,545
Come on out.
We know you're there.

526
01:05:54,629 --> 01:05:59,342
We've been expecting you. Walk out
with your hands up and you'll be OK.

527
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:04,305
- This is your last chance.
- He's bluffing. Keep your head down.

528
01:06:05,056 --> 01:06:08,976
All right! You've been warned. This is it.

529
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:12,563
Lie still. It won't last long.
They don't really know we're here.

530
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:14,732
Fire!

531
01:06:27,829 --> 01:06:29,664
Are you coming out?

532
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:31,791
All right, then.

533
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:33,960
We'll be back.

534
01:06:34,043 --> 01:06:37,630
We'll be back with the dogs.
Full speed ahead.

535
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:02,655
I warned you about this place.

536
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:05,408
That was a machine gun, not a dragon.

537
01:07:05,491 --> 01:07:07,744
- There's a dragon here, too.
- She's right.

538
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:10,621
- You've seen it?
- Yes, I have.

539
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:17,045
He had two glaring eyes, a short tail,
pointed wings, and was breathing fire.

540
01:07:17,128 --> 01:07:19,213
You don't believe me, do you?

541
01:07:19,297 --> 01:07:23,634
Little gal, I does. I tell you, Mr Bond,
let's get the hell outta here.

542
01:07:23,718 --> 01:07:27,347
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

543
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:32,185
You saw something that looked like one.
I'm trying to think what it was.

544
01:07:32,268 --> 01:07:37,857
How do you know there aren't?
Did you ever see a mongoose dance?

545
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:41,527
Or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death?

546
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:44,739
Or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love?

547
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:47,825
- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.

548
01:07:47,909 --> 01:07:50,328
She's right.

549
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:54,123
All right, they've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.

550
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:57,377
I'm getting out when I'm ready,
and that's never in daylight.

551
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:02,423
This time you are, and fast.
Where's your boat?

552
01:08:02,507 --> 01:08:05,426
Fetch my shoes.

553
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:16,437
Look! Look what they've done.
It's all your fault.

554
01:08:17,897 --> 01:08:22,402
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

555
01:08:22,485 --> 01:08:25,530
What are we going to do with her now?

556
01:08:25,613 --> 01:08:28,783
If you like, I know
a good place where we can hide.

557
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:33,246
That'll do for a start.
Leave the things you don't need. Quick!

558
01:08:56,728 --> 01:09:02,275
- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.

559
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:06,154
- Damn mosquitoes.
- Rub water all over yourself.

560
01:09:06,237 --> 01:09:09,365
It's the salt they're after.

561
01:09:14,203 --> 01:09:16,956
Quick! They's coming, across there.

562
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:24,130
Quarrel, cut some of those reeds.
Give me the knife.

563
01:09:24,213 --> 01:09:26,090
Over there.

564
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:40,188
They're coming closer.

565
01:09:40,271 --> 01:09:42,357
- Keep quiet.
- Something's biting me.

566
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:45,610
If you disturb the mud,
they'll know we're here. Get down.

567
01:10:10,176 --> 01:10:12,387
Looks like they're onto something.

568
01:10:57,473 --> 01:10:59,934
Get down.

569
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:39,557
- Why?
- Because I had to.

570
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:43,227
He sure knew his business,
trailing us after we let the others pass.

571
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:46,064
We must get out of here.
Where is this hiding place?

572
01:11:46,147 --> 01:11:48,441
Up there.

573
01:11:49,984 --> 01:11:51,194
Come on.

574
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,249
You smell nicer already.

575
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,543
Thank you.

576
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:10,338
Mr Bond, quick!

577
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,343
- What is it now?
- Look at these.

578
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:20,848
Those are dragon tracks.

579
01:12:20,932 --> 01:12:23,726
That's where he breathed.

580
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:29,232
You ought to get some rest if you want to.
I stay out here on watch.

581
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:34,278
- In case he comes a-Iooking for us.
- Right. I'll take the second watch.

582
01:12:35,321 --> 01:12:38,449
We'll be out of here by midnight.

583
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:43,621
I never met a detective before.

584
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:48,001
- Are you going to arrest Dr No?
- Someone is.

585
01:12:48,084 --> 01:12:51,587
We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.

586
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:54,215
He doesn't just try.

587
01:12:54,298 --> 01:12:57,885
- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.
- What do you mean by that?

588
01:12:57,969 --> 01:13:01,848
You see, my father
was a marine zoologist.

589
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:05,518
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

590
01:13:05,601 --> 01:13:09,897
Then one day he came to Crab Key,
and I never saw him again.

591
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:16,112
They said he must have been drowned,
but he was far too good a diver for that.

592
01:13:16,195 --> 01:13:18,948
Didn't the police investigate?
Or your family?

593
01:13:19,032 --> 01:13:22,035
They investigated for a long time.

594
01:13:22,118 --> 01:13:24,954
Then they said
"Missing, presumed dead".

595
01:13:25,038 --> 01:13:28,166
I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.

596
01:13:28,249 --> 01:13:31,711
You mean you're here all alone?
Where did you live before?

597
01:13:31,794 --> 01:13:34,172
All over the world.

598
01:13:34,255 --> 01:13:38,426
The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.
Anywhere there were shells.

599
01:13:38,509 --> 01:13:43,389
- You went to school somewhere?
- No need. We had an encyclopedia.

600
01:13:43,473 --> 01:13:47,435
I started at A when I was eight,
and now I've reached T.

601
01:13:47,518 --> 01:13:51,606
I bet I know a lot more things than you do.

602
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:54,776
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

603
01:13:54,859 --> 01:13:59,864
Well, there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

604
01:13:59,947 --> 01:14:03,284
He let me stay on
for a while without paying.

605
01:14:03,368 --> 01:14:08,164
Then one night he came up
to my room... Well, you know.

606
01:14:08,831 --> 01:14:14,128
I scratched his face, and then...
But he was stronger than I was.

607
01:14:14,212 --> 01:14:17,715
What happened after that?

608
01:14:17,799 --> 01:14:22,095
I put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

609
01:14:22,178 --> 01:14:26,933
A female, and they're the worst.
It took him a whole week to die.

610
01:14:29,936 --> 01:14:32,438
Did I do wrong?

611
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:36,150
Well, it wouldn't do to make a habit of it.

612
01:14:38,194 --> 01:14:41,739
Do you have a woman of your own?

613
01:14:43,783 --> 01:14:46,577
Captain, quick! Down here.

614
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:49,664
Whatever's coming,
it's coming this way.

615
01:14:49,747 --> 01:14:52,250
This time I want to see it.

616
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:55,378
And hurry -
there's less than 12 hours to go.

617
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:26,075
Stay where you are. All of you.
Stay right where you are.

618
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:39,630
OK, captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?

619
01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:42,842
A dragon that runs on diesel engines.
Forget the spooks.

620
01:15:42,925 --> 01:15:46,637
You take the driver.
I'll take the headlights and the tyres.

621
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:49,682
You keep safe out of sight.

622
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,514
- I told you to stay there.
- I was frightened.

623
01:16:44,654 --> 01:16:48,199
Come on out.
Hands where we can see 'em.

624
01:16:49,492 --> 01:16:51,786
And the dame. Quick.

625
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:55,164
Unless you want an extra navel.

626
01:16:56,624 --> 01:16:58,793
Hold it. Drop that gun.

627
01:17:00,586 --> 01:17:03,506
Now kick it away from you.

628
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:09,846
The girl stays where she is.
Walk towards me, hands out in front.

629
01:17:19,856 --> 01:17:21,316
Come on.

630
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:24,902
Hey, you.
Where do you think you're going?

631
01:17:25,903 --> 01:17:30,158
Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.

632
01:17:30,241 --> 01:17:32,327
Come on. Let's go.

633
01:17:37,498 --> 01:17:40,418
Give me that knife.

634
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:56,142
- Leave him alone.
- Get out of the way.

635
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,120
Get inside.
Keep an eye on the man.

636
01:18:16,204 --> 01:18:21,542
And be careful. They've been
in the swamp and they're contaminated.

637
01:18:23,628 --> 01:18:26,756
Check their Geiger reading.

638
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,224
- He's reading 95, chief.
- She's 88.

639
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:39,811
Too much for the monitor.
Scrub them down, but quick.

640
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:05,586
- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.

641
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:08,047
All right, then. Take off all their clothes.

642
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:11,759
- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says. We're contaminated.

643
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:14,929
- Do the girl first.
- We give the orders around here.

644
01:19:15,013 --> 01:19:19,392
That's fine, but do something
about this, will you? Come here.

645
01:19:20,643 --> 01:19:24,147
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

646
01:19:31,779 --> 01:19:34,282
68.

647
01:19:36,034 --> 01:19:39,370
- She's reading 47.
- All right. Put the man through.

648
01:19:40,538 --> 01:19:43,458
He's now clocking 40.

649
01:19:45,877 --> 01:19:48,379
Reading 38.

650
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:51,549
32.

651
01:19:51,632 --> 01:19:54,177
- Down to 8.
- Hold the girl.

652
01:19:56,596 --> 01:19:59,098
He's now 18.

653
01:20:01,768 --> 01:20:04,270
He's now at 8.

654
01:20:06,814 --> 01:20:09,776
- Practically zero. She's clear.
- Get the man ready.

655
01:20:15,448 --> 01:20:18,534
- He's got a count of four.
- Check his fingernails.

656
01:20:18,618 --> 01:20:20,703
Put your hand in there.

657
01:20:21,996 --> 01:20:25,625
- He's OK.
- I will notify reception they are coming.

658
01:20:26,459 --> 01:20:30,171
Decontamination here.
They're coming through now.

659
01:20:57,740 --> 01:21:00,451
Come in.

660
01:21:01,327 --> 01:21:03,997
Come in.
You poor dears.

661
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,335
We didn't know when to expect you. First
it was teatime yesterday, then dinner.

662
01:21:09,419 --> 01:21:12,755
It was only half an hour ago
we really knew you were on your way.

663
01:21:12,839 --> 01:21:16,592
Cigarette?
American, English, or Turkish?

664
01:21:16,676 --> 01:21:21,264
I'm Sister Rose, this is Sister Lily. We'll
make your stay as pleasant as possible.

665
01:21:21,347 --> 01:21:25,768
- That's most kind of you, but...
- Of course. You want to see your rooms.

666
01:21:25,852 --> 01:21:30,023
Breakfast is ordered,
and then you'll want to sleep.

667
01:21:32,775 --> 01:21:36,696
The doctor left orders you're not
to be disturbed until this evening.

668
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:40,366
He'll be delighted if you join him
for dinner. Shall I say you will?

669
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:44,454
- Tell him I also will be delighted.
- Splendid. I know he'll be pleased.

670
01:21:44,537 --> 01:21:47,040
Here we are.

671
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:52,170
This will be your room, Mr Bond.

672
01:21:52,253 --> 01:21:55,548
This is your bathroom in here.

673
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:58,343
And for you, young lady...

674
01:21:58,426 --> 01:22:01,346
this is your room.

675
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:06,309
You'll find fresh clothes in here.

676
01:22:08,478 --> 01:22:12,649
I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.

677
01:22:12,732 --> 01:22:16,194
Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything at all you want.

678
01:22:16,277 --> 01:22:19,906
Such as two air tickets to London?

679
01:22:19,989 --> 01:22:23,743
I'll leave you two dear people in peace.

680
01:22:36,923 --> 01:22:41,636
- Let's have some breakfast.
- How can you eat at a time like this?

681
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:46,057
Because I'm hungry and we don't know
when we'll get the chance to eat again.

682
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,225
Take this.

683
01:22:47,308 --> 01:22:51,896
Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

684
01:23:02,323 --> 01:23:04,951
Have you...

685
01:23:05,034 --> 01:23:07,745
Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?

686
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:10,248
No idea.

687
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:13,459
No door handles or windows, either.

688
01:23:15,878 --> 01:23:21,801
- It's a prison, then.
- Mink-lined with first-class service.

689
01:23:24,554 --> 01:23:26,639
What's the matter?

690
01:23:27,807 --> 01:23:30,310
I don't feel so good.

691
01:23:31,728 --> 01:23:34,647
I feel so sleepy.

692
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,694
Damn coffee.

693
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,312
How do you feel?

694
01:24:57,897 --> 01:24:59,983
Sleepy.

695
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:06,572
- What made us pass out like that?
- The coffee. It was drugged.

696
01:25:11,202 --> 01:25:14,414
It's time for dinner.
We mustn't keep the doctor waiting.

697
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:18,292
That would never do.
You ready, Honey?

698
01:25:18,376 --> 01:25:20,461
I suppose so.

699
01:25:25,299 --> 01:25:28,094
You're doing fine.

700
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:32,807
Come on.

701
01:25:34,225 --> 01:25:36,519
Am I properly dressed for the occasion?

702
01:25:36,602 --> 01:25:40,148
- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?

703
01:25:52,118 --> 01:25:54,620
This way, please.

704
01:25:57,582 --> 01:26:00,084
I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.

705
01:26:00,168 --> 01:26:05,089
Of course I'm scared, too.
Be natural and leave all the talking to me.

706
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:07,300
In here, please.

707
01:26:07,383 --> 01:26:10,511
I hope you enjoy your dinner.

708
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,902
Come and look.

709
01:27:16,786 --> 01:27:21,082
Artificial light. We could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea here.

710
01:27:21,165 --> 01:27:25,128
Look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200ft.

711
01:27:25,211 --> 01:27:28,840
One million dollars, Mr Bond.

712
01:27:28,923 --> 01:27:32,969
- You were wondering what it cost.
- As a matter of fact I was.

713
01:27:40,852 --> 01:27:44,522
Forgive my not shaking hands.
It's awkward with these. A misfortune.

714
01:27:44,605 --> 01:27:48,651
You were admiring my aquarium.

715
01:27:48,735 --> 01:27:50,945
Yes. It's quite impressive.

716
01:27:51,029 --> 01:27:54,991
A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.

717
01:27:55,074 --> 01:27:59,579
The glass is convex, ten inches thick,
hence the magnifying effect.

718
01:27:59,662 --> 01:28:04,625
Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr No.

719
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:09,714
It depends, Mr Bond, on which side
of the glass you are.

720
01:28:09,797 --> 01:28:13,468
A medium dry martini,
lemon peel, shaken, not stirred.

721
01:28:13,551 --> 01:28:16,471
- Vodka?
- Of course.

722
01:28:16,554 --> 01:28:19,432
We'll have dinner at once.

723
01:28:19,515 --> 01:28:23,519
There's so much to discuss, so little time.

724
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:48,711
Dr No, you haven't done badly,
considering.

725
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:51,172
A handicap is what you make of it.

726
01:28:51,255 --> 01:28:54,050
I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary

727
01:28:54,133 --> 01:28:56,511
and a Chinese girl of good family.

728
01:28:56,594 --> 01:29:01,432
Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

729
01:29:01,516 --> 01:29:06,104
It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

730
01:29:06,187 --> 01:29:08,690
I doubt they shall do so again.

731
01:29:08,773 --> 01:29:12,443
I escaped to America
with ten million of their dollars in gold.

732
01:29:12,527 --> 01:29:15,446
That's how you financed this operation.

733
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:19,701
It was a good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad you can handle it properly.

734
01:29:19,784 --> 01:29:24,622
I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

735
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:28,876
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity,

736
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,422
but not without costs, as you see.

737
01:29:33,006 --> 01:29:34,841
Yes.

738
01:29:34,924 --> 01:29:40,138
Your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time.

739
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:42,515
They are still puzzled.

740
01:29:42,598 --> 01:29:45,351
Not any longer.
I sent a complete report.

741
01:29:45,435 --> 01:29:50,356
You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

742
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:54,193
But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr No.

743
01:29:54,277 --> 01:29:56,863
Our own, the CIA's...

744
01:29:57,947 --> 01:30:00,908
The one from the Tong society
that you robbed.

745
01:30:00,992 --> 01:30:05,163
When trouble comes, you'll find this is
a very small and naked little island.

746
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:07,582
An expendable little island, Mr Bond.

747
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:11,210
When my mission is accomplished,
I destroy it and move on.

748
01:30:11,294 --> 01:30:15,882
But the habit of enquiry is consistent.
You're wondering why, where, when.

749
01:30:15,965 --> 01:30:18,051
I only gratify your curiosity

750
01:30:18,134 --> 01:30:21,679
because you're the one man capable of
appreciating what I have done...

751
01:30:22,764 --> 01:30:25,558
and keeping it to himself.

752
01:30:26,142 --> 01:30:31,856
Just a minute. There's no point involving
the girl. She has nothing to do with us.

753
01:30:31,939 --> 01:30:35,026
Let her go free.
She'll promise not to talk.

754
01:30:35,109 --> 01:30:37,904
- No, I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.

755
01:30:37,987 --> 01:30:42,867
I agree. This is no place
for the girl. Take her away.

756
01:30:44,118 --> 01:30:45,912
No.

757
01:30:46,621 --> 01:30:49,457
- No.
- I'm sure the guards will amuse her.

758
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,626
Let me go!

759
01:30:53,169 --> 01:30:57,924
That's a Dom PÃ©rignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.

760
01:31:01,803 --> 01:31:04,931
I prefer the '53 myself.

761
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:09,268
Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

762
01:31:09,352 --> 01:31:12,981
I'm not a fool,
so please do not treat me as one.

763
01:31:13,064 --> 01:31:16,609
And that table knife, please put it back.

764
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:21,614
We can't all be geniuses, can we?

765
01:31:21,698 --> 01:31:26,828
Does the toppling of American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?

766
01:31:27,954 --> 01:31:30,581
Missiles are the first step
to prove our power.

767
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:35,670
Our power? Your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the East.

768
01:31:35,753 --> 01:31:39,632
East, West - just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

769
01:31:39,716 --> 01:31:42,427
- I'm a member of SPECTRE.
- SPECTRE?

770
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:49,017
Special Executive for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.

771
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:53,604
The four cornerstones of power, headed
by the greatest brains in the world.

772
01:31:53,688 --> 01:31:56,190
Correction. Criminal brains.

773
01:31:56,274 --> 01:32:00,320
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.

774
01:32:00,403 --> 01:32:06,367
Why become criminal? The West would
welcome a scientist of your calibre.

775
01:32:07,243 --> 01:32:10,621
The Americans are fools.
They refused my services.

776
01:32:10,705 --> 01:32:15,251
So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.

777
01:32:15,335 --> 01:32:19,547
World domination.
That same old dream.

778
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:23,926
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon or God.

779
01:32:29,349 --> 01:32:34,646
You persist in trying to provoke me.
I could've had you killed in the swamp.

780
01:32:34,729 --> 01:32:36,939
And why didn't you?

781
01:32:37,023 --> 01:32:42,153
I thought you less stupid.
Usually, when a man gets in my way...

782
01:32:46,658 --> 01:32:50,078
But you were different.
You cost me time, money, effort.

783
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:53,581
You damaged my organisation,
and my pride.

784
01:32:54,457 --> 01:32:56,668
I was curious to see what you were like.

785
01:32:56,751 --> 01:32:59,545
I thought there might be
a place for you with SPECTRE.

786
01:32:59,629 --> 01:33:02,256
I'm flattered.

787
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:05,802
I'd prefer the revenge department.

788
01:33:05,885 --> 01:33:10,765
Of course, my first job would be finding
the killer of Strangways and Quarrel.

789
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:15,728
Unfortunately I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman...

790
01:33:18,606 --> 01:33:21,901
whose luck has run out.

791
01:33:21,985 --> 01:33:25,530
They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr No.

792
01:33:25,613 --> 01:33:29,701
No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.

793
01:33:29,784 --> 01:33:35,873
You won't get away with it this time.
The Americans are prepared for trouble.

794
01:33:35,957 --> 01:33:39,293
I never fail, Mr Bond.

795
01:33:39,377 --> 01:33:43,840
- What do we do with him?
- Soften him up. I haven't finished yet.

796
01:39:24,764 --> 01:39:27,725
Have you got new fuel elements loaded?

797
01:39:27,809 --> 01:39:29,894
All ready, sir.

798
01:39:31,938 --> 01:39:35,274
The roadblock is about 3,000 feet away.

799
01:39:35,358 --> 01:39:39,320
Everyone in that area is pulled back.
No traffic allowed.

800
01:39:39,404 --> 01:39:43,116
The launch area is completely
cleared for safety...

801
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:56,087
The vehicle is now at
its full weight of 240 tons.

802
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:59,716
All the automatic transistors
have been put onto the vehicle.

803
01:39:59,799 --> 01:40:02,343
We will run up to half power
for 30 seconds.

804
01:40:06,222 --> 01:40:11,602
Control interlocks free.
Fuel elements 12.5.

805
01:40:30,455 --> 01:40:31,956
Control?

806
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:37,337
Control rod actuators operating.
Core temperature 113.

807
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:42,383
- Converters?
- Standing by. Ignition heaters on.

808
01:40:42,467 --> 01:40:47,555
- Radiation?
- Counters 121, 141, 109.

809
01:40:47,639 --> 01:40:52,393
- Energy stabilisers?
- Energy steady at.8 megawatts.

810
01:40:52,477 --> 01:40:56,356
Tracking stations are plugged into
the control centre at Cape Canaveral.

811
01:40:56,439 --> 01:40:59,025
Fuel elements?

812
01:40:59,108 --> 01:41:02,236
Fuel elements.
Where's Chang?

813
01:41:02,904 --> 01:41:06,866
Chang, what are you doing there?
Get on the gantry.

814
01:41:09,369 --> 01:41:11,454
Hurry.

815
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:20,380
- Shut down.
- Shut down reactor.

816
01:41:28,805 --> 01:41:32,725
This is Mercury Control.
The countdown for the MV...

817
01:41:32,809 --> 01:41:35,979
Reactor shutdown,
temperature 227, falling.

818
01:41:36,062 --> 01:41:39,023
- Converters off.
- Converters off.

819
01:41:39,107 --> 01:41:42,860
- Radiation reading.
- Radiation zero.

820
01:41:43,403 --> 01:41:47,448
Shutdown procedure complete.
Reactor safe.

821
01:41:49,075 --> 01:41:51,160
Stand by.

822
01:41:53,830 --> 01:42:00,628
This is Mercury Control. The check
indicates all systems are go at this time.

823
01:42:00,712 --> 01:42:06,759
The countdown is now four minutes,
30 seconds and counting.

824
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:11,931
This is Mercury Control.

825
01:42:12,015 --> 01:42:17,228
The spacecraft pilot, the launch,
the tracking crew in case of emergency,

826
01:42:17,312 --> 01:42:21,149
and now even the weatherman,
have given us the word go.

827
01:42:21,232 --> 01:42:24,444
Remain on standby.
