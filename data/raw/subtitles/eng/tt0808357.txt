1
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Next round!

2
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Now that we've moved to
paradise, there's nothing to eat.

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
[This is a play on words,
a phrase used in mahjong]

4
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,500
Speaking of moving, I
forgot to congratulate you …

5
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:46,065
… on Mr. Liang's promotion.

6
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
Can you even call that a promotion?
He only supervises the rations.

7
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:51,365
You can't even get rice from India now.

8
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,700
Those in charge of rice are more powerful
than those who guard the treasury.

9
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:55,565
Mrs. Yee is right.

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,950
Me? I'm not a living Buddha.

11
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,265
But you should listen to me.

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,900
If he takes a consignment,
he won't be home for 3 days.

13
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,367
You'll be free then.

14
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:05,765
I don't have the time.

15
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,550
His relatives are always coming around.

16
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,992
They pack the place, even the corridors.

17
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:11,213
I'll take that. [mahjong terminology]

18
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,365
I still have to settle their meals.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,100
It's not even as though
I'm getting paid for this.

20
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,565
Yeah.

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,365
Don't mislead Mrs. Mak …

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,550
… into thinking government officials …

23
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:23,700
… are the tiles we're playing with now.

24
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:25,165
Isn't that so?

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
The Japanese would
never have thought that, …

26
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:31,600
… even the emperor gets henpecked.

27
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,065
Eat while it's hot.

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,600
I can't eat any more, I'm getting fat --

29
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:40,265
Everyone hoards up stuff now.

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,100
Since we can't do anything
else, just hoard up fat then.

31
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,317
What else is good to
stock up on, Mrs. Yee?

32
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:47,500
You know my husband is
in the import business.

33
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:48,617
I'll take that! [mahjong terminology]

34
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:50,476
Even though Hong Kong has fallen, …

35
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,265
… the ships still need to call.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,400
I'll eat that. [mahjong terminology]

37
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:56,765
Western medicine.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
The last shipment sold out very quickly.

39
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:03,000
He should get more of them.

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,665
I heard you went to Shu Yu yesterday?

41
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes, with some others. Mrs.
Mak hasn't been there before.

42
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,465
It's embarrassing that I haven't.

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,465
There're two new branches in Hong Kong.

44
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
The Sichuan and Hong Kong
chefs couldn't get along, …

45
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,500
… and besides Hong Kongers
can't take spicy food.

46
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:23,500
Isn't it spicy?

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,565
Yes, it really was.

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
9 Wan [mahjong terminology]

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,665
2 Wan.

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,700
I'll take that.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,850
Mrs. Mak didn't go yesterday?

52
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,392
She hasn't come for a few days.

53
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,865
I had things to take care at home.

54
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,700
Since you had enough players,
I decided to take a break.

55
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:49,165
An excuse to hide eh?

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,300
Who was it who said she wasn't
free a few days ago over the phone?

57
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,300
That day doesn't count,
I went to fetch Mrs. Mak.

58
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,465
You can ask her if you don't believe me.

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
I specially chose to treat you
to a meal that day, Mrs. Mak.

60
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:01,567
She did it deliberately.

61
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:04,600
I'll take that tile.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,900
Do you still have more
of those stockings?

63
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,665
Yes, but I gave them all away.

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
If you want I can bring
more the next time.

65
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:17,065
OK.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,065
Goods are running scarce in Shanghai.

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
There's even a black market
for soap and toothpaste.

68
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,865
You should come more often.

69
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
There's a place for you to stay.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,865
I think he's had enough.

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,400
The Kempeitai [Japanese Military Police]
will demand for him.

72
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,300
They didn't specify whether
he should be dead or alive.

73
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:48,865
Just give it to him.

74
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,865
How will you account to Miura?

75
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,600
They're investigating the arms the
Americans supplied to Chong Qing.

76
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:56,265
I'll meet him tonight.

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,750
His secretary called to say
today's dinner was cancelled.

78
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:03,200
He wants you to report directly
to headquarters tomorrow.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,500
You're not returning
to the office today?

80
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:21,500
I still have an appointment.

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,900
My relatives asked someone
to get some from the Russians.

82
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:23,265
Rings, jewels from the aristocracy.

83
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,700
They're begging for cigarette
butts on the streets.

84
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,165
Afraid of getting fakes.

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,900
You women started early today.

86
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,565
That's a good hand you have.

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Mr. Yee is here to show his support.

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,165
Sorry … my turn?

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,765
That's a good one you have.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
How many carats is yours, three carats?

91
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:48,765
What do you think of this? I tire of it.

92
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,200
It's no longer fashionable, I was
thinking of getting it changed.

93
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:53,465
Pin Fen has new stock.

94
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,565
There's a new five carat one.

95
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
It's large, but not as bright as yours.

96
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:01,517
Why didn't you call me then?

97
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,865
I only took a brief glance.

98
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,465
Pin Fen has some stuff that
can't be gotten outside.

99
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
They wouldn't sell that “Fire gem” to me.
[Shanghainese term for a high-grade jewel]

100
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,965
How much is it worth now?

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That fire gem of yours is ten carats.

102
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not as though it's a pigeon's egg.

103
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,465
Gems are just stones.

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,500
If you wear such large jewellery,
you can't even play mahjong.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,900
Nagging at me even though
you wouldn't buy it for me.

106
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:29,065
Ah, I won!

107
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,965
Combo win. [Mahjong terminology]

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
I was about to win myself.
It's all Mr. Yee's fault, …

109
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:34,400
… for saying you can't play
mahjong if you wear jewellery.

110
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,367
He did it on purpose.

111
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:36,265
Thank you Mr. Yee.

112
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,050
Mr. Yee should treat us to a meal.

113
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,800
Sure, where do you want to go?

114
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,465
Shu Yu. Western medicine?

115
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Not Shu Yu, let's choose
somewhere more expensive.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,765
Oh dear, I forget.

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,900
I have an appointment at three.

118
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:57,565
And I forgot all about it.

119
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,300
That won't do, who'll play then?

120
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:02,965
You should have said so earlier!

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
I need to discuss
something with someone.

122
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:07,265
And I forgot all about it --

123
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,500
Why don't you sit in for me, Mr. Yee?

124
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:10,865
I'll be right back.

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,100
And my luck had just
turned for the better.

126
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:15,465
Not today, I have something on.

127
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,100
I'll play overnight with
you ladies some other day.

128
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,565
Mrs. Mak is too inconsiderate.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,400
My husband has some money owed to
him, it's been a few years already, …

130
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,400
… the debtor finally agreed
to to pay up a portion.

131
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,565
Let's ask Mrs. Liao then.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,100
Shen-ma, could you call Mrs. Liao over?

133
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,100
You owe us a treat.

134
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,800
Mrs. Mak, Mrs. Yee says
you can use the car.

135
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,700
The car is waiting for you.

136
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:09,965
I really couldn't.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,700
Isn't Mrs. Mak going … ?

138
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,665
Ok, thank you.

139
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I'll be right down.

140
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,865
There are less cars in
Shanghai than in Hong Kong.

141
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,900
Gas is expensive. Even those who
have cars don't drive any more.

142
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Mrs. Mak, your
Shanghainese is very good.

143
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,365
My Mum is from Shanghai.

144
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,865
When I was young
some relatives of mine …

145
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,500
… moved over to Hong Kong
when the war started.

146
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:03,500
Really?

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,900
These foreigners, they can
only redeem this much a day.

148
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:34,900
They can only get hard bread to eat.

149
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,500
Do you need me to fetch you later?

150
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,500
No, I can call a cab.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Coffee, please.

152
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:48,400
Sure.

153
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,700
May I use your phone?

154
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:17,700
Of course.

155
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Strange, did I call the wrong number?

156
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,665
Hello.

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,400
Second brother, it's me.

158
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:57,400
Yes?

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
I'm at the Keseling cafe now.

160
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:02,600
Is everything alright at home?

161
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:04,565
Yes.

162
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm good, just too busy recently …

163
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:11,000
… to call back home.

164
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,250
I'm going to go shopping today.

165
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,400
I have a date, I'm going now.

166
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:19,400
OK.

167
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,100
Well, then, there's nothing else.

168
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:28,417
I know, it'll be ok.

169
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:31,700
I'm going, goodbye.

170
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
We're moving out now.

171
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,900
If you guys win we'll marry you!

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,400
I didn't say I'd be
the one marrying them.

173
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:09,465
The men have all gone to war.

174
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Who's going to marry
this truckload of girls?

175
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:15,500
I'm not going to, you marry him then!

176
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,700
I heard from teacher that
Guangzhou has been lost.

177
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:33,565
Will it be safe in Hong Kong?

178
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,300
I never thought that we'd have to
rely on the Brits to protect us.

179
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,365
Isn't your Dad in Britain?

180
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Why didn't he bring you with him?

181
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,465
He took my younger brother.

182
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,050
When my Mum died he said he'd take me.

183
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:51,600
But two years later, war broke out.

184
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:53,265
I'm not going back again.

185
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,765
War gave me the chance
to go to Hong Kong.

186
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I want to go overseas
and see the world outside.

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,700
See you by the pond after class tonight.

188
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,400
Let's go back to our apartment together.

189
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:20,865
OK.

190
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Hey, Lai Shu Jin!

191
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,765
I was just looking for you.

192
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
Kuang Yumin, you still remember me?

193
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,165
Yes, I saw you acting.

194
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,400
Lingnan University's
Women's Drama Society.

195
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,767
We've set up a new drama society.

196
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:39,601
We're auditioning for members today.

197
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:41,400
But the women's drama society has never …

198
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,265
… collaborated with males.

199
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,600
Since we're borrowing Hong Kong
University's premises for classes …

200
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:49,600
… and we have a lack of manpower,
we should work together.

201
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,765
We can do Ibsen's “The Doll House”!

202
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I know Nora's lines
at the back of my hand.

203
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:56,067
At this kind of time who has the mood … 

204
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,265
…  to see this kind of bourgeoise show?

205
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,800
We're intending to
stage a patriotic play … 

206
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,365
…  to raise funds for the war.

207
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,400
You should come for the
audition tomorrow too.

208
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,400
But I'm only a freshman,
I've never acted before.

209
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:10,565
It doesn't matter.

210
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Everyone should play their part
for the resistance movement.

211
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,600
While the soldiers are
fighting on the frontlines, … 

212
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,265
…  the Hong Kongers are relaxing.

213
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,300
We need to awaken them
from their complacency.

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,600
What a typical director,
he doesn't listen to anyone.

215
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:29,765
But since it's the resistance, … 

216
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,965
…  we girls can't lose out to the guys.

217
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,400
I just can't stand the thought
of following his beck and call.

218
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:40,065
He's quite passionate isn't he?

219
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,800
Not long after his brother
graduated from the military academy, … 

220
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,265
…  he got killed in the war.

221
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
So his family wouldn't
let him join the army.

222
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:49,500
So that's why he's so agitated.

223
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I don't want him to get drafted either.

224
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
I return myself to the
land which nurtured me.

225
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,265
And my soul --

226
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,300
More to the left, more.

227
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,300
Ok, that's fine.

228
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,200
Let's try it out.

229
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,665
What's up?

230
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,465
My Dad got married.

231
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm writing a letter
to congratulate him.

232
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The pre-stage jitters will
disappear once the curtains open.

233
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Auntie Zhao!

234
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,850
They found this officer
behind the hills.

235
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:44,000
Xiao Hong, has your brother come home?

236
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,165
Shh! Come in quickly.

237
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
My son! Quickly, go boil some water.

238
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:53,465
What happened to you?

239
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
He's an army officer, not your son.

240
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,650
My son is coming home tonight.

241
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,865
Coming home to eat dinner.

242
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,500
I should slaughter a chicken for him.

243
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:09,017
My son is coming back!

244
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:12,276
He's coming back today!

245
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:15,500
My son is coming back.

246
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,065
My son is coming back.

247
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,000
Ever since she knew my
brother died on the warfront, … 

248
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:26,665
…  my Mum took ill.

249
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,665
I made this for my brother.

250
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I just finished knitting it,
but he'll never get to wear it.

251
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,665
Please have it!

252
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,965
I can't, you saved my life.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,550
I don't have anything to repay you with.

254
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:43,065
Saving our country is payment enough!

255
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,700
Killing the enemy is taking
revenge for my brother!

256
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:49,400
I hate myself for being a woman, … 

257
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:53,400
…  and I promised my brother … 

258
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,065
…  to take care of Mum.

259
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,500
I want to set his mind at rest.

260
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:04,500
Your brother --

261
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
He was the same age as you.
Ever since my Dad died, … 

262
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,400
…  he'd been taking care of the family.

263
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:17,300
He'd work faster than everyone else.

264
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,465
Every year during the harvest, … 

265
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,500
…  he'd help others after
harvesting our own crops.

266
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
He was also as rugged as you.

267
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I'd always follow him wherever he went.

268
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,900
He'd always say Heaven would
bless the honest and kind.

269
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Our family had our hopes pinned on him.

270
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,165
I'll kowtow to you!

271
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,100
For this country,
for my dead brother, … 

272
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:56,700
…  for the generations of people, --

273
00:22:56,735 --> 00:23:03,900
China cannot fall!

274
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,400
China cannot fall!

275
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
China cannot fall!

276
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
China cannot fall!

277
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Cheers!

278
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,465
This calls for a celebration!

279
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,200
That was really great,
everyone was shouting out: …

280
00:23:31,235 --> 00:23:35,200
… “China cannot fall!”

281
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,965
“China cannot fall!”

282
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,900
600! 600 people seated in the audience.

283
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,765
And those standing in the aisle too!

284
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,600
Don't underestimate
these Hong Kongers eh?

285
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,565
When we performed at Lingnan, …

286
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,800
… we never had such an
enthusiastic response.

287
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,965
What we staged is the reality.

288
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
The audience can emphasise,
so naturally they're touched.

289
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:59,200
During the fund-raising
I saw many people tearing.

290
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,300
Cheers to everyone, for
raising this sum of money, …

291
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:07,300
… and doing our bit for the war.

292
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,100
We must drink to our
heart's content tonight.

293
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:12,700
Let's worry about the nation tomorrow.

294
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:16,700
Cheers, bro!

295
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,900
I have an idea, listen to me.

296
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:21,265
We should sell tickets.

297
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,600
And write on the door:
“While stocks last!”

298
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:25,265
If it's you, it's more like: …

299
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,900
… “It's hard to sell even one ticket”

300
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,900
Here, give me the drinks.

301
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,165
Careful!

302
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,900
Cheers to our leading man and lady!

303
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:35,767
Our ticket sales depend on her!

304
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:38,600
To our leading man and lady!

305
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm not, I'm not.

306
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
<i> We're the peach blossoms
[students] of today, </i>

307
00:24:45,635 --> 00:24:48,567
<i> The pillars of society tomorrow, </i>

308
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:51,465
<i> We're singing together today, </i>

309
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
<i> Saving the people
tomorrow on a giant wave, </i>

310
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,800
<i> A giant wave,
continuously expanding, </i>

311
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,165
<i> Classmates, my dear students, </i>

312
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,200
<i> Let your strength prop up the
rise and fall of this world, </i>

313
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,600
<i> A giant wave, a giant wave, </i>

314
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,465
Hurry!

315
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,500
To the top!

316
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Have you lighted it?

317
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,665
It won't do if peformers don't smoke.

318
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,700
Try it, it'll come in
useful during acting.

319
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,600
Wong Chia Chi took a blow,
who wants …

320
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:59,600
Gimme!

321
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Let me take a drag!

322
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,100
Thank you.

323
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:57,100
Why?

324
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,800
Wong Chia Chi.

325
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:47,800
Come up!

326
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,300
I met a fellow villager
from my hometown …

327
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:53,265
… called Tsao De Xi.

328
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,800
He went to the same school as my brother,
so we're familiar with each other.

329
00:27:56,835 --> 00:28:00,100
I heard he's an Assistant
Officer, working for the guy …

330
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:01,100
… in charge of the “Peaceful Exercise”.

331
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:02,565
His name is Yee.

332
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
He's Wang Jingwei's aide, in
charge of espionage and spying.

333
00:28:05,235 --> 00:28:06,765
He's now in Hong Kong.

334
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,900
Wang Jingwei's runs the
“Peaceful Exercise”, but …

335
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:11,765
… he's just a lackey of the Japanese.

336
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
He's a traitor who betrayed our country.

337
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:15,667
Wang is now accumulating troops.

338
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:17,900
Hong Kong is under Yee's purview.

339
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:21,900
This Tsao guy I met --

340
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,800
This is a chance.

341
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:30,465
What chance?

342
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,265
This isn't theatre.

343
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,300
No matter how much we trade on our
audience's tears and shout our voices hoarse, …

344
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:40,065
… it's incomparable to
killing a real traitor.

345
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,200
We can do it this holidays
so the school won't find out.

346
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:44,265
We need to disguise ourselves …

347
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,400
… and think of a way to
infiltrate the Yee household.

348
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,417
I'll get a favour from Old Tsao …

349
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:50,776
… and get him to introduce us.

350
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:52,065
And then we'll get guns --

351
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,400
But which of us knows
how to kill a person?

352
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,965
We've only killed people on stage.

353
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,550
When you see a traitor
in front of your eyes, …

354
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,100
… you'll know that killing
isn't difficult at all.

355
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:04,765
It's only a matter
of how many, how fast.

356
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,400
This is a matter of life and death, I
want everyone to consider it carefully.

357
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:11,917
If you're in, then let's
make this a big one.

358
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:15,276
Knives together, let's
not waste our youth, …

359
00:29:15,311 --> 00:29:18,600
… and slay one of
Wang Jingwei's lackeys!

360
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,065
I'm in!

361
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Count me in.

362
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Then we'll too …

363
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't want to force anyone.

364
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm in too.

365
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,400
'lil un, I didn't expect
you'd come find me.

366
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,700
We haven't met since
we left our hometown.

367
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:10,400
Less talk. Cheers!

368
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:14,400
Drink up.

369
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,050
I should also thank Brother Tsao.

370
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:20,500
From now on you must
take care of us.

371
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:22,067
Sure, sure, sure.

372
00:30:22,102 --> 00:30:23,565
Here's one to you!

373
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Brother, can you see
if you can help us?

374
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,665
Can you help us find work?

375
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,700
It's tough, but let
me think of something.

376
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Where's Liang Junsheng?
He's still up there.

377
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,965
What's he doing?

378
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,865
We only have enough for Tsao.

379
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,065
Maybe he can get more information.

380
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,100
Just on those few glasses of cat's piss?

381
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,800
The caucasians have all gone on holiday.

382
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:28,300
We can use the second
floor for two months.

383
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,265
Where'd you get the money from?

384
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,100
My Dad left me some money
in Hong Kong …

385
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,065
… in case of emergencies.

386
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,200
I didn't ask you to get
something so luxurious.

387
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:50,417
If you want Auyang to
be Mr. Mak, a businessman …

388
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,600
… and Wong Chia Chi to be
Mrs. Mak, a rich housewife, …

389
00:31:52,635 --> 00:31:54,917
… this is the kind of
place they should live in!

390
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:57,200
Let's decorate this place
and get some furniture.

391
00:31:57,235 --> 00:31:58,865
And get a maid.

392
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Does Mr. Mak need a moustache?

393
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,700
Hold on.

394
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,365
Don't use my best tie
to wipe your mouth with!

395
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,400
This isn't a rehearsal, there
won't be a second chance.

396
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,165
Remember your own roles.

397
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Don't say what you're
not supposed to say.

398
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,900
You too.

399
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,100
They're here!

400
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,765
Mr. Mak, Mrs. Mak.

401
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,800
This is Mr. Mak's cousin, a friend
from my hometown, Kuang Yumin.

402
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,400
This is Mr. Yee, and Mrs. Yee.

403
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
You accompany them,
I'll take my leave first.

404
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,800
Sorry about making you drive
all the way here to get me.

405
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:46,600
Old Tsao said you were
familiar with Hong Kong.

406
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:48,967
If we'd not have used
my husband's car.

407
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,265
It's no problem,
it's along the way.

408
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,065
Mrs. Yee, do you want
to visit Chung Wan?

409
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,750
Though we've been in Hong Kong
for a few months already, …

410
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,400
… the only places we know are
Chung Wan and Repulse Bay.

411
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,400
How about Tsim Sha Tsui then?

412
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:04,700
We can take a stroll there too.

413
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,965
Sure.

414
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
To Tsim Sha Tsui, Queen's Harbour.

415
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,750
Can you drop us off before
you return to the office?

416
00:34:23,785 --> 00:34:26,365
It won't matter if we
make a slight detour right?

417
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
I wouldn't want to inconvenience
Mr. Mak's official business.

418
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:32,200
It's a family business, it's all right.

419
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:36,200
What line are you in, Mr. Mak?

420
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,265
Export trading.

421
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,965
We also do importing.

422
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,865
Mrs. Yee, where you live is pretty good.

423
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,600
When we were looking for
a house, did we look here?

424
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:52,300
It's just a rental. Once war
broke out on the mainland, …

425
00:34:52,335 --> 00:34:56,300
… we moved here hastily.

426
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Mrs. Mak, were you born here?

427
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I married here, my Mum's
hometown is in Guangzhou.

428
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,265
My Mum is from Shanghai.

429
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,000
Then your Shanghainese must be good.

430
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:12,967
I can speak, but not well.

431
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:14,865
I've forgotten it all.

432
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,400
[They are speaking in Shanghainese]

433
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:17,565
My hometown is Anhui.

434
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
My Shanghainese isn't too good either.

435
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Thanks, sorry for bothering you, …

436
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:43,700
… and helping me carry my stuff.

437
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:45,365
No, I should.

438
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,000
You're welcome, since
he's my husband's cousin.

439
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,465
He also just arrived in Hong Kong.

440
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,500
We brought him along to see the sights.

441
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
What do you do in Guangzhou?

442
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,100
I teach, in an elementary
school in the village.

443
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,967
As expected, you have a scholarly air.

444
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:08,800
Either a college student or a teacher.

445
00:36:08,835 --> 00:36:12,800
Mrs. Yee, you have a good eye.

446
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,465
Didn't you see those
plainclothes bodyguards?

447
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,765
There's no way we can make a
move on him at his own place.

448
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
Whenever he goes out there're at least a few
bodyguards by his side in addition to the chaffeur.

449
00:36:20,635 --> 00:36:22,800
Even if we get him out there're at least
three people we'll have to deal with.

450
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,665
We need at least two guns.

451
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
But it's still better
than attacking him at home.

452
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,900
Be more patient, we're already on track.

453
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,500
Mrs. Yee has a good
impression of Wong Chia Chi.

454
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:37,100
She's already arranged a second meeting.

455
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:41,100
Sorry, I'm tired.

456
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Can I come in?

457
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:02,500
Come in.

458
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I pressed the tailor to hurry.

459
00:37:13,235 --> 00:37:17,200
Thank you.

460
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What does Yee look like?

461
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,100
I only got a glimpse, he
wasn't what I expected.

462
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,465
Our cook, he just left like that.

463
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,500
He didn't take anything,
but the man just disappeared.

464
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,665
So we moved to the Ban Dao hotel.

465
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,865
It's already five days, and
we don't dare to go back …

466
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,900
My husband says it isn't safe, so we
need to find somewhere else to stay.

467
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,665
You can't trust the people here.

468
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,800
These Cantonese, I can't catch
a word of what they're saying.

469
00:38:28,835 --> 00:38:31,200
Exactly, I'm quite irritated.

470
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:33,165
Where can I find a cook, …

471
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
… who can whip up some decent
Shanghainese dishes now?

472
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:37,967
I know there's a place
in Hong Kong, …

473
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,665
… which serves
decent Shanghainese food.

474
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,700
They have good fried shallot
carp and drunken chicken.

475
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:44,865
Then bring us there!

476
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,765
Hey, Old Yee, Mrs. Mak just said …

477
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
… there's a good Shanghainese
restaurant in Hong Kong.

478
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,065
Old Yee is a fussy eater.

479
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,200
He complains no matter
how good the resturant is.

480
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:55,765
Really? Which one?

481
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,465
It's the Zhu's, at Kowloon.

482
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,800
It's the main branch of the
Shanghai Restaurant in Hong Kong.

483
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:04,567
I think I've heard of it.

484
00:39:04,602 --> 00:39:07,265
I'll be back late tonight.

485
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,700
Don't remember we have guests tomorrow.

486
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:14,700
Good night.

487
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,065
We're not invited tomorrow?

488
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,565
He didn't tell me who the guest is.

489
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,200
It must be Wang Jingwei's
wife, Chen Bijun.

490
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:26,467
They're forming a new government.

491
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:28,665
They sent for Old Hsiao already.

492
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,700
That means Mr. Yee is going
to be promoted isn't he?

493
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,500
As she said … [the tile
reads “hit (on the mark)”]

494
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,650
Why're you so late?

495
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:00,142
Was playing mahjong.

496
00:40:00,177 --> 00:40:02,188
Sorry, I lost again.

497
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:04,165
What about Mr. Yee?

498
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,300
Barely saw him for a minute.

499
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:09,367
He left and didn't come back.

500
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:12,400
Hey, move aside, I'm bushed.

501
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Hey, I killed a beer bottle.

502
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:37,265
It's already been a month.

503
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,300
What's so great about shooting
one or two beer bottles?

504
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:40,565
You might as well shoot me!

505
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,500
To spare my Dad from doing the job.

506
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:44,365
The house, car,
losing at mahjong, …

507
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000
… shopping for expensive stuff,
buying a whore for you --

508
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:49,000
Are we here on holiday
or to kill a traitor?

509
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:50,165
How many Dads do you think I have?

510
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,600
Wong Chia Chi needs
expensive jewellery, …

511
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:52,965
… and you want to be
a Resistance hero --

512
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,100
What about me? I'm a chauffeur
in the day and a sentry at night.

513
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:57,465
My Dad has been asking around.

514
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,100
He thinks I've been
fooling around in Hong Kong.

515
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:02,567
He wants to break off all ties with me.

516
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:05,000
Why don't you guys think about that!

517
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,165
We have guns.

518
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,650
Why don't we kill some easy ones first?

519
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:11,100
If not school will be starting soon.

520
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,765
Everyone's here voluntarily.

521
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,700
We can't blame it all on Kuang Yumin.

522
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:16,600
I know we're in financial difficulties.

523
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:18,465
I should have planned for this.

524
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,050
I admit we don't have any experience.

525
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:21,565
But we committed ourselves to this.

526
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,400
We finally inflitrated the Yee
household after so much effort.

527
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:25,765
We can't just give up now.

528
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
The guards are now familiar with me.

529
00:41:27,335 --> 00:41:28,765
I'll find a chance to do it myself.

530
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,750
Don't worry, I'll take
care of the consequences.

531
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:32,700
Don't be dumb, you think
you can do it alone?

532
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:36,700
That's my problem.

533
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,300
My documents are in the study.

534
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,000
Mr. Yee.

535
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,665
Mrs. Mak.

536
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,700
The car broke down halfway.
And it started raining.

537
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
Send Mrs. Mak in.

538
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,400
Hong Kong's so humid. You can wring
out water even in a handshake.

539
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:22,417
Yeah, even Shanghai isn't that bad.

540
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:25,400
I'm still not used to it even now.

541
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:26,865
Mrs. Hsiao.

542
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,900
I thought you wouldn't be
coming because of the weather.

543
00:42:30,935 --> 00:42:32,765
Why are you back?

544
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,700
Rain's too heavy, I changed my plans.

545
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:37,417
Mrs. Mak, Mrs. Zhu, you're here?

546
00:42:37,452 --> 00:42:39,065
We're waiting for Mrs. Hsiao.

547
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,300
Just nice, we need one more player.

548
00:42:42,335 --> 00:42:43,765
I still have something to do.

549
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
Why don't you just play for a while?

550
00:42:45,835 --> 00:42:47,565
You haven't played for ages.

551
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Mr. Yee, Mrs. Yee's getting angry.

552
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,100
OK.

553
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
Mr. Yee liked the
material we chose that day.

554
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:13,165
He didn't like the last one.

555
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,600
Is there any tailor
you're familiar with?

556
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,017
Yes, I know of one, he's quite good.

557
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:22,400
We make our suits and dresses there.

558
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,300
Want to try making one there?

559
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:31,300
I'll leave it to you.

560
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,165
But it's the peak season now.

561
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,900
They're busy with tourists' requests.

562
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:42,665
Will it take a few months?

563
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,600
No, not that long. We're
old customers anyway.

564
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:48,600
I can hurry him.

565
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,400
When Mr. Yee is free, …

566
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,965
… Mrs. Yee can give me a call.

567
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Mrs. Mak, I have your phone number.

568
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,700
We can probably get a discount …

569
00:44:19,735 --> 00:44:21,617
… if we make one or two more.

570
00:44:21,652 --> 00:44:23,465
Mr. Yee prefers UK imports …

571
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,700
… they don't give discounts for those.

572
00:44:25,735 --> 00:44:29,700
Really?

573
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I've won!

574
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,700
Your luck today is pretty good.

575
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:56,367
I didn't even realise I'd won.

576
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,000
The God of Fortune must have come.

577
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,065
Ah, Mr. Yee.

578
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I recognised your voice.

579
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,000
It'll complement your face
more if the collar is narrower.

580
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:53,000
Yes, a smaller collar looks better.

581
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,300
Shorten the sleeves a little more.

582
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,400
I said, you should shorten the sleeves.

583
00:46:00,435 --> 00:46:02,100
It'll make you look more sprightly.

584
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:06,100
I'll leave it to you.

585
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,400
This is a more modern design.

586
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:13,400
The collar looks good.

587
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,500
Your dress is ready.

588
00:46:17,535 --> 00:46:21,500
I'll try it on.

589
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Go and eat first, don't wait for me.

590
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
Does Mrs. Mak often
make her clothes here?

591
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,865
Yes.

592
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,900
She's a frequent customer of ours.

593
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,400
It's too fitting, I
can't breathe properly.

594
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,950
Mrs. Yee originally chose this one.

595
00:47:16,985 --> 00:47:20,200
But she didn't want it so I took it.

596
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,800
I'll leave it as it is
then. I'll take it off.

597
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:30,800
Wear it.

598
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Alright.

599
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,265
Is Mrs. Yee ok?

600
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,265
Old Cao will bring her to the doctor.

601
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,300
She said she had a headache when we
were about to leave. Must be the mahjong.

602
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,665
My husband doesn't like
me to play mahjong too.

603
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,500
I said, men have many ways to
entertain themselves outside.

604
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:15,467
But for women, we can
only shop and play mahjong.

605
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:19,400
Mahjong isn't that bad,
at least we stay at home.

606
00:48:19,435 --> 00:48:22,167
When I called today …

607
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:24,900
… did I disturb you?

608
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,500
My husband isn't home,
he went to Singapore.

609
00:48:27,535 --> 00:48:29,800
So his friends came over
to accompany me …

610
00:48:29,835 --> 00:48:32,365
… in case I was bored.

611
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,000
But in fact he's getting
them to keep watch on me.

612
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:40,000
I had an excuse to
escape because you called.

613
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,800
Really?

614
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,700
I don't mind going out
alone when I'm free.

615
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,900
My husband isn't interested
in the things I like.

616
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:10,765
What do you like?

617
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
Watching movies. He doesn't
want to go so I go alone.

618
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,300
He's always talking business
with those friends of his.

619
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:20,000
They're not interested
in the movies at all.

620
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:23,065
I don't watch movies too.

621
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,100
Mr. Yee is a busy man. Only
frivolous people watch movies.

622
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:31,100
No, that's not it.
I'm afraid of the dark.

623
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,565
Will you drink some?

624
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,565
I'll drink a little with you.

625
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,600
We don't know many people in Hong Kong,
so we're always troubling you.

626
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,500
It's trivial stuff, you
don't have to stand on airs.

627
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:55,500
If you're observant, nothing is trivial.

628
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,900
There don't seem to
be many customers here.

629
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:14,900
It's because their food sucks.

630
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,400
Sorry. But it's convenient to talk here.

631
00:50:19,435 --> 00:50:23,400
No one will disturb you.

632
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Is Mr. Mak busy with his work?

633
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,300
I don't even know what he's busy about.

634
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:34,965
He went to Singapore
in the past two days.

635
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But as long as the men don't
come home, everything else's fine.

636
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Isn't it?

637
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,200
What kind of business does Mr. Mak do?

638
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:49,965
Import and export.

639
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,500
If you're so interested in Mr. Mak, …

640
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:54,965
… I'll bring him along the next time.

641
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,600
At least men have more conversation
topics among themselves.

642
00:50:57,635 --> 00:51:01,600
With women they can only
talk about trivial matters.

643
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,100
To me, a chance to
talk relaxedly like this …

644
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:10,100
… is hard to come by.

645
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,400
The people I associate with
are those with high reputations.

646
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:20,265
They talk all the time about politics.

647
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,500
The fate of generations
hang by their mouths.

648
00:51:22,535 --> 00:51:25,867
It doesn't matter what their views are.

649
00:51:25,902 --> 00:51:29,200
In all of their eyes
I see the same thing.

650
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,900
- What?

651
00:51:32,935 --> 00:51:35,765
- Fear.

652
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,800
What about you? You're
different from the rest.

653
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You're not afraid, are you?

654
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,100
What about you?

655
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,500
You're smart, but you're
not very good at mahjong.

656
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,100
Yeah, I always lose.

657
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,200
I've only won you before.

658
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,300
Your suit is ready, do you
want me to collect it for you?

659
00:52:59,335 --> 00:53:03,300
I'll call you.

660
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,465
I have an appointment later.

661
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
I still have some time, so
I'll send you home first.

662
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Is it convenient?

663
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:24,000
Yes.

664
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,765
They're here!

665
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Turn off the lights, guard the outside.

666
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,100
Thanks. I'll send you to the door.

667
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:54,500
You don't have to.

668
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:58,500
Wait for me.

669
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,465
They're coming!

670
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Turn off the lights!

671
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
They're about to come in.

672
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,700
Don't blame me if you
miss your appointment.

673
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
Too bad you have an appointment … or,
you can send the car away.

674
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Come up for some tea.

675
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,400
Give me a stiff drink.

676
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,200
He's very careful, when
we were at the tailor's …

677
00:56:06,235 --> 00:56:08,665
… he sent away Old Hsiao
and the bodyguard.

678
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,450
That means even Old Hsiao
isn't someone he trusts.

679
00:56:11,485 --> 00:56:14,165
No worries, just do the
same thing the next time …

680
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,600
… and get him into the house,
we'll get him with one bullet.

681
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:19,000
He's wary of “Mr. Mak”,
so he won't come in.

682
00:56:19,035 --> 00:56:20,565
He meets at very obscure places.

683
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Possibly Old Hsiao might
not even know of them.

684
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Is he interested …

685
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:31,000
Mr. Mak isn't pleased.

686
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,700
Not yet. But I know his intentions.

687
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,700
Otherwise he wouldn't
have sent me to the door.

688
00:56:37,735 --> 00:56:41,200
It's just that he's
too afraid to come in.

689
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:45,200
He was dallying by the entrance.

690
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,065
He said he wanted to see me again.

691
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,550
I originally thought of
meeting at the cinema.

692
00:56:52,585 --> 00:56:55,000
Since it'll be easier
to make an escape there.

693
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:57,465
But he's a really careful man.

694
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,500
He said he wouldn't go to dark places.

695
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,550
If he calls again it'll be serious.

696
00:57:06,585 --> 00:57:10,400
I'll have to agree to be his mistress.

697
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,165
And then?

698
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Have you guys thought, what next?

699
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,050
Do you know how to do it?

700
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:08,000
Between a man and a woman…?

701
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,200
You've all discussed
this before already?

702
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,300
Who?

703
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Only Liang Junsheng has experience.

704
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,100
With a whore?

705
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,500
Do you want to drink?

706
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:40,500
No need.

707
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,300
The lights.

708
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,900
You seem to be more responsive today.

709
01:02:07,935 --> 01:02:11,300
I don't want to discuss this with you.

710
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
We cooked some porridge.

711
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,800
Hello? Mrs. Mak, how are you?

712
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,600
I called you two days ago.

713
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:24,765
But you weren't in.

714
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,800
I wanted to ask if you've
tailored the clothes?

715
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,800
You're not having it done any more? Why?

716
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,900
Going back to Shanghai?

717
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,400
Well, congratulations then.

718
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:58,500
I'll go over right now.

719
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,300
You haven't called
for the past few days.

720
01:04:01,335 --> 01:04:05,300
So I thought I'd drop by.

721
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,500
I'll go to the airport tomorrow then.

722
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:19,965
I should really …

723
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,700
I should really see you off, right?

724
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:26,700
You're leaving just like that?

725
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,100
I see.

726
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,400
Give Mr. Yee my regards.

727
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,600
Bon voyage.

728
01:04:45,635 --> 01:04:49,600
Goodbye.

729
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,865
Moving house? Hope I'm not disturbing.

730
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,900
Huang, you're no longer
driving? A mover now are you?

731
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,800
What are you doing here, Cao?

732
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:08,900
To pay Mr. and Mrs. Mak a visit.

733
01:06:08,935 --> 01:06:12,900
And their cute friends.

734
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,300
What do you want?

735
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,000
Right from the start I
knew something was wrong.

736
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:24,165
I kept quiet about it …

737
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,550
… so I could see what you were up to.

738
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:30,900
So Mr. Mak is from Lingnan University.

739
01:06:30,935 --> 01:06:34,900
Cao, don't do anything reckless.

740
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,400
Mr. Yee didn't take me to Shanghai.

741
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,565
Why don't I repent my ways?

742
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,100
I know a lot more than you guys.

743
01:06:52,135 --> 01:06:53,165
Your superiors must know …

744
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,200
… that I'm more valuable than you guys.

745
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,250
How much money do you want?

746
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:04,365
I'd say at least 10 gold taels.

747
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,400
And that doesn't
include Mrs. Mak's price.

748
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm thinking Mr. Yee would
pay even more for her.

749
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,965
You're asking for it!

750
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,650
You really have it going, bro.

751
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:20,265
I didn't know you were a spy.

752
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,350
You should be the one helping me out.

753
01:07:22,385 --> 01:07:25,392
Instead why are you making use of me?

754
01:07:25,427 --> 01:07:28,400
Even though we're fellow villagers.

755
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,665
You helped a traitor!

756
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,700
You should have known
what was coming for you!

757
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,700
He's not dead yet.

758
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,650
You're back?

759
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:29,600
Morning.

760
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,300
You're back.

761
01:12:37,335 --> 01:12:39,800
Morning.

762
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,365
Aunt, I'm back.

763
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,350
Has your father written?

764
01:12:48,385 --> 01:12:52,300
I'll check the mail later.

765
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Aunt, I'm going to school.

766
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,665
You're still letting her study?

767
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,400
I sold off the house
her father left for her.

768
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:20,100
In return I agreed to let
her finish her studies.

769
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:24,100
I'm a person who keeps her word.

770
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,600
It is the time for victory!

771
01:14:35,635 --> 01:14:37,165
In the past 500 years, …

772
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,000
… having endured the
tyranny of Imperialism …

773
01:14:39,035 --> 01:14:42,465
… the whole Asia has now …

774
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,865
… broken free and achieved freedom.

775
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,900
Asia is now returning to Asians' hands!

776
01:14:48,935 --> 01:14:51,965
For every day it is not, …

777
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
… we will fight unceasingly for freedom!

778
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,050
You'd never have expected …

779
01:15:40,085 --> 01:15:42,542
… that our actions in Hong Kong …

780
01:15:42,577 --> 01:15:44,338
… were being observed secretly.

781
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,065
After you left that night, …

782
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,500
… they appeared and cleaned up the mess.

783
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:52,000
They smuggled us out of Hong Kong.

784
01:15:52,035 --> 01:15:54,965
Who's “they”?

785
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
They're from Chong Qing,
they're the ones …

786
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
… who assassinated the Shanghai mayor.

787
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,100
Now you know how childish we were.

788
01:16:10,135 --> 01:16:12,700
It was really ridiculous.

789
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:16,067
Yes, especially me.

790
01:16:16,102 --> 01:16:19,400
I was just dumb.

791
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,650
It was my fault.

792
01:16:23,685 --> 01:16:27,600
We all paid a price.

793
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,465
How's everyone?

794
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,100
They're all still around.

795
01:16:35,135 --> 01:16:39,100
Where?

796
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:43,300
A few places. It's
not convenient to say.

797
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,300
I've been looking for you.

798
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,765
I didn't go back to school.

799
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,800
I later taught language
lessons at a community centre.

800
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:04,400
It seems I have no memory
of that period of time.

801
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,465
My father wrote me a letter, …

802
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,565
… saying he couldn't afford
to send me to England.

803
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,600
He wanted me to resume my studies
and stay with my aunt in Shanghai.

804
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,765
After the Pacific War broke out, …

805
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,900
… it became very difficult
to leave Hong Kong.

806
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:23,900
I only got my permit this April.

807
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,765
These few years --

808
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,100
I feel like I don't
have much left anymore.

809
01:17:31,135 --> 01:17:33,767
That's why I wanted
to continue schooling.

810
01:17:33,802 --> 01:17:36,400
Even though I'm forced
to learn Japanese.

811
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:40,117
I'm glad you're back in school.

812
01:17:40,152 --> 01:17:43,800
I'll never be able to again.

813
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,300
Why are you looking for me?

814
01:17:50,335 --> 01:17:54,300
Just to apologise?

815
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,465
I have a task at hand.

816
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:03,500
That incident hasn't been concluded.

817
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,100
Yee is now in charge of Wang
Jingwei's spy operations.

818
01:18:09,135 --> 01:18:10,200
On the surface it's
maintaning public peace.

819
01:18:10,235 --> 01:18:12,565
But he's just a dog of the Japanese.

820
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,700
He kills judges and academics
who are anti-Japanese.

821
01:18:15,735 --> 01:18:19,565
Journalists, and our informants too.

822
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,200
Three years ago we
missed a valuable chance.

823
01:18:21,235 --> 01:18:23,665
Now it's even harder.

824
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,600
His security is tighter than before.

825
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:31,500
We don't have a chance to get him.

826
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,600
Boss, give me a little more won't you?

827
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,700
Don't mess it up.

828
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:16,395
You can call me Wu.

829
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:19,930
I believe Kuang Yumin has
already talked to you about it.

830
01:19:19,965 --> 01:19:23,930
Sit.

831
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,995
Let's get to the point.

832
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:34,195
First, and also usually last, --

833
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:38,230
Before you go on a mission
sew this into your clothes.

834
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:45,930
In case your identity is exposed --

835
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:50,295
It's only a precaution.

836
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,595
It won't be painful, but do it quickly.

837
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:56,330
Be sure to do it before they
restrain your hands. Get it?

838
01:19:56,365 --> 01:19:57,595
Is your memory good?

839
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:01,530
Remember every single word I say.

840
01:20:01,565 --> 01:20:03,595
Repeat it in your mind.

841
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,730
Don't ask questions, and don't think.

842
01:20:04,765 --> 01:20:05,995
Just remember you're Mrs. Mak.

843
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,830
You've always lived in Hong Kong,
and have no relatives in Shanghai.

844
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:11,697
This is very important,
you must know …

845
01:20:11,732 --> 01:20:14,495
… our enemies are very
careful and cunning.

846
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,530
Once you arouse his
suspicions you'll be dead.

847
01:20:16,565 --> 01:20:20,530
I have to warn you first.

848
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:25,730
I can do it.

849
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:28,795
This is your file.

850
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:30,895
Four years ago you married Mr. Mak.

851
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,930
Your marriage certificate,
and your wedding anniversary,

852
01:20:33,965 --> 01:20:35,330
You live in Luobiancheng
street in Hong Kong, …

853
01:20:35,365 --> 01:20:37,195
… and moved to Zhuangshidun street.

854
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:39,230
After Hong Kong fell, Mr. Mak's
business took a turn for the worse.

855
01:20:39,265 --> 01:20:42,930
So you had to run
errands to make ends meet.

856
01:20:42,965 --> 01:20:44,195
Your telephone numbers.

857
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:46,795
For home, and Mr. Mak's office.

858
01:20:46,830 --> 01:20:48,830
Which goods were in scarce
supply in Hong Kong last year, …

859
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:50,930
… and what you can't buy in Shanghai.

860
01:20:50,965 --> 01:20:53,295
Your bank account number.

861
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:55,080
You need to commit
all of these to memory.

862
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:56,795
You need to be able to
answer unhesitatingly.

863
01:20:56,830 --> 01:21:00,130
This is only the first
step. You need to know that …

864
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:04,130
… once you start, you can't look back.

865
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:17,595
Silk stockings, western medicine.

866
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:20,230
You need to remember the prices
of everything on the list.

867
01:21:20,265 --> 01:21:22,295
My job ends here.

868
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:26,330
The rest is up to you. Any questions?

869
01:21:26,365 --> 01:21:28,095
I wrote a letter to my father.

870
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:32,130
Could you mail it to
him after you read it?

871
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:36,630
Once you complete your task,
we'll send you to England.

872
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:43,480
You should go dress up.

873
01:21:43,515 --> 01:21:46,730
I want to see Mrs. Mak.

874
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,330
What about your part?

875
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:53,495
The car's ready.

876
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,030
The hotel room's paid up for a week.

877
01:21:55,065 --> 01:21:56,647
It's the Wang government's HQ.

878
01:21:56,682 --> 01:21:59,456
Mrs. Yee often eats there.

879
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:02,230
We'll let them meet there.

880
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:33,030
Wait for me in the study. Yes sir.

881
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,295
She's been to Shanghai
a few times already.

882
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:51,630
She stayed at East Asia
Hotel but we never knew.

883
01:22:51,665 --> 01:22:53,095
Sorry about that.

884
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,495
If Mr. Mak wasn't so busy,

885
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,095
I'd have contacted you earlier.

886
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:57,695
I said our house was just empty rooms, …

887
01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:01,130
… staying in a hotel was
just a waste of money.

888
01:23:01,165 --> 01:23:04,730
I haven't been to Hong Kong for ages.

889
01:23:04,765 --> 01:23:05,595
You're back?

890
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:08,495
Do you remember Mrs. Mak?

891
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,530
Mr. Yee, how are you?
You must have forgotten me.

892
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:13,795
I haven't.

893
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:16,680
How's Mr. Mak and his business?

894
01:23:16,715 --> 01:23:18,922
Times are tough. Thanks for asking.

895
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:21,095
Mr. Yee seems to have lost weight.

896
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:23,230
When he got his posting I
asked him to reconsider it.

897
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:26,530
It's nothing but hard
work and offending people.

898
01:23:26,565 --> 01:23:30,530
You women go ahead.

899
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:33,930
He's quite friendly isn't he?

900
01:23:33,965 --> 01:23:37,930
It's just acting.

901
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:41,830
Are we still going to East Asia today?
Aren't you sick of the food there?

902
01:23:41,865 --> 01:23:44,730
It's safer with the
Special Ops people there.

903
01:23:44,765 --> 01:23:45,795
Why?

904
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:48,095
Bombs. It's chaotic out there.

905
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:52,030
Any suspicious characters
are shot on the spot.

906
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:54,695
My siblings are in Singapore, …

907
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,930
… they told me it's
going to the dogs there.

908
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,430
They told me not to come.

909
01:23:58,465 --> 01:24:00,995
Is Hong Kong better?

910
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:04,095
It's the same, prices have doubled.

911
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:07,330
Because of the war,
the black market is flourishing.

912
01:24:07,365 --> 01:24:08,995
Oh, you don't smoke.

913
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:11,195
I brought some ciggies for you.

914
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:12,995
It's in my luggage, I almost forgot.

915
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:16,730
Thanks! You can't even get it
on the black market now.

916
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:20,730
Yes, Minister.

917
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:56,930
The room's a little
cramped, but it's safer here.

918
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:00,795
I was afraid of inconveniencing
you and Mrs. Yee.

919
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:04,830
It's her pleasure to have someone play
mahjong with her. I'm also hardly at home.

920
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:11,930
Have you been busy?
You've lost a lot of weight.

921
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:24,330
You've changed too.

922
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,930
It's been three years
and the war isn't over.

923
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,830
It's no easy feat that
we could still meet.

924
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:45,730
I brought some stuff for Mrs. Yee.

925
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:49,295
I didn't know what you like.

926
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:53,330
It's good enough that you're here.

927
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:22,530
The map of the Yees'
residence. The front is blocked.

928
01:26:22,565 --> 01:26:24,297
Everyone enters and leaves via the back.

929
01:26:24,332 --> 01:26:26,030
There're two chaffeurs, Guo and Yao.

930
01:26:26,065 --> 01:26:27,195
Guo drives Mrs. Yee.

931
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:29,195
Ah Ma and the servants
are from Yee's hometown.

932
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,230
The chaffeur never leaves the
car, not sure if he's Yee's eyes.

933
01:26:32,265 --> 01:26:35,230
All belongings have to be
searched before boarding the car.

934
01:26:35,265 --> 01:26:37,395
What about Yee?

935
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:41,095
I met him once, he's rarely at home.

936
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:45,130
When he comes home he'll go to the
study. I haven't found a chance yet.

937
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,030
He has a secretary, Zhang.

938
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:49,597
What's his full name?

939
01:26:49,632 --> 01:26:51,931
I don't know yet.

940
01:26:51,966 --> 01:26:54,230
You must be careful.

941
01:26:54,265 --> 01:26:56,695
I need money.

942
01:26:56,730 --> 01:27:00,730
Take this for the time being.

943
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:04,730
How come you haven't gotten any better
even though you play mahjong every day?

944
01:27:04,765 --> 01:27:08,730
I need to remember so many
things, I can't concentrate.

945
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:16,230
What about the rest? How are they?

946
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:20,330
They're all concerned about
you. You'll meet them eventually.

947
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:25,530
Fortunately you didn't come
to the opera with me yesterday.

948
01:27:25,565 --> 01:27:27,395
It made my head hurt.

949
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:29,295
What did they sing yesterday?

950
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:33,095
Wu Jia Po. It was terrible singing.

951
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:35,430
All the good singers
have fled to Hong Kong.

952
01:27:35,465 --> 01:27:37,730
I told Mr. Yee that if
the government of his, …

953
01:27:37,765 --> 01:27:40,095
… can't even bring in a decent opera, …

954
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:43,130
… no matter how much good they do,
the people won't acknowledge it.

955
01:27:43,165 --> 01:27:44,995
Morning.

956
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:49,030
Good morning, Mr. Yee.

957
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:52,430
The Chinese herbs you've been taking
contains turtle shell and staghorn.

958
01:27:52,465 --> 01:27:55,495
You shouldn't drink tea with it.

959
01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:59,330
His feet get cold so he can't sleep well. He's
taking it to improve his blood circulation.

960
01:27:59,365 --> 01:28:03,330
He asks me to massage
his feet in the night.

961
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:05,830
I'm having a meeting soon.

962
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,995
What're you doing today?

963
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:12,030
I'm going to Mrs. Liao's to
play mahjong with her Mum.

964
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:15,830
You're not forcing our
guest to go, are you?

965
01:28:15,865 --> 01:28:17,095
Mrs. Yee is giving me a break today.

966
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:21,130
I'm going to the movies
in the afternoon.

967
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:42,930
Mr. Yee asked me to fetch
you because it's raining.

968
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:01,530
Are we going to the cinema?

969
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:29,730
The car will be waiting for you here.

970
01:30:47,930 --> 01:30:51,930
Don't scare me like that!

971
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:48,795
My hair!

972
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:52,695
Is it so difficult?

973
01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:56,130
Do you like it this way?

974
01:31:56,165 --> 01:32:00,130
Sit down.

975
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:05,230
Sit down.

976
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:49,630
Your coat.

977
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:51,795
What brings you here Yee?

978
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:53,330
I was with a guest in the next room.

979
01:35:53,365 --> 01:35:56,847
Ah, Mr. Yee caught us shopping.

980
01:35:56,882 --> 01:36:00,606
Sit down with us since you're here.

981
01:36:00,641 --> 01:36:04,330
I'll accompany you women for a while.

982
01:36:14,130 --> 01:36:16,795
Do you understand the Suzhou dialect?

983
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:20,295
A little, I liked listening
to it when I was young.

984
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:24,330
But after we moved to Hong Kong
I didn't get to any more.

985
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:28,495
But you're back now, aren't you?

986
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:32,530
It's temporary. I'll be
going back to Hong Kong soon.

987
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:35,530
I'll be going in a few days.
If there's anything you want,

988
01:36:35,565 --> 01:36:39,530
I can bring some back for you.

989
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:04,130
CUTE DOG!

990
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:20,030
Mrs. Mak, will you be having breakfast?

991
01:37:20,065 --> 01:37:21,597
I'm not hungry, thank you.

992
01:37:21,632 --> 01:37:23,095
Where are Mr. and Mrs. Yee?

993
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:27,130
Mrs. Yee isn't awake yet. Mr. Yee has
already left for Nanjing for a meeting.

994
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:29,930
To Nanjing eh?

995
01:37:29,965 --> 01:37:31,695
Yes.

996
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,330
When will he be back?

997
01:37:33,365 --> 01:37:37,330
I don't know.

998
01:37:43,930 --> 01:37:46,595
Mrs. Liang took a fall,
I'm going to see her.

999
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:48,330
Mrs. Mak has been having a
headache for the past two days.

1000
01:37:48,365 --> 01:37:50,295
When she wakes up
give her some medicine.

1001
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:52,980
I'll be out the whole day.
Take care of the house.

1002
01:37:53,015 --> 01:37:55,630
If Mrs. Mak feels like
eating give her some porridge.

1003
01:37:55,665 --> 01:37:59,630
Got it.

1004
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:09,130
Do you believe that I hate you?

1005
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:14,930
I do.

1006
01:39:21,230 --> 01:39:24,930
It wasn't like this three years ago.

1007
01:39:24,965 --> 01:39:26,895
I hate you.

1008
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:28,795
I said I believe you.

1009
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:32,230
I haven't believed
anyone for a long time.

1010
01:39:32,265 --> 01:39:36,230
Say it once more. I'll believe you.

1011
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:39,430
Then you must be very lonely.

1012
01:39:39,465 --> 01:39:43,430
But I'm still alive.

1013
01:39:45,530 --> 01:39:48,980
You left for four days without a word.

1014
01:39:49,015 --> 01:39:52,430
Do you know I was
hating you every minute?

1015
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:57,530
Now that I'm back, do you still hate me?

1016
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:03,630
No.

1017
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:08,530
Are you still going back to Hong Kong?

1018
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:12,630
I want to go back.

1019
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:16,930
Give me an apartment.

1020
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:52,430
Brother, you can't do
something illegal like this!

1021
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:56,930
I… I didn't. Why are you here?

1022
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:59,295
I went to the teahouse to find you.

1023
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:01,830
Our branch members have
been taken into custody.

1024
01:44:01,865 --> 01:44:03,495
Some of our safe
houses have been raided.

1025
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:05,480
Fortunately Ouyang was
alert enough to escape.

1026
01:44:05,515 --> 01:44:07,430
All our lines of
communication have to be cut.

1027
01:44:07,465 --> 01:44:10,930
You can't go back to the old places.

1028
01:44:10,965 --> 01:44:14,895
Then when will we act?

1029
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:18,930
We need to wait for orders from the top.

1030
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:22,595
Can you hurry them?

1031
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:26,330
After all this, can we
all leave this place?

1032
01:44:26,365 --> 01:44:30,330
I can't say. I don't know.

1033
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,930
I haven't seen him
for the last few days.

1034
01:44:36,965 --> 01:44:40,047
Ah Ma says he went to Nanjing.

1035
01:44:40,082 --> 01:44:43,130
I don't know if that's true.

1036
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:45,995
He might have another woman.

1037
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:49,130
The previous day he brought
me to No. 1237 Xia Fei Road.

1038
01:44:49,165 --> 01:44:53,130
I know, we had people there.

1039
01:44:58,630 --> 01:45:01,195
There was perfume in the apartment.

1040
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:04,695
There was a smell of
jasmine flowers nearby.

1041
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:08,730
But it didn't seem like it
was left there on that day.

1042
01:45:08,830 --> 01:45:11,530
There was dust on the pillows.

1043
01:45:11,565 --> 01:45:13,547
I don't know.

1044
01:45:13,582 --> 01:45:15,106
Wong Chia Chi …

1045
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:16,595
I don't know …

1046
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:18,530
Wong Chia Chi, Wong Chia Chi!

1047
01:45:18,565 --> 01:45:22,530
Look at me, look at me!

1048
01:45:24,330 --> 01:45:28,330
I won't let you be harmed, understand?

1049
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:33,630
I won't let you get hurt.

1050
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:49,030
She said “I'm old already but you're still
flirting with me [lit. “eating tofu”]!”

1051
01:45:49,065 --> 01:45:53,030
I said “Old tofu is the best!”

1052
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:56,630
Since it's Mr. Yee's birthday, …

1053
01:45:56,665 --> 01:45:59,295
… she toasted him for longetivity.

1054
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:01,080
I haven't seen Mr. Yee
for the past few days.

1055
01:46:01,115 --> 01:46:02,795
He's gone to Nanjing
on official business.

1056
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:06,630
Well, even though you say
she's old she still looks good.

1057
01:46:06,665 --> 01:46:10,630
But Qianchu's is really bad.

1058
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:46,630
Close the door.

1059
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:17,930
I was waiting for you.

1060
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:23,930
You must be tired then.

1061
01:47:23,965 --> 01:47:26,395
I'm very tired.

1062
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:27,930
Mrs. Yee said you went to Nanjing.

1063
01:47:27,965 --> 01:47:29,895
Don't believe what you hear.

1064
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:33,495
I've been very busy these few days.

1065
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:35,730
We broke a resistance cell in Chong Qing.

1066
01:47:35,765 --> 01:47:38,395
And arrested ten of them.

1067
01:47:38,430 --> 01:47:41,195
They'd gone through rigorous training.

1068
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:45,030
So I had to personally
interrogate them one by one …

1069
01:47:45,065 --> 01:47:49,030
… to get anything out of them.

1070
01:47:52,030 --> 01:47:53,895
Ah, I forgot …

1071
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:57,630
… you're not interested
in my work are you?

1072
01:47:57,665 --> 01:48:00,395
It's very boring.

1073
01:48:00,430 --> 01:48:02,130
You've been very careful all this while …

1074
01:48:02,165 --> 01:48:06,130
… not to ask me about it.

1075
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:09,995
That's your business.

1076
01:48:10,030 --> 01:48:12,295
You never ask about me too.

1077
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:16,330
The only thing I can do is to
wait for you here every day.

1078
01:48:19,730 --> 01:48:21,830
Maybe you have another woman outside.

1079
01:48:21,865 --> 01:48:24,830
I can't sleep, if this continues …

1080
01:48:24,865 --> 01:48:28,830
… you'll be bored of me too.

1081
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:36,530
You've been busy thinking
of this these few days?

1082
01:48:36,565 --> 01:48:39,130
And I've been losing a lot at mahjong.

1083
01:48:39,165 --> 01:48:40,930
The hard-earned money I've made,

1084
01:48:40,965 --> 01:48:44,930
I've lost almost all of it.

1085
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,030
I should go back to bed.

1086
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:54,030
Get some rest.

1087
01:48:55,330 --> 01:48:59,330
I'll bring you to a
better place tomorrow.

1088
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:10,930
Don't come into this room again.

1089
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:26,630
Make way!

1090
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:16,395
Let's go back.

1091
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:19,930
The Minister said to wait for him.

1092
01:50:19,965 --> 01:50:23,930
It's been two hours already.

1093
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:46,830
Two people came in at the last minute.

1094
01:50:46,865 --> 01:50:50,830
Drive.

1095
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:11,930
It's very cold outside. You
could have let me wait inside.

1096
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:18,830
Wait inside?

1097
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:25,030
You want to go into that place?

1098
01:51:28,030 --> 01:51:29,630
You really want to go into where I work?

1099
01:51:29,665 --> 01:51:33,630
I know, forget it.

1100
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:36,730
Why are you looking at me like that?

1101
01:51:36,765 --> 01:51:39,895
You shouldn't be so beautiful.

1102
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:43,930
I was thinking of you today. My
secretary said I was distracted.

1103
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:47,295
He was reporting to me, …

1104
01:51:47,330 --> 01:51:50,380
… but I only saw his mouth moving.

1105
01:51:50,415 --> 01:51:53,430
Not a word went into my head.

1106
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:56,980
I can smell your fragrance.

1107
01:51:57,015 --> 01:52:00,430
I couldn't concentrate.

1108
01:52:00,465 --> 01:52:02,395
Those two people, …

1109
01:52:02,430 --> 01:52:05,495
… we arrested at the bus stop.

1110
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:09,530
They're key members
from the Chong Qing cell.

1111
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:12,180
He killed some of our people.

1112
01:52:12,215 --> 01:52:14,395
When we were arresting them, …

1113
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:17,580
… we bludgeoned one of them
till his brains spilled out.

1114
01:52:17,615 --> 01:52:20,730
And we still had to drag
him back for questioning.

1115
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:24,230
I went down with secretary Zhang.

1116
01:52:24,265 --> 01:52:26,395
One of them had already died.

1117
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:29,795
Half of his head was gone,
and his eyeballs were a pulp.

1118
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:33,330
I recognised the other one, he was
a classmate from the party school.

1119
01:52:33,365 --> 01:52:36,230
I saw his hands chained to the posts.

1120
01:52:36,265 --> 01:52:38,047
I couldn't say anything.

1121
01:52:38,082 --> 01:52:40,406
What came to my mind …

1122
01:52:40,441 --> 01:52:42,695
… was he screwing you.

1123
01:52:42,730 --> 01:52:46,530
The bastard's blood sprayed
onto my leather shoes.

1124
01:52:46,565 --> 01:52:50,330
Do you know I had to clean
them before I came out?

1125
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:47,095
He really agreed to
give you an apartment?

1126
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:50,780
I already told Mrs. Yee,
I'm moving out next weekend.

1127
01:55:50,815 --> 01:55:54,622
He was there, I don't think
he'll go back on his word.

1128
01:55:54,657 --> 01:55:58,430
That's great. That old pervert
finally let his guard down.

1129
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:01,930
Once we have a fixed location
it'll be easier to make a move.

1130
01:56:01,965 --> 01:56:03,595
There's no hurry.

1131
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:05,395
What are we waiting for?

1132
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:08,230
We need information. He broke
our source of information, …

1133
01:56:08,265 --> 01:56:10,730
… and took our advanced
American arms.

1134
01:56:10,765 --> 01:56:12,995
We suffered a great loss.

1135
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:16,330
The strange thing is, even the
Japanese are looking for these arms.

1136
01:56:16,365 --> 01:56:17,730
Wong Chia Chi is very important to us.

1137
01:56:17,765 --> 01:56:19,295
We must make full use of her.

1138
01:56:19,330 --> 01:56:21,630
But she has never
undergone proper training.

1139
01:56:21,665 --> 01:56:24,247
She can't take the long-term strain.

1140
01:56:24,282 --> 01:56:27,556
You underestimate her. Her strength …

1141
01:56:27,591 --> 01:56:30,830
… lies in her ability to play Mrs. Mak.

1142
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:32,830
It's no mean feat that
she got to this point.

1143
01:56:32,865 --> 01:56:34,395
The superiors value her greatly.

1144
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:38,430
We had two trained female comrades
who hooked him for a while, …

1145
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:42,330
… but he found them out
and killed them.

1146
01:56:42,365 --> 01:56:43,695
We even lost a namelist to them.

1147
01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:45,730
You don't understand how
dangerous her situation is.

1148
01:56:45,765 --> 01:56:48,330
She agreed to seduce Yee,
and she's done it.

1149
01:56:48,365 --> 01:56:49,695
Now is the time for action!

1150
01:56:49,730 --> 01:56:51,330
Don't tell me when to take action!

1151
01:56:51,365 --> 01:56:54,995
Listen up,
Yee killed my wife …

1152
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:57,295
… and my two kids,
but I could still …

1153
01:56:57,330 --> 01:56:59,130
… sit at the same table
and have a meal with him.

1154
01:56:59,165 --> 01:57:01,095
This is the life of a spy!

1155
01:57:01,130 --> 01:57:04,580
I would like better than
no one else to kill him now.

1156
01:57:04,615 --> 01:57:08,030
As long as he has value to us
alive, I will let him live.

1157
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:13,930
Continue baiting him,
and report back regularly.

1158
01:57:13,965 --> 01:57:17,330
Don't move without my orders.

1159
01:57:17,365 --> 01:57:18,195
Remember.

1160
01:57:18,230 --> 01:57:20,430
A resistance agent
only has one motivation …

1161
01:57:20,465 --> 01:57:21,895
… loyalty.

1162
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:25,930
Loyalty to the party, to the leaders,
to the country. Understand?

1163
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:31,930
Don't worry, I'll act accordingly.

1164
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:37,195
Good.

1165
01:57:37,230 --> 01:57:40,030
You only need to continue
luring him into the trap.

1166
01:57:40,065 --> 01:57:40,995
If there's a need,

1167
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:44,380
What do you think this trap is?

1168
01:57:44,415 --> 01:57:47,730
My body? Who do you think he is?

1169
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:51,730
He knows how to act
better than you guys.

1170
01:57:51,765 --> 01:57:55,395
He not only wants to be
inside my body, …

1171
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:59,430
… but worms his way into
my heart like a snake.

1172
01:57:59,830 --> 01:58:02,895
I'm like his slave, allowing him in.

1173
01:58:02,930 --> 01:58:05,630
I can only “loyally” wait,
playing my role, …

1174
01:58:05,665 --> 01:58:08,295
… to get into his heart.

1175
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:12,330
He'll make me bleed
and cry in agony, …

1176
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:16,095
… before he's satisfied.

1177
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:19,795
That's the only way
he can feel alive.

1178
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:23,830
In the darkness, only he
knows this is all real.

1179
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:26,430
That's enough.

1180
01:58:26,465 --> 01:58:28,195
That's why --

1181
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:30,330
That's why I can let myself
be tortured to breaking point, …

1182
01:58:30,365 --> 01:58:33,630
… and still continue, till I
can't take it any further.

1183
01:58:33,665 --> 01:58:34,995
That's enough.

1184
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:37,380
Every time after the final spasm, …

1185
01:58:37,415 --> 01:58:39,695
… I think, “will it be this time?”

1186
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:42,130
Will our people rush in
and blow his brains out?

1187
01:58:42,165 --> 01:58:44,530
And his blood and brains
will spill all over me.

1188
01:58:44,565 --> 01:58:48,530
Stop it!

1189
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:43,130
Was it Mr. Yee's plan to bring
me to the Japanese district?

1190
02:00:09,730 --> 02:00:13,730
Good evening.

1191
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:15,795
Welcome.

1192
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:17,430
I'm looking for Mr. Yee.

1193
02:00:17,465 --> 02:00:21,430
This way please.

1194
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:42,730
Pretty girl isn't she!

1195
02:00:42,765 --> 02:00:46,730
Come here.

1196
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:51,330
Lieutenant Colonel Nakamura …

1197
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:55,195
Sorry!

1198
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:59,230
Even the girls are dumping you!

1199
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:06,430
This is a customer,
not one of our girls.

1200
02:01:06,465 --> 02:01:09,430
Keiko, go accompany Colonel Nakamura.

1201
02:01:09,465 --> 02:01:13,430
Get some more sake.

1202
02:01:16,430 --> 02:01:20,430
My apologies.

1203
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:27,430
Sorry for that.

1204
02:01:38,730 --> 02:01:42,730
Your guest is here.

1205
02:01:49,630 --> 02:01:53,630
I'm punishing myself by
waiting for you this time.

1206
02:01:53,665 --> 02:01:55,295
Why here?

1207
02:01:55,330 --> 02:01:59,330
Official business.

1208
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:37,030
They sound like they're crying.

1209
02:02:38,430 --> 02:02:42,130
The Japs kill people indiscriminately, but
actually they're more afraid than anyone else.

1210
02:02:42,165 --> 02:02:44,230
They know that eventually, once they
start fighting with the Americans, …

1211
02:02:44,265 --> 02:02:48,230
… it'll be over. And all these actors …

1212
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:54,030
… are still frivolously
singing their opera.

1213
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:59,230
Just listen.

1214
02:03:21,130 --> 02:03:24,730
I know why you asked me here.

1215
02:03:24,765 --> 02:03:26,295
Why?

1216
02:03:26,330 --> 02:03:30,330
You want me to be your whore.

1217
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:33,695
Whore?

1218
02:03:33,730 --> 02:03:37,730
I brought you here to see
how good a geisha you'd make.

1219
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:52,030
I'll sing a song for you.
I sing better than them.

1220
02:03:52,230 --> 02:03:56,230
Really?

1221
02:04:58,030 --> 02:05:02,030
<i> Tears stain my sleeve, </i>

1222
02:05:03,730 --> 02:05:07,730
<i> This girl has been thinking
of him all the while till now. </i>

1223
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:02,730
Go back first, I still have work to do.

1224
02:07:02,765 --> 02:07:06,730
So late?

1225
02:07:07,930 --> 02:07:11,930
I have a favour to ask you.

1226
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:15,330
Tomorrow, bring this
letter to this address.

1227
02:07:15,365 --> 02:07:17,830
Look for a man called Hali Salahuddin.

1228
02:07:17,865 --> 02:07:20,747
Can you remember that?

1229
02:07:20,782 --> 02:07:23,595
Hali Salahuddin …

1230
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:25,295
If he says something to you, …

1231
02:07:25,330 --> 02:07:29,330
… or gives your something, tell me.

1232
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:34,030
Keep it a secret between the two of us.

1233
02:08:09,630 --> 02:08:13,630
It's a name card. Only
Yee's name is on it.

1234
02:08:17,030 --> 02:08:20,195
Put it back. What do you think?

1235
02:08:20,230 --> 02:08:22,795
I'm afraid Wong Chia
Chi is under suspicion.

1236
02:08:22,830 --> 02:08:26,830
If we send some men down to scout
the area we might fall into his trap.

1237
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:32,130
If Wong Chia Chi goes alone
it'll be dangerous too.

1238
02:08:32,165 --> 02:08:36,130
It's best that we
keep a lookout outside.

1239
02:08:39,930 --> 02:08:43,930
You should go quickly.

1240
02:08:56,530 --> 02:09:00,530
Wong Chia Chi, I'm really sorry.

1241
02:09:21,230 --> 02:09:23,730
You could have done it three years ago.

1242
02:09:23,765 --> 02:09:27,730
Why didn't you?

1243
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:29,330
Good stuff!

1244
02:13:45,830 --> 02:13:49,695
Hello, second brother? It's me.

1245
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:53,730
I'm at Keseling's cafe now.
Is everything alright at home?

1246
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:55,895
Yes.

1247
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:57,930
I'm good, just too busy recently …

1248
02:13:57,965 --> 02:14:01,895
… to call back home.

1249
02:14:01,930 --> 02:14:05,930
I'm going to go shopping today.
I have a date, I'm going now.

1250
02:14:07,130 --> 02:14:09,895
Ok.

1251
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:13,930
Well, then, there's nothing else.

1252
02:14:14,030 --> 02:14:18,030
I know, it'll be ok.

1253
02:14:19,330 --> 02:14:23,330
I'm going, goodbye.

1254
02:16:05,330 --> 02:16:06,695
You're late.

1255
02:16:06,730 --> 02:16:10,730
To Fu Kai Shen Road.

1256
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:23,980
Let's drop by the jewellery shop first.

1257
02:16:24,015 --> 02:16:26,630
It's just nearby. The
ring should be ready.

1258
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:31,830
Turn back.

1259
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:09,730
Wait here for me.

1260
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:47,030
What's wrong?

1261
02:17:47,065 --> 02:17:51,030
Nothing.

1262
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:17,880
Do you like the one I chose?

1263
02:19:17,915 --> 02:19:20,495
I'm not interested in jewels.

1264
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:24,530
I only want to see it on your finger.

1265
02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:52,630
Wear it.

1266
02:19:55,230 --> 02:19:59,230
I don't want to wear such a
valuable thing on the streets.

1267
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:07,030
You're with me.

1268
02:20:49,230 --> 02:20:53,230
Go, now.

1269
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:06,530
Open the car door!

1270
02:22:35,530 --> 02:22:37,530
Miss, get on.

1271
02:22:37,565 --> 02:22:39,495
Where to?

1272
02:22:39,530 --> 02:22:43,530
Fu Kai Shen Road.

1273
02:23:02,630 --> 02:23:06,630
Going home?

1274
02:23:07,730 --> 02:23:11,730
Yes.

1275
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:43,030
They're blocking the road again.

1276
02:23:48,530 --> 02:23:52,530
Stop, stop.

1277
02:23:54,130 --> 02:23:56,880
It can't be helped.

1278
02:23:56,915 --> 02:23:59,630
We have to wait.

1279
02:24:03,130 --> 02:24:07,130
Let me through.

1280
02:24:08,830 --> 02:24:11,295
I need to go home to cook.

1281
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:15,330
They'll let you through to
see a doctor, not to cook!

1282
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:34,730
Wong Chia Chi.

1283
02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:40,230
Come up.

1284
02:25:02,030 --> 02:25:04,395
A bunch of college
students, six of them.

1285
02:25:04,430 --> 02:25:06,995
They were part of a patriotic
drama troupe in Hong Kong.

1286
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:11,030
The woman is Wong Chia Chi, she
was in the papers in Hong Kong.

1287
02:25:11,230 --> 02:25:14,830
The leader is Kuang, we've been
tracking him for some time already.

1288
02:25:14,865 --> 02:25:18,795
Too bad we didn't get Wu, he escaped.

1289
02:25:18,830 --> 02:25:21,330
The shooter could have escaped
from the rear of the <i>Peace Theatre</i>.

1290
02:25:21,365 --> 02:25:23,730
When we checked they all
had movie tickets to fit in.

1291
02:25:23,765 --> 02:25:27,730
These students --

1292
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:31,330
You're very informed
about it aren't you?

1293
02:25:31,365 --> 02:25:35,330
Why didn't you tell me before?

1294
02:25:38,930 --> 02:25:42,930
Because of your
relationship with Miss Wong.

1295
02:25:44,330 --> 02:25:47,495
Of course, it's all clear now.

1296
02:25:47,530 --> 02:25:50,595
I left her in the interrogation room.

1297
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:54,630
Do you want to
interrogate her personally?

1298
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:58,595
She's downstairs?

1299
02:25:58,630 --> 02:26:01,480
Luo and Ban are watching her.

1300
02:26:01,515 --> 02:26:04,295
The rest have been sentenced.

1301
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:07,830
It was simple, their
confessions matched.

1302
02:26:07,865 --> 02:26:11,597
Then there's nothing left for me to ask.

1303
02:26:11,632 --> 02:26:15,330
We've gotten all there is to know right?

1304
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:21,930
How shall we settle them?

1305
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:36,230
The northern quarry.

1306
02:26:36,430 --> 02:26:40,430
News blackout, get it done by 10.

1307
02:26:59,430 --> 02:27:03,330
Your ring.

1308
02:27:03,365 --> 02:27:07,230
It's not mine.

1309
02:27:56,730 --> 02:28:00,730
Kneel down!

1310
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:06,130
It's either Hunan or Sichuan
dishes. They're too spicy!

1311
02:29:06,165 --> 02:29:09,830
If you don't eat spicy food
how are you going to win hot?

1312
02:29:39,830 --> 02:29:41,995
What happened?

1313
02:29:42,030 --> 02:29:44,630
Today evening secretary Zhang
and two guys from your department …

1314
02:29:44,665 --> 02:29:48,630
… came and took away her things.

1315
02:29:49,730 --> 02:29:53,730
And some things from the study.

1316
02:29:56,330 --> 02:29:59,695
Keep a lid on it.

1317
02:29:59,730 --> 02:30:03,730
If anyone asks, say Mrs. Mak went
back to Hong Kong on urgent business.

1318
02:30:08,330 --> 02:30:12,330
What happened?

1319
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:19,230
Go down first.

1320
02:30:19,265 --> 02:30:22,230
Continue playing.
