00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:07,871
Pension service please.

00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:11,245
Thank you, Mr. Moses.
Please hold for your representative.

4
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,273
Hi, this is Sarah.

5
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:31,695
It's Frank Moses.

6
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:35,202
Hey, Frank. Whats going on?

7
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,604
Not much.

8
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:42,300
I just called because
they didn't send that check out again.

9
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,313
Aw, I can't believe they haven't worked
this out by now.

10
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:48,963
I'll make sure they send another one
out today.

11
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:52,844
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, What are you going to do?

12
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:57,361
So how is your avocado?

13
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,967
It's got two green leaves on it.

14
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:03,265
Yipee, I told you, you could grow something.

15
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:06,851
Well, it was pretty close, it
was life or death.

16
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:09,060
I'm not kidding.

17
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,186
It could have gone either way.

18
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:12,872
How is your day going?

19
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:16,309
My day, my day sucks.

20
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:19,263
- Your day sucks?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:23,805
Right now I just want to travel
you know ...

22
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,860
I'm thinking Chile.

23
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,977
Sounds like an adventure, I don't know.

24
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:30,247
You ever been to Chile?

25
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:31,725
Yeah.

26
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,863
You have? Well what's it like?

27
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:35,834
Mountains.

28
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,482
That's it?

29
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,927
Well, it was night, I...I ...

30
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,028
It was uh...

31
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:43,828
Look, I gotta go.

32
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:46,602
- I'm, uh, I, okay I...
- I'm Sorry, I just gotta.

33
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,024
What?

34
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:54,367
It was night?

35
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,943
Hi, Mr. Moses.

36
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,546
- You start that new book?
- I did.

37
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,352
And, what's it called?

38
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:33,291
Uh, it's called, "Loves savage secret."

39
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,030
Oh, my God!

40
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:36,866
Is it any good?

41
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:40,185
It's terrible, I love it.
It's awful,

42
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:47,032
It's about this, this fashion designer and
his, his super model girlfriend,

43
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:49,542
And they get recruited by the CIA

44
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:52,435
to stop an assassination at the Milan, spring shows.

45
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,435
Well...

46
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:58,257
- Who doesn't like Milan in the spring?
- I guess.

47
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:01,296
Anyway, I gotta do something
for excitement.

48
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,440
My landlady keeps trying to
set me up with

49
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,337
her bridge partners
kid.

50
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:08,755
- She just told me she thinks I'm gay.
- I try not to judge.

51
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:10,632
Well, shut up!

52
00:06:10,915 --> 00:06:13,050
I'm not gay.

53
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,438
So here's something weird ...

54
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:20,928
I'm actually going to be in Kansas City
next week.

55
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:24,365
- In person?
-Mm hmm

56
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,383
Wow

57
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,775
That could be a bad idea.

58
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:30,900
It could be...

59
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:39,135
- You still there?
- Yeah...yeah.

60
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:45,769
Why don't you call me when
you get to town?

61
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,862
Er... yeah.

62
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,615
Okay.

63
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:51,873
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

64
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:59,797
-Okay.
-All Right.

65
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,196
<i>Come in, Unit 1.</i>

66
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:46,819
<i>Come in, Unit 1.</i>

67
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:51,944
<i>Unit 1, respond.</i>

68
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,331
Hey, aren't you going to invite me in?

69
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,440
No, I don't think so.

70
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,292
But I brought you dinner.

71
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,810
Wow, wow.

72
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:43,851
And you live with your mother ...
Awesome!

73
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:50,382
Of course, you have no job.

74
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:55,320
Years ....,
and me all this.

75
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,264
Hey.

76
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:12,080
It's me, Frank.

77
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,077
The avocado.

78
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,333
Why are you here?
Get out of my house!

79
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,052
-I told you to call first!
-Hey!

80
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:24,876
I'm not going to hurt you.
Would you just listen to me?

81
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:27,637
-Please. stop that!
-Get out, go away, stay away.

82
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,391
Is that my bag?

83
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,264
Yeah.

84
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:35,876
- You,  you packed it?
- Yes.

85
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:38,608
Did, did you vacuum?

86
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:40,522
A little yeah, it was messy.

87
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:43,265
- Get back! Get out, get out.
- Please,  you have to leave right now ...

88
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,407
- Ahh, Help!
-Listen to me.

89
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,145
Someone Is trying to kill me.

90
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:49,881
- Ahh, help!
- Stop that, stop that!

91
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:51,817
- Help!
- They may be trying to kill you, too.

92
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:55,214
Why would anyone want to kill me?

93
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:57,817
Because we've been under servalance.
They've been listening to our
conversations.

94
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:58,800
Why?

95
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,811
Because of the way
I talk to you.

96
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:04,961
What?

97
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,681
They know I like you.

98
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,885
Listen to me ...
right now, back door.

99
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,550
No way, no!

100
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:24,214
Don't get me wrong I know it's crazy.

101
00:13:24,214 --> 00:13:30,600
Don't think that I don't think
this is, this is crazy. And it...

102
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:38,836
...couldn't be more different than how
I had hoped to meet you for the first time.

103
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:41,307
But you know, sometimes
things happen

104
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:44,926
And I just hope that one day you
and I could be ...

105
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:50,779
... sitting somewhere
comfortably and...

106
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,321
...look back on this as the

107
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:55,565
the great big adventure that it is.

108
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,327
I'm a little hungry too.

109
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,141
What should we get?

110
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,520
Pizza

111
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,308
Listen honey.

112
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:26,412
Yeah, lots of boys get blammed
at school.

113
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:34,852
I know, but you just, you can't solve it
by interviening like that.

114
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:38,260
No, I don't agree with you.

115
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,215
I know, I know it's hard...

116
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:51,063
I'll, I'll talk to him about it when I
get home.

117
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,300
No, I should be on time tonight.

118
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,377
No 2%? Okay.

119
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,126
Love you. Bye.

120
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,983
Listen, I can make you rich.

121
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,673
Don't you know who I am?

122
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:11,230
Of course I do.

123
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:44,655
This is off the books,
total blackout.

124
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:46,242
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,561
Here's your target.

126
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:56,534
Target analyzed, CIA?

127
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:59,844
Is that a problem?

128
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:03,332
No.

129
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:25,996
Sorry ...

130
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:30,283
If you, if you let me go,

131
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:31,956
I won't press charges.

132
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,584
- There's no hard feelings
- There will be pressed charges.

133
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,820
Why do I always attract loosers
like you?

134
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,786
- I was in the CIA.
- Yeah I bet you were!

135
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:43,191
I bet you're a spy.

136
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,134
I have to go see someone now.

137
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:48,291
You're just going to
make me sit here?

138
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,390
You couldn't be safer.

139
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:50,956
No one knows where you are.

140
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:54,703
- Oh no you don't, don't do it.
- Just hold still.

141
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,727
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

142
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:01,700
Your eyes are so beautiful!

143
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,637
Want to watch TV?

144
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,519
Be back soon.

145
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:21,239
Is that thing acting up again?

146
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,304
- Oh hi, Marna. Yeah ...I

147
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:29,459
Give it a whack will ya?
See if you can get it going for me.

148
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,746
Oh, of course.

149
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:34,531
I don't know why you don't
fix this old thing.

150
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,404
Get a better picture.

151
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,184
Try it a little bit more to the left.

152
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,204
Okay.

153
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,896
Yeah...

154
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,749
That's just perfect.

155
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:52,051
Thank you very much, Marna.

156
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:00,812
Unbelievable.

157
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:06,678
Should be serious.

158
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,999
It's nice to see you, kid.

159
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,675
It's good to see you too.

160
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,042
So, What's up?

161
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:26,011
-I met a girl.
-No...

162
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,577
Complicated.

163
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:37,143
A visit from a wet team. At
my house, 24 hours ago.

164
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:40,130
Did you ID any?

165
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:42,352
Kinda.

166
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,177
This used to be a gentleman's game.

167
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,938
And you know I love you, bye.

168
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:24,151

Stephanie Chan. You know her?

171
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:31,766
No.

172
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:37,414
Somebody has a serious hard on
for you, kid.

173
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:38,818
Yeah.

174
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,727
Why now?

175
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:42,539
I'm retired.

176
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:46,380
We'll just have to dig some more.

177
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,844
Watch your back too.

178
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:53,416
I'm 80 years.
I've got stage IV liver cancer.

179
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,955
- What the hell can they do to me?
- They can still shoot you.

180
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:04,771
I never thought this would
happen to me.

181
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,751
What?

182
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:09,459
Heck no...

183
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:14,971
I mean, Vietnam, Afghanistan ...

184
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:21,314
Greens springs rest home

185
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,575
Go figure.

186
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:40,861
So Moses made 22 calls to Pension services,

187
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,878
and that didn't stand out to you?

188
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:46,519
Unbelievable.

189
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,353
Boo...ha...

190
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:07,095
Have Vandercat intercept the
girl at the Hotel Capri.

191
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:08,857
Mike, change of plans.

192
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,796
She's just fine.

193
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:19,717
I can take you home.

194
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,233
I gotta take you down to the
station first to get your statement.

195
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,861
And then there's a couple of federal
guy's who's gonna want to talk to you.

196
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,442
I gotta say, I think it's pretty amazing
for uh, breaking free

197
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:31,748
And keeping it together like you did.

198
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,315
Impressive.

199
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:37,596
-Um, I'm going to go back and get my bag.
- Well I can have someone bring it back for you.

200
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:38,726
- No, it's okay.
- Get in car!

201
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:39,758
OW!

202
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,468
Let me go, you're hurting me.

203
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:45,064
AHHHHHHHH!!

204
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:50,378
Am I going to die?

205
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:51,251
No.

206
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,479
You just need some sleep.

207
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,919
I may vomit.

208
00:21:56,051 --> 00:22:00,000
Aww, that is just like "Loves
savage secret."

209
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:10,317
I am...hhhigh.

210
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,846
You have so beautiful green eyes.

211
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:38,967
Wow.

212
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,292
You reallly are CIA!

213
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:50,390
Officer down, going north
Peters and Conclese.

214
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,606
Suspect is a white male,
30, black suit and tie, driving a black top.

215
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,988
Put  your weapon
on the ground!

216
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:41,800
Put your weapon on the ground,
....Now!

217
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,092
Get down, down right now!

218
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,828
So you were saying this was CIA sanctioned?

219
00:23:52,427 --> 00:23:55,160
All right Tom, thanks I
owe you one. Bye.

220
00:24:10,703 --> 00:24:12,705
So it's like that, huh?

221
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:16,096
Yeah, it's like that.

222
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:28,768
Where are we?

223
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:34,854
Ho..How did we get to New York city?

224
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:40,909
Wow, I really hate you right now.

225
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:44,006
I..I was just hoping that you'd be a
little more understanding of the situation.

226
00:24:44,006 --> 00:24:46,647
I was hoping not to get kidnapped.

227
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,232
Or drugged.

228
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:50,255
I was hoping you'd have hair.

229
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:54,190
So looks like none of our
dreams are coming true. At the moment.

230
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,415
I'm sorry about that.

231
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:59,337
Thank's for saving me.

232
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,224
I guess.

233
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,943
No problem.

234
00:25:04,277 --> 00:25:07,691
Not my best first date.

235
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:12,133
Not my worst, either.

236
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:19,276
'Till we find out who's trying to kill
us you're going to have to stay with me.

237
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:22,779
- For how long?
- I don't know.

238
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,343
Whoever's trying to kill us

239
00:25:24,343 --> 00:25:26,783
Also killed a New York Times
reporter.

240
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,112
She's still in Chinatown.

241
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:41,680
Let's get in here.

242
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,302
- Just hang on to this tape.
- Oh no...

243
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:50,201
- No, you said we were just going to talk to her.
- I know, this will help.

244
00:25:50,201 --> 00:25:52,368
- The woman just lost her daughter.
- I know.

245
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:54,919
You can't just go around duct
taping everyone.

246
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,555
People are basically kinda decent.

247
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,480
That has always been my exprience.

248
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,789
Let me try to talk to her.

249
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:09,827
- What?
- Just let me, let me do it.

250
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:17,987
They told me to be patient. The police
have done nothing.

251
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:21,058
They said it was
just a burglery but,

252
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,563
but nothing was missing.

253
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:25,547
She was scared.

254
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:30,051
We're hoping we can do more.

255
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:32,729
You worked with my Stephanie?

256
00:26:41,244 --> 00:26:43,349
She sent me this.

257
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,851
I got it in the mail on
the day she died.

258
00:26:53,758 --> 00:26:56,689
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

259
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:59,513
I tried dialing the numbers.

260
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:01,918
The Police have no idea.

261
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:05,009
Where did Stephanie go to college?

262
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,874
Why are we here again?

263
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:13,330
Those numbers on Stephenie Chan's post
card are acutally a call letters for a book.

264
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,048
Call numbers starts with letters.

265
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:17,146
At the Library of Congress, yeah.

266
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:21,564
At Harvard-Yenching, it's a classification
for Asian literature.

267
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:23,334
How could you possibly know that?

268
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:30,143
You speak Chinese?

269
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,649
Unbelievable!

270
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,584
It's a hit list.

271
00:27:57,584 --> 00:28:00,731
Hank Maestriano died two weeks ago
Car crash.

272
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:06,014
Daniel McGinty, heart attack.
last week ...

273
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:10,736
... But, if this is a hit list,
why is this guy still alive?

274
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,357
Gabriel Singer.

275
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,514
Flies cargo planes.

276
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,455
That's a good question.

277
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:31,911
Helluva mess!

278
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,079
Come on ...

279
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,514
Joe Matheson, please.

280
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:47,970
Hold on.

281
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,056
Marna.

282
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,768
Hello?

283
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,621
What?

284
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:28,447
Joe ...

285
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:30,764
<i>CIA headquarters,
Langley, Virginia</i>

286
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:35,591
Sir..SIR!

287
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:39,516
Frank Moses was never a target analyst
He's never worked in the field.

288
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,844
This guy has a history.

289
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:06,288
That's a file number.

290
00:30:06,536 --> 00:30:09,307
You need to visit the back room.

291
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,461
You're going to meet the records keeper.

292
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:22,155
I didn't even know this place existed.

293
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:23,914
It doesn't.

294
00:30:33,382 --> 00:30:34,755
Ahh.

295
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:40,232
Frank Moses file.

296
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,633
You gotta be kidding me.

297
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,938
Frank Moses was one of the most effective
black ops agent we've ever had.

298
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:02,240
He retired drug lords, terrorists,
hell he  ...

299
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:05,302
toppled governments.

300
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,589
He was truly gifted.

301
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:13,994
- Why was he retired?
- He got old.

302
00:31:14,244 --> 00:31:17,910
Then some thumb sucker came along
and tagged him RED.

303
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,846
- RED?
- Yeah RED, you know R..E..D, Retired, extremely
dangerous.

304
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:25,105
Yeah...

305
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:28,756
They don't make them like that anymore.

306
00:31:30,643 --> 00:31:31,791
Thanks.

307
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,270
I'm going to need a data haunt.

308
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,995
Every flake he's ever been involved in, every
agent he's ever won.

309
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,244
I want NSA telephone surveillance
voice recognition the whole godamn ...

310
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,980
We have to find Marvin Boggs.
His name is on the list too.

311
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,815
Marvin died two years
ago, in a fire.

312
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:53,479
Marvin has died many times.

313
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,247
Oh, can we have that one?

314
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,458
Wow, all we need is a banjo.

315
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,247
Shhh, shhh.

316
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,872
Keep your voice down.

317
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,261
Don't make any sudden moves.

318
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:36,884
Stay close to me, don't use
your cell phone.

319
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:40,702
- You took my cell phone.
- No cell phones Don't talk
about satellites.

320
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:42,050
Seriously?

321
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:46,763
Why are you trying to kill me?

322
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:48,076
-I'm not trying to kill you.
-Oh, yeah.

323
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,438
You are.

324
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:50,954
Why would I try to kill you?

325
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:53,440
Because the last time we met,
I tried to kill you.

326
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,953
- That was a long time ago.
- Some people hold on to things like that.

327
00:32:58,032 --> 00:33:02,564
I'm not trying to kill you. Okay?

328
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,539
So that makes
us friends, right?

329
00:33:08,582 --> 00:33:10,624
-Right...
-Good.

330
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:15,883
Want to take that knife out of
my balls now?

331
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,349
- Who is she?
- Sarah.

332
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:24,479
-She's not trying to kill you either.
-Yeah...hi.

333
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:28,199
I dont' stay in the open.

334
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:32,832
Come on, I'll show you the house.

335
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:35,606
What's that?

336
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,824
Decoy.

337
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,401
He lives in a car?

338
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,402
Come on in.

339
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,266
Why do you live here, when you
have the other place?

340
00:34:03,923 --> 00:34:09,467
So, put it this way, when the helicopter passed
over the house last year.

341
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:16,082
And I can feel their eyes on me,
wet the peaches.

342
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,739
I have a list here...

343
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,573
It was written by a hearald reporter
who is now dead

344
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:26,534
Along with everyones who's name
is on that list.

345
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:28,422
Well, almost everyone.

346
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,616
Frank, Frank how many times
have I told you?

347
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,930
You cannot trust
the system.

348
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,223
I told you when you're in the system,
they switch the flip...

349
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:39,931
and you're done.

350
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:43,027
Manned Satellites, Cell phones,

351
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:46,411
Chips, net, the web ...

352
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:48,649
- The Dentist ...
- Marvin.

353
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:54,481
That list is what we need help with.

354
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:57,031
I gotta check the Fonz.

355
00:34:56,993 --> 00:34:59,089
'Course you gotta, Thanks.

356
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,620
Wow.

357
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,949
This guy is insane.

358
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,931
Well...

359
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:14,408
He thought he was the subject of secret
government mind control project.

360
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:16,707
- This will take a minute.
- Sure.

361
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:19,307
As it turns out

362
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:24,079
He really was given daily
doses of LSD, for 11 years.

363
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,112
Well, in that case he looks great.

364
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:27,869
- Fantastic.
- Yeah ...

365
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:31,973
Got it, Guatemala, Fall 1981.

366
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:37,308
Five of the guys on this list were
there, not including us.

367
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:40,174
Uh, San Benito, just outside.

368
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:41,925
Huge attack target.

369
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:45,202
It was a little village ...
Uh, Everybody was killed civilians and ----.

370
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:49,430
Go in there, clean it up and make it look
like it never happened.

371
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,246
You think everyone on this list was there?

372
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,116
Damn it, damn it!

373
00:35:56,428 --> 00:36:00,180
Do  you know what's wrong with this country?

374
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,685
They're all trying to kill us?

375
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:04,158
Exactly.

376
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:07,406
Is there anybody still alive
on that list?

377
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,956
Gabriel Singer.

378
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:11,527
Frank ...

379
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:14,155
I never thought I'd say this.

380
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,218
I am getting the pig!

381
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:26,049
Who's she talking to?

382
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:28,794
Just take it easy.

383
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,815
Frank, we got to get rid of this broad.

384
00:36:30,816 --> 00:36:33,985
I know a great place just up
the road. Lots of alligators.

385
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:38,387
We're not getting rid of the broad.
I like her, okay?

386
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:41,053
Wha... wait, what's the angle?

387
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:44,175
No angle, I like her.

388
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:46,034
Okay, so...

389
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:50,178
They pull her voice from the pay phone,
Probably right now.

390
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:53,746
Install the recognition software and backtrace
it to same so then we saw.

391
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:59,347
They bring out the sattelite and we're
fried with wire trace.

392
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:04,937
- How are you doing?
- Good, fine.

393
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:15,177
N974 ...

394
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:18,784
Wow, Singer is going to be in Mobile
tomorrow,

395
00:37:18,785 --> 00:37:20,810
but we can catch him at
the air frieght terminal.

396
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:22,833
How about that?

397
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:50,248
Oh my God!
Please don't...

398
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,985
No, please!

399
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:54,589
You smell like Washington.
Who do you work for?

400
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,711
Coldwell Banker I'm a
real estate agent.

401
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:59,296
- Just take the money, Please, please don't hurt me.
- Who do you work for?

402
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:00,235
What?

403
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:02,101
- Who do you work for?
- Marvin, whoa what are you...

404
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:03,618
Frank, she's one of them.

405
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,938
She's been following us, there's a camera
in her bag.

406
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:08,987
- I'm going to kill her now.
-Wait a second.

407
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,690
Don't kill me, Don't let him
kill me, please.

408
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,378
Marvin, just wait would you please!

409
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,351
Marvin, look Marvin!

410
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:20,226
No camera in the bag.

411
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:22,805
Go ma'am, now.

412
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:31,730
Get a car, try
not to kill anyone.

413
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:36,452
She was following us, Frank.

414
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,820
This is great.

415
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:56,260
She has a camera in her purse
we have to kill her?

416
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,046
Seriously?

417
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,410
See you in a minute.

418
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,350
Gabriel, right....

419
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,116
Gabriel Singer.

420
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,320
What's this about?

421
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,727
Guatemala.

422
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:20,122
1981, San Benito.

423
00:39:20,122 --> 00:39:21,824
I can't talk to you.

424
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:29,037
Pair beats ace.

425
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,600
I got one for you.

426
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,691
What did this twice decorated west Texas Jew
boy marine pilot...

427
00:39:35,692 --> 00:39:37,830
say to the Chinese New York times reporter?

428
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:39,362
I give up.

429
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:42,326
Nothing, I didn't tell her a damn thing.

430
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:44,229
The reporters dead now.

431
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:47,856
And everyone's she's spoke to is
either dead or a target.

432
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:49,766
And that includes you.

433
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,452
Oh Christ!

434
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:58,086
They had me fly this guy out there
in the dead of night.

435
00:39:58,086 --> 00:40:00,891
Arial air strip in the middle of no where.

436
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:04,393
He was CIA, some dorky little
spook in a suit and tie.

437
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:06,705
- I remember that guy,
- Black glasses ...

438
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,370
Yeah, he was giving me orders.

439
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,334
He picked up a package and I flew
him back out.

440
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:10,999
What was the package?

441
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,592
It wasn't a what, it was a "who."

442
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,050
Frank...Frank, FRANK!

443
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,272
It's that helicopter.

444
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:21,300
We're into a airport...so

445
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,275
It's the same helicopter.

446
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:32,285
November Niner 748 Charlie.

447
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:37,014
See Frank. November Niner 748 ...

448
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,594
-Is that a four?
- This is four...Charlie

449
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:42,025
-Is that a seven?
-Yeah, that's a four

450
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,831
- What makes you think ...

451
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:56,072
I told you she shouldn't have made
that phone call!

452
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,787
- I spotted the target.
- All right, shake the tree.

453
00:40:59,787 --> 00:41:02,336
- You'll pay for the breakage?
- Yeah, roger that.

454
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,753
That's right old man!

455
00:41:27,627 --> 00:41:28,829
Old man?

456
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:32,109
- No respect!
- Can I kill her now?

457
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,738
She called me an old man.

458
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:48,501
Open the pig!

459
00:41:54,309 --> 00:41:55,545
Okay, head down.

460
00:42:04,997 --> 00:42:06,874
Damn satellites!

461
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,214
Grenade!

462
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,046
Poop to that!

463
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,225
You just stay right there.
This is going to be good.

464
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:43,050
Come on, you all right?

465
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:46,513
What are you doing?

466
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,094
Old man my ass.

467
00:43:25,094 --> 00:43:26,921
God damn it!

468
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:29,816
- Sloping Thermals.
- Obstructed view, signals fading

469
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:35,224
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

470
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:37,305
We should get out of here.

471
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:58,695
You really know how to show a girl
a good time, Frank.

472
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:00,641
I will kill you, Marvin.

473
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,948
Take it from me, she likes you.

474
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:14,240
How can you tell?

475
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:18,234
Notice how she sticks around?

476
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:21,994
Because if a woman don't like you,
they don't stick around.

477
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:24,383
She doesn't really have much of a choice,
does she?

478
00:44:24,383 --> 00:44:26,248
Sure she does.

479
00:44:26,994 --> 00:44:28,452
Really?

480
00:44:29,296 --> 00:44:31,184
You think so?

481
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,572
You know, if it is the CIA,

482
00:44:40,572 --> 00:44:45,392
Then there is only one place that we can
go to find out why they're coming after us.

483
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:46,640
Yep.

484
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,707
We're gong to get killed there
for sure.

485
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:51,138
In or out?

486
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:54,564
No, of course I'm in, it's just
I'm..saying.

487
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:58,840
We're going to need some serious help.

488
00:45:02,802 --> 00:45:06,490
This is not the kind of help
I meant, Frank.

489
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,790
You're honestly not going
in there, are you?

490
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:15,267
I don't think I can go, Frank.

491
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:22,106
The last time they put some electrical wires
in some not very nice places.

492
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:28,707
Hang on to that for me.

493
00:45:32,514 --> 00:45:34,209
I'll be right back.

494
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,069
Hey.

495
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:46,651
Be careful.

496
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,025
Tell Ivan Simanov that
Frank Moses...Frank Moses..Frank Mosss..

497
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:18,540
Frank Moses...
is here to see...is here to see him

498
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:35,986
I have to say

499
00:46:35,986 --> 00:46:44,007
This is the last thing that I expected when
I got up this morning.

500
00:46:48,218 --> 00:46:53,127
And I have many times dreamed
of killing you.

501
00:46:53,633 --> 00:46:55,603
But now ...

502
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:03,804
You are,
..Retired..

503
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:07,631
Couple of years now.

504
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:09,510
Time passes.

505
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:14,357
As we get older, things seem
less important.

506
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:16,479
Still ...

507
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:23,041
I owe you for killing, Igor.

508
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,436
Igor the Butcher?

509
00:47:24,436 --> 00:47:26,369
- It was a great asset.
- He was a pig.

510
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:28,994
He was my cousin.

511
00:47:29,355 --> 00:47:30,980
I'm sorry.

512
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:42,518
To Igor.

513
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,565
The Butcher.

514
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,689
He's not dead.

515
00:47:50,378 --> 00:47:52,959
I flipped him.

516
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:53,956
No ...

517
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,696
He owns a string of seven-eleven's
in Orange County.

518
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:58,317
- Asshole!
- He weighs 500 pounds.

519
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:13,269
Drink.

520
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,675
Who are we drinking to now?

521
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:19,492
Veronique.

522
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:23,779
She was mine.

523
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:27,029
- Impossible.
- Yes.

524
00:48:33,558 --> 00:48:36,763
Whatever she got, it was worth it.

525
00:48:39,938 --> 00:48:43,215
I miss the old days.

526
00:48:45,197 --> 00:48:50,776
I haven't killed anyone, in years.

527
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:53,012
That's sad.

528
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:58,290
But,

529
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:04,191
I think you are not here for
the vodka.

530
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:10,961
I'm going to break into the CIA.

531
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:14,168
I need your complete security
layout of Langley.

532
00:49:14,168 --> 00:49:18,088
Cracks, Codes, ID swipes ...

533
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,756
All of it.

534
00:49:21,323 --> 00:49:25,425
Amusing as this would be,

535
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:28,660
it is beyond my reach.

536
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:39,389
A favor from Frank Moses ...

537
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:52,472
I can't believe you're actually
letting me come along.

538
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:55,688
The badges Ivan gave us are
for a General Harlow,

539
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:59,243
and a female nuclear physicist
from Los Almos.

540
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,422
Shanique Johnson?

541
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:05,588
You're adopted.

542
00:50:05,975 --> 00:50:07,040
Okay.

543
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,142
This is so, cool!

544
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:30,834
<i>Please initiate scan.</i>

545
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,364
What?

546
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:35,152
Ut oh, I..I dropped it.

547
00:50:35,777 --> 00:50:37,126
Oh, I'll find it.

548
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,900
Freeze!

549
00:50:42,388 --> 00:50:46,314
The General has dropped his contact lens.

550
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:49,981
Perhaps you'd like to help us.

551
00:50:51,065 --> 00:50:52,342
All right.

552
00:50:58,736 --> 00:51:01,465
Found it! I found it!

553
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,134
Have a good day, sir.

554
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:20,446
Gentlemen.

555
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:23,533
Oh my God!

556
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:29,385
What do you suppose the, the punishment
is for what we're doing here?

557
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:31,345
Death.

558
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,798
Maybe life in prison.

559
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:35,595
Awesome!

560
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:43,912
Why are you holding that button?

561
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,758
The Russians give you the code?

562
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:56,769
No.

563
00:51:57,927 --> 00:52:00,492
It changes every six hours.

564
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,553
-Here, hold this for a sec.
-Yeah

565
00:52:06,268 --> 00:52:08,644
It's impregnable.

566
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:11,507
Wow

567
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:17,063
Come on.

568
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,126
Mr. Moses.

569
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:36,001
It's been a long time.

570
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:38,598
I'm going to need to see that,
Guatemala file.

571
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:41,462
- Guatemala?
- Yes.

572
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,442
I think I can help you.

573
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:46,898
Right.

574
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:54,751
You know, there's been a whole
new world around here since you left.

575
00:52:55,753 --> 00:52:57,548
Guatemala.

576
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:05,122
- You know you're going to catch hell for this.
- After what I've seen?

577
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,886
Oh, I should tell you ...

578
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:12,234
Theres a new guy that came down here yesterday,
looking for your file.

579
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:15,621
Name of, uh, William Cooper.

580
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:18,861
Six one, cute hair?

581
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:21,364
Hmm, it was cute.

582
00:53:21,585 --> 00:53:24,547
But I thought he looked a little tough, though.

583
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:29,007
You take good care of yourself, Henry.

584
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,116
You too, Mr. Moses.

585
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:35,219
Change of plan.

586
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:54,450
Bad move, grandpa.

587
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,095
He looks  completely different
in his profile pictures ...

588
00:54:40,334 --> 00:54:41,981
Kordesky trained you?

589
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:42,762
Yeah.

590
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:44,634
I trained Kordesky.

591
00:55:08,044 --> 00:55:09,268
Son of a bitch!

592
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:16,176
Seal the building,

593
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:18,943
Bald white male, fifties, wearing white shirt,
blue pants ,

594
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:20,344
Shot in the shoulder.

595
00:55:21,544 --> 00:55:22,453
Come on.

596
00:55:26,968 --> 00:55:27,871
Hi.

597
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:31,005
We should go.

598
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:33,099
We should go now.

599
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,066
I've got check points at every exit.
What about the fire?

600
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:06,078
Shut off the alarm, I told you,
there is no fire.

601
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,310
We need to evacuate.

602
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,286
No, this is just a diversion.
Make sure everyone gets checked.

603
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:16,472
Help!

604
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:18,039
Please.

605
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:20,473
I can't stop the bleeding.

606
00:56:24,767 --> 00:56:26,141
It's okay, sir.

607
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,900
Make a hole.

608
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:32,432
Hold on, hold it, hold it.
Let me see him.

609
00:56:33,066 --> 00:56:34,334
It's not him.

610
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:38,275
Yeah, yeah go ahead.

611
00:56:38,883 --> 00:56:40,602
Here, let me help you.

612
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:43,582
We got him.

613
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:00,295
Marvin.

614
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:08,526
Theres' still something wrong
with this guys head, Frank.

615
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,235
You're really something, Joe.

616
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,544
- Marvin, you okay?
- I don't want to talk about it.

617
00:57:23,112 --> 00:57:25,895
Joe, who was dead..Joe?

618
00:57:26,137 --> 00:57:28,330
- She with us?
- Yeah.

619
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,324
Not dead.

620
00:57:32,427 --> 00:57:33,929
Just retired.

621
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,407
I guess calling wasn't an option, huh?.

622
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:43,179
- Can we go?
- Yeah.

623
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:48,884
Out.

624
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:51,880
Thanks, Doc.

625
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,750
What did he get?

626
00:57:55,696 --> 00:57:58,369
I have no idea.

627
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:03,483
You just had your ass handed to
you by a god damned retiree.

628
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:06,422
What did he do?

629
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:11,250
What did Moses do to earn
a lethal finding?

630
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,997
I have not been read into it.

631
00:58:13,997 --> 00:58:16,949
I like you Cooper.
You're ambitious and get results.

632
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:20,018
But someone just kicked in
the front door of our house,

633
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:22,812
so you better get your shit straight.

634
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:24,999
Nothing in your mission has changed.

635
00:58:27,544 --> 00:58:31,934
-Still bleeding, Must have knicked something in there.
-Mmm hmm.

636
00:58:31,934 --> 00:58:35,202
- This is so bad.
- It's not that bad.

637
00:58:35,202 --> 00:58:39,003
- People get shot all the time.
- No, they don't they get paper cuts.

638
00:58:39,003 --> 00:58:40,644
I mostly get shot.

639
00:58:40,644 --> 00:58:44,436
Well we're going to have to find somebody
to plug this leak.

640
00:58:48,378 --> 00:58:51,395
Eagle's Nest.

641
00:58:51,744 --> 00:58:54,360
Then we all get shot.

642
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:56,220
I'll just go in by myself

643
00:58:56,891 --> 00:58:58,405
Want a vest?

644
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,951
Wouldn't do any good.

645
00:59:39,062 --> 00:59:41,004
Frank Moses.

646
00:59:41,936 --> 00:59:43,735
Hi, Victoria.

647
00:59:48,424 --> 00:59:50,757
Are you here to kill me?

648
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,620
No.

649
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,191
You've been shot.

650
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:09,805
Tell Marvin to stand down before
he gets hurt.

651
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:12,451
All clear everyone.

652
01:00:19,427 --> 01:00:22,857
- Who's the girl?
- She's with me.

653
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,280
- Vicky.
- Joe!

654
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,560
Oh Vickey, sexy as ever.

655
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:33,555
Oh you old, snake charmer you.

656
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:38,044
Sarah, this is Victoria.
Best wetwork asset in the buisness.

657
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:40,523
And a true artist with an RPM.

658
01:00:40,523 --> 01:00:42,344
What? What's that?

659
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:45,688
I kill people, dear.

660
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,783
You were lucky.

661
01:00:57,107 --> 01:00:59,593
- How'd you do it?
- What?

662
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:02,131
How did you make the transition?

663
01:01:02,131 --> 01:01:05,623
You seem so calm, at ease ...

664
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:07,403
I love it.

665
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:09,382
I love it here. I love the..

666
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:12,532
...baking I love the flowering
arranging, I like...

667
01:01:12,532 --> 01:01:14,652
I like the routine.

668
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,500
Well I...

669
01:01:20,253 --> 01:01:24,331
...I do get a bit restless sometimes.

670
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:31,413
I take the odd  contract
on the side.

671
01:01:33,705 --> 01:01:35,976
I...I just can't stop.

672
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,011
Yeah ...

673
01:01:38,973 --> 01:01:42,695
- Tell me about it.
- You can't just flip a switch and
become someone else.

674
01:01:42,695 --> 01:01:44,664
Put some pressure on it.

675
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:48,912
So...

676
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:53,041
Tell me about your lady friend.

677
01:01:53,754 --> 01:01:57,440
Makes me think that I could
actually ...

678
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,426
... have a life.

679
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:04,606
A real life.

680
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:07,865
Oh Francis, you're such a romantic.

681
01:02:07,865 --> 01:02:09,917
- What?
- A Romantic.

682
01:02:09,917 --> 01:02:10,656
It's why I've always been
so fond of you.

683
01:02:10,657 --> 01:02:11,778
Victoria ...

684
01:02:11,779 --> 01:02:18,433
Little hard on the outside,
but you are, you are gooey on the inside.

685
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:22,596
Gooey.

686
01:02:23,982 --> 01:02:28,938
The entire back half of the Guatemala
file has been blacked out.

687
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:33,845
But there's a list, 11 names, plus
one that's been redacted

688
01:02:33,845 --> 01:02:36,669
All dead, except for
Frank and Marvin.

689
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,574
All the names on the reporters list
have been filed too.

690
01:02:39,574 --> 01:02:41,736
but she has a additional name.

691
01:02:41,736 --> 01:02:43,634
Alexander Dunning.

692
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,762
Somebody is protecting him

693
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,767
Dunning is the CEO of
Browning, Orvis.

694
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,169
Gangsters.

695
01:02:51,169 --> 01:02:53,003
Defence contractor.

696
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:55,299
We're connected.

697
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:58,976
You know, if the CIA is protecting him

698
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:01,176
He's under surveillance.

699
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:04,296
- We can go see him.
- You're not going without me.

700
01:03:04,296 --> 01:03:07,625
Well, we're getting the band back
together.

701
01:03:07,927 --> 01:03:09,454
That's nice.

702
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:37,484
Yeah.

703
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:40,424
We just got a tip.
RED has a new target.

704
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,212
A tip?

705
01:03:42,711 --> 01:03:44,431
FBI's on the scene.

706
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:45,836
I'm on my way.

707
01:03:57,138 --> 01:04:00,650
FBI has a lookout position
in the east perimeter.

708
01:04:00,651 --> 01:04:02,057
Copy that.

709
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,433
Alexander Dunning.

710
01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:30,324
Pleasure to see you,
Secretary Baptiste.

711
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,516
Pleasure is with me.

712
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:37,735
They're in.

713
01:04:39,748 --> 01:04:42,041
Frank said you wanted
me with you.

714
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:45,767
Yes, I thought it might be nice
to have bit of girl time together.

715
01:04:46,439 --> 01:04:48,870
You know, get to know each other.

716
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:55,207
And I just wanted to tell you, that
in all the year's I've known Francis,

717
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:58,766
I've never seen him like this.

718
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,644
So if you break his heart,
I will kill you.

719
01:05:03,644 --> 01:05:06,879
And bury your body in the woods.

720
01:05:06,894 --> 01:05:10,420
Wow...okay.

721
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:16,487
Oh, this is going to be fun!

722
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,984
<i>Here at Browning-Orvis,</i>

723
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:26,466
<i>we have a long standing commitment
to humanitarian causes,</i>

724
01:05:26,466 --> 01:05:30,580
<i>because exempliary corporate citizenship
is our highest calling.</i>

725
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,983
<i>As a company with global reach,
and global interests</i>

726
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:38,871
<i>We have global responsibilities.</i>

727
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:40,867
<i>Now sometimes I'm asked</i>

728
01:05:40,867 --> 01:05:43,565
<i>if this commitment to
ethical behavior</i>

729
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,413
<i>affects the bottom line.</i>

730
01:05:45,413 --> 01:05:48,048
<i>And my answer is always
the same.</i>

731
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,690
<i>Yes.</i>

732
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,623
<i>It makes it stronger.</i>

733
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:53,860
This is my safe room.

734
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,423
Soundproofed reinforced,

735
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:58,655
swept for bugs daily ...

736
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:02,617
You could fire a gun in here,
no one would ever know.

737
01:06:02,617 --> 01:06:04,942
Mr. Dunning

738
01:06:05,509 --> 01:06:11,228
I can not imagine a more perfect place
to conduct our business.

739
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:20,056
You do know that there is a, a surcharge.
Free arms deliveries

740
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:24,633
to countries that are embargoed
by the United Nations.

741
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:29,740
For every problem, Monsieur, there is
a solution.

742
01:06:33,449 --> 01:06:35,070
Excuse me.

743
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,076
<i>- ... buisness and it makes us
- What?</i>

744
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:45,995
<i>How many CEO's can say that?</i>

745
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:48,424
So how did you guys meet?

746
01:06:49,057 --> 01:06:51,618
We started talking on the phone.

747
01:06:52,724 --> 01:06:56,997
I guess I liked that it
wasn't real.

748
01:06:57,264 --> 01:07:00,167
'Course now I'm a fugitive the CIA wants to kill me,

749
01:07:00,167 --> 01:07:02,890
and I'm hiding in a hole.

750
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:07,460
You know, I was in love with
an agent, once.

751
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,386
What happened?

752
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:12,484
Well I was with MI6,

753
01:07:12,484 --> 01:07:16,836
and the relationship
wasn't...sanctioned.

754
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:22,098
So when it came to light,
my loyalty was questioned.

755
01:07:22,098 --> 01:07:24,089
And I was ordered to kill him.

756
01:07:24,089 --> 01:07:26,087
It was a test.

757
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:28,145
What did you do?

758
01:07:29,149 --> 01:07:31,588
Put three bullets
in his chest.

759
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:34,175
Okay,

760
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,439
Who the hell are you guys?

761
01:07:37,439 --> 01:07:39,455
You don't remember us?

762
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:42,679
We remember you.

763
01:07:42,679 --> 01:07:47,629
You're the guy who's shit we cleaned up
down in Guatemala 1981.

764
01:07:48,714 --> 01:07:51,375
And the question is...

765
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:53,777
Who did you fly out of there?

766
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:57,821
Y..You don't have any idea what
you're getting into.

767
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,322
First of all,

768
01:08:00,322 --> 01:08:02,087
you can't touch me.

769
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:03,749
Sure we can.

770
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:16,451
Oh yeah...

771
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:17,805
Where'd you get this?

772
01:08:17,805 --> 01:08:19,504
Home Depot.

773
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:21,938
-How much?
-Ten bucks.

774
01:08:22,954 --> 01:08:28,127
You want nuts, nipples, potty trainer.

775
01:08:28,535 --> 01:08:31,348
- All right, stop it.
- Nuts.

776
01:08:31,818 --> 01:08:33,246
Stop it!

777
01:08:33,246 --> 01:08:36,647
For the love of Christ,
STOP IT! Stop already.

778
01:08:38,343 --> 01:08:41,694
Now you got something to say?

779
01:08:42,907 --> 01:08:46,830
We extracted a young lieutenant,

780
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:52,694
who was the son of the late Senator,
James Stanton.

781
01:08:56,017 --> 01:08:57,516
Robert Stanton?

782
01:08:57,516 --> 01:09:00,068
Vice President of the United States.

783
01:09:00,068 --> 01:09:03,997
You're saying the Vice President
killed all the people in that village?

784
01:09:03,997 --> 01:09:06,815
Yeah, went completely off
the reservation.

785
01:09:06,815 --> 01:09:10,137
And that New York Times Reporter,
did she pressure you?

786
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:13,020
Yeah, yeah, she called me, twice.

787
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:15,830
So I called the VP.

788
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:18,960
And, what did you think would
happen then?

789
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,456
Oh, whatever ...

790
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,819
I made him Vice President.

791
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:26,768
And kept your mouth shut, and
the Stantons made you rich.

792
01:09:26,768 --> 01:09:30,122
<i>We have been working with our partners
in the developing road to root out corruption,</i>

793
01:09:30,122 --> 01:09:33,401
<i>..ruption, ...ruption,</i>

794
01:09:34,145 --> 01:09:35,398
Okay.

795
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:40,634
I will pay whatever it costs

796
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:43,068
to get rid of this thing.

797
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:45,621
We're not here for money, homes.

798
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:49,341
We're here because that New York times
reporter had the list of names,

799
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:52,125
of everybody who was in Guatemala.

800
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:55,066
And everybody on that list,
has been ordered killed.

801
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,905
Except you.

802
01:09:57,615 --> 01:10:00,775
I had nothing to do with that.

803
01:10:01,321 --> 01:10:02,949
Don't you see?

804
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:08,010
He's trying to clean up his past and,
get rid of me in one shot.

805
01:10:09,213 --> 01:10:12,779
He's trying to cut me loose before he
runs for President.

806
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:17,082
We have some major activity out here.
Looks like we're blown.

807
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:34,642
We're in position,
perimeters set.

808
01:10:34,642 --> 01:10:36,020
No ones getting away.

809
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:41,875
They're moving a team up the
east side.

810
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:44,051
Are you going to let me talk to them?

811
01:10:44,051 --> 01:10:45,831
I can negotiate something.

812
01:10:45,831 --> 01:10:48,833
Thanks, but when we want your help,
we'll bring out the drain cleaner.

813
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:51,120
Listen, plastic man.

814
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,652
Those bastards probable have orders
to kill me, too.

815
01:10:54,652 --> 01:10:56,127
I hope so.

816
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:59,583
Why, 'cause I'm a bad guy?

817
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,615
I'm scum?

818
01:11:01,615 --> 01:11:03,151
Can I just shoot him now?

819
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:06,959
No. You don't have people killed.

820
01:11:06,959 --> 01:11:11,810
I have people killed, I'm
the bad guy...remember?

821
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:18,711
Not worth the bullet.

822
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:27,889
Hello?

823
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:31,570
- How's retirement, Frank?
- It's been a real blast.

824
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:34,357
If we have to come in there and get you,
it's going to be messy.

825
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:37,406
You bet, real messy.

826
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:41,024
- I've got my orders, Frank.
- They come from the Vice President?

827
01:11:41,024 --> 01:11:43,464
He's ordered these hits to cover up
the war crimes he commited..

828
01:11:43,464 --> 01:11:44,649
..in Guatemala.

829
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:46,739
Well I find that hard to believe.

830
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,763
How did you know you'd find me here?

831
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:51,471
Some anonymous untraceable tip?

832
01:11:53,067 --> 01:11:55,274
Here's the deal, Frank.

833
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:58,316
You're gonna walk out that front door
and give yourself up.

834
01:11:58,316 --> 01:12:00,734
You have my word no one
will shoot you.

835
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:04,986
I will personally take you in and you
get to tell your side of the story.

836
01:12:04,986 --> 01:12:07,458
You got 60 seconds
to decide.

837
01:12:11,092 --> 01:12:14,519
- What's it look like?
- There's no clean exit.

838
01:12:14,519 --> 01:12:17,072
They seem to be coming from everywhere.

839
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:23,802
We're running out of options.

840
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:26,997
If we have a distraction, I could cover
you to the woods.

841
01:12:39,053 --> 01:12:42,840
Looks like there's not a lot
of options, kid.

842
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,630
Somebody's going to have to make
the hard choice,

843
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,580
if we're going to get out
of here alive.

844
01:13:05,863 --> 01:13:07,758
And well?

845
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:12,801
Hard and crazy.

846
01:13:13,011 --> 01:13:16,138
But I wouldn't want it any other way.

847
01:13:22,682 --> 01:13:24,925
An honor.

848
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:33,114
Good luck.

849
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:42,994
Tell them to hold their fire.

850
01:13:42,995 --> 01:13:44,925
I'm coming out.

851
01:13:46,026 --> 01:13:47,806
He's coming out.

852
01:13:48,059 --> 01:13:52,181
All units hold fire, repeat,
all units hold fire.

853
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,030
Get behind.

854
01:14:01,295 --> 01:14:04,485
Come out now, I've got you covered.

855
01:14:20,124 --> 01:14:21,976
Who fired the shot?

856
01:14:46,813 --> 01:14:49,844
Tell me when the boys make cover,
we'll move.

857
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:52,219
Now!

858
01:15:31,095 --> 01:15:33,364
They got Sarah.

859
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:38,405
Frank, you're no good to her dead.

860
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:40,424
We gotta move.

861
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:46,997
Come, now is not time to waste.

862
01:15:46,997 --> 01:15:48,885
Ivan?

863
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:51,872
Zaychick Moy.

864
01:15:51,872 --> 01:15:54,435
It's nice to see you again, Ivan.

865
01:15:54,435 --> 01:15:56,926
Did he just call you "bunny"?

866
01:15:58,427 --> 01:16:01,015
Life sometimes is complicated.

867
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,126
Quickly.

868
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:09,865
To Joe.

869
01:16:12,091 --> 01:16:13,751
To Joe.

870
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:27,576
Not to push the bounds of propriety but,
Don't you think,

871
01:16:27,576 --> 01:16:30,248
we aught to discuss the fact that the CIA's
being used

872
01:16:30,248 --> 01:16:33,703
by the Vice President as his
personal hit squad and

873
01:16:33,703 --> 01:16:37,284
that they'll do whatever they can
to find us and kill us?

874
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:40,261
Options?

875
01:16:41,895 --> 01:16:44,602
We could go public.

876
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:48,226
That didn't work very
well for the reporter.

877
01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:50,760
And what about Frank's girlfriend?

878
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,687
They'll kill her so fast, I mean ...

879
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:56,856
First they'll interrogate her they probably
already got the wires then ...

880
01:16:56,856 --> 01:17:00,128
give her a little snorkle, give her a jump.

881
01:17:00,128 --> 01:17:01,793
- Bring in the death ...
- Marvin!

882
01:17:03,135 --> 01:17:06,288
God, you're such an idiot!

883
01:17:19,252 --> 01:17:21,456
I want to show you something.

884
01:17:28,517 --> 01:17:32,469
That was done to me by the
love of my life.

885
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:35,926
It seems that what we had,
was not meant to be.

886
01:17:35,926 --> 01:17:41,444
But now, she sits outside my house ...

887
01:17:42,221 --> 01:17:44,726
... drinking vodka.

888
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,744
Three bullets in the chest.

889
01:17:52,048 --> 01:17:54,934
When I woke alive

890
01:17:56,822 --> 01:17:59,717
I knew she still loved me.

891
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:03,057
Or else, it would have been
the head.

892
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:06,641
It was big risk for her, of course but ...

893
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:11,387
One does crazy things for love.

894
01:18:14,102 --> 01:18:17,935
Do not fear for your love, my friend.

895
01:18:17,935 --> 01:18:23,645
With a small, dedicated group,
there is nothing that cannot be accomplished.

896
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:26,189
Let me be blunt.

897
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:29,671
No one knows you're here.
You don't exist.

898
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:34,734
And unless you don't cooperate fully,
there's nothing I can't do to you.

899
01:18:34,734 --> 01:18:37,401
So why don't you and I start talking?

900
01:18:37,725 --> 01:18:39,565
- Sir.
- Not now.

901
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:42,231
Moses is on the phone.

902
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:46,067
The trace is running.

903
01:18:51,442 --> 01:18:52,416
Moses.

904
01:18:53,013 --> 01:18:55,469
Here's the thing, Cooper.

905
01:18:55,742 --> 01:18:57,743
With age,

906
01:18:57,743 --> 01:18:59,701
comes a certain, perspective.

907
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:04,220
I'd be a lier if I said there wasn't a time,
when I was exactly like you.

908
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,635
Blind ambition,
displaced trust ...

909
01:19:07,635 --> 01:19:09,431
Why are  you telling me this?

910
01:19:09,431 --> 01:19:12,241
It might help me to decide what
to do next.

911
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:13,492
Keep him going.

912
01:19:13,492 --> 01:19:15,569
Well, what are you thinking about?

913
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:18,620
Our buisness is very harmful.

914
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,659
But it was never, the killing, the stress ...

915
01:19:23,139 --> 01:19:25,390
... the bad pay didn't bother me.

916
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,351
Well, what was it, Frank?

917
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:33,160
It's that anything that you love, can
be taken away from you.

918
01:19:33,512 --> 01:19:37,890
They tell you to never care, never invest...

919
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:40,672
Then I met this woman ...

920
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:42,500
Sarah.

921
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,874
And now, you have her.

922
01:19:47,142 --> 01:19:51,353
I can't think of anything
more horrible than to know that your

923
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:54,894
enemies can hurt someone that you love.

924
01:19:54,894 --> 01:19:58,271
The feeling is almost undescribable.

925
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,586
You still there, Cooper?

926
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,564
You're in my house.

927
01:20:16,485 --> 01:20:18,840
Almost indescribable, isn't it?

928
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:23,511
Please ...

929
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:26,870
please don't hurt my family.

930
01:20:27,259 --> 01:20:33,200
If anything happens to Sarah, I will
rip everything you love out of your life.

931
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,408
And then I'll kill you.

932
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:40,400
I'll do whatever you want to keep Sarah safe.

933
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,653
We don't have much time.
Do you understand that?

934
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,949
What are you going to do, Frank?

935
01:20:48,949 --> 01:20:51,717
I'm going to kill the
Vice President.

936
01:20:51,717 --> 01:20:52,750
What are you going to do?

937
01:21:07,872 --> 01:21:08,761
Ma!

938
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:18,941
Frank left this for me.

939
01:22:19,652 --> 01:22:21,620
Where did he get it from?

940
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:26,192
The secure records depository of the CIA.

941
01:22:36,346 --> 01:22:38,404
Look, Sarah ...

942
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:43,785
I know Franks' been right about
a few things.

943
01:22:43,785 --> 01:22:48,002
But he's about to cross the line
from which there is no turning back.

944
01:22:48,002 --> 01:22:52,555
Right now, you have an opportunity
to help him.

945
01:22:52,555 --> 01:22:55,627
You need to tell me
everything you know.

946
01:22:55,627 --> 01:23:02,059
Because if I can't stop him,
I'm going to have to kill him.

947
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:12,098
Do  you know who Frank Moses is?
I mean, really is?

948
01:23:12,098 --> 01:23:15,158
Do you know what he's done?

949
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,700
Wow!

950
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:23,948
You're asking me for help?
That is so lame.

951
01:23:24,711 --> 01:23:27,460
He's going to eat you for lunch.

952
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:35,672
She's never going to trust us.

953
01:23:35,672 --> 01:23:37,157
I can't blame her.

954
01:23:37,157 --> 01:23:41,527
The tip off is a trap, someones got us
dancing like marionettes.

955
01:23:46,206 --> 01:23:48,732
Just like Moses called it.

956
01:23:49,235 --> 01:23:50,596
Yeah.

957
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,948
He will take a shot at the VP.

958
01:23:54,948 --> 01:23:57,529
That's the problem for the Secret Service.

959
01:23:59,142 --> 01:24:01,701
Moses would take them apart.

960
01:24:03,115 --> 01:24:06,053
Plug me into their detail.

961
01:24:06,053 --> 01:24:07,971
You got it.

962
01:24:08,367 --> 01:24:10,243
What about her?

963
01:24:10,243 --> 01:24:13,797
I'd keep her close, protected, off the grid.

964
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:22,723
I put a few things away.

965
01:24:22,723 --> 01:24:24,848
Just in case, you know.

966
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:27,016
Frank ...

967
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,826
Swedish K.

968
01:24:35,059 --> 01:24:37,919
Now that is exciting.

969
01:24:39,632 --> 01:24:43,433
- Explosives?
- Just press the rpg's.

970
01:24:43,433 --> 01:24:46,588
- I love you, man.
- Make yourself at home.

971
01:24:46,588 --> 01:24:48,900
Vice President is going to love this.

972
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,734
Nice to see you, sir.

973
01:25:18,339 --> 01:25:19,790
WHOA!!

974
01:25:49,173 --> 01:25:50,657
Sorry.

975
01:25:50,772 --> 01:25:52,344
Silly.

976
01:25:56,316 --> 01:25:57,315
Thank you, ma'am.

977
01:26:10,285 --> 01:26:11,815
Thank you very much.

978
01:26:21,064 --> 01:26:24,400
-Welcome, Ms. Brown.
-Mmm, hmm.

979
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:28,069
It's a pleasure to have
you at our victory fun gala.

980
01:26:28,069 --> 01:26:31,614
- Oh, I'm so looking forward to it.
- Have a lovely night.

981
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,572
Director is clear for entry.

982
01:26:36,885 --> 01:26:38,856
After you, Mr. Vice President.

983
01:26:38,856 --> 01:26:41,194
<i>... a war hero, a fabulous friend</i>

984
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:43,642
<i>and a wonderful leader.</i>

985
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:48,065
<i>And so it is with great pleasure
I introduce to you</i>

986
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:50,438
<i>Vice President Robert Stanton.</i>

987
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,047
Thank you, thank you everybody.

988
01:27:00,047 --> 01:27:02,601
Thank you so much for being here.

989
01:27:02,601 --> 01:27:06,975
I'm going to keep this short and sweet
so you can actually write those checks
you've been promising.

990
01:27:10,136 --> 01:27:11,935
Seriously though ...

991
01:27:12,163 --> 01:27:14,144
Great to see you all.

992
01:27:14,144 --> 01:27:17,956
You those here, who have brought
me to the White House.

993
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:22,354
For a long, long time.

994
01:27:25,538 --> 01:27:27,155
My good friends,

995
01:27:27,155 --> 01:27:30,331
I'm proud to announce that I will be forming
a exploritory commity with the primary goal,

996
01:27:30,331 --> 01:27:34,659
of seeking a nomination for the presidency.

997
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:46,784
We had a great, great journey together,

998
01:27:46,784 --> 01:27:51,419
But I firmly believe that the
best is still to come.

999
01:27:51,419 --> 01:27:53,288
God bless you all.

1000
01:27:53,288 --> 01:27:55,278
And God bless America.

1001
01:28:19,141 --> 01:28:20,935
Hello, bunny.

1002
01:28:20,935 --> 01:28:23,895
Moves like that could get you killed.

1003
01:28:23,895 --> 01:28:27,940
Your radiance tonight has rendered me
almost speechless.

1004
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,410
Almost.

1005
01:28:34,908 --> 01:28:38,527
I've always dreamed of killing
an American President.

1006
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:40,068
Vice President.

1007
01:28:40,068 --> 01:28:42,038
Hmm, whatever.

1008
01:28:42,508 --> 01:28:46,877
Having you in my arms, once again.
I get carried away.

1009
01:28:46,877 --> 01:28:48,490
Really?

1010
01:28:49,885 --> 01:28:52,408
Tell me you love me.

1011
01:28:53,254 --> 01:28:55,632
It's been a long time, Ivan.

1012
01:28:55,632 --> 01:28:57,910
Blink of an eye.

1013
01:28:59,854 --> 01:29:01,552
-Ivan.
-Hmmm

1014
01:29:01,552 --> 01:29:04,479
The music has stopped.

1015
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:06,285
Has it?

1016
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:10,934
Ah, to work then.

1017
01:29:17,077 --> 01:29:18,370
Ivan.

1018
01:29:32,865 --> 01:29:34,188
You smell that?

1019
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:59,591
- This area is off limits.
- It's fine, it's fine.

1020
01:29:59,591 --> 01:30:01,003
You'll have to turn around.

1021
01:30:01,003 --> 01:30:02,745
No, no, no, no it's fine.

1022
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:04,265
It's alright, I'm sure I'm allowed.

1023
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:07,520
You'll have go back up Ma'am, or I'll
have to treat you as a threat.

1024
01:30:07,521 --> 01:30:09,694
Where exactly is the threat?

1025
01:30:30,038 --> 01:30:32,035
Oh my God!

1026
01:30:32,035 --> 01:30:35,269
Gas! I smell gas!

1027
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:37,774
Gas, gas!

1028
01:30:48,533 --> 01:30:49,891
Get it open.

1029
01:30:52,407 --> 01:30:56,515
Find Exit four, Secondary, Move!
Move, move, move.

1030
01:31:00,532 --> 01:31:03,655
Let me out of here! Let me out
of here, let me out!

1031
01:32:12,081 --> 01:32:14,710
Get back up here, the north stairwell. Now!

1032
01:32:44,818 --> 01:32:48,059
Move to the other Limo, I'll cover you.

1033
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,655
We have to go, now...NOW!

1034
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,761
Approaching target from the rear.

1035
01:33:44,163 --> 01:33:46,134
OUTSIDE!

1036
01:33:47,072 --> 01:33:49,275
Secret Service, everybody down!

1037
01:33:50,634 --> 01:33:51,953
Move!

1038
01:34:13,261 --> 01:34:15,770
Cover us! We're moving, now!

1039
01:34:16,731 --> 01:34:18,637
Come on, go!

1040
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:27,670
I remember the Secret
Service being tougher.

1041
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:28,921
Me too.

1042
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:33,888
- Okay
- Yeah.

1043
01:34:41,465 --> 01:34:42,674
Marvin.

1044
01:34:45,809 --> 01:34:46,836
I got it!

1045
01:35:04,329 --> 01:35:05,778
Ready to go.

1046
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:18,850
- Almost there.
- Marvin ...

1047
01:35:18,851 --> 01:35:20,219
We gotta move.

1048
01:35:20,938 --> 01:35:22,661
You're on your own.

1049
01:35:22,661 --> 01:35:25,506
I'm no use to you now.

1050
01:35:25,748 --> 01:35:28,653
Good luck. Go!

1051
01:35:32,376 --> 01:35:34,018
Let's move!

1052
01:35:35,531 --> 01:35:37,269
Are you hit, sir?

1053
01:35:37,269 --> 01:35:40,008
-Are you hit?
-I'm fine, just get me the hell out of here.

1054
01:35:58,097 --> 01:36:02,799
Perhaps, I could be of assistance.

1055
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,179
Oh, I love you.

1056
01:36:17,746 --> 01:36:19,116
I know.

1057
01:36:21,352 --> 01:36:23,087
Move!

1058
01:36:26,246 --> 01:36:27,668
Freeze!

1059
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:35,743
What the...

1060
01:36:38,669 --> 01:36:40,126
Run!

1061
01:36:54,234 --> 01:36:55,840
Go!

1062
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:58,059
Go, go, GO!

1063
01:37:02,592 --> 01:37:05,360
Stop the car!

1064
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,255
Don't you dare stop! Keep going!

1065
01:37:07,255 --> 01:37:09,290
Pull over!

1066
01:37:17,257 --> 01:37:19,945
I want to know what
the hell that was all about!

1067
01:37:39,883 --> 01:37:42,068
- Burbacher!
- Get him off.

1068
01:37:45,387 --> 01:37:47,225
Procture is secure.

1069
01:38:03,818 --> 01:38:05,083
Who are you?

1070
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:08,255
One of the men you ordered killed.

1071
01:38:08,945 --> 01:38:11,552
I don't know what you're talking about.

1072
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:13,698
Guatemala.

1073
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:16,053
I was there.

1074
01:38:28,843 --> 01:38:32,138
I'm sure we can negotiate something.

1075
01:38:32,138 --> 01:38:34,888
Starting to come back to you now, is it?

1076
01:38:35,992 --> 01:38:40,596
- If you're looking for revenge...
- This is not about revenge.

1077
01:38:45,055 --> 01:38:47,533
Are you here to kill me?

1078
01:38:49,996 --> 01:38:51,892
Not just you.

1079
01:39:02,597 --> 01:39:03,197
Yeah.

1080
01:39:03,553 --> 01:39:06,241
I'm at the Evanston power plant.

1081
01:39:06,241 --> 01:39:08,489
You have 15 minutes to
bring me Sarah

1082
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:10,444
Or I kill the Vice President.

1083
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:16,907
He just made contact. He wants the girl.

1084
01:39:16,907 --> 01:39:20,087
Evanston power station, 15 minutes.

1085
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:23,438
- You better alert Secret Service.
Copy that.

1086
01:39:24,345 --> 01:39:26,156
Secret Service is enroute.

1087
01:39:44,703 --> 01:39:46,108
Come on.

1088
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:51,786
Where's Sarah?

1089
01:39:51,786 --> 01:39:53,840
She's on her way.

1090
01:39:55,178 --> 01:39:57,265
It's over, Frank.

1091
01:39:57,581 --> 01:40:01,094
Any minute the whole world
is going to drop on you.

1092
01:40:01,094 --> 01:40:03,020
We'll see.

1093
01:40:25,965 --> 01:40:29,220
Hey, tough guy.

1094
01:40:29,704 --> 01:40:32,810
Surprised to see me?

1095
01:40:33,411 --> 01:40:38,475
- What the hell is this?
- Alex, just give him what he wants.

1096
01:40:38,475 --> 01:40:40,250
I can't do this anymore.

1097
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:46,395
You ordered these
killings, not me.

1098
01:40:46,395 --> 01:40:48,560
I don't want anything to
do with this anymore.

1099
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:55,630
You shot me ...

1100
01:40:56,925 --> 01:40:58,138
Shut up.

1101
01:41:02,502 --> 01:41:05,455
I love watching you be a good guy.

1102
01:41:05,456 --> 01:41:09,956
Kicking ass for your country.

1103
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:13,700
And show a spectacular
lack of vision.

1104
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:18,390
- The girl goes free.
- That'll cost you a gun.

1105
01:41:23,551 --> 01:41:24,650
A life for a life.

1106
01:41:29,394 --> 01:41:32,393
I tore up all those checks.

1107
01:41:32,993 --> 01:41:34,143
I know.

1108
01:41:37,610 --> 01:41:39,290
I just wanted to talk to you.

1109
01:41:45,992 --> 01:41:49,120
Cooper, cuff him.

1110
01:42:02,966 --> 01:42:05,572
Woods told me you had promise...okay

1111
01:42:05,572 --> 01:42:08,029
Here's how it goes ...

1112
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:10,030
Moses just shot the VP.

1113
01:42:10,031 --> 01:42:14,470
You kill him and the girl, and
you're head of the CIA.

1114
01:42:17,179 --> 01:42:18,837
Cooper.

1115
01:42:20,136 --> 01:42:22,824
This is going to happen, either way.

1116
01:42:24,828 --> 01:42:26,800
Fuck you, Cynthia.

1117
01:43:24,057 --> 01:43:25,679
Thanks.

1118
01:43:30,197 --> 01:43:31,620
He's going to be a problem.

1119
01:43:35,838 --> 01:43:38,680
Naw, I got it ...

1120
01:43:40,835 --> 01:43:41,870
...Grandpa.

1121
01:43:53,474 --> 01:43:56,573
- Feel better now?
- Yeah.

1122
01:43:56,573 --> 01:43:59,045
Want to get pancakes?

1123
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:04,410
Can you believe it, it
all worked out.

1124
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:08,576
Something bad is going to happen
very soon.

1125
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,421
Maybe not. Wait a second ...

1126
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:13,245
Nobody's chasing us.

1127
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:16,590
No one's trying to kill us.

1128
01:44:17,475 --> 01:44:18,680
I think we just got our lives back.

1129
01:44:20,827 --> 01:44:21,830
Almost.

1130
01:44:23,269 --> 01:44:26,890
- You still owe me a small favor.
- Oh, Ivan!

1131
01:44:28,138 --> 01:44:29,500
His timing is terrible.

1132
01:44:30,548 --> 01:44:31,940
You gave a favor to him?

1133
01:44:33,384 --> 01:44:36,170
Just a tiny little nuclear
problem in Moldova.

1134
01:44:38,347 --> 01:44:39,355
Can we go?

1135
01:44:43,126 --> 01:44:44,857
Yes, we can.

1136
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:16,349
I told you something bad was
going to happen.

1137
01:45:16,349 --> 01:45:18,255
Keep your skirt on goldie locks.

1138
01:45:19,573 --> 01:45:21,109
Moldova sucks!

1139
01:45:21,537 --> 01:45:23,067
Moldova sucks!

1140
01:45:24,163 --> 01:45:26,420
Don't worry, our case is just around the corner.
