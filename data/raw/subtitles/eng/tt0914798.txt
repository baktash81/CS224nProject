the thing about being a soldier,

is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

you to go somewhere, you go.

342
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,119
Why do you people
wear pyjamas all day?

343
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,951
- They're not pyjamas.
- Well, those.

344
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,718
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

345
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,557
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

346
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,238
The soldiers? Why?

347
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,753
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

348
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,637
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier,

349
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,437
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

350
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,038
What sort, then?

351
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,399
Well, he's the important sort.

352
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,910
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

353
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,508
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

354
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,118
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

355
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,996
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up

356
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,032

It's like Pavel.

357

Do you know him? Lives over there.

358
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,469
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

Can I ask you another question?

360
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,675
What do you burn in those chimneys?

361
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,269
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

362
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,278
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

363
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,470

Yes, I'm sorry.

I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

369
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,554
I can't, can I? Because of this.

370
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,674
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

371

No, it's to stop people getting out.

00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,755
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,156
I think I should go now.

375
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,314
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

- Bye.

- Coming from the chimneys.
- FATHER: What sort of ill?

does he usually teach children

We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

511
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,159
Really, when?

512
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,636
About four years ago,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

513
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,232
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

514
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,558
Where did he go?

515
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,912
Lieutenant Kotler,

516
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,709
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

517
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,118
I believe it was Switzerland,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

518
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,669
FATHER: How strange that he should
choose to leave the Fatherland

519
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,199
at the very moment it needed him most.

520
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,959
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

521
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,319
More wine!

522
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,313
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

523
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,629
KOTLER: <i>Herr Kommandant?</i>

524
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,712
Did he go there to take the air?

525
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,912
I'm afraid I really don't know,
<i>Herr Kommandant.</i>

526
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,871
You'd have to ask him.

527
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,559
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

528
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,750
With him being in Switzerland.

529
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,668
Come on!

530
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,268
What's the matter with you tonight?

531
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,756
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

532
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,080
Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

533
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,550
- I mean, with government policy.
- GRANDPA: One hears of such men.

534
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,869

or just plain cowards.

535
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,351
FATHER: Even so, all of them traitors.
GRANDPA: Absolutely right.

536
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,918
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

537
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,555
you will have informed your superiors,

- What did you expect him to do?

Can I ask you something
about the farm?

546
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,832
Oh, Bruno, you don't still think
it's a farm, do you?

547
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,552
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

548
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,396
For Jews, obviously.

549
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,593
Just Jews?

550
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,189
Because they're the best workers?

551
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,636
They're not in there

552
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,398
They're no good at anything.

553
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,158
They're in there because they're evil.

- The enemy?

555

- They're evil, Bruno.

No. Not really.

He's a good man.

679
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,078
- Here?
- No.

680
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,669
(BOTH GIGGLING)

681
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,560
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

682
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,716
FATHER: You can't behave like this!

683
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,111
MOTHER: You're questioning
my behaviour?

684
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,513
FATHER: It can't continue!

685
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:24,109
MOTHER: I know.
I can't stand this any more, Ralf.

686
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,469
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

687
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,512
FATHER: Don't you think
there will be questions?

688
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,959
MOTHER: Questions?
FATHER: Well, now, what does it say

689
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,516
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

690
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,959
MOTHER: Work?
Is that what you call it?

691
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,399
FATHER: Pull yourself together,
woman.

692
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,158
MOTHER: Right.
Just ignore it. Ignore it.

693
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,829
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

694
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,680
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

695
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,718
Are you happy here?

696
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,712
Yes. Very.

697
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,392
And you, Gretel?

698
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:12,234
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

699
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,670
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

700
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,228
No. Not any more, really.

701
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:37,953
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

702
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,515
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

703
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,314
GRETEL: Back home?
FATHER: No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

704
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,715
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

705
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,996
All of us? You as well?

706
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,231
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

707
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,840
I must stay
and complete my work here.

708
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,635
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it...

709
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,833
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

710
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,632
Would you like that?

711
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,513
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

712
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,154
The important thing is
your mother does not feel

713
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,998
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

714
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,555
and the more I think about it, the more
I realise she's very probably right.

715
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,033
- But, Dad...
- No!

716
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,070
It's time for you to move away.

717
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,116
Is everything all right?

718
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,751
We can't find Papa.

719
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,360
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

720
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,470
and they haven't come back.

721
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,755
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

722
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,277
How long for this time?

723
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,076
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

724
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,318
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

725
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,832
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

726
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,510
So, I won't ever see you again?

727
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,239
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

728
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,397
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

729
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,833
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

730
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,716
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

731
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,672
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

732
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,473
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

733
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,351
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

734
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,473
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

735
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,909
Look.

736
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,397
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

737
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,238
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

738
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,594
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

739
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,437
I don't look like you.

740
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,515
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

741
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,076
You could look like me, though.

742
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,395
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

743
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,476
I'm not shaving my hair off.

744
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,799
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pyjamas are a different colour.

745
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,469
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

746
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,080
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

747
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,270
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

748
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,834
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

749
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,156
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

750
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,316
And don't forget the pyjamas!

751
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,869
Bruno?

752
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,075
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

758
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:21,789
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pyjamas!

759
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,592
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

760
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,555
Oh.

- Can we go to the café or something?
- Café?

774
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,712
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

775
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,949
Yeah.

776
