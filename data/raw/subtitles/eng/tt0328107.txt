1
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:27,458
There is one kidnapping every 60 minutes
in Latin America.

2
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:31,455
70°%° ofthe victims do not survive.

3
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:21,258
?Si? ?Bueno?

4
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:24,971
Family is everything, no?

5
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,213
Now, do you love your son?

6
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:31,101
Si.

7
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:42,772
Now, do you understand?

8
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:48,054
You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.

9
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:49,981
Follow these instructions

10
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,611
or God be with your child.

11
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:54,421
You will remove your shirt

12
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:56,538
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

13
00:02:57,462 --> 00:02:59,373
Be professional.

14
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:01,298
Come alone.

15
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,181
!Porfavor!!Ayùdenme!

16
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,375
!Ayùdenme, porfavor!

17
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:55,654
EL PASO, TEXAS
US / MEXICO BORDER

18
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:57,541
Georgina! Obey me.
I will love you. Come on.

19
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,690
- That's how it works, huh?
- That's right.

20
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:10,657
She got a sister?

21
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,533
How's business?

22
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:17,575
The Japanese are here in a big way.

23
00:05:18,582 --> 00:05:25,260
Cheap labour, factory space, but they feel
a lot safer living over the border in EI Paso.

24
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:30,211
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

25
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:37,613
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

26
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:44,173
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

27
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:48,733
No. I've been movin' around. You know.
Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.

28
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:51,973
Nothin' catches my fancy.

29
00:05:54,982 --> 00:05:58,338
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

30
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:00,538
- No.
- You don't?

31
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:01,896
Me either.

32
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:08,817
- How long you stayin'?
- I don't know, I just... you know.

33
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,736
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

34
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:15,290
I just came by on impulse.

35
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,816
I could do with some impulse.

36
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,253
What happened?

37
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:37,537
Family paid the ransom, then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days.

38
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,692
Minus an ear, of course.

39
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:43,331
Now every mother in Mexico City
with money wants bigger bodyguards.

40
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:47,540
- My own wife included.
- I hate to break it to you, but she's right.

41
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,931
She's right.

42
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:54,254
Look, Sammy, all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance.

43
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:57,459
I have a policy.
AIG. My dad gave it to me.

44
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,295
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

45
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:04,853
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't
renew it because you have no bodyguard?

46
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:07,695
I know. I had to let Emilio go.

47
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:12,697
Well, you gotta please Lisa.
I mean, ass like that's hard to find.

48
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,693
Look.

49
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:20,902
A bodyguard's like anything else.
You get what you pay for, OK?

50
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,815
You could do this.
Get one that's got a decent résumé.

51
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,861
We're not lookin' for goddamn Superman,
right? Get someone cheap.

52
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:34,290
So you renew the policy, and then
fire the prick for whatever - incompetence.

53
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:38,853
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school,

54
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:41,775
and that your wife gets to save face.

55
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:48,097
This way you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood.

56
00:07:57,942 --> 00:08:01,935
That's right, a bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.

57
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:04,980
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

58
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,973
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

59
00:08:07,062 --> 00:08:10,896
It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.

60
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:15,294
Yeah? You think they'd
hire a drunk, a has-been?

61
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,772
You have to keep it under control.

62
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:24,732
What ifthere was, you know... just, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

63
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:29,498
You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.

64
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:33,814
It's not exactly a scam, Crease.
Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.

65
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:37,497
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta
be close to people, though.

66
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:40,494
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.

67
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:44,461
You'll be the silent type.
They're gonna appreciate that.

68
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:53,897
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

69
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,655
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

70
00:08:56,742 --> 00:09:00,860
- He owns one ofthe plants in Juàrez.
- Yeah?

71
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:03,297
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

72
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,658
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

73
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:10,417
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

74
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:14,290
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.

75
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:17,260
- And you thought of me?
- Yeah.

76
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:20,732
Take ajob, Crease. Breathe some air.

77
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,972
Then decide ifyou want to stick around.

78
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:27,180
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know?
I got nobody to talk to down here.

79
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:39,252
Listen, my wife wants
someone presentable and polite.

80
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:42,732
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

81
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:44,494
Your résumé's quite impressive.

82
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:48,939
16 years of military experience,
extensive counter-terrorism work.

83
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,298
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

84
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:54,498
I drink.

85
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:56,573
How does that affect you?

86
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,098
Coordination, reaction time.

87
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:04,572
Iftop professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can,

88
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,051
but the service will be on a par with the pay.

89
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,893
What if amateurs try it?

90
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:14,179
I'd probably kill 'em. Is that likely?

91
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,059
No.

92
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:21,170
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

93
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:47,453
Lisa!

94
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,373
Lisa!

95
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:05,859
My wife Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

96
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,777
- You're an American.
- So are you.

97
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,501
It's all in there.

98
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,937
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes. Jack and water would be good.

99
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:28,577
Have you done much of
this kind ofwork before?

100
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:29,777
No, ma'am.

101
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:33,537
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

102
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:38,541
- Do you have a family, Mr Creasy?
- No.

103
00:11:39,062 --> 00:11:41,451
Pita? Pita.

104
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:47,935
- Yes, Mom?
- Honey, this is Mr Creasy.

105
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:52,775
Buenas tardes, señor Creasy.
Mucho gusto en conocerle.

106
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:57,652
It's English, honey. Do you wanna
show Mr Creasy to his room?

107
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:00,097
- This way, Mr Creasy.
- OK.

108
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,538
Thank you.

109
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,461
Just like that?

110
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:25,697
I think it's nice that he's an American.

111
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:29,855
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?

112
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,179
Thank you.

113
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,060
Thank you.

114
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:39,053
I feel better now.

115
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:44,096
- !Hola, Bruno!
- Buenas tardes.

116
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:48,653
That's Bruno, the gardener.
And that's Maria, the cook.

117
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:51,495
- !Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.

118
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:57,535
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

119
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:04,250
You've got a TV and a CD player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr Creasy?

120
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:07,857
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

121
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:10,695
I don't know.

122
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:15,173
That's Bird. Emilio forgot
to take him when he left.

123
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,457
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

124
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:24,415
Have you protected
a lot of children before, Mr Creasy?

125
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:28,097
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

126
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,934
Creasy.

127
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:32,217
Bye, Creasy.

128
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,459
Bye, Bird.

129
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:50,617
- School tomorrow, Peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

130
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,057
Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.

131
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:55,212
Yeah, we'll see.

132
00:13:55,302 --> 00:14:00,092
Ifyou get a dog, will you give up your bear?
You're getting too old for him.

133
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:08,340
- How did you like Mr Creasy?
- Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.

134
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:12,301
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?
- No, not if he asked you.

135
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:15,180
Here. There you go.

136
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:24,698
He's like a bear, too.

137
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,658
- Yeah?
- A big, sad bear.

138
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:33,696
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

139
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:39,973
Good night, honey.

140
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,496
Can you get me some floss in the morning?

141
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,459
- Floss?
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.

142
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,294
Sure.

143
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,213
Good night, Bear.

144
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:56,213
Creasy Bear.

145
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:32,494
- What's that one for?
- La Virgen de Guadalupe.

146
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:36,257
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

147
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:41,621
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one. I don't know.

148
00:15:43,822 --> 00:15:45,813
She likes him.

149
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:49,654
- What are you talkin' about?
- Creasy.

150
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:53,093
Pita likes him.

151
00:15:54,542 --> 00:16:00,651
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count
Dracula if he took her back there, honey.

152
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,539
OK?

153
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,936
Hey. Are you OK?

154
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:09,377
- I don't know.
- OK?

155
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:15,137
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.

156
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:10,939
Come on, Bird.

157
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,855
That's right, that's right. Come on.

158
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:15,614
All right.

159
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,533
Home to Emilio.

160
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:20,373
You're home free, baby.

161
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:42,295
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The US.

162
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:45,215
- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.

163
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:52,652
- You can drive and talk at the same time.
- No, I can't, Pita, so please let me do myjob.

164
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:54,380
Are you going to stay?

165
00:17:55,742 --> 00:18:00,372
My last bodyguard left. Somebody
gave him more money than we could.

166
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:04,250
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?

167
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:09,291
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

168
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:11,498
Time will tell.

169
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:17,901
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
in the last six days.

170
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:20,450
- Four a day.
- Yeah? 24?

171
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:24,171
- 24. What do you think about that?
- I think you know more than you should.

172
00:18:24,262 --> 00:18:26,014
Well, thank you.

173
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:55,821
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

174
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:59,133
- What?
- You have to sign in. Show them your ID.

175
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,213
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

176
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:02,576
Come on.

177
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:05,454
Right there.

178
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,136
- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.

179
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:20,302
- !Hola, Pita!
- !Hola!

180
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,018
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

181
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:27,299
Sister Anna,
this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.

182
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,295
- Sister Anna, the headmistress.
- Señor Creasy.

183
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:36,700
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

184
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:37,851
Madre.

185
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:41,378
You must look after our Pita.
It is not good that she is late today.

186
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:45,740
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to
the routes. It won't happen again.

187
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:49,417
No offence, but I regret that
your profession needs to exist.

188
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,460
So do l, Madre, so do l.

189
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:56,137
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

190
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,733
No, not for a long time.

191
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:02,575
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..."

192
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:06,701
"But overcome evil with good."

193
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:09,535
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.

194
00:20:12,382 --> 00:20:15,294
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.

195
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:20,260
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

196
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,617
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

197
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:26,456
No, I don't remember.
No, I didn't like it.

198
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,737
Why not?

199
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:33,134
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita.
There was no Sister Anna.

200
00:21:35,702 --> 00:21:37,977
Were you unhappy?

201
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:43,332
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

202
00:21:52,342 --> 00:21:54,617
What happened to your hand?

203
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:57,660
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

204
00:21:57,742 --> 00:21:59,175
Look, no more questions, OK?

205
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:05,651
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question to me.

206
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:09,052
No, gracias. Gracias, no, no.

207
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,417
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you.

208
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:12,491
No, no, no.

209
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,972
I'm being paid to be your bodyguard.
Look at me.

210
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:22,577
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but
to protect you. So no more questions, period.

211
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:25,975
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

212
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:31,176
- No crying.
- I'm not crying.

213
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:34,218
Well, don't start.

214
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:37,658
You gotta understand, this is ajob.
In order for me to do myjob...

215
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:42,417
Wait a minute.

216
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,733
Yeah, come in.

217
00:23:36,102 --> 00:23:38,093
Mr Creasy.

218
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:41,615
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

219
00:23:41,702 --> 00:23:43,101
I'm fine, thanks.

220
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:48,974
Is the food all right?
Because Maria told me you didn't eat.

221
00:23:50,502 --> 00:23:55,053
Yeah, the food is great.
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

222
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:59,982
So you read the Bible?

223
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:03,421
Yeah, sometimes.

224
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,538
Does it help?

225
00:24:05,622 --> 00:24:07,260
Yeah, sometimes.

226
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:12,494
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

227
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:17,255
How are you doing with Pita?

228
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:18,855
Fine.

229
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:22,332
As soon as she figures out that
I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.

230
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:24,811
- She told me about that.
- OK.

231
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:29,533
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

232
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:32,455
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

233
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:35,056
And Pitajust wants to be friends.

234
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,734
OK.

235
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:42,101
But you're paying me to protect her,
not to be her friend, right?

236
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,533
So...

237
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:49,171
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

238
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:54,256
Maybe your husband should find
somebody that's a little more sociable.

239
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:57,861
No, you're right.

240
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:02,941
You're being paid to protect her.

241
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:06,412
And I'm confident that you'll do that.

242
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:15,492
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

243
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:46,499
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

244
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,890
I'm tired of killin', Ray.
I'm tired of killin', Ray.

245
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:22,020
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

246
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,218
In my state, I couldn't...

247
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:26,338
I couldn't guard a corpse.

248
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:28,333
They talk all the time.

249
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:31,141
You know I'm no good at that.

250
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:34,221
You know I'm no good at that.

251
00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:37,134
You know how they say...

252
00:26:38,862 --> 00:26:41,740
a bullet always tells the truth?

253
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,980
Yeah?

254
00:27:23,062 --> 00:27:25,212
- Hey.
- Crease.

255
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:26,894
What's wrong?

256
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:32,818
Hey, listen, you ever have
a 9mm round that didn't go off?

257
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,416
Yeah. Failure to fire.

258
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:38,539
I know, failure to fire and...

259
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:43,457
You know, I pulled the trigger
and click - nothing.

260
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:47,820
- You're talkin' about a bad primer.
- Yeah, yeah, but l...

261
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:52,453
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer.
That may be...

262
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,817
Well, like we used to say...

263
00:27:56,102 --> 00:27:58,775
a bullet always tells the truth.

264
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:08,335
Crease? You all right?

265
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:10,094
Yeah.

266
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:13,411
What were you shootin' at?

267
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:15,697
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.

268
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:19,661
No, it's OK, it's nothin'. I was watchin' TV.

269
00:28:21,462 --> 00:28:23,453
OK.

270
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:42,336
Pita, you have a pencil?

271
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:48,214
Thank you.

272
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:25,252
- It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.
- Yeah. I'm very sorry.

273
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:47,098
- See you, baby.
- See you later.

274
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:51,334
- Hey, don't forget your towel.
- Thank you.

275
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,419
Bye.

276
00:32:01,382 --> 00:32:04,215
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

277
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:11,699
Thanks.

278
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:17,456
So, what do I do?

279
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:20,898
You're the fastest in the water,
the slowest offthe blocks.

280
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,257
What do you think that means?
What you gotta do?

281
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:26,334
- Get faster offthe blocks?
- Get faster offthe blocks.

282
00:32:27,302 --> 00:32:29,611
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

283
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:35,220
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- You'll be fine. You'll be OK.

284
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:39,137
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

285
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:44,216
- I never finish better than third.
- Then maybe you are slow.

286
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:49,933
With us this evening we have
Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper

287
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:52,297
to speak with us about the kidnappings.

288
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:56,499
Who are the ones responsible
for the kidnappings in Mexico?

289
00:32:56,582 --> 00:33:00,177
It is an activity of organised crime.
It's not a random kidnapping.

290
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:02,378
They are not political kidnappings
like in Colombia.

291
00:33:02,462 --> 00:33:04,612
!Vamos, Bird!

292
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:06,693
!Vamos!

293
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:14,776
How do you think he got out?

294
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:17,661
I let him go.

295
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:21,257
- It's better to be free, right?
- It's better for him.

296
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:25,735
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

297
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:31,013
Good night.

298
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:37,694
Good night.

299
00:33:52,302 --> 00:33:55,100
- See you in a couple of days, OK? I love you.
- Love you.

300
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:56,979
Be good. Come on, Lise.

301
00:33:57,062 --> 00:34:00,418
All right, sweetheart,
so we'll call you from Detroit, OK?

302
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,292
- I love you.
- Love you.

303
00:34:03,382 --> 00:34:05,418
- OK, bye.
- Señora, su café.

304
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,413
Gracias.

305
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:11,700
- OK, bye, honey. I love you!
- Love you.

306
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,294
I hate leaving her.

307
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,452
Concentrating?

308
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,533
Eyes are closed?

309
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:41,340
- What happened?
- I flinched.

310
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:43,731
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

311
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:47,098
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!

312
00:34:47,182 --> 00:34:48,820
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

313
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:51,052
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

314
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:54,612
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good. You welcome the sound.

315
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,738
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

316
00:34:56,822 --> 00:35:01,020
You are a prisoner on this block until
that sound sets you free. Are you ready?

317
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,696
- Yes.
- Are you ready? Are you set?

318
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,413
Creasy?

319
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,732
What's a concubine?

320
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,973
- Why do you ask?
- It's in my history book.

321
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:23,611
- It's like a wife, right?
- Yeah, yeah, it's...

322
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,977
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.

323
00:35:26,062 --> 00:35:27,381
Right there.

324
00:35:27,462 --> 00:35:30,613
But the Emperor of China had 1,000 ofthem.

325
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:36,130
OK, like nowadays, in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

326
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:42,695
But in the olden-time cultures they had,
you know, different... different rules.

327
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,413
Why? You feel sorry for the husband?

328
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:50,575
Yeah. Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

329
00:35:52,022 --> 00:35:54,377
Creasy.

330
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:56,976
- You're smiling.
- What?

331
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:59,212
- You were smiling.
- No, I'm not.

332
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:00,496
- You were.
- No, I was not.

333
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:03,221
- You're not now, but you were.
- Youwere smiling. I wasn't.

334
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:04,655
- You were.
- When?

335
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,176
- Five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

336
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:11,778
- Well, a second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

337
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:13,978
- Ten seconds ago.
- Ten seconds ago I was smiling.

338
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:17,975
OK, in the next ten seconds,
we'll see who smiles first.

339
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:23,691
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- You.

340
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,171
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.

341
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:31,734
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They
both start with S, but they're not the same...

342
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,495
- Do your homework.
- You were.

343
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:39,219
Bang!

344
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:42,702
Stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

345
00:36:42,782 --> 00:36:44,010
Bang!

346
00:36:45,582 --> 00:36:47,413
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

347
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,778
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.

348
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:52,454
Set.

349
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,931
Bang! Bang!

350
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:02,180
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

351
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:07,256
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate.
Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?

352
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:09,333
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!

353
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:13,620
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.

354
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:32,092
?Yqué? ?Todo bien?
Las maletas, porfavor.

355
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:33,615
- Daddy!
- Come here, girl.

356
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:38,054
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

357
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:41,214
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?

358
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:43,733
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!

359
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:47,180
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh!
- What do you think?

360
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:50,618
Oh, my gosh.
Just what I wanted. What's his name?

361
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,580
- Sam. Like Dad.
- Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!

362
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:57,133
State...

363
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:02,255
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.

364
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:05,778
They were having some problems
with the royal family not long ago.

365
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:07,500
OK.

366
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,657
Any more questions?

367
00:38:11,742 --> 00:38:16,816
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
- What? No. What kind of question is that?

368
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:20,053
- You're supposed to be studying history.
- It's Creasy history.

369
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:22,940
- No, ancient history.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

370
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,091
- Nonya.
- Nonya?

371
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:27,492
Nonya business, that's who. OK?

372
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,059
Hi.

373
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:33,691
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

374
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:35,773
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:38,740
All right. Well, I'll...

376
00:38:38,822 --> 00:38:41,416
I'll leave you to your history.

377
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:44,300
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

378
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:49,010
- OK, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

379
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:58,100
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!

380
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,093
!Ràpido!!Ràpido!

381
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:02,571
Go, go, go, go, go!

382
00:39:02,662 --> 00:39:04,937
!Bravo, Pita!

383
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:08,292
- 10.99.
- Yes!

384
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,930
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

385
00:39:14,022 --> 00:39:17,253
There's trained and there's untrained.
Now, which are you?

386
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:20,652
- Trained.
- Trained. OK, we'll go again.

387
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:30,653
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

388
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:32,300
OK. Hey.

389
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:35,454
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

390
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:39,296
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around
ifyou wanna win. Trained or untrained?

391
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:40,974
- Trained.
- Go.

392
00:39:41,982 --> 00:39:46,498
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Good to see you, Madre.

393
00:39:46,582 --> 00:39:49,142
Pita's parents are away on business in Juàrez.

394
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:51,782
Today, you are her father.

395
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,610
!Yla ganadora es Pita Ramos!

396
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,099
I won, Creasy! I won!

397
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:24,571
- OK.
- I won!

398
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:38,774
- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When lwas young.

399
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:41,740
Well, when we were young
and he was younger,

400
00:41:41,822 --> 00:41:44,575
and all heads turned our way,

401
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:47,176
we made a deal to take the world together.

402
00:41:47,262 --> 00:41:51,050
Yeah, then one day I got a call,
and you said...

403
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:54,418
"I'm in love, I'm in love!"

404
00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:56,857
"And I'm movin' to Mexico!"

405
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:59,376
And I said, "Huh?"

406
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:02,852
I said, "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

407
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:07,572
- I said, "The plan's right here!"
- Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?

408
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:09,892
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.

409
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:14,100
And then I went, "Now I got ya. I got ya."

410
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:16,855
I got it. Can I kiss her?

411
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:18,853
Absolutely.

412
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:21,581
Hey, what are you doin'?

413
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:30,378
- You got me.
- OK, I think now's as good a time as any.

414
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:35,741
I bought it with my own money.

415
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:39,573
Thank you.

416
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:43,093
Open it.

417
00:42:47,262 --> 00:42:51,653
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.

418
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:57,213
Well deserved.

419
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:03,775
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

420
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,173
You're welcome.

421
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:56,458
- Dad?
- Yes, sweetie?

422
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:59,010
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

423
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:03,494
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.

424
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:07,734
It's not open for discussion, honey, OK?
Mr Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.

425
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:11,974
If he accepts you as a student,
you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.

426
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:13,939
- Whatever.
- Baby.

427
00:44:16,382 --> 00:44:18,896
- I love you.
- Love you.

428
00:44:18,982 --> 00:44:22,099
- I just want what's best for you, you know?
- OK.

429
00:44:22,182 --> 00:44:24,332
OK, honey.

430
00:44:34,102 --> 00:44:36,775
Ifyou broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together,

431
00:44:36,862 --> 00:44:39,615
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

432
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:41,897
Sam, get back.

433
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,860
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

434
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:46,933
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

435
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,496
Remember the day you wanted the pencil?

436
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:55,619
- Yeah.
- I know why.

437
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:57,181
Yeah?

438
00:44:57,262 --> 00:45:01,733
You wanted the licence number off ofthat car.
I wrote it down in my notebook.

439
00:45:01,822 --> 00:45:04,382
I got it all but the last number.

440
00:45:04,462 --> 00:45:07,579
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?

441
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:09,812
Like burp. Can you burp?

442
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:18,339
- That's good. That's very good.
- I just had a Coke.

443
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:20,697
Listen to me. This famous teacher...

444
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:24,695
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays
for the symphonies and all that, right?

445
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:27,342
Belch every few minutes
while you're practising.

446
00:45:27,422 --> 00:45:32,052
You apologise to him, but you keep belching.
You'll offend every sensibility he has.

447
00:45:32,142 --> 00:45:35,691
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

448
00:45:35,782 --> 00:45:37,773
Right, Sam?

449
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:46,537
- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos.

450
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:51,652
For you, Creasy.

451
00:45:54,782 --> 00:45:56,579
Thank you.

452
00:45:59,742 --> 00:46:02,939
- How does this look?
- Good. Good.

453
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:07,014
- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.

454
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:08,139
Come on in.

455
00:46:08,222 --> 00:46:09,211
Bye.

456
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:11,293
- How long?
- One hour.

457
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:13,179
Gracias.

458
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:41,534
Pita...

459
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:52,734
!Pita! Porfavor, concéntrate.

460
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:12,817
Pita!

461
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:16,292
Pita!

462
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:24,934
No te vas a callar.

463
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,938
Pita!

464
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:38,134
Run!

465
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:55,977
Creasy!

466
00:49:56,062 --> 00:49:57,973
Creasy!

467
00:50:00,022 --> 00:50:02,172
Creasy. Creasy!

468
00:50:03,022 --> 00:50:05,058
Creasy!

469
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:18,421
I can't...

470
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:45,098
John W Creasy is under arrest for the murder
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police.

471
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:47,776
Creasy!

472
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:59,537
This man, John W Creasy,

473
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,180
an American citizen,

474
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:02,980
is under arrest for the murder

475
00:51:03,222 --> 00:51:05,577
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police

476
00:51:08,142 --> 00:51:10,702
and is suspected of possible involvement

477
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:13,421
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.

478
00:51:15,502 --> 00:51:18,062
Chief Ramirez...

479
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:22,576
The two officers who were killed.

480
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,937
Records show they were off duty at the time.

481
00:51:25,622 --> 00:51:28,011
So why were they in uniform

482
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,212
and in a patrol car?

483
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:32,897
All I know is that they died bravely.

484
00:51:33,822 --> 00:51:35,016
Of course,

485
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:37,696
but what exactly were they doing

486
00:51:37,782 --> 00:51:39,135
at the scene ofthe kidnapping?

487
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:42,814
Or were they known
for their exceptional good luck?

488
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:44,813
They were known for being corrupt

489
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:47,257
and now are celebrated for being dead.

490
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:44,257
Excuse me.

491
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:51,812
Relax, OK? Relax, Sammy.

492
00:52:57,062 --> 00:53:00,418
I know she's your little girl. When I
tell you everything's gonna be all right,

493
00:53:00,502 --> 00:53:03,062
everything's gonna be all right.

494
00:53:04,662 --> 00:53:06,937
Señor Ramos.

495
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:17,090
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

496
00:53:17,182 --> 00:53:20,811
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policia Judicial.

497
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:24,372
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

498
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:29,616
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

499
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:34,332
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and we
neither need nor want any police assistance.

500
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:37,971
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

501
00:53:38,702 --> 00:53:44,937
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed
during your daughter's abduction.

502
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,820
I have a written order from...

503
00:53:47,982 --> 00:53:49,859
the Public Minister...

504
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,013
authorising our participation...

505
00:53:52,102 --> 00:53:54,616
..."unofficially".

506
00:53:55,622 --> 00:54:00,218
Ifyou want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

507
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:03,900
OK.

508
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:08,214
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

509
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:10,779
Porfavor, don't do that.

510
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:16,334
Or you will find yourself in a real
Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...

511
00:54:16,422 --> 00:54:18,413
and no Pita.

512
00:54:56,022 --> 00:54:57,011
Crease?

513
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:00,011
Crease.

514
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:06,377
When I heard it was this hospital,
I was so pleased.

515
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:09,898
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.

516
00:55:09,982 --> 00:55:14,021
They have the best pastries in Mexico.

517
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:17,890
Miguel Manzano. Director ofthe AFl.

518
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:23,852
And a former director of lnterpol, in Rome.

519
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:28,173
- And you are?
- A friend of his. Rayburn.

520
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:30,014
Rayburn.

521
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:44,735
?Hola?

522
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:47,456
Do you love your daughter, señor Ramos?

523
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,578
Yes. Yes.

524
00:55:49,662 --> 00:55:52,734
- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.

525
00:55:52,822 --> 00:55:54,096
Señor...

526
00:55:55,062 --> 00:55:59,772
Ifyour daughter's life is
as important to you as it is to me,

527
00:55:59,862 --> 00:56:02,092
you will do as I say.

528
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,138
Yes?

529
00:56:04,222 --> 00:56:05,701
OK, yes.

530
00:56:06,342 --> 00:56:08,378
Crease. You hear me?

531
00:56:11,742 --> 00:56:13,892
You got four of 'em, all dead.

532
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,580
- Pita?
- It's...

533
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:22,896
It's been two days.

534
00:56:22,982 --> 00:56:25,701
They're negotiating a ransom.

535
00:56:27,102 --> 00:56:30,572
These things take time, Mr Creasy.

536
00:56:34,982 --> 00:56:36,540
Crease.

537
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:41,460
Don't fuck with me, all right?

538
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:50,058
You have the ten million?
Do you have the money?

539
00:56:50,142 --> 00:56:53,771
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now, ifyou do as I say,

540
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:58,060
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

541
00:56:58,142 --> 00:57:02,101
But ifyou deviate
from the process in any way...

542
00:57:02,662 --> 00:57:04,573
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,

543
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:07,051
I swear you will never see her again.

544
00:57:07,142 --> 00:57:10,134
I understand. Listen, I too
worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...

545
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,178
I ask ifyou understand.

546
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:18,019
Hello, sir. This is Mr Ramos's attorney.

547
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,935
He's going through a very difficult time,
but he understands.

548
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:24,253
Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.

549
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:29,291
OK, the money, ten million US, will be divided
into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,

550
00:57:29,382 --> 00:57:33,534
each containing five million, which
will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,

551
00:57:33,622 --> 00:57:38,059
then driven to the house in an armoured car,
where it will be transferred to the delivery car.

552
00:57:38,862 --> 00:57:41,535
You got a flat tyre here.

553
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:43,613
This is for you.

554
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,937
Hello. Yeah.

555
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:49,490
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

556
00:57:49,582 --> 00:57:51,732
No. Why?

557
00:57:51,822 --> 00:57:55,497
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

558
00:57:55,582 --> 00:57:58,654
Look, he's a nervous kid.
He doesn't respond well to stress.

559
00:58:00,702 --> 00:58:05,173
All right, but the car will not be powerful.

560
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:10,131
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

561
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,537
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1am.

562
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:18,615
You will drive around the circle two times.

563
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:23,412
Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

564
00:58:23,502 --> 00:58:26,335
to ID the car.

565
00:58:27,382 --> 00:58:30,977
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.

566
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:36,659
The phone will ring.
You will answer and wait for instructions.

567
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:41,452
There is a map on the top
ofthe phone. Follow it.

568
00:58:43,382 --> 00:58:45,213
Perfecto.

569
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:47,691
Tranquilo. Si.

570
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:51,940
- What are you doing? He said no phones.
- Relax, relax.

571
00:58:52,022 --> 00:58:55,697
I'm just trying to protect your daughter, OK?

572
00:59:00,422 --> 00:59:01,537
What's goin' on?

573
00:59:01,862 --> 00:59:04,581
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,

574
00:59:04,662 --> 00:59:08,450
especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

575
00:59:20,342 --> 00:59:24,130
Leave the money in the trunk ofthe white car

576
00:59:24,222 --> 00:59:26,213
and return to your car.

577
00:59:27,942 --> 00:59:31,139
Do not look back.

578
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:41,214
What's going on, guys?

579
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:42,815
Ambush!

580
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:52,337
Remember... I'm a professional.

581
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:59,937
Ifyou keep your word, I will keep mine.

582
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:10,972
- Hello?
- Mr Ramos.

583
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:14,452
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.

584
01:00:15,062 --> 01:00:16,620
You took my money.

585
01:00:16,702 --> 01:00:18,613
Señor Ramos...

586
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,535
God be with your child.

587
01:00:23,382 --> 01:00:28,058
All right. Get outta here, all ofyou.
Get the fuck out of my house!

588
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:30,337
OK, this is Lisa...

589
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:33,855
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.

590
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:39,978
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

591
01:00:40,062 --> 01:00:43,020
Please don't harm my daughter.

592
01:00:44,662 --> 01:00:47,415
This conversation is not being recorded.

593
01:00:47,502 --> 01:00:49,777
You're negotiating directly with me.

594
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:55,255
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, señora.

595
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:57,936
I'm really sorry.

596
01:00:58,622 --> 01:01:00,613
Now it is too late.

597
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:14,333
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house! Now!

598
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:17,981
Get out! Get out!

599
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:07,218
Hey, Ray. How are you...?

600
01:02:09,465 --> 01:02:13,094
- Where am l?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

601
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:20,655
Manzano was afraid
the cops were gonna kill ya.

602
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:23,656
How you doin', doc?

603
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:30,496
What's the matter?

604
01:02:33,585 --> 01:02:35,780
She's dead, Crease.

605
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:42,541
It's a mess. Somebody
hijacked the drop and...

606
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:50,537
The kidnapper's nephew was killed,
so he killed Pita.

607
01:03:02,465 --> 01:03:05,935
He has gunshot wounds
to the chest and the abdomen.

608
01:03:06,305 --> 01:03:08,216
He has a collapsed lung
which we've re-inflated.

609
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:12,344
He's lucky to be alive.
If he doesn't rest, he will die.

610
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:16,498
How long will he be hospitalised?

611
01:03:16,585 --> 01:03:18,416
Approximately a month.

612
01:03:20,825 --> 01:03:22,656
No.

613
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:31,982
No.

614
01:03:36,825 --> 01:03:39,897
Did you recognise any ofthese men?

615
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:45,422
No. Does that make me a suspect?

616
01:03:46,145 --> 01:03:48,022
No.

617
01:03:48,105 --> 01:03:50,096
It would be convenient, but no.

618
01:03:51,345 --> 01:03:55,258
Maybe you should show me pictures of some
Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.

619
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:57,654
Those were all policemen.

620
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:00,703
Bad Judicial cops,

621
01:04:00,785 --> 01:04:04,937
protected, by a brotherhood.

622
01:04:05,025 --> 01:04:06,856
A brotherhood?

623
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:11,980
A brotherhood, called...

624
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:29,819
You all set?

625
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:31,497
- Right arm.
- Yeah.

626
01:04:34,465 --> 01:04:36,854
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

627
01:04:36,945 --> 01:04:38,981
Let's go.

628
01:05:14,145 --> 01:05:16,215
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah.

629
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:18,737
Lois Lane.

630
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:22,582
Mariana something, works for Reforma.

631
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,779
Newspaperjournalist.

632
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:28,982
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.

633
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,183
I'll get you up to the border.

634
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:35,575
A friend will take you to San Diego,
drop you at the Naval Hospital.

635
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,974
I'm not goin', Ray.

636
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:40,454
What are you gonna do?

637
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:44,060
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

638
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:54,816
Buenos dias.

639
01:06:52,345 --> 01:06:54,575
Mr Creasy?

640
01:06:54,665 --> 01:06:57,304
A lot of people are looking for you.

641
01:06:58,345 --> 01:07:00,813
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

642
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,980
Reporter, for Reforma.

643
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:08,820
Nice to meet you.

644
01:07:08,905 --> 01:07:10,782
I found this across the street.

645
01:07:14,305 --> 01:07:15,863
Open it.

646
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:21,979
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

647
01:07:25,785 --> 01:07:29,175
- They've put a curse on you.
- A little late.

648
01:07:33,025 --> 01:07:37,177
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

649
01:07:40,225 --> 01:07:42,500
I can help you.

650
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:48,344
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.

651
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:52,134
It protects government officials,
corrupt police and organised crime

652
01:07:52,225 --> 01:07:56,537
at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.

653
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,104
OK.

654
01:07:58,185 --> 01:08:03,657
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims ofthis organisation.

655
01:08:03,745 --> 01:08:10,014
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me
your story, and then I can help you. Please.

656
01:08:14,385 --> 01:08:16,580
Help me do what?

657
01:08:17,505 --> 01:08:20,497
You're gonna help me do what?

658
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,695
- You're a stranger here, no?
- That's right.

659
01:08:24,785 --> 01:08:28,983
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

660
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:31,056
OK.

661
01:08:31,145 --> 01:08:33,579
OK, friend that's gonna help me.

662
01:08:35,865 --> 01:08:37,901
Pleasure to meet you.

663
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:42,263
Tell your driver to keep his distance
next time. All right, friend?

664
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:47,296
Si.

665
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:07,463
- You'll be Stateside by supper time.
- I'm gonna need some help first, though.

666
01:09:07,545 --> 01:09:10,503
You don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day in your shape.

667
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:14,544
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah! But...

668
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,661
- I'm done killing. I told you that.
- OK.

669
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:18,622
Anything else is yours.

670
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:29,176
- You're talkin' about war, Crease.
- Exactly. Can you help me?

671
01:09:31,945 --> 01:09:33,742
- Yeah.
- Good.

672
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:47,536
Creasy?

673
01:11:39,745 --> 01:11:42,213
What are you doin' here?

674
01:11:49,425 --> 01:11:51,734
I came to get my stuff.

675
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:55,135
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

676
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:58,615
- I borrowed it.
- OK.

677
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,942
It's crazy, huh?

678
01:12:02,825 --> 01:12:07,182
One week we're figuring out which
nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm...

679
01:12:07,265 --> 01:12:09,301
readin' the Bible.

680
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:11,945
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.

681
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:20,935
I keep thinkin' if only we hadn't...

682
01:12:23,745 --> 01:12:25,736
It's like...

683
01:12:27,785 --> 01:12:33,974
My whole life all I've ever thought about
was what I could get for myself.

684
01:12:34,065 --> 01:12:36,863
Not my own baby.

685
01:12:39,145 --> 01:12:46,415
She needed me so much, and sometimes
I felt like I had nothin' to give her.

686
01:12:46,505 --> 01:12:49,383
Just... I don't know what to do.

687
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:55,301
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.

688
01:12:55,385 --> 01:12:57,376
I'm gonna kill 'em.

689
01:12:58,345 --> 01:13:04,784
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

690
01:13:04,865 --> 01:13:06,696
You kill 'em all.

691
01:13:34,745 --> 01:13:36,736
Yla Browning.

693
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:14,936

- Yeah, it's me.

696
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:25,174
- Mr Creasy.
- I need the licence... No, excuse me.

697
01:14:25,265 --> 01:14:30,134
I need the name and address of someone
whose licence number is C5TK8.

698
01:14:30,225 --> 01:14:33,900
That's C5TK8.

699
01:14:33,985 --> 01:14:37,898
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need ten possible matches.

700
01:14:37,985 --> 01:14:40,215
And when do I find out which ofthe ten it is?

701
01:14:40,305 --> 01:14:42,978
- Eventually.
- But where do I reach you?

702
01:14:43,065 --> 01:14:45,056
I'll call you.

703
01:14:50,225 --> 01:14:54,855
AGENCY FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

704
01:14:55,705 --> 01:14:57,184
Do you know who he is?

705
01:14:57,265 --> 01:15:00,018
Do you know what he's been doing
the last 16 years?

706
01:15:00,825 --> 01:15:02,338
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,

Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all ofthat.

709
01:15:06,345 --> 01:15:07,573
He's an assassin...

710
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:11,704
and you want to help him identify
the owner of a car for him?

711
01:15:12,305 --> 01:15:15,502
He can go places we can't.

712
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:19,303
Ifyou don't want to use him... I will.

713
01:15:21,825 --> 01:15:23,975
- Mariana...
- ?Si?

714
01:15:24,065 --> 01:15:26,260
When do I get to sleep with you again?

715
01:15:26,345 --> 01:15:27,858
We never sleep. We fuck.

716
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:29,583
Give it to me.

717
01:15:30,545 --> 01:15:32,615
Give it to me.

718
01:15:32,705 --> 01:15:34,980
Gracias.

719
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,258
Ciao.

720
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,454
Maneja.

721
01:16:11,545 --> 01:16:13,217
Jorge Gonzàlez.

722
01:16:14,745 --> 01:16:16,303
I'm a Judicial Policeman.

723
01:16:16,745 --> 01:16:19,703
Drive.

724
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:22,060
OK. Maneja.

725
01:16:46,145 --> 01:16:48,340
What are you gonna do?

726
01:16:48,425 --> 01:16:50,734
What I do best.

727
01:16:52,385 --> 01:16:56,378
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

728
01:16:56,465 --> 01:16:58,456
I'm gonna kill 'em.

729
01:17:40,345 --> 01:17:41,255
Can you hear me?

730
01:17:41,585 --> 01:17:42,654
My head hurts.

731
01:17:46,505 --> 01:17:48,223
I am going to ask questions.

732
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,621
Ifyou don't answer fully and truthfully,

733
01:17:52,705 --> 01:17:55,014
you will suffer much more than you have to.

734
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,980
I'm going to cut your fingers off.

735
01:18:03,585 --> 01:18:06,179
One by one, if I have to.

736
01:18:07,185 --> 01:18:09,255
This is to stop the bleeding.

737
01:18:10,545 --> 01:18:12,581
OK? Ahora.

738
01:18:12,665 --> 01:18:14,895
Don't mess with me.

739
01:18:14,985 --> 01:18:17,101
?Sabes quién soyyo?

740
01:18:17,185 --> 01:18:19,858
You know who I am?

741
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:23,693
A member of La Hermandad.

742
01:18:24,905 --> 01:18:27,544
- ?Correcto?
- Correct.

743
01:18:28,025 --> 01:18:29,253
OK.

744
01:18:38,825 --> 01:18:42,784
!No mames!
!No me quemes, pendejo de mierda!

745
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:43,980
!Suelta!

746
01:18:51,665 --> 01:18:56,056
- Chinga a tu madre, pinche pendejo.
- Yeah. Ytù. Ytù.

747
01:18:59,385 --> 01:19:04,413
What do you want to know?

748
01:19:05,225 --> 01:19:06,544
The Ramos kidnapping...

749
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:11,575
What went wrong at the drop?

750
01:19:12,945 --> 01:19:14,697
No sé nada.

751
01:19:14,785 --> 01:19:17,458
We were just ordered to take her.

752
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:19,937
That's all we did.

753
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:21,861
Ordered by who?

754
01:19:22,185 --> 01:19:23,413
I don't know.

755
01:19:23,745 --> 01:19:25,975
You don't know?

756
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:29,182
!No sé!!No sé!

757
01:19:31,385 --> 01:19:32,613
!No sé!!No sé!

758
01:19:32,705 --> 01:19:33,979
We work in separate groups.

759
01:19:34,065 --> 01:19:35,100
A voice calls.

760
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:36,254
We grab the target

761
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:39,303
and deliver it to the guardians.

762
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,617
The bosses never see the target,

763
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:46,458
theyjust make the deal.

764
01:19:46,545 --> 01:19:48,615
!Eso es todo!

765
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:50,900
Who ordered it?

766
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:56,740
We call him "The Voice".

767
01:19:57,265 --> 01:19:58,744
"The Voice." OK.

768
01:19:59,305 --> 01:20:00,420
"The Voice", si.

769
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:03,064
The Voice.

770
01:20:04,585 --> 01:20:05,859
The Voice. How do I find him?

771
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:14,061
You don't know?

772
01:20:15,105 --> 01:20:16,902
Are you sure?

773
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:24,583
OK.

774
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:27,576
OK.

775
01:20:29,665 --> 01:20:32,737
I believe you.

776
01:20:44,065 --> 01:20:45,737
Tell me about the guardians.

777
01:20:49,705 --> 01:20:51,297
I'm a professional.

778
01:20:52,465 --> 01:20:55,025
I'm a professional. I just do myjob.

779
01:20:58,065 --> 01:21:01,102
Tell me about the guardians.

780
01:21:04,185 --> 01:21:07,063
- Guardianes.
- Guardianes, OK. Guardianes.

781
01:21:11,345 --> 01:21:12,778
You don't know?

782
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:14,856
I don't know.

783
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:19,855
!No me mates, cabron!

784
01:21:19,945 --> 01:21:22,698
!Ya déjame en paz, cabron!

785
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,814
He works the door at a rave in Neza.

786
01:21:29,905 --> 01:21:30,894
He has a mark

787
01:21:30,985 --> 01:21:32,862
on the left side of his face.

788
01:21:32,945 --> 01:21:35,220
They call him "The Butcher".

789
01:21:36,385 --> 01:21:37,420
Is he La Hermandad?

790
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:40,020
Yes, La Hermandad.

791
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:44,459
OK.

792
01:21:44,545 --> 01:21:47,013
Wait, wait, wait.

793
01:21:48,185 --> 01:21:50,221
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?

794
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:52,535
Si.

795
01:21:53,545 --> 01:21:55,740
OK.

796
01:21:57,665 --> 01:21:59,781
?Bueno?

797
01:22:01,305 --> 01:22:02,738
OK, my friend.

798
01:22:03,865 --> 01:22:06,538
It's offto the next life for you.

799
01:22:07,865 --> 01:22:10,857
I guarantee you won't be lonely.

800
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:37,540
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

801
01:23:21,865 --> 01:23:24,584
The Rave - Neza

802
01:24:09,305 --> 01:24:11,375
Tell me about the girl.

803
01:24:11,465 --> 01:24:12,659
I don't know her.

804
01:24:12,745 --> 01:24:14,781
- !La niña!
- No.

805
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:17,021
!Vamos!

806
01:24:49,065 --> 01:24:50,214
?Qué hay?

807
01:24:59,505 --> 01:25:01,894
OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

808
01:25:06,465 --> 01:25:08,023
Tell me about the girl.

809
01:25:12,865 --> 01:25:13,820
Do you know her?

810
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:19,497
No?

811
01:25:33,665 --> 01:25:37,783
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish

812
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:39,662

01:25:45,945 --> 01:25:48,778
Tell me how it works. The whole thing.
Tell me how it works.

817
01:25:48,865 --> 01:25:51,299
All right, everything is done by cellphone.

818
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:54,741
You just wait around for calls.
We don't even have a fuckin' number.

819
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:56,816
- Who pays you?
- We got an ATM card.

820
01:25:56,905 --> 01:26:01,774
We take out 200 fuckin' measly dollars
every two weeks.

821
01:26:03,385 --> 01:26:04,659

- You wouldn't lie to me?
- I'm not lyin'.

826
01:26:16,105 --> 01:26:18,061
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- No.

827
01:26:21,465 --> 01:26:22,420
Don't lie to me!

828
01:26:22,505 --> 01:26:26,293
- Don't lie to me! Did you kill her?
- You're makin' me fuckin' nervous.

829
01:26:26,385 --> 01:26:29,183
- Did you kill her?
- No! The fuckin' boss did, or his brother.

830
01:26:29,305 --> 01:26:31,296
Who's the boss?

831
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:34,380
- We never see his face.

Who? You never seen whose face?

Well, we were in the other room.

835
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:47,097
And he was yellin' at the girl cos his nephew
got killed and the money got stolen.

836
01:26:47,185 --> 01:26:50,655
- Wait. Somebody stole what money?

837
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:53,543
- Who stole it?

838
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,263

01:27:06,105 --> 01:27:07,777
- This Fuentes guy...

843
01:27:08,785 --> 01:27:11,094
He's a lieutenant

844
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:12,095

01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:17,503
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?

847
01:27:17,585 --> 01:27:20,145
- I just do what they tell me.
- You do what they tell you to do?

848
01:27:20,225 --> 01:27:23,103
Did you say goodbye to her?
Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?

849
01:27:23,185 --> 01:27:24,618

- You didn't?

850
01:27:24,705 --> 01:27:26,855
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye.
- Oh, shit.

851
01:27:26,945 --> 01:27:29,698
Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.

852
01:27:29,785 --> 01:27:31,662
Motherfucker, let me go!

853
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:35,784
?Hijo?

854
01:27:51,385 --> 01:27:53,535
They threw the little girl against the wall.

855
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:57,743
She wasn't moving.

856
01:27:58,865 --> 01:28:02,141
They threw her body in the trunk ofthe car,

857
01:28:03,265 --> 01:28:05,301
and then they drove away.

858
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:08,104
Who? Who? Who's they?

859
01:28:09,425 --> 01:28:11,017
The boss's brother.

860
01:28:12,545 --> 01:28:14,740
I recognised his voice.

861
01:28:15,265 --> 01:28:17,460
OK. OK.

862
01:28:20,665 --> 01:28:21,814
Now listen to me.

863
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:25,056
Ifyou tell me where to find the boss,

864
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,944
I'll let you live.

865
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:32,656
But I don't know.

866
01:28:36,585 --> 01:28:38,257
I'll give you the girl.

867
01:28:39,905 --> 01:28:41,657
I'll give you the girl.

868
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:43,814
What girl?

869
01:28:44,305 --> 01:28:45,021
The girl...

870
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:47,337
Do you want the girl?

871
01:28:47,985 --> 01:28:51,102
Yes, yes, but what girl?
What are you saying?

872
01:28:51,185 --> 01:28:52,584
- The girl.
- Here?

873
01:28:52,665 --> 01:28:53,541
Si.

874
01:28:56,225 --> 01:28:57,021
You sure?

875
01:28:57,105 --> 01:28:58,254
Si.

876
01:29:00,385 --> 01:29:01,738
Show me.

877
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:32,535
- Si. Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.

878
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:36,618
Do you know about a young girl being
kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?

879
01:30:36,705 --> 01:30:40,539
- Yes, last night. Do you know something?
- What's her name?

880
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:42,536
Camila. Camila Valencias.

881
01:30:43,625 --> 01:30:46,662
- ?Camila? ?Se llama Camila?
- Si.

882
01:30:46,745 --> 01:30:49,054
- I got her.
- Where are you?

883
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:22,417
- Creasy, what happened?
- It's OK. Sit down, relax.

884
01:31:22,505 --> 01:31:25,178
- Camila, ?estàs bien?
- She's OK, she's OK.

885
01:31:25,265 --> 01:31:27,733
You got banking connections?

886
01:31:27,825 --> 01:31:29,736
Yes, I have connections.

887
01:31:32,305 --> 01:31:37,902
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out
who's puttin' money in that account.

888
01:31:37,985 --> 01:31:40,215
4747.

889
01:31:42,105 --> 01:31:44,255
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

890
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:48,543
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.
He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.

891
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:51,662
- Fuentes?
- Who is she?

892
01:31:51,745 --> 01:31:54,054
You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.

893
01:31:54,145 --> 01:31:56,579
What do you know about Fuentes?

894
01:31:56,665 --> 01:32:00,658
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

895
01:32:00,745 --> 01:32:06,377
Never charged. The arresting officer
couldn't testify cos he was dead.

896
01:32:06,465 --> 01:32:08,615
Was he La Hermandad?

897
01:32:08,705 --> 01:32:13,859
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a Judicial compound.

898
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:16,778
He travels by motorcade.

899
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:22,025
He's better protected
than the president of Mexico.

900
01:32:22,105 --> 01:32:24,221
He's gonna need it.
Can you take care of her?

901
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:27,103
- Yes, but how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

902
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:55,735
This is myjurisdiction.

903
01:32:57,425 --> 01:33:00,701
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

904
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:06,222
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than ten years ofyour courts and tribunals.

905
01:33:06,305 --> 01:33:08,375
Just stay out of his way.

906
01:33:08,465 --> 01:33:10,057
I plan to.

907
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:19,694
I will even help him, if I can.

908
01:33:20,865 --> 01:33:24,619
But... I'd like to understand him.

909
01:33:27,025 --> 01:33:29,175
Give me that.

910
01:33:29,265 --> 01:33:31,256
Pita Ramos...

911
01:33:32,705 --> 01:33:34,980
is a number to you.

912
01:33:35,065 --> 01:33:38,774
One more dead, but a number.

913
01:33:39,545 --> 01:33:44,175
- What was she to Creasy, then?
- She showed him it was all right to live again.

914
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:50,222
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

915
01:33:51,145 --> 01:33:56,424
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

916
01:33:56,985 --> 01:33:59,579
A man can be an artist...

917
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:04,944
at anything - food, whatever.

918
01:34:05,025 --> 01:34:09,382
It depends on how good he is at it.

919
01:34:12,345 --> 01:34:14,336
Creasy's art is death.

920
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,863
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

921
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:30,423
I don't have anything else to say.

922
01:34:54,985 --> 01:34:59,342
I need the accounts linked to this card.

923
01:35:04,225 --> 01:35:08,935
PIN number is 4747.

924
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,935
On one condition.

925
01:35:56,385 --> 01:36:00,014
I'm not here to hurt you.

926
01:36:13,105 --> 01:36:15,494
In the church, they say to forgive.

927
01:36:15,585 --> 01:36:17,860
Forgiveness is between them and God.

928
01:36:17,945 --> 01:36:20,743
It's myjob to arrange the meeting.

929
01:38:13,185 --> 01:38:14,903
Don't move. Put your hands down.

930
01:38:24,425 --> 01:38:26,734
Señor John W Creasy is under arrest

931
01:38:26,825 --> 01:38:29,498
for the murder oftwo officers
ofthe Judicial Police...

932
01:38:29,585 --> 01:38:32,577
Creasy!

933
01:38:32,665 --> 01:38:34,223
Creasy!

934
01:39:06,425 --> 01:39:08,700
Can you hear me? Huh?

935
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:12,615
You know where we are?

936
01:39:13,665 --> 01:39:15,895
We're under the bridge

937
01:39:15,985 --> 01:39:20,695
where the deal went bad
and the ransom got stolen.

938
01:39:20,785 --> 01:39:22,662
You wanna tell me what happened?

939
01:39:22,745 --> 01:39:25,179
- You've heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.

940
01:39:25,265 --> 01:39:27,256
- You know what it is?
- Yes.

941
01:39:27,385 --> 01:39:29,580
I'm the president of La Hermandad.

942
01:39:29,665 --> 01:39:30,984
- You're the president?
- Yes.

943
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:33,215
The president? Wow.

944
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,376
Look at me.

945
01:39:36,465 --> 01:39:39,775
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?

946
01:39:49,425 --> 01:39:51,575
I'll show you what I got here.

947
01:39:51,665 --> 01:39:53,940
See this? This is a charger.

948
01:39:54,025 --> 01:39:56,823
It's used by convicts
to hide money and drugs.

949
01:39:56,905 --> 01:40:01,615
They stick it in their body, they tuck it
up their rectum. You familiar with that?

950
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:04,503
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.

951
01:40:04,585 --> 01:40:08,544
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.

952
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:12,457
C4. Highly explosive.

953
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:14,695
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

954
01:40:14,785 --> 01:40:19,097
Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.

955
01:40:19,185 --> 01:40:21,858
That's what you have in your ass right now.

956
01:40:21,945 --> 01:40:24,061
Don't move. Don't move.

957
01:40:24,145 --> 01:40:25,260
Don't move.

958
01:40:29,305 --> 01:40:31,421
Cheap watch, pager watch,

959
01:40:31,505 --> 01:40:37,341
used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

960
01:40:37,425 --> 01:40:38,540
So...

961
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:42,334
I'm gonna send you a page
which you will receive...

962
01:40:44,265 --> 01:40:46,779
in five minutes.

963
01:40:48,345 --> 01:40:50,017
Now...

964
01:40:54,145 --> 01:40:56,943
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down

965
01:40:57,025 --> 01:40:59,255
between your men and the kidnapper.

966
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:01,495
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

967
01:41:01,585 --> 01:41:04,657
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

968
01:41:04,745 --> 01:41:08,181
You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.

969
01:41:10,185 --> 01:41:13,939
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?

970
01:41:14,905 --> 01:41:16,577
OK.

971
01:41:17,585 --> 01:41:20,782
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

972
01:41:20,865 --> 01:41:23,538
- Relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

973
01:41:23,625 --> 01:41:25,980
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

974
01:41:26,065 --> 01:41:30,695
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.
- And?

975
01:41:30,785 --> 01:41:33,743
And I had my men ready,
as we got instructions where to go.

976
01:41:33,825 --> 01:41:38,023
You had your men ready to steal the drop,
ready to kill one ofthe kidnappers, yeah?

977
01:41:38,105 --> 01:41:39,060
You've done this many times.

978
01:41:39,465 --> 01:41:40,136
What's going on, guys?

979
01:41:42,465 --> 01:41:45,662
- One ofthe nephews ofthe head kidnapper.
- Bingo, bingo, yeah.

980
01:41:45,745 --> 01:41:47,656
You've done this many times.

981
01:41:47,745 --> 01:41:48,700
Many times, yes.

982
01:41:48,785 --> 01:41:51,982
Yeah. You've killed
many victims too, haven't you?

983
01:41:52,065 --> 01:41:56,058
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

984
01:41:57,705 --> 01:41:59,775
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

985
01:42:02,225 --> 01:42:04,341
Wait a minute.

986
01:42:04,425 --> 01:42:07,542
- Come on, I have a little gift for you.
- For me?

987
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:10,776
- Yeah, come on.
- What have you got?

988
01:42:10,865 --> 01:42:14,494
There was no $10 million.
There was two and a half in the bags.

989
01:42:14,585 --> 01:42:18,339
The ransom was $10 million.
They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.

990
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:22,577
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,

991
01:42:22,665 --> 01:42:25,020
the other only paper.

992
01:42:26,025 --> 01:42:28,175
Maybe your men stole it.

993
01:42:28,265 --> 01:42:32,304
No, no. Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

994
01:42:34,225 --> 01:42:35,624
OK.

995
01:42:35,705 --> 01:42:39,141
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,

996
01:42:39,225 --> 01:42:42,023
who put the bags into the car?

997
01:42:42,105 --> 01:42:43,982
- Guess what.
- What?

998
01:42:44,065 --> 01:42:47,137
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.

999
01:43:03,985 --> 01:43:06,624
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.

1000
01:43:06,705 --> 01:43:08,502
It was just business, you know?

1001
01:43:13,865 --> 01:43:16,379
Everybody keeps saying that to me.

1002
01:43:16,465 --> 01:43:20,856
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it.
Do you understand me?

1003
01:43:23,545 --> 01:43:25,695
What are you going to do now?

1004
01:43:25,785 --> 01:43:27,776
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.

1005
01:43:27,865 --> 01:43:30,902
Go? Hey, come on, come on.
What about me?

1006
01:43:30,985 --> 01:43:33,340
What about you? You got 40 seconds.

1007
01:43:33,425 --> 01:43:34,904
- Come on.
- 35!

1008
01:43:34,985 --> 01:43:37,453
Give me a last wish, please, please.

1009
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:40,298
Last wish? I wish...

1010
01:43:40,385 --> 01:43:43,297
you had more time.

1011
01:44:31,065 --> 01:44:34,455
JORDAN KALFUS RESIDENCE

1012
01:45:47,145 --> 01:45:48,373
?Hola?

1013
01:45:48,465 --> 01:45:51,104
- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?

1014
01:45:51,185 --> 01:45:55,019
I got something like banking codes
from Bankcoast in the Cayman lslands.

1015
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:58,336
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

1016
01:45:58,425 --> 01:45:59,938
Jordan Kalfus.

1017
01:46:00,025 --> 01:46:06,624
It looks like US deposits and withdrawals.
Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.

1018
01:46:06,705 --> 01:46:08,297
- That's it?
- That's it.

1019
01:46:09,425 --> 01:46:10,062
OK.

1020
01:46:35,385 --> 01:46:37,376
Poraqui, porfavor.

1021
01:46:54,025 --> 01:46:56,380
Creasy.

1022
01:46:56,465 --> 01:46:58,262
- Samuel.
- Honey?

1023
01:47:03,865 --> 01:47:06,095
What's goin' on?

1024
01:47:06,185 --> 01:47:08,255
That's what I wanna know.

1025
01:47:09,305 --> 01:47:10,624
What is goin' on?

1026
01:47:12,545 --> 01:47:14,536
Sam?

1027
01:47:15,785 --> 01:47:20,734
I'm gonna ask your wife
a couple of questions, OK? You move...

1028
01:47:20,825 --> 01:47:23,020
You make one sound...

1029
01:47:23,945 --> 01:47:28,814
and I'll snatch the life right out ofyou,
you understand?

1030
01:47:32,745 --> 01:47:34,815
What happened, Lisa?

1031
01:47:36,305 --> 01:47:40,457
Were you in on this,
or was itjust your husband?

1032
01:47:40,545 --> 01:47:42,422
- Am I in on what?
- You know what.

1033
01:47:42,505 --> 01:47:45,065
Pita's kidnapping, her death.
Were you a part of it?

1034
01:47:45,145 --> 01:47:48,376
- Pita got killed because the ransom...
- Shut up!

1035
01:47:49,585 --> 01:47:51,974
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right.

1036
01:47:52,065 --> 01:47:57,503
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? $2.5 million, right?

1037
01:47:57,585 --> 01:48:00,497
- What are you talkin' about?
- He knows what I'm talkin' about.

1038
01:48:00,585 --> 01:48:03,179
- That's what Victor got.
- What are you talkin' about?

1039
01:48:03,265 --> 01:48:06,940
2.5 million.
2.5 million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

1040
01:48:07,025 --> 01:48:13,180
He put it in an account in the Cayman lslands,
but he won't get a chance to spend it.

1041
01:48:13,865 --> 01:48:16,060
What happened to the other five, Sam?

1042
01:48:16,145 --> 01:48:17,737
That's 2.5, 2.5.

1043
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:20,897
What is five from ten? Five.
What happened to the other five?

1044
01:48:20,985 --> 01:48:22,737
Tell your wife. This is your chance.

1045
01:48:22,825 --> 01:48:24,736
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't.

1046
01:48:24,825 --> 01:48:27,498
You'll never know how hard it is
to tell your wife the truth.

1047
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:30,383
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

1048
01:48:30,465 --> 01:48:34,583
- It was in this room that my father...
- I don't give a fuck about your father!

1049
01:48:34,665 --> 01:48:38,419
He prayed for his gambling debts
and his infidelities to be forgiven.

1050
01:48:38,505 --> 01:48:39,824
- Samuel!
- What?

1051
01:48:39,905 --> 01:48:44,501
- I love you! Tell me the truth!
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

1052
01:48:44,585 --> 01:48:47,736
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess!

1053
01:48:47,825 --> 01:48:50,658
- Tell me what happened to my baby!
- I inherited his lawyer!

1054
01:48:50,745 --> 01:48:53,179
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1055
01:48:53,265 --> 01:48:55,825
Say it! Be a fuckin' man!

1056
01:48:59,265 --> 01:49:03,543
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room
and watch cartoons all day.

1057
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,934
And she'd eat ice cream.

1058
01:49:06,025 --> 01:49:09,620
And we'd have her back in two days.
He lied to me!

1059
01:49:09,705 --> 01:49:12,503
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!

1060
01:49:12,585 --> 01:49:14,576
I did it, Lisa!

1061
01:49:15,145 --> 01:49:17,261
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1062
01:49:17,345 --> 01:49:20,701
I did it for us. For the three of us.

1063
01:49:28,425 --> 01:49:30,416
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1064
01:49:36,545 --> 01:49:38,536
You kill him.

1065
01:49:39,945 --> 01:49:41,663
You kill him, or I will.

1066
01:50:11,585 --> 01:50:13,701
You know how they say a...

1067
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:17,983
bullet always tells the truth.

1068
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:28,576
It never lies.

1069
01:50:40,825 --> 01:50:43,703
It didn't work for me, Samuel,

1070
01:50:43,785 --> 01:50:45,776
but maybe...

1071
01:50:48,825 --> 01:50:51,703
maybe it'll work for you.

1072
01:50:59,985 --> 01:51:01,384
I'll pray for you.

1073
01:52:34,025 --> 01:52:37,222
This is definitely the address
from the ATM card.

1074
01:52:38,745 --> 01:52:42,135
The PIN number was a great locator.

1075
01:52:42,225 --> 01:52:46,696
But there's no one that sounds
anything like The Voice.

1076
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:51,093
Who's that?

1077
01:52:51,905 --> 01:52:53,179
He's the man,

1078
01:52:53,265 --> 01:52:54,664
The Voice.

1079
01:52:55,265 --> 01:52:57,415
My guys got into the house...

1080
01:52:58,825 --> 01:53:01,498
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.

1081
01:53:04,105 --> 01:53:06,300
We had to inject the whole barrio.

1082
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:12,864
We bugged the house
and stole the picture of him.

1083
01:53:21,025 --> 01:53:23,937
Now it's time to pursue him.

1084
01:53:24,945 --> 01:53:28,221
We have to put his photo in
tomorrow's newspaper.

1085
01:54:02,225 --> 01:54:05,103
Ifyou value your life,

1086
01:54:05,225 --> 01:54:08,262
you won't publish those photos.

1087
01:54:21,745 --> 01:54:23,258
- ?Hola?
- Hola.

1088
01:54:23,345 --> 01:54:26,143
- Mr Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.

1089
01:54:26,225 --> 01:54:29,297
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address.

1090
01:54:29,385 --> 01:54:30,135
Yeah?

1091
01:54:30,225 --> 01:54:33,581
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of "The Voice".

1092
01:54:33,665 --> 01:54:37,783
She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, via Appia.

1093
01:54:37,865 --> 01:54:40,220
- Good.
- And another thing.

1094
01:54:40,305 --> 01:54:42,535
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.

1095
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,024
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."

1096
01:54:44,105 --> 01:54:45,663
Good. Thank you.

1097
01:55:56,665 --> 01:55:57,495
He's in.

1098
01:55:57,585 --> 01:55:59,223
What do we do?

1099
01:55:59,785 --> 01:56:00,854
Nothing... Nothing.

1100
01:56:49,305 --> 01:56:51,216
José, ?qué te pasa?

1101
01:56:52,105 --> 01:56:53,299
Alto, alto, alto...

1102
01:56:53,825 --> 01:56:55,178
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!

1103
01:56:55,265 --> 01:56:56,618
Stop there!

1104
01:57:43,105 --> 01:57:44,743
Get out. The kids out. Now!

1105
01:57:46,905 --> 01:57:49,817
!Salgan, ahora!

1106
01:57:53,665 --> 01:57:54,859
Sit down.

1107
01:57:57,865 --> 01:57:59,298
Sit down!

1108
01:58:01,545 --> 01:58:02,739
Reina Rosas, yes?

1109
01:58:04,345 --> 01:58:06,905
- Si.
- OK.

1110
01:58:11,025 --> 01:58:14,142
Who is this? Who is this?

1111
01:58:16,985 --> 01:58:18,543
?Quién es éste?

1112
01:58:25,625 --> 01:58:27,456
?Quién es éste?

1113
01:58:27,745 --> 01:58:28,222
Daniel.

1114
01:58:28,425 --> 01:58:29,301
Daniel what?

1115
01:58:29,825 --> 01:58:30,940
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

1116
01:58:32,785 --> 01:58:35,379
The Voice?

1117
01:58:35,465 --> 01:58:38,059
- Si.
- OK.

1118
01:58:38,865 --> 01:58:40,503
And this is his brother?

1119
01:58:42,105 --> 01:58:43,936
- ?Si?
- Si.

1120
01:58:44,105 --> 01:58:45,015
What is his name?

1121
01:58:48,225 --> 01:58:49,214
What is his name?

1122
01:58:50,265 --> 01:58:50,856
Aurelio.

1123
01:58:50,945 --> 01:58:53,539
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, OK.

1124
01:58:57,945 --> 01:58:59,981
OK.

1125
01:59:06,425 --> 01:59:09,098
And you are Daniel's woman, right?

1126
01:59:09,265 --> 01:59:10,983
- Si.
- ?Si?

1127
01:59:11,065 --> 01:59:12,293
How do you contact him?

1128
01:59:14,945 --> 01:59:16,856
How do you contact him?

1129
01:59:17,145 --> 01:59:19,215
We page him,

1130
01:59:22,585 --> 01:59:24,382
and he calls back on his cellphone.

1131
01:59:27,025 --> 01:59:28,538
Call him.

1132
01:59:39,785 --> 01:59:41,741
There's no signal in here.

1133
01:59:41,825 --> 01:59:44,134
We have to go on the roof.

1134
01:59:46,665 --> 01:59:47,654
Let's go outside.

1135
01:59:56,465 --> 01:59:58,217
Outside.

1136
02:00:08,785 --> 02:00:09,934
Momento.

1137
02:00:10,025 --> 02:00:11,140
They're going to get a call.

1138
02:00:12,505 --> 02:00:14,143
Be ready to track him.

1139
02:00:15,065 --> 02:00:18,535
Ifwe're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.

1140
02:00:39,825 --> 02:00:40,974
Hola, Daniel.

1141
02:00:41,065 --> 02:00:44,375
- Señor Creasy.
- Yeah.

1142
02:00:44,465 --> 02:00:46,854
Yeah, I got your family here.

1143
02:00:46,945 --> 02:00:49,664
Your brother doesn't look too good.

1144
02:00:49,745 --> 02:00:53,658
Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months? Yeah?

1145
02:00:54,545 --> 02:00:57,013
You wanna negotiate?

1146
02:00:59,345 --> 02:01:05,500
The most important thing in life is family.
Do you agree?

1147
02:01:07,145 --> 02:01:08,464
I agree.

1148
02:01:10,105 --> 02:01:12,573
There you are, you have my family.

1149
02:01:12,665 --> 02:01:15,418
Well, most of my family.

1150
02:01:16,025 --> 02:01:19,495
My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.

1151
02:01:19,585 --> 02:01:23,214
Now, tell me seriously,
how much do you want?

1152
02:01:27,265 --> 02:01:30,621
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Here, hold on.

1153
02:01:35,705 --> 02:01:36,899
What the hell do you want?

1154
02:01:38,425 --> 02:01:40,381
Listen to me! Listen!

1155
02:01:40,465 --> 02:01:43,457
I'll take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

1156
02:01:43,545 --> 02:01:45,581
Piece by piece! Shut up!

1157
02:01:46,705 --> 02:01:49,378
I don't want your money.

1158
02:01:49,465 --> 02:01:52,218
You understand me? You understand me?

1159
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:54,773
I want you!

1160
02:02:26,145 --> 02:02:27,942
I'm listening.

1161
02:02:28,025 --> 02:02:31,495
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.

1162
02:02:37,025 --> 02:02:40,540
All right. I will give you a life for a life.

1163
02:02:42,065 --> 02:02:44,499
Whose life? What are you talkin' about?

1164
02:02:44,585 --> 02:02:47,304
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!

1165
02:02:47,905 --> 02:02:50,783
I will give you her life. For your life.

1166
02:02:50,865 --> 02:02:55,097
And in exchange, I will get my life back.

1167
02:02:55,185 --> 02:03:00,100
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1168
02:03:02,745 --> 02:03:05,578
- Pita's dead!
- Creasy!

1169
02:03:06,705 --> 02:03:10,937
I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing.

1170
02:03:11,025 --> 02:03:12,014
She's alive.

1171
02:03:15,945 --> 02:03:17,936
All right.

1172
02:03:19,745 --> 02:03:24,899
I want proof of life, you hear me?
I want proof of life. I want...

1173
02:03:24,985 --> 02:03:28,216
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1174
02:03:28,305 --> 02:03:32,696
You tell her to tell you to tell me
what she calls her bear.

1175
02:03:43,345 --> 02:03:45,222
Little one...

1176
02:03:45,305 --> 02:03:47,500
What do you call your teddy bear?

1177
02:04:00,865 --> 02:04:02,457
Yeah?

1178
02:04:02,545 --> 02:04:06,015
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.

1179
02:04:11,105 --> 02:04:12,379
Remember...

1180
02:04:12,465 --> 02:04:14,535
I will give you her life

1181
02:04:14,625 --> 02:04:16,536
for your life

1182
02:04:17,025 --> 02:04:19,300
and the life of my brother.

1183
02:04:21,625 --> 02:04:23,616
OK.

1184
02:04:25,265 --> 02:04:26,857
OK.

1185
02:04:27,865 --> 02:04:31,653
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.

1186
02:04:31,745 --> 02:04:34,464
- All right.
- Where?

1187
02:04:48,545 --> 02:04:52,743
He left the roof. We lost the signal.

1188
02:04:52,825 --> 02:04:54,304
We got cut off.

1189
02:04:56,145 --> 02:04:57,897
We lost him. We lost him.

1190
02:05:00,105 --> 02:05:01,015
Damn.

1191
02:05:17,465 --> 02:05:20,775
- Hello?
- Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1192
02:05:20,865 --> 02:05:22,856
I think Pita's alive.

1193
02:05:24,705 --> 02:05:26,900
I can't take this any more.

1194
02:05:26,985 --> 02:05:31,661
Take the road to Puebla.
Get offjunction 34, south side.

1195
02:05:31,745 --> 02:05:33,736
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1196
02:06:17,785 --> 02:06:20,015
So where is she?

1197
02:06:21,425 --> 02:06:25,623
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1198
02:06:30,705 --> 02:06:32,696
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1199
02:06:33,865 --> 02:06:35,981
