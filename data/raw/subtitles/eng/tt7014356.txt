00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:52,973
<i>Once, the
Romanovs ruled all of Russia.</i>

3
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,076
<i>For 300 years,
the dynasty reigned,</i>

4
00:00:57,078 --> 00:01:01,216
<i>from the first family
to the last.</i>

5
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,519
<i>When the revolution came,
so too the change,</i>

6
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:09,957
<i>and the Romanov name
was seen as a threat.</i>

7
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:13,725
<i>But another name would rise...</i>

8
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:18,630
<i>the name of a young girl
that would become legend.</i>

9
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:20,199
<i>Though no one can say for sure</i>

10
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:21,933
<i>what happened to her,</i>

11
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:26,508
<i>many timeless tales suggest
it's more than it seems.</i>

12
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:31,444
<i>For where there lives hope...</i>

13
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:33,981
<i>there will always live dreams.</i>

14
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,669
The festivities
are beginning, Anastasia.

15
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:00,406
What are you doing
all the way out here?

16
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:03,576
Something doesn't feel right,
Rasputin.

17
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:06,445
Another ball, another party.

18
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:09,714
It's just the butterflies...

19
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:13,488
from all these... guests.

20
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:19,058
It's more than that.
It's the people.

21
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,461
I wish everyone could come,
all of Russia.

22
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:25,797
One day, when you rule,
they will.

23
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,539
I can see it.
It's part of your... magic.

24
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,842
And our plan is still
in place for the ball?

25
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:39,713
It is.

26
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,781
Now, let's go find
your family.

27
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:45,086
The ball's about to begin.

28
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,704
Good evening, Tsar Nicholas.

29
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,938
Wonderful night
for a gathering.

30
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,911
Thank you.
Please, enjoy the party.

31
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,121
- Hm.
- Tsar Nicholas.

32
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,955
May I have a moment?

33
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:25,859
Of course.

34
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:35,368
Thank you for... always
being there for her.

35
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,804
Often I think
you may be her only friend.

36
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:43,975
It's just the age.
I know it well.

37
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:47,580
It was the age
when your family found me

38
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,749
and brought a homeless boy in.

39
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,050
Ah...

40
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:52,485
Now, Your Majesty,

41
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,220
I have been researching
trade routes

42
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:58,224
on how we can improve
the resources for the people.

43
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,826
Always working, my friend.

44
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,195
I have something for you.

45
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:04,666
Hm.

46
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:11,504
Oh, I cannot accept this.

47
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:14,839
Ah... but you must.

48
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:18,446
It is one of many advantages
of being Tsar.

49
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,184
You are now Grigori Rasputin,

50
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:28,122
Grand Protector of Russia.

51
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:32,291
- Thank you.
- Hm.

52
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:35,860
Then as Grand Protector,

53
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:40,132
I must advise you
to entertain Lenin tonight.

54
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,068
Just with a close eye.

55
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,073
Prosperity brings peace, and
Lenin rises with the people.

56
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,241
It'll be a gesture
of goodwill.

57
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:52,678
Lenin is opportunist
and is not to be trusted.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,682
He'll go to unthinkable
lengths to achieve his goals.

59
00:04:56,684 --> 00:05:00,952
I have already informed him that
he is not allowed on this premises,

60
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,456
on this night,
nor any other.

61
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:07,493
Do not worry, Rasputin.

62
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:10,496
We must always stand
for what is right,

63
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:12,500
no matter the times.

64
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:18,738
In you, Russia trusts,
as do I.

65
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,609
I seek your counsel.

66
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,880
This choice is not easy.

67
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:32,919
The correct choices
never are.

68
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:40,092
The heart of Russia

69
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:43,928
grows cold, Lenin.

70
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,732
But a new Russia needs you

71
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,102
if it is to rise.

72
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:54,774
The people, your people,
they starve...

73
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:58,943
while their extravagances
thrive.

74
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:01,380
But what is needed,
I just cannot...

75
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:04,250
It's one family...

76
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:06,985
or an entire nation.

77
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:11,190
The people look to you
to lead.

78
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:14,260
If the Tsar
does not respect this,

79
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:19,901
you must show your strength...
and never look back.

80
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:25,273
Once done...

81
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,310
it shall be done.

82
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,525
Russia cannot continue
under this rule of the Tsar.

83
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,794
The people starve,

84
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:53,965
our resources and power
weaken by the day.

85
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:56,368
Let me lead you
to rise against Nicholas

86
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,371
and restore our
impoverished nation

87
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:01,240
back to prominence.

88
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:05,144
For the people,
I plead to you.

89
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:26,901
The Tsar Nicholas has decreed
that you shall not be allowed...

90
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:31,138
to be on the premises
this evening.

91
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,508
This is the final order...

92
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,277
the order of the Tsar.

93
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,213
You see, elitism!

94
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,982
Royalty!

95
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:45,217
They mock us as commoners.

96
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:49,655
They mock the very essence
of our country!

97
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:51,757
Mark my words when I say this,

98
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,760
this will be
their great downfall.

99
00:07:56,564 --> 00:07:58,697
Their lavish balls,

100
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,866
their imperial costumes,

101
00:08:00,868 --> 00:08:02,968
their feast and arts...

102
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,239
I vow to end this dynasty
from ruling our Russia,

103
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:09,343
once and for all!

104
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:12,912
Father, the ball has begun.

105
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:15,214
Anya, you can't be here.
It's very dangerous.

106
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:16,882
It's OK.

107
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:18,684
We do it for her.

108
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:21,020
We do it for
the children of Russia.

109
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,988
That's who we fight for,

110
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,790
the children of Russia,

111
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,525
for new Russia.

112
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:29,194
Are you with me, comrades?!

113
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:31,931
Then hold your vodka up high.

114
00:08:31,933 --> 00:08:35,834
For peace, land, and power!

115
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,089
Miss, please don't let them
start a conversation.

116
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,127
Last time, we spent
the whole night.

117
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:09,602
Just remember, you can always
use a dance with me as an out.

118
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:12,037
Oh, my hero.

119
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,874
Ah, a conversation
I will enjoy.

120
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,277
A pleasure to see you again.

121
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,879
As always, Russia
is extremely appreciative

122
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,849
of the alliance
between our two countries.

123
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,186
As is China.
We are honored by your invite.

124
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:29,788
No doubt we will have
many a moment

125
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,092
to discuss
our continued friendship.

126
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,593
Still no princess, I see.

127
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:36,462
Well, I look forward
to the day.

128
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:38,797
There are plenty here,
you know.

129
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,633
Fighting I seem
to have mastered.

130
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:43,502
Dance partners,
on the other hand...

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,307
Well, I do trust
your journey here was grand?

132
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,812
Grand, like
all adventures are.

133
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:23,844
My beautiful children.

134
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,714
How did we get so lucky?

135
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:31,984
It is not luck.

136
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,452
How do I look, Father?

137
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,888
Ah... dashing,

138
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,158
like the princes
in your storybook.

139
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,594
And just as brave!

140
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:46,999
- Is it ready?
- Of course. I made you a promise,

141
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,834
and I intend to keep it.

142
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:52,107
But first, what about him?

143
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:58,379
I made your father a promise
that I'd find you a prince.

144
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:01,747
Him? Gross.

145
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,119
Well, I tried.

146
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,122
But now...

147
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,956
And this year,
we have a special guest!

148
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,362
We welcome the orphans.

149
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,259
I have a feeling
that was your daughter.

150
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:50,431
As usual, I believe
you are correct.

You did say you wanted
another child.

165
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,345
- May I have this dance?
- Will you dance with me?

166
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:49,282
- Told you I'd be asked first!
- We were asked at the same time!

167
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:52,254
You have got
to be kidding me.

168
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:00,893
Why, yes, I'd love to dance.

169
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:03,731
Right...

170
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:37,798
Tsar Nicholas,
I must speak to you.

171
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:43,737
I had a vision.
It's Lenin.

172
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,806
No. Not on this night,
Rasputin.

173
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,343
Lenin is at bay.
The guards are at the gates.

174
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:55,649
Just enjoy the festivities,
my old friend.

175
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm here for my meeting
with the Tsar!

176
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:48,234
Come! Hurry!

177
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,138
Come.

178
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:02,482
Go. Hurry!

179
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:07,355
Listen... stay, stay.

180
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,978
Where is the Tsar?!

181
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,447
No sign of the royal family.

182
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:36,516
The guards have searched
everywhere.

183
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:39,085
There are places
in the palace,

184
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:41,423
places unseen.

185
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:49,230
But where?

186
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,270
There.

187
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,838
Is it ready? Lenin will
soon know of our whereabouts.

188
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,243
The link
is nearly complete.

189
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:05,577
We must move,
Rasputin, now!

190
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,248
It is ready.

191
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,785
The children first.

192
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:15,088
Are we going to be OK?

193
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,424
Always.

194
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:23,262
Take this, it will bring
you magic when you need it.

195
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,331
Blue will tell you
who to trust,

196
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,234
and red will tell you
who to fear.

197
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:30,136
And what will be of you?

198
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:32,071
I'll find you with this.

199
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:34,606
Now go, Anastasia, go!

200
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:38,379
Go, Anastasia. Be strong.

201
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:42,381
Papa, are you coming?

202
00:17:42,383 --> 00:17:47,654
Alexei, you must be brave,
like in the storybooks.

203
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:50,791
Now go.

204
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:05,471
Papa...

205
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:07,806
- Papa!
- Anastasia!

206
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:09,977
No, Papa!

207
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:22,624
Seize him!

208
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:29,128
Tell me what you did with her.

209
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,566
Never. So long as the blood
of a Romanov lives,

210
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:37,838
so, too, does the heart
of Russia.

211
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,807
So be it.

Now he is ours.

221
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:52,913
Find her,
the Grand Duchess, Anastasia.

222
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,468
You're going to have
a great time at the party,

223
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,270
I just know it.

224
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:26,905
Sure thing, Mom.

225
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,841
Beatrice invited you herself,
you know.

226
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:33,612
Yeah. She invited me
because you're her mom's boss.

227
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:35,581
We've talked about that,
Megan.

228
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,785
It's not a...

229
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,625
I swear...

230
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:48,728
so many deer this time of year.

231
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,998
Yeah... deer.

232
00:21:57,505 --> 00:22:00,172
- OK.
- Thanks, Mom.

233
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:02,274
- Of course.
- So coulda walked.

234
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:06,044
- But thanks anyway.
- Call me if you need anything, OK?

235
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:08,314
You got it.

236
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,715
I love you.

237
00:22:09,717 --> 00:22:13,019
- Love you too.
- Bye. Have fun.

238
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:41,447
- Megan!
- Happy birthday, Beatrice.

239
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:45,086
Thank you so much.
I'm super glad you made it.

240
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,219
Me too.

241
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:48,754
You know, I've just been

242
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,656
adding gifts to the table

243
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:52,758
but since you're right here,
I'll just

244
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,693
go ahead and open yours.

245
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:56,262
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

246
00:22:56,264 --> 00:22:59,964
- Just put it on the table.
- I insist.

247
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:03,001
It is my birthday,
after all.

248
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:07,241
Right. Anything
for your birthday, Beatrice.

249
00:23:13,013 --> 00:23:17,819
I love it! It's perfect.
Thank you for coming.

250
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:19,518
Yeah.

251
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,353
Thanks for, like,
inviting me.

252
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,289
Megan! I'm so glad
you could make it.

253
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,127
Thanks for coming.
Let's get your skates.

254
00:23:27,862 --> 00:23:29,695
Here, let me take that.
I'll put it with the others.

255
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:32,097
- Oh, thanks.
- You're very welcome,

256
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,567
and please tell your mother
I said hello.

257
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,370
Will do.

258
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,373
Size five, please.

259
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:42,777
Size five.

260
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:02,161
Seriously?
What is this?

261
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:05,164
I told my mom
not to make me invite her.

262
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:08,369
Come on, let's get
to the good gifts.

263
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,292
No good book
should ever go to waste.

264
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,663
Wasn't a hit, huh?

265
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:12,665
Yeah, well, Beatrice is

266
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,233
kind of an idiot, so...

267
00:25:14,235 --> 00:25:16,137
Someone smart should enjoy it.

268
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:22,975
Wait...

269
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:25,010
I can't let a fellow book-lover

270
00:25:25,012 --> 00:25:27,346
leave empty-handed.

271
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:30,683
Store policy.

272
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,718
Pick out any book
you'd like.

273
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,386
It's on the house tonight.

274
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:38,025
- Any book?
- Any.

275
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,269
Thanks.

276
00:26:49,997 --> 00:26:53,066
<i>The Bride of Frankenstein.</i>

277
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,209
You're home early.

278
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:07,446
Yeah, you were supposed to call.
What happened?

279
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:09,281
Party ended early.

280
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,485
I had a great time though.

281
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,355
Really tired.

282
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:17,823
I think I'm gonna
head to bed.

283
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:20,128
OK. Hope you had fun.

284
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:26,200
Huh?

285
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:50,522
You sure everything's OK?

286
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:52,424
Yeah, Mom. I promise.

287
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:55,961
The party was great.
Trust me.

288
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:59,531
OK. I just wanted to check in.

289
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:01,467
Thanks, Mom.

290
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:02,636
You bet.

291
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:13,612
<i>"The History
of the Romanovs."</i>

292
00:29:30,158 --> 00:29:33,494
I know you're there.
Come out.

293
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,569
I knew it was you...

294
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:44,139
the girl from the road.

295
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:48,373
Why are you following me?

296
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,246
And why are you
dressed like that?

297
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:57,116
It's OK.

298
00:29:57,118 --> 00:30:00,119
It's actually a cool dress.

299
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:04,491
It's just, you know,
different.

300
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,294
You're safe here.

301
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:10,529
I won't tell anyone
if you ran away.

302
00:30:10,531 --> 00:30:14,100
I've thought about
doing it too.

303
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:18,003
The whole "no friends,
weird parents" thing.

304
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,638
Totally get it.

305
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,174
If you need a roof,

306
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:23,345
you can stay there
for the night.

307
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,579
The Millers are trying
to sell it, so...

308
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:29,117
it's empty.

309
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,624
Well... come on.

310
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:30,178
Here, hold this.

311
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:39,851
It's just a flashlight.

312
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:44,123
You know,
to help you see in the dark.

313
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,590
A flashlight?

314
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:49,830
Wow. Where again
did you run away from?

315
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:59,504
I come here sometimes
just to get away.

316
00:31:59,506 --> 00:32:01,207
Just make sure you
keep the lights low.

317
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:02,641
It draws attention.

318
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:05,777
It's a lot more comfortable
than it looks.

319
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:12,753
Gotta go. I'll check on you
in the morning, OK?

320
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:18,224
What's your name, anyhow?

321
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:20,625
- Annie.
- Oh.

322
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:24,132
It's nice to meet you, Annie.
I'm Megan.

323
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:31,805
OK, OK.

324
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,676
I'm up.

325
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,770
Did... did you do this?

326
00:33:38,772 --> 00:33:42,040
Yes. You don't like?

327
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,276
Like?

328
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:45,311
I love.

329
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:47,712
This definitely brings value
to the neighborhood.

330
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:50,483
But... the Millers
are gonna be really mad

331
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:52,218
if they drive by
and see it...

332
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,455
with us. So...

333
00:33:55,457 --> 00:33:57,258
Why don't we
get out of here?

334
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,464
But after I change.

335
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:21,648
Welcome to my room.

336
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:27,853
I have to change,
but it'll only be a sec.

337
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:29,857
It's a perk of being 12.

338
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,565
Make yourself at home though.

339
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:06,492
Everything OK out there?

340
00:35:06,494 --> 00:35:08,727
I know you're new here
and stuff,

341
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:10,829
but if you're planning on
sticking around,

342
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:13,031
there's this really cool
Halloween party

343
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,836
that everyone goes to.

344
00:36:00,215 --> 00:36:01,882
Ready to roll?

345
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:41,387
"Madison."

346
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:54,300
What? You act like you've never
been to a playground before.

347
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:56,535
A playground?

348
00:36:56,537 --> 00:37:00,373
Yeah. A playground.

349
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,444
You know,
grounds where you play?

350
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:05,645
The swings are my favorite.

351
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,750
They always make me feel
like I'm flying.

352
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,185
Come on.

353
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:23,531
What are you waiting for?

354
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:31,404
It's safe.

355
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:33,406
It's just old.

356
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,677
I come here all the time.

357
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,417
I don't understand.

358
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:45,817
It's all in the feet.

359
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:49,624
And, well,
remembering to hold on.

360
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:00,101
You got it.

361
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:09,042
OK, the higher you are,
the more fun it is.

362
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:28,160
OK, so at the highest point,
we fly.

363
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:29,894
Ready?

364
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,733
One...

365
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:34,935
two...

366
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:38,537
three!

367
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:48,880
I like playgrounds.

368
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:51,183
Yeah, they're pretty great.

369
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:55,354
Um, who are you?

370
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:58,224
And isn't Halloween
next weekend?

371
00:38:58,226 --> 00:39:00,961
Come on, Beatrice,
leave her alone.

372
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:07,932
Must have got it from the same
place you got that stupid book.

373
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:11,305
Yeah, go back to your hole,
Megan.

374
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,990
Let's get outta here.

375
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:35,261
How...
how did you do that?

376
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:36,529
Russian trick.

377
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:40,232
Well, whatever it was,
it awesome!

378
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,301
Awe-some.

379
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:45,036
What is this awesome?

380
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:46,439
It means...

381
00:39:46,441 --> 00:39:49,710
well...
How 'bout I just show you?

382
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:52,010
Besides,

383
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:55,316
we've really gotta do something
about that dress.

384
00:40:22,477 --> 00:40:24,078
Where to?

385
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:29,114
Mall-leh?

386
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:31,750
- What?
- Mall-leh-leh?

387
00:40:31,752 --> 00:40:33,352
Oh, the mall? The mall.

388
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:34,587
Choose your words, pal.

389
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:36,121
Ain't but a few miles away.

390
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:39,093
And this baby's got
plenty of horsepower.

391
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,864
Where are the horses?

392
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:45,999
Come on in.

393
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:59,078
You look like
a weird, old, creepy man.

394
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,718
Now, honey, you know I said
not to talk to strangers, OK?

395
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:56,035
It's just a movie on a TV.

396
00:41:56,037 --> 00:41:58,704
You know, <i>Back to the Future.</i>

397
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:00,940
Uh... a TV?

398
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:03,075
Yeah, like the one
at the Miller's house.

399
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:07,313
Except this one is on...
and really loud.

400
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:08,847
It works by...

401
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:11,717
Actually, I don't know
how it works.

402
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,520
But it's really cool.

403
00:42:14,522 --> 00:42:18,726
Come on. We've got
a Bliss album to listen to.

404
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,210
Why are you listening to Bliss
on that right now?

405
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:40,479
She's giving a surprise free
concert in the mall right now.

406
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,548
Come on, come on.
Follow me.

407
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:47,286

I don't know how you guys
got up here,

433
00:45:15,503 --> 00:45:18,204
but that was... amazing!

434
00:45:18,206 --> 00:45:19,571
You're amazing!

435
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:21,440
I mean, you're amazing.

436
00:45:21,442 --> 00:45:23,642
I totally get why they
call you Bliss.

437
00:45:23,644 --> 00:45:25,078
Thanks.

438
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,247
Why does your dress
look like that?

439
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:30,482
What... she means is...

440
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:32,851
So cool.

441
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:35,954
Yeah. That really works.

442
00:45:35,956 --> 00:45:37,589
Well, I think you're dress
is pretty cool.

443
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:40,126
I wasn't really expecting that
type of interesting dance

444
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:43,028
to that song. But I like the way
you guys switched it up.

445
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,098
If you want, I can show you
what inspires my look.

446
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,032
That's the key, inspiration.

447
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:48,300
Really?

448
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:49,501
Sure. You know,
after I'm done

449
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:51,637
with this concert
and everything.

450
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:55,007
Right, the concert.

451
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:57,409
Yeah, that. But I'll meet
you guys after, OK?

452
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:59,413

Mmm.

479
00:49:34,162 --> 00:49:37,596
Mommy, my corndog.

480
00:49:44,638 --> 00:49:47,708
You, come on, get in here.
You're on.

481
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:51,810
The villain show's up next.

482
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:54,349
The villain line is up next,
people.

483
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:57,183
You are too good, man.

484
00:49:57,185 --> 00:49:58,184
Let's go!

485
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:07,462
How's my evil mustache?

486
00:50:08,562 --> 00:50:09,594
Mmm...

487
00:50:09,596 --> 00:50:11,596
You wanna be a real villain?

488
00:50:11,598 --> 00:50:14,868
You definitely need
an evil mustache.

489
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:32,751
Places, guys.
Come on, let's go. Line up.

490
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:35,921
- Your turn.
- You guys...

491
00:50:35,923 --> 00:50:37,791
Come on!

492
00:50:54,275 --> 00:50:55,874
All right! Yes.

493
00:50:55,876 --> 00:50:59,145
All right. Next up is
our villain collection.

494
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:11,559
Let's go, let's go.

495
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,265
Right, go.

496
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,978
Come on, you're up.

497
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:45,893
Evil! Evil! Evil!

498
00:52:13,887 --> 00:52:15,921
That was awesome!

499
00:52:29,736 --> 00:52:32,338
Wow! It's...

500
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,609
Perfect.

501
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,047
Oh, gosh.
I'm so late.

502
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:43,748
But this was so worth it.

503
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,286
Yeah, thanks for being
so, you know...

504
00:52:47,288 --> 00:52:50,091
Awesome.

505
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,195
If you're ever in California,
look me up.

506
00:53:29,197 --> 00:53:31,664
We will.
Right, Annie?

507
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,702
I've always wanted to go
to California.

508
00:53:58,126 --> 00:54:00,259
Ha!

509
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:03,462
Sir!
That's really not appropriate

510
00:54:03,464 --> 00:54:06,833
You need to leave.

511
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:14,906
So... Annie,
that's a pretty name.

512
00:54:14,908 --> 00:54:17,042
Thank you.

513
00:54:17,044 --> 00:54:20,045
It doesn't sound
very Russian though.

514
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:21,681
Is it Russian?

515
00:54:21,683 --> 00:54:23,249
I knew immediately
where you were from

516
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:24,617
because of your accent.

517
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:26,719
I am fascinated
by Russian history.

518
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,388
Catherine the Great,
Ivan the Terrible,

519
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,923
the Romanovs...

520
00:54:31,925 --> 00:54:35,127
Do you still have family there?

521
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:38,999
- Yes.
- Well, it's a different world.

522
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:43,237
Here you go, honey.

523
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:04,256
Oh, my...

524
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,328
Well, I would love
to meet your parents.

525
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:11,630
Maybe next time we can
all have dinner together.

526
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:13,867
That'd be great.

527
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:29,148
Worms?

528
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,518
No, spaghetti.

529
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,487
What are you waiting for?

530
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:36,124
Dig in.

531
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:04,685
Uh, that's how they
eat spaghetti in Russia.

532
00:56:08,689 --> 00:56:11,690
I-I... Did you know this?

533
00:56:11,692 --> 00:56:13,626
I had no idea.

534
00:56:13,628 --> 00:56:15,897
But...

535
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:18,699
It's certainly more fun.

536
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:30,142
I'm really glad
you have a new friend.

537
00:56:30,144 --> 00:56:31,677
Yeah.

538
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,681
A friend.

539
00:56:47,994 --> 00:56:49,628
So I'm guessing
Coke and spaghetti

540
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,764
are your favorite
things now.

541
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:54,433
Very much so.

542
00:56:54,435 --> 00:56:56,335
Oh, this is my favorite part.

543
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:02,508
<i>♪ I had the time of my life ♪</i>

544
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,112
<i>♪ No, I never... ♪</i>

545
00:57:07,248 --> 00:57:08,681
Come on.

546
00:57:08,683 --> 00:57:11,786
You leap,
and I'll catch you.

547
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,164
I've always wanted
to do that.

548
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,033
Oh...

549
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:31,170
I got these...
two birthdays ago.

550
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:35,176
And I've never really had
anyone to share them with.

551
00:57:36,677 --> 00:57:38,110
What is it?

552
00:57:38,112 --> 00:57:39,879
They're friendship bracelets.

553
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:42,314
You get half,
and I get half.

554
00:57:42,316 --> 00:57:44,884
So we're never really apart.

555
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:48,856
And when we really are together,
they're whole.

556
00:57:52,727 --> 00:57:55,394
Can I ask you something?

557
00:57:55,396 --> 00:57:57,530
Anything.

558
00:57:57,532 --> 00:57:59,632
Who are you really?

559
00:57:59,634 --> 00:58:02,635
You know, the bushes

560
00:58:02,637 --> 00:58:05,106
the day at the playground.

561
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,442
The necklace that glows.

562
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:12,246
You're different.

563
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,014
I know it.

564
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:17,018
Yes.

565
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,407
I don't understand.

566
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,986
How is that even possible?

567
00:58:54,722 --> 00:58:56,622
When Lenin rose against us,

568
00:58:56,624 --> 00:59:01,226
Rasputin created a portal to
a place where we would be safe.

569
00:59:01,228 --> 00:59:05,397
He sent me through
with this amulet.

570
00:59:05,399 --> 00:59:06,665
For it's glow would guide me

571
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:08,402
to someone I could trust.

572
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:12,471
But my family...

573
00:59:12,473 --> 00:59:15,876
I was the only one
who made it through.

574
00:59:18,379 --> 00:59:21,882
Well... do you know
what happened to them?

575
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:24,750
No.

576
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:27,254
Only what's in the book.

577
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:36,062
It's OK.

578
00:59:36,064 --> 00:59:37,630
I'm glad you found me,

579
00:59:37,632 --> 00:59:41,002
even if you had to time travel
to meet me.

580
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:45,973
I'll always be here for you.

581
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:48,108
Besides...

582
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,144
we're family now.

583
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:14,468
OK.

584
01:00:17,105 --> 01:00:18,704
I'll pick you up at ten,

585
01:00:18,706 --> 01:00:22,908
but no later.
And no walking home.

586
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,810
We got it.
Thanks, Mom.

587
01:00:24,812 --> 01:00:27,980
Don't call me Mom,
it's Mummy.

588
01:00:27,982 --> 01:00:30,649
Right, Mummy.

589
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:32,751
Oh, and girls,

590
01:00:32,753 --> 01:00:35,821
happy All Hallows' Eve.

591
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:40,961
Come on.

592
01:00:49,737 --> 01:00:52,705
Remember, it's all fake.

593
01:00:52,707 --> 01:00:55,674
Plus, she's, like, four.

594
01:00:59,914 --> 01:01:02,881
Trick or treat?

595
01:01:02,883 --> 01:01:04,750
One quick stop
before the party?

596
01:01:04,752 --> 01:01:07,619
Do we get trick and treat?

597
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:09,423
Watch and learn.

598
01:01:19,734 --> 01:01:22,801
Actually,
why don't you do it?

599
01:01:22,803 --> 01:01:24,737
Everyone loves a princess.

600
01:01:24,739 --> 01:01:26,705
Especially a real one.

601
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:30,409
So I just knock on the door,
and they give me things?

602
01:01:30,411 --> 01:01:33,981
Yep. That's the power
of Halloween.

603
01:01:37,918 --> 01:01:40,155
Knock harder.

604
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:55,203
Trick and treat?

605
01:02:25,733 --> 01:02:28,500
Have you found her?

606
01:02:28,502 --> 01:02:31,005
She has eluded me.

607
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,839
Time is ticking.

608
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:37,279
Find the girl
and bring her to me.

609
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:07,309
Dude, you are way too old
to be trick or treating.

610
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:25,091
The haunted house party
is gonna be amazing.

611
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,658
Dude, everyone in town
is gonna be there.

612
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:30,796
OK, we are talking
<i>Risky Business</i> amazing.

613
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:34,900
Dude, can I just say for
a minute how much I love you?

614
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:44,678
Come on.
Let's explore.

615
01:03:58,692 --> 01:04:01,462
I think he likes you.

616
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:06,398
How do you say gross?

617
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,137
Gross is exactly
what you say.

618
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:26,087
Oh, look,
it's Queen Bee Beatrice.

619
01:04:37,865 --> 01:04:39,767
Victory.

620
01:04:42,603 --> 01:04:45,238
Come on.
A haunted maze.

621
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,074
A haunted maze?

622
01:04:48,076 --> 01:04:50,376
- I give up.
- Trust me.

623
01:04:50,378 --> 01:04:52,579
You're gonna love it.

624
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:09,995
- Hey!
- I'm telling.

625
01:05:40,594 --> 01:05:43,695
OK, so the fun
is figuring a way out.

626
01:05:43,697 --> 01:05:46,867
Don't we just go out
the same way we came in?

627
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,743
Nope.

628
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:26,508
Keep up!

629
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:49,730
Megan...

630
01:06:54,235 --> 01:06:56,438
Megan?

631
01:07:13,221 --> 01:07:15,656
Rasputin!

632
01:07:22,363 --> 01:07:24,932
How did you find me?

633
01:07:28,203 --> 01:07:31,439
Are they... OK?

634
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:40,714
Rasputin...

635
01:07:41,782 --> 01:07:44,783
It is time to go home,
child.

636
01:07:50,058 --> 01:07:52,624
Megan!

637
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:55,696
- Megan!
- Annie?

638
01:07:57,265 --> 01:07:58,930
Annie...

639
01:07:58,932 --> 01:08:01,768
Annie.

640
01:08:08,976 --> 01:08:11,379
Annie?

641
01:08:25,926 --> 01:08:27,928
Looking for your friend?

642
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:34,300
We saw her leave...
without you.

643
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:58,591
We march to you now.

644
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:03,262
You have done well, Rasputin.
We await.

645
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,567
No!

646
01:09:17,345 --> 01:09:19,145
Where's your friend?

647
01:09:19,147 --> 01:09:21,012
I just wanna go home,
Mom.

648
01:09:21,014 --> 01:09:23,482
But... OK.

649
01:09:23,484 --> 01:09:25,251
Is she OK?

650
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:27,121
She's fine...

651
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,957
I guess.

652
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:34,795
OK.

653
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,036
Cool costume, freak.

654
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,661
<i>I'm Ashley Anderson

676

What are you doing with me?

677
01:11:52,133 --> 01:11:53,499
I must take you back,

678
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:55,770
- as he commands.
- Back?

679
01:11:56,838 --> 01:11:59,772
The portal waits
for one more visit.

680
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:04,777
- Through and back.
- Through and back?

681
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:07,546
With your return
to Mother Russia

682
01:12:07,548 --> 01:12:10,416
there'll be no remaining
Romanov heirs.

683
01:12:10,418 --> 01:12:15,623
And he will do to you
as he will do to your family.

684
01:12:16,691 --> 01:12:18,159
They are alive?

685
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,961
Rasputin, it isn't you.

686
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,831
You don't have to do this.

687
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:28,667
To Mother Russia
we return.

688
01:12:36,677 --> 01:12:39,111
How did...?

689
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:41,414
The magic of TV.

690
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,984
Come on. Follow me.

691
01:12:55,263 --> 01:12:57,463
Hop on.

692
01:12:57,465 --> 01:12:59,165
My portal, I need
to get back to it.

693
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,566
I can save them.

694
01:13:00,568 --> 01:13:03,169
- Well, where is it?
- The playground.

695
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:04,839
I'm on it.

696
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:47,849
I know it's here some...

697
01:13:53,087 --> 01:13:55,054
That's it!

698
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,791
The portal.

699
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:08,269
He's here.

700
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,857
Follow my lead.

701
01:14:41,002 --> 01:14:43,170
Easy...

702
01:14:44,037 --> 01:14:47,441
When I say go...
Get ready.

703
01:14:49,143 --> 01:14:50,344
Go!

704
01:15:06,761 --> 01:15:08,360
We need a plan.

705
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:10,798
Like, now.

706
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,703
I have an idea.

707
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:20,308
I'll distract him,
you run.

708
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,844
This is it.

709
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,080
I'll always remember you.

710
01:15:30,151 --> 01:15:31,953
Always.

711
01:15:35,723 --> 01:15:38,726
I think you forgot something.

<i>♪ Time after time ♪</i>

714
01:15:56,777 --> 01:15:58,913
OK, you need to go.

715
01:16:23,638 --> 01:16:26,974
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

716
01:16:29,677 --> 01:16:32,947
At the highest point,
we fly.

717
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,053
Three...

718
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:40,855
two...

719
01:16:43,157 --> 01:16:44,291
fly!

720
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:25,764
This isn't you!

721
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,466
Rasputin!

722
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:29,104
Look at me.

723
01:17:33,808 --> 01:17:36,508
Look deep inside you.

724
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:40,212
You are more than this spell,
I see it in you.

725
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:46,186
The regular you.

726
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:51,356
I must take you to him.

727
01:17:51,358 --> 01:17:55,061
Always stand
for what is right,

728
01:17:55,063 --> 01:17:57,130
no matter the times.

729
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:18,817
We must always stand
for what is right,

730
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,056
no matter the times.

731
01:18:32,134 --> 01:18:33,932
My Anastasia.

732
01:18:36,637 --> 01:18:39,074
I'm so sorry.

733
01:18:51,652 --> 01:18:53,521
Yes!

734
01:18:58,425 --> 01:18:59,892
I'm back.

735
01:18:59,894 --> 01:19:01,360
Is it ready?

736
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,263
Lenin will soon know
of our whereabouts.

737
01:19:03,265 --> 01:19:05,466
The link is nearly complete.

738
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,001
We must move,
Rasputin, now!

739
01:19:09,003 --> 01:19:10,471
It is ready.

740
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,473
The children first.

741
01:19:14,475 --> 01:19:16,375
- Come to me. Come.
- No, Papa!

742
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,680
We must go through the portal
before it is too late.

743
01:19:53,047 --> 01:19:56,051
Ana, Ana.

744
01:20:02,057 --> 01:20:03,490
The amulet.

745
01:20:09,097 --> 01:20:12,300
Let's go. Go.
Come on.

746
01:20:15,703 --> 01:20:17,136
Are you coming?

747
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:18,804
I cannot.

748
01:20:18,806 --> 01:20:22,741
If I come, he will
never stop looking for you.

749
01:20:22,743 --> 01:20:25,111
Here, I can protect you.

750
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:27,746
And Russia.

751
01:20:27,748 --> 01:20:30,185
My faithful friend...

752
01:20:44,932 --> 01:20:46,598
Time is of the essence,

753
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,171
but when time catches up,
find her.

754
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:18,463
Hey, kiddo.
If you're not too busy,

755
01:21:18,465 --> 01:21:21,367
could you run this gift
over to the new neighbors?

756
01:21:21,369 --> 01:21:23,735
But they just moved in.

757
01:21:23,737 --> 01:21:25,371
We know.

758
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:26,805
But 'tis the season.

759
01:21:26,807 --> 01:21:29,142
And we'd like to start off
on a good foot.

760
01:21:29,144 --> 01:21:33,381
One without any
mysterious animal bushes.

761
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:45,093
Fine.

762
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:18,091
Right.

763
01:22:18,093 --> 01:22:20,428
It's fixed.

764
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:58,632
You must be here
for Grandmother.

765
01:23:08,842 --> 01:23:10,709
Hello...

766
01:23:10,711 --> 01:23:12,878
old friend.

767
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,516
Annie?

768
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:17,183
But that would mean...

769
01:23:17,185 --> 01:23:22,790
That I'm every bit
of 83 years old.

770
01:23:23,191 --> 01:23:24,656
But how?

771
01:23:24,658 --> 01:23:29,863
Come, I will tell you
all about it.

772
01:23:30,998 --> 01:23:34,668
How do these stories go?

773
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:37,403
Ah, yes.

774
01:23:37,405 --> 01:23:41,309
