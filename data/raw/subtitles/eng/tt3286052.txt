1
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:57,500
Daddy...

2
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,273
Kimberly.

3
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,464
Daddy, where's the car?

4
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,519
Mama?

5
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,573
Father Brian?

6
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:36,284
Sorry to disturb.

7
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:39,120
Yes of course.
Come in, Katherine.

8
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:43,625
Sit down.

9
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,710
Thank you Dawn.

10
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,132
Mr. Walch tells me your recital's

11
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:55,177
coming along very, very nicely.
Sorry I won't be around to see it,

12
00:02:55,387 --> 00:03:00,792
But I'm sure that you'll enjoy performing for your
friends and your parents all the same, won't you?

13
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:02,560
Where are you going?

14
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,813
I have some personal business in Albany.

15
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:11,027
How long does it take to get to Albany?

16
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:15,782
Oh... couple of hours... by train.

17
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:22,038
So about the same exact time to
come back then, I guess... huh?

18
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:26,418
Katherine...

19
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,673
are you concerned about something?

20
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,973
I mean just wish you could
stay and see my performance.

21
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:42,809
That's all.

22
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:47,939
Well, I'm sorry but this time
it just can't be helped.

23
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,111
When do you come back?

24
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,241
After the break...

25
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:01,994
with everyone else, I should imagine.

26
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:18,220
Is something funny?

27
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,601
Funny?

28
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:28,355
No.
Why?

29
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,024
You smiled a little.

30
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:33,443
I did?

31
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:37,280
Yes you did.

32
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:53,921
I was just thinking to say I hope
you have a fun time in Albany.

33
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:36,899
Headache, you say?

34
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,779
And my throat kinda hurts when I swallow.

35
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:44,407
You poor thing...

36
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,952
It would be a shame to
be sick over the break.

37
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,161
I know...

38
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:53,458
Here you are, dear.

39
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:07,639
So you really think I should tell him?

40
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,892
Rose, of course you have to tell him!

41
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:13,978
It's like half his.
It's half his problem anyway.

42
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:16,188
No it isn't.
Not really.

43
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:17,690
Well it should be.

44
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:21,361
He's the one who got you in this
situation in the first place.

45
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:23,280
He knew exactly what he was doing.

46
00:07:23,488 --> 00:07:26,032
Like I didn't?
He was doing it to me.

47
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:28,576
And I was liking it.

48
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:33,831
Don't laugh.
It's so not funny.

49
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:38,378
Besides it's only been four days.

50
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,796
I could still get it.

51
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,007
You think you're going
to tell your parents?

52
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:51,891
Of course, everyone is excited
to have your parents come and

53
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:55,186
tour the classrooms and share your life

54
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:57,146
here at Bramford with them.

55
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:58,690
But that doesn't mean

56
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:03,278
there's going to be any change when
when it comes to con-duct ex-pec-ta-tions.

57
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:08,074
If anything, conduct is more
important today than any other day

58
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:13,120
because today we are all here
today representing Bramford.

59
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,750
And that means that you are representing
all the young women who came before you

60
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,420
and all the women who will follow you

61
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,171
after you've moved on.

62
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,383
Sound good?

63
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,885
Sounds good...

64
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:31,348
And if I don't see you before you
leave, have a great week off

65
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,600
We'll see you on the...

66
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:28,613
Rose!

67
00:09:29,989 --> 00:09:31,073
Where are you going?

68
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,618
I was gonna check out
some of the performance.

69
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:36,037
You okay?

70
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:37,580
Yeah, of course

71
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:40,124
Where are your parents?

72
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,002
They're waiting inside
so I better go.

73
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:48,174
Okay, well... I'll see you
next week then, okay?

74
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,097
Katherine...

75
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:20,392
Have you checked your cellular phone?

76
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,143
Maybe they called you there.

77
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:24,979
I don't have one yet.

78
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,275
They said maybe for my birthday.

79
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:36,574
You know, bad weather coming in
all over the east coast an'

80
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:38,535
maybe they got caught up in that.

81
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:40,870
Planes get delayed.

82
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:44,040
And Rose, what about you?

83
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:48,711
I thought we got out on Friday so
I told my parents to come on Friday.

84
00:11:51,714 --> 00:11:52,840
Guess I spaced out.

85
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:55,051
Were you able to reach them?

86
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:59,389
Yeah... it just may take a day or so
to change their plans.

87
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,891
- A day?
- Yeah, 'cause they're...

88
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,852
planning on coming
on Friday so they'll

89
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,854
probably still come on Friday.

90
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,943
All right, well... Miss Prescott
and Miss Drake

91
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:14,821
will be here in any case.
Now do you hear that, Katherine?

92
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,658
It happens that parents get confused and

93
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:22,203
Worst case is they come on Friday
and everyone goes home

94
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,872
and has a really nice break anyway

95
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:28,335
After all... we can't let you live here.

96
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,964
Rose, Would you look after Kat

97
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:34,757
until her parents arrive?

98
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,511
I actually haven't been feeling very well.

99
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:43,266
I have a really sore throat.
I was gonna stay in bed

100
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,528
Uh, Miss Prescott,

101
00:12:56,238 --> 00:12:59,491
You will call Mr Cornish

102
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:03,119
in a few hours, both on his home
phone and his mobile

103
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:05,997
- Won't you?
- Of course we will.

104
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,250
Sound good?

105
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:12,879
Katherine?

106
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:15,882
Sounds good.

107
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,179
Hey... dad.

108
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:26,809
It's me.

109
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:31,814
Just calling to see where
you and mom were...

110
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:34,066
if you're coming...

111
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,572
I guess you could call the school.

112
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:30,582
Dear Lord,

113
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:33,710
Thank you for this meal that
you have placed in front of us

114
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:35,044
on this night.

115
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,921
You know I'm not babysitting
you tonight right, Freshman?

116
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:51,644
Mr Gordon said you were
supposed to stay with me.

117
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:56,566
Yeah but what's he gonna do, bust me
for not being in school over vacation?

118
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:57,734
Mr Gordon said that...

119
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,112
"Mr Gordon said... Mr Gordon said"

120
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,947
What are you, a freaking recording?

121
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,158
- Where are you going?
- Me?

122
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,911
Nowhere

123
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:13,750
And if the sisters say anything, just tell them
I wasn't feeling well so I'm staying in bed.

124
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,712
You do know about the sisters, don't you?

125
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,839
Know what?

126
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:21,924
You know they wear wigs, right?

127
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:26,929
You know they have no hair on their bodies?

128
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:30,392
No hair anywhere

129
00:15:33,603 --> 00:15:35,397
Next time, check their eyebrows.

130
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,024
Totally fake.

131
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,779
The real ones... burned right off.

132
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:44,531
That's not true.

133
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:47,659
You didn't hear about Jen Darling's sister?

134
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,994
Graduated three years ago.

135
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,123
She walked in on them one night...

136
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,960
worshipping the Devil.

137
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:04,842
Who told you?

138
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:16,938
Don't come in my room, okay?

139
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,775
And don't touch my shit.

140
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,089
Th... uh, there's someone in here.

141
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,544
<i>I'm sorry. The number you have dialled has
been disconnected or is no longer in service.</i>

142
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:12,317
Are you okay?

143
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,921
You can't be warm enough in that jacket.

144
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:24,036
Are you waiting for someone?

145
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,409
Can we give you a lift somewhere?
You gotta be freezing.

146
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:32,462
Where are you heading?

147
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:37,759
We're gonna get back on the highway and
then we're gonna head east a little while.

148
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:40,553
How 'bout you, you heading someplace?

149
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:46,183
- Portsmith.
- Sure, I know Portsmith.

150
00:21:48,102 --> 00:21:49,913
I'm parked right over there. My
wife's waiting in the car

151
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:51,439
See? Right there.

152
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:57,570
My name's Bill.

153
00:21:58,238 --> 00:21:59,239
What's your name?

154
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:01,699
Joan.

155
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:03,826
My name's Joan.

156
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,872
Nice, nice name.

157
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,711
Bill, what're you doing?

158
00:22:13,878 --> 00:22:15,463
Just trying to help.

159
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:18,883
C'mon.

160
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,529
We'll take her to the next gas station.

161
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:42,865
I'm trying to help.

162
00:23:38,713 --> 00:23:39,922
Call me later okay?

163
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,092
I don't have my phone.

164
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:48,265
So that's it?

165
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:51,268
Stop saying that.

166
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:55,605
What am I supposed to say?

167
00:23:57,732 --> 00:23:58,941
Nothing.

168
00:24:04,697 --> 00:24:05,698
I'll take care of it.

169
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,201
Can you at least let me drive you there?

170
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,579
No... no way

171
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,334
Careful, OK?

172
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:22,840
Careful...
Yeah, right.

173
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,572
Idiot!

174
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:44,292
Katherine?

175
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:57,462
It's Bill.

176
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,048
From the bus station.

177
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:05,345
Do you mind if I come in?

178
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:27,825
Just wanted to see how you're doing.

179
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:32,622
I see you're up at least.

180
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:56,771
So...

181
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:01,150
I guess you're pretty
zonked out there, huh?

182
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:05,196
You slept for four hours in the backseat.

183
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:07,824
I'm sorry.

184
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:09,033
For what?

185
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:14,497
First rule,

186
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,417
you don't apologise to me, young lady.

187
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:20,086
I'm happy to help, okay?

188
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,255
I'm sorry...

189
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:24,799
It's okay.

190
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:30,430
Why are you doing this?

191
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:33,057
Doing what?

192
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,268
Helping me so much?

193
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,108
Do you believe in God, Joan?

194
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:48,906
No? Just like that?

195
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,082
Ever try to look for him?

196
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:03,755
It's strange.

197
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:09,677
People think you look for Him
in some book, or a church or

198
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:12,096
a statue

199
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:14,807
maybe even a candle flame.

200
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,562
But that's not how it works for me.

201
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:24,817
I look for Him in the
unlikely things that happen.

202
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:27,820
Little co?cidences.

203
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,450
When I saw you sitting
at that bus station,

204
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,038
You reminded me so much
of someone...

205
00:34:41,584 --> 00:34:43,711
someone I haven't seen
in a long time...

206
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:48,466
And then, when you said you
were going to Portsmith...

207
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,305
Well... a coincidence like that
I just can't ignore it.

208
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,769
So strange as it may sound,

209
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:03,856
I guess I saw God in you.

210
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,115
Are you going to Portsmith too?

211
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:15,368
No, not exactly.

212
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,788
Linda and I are headed
to the town just before it...

213
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:21,333
We're going to Bramford.

214
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,088
Do you know Bramford?

215
00:35:41,936 --> 00:35:42,937
What's that?

216
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:45,232
When do we leave?

217
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:49,944
What's your hurry?

218
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:56,493
Where's your wife?

219
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,373
She's sleeping.

220
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:07,879
Why?

221
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:21,142
Well, hopefully we can...

222
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,686
get out of here first thing
in the morning.

223
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:26,939
I, uh... bet you're pretty hungry.

224
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:31,278
There's a restaurant next door.

225
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:33,988
Why don't you get dressed,
come down and have some dinner.

226
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:12,444
You know how much trouble
I could get into for this?

227
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:25,915
Do you need a towel?

228
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:36,133
So what were you doing down there?

229
00:37:45,852 --> 00:37:47,229
Were you sleepwalking?

230
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:50,982
Do you sleepwalk, is that
what that was?

231
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:02,118
What about your parents?

232
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,078
Did they call?

233
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,265
They're not going to call.

234
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,726
They just got confused.

235
00:38:27,477 --> 00:38:28,478
Like your parents?

236
00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:32,023
But your parents didn't get confused.

237
00:38:33,316 --> 00:38:35,693
You told them not to come
so you could go out on a date.

238
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:40,990
- It wasn't a date.
- It wasn't?

239
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:44,160
- No, it wasn't.
- What was it?

240
00:38:45,077 --> 00:38:46,288
Nothing.

241
00:38:50,667 --> 00:38:52,835
Mr Gordon said you were
supposed to look after me.

242
00:39:01,844 --> 00:39:03,388
I know what Mr Gordon said.

243
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:06,599
Mr Gordon said worst case they'd
be here by Friday.

244
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:09,227
- Yeah, I know what he said...
- And now it's too late.

245
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:11,145
Too late for what?

246
00:39:13,565 --> 00:39:14,607
They're dead.

247
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:29,706
That is an awful thing to say.

248
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,710
You shouldn't say things like that.

249
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:40,967
You shouldn't say things like that,
okay? It's just not funny.

250
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,270
You smell pretty...

251
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:58,651
You should go to bed.

252
00:39:59,777 --> 00:40:01,939
Just go to bed, then when you wake up
in the morning...

253
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,076
you're gonna be okay, alright?

254
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:11,289
They'll be here on Friday.
They're already on their way.

255
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:12,832
That's it. OK?

256
00:40:14,251 --> 00:40:15,418
That's it.

257
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:20,882
You should go to bed now.

258
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:24,219
Is there anything else I can get you?

259
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:28,723
No, you had your chance.

260
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:40,878
There she is

261
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:44,424
Linda has an extra coat.
It's a lot warmer than yours.

262
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:46,092
She won't mind if you borrow it.

263
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:47,802
She's gonna be along any minute.

264
00:41:50,597 --> 00:41:52,557
So... Portsmith, huh?

265
00:41:53,516 --> 00:41:54,684
Is that your home?

266
00:41:55,445 --> 00:41:57,071
Your mom and dad?

267
00:41:58,598 --> 00:41:59,528
No.

268
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:02,484
No...
Friends? Someone?

269
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:07,364
- Someone.
- That's better than having no one, isn't it?

270
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,369
They changed the decor of
this place a few years ago.

271
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:16,414
Used to be more of a kid's place,

272
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:19,251
famous for their chicken noodle soup.

273
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,711
That's how we came by it anyway.

274
00:42:21,878 --> 00:42:24,561
Linda and I used to, uh, spend a lot
of time here with our daughter.

275
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:31,053
Remember I told you that you,
uh, remind me of somebody?

276
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:38,144
You reminded me of her... my daughter.

277
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:42,357
She'd be right about your age by now.

278
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:47,111
We lost her nine years ago.

279
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:49,947
Nine years, uh...

280
00:42:51,073 --> 00:42:52,784
tomorrow, actually.

281
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:56,454
And it's okay, we do okay...

282
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:59,040
It's difficult but uh...

283
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,252
You know what they say,
time heals all wounds.

284
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:06,047
And little by little it does
get easier, except...

285
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:09,509
around this time of year when
we go and lay flowers...

286
00:43:09,676 --> 00:43:10,843
on the anniversary.

287
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:15,848
I've got a picture.

288
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:48,005
That's my Rose.

289
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,260
She's pretty.

290
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,222
Yes she is, isn't she?

291
00:44:00,268 --> 00:44:02,103
Have you decided?

292
00:44:02,144 --> 00:44:04,063
Oh, uh, yes I've decided.

293
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:07,400
- Joan, you decided?
- Excuse me.

294
00:45:11,506 --> 00:45:13,383
Oh, there you are.

295
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:16,928
Look, we've got some, uh, really
bad weather coming in overnight.

296
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:20,557
And if we don't get on the road tonight,
we're gonna be snowed in tomorrow,

297
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:22,559
maybe the day after.

298
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:26,921
They're gonna pack up our food for us, so why
don't you grab it and meet me out front?

299
00:45:57,385 --> 00:45:59,362
What did he tell you?

300
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:06,411
Did he tell you about our daughter?

301
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:16,988
When he told you about
our daughter he said,

302
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:20,575
HAVE, didn't he?

303
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,750
"We HAVE a daughter."

304
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:39,969
He told you, you remind
him of her.

305
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,143
He actually said that to you,
didn't he?

306
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:54,942
It's okay, poor thing...

307
00:46:55,402 --> 00:46:57,904
He tries to say that to everyone.

308
00:46:59,906 --> 00:47:01,616
Of course, I never see it.

309
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,619
Of course it isn't true.

310
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,546
But still sometimes I try.

311
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:19,759
I saw it once,

312
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,097
I was at the supermarket alone.

313
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:30,687
And I was standing in the middle
of a long aisle all by myself.

314
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,858
And a girl came 'round the corner.

315
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:40,947
She was looking on a low
shelf for something.

316
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:43,533
She's about 15.

317
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:50,164
And she had her money held
tightly in her hand

318
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:51,999
like children do.

319
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:58,256
I guess school had gone back already.

320
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,307
She was just in her uniform, skirt...

321
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:09,892
sneakers... with no socks.

322
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:12,645
Her knees were pink,

323
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:16,524
It was red from the cold.

324
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:18,735
But what did she know?

325
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,907
She had her hair in a ponytail

326
00:48:25,992 --> 00:48:29,412
and I could see the roots being
pulled back from her ears.

327
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,685
You don't look anything like her.

328
00:48:58,608 --> 00:48:59,984
It's strange.

329
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,987
I can't see you at all.

330
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,647
Well what did they say?

331
00:50:26,363 --> 00:50:27,655
What did they say?

332
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,699
He said it's all right.

333
00:50:30,032 --> 00:50:31,701
Wait, what's all right?
Who says?

334
00:50:32,577 --> 00:50:34,746
He says I can't live here,

335
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:37,374
but I can... with him.

336
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:40,793
Who's he?

337
00:50:42,545 --> 00:50:43,546
You know who.

338
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:45,798
No, I don't know.

339
00:50:46,216 --> 00:50:47,884
Mr Gordon

340
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,469
Silly...

341
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,888
He's the headmaster.

342
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:07,862
You smell pretty...

343
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:37,350
Dear Lord...

344
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:40,937
Thank you for this meal that you have
placed in front of us on this day.

345
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:43,315
Katherine...

346
00:51:49,696 --> 00:51:50,697
Yes, ma'am?

347
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:53,575
Is there something wrong?

348
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:56,369
No, ma'am.

349
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,164
In that case,

350
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,211
kindly repeat Grace for
the rest of us.

351
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:15,597
Dear Lord...

352
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,437
Thank you for this meal that you've
place in front of us that...

353
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:26,190
and for which we're truly...

354
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:27,359
Katherine!

355
00:52:50,257 --> 00:52:51,383
Mercy!

356
00:52:56,846 --> 00:52:58,306
Is she okay?

357
00:53:05,021 --> 00:53:06,606
She's fine.

358
00:53:09,025 --> 00:53:10,443
Did Mr Gordon call?

359
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:13,655
Why on earth would the
headmaster call here?

360
00:53:15,365 --> 00:53:16,741
I don't know... just...

361
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:19,369
To see if they were all right?
Her parents?

362
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:21,621
Of course they are all right.

363
00:53:22,705 --> 00:53:25,166
And Katherine is all right as well.

364
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,962
Thank you, Miss Drake.

365
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:31,798
Drink this, dear.

366
00:53:35,427 --> 00:53:36,511
Katherine...

367
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:41,224
Get your hands off me, cunt.

368
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:56,030
Miss Drake, the telephone please!

369
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,825
Certainly, dear.

370
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,877
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

371
00:54:11,045 --> 00:54:13,715
You will look at me when
I am talking to you!

372
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:15,800
Miss Prescott?

373
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:17,134
A word, please.

374
00:54:22,265 --> 00:54:24,141
He really did say he'd come.

375
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:29,439
He'll come and he'll say he was wrong.

376
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:34,652
This time he'll say that
I can live here.

377
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:37,489
He's the headmaster...

378
00:54:38,698 --> 00:54:40,825
Rose, uh, come out here please.

379
00:54:57,884 --> 00:55:01,554
I'm kindly asking... to shovel
the path between the houses

380
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:04,974
Shovel it down to the earth.

381
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:07,394
Me?
Why me?

382
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,271
What did I do?

383
00:55:09,437 --> 00:55:12,315
Mr Gordon will be arriving
this afternoon.

384
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:16,152
Mr Gordon...

385
00:55:18,446 --> 00:55:19,864
What happened?

386
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:25,703
Down to the earth... please.

387
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:14,080
- You alright?
- Uh, yes.

388
00:58:14,414 --> 00:58:16,249
They should be over this way.

389
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,389
Miss Prescott?

390
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:05,752
Mommy?

391
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:09,672
Dad?

392
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:15,177
<i>Hi, baby girl.</i>

393
01:01:21,058 --> 01:01:22,059
Dad?

394
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:25,230
<i>Katherine...</i>

395
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:32,153
Wh-Who is it?

396
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:44,040
<i>They're not coming.</i>

397
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:49,337
<i>Kill all the cunts.</i>

398
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:25,433
<i>They're wigs, right?</i>

399
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:30,438
<i>You know that they have no hair
on their bodies?</i>

400
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:33,900
<i>No hair anywhere?</i>

401
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,904
<i>Next time check their eyebrows.</i>

402
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:40,031
<i>Totally fake.</i>

403
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:45,161
<i>The real ones... burned right off.</i>

404
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:49,123
<i>You didn't hear about
Jen Darling's sister?</i>

405
01:03:49,707 --> 01:03:51,793
<i>Graduated three years ago.</i>

406
01:03:53,878 --> 01:03:55,922
<i>She walked in on them one night...</i>

407
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:01,469
<i>worshipping the Devil.</i>

408
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:16,168
<i>You can stay here with me...</i>

409
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:24,927
<i>long time...</i>

410
01:08:31,656 --> 01:08:34,867
Oh my god... oh my god.

411
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:52,427
Katherine?

412
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:23,725
Oh Jesus...

413
01:14:32,225 --> 01:14:33,226
Hey, drop it!

414
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:46,864
Hey drop... drop it...

415
01:14:59,085 --> 01:15:01,838
Drop it!
Drop the knife!

416
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:08,745
Drop the knife, goddammit! This is your
last warning! I will shoot you!

417
01:15:17,019 --> 01:15:18,355
DROP THE KNIFE!!

418
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:29,616
I have Satan...

419
01:15:32,785 --> 01:15:33,911
I have Satan...

420
01:15:34,078 --> 01:15:35,663
I SAID DROP THE KNIFE!

421
01:16:21,668 --> 01:16:23,503
Did you tell her?

422
01:16:24,587 --> 01:16:26,047
Did you tell her all about it?

423
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:27,632
I told her.

424
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,846
When you meet these people,
do you say to them...

425
01:16:34,889 --> 01:16:36,266
do you say that she was murdered?

426
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:37,684
Please!

427
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,477
No, you don't.

428
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:41,145
You don't say

429
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:42,605
that when she was found,

430
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:44,232
they had to do a blood test

431
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,900
to see if her head matched the body.

432
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:46,734
That's enough!

433
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:49,153
Just focus on the road!

434
01:16:49,321 --> 01:16:51,406
Don't touch me!

435
01:17:20,142 --> 01:17:21,394
Can you please pull over?

436
01:17:22,412 --> 01:17:23,688
Huh? What was that?

437
01:17:24,856 --> 01:17:25,982
I think I'm gonna be sick.

438
01:17:26,524 --> 01:17:27,650
Are you alright back there?

439
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:29,110
Please, pull over.

440
01:17:29,469 --> 01:17:33,281
Alright, hold on. Hold on.

441
01:17:33,406 --> 01:17:36,301
Bill, please. Just go past it.
We're not stopping.

442
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,910
Hold on, hold on.

443
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:39,662
Goddammit Bill, don't stop here!

444
01:17:39,904 --> 01:17:42,540
Okay... here we go.

445
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,870
Katherine?

446
01:22:09,807 --> 01:22:11,017
There you are.

447
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,776
You are not wanted here.

448
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:27,409
I say, you will go from this place.

449
01:22:29,994 --> 01:22:31,496
You will leave here.

450
01:22:39,086 --> 01:22:41,548
<i>You will leave this poor girl...</i>

451
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:45,218
<i>and you will never come back</i>

452
01:24:12,472 --> 01:24:14,140
I command that you leave this place.

453
01:24:17,435 --> 01:24:19,479
I command that you go out!

454
01:24:20,938 --> 01:24:22,982
I command that you go out!

455
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:27,111
By the power of Christ!

456
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:28,530
I command you!

457
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:31,824
I command you to leave this girl!

458
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:34,411
And never come back!

459
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:38,960
I command you to go out!

460
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:57,249
Don't go.
