1
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,800
I had to help wash him 
so I saw him naked. 

2
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,160
I never realised 
he was so small, so short

3
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Yes, Inspector...

4
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,920
Judge Varga used to come here
every Sunday.

5
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,912
He liked talking to the mummies.

6
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,560
He'd make the dead reveal
the secrets of the living.

7
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,075
-He'd talk to the mummies?
-Of course.

8
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,397
You're from Rome. There are 
some things you can't understand.

9
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,432
Open it.

10
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
See him?

11
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,315
Bernardo da Corleone
a great 17th century lawyer.

12
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
In those days
the dead person's family

13
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,120
would come and tell 
the deceased their secrets.

14
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,880
And our Don Bernardo,
who at the time was still alive,

15
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,000
would come down 
to the crypt at night

16
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,280
and get the corpses 
to tell him everything.

17
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,319
So he knew everthing
about everybody.

18
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:08,800
Everything about everybody.

19
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,200
"Let me talk about little white jasmines..."
This fatal,just-picked blossom

20
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,637
symbolises the purity
of his existence.

21
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,750
And its scent
evokes the goodness

22
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,200
he brought to the courts
and to his family.

23
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,120
It was this Spring blossom
which caught the last breath

24
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,513
of Judge Varga, who will 
now appear before

25
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,991
the ultimate Judge and be
admitted to His Kingdom.

26
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,270
For thirty years he fought 
against crime and the Mafia,

27
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,100
and the Mafia has killed him.

28
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,800
He was the Mafia!
He was the Mafia!

29
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,800
Organised crime has never
been so daring before.

30
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,909
It's the first time
a judge has been murdered.

31
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,260
Mafia! You're the Mafia!
You're the Mafia!

32
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,280
It's an appalling crime aimed
against the whole judiciary...

33
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,273
and it's a challenge 
to the State's authority!

34
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,677
Why is your name linked to
the dead judge and garbage? 

35
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,755
They attack me
because I was his best friend.

36
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,191
What about the garbage?

37
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,870
Come and have a look.

38
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Hear that?
They're not striking for more pay.

39
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,437
They even have cars to come to work.

40
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,711
They're starting a cholera
epidemic just to screw me.

41
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,358
Where does Judge Varga
come into it?

42
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,920
Varga was murdered because
he was about to arrest them.

43
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,753
Not these wretches,
but their puppeteers.

44
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,477
Give me a hand.
This guy's dead.

45
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,118
He has no pulse.

46
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,120
Judge Varga knew every secret
behind every door.

47
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,360
He had drawers full
of court files.

48
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,512
He acted on some,
but ignored the others.

49
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,080
You were his friend.
You admired him, didn't you?

50
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,240
I liked the man.
He wasn't in it for money.

51
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,280
He thrived on power.

52
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,317
Inspector.
A  phone call from Rome.

53
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Sorry. I need your authorisation 
to move elsewhere right away.

54
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,560
Where?

55
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,240
They killed another judge
some 100km from here

56
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,800
The two crimes 
may be linked.

57
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,590
Go, but keep me informed.
The Minister is concerned.

58
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
Shall we arrest him?

59
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,440
Why?
As usual, they won't talk.

60
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,195
This guy heard nothing,
saw nothing, knows nothing.

61
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,520
Do you get many lemons?

62
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,116
Alot. They want to cut it down 
to build houses

63
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,472
Tell me something ...
Did you know the judge?

64
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,635
Of course. He issued the orders
to resume the farms. 

65
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,235
What was he like?

66
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,753
Like this town...
Just what they wanted.

67
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,357
Sargeant.

68
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,358
Captain.

69
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,473
Is this you?

70
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,591
It might be.

71
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,870
Did you bring us all this way
just to identify a photo?

72
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,640
Why were you at Judge 
Varga's funeral?

73
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,596
Were you a friend too?

74
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,520
We had ceased to be
on friendly terms.

75
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
But when he was 
a junior judge...

76
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,991
When you killed 
that unionist...

77
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,037
Everyone was acquitted.

78
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,440
Sure. But this time
you've gone too far.

79
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,271
You shouln't mess with judges.

80
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,279
Inspector, you're wasting your 
time with us. And you know it.

81
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,358
If it's payback as you call it,
that's between the judges.

82
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,480
Brave Chief Judge Calamo
is dead.

83
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,119
He's the third judge to be killed.

84
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,560
The police do nothing 
to stop this mad slaughter.

85
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,960
And their inertia gives rise
to all sorts of speculation.

86
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,800
We're being killed off and 
our reputations are tarnished.

87
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,430
The judiciary is sound
but parliament is ineffective.

88
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,639
The government is weak.

89
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,950
They're the reason the country
is plunging into chaos.

90
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,992
Find me that raving maniac.

91
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,837
Only a maniac would go around 
killing judges.

92
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,320
Get this into your heads.

93
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,629
As chief of police, 
your head will be the first to roll.

94
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,520
You're our best man , but yours
will be the first head to roll.

95
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,149
Stop the damaging stories
about the murdered judges.

96
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,880
What's this?

97
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,160
The late Chief Judge Calamo
had them in a drawer.

98
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,392
He had several million
in the bank.

99
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,240
What on earth are you doing?

100
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,879
Piecing together three lives.

101
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,920
Don't waste time with the dead.

102
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,200
We need somone
who's alive and guilty.

103
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,320
Stop looking for rationality.

104
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,154
We're dealing with a paranoid.

105
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,519
If he's paranoid,
it's with good reason.

106
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,879
What did you mean by
"paranoid with good reason"?

107
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,840
Three judges have been killed
in twenty days,

108
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,600
in three towns 
quite near each other.

109
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,560
All killed the same way,

110
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,160
by bullets from the same gun,.

111
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,080
which must be a rifle and silencer.

112
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,640
Enough evidence to suggest
a vendetta.

113
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,631
A vendetta?
By whom?

114
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,913
A victim of a judicial error.

115
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,120
Do you know 
whether the three judges

116
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,236
were ever on the same case?

117
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
Yes.They worked together 
for eight years

118
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,395
Doctor. The plane is ready
to take off.

119
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,760
Let me say one more thing.

120
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,800
Actually I knew there'd be 
another killing in this town.

121
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,600
I have'nt made a mistake.

122
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,760
I was here
when they shot Calamo.

123
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,912
Then the papers are right 
You're a jinx.

124
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,240
Anyway, I've come up
with some facts.

125
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,560
Three people from this area

126
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,760
were unjustly sent to jail
for several years.

127
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,320
A chemist whose wife
tricked the judges,

128
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,360
a mechanic rumoured
to be gay,

129
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,480
and a trucker
who's now a hobo.

130
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
So, what's your next step?

131
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,108
One of the trio is the killer.

132
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,400
- How are things?
- Bad.

133
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,312
- What's bad?
- Everything.

134
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,031
- And before?
- Before what ?

135
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,152
Were things better before?

136
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,274
- No.
- So ?

137
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,310
So... Here we are.

138
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,109
What do you think about 
these judges being killed?

139
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,996
Were you sentenced by Varga?

140
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,800
He was the prosecuting judge
in that trial.

141
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,189
He asked for 30 years.

142
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,429
He said he regretted 
there was no death penalty.

143
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,870
Did Judge Sanza 
deliver the sentence?

144
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,760
Judge Sanza gave me
a discount... 27 years.

145
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,753
But he wasn't alone.

146
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,798
I know.
Judge Rasto was there too.

147
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,716
And Rasto is still alive.

148
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,910
What do you want from me?

149
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,790
Later they proved
I was innocent.

150
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,518
True.

151
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,713
You were innocent 
and spent four years in jail.

152
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,636
I've served 52 years 
unjustly.

153
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,713
Spending four in jail
was no big deal.

154
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,876
Jail is a safe place.

155
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,040
- Who's there? What do you want?
- Police.

156
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,000
Leave me alone.
You've made my life miserable.

157
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,036
Enough. Get out of here!

158
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,318
Come here.

159
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,315
Do you remember Judge Varga?
Chief Judge Sanza and the other one Calamo ?

160
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,071
Bastards...
They were all bastards.

161
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,439
And so you killed them.
- I wish I did.

162
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
Do you live here?

163
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,677
Have you a gun?
Go and get it.

164
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,634
You get it.  

165
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,792
Clear off!  
You don't answer me like that. Understand?

166
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,600
What shall we do?

167
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,910
No one's seen him.
He might be sleeping.

168
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,360
Stay here
and keep an eye out for him.

169
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,032
Yes, doctor.

170
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,310
Is Dr Maxia here.

171
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,233
That's me.

172
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Can I help you?

173
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,990
I'm inspector Rogas.
I'd like a word with you.

174
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,353
At your service.

175
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,397
I'll be back shortly.

176
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,630
Please sit down.
Thanks.

177
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,680
This is what I want
to know.

178
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,520
I'm told you're the only friend
of the chemist, Cres.

179
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,920
Friend!

180
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,230
It's hard to use 
the term in Cres' case.

181
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,800
Let's say a frequent caller.

182
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,758
- So you see him often?.
- Yes, yes.

183
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,960
Actually, I'm the one 
who keeps an eye on him.

184
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,480
I try to get him to mix.

185
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,438
with other people.

186
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,120
Seen him today?
- No.

187
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,795
I don't think Cres 
went out at all today.

188
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,040
I knocked on his door
but no one answered.

189
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,520
He ofter pretends
he's not at home.

190
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,440
You mean
it's happened to you too?

191
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,078
Yes, often.

192
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,200
Cres is always 
in the house?

193
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,637
Are you sure he couldn't 
have gone somewhere else.

194
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,720
As far as I know
the only trips Cres takes

195
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,120
are inside the walls
of his own house.

196
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,400


197
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
- See?  He's not here.
- So he does go out?

198
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,100
Then, it's not true that he's
not always here?

199
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,920
Strange.  Maybe he's left.

200
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,549
I'll go see if he switched
the meter off.

201
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,200
What's all this music?

202
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,680
Cres is crazy about tangos.

203
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,478
He collected thousands 
of them, inspector.

204
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,360
Tangos of all kinds,
from lots of places

205
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,909
He's put speakers
all over the house.

206
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,999
This is the wife of Cres.

207
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,240
She used animal welfare
to frame him.

208
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,549
Do you think 
Cres was innocent too?

209
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,549
He prepared
the chocolate rice.

210
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,833
He cooked it quite ofter.
Yes, my husband !

211
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,474
Well then 
do any doubts still linger?

212
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,640
No.  Not unless we think
this poor woman

213
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,156
designed a diabolical scheme
to incriminate her husband.

214
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,520
Even to the extent
of sacrificing a life,

215
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,000
of a poor innocent cat.

216
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,520
For years the only companion
in her lonely existence.

217
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,080
That would be absurd!

218
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,440
He wanted to murder 
his wife.

219
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,230
He set up a fake suicide.
You must find him guilty.

220
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,599
The woman, where is she now ?
Your guess is as good as mine.

221
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,400
She took off 
while he was still in jail.

222
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,868
She stripped half the house,

223
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,630
and left him with her portrait.

224
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,715
And he's placed it 
in front of his bed.

225
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,997
Doctor!

226
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,389
Is the headless figure Cres?

227
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,598
I think so.

228
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,148
Maybe his wife did it
out of spite.

229
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,600
Who was next to you here?

230
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,670
Probably Cres.

231
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,918
Probably?

232
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,554
Don't you have any 
photographs of Cres?

233
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,278
I did have a few,
but he took them all back.

234
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,080
Who is it?
I'm inspector Rogas.

235
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,833
Come in.
The judge is is waiting for you.

236
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,273
Come in.

237
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,435
The police inspector is here.

238
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,720
Your honour.
Good evening.

239
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,631
Inspector Rogas.

240
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,472
Please sit down.
Thank you.

241
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,432
Will you excuse me a moment?
Certainly

242
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,619
Well?

243
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,437
Forgive me for calling
on you at this hour.

244
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,720
But I've been trying in vain
to see Mr Cres, the chemist.

245
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,920
But his house is locked.

246
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,600
And no one is answering.

247
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,593
What do you want 
with the chemist?

248
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,312
Nothing in particular.

249
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,120
I looked up his file.....
a strange case indeed.

250
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,033
I need to put a face to it.

251
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,200
I want to meet the man.

252
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,100
But the Cres trial has no link
with anything nowadays.

253
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,390
It was much talked about.

254
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,995
And the sentence 
was very controversial.

255
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,798
Weren't you one  
of the judges?

256
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,513
I was only the recorder.

257
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,273
The decision was made by 
Judge Varga and Chief Judge Sanza .

258
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,833
And they've both been killed.

259
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,750
Forty metres.

260
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,432
They fired from over there.

261
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,512
Who lives there?

262
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,715
It's a condemned building

263
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,480
A fire was lit
in one of the rooms.

264
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,800
The killer must have spent
the night there.

265
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,078
He must have known
the judges' habit pretty well.

266
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,520
Aren't they removing the corpse?

267
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,760
Doctor, there's an ambulance strike.

268
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,000
We can't find a vehicle.

269
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
Use one of our cars.

270
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,958
Do you need
the union's approval?

271
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,880
Were you really here 
when he was shot?

272
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,960
Not  exactly. 
I saw the judge last night...

273
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,916
but I didn't kill him.

274
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,800
Why did you visit the judge?

275
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,720
Nothing important,
Just routine .

276
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,960
Surely you must have some clues...

277
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,280
It's the fourth since 
you began investigating.

278
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,600
Gentlemen, talk to the local police.

279
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,513
Inspector, our readers
want to know...

280
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,352
Hey!
Ah. Look who's here!

281
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,800
One judge is a police matter,

282
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,076
but kill four, it's political.

283
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,200
So you'll give me
a political interpretation.

284
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,760
Don't you read the papers?
No, especially yours.

285
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,720
Good!
Let's get away from here.

286
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,520
Your colleagues won't
give me peace !

287
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,317
Come on.  
Get into my car!

288
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,800
Too bad you don't read  our paper,
it's the only one defending you.

289
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,908
Defending me.  How ?

290
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,560
We're not into witch hunts.

291
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,520
We are not about raising
tension in the community.

292
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,920
We want to do out jobs.

293
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,629
Without any interference 
from above.

294
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,319
So that's what you write!
Well done. 

295
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,400
At times the police even
suit the Communist Party!

296
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,676
If they all did their job
like you do.

297
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,640
But I do it for you.

298
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,240
We were school mates
and we went fishing together.

299
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,516
But trust your friends.
It's all politics.

300
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,477
It's your government cronies
who play dirty politics.

301
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,833
Listen...
You can be frank with me

302
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,833
- What's behind all this?
- None of what you might think.

303
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,192
Nor of what my government 
gronies think.

304
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,353
I'll tell you a story,
off the record.

305
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,518
A nice story.

306
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:22,510
It's about a man, his wife
and a cat

307
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,630
This one?
No.

308
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,998
This one?

309
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,032
No, I'm afraid not.

310
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,559
This one?

311
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,960
I believe this one resembles
him a little.

312
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,440
But it's only a drawing 
not a photograph!

313
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,400
Enough time's spent on this,
we have to finish!

314
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:49,437
You!
Give me your description again.

315
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,880
Wanted.
A man, 175 cm tall, stocky

316
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,000
with greying brown hair.

317
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,355
perfect teeth,
slightly aquiline nose.

318
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
... JUDGE ASSINATED ...

319
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
... JUDGE PERRO SHOT DEAD
AT 6.30PM IN ROME ...

320
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,080
These brutal and appalling crimes
are an attack on law and order.

321
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,119
MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF STATE

322
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,800
They are the diabolical fruit
of the actions...

323
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,920
of groups of young agitators

324
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,040
who preach violence 
as a means to an end,

325
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,680
and sow seeds of delirium
in weaker minds.

326
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,832
It is time to say
'Enough, we will be strong!'

327
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,269
You saw the assassin?

328
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,974
I heard a shot and saw two 
youths run away. That's all.

329
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,780
You were just passing by 
at that moment?

330
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,760
Yes but I heard nothing, though.

331
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,400
I was on my bicyle when
two youths knocked me over.

332
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,120
Why were you at the scene 
of the crime ?

333
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,280
I was in the basement, 
I'm a printer.

334
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,520
I went upstairs to get
a little fresh air.

335
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,876
I heard a woman shout and
saw him on a bicycle.

336
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,600
At last! While you waste 
your time on your little toy.

337
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,960
chasing your phantom
lunatic, the true killer

338
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:46,111
is exterminating judges, leaving
the country in a state of panic.

339
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:51,640
Actually, it was you who mentioned 
lunatics. You came here to tell me.

340
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,640
But you were there and had
to see what wasn't there.

341
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,868
Meaning?

342
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,440
Pleas sit down.

343
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,200
I was saying they were everywhere.

344
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,080
At Varga's funeral, 
where Sanza was killed...

345
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,469
They even set up camp.

346
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:12,040
A demonstation and a camp site
don't prove murder.

347
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,640
What about the eyewitnesses?

348
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,280
There were eyewitnesses 
to Judge Perro's murder?

349
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,600
Nobody seen him shot, they
saw someone run away.

350
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,840
Enough talk.
You're an excellent detective.

351
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,680
The best criminal investigator
we've got.

352
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,840
But this now is
a political affair.

353
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,680
We have already made 
too many mistakes.

354
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,360
It is imperative firstly to 
restore the good name of the police.

355
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,080
You will work with the 
political squad..

356
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,150
and collaborate with Inspector Bloma.

357
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,919
This way.

358
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,154
Get this to the Minister quickly
Yes Sir.

359
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
The telephone calls are
continuously recorded?

360
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,000
But where're all the 
tapes stored?

361
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,440
Don't you worry!

362
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,592
After they're of value to the 
Justice Ministry they destroy them.

363
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,712
Rogas, come here a minute!

364
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,160
Isn't that your friend there?

365
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,390
The communist journalist?

366
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,880
- Is he being watched too?
- No, only his leader... Amar.

367
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,920
"Times are difficult."

368
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,760
"This meeting must end 
with a clear decision."

369
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,920
"A party like ours can't
be surprised...

370
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,434
and influenced by the actions
of the government."

371
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,234
Let's see what are they
sending us now.

372
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,836
Ah the Justice builings.

373
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,760
"Then, the chancillor, wrote:
The demand, response:"

374
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,760
"I have been coming to the 
capital all these months..."

375
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,480
"I brought cheques from 
the petroleum companies...

376
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,880
to the secretariate of
the Christian Democratic Party"

377
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,200
"who then distributes them 
according to the quota..

378
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,360
to all the other parties,
except the Communist party"

379
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,320
"Nothing to the Communists ?
"To the Communists, no."

380
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,791
"To some affilliates of theirs
but not much"

381
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,280
Senta! Put in the tape of
the shooting of the Z Group.

382
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,800
Si, doctor.

383
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,800
We are monitoring this group's
publications, in the last 6 months.

384
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,280
And we focus on articles..

385
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,795
that attack Magistrates and Judges.

386
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,395
Can I have the article 
from Permanent Revolution?

387
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,713
Thanks.

388
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,955
It's the newspaper 
of the Group Z.

389
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,560
This is Galano, head of Group Z.
The most fanatical.

390
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,800
Listen what he has 
writen about judges!

391
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,320
The article is tittled
"The Monsters"

392
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,240
"Bony and withered, often
obese and flaccid...

393
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,000
"their faces marked by
infamy of their office,

394
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,040
every year dressed like clowns
as bishops don't dare.

395
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,680
They're the high magistrates
who inaugurate the judicial year

396
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,880
telling us to lock more 
people up."

397
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,080
- Stand up!
- Me?

398
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,877
Yes you, stand up.

399
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,911
- Start walking.
- Where?

400
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,109
Walk up and down
until we tell you to stop.

401
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,154
Turn round
Start walking

402
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,320
Start walking

403
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,039
Do you recognise him?
Is it him?

404
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,557
¡ Derecho ! Turn round

405
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,480
Start Walking
¡ Adelante !

406
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,675
¡ Muevete !

407
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,072
Do you recognise him?
Is it him?

408
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,229
Back to square one.

409
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,520
The two youths bumped into you
and you fell off your bicycle.

410
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,956
I didn't say I fell.
I was knocked over.

411
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,080
Same thing.  You saw them
run away.

412
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,120
The darker guy was limping.

413
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,236
I didn't see any dark guy.

414
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,560
It does'nt matter.
But he did have a limp.

415
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,720
Maybe.  It was so quick.

416
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,994
One moment.  How quick?

417
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,960
As a flash.
Then they got into the car.

418
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,720
A car?
You never mentioned a car.

419
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,271
You never gave me a chance.  You
kept asking about those youths.

420
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,431
Bring the girl here.

421
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,918
Sit here.

422
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,080
- You saw the car, didn't you ?
- What car?

423
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,520
The car in the street 
when Judge Perro was shot.

424
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,840
Ah yes, the big foreign car.

425
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,637
How do you mean foreign?

426
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,520
Why didn't you tell us
about the car?

427
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,476
So what if there was a car?

428
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,200
I see so many cars in a day.
They're part of my job.

429
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,636
- Was the car parked?
- Yes. It was.

430
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,320
I went up to it to see if
I could do some business...

431
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,916
That's why I noticed
it was big, nice and foreign.

432
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,555
- Switzerland
- Then?

433
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,959
Nothing. They started 
the engine and took off.

434
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,080
- With the youths?
- What youths?

435
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,080
Those hippies.
They suddenly started running.

436
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,040
I saw them get into the car. 

437
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,280
What is he talking about ?

438
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,239
When the car took off,
the hippies ran away on foot.

439
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,040
Okay, let's start from scratch.

440
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,600
This is your statement.
I'll read it to you.

441
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,760
'' At 6pm on the 25th,

442
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,320
in front of the
Justice Building.

443
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,520
I was about to
cross the street,...

444
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,200
when I noticed my
shoe strap was undone.

445
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,520
I bent down to do it up
and heard a shot."

446
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,680
- Then?
- I turned around.

447
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,500
- What did you see?
- Two youths ran into this guy.

448
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,280
- And then?
- They ran off up the street

449
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,320
- And the car?
- Went in the opposite direction

450
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,880
Ha! He couldn't have 
seen anything...

451
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,400
because he was leaning 
over the dead man.

452
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,480
I insist.
They got into the car.

453
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,349
You were shit scared.
You didn't see anything.

454
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,550
Listen Bloma,
I have thought it over carefully

455
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,440
I won't work with someone else.

456
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,320
Even the chief thought
I wasn't right for this.

457
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,754
Maybe you have a point.

458
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,790
A break will do you good.

459
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:52,160
Yes but first I have
to ease my conscience.

460
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,357
I have to tell a guy
he's about to die.

461
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,553
Good morning,inspector.

462
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,160
May I speak to 
Chief Judge Riches?

463
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,388
Who are you? 

464
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,597
I am inspector Rogas.

465
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,158
Wait here.

466
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,520
Inspector.

467
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,880
Come back tomorrow.
He can't see you now.

468
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:36,108
Okay.

469
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,520
That car it's the 
Police Commissioner's?

470
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,910
- Is he with the judge ?
-  And why are you asking? 

471
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,800
It's not for me.  But at least
get in touch with the boy.

472
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,800
By the way the school fees are due.

473
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:26,440
Don't worry.  You know I've
been away.  I'll do it tomorrow.

474
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,640
Marco says he never sees you.

475
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,840
- When did you see him?
- Last Sunday.

476
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,800
- Was he all right?
- Yes, he was fine.

477
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,394
Don't forget the college fees.
Yes yes, bye.

478
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,434
And now a news update

479
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,440
General De Sarmiento
was today appointed

480
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,238
Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces

481
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,240
He was sworn in 
before the joint chiefs

482
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,028
of the air force, the army
and the navy.

483
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,880
The ceremony was followed 
by a military parade

484
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,235
which included 
a special police unit.

485
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,635
Various diplomats
were in attendance...

486
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,480
General de Sarmiento
was today appointed

487
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,550
Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces.

488
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,400
He was sworn in 
before the joint chiefs

489
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,836
of the air force, the army
and the navy.

490
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,600
- Is that Rogas? 
- Yes. Good evening doctor.

491
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,560
Why did you visit Riches?

492
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,400
To warn him he's in danger.

493
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,520
So you're still insisting
in chasing your lunatic.

494
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:49,560
The judge will be killed
in any case.

495
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,232
The chief judge 
is well protected.

496
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,960
I know. Today I saw all the 
security forces at Riches'.

497
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,076
I even spotted your car.

498
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,200
We were'nt with Riches.

499
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:06,113
We had a function next door
at the Portuguse Embassy.

500
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,760
Okay, go and see Riches,..

501
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,149
but don't alarm him.

502
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,200
- Hello
- Hello. The Portuguese Embassy?

503
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,320
- Yes, who's speaking?
- I'm the police commissioner's chauffeur.

504
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:14,960
My boss forgot his 
briefcase at today's function.

505
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,940
What function was that ?

506
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,117
The ambassador is away in Lisbon.

507
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,199
Sorry.  It must be a mistake.
Thanks.

508
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,040
- Yes?
- It's Rogas.

509
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,400
- Hi.
- I need a favour.

510
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,040
Find the owner of a white
mercedes with Swiss plates.

511
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,440
Any other details?

512
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,878
First two numbers are 9 and 7.
You find out the others.

513
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,592
Sit down.

514
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,756
So.  You think I'll be killed.

515
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,880
Yes.  I believe they'll try.

516
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,080
The subversives 
or that other guy?

517
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,150
The other guy... Cres.

518
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,192
Ah, That's right....

519
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,992
The chemist.

520
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,640
He tried to kill his wife,
His plan was too naive.

521
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,960
What did he get?

522
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,000
5 years, upheld by you 
on appeal.

523
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:57,718
Not by me.

524
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,994
I meant by the court 
over which you presided.

525
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:03,996
So!

526
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,959
- He was innocent.
- Really?

527
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,188
I think he was.

528
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,520
Was he innocent,..

529
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,195
or do you just think he was?

530
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,433
I do think he was innocent,
but I can't be sure.

531
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,873
I see...
You can't be sure about it.

532
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,560
Yes, I have a doubt.

533
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:41,016
I think it was an error,
a judicial error.

534
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,796
Judicial errors don't exist.

535
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,360
- You're a practising Catholic?
- Pracising, no.

536
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,433
A Catholic nevertheless.
Sure, like everyone else.

537
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,112
I presume you go to mass
from time to time.

538
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,200
Ever considered the issue
of bread and wine,..

539
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,988
turning into the body 
and blood of Christ?

540
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,676
Each time...

541
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,800
Each time the priest eats 
that bread,..

542
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,677
and drinks that wine,
the mystery is fulfilled

543
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:37,316
That must always happen.
It can never be otherwise.

544
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,960
The priest may be unworthy
in thought or deed,

545
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,320
but simply due to 
the status he holds,..

546
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:50,240
each time the mass is celebrated

547
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,276
the mystery is fulfilled.

548
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,560
When a judge delivers the law,..

549
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,400
he is exactly like a priest
officiating at mass.

550
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,640
A judge may have doubts
he may question himself,

551
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,631
even torment himself,.

552
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:22,189
but at the very moment
he delivers judgement,..

553
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,594
he can't harbour doubts. At
that moment justice is done.

554
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,518
Always?

555
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:36,480
One priest celebrating mass
had blood on his hands.

556
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,120
Because he had doubts.
That has never happened to me.

557
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:43,720
No judgement has ever
left blood on my hands.

558
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:46,075
No conviction has ever 
left blood on my gown.

559
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,668
It's obviously a question
of faith.

560
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,113
I don't think you've
quite understood.

561
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,430
I'm not a Catholic.
Nor am I a Christian.

562
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,440
However, I've never had any
of these weaknesses.

563
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,120
I've never believed in Voltaire's
"Tratado sobre la tolerancia"

564
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,560
on tolerance and judicial error.

565
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,800
Virtue, pity, innocent victims 
of judicial errors....

566
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,392
What errors?

567
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:24,193
A judge who can freely kill
with his sentences...Ba!

568
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:29,200
Voltaire was the first to sow
doubt about the judicial system.

569
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,800
When a religion allows
for people's doubt,..

570
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,720
that religion is dead.

571
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:42,000
That's why we had Sartre, 
Bertrand Russell, Marcuse...

572
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,520
and the delirium of
today's youth.

573
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,193
You mean Voltaire is to blame?

574
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,395
Yes.  But Voltaire had an excuse.

575
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,160
In his day they didn't realise
the danger of those ideas...

576
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:00,680
but today's mass culture has
made that danger mortal.

577
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,800
If things go on like this,
the only viable form of justice

578
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,160
will be a form of punishment
known in war as decimation.

579
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,811
The way I punish is to kill
one soldier in ten.

580
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,360
Today there are no more individuals!

581
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,955
Today, there is no more 
individual responsibility!

582
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,720
Your job, my dear friend
has become ridiculous.

583
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,480
It was fine in peace time,
but now we're at war.

584
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:29,120
Robberies, kidnappings,
sabotage...  This is war!

585
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,829
And as in war the answer is decimation.

586
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,714
One, two, three, four, five...
Out!

587
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,913
One, two, three, four, five...
Cres, convicted!

588
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,120
Cres has a .22 calibre rifle,..

589
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,190
and it is loaded with
a bullet for you.

590
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:27,510
Keep going.  Back all the way.
Park down there.

591
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,835
Go on! Go on! Stop!

592
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,560
Who lives below Judge Riches?

593
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,760
- Mr Pattos..
- The shipping tycoon?

594
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,239
Yes.

595
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,637
Inspector.

596
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,837
Mr Pattos.

597
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,198
What are you doing here?

598
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,760
- Sorry, I didn't think...
- What did you not think?

599
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,640
That you'd meet me 
in my friend Pattos' place?

600
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:35,720
I didn't think I'd be intruding 
in a reunion of frieds.

601
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,029
Too late now.  So?

602
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,635
- I was looking for someone.
- Looking for me?

603
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,280
No, someone who just come in.

604
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,033
One of my guests?
Please come in.

605
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,952
Come with me.

606
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,233
The inspector
was surely looking for me.

607
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,596
Are you here to arrest me?

608
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,472
My dear Evaristo,
you are a big liar..

609
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,160
You always denied the police
tapped our phones.

610
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,960
The inspector's presence here
proves my case.

611
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,077
- Is this right?
- Not that I know of.

612
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,280
How amazing!

613
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,512
Did he expect to get any other answer?

614
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,680
I know nothing about phone tapping.

615
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,000
It is done sometimes,..

616
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,640
but always with prior judicial approval,..

617
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,840
and only criminal suspects are tapped.

618
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,072
It is never done for political 
reasons.  Never..

619
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,280
That means I'm a criminal suspect,..

620
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,120
because my phone is definately tapped.

621
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,280
In fact, it's not even my phone.

622
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,000
The phone belongs to my host, Norcio,
There,here's the great progressive writer.

623
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,560
No, No.  You're not my guest
you're the guest of my wife.

624
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,520
I'd never take an arsehole
like you into my house...

625
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,520
a provincial intellectual like you!

626
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,360
They brag on about permanent revolution...

627
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,120
You wish the inspector
had come here to arrest you.

628
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,040
Then you'd be a hero.

629
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,280
- Wilfredo, Don't be ridiculous!
- Shut your mouth!

630
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,920
What a reactionary remark
'Shut your mouth'.

631
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,000
Just because I'm your wife,
because you're my husband!

632
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,549
No. Because you're a parrot,
not a woman!

633
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,160
There's nothing can be done.  You're
a typical communist, catholic, bourgeois.

634
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:38,790
Yes, for a long time, not to
keep up with the latest fashion!

635
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:44,000
Now that we are winning,
communists, catholics, the bourgeoisie,..

636
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,549
you're all queueing up to jump
on the bandwagon! 

637
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,029
No my dear, I don't like it!

638
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,309
Including you and that arsehole
who wanted revolution!

639
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,120
Hello,hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Mo more of these family quarrels.

640
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,237
We're here to enjoy ourselves..
to eat.

641
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,474
Champagne?

642
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,240
- a whisky ?
- No, thanks.

643
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,471
Have a drink, Rogas.
You're not on duty.

644
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:20,799
Your assignment here is over.

645
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,630
Come with me..

646
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,228
To them it's a game.

647
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,037
- A game?  I wouldn't say so..
- Yes, yes a game.

648
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,236
Including me, 
I'm playing the game too..

649
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,836
I'm like a umpire...

650
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,750
delivering both protection and threats..

651
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,040
Don't let appearances fool you, Rogas.

652
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:18,716
Despite the confidence, they're
still scared.

653
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,520
More scared than they've ever been.

654
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,000
When the party's over 
they'll flee in all directions.

655
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,956
No one will sleep
in their beds tonight.

656
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,360
Who do they fear?

657
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,840
They think you coming here was
part of a plot...

658
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,833
and your sudden appearance 
was planned.

659
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:45,680
My dear Rogas, subversive groups
like Calano's are useful to us.

660
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,911
And to our Communist Party friends.

661
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,719
Friends?

662
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,551
Your know what the 
situation is like.

663
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,920
My party, which has run 
the country for 30 years,..

664
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,760
will be forced to rule 
with the Communists.

665
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,480
Your own job would be easier,
Rogas

666
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,520
if Mr Amar, that party's leader,
was in my chair.

667
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,000
This ministry would work.

668
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,400
It'd be fun to see Mr Amar 
and his party

669
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,039
grappling with these groups.

670
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,560
Yes, well. And what should we do?

671
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,680
Continue harassing these groups
as much as you can.

672
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,960
Arests, controls, searches...

673
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,240
but always with the approval
of the judges.

674
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,680
Before they're all killed!

675
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,200
If you're here to arrest Galano?

676
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:41,033
At least give us back our minister!

677
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,114
Hang around, Rogas. We
will continue our conversation.

678
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,832
Hot coffee and cold milk.

679
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,271
Waiter, a whisky.

680
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,470
Find out who they are 
and what they want from me.

681
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,193
How can I? 
We're always being watched.

682
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,638
If they find out, 
I'm finished.

683
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,840
I didn't tell you to do 
it inside.

684
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:42,520
Why not use your own lab?
You did it with the oil bosses.

685
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,431
Give me a cigarette.

686
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,433
Come on, give me one.

687
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:49,073
Thanks.

688
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,354
Placing a bug
under the commissioner's arse.

689
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,758
I'm fucked!

690
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,874
And now, Minister, allow me
to address a burning issue.

691
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,960
Ever since I left the house of the
president of the Supreme Court,..

692
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,960
I have the feeling that I'm being
followed by professionals.

693
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:24,200
By people specifically suited
to that task.

694
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:28,193
As if trained in a state or
private police corps.

695
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,640
If people in high places,
deem it necessary,..

696
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,240
to give me protection,...

697
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,800
I can only be grateful, ...

698
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,640
but I should point out 
that such surveillance,...

699
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:45,200
which is very expensive 
with so many officers involved,...

700
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,988
would be better directed 
at protecting the judges.

701
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,950
You'll never get out of here
unless you confess first!

702
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,829
And that goes for everbody!

703
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:49,500
To the Security Minister

704
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,360
It's the tanks.
Their motors run all night.

705
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:37,750
The meeting's at 
the armoured division barracks.

706
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,757
Listen, this is him.

707
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:48,194
Take it easier
with those judges...

708
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,910
Rewind, Rewind.
Play it again.

709
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,873
Those judges..

710
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,757
Take it easier 
with those judges...

711
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:07,429
Rogas is on our back.
He's smelt a rat.

712
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,272
Come on, once more.

713
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:19,250
Those judges
714
01:36:20:100 --> 01:36:23,400
Take it easier,
with those judges.

714
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:27,100
Rogas is on our back.
He's smelt a rat.

715
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,389
- Is that it?
- Isn't that enough?

716
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,440
- Is that you, Rogas?
- Yes, good evening, doctor.

717
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,560
Why did you visit Riches?

718
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,676
To warn him he's in danger.

719
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,400
So you're still insisting 
in chasing your lunatic.

720
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,960
The judge will be killed whether
it's by my lunatic or your group.

721
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,315
The judge is well protected.

722
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:17,360
I know. Today I saw all the 
security forces at Riches'.

723
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,476
I even spotted your car.

724
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,591
It's a plot.

725
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:18,077
The chemist Cres killed his judges,
and now they keep killing the others.

726
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:24,075
We come across so many plots,
they prepare one a day.

727
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,480
We've managed to 
keep them in check so far.

728
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:31,234
But this time you've got to
do something fast.

729
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,440
We must wait,..

730
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,920
We can't risk everything
by behaving rashly..

731
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,560
You don't understand.

732
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:41,760
I'm not saying you pre-empt
their counter-revolution,..

733
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,880
but just inform parliament
or the press.

734
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,600
We can't alarm everyone..

735
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,560
because you have 
certain impressions.

736
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:53,156
What impressions?  I have proof.
They're all implicated.

737
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,718
If that's the case, it's no use
discussing it any further.

738
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,160
You must see Amar.

739
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,960
Only the party secretary
can decide.

740
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,598
Amar is like all the others.

741
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,760
In a room of the National Gallery...

742
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,960
a groupe of visitors
discovered two bodies.

743
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:39,200
The police have now 
identified the victims...

744
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:42,880
Mr Amar, the secretary of
the Communist Party,

745
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,600
and police inspector
Amerigo Rogas.

746
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:50,720
Both victims were probably shot
with the same weapon,

747
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:54,918
a gun which Inspector Rogas
was still holding in his hand.

748
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,796
Here's the chief of police's
interpretation

749
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:04,280
Inspector Rogas had just return
from a very stressful mission...

750
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:08,240
to find the judges killer,

751
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:12,320
When he returned to the capital he
showed signs of mental imbalance.

752
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,040
As a result 
he was placed on leave.

753
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,280
He was seeing plots everywhere.

754
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:21,120
and started looking for
non-existent evidence.

755
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:25,800
Perhaps he thought even the
secretary of the Communist Party...

756
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:30,600
was part of some
imaginary plot.

757
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,149
He killed him and then
turned the gun on himself.

758
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,330
So it seems we've accepted
their version.

759
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,148
Everything points to him
being the killer.

760
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:05,600
I don't believe it, I knew Rogas well.
He was no lunatic. There was a plot.

761
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,320
They felt so confident,
they went all the way.

762
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:12,800
And now they have invented
the ultimate provocation.

763
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,792
A police inspector
kills the party secretary.

764
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,280
Even if that's so,
what do you want?

765
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,080
A civil war?
A confrontation?

766
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:25,120
No
But we won't be accomplices.

767
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:30,100
What accomplices?  What would we be
if we took part in their game.

768
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:33,834
Incite the people in the square?
This is wh1at they want?

769
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:46,717
So people will never know
the truth.

770
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,515
Truth is not always revolutionary.
