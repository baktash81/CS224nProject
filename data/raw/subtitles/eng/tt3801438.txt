1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:11,045
[typing sounds]

2
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,754
Meow.

3
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,724
* Deck the halls
with boughs of holly, *

4
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,594
* fa la la la la la
la la la... *

5
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:32,466
* This the season to be jolly, *

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,735
* Don we now our...

7
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,404
Mmm, no.

8
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,206
That song makes my tail hurt.

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,240
Deck the halls?

10
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:48,082
Deck me in the face.

11
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:49,517
* I want a hippop
Now that's a Christmas song.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,286
Hello, hi, how are you?

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,722
Welcome to Grumpy Cat's
Worst Christmas Ever.

14
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,624
The movie.

15
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,192
You don't have to watch it

16
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,628
but I know you're going to, so.

17
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,464
If you do you might
be treated to

18
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,234
high speed car chases.

19
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,301
[sirens wailing]

20
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:08,369
Meow, meow!

21
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,770
Out of my way buddy!!

22
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,504
Pull over, Grumpy!!

23
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:12,806
We've got you surrounded.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,276
Huge explosions.

25
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,278
Boom.

26
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,612
Bang.

27
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,448
That was huge.

28
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,884
A hero in a leotard and cape
who saves the world.

29
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,686
And who doesn't look like
a puppet.

30
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,591
At all.

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,362
* Anyway, I only mention those
things to get your hopes up.

32
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,730
That way I can enjoy
your disappointment

33
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,701
when you realize this movie
is just a sappy melodrama

34
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,472
mostly about me, Grumpy Cat.

35
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:54,548
You're welcome.

36
00:01:54,548 --> 00:02:04,558
You're welcome.

37
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,484
God, this is already annoying.

38
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:33,721
Anyway, our terrible story
begins here.

39
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,825
At this big thing called a mall.

40
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,928
It's a soul sucking bastion
of consumerism

41
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,198
which serves to drain people's
bank accounts

42
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:47,401
and alienate them from
the true meaning of life.

43
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,670
In other words I love it.

44
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,339
Look at me, see?

45
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,740
See? Can't you tell
that I love it?

46
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,542
I love it because it's evil,
okay?

47
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,946
This is where I call home.

48
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:12,726
Customer!

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,461
Customer!

50
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,262
Customer!

51
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,429
Choose me!
Choose me!

52
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:16,664
I never get chosen.

53
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,931
Grovelers.

54
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,733
They all think some human
is going to walk in here

55
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,835
and purchase one of them.

56
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:22,936
Ha!

57
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,639
Welcome to Whiskers,
where the animals don't bite...

58
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,275
Unless provoked.

59
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,676
Humph!!!

60
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,912
Over here, pick me!

61
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,615
Don't buy into the hype
about snakes!

62
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,616
That's Carla.

63
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,618
The happiest snake
on the planet.

64
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,721
So, you know,
already not a big fan.

65
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,590
I am totally cool, promise.

66
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:43,424
Hey lady!

67
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,592
Over here!

68
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,793
I'm cuter!

69
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,296
Plus I chew chair legs,
shoes, leather purses.

70
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,997
Darn, almost had her.

71
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,532
That's Jacky.

72
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,867
He's super hyper
and super annoying,

73
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,470
plus he's a dog, so...

74
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,005
I don't like him.

75
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,973
You can ignore them, madam.

76
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,410
I'm well bred and well read.

77
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,811
I can even talk.

78
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,513
Hands in the air, sucker!

79
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,281
So, that's Wilson.

80
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,582
A very stupid parrot.

81
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,785
Oh, did I mention that
I'm easy to clean up after?

82
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,622
All I require is a newspaper
subscription for the mess

83
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,357
I make in my cage.

84
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,791
Wait, where are you going?

85
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,327
Oh drat.

86
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,728
Not going to happen, people.

87
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,929
We're all going to die in here.

88
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,398
Hey, check out this spin class
of one, lady!

89
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,833
See these hamster hamstrings?

90
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,636
They're like sinewy
pistons of steel.

91
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,837
That's Lance.

92
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,940
He looks like a rat but
I guess he's a gerbil,

93
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,309
a gym rat gerbil.

94
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,744
Woo, work it down, work it up!

95
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,945
Take it up, work it back!

96
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,313
Work it down, work it up!

97
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:40,781
Take it up, work it back!

98
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,516
Me, I don't want to leave.

99
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,885
I'm grumpy right where I am.

100
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,055
Better not to get your hopes up.

101
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,424
Told you, she's just buying
fish food.

102
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,460
Grumpy, you are a jerk.

103
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,528
And you, honey, are delusional.

104
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:57,465
At least we weren't returned
twice like you, Grumpy.

105
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,732
Twice.

106
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,334
All she does is frown.

107
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:01,802
And all he does is whine
about it,

108
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,936
am I right mom?

109
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,774
She does seem a little grumpy.

110
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,610
Can I trade her for a fish?

111
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,044
As if that bothered me.

112
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,347
I never even think
about those people.

113
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,648
I'm a superstar.

114
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:21,789
*

115
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,793
Super model, super dog,
super hair, super fur.

116
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,730
*

117
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,700
Oh, I just love me.

118
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,667
What the heck are you?

119
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,769
A science experiment gone bad?

120
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,071
More like a science
experiment gone right.

121
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,875
Check out my beautiful locks,
they flow like a waterfall.

122
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,511
Woosh!!

123
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,379
Freak.

124
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,013
Customer!

125
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,047
Customer!

126
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,082
I'm available!

127
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,050
Customer, over here!

128
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,386
Choose me, choose me!!

129
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,555
Hi, you must be Marcus.

130
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,056
I'm Gill Brockman,
your new mall rep.

131
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,324
What can I do for you?

132
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,394
There's just the small matter
of your rent being in arrears,

133
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:01,762
deadbeat.

134
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,965
Uh, did you just call me
a deadbeat?

135
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,800
Deadbeat? No, of course not.

136
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,002
[chuckles]

137
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,671
Loser.

138
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,540
Okay, now I heard you
call me a loser.

139
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:13,807
Why would I call you that?

140
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,476
I don't know.

141
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,711
Because you haven't met
your financial obligations

142
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:20,013
in a timely manner and
I'm going to evict you?

143
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,248
Wait, what?

144
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,617
Are you saying I could lose
my terrible home?

145
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,619
Gill, I can assure you
I will have your money

146
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:26,887
by the day after tomorrow.

147
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,456
Thank you, Marcus.

148
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,623
You're a saviour.

149
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:34,695
You are seriously behind,
how do you plan to do that?

150
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,763
You see this cat?

151
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:36,830
Who, me?

152
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,165
I plan to make her the most
famous internet meme

153
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,767
of all time.

154
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,636
Work it, show me sexy.

155
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,638
Now show me danger,
just like that.

156
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,540
Show me fierce.

157
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,775
Jubilation.

158
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:48,842
Overjoyed.

159
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,779
You're a little girl
on a spring day.

160
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,180
Sushi.

161
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:56,850
Lots of sushi.

162
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,051
I'm a natural.

163
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,488
All we need is a picture of
Grumpy saying something like

164
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,823
uh I had fun once, it was awful.

165
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:03,824
[laughs]

166
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,092
I mean, you put that on
the internet thingamabob

167
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,660
and that is sure to go viral.

168
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,529
Her face will launch
a thousand products.

169
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:09,930
Everything from t-shirts
to coffee mugs.

170
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:16,470
After that, TV appearances
and oh, I don't know, maybe

171
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:19,139
a Lifetime movie.

172
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,241
You are a genius!

173
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,043
Like any of that would
really happen.

174
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,845
Me? Become an internet
celebrity?

175
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,814
I mean, wouldn't I need
to have some sort of talent

176
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,015
like this guy?

177
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:33,153
*

178
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,089
Or this weirdo?

179
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,026
Or whatever this is?

180
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,028
Yeah, I can't do any
of that stuff.

181
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,931
So, I'm revising the previous
scene, okay?

182
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,503
You are seriously behind,
how do you plan to do that?

183
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,204
With this dog.

184
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,506
Hi there.

185
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,041
Oh, is that what you are.

186
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:56,510
He just happens to be the
most expensive Leonberger

187
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,678
in the world.

188
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,547
Let that sink in, kitty cat.

189
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,281
Someone would actually
pay for you?

190
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,883
He's worth a million dollars,
whoops.

191
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,151
Shut the front door.

192
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,619
Shut the back door too.

193
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,854
Shut all the doors.

194
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,889
A million? Really?

195
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,290
With an M?

196
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,060
That sounds like a MacGuffin
to me, whatever that means.

197
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,595
I call that a bargain.

198
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,897
I should be worth a billion,
with a B.

199
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,831
Buh.

200
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,699
I've got a buyer and guess
what that money

201
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,301
is going to put me back
in the black.

202
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,270
[air guitar sounds]

203
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,538
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

204
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:28,308
I think the words you're
looking for are thank you.

205
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,509
Yeah, the press are coming
by this afternoon

206
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:34,548
and they're doing a big story
on how he saved Whiskers.

207
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:35,515
Yeah.

208
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,285
Then I guess we have nothing
else to discuss.

209
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,252
Too de loo.

210
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,654
Merry Christmas!

211
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,055
Loser.

212
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,190
What did you say?

213
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,257
What did I say?

214
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,827
Merry Christmas, sir.

215
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,128
Merry Christmas.

216
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,001
Deadbeat.

217
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,007
Um, we didn't formally meet.

218
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,774
I'm Jo-Jo.

219
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,276
Oh, my name is I don't care.

220
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,013
Oh, yes.

221
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,950
Wait a minute, that thing
gets the prime real estate?

222
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,019
Oh, this is where I belong.

223
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,655
In the spotlight for all to see.

224
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,189
Go ahead, feel free
to take photos.

225
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,190
Selfies are extra.

226
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,792
What am I, tuna tartare?

227
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:20,227
I've never had that spot.

228
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,662
And I've been here the longest!

229
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,831
Maybe it's because
you don't smile.

230
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,966
Brat.

231
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,969
Time to meet our awful
movie's heroine.

232
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,370
There she is, look at her.

233
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,172
Hahaha!

234
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,074
With second billing behind me,

235
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,210
Aubrey Plaza as Grumpy Cat.

236
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,179
This is Crystal.

237
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,249
Humanity's last hope
on a dying planet.

238
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,384
Oh, I'm sorry, too much?

239
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,055
Alright, she's an evolved
organism with a heart of gold.

240
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,124
My least favourite trait
but facts are facts.

241
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,094
And this story is nothing
if not factual.

242
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,831
You know, like Santa Claus.

243
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:58,866
Hey Roger!

244
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,835
Hello Crystal!

245
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:02,736
You're fat.

246
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,337
You're not exactly anorexic.

247
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,040
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

248
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,375
Yo Mat, what's up?

249
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,810
Living the dream.

250
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:10,878
Hey Monica.

251
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,680
Hey Crystal, how was
school today?

252
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,948
[raspberry]

253
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,349
Ola, Alejandro.

254
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:18,051
Como estas?

255
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,219
Feliz Navidad!

256
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,159
Here's your turkey and swiss,
Wiffledorf.

257
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,797
I will be Jesse again in a few
hours when I get off work.

258
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,066
Oh, you'll always be Wiffledorf
to me.

259
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,001
Ouch.

260
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:36,203
Speaking of which my feet
are killing me.

261
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,905
Any chance you can use
your in with Santa

262
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,973
to get mama a new pair of shoes
for Christmas?

263
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,143
Blah, blah, blah, b-story,
not my line, not my line,

264
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,244
not my line.

265
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,478
Meow.

266
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,181
I would but Santa and I are
not on speaking terms right now.

267
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,116
What? Why?

268
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,183
Guy's a slave driver.

269
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,184
Always on our backs.

270
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,120
You would not believe
the working conditions.

271
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:53,987
Really?

272
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,756
Two words. Sweat shop.

273
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,826
So, I've actually led a revolt
to unionize the North Pole.

274
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,227
Will you get it worked out
before Christmas?

275
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,696
I hope so.

276
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,897
For the tots.

277
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,966
Dude, are you ever going
to eat that sandwich?

278
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,334
Mmm, is that turkey?

279
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,236
But that's not to say that
a certain little elf

280
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,105
wouldn't love to build you a
new pair while he's on strike.

281
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,206
Be careful flirting with me.

282
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,407
Last time that happened it ended

283
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,010
in a spectacularly
awful divorce.

284
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,211
Huh.

285
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,083
Have you given any more thought
to the party tonight?

286
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,351
Everyone's coming.

287
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,053
You mean, like the other elves?

288
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,420
The Cinnabon crew?

289
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,856
That's exactly who I mean.

290
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,924
All the cool kids.

291
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,794
Come on, stupid Christmas games,
ugly sweater contest.

292
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,396
Oh, just say yes already mom.

293
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,232
The poor guy's been trying
to ask you out for a month.

294
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,204
Alright.

295
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,072
Yes!

296
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,106
I'll go.

297
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,908
But only if you come with me.

298
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,842
Ulgh!

299
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,479
Fine.

300
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,083
But don't try and pull anything,
I'll be watching.

301
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:56,884
Crystal.

302
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,318
I've got to go I'm late
for work.

303
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,053
Hang on.

304
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,223
We talked about you making
some friends at your new school.

305
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,491
How's that going?

306
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:08,095
Great, today I totally nodded to
the girls locker next to mine.

307
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,129
Does that count?

308
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,131
Totally try harder.

309
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,867
Okay. Can I go now?

310
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,806
Isn't she a little young
to have a job?

311
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:19,973
Oh, that's just
what she calls it.

312
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,809
She's helping out
at the pet store.

313
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,510
I just wish she hung out
with some actual people

314
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,012
for a change you know.

315
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,947
One's her own age preferably.

316
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,549
Probably just needs time.

317
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,020
This will be her first Christmas
without seeing her dad.

318
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,988
Ah.

319
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,224
The dirtbag.

320
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,127
Don't forget your sweater.

321
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,061
Meow.

322
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,398
Oh yeah, when I smell it it
makes me feel like

323
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm actually in Paris.

324
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,202
It's our most popular seller.

325
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,071
And then there's George.

326
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,474
AKA the Ladykiller.

327
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:59,947
Well, if only I had a special
lady friend to give it to I...

328
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,283
Hey, did you hear about
my latest bust?

329
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:04,484
No, sorry.

330
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,819
What, are you kidding?

331
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,187
Everyone's talking about it!

332
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,521
Oh yeah, the perp was 14
but he was big.

333
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,457
I mean, he had you know
man muscles.

334
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,027
Obviously he pumped iron,
of course so do I.

335
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,429
Anyway, something about his
behaviour didn't add up

336
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,499
he was lingering around the
fancy jean section too long

337
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,869
and between you and me he
didn't look like the kind of kid

338
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,370
who could afford them.

339
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,938
Is that profiling?

340
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,139
Well, maybe. Did it
work this time?

341
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,307
You bet your butt it did.

342
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,508
Well, the minute those
jeans went

343
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,776
into the knapsack it was on.

344
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,146
I mean, he tried to get away but
obviously I'm pretty agile so.

345
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,384
George, thanks for visiting
but I need to take my break.

346
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,318
Oh yeah.

347
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,386
Oh, sure of course hey man

348
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,921
you've been on your
feet all day.

349
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,856
I'll go prevent some crime.

350
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,858
Okay. Okay.

351
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,194
No rascal today, George?

352
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,129
Hey, Crystal.

353
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,565
How many times have I told you
it is an ARV

354
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,968
or for those people not
in the biz,

355
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,171
(Both): Asset Recovery Vehicle.

356
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,908
But don't you need it
to chase bad guys?

357
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,575
I'm leveling the playing field.

358
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,912
Let them think they have
a chance.

359
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,113
But we know they don't!

360
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,847
That's right.

361
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,621
* You want that money baby,

362
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,523
* that's right you know
who got it. *

363
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:20,493
* Got so much money baby,
can't even close my wallet. *

364
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,462
* Hanging on Sunset daily

365
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,965
* yeah I can take
you shopping... *

366
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,333
Hi!

367
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,367
I'm Crystal.

368
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,969
We have fifth period together?

369
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,038
So?

370
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,472
Well, I was thinking we
could maybe put together

371
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,974
like a study group or something.

372
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,242
It could be a lot of fun.

373
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,576
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

374
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,179
I'll definitely RSVP no to that.

375
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,281
Do we look like
a bunch of nerds?

376
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,415
What a dork.

377
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,185
As if we actually need
to get smarter.

378
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,653
Ah, the youth.

379
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,356
They'd better hope
to marry rich.

380
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,058
And then there's Zach and Donny,

381
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,993
the future of our great country.

382
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,127
Think she'll like it, Zach?

383
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,029
As if you value my opinion.

384
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,131
God help us all.

385
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,535
It's band issues.

386
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,305
It's nice, I just can't have
the fiancee of Dragon Tail's

387
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:09,076
lead singer wearing
something so...

388
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,143
Dainty?

389
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,244
Yeah, dainty.

390
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,412
Dainty!

391
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,017
Show me the biggest rock
you got.

392
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,253
We did just sign a major
recording contract.

393
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,554
* You know you want it!

394
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,190
* You know I got it!

395
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,092
* This ain't no -

396
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,127
Dude! We're in the middle
of a thing!

397
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,495
Oh, you don't like my singing?

398
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,596
Surprise, surprise.

399
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,730
Now is really not the time,
Zach.

400
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,432
I have just the thing.

401
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,367
And it's big.

402
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,108
It's 8,000.

403
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,276
That's it?

404
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,412
Well, we're not exactly
Tiffany's.

405
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,688
Dude, what is
with all the angst?

406
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:58,158
I wanted to be the one
pretending to get married.

407
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,526
But everything has
to be your way,

408
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,694
just like what songs we sing
in the garage.

409
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,331
Because I'm the frontman
with the golden voice.

410
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,666
* Yeah!

411
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,602
And you're the bass player
with the fat fingers.

412
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,271
I do not have fat fingers.

413
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,672
Anybody can do this.

414
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,706
Oh, that's me?

415
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,941
Oh, you're doing me right now?

416
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,111
Oh, yeah well no one shreds
killer base solos the way I do.

417
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,079
Pow!

418
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,180
* Boom, boom, boom, boom!

419
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,082
* Boom boom!

420
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,284
* Yeah!

421
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,155
* What!

422
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,423
Never mind.

423
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:31,591
Good luck trying to find someone

424
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,726
who can do that on our
upcoming tour.

425
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,694
Hello.

426
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,895
There's not going to be a tour.

427
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,464
We hit that jewelry store
we're looking at 50 G's tops.

428
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,099
You can't get a bus with that.

429
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,333
Well, how are we going to bring
our music

430
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:41,368
to our audiences?

431
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,636
Did you ever in your wildest
imagination think

432
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,506
that a dog would be worth
one million dollars?

433
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,443
Well, a Leonberger this rare
and with championship bloodlines

434
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:53,413
well that makes it truly
one of a kind.

435
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,317
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

436
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,156
Yeah, that's one trippy
looking dog.

437
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,257
Hey, want to see him run?

438
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,492
Oh, we'd love to see him run.

439
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,726
Come on.

440
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,796
There you go folks, this is
a million dollars running down

441
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,164
a hallway.

442
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:31,684
Meanwhile, Crystal found herself
wandering amid the shoppers,

443
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,787
past the kiosks, hoping to make
sense of what it is

444
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:38,791
to be a little girl who though
gentle and kind to all

445
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,328
is shunned by her peers.

446
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,164
I think somebody could use
a caramel machiatto

447
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,765
with extra whip.

448
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,305
[sighs]

449
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,175
Well, that sounded like
the weight of the world.

450
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,276
You're not Roger.

451
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,544
What gave it away?

452
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,783
I know, I'm just filling in for
him while he picks up his mom

453
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,318
from the airport.

454
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,554
The sleighs in the shop.

455
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,590
I usually work Westbrook
Mall but you know,

456
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,759
us Santa's try and help
each other out.

457
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:14,527
Well, it's nice to know that
you Santa's of the world

458
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,796
are still decent to your fellow
human beings.

459
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,798
Wow, that's depressing.

460
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,135
Where's your Christmas spirit?

461
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,337
Some people are mean
for no reason.

462
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:26,606
And they get a lump of coal
in their stocking.

463
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,142
Luckily, people like you get
special compensation

464
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,512
from people like me
this time of year.

465
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,781
Is that chocolate?

466
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:37,584
No, are you kidding me?

467
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,552
That's a magical Christmas coin.

468
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,822
I hand them out to people
who would otherwise

469
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,857
have a crappy Christmas.

470
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:50,630
I buy them online from
magicalchristmascoins.co.uk/canz.com

471
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,736
Because this is so much better
than a sweet computer.

472
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,704
Yes.

473
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:58,571
Or a bike?

474
00:18:58,605 --> 00:18:59,739
That is correct.

475
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,840
Or anything?

476
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,742
Duh. Infinitely better.

477
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,245
Look. Make a Christmas wish.

478
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,249
All you do is you make a wish
and you toss it into a fountain.

479
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,417
Any fountain will do.

480
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,619
You could use a toilet bowl
in a pinch.

481
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,521
Does that work?

482
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:15,655
Yeah, it's a wishing well.

483
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,725
Should work just fine.

484
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,793
Thanks but I don't really...

485
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,763
Believe in mall Santa Claus's?

486
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,632
That's not to say that I judge
you for wanting

487
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,634
to make a little extra money
over the holidays.

488
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,969
Look, you don't have
to believe in me

489
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,271
but what you do have to do is

490
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:33,406
put your wish out
into the universe.

491
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,775
You can't claim it
if you can't name it!

492
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,710
I got that from
the Easter Bunny.

493
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,679
Or is it Tooth Fairy?

494
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,548
Whatever, it was
at a convention.

495
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,984
Anyway, what do you say,
Crystal?

496
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,287
How did you know my name?

497
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,888
Lets just say your name's
on the list.

498
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,691
Did Jesse put you up to this?

499
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:55,862
Look, wish first then coin.

500
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,231
That's what it says in
the instruction booklet.

501
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,333
Oh, and if your wish rhymes

502
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,702
you get extra Christmas mojo.

503
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,970
That's really corny.

504
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,438
Corny's good.

505
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,440
Corny's my stock and trade.

506
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,442
I do corny very well.

507
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:13,346
Just give it a try.

508
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,847
You do realize this is just
a little girl

509
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,849
humouring an old man right?

510
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,720
That's awesome.

511
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,989
For my Christmas wish I wish...

512
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,592
I wish I'd meet a friend,

513
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:30,229
one who listens to me
and on whom I can depend.

514
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,302
Happy?

515
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,804
Santa dude?

516
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,711
I can see you right there.

517
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,045
No you can't.

518
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:46,946
Yes I can.

519
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,515
No, it's not me.

520
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:49,849
I'm magical.

521
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,551
Dumb.

522
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,987
Never works.

523
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,370
Customer! Customer!

524
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,971
Customer!

525
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,540
Bird for sale!

526
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:14,807
Customer!

527
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:19,579
Hey Grumpy.

528
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,514
Hey hey, I like those
boots girl.

529
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,916
Yeah, you looking good.

530
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,021
Oh, very funny Corben.

531
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,256
Oh, hey Crystal.

532
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,725
Yeah, he's here for the rest
of the week folks so come on by.

533
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,927
I've got a really big sale
on hamsters and snakes,

534
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,463
although not necessarily
together though

535
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,798
because that would be bad
for the hamster.

536
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,033
You wouldn't really eat me,
would you Carla?

537
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,335
But of course not.

538
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,736
I am a gopher snake.

539
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,638
You look nothing like a gopher.

540
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:46,906
Really?

541
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,742
Phew, that's good to know.

542
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:52,645
Alright. Thanks!

543
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,446
Customer!

544
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,447
Customer!

545
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,982
Over here!

546
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,417
Hey, Mr. Crabtree.

547
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,486
Hey Crystal, say hello
to Jo-Jo.

548
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,653
Hey boy.

549
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,888
He's beautiful, isn't he?

550
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,789
Beautiful?

551
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,124
On what planet, Planet Ugly?

552
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,693
Meow.

553
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,828
Yeah, he's also got a buyer
which means

554
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,831
Whiskers will be staying open
for a long time to come.

555
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,701
You know, if it wasn't for him
we would be out of business.

556
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,469
You're a superhero, Jo-Jo.

557
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,706
Yeah, he's the best thing to
happen to me in a long time.

558
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,674
I'm not going to lie to you,

559
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,476
it's been hard since
I lost my Shirley.

560
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,046
She was my rock, my world,
my everything.

561
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,919
Truth is I, uh, I've neglected
this place.

562
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,921
But it's only because
I've been in so much pain.

563
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,690
Ugh, I'm in so much pain
listening to your sob story

564
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,426
I wish you'd put me to sleep.

565
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,693
This is animal cruelty.

566
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,795
Do the humane thing,
give me the gas.

567
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,532
Who is saying that?

568
00:22:45,565 --> 00:22:46,799
Saying what?

569
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,536
I thought I heard somebody say
that they were in so much pain

570
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,903
from listening to your sob story

571
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:54,040
that they wanted
to be put to sleep.

572
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,942
Huh.

573
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,744
Well, forgive me for sharing.

574
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:58,678
No, I didn't mean!

575
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,912
I mean, I didn't say.

576
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:03,583
Excuse me, I need to go find
a suitable carrier for Jo-Jo.

577
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,552
Made of gold I presume?

578
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,719
Meow.

579
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,961
It's you!

580
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,028
Who, me?

581
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,163
Say that again.

582
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,499
Okay, I don't know what's
happening here

583
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,967
but I don't like it.

584
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,635
You are talking to me.

585
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:24,471
What are you, some kind
of blond witch?

586
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,872
You can't understand me!

587
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,106
I heard all of that.

588
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:27,840
No you didn't!

589
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:28,941
Yes, I did!

590
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:29,642
Well, stop it!

591
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:30,643
You stop it!

592
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:31,844
You stop it, witch!

593
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,113
Are you having a conversation
with the girl?

594
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,682
Tell her I'm available.

595
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,116
And apparently on sale.

596
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,553
Ooh, let her know I'll repeat
any stupid thing she wants.

597
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:41,654
My skin sheds!

598
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:42,655
Will you shut up!

599
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,890
You shut up!

600
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,662
It's cool.

601
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,197
I talk to the bird.

602
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,699
Hands in the air, sucker!

603
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,133
Hands in the air, sucker!

604
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,334
Yeah.

605
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:59,472
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to them.

606
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:03,543
Wait, you can talk
to the animals too?

607
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,944
Ugh, don't act high and mighty

608
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,647
just because you're at the top
of the food chain, honey.

609
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,715
But I can only hear you.

610
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,550
Well, that's a good thing,
trust me.

611
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,685
I'm the only one worth
listening to.

612
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,687
They're all very stupid
and annoying.

613
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,688
I'm not annoying.

614
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,790
I'm awesome, and full of energy!

615
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,492
I can play non-stop
for hours and hours

616
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,693
and hours and hours!

617
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,128
Oh God, calm down.

618
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,701
Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch the fur!

619
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,769
Meow.

620
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,137
Okay Grumpy Cat, why can
I suddenly understand you?

621
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,505
Um, why are you asking me?

622
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,042
You think I want people knowing
how I really feel about them?

623
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,745
Believe me, that's the last
thing I would wish for.

624
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:40,947
Wish.

625
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,282
I tossed a magic coin into a
wishing well and made a wish!

626
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,717
Okay, I'm embarrassed for you.

627
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:45,852
You are a loser.

628
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,620
But I wanted a person,
not a cat.

629
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:51,023
Hey, look at the freak
having a conversation

630
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,125
with the little kitty.

631
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,595
Having a nice chat
with your cat?

632
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:58,731
[laughing]

633
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,133
Oh, you rhymed chat with cat.

634
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,201
Very smart.

635
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,871
Except you're terrible
human beings.

636
00:25:04,904 --> 00:25:05,805
Meow.

637
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:10,610
I need to talk to Santa.

638
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:13,012
There's a line and no cutsies,
North Pole...

639
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,681
Policy...

640
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,782
A Porsche?

641
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,717
A real Porsche?

642
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,753
Roger?

643
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,555
What's up? I have customers.

644
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,190
Yeah, he's got customers.

645
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:29,662
And we're not going anywhere
until he hears our entire list.

646
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:33,933
(Santa): Us Santa's try and help
each other out.

647
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,568
But Roger, I thought you had
to pick up your mom

648
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,203
at the airport for the holidays?

649
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,238
Actually, I live with my mom.

650
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,239
So do we.

651
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,241
She's a really good cook.

652
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,243
You don't have to believe in
me but what you do have to do

653
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:48,114
is put your wish out
into the universe.

654
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:52,719
Roger, do you know the Santa
from the Westbrook Mall?

655
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,588
Westbrook closed awhile ago
for renovations.

656
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:56,856
Everyone knows that.

657
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,725
Are you dumb or something?

658
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,893
(Both): Haha! She's dumb!

659
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:05,164
I hate my life.

660
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:09,636
Crystal had been mesmerized
by a magic talking

661
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,971
distractingly beautiful cat,

662
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,908
whose telepathic communications
not only troubled her young mind

663
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:19,145
but also drew her like a moth
to a flame.

664
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:22,682
Back to the origins of this
great mystery.

665
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:25,051
Problem is she also promised
to go

666
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,286
to Jesse's stupid
Christmas party.

667
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,256
[applause]

668
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,125
Oooh... No!

669
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,027
Tabby, Handerpants!

670
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,896
You know you want them.

671
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,698
One of a kind!

672
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:40,867
No shower gel dispenser!

673
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,134
No!

674
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,335
No.

675
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:50,843
Oh, I'm going to have to go
with the fruitcake!

676
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:59,652
Nice get, but you completely
missed these.

677
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:04,423
My awesome set of seaworthy
salt and pepper shakers.

678
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,926
You dog, you were hiding those.

679
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,895
Hell no, Jesse.

680
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,096
Salt and pepper shakers.

681
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,130
What?

682
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,967
[laughter]

683
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,069
The price of greed, my friend.

684
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,105
Come to me, Crystal.

685
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,008
You are powerless to resist me.

686
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:23,409
Meow.

687
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,276
Your turn, Jesse.

688
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,945
I'm just going to take
that fruitcake.

689
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,213
Oh, you wouldn't!

690
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,047
I did.

691
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,416
All's fair, all's fair.

692
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,751
You don't even like fruitcake.

693
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:34,053
Nobody likes fruitcake,
just come on.

694
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:34,954
Let it go.

695
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,022
Fine.

696
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,256
Handerpants, please.

697
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:18,831
Why are the Cinnabon employees
always the last to leave?

698
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:19,932
Because they're up all night

699
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,034
making those delicious
sticky buns.

700
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,335
Oh.

701
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,045
They should really lock this.

702
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,247
Yeah, but then
we wouldn't be able to -

703
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,316
Stop.

704
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,051
Okay.

705
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,324
[whispers]
Grumpy!

706
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,028
Grumpy!

707
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:49,929
Meow!

708
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,232
Did I scare you?

709
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,500
What gave it away?

710
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,970
My scream of sheer terror
or the puddle of pee?

711
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,505
And lower your voice,

712
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,874
I don't want those other
freaks to wake up.

713
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:14,787
Don't even think about it.

714
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,288
Yeah, Paul Blart!

715
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,057
Oh! Oh!

716
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,026
Oh! No!

717
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:23,830
You're making a big mistake!

718
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,397
Where are the master keys?

719
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:26,866
I will never tell.

720
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:31,270
We can do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

721
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,504
Oh, hey lets do it the easy way.

722
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,140
They're right on the hook
over there.

723
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,008
Oh, is it these ones?

724
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:37,209
[muffled]

725
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:40,446
That sounds a lot like yes
so I'm going to go with that.

726
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,051
[laughter]

727
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,285
* You know you want it!

728
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,353
* You know I got it!

729
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,088
* This ain't no...

730
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,890
Haha, you were great man.

731
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,192
[muffled]
Hey! Hey!

732
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,393
What are you doing here anyway?

733
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,295
Trying to figure out what
the heck is going on with us.

734
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:58,530
What's going on is that
you're bothering me.

735
00:29:58,564 --> 00:29:59,531
I was sleeping.

736
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,067
How did you even get in?

737
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,502
Reveal yourself, witch!

738
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,570
You stole the key.

739
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,005
Borrowed!

740
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,506
Don't give me that look.

741
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,875
What look?

742
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:09,876
That look of judgement
you're giving me.

743
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,844
This is my look of
tacit approval.

744
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,112
Well, whatever.

745
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,381
We really need to figure
this talking thing out.

746
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:18,150
Okay, but it's worth pointing
out you really screwed up

747
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,518
your big wish.

748
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,889
Why wouldn't your first choice
be an unlimited supply of tuna?

749
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,390
[classical music]
***

750
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,592
Another, mademoiselle
Grumpy Cat?

751
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,930
Oui, oui, just keep them coming
until I pass out.

752
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,264
Because I don't like tuna?

753
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,000
Huh, your loss.

754
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:37,536
David Lee Roth, Gary Cherone
or Sammy Hagar?

755
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,106
Oh, it's not even an argument.

756
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,242
Sammy Hagar is clearly
Van Halen's best lead singer.

757
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,276
What?

758
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,045
Gary Cherone blows
that hack away.

759
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,280
Most people don't even know
who Gary Cherone is.

760
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:50,049
How dare you minimize
his contribution.

761
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:53,986
Oh, he was the lead singer
for one very forgettable album.

762
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,121
That's a weird cat.

763
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,155
You're weird.

764
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,056
Meow.

765
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,157
Huh, yeah.

766
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,926
Hey, there he is.

767
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:03,295
[snoring]

768
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:08,901
Wow, freaky looking
and a terrible guard dog.

769
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:11,470
Oh, time for a walk?

770
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,072
Whoa, this is awesome.

771
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,473
They're stealing the dog.

772
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,574
I love these dudes.

773
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,310
Okay, not only is Gary Cherone
the better vocalist

774
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,080
but I bet my favourite amp
he could totally beat Hagar

775
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,915
in a kung fu fight!

776
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,450
Oh, I'd take that bet.

777
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,684
Seriously?

778
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,653
Alright, all we've got to do
is get them in the same room.

779
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,260
We can't let them steal
Jo-Jo!

780
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,595
Just to play devils
advo-cat,

781
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,497
what if we let them
steal Jo-Jo?

782
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,269
It's dead!

783
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,503
I don't care about that.

784
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,408
They left their keys!

785
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:50,642
Okay, freeze.

786
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,979
At this point things could
have gone two ways.

787
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:55,347
The fast way which goes
like this.

788
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,617
I raced out of the pet store
with Crystal in tow

789
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,420
and knowing that precious
moments were ticking away

790
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:05,424
like a ticking time bomb I flew
like the desert wind

791
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,627
toward a building
that looked official.

792
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,697
Again with Crystal in tow,
where I alerted the authorities

793
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,500
to the crime in progress.

794
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,036
Within moments the culprits
were apprehended.

795
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:18,304
Ow, that really hurt!

796
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,339
You're welcome, police.

797
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,710
Okay, that's enough.

798
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:28,247
Me and my sidekick who
barely did anything

799
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,650
were hailed as heroes,
thank god for me.

800
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,520
But that would mean
a pretty short movie

801
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:38,324
and a lot less advertising
revenue so luckily,

802
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:42,061
and through no persuasion
on my part, it went like this.

803
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,262
They left their keys!

804
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,496
Put those back, they're going
to need them.

805
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,597
But if they steal Jo-Jo,

806
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,399
Whiskers will go out
of business.

807
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,567
And?

808
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,769
And this is the only place
where I don't have to worry

809
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,604
about being accepted.

810
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,440
Uh, so?

811
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,641
I can just be me.

812
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,643
I'm sure you can get the same
warm and fuzzies

813
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,045
at the library.

814
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,412
But if Mr. Crabtree has to close

815
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,414
do you have any idea what
that means for you?

816
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,683
I'm sure he'd take me in.

817
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,419
I'd make a fine house cat,
I know I would.

818
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,156
Yeah, because you've had
a lot of luck with that.

819
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,293
Please, Mr. Crabtree,
don't do it.

820
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,162
Don't do it Mr. Crabtree!

821
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,429
No!

822
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:20,732
You're a horrible man.

823
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:28,174
[sirens wailing]

824
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,341
(Cop): Freeze, kitty cat.

825
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,609
Hey man, I'm innocent!

826
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:33,779
It was the other cat,
the calico with the lisp!

827
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:45,557
What about that one, daddy?

828
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,159
She looks like the kind of cat -

829
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,560
Who would make
the best pet ever?

830
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,329
That would smother you
in your sleep.

831
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,198
Lets keep looking.

832
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,600
That's a pretty one.

833
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,736
Don't worry, it's not going
to hurt.

834
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,471
This is way too dark.

835
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:03,409
No!

836
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,410
Well?

837
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,278
Oh, I'm alive. Great.

838
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:07,846
Can I have some more time
to think about it?

839
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,814
No.

840
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:14,253
Alright, fine.

841
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,587
I'm back, what's happening?

842
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:16,988
I'll tell you what's happening,

843
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:19,425
I just rolled around in some
catnip and I'm ready to go.

844
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:20,759
Lets do this!

845
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,494
There they are, Donny and Zach.

846
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:23,762
They are psyched!

847
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,633
They just stole a million dollar
mutt from Mr. Crabtree's store.

848
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,768
Nice.

849
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,736
[laughter]

850
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,404
That was easier than getting
a record company

851
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,572
to listen to our demo.

852
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,242
Bro, we are going to get so
much bank for this pooch.

853
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:36,742
Yeah!

854
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,310
Woo!

855
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:39,611
That's why I'm the captain
of this ship

856
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,280
and you are the matey.

857
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,281
Are we pirates?

858
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,215
What?

859
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,283
Are you saying we're pirates?

860
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,284
No.

861
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,487
I'm the guy, and you're
the guy behind the guy.

862
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,189
Like if this was Nirvana I would
be Kurt Cobain

863
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,725
and you would be the bass player
with the really long name.

864
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,662
Can't it be more like
Cliff Burton,

865
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,430
James Hetfield kind of thing?

866
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,499
You know like, I'm one
and you're the other.

867
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,534
Where are my keys?

868
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:03,902
They're not here.

869
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,471
Oh, good job Kurt Cobain.

870
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:06,538
Nice looking out, Zach.

871
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,339
What?

872
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:08,474
How is this on me?

873
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:09,608
Because you're supposed to
be the lookout guy, right?

874
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,344
You're supposed to be
looking out for stuff like this.

875
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:13,712
I hate you, you know that?

876
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:14,680
I'm going to start my own band

877
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:17,283
and I'm going to call it
Tail of the Dragon.

878
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,185
You can't do that, my band
is Dragon Tail

879
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,153
there's going to be some serious
market confusion.

880
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,655
Oh, well I already
legal zoomed it, so.

881
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:27,626
Ouch!

882
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,297
Sweet Caroline, that was
my finger plucking hand.

883
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,665
What the heck are you doing?

884
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,867
I was going to hot wire
your car.

885
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,403
Hey, do you know how to do that?

886
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:38,704
Oh, no.

887
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:40,206
But it's easy, I saw it on TV.

888
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,908
You just take...

889
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,577
zzz, with the wires.

890
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:48,514
Don't ever touch my car again!

891
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,249
Okay.

892
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,319
I know where my keys are,
they're on top of the fish tank.

893
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,221
Why didn't you tell me
that before?

894
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,955
Come on, man!

895
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,390
My hand really hurts!

896
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:01,493
At that very moment Crystal
and I were wracking our brains

897
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:05,197
trying to formulate the perfect
plan for a daring rescue.

898
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,698
And then it came to me.

899
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:07,766
How about this plan,

900
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,902
we let them steal Jo-Jo
and then we nap.

901
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,471
No, you're coming with me.

902
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,539
Oh, great.

903
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,541
Who's doing the kidnapping
now, huh?

904
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,343
You're as bad as them!

905
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,211
Quick thought, you should
take Carla.

906
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:20,946
A snake is a lot scarier.

907
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,949
I'm not scary, I am fun
and I am charming

908
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,518
and I like long slithers
on the beach.

909
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,356
Lets go, we need
to find security.

Hey, that's weird.

913
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,738
I swear I put my keys
right here.

914
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:47,973
Why don't you ask that sad cat,

915
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,775
he was watching the whole time.

916
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,643
Yeah, that's really helpful
Zach.

917
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,346
Look at the fish following
my fingers.

918
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,649
I'm the fish whisperer!

00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,551

We're not the only ones here.

a deer later.

for me.

We know you have them
because you've been running

from us and that makes
us point the finger at you.

that through?

creative license

00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,225
with what actually
happened here.

Oh, real Grumpy.

Don't be absurd.

1009
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,867
They don't even make paintball
guns for cats.

1019
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,618
without any mess up
we can do anything

1020
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:11,389
and that includes
getting out of this.

1021
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,824

1034
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,876
Because it does.

Hey, you get back here.

1039
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:32,838
Which way did he go?

1040
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:33,905
Oh that looks bad.

Hi ho.

1070
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:05,396
You're that expensive dog.

1071
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,299
My reputation precedes me.

00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,968
What is this, a jailbreak boy?

1073
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,838
Uh huh, yeah.

Come on.

Gotcha!

1078
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,994
What is your problem?

1079
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:37,195
Our problem?

1080
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,064
How would you like it if we shot
you with a paintball gun?

1081
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,866
Mmh-mmh.

1082
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:41,399
I wouldn't.

1083
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:42,167
Of course not!

1084
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,069
Because it hurts!

1085
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:45,336
And it isn't nice.

1086
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,905
I'm glad we can agree on that.

1087
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:47,939
Can you let me up now?

1088
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,908
What did you do
with my car keys?

1089
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,576
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1090
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:53,578
Zach, punch him in the face.

1091
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:54,379
What?

1092
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:55,280
Mmm.

1093
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,481
What?

1094
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,849
My hand still hurts
from punching your car

1095
00:46:57,883 --> 00:46:59,217
and these are my money makers.

1096
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,052
We haven't made a dime
from our music yet.

1097
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:02,187
Well why don't you punch him,

1098
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,621
you don't even play
an instrument.

1099
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,892
My voice is an instrument,
you hit him.

1100
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:07,926
Hit him!

1101
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:08,493
Okay!

1102
00:47:08,526 --> 00:47:11,229
Ow! Ow!

1103
00:47:11,262 --> 00:47:13,498
Oh man, I think it's broken.

1104
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,366
I think it hurt me more than
it hurt you.

1105
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,602
No, I don't think that's true
at all.

1106
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,338
So, are you going to tell me
where my car keys are

1107
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:24,275
or are we going to have
to amp this up?

1108
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:28,346
I don't know anything
about your stupid keys!

1109
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,347
Wait!

1110
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,049
Honestly guys, I just came back
to get my laptop

1111
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,483
out of my office.

1112
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,552
It's not really an office,
it's more of a cubicle.

1113
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,553
Oh god!

1114
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:37,455
That is quite the drop.

1115
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,424
[whimpering]

1116
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:40,391
Jail break! Jail break!

1117
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:41,592
Jail break!

1118
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:51,602
George!

1119
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,939
[muffled talk]

1120
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:57,208
Well, somebody finally figured
out a way to shut him up.

1121
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:58,543
[muffled talk]

1122
00:47:58,576 --> 00:47:59,911
You're going to regret that.

1123
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:00,411
Ow!

1124
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:02,013
Oh, oh my god.

1125
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,114
There's scissors there.

1126
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:04,182
Are you okay?

1127
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,183
What happened?

1128
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,985
These two guys jumped me
while I was rewriting

1129
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:09,220
the policies and procedures
hand book.

1130
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,488
Here we go.

1131
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:13,224
I think they had ninja training
but I drop kicked the first one,

1132
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:15,626
and then I hit the second one
in the Adam's apple.

1133
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,128
Do you have a half hour,
Crystal?

1134
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:18,229
Because I don't.

1135
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,098
And that's when they pulled
their guns, big ones.

1136
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,166
And everybody knows
that I'm a tough guy

1137
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,501
and I'm ready to throw
down with the best of them

1138
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,670
but I am smart enough to know
that I am no match

1139
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:26,972
for a bullet.

1140
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,240
Well, they're trying
to steal Jo-Jo!

1141
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,308
What's a Jo-Jo?

1142
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:33,144
Super dog, super hound,
super model...

1143
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:33,711
Hi!

1144
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,246
That's Jo-Jo!

1145
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,714
Back so soon, gorgeous?

1146
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,585
Yeah well, those guys
were ignoring me.

1147
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:41,786
A dog?

1148
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:45,590
Why would they try to steal
a dog and not some diamonds

1149
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,492
or something from
the jewelry store?

1150
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,593
Mmm, that feels good.

1151
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,728
Well, he's worth a lot of money.

1152
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,529
How much money?

1153
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:52,630
A lot!

1154
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:53,764
Yeah, a lot.

1155
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:57,602
And now they're after me
because I stole their car keys!

1156
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:00,638
I'm what's stopping them
from getting away!

1157
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,974
12 year old girl thwarted
the robbery.

1158
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,542
Hey, she couldn't have done it
without me.

1159
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,145
George, we have
to call the police.

1160
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:10,248
We can't, they pulled out
the phone lines.

1161
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,316
But don't you have a cell phone?

1162
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,350
Well, they took it.

1163
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,152
Well, what are we going to do?

1164
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:15,453
Wait a minute,
how did you get here?

1165
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:16,521
My bike.

1166
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:17,622
Okay, here's what we're
going to do.

1167
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,624
We're going to get you back
to your transportation,

1168
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:20,691
then you go for help.

1169
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:24,229
Come on, and oh you've got
a little kitty there.

1170
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,296
Alright.

1171
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,098
And here, I'll take care of
the dog and the mall

1172
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,633
until the cops arrive.

1173
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,068
Is there a bathroom here?

1174
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:31,769
Are you sure you don't want
to come with me?

1175
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,706
Oh no, Crystal, I took an oath
to protect this place

1176
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:39,577
and that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

1177
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,578
Oh.

1178
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:43,248
[crying]

1179
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,782
Guys, I swear, I didn't have
anything to do

1180
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,351
with shooting you!

1181
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:49,254
And frankly, I want you
to steal that dog.

1182
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:50,655
No, seriously.

1183
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,323
My company wants to get rid
of that pet shop

1184
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:53,658
and put a Club Chicken in there.

1185
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:55,393
I love those sweet
chicky nuggets!

1186
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:56,194
See?

1187
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:57,195
So, it's a win win.

1188
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,264
I'll look the other way,
I never saw anything,

1189
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:02,033
you guys were never here.

1190
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:04,202
Donny, can I have a word?

1191
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,807
He sounds pretty convincing.

1192
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,542
I'm starting to think
maybe he's telling the truth.

1193
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:12,743
Because I am telling the truth.

1194
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:13,744
You, shut up.

1195
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:14,579
It's cool, I'm sorry.

1196
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,281
What did I just say?

1197
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,415
I think you might be right.

1198
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,417
Hell ya I'm right.

1199
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,685
Why do you think I'm right?

1200
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:23,421
I just realized if he was the
one shooting us with paintballs

1201
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,423
wouldn't he have paint residue
on his hands?

1202
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:28,293
No residue, I'm clean.

1203
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:31,796
You're like a one man CSI team.

1204
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:34,199
Okay, so here's the thing.

1205
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:35,266
Donny and I talked
and it looks like

1206
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,336
this whole thing has been a big
misunderstanding.

1207
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,804
Hey, no hard feelings.

1208
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:40,938
Are you sure?

1209
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,507
Because I did punch you in
the face and I threatened

1210
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,109
to throw you over the railing.

1211
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,643
That's already forgotten.

1212
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:46,544
Oh, I feel guilty.

1213
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,779
Don't. Honest mistake.

1214
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:49,780
Awesome.

1215
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:51,082
You are awesome.

1216
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,183
We should totally kick
it sometime,

1217
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,185
what are you into?
Oh, frisbee golf!

1218
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:55,786
Zach, do you want to wrap it up?

1219
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,289
If he's not the guy that means
there's another guy.

1220
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,294
Where's the dog?

1221
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:04,462
I thought you had him.

1222
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:05,630
Do I have to do everything?

1223
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:06,831
Oh, like lose the keys?

1224
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,133
Just go get the dog.

1225
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,335
What are we going to do
about him?

1226
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:15,173
As much as we'd like
to let you go,

1227
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,608
we can't.

1228
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:18,209
Oh.

1229
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:23,414
Shh.

1230
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:26,317
Some are born great,
others achieve greatness

1231
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:29,520
and some watch
Christmas movies starring cats.

1232
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,222
I think you know who you are.

1233
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:32,423
Meow.

1234
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:35,326
What were you doing in the
mall this time of night anyway?

1235
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,262
This is going to sound
really crazy.

1236
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,130
Try me.

1237
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:40,231
It's stupid.

1238
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:43,501
Come on, I'm a good listener.

1239
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:44,835
Well, I can't believe
I'm going to admit this

1240
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,705
but I came to talk to the cat.

1241
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:48,673
The cat?

1242
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:49,974
Yes, the cat.

1243
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,709
I thought you said you were
a good listener, George.

1244
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,878
We understand each other.

1245
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,846
With the way things have
been going in my life right now

1246
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,417
I can't say that about
too many people.

1247
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,586
My dad left my mom
for a barista,

1248
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,321
he barely calls anymore.

1249
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:04,722
Last time he did he said they
were talking about

1250
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:07,725
getting married and
starting their own family.

1251
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:08,926
Wow.

1252
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:13,198
Divorce can be tough,
especially on a kid.

1253
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:15,400
But a cat? Really?

1254
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:16,667
She wasn't my first choice.

1255
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,369
Um, I'm right here.

1256
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:19,904
But we have a connection.

1257
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:23,741
We can communicate
in our own way,

1258
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:24,742
and I know it's weird

1259
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,711
but there's something
kind of great about her.

1260
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,613
Oh, don't get sappy on me.

1261
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,882
Wait, I forgot, it's a Lifetime
movie, you can.

1262
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,918
I wish I had a friend.

1263
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:39,524
Law enforcement,
it's a lonely business.

1264
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:41,759
Occupational hazard I suppose.

1265
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,495
See, there's the schmaltz
I was looking for.

1266
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,764
You kind of feel
for the big guy, huh?

1267
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,366
I'm glad we had this talk,
George.

1268
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:49,567
Oh yeah, me too kiddo.

1269
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,604
You know, you just you've
got to hang in there that's all.

1270
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:54,372
Okay, look.

1271
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,707
Here is your stop,

1272
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:58,676
I can take it from here.

1273
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,611
Hey, don't forget your cat huh?

1274
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:01,279
Thanks.

1275
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:02,380
How about another walk?

1276
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:03,314
Or a chew toy.

1277
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:04,715
What, you're still here?

1278
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,551
I am so not going to miss you.

1279
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:09,554
Forget you, forgot you,
never thought about you.

1280
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:10,621
Be safe, George.

1281
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,823
I live for safety, Crystal.

1282
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,793
Oh hey, real quick,
when the cops come

1283
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:18,396
where should I tell them
you put those keys?

1284
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,865
[telephone ringing]

1285
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,601
Huh.

1286
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,636
I thought you said they took
your phone?

1287
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,639
Oh yeah, this is awkward.

1288
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:32,777
I thought they did too
but oh I'm so embarrassed,

1289
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:36,714
must be from the concussion from
when they hit me on the head.

1290
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:38,483
You never said they hit you.

1291
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:41,552
Oh, I left that out well you
know it all happened so quick.

1292
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,020
Well, this is great.

1293
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,222
We can call the police
now right?

1294
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:50,761
We're not calling
the police, Crystal.

1295
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,798
George, you devious scoundrel!

1296
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:57,034
You're the brains of this
operation, aren't you?

1297
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,437
Look, I've got to say I totally
saw that coming

1298
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,806
but you didn't huh?

1299
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,874
Where are the keys, Crystal?

1300
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,777
How could you do this, George?

1301
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,879
Well, that is a long,
complicated story

1302
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,782
which we can get
into another time.

1303
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:12,883
Ow! Ow!

1304
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,018
Oh!

1305
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:17,054
Ow, how did this escalate
so quickly?

1306
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,858
[telephone ringing]

1307
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:24,995
Mom? I can't talk right now,
I'm at work.

1308
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:28,032
Yes, yes, I need a ride home.

1309
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:29,099
I need a ride home every time,

1310
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,869
why must we have this
conversation every single,

1311
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,338
every single time.

1312
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,740
Here doggy doggy doggy!

1313
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,609
[cell buzzing]

1314
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:40,010
Oh, hey boss, what's up?

1315
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:42,847
Oh hi, I'm just checking to see
how everything's going.

1316
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,049
It's going great, we're
like a well oiled machine.

1317
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,451
This plans full proof.

1318
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:46,884
Nailed it.

1319
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:47,952
Really?

1320
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:49,153
Well, aren't you the least bit
curious

1321
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:51,689
as to how I can be talking to
you on the phone right now

1322
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,360
when I'm supposed to be
taped to a chair.

1323
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:56,894
Well, that's a very
good question.

1324
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:59,964
Well, see this nice little
12 year old girl untied me.

1325
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,566
Well, that was cool of her.

1326
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,901
The same girl who took
your keys.

1327
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,504
That's impossible, the guy
who stole our keys

1328
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:08,673
was probably an ex-Navy Seal
or something.

1329
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:09,907
He shot me in the butt.

1330
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,742
You should have seen the way
he handled the paintball gun.

1331
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:13,778
It was a child, you idiot!

1332
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,946
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

1333
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,418
UGH!!!!!

1334
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:27,658
[groans]

1335
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,627
You okay, George?

1336
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:32,930
Okay.

1337
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,966
I'm starting to think that based
on all the times

1338
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,869
that I busted you guys around
here for stupid stuff,

1339
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:43,608
combined with the debacle of
what happened tonight,

1340
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:48,713
I don't believe that you are
cut out for a life of crime.

1341
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:52,917
I think we're good at it.

1342
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,886
Whose idea was it
to steal the dog?

1343
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,054
George, it was a way
bigger score.

1344
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,023
I didn't need a bigger score,

1345
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,926
all I needed was enough money
for a downpayment on a house

1346
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,028
for when I retire next month.

1347
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,295
But now thanks to you two
numbskulls

1348
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:11,702
a 12 year old girl is leading
your bigger score out of here!

1349
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:13,037
So.

1350
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,040
We should probably...

1351
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,676
Prevent her from doing that.

1352
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,511
Now.

1353
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:21,979
Mmmhmm.

1354
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:25,950
Oh, now.

1355
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:31,088
I think he might be angry
with you.

1356
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:34,925
And the winner of worst
Christmas sweater goes to,

1357
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:36,827
master of the chicken
quesadilla,

1358
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:40,931
Taco Gigante's employee of
the month Alejandro Rodriguez!

1359
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:44,068
[applause]

1360
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,871
Congratulations, I knew
you had it in you.

1361
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,005
Speech!

1362
00:56:48,038 --> 00:56:52,743
Thank you JC, thank you Academy
and thank you family.

1363
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:54,011
Aww!

1364
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:58,483
You know, life is like
a soft taco.

1365
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,518
If you dig inside the meat --

1366
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:03,621
the protein of your choice

1367
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:05,890
and the salsa added
to your specification

1368
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:12,229
of mild, medium or caliente you
find the strength to stand tall

1369
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,200
and triumph in the face
of adversity.

1370
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:21,972
Meow!

1371
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,508
[speaking in Spanish]

1372
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,576
Back off familia, he's mine.

1373
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,481
Sorry you didn't win
worst sweater.

1374
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:31,482
I was robbed!

1375
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:33,951
Here's the truth, I was going
to choose you

1376
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:37,021
but I didn't want everyone to
think that the only reason I did

1377
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,524
was because I like you.

1378
00:57:39,557 --> 00:57:41,526
Even if that's just
some line you're using

1379
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,929
to lower my defenses,
totally worked.

1380
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,598
Yeah.

1381
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:52,637
My backup plan was to impress
you with my electric log.

1382
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,239
You do have one nice log.

1383
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:58,042
[laughs]

1384
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:01,111
But seriously, it's actually
a nostalgia machine.

1385
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,548
Yeah, it invokes a bygone era.

1386
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:08,553
A simpler time of pure ideals,
asbestos,

1387
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:09,253
leaded paint.

1388
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:09,920
Cheez Whiz.

1389
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:10,955
Cheez Whiz.

1390
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,790
[laughter]

1391
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,124
Thank you for inviting us.

1392
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,660
Of course.

1393
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:18,062
I'm glad Crystal's here.

1394
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:18,929
You know, the divorce

1395
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,798
has definitely made her
more introverted

1396
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:24,134
and she needs to go out
and do things.

1397
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,503
Take some risks.

1398
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:36,280
Uh oh!

1399
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:37,815
Give it up, kid!

1400
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:45,189
Is this the end of the line
for Grumpy and Crystal?

1401
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:49,193
Will our heroes finally succumb
to a villain so evil

1402
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:52,663
even evil isn't evil enough
to describe him?

1403
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:55,199
Am I going to keep
asking questions?

1404
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,201
I will if it annoys you.

1405
00:58:57,234 --> 00:59:02,740
Come back and find out.

1406
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,709
Are you still on the edge
of your seat?

1407
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,077
Is the dramatic tension
too thick?

1408
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:08,913
Are you still here?

1409
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:10,748
You are? Why?

1410
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,717
Whatever, back to the story.

1411
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,785
Bum bum bum bum.

1412
00:59:14,819 --> 00:59:21,859
Boom boom boom boom bwaaa,
dun nun nun nun nun!

1413
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,329
Lets check in to see if I'm down
to eight lives yet.

1414
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:28,065
Oh wow, shocker,
I'm still alive.

1415
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,868
Grumpy Cat didn't die
in her own movie.

1416
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:31,936
What?

1417
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:35,372
Yes, I know, it's not
just about me.

1418
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,743
Stop it, ow that hurts!

1419
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:40,310
George, this isn't right!

1420
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,112
What's Mr. Crabtree
going to do?

1421
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,749
Oh gosh, Mr. Crabtree.

1422
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:48,886
I totally forgot,
what is he going to do?

1423
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,154
Wait, I remember.

1424
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:51,321
He's going to pay me
a lot of money

1425
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:53,290
to get that stupid dog back.

1426
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,892
Ha, high five George!

1427
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:55,626
No!

1428
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,360
You're a jerk!

1429
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,128
Yeah, who leaves
someone hanging?

1430
00:59:58,162 --> 00:59:58,996
Come on.

1431
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,731
I'm the jerk.

1432
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,633
I'm the jerk.

1433
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:04,134
Me, the guy who fooled everybody

1434
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:06,771
by pretending to be a big
blowhard

1435
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,906
when in fact he was just
lulling them all

1436
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:12,276
into a false sense of
complacency and trust.

1437
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:13,277
That's right.

1438
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,344
Me, the jerk?

1439
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:16,814
Who rode around this mall
in that stupid scooter

1440
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:20,217
enforcing the law but the whole
time all I was thinking about

1441
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,853
was breaking it.

1442
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:24,288
That jerk?

1443
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,658
So, are you still pretending
to be a big blowhard or what?

1444
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:28,759
Jerk.

1445
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,828
I don't think so.

1446
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,730
Pffft!!!

1447
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:34,899
Mastermind.

1448
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:36,734
Oh yes.

1449
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:40,671
Oh no, yeah, you're a limp
short of being Keyser Soze.

1450
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:44,341
Now, about those keys.

1451
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,743
Yeah, those keys.

1452
01:00:45,776 --> 01:00:48,078
About them.

1453
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:49,880
I forgot where I put them.

1454
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:52,416
Oh man, what are we going to do?

1455
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:53,884
We're screwed!

1456
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:57,121
She's lying, right?

1457
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,689
Obviously.

1458
01:00:58,723 --> 01:00:59,389
Oh.

1459
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,391
That's very convincing.

1460
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:04,762
Okay, you and you go find
a nice piranha

1461
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:06,731
or scorpion to play with.

1462
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:08,332
Is he serious?

1463
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,105
Alright, now listen to me.

1464
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:16,907
I'm not fooling around anymore,
Crystal,

1465
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:19,877
I mean I'm out of patience.

1466
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,813
Now, you tell me
where those keys are

1467
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,382
or somebody is going
to get hurt.

1468
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:29,887
You wouldn't really hurt
a little girl, would you?

1469
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,788
What do I look like?

1470
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:32,089
A nut job?

1471
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,858
I'm greedy, I'm not evil,

1472
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:35,259
which I think is important
to point out

1473
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,194
are two completely
different things.

1474
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:41,732
One is the foundation
of our economic system

1475
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:45,369
and the other,
you know just bad.

1476
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:50,307
Okay, I'm not really following
you but.

1477
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:54,244
I'm not going to hurt you,
Crystal.

1478
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:58,215
I will however hurt the cat.

1479
01:01:58,248 --> 01:01:59,817
Whoa, what? Me cat?

1480
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,085
Don't!

1481
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:05,389
Now, what was it you said about
the cat being your best friend?

1482
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:09,760
So sweet, it really tugged
at my heartstrings.

1483
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:11,962
Which would make it
all the worse

1484
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:15,232
if something bad were to happen
to the little guy.

1485
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:15,900
Grumpy.

1486
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,234
First of all, I'm a she.

1487
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,903
Why is that so hard to grasp?

1488
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:21,471
And second of all,
pfft he's bluffing.

1489
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:22,539
I'm not scared.

1490
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,242
Now, I'm going to give you
three seconds to tell me

1491
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:28,779
where those keys are or I'm
going to put the kitty cat

1492
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,215
in the trash compactor.

1493
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:31,882
No!

1494
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:32,917
Whoa, he's not bluffing!

1495
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,018
He's not bluffing!

1496
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:35,786
He's petting me way
too diabolically.

1497
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,321
Tell him Crystal,
you've got to tell him!

1498
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:38,355
One!

1499
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,824
I threw them in
the wishing well!

1500
01:02:39,857 --> 01:02:41,025
Oh god, thank you.

1501
01:02:41,058 --> 01:02:42,226
Haha.

1502
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,363
Look at this huge frog.

1503
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,300
We're on it.

1504
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,002
Lets go, Patrick.

1505
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:59,009
See? That wasn't so hard,
was it?

1506
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:01,445
Look, I never thought
I was in danger okay?

1507
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,480
It's my movie after all
and I'm sure

1508
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,583
the Lifetime executives are
already thinking sequel!

1509
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:11,889
Like Grumpy's Worst Vacation
Ever, Meowii Style.

1510
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:14,358
Anyway, since you're still
watching this for some reason

1511
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,160
I thought now
would be a perfect time

1512
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:19,563
to see if you're interested
in my new product line!

1513
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:23,300
Like Grumpy Cat golf balls,
or the Grumpy Cat dartboard.

1514
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:27,037
And for the ladies a sure
fire hit, Grumpy underwear.

1515
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:28,572
To see what else is new this
season please visit

1516
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,440
www.GrumpyCats.com.

1517
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,575
Please be grumpy when you do it.

1518
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:33,610
Grumpy people only.

1519
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,345
Nice kitty.

1520
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:37,181
Kind of odd looking, though.

1521
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,950
I don't see your face
on any holiday cards.

1522
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:43,487
Come on, lets get you something
to eat.

1523
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,189
Stay!

1524
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,928
So, anyway that's how
the story ended.

1525
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:53,898
The bad guys made off with
the overpriced freak dog

1526
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,467
and evil triumphed over good.

1527
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,236
So sad.

1528
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:57,027
I'm not going to sugarcoat
it people,

1529
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:01,565
this happy, sappy Christmas
story had taken an ugly turn.

1530
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:05,369
Things were looking grim
and poor Crystal,

1531
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:09,940
she was looking lower than
a cat caught in a rain storm.

1532
01:05:09,974 --> 01:05:11,976
Can you blame her?

1533
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:15,045
Once again she'd been let down
by someone,

1534
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,447
her faith in people was shaken.

1535
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:19,716
Wasn't there anyone
to step forward

1536
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:23,053
in this desperate moment
to boost her spirit,

1537
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:24,989
to make her feel
like not all humanity

1538
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:28,292
was rotten to the core?

1539
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:31,395
Don't look at me, I don't
do motivational, sorry.

1540
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,530
That's Happy Cat.

1541
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,565
I'm Grumpy Cat.

1542
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:41,371
But truth is I dug down deep
and consulted my inner grump

1543
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:44,741
and realized that it was time
to help a kid

1544
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:48,278
I was actually starting
to care about.

1545
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:50,347
Are you crying, Crystal?

1546
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,083
No, I'm allergic to cats,
what do you think?

1547
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:55,385
Okay, I'm going to let
that one go.

1548
01:05:55,419 --> 01:05:57,687
Come on Crystal,
just talk to me.

1549
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:02,159
Why? What's talk going to do?

1550
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:06,630
I can't change anything,
especially people.

1551
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,765
I try to make friends, Grumpy.

1552
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,501
I try to see the good
in everyone,

1553
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:14,438
I stupidly even thought
that George was my friend.

1554
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,106
Nope! Never was!

1555
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,741
See?

1556
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:20,744
I just feel like my life
will always be a disappointment.

1557
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:22,746
I know what that's like, okay.

1558
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,980
Trust me.

1559
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:27,717
Having been bought and returned
a couple times I get it.

1560
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:30,420
Can I trade her for a fish?

1561
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:33,457
It makes you feel like there's
no love in the world.

1562
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:38,462
It makes you feel, well, grumpy.

1563
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:44,134
But you're different, Crystal,
you're full of love.

1564
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:47,437
What good is love if nobody
gives it back?

1565
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:51,075
That's how we feel too,
every day people walk in here

1566
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,810
to coo over the puppies
and the rabbits

1567
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,814
and the Jo-Jo's
and ignore us.

1568
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,348
True dat!

1569
01:06:58,382 --> 01:06:59,516
Spot on, Grumpy!

1570
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:00,517
Preach it, sister!

1571
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,785
Freedom!

1572
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:02,986
So, you know what?

1573
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:07,157
Contrary to the sign on
the door we're not pets,

1574
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:09,759
I mean until somebody takes us
home and cares for us

1575
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:13,130
and loves us we're just animals.

1576
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:13,697
Yup.

1577
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:14,498
Well said.

1578
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:15,565
Just animals.

1579
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:16,733
And reptiles.

1580
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,569
And as far as I can tell humans
are no different.

1581
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:21,338
You're actually making
me sadder.

1582
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:24,408
Okay, well it's your low point,
deal with it.

1583
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:28,145
But what I'm trying to say
is you are loved.

1584
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:31,648
Your mom loves you, look at her,
she loves you.

1585
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,217
Taco guy loves you.

1586
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,218
That guy loves you.

1587
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,152
Who is that guy?

1588
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:37,121
Even your dad loves you.

1589
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:41,191
Why? Because you're
the amazing you.

1590
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:45,162
And that is why I've decided
to adopt you.

1591
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,530
That's right.

1592
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,766
You're now on Team Grumpy
whether you like it or not.

1593
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,337
In fact, from this moment
on you're all on Team Grumpy!

1594
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,105
[cheers]

1595
01:07:55,139 --> 01:07:56,106
Team Grumpy!

1596
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,741
Uh, can we call it
something else?

1597
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:00,410
And this team is going to win.

1598
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:03,347
Wearing Grumpy t-shirts and
Grumpy baseball caps

1599
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,350
and Grumpy glow in the dark
buttons, am I right?

1600
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,752
Boo, Team Grumpy sucks!!!

1601
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:09,719
I don't want your swag.

1602
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:10,854
Shame on you, Grumpy.

1603
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:11,888
Shut up!

1604
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,857
Every team needs a sponsor,
come on.

1605
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,693
Do you really think we can still
do something to save the store?

1606
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:17,994
Do I?

1607
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,664
There must be a million ways
to stop these idiots.

1608
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:22,332
I just haven't thought of
one yet.

1609
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:23,167
Oh man.

1610
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,834
No shocker there.

1611
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:26,270
Cats blow!

1612
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:27,604
Okay, wait for it, people.

1613
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,005
I'm building here.

1614
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,742
We implore the fates to smile
upon this ragtag assembly

1615
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,910
of freedom fighters.

1616
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:38,348
We few, we happy few,
we band of brothers.

1617
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:39,583
Come on fates.

1618
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,551
Oh, it's open.

1619
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:43,387
Well, look at that.

1620
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,821
Let me at em!

1621
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,391
It's clobbering time.

1622
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:49,726
Good show, now you're talking
G Cat.

1623
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:50,594
Meow.

1624
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:51,861
Thank you, Grumpy.

1625
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:54,431
Time to get scary.

1626
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,332
Oh, not me.

1627
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:56,366
No.

1628
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,402
I'll undo the young
ladies binds.

1629
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:02,439
Piece of cake, really.

1630
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:09,546
Hey mom, yeah, a friend is going
to give me a ride.

1631
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:10,780
No.

1632
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:14,584
No, you don't know him.

1633
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:15,885
Yeah, I met him at the mall.

1634
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:18,822
Shh, I'm going to enjoy this.

1635
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:19,956
He might like pot roast.

1636
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,725
I like pot roast.

1637
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,960
Alright, I'll ask him
if he likes pot roast.

1638
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:24,828
Pot roast?

1639
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:25,629
Oh, count me in.

1640
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:26,930
He's got to drive
the speed limit.

1641
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:29,333
I'm, you know, wearing
my badge right?

1642
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,434
What else am I going to do?

1643
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:31,268
Surprise!

1644
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,303
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1645
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:34,704
Wee!

1646
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:35,705
Slimy, slithering...

1647
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:37,874
[Barking]

1648
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,309
Oh hello, aren't you cute.

1649
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:40,477
I smell crotch.

1650
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:41,645
Yeah!

1651
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,713
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1652
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:44,881
Let go! Let go!

1653
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:45,749
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1654
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:46,783
Let go!

1655
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:52,722
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1656
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:54,858
Well, I hope he didn't
want children.

1657
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:56,993
Holy crap, they're possessed.

1658
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,229
Get back, get back all of you!

1659
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:02,399
Ow! Ow!

1660
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:03,367
Give me that!

1661
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,402
How'd you get free?

1662
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:08,272
With a little help
from my friends.

1663
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:10,440
Ho-Yaaah!!!!!

1664
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:12,876
Hands in the air, sucker!

1665
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:13,843
Bawk!

1666
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:15,879
Oh, give me that.

1667
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,013
You're 12 years old.

1668
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,715
This isn't your day, Crystal,

1669
01:10:18,748 --> 01:10:20,817
and it isn't your day either
you dumb animals!

1670
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,419
This is George's day!

1671
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:23,620
Come on!

1672
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:24,688
What about the snacks?

1673
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,489
We did it!

1674
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:27,724
Yay!

1675
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:28,925
Victory!

1676
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,362
Um, did anyone notice
he still has the dog?

1677
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,430
Blast, you're right.

1678
01:10:33,463 --> 01:10:34,864
Take back the yay.

1679
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:39,803
Oh, how fortunate.

1680
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:55,585
[Christmas tune being played
out of tune]

1681
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:56,853
That was truly awful.

1682
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:59,623
[applause]

1683
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,731
We should take kazoo caroling
door to door, no?

1684
01:11:07,764 --> 01:11:08,665
I wouldn't.

1685
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,900
Neighbours called,
they think you're Satan.

1686
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:13,002
Satan. Santa.

1687
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,472
Same letters switched around.

1688
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:16,640
Interesting.

1689
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:18,742
And which one are you again?

1690
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,009
There's only one way
to find out.

1691
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:23,313
La, la, la, la, la, get a room.

1692
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:24,581
[telephone ringing]

1693
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,349
Meow.

1694
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:25,982
Sorry.

1695
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,317
It's okay.

1696
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:29,553
[telephone ringing]

1697
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:30,920
If you're selling
I'm not buying.

1698
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,055
Mom, it's Crystal!

1699
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,056
Whose phone is this?

1700
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,491
George and those
two other morons

1701
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:35,792
are trying to steal Jo-Jo!

1702
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,361
Slow down, who's Jo-Jo?

1703
01:11:37,394 --> 01:11:39,463
He's a really expensive dog!

1704
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:40,730
Wait, wait, where are you?

1705
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:42,499
At the mall!

1706
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:43,500
What are you doing at the mall?

1707
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,735
And what are you doing not
in the other room?

1708
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:47,337
I came back to see Grumpy.

1709
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:48,505
Hey mom.

1710
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:50,640
Because she can talk to me.

1711
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:51,975
I am so confused right now.

1712
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,810
Mom, just get here quick.

1713
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,879
Call the police
and Mr. Crabtree.

1714
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,614
I can hold them off
until you get here.

1715
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,783
Wait, Crystal, no you have
to leave there right now!

1716
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:00,984
Gotta go!

1717
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:03,653
Hello?

1718
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:06,656
Excellent, the plot is
finally coming together.

1719
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:11,628
That moment of literary alchemy
when smoke turns to fire!

1720
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:15,365
Now, if only I could remember
where I put my mousey toy.

1721
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:22,606
of the Serengeti. to Catvent

1722
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:25,542
Shh, we're on safari!

1723
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:28,578
Watch the female hippo
follow the male hippo

1724
01:12:28,612 --> 01:12:30,714
into the watering hole.

1725
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:33,883
Soon, the two will batter
each other with their snouts

1726
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:38,087
in a splashtastic mating frenzy.

1727
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:42,459
Oops, sorry that's my other
show, um,

1728
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:45,662
also on this network
and available on demand.

1729
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,130
Anyway, Crystal.

1730
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,532
Hiyeah!

1731
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:49,132
Bad guy.

1732
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:50,634
This is George's day!

1733
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:51,501
Some dog.

1734
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:52,569
I like pot roast.

1735
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:53,737
And me.

1736
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,873
Um, did anyone notice he still
has the dog?

1737
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,508
And now back to our show.

1738
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,410
We can't let them get away
with Jo-Jo.

1739
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:11,755
Dude, I have like $8
here already.

1740
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:14,424
What's with all the pennies man,
people are so cheap.

1741
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,391
Hey!

1742
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:17,961
Oh hey, George, we were
just coming for you.

1743
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:18,962
What the hell are you doing?

1744
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,097
Be awhile until I get another
parking ticket.

1745
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,500
Look at all this coin, man.

1746
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:24,434
Ow.

1747
01:13:24,468 --> 01:13:26,069
Will you two knuckleheads
freaking focus,

1748
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:26,970
where are the keys?

1749
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:29,773
Right here, man.

1750
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:30,940
Ow.

1751
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:33,977
Good thing you didn't go
commando, right?

1752
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,579
Yeah, because somebody
did a crappy job

1753
01:13:35,612 --> 01:13:37,080
tying up the little girl.

1754
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,548
Should I name names?

1755
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:40,650
Does it start with a Z?

1756
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:42,185
Or a D?

1757
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:44,888
Can we just get out of here?

1758
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:45,822
Now!

1759
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,691
Yay, we're going to save
the day.

1760
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:55,965
I'm going to call
Crabtree tomorrow

1761
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,701
and I'm going to state
our terms.

1762
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,569
State our terms!

1763
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:00,704
Alright, when we get the buyer
to pay up

1764
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:04,240
do you two idiots think that you
can handle the exchange?

1765
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,509
Hell yeah.

1766
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:07,143
Where are you going to be?

1767
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:08,712
Well, my timeline has changed.

1768
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:09,979
I'm leaving tonight.

1769
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:13,517
And by the way, guess who gets
to drop me off at the airport?

1770
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,151
As long as you chip in for gas.

1771
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,923
You could pay us back, bro.
It's no biggie.

1772
01:14:30,934 --> 01:14:32,536
Oh no, we're too late!

1773
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,541
[car starting]

1774
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:38,675
Grumpy?

1775
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:41,545
Don't question this,
just hop in sister!

1776
01:14:41,578 --> 01:14:43,112
Grumpy, are you serious?

1777
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:45,715
Of course I'm serious,
look at my face!

1778
01:14:45,749 --> 01:14:46,650
Buckle up.

1779
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:49,586
But you're a cat,
how are you going to...

1780
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:52,689
How is this even possible?

1781
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:54,123
You can't even reach the pedals!

1782
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:57,594
Thanks, you had to say that.

1783
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:58,995
Is this not my movie?

1784
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,731
Why couldn't you just
go with it?

1785
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,900
Okay, that never happened.

1786
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,001
This did.

1787
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:06,235
Oh no, we're too late!

1788
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:07,937
We'll never catch them on this!

1789
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,773
Lets take the Camaro!

1790
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:11,240
I don't know how to drive!

1791
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,609
Don't worry, it's like riding
a bike

1792
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:14,578
but everything is different
so you have to be careful

1793
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:16,680
or you could die.

1794
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:17,881
Why not.

1795
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:23,553
Try the visor.

1796
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,654
Aha!

1797
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:25,254
How did you?

1798
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:26,890
We are in a movie!

1799
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:30,994
Punch it.

1800
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,196
Come on, come on,
they're getting away.

Did we die?

Am I in heaven?

1805
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:49,846
Is my brother Arturo here?

1806
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:50,747
Arturo?

1807
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,348
Oh my god, what did I do?

1808
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:56,085
Ha, something I've been wanting
to do since Thanksgiving.

1809
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:00,289
But maybe we should try going
forward this time.

[tires screeching]

1811
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,797
Could you have parked
any further away?

1812
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:11,034
We scored the shade tree,
we never get this spot.

1813
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,168
It's night!

1814
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:13,236
And what's with the clown car,

1815
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:14,771
could it be any smaller?

1816
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:16,706
Hey, I'm reducing
my carbon footprint.

1817
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,808
Hey, I'm going to put a
footprint right up your -

Meow!

1819
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:24,380
I promise you a car chase
and I'm delivering a car chase.

1820
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,982
Yeah!

1821
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:26,883
I'm driving!

1822
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:27,784
I'm driving!

1823
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,052
I can't believe I'm driving!

1824
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:35,124
Those are doors!

1825
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:36,192
I know that!

1826
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:39,896
This is the moment where
we're going to blast

1827
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,297
through this wall of glass

1828
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,868
as a hail of crystal shards
rain down on our triumphant,

heroic figures.

1830
01:16:58,715 --> 01:16:59,883
Okay, so here's the deal.

1831
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,117
We had every intention
of shattering that thing

1832
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,954
but unfortunately we didn't have
the budget for it, okay?

1833
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:06,856
Not my problem.

1834
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,100
This is great.

1835
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,001
Is everybody comfortable?

1836
01:17:18,034 --> 01:17:19,736
I'm actually a little cold.

1837
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:20,937
Turn the heat up, my man.

1838
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,806
Don't mind if I do, old chap.

1839
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:24,808
It kind of smells in here.

1840
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:26,209
How'd you morons fit all
your band equipment

1841
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:27,811
in this puke bucket anyway?

Oh, have you ever played Tetris?

1843
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:30,413
It's kind of like that.

1844
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:32,849
But not anymore because
we're getting a tour bus!

1845

Tour bus!

It's Crystal!

Aw, why didn't we take
the Camaro?

Lets dance, clown car!

1850
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:50,433
That's it, Crystal.

1851
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:52,668
Surround them in
a circle of death.

Oh god, I think
I'm getting sick.

We've got to stop them.

1858
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:23,967
Pass them on the left.

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

What do I do, Grumpy?

nerves of steel.

Hey, where's the concern for me?

1924
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,507
You had me worried.

1925
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,243
I'm fine.

1926
01:21:20,276 --> 01:21:22,578
Those guys didn't do anything
to you, did they?

That's a different kind
of Lifetime movie,

01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,682
if you know what I mean.

1929
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,417
No, mom.

1930
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:31,520
Did I see you driving a Camaro?

1931
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,557
Yeah, but for the record
it was her idea.

1932
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:38,127
Is this the cat you said talks?

1933
01:21:38,161 --> 01:21:39,428
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

1934
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:41,097
It's okay, the good news is

1935
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,266
there are people
who can help you.

We will get you the treatment
that you need.

Mom, just forget I said
anything okay?

1938
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,673
I thought you wanted me
to make friends,

1939
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:52,341
you just never told me with who.

1941
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:55,511
Alright.

1942
01:21:55,544 --> 01:21:59,015
I don't care.

1943
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:02,952
You are a good kid
and I love you.

1944
01:22:02,986 --> 01:22:03,686
I love you too.

1945
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:04,988
I love you, meow.

1946
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:06,022
And I'm going to tell
you something

1947
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:08,657
you probably didn't know.

1948
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:10,526
When I was your age

1949
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,262
I had an invisible friend,

1950
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:16,332
so at least yours is real.

1951
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:18,501
I knew it, Crystal's mom's
a loser.

1952
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:19,468
Thanks, mom.

1953
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,170
She deserves an elf.

1954
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,741
Hey there, little lady.

1955
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,742
Hey, Mr. Crabtree.

1956
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:30,413
Crystal, you saved Jo-Jo
and you saved my store.

1957
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,048
Yup, she sure did.

1958
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:34,383
You're like a hero.

1959
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:38,021
But you also stole my key
and broke into the store.

1960
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:39,422
Yeah, about that.

1961
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:40,523
So, to pay for the damage

1962
01:22:40,556 --> 01:22:43,059
I'm going to have
to dock your pay.

1963
01:22:43,092 --> 01:22:45,328
But you don't pay me.

1964
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:51,200
Right, well then I could make
you employee of the month.

1965
01:22:51,234 --> 01:22:52,301
Really?

1966
01:22:52,335 --> 01:22:53,236
Well, there's only the two
of you

1967
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:57,406
and to be honest Corben's
kind of useless.

1968
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,507
Wish I was kidding.

1969
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,143
What?

1970
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:01,210
Thank you so much.

1971
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:04,280
Ugh, all this sweetness
is killing me.

1972
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:05,581
Literally.

1973
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:07,383
Or is it figuratively.

1974
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,085
Either way I don't like it.

1975
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:12,521
Hello?

1976
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:18,427
Hello?

1977
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:20,496
I could use a little help here.

1978
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:24,767
Hello?

1979
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:29,472
Come on!

1980
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,239
Alright.

1981
01:23:30,273 --> 01:23:31,274
Come on, slowpoke.

1982
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:32,308
I'm coming!

1983
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:50,159
What's wrong?

1984
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:52,128
Nothing.

1985
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:55,231
I guess Santa didn't come
this year.

1986
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,799
Why do you say that?

1987
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:58,734
Because I didn't get
what I wished for.

1988
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:00,703
Which was?

1989
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:04,207
I was hoping I would get
to adopt Grumpy.

1990
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:07,610
Alright, surprise, it's me!

1991
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:08,844
Merry Christmas.

1992
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:09,745
Grumpy!

1993
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,214
Yeah, yeah, surprise.

1994
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:11,814
Hey!

1995
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:13,416
Oh god.

1996
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,317
Hey girl.

1997
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:15,618
Merry Christmas!

1998
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,620
All right, lets take it slow
okay?

1999
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,422
This is the best Christmas ever.

2000
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:21,857
Sure, go ahead, ignore
the title of my movie.

2001
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,692
[knocks]

2002
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,661
Merry Christmas!

2003
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:27,796
Hey!

2004
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:30,499
Looks like Santa brought me
a present too.

2005
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:32,468
Does she mean the coffee
or the elf?

2006
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:34,770
Hahaha, good one Grumpy.

2007
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:41,544
This is going to take
some getting used to.

2008
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:46,415
Meow.

2009
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,288
Ho, ho, ho.

2010
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:54,623
So, remember, make
your Christmas wish

2011
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,392
and old Saint Nick will

2012
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,726
Beat it, tubs.

2013
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,330
Alright everyone, put your
Grumpy faces on and sing.

2014
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:03,299
* Jingle bells,
Christmas smells, *

2015
01:25:03,332 --> 01:25:05,801
* and it's really dumb. *

2016
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,570
* Worse are movies
about Christmas *

2017
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,638
* so I hope you
all are glum. *

2018
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:19,848
[screams]
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

2019
01:25:19,882 --> 01:25:22,451
Ha ha!

2020
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:24,553
"Have a very Grumpy Christmas.

2021
01:25:24,587 --> 01:25:27,223
It's the most terrible time
of the year.

2022
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:28,557
Bah Humbug.
