1
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,259
Lonesome night.

2
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:04,056
Babbits bawlin', wind bitin' the bone.

3
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,810
Wind like this...

4
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,021
full of voices.

5
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,234
Ancestry howlin' at you,

6
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:18,320
yibberin' stories.

7
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:25,160
All voices... tied up into one.

8
00:01:27,663 --> 00:01:29,999
One voice different...

9
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:32,293
One voice,

10
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:39,341
whisperin' out there,
spyin' from the dark.

11
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:44,179
That fangy devil,

12
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:48,183
Ol' Georgie himself.

13
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:53,522
Now you hear up close,

14
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:58,652
and I'll yarn you about
the first time we met,

15
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:01,071
eye to eye.

16
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,205
<i>And thus it was when I made the
acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose,</i>

17
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,082
<i>the man I hoped might
cure me of my afflictions.</i>

18
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,055
Have you lost something?

19
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,725
Question one.

20
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,940
What secret in Sixsmith report
would be worth killing for?

21
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,566
Question two.

22
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,821
Is it reasonable to believe that they
would kill again to protect that secret?

23
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,824
And if so, question three.

24
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,868
What the fuck am I doing here?

25
00:02:50,246 --> 00:02:53,081
<i>While my extensive
experience as an editor</i>

26
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:55,416
<i>has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks</i>

27
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,462
<i>and flash forwards, and
all such tricksy gimmicks,</i>

28
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:00,881
<i>I believe that if you, dear reader,</i>

29
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:04,051
<i>can extend your patience
for a just a moment,</i>

30
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:08,097
<i>you will find there is a
method to this tale of madness.</i>

31
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,058
<i>My dearest Sixsmith,</i>

32
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:14,520
<i>I shot myself through the
roof of my mouth this morning,</i>

33
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,355
<i>with Vivian Ayre's Luger.</i>

34
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:23,654
<i>A true suicide is a paced,
disciplined certainty.</i>

35
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,785
<i>People pontificate
"suicide is a coward's act".</i>

36
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:32,371
<i>Couldn't be further from the truth.</i>

37
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:35,332
<i>Suicide takes tremendous courage.</i>

38
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,087
Any problem, sir, you
just hit this button.

39
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,172
Thank you.

40
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:52,683
On behalf of my Ministry,
and the future of Unanimity,

41
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:56,186
I would like to thank you
for this final interview.

42
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,156
– Hello. – Press pass.

43
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,533
Expecting trouble?

44
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:14,079
I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher,
not his shrink or his astrologer,

45
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,290
and the ruddy, bloody truth is,

46
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:20,127
I had no idea what the man
was gonna do that night.

47
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:24,632
This beach was once a
cannibal's banqueting hall,

48
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:29,762
where the strong gorged on the weak,
but the teeth, sir, they spat out,

49
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,682
like you and I would
expel a cherry stone.

50
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,188
Do you know the price a quarter
pound of these will earn?

51
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,943
Remember this is not an
interrogation or a trial.

52
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,697
Your version of the
truth is all that matters.

53
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,034
Truth is singular.

54
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,664
Its "versions" are... mistruths.

55
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,834
<i>Don't let them say I
killed myself for love.</i>

56
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:05,129
<i>Had my infatuations, but
we both know in our hearts</i>

57
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,008
<i>who is the sole love of
my short, bright life.</i>

PACIFIC ISLANDS, 1849

60
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,122
There you are, Mr. Ewing,

61
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,834
as binding a covenant there
can ever be between men...

62
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,044
outside the province of Scripture.

63
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,045
Thank you, Reverend Horrox, I...

64
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,841
know my father-in-law is
profoundly excited about this deal.

65
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,635
Haskell Moore is a great man.

66
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:54,555
Future generations
depend on men like him,

67
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:57,474
men capable of speaking the truth.

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,934
Quite.

69
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,733
When I first encountered
Haskell Moore's writing,

70
00:06:05,774 --> 00:06:09,820
its perspicuity stroke me as though
delivered through divine revelation.

71
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,278
The learned doctor here and I,

72
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,741
already spent many a night
debating Mr. Moore's tractus.

73
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:16,131
I'm only willing to conceive
that he makes a compelling case

74
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,496
as to why we are sitting here,
enjoying this divine lamb,

75
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:23,918
while Kupaka stands
there, contempt to serve.

76
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:26,295
Indeed, ain'it. Uh, Kupaka...

77
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,132
you enjoy your life
here with us, do you not?

78
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,301
Oh, yes, Reverend, sir.

79
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,345
Kupaka very happy here.

80
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,722
See, you see, this is Moore's
ladder of civilization.

81
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,183
The reason behind this natural order...

82
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:40,768
Please, Giles, do shut up.

83
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,270
I've been listening
to this for weeks, I...

84
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:46,649
would love to know what his own
son-in-law has to say about it.

85
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,817
Let's see...

86
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:53,322
It is an inquiry concerning
God's will and the nature of men.

87
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,866
And what does he have to say
about the nature of women?

88
00:06:57,576 --> 00:07:01,247
I'm afraid that's a subject he
prefers to pass by in silence.

89
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,707
He wouldn't be the first.

90
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,960
Uh, prey, Mr. Ewing, continue.

91
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,547
Well, uh... the question
he does pose is...

92
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:13,841
if God created the world, how do
we know what things we can change,

93
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:17,638
and what things must remain
sacred and inviolable?

94
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,893
Reverend Horrox' real
specific how to run plantation.

95
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:25,354
Georgian way best way he say.

96
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:28,190
God, this heat is unbearable.
How do they take it?

97
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,150
Reverend Horrox say

98
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:33,195
slaves like camel, bred for desert.

99
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,199
He say... they not feel
heat like civilized folk.

100
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,743
Now we should get you out of the sun.

101
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:44,665
Now what... what is that noise?

102
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:52,066
– Ah, there you are. – What happened?

103
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:57,363
It is as I suspected.
Gusano Coco Cervello,

104
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,615
better known as the Polynesian worm.

105
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,868
Once saw a man's brain after
the worm had finished with him...

106
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,662
maggoty cauliflower. Ooph.

107
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:10,793
But have no fear, this particular
devil and I... are well acquainted.

108
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:15,589
Here we go. Ah, yes, yes, all gone.

109
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:23,264
I
- I don't know what I would have done had our paths not crossed.

110
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,182
Well for starters, you would have died.

111
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:29,812
I... I shall find a way to repay you.

112
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:34,483
Oh, unnecessary, I assure
you. I am a doctor, Adam.

113
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,319
A tiger cannot change its stripes.

114
00:09:38,195 --> 00:09:40,530
CAMBRIDGE, 1936

115
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:45,202
<i>Sixsmith, I do hope you will be able
to find it in your heart to forgive me.</i>

116
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:49,039
<i>Mr. Frobisher.</i>

117
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,003
<i>Mr. Robert Frobisher!</i>

118
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,466
The management would like a
word with you, please, sir.

119
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:06,223
<i>Mr. Frobisher, open this door, please!</i>

120
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,936
I do know you're in there,
Mr. Frobisher, please, comply.

121
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:18,235
A letter is being drafted
to your father, sir.

122
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,915
<i>Mr. Frobisher!</i>

123
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:36,086
<i>Hated leaving you like that.
Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind.</i>

124
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:44,136
<i>By the time you read this, I
will be on my way to Edinburgh,</i>

125
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,014
<i>on my way to fame and fortune.</i>

126
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:50,226
<i>I know you haven't heard
of him, but trust me,</i>

127
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:54,271
<i>Vivian Ayres is one of the
musical greats, Sixsmith.</i>

128
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:58,317
<i>The tragedy is that he hasn't produced
any new work in years due to illness.</i>

129
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:03,030
<i>My scheme is to persuade him
to hire me as his amanuensis,</i>

130
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:05,908
<i>and aid him in the
creation of a masterpiece,</i>

131
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,952
<i>before shooting up through
the musical firmament,</i>

132
00:11:08,953 --> 00:11:11,789
<i>eventually obliging
Pater to admit that yes,</i>

133
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:15,291
<i>the son he disinherited is none
other than Robert Frobisher,</i>

134
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:18,671
<i>the greatest British
composer of his time.</i>

135
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:23,175
<i>I know, Sixsmith, you groan and
shake your head, but you smile too,</i>

136
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,010
<i>which is why I love you.</i>

137
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,471
<i>P.S.:</i>

138
00:11:28,556 --> 00:11:30,015
<i>Thanks for the waistcoat.</i>

139
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:34,061
<i>I needed something of
yours to keep me company.</i>

140
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,481
St. George and the Dragon.

141
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,027
Reminds me that composing is a crusade.

142
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:44,697
Sometimes you slay the dragon,

143
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:48,242
sometimes the dragon slays you.

144
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:50,870
Alright, then.

145
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,372
Frobisher, is it?

146
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:56,709
I trust Mackerras told
you enough to be useful.

147
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,753
I've had this little melody for viola
rattling about my head for months,

148
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,631
let's see if you can get it down.

149
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,606
Subtle grace note before the third.

150
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:26,739
Soft and simple. Got it?
Now, it gets interesting.

151
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,751
Good.

152
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,419
Play that back.

153
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,423
Would love to, sir.

154
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,137
Um... what key are we in?

155
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:52,973
What key? G minor, of course.

156
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,059
And the time signature?

157
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,895
For Christ's sake,
did you hear it or not?

158
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:01,106
– Just... just need a
little more time. – You need?

159
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:04,109
My dear boy, who is
working for whom here?

160
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,820
– I apologize, sir... – Are you
an amanuensis or an apologist?

161
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:07,780
Now pay attention.

162
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,949
Three-four, changes to
four-four on fourth bar

163
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,617
and back to three-four on bar five,

164
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,452
if you can count that high.

165
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:18,374
Crotchet G, pause for a quaver, repeat
G quaver, then E-flat on the down beat.

166
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,127
And so on.

167
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:24,630
Alright, let me hear you.

168
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:54,827
Stop, please! You're hurting me!

169
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,122
You must have misheard me, I
said I had a melody not a malady!

170
00:13:58,163 --> 00:13:59,582
Vivian...

171
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:02,084
Jocasta, deliver me!

172
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:06,255
– What's going on in here?
– An exercise in futility.

173
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,631
Should I be introduced?

174
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:10,843
There's really no point, the
boy is useful as the clap.

175
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:13,637
Fortunately, he'll be
much easier to get rid of.

176
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:16,557
Would you be a dear and get
Henry to show the boy out.

177
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,726
Yes, of course, darling.

178
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:37,620
That's beautiful.

179
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,915
Yes...

180
00:14:41,874 --> 00:14:45,085
That's it. That's my melody!

181
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:50,507
SAN FRANCISCO, 1973

182
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:54,136
Com'on, Luisa, we're
made to be together!

183
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:56,680
Luisa, Luisa, com'on,
com'on, I'm telling you,

184
00:14:56,722 --> 00:14:59,183
I'm telling you baby, you
can't leave me. It's a...

185
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,727
Don't know if it's a past life
thing or a future life thing,

186
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,103
but you know, you and me...

187
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:07,566
Look. For the last hour, all I could think
about was throwing you off the balcony.

188
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:10,069
Well then who the
hell you think you are?

189
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:13,489
You write a bullshit
column for a fucking rag.

190
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,157
Elevator!

191
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:20,162
Thank you.

192
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,253
Nice to know the age
of chivalry isn't dead.

193
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,893
You okay?

194
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,646
No bones broken, I think.

195
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:50,317
No, no, no, you sit... you
sit yourself. Let me see.

196
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:02,288
Great. Power outage.

197
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:06,166
Perfect end to a perfect day.

198
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:13,632
Still glad the age of
chivalry isn't dead?

199
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:19,054
I'd still rather be right
here than back up there.

200
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:22,224
Guess Mr. Kipin isn't
everyone's cup of tea.

201
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:26,061
Guys like that are just
an occupational hazard.

202
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:31,942
– You were interviewing him?
– Yeah, for Spyglass magazine.

203
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,862
Luisa Rey.

204
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,947
Rufus Sixsmith.

205
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,033
Rey...

206
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:45,289
You wouldn't happen to be related
to the journalist Lester Rey?

207
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:48,500
Yeah. He was my father.

208
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:53,005
Really? He must have been
enormously proud of you,

209
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,174
– following in his footsteps. – Hmm.

210
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:00,262
That's her. My niece, Megan.

211
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,139
She's lovely!

212
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:06,518
Born physicist, with a better mind
for mathematics than I ever had.

213
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:10,522
Did her PhD at Cambridge,
a woman at Caius!

214
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,317
Gives you hope for the world.

215
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,155
It's hot.

216
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:23,702
And we're still here.

217
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:35,005
That's a very peculiar birthmark.

218
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,635
Yeah. My little comet.

219
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:42,888
My mother was sure it was cancer,

220
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:45,057
she wanted me to get it removed, but...

221
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:47,768
don't know. I kinda like it.

222
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:52,022
I knew someone who had
a birthmark that was...

223
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:54,942
– similar to that. – Really?

224
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:56,610
Who was it?

225
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,573
Someone I cared about very much.

226
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:09,039
A uh... a hypothetical
question for you, Miss Rey.

227
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,418
As a journalist,

228
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,546
what price would you pay
to protect the source?

229
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,464
Any.

230
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:19,466
Prison?

231
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,721
If it came to that, yes.

232
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,181
Would you be prepared to...

233
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,309
compromise your safety?

234
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:36,232
My father braved
booby-trapped marshes and

235
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:39,612
the wrath of generals for
his journalistic integrity.

236
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:44,575
What kind of daughter would I be if I
bailed when things got a little tough?

237
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:02,009
Saved.

238
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:04,136
Taxi!

239
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,390
– You sure you don't need a
cab? – No, I've got my car.

240
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:14,104
Well, you know if... there's
ever something I can do for you,

241
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,023
please give me a call.

242
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:18,817
Thank you, I will.

243
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:20,402
Bye.

244
00:19:24,823 --> 00:19:26,116
LONDON, 2012

245
00:19:26,242 --> 00:19:28,744
<i>It was the night of the Lemon Prizes,</i>

246
00:19:29,954 --> 00:19:32,790
<i>and in its two lead forced duality,</i>

247
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:36,001
<i>I recall a moment of introspection.</i>

248
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:42,424
<i>Why. Why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a publisher?</i>

249
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,719
<i>This was the precise
moment that Dermot found me.</i>

250
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:48,430
– Oy, Timothy. – Aah, Dermot.

251
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:51,267
<i>Bad news inexorably does.</i>

252
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:52,601
Fockin' waste.

253
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,520
Never forget Herman Melville,

254
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:59,441
writes a ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed,

255
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:02,695
and yet today, it is lugged
around in the backpacks

256
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:05,072
of every serious student
of literature in the world.

257
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:07,198
I don't give a fock what
happens when I'm dead,

258
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:09,034
I want people to buy me book now!

259
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:13,163
Well, as your publisher, obviously
nothing would make me happier.

260
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:15,541
But sadly, for whatever reason,

261
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:18,294
"Knuckle Sandwich" has yet
to connect to its audience.

262
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:20,504
You want a reason?
I'll give you a reason.

263
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:23,382
– Right there! – Aah.
You mean Mr. Finch?

264
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:25,342
Felix fockin' Finch!

265
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:30,472
That cunt that shat all over me
book in his poncy fockin' magazine!

266
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,975
– It wasn't that bad! – No?

267
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:40,441
"Mr. Hoggins should apologize to the
trees failed for the making of his

268
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:44,820
bloated autobio novel. Four
hundred vain-glorious pages

269
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:49,658
expire in an ending that is
flat and inane beyond belief. "

270
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:55,497
Steady now, Dermot. What is a
critic but one who reads quickly,

271
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:58,834
arrogantly, but never wisely.

272
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,799
Fock it.

273
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:07,885
Dermot!

274
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,271
Ladies and gentlemen!

275
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,567
We have an additional award
tonight, fellow book faeries.

276
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,987
An award for "most eminent critic".

277
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:30,157
Mr... oh, beg pardon,

278
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:35,579
SIR! Felix Finch. O, B and E!

279
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,628
And what might my prize be, I wonder?

280
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:46,757
A signed copy of an
unpulped "Knuckle Sandwich"?

281
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:49,176
Can't be many of those left.

282
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:54,223
Well...

283
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,977
Just what does that lead-less
pencil you call an imagination

284
00:21:58,978 --> 00:22:02,648
have in mind to end this scene. Hmm?

285
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:10,364
I think you're gonna love this one.

286
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:24,295
Now, that's an ending that
is flat n'inane beyond belief.

287
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:30,718
<i>My thoughts?</i>

288
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:34,471
<i>If I'm honest, I admit that
the obvious emotions like shock</i>

289
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:37,808
<i>and horror flew as
Finch had, here and gone.</i>

290
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,852
Tequila, couple of fingers.

291
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:44,105
<i>While deep down, I
experienced a nascent sense</i>

292
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:48,277
<i>of a silver lining to
this most tragic turn.</i>

293
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:54,617
<i>Overnight, Dermot "Dusty" Hoggins
became a cult hero to the common man.</i>

294
00:22:58,162 --> 00:23:04,418
<i>"Knuckle Sandwich" shifted ninety
thousand copies in less than two months.</i>

295
00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:07,922
<i>I was for the briefest
of moments, Cinderella,</i>

296
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:12,760
<i>and all memory of past misfortune
receded in the rearview mirror</i>

297
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:15,179
<i>of my dream come true.</i>

298
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:21,560
– What the fuck... – Tim-o-tee
Cavendish... oy presume.

299
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:23,145
Caught wi' your cacks down!

300
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:27,190
Uh, my office hours are
eleven to two, and my secretary

301
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:30,319
would be more than happy to schedule
an appointment if you so desire.

302
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:32,445
Friends like us don't need appointments.

303
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,240
We like it all cozy like this.

304
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:38,118
– Visited Dermot in the joint. –
Our brother's got a question for you.

305
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:41,163
Where's our focking money?

306
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,209
Boys. Boys, look here.

307
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:48,586
Dermot signed what we call a
copyright transfer contract,

308
00:23:48,587 --> 00:23:50,047
which means that legally...

309
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:54,927
Dermot didn't sign a fockin' contract
for the event of a fockin' season!

310
00:23:55,052 --> 00:24:00,391
Er, Perhap-perhaps... er, we
could moot a provisional sum...

311
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:03,049
as a basis for on-going negotiation.

312
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,218
Okeydokey.

313
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:09,024
What sum we gonna moot?

314
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,527
Fifty K will do for starters.

315
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,362
Fifty sounds reasonable.

316
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,239
Tomorrow afternoon.

317
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:17,241
Tomorrow afternoon?

318
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:19,036
– Cash. – No bullocks.

319
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:21,252
– No checks. – Old fashioned money.

320
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:22,744
Gentlemen...

321
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:25,332
– The law says... – The law?!

322
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,342
What'd the law do for
Felix fockin' Finch?

323
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:42,266
NEO SEOUL 2144

324
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:49,106
Ordinarily, I begin by asking prisoners
to recall their earliest memories...

325
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:54,445
to provide a context for the
corporatic historians of the future.

326
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,823
Fabricants have no such
memories, Archivist.

327
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:03,746
One twenty-four hour cycle in Papa
Song's is identical to every other.

328
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,708
May I say you speak
Consumer surprisingly well.

329
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:13,464
<i>It is unfortunate that the officials of
the Unanimity can only speak one language.</i>

330
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:18,135
As an officer of Unanimity, I am of
course restricted from using sub speak.

331
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,428
Of course.

332
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:24,558
Please describe a typical
twenty-four hour Papa Song cycle.

333
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:30,981
At hour four, each server
is woken by auto-stimulin.

334
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:39,573
From revival, we
proceed to the hygiener.

335
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:47,581
After dressing, we file into the dinery.

336
00:25:53,837 --> 00:25:58,884
At hour five, we man our stations
to greet the new day's consumers.

337
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:00,927
Welcome to Papa Song's.

338
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:06,225
For the next nineteen hours, we
input orders, tray food, vend drinks,

339
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:10,271
upstock condiments, wipe
tables, and bin garbage,

340
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:13,357
all done in strict
adherence to First Catechism.

341
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:18,195
What is the First Catechism?

342
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,447
"Honor Thy Consumer. "

343
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:24,076
After the final cleaning,

344
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:27,955
we imbibe one soap sack
and return to our sleep box.

345
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:31,750
That is the blueprint
of every single day.

346
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,504
Did you ever think about the future?

347
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:41,886
Papa Song servers have
just one possible future.

348
00:26:42,011 --> 00:26:44,722
You mean "Exultation".

349
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:47,725
Could you describe this
annual Rite of Passage?

350
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:53,814
On first day, Seer Rhee would
stamp a star on each of our collars.

351
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:57,943
Twelve stars meant an
end to our contract.

352
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:02,114
How did you feel when you watched
one of your sisters ascend?

353
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:03,782
Excitement.

354
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,285
I was happy for them,

355
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,412
but envious as well.

356
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,957
Did your sister servers feel as you did?

357
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,544
Most of them.

358
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:21,300
I would like to ask about
the infamous Yoona-939.

359
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:04,343
If Yoona-939 woke you, who woke her?

360
00:28:05,094 --> 00:28:07,012
Seer Rhee.

361
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:10,182
Why would Seer wake a server?

362
00:28:10,516 --> 00:28:13,435
Perhaps you should ask him, Archivist.

363
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,733
What's wrong with him?

364
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,363
He drinks soap.

365
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:27,366
It makes him happy.

366
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:33,080
Then he sleep like us in our box.

367
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:45,217
Do you ever think about... what it must
be like, up there with the consumers?

368
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:50,639
Third Catechism forbids such questions.

369
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,934
Yes. It does.

370
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,938
Come. Let me show you a secret.

371
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:02,693
<i>Platform four, Lost and Found.</i>

372
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:20,002
Now... Sonmia,

373
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:25,674
we are inside a secret.

374
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:31,805
A Kino?

375
00:29:32,348 --> 00:29:36,435
– We are not allowed, Sonmia.
– No one will ever know.

376
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:38,270
Come.

377
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:54,703
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

378
00:29:54,787 --> 00:29:58,165
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

379
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:06,102
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

380
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:10,302
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

381
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:14,098
You could have been excised.

382
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:17,309
How did you justify
such a risk to yourself?

383
00:30:17,935 --> 00:30:19,853
She was my friend.

384
00:30:21,397 --> 00:30:25,985
Please describe the events of
September 18th from your perspective.

385
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:29,697
I was stationed at pedestal one.

386
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:58,225
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse!

387
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:42,061
<i>Step away. Code yellow,
the area is secured.</i>

388
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:49,193
Hawaiian Islands 106
WINTERS AFTER THE FALL

389
00:31:49,318 --> 00:31:54,198
<i>Nay, this life all rot n'
lockin' no smile a' some yawnee.</i>

390
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:59,370
<i>In rear's time, I ever fest
the secret of Sloosha's hallow.</i>

391
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:04,583
<i>Adam, my bro' by law, n' his son n' me
been trekkin' back from Honokaa Market.</i>

392
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:11,423
<i>It was Adam's custom to cult out his
ancestry with offerin's n' honorin's.</i>

393
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:25,020
<i>Suddenwise, that fangy
devil's eyes, I felt'em.</i>

394
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:30,818
Who there?

395
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:42,079
Ooh, a darky spot you're in, friend.

396
00:32:42,121 --> 00:32:43,122
Ol' Georgie...

397
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:47,137
Ain't no blade can protect
you from the True-True.

398
00:32:47,294 --> 00:32:48,414
'Pa!

399
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:55,759
Jonas. Jonas, go. Go, go!

400
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:00,014
Zachary! Zachary?

401
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:01,807
Zachary!

402
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:15,779
Stay here, safe here...

403
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,622
Kona will be feastin' on
Adam n' his boy by sundown.

404
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:33,297
You say it all the time, ain'ya?

405
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:37,134
"The Weak are Meat, the Strong do Eat. "

406
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:48,270
The True-truth, what that is.

407
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,956
<i>Whole valley whisperin' about the
blood o' Adam and his son on my hands.</i>

408
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:10,751
<i>But Rose and Catkin never believed
those rumors, and stood by me.</i>

409
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:15,130
– Uncle Zach, look! – Yeah, I see them.

410
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:19,134
<i>Prescients come batterin' twice a year,</i>

411
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:21,387
<i>their ships creep-crawlin'
on the waves,</i>

412
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:24,682
<i>just floatin' on the
Smart o' the Old Uns.</i>

413
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:28,561
Barter'll be startin' soon.

414
00:34:30,062 --> 00:34:32,106
Yeah. We must go find ya' Ma.

415
00:34:40,864 --> 00:34:42,199
What are you doin'?

416
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:47,121
Ma says ya ain't been
right since Sloosha's.

417
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,583
She say we gotta keep
out our eyes on ya.

418
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:54,753
You mindin' me, while I mind the goats?

419
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:58,465
I see.

420
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:03,429
Stump is, who's gonna
mind your Ma at the Barter?

421
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:06,223
She got no tongue for
hagglin', not like you and me.

422
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:07,766
She doin' alright.

423
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:10,603
Swear by. Be home for suppin'.

424
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:17,902
<i>Why words slink n' slide off a
tongue, when we need them most?</i>

425
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:20,738
<i>If my tongue'd been more bold,</i>

426
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:24,742
<i>could I have stopped all that
diresome's about to happen?</i>

427
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:29,955
– Uncle Zach! – Thi's my
big bro I yawned you about.

428
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,626
– What's about, sis? –
Special guest hosting.

429
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:36,795
Thank you for the kindsome
hostin' in the Valley's day.

430
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:39,131
I ain't saysoe this, Rose.

431
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:43,510
– Abbess saysoe a gift of great
honor. – She can be hostin' then?

432
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:48,557
I brin' you gift, Zachry.

433
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,269
Need no gift from the stranger.

434
00:35:54,396 --> 00:35:59,068
<i>Now kin n' bros n' half-strangers, yay,
even the Abbess, they all come knockin',</i>

435
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:03,280
<i>they gaped in wonderment like Sonmi
herself was sittin' in our kitchen.</i>

436
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,994
<i>Questions about Prescience n' their
whoahsome Ship poured thick n'fast.</i>

437
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,914
How your ship's slidin',
glides so silent n'...

438
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,666
Fusion engines.

439
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:17,460
<i>No one queried what fusion engine was,</i>

440
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:20,589
<i>cos they didn't want to look
stupid in front o' the gatherin'.</i>

441
00:36:20,673 --> 00:36:22,216
Fusion engines...

442
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:26,095
<i>True really was, Meronym
answered the questions,</i>

443
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:28,764
<i>but no answer ever quenched your curio.</i>

444
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:32,810
<i>All o' that answerin' done was
teach everyone to not trust her,</i>

445
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:34,353
<i>nay, not a flea...</i>

446
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:38,566
She's lyin'...

447
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,653
Schemin' and wormin' herself in.

448
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:46,699
Watch her, watch her close.

449
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:51,120
She's got secrets.

450
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,043
Zachry Bailey?

451
00:37:39,084 --> 00:37:41,670
Sorrysome for wakin'
you up but... a dream.

452
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:44,256
Some diresome's gonna happen.

453
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:45,674
Come in, come in.

454
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:50,387
Ooh, that Sonmi got your heart.

455
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:53,891
Ohh, I gonna hear it for us,

456
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:56,393
I'm prayin' for you.

457
00:37:56,815 --> 00:38:01,148
Ooh, Old Georgie's
hungerin' for your soul.

458
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,192
Ooh, I knew it.

459
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,946
Spit a cuss on your dreams.

460
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,665
"Bridge is broken, hide below"

461
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,459
"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"

462
00:38:20,584 --> 00:38:24,505
"Enemy's sleepin',
don't slit that throat"

463
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,508
An augurin'...

464
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,724
Trust Sonmi...

465
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:42,439
Keep her warnin' with you,
nail it to your memory.

466
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:47,903
Thank you. Thank you, Abbess. Thank you.

467
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,182
Wait! Wait.

468
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:21,186
There's... no reason to hide.

469
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:27,860
I know you are... Sonmi-451.

470
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:33,240
My name is... Hae-Ju Zheng.

471
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:37,494
What has happened to Seer Rhee?

472
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,997
Soap overdose.

473
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:44,543
It is unfortunate that it had to
happen with everything gone so well.

474
00:39:45,294 --> 00:39:47,378
Cos now it is probable
that the Enforcers

475
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:50,132
and the DNA sniffers
will find out about you.

476
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,301
And if they do...

477
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:56,472
if they realize your connection
to Yoona-939, you will be excised.

478
00:39:58,182 --> 00:40:00,226
But you have a choice.

479
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,481
You can remain here and
risk being discovered,

480
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:09,693
or you can come with me.

481
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,792
– Bear away, boy. – Aye, aye captain.

482
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:31,924
<i>Friday the 15th. We made
sail with the morning tide.</i>

483
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,511
<i>Mr. Boerhaave had my cabin changed.</i>

484
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:40,057
<i>I have been quarantined to a store room
away from the other passengers and crew.</i>

485
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:44,061
<i>Henry argued in vain that the
Polynesian worm was not contagious.</i>

486
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:45,563
<i>Not that it matters.</i>

487
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,062
<i>All I want to do now is return home</i>

488
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:49,316
<i>and unburden myself
from this responsibility.</i>

489
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:56,198
<i>My dear Sixsmith, I am in
desperate need of your help.</i>

490
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:59,410
<i>After my last letter, I'm sure
you're rushing to pack your bags,</i>

491
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,995
<i>but you needn't, really.</i>

492
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,000
<i>Unless of course, you wish to witness
the rebirth of Robert Frobisher.</i>

493
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:14,717
<i>Is it not miraculous how one's fortune
can turn so quickly, so completely.</i>

494
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:18,053
<i>One moment, leaping from
a hotel window, the next</i>

495
00:41:18,137 --> 00:41:22,182
<i>gainfully employed by one of the
world's greatest living composers.</i>

496
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:26,478
<i>My only problem is that I
accidentally got hooked on a journal</i>

497
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:29,439
<i>written in 1849 by a dying
lawyer during the voyage</i>

498
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,151
<i>from the Pacific
islands to San Francisco.</i>

499
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:35,904
<i>To my great annoyance, the
pages cease mid-sentence.</i>

500
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:39,073
<i>Half the book is missing.
It's completely getting me.</i>

501
00:41:39,074 --> 00:41:41,076
<i>Could you be a mensch and
when you're next foraging</i>

502
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:43,120
<i>at Otto's Book's, make an inquiry?</i>

503
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:49,293
<i>A half finished book is, after
all, a half finished love affair.</i>

504
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:59,011
America loves oil.

505
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:02,556
America is addicted to oil.

506
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:07,311
Some fantasize about
wind turbines or peat gas.

507
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,541
But I'm here today to
tell you that the cure

508
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,403
for oil is right here.
The cure is nuclear power.

509
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:18,906
The cure is Swannekke.

510
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:31,043
<i>Hello, Miss Rey. I'm frightfully
sorry for calling you at this hour.</i>

511
00:42:31,377 --> 00:42:33,254
Dr. Sixsmith?

512
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:34,421
<i>I need help.</i>

513
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:40,093
I need £ 50,000, not 2,000, 50,000!

514
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:42,763
<i>I'm going through it again, Mr.
Cavendish, but the total's right.</i>

515
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:45,182
<i>2,343 pounds and 16 pence.</i>

516
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:49,228
How is this possible? The
ruddy money was pouring in.

517
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:52,898
<i>Debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish.
Solvency has its drawbacks.</i>

518
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,943
<i>The situation looked dire,</i>

519
00:42:56,944 --> 00:43:01,532
<i>but I knew that Timothy
Cavendish's capital in this town</i>

520
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:04,618
<i>could not be defined by an
accountant's balance sheet!</i>

521
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,870
McCluskie!

522
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:08,789
Look, how are those
delightful kiddies of yours?

523
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:16,463
Mon cher, tis "Cavendish the
Ravenous," your favorite Timothy.

524
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:18,674
Mon cher?

525
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:21,594
You heard it correctly,
Charles Dickens' own original

526
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:25,639
authentic writing desk for £
60,000. I think that's very fair.

527
00:43:25,723 --> 00:43:28,350
<i>But our records indicate that
the desk is already accounted for</i>

528
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:29,852
<i>by the Dickens House Museum.</i>

529
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:32,771
Okay, what about Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's desk?

530
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:44,491
<i>In the darkness, I
suddenly saw the light.</i>

531
00:43:44,617 --> 00:43:47,328
<i>Blood has always trumped water.</i>

532
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:50,831
<i>If the Hogginses brutes wanted
to turn this into a family affair,</i>

533
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:56,128
<i>they'd find the Cavendish Clan more
than ready for the task at hand.</i>

534
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,925
Oh, Satan's gonads, not again. Look,

535
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:04,345
just bugger off and leave us in peace.
I'm only gonna asking you nicely once.

536
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:05,429
Good to see you, Denny.

537
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:08,599
I'm not lending you a ruddy farthing
until you pay back the last lot.

538
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:12,061
Why-Why should I be forever
giving you a hand out?

539
00:44:12,228 --> 00:44:13,687
Denny...

540
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,941
I had a minor running
with the wrong sort.

541
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:21,403
If I don't get my hands on £ 60,000,
I got to get an awful beating.

542
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:24,281
Well, get them to video it for
us, would you? Now fuck off.

543
00:44:24,615 --> 00:44:27,826
– I'm not joking, Denholme.
– Why is this my problem?

544
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:31,163
Because we're brothers!
Don't you have a conscience?

545
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:35,626
Couple of my special little pills
and a G&T should just set me right.

546
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:38,254
Denny. Help.

547
00:44:40,756 --> 00:44:42,007
Please.

548
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:45,302
Den, who are you talking to?

549
00:44:45,761 --> 00:44:49,431
– Hello, Georgette. – Hello, Timothy.

550
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:56,730
Right. Right, right.

551
00:44:56,772 --> 00:44:58,023
What did you-60 grand?

552
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:59,942
It's gonna take some time, but, uh...

553
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:02,778
in the interim, I've got the
perfect place for you to hide.

554
00:45:05,698 --> 00:45:10,035
<i>I begun to fear I might never hold
my beloved Tilda in her arms again.</i>

555
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:15,082
<i>My parasite writhes at night,
igniting spasms of pain,</i>

556
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:18,377
<i>while visions and voices,
obscene and monstrous, haunt me.</i>

557
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:20,254
Mister Ewing...

558
00:45:20,796 --> 00:45:22,339
In the name of God!

559
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,135
Mister Ewing, no fear.

560
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,304
No harm, not shout.

561
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:31,599
Please. My name Autua.

562
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:35,436
You know I... see Moriori whip I...

563
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:37,813
You know I.

564
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:44,153
– What do you want?
– You help, Mr. Ewing.

565
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:47,406
If you no help, I in trouble dead.

566
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:50,242
Well, you're already very
much "in trouble dead. "

567
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:51,952
The Prophetess is a mercantile vessel,

568
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:54,371
not an underground railroad
for escaping slaves.

569
00:45:54,622 --> 00:45:57,708
I be able seaman, I earn passage.

570
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,753
Well, then I suggest you surrender
to the captain's mercies forthwith.

571
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:04,131
Wow wow. They no hear I.

572
00:46:04,715 --> 00:46:08,636
They say "swim away home, nigger",
and throw I in drink, but you...

573
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:12,514
you law man, right? Please.
Captain hear you, Mr. Ewing.

574
00:46:12,556 --> 00:46:14,516
I
- I can't help you.

575
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:19,146
I'm afraid your fate is entirely
your own, and I desire no part in it.

576
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:22,691
Then kill I.

577
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:24,568
Don't be absurd...

578
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:29,573
If you no help, you kill I just
the same, is true. You know it.

579
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:32,243
I'm be no fish food, Mr. Ewing.

580
00:46:32,284 --> 00:46:35,913
Die here better. Do it.

581
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:38,707
Do it quick.

582
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,378
I found an old transway marker, Captain.

583
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:45,005
It's got to be the red mountain.

584
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:48,300
The problem is, the valley
people are afraid of it.

585
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:50,469
They think the Devil lives up there.

586
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:54,181
I can't find anybody to guide
me through the Kona territory.

587
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:55,849
Meronym...

588
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:59,812
Every day you're out there,
you increase your odd levels.

589
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:03,607
This dream of yours is going
to kill you. And for what?

590
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:06,986
The Off-World colonies
may no longer exist.

591
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:08,821
I got to go, Captain.

592
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,659
Thank you for coming, I'm in 1404.

593
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:15,870
<i>I'll be right up.</i>

594
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:57,161
Dr. Sixsmith?

595
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:10,883
It's me, Luisa.

596
00:48:58,097 --> 00:49:00,766
Go call the police. Right
now, call the police!

597
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:41,891
<i>My dear Sixsmith, you alone can
understand how I'm feeling right now.</i>

598
00:49:42,016 --> 00:49:47,021
<i>Today, Ayrs and I presented our first
collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring,</i>

599
00:49:47,146 --> 00:49:49,899
<i>Ayrs favorite conductor
who arrived from Berlin.</i>

600
00:49:50,858 --> 00:49:54,277
<i>It's called "eternal recurrence".
Wish you could hear it.</i>

601
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:57,363
<i>It's the most accomplished tone
poem I know of written since the war,</i>

602
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:58,824
<i>and I tell you, Sixsmith,</i>

603
00:49:58,825 --> 00:50:02,286
<i>that more than of the few
of its best ideas are mine.</i>

604
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:13,047
At our time of life, Ayrs, a man
has no right to such daring ideas.

605
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:20,846
I suppose I've won a rearguard action
or two in my war against decrepitude.

606
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:24,725
<i>Diner of pheasant with
Bordeaux rich as buttercream.</i>

607
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,518
<i>How I love to listen to
men of distinguished lives,</i>

608
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:30,648
<i>sing of past follies and glories.</i>

609
00:50:30,773 --> 00:50:34,610
<i>The only broken note in the entire
evening was Ayrs wife, Jocasta,</i>

610
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:37,321
<i>excusing herself early.</i>

611
00:50:38,155 --> 00:50:41,867
<i>Sensed the buried bone.
Later I asked Ayrs about it.</i>

612
00:50:41,992 --> 00:50:45,371
<i>He said Kesselring had
introduced Jocasta to him.</i>

613
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:48,958
<i>I pried, had Kesselring
been in love with her?</i>

614
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,418
<i>The subject was a prickly one.</i>

615
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,546
Jocasta is a Jew.

616
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:56,465
Obviously her relationship
was impossible.

617
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,259
Why obviously?

618
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:04,390
Can you really be so ignorant
of what is happening in Germany?

619
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:08,477
<i>At this point in my life,
all I know, Sixsmith,</i>

620
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:13,148
<i>is that this world spins
from the same unseen forces</i>

621
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,234
<i>that twist our hearts.</i>

622
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,446
– How is it, Mr. Zachry? – Thin whiles.

623
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:22,783
– Minding some company? – Nay.

624
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,493
But...

625
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:28,998
Goats, and so do herders,
they're known for housin' temper.

626
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:33,210
Feelin' that own n'
your reveal count out,

627
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:35,963
for invadin' your house with no saysoe.

628
00:51:36,088 --> 00:51:37,798
True sorrysome.

629
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:41,135
Well it... Now it's done.

630
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,682
So, you mindin' a stranger
coverin' about your thrivin'?

631
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:49,935
Swap you. Query for query.

632
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:53,689
Fair buy.

633
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:58,110
Cog you and come dow. Learn
stitchin' n' milkin' our heardin'.

634
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,488
Why you here?

635
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:04,033
I needin' a guide.

636
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,994
Guide? To where?

637
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:10,289
Mauna Sol.

638
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:20,799
<i>"Bridge is broken, hide below"</i>

639
00:52:22,843 --> 00:52:24,303
What's wrong?

640
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:58,003
<i>We cross and recross our old
tracks like figure skaters.</i>

641
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:01,006
<i>And just as I was
reading a new submission,</i>

642
00:53:01,298 --> 00:53:04,176
<i>a powerful déjà-vu
ran through my bones.</i>

643
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,806
<i>I had been there before.</i>

644
00:53:09,181 --> 00:53:11,559
<i>Another lifetime ago.</i>

645
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:14,311
<i>Ursula.</i>

646
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:18,315
<i>The love of my life.</i>

647
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,193
<i>I could think of no
other serious applicants.</i>

648
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:24,530
<i>What had happened to her?</i>

649
00:53:24,655 --> 00:53:26,615
<i>And more importantly,</i>

650
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,701
<i>what had happened to the young man</i>

651
00:53:28,742 --> 00:53:32,162
<i>who had ridden the same
train composing sonnets,</i>

652
00:53:32,788 --> 00:53:35,457
<i>to his so bound a love.</i>

653
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,793
Your augurin' come true, Abbess.

654
00:53:37,918 --> 00:53:39,711
Broke bridge, just like you say.

655
00:53:39,712 --> 00:53:43,007
Meronym wa' there, yeb her
aback, trackin' up Mauna Sol,

656
00:53:43,132 --> 00:53:46,260
why can this Prescient woman come
cursin' n' twistin' on my life?

657
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:48,721
Mind the words of Sonmi.

658
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:54,935
"Our lives are not our own.

659
00:53:55,811 --> 00:53:59,565
From womb to tomb, we
are bound to others.

660
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:04,153
Past and present.

661
00:54:06,113 --> 00:54:08,365
And by each crime...

662
00:54:10,284 --> 00:54:12,953
and every kindness...

663
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:15,873
rebirth our future. "

664
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:27,134
Welcome to Neo Seoul.

665
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,398
Come on, out you come.

666
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,443
This... maybe the biggest
mistake of my life, but here.

667
00:54:45,444 --> 00:54:47,529
Thank you, Mr. Ewing.

668
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:53,409
Now to tell the truth, I was
worried you might try and eat me,

669
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,246
if you didn't get
something in the stomach.

670
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:57,706
Oh, you safe, Mr. Ewing.

671
00:54:57,831 --> 00:54:59,708
I no like white meat.

672
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:03,837
Ah. Right.

673
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:08,425
Before I decide what
I'm going to do with you,

674
00:55:09,802 --> 00:55:12,596
tell me why you were
being whipped so savagely?

675
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:15,224
My uncle was a sailor.

676
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,602
He took me on a French whaler
when I was ten years old.

677
00:55:18,727 --> 00:55:20,938
Seen too much of the world.

678
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:23,440
I no good slave.

679
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:27,152
Why did you look at me?

680
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:30,573
Pain strong, right?

681
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:33,492
Friends eye more strong.

682
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:38,038
Look, you are a runaway
slave, and I am a lawyer.

683
00:55:38,831 --> 00:55:41,333
How did you imagine we
could possibly be friends?

684
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,007
All you need.

685
00:55:58,475 --> 00:55:59,810
Ah, Jesus!

686
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:02,754
Javier Gomez, what did I tell
you about jumping onto my balcony?

687
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:05,315
Why d'you leave the door open
if you don't want me to come in?

688
00:56:05,316 --> 00:56:06,400
Because, smarty pants,

689
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:09,068
the only thing worse than having
you jumping onto my balcony,

690
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:12,448
is the idea of you jumping onto my
balcony, and being stuck out there.

691
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:13,657
Okay!

692
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:16,619
What are you reading?

693
00:56:19,997 --> 00:56:21,373
Old letters.

694
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:27,213
<i>Sixsmith, the plot has
taken a sensual turn.</i>

695
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:30,548
<i>Last week, Jocasta and I became lovers.</i>

696
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:34,553
<i>But don't alarm yourself, it is only
a carnal act, performed in service,</i>

697
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:37,389
<i>not unlike my role as amanuensis.</i>

698
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:43,729
<i>And I confess women's hearts like
their desire remain a mystery to me.</i>

699
00:56:47,024 --> 00:56:51,278
<i>Afterward, she cried and thanked me
for bringing life back into their home.</i>

700
00:56:51,403 --> 00:56:55,241
<i>I can get clear that Vivian
had been there the entire night,</i>

701
00:56:55,366 --> 00:57:00,579
<i>between us like the silence between
notes, that holds the key to warm music.</i>

702
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:06,293
<i>Best news of all,</i>

703
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:08,921
<i>I've started my own work.</i>

704
00:57:14,176 --> 00:57:18,806
Uh, I... called about an old recording,

705
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,976
written by a man named Robert Frobisher.

706
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,728
Oops. Passed it.

707
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:27,564
I know I shouldn't be
pulling it, I was...

708
00:57:27,565 --> 00:57:29,733
checking it to make
sure it wasn't scratched,

709
00:57:29,858 --> 00:57:33,194
but... honestly,

710
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:35,364
I just can't stop listening to it.

711
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:37,741
This is the Cloud Atlas Sextet?

712
00:57:39,567 --> 00:57:41,453
It's... the symphony.

713
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,794
It's beautiful.

714
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:51,212
but I think I've heard this before.

715
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:53,549
I can't imagine how.

716
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:57,803
I doubt there's no more than a... handful
copies in the whole of North America.

717
00:57:57,928 --> 00:57:59,471
But I know it.

718
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:03,559
I know I know it.

719
00:58:04,018 --> 00:58:10,065
<i>Before I realized it, my feet had brought
me back to the Temple of Sacrifice,</i>

720
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,443
<i>where I offered up my virginity.</i>

721
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:15,321
<i>Back to those four-days of Paradise,</i>

722
00:58:15,362 --> 00:58:19,116
<i>when Ursula's Mater and
Pater slift off to Greece,</i>

723
00:58:19,283 --> 00:58:21,118
<i>for a long weekend...</i>

724
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,665
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

725
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:29,627
Ursula!

726
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:32,421
Naked.

727
00:58:33,297 --> 00:58:37,259
Sir! Madam! I assure you
this is completely innocent...

728
00:58:41,555 --> 00:58:44,475
<i>Two sprained ankles, one cracked rib.</i>

729
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,937
<i>Official cause of accident,
listed on hospital form...</i>

730
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,021
<i>pussy.</i>

731
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:56,528
<i>What were the chances that
she still lived in this house?</i>

732
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:00,908
<i>And yet, there she was.</i>

733
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:03,077
<i>Ursula.</i>

734
00:59:04,036 --> 00:59:07,790
<i>Why had I never returned
her calls or letters?</i>

735
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:12,878
<i>Shame, spinessless, hallmarks
of the Cavendish clan.</i>

736
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:19,260
<i>I realized I had a choice. I could
slink off and continue as planned,</i>

737
00:59:19,385 --> 00:59:21,398
<i>or I could go boldly to the door,</i>

738
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:24,390
and discover what hope,
if any, would lay within.

739
00:59:26,308 --> 00:59:28,227
Abbess, come quick,
it's the Bailey girl.

740
00:59:28,352 --> 00:59:30,396
– Catkin? – Aye, she dyin'.

741
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:36,675
– What-what... – Zach.

742
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:42,866
– Sonmi... – It's scorpion fish.

743
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:46,287
Healer said she be gone by sundown.

744
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:49,582
Ain't right, ain't fair,
but nothing to be done.

745
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:00,426
Be very still.

746
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:03,304
Termination charge. Here!

747
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:07,391
Just enough to blow your carotid.

748
01:00:34,084 --> 01:00:35,794
How does it feel?

749
01:00:37,963 --> 01:00:39,340
Good.

750
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,762
Catkin's dying!

751
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:47,681
– What? – She trod on a scorpion fish.

752
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:52,185
You can save her. You got
spesh smart in that gearbag,

753
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,813
what'll save her. That's the True-true!

754
01:00:54,939 --> 01:00:58,108
Prescient Councils
swear by a special order.

755
01:00:58,234 --> 01:01:01,194
Say I can't go play Lady Sonmi
for everythin' twistin' wrong,

756
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:04,198
and click fingers, make right.

757
01:01:04,323 --> 01:01:07,450
I just a stupid goat herder but I cog
you're killin' Catkin by not actin',

758
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:11,247
just... by lettin' you up on
that bridge, you Kona meat.

759
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,461
If a Prescient be layin', with
poison meltin' her heart n'lungs?

760
01:01:17,545 --> 01:01:19,547
If it be your kin?

761
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:23,717
Why the Precient's life
worth more than a Valleysman?!

762
01:01:33,352 --> 01:01:35,771
I'll take you to Mauna Sol.

763
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,982
I know the way!

764
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:40,109
If you save Catkin,

765
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:44,321
I will guide you to the Devil's
door, if that's where you wanna go.

766
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:54,248
<i>While apast me, Coltworth was
the enchantment of a siren,</i>

767
01:01:54,373 --> 01:01:58,794
<i>better, I believed, to stay the
course set by dear brother Den.</i>

768
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:00,921
Just sign right here.

769
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:09,263
<i>Tomorrow, life could begin
afresh, afresh, afresh.</i>

770
01:02:09,388 --> 01:02:10,514
This way.

771
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:16,437
Come.

772
01:02:30,534 --> 01:02:32,119
<i>Designating texture.</i>

773
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,342
That's old Seoul.

774
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:49,511
If the tides keep rising
at their present rate,

775
01:02:49,553 --> 01:02:52,389
Neo-Seoul will also be under
water in a hundred years.

776
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:28,842
Your food is in here.

777
01:03:29,635 --> 01:03:33,055
It's not what you're used to,
but I think you will like it.

778
01:03:34,265 --> 01:03:35,975
This is your bed...

779
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,395
These are your clothes.

780
01:03:43,065 --> 01:03:47,611
Mine? But these are...
Pureblood clothes.

781
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:50,155
No. They are yours.

782
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:53,450
Did you know he was Union?

783
01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:56,412
No, but it wouldn't have mattered.

784
01:03:56,537 --> 01:03:58,372
Why not?

785
01:03:58,497 --> 01:04:00,207
Because...

786
01:04:00,332 --> 01:04:04,378
It was the first time a
Pureblood had showed me kindness.

787
01:04:11,969 --> 01:04:13,637
I hungry.

788
01:04:38,537 --> 01:04:40,206
Do you like them?

789
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,418
You look lovely.

790
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:47,004
Here...

791
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,132
Come here.

792
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:55,387
Now, this used to play Vidis,
but the chip is corrupted.

793
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:59,099
Stuck in a loop, so I digit
it and found the rest of it.

794
01:04:59,225 --> 01:05:00,851
The rest of it?

795
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,609
...the bloody hell are
you doing in my room?

796
01:05:21,632 --> 01:05:26,335
Keys... go walkies, let's give these
to Miss Judd for safekeeping, shall we?

797
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,797
Leave my things alone,
you pilvering cow.

798
01:05:30,506 --> 01:05:35,761
Cause you're new, I shall not make
you eat soap powder, this time...

799
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:36,887
You're warned.

800
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:41,100
I cannot stand for offensive language
in our arrays, not from anyone.

801
01:05:41,225 --> 01:05:44,728
And I never make idle
threats, Mr. Cavendish. Never.

802
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:47,982
I'll talk to you as I
ruddy will like, you thief!

803
01:05:48,107 --> 01:05:51,860
Make me eat soap powder?
I'd like to see you try.

804
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:55,155
Ooh, bloody hell!

805
01:05:56,115 --> 01:05:58,784
A disappointing start.

806
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:02,580
Is this some sort of kinky S&M hotel?

807
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:07,793
I am nurse Noakes, you
do not wish to cross me.

808
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,137
I am so sorry to keep you
waiting. Uh, I know it's a Miss...

809
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:19,388
Rey.

810
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:23,142
– Luisa Rey, Spyglass
magazine. – Right, right.

811
01:06:23,267 --> 01:06:26,979
Luisa, this is Joe
Napier, our security chief.

812
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:29,315
I was surprised to get your query.

813
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,484
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it-it is a feisty magazine, but...

814
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,403
Anything you need,
sir, just let me know.

815
01:06:34,445 --> 01:06:37,031
We'll do. Guys, I'm
good, thank you very much.

816
01:06:37,948 --> 01:06:40,450
Our editor's trying to
spice things up a little bit,

817
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:42,912
he says the public wants
more substance, so...

818
01:06:43,037 --> 01:06:44,330
Probably just a fad.

819
01:06:45,915 --> 01:06:49,043
Come on, follow me, let's start
you with the Chicken Ranch.

820
01:06:49,168 --> 01:06:50,961
That is where we keep the Eggheads.

821
01:07:01,096 --> 01:07:04,516
Hello, Mr. Cavendish,
feeling super this morning?

822
01:07:04,642 --> 01:07:09,188
No. I checked in last night, believing
that Aurora House was a hotel.

823
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:13,275
My brother made the booking you
see, his idea of a practical joke.

824
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,488
But listen, you have a
bigger problem closer to home.

825
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:20,990
There's some demented bitch
calling herself Noakes,

826
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:25,037
rampaging about the place,
impersonating a chamber maid.

827
01:07:25,663 --> 01:07:30,876
But the point is this: she
struck me, and she stole my keys.

828
01:07:33,212 --> 01:07:36,632
Right? I'll need those
keys back, straight away.

829
01:07:37,716 --> 01:07:41,762
Aurora House is your home now,
Mr. Cavendish. Your signature

830
01:07:41,887 --> 01:07:44,265
– authorizes us to apply... – Signature?

831
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:47,601
The custody document
you signed last night.

832
01:07:47,726 --> 01:07:49,687
Your residency papers.

833
01:07:49,728 --> 01:07:53,315
Oh no, no, no. That
was the hotel register.

834
01:07:53,357 --> 01:07:56,277
Ah, never mind, it's all academic, huh?

835
01:07:56,402 --> 01:07:59,071
This is gonna make a hell
of a diner party story.

836
01:07:59,113 --> 01:08:02,616
Most of our guests get cold
feet on their first mornings.

837
01:08:02,741 --> 01:08:04,660
– My keys, please.

838
01:08:04,702 --> 01:08:08,122
– Residents are not... –
I'm not a ruddy resident!

839
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:11,166
You'll find temper tantrums
won't help you at Aurora House!

840
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:14,169
You're breaking the... ruddy...

841
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,133
acting... conservation
act, or some ruddy thing,

842
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:22,761
and I will not be subjugated
to a criminal abuse.

843
01:08:25,306 --> 01:08:29,727
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

844
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:41,030
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes
are forming on slate roofs.</i>

845
01:08:41,155 --> 01:08:47,411
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in
Vermont, I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

846
01:08:47,536 --> 01:08:52,124
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

847
01:09:00,674 --> 01:09:02,218
Off somewhere?

848
01:09:02,593 --> 01:09:05,888
You bet I am. To the land of the living.

849
01:09:07,765 --> 01:09:14,688
Soylent Green is people.
Soylent Green is made of people!

850
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:19,068
Oy! Get back here, you!

851
01:09:21,237 --> 01:09:23,905
You keep away from me, or
I'll be forced to name you,

852
01:09:23,906 --> 01:09:25,908
in the police report, as an accomplice.

853
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:27,785
I have better things to do than this.

854
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:32,331
Then go, pit and do them,
you bloody sucker son of...

855
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,501
Right!

856
01:09:38,546 --> 01:09:42,216
God, you take hands off
me, you ruddy bloody...

857
01:09:44,718 --> 01:09:50,015
You can maintain power over people,
as long as you give them something.

858
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:55,187
Rob a man of everything, and that
man will no longer be in your power.

859
01:09:56,021 --> 01:10:00,150
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 20th
century philosopher complete works,

860
01:10:00,401 --> 01:10:02,611
and by Unanimity.

861
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:05,447
How do you know about him?

862
01:10:05,573 --> 01:10:06,865
Hae-Ju.

863
01:10:09,785 --> 01:10:13,080
– Sir Zheng. – Please,
you must call me Hae-Ju.

864
01:10:14,248 --> 01:10:15,416
Hae-Ju...

865
01:10:17,668 --> 01:10:20,963
Fabricants can be excised for this...

866
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:25,092
Well, survival often
demands some courage.

867
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:45,654
<i>Knowledge is a mirror, and
for the first time in my life,</i>

868
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:50,743
<i>I was allowed to see who I
was, and who I might become.</i>

869
01:10:58,375 --> 01:11:00,294
Go clean the head.

870
01:11:01,545 --> 01:11:02,838
Good morning, captain.

871
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:07,009
You're the hell that remains,
old quail cock, by buggering off.

872
01:11:07,134 --> 01:11:09,595
I'm afraid I can't do it, sir.

873
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:12,764
If I was, I would be unable
to inform you of the stow-away

874
01:11:12,765 --> 01:11:14,934
– that I have discovered
in my... – Stow-away?

875
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:17,561
I assure you that this
Moriori had no choice.

876
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:21,232
Now he has sworn to me that he is
a first class, able bodied seaman,

877
01:11:21,273 --> 01:11:23,609
capable of earning passage
if only given a chance.

878
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:29,031
Stow-away? He's a stow-away,
even if he shits silver nuggets.

879
01:11:30,532 --> 01:11:33,994
Did he ever explain anything to you?

880
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:39,792
He told me their goal was the
creation of a free willed Fabricant.

881
01:11:41,502 --> 01:11:43,546
Yoona had failed.

882
01:11:44,296 --> 01:11:46,382
I was their last hope.

883
01:11:50,928 --> 01:11:54,639
I have to say if all lady
journalists look like you,

884
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,936
I might start to take this, uh,
women's lib thing more seriously.

885
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:01,981
Well, I'm sure they can use your sort.

886
01:12:03,232 --> 01:12:04,525
Nice.

887
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:08,779
Okay, uh, you wait here and I will
go find someone smarter who can, uh,

888
01:12:08,821 --> 01:12:11,240
walk you through the details
of some of your questions.

889
01:12:11,282 --> 01:12:12,449
Right.

890
01:12:32,386 --> 01:12:33,846
What would Dad do?

891
01:12:42,646 --> 01:12:45,649
Who the bloody hell is this?
Have you any idea what time it is?

892
01:12:45,774 --> 01:12:48,193
<i>– Denny, it's me, Tim.
- Timothee?</i>

893
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:50,738
Where are you?

894
01:12:50,863 --> 01:12:54,033
<i>Ah, I think you ruddy
know about where I am.</i>

895
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:56,619
But residents are
denied access to phones.

896
01:12:56,702 --> 01:12:58,037
<i>Someone smuggled one in?</i>

897
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:01,832
<i>– You know the rules?
- I helped write them, Timmy.</i>

898
01:13:01,957 --> 01:13:05,294
<i>I have been a principal investor
in Aurora House for twelve years,</i>

899
01:13:05,419 --> 01:13:06,587
it's incredibly lucrative.

900
01:13:06,629 --> 01:13:10,174
You can't believe what people
would pay to lock-out their parents.

901
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:13,594
Look, Den, you've had your fun,

902
01:13:13,886 --> 01:13:17,181
I think it's high time you put an
end to this little game of yours.

903
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:21,810
No, no, no, Timmy.
My fun has just begun.

904
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:23,354
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

905
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:26,023
I am your brother, why
are you doing this to me?

906
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:30,778
<i>I think the better question is-would
be, what have you done to deserve this?</i>

907
01:13:30,903 --> 01:13:32,446
I don't know what you mean.

908
01:13:32,571 --> 01:13:35,199
Oh come, naughty old
brother, don't insult me.

909
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:38,702
You can't think that I didn't
know about you and Georgette!

910
01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:41,455
Georgette?

911
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:46,502
Look, Den...

912
01:13:46,627 --> 01:13:48,546
I didn't mean to hurt you.

913
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:51,256
I'm afraid your penance
has come due, Timbo,

914
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:53,509
it's time to account for your crimes.

915
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:55,302
Den...

916
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,597
– I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

917
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:00,933
<i>- No no no, there's
no need to apologize.</i>

918
01:14:01,016 --> 01:14:03,519
<i>Your exile is more
than enough reparation.</i>

919
01:14:03,644 --> 01:14:07,940
Oh, I do have my fingers crossed
for a scenario involving you,

920
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:10,177
nurse Noakes and a broom handle.

921
01:14:10,296 --> 01:14:12,381
Cherry up, Timmy. Bye bye now.

922
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:15,739
He sends his love.

923
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:29,086
I would like to ask about
the night of your arrest.

924
01:14:30,504 --> 01:14:34,592
I remember... listening
to his heart beat.

925
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:39,179
Your heart beats much slower than ours.

926
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:43,350
There is a gentleness to the sound.

927
01:14:43,475 --> 01:14:46,645
I find it... comforting.

928
01:14:49,398 --> 01:14:52,651
– Vivian, what time is it?
– I don't know. Who cares...

929
01:14:52,776 --> 01:14:55,863
I've heard a melody, boy. For violin.

930
01:14:55,988 --> 01:14:57,281
Quick...

931
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:59,241
Find-find a pen.

932
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:04,830
I heard it in a dream. It
was in a nightmarish café...

933
01:15:04,955 --> 01:15:09,627
Blurry, bright lights, but
underground and no way out.

934
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:15,716
And the waitresses...
they all had the same face.

935
01:15:15,841 --> 01:15:20,846
There was music played, not like
any music I've ever heard in my life.

936
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:29,021
It began... It began...

937
01:15:29,146 --> 01:15:30,397
Wait...

938
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:35,653
It was so clear a minute ago.

939
01:15:37,154 --> 01:15:40,491
Help me, Robert, help
me. It's slipping away!

940
01:15:42,826 --> 01:15:44,078
I've lost it.

941
01:15:45,871 --> 01:15:47,122
It'll come to you, sir.

942
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:50,543
The minute you stop trying
to find it, it will find you.

943
01:15:50,668 --> 01:15:52,586
You are naive, Robert.

944
01:15:55,756 --> 01:15:57,591
I am anything but.

945
01:15:57,716 --> 01:16:00,553
There is a gulf between these chairs.

946
01:16:01,387 --> 01:16:03,764
What you want is no
different from what I want.

947
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:07,184
The gulf is an illusion.

948
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:11,480
<i>How do I describe
that night, Sixsmith...</i>

949
01:16:11,605 --> 01:16:16,026
<i>What had happened between Vivian
and I transcended language.</i>

950
01:16:17,236 --> 01:16:21,323
<i>It was music that poured from his
eyes, and breathed from his lips.</i>

951
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:27,121
<i>Music as beautiful as
any I have ever heard.</i>

952
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:35,129
What-what are you doing in here?

953
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:40,843
They found us.

954
01:17:08,162 --> 01:17:11,790
I'll be with you the
whole way, now focus on me.

955
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,757
Stay with me.

956
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:22,885
Right here. I won't let you go.

957
01:17:41,362 --> 01:17:42,947
– Mr. Ewing. – It-It's alright.

958
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:45,824
I
- I talked to the captain, he'll hear your case.

959
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,618
What's your name, boy?

960
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,579
Autua, sir.

961
01:17:50,704 --> 01:17:53,916
The Christian, gentlemen,
who knows nothing about ships,

962
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:57,336
tells me that you're
a first-class sailor.

963
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:02,132
Very well, let's see you'd
lower the main top, son.

964
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:10,224
Mr. Roderick, my bottle is empty.

965
01:18:20,693 --> 01:18:23,320
Mr. Boerhaave, ready my piece.

966
01:18:23,737 --> 01:18:28,158
What? Sir, you... gave
me your word, Captain.

967
01:18:28,284 --> 01:18:30,411
P
- Please, you can't do this.

968
01:18:30,536 --> 01:18:34,373
Nobody tells me what I can
and cannot do on my own ship.

969
01:18:34,498 --> 01:18:37,084
Specially when it
concerns nigger stow-away.

970
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:06,696
Captain look! He's got
fish-hooks for toes.

971
01:19:06,697 --> 01:19:09,658
Boerhaave, you don't
make a mess of my deck.

972
01:19:44,777 --> 01:19:46,695
Captain, please...

973
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:52,117
Look, if you can just hear me, I'm...

974
01:20:10,386 --> 01:20:13,222
The darkie's salt as I am.

975
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:17,309
Mr. Boerhaave!

976
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:20,853
It appears we have an
addition to our crew.

977
01:20:20,854 --> 01:20:22,481
Make sure he earns his keep.

978
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:26,193
Mr. Hooks.

979
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:32,116
I found her. She was in the chem
labs, looking for the bathroom.

980
01:20:32,992 --> 01:20:37,997
Ah? Well, perfect, then, uh, why
don't you take over from here, Sachs,

981
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,666
you know, introduce our
little tribe, and uh...

982
01:20:40,749 --> 01:20:43,711
and guide Ms. Rey through
the... through the tower.

983
01:20:44,253 --> 01:20:47,423
The funny thing is, I am
not even supposed to be here.

984
01:20:47,548 --> 01:20:51,134
I was meant to be in Seoul, but
the air traffic controller strike

985
01:20:51,135 --> 01:20:54,721
put everything up, so now I'm
on the... time jumper tonight.

986
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:58,017
Did you ever think that the
universe was against you?

987
01:20:58,142 --> 01:20:59,602
All the time.

988
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:02,104
You mind?

989
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:04,231
I'm cool.

990
01:21:17,244 --> 01:21:19,663
You seem nervous, Isaac.

991
01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:21,665
– Do I make you nervous? – No.

992
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,044
Actually, just the opposite.

993
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:46,482
Will you gonna tell me
why you covered for me?

994
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:57,284
<i>Freedom. The fatuous
jingle of our civilization.</i>

995
01:21:57,952 --> 01:22:02,581
<i>But only those deprived of it have the
barest inkling of what it really is.</i>

996
01:22:20,599 --> 01:22:24,979
There's much disagreement on
what should be done with you.

997
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,607
The Corprocrats want you
euthanased as a deviant,

998
01:22:28,732 --> 01:22:31,527
the Manufacturer is
demanding a period of study,

999
01:22:31,569 --> 01:22:35,781
the Pyschogenomicists are screaming
for an immediate cerebral vivisection.

1000
01:22:37,157 --> 01:22:42,788
However, the problem you
create is a political one.

1001
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:48,669
Which means you are my problem.

1002
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:54,466
I find it intriguing to
imagine that beneath this...

1003
01:22:54,550 --> 01:23:00,598
perfectly engineered features, are thoughts
that terrify the whole of Unanimity.

1004
01:23:05,269 --> 01:23:09,231
I'm not afraid of such thoughts,
because I do not fear the truth.

1005
01:23:10,816 --> 01:23:15,029
There's a natural order
to this world, fabricant.

1006
01:23:15,154 --> 01:23:19,700
And the truth is this
order must be protected.

1007
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:35,507
Inform the Archivist,
prepare for excisement.

1008
01:23:35,633 --> 01:23:37,593
– Yes sir. – Sir...

1009
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:43,891
Can you tell me what
happened to Hae-Ju Zheng?

1010
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:47,269
Killed, I was told.

1011
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:12,487
All this feast and excitements,
really Adam, it's...

1012
01:24:12,502 --> 01:24:15,172
all too much, you'll need to rest.

1013
01:24:29,103 --> 01:24:30,938
I had...

1014
01:24:31,522 --> 01:24:37,278
a girlfriend once, she kept trying
to get me to read Carlos Castenada.

1015
01:24:37,403 --> 01:24:40,155
– You ever read any of
that stuff? – Oh yeah.

1016
01:24:42,575 --> 01:24:45,202
But the relationship was doomed.

1017
01:24:45,327 --> 01:24:47,371
Every time she brought up a new...

1018
01:24:47,413 --> 01:24:51,166
karma, that sort of stuff, I
- I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

1019
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:54,420
And yet...

1020
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:58,632
I can't explain...

1021
01:24:58,757 --> 01:25:02,094
that I knew when I opened that door...

1022
01:25:14,857 --> 01:25:18,068
They destroyed most of
the copies of the report.

1023
01:25:20,237 --> 01:25:21,864
Most?

1024
01:25:24,992 --> 01:25:27,703
There's no good choice here, is there?

1025
01:25:27,828 --> 01:25:30,956
If I help you, I close my job...

1026
01:25:31,081 --> 01:25:32,333
or worse,

1027
01:25:34,376 --> 01:25:38,172
If I don't, a lot of people...

1028
01:25:40,216 --> 01:25:42,426
And it will be worse than worse.

1029
01:25:44,762 --> 01:25:47,264
You have to do...

1030
01:25:47,389 --> 01:25:49,892
whatever you can't not do.

1031
01:25:56,482 --> 01:25:58,817
Someone preyin' on you, Zachry?

1032
01:25:59,902 --> 01:26:02,821
You really ain't feary about
meetin' Ol' Georgie on the summit?

1033
01:26:02,947 --> 01:26:06,075
I'm more scaresome 'bout the
weather than in the Devil.

1034
01:26:09,745 --> 01:26:11,455
You cog he's real?

1035
01:26:12,164 --> 01:26:14,917
Who tripped the Fall,
if not Old Georgie?

1036
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:18,504
True-true?

1037
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:24,260
The Old Uns.

1038
01:26:25,135 --> 01:26:27,221
That's just a rope o'smoke.

1039
01:26:27,263 --> 01:26:29,848
Old Uns got the Smart.

1040
01:26:30,599 --> 01:26:33,143
They mastered sick and seeds,

1041
01:26:33,269 --> 01:26:35,604
they make miracles
and fly across the sky.

1042
01:26:35,646 --> 01:26:39,149
True. All true. But
they got somethin' else.

1043
01:26:39,275 --> 01:26:43,612
A hunger in their hearts, a hunger
that's stronger than all their Smart.

1044
01:26:44,989 --> 01:26:47,032
Hunger? For what?

1045
01:26:48,826 --> 01:26:50,286
A hunger for more.

1046
01:26:52,162 --> 01:26:55,583
<i>Belief like fear or love</i>

1047
01:26:55,624 --> 01:27:00,462
<i>is forced to be understood as we
understand the theory of relativity,</i>

1048
01:27:00,546 --> 01:27:02,882
and principles of uncertainty.

1049
01:27:03,716 --> 01:27:07,428
<i>Phenomena that determine
the course of our lives.</i>

1050
01:27:08,929 --> 01:27:13,225
<i>Yesterday, my life was
headed in one direction.</i>

1051
01:27:16,437 --> 01:27:20,316
<i>Today, it is headed in another.</i>

1052
01:27:20,774 --> 01:27:26,572
<i>Yesterday, I believe I would
never have done what I did today.</i>

1053
01:27:26,697 --> 01:27:30,618
<i>These forces that often
remake time and space,</i>

1054
01:27:30,743 --> 01:27:34,246
<i>they can shape and alter who
we imagine ourselves to be,</i>

1055
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:39,251
<i>begin long before we are born,
and continue after we perish.</i>

1056
01:27:44,298 --> 01:27:47,426
<i>Our lives and our choices</i>

1057
01:27:47,551 --> 01:27:52,932
<i>like quantum trajectories are
understood moment to moment</i>

1058
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:58,187
<i>at each point of
intersection, each encounter,</i>

1059
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:02,524
<i>suggest a new potential direction.</i>

1060
01:28:04,944 --> 01:28:07,071
<i>Proposition:</i>

1061
01:28:07,196 --> 01:28:10,449
<i>I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.</i>

1062
01:28:11,617 --> 01:28:17,540
<i>Is this possible? I
just met her, and yet...</i>

1063
01:28:17,623 --> 01:28:23,629
<i>I feel like something
important has happened to me.</i>

1064
01:28:33,973 --> 01:28:35,432
That's it.

1065
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,977
The music from my dream.

1066
01:29:19,977 --> 01:29:24,607
This is from my dream, that
night I came to your room.

1067
01:29:24,732 --> 01:29:29,403
This is the music I heard in my
head, somehow I gave it to you.

1068
01:29:29,528 --> 01:29:32,197
I've been working on
this piece for weeks now.

1069
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:36,493
I suspect you heard it, and
incorporated it into your dream.

1070
01:29:37,578 --> 01:29:40,122
I call it the Cloud Atlas Sextet.

1071
01:29:44,168 --> 01:29:47,796
This is obviously the
result of our collaboration.

1072
01:29:48,923 --> 01:29:51,759
The Atlas, I believe,

1073
01:29:51,926 --> 01:29:55,012
is the only thing I've done
in my life that is of value.

1074
01:29:56,847 --> 01:29:59,308
But I know I could not have written it,

1075
01:30:00,643 --> 01:30:03,020
if I hadn't met you.

1076
01:30:03,145 --> 01:30:06,815
There are whole movements in the
Atlas that I've read imagining us,

1077
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:11,403
meeting again and again, in
different lives and different ages.

1078
01:30:11,445 --> 01:30:12,571
Yes...

1079
01:30:13,656 --> 01:30:20,579
Something as important as this cannot
be described as "yours" or "mine",

1080
01:30:20,955 --> 01:30:22,915
it is "ours".

1081
01:30:29,588 --> 01:30:31,799
That this is exactly how I feel, Vivian.

1082
01:30:52,444 --> 01:30:53,946
I'm sorry, I...

1083
01:30:54,989 --> 01:30:58,701
– I thought... – You
thought? You thought what?

1084
01:30:58,826 --> 01:31:04,790
That I might fancy a little buggering
from a fine young dandy like yourself?

1085
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:09,837
I pack my bag, and be gone by morning.

1086
01:31:09,879 --> 01:31:12,798
You'll do no such thing, you'll
leave only when I say you can leave.

1087
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:17,386
You will continue working
on Vivian Ayre's Cloud Atlas.

1088
01:31:17,511 --> 01:31:20,472
When it is finished, then I
will decide what you do with you.

1089
01:31:20,514 --> 01:31:22,933
You can't keep me here! I'm leaving!

1090
01:31:23,058 --> 01:31:26,644
Good luck with your composing. I'm
sure a sterile old fuck like yourself

1091
01:31:26,645 --> 01:31:29,523
is still capable of something
completely unmemorable.

1092
01:31:29,648 --> 01:31:34,320
I suggest you think about this,
Robert. Think about reputation.

1093
01:31:35,529 --> 01:31:40,868
Reputation is everything in our society.
Yours, my disinherited reprobate,

1094
01:31:40,993 --> 01:31:42,828
has expired.

1095
01:31:42,953 --> 01:31:47,041
Did you not think that we would inquire
about someone living under our roof?

1096
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:50,211
Mackerras himself wrote, and I quote:

1097
01:31:50,252 --> 01:31:54,924
"He is a prostitute whose liaisons
with perverts and sodomites

1098
01:31:55,132 --> 01:31:59,887
were common place in his brief
and forgettable career at Caius.

1099
01:32:00,012 --> 01:32:04,308
Lock up the silverware. " End of quote.

1100
01:32:06,644 --> 01:32:10,022
Be warned. Leave here
without my consent,

1101
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:15,945
and all the musical society will know
of the degenerate Robert Frobisher.

1102
01:32:17,154 --> 01:32:19,114
After that,

1103
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:23,911
even if you compose one of the
greatest symphonies ever written,

1104
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:26,247
no one will hear it,

1105
01:32:26,747 --> 01:32:30,459
because no one will want
anything to do with you.

1106
01:33:10,207 --> 01:33:12,167
I won't let you go again.

1107
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:20,676
I told you he'd come.

1108
01:33:21,218 --> 01:33:22,970
<i>Two things became clear.</i>

1109
01:33:23,095 --> 01:33:27,057
<i>Hanging myself from Edinburgh's flagpole
is preferable to letting that parasite</i>

1110
01:33:27,099 --> 01:33:28,893
<i>plunder my talent a day longer.</i>

1111
01:33:29,184 --> 01:33:31,437
<i>I must complete my sextet.</i>

1112
01:33:31,478 --> 01:33:34,356
<i>I can't do it here, so tonight
I plan to make my escape.</i>

1113
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:49,622
<i>Please stand by for vehicle scan.</i>

1114
01:33:51,749 --> 01:33:54,001
<i>Clearance granted.</i>

1115
01:34:12,978 --> 01:34:15,898
Any jailbreak's a risky proposition.

1116
01:34:16,023 --> 01:34:20,611
One little cock-up, and we are
dangling at her majesty's pleasure.

1117
01:34:20,736 --> 01:34:22,821
I know, I know.

1118
01:34:22,905 --> 01:34:24,907
We could use code names,

1119
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:28,160
but the truth is I'd probably
be the first to forget mine.

1120
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:31,372
So, Mr. Cavendish...

1121
01:34:31,956 --> 01:34:33,832
Ernie Blancksmith.

1122
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:39,004
This is Mr. Meeks and my
girl Veronica Costello.

1123
01:34:39,838 --> 01:34:42,716
– To trust. – To trust.

1124
01:34:43,717 --> 01:34:46,804
I know, I know.

1125
01:34:47,972 --> 01:34:50,391
What about the parrot, then?

1126
01:34:50,516 --> 01:34:52,309
Forever those are likely songbird.

1127
01:34:52,434 --> 01:34:57,106
Mr. Meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman, he would never betray us.

1128
01:34:57,231 --> 01:35:00,442
Besides, no one's ever
heard him say anything else.

1129
01:35:00,568 --> 01:35:02,653
I know, I know.

1130
01:35:02,778 --> 01:35:05,322
Question is, old man,

1131
01:35:05,406 --> 01:35:07,449
think you're up to snuff?

1132
01:35:22,548 --> 01:35:24,425
<i>Unanimity requires compliance.</i>

1133
01:35:24,426 --> 01:35:27,720
<i>We have a security code
Red, prepare to be boarded.</i>

1134
01:35:27,845 --> 01:35:29,805
What are you going to do?

1135
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,057
Stay calm, stay calm.

1136
01:35:33,142 --> 01:35:36,812
<i>" It will end in tears.
" You've warned me.</i>

1137
01:35:36,937 --> 01:35:39,106
<i>I suppose I'm as hopeless as Adam Ewing,</i>

1138
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:42,358
<i>oblivious towards the unspeakable
forms lying and waiting,</i>

1139
01:35:42,359 --> 01:35:44,778
<i>blind to the fact his
friend is poisoning him.</i>

1140
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:46,488
Wait, please...

1141
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:49,116
The idea of losing this ring
distresses me beyond measure.

1142
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:50,534
Don't be a silly puff here, Adam,

1143
01:35:50,576 --> 01:35:54,288
I'm sure your wife will set
your health above a golden loop.

1144
01:35:54,622 --> 01:35:59,168
I have seen the onset for dropsy
and it is not a pretty sight!

1145
01:36:00,961 --> 01:36:04,297
I know an excellent Spanish goldsmith,
who works with such alacrity,

1146
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:07,426
that your Tilda may not have
to know this was ever removed.

1147
01:36:08,969 --> 01:36:12,723
– Give it to me! – Get your
fucking hands off my pudding!

1148
01:36:12,765 --> 01:36:15,684
It's not your pudding,
you Alzheimer riddled lout!

1149
01:36:15,809 --> 01:36:17,269
You've already eaten...

1150
01:36:24,443 --> 01:36:26,320
Better get in here.

1151
01:36:46,715 --> 01:36:48,467
Mr. Cavendish!

1152
01:36:57,601 --> 01:37:00,854
<i>The room stank of bitter medicine.</i>

1153
01:37:07,111 --> 01:37:10,029
<i>Curiously heavy things, guns.</i>

1154
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,825
Why did I take it, exactly?

1155
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:15,077
<i>Can't say.</i>

1156
01:37:15,202 --> 01:37:16,620
<i>An intuition.</i>

1157
01:37:16,745 --> 01:37:18,914
<i>A sense of significance.</i>

1158
01:37:19,707 --> 01:37:21,750
<i>That from this point on...</i>

1159
01:37:23,252 --> 01:37:25,045
<i>there was no going back.</i>

1160
01:37:43,105 --> 01:37:46,734
Just seein' them clouds,
we run out o' time.

1161
01:37:51,447 --> 01:37:56,327
– Don't need no smart
rope. – Yeah, see you fall,

1162
01:37:57,077 --> 01:37:58,954
I'll catch you.

1163
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,431
Hands in the air. Now! Move
it, step off of the vehicle!

1164
01:38:17,473 --> 01:38:20,893
Get down. Down, now!

1165
01:38:24,563 --> 01:38:26,774
Fuckin' migrant monkey-talk.

1166
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:29,902
Why do they hire these greasy stubs?

1167
01:38:30,986 --> 01:38:32,780
Negative, sir. Definite illegal.

1168
01:38:32,905 --> 01:38:34,198
You turn him from now.

1169
01:38:34,865 --> 01:38:36,200
I'm reading a second life form!

1170
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:37,868
– Where? – In the truck.

1171
01:38:37,993 --> 01:38:40,204
– Check it out. – Yes, sir.

1172
01:39:11,902 --> 01:39:16,282
You troddin' on the Devil's ground now,

1173
01:39:16,407 --> 01:39:17,783
Valleysman.

1174
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:26,500
I'm sayin' just once. That
off-lander ain't gettin' to the top.

1175
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:31,672
Time for you to let go that rope.

1176
01:39:31,797 --> 01:39:33,465
You trespass...

1177
01:39:34,091 --> 01:39:35,759
You pay the price.

1178
01:39:37,511 --> 01:39:40,097
Now drop that rope.

1179
01:39:40,222 --> 01:39:43,684
Drop that rope.

1180
01:39:45,436 --> 01:39:48,272
– Forcecom 1, entering
the truck. – Roger that.

1181
01:39:48,522 --> 01:39:50,399
I turn in visual.

1182
01:39:51,984 --> 01:39:54,236
– It's her! – It'll be okay, uh?

1183
01:40:11,295 --> 01:40:13,464
Fire at me. Fire at me!

1184
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:31,774
Who are you?

1185
01:40:32,316 --> 01:40:33,817
Commander Hae-Ju Zheng.

1186
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:38,072
First science officer
of the Union rebellion.

1187
01:40:38,197 --> 01:40:40,741
Why are you doing this?

1188
01:40:41,325 --> 01:40:44,620
Because I believe you have
the power to change this world.

1189
01:40:45,037 --> 01:40:49,959
<i>Drop that rope... Let go that rope.</i>

1190
01:40:50,084 --> 01:40:52,878
<i>"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"</i>

1191
01:40:53,629 --> 01:40:57,007
Hands are bleedin'. Can't let go.

1192
01:41:10,854 --> 01:41:12,356
Thank you Zachry.

1193
01:41:14,024 --> 01:41:15,859
You savin' me twice, ain't ya?

1194
01:41:17,027 --> 01:41:18,904
You fall, I catch you.

1195
01:42:01,989 --> 01:42:04,283
<i>Excessive force confirmed.</i>

1196
01:42:07,244 --> 01:42:08,662
<i>Stop them. Stop them now.</i>

1197
01:42:23,093 --> 01:42:26,805
What are you doing, boy? I
thought I made myself clear.

1198
01:42:26,931 --> 01:42:31,268
– Do what you want. I'm
leaving! – Fine, Frobisher...

1199
01:42:31,393 --> 01:42:33,938
Go, but I take this.

1200
01:42:34,772 --> 01:42:36,232
– Give that to me. – It's mine!

1201
01:42:36,315 --> 01:42:37,316
I'm warning you!

1202
01:42:37,441 --> 01:42:39,610
Under the conditions
of this relationship,

1203
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:42,238
I'm certain that I'm in my legal rights.

1204
01:42:43,197 --> 01:42:47,201
Give it to me. Give it to me, or I swear
to God I will kill you as you stand!

1205
01:42:48,953 --> 01:42:52,122
Please... you're a coward.

1206
01:42:52,164 --> 01:42:55,251
– I'll do it. – You
won't pull that trigger.

1207
01:42:57,378 --> 01:42:59,797
Your kind never does.

1208
01:43:19,733 --> 01:43:24,154
PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ADAM EWING

1209
01:43:41,297 --> 01:43:44,008
Yes. Yes, well...

1210
01:43:44,049 --> 01:43:47,553
How-how fares our worm today, Adam?

1211
01:43:48,679 --> 01:43:51,265
I
- I'm afraid it has taken the best of me.

1212
01:43:51,348 --> 01:43:53,976
Oh no no no. Nonsense. Nonsense.

1213
01:43:54,059 --> 01:43:57,813
You mustn't give up. You must
think of your beautiful wife.

1214
01:43:58,063 --> 01:44:00,733
You must think of Tilda.

1215
01:44:21,545 --> 01:44:23,547
They're trapped in the
downway. We've got them.

1216
01:44:35,684 --> 01:44:37,269
What are you doing?

1217
01:45:36,245 --> 01:45:39,081
<i>Nay, the dead never stay dead.</i>

1218
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:47,756
<i>Open your ears, and they'll
never stop a yibberin'.</i>

1219
01:46:02,354 --> 01:46:04,356
What is this place?

1220
01:46:05,274 --> 01:46:07,818
Before the Fall,

1221
01:46:07,943 --> 01:46:11,071
Old Uns built dwellings,

1222
01:46:11,113 --> 01:46:14,742
beyond the sky, among the stars,

1223
01:46:16,076 --> 01:46:20,289
this place joined here with them.

1224
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:38,933
It is she.

1225
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,770
The Old Uns pray to
Sonmi same as Valleysmen?

1226
01:46:43,938 --> 01:46:48,025
Nay... not 'zactly same.

1227
01:47:12,216 --> 01:47:15,553
Stay close. Fabricants
get snatched here.

1228
01:47:17,763 --> 01:47:19,890
– All clear. – Thank you.

1229
01:47:19,932 --> 01:47:23,394
No sweat, we're partners. But you
got to tell me what's happening.

1230
01:47:23,519 --> 01:47:25,646
Okay, let me take off these
clothes, call the cops,

1231
01:47:25,647 --> 01:47:28,273
and I promise I tell you everything
that happen in the morning.

1232
01:47:28,274 --> 01:47:30,776
Okay. But I hope you
realize you just said exactly

1233
01:47:30,818 --> 01:47:32,987
what every character in
any decent mystery says

1234
01:47:33,153 --> 01:47:34,822
right before they get killed.

1235
01:47:34,947 --> 01:47:36,574
Good night, Javier.

1236
01:48:19,783 --> 01:48:22,076
What'd you mean down there? 'bout...

1237
01:48:22,077 --> 01:48:27,416
The Old Uns and Valleymen prayin'
to Sonmi not 'zactly the same?

1238
01:48:29,335 --> 01:48:32,379
Old men... they were different.

1239
01:48:34,215 --> 01:48:35,966
Different?

1240
01:48:36,091 --> 01:48:37,509
How?

1241
01:48:40,346 --> 01:48:42,473
You want the True-true?

1242
01:48:55,027 --> 01:48:57,154
This is where you live?

1243
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:00,241
This... is where Union was born.

1244
01:49:08,499 --> 01:49:10,668
Sonmi was no God.

1245
01:49:10,834 --> 01:49:16,423
She died hundreds of years ago on
a faraway peninsula, deadlanded now.

1246
01:49:17,049 --> 01:49:18,050
What?

1247
01:49:18,884 --> 01:49:20,302
I cog Valleysmens beliefs,

1248
01:49:20,344 --> 01:49:22,805
I know Abbess teach
you Sonmi was a miracle,

1249
01:49:22,888 --> 01:49:27,268
birthed o' Darwin god o'
Smart, but ain't the True-true.

1250
01:49:27,977 --> 01:49:33,107
Her life was sad n' judased, she died
tryin' to change the Old-Uns thinkin'.

1251
01:49:33,232 --> 01:49:38,779
<i>Liiiies... nothing but lying.</i>

1252
01:49:38,862 --> 01:49:41,282
Nay, nay you-you're lying.

1253
01:49:52,835 --> 01:49:55,832
The nature of our
immortal lives is in the...

1254
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,464
Sonmi?

1255
01:49:58,215 --> 01:50:01,385
Before she died, she spoke
of her acts n' deedins'.

1256
01:50:01,594 --> 01:50:05,222
Her words are heart savin' blessin',
remindin' me what's the True-true.

1257
01:50:05,347 --> 01:50:09,143
How long you lissin' to this?!
How long you jus' stand there,

1258
01:50:09,226 --> 01:50:14,940
n' let a stranger keep fuggin'
your beliefs up n' down, in n' out!

1259
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:18,360
<i>Our lives do not belong to us,</i>

1260
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:22,531
<i>from womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.</i>

1261
01:50:24,143 --> 01:50:25,263
Zachry.

1262
01:50:26,577 --> 01:50:27,995
You alright?

1263
01:50:29,246 --> 01:50:30,581
Finish your saysoe...

1264
01:50:38,881 --> 01:50:41,258
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

1265
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:45,679
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to talk.

1266
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:48,390
Be cool. Alright.

1267
01:50:51,769 --> 01:50:54,647
And if I wanted to kill
you, you'd be dead already.

1268
01:50:54,772 --> 01:50:58,776
How's it feel, uh? Good
conversation start, isn't it?

1269
01:51:01,403 --> 01:51:04,573
You are Lester Rey's daughter,
that's for goddamn sure.

1270
01:51:05,115 --> 01:51:08,327
– You knew my father? – Korean War.

1271
01:51:09,036 --> 01:51:10,955
I was in the two-one.

1272
01:51:12,498 --> 01:51:15,417
That's me on the end, next to your dad.

1273
01:51:15,793 --> 01:51:18,587
Mortar landed so close it could
have dropped out of my ass.

1274
01:51:18,712 --> 01:51:22,675
If your father hadn't done
what he did, I wouldn't be here.

1275
01:51:27,846 --> 01:51:29,765
Guess that makes two of us.

1276
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:47,241
You ain't let go that rope cause you'
a lustin' for that darkly, sweet'meat.

1277
01:51:47,366 --> 01:51:49,285
I cog it all, now.

1278
01:51:49,326 --> 01:51:55,416
This whore, with her cokeynut
skin, and her slywise mask,

1279
01:51:55,624 --> 01:51:59,503
smilin' n' wormin' her way into
your trust so you brin' her here,

1280
01:51:59,628 --> 01:52:03,549
scavin' n' sivvin' for what?

1281
01:52:03,632 --> 01:52:06,093
For what, fool?

1282
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:11,307
They want the island. The
Prescients want it all.

1283
01:52:11,348 --> 01:52:16,979
You judasin' your kin
for a piece of ass.

1284
01:52:17,271 --> 01:52:19,732
She ain't your tribe,
she ain't even your color,

1285
01:52:19,773 --> 01:52:22,693
she just 'bout ignorin'
all your yarns n' ways,

1286
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:27,823
spinnin' n' spoutin' her whoahsomse
lies, and you lap it up, you dammit!

1287
01:52:28,032 --> 01:52:31,076
– That ain't truth. – Ain't
it? Then do sumthin', stop her!

1288
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:35,706
Take your spiker an' slit her throat!

1289
01:52:35,998 --> 01:52:39,542
Protect your tribe, protect
your sister, little Caktin,

1290
01:52:39,543 --> 01:52:42,463
kill her now, before it's too late!

1291
01:52:47,051 --> 01:52:48,469
They will kill you.

1292
01:52:49,178 --> 01:52:51,847
– You don't know these
people like I do. – Yeah?

1293
01:52:52,264 --> 01:52:54,892
Well if that's all you came to tell me,

1294
01:52:54,975 --> 01:52:56,602
you're a little bit late.

1295
01:52:56,685 --> 01:53:00,022
Somebody just forced me
off the Swannekke bridge.

1296
01:53:03,776 --> 01:53:06,153
This is out of control.

1297
01:53:07,029 --> 01:53:08,364
Do you know who did it?

1298
01:53:08,489 --> 01:53:11,242
The contractor calls himself Bill Smoke.

1299
01:53:11,367 --> 01:53:13,702
– And... – What?

1300
01:53:15,454 --> 01:53:16,956
He got Sachs.

1301
01:53:17,581 --> 01:53:18,582
Isaac?

1302
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:20,167
A bomb on his plane.

1303
01:53:22,127 --> 01:53:24,255
The press is blaming the PLO.

1304
01:53:25,965 --> 01:53:31,011
He was a treat. Like
Sixsmith, like... you.

1305
01:53:39,186 --> 01:53:40,688
Bring them thru.

1306
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:55,411
Sonmi 451, I'm most honored to meet you.

1307
01:53:55,703 --> 01:53:59,540
I am General An-Cor
Apis, leader of Union.

1308
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:02,751
Who is paying them?

1309
01:54:03,210 --> 01:54:05,045
The same guy that pays me.

1310
01:54:05,754 --> 01:54:07,423
Lloyd Hooks?

1311
01:54:07,673 --> 01:54:09,884
Hughes & Pikes Consulting.

1312
01:54:10,718 --> 01:54:12,636
I've heard of them.

1313
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:16,181
They're, uh... lobbiers
for oil companies.

1314
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:25,524
Why would big oil... hire Lloyd
Hooks to run a nuclear reactor?

1315
01:54:28,152 --> 01:54:33,157
You get that same look your father
used to get. You see I told you.

1316
01:54:33,782 --> 01:54:35,951
Hooks doesn't want
the report discovered,

1317
01:54:35,993 --> 01:54:38,287
because he doesn't
want the reactor fixed.

1318
01:54:38,537 --> 01:54:40,414
He wants it to fail.

1319
01:54:40,456 --> 01:54:43,167
This is about the future
of energy in this country.

1320
01:54:43,918 --> 01:54:47,838
They want the explosion.
The chaos and carnage.

1321
01:54:47,963 --> 01:54:50,633
The more deaths, the better.

1322
01:55:02,394 --> 01:55:05,606
Can't cog o' thing, words
n'worrins' like a wasp's nest,

1323
01:55:05,648 --> 01:55:07,233
proke'd n'prod'd by you.

1324
01:55:07,274 --> 01:55:11,237
You come elbowin' in' our life,
yibberin' about the True-true,

1325
01:55:11,278 --> 01:55:13,280
and never tellin' the whole true.

1326
01:55:13,614 --> 01:55:15,491
I need to cog what you doin'!

1327
01:55:15,866 --> 01:55:19,370
I told you. I come to
send a plea o' help.

1328
01:55:19,495 --> 01:55:21,371
Help, why?

1329
01:55:21,372 --> 01:55:23,916
To steal our land? To
kill n' slave us all?!

1330
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:25,376
What d'you want?!

1331
01:55:35,469 --> 01:55:39,139
Prescients' dyin',
Zach. Just like Catkin.

1332
01:55:39,598 --> 01:55:42,601
This world poison me n' all my kin'.

1333
01:55:43,143 --> 01:55:46,480
We get no help, ain't no
home if I don' find a way.

1334
01:55:46,605 --> 01:55:50,150
I say the truesome. We not survive.

1335
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:53,279
We not survive...

1336
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:59,034
<i>Ayrs has the dogs after me.</i>

1337
01:56:00,077 --> 01:56:03,080
<i>The bullet passed through, killing
little more than his appetite,</i>

1338
01:56:03,163 --> 01:56:06,959
<i>and he's out for blood.
I'll have to pay the piper.</i>

1339
01:56:08,043 --> 01:56:10,880
– I should call the
cops. – It won't help.

1340
01:56:11,839 --> 01:56:14,258
How do I know you're not lying to me?

1341
01:56:14,383 --> 01:56:17,970
Smoke will be coming for me, as
soon as he figures out I'm with you.

1342
01:56:18,095 --> 01:56:20,389
We need that report.

1343
01:56:20,514 --> 01:56:22,766
I can't protect you for long without it.

1344
01:56:24,351 --> 01:56:27,438
– General Apis... – You, my dear...

1345
01:56:27,479 --> 01:56:30,816
are proof... our
efforts were not in vain.

1346
01:56:30,858 --> 01:56:33,819
But... I'm just a dinery server.

1347
01:56:33,944 --> 01:56:37,114
I was not genomed to alter reality.

1348
01:56:37,197 --> 01:56:39,575
No revolutionary ever was.

1349
01:56:44,288 --> 01:56:46,332
I'm sorry.

1350
01:56:46,457 --> 01:56:49,126
I cannot do what you're asking.

1351
01:56:52,463 --> 01:56:55,883
It would be a difficult
choice for anyone.

1352
01:56:57,843 --> 01:57:01,680
But, before you call
your decision final,

1353
01:57:01,722 --> 01:57:04,725
there is one last thing
I would like you to see,

1354
01:57:04,934 --> 01:57:08,771
in order to fully understand
what we are fighting for.

1355
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,752
Cross your fingers n' toes.

1356
01:58:20,634 --> 01:58:22,720
If your pray' be answered,

1357
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:26,640
nay Prescients never
return to the Valley again?

1358
01:58:30,519 --> 01:58:34,857
Those wishin' to come
with us, they're welcome.

1359
01:58:37,401 --> 01:58:39,194
The Valley is my home.

1360
01:59:26,867 --> 01:59:28,619
Are you alright?

1361
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:32,831
I know... it is forbidden.

1362
02:00:03,988 --> 02:00:08,951
<i>Sixsmith. I climb the steps of
the Scot monument every morning.</i>

1363
02:00:09,034 --> 02:00:10,828
<i>And all becomes clear.</i>

1364
02:00:11,704 --> 02:00:14,248
<i>Wish I could make you
see this brigthness.</i>

1365
02:00:15,332 --> 02:00:18,544
<i>Don't worry, all is well.</i>

1366
02:00:18,669 --> 02:00:22,089
<i>All is so perfectly, damnably well.</i>

1367
02:00:23,883 --> 02:00:30,764
<i>I understand now, that boundaries
between noise and sound are conventions.</i>

1368
02:00:33,851 --> 02:00:39,273
<i>All boundaries are conventions,
waiting to be transcended.</i>

1369
02:00:41,775 --> 02:00:43,944
<i>One may trandcend any convention,</i>

1370
02:00:44,153 --> 02:00:47,239
<i>if only one can first
conceive of doing so.</i>

1371
02:00:53,245 --> 02:00:58,626
<i>Moments like this, I can feel your heart
beating as clearly as I feel my own,</i>

1372
02:00:59,752 --> 02:01:02,838
<i>and I know that
separation is an illusion.</i>

1373
02:01:09,511 --> 02:01:13,599
<i>My life extends far beyond
the limitations of me.</i>

1374
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:35,287
Storm is coming, Mr. Ewing.
Gonna get you down below.

1375
02:01:37,498 --> 02:01:41,877
I'm not running a fuckin'
charity, out with you! Off you go!

1376
02:01:42,878 --> 02:01:47,091
Aah, Mr. Ewing!
A-a-a word if you may.

1377
02:01:47,925 --> 02:01:53,097
Dangerous times we have here.
About that scandal. They say that

1378
02:01:53,222 --> 02:01:57,309
ruffian Robert Frobisher is a composer.

1379
02:01:58,227 --> 02:02:02,606
You're a composer too,
aren't you Mr. Ewing?

1380
02:02:02,731 --> 02:02:06,527
– What d'you want? – The
constable asked to search my rooms.

1381
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:08,737
I know how hard... you're working,

1382
02:02:08,779 --> 02:02:12,032
so I told him there's no
one on the third floor.

1383
02:02:12,533 --> 02:02:17,538
It costs quite a bit of money
to keep an entire floor empty.

1384
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:29,300
– That's all I have. – Hmm...

1385
02:02:34,263 --> 02:02:37,558
What a beautiful... waistcoat.

1386
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:41,520
If these letters are important,

1387
02:02:41,645 --> 02:02:44,064
– why d'you keep reading
them? – I don't know.

1388
02:02:44,815 --> 02:02:48,319
Maybe I'm... just trying
to understand something.

1389
02:02:49,737 --> 02:02:50,696
What?

1390
02:02:51,822 --> 02:02:57,328
Why we keep making the same
mistakes, over and over.

1391
02:02:57,995 --> 02:03:01,165
Maybe you should ask... Megan.

1392
02:03:01,957 --> 02:03:04,418
– What? – Do you know a Megan?

1393
02:03:04,543 --> 02:03:07,421
That's his niece. How do you know that?

1394
02:03:09,632 --> 02:03:11,467
Looks like he mailed something to her.

1395
02:03:11,926 --> 02:03:15,554
Probably used the envelope
he was keeping letters in.

1396
02:03:17,556 --> 02:03:20,351
Come on, Luisa. First
rule of mystery writing:

1397
02:03:20,434 --> 02:03:23,187
a good clue always
leads to another clue.

1398
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:28,692
When the ghostly ordeal of Timothy
Cavendish is turned into a film,

1399
02:03:28,817 --> 02:03:33,948
I'm thinking for the role of the
hero, one patch of Laurence Olivier

1400
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:35,866
with a dash of Michael Caine.

1401
02:03:36,742 --> 02:03:38,118
Who the hell is this?

1402
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:41,079
<i>The Doctor Conway of Aurora
House, I'm covering for Dr. Upward.</i>

1403
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:44,249
– Ooh, is this about mother?
– Yes, it is, Mr. Hotchkiss,

1404
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,834
I
- I'm afraid you must deal yourself,

1405
02:03:45,876 --> 02:03:47,878
I don't think that she's
gonna last the night.

1406
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:50,798
<i>Unfortunately, it is an
unconvenient time for us,</i>

1407
02:03:50,839 --> 02:03:53,008
do we really need to come right now?

1408
02:03:53,425 --> 02:03:57,137
No no, of course not, but she
did ask for you specifically,

1409
02:03:57,429 --> 02:04:00,224
and she seems quite
upset about her last will.

1410
02:04:04,019 --> 02:04:05,187
I'll be right there.

1411
02:04:15,781 --> 02:04:18,951
<i>The plan was a series
of topling dominoes,</i>

1412
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:22,913
<i>that had commenced with Ernie
announcing my death to nurse Noakes.</i>

1413
02:04:23,455 --> 02:04:25,626
– I know, I know. – Shhh!

1414
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:30,838
<i>The entire ambush hinged
upon the silence of Mr. Meeks.</i>

1415
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:33,009
– I know, I know. – Shh!

1416
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:39,847
Mr. Cavendish?

1417
02:04:41,056 --> 02:04:42,516
Everything alright?

1418
02:04:46,103 --> 02:04:48,105
– Don't leave me here. – Shh.

1419
02:05:03,078 --> 02:05:04,830
Mr. Cavendish?

1420
02:05:10,294 --> 02:05:13,380
– And yet, Mr. Cavendish, the
rule... – You temp-temperous witch!

1421
02:05:13,964 --> 02:05:18,302
Mr. Hotchkiss, your mother is my
dearest friend here. Do please hurry.

1422
02:05:22,431 --> 02:05:24,683
And so... adieu!

1423
02:05:24,808 --> 02:05:30,147
Which, translated literally from the
French, means: "To command before...

1424
02:05:30,272 --> 02:05:31,440
God"!

1425
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:41,992
<i>I have Joe Napier on Line 1,
Mr. Hooks. He said it can't wait.</i>

1426
02:05:43,994 --> 02:05:46,539
For God sake, Joe, I am
late already. What's up?

1427
02:05:46,664 --> 02:05:51,001
<i>I got a call from that reporter. Rey...</i>

1428
02:05:51,126 --> 02:05:53,420
She was asking about Sixsmith.

1429
02:05:53,504 --> 02:05:54,421
<i>I see.</i>

1430
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:56,465
You said she wasn't gonna be a problem.

1431
02:05:58,509 --> 02:06:01,929
Well, some problems are more
resilient than others, Joe.

1432
02:06:04,431 --> 02:06:07,685
– Where's the ruddy key? – He
didn't leave it in the ignition!

1433
02:06:07,810 --> 02:06:09,769
His wife was driving, she took it,

1434
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:12,356
the ruddy female took
the key in with her!

1435
02:06:12,481 --> 02:06:15,234
Oh Sweet Saint Ruddy
Jude, what do we do now?

1436
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:17,111
Look under the sunpad.

1437
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:23,075
What is it?

1438
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:24,783
It's not a key, what'd you do with it?

1439
02:06:24,784 --> 02:06:26,912
– What else could it be?
– Well, how does it work?

1440
02:06:29,665 --> 02:06:31,166
– Shite! – Oh no!

1441
02:06:31,458 --> 02:06:33,335
Well, think of something,
you're the genius,

1442
02:06:33,336 --> 02:06:35,546
you're the bloody ruddy genius!

1443
02:06:37,715 --> 02:06:39,008
We're done for.

1444
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:51,353
Oh right... I can't even
believe I'm going to do this.

1445
02:06:52,354 --> 02:06:55,024
<i>Is this thing working? I mean
is it still on, can you hear me?</i>

1446
02:06:55,149 --> 02:06:56,692
Just keep walking.

1447
02:07:04,033 --> 02:07:05,451
I think he's buying me.

1448
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:08,579
Whatever you do, don't look back.

1449
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:13,876
Get out of my car!

1450
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:24,136
Press that button thru!

1451
02:07:37,107 --> 02:07:40,486
Oh no, it's Mr. Meeks,
he doesn't want to come.

1452
02:07:44,114 --> 02:07:46,283
Ruddy bloody hell!

1453
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:50,496
All for one and one for all?

1454
02:08:05,803 --> 02:08:07,179
The gate!

1455
02:08:08,889 --> 02:08:11,809
Veronica, would you unlock
the door for Mr. Meeks.

1456
02:08:13,561 --> 02:08:17,022
Hello Mr. Meeks, we're
off for a lifetime trife.

1457
02:08:17,147 --> 02:08:19,149
I know, I know.

1458
02:08:24,071 --> 02:08:27,700
– Rev in speed! – Ho, how fondling!

1459
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:31,318
Oh, no!

1460
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:33,372
Go for it, cavendish! – Here we go!

1461
02:08:49,263 --> 02:08:50,931
Here we go.

1462
02:09:23,505 --> 02:09:26,884
Come on, Adam, we haven't all
day. You really need to drink this.

1463
02:09:27,009 --> 02:09:29,386
The worm fights back,

1464
02:09:29,428 --> 02:09:32,514
it is always darkest before the dawn.

1465
02:09:32,556 --> 02:09:34,016
Mr. Ewing?

1466
02:09:34,934 --> 02:09:38,186
Mr. Ewing is at a critical
juncture in his treatment.

1467
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:41,482
The next few hours will
determine if he lives or die.

1468
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:43,275
Then I stay here.

1469
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,696
– No, no, no you can't. – I
must. Mr. Ewing saved my life.

1470
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:49,406
It my duty.

1471
02:09:51,992 --> 02:09:55,037
Listen to me, you ignorant ape,

1472
02:09:55,162 --> 02:09:56,914
Mr. Ewing doesn't want you around him,

1473
02:09:56,956 --> 02:09:58,791
you probably infected him to begin with.

1474
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:03,128
He begged me, and I quote: "Keep
that dirty nigger away from me!"

1475
02:10:03,254 --> 02:10:06,298
So please kindly respect his wishes!

1476
02:10:37,705 --> 02:10:39,373
– Where'd he go? – I don't know.

1477
02:10:43,794 --> 02:10:45,004
Shit!

1478
02:11:03,188 --> 02:11:04,732
To freedom.

1479
02:11:29,548 --> 02:11:36,013
You are going to be sorry in
ways you cannot even imagine.

1480
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:27,106
– No immigrants here, no
immigrants here. – Look,

1481
02:12:27,147 --> 02:12:29,775
I'm not an inspector.
We need your help...

1482
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:33,277
I don't understand.

1483
02:12:33,278 --> 02:12:35,070
We don't want the
police to get involved,

1484
02:12:35,071 --> 02:12:36,907
but there is a man trying to kill me

1485
02:12:36,908 --> 02:12:39,326
and we really need your help.

1486
02:12:44,623 --> 02:12:48,711
Are there no true Scotsmen in the house?

1487
02:12:50,045 --> 02:12:54,091
Those there English gerrrrunts

1488
02:12:54,133 --> 02:12:58,721
are trampling all over
my God-given rrights!

1489
02:12:59,597 --> 02:13:02,057
These people are mine.

1490
02:13:06,186 --> 02:13:11,317
They've used me an' my pals most direly,

1491
02:13:11,442 --> 02:13:15,738
and we're in need of a
wee pit of assistance!

1492
02:13:15,863 --> 02:13:17,406
Right, pal...

1493
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:21,827
We'll not gonna let ye down.

1494
02:13:21,952 --> 02:13:24,079
Now you just look here, you grebo,

1495
02:13:24,121 --> 02:13:26,832
you can go shag your bloody sporran...

1496
02:14:01,367 --> 02:14:03,744
They two people came in
here, which way did they go?

1497
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:09,500
Which way they go?!

1498
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,045
Shut up!

1499
02:14:14,338 --> 02:14:15,965
Shut the fuck up!

1500
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,013
Stupid fucking wetback.

1501
02:14:27,851 --> 02:14:29,478
What-what's that, Ewing?

1502
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:34,275
How shall I comprehend when
you drool and dribble so?

1503
02:14:34,358 --> 02:14:36,902
Oh, let me hazard a guess,
something in the key of

1504
02:14:36,944 --> 02:14:39,863
"Oh Henry, how could you do this to me?

1505
02:14:40,155 --> 02:14:44,201
I thought we were friends?"
Oh, unfortunately, you're wrong.

1506
02:14:44,410 --> 02:14:48,622
Wrong like Horrox and
your silly father-in-law.

1507
02:14:48,747 --> 02:14:54,002
There is only one rule that binds
all people, one governing principle

1508
02:14:54,003 --> 02:14:56,672
that defines every relationship
on God's green earth.

1509
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:02,011
"The Weak are Meat and
the Strong Do Eat. "

1510
02:15:36,128 --> 02:15:37,129
That way.

1511
02:15:42,593 --> 02:15:46,013
I told Hooks you
couldn't be trusted, Joe.

1512
02:15:46,055 --> 02:15:48,390
You'll be next, you silver bitch.

1513
02:15:48,515 --> 02:15:50,434
Part of the business.

1514
02:15:51,268 --> 02:15:53,520
Enjoy your retirement.

1515
02:15:59,151 --> 02:16:02,696
Amaba... a este... perro!

1516
02:16:06,492 --> 02:16:09,078
And don't call me a fucking wetback.

1517
02:16:13,666 --> 02:16:15,668
"Why?" you ask.

1518
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:21,257
It's absurdly simple, there is
gold in your trunk, I want it.

1519
02:16:21,423 --> 02:16:23,842
so I've killed you for it.

1520
02:16:32,977 --> 02:16:35,354
Get off Mr. Ewing or
you know I kill you!

1521
02:16:38,941 --> 02:16:41,026
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Ewing!

1522
02:16:41,151 --> 02:16:44,321
Gotta flush you out. Com'on, Mr. Ewing.

1523
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:46,799
What was that?

1524
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:49,136
Kona war-cry.

1525
02:17:49,553 --> 02:17:50,721
Zachry!

1526
02:17:56,268 --> 02:17:57,686
Oh no no, Sonmi, no.

1527
02:17:58,520 --> 02:17:59,688
Zachry!

1528
02:18:06,779 --> 02:18:09,740
This is what the
general wanted me to see?

1529
02:18:20,876 --> 02:18:25,589
<i>The end rushes towards
me. Unable to eat or sleep.</i>

1530
02:18:25,714 --> 02:18:30,094
<i>Like Ewing, the "mortal
coil" has become a noose.</i>

1531
02:18:33,931 --> 02:18:36,433
<i>I'd rather become music.</i>

1532
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:49,238
They believe they're
going to Exultation.

1533
02:18:49,655 --> 02:18:52,533
But they are not, are they?

1534
02:19:06,046 --> 02:19:08,465
Welcome to Exultation.

1535
02:19:09,675 --> 02:19:11,135
Take a seat.

1536
02:19:14,889 --> 02:19:16,849
Just relax.

1537
02:19:17,892 --> 02:19:20,686
This is to remove your collar.

1538
02:21:38,991 --> 02:21:42,995
<i>"Enemy's sleepin',
don't slit that throat"</i>

1539
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:32,503
The genomics industry demands a huge
quantity of biomatter for wombtanks.

1540
02:22:32,628 --> 02:22:35,923
and more importantly to sustain
their engineered labor force.

1541
02:22:37,091 --> 02:22:40,553
Recycled Fabricants are
a cheap source of protein.

1542
02:22:41,804 --> 02:22:43,389
Soap.

1543
02:22:45,891 --> 02:22:49,144
They feed us to ourselves.

1544
02:23:00,239 --> 02:23:01,657
That ship...

1545
02:23:04,743 --> 02:23:07,454
The ship must be destroyed.

1546
02:23:09,456 --> 02:23:10,666
Yes.

1547
02:23:10,791 --> 02:23:15,337
The systems that built
them must be turned down.

1548
02:23:16,797 --> 02:23:17,840
Yes.

1549
02:23:19,091 --> 02:23:25,389
No matter if we're born in a tank
or a womb, we are all Pureblood.

1550
02:23:27,892 --> 02:23:28,684
Yes.

1551
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:36,817
We must all fight...
and if necessary, die

1552
02:23:37,693 --> 02:23:41,822
to teach people the truth.

1553
02:23:49,955 --> 02:23:52,499
This is what we have been waiting for.

1554
02:23:59,298 --> 02:24:00,799
<i>It's done.</i>

1555
02:25:21,922 --> 02:25:25,885
You were then taken to a
Union control satellite link.

1556
02:25:26,760 --> 02:25:32,975
I broadcast my Revelation to the twelve
States and four Off-World colonies.

1557
02:25:33,642 --> 02:25:38,355
18 minutes later, the
Enforcers attacked.

1558
02:25:39,899 --> 02:25:42,610
<i>To be is to be perceived.</i>

1559
02:25:43,235 --> 02:25:48,699
And so to know thyself is only
possible through the eyes of the other.

1560
02:25:51,619 --> 02:25:54,037
<i>The nature of our immortal lives</i>

1561
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:58,000
is in the consequences
of our words and deeds,

1562
02:25:58,918 --> 02:26:03,339
that go on and are pushing
themseves throughout all time.

1563
02:26:45,839 --> 02:26:47,716
Hide.

1564
02:27:14,743 --> 02:27:18,080
From good chief, now you're meat.

1565
02:28:20,392 --> 02:28:23,270
– Catkin... – Uncle Zach.

1566
02:28:30,402 --> 02:28:31,737
Thanks, Zachry.

1567
02:28:32,446 --> 02:28:34,990
No, thank you.

1568
02:28:44,375 --> 02:28:48,170
Com'on, Mr. Ewing. One more.

1569
02:28:48,671 --> 02:28:52,841
One more. Salt clean out your stomach.

1570
02:28:56,136 --> 02:28:59,890
Close. Com'on Mr. Ewing, com'on!

1571
02:29:03,852 --> 02:29:08,190
Do you see where we are, Mr. Ewing?

1572
02:29:10,150 --> 02:29:11,151
Home.

1573
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,202
Megan Sixsmith?

1574
02:29:30,629 --> 02:29:32,089
Make them pay.

1575
02:29:36,635 --> 02:29:38,679
You can count on it.

1576
02:29:48,063 --> 02:29:49,189
Thank you.

1577
02:29:53,193 --> 02:29:55,279
My uncle was a scientist,

1578
02:29:55,404 --> 02:29:58,949
but... he believed that love was real.

1579
02:30:00,201 --> 02:30:04,121
A kind of... natural phenomenon.

1580
02:30:06,665 --> 02:30:11,629
He believed that love
could outlive death.

1581
02:30:15,049 --> 02:30:19,011
<i>I finished it in a frenzy that reminded
me of our last night in Cambridge.</i>

1582
02:30:20,387 --> 02:30:24,642
<i>Watched my final sunrise,
enjoyed the last cigarette.</i>

1583
02:30:25,142 --> 02:30:27,644
<i>Didn't think the view
could be anymore perfect,</i>

1584
02:30:27,645 --> 02:30:30,022
until I saw that beat-up trilby.

1585
02:30:31,899 --> 02:30:35,986
<i>Honestly, Sixsmith, as ridiculous
as that thing makes you look,</i>

1586
02:30:36,111 --> 02:30:39,365
<i>I don't believe I've ever
seen anything more beautiful.</i>

1587
02:30:45,746 --> 02:30:48,290
<i>Watched you for as long as I dared.</i>

1588
02:30:50,459 --> 02:30:55,130
<i>I don't believe it was a
fluke that I saw you first.</i>

1589
02:30:58,242 --> 02:30:59,494
– Okay. – Thank you.

1590
02:31:04,890 --> 02:31:07,268
Captain saysoed he take you with us.

1591
02:31:07,393 --> 02:31:10,729
– I wanna go with
Meronym. – Go... Go where?

1592
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:16,235
Prescients in the same boat as
all us. Got no home neitherwise.

1593
02:31:18,112 --> 02:31:21,282
Nay, not yet.

1594
02:31:23,075 --> 02:31:28,581
You think someone will gonna hear
your prayer, come down from the sky?

1595
02:31:28,956 --> 02:31:30,499
Perhaps...

1596
02:31:30,624 --> 02:31:32,585
Perhaps one day.

1597
02:31:32,710 --> 02:31:35,087
One day ain't but a flea o' hope.

1598
02:31:35,629 --> 02:31:38,007
Yay, and fleas ain't so easy to rid.

1599
02:31:52,062 --> 02:31:55,441
<i>I believe there is another
world waiting for us, Sixsmith.</i>

1600
02:31:55,566 --> 02:31:57,484
<i>A better world.</i>

1601
02:31:57,985 --> 02:32:00,195
<i>And I'll be waiting for you there.</i>

1602
02:32:02,656 --> 02:32:03,866
May I help you, sir?

1603
02:32:03,867 --> 02:32:07,119
Yes, thank you. I-I'm looking for
a friend who came to Edinburg...

1604
02:32:14,126 --> 02:32:16,712
<i>I believe we do not stay dead long.</i>

1605
02:32:18,589 --> 02:32:22,134
<i>Find me beneath the Corsican
stars where we first kissed.</i>

1606
02:32:23,594 --> 02:32:27,389
<i>Yours eternally. R.F.</i>

1607
02:33:36,792 --> 02:33:40,921
The report said commander
Zheng was killed in the assault.

1608
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:43,215
That is correct.

1609
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:46,844
But you say that you loved him?

1610
02:33:48,554 --> 02:33:50,139
Yes I do.

1611
02:33:51,432 --> 02:33:54,727
You mean you are still in love with him?

1612
02:33:55,311 --> 02:33:57,980
I mean that I will always be.

1613
02:34:01,191 --> 02:34:04,486
Our lives are not our own.

1614
02:34:05,654 --> 02:34:10,492
From womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.

1615
02:34:13,412 --> 02:34:16,040
Past and present.

1616
02:34:23,923 --> 02:34:27,676
And by each crime and every kindness,

1617
02:34:29,303 --> 02:34:32,223
rebirth our future.

1618
02:34:56,205 --> 02:35:00,041
In your Revelation, you spoke of the
consequences of an undividual's life

1619
02:35:00,042 --> 02:35:03,420
replicated throughout eternity.

1620
02:35:06,090 --> 02:35:09,176
Does this mean that you
believe in an afterlife?

1621
02:35:10,302 --> 02:35:12,388
No heaven or hell?

1622
02:35:15,224 --> 02:35:19,353
I believe this is only a door.

1623
02:35:21,188 --> 02:35:25,234
When its closes, another opens.

1624
02:35:26,819 --> 02:35:29,488
If I can't imagine heaven,

1625
02:35:30,114 --> 02:35:32,741
I would imagine a thorough hope.

1626
02:35:34,410 --> 02:35:36,537
And behind it,

1627
02:35:37,788 --> 02:35:41,917
I will find him there, waiting for me.

1628
02:35:52,678 --> 02:35:54,138
My love.

1629
02:35:58,642 --> 02:36:01,312
Oh God, I missed you so much.

1630
02:36:08,110 --> 02:36:09,528
Thank you, sir.

1631
02:36:11,655 --> 02:36:14,491
If I may ask one last question...

1632
02:36:14,950 --> 02:36:18,454
You had to know this Union
scheme was doomed to fail.

1633
02:36:18,579 --> 02:36:19,580
Yes.

1634
02:36:19,872 --> 02:36:22,249
And why did you agree to it?

1635
02:36:22,499 --> 02:36:26,462
This is what general Apis asked of me.

1636
02:36:26,587 --> 02:36:28,672
What, to be executed?

1637
02:36:29,089 --> 02:36:33,801
If I had remained invisible,
the truth would stay hidden.

1638
02:36:33,802 --> 02:36:35,846
I couldn't allow that.

1639
02:36:38,349 --> 02:36:42,186
And what if no one believes this truth?

1640
02:36:44,813 --> 02:36:46,815
Someone already does.

1641
02:37:06,544 --> 02:37:08,295
Adam, good God...

1642
02:37:08,420 --> 02:37:12,049
I have just been recounting
your astonishing adventure.

1643
02:37:12,174 --> 02:37:14,759
Please, join us. Give him a chair.

1644
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:16,262
No no, thank you.

1645
02:37:16,387 --> 02:37:18,389
I cannot stay.

1646
02:37:18,472 --> 02:37:22,101
What are you doing here? Has not the
doctor said at least three weeks in bed?

1647
02:37:22,268 --> 02:37:24,937
He did, but this couldn't wait.

1648
02:37:26,105 --> 02:37:28,106
I need to speak with
you, sir. Privately.

1649
02:37:28,107 --> 02:37:30,150
Of course.

1650
02:37:38,701 --> 02:37:41,745
Is that the contract
from Reverend Horrox?

1651
02:37:42,955 --> 02:37:46,458
– It is indeed. – Well, you
know I could have sent a boy.

1652
02:37:51,922 --> 02:37:54,091
Are you insane?!

1653
02:37:54,466 --> 02:37:58,512
I owe my life to a self-freed slave.

1654
02:37:59,471 --> 02:38:03,976
And I cannot in good conscience participate
in this kind of business any longer.

1655
02:38:06,687 --> 02:38:08,856
This would make such a good book.

1656
02:38:08,981 --> 02:38:10,608
I'll drink to that.

1657
02:38:20,409 --> 02:38:26,916
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls.</i>

1658
02:38:27,041 --> 02:38:32,630
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in
Vermont, I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

1659
02:38:32,713 --> 02:38:36,967
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

1660
02:38:48,771 --> 02:38:54,068
Goddamn you, sir, if you were
not my daughter's husband...

1661
02:38:54,193 --> 02:38:55,736
Hello, Father.

1662
02:38:56,403 --> 02:38:57,571
Tilda?

1663
02:39:00,407 --> 02:39:01,783
What's going on?

1664
02:39:01,784 --> 02:39:04,245
I"ve come to say goodbye.

1665
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:06,872
Goodbye? Where are you going?

1666
02:39:06,997 --> 02:39:10,709
We're moving back East, to
work with the abolitionists.

1667
02:39:10,834 --> 02:39:12,336
What?

1668
02:39:13,295 --> 02:39:17,633
That poison has rotted your brain.

1669
02:39:17,675 --> 02:39:20,302
Oh yes, I highly recommend it.

1670
02:39:20,511 --> 02:39:22,638
I've not felt that good in years.

1671
02:39:22,763 --> 02:39:26,850
Tilda, I forbid you from going
anywhere with this mad man.

1672
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:30,104
I've been afraid of you
my whole life, Father.

1673
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:35,276
I'm going with my husband.

1674
02:39:40,322 --> 02:39:41,240
Adam.

1675
02:39:45,286 --> 02:39:47,079
Listen to me...

1676
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:51,292
For the sake of my
grandson, if not your own...

1677
02:39:51,417 --> 02:39:54,544
there is a natural order to this world,

1678
02:39:54,545 --> 02:39:58,257
and those who try to
upend it do not fare well.

1679
02:39:59,884 --> 02:40:02,803
This movement will never survive.

1680
02:40:03,429 --> 02:40:07,975
If you join them, you and your
entire family will be shunned.

1681
02:40:08,100 --> 02:40:12,688
At best, you exist as paria,
to be spat on and beaten.

1682
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:16,775
At worst, lynched or crucified.

1683
02:40:34,418 --> 02:40:36,337
And for what?

1684
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:39,340
For what?

1685
02:40:39,465 --> 02:40:42,675
No matter what you do, it will
never amount to anything more

1686
02:40:42,676 --> 02:40:46,388
than a single drop in a limitless ocean.

1687
02:40:47,556 --> 02:40:51,060
What is an ocean but
a multitude of drops?

1688
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:06,408
Fire is dyin'.

1689
02:41:07,785 --> 02:41:10,913
Just as well, my yawnin' is done.

1690
02:41:10,938 --> 02:41:12,938
No, please Gran'Pi, Please!

1691
02:41:14,959 --> 02:41:18,420
Come on, come here, you little
buggars! Com'on, it's getting cold!

1692
02:41:18,504 --> 02:41:21,716
No, you heard your Gran'mi,
com'on, get on with you.

1693
02:41:33,435 --> 02:41:36,397
You like it down here,
don't you Gran'pi?

1694
02:41:37,064 --> 02:41:41,026
Supposin'... reminds me of my Valley.

1695
02:41:41,151 --> 02:41:42,903
Which is Earth?

1696
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:49,034
That in there, that blue shimmerin'.

1697
02:41:54,290 --> 02:41:56,542
Now, help your Gran'pi up.

1698
02:42:00,671 --> 02:42:04,429
You gonna tell us about the
roguesome ship, and the big split,

1699
02:42:04,430 --> 02:42:05,718
and all the next-next?

1700
02:42:05,843 --> 02:42:09,430
Oh, your Gran'mi tells the
next-next way better than me.

1701
02:42:11,348 --> 02:42:13,642
D'you still love Gran'mi?

1702
02:42:15,895 --> 02:42:20,649
Your Gran'mi is the best
thin' that ever happened to me.

1703
02:42:26,822 --> 02:42:28,991
Come on, you Gran'pi.

1704
02:42:29,116 --> 02:42:32,036
Let me warm that li'le ol' bone.

1705
02:42:32,061 --> 02:42:34,061
