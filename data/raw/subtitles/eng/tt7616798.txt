1
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,033
<i>It's simple at first.</i>

2
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,476
<i>Home is the only place you know.</i>

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,631
<i>And everyone there is your family.</i>

4
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,516
<i>My first home was full of cats.</i>

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,036
<i>And I'm a dog.</i>

6
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,797
<i>Cats had sharp claws
and made a funny tummy sound</i>

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
<i>when they were happy.</i>

8
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,800
<i>The kittens had a mother cat.</i>

9
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,471
<i>And I had a mother dog.</i>

10
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,240
<i>I couldn't imagine
that life could get any better.</i>

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,799
<i>As I grew, we made a home together.</i>

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,551
<i>We were happy</i>

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,869
<i>for a while.</i>

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,230
Look at all of 'em.

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,576
You didn't tell me there were so many.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Just grab 'em!

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,336
- Hey!
- Found one. I got one over here.

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,476
Geez, they're fast.

19
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
I got one.

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,953
- Over there. Over there.
- Come here.

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,999
Hey, hey. There's dogs here, too.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Brother!

23
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,875
A whole bunch of 'em back here.

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,232
- Got another one.
- Sister!

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,073
Got it.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,909
There's a full-grown pit bull.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Here we go.

28
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Easy.

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,720
Easy.

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,110
Got her.

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,790
Mother!

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,239
- I'm going out.
- Come on.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,389
Get a bigger crate.

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,873
Coming out.

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Mother?

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,471
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

37
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,480
<i>I don't know what
would have happened to me</i>

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,755
<i>without Mother Cat.</i>

39
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,439
<i>And day by day,</i>

40
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,554
<i>little by little,</i>

41
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,719
<i>Mother Cat became my mother.</i>

42
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,236
- Hey.
- Hey.

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,750
It's just here.

44
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,678
Okay. We left work early
so we could be basically,

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,558
what, breaking and entering?

46
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,233
It's not breaking and entering, Olivia.

47
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,357
It's criminal trespass.
There's a difference.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,434
Okay, so, like, two years in prison
instead of six. Got it.

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,239
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Anyway, come on.

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,472
Can't say that a guy
rescuing kittens isn't hot.

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,837
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying you're not hot.

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,196
Thanks. Here.

53
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,511
- Come on. They're under here.
- Okay. Seriously?

54
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,393
Lucas, I'm not going in that hole.

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,080
Well, you're
the animal rescue volunteer.

56
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,576
- Okay.
- You don't have to crawl in.

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,876
Just take a look.

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,554
- There's so many of 'em.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,393
Apparently, Animal Control came,

60
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,154
but they didn't get 'em all.

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,517
And now, the builder says
he's gonna tear down the whole block,

62
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,954
cats or no cats.

63
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,795
<i>Men took my dog family,
but this man named Lucas was different.</i>

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,152
<i>- He came every day...</i>
- Hey.

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,277
<i>...and the cats trusted him.</i>

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Come on.

67
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,151
<i>And before I could even think,
my paws were moving.</i>

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Wait!

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,595
Lucas! Look, a puppy!

70
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,836
Oh, my God.

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,757
Hey. What are you doing here,
baby... Girl?

72
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,436
Hey.

73
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,433
<i>And he tasted good, too.</i>

74
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,874
She is really cute.

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,359
- Hi.
- Hey.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,480
It will not be hard finding you a home.

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,472
Well, wait.

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,160
I mean, you saw how she ran right to me.

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,776
Maybe that's a sign
that her home's supposed to be with me.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,634
Lucas, you cannot take care
of a dog, okay?

81
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,110
What do you do when you go
to school or the VA?

82
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,237
Listen, I actually live with my mom.

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,431
It's not how it sounds.
It... She's a veteran.

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,512
You might have seen her at the VA.

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,159
- Terri Ray?
- Yeah.

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,391
Well, she isn't able
to hold down a job just yet,

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,359
so, she's at home even when I'm not.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,036
Listen, maybe a puppy
would be good for her, too.

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,555
<i>Nothing had ever felt
as good as being held by him.</i>

90
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,552
She does really seem to like you a lot.

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,632
What do you see in him
that I don't, puppy?

92
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,951
Hey, you! Get out of there!

93
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,176
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go. Keep going.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,680
Private property!

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,416
- I'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

96
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,794
- See you. Bye.
- Call me.

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,950
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

98
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,551
I think I'm gonna call her Bella.

99
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,552
Honey, you know we can't have a puppy.

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,040
Our lease says no pets.

101
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,759
They say a dog is good for depression.

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,239
- Who says that?
- I'm pretty sure somebody says that.

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,776
Is this gonna be one of those things

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,917
I say is a terrible idea
and you do it, anyway?

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,720
Yeah. And who do you suppose
I learned that from?

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,869
<i>Lucas and I played the best games.</i>

107
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,999
Bella, get the ball.

108
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,554
<i>We played Get the Ball.</i>

109
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Stop.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,315
<i>We played Stop.</i>

111
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
Stop, Bella. I have to study.

112
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Here.

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,749
Have my blanket.

114
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,553
<i>It smelled amazing. Just like Lucas.</i>

115
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,671
<i>We played Don't Chew Shoes.</i>

116
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,956
Bella. Don't chew shoes.

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,113
<i>And there was my favourite game of all.</i>

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,916
What? What do you want?

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,832
I'm trying to...

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,837
Do you want a tiny piece of cheese?

121
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,672
<i>Tiny Piece of Cheese filled me</i>

122
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,672
<i>- with such a strong feeling.</i>
- There you go.

123
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,515
<i>Like I was safe and happy and warm,
all at once.</i>

124
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,114
<i>It was love.</i>

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,591
I've gotta go, gotta go,
gotta go, gotta go!

126
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,399
I'm so late.

127
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,550
Gotta go to work. Bye, Bella.

128
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,954
<i>The one game I didn't like
was Go to Work.</i>

129
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Be good.

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,038
<i>My Lucas blanket kept me company,</i>

131
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,477
<i>but it wasn't the same
as the real Lucas.</i>

132
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,111
<i>- I still had my cat family.</i>
- Slow down there.

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,350
<i>And Lucas became</i>

134
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,776
<i>- part of that family, too.</i>
- No, this is not for you, Bella.

135
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
This is for the cats. Come here.

136
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,395
See 'em?

137
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,312
Mother Cat!

138
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,593
<i>I love Mother Cat,
and I love being Bella.</i>

139
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,990
Come on. We're going home.

140
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,275
As you were, cats.

141
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,576
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

142
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,751
Bedtime, Bella. Come on.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,679
<i>And at the end of every day,
we played...</i>

144
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,837
Sit. You ready for your

145
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,560
- tiny piece of cheese?
<i>- ...Tiny Piece of Cheese.</i>

146
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,551
All right. On your blanket. Come on.

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
Night, Bella.

148
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,754
<i>Lucas was my person, and I was his dog.</i>

149
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,830
<i>I was home.</i>

150
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,720
<i>Whenever Lucas was playing</i>

151
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,950
<i>- Go to Work...</i>
- Good girl.

152
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,350
<i>...I would take Mom for a walk.</i>

153
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,955
- What is it, honey?
- It's that squirrel again!

154
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,520
I have to have that squirrel.

155
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,353
It's getting away!

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,352
- Bella. No, Bella.
- It's right there!

157
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,616
Come on, girl. No squirrel chasing.

158
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,074
Come on, Bella. Come on, girl.

159
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,356
<i>I loved Mom,
but she just didn't understand</i>

160
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,954
<i>- how to hunt squirrels.</i>
- Good.

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,874
Nice dog.

162
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,000
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.

163
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,071
I'm Gunter Beckenbauer.

164
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,879
Those are my houses there.

165
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,440
What do you want, Mr Beckenbauer?

166
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,751
Please, call me "Gunter."

167
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,680
<i>I knew that smell.</i>

168
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,991
<i>- And I knew this wasn't good.</i>
- Look.

169
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,673
I know it's your son who's been calling

170
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,576
the county building authority
about the stupid cats,

171
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
which I got rid of.

172
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,920
I've lost the whole summer now,

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
so, could you please
just ask him to back off?

174
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,036
My son isn't gonna back off,
Mr Beckenbauer,

175
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,237
because there are still cats
living there.

176
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,754
Animal Control says there's not.

177
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,071
Animal Control is lying, and so are you.

178
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,518
What kind of dog is that? Pit bull?

179
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,515
We don't know. We found her living
with the cats you say aren't there.

180
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,313
What I'm trying to say, lady,

181
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,312
is that you and your boy do not
want to go to war with me.

182
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,280
War? What do you know about war?

183
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,556
Okay.

184
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,456
But let the record show that I tried

185
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,995
to settle this friendly,
and you're the one pushing it.

186
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,199
No, the record shows that you came here
and said we were going to war.

187
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,397
Come on, Bella, relax.

188
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,110
Relax. Let's go do your business.

189
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,395
What is it? Cold, wet.

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Ice cream!

191
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,316
- Ice cream is falling from the sky!
- Bella.

192
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,510
It's snow.

193
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,992
It's just snow. Now, do your business.

194
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,153
What? What?

195
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,474
Go on, go on.

196
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,436
Come on, go on. Go on.

197
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,390
Go on.

198
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,509
Go on. Yeah.

199
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,273
<i>- I loved Snow Do Your Business.</i>
- Go on.

200
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,720
- Lucas is home!
- Hello.

201
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,200
Hi. Hey.

202
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,430
<i>When Lucas came home,</i>

203
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,230
<i>- I feltjoy in my whole body.</i>
- Hello. Hello.

204
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,231
- What's that?
- I don't know.

205
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,073
It was taped to the door.

206
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,114
Oh, no.

207
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,919
It's the landlord.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,992
He's coming tomorrow
to check the faucet.

209
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,675
But I have therapy and you have to work.

210
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,991
What will we do with Bella?

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,959
She can't be in the house
when he's here.

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,677
Just stick to the plan.

213
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,796
If they see her, you're gonna get fired.

214
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,917
Don't worry.

215
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,197
All clear. Hurry up.

216
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,154
<i>That day, I got to do Go to Work.</i>

217
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,117
Bella. Okay, stay here. Stay.

218
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,157
<i>I didn't like Stay.</i>

219
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,717
No barks. Understand?

220
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,960
I'll come check on you
in a little while.

221
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,873
You can't get caught, okay, Bella?

222
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,078
Wait, hold on. Where are you going?

223
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,994
No barks.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,390
I definitely do not get this game.

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,675
Lucas?

226
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,631
PT reports he's not responding,

227
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,996
and recommends going to twice a day.

228
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,390
Okay, well, we can try, but if he...

229
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,836
Dr Gann,

230
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,552
would you excuse me?

231
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,751
- Hey, Valerie, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

232
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,918
Yes, I was barking, but it worked.

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
- Here you are.
- No.

234
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,550
Is that the game?

235
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,396
Bella?

236
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,790
- Oh, my gosh, she's gotten so big.
- Olivia!

237
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,916
- Hi.
- Do you know

238
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,835
anybody here who could watch her,
just for an hour or so, until my break?

239
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,400
Just an hour.

240
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,958
Okay, fine, but you know
you only ever talk to me

241
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,713
when you have animal issues, right?

242
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
Am I interrupting something?

243
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,953
Now, this could not possibly be
a dog in the VA against all the regs.

244
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,271
I know, Teo.
We can't leave Bella home today.

245
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,750
If the landlord catches us with a dog,
we could get evicted.

246
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,035
Now, I understand.

247
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,112
The game is Crowd in a Small Room.

248
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,634
Bella, huh?

249
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,359
You know what?

250
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,757
I've got this.

251
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,715
Everybody? Everybody?

252
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,715
Thought I'd bring a special guest
to today's meeting.

253
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,598
I'd like you to meet the lovely Bella.

254
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,273
- Hi, Bella.
- Great. That's great.

255
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,272
- Look at that.
- How long you been sober?

256
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,874
That long, huh?

257
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,232
It was a good idea, man.

258
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,474
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

259
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,016
- It'll only happen once in a while...
- Yeah.

260
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,475
<i>After that, I really liked Go to Work.</i>

261
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,696
- Looks like she likes being here.
- I think she does, too.

262
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,234
I just have no motivation.

263
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,074
Like, I know it would be
good for me, but...

264
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,595
<i>I could always feel
Mom's sadness going away</i>

265
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,560
<i>when I comforted her,
like Mother Cat comforted me.</i>

266
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,714
Mack, what's it been like with you?

267
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,036
It's... It's like...

268
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,919
It's, like, pain all the time.

269
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,856
<i>- But she wasn't the only one...</i>
- Every morning.

270
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,916
<i>...who needed me.</i>

271
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,596
<i>Mack was the most sad.</i>

272
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,198
That's real. That's real talk.

273
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,114
You know? Hey, girl.

274
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,835
I'm gonna bring her again tomorrow.

275
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,554
Look who's here!

276
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,753
<i>Now, I had lots of new friends.</i>

277
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,271
- Come on, Bella.
- Look at that.

278
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,239
<i>Drew took me on rides in his small car.</i>

279
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,433
Bella, open.

280
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,558
<i>Steve had really delicious spoons.</i>

281
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,319
<i>Some of my friends had tags,
just like me.</i>

282
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,470
Good girl.

283
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
Bella!

284
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,436
Bella, get down.

285
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,318
We're doing laundry. Down.

286
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,909
<i>I really liked Doing Laundry.</i>

287
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,232
<i>And everyone played a game
called Dr Gann.</i>

288
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,356
Doctor!

289
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,477
- Dr Gann.
- Hey, let's go.

290
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,816
- Hey, Dr Gann.
- Good morning. How are you?

291
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
Dr Gann. In you go. In you go!

292
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,395
Were you going in, or...

293
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,799
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Your turn.

294
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,356
- Shoot.
- Okay, no...

295
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,477
- Take your time. Okay.
- Thank you.

296
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,880
All right. Good morning.

297
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,136
- Good morning, Doc.
- Good morning, everyone.

298
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,536
- Morning, Dr Gann.
- Good morning, Doc.

299
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,710
- Morning.
- What's up, Doc?

300
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,910
Okay.

301
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,436
Everything all right?

302
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,196
Bye, Doc.

303
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,272
- Good girl.
- What a good girl.

304
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,479
Let's do that again!

305
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,279
- So smart.
- Good girl.

306
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,514
I had fun last night.

307
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Me, too.

308
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,954
<i>Now, whenever Lucas and I
went looking for that squirrel,</i>

309
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,656
<i>- Olivia came, too.</i>
- Next time, all right?

310
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,280
So, there's gonna be a next time?
Got it.

311
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,598
All right, let's go.

312
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,960
- Take Bella?
- Yeah.

313
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,936
- I'm gonna call the rescue.
- Yeah.

314
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,996
Hey!

315
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,838
Wait! Stop!

316
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,960
What the hell you doing?

317
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,236
There are still cats living there.
You can't do this.

318
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,073
- We've got a permit.
- That doesn't matter.

319
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,637
- You kidding me?
- Hey!

320
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,320
- I have had enough of you, you crazy...
- They're on it.

321
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,037
Can I talk to you for a minute?

322
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,554
Why you screwing with my life?

323
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,120
How did you even get a permit?

324
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,115
Property's certified. No cats.

325
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,590
- Hey.
- I'm live-streaming, cat killer.

326
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,000
There are no cats!

327
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,669
Mother Cat!

328
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,430
Where are you going?

329
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,590
No cats?

330
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,878
The rescue organisation that I work with
just called the Building Commission

331
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,016
to have your permit yanked.

332
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,315
Like they move that fast.

333
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,312
They do when our board member calls.

334
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,595
She's a county commissioner.

335
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,875
Hey, Gunter.

336
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,878
Yeah.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,195
It's about your permit.

338
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,071
Who on earth could that be?

339
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,992
I don't know. I'll get it.

340
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Excuse me.

341
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,680
There's been a complaint that you may be
harbouring a dangerous animal.

342
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,313
A complaint? From who?

343
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,916
As you may know, pit bulls are illegal
in the City of Denver.

344
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,959
As long as it's on your property,
we can't touch it.

345
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,000
- I remember him.
- I am informing you

346
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,993
that if that dog
gets picked up on the street,

347
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,194
it will be impounded.

348
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,234
Have a nice night.

349
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,757
Okay, Bella, this is very important.

350
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,112
We're gonna try this again.

351
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,351
Okay. You ready?

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,036
And...

353
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,070
Go home.

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,116
That's it, Bella.

355
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,156
Go home.

356
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,236
Yep.

357
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,955
Best game ever!

358
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,360
<i>Doing Go Home meant
I should put my head right here.</i>

359
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,599
Yes! You did it!

360
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,639
You did Go Home. Well done.

361
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,952
- That was impressive.
- Good job, Bella.

362
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Good girl.

363
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,516
So, now,
if we take Bella off the property

364
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,480
and Animal Control tries to take her,
we just say, "Go home."

365
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,795
<i>I loved making Lucas happy.</i>

366
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,680
That squirrel!

367
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,154
I had to have that squirrel.

368
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,159
Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel!

369
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,115
<i>Bella?</i>

370
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Bella!

371
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,555
Bella!

372
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,110
Bella!

373
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,560
Bella, I've been looking
all over for you.

374
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,431
Bad dog.

375
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,434
Bella, you can never,
ever do that again.

376
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,955
I don't care about the window,
but you cannot run away.

377
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,440
Hold it right there, pal.

378
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
I'm impounding that animal.

379
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,311
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am, and that's my backup.

380
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,279
This is a pit bull.
And this is a legal impoundment.

381
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,477
If he resists, you arrest him.

382
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,239
Go home, Bella.

383
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,674
Bella, go home.

384
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,395
- Go home, Bella.
<i>- But you need me.</i>

385
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,629
Bella.

386
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,191
Bella, please, go home.

387
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,919
Bella, please. Go home, Bella.

388
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,036
That's right.

389
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,157
- Easy does it.
- Bella, go home.

390
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,640
Easy. There we go.

391
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,429
Don't do that.

392
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,749
- Sir.
- Come on.

393
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,711
Sir, let go, now.

394
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,760
You need to let him have the dog.

395
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,233
Not with that on her.

396
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,757
Let go.

397
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,355
Chuck, let him do it.

398
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,676
It's okay, Bella.

399
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,837
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

400
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,912
Follow me.

401
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,479
It's okay. I got you, baby. It's okay.

402
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,195
It's okay.

403
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,590
Bella, I screwed up.

404
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,034
I'm so sorry.

405
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,195
- All right.
<i>- All of a sudden,</i>

406
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,720
<i>- I smelled so many other dogs.</i>
- You're okay. It's all right.

407
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,560
I will come get you, Bella. Understand?

408
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,553
I'm sorry I didn't do Go Home, Lucas.

409
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,110
- I will not let them hurt you.
- Okay, that's enough.

410
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,714
Step away, please.

411
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Step away.

412
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,830
Please.

413
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,679
Lucas?

414
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,990
<i>It was so loud,
and all the dogs were so sad.</i>

415
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,870
Okay.

416
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,555
In you go.

417
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,554
<i>I thought if I did Good Dog,
they'd let me go back to Lucas.</i>

418
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,155
<i>I did Sit.</i>

419
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,713
<i>I did Sit some more.</i>

420
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,600
<i>I did No Barks.</i>

421
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,552
<i>I did Lots of Barks.</i>

422
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,319
<i>I really needed my Lucas blanket.</i>

423
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,636
<i>I should have done Go Home.</i>

424
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,756
Come on.

425
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,712
Hello.

426
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,553
Hang on.

427
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,951
You don't seem like such
a dangerous animal to me, sweet girl.

428
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,117
Come on. Come on.

429
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,877
- Hey!
- Lucas!

430
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,270
- Hi. Hi.
<i>- I'm ready to do Go Home.</i>

431
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,760
Hey. See, I'm here.

432
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,416
- I'm here.
- Well, there's question one.

433
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,874
She's obviously your dog.

434
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,600
Good girl. I know. I know. Good girl.

435
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,717
All right. There you go.

436
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,799
So, you've paid the fine.

437
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,515
I just need to give you
the discharge information.

438
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,991
In Denver, all that's required for a dog
to be classified as a pit bull

439
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,313
is for three Animal Control officers
to certify that it is.

440
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,437
And Bella has been certified pit bull.

441
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,439
What does "certified pit" mean?

442
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,870
It means if they pick her up again,
she'll be euthanised.

443
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,559
- What?
- That's the law.

444
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,518
Pit bull's a pretty loose description.
It's like saying "hound dog."

445
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,991
So, the City Council essentially voted
that a dog can be banned from the city

446
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,230
because of how it looks.

447
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,152
That's basically racism for dogs.

448
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,594
I know. It's stupid.

449
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,559
I mean, Bella is the most gentle dog
in the world.

450
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
You should see her at the hospital
with the veterans.

451
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,319
I mean, they love her.

452
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,073
What about if we move?

453
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,516
Like, Golden or somewhere
out of the city limits?

454
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,636
That works.

455
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,456
Meanwhile, do you have someone
who can look after her?

456
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,312
My aunt and uncle,
they live in Farmington.

457
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,000
- Maybe they could help us.
- New Mexico?

458
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,153
It's like 400 miles.

459
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,279
I'm really ready to do Go Home now.

460
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,471
All right, here we go.
Got your dinosaur.

461
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,269
What else do we have?

462
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,913
It's so good of you to do this.

463
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,275
We're just happy to help.

464
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,200
Olivia's such a sweetheart.

465
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,520
Well, this is it.

466
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,074
I'll be in the car.

467
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,114
Why is everyone so sad?

468
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,112
We're all home, now.

469
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,511
Bella, I'm so sorry.

470
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,600
See you soon.

471
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,994
Okay, I'll sneak out the back window.

472
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,596
At least there's no screen on that one.

473
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,910
Hey.

474
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,229
Here, I got ya, I got ya.

475
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Hello.

476
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,516
Stop.

477
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,678
Backup can't possibly get here
fast enough to help you.

478
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,156
We understand the little game
that you're playing here.

479
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,630
It's Gunter, isn't it?

480
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,112
You work for him?

481
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,112
Maybe you're just buddies.

482
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,199
Now, you're gonna let my son

483
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,352
walk to that car
to say goodbye to his dog

484
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,750
without any interference from you.

485
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,836
Copy?

486
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,196
Copy.

487
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,394
Go on, Bella. That's it.

488
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,360
Hey.

489
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,875
You're such a good girl, Bella.

490
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,597
I know you won't understand,
but I'm not abandoning you.

491
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,717
I just have to send you somewhere safe.

492
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,512
Where are we going?

493
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,395
Why can't I ride in the front with you?

494
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,439
Here.

495
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,000
You gotta have your blanket.

496
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,470
Why did he bring my Lucas blanket?

497
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,000
It should be on the bed.

498
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,597
I promise, very soon,
you'll get to go home.

499
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,869
Lucas said, "Go home,"
but then he shut the door.

500
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,193
<i>I need Lucas!</i>

501
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,432
Please! No!

502
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,438
<i>His scent was fading.</i>

503
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,431
<i>I was getting farther and farther away.</i>

504
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,796
<i>I smelled my Lucas blanket
to feel better,</i>

505
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,679
<i>but it wasn't Lucas.</i>

506
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Sit.

507
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,039
Bella, come here.

508
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,396
Yes.

509
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,511
You're so pretty. Yes, you are.

510
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,356
<i>These people were nice.</i>

511
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,151
<i>They took care of me,
but they weren't my family.</i>

512
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,994
<i>This wasn't home.</i>

513
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,116
Hello?

514
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,638
Hey, how is everything?

515
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,394
She's fine. Yeah. Really?

516
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,632
Okay. All right. See you tomorrow, then.

517
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,796
Guess what?

518
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,190
They found a nice place in Golden,

519
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,239
and they're coming to get you tomorrow.

520
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,598
I bet you're ready to go home.
You're a good dog, Bella.

521
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,353
<i>José said, "Go home."</i>

522
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,576
- You're a good dog.
<i>- But how?</i>

523
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,750
Good night.

524
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,072
<i>That feeling came again.</i>

525
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,951
<i>I was supposed to be with Lucas.</i>

526
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,870
<i>I had to find a way to get to him.</i>

527
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,193
<i>I didn't know what that loud thing was,</i>

528
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,637
<i>but José sure liked to take it
for walks around the yard.</i>

529
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,558
<i>But I do remember that
from Snow Do Your Business.</i>

530
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,320
Wait.

531
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
Yes!

532
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm doing it!

533
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm doing Go Home!

534
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,239
<i>I could tell that Go Home
was very far away.</i>

535
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,312
<i>But I knew that I was going
in the right direction.</i>

536
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,794
<i>The feeling now was a pull,
like I was on a leash</i>

537
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,476
<i>and being told how to do Go Home.</i>

538
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,351
<i>And if I kept going,
I knew I would see Lucas again.</i>

539
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,911
<i>By that first night, I was so tired.</i>

540
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,475
<i>And there were so many strange smells.</i>

541
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
What's that?

542
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,593
It looks like a cat,
but it smells like a dog.

543
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,913
I hope it doesn't come back.

544
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
<i>It was breakfast time,</i>

545
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,072
<i>but I couldn't find
a bowl of food anywhere.</i>

546
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,717
It's not in a bowl,

547
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,950
but I'll take it.

548
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,871
This breakfast is really fast!

549
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,837
I need breakfast!

550
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,479
This breakfast was harder to hunt
than that squirrel.

551
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,829
<i>I was hungrier than I'd ever been.</i>

552
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,434
People.

553
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,637
There are people down there.

554
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,435
A pack.

555
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,673
Maybe I shouldn't bother them.

556
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,200
But I'm so hungry.

557
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,313
One Tooth is big.

558
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,316
To be polite, I'll carefully sniff
where the other dogs have marked.

559
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
What?

560
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,913
Crazy Hair is in charge.

561
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,030
Thanks.

562
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,160
<i>This was a great pack.</i>

563
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,715
<i>They knewjust where to go
to get the best chicken.</i>

564
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,996
Hey. There you are.

565
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,910
Yeah, today's special. Chicken.

566
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,040
You like that. You like...

567
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,554
I love this chicken guy.

568
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,394
Okay, very good. That's it. That's it.

569
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,472
You can go now, okay? Go.

570
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,116
Coming.

571
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,920
<i>One Tooth was a brave hunter,</i>

572
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,959
<i>who wasn't afraid of anything.</i>

573
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,316
<i>It was exciting
to learn to hunt from him.</i>

574
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,673
<i>- This pack was so much fun.</i>
- Hello.

575
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,752
Hi, sweethearts.

576
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,911
And who are you? Are you new?

577
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,798
There you go, sweethearts. Yeah.

578
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,472
Please go home, now.
Go on home, now. Go on home.

579
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,438
How did she know I was doing Go Home?

580
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Go home!

581
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,316
<i>- It was a wonderful day.</i>
- Good boy, Sarge.

582
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,800
But where's One Tooth going?

583
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,440
All right, in you go. Come on.

584
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,160
And Shaggy Butt, too?

585
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,711
Guess that just leaves
you and me, Crazy Hair.

586
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,996
Wait.

587
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,197
Everyone in this pack
has their own people.

588
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,673
<i>Crazy Hair wanted me to go with him,
to be part of his family.</i>

589
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,792
<i>It seemed nice in there,
with lots of good smells.</i>

590
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,276
<i>I could be happy here.</i>

591
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,954
<i>But they didn't need me.</i>

592
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,831
<i>Mom needed me.</i>

593
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,352
<i>Lucas needed me.</i>

594
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,440
<i>And I needed them.</i>

595
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,429
Lucy! There you are.

596
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,156
<i>So, I had to keep doing Go Home.</i>

597
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,477
<i>Now, I knew that to hunt,
I needed to go where there were people</i>

598
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,236
<i>and do what One Tooth taught me.</i>

599
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,434
<i>I smelled blood.</i>

600
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,555
<i>It was the largest animal
I had ever seen.</i>

601
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,040
<i>And something very bad
had happened to her.</i>

602
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,391
Come on! Through here.

603
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,073
I see it. Go.

604
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,736
Thing's gotta be worth a thousand bucks.

605
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,479
At least. Beautiful.

606
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,115
- What do you figure? About 125 pounds?
- Yeah.

607
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,919
- Hey, let's get a selfie.
- Yeah, you bet.

608
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,116
Okay, ready?

609
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
- Yeah.
- Here.

610
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,115
She's beautiful.

611
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,479
- Yeah, that one's going up on the wall.
- Yeah.

612
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,279
What is that?

613
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,159
<i>It kind of looks like a cat.</i>

614
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,950
<i>I hoped the cat would leave with me
and not get caught by those bad men.</i>

615
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>That cat didn't smell
like any cat I ever knew.</i>

616
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,311
<i>Was it following me?</i>

617
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,151
<i>Yep, it was following me.</i>

618
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,999
<i>And suddenly, I realised
it wasn't a full-grown cat.</i>

619
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,032
<i>It was still just a kitten.</i>

620
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,113
<i>A really big kitten.</i>

621
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,913
Come on, Big Kitten. This way.

622
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,232
<i>That big animal
must have been this kitten's mother.</i>

623
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,717
<i>Big Kitten made me think of Mother Dog</i>

624
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,838
<i>and how sad I was
when she was taken away.</i>

625
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,639
<i>She needed someone to take care of her.</i>

626
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,439
<i>Big Kitten's mother
couldn't feed her any more,</i>

627
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,356
<i>so, I did.</i>

628
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,551
<i>I was Big Kitten's Mother Cat now.</i>

629
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,314
<i>Big Kitten needed to eat, and so did I.</i>

630
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,710
<i>So, I did what any mother would do.</i>

631
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,029
<i>I went hunting.</i>

632
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,389
Sorry, baby!

633
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,311
Hey! Hey! Drop it!

634
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,195
<i>Many nights, Big Kitten would
wander off on her own.</i>

635
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,711
<i>I would sleep and dream of home.</i>

636
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,872
You ready for your tiny piece of cheese?

637
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,111
Here you go. Good girl.

638
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,637
<i>You're such a good dog, Bella.</i>

639
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,992
<i>As time passed
and Big Kitten got bigger,</i>

640
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,757
<i>she still didn't seem to understand
how to do Go Home.</i>

641
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,039
<i>So, when she tried
to take me away from it,</i>

642
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,191
<i>I would always have to bring her back.</i>

643
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,754
<i>Whenever Big Kitten went out at night,
someone gave her food.</i>

644
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,232
<i>Cats love fish,</i>

645
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,277
<i>but I wish
someone would give her chicken.</i>

646
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,790
<i>We kept each other warm.</i>

647
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,512
<i>We were family now.</i>

648
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,516
<i>I had been smelling something
all morning.</i>

649
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,111
<i>Something like dog.</i>

650
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,676
<i>First, I heard them.</i>

651
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,076
<i>Then I saw them.</i>

652
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,469
<i>Their eyes were cold.</i>

653
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,195
<i>They were hunting us.</i>

654
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,635
<i>And I had to protect Big Kitten.</i>

655
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,836
Hey! Get out! Get out of here!

656
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,310
Scram! Get out!

657
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,516
Hey, check it out.

658
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,911
- Is that a bobcat?
- No, no, it's a cougar.

659
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,390
It's a young cougar.

660
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,115
<i>- Big Kitten was afraid of the men.</i>
- That's really fast.

661
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,592
<i>But I decided to see
if they would give us food.</i>

662
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,637
Pretty scared to me.

663
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,456
I've never seen a cougar
in the wild before.

664
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,359
I mean, this thing was huge.
It was like 10 feet long.

665
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,999
- Easy, 12.
- Yeah.

666
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,551
Hey. Let's see if your name
is on your tag.

667
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Who's a good girl?

668
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,231
- She's a cutie.
- She is.

669
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Want some ham?

670
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,440
There's your ham.
There you go. Sit. Good girl.

671
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,000
Her name is Bella.

672
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,536
Give me a paw. Good girl. There you go.

673
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,791
And there's a telephone number.
"Lucas Ray."

674
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,916
Lucas?

675
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,469
I'm gonna call the guy.

676
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,696
Hey, guys, I think
there's something moving out there.

677
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,960
Okay, it's going to voice mail.

678
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,336
<i>Hi. You've reached Lucas Ray...</i>

679
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,113
- That's him!
<i>- ...assistant case manager</i>

680
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,432
<i>at McLaren VA Hospital.
Please leave a message.</i>

681
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,716
<i>If you're calling
about my lost dog Bella...</i>

682
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,016
Man, she's kind of freaking out.

683
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,751
<i>...please, leave your number
or call Olivia at 612-589-1743...</i>

684
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
What?

685
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,278
- Cougar! Get in the truck!
- Oh, God.

686
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
I'm here, Lucas.

687
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,394
I'm here. I'm here.

688
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,517
It's Snow Do Your Business!

689
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,716
She acted like that was easy.

690
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,240
A dog!

691
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,951
It's been so long
since I played with a dog.

692
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,717
Dutch, what are you barking at?

693
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,800
Hey.

694
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,194
- Be quiet. Come on!
- Shut up!

695
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,190
Dutch!

696
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,996
You stupid mutt!

697
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,350
Dutch!

698
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,360
Get out of there!

699
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,876
Dutch!

700
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,559
<i>I could smell the fear of the other dog.</i>

701
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,840
He must be down here.
These are his dogs.

702
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,597
- Here! Here!
- Come on.

703
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,553
Is he breathing?

704
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,314
Call 911.

705
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,840
Okay, head up.

706
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,193
- Is he gonna make it?
- Yeah.

707
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,396
You saved his life.

708
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,949
What about the dogs? These are his.

709
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,271
I mean, I guess that's up to you guys.

710
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,479
We can call Animal Control for you,
but we can't wait for them.

711
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,433
Sorry, guys. Good luck.

712
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,315
I guess they go with us.

713
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
Come on, dogs.

714
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Big Kitten!

715
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,718
Come on. Come on.

716
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,560
Don't take me away from her.
She needs me.

717
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,633
Come on, dogs. Come on.

718
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,154
No.

719
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:50,359
Come on. Come on.

720
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,639
Please.

721
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,875
Dutch, come here.

722
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,552
Come on, girl. You can trust us.

723
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,394
Why do I get the feeling
you're secretly enjoying this?

724
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,992
I like dogs.

725
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,640
We need to feed this girl more, though.

726
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,599
- You can see her ribs.
- Out.

727
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,911
Hey, no, no, no, no. No. Don't scratch.

728
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
What's your name?

729
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,470
Molly? Ellie?

730
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,676
Let me out.

731
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,070
- Blanche.
- Blanche?

732
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,676
You gotta be kidding me.

733
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,513
My mother's dog was named Blanche.

734
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:36,072
Well, that explains a lot.

735
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,153
See? He likes it here.

736
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,550
Gavin, we have to give
the guy his dogs back.

737
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,271
I like <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

738
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,036
<i>Ever so faintly,
I could smell Big Kitten on the wind.</i>

739
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,959
<i>She was waiting for me.</i>

740
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,392
<i>And beyond her, Lucas and Go Home.</i>

741
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,756
Beatrice? Millie? Sophie?

742
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,080
Sadie?

743
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,715
Chloe?

744
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,880
Bella.

745
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Bella.

746
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,510
Bella! See? See, I told you.
It's Bella. That's a good dog.

747
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,592
- How did he know my name?
- Your name is Bella.

748
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,990
When we get back to the city,
yeah, I'm gonna get you

749
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,400
a tag with your name on it.

750
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,039
I am. Yes, I am.

751
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,680
Gavin.

752
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,073
<i>Dutch liked it here, and so did I.</i>

753
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,518
<i>We had food whenever we needed it.</i>

754
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
Want a snack?

755
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,956
<i>We were inside and warm.</i>

756
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,752
<i>Dutch and I had a soft spot to sleep on.</i>

757
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,399
<i>And each other.</i>

758
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,392
<i>It started to feel like home.</i>

759
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,110
- Hey.
- Hey.

760
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,280
What's this?

761
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,150
To celebrate you finishing your novel.

762
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,154
Hey. Come here.

763
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,200
Did you put our phone number
on their dog tags?

764
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,834
Well, whose number would I put on it?

765
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,716
<i>This smell was familiar.</i>

766
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,951
You helping me?
You like doing laundry, Bella?

767
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,794
- Hello.
<i>- Doing Laundry? I knew that game.</i>

768
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,234
Guess you do.

769
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,549
Yeah.

770
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,874
What is it?

771
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,872
Can you excuse me, please?

772
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,349
That guy from the avalanche...
His sister.

773
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,193
He's out of the hospital.

774
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,633
I'm sorry, I...

775
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,717
Yes, I'm sure he is.

776
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,834
<i>Dutch had definitely been here before.</i>

777
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,310
<i>He had marked
just about everything in the yard.</i>

778
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,670
Easy, Dutch. Easy.

779
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,912
Hello? Mr Kurch?

780
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,356
- Come on, Bella.
- Mr. Kurch? Hello?

781
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,440
Back here.

782
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,798
Geez! Dutch.

783
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,555
Get down!

784
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,120
Well, Dutch is just happy to see you.

785
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,591
I got 11 freaking fractures,
and the dog's jumping all over me.

786
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,956
Get off of me, stupid dog!

787
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,520
<i>Dutch was happy to see this man,</i>

788
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,399
<i>but what kind of a man
wouldn't be happy to see Dutch?</i>

789
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,631
I'm Taylor. This is Gavin.

790
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,816
We're the ones who dug you out.

791
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,752
I don't remember any of that.

792
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,470
All I know is my sister says
you're bringing the dog over,

793
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,914
which is ridiculous.

794
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,640
Ridiculous?

795
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,039
I don't understand you.

796
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,192
Do I look like I can take care of a dog?

797
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,390
But they're your dogs.

798
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,560
Dogs? I never even seen
that other one before.

799
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,279
Bella's not yours?

800
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,760
But she was trying to dig you out.

801
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,475
I'm not taking either one.

802
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,995
But you have to take Dutch at least.

803
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,833
Whatever you're doing
with that other one,

804
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,274
do the same thing with Dutch.

805
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
Come on, dogs.

806
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,237
Let's go, Dutch. Come on.

807
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,320
Come on.

808
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,278
- Come on.
- That man belongs alone.

809
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,635
Come here.

810
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,790
Come here, Bella.

811
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,200
- Good girl.
- Hey.

812
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,070
So, now, we have two big, slobbery dogs.

813
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,674
Just like I've always wanted.

814
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,559
They're good dogs.

815
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,632
- Yeah, they are.
- Hey, come here.

816
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,712
- Come here, Bella. Come here.
- There you are.

817
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,399
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

818
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,795
<i>The snow was gone,
but I knew where I was.</i>

819
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,314
<i>I was near the last place
I saw Big Kitten.</i>

820
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,118
<i>And suddenly, I felt it.</i>

821
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,198
<i>The pull of that invisible leash,
stronger than ever.</i>

822
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,031
You know what we should do?
Go to the pet store.

823
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,315
We need to get dog food.

824
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,959
<i>Dutch wanted me to stay.</i>

825
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,793
<i>- To be part of this new family.</i>
- Hey, hey! Hey, dogs! No, no, no.

826
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:06,950
No, that's too far.

827
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
- Come on!
- Come here.

828
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,856
<i>- It would have been so easy.</i>
- Dogs! Hey, Dutch.

829
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,678
- Dutch.
- Come on.

830
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,359
- Hey, dogs.
- Come. Bella.

831
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,476
Dutch.

832
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
Dutch.

833
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,360
- Bella, come on.
- There we go.

834
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,230
<i>Dutch had finally gone home,</i>

835
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,656
<i>- to a home he deserved.</i>
- All right. Good boy, Dutch.

836
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,911
- Hey, come on, Bella.
- Come here.

837
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,816
- Bella, come on.
- There you go. Stay. Stay.

838
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,910
Bella!

839
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,877
- Wait, Bella. Bella!
- Come here. Come here.

840
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,155
Bella.

841
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,470
Bella, come!

842
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,596
Bella!

843
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,394
<i>Dutch had found his Lucas.</i>

844
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,153
- Come on. Come on, Bella.
- Bella.

845
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,472
<i>Now, I needed to find mine.</i>

846
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,630
Bella!

847
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,232
<i>I was hungry again.</i>

848
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,277
<i>And I missed Big Kitten.</i>

849
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,840
<i>And Dutch.</i>

850
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,150
<i>I had to find people places,
so I could eat,</i>

851
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,153
<i>even though they were
out of my way to do Go Home.</i>

852
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,400
<i>I looked all over town,</i>

853
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,160
<i>but all the good hunting places
were closed.</i>

854
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,876
Wait, is that...

855
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,630
Chicken!

856
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,240
<i>And there it was.</i>

857
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,192
<i>Like they knew I was coming.</i>

858
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,237
Hey! Hey!

859
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,196
Stop the dog!

860
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,720
Hey! Stop that dog!

861
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,512
Get him! I got him! Hey!

862
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,351
Food on the floor is always for the dog!

863
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,840
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

864
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,956
<i>It was delicious.</i>

865
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,430
<i>Big Kitten would have loved it.</i>

866
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,877
Hey, maybe you could use some of this?

867
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,189
Little water there?

868
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
Attagirl.

869
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,596
Attagirl.

870
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,353
Good, baby.

871
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,119
It's all right. Hey.

872
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,359
Yeah, you're beautiful. Yeah.

873
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,119
Hey, what's this here?

874
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,432
Yeah, let's see. Yeah, dog tag.

875
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,954
It's Bella.

876
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,910
Yeah, they gave me a dog tag, too.

877
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
He knew my name.

878
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,470
- Have I seen him before?
- Even without the tags,

879
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,316
they got my biometric data on file.

880
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,516
Come on.

881
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,716
Attagirl.

882
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,635
- No.
- Attagirl.

883
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,320
<i>His name was Axel,</i>

884
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,312
<i>and he always had me on a leash.</i>

885
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,359
- Hi, sweet girl.
- Hi.

886
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,318
You are so sweet.

887
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,954
- Here you go.
- Bye.

888
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,280
Thank you.

889
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,239
Good for business, Bella.

890
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,198
<i>Something about him was familiar.</i>

891
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,990
<i>Axel was sad the way Mack was sad.</i>

892
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,470
<i>The way Mom was sad.</i>

893
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,671
<i>I wanted to go have fun
like I did with the pack,</i>

894
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,992
<i>but Axel didn't understand
that dogs need to play.</i>

895
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,712
Easy, girl.

896
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,914
<i>We kept each other warm.</i>

897
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Good dog.

898
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,436
<i>He made sure I was never hungry.</i>

899
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,597
Good dog, Bella.

900
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,032
<i>Slowly, the air got warmer.</i>

901
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,158
<i>But Axel got sadder and sadder.</i>

902
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,914
<i>I didn't think Axel would ever
take me off the leash.</i>

903
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,152
<i>I didn't like being chained.</i>

904
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,230
<i>It didn't feel right.</i>

905
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,878
<i>I didn't know how to help Axel
and still take care of myself.</i>

906
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,676
<i>I needed to do Go Home.</i>

907
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,194
I love you.

908
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,839
It's just me and you.

909
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,038
You're the only friend I've got.

910
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,032
I love you, Bella.

911
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,839
I love you.

912
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,795
It's you and me, Bella.

913
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,520
You and me.

914
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,196
Bella, I love you.

915
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,556
I love you, Bella.

916
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,756
I love you.

917
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,113
<i>I laid with Axel while the heat
slowly drained away from him,</i>

918
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,715
<i>until there was no more Axel</i>

919
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,440
<i>and he was no longer sad.</i>

920
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,557
<i>I sat, being a good dog,</i>

921
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,996
<i>thinking someone would come for me.</i>

922
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,993
<i>Nobody came.</i>

923
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,031
<i>Being a good dog didn't work.</i>

924
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,632
<i>It was as if the whole world
had forgotten me.</i>

925
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,040
<i>But I couldn't give up.</i>

926
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,479
<i>I was so thirsty.</i>

927
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,710
<i>I needed water.</i>

928
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,036
<i>Okay, Bella, this is very important.</i>

929
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,635
You ready? All right.

930
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,040
Go home.

931
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,232
That's it.

932
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,835
Go home, Bella.

933
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,036
<i>Go home.</i>

934
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,839
Come on, there's a cool path down here.

935
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,718
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

936
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,713
- Hurry up. You're always slow.
- No, I'm not.

937
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,511
Hey, look. A dog.

938
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,240
People.

939
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,477
- What's the matter with it?
- I don't know.

940
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,960
Careful it doesn't have rabies.

941
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,997
Doesn't have rabies, you moron.

942
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,595
It's stuck. Good dog.

943
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,160
Good dog.

944
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,070
It's chained to something.

945
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,791
- What... What is it?
- There's a body over there.

946
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,155
No way.

947
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,317
- The dog's chained to it.
- Is he dead?

948
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,400
I think so.

949
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,796
What are you gonna do?

950
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,800
Good dog.

951
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,192
<i>Water never tasted so good.</i>

952
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,874
<i>I knew now that my journey
was much longer than I'd ever imagined.</i>

953
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,633
<i>Two winters.</i>

954
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,997
<i>How many more winters would there be?</i>

955
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,276
<i>And how many more could I take?</i>

956
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,511
<i>Their smell was everywhere.</i>

957
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,719
<i>They were hunting me again.</i>

958
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,278
<i>I knew they would come.</i>

959
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,559
<i>But I wasn't gonna let them think
I was afraid.</i>

960
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,839
Is that...

961
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,072
It is Big Kitten.

962
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,516
And she's a big, big kitten now.

963
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,597
<i>It felt so good to be together again.</i>

964
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,750
<i>And I could tell
Big Kitten felt the same.</i>

965
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:53,236
<i>I knew Lucas would be excited
to meet Big Kitten.</i>

966
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,438
<i>And we would all
sleep together in the bed.</i>

967
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,149
<i>Lucas was definitely
gonna need a bigger bed.</i>

968
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,474
Now, that's a new smell.

969
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,840
I don't know what those are,
and I don't want to know.

970
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,750
Big Kitten!

971
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,917
There it is.

972
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,310
Go Home and Lucas.

973
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,636
<i>Big Kitten wanted me to follow her,</i>

974
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,759
<i>and I wanted her to follow me.</i>

975
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,878
<i>I knew then that Big Kitten
would not be coming home with me</i>

976
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,030
<i>to sleep on the bed.</i>

977
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,076
I will always be your mother cat.

978
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,519
<i>I loved Big Kitten.</i>

979
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,278
<i>But I knew I would never see her again.</i>

980
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,835
A dog!

981
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,832
Puppy, come here! Come here, puppy!

982
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,270
Come here! Come here, puppy!

983
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,589
- You okay?
- Yeah.

984
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,597
Just stop. Please.

985
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,592
What's happening?

986
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,354
- Come on.
- Please stop.

987
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,840
- Here, boy.
- Come here.

988
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,800
Come here, girl. Come here.

989
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,877
Come here, baby.

990
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,835
<i>It hurt so much,
but I had to keep going.</i>

991
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,438
<i>The streets and the houses
started to look familiar.</i>

992
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,431
<i>I finally did what Lucas told me.</i>

993
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:46,278
<i>I did Go Home.</i>

994
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,912
Lucas! Mom!

995
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,117
- Who's there?
- Lucas!

996
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,752
Okay, you can't be in here. Come on.

997
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,936
Come on. Right, let's go outside.

998
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,475
<i>Everything was different.</i>

999
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,235
Come on. Come on. I'll give you a treat
if you come outside.

1000
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,953
Lucas? Mom?

1001
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,516
Goodness.

1002
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,594
Where were they?

1003
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,952
There's a stray dog
that just pushed its way into my house.

1004
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:28,512
<i>I could smell they had been gone
for a long, long time.</i>

1005
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,038
<i>I tried so hard, and I'd come so far.</i>

1006
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:45,112
<i>I just couldn't take another step.</i>

1007
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,959
Mother Cat?

1008
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,591
How did you get so small?

1009
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,433
- Call about a stray dog?
- I did.

1010
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,920
- You.
- You.

1011
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:25,391
<i>Mother Cat watched me leave,
just like Big Kitten did.</i>

1012
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,996
<i>I guess that's how cats say goodbye.</i>

1013
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,270
<i>There was just one more place
to look for Lucas.</i>

1014
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,673
- That's good.
- Later.

1015
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,111
- See you.
- Bye.

1016
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,558
- Dogs?
- Yeah, that's a good boy.

1017
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,279
I used to be the only one.

1018
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:12,909
- Olivia?
- What?

1019
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,798
I think a stray dog just came through.

1020
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,159
The alarm goes off, I get up.

1021
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,675
I got somewhere to go.

1022
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,000
I like the job.

1023
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,520
No way.

1024
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,640
Can't be.

1025
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,760
Bella?

1026
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,074
It is her! Come here! Come here, girl.

1027
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,074
What happened to you, girl?

1028
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,390
What? What is it?

1029
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,557
- No.
- Lucas?

1030
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,720
It can't be.

1031
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,360
Bella!

1032
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,555
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas!

1033
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:44,679
Bella, Bella! You're alive.

1034
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,155
I can't believe it.

1035
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,351
Bella, where have you been
all this time?

1036
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,955
- Is that Bella?
- Yeah, it is. It really is.

1037
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,040
Bella!

1038
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,555
Oh, my God. It's been
like two and a half years.

1039
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,912
- Hi.
- Lucas! Olivia! Mom!

1040
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,559
I did Go Home!

1041
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,632
- She came home.
- I know, I know.

1042
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,896
Can you call the vet,
tell him we're on the way?

1043
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,320
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'll get the car.

1044
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,280
Lucas? Lucas, there's an officer outside
who says you have to bring that dog out.

1045
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,240
I'm so sorry.

1046
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,680
Come on.

1047
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,720
You kidding?

1048
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,560
All right, everybody.

1049
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,996
No big deal. Nothing to worry about.

1050
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,480
I'm just here for that pit bull.

1051
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,719
And if any of you interfere,

1052
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,755
these officers, they will arrest you.

1053
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,360
We don't want any trouble,

1054
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,560
but we have to take that animal.

1055
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,637
I thought I'd see why
half the department

1056
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,758
is out here on
a routine Animal Control call.

1057
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,433
Anybody want to fill me in?

1058
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,277
Captain, I'm here for a confiscation,
and some of these people,

1059
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,875
they're trying to turn it
into some kind of a situation.

1060
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:06,160
It's obstruction,
harbouring a dangerous animal,

1061
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,072
and disobeying a lawful order.

1062
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,230
Well, which one of you
is responsible for this crime spree?

1063
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,551
I thought it might be
something like that.

1064
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,080
That a pit bull?

1065
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,039
Doesn't look like a pit bull to me.

1066
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,557
She's my dog, sir, and she's hurt.

1067
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,680
I'm taking her to the vet.

1068
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,712
Well, I'm sorry to tell you
that Chuck's right.

1069
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,031
We have to take your dog
in to the shelter.

1070
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,120
All right.

1071
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,696
But to do so, you've got to go through

1072
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,519
the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Division,
United States Marine Corps.

1073
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,080
1st Infantry, Army.

1074
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,755
82nd Airborne Division, U.S. Army.

1075
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,833
6th Fleet, United States Navy.

1076
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,594
101st Airborne, Screaming Eagles.

1077
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,036
4th Infantry Division,
United States Army.

1078
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,793
You really want this thing to escalate?

1079
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,640
Do you?

1080
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:02,037
Ma'am, myjob is to enforce the law,

1081
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,919
and the law says
I've got to impound this dog.

1082
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,356
Now, if that means Tasers
and pepper spray,

1083
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,113
then that's what it means.

1084
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,078
Under Denver city ordinance 8-...

1085
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,355
Wait.

1086
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,040
He said "Denver."

1087
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,280
That's right.

1088
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,755
But this isn't Denver.

1089
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,355
- This is federal property.
- It's what?

1090
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,711
The VA Hospital is federal property.

1091
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,157
It isn't technically a part
of the City of Denver.

1092
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:29,910
So, that's it, Captain.

1093
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,000
There doesn't have to be a fight,
'cause you don't have jurisdiction.

1094
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,271
So, where did you two serve?

1095
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,594
- Basra.
- Kabul.

1096
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,914
Huế, Tet Offensive.

1097
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,756
All right. Show's over.
Let's pack it up.

1098
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,320
Yeah.

1099
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,558
If I see this dog leave the premises,
I will pull your car over.

1100
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,359
No, you won't.

1101
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,115
Chuck, I get more complaints about you

1102
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,511
than all the other ACOs combined.

1103
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,590
Turn that vehicle in.
I'm pulling you out of the field.

1104
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:12,395
And nobody is pulling
anyone over for a dog.

1105
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,069
Got it?

1106
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:16,836
Good.

1107
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,676
Oh, my gosh, Bella,
we missed you so much.

1108
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,678
I don't understand what just happened,

1109
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,269
but I'm pretty sure it was good.

1110
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,680
Look what I found in the chest.

1111
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,320
I totally forgot.

1112
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,198
- Come here.
- Remember this, Bella?

1113
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,431
My Lucas blanket!

1114
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,399
- I wanted to try something.
- Yeah.

1115
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,915
This was her favourite thing
when she was little.

1116
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:58,235
But after all she's been through,
I don't know if she'll remember.

1117
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,630
Bella, do you want...

1118
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,472
- A tiny piece of cheese.
- ...a tiny piece of cheese?

1119
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,030
She does remember.

1120
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:14,592
She's an amazing dog.

1121
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,433
She really is.

1122
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,551
<i>I was really home</i>

1123
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,075
<i>with Lucas, and Olivia, too.</i>

1124
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,518
<i>I was where I needed to be.</i>

1125
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,359
<i>And Big Kitten was where
she needed to be.</i>

1126
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,635
<i>I finally understood</i>

1127
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:17,076
<i>that the invisible leash
that led me to Lucas</i>

1128
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,117
<i>was made of love.</i>

1129
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,476
<i>He was my person.</i>

1130
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,553
<i>And I was his dog.</i>
