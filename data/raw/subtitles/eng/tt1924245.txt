00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,768
I can explain that.

180
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:25,395
No, you needn't.

181
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,774
You think you're the first
my ex-husband sent?

182
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:29,858
[scoffs]

183
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,529
The first one is in jail.

184
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,948
Beastly man
with no manners.

185
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,409
The second
was more amiable.

186
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:43,956
Couldn't find Rafo and left.

187
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,377
Tell me, cowboy,

188
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,880
why does his father
really want him now?

189
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,758
He has no real love
for the boy.

190
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:58,095
Well, maybe he's trying
to change all that.

191
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:01,765
You're picturing
some innocent kid.

192
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:04,768
[chuckles]
Like in that photo.

193
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,103
A nice, respectful boy

194
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,730
who wears clean clothes
to school,

195
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,525
and sings in church.
[chuckles]

196
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:15,529
I guarantee you
that isn't the case.

197
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,408
My son is wild.

198
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,494
An animal
who lives in the gutter.

199
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:27,249
Gambling, stealing,
cockfighting, at the...

200
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,294
At the <i>calle Choca.</i>

201
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,798
Take him.

202
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:37,175
Take him
if you can find him.

203
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,928
He's a monster.

204
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,434
You have made a long trip
for nothing.

205
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,440
I don't know
where my son is now.

206
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,775
He's like his father.

207
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,194
He runs away.

208
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,406
He hates his father.

209
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,325
He hates me.

210
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,121
So, go home, Mr. Mike.

211
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:08,707
Go home.

212
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,419
When did you give up?

213
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,341
No matter what people say,

214
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,927
some aren't cut out
to be parents.

215
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:27,726
Have a drink with me, hmm?

216
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,852
[snaps fingers]

217
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,940
- [bottle cap opens]
- [glass clinks]

218
00:15:33,023 --> 00:15:34,107
[drink pours]

219
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,197
No, I got a job to do.

220
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:45,744
Well, then, good luck.
You'll need it.

221
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:49,915
[footsteps receding]

222
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,056
[indistinct chatter
in Spanish]

223
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,393
[lively music playing]

224
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,311
[speaks Spanish]

225
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,315
[people cheering in distance]

226
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,823
[indistinct chatter
in Spanish]

227
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,204
[chicken clucking]

228
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,791
Hey, Rafo.

229
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,054
[crowd continues cheering]

230
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,266
[chickens clucking]

231
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,732
[police sirens blaring]

232
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,108
[officer speaking Spanish
over loudspeaker]

233
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,276
[in English] Oh, shit!

234
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:01,528
Shit, shit.

235
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,907
[clamoring]

236
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,254
[car engine starts]

237
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,630
[police siren chirps faintly]

238
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,633
[car drives away]

239
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,271
Hey, Rafo,
you can come out now.

240
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,731
The cops are gone.

241
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,443
Where the hell are you?

242
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,450
You can come out now.

243
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,368
I'm a friend of the family.

244
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,454
[clucking]

245
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,957
Okay. Come on.

246
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,667
Come here.

247
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,212
Hey, hey, come on.

248
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:02,547
Chicken... [mutters]

249
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,841
Bad chicken.
No, no! Hey, hey!

250
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,967
Ah.

251
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,347
All right,
you little bastard.

252
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,057
Come on out.

253
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,310
I'm gonna count to five.

254
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,687
I'm gonna
wring this chicken's neck.

255
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:20,190
You got that?

256
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,317
One.

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,735
Two.

258
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,237
Three.

259
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,696
Four.

260
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,907
- Give me my rooster!
- Five.

261
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,701
Not until we talk, Rafo.

262
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,036
You know my name?

263
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,205
How did you find me?

264
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,124
I found you
because your mother told me

265
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,000
where you were.
That's why.

266
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,629
If she sold me to you,
you're a fool.

267
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:45,215
Touch me and I'll kick
your ass, old man.

268
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,883
What the hell
you talking about?

269
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,094
You are some perverted friend
of my mother

270
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,138
from one of her parties.

271
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:53,014
Perverted old man.

272
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,351
Hey. You're talking
to the wrong person.

273
00:18:56,434 --> 00:19:00,021
I'm here representing your dad
who wants to see you.

274
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,399
Howard Polk.

275
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,528
I work for him, that's all.

276
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,489
You are a cowboy?
A ranch hand?

277
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,575
Yeah.

278
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:15,078
That's right.
I've done a little of that.

279
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:18,290
Okay, talk.

280
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,167
Not here.

281
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,502
Not here.

282
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,886
You're joking, yes?

283
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,305
No, not joking.

284
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,849
My father, he wants me.

285
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,809
Well, you're his only kid.

286
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,270
[scoffs]
And he sent you for me?

287
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,438
Yep.

288
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,564
You're a liar.

289
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,400
My father hasn't seen me
for years.

290
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,652
Why does he want
to see me now?

291
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,238
Well, he wants to see you,
that's all.

292
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,616
He, uh... He misses you.

293
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:54,284
[scoffs, chuckles]

294
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,036
You're full of shit.

295
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,412
My father doesn't want me.

296
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,164
He never even called
on my birthdays.

297
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,290
Look at that.

298
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,461
It's me when I was little.

299
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,755
Yeah, that's it.

300
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,173
Same guy.

301
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,425
He gave you that?

302
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,509
He did.

303
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:17,432
If my father wants me back,
why didn't he telephone?

304
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,060
He sent you,
some <i>apestoso viejo.</i>

305
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:23,897
I don't know what that means,
but I don't like it.

306
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,273
When I was little,

307
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,901
my father said he would
give me a special horse.

308
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,197
He never did.

309
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,283
He's a liar.

310
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,285
Eh, just a little late,
that's all.

311
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,120
That doesn't mean he's a liar.

312
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,581
But he's gonna
make it up to you now.

313
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,166
He's got a big ranch.

314
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,001
He's got horses, cattle.

315
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,628
In fact,
he's got hundreds of horses.

316
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:49,005
You'll be able
to ride yourself silly.

317
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:51,007
- Hundreds of horses?
- Yeah.

318
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,551
Even owns a rodeo up there.

319
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,304
Rodeo?

320
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,973
Hundreds of horses...

321
00:20:58,598 --> 00:20:59,975
He's a big boss!

322
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,936
Yeah, he's a big boss.
That's what I'm telling you.

323
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,020
Maybe I'll go.

324
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:05,146
- Just for a while.
- Yeah.

325
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,815
Good. Good, I think so.

326
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,525
If I don't like it,
I will say,

327
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,818
"To hell with him,"
and come back.

328
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,278
Yeah, that's right.

329
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,613
If you don't like it,
to hell with it.

330
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,700
Okay. Deal.

331
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,118
I can bring my rooster?

332
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,453
Yeah. I don't see why not.

333
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,706
Hey, Macho, come.

334
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,167
Where ya going?

335
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,669
I have to get my things.

336
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,671
No, stay here.

337
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,256
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

338
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:33,925
Shit.

339
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,952
[rain pattering]

340
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:05,790

00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:10,045
[humming]

342
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,883
[in English] What can I say?

343
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,844
I can't believe it.

344
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,722
Where did you find him?

345
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:23,558
Right where you said.

346
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,560
At the cock fights.

347
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,062
[scoffs]

348
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,439
And where is he?

349
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,233
He said he was gonna go out
and get his stuff.

350
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,401
[laughs]

351
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,070
You poor fool.

352
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,237
[speaking Spanish]

353
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,574
- [Mike in English] Yeah.
- [laughing]

354
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,201
- Ah.
- [Mike] Well...

355
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:43,119
This time...

356
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:45,955
This time
you'll have a drink with me.

357
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:56,716
Ah... you really thought
Rafo would go with you, hmm?

358
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,719
Mm, maybe he will.

359
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:03,807
[snaps fingers]

360
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:06,976
Here.

Cheers.

362

Hmm. Come. Let's celebrate.

[Mike] Hmm.

364
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:29,499
Tell me something...

365
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,799
What are we celebrating?

366
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,052
Anything.

367

[sets glass down]

368
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,431

Uh...

373
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,403
I, uh...

374
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,614
- I don't know.
- [sets glass down]

375
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:05,160
I think I better
get the hell out of here.

376
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,538
Otherwise, this job
ain't gonna be finished.

377
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,457
You dare...

378
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,168
You dare insult me
in my own home?

379
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,544
No, I didn't mean
to insult you.

380
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,546
- I just...
- [Leta speaking Spanish]

381
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:17,964
[in English] Okay.

382
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,674
Hey.

383
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:22,719
You think I'm a whore?
Is that what you think?

384
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:27,348
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Don't go!

385
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:31,019
One more step
and you're finished.

386
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,271
I'll call the <i>Federales</i>
right now.

387
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:34,606
Give them your name,

388
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,524
and you'll be arrested
for kidnapping.

389
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,985
{\an5}And spend the rest of your
life in a Mexican prison.

390
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,196
How do you like that?

391
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,364
You don't like that, do you?

392
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:47,285
Rafo is mine.

393
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:50,121
He's mine and he stays.

394
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,498
You understand?

395
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:55,627
He's my property,
and nobody takes my property.

396
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,879
His father ran away from us.

397
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:01,883
He had his chance,
but he left us here.

398
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:04,636
He left him with me.

399
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,347
You have exactly five minutes

400
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,224
to get in your vehicle
and leave Mexico City.

401
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,808
Do we understand each other?

402
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:12,435
Get out.

403
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,230
Get out now.

404
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:18,608
- [Aurelio] Lucas.
- [Leta] Take him out.

405
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,026
[Lucas and Aurelio

[in English] Okay.

Hello, <i>gringo.</i>

Get out.

416

Get out.

- Get out.
- What?

419
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,225
Get out, I said.

420
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,020
What?

421
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:38,855

- Says me. Says your mother.

{\an5}- I'm going with you.
- No, you're not going with me.

426

I said I am going.

427
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:51,659
You're staying.

428
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,286
If you go without me,
do you know what I'll do?

429
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,330
- What'll you do?
- I'll go to the police.

430
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,623
- Yeah?
- Not here.

431
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,499
In the next town
where they don't know me.

432
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,085
I'll go to the <i>Federales</i>
and I'll tell them

433
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,922
I was raped by a dirty <i>gringo</i>
in a truck from Texas.

434
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,841
You're sick.
What are you gonna do

435
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,343
when they get you
to the hospital

436
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,345
and the doc wants to shove
his hand up your ass

437
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,013
to give you an examination?

438

Not so good, huh, sonny?

439
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,268
Get your ass out of here.
Jesus! Hit the highway.

440
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:20,229
Then, I'll walk
like a cripple. Like this...

441
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:24,901
And I'll say your truck,
you hit me and run away.

Jesus Christ.

443
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,572
I'll tell them that this thing

444
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:31,783
is not yours.

445
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,326

We go and I tell you, okay?

Look, the only place
you're gonna go

454
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,771
is the hospital.

455
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:03,815
Now give me
the goddamn wallet.

I give your wallet,

Then I get across by myself.

tie his leg back down there
so it doesn't...

476
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:16,053
I don't want him crapping
on the upholstery here.

477
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,180
No.

478
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,639
What do you mean, "no"?

479
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,350
No, and he's not a chicken.
His name is Macho.

480
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,103
I don't care if his name
is Colonel Sanders.

481
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:25,980
Just get his ass back there.

482
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,064
He's Macho.

483
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,316
You know what it means,
"macho"?

484
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,525
It means "strong."

485
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,486
Come on, Macho.

486
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,070
Yeah.

So...

00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:01,474
I'll make a deal with you.

Yeah? What kind of a deal?

496
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,603
If Macho sits with us,

497
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:06,771
when he fights,

498
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:09,357
I'll give you half
of the money.

499
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,028
The day Macho sits up here
is the day I barbecue his ass.

500
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,199
It's not good for his spirit.

501
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:23,412
Well, I'm really worried
about that.

502
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:27,458
But he's strong now.

503
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,627
When I first find him,

504
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,046
he'd lose every fight.

505
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,173
He was on the ground.

506
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:35,967
His leg broke.

507
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,638
So, I took care of him,
and I said,

508
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,600
"Stand up, you bastard.
Fight!"

509
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,979
He killed a very big rooster.

510
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:50,439
From that time,

511
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:53,317
he's Macho.

512
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,027
A champion.

513
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,737
That's the most
exciting thing

00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:08,791
Yeah.

'Cause we can sleep out here

What?

523
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,680
Like

524
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,683
when I fall asleep,
you'll drive away without me.

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,311
Yeah.

I'm not gonna run away
without you, kid.

527
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:33,065
Just go to sleep.

What's the matter
with this guy?

529
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,779
He's got something
on his eye here.

530
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,489
Got something in right here.

Go ahead.

No. No, <i>veterinario.</i>

Yeah, rodeo.

541
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:04,180
Working on ranches

542
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:08,142
and working with horses
and stuff especially.

543
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,728
Well, so I think
he'll be fine.

544
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:14,440
Macho. His name is Macho.

545
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:16,943
Whatever.

546
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,778
What's wrong with that?

547
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:19,987
Nothing.

548
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,865
Guy wants to name
his cock "Macho"...

549
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:25,368
[chuckles] It's okay by me.

550
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:29,538
He's macho, like me.

551
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,248
Very strong rooster.

552
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:32,708
Everyone wants him.

553
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,002
One even stole him from me.

554
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:39,048
Yeah, your mother says you've
stolen a few things yourself.

555
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,758
Cars and such.

556
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:44,011
When we get up in the States,
you touch a man's vehicle,

557
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,389
that doesn't go over.

558
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:50,101
Yeah. I'll remember
when we get to Texas.

559
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:51,769
Especially in Texas.

560
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:56,273
{\an5}And you can watch all that
"macho" crap up there too.

561
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,484
Nobody likes that stuff.

562
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,707
How'd you get the bruises?

563
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:18,713
Being on the street
cause all that?

564
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,340
Sometimes.

565
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:27,722
{\an5}And sometimes when I go
home, it's worse.

566
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,975
That's why I stay
on the streets.

567
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,227
All the bad stuff
happens at home.

568
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:39,859
My mom hates me.

569
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,655
You want to know why?

570
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,365
Not really.

571
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:50,411
She bring home
a strange man today,

572
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:52,913
another strange man tomorrow,

573
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,541
and she said
I should call them "Uncle."

574
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:58,085
And I say to her,

575
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,337
"How many men
can I call 'Uncle'?"

576
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:04,008
So, she hates me.

577
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:06,802
And Aurelio,

578
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,472
he was in prison.

579
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:13,517
Sometimes he sells drugs
and brings her pills and dope.

580
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:18,272
One time I spit on him.

581
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,900
He hits me
to teach me manners

582
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,402
and I said to him...

583
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,988
[swears in Spanish]

584
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,615
[in English]
"Don't teach me manners

585
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:31,160
{\an5}when you're in bed with my
mom, where she sleep."

586
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:34,455
So, I say, to hell with that.

587
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:37,500
I make a few pesos
with Macho for myself

588
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,378
and I do what I want.

589
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,548
On the street,

590
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,300
I trust no one.

591
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,678
But it's safer than at home.

592
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,481
You can never trust no one.
[sobbing softly]

593
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,363
[breathes shakily]

594
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,244
[blowing raspberries]

595
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,540
[Mike sighs]

596
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,635
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

597
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,102
[Mike] We're gonna take

598
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:40,062
a little bit
of a different route here.

599
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,024
- <i>Federales</i> are there.
- Oh, shit.

600
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,943
We gotta go down this road.

601
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:47,278
[Rafo] What do they want?

602
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:49,155
[Mike] Well, they probably
wanted you.

603
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:51,991
We'll stay away from them.

604
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,534
What are we doing?

605
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:56,996
We go off,
take this road here.

606
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,081
All the way around,

607
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:00,291
and we won't have to deal
with them.

608
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:03,127
No good.
It's bump, bump, bump.

609
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,256
Bit more like
jail, jail, jail.

610
00:36:20,436 --> 00:36:22,354
- Hi.
- [Macho clucking]

611
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:25,900
{\an5}We brought our own red
rooster with us, see?

612
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,568
In your honor.

613
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:28,777
<i>Gracias.</i>

614
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:32,406
Uh, I'm gonna have
a <i>cerveza blanca</i>

615
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,782
and he'll have a...

616
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:36,410
[conversing in Spanish]

617
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,373
[in English] What's Amarillo?

618
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:44,960
Uh, nothing.
Just something I drink.

619
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,921
Oh, okay.

620
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:50,507
[Rafo] <i>Gracias.</i>

621
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,678
It's tequila.

622
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,890
- Tequila.
- Yeah.

623
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,142
You're not gonna drink
any tequila.

624
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:01,769
But I want it.

625
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,646
{\an5}I don't care.
You're not gonna drink it, not with me.

626
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:05,189
[speaks Spanish]

627
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,149
[in English] I drink tequila
once and I never got sick.

628
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,485
{\an5}Yeah, well, when you're with your
dad, up above the border,

629
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:10,945
you can drink battery acid,

630
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,197
but you're not gonna
drink tequila with me.

631
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,407
An Orange Crush, <i>por favor.</i>

632
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,328
Yeah, that's better.

633
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:22,957
I'll be back.

634
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,124
Where are you going?

635
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,584
[Mike] Make a little call.

00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,599
Yeah, hello.

639
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:42,476
I found the boy.

640
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,644
Yes!

641
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:46,480
Shit, that's great!
That's great!

642
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:47,773
<i>It wasn't easy,</i>

643
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:49,817
but I found him
and we're on our way.

644
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,069
Not without bumps,
but we're on our way.

645
00:37:52,152 --> 00:37:53,862
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

646
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:55,197
I knew you'd find him.

647
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,199
I knew I did the right thing
sending you.

648
00:37:57,283 --> 00:38:01,036
{\an5}Not like those other two
guys you sent down here.

649
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,330
<i>Thanks a lot for that.</i>

650
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,916
I'm gonna be calling you
along the way

651
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,794
{\an5}<i>and you'll be playing it straight with
me, understand?</i>

652
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:11,297
Okay. All right.

653
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,341
Just get him
back up here, okay?

654
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,427
- <i>You've got it.</i>
- All right.

655
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,656
Kinda glowing there, kid.

656
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:47,166
- Ah. Fine Mexican beer.
- [chuckles]

657
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,002
Can I wear your hat?

00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:53,630
No.

659
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:55,716
Why not?

660
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,885
Because it's a cowboy hat.

661
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,763
And you're not a cowboy.

662
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:03,724
Anything a <i>gringo</i> cowboy
can do with horses,

663
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,726

Well, you're
in bad shape, then,

- [breathes heavily]
- What do you think, kid?

You think I'm a <i>gringo?</i>

669
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:25,746
Yeah.

670
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:31,043
Do you think
I'm like my father?

671
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,462
A coward?

I'm like my mom?

I don't know.
I don't know your mom.

Here, kid. Try the hat...

He's not your son.
He's not yours to take.

always laugh at us <i>gringos</i>

on your dirty water.

It's not the water

Anyway...

he saved my ass.

He's a deputy.

01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:21,980
{\an5}[Mike] I told you it was
gonna take a little while.

1079
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,649
I heard that already.

1080
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,068
Just keep telling him
what he wants to hear.

1081
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:27,611
- Who?
- [Howard] <i>"Who?"</i>

1082
01:08:27,694 --> 01:08:30,364
The kid. Rafael.

1083
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,491
Just keep him happy,

1084
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:33,826
and whatever you do,

1085
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,494
do not let his mother
get a hold of him.

1086
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,913
<i>Or her lawyers
will never respond.</i>

1087
01:08:37,996 --> 01:08:39,331
Respond to what?

1088
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:41,083
[Howard] <i>It's a business thing.</i>

1089
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,668
A few years ago,
down there in Mexico,

1090
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,920
I invested in some property
in her name

1091
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:47,172
to avoid their goddamn taxes,

1092
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,925
and now those investments
have matured.

1093
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:52,177
So I want the return
on my investment.

1094
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,679
[Mike] Just like the kid.

1095
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,722
{\an5}[Howard] <i>Well, yeah, okay.
So, you get it.</i>

1096
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:56,932
[Mike] Mm-hmm.

1097
01:08:57,015 --> 01:08:59,184
I get it.
You played me, you bastard.

1098
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,519
I didn't play you.

1099
01:09:00,602 --> 01:09:02,855
What are you,
eight years old, Mike?

1100
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,481
Jesus!

1101
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:06,900
If I have something
she wants,

1102
01:09:06,984 --> 01:09:09,069
<i>maybe she'll negotiate.</i>

1103
01:09:09,153 --> 01:09:11,488
Christ, I'm a reasonable man.

1104
01:09:11,572 --> 01:09:13,866
I'm just asking for my half.

1105
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:16,702
This kid would be better off
without either one of you.

1106
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,120
Well, you know what?

1107
01:09:18,203 --> 01:09:19,538
It doesn't make a shit
what you think, Mike.

1108
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,373
I'm his father

1109
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,251
and I actually
want him back.

1110
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:28,088
<i>This isn't all about
the money, okay?</i>

1111
01:09:28,172 --> 01:09:29,756
The kid's my son.

1112
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,176
So, please...

1113
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:36,054
Please, can you stick
to the plan?

1114
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,015
Just meet me at the border
with him.

1115
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:40,726
Yeah.

1116
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:45,522
[indistinct chatter]

1117
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,201
Was that my father?

1118
01:09:57,284 --> 01:09:58,577
Yeah, it was, kid.

1119
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,287
[Rafo] Did he say anything
about me?

1120
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,914
Ask how I am?

1121
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:05,292
Well, he did, yeah. He...
He wants the best for ya.

1122
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,586
- He does?
- [Mike] Yeah.

1123
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:10,130
He still wants me?
He still wants me to come?

1124
01:10:10,214 --> 01:10:12,549
'Course he does, kid.
Why wouldn't he?

1125
01:10:16,303 --> 01:10:17,554
[horse snorting]

1126
01:10:17,638 --> 01:10:19,932
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Give me that.

1127
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:23,435
Okay, come on, there.

1128
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:24,811
Right through there.

1129
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:27,648
Stick your head in there,
and put it on up here.

1130
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,026
Put this here. Okay.

1131
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,320
We got him.

1132
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:35,989
Now, that was the easy part.

1133
01:10:36,073 --> 01:10:38,325
- That was the easy part?
- [Mike] Yeah.

1134
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:41,453
Next, they don't like it
when you cinch the girth.

1135
01:10:42,454 --> 01:10:43,872
It's just like this.

1136
01:10:43,956 --> 01:10:45,916
You just have to pull,
cinch it up.

1137
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:47,125
You can do it.

1138
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,794
- You wanna try it?
- [Rafo] Okay.

1139
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,964
{\an5}Just cinch it up, and put up half of...
An eighth of it.

1140
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,968
- [horse whinnies]
- [Rafo] Whoa! Whoa.

1141
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:58,971
Whoa.

1142
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,722
Whoa! He's so wild.

1143
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:03,350
[Mike] Okay, yeah.
Take it easy.

1144
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:05,185
[soothingly] Hey, hey. Hey.

1145
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:15,153
How did you do that?

1146
01:11:15,946 --> 01:11:17,864
We did it, partner.

1147
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:19,157
We did it.

1148
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,459
[birds chirping]

1149
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:38,468
[Marta speaking Spanish]

1150
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:40,595
[Rafo] <i>Buenos dias.</i>

[Rafo in English] Sleep well?

1153
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,017
I did, yeah. I did.

1154
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,101
Thank you.

1155
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:59,698
{\an5}Uh, Marta says we can stay in
the <i>casita</i> behind her house

1156
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:01,241
while we are here.

1157
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:03,201
No.

1158
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,037
We can't do that.
Can't do that.

1159
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,497
We've already
imposed on her enough.

1160
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:08,582
Well...

1161
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:11,585

Uh...

1164
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:27,893
[in English]
She said it's her choice.

1165
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,311
- And she already...
- Right.

1166
01:12:29,394 --> 01:12:30,604
...cleaned it out for us.

1167
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:32,314
Plus, she says
we can't keep sleeping

1168
01:12:32,397 --> 01:12:34,232
in the shrine
of the <i>Virgen Maria.</i>

1169
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:36,735
It's not a hotel.

1170
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:40,197
I know.
I'm fighting a losing battle.

1171
01:12:41,948 --> 01:12:43,241
[Mike] Okay.

1172
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,910
[Rafo] It's good or it's no?

1173
01:12:45,786 --> 01:12:47,120
[Mike] It's no.

1174
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,248
But what do we do
when we leave?

1175
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,710
We get ourselves another car,
that's what we do.

1176

[in English] Cook?

1180
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,252
Yeah. Well, you're always
cooking all the time.

1181
01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:36,878
I thought
I would do it for you.

1182
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:39,506
- [Marta chuckles]
- And cowboys always cook.

1183
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:41,299
It's kind of our deal.

1184
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:47,180
Okay.

1185
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:49,641

I think she likes you.

1195

Just keep
your big mouth shut.

1196

[in English]
More money to come.

1202

what to tell you.

tell you about this gal.

Yeah, what do you say?

1213
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:25,153
You just need to lose
a little weight, that's all.

1214
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:34,579
You take it easy,
just a little more water.

1215
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,624
Little more water
and less food.

what's your business?

1219
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,395
Do you have a, uh, <i>licencia?</i>

1220
01:15:58,478 --> 01:15:59,980
Well, these people want me

1221
01:16:00,063 --> 01:16:02,607
to take care
of some of their animals.

1222
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,318

I have a knack with that.

01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:16,538

He said, help the dog,

1225
01:16:16,621 --> 01:16:18,039
or his wife
will be very angry.

1226
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:19,249
Yeah?

1227
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:20,292
He said it's not good
when she's angry.

1228
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,459
She'll be angry?

1229
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,461
- Not for you either.
- [Mike] Hmm.

1230
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,965

Looks pretty good.

1234

I don't know
how to cure "old."

1235
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:41,688
{\an5}I don't know.
But no way am I telling her that.

1236
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,940
Hmm. Well...

1237
01:16:44,024 --> 01:16:46,443
I think the dog
just needs a lot of rest.

1238
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:49,571
Maybe he should sleep
with you tonight.

1239

- On the end of the bed.

Doesn't want me?

- Your dad will be there.

Yeah, for the time being,
anyway.

Look, kid,

1338
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:30,007
{\an5}there's something I didn't
tell you the other day

1339

when we talked.

1340
01:25:31,467 --> 01:25:33,219
It's about your dad.

1341
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,763
Yeah, I mean,

1342
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:37,557
{\an5}he wants you to come be
with him and everything,

1343
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,891
but there's another reason.

1344
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:40,434
And that's 'cause
your mother and he

1345
01:25:40,518 --> 01:25:42,270
have some investments
together.

1346
01:25:42,353 --> 01:25:45,439
{\an5}And he thinks if you're
with him up in Texas,

that she'll give him half
of all the investments.

That's all true.
He has all that.

to both of us.

1427
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,884
And... So, quit bitching, huh?

1428
01:30:23,968 --> 01:30:26,053
You're both goddamn liars.

1429
01:30:35,938 --> 01:30:36,981
[Mike] Okay.

1430
01:30:39,608 --> 01:30:40,651
[Mike grunts]

1431
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:42,570
Okay.

1432
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:48,325
Freedom's just on the other
side of this hill, kid.

1433
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:51,579
Let's go.

1434
01:30:54,373 --> 01:30:55,416
Let's go.

1435
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,209
[car engine starts]

1436
01:31:12,975 --> 01:31:14,685
You used to be tough.

1437
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,980
Now you're weak.

1438
01:31:19,398 --> 01:31:23,402
You used to ride bulls,
ride horses.

1439
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:25,821
You were something.

1440
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:28,365
I was something.

1441
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:31,327
You used to be strong.

1442
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,329
Macho.

1443
01:31:36,165 --> 01:31:37,625
Now you're nothing.

1444
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:39,460
Yeah.

1445
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:44,298
Well, I used to be
a lot of things,

1446
01:31:44,381 --> 01:31:46,342
but I'm not now.

1447
01:31:46,425 --> 01:31:48,928
And I'll tell you something.

1448
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:51,680
This macho thing
is overrated.

1449
01:31:51,764 --> 01:31:53,766
Works perfect for him,

1450
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,852
but it's overrated.

1451
01:31:56,936 --> 01:32:00,105
Just people
trying to be macho

1452
01:32:00,189 --> 01:32:02,775
to show that
they've got grit.

1453
01:32:02,858 --> 01:32:05,694
That's about
all they end up with.

1454
01:32:05,778 --> 01:32:08,489
{\an5}And you sit there and let
a bull step all over you,

1455
01:32:08,572 --> 01:32:11,909
and you let a horse throw you
50 feet in the air.

1456
01:32:12,743 --> 01:32:14,078
What an idiot.

1457
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:17,289
Only an idiot would be
in a profession like that.

1458
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:19,708
It's just...

1459
01:32:20,793 --> 01:32:22,211
It's like anything else
in life.

1460
01:32:22,294 --> 01:32:24,421
You think
you got all the answers,

1461
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:25,839
then you realize
as you get old,

1462
01:32:25,923 --> 01:32:27,800
that you don't have
any of 'em.

1463
01:32:29,843 --> 01:32:33,138
{\an5}By the time you figure it
out, it's too late.

1464

Your dad's a good man.

1465
01:32:43,107 --> 01:32:45,818
We all have to make choices
in life, kid.

1466
01:32:46,819 --> 01:32:49,113
You have to make yours.

1467
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:50,823
Where do you want to go?

1468
01:32:54,326 --> 01:32:56,203
I made my choice, Mike.

1469
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,331

Rafo,

I don't want
to hurt your grandpa,

1477
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:29,612

1478
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,405

1486
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:20,454
So, what do you think
about Macho now?

1487
01:34:20,537 --> 01:34:22,122
I think a lot about him.

1488
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:26,251
I think he handled everything
just beautifully back there.

1489
01:34:26,335 --> 01:34:27,628
Yeah, he's amazing.

1490
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:29,213
The real deal.

1491
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:30,297
Yeah.

1492
01:35:03,956 --> 01:35:04,998
[Mike] Huh.

1493
01:35:07,584 --> 01:35:09,294
Thank you, Mike.

1494
01:35:11,004 --> 01:35:13,424
You're welcome, kid.

1495
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,884
You take care
of that chicken, huh?

1496
01:35:18,011 --> 01:35:19,555
He's not a chicken.

1497
01:35:20,597 --> 01:35:21,974
He's Macho.

1498
01:35:28,188 --> 01:35:29,231
He's yours now.

1499
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:31,191
You're sure?

I'll take care of him.

1504
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:49,209
And you take care, kid.

1505
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:53,797
You take care.
You know where we are.
