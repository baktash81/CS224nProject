1
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,875
AMAZON PRESENTS

2
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,666
-So?
-What?

3
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,875
-Was he there?
-Who?

4
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,208
-Farid, of course!
-Oh, Farid!

5
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,250
Yeah... He wasn't there.

6
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,791
That's telling, isn't it?
The guy's avoiding me.

7
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,125
He usually closes the bar

8
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,458
-and now, he's nowhere to be seen.
-Yeah.

9
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
I'll scan the bar one last time.

10
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,875
Maybe he snuck in while we were chatting.

11
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,625
He probably missed us.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,916
Maybe.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,625
-I'll go check. Okay?
-Sure.

14
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,625
-Hurry up, where were you?
-Looking for Farid.

15
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,250
This is where the action is.

16
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,250
What's this?

17
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,916
The bartender noticed
I'm not wearing a bra.

18
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,416
You like vodka?
My own creation, on the house.

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,708
Fair trade and a dash of cranberry,
you'll see.

20
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,041
Try this.

21
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,875
Let me know what you think.

22
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,125
You tell me what you think.

23
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,416
I haven't had a crush on a guy
with a beard in a while.

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,250
Sure, a whole week, right?

25
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,583
Whatever, he was a religious Jew.

26
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,791
I like them.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,166
What the hell?

28
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,541
That is fucking disgusting!

29
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,125
This is what fair trade is?

30
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,708
I'd rather have the gluten.

31
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,916
That's terrible.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,625
-I like it.
-I don't know her.

33
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,666
It's surprising.

34
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,750
Should I send him a text?
Last one. Then it's over.

35
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,333
-Come on.
-To who?

36
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,041
"To who?" Seriously?

37
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,833
To Farid of course, damn it!
You ask that every time.

38
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,791
-To Farid!
-You should drop it.

39
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,583
-There's no point.
-You should stop.

40
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,291
Maybe he's, like, in Syria.

41
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,541
Maybe he's been radicalized
and left to join ISIS.

42
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,000
He's raising goats now.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,541
-Maybe. Come on.
-When was he last online?

44
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,958
Come on, bottoms up!

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,583
Keep it in, come on. Open your diaphragm.

46
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,250
It's definitely not my night.

47
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:57,000
You know, I don't think
you're hitting the right girls.

48
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,708
Really? I've tried all of them.

49
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,500
That's true.

50
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,208
Look, we're gonna go.
We're gonna fly, 'cause...

51
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,083
We've got stuff to talk about. Good night.

52
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,208
Yeah. Use protection!

53
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,083
-I don't see them together.
-No?

54
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,416
-We're not gonna sleep.
-Not here.

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,791
-Really?
-Sleep is out of the question.

56
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,750
Oh, yes... It's just...

57
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:46,958
-No.
-I see.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,916
Well... It's pretty simple... It's...

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,500
I... I took in

60
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,000
this woman who is from...

61
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,875
Wokandia.

62
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,583
I had no idea she would be up,
or I would've...

63
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,000
I would've told you.

64
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,875
And he's also...

65
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:10,708
I'm working with a hosting organization
for refugees.

66
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,791
Mommy!

67
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,250
"Mommy"? That's cute.

68
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,750
Why is he calling me mom? He's confused.

69
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,916
That's the risk when you do this,
they get attached.

70
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,708
When I heard his story,
I was completely...

71
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,458
speechless. It was horrible.
He was found in a vegetable box,

72
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,000
his family has been radicalized...

73
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,833
Well, I'm gonna go.

74
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,041
Yes.

75
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,041
I started at 9:00, so if you can pay me...

76
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,416
Your French has improved.

77
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,375
And so fast!

78
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,583
-It's crazy. Was it 50?
-70.

79
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,083
Seventy.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,833
Okay...

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,791
Well, all of this, I don't...
I'm gonna go. It's better.

82
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,333
No. I'll do things you've never tried.

83
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,458
No one complained.

84
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,375
-Let me...
-No, really. I'll call you.

85
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,708
-I have your number.
-You will? When?

86
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,166
-Soon.
-Okay.

87
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,041
Mommy.

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,625
What are you doing?

89
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,166
Sorry, sweetie. Don't listen to Mom.
It's just...

90
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,708
Sometimes, Mommy would like to hold

91
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,500
someone with more body hair.

92
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,125
But you're the man of my life.

93
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,583
Farid!

94
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,083
Nour. How's it going?

95
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:46,250
-Nour, this is Chloé. Chloé, this is Nour.
-Hi.

96
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,333
How are you?

97
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,500
Nour's an old friend of mine.

98
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,208
-Yeah?
-Yes, she is...

99
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,291
She works at my old gym.

100
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,125
-That's where we met.
-Great!

101
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,625
I should go back to the gym.

102
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,208
-I'm all flabby now.
-Of course not!

103
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:05,333
-You look great.
-Let her come.

104
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,166
Let people work out.

105
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,083
Is it nearby?

106
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,041
-Yeah.
-No.

107
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,416
It's kinda far.

108
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,333
No, it's really close by.

109
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:16,833
You should come by.
Ask for Nour and I'll be there.

110
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,916
Nour will be there. She's always...

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,083
Really.

112
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
You should come, it'd be nice.

113
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,666
-I'll come by.
-That's very nice.

114
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,750
-My pleasure.
-Thanks.

115
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:32,166
Well... I'm so...
I'm so happy to see you again, Farid.

116
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,708
-He had disappeared on us.
-Oh, really?

117
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,458
We didn't know where he was.

118
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,916
Now I know why.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,750
I was keeping a low profile.

120
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,291
Well, I'm feeling like... I'm so relieved.

121
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,041
-I'll see you Monday.
-Yeah.

122
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,916
-See you.
-I'll see you around.

123
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,500
-Bye.
-Bye.

124
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,291
She's nice! I have to go.

125
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,625
-See you later.
-Yeah.

126
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,208
You're always joking around.

127
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,958
I... I'm going this way.

128
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,791
What about my texts?

129
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,708
Your texts?

130
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,625
Well, okay...

131
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,541
Look, Nour...

132
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,583
I'm... I'm gonna be honest, okay?

133
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,416
Please, don't take this the wrong way.

134
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,166
I loved going out with you.
Everything we shared together.

135
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,083
Really. You're a good person.
You're great.

136
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
We had a lot of laughs together.

137
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,333
Really. Too much, actually.

138
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,083
My buddies would say, "Where's Nour?
Call her. She's so funny."

139
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,375
I don't want to go out with someone
who's like my buddy, you see?

140
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,208
I'd like to be with a girl
who's more like a...

141
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,833
girl. A girl, like...

142
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,000
A girl.

143
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,458
I just...

144
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,541
No!

145
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,083
-Stop whining, cheerleader!
-Good one!

146
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,041
She's alone. Tackle her!

147
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:35,125
Told you I'd score twice.

148
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,291
Get on her!

149
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,875
Stop that now! You're pissing me off!

150
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,791
I'm crazy. You know what?
I'm gonna drink your blood.

151
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,125
I'll eat you for breakfast,
then break your balls.

152
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,708
You've lost, man!

153
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,583
Come on!

154
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,750
-Sorry!
-Are you serious?

155
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,708
-What the hell?
-There's a sign!

156
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,583
What about her?

157
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,083
-She's okay.
-You're crazy.

158
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,708
-Get out.
-I'm leaving.

159
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,375
She came to get an eyeful.

160
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,500
-She's in heat.
-How old's your friend?

161
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,000
He wants a girlfriend who's more a woman.

162
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,041
He's not completely wrong.

163
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,791
Do you think it's normal
for you to be here?

164
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,416
I play soccer. Where do you want me to be?

165
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,791
Yeah, but...

166
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,250
there are limits.

167
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,458
Wait a minute. I'm not feminine?

168
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,166
No, you're not.

169
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,500
Sofiane, tell me. I'm really not feminine?

170
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:41,083
Wait, come on, it's... She's right,
you're not super feminine.

171
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,375
Are you serious?

172
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,416
Did I hear that right?
I'm not super feminine?

173
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,375
-Yeah.
-Can we assess your virility for a sec?

174
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,250
What's wrong with my virility?

175
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,791
I've seen better.

176
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,500
I want to know if you've ever hooked up
with an actual person.

177
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,791
Do you like women, men, plants...

178
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,958
Wait, let me think.

179
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,958
There was Laure! In high school.

180
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,583
-No. I even slept with her too.
-We dated.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,083
It's getting hot in here.

182
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,291
Sofiane, be hon

183
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,958
Can you tell she has a kid?

184
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,500
No way! You have a kid?

185
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,791
-No.
-Are you a mother?

186
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,833
You're a mom?

187
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,333
You see how they're looking at me?

188
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,291
Can't believe it.

189
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,375
Hey, bud.

190
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,458
-You okay?
-Yeah.

191
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,583
You look tense. I know you.

192
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,708
Stop petting her like a dog.
And please, stop calling her "bud."

193
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,333
-Does she look like your buddies?
-You know what...

194
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,291
Thank you all for your insights,

195
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,666
but I feel just fine. That's not mine.

196
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,291
I have a steady job, unlimited access
to machines. I like my life.

197
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,583
So, thank you.

198
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,916
-Your eyes are red.
-No, they're not.

199
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,458
It's the bugs.

200
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,208
-I don't have a visor to block them.
-Nadia...

201
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,333
It's hash.

202
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,791
No, Robert. It's not hash.

203
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,000
-Forget I said anything.
-You're wrong.

204
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,625
You've been hurt by a man.

205
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,041
-No.
-I'm right.

206
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,541
Men always hurt us.

207
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,583
Here we go.

208
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,583
I'm gonna go to bed.

209
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,083
I'm dead tired. Exhausted.

210
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,666
You don't think I'm tired too?
I couldn't sleep because you.

211
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,375
-Let's read your cards.
-Please, no.

212
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,916
Watch your mouth.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Axelle would love for her mother
to be concerned for her.

214
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,625
Okay. I'm coming. End of discussion.

215
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,666
-The Chariot.
-Oh, no.

216
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,500
-The Hanged Man.
-Not good, clearly.

217
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,875
The Tower.

218
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,125
The Hermit!

219
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,958
That's a terrible draw.

220
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,500
It's really bad, you mean!

221
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,708
-What does he know?
-The Chariot is Axelle.

222
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,083
That slut that is dragging you down.

223
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,833
The Hanged Man, pretty obvious.
It's you, in 10 years.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,041
The Tower, it's the home you'll never get
and will mourn when you're in heaven.

225
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,000
-Tears of blood!
-And it's all the Hermit's fault!

226
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,041
Who's the Hermit?

227
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,041
This is a little much,
you know that, right?

228
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,416
I'm gonna go to bed.

229
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,000
-Mom, thanks for the reading.
-Go to bed.

230
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,000
You're walking away?
Just don't turn around!

231
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,666
I know. It's bad luck.
So, throw the glass of...

232
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,708
-She was...
-Where have you been?

233
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,625
-It's been four hours!
-Seriously.

234
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,541
Come on.

235
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,833
I need to pee

236
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,791
-and to watch Les Marseillais.
-Okay.

237
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,666
I saw this report on TV
about part-time prostitution. Wait.

238
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,250
Maybe the Hermit is her pimp.

239
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,041
-No way!
-The Hermit is her pimp.

240
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:33,250
Those girls, they're more...
They're not... Not as...

241
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,833
-Not what?
-They're...

242
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,708
You've seen the size of her.

243
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,750
What about it? She's fine.
Some people like that size.

244
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,416
Some people are bigger,
others are smaller.

245
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
Your daughter is a niche.

246
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:48,000
-A niche?
-Yes, a niche. Some people like that.

247
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,208
Really?

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,041
Nice to see you.

249
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,458
-How are you?
-Good.

250
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,791
-You need anything?
-No.

251
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,291
Need a towel? Two towels?
Water? It's free.

252
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,458
I have my own.

253
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,916
-Want a pen?
-No, thanks.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,541
Where's the studio?

255
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,333
-Just there, on your left.
-Cool.

256
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,416
So, it'll be 3 times a week
but don't get discouraged.

257
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,875
-Sure.
-Rome wasn't built in a day.

258
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,500
-Neither do these.
-Thanks.

259
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,083
-Nour, where's the chocolate?
-Down there.

260
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,416
-Under here?
-Yep.

261
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,041
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

262
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,708
-Okay, there it is.
-You're good? I told you.

263
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,791
Hi, how are you?

264
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,916
-Good, you?
-Good.

265
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Your health card?

266
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,250
Yes, I...

267
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,791
Let me check.

268
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,958
Okay...

269
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,625
There...

270
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,333
You can't find it.

271
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,750
Sorry. I had a hard time
with the Admin officer.

272
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,083
I'll bring it next week.

273
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,916
Is studio one very busy?

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,250
There are a few people, you'll see.

275
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,666
-Even a hooker.
-Sorry?

276
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,041
There are a lot of people.
You'll see, it's packed.

277
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,541
-Hi.
-Hi, Gianni.

278
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,083
-Doing okay?
-Yep.

279
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,375
You can't help yourself.

280
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,833
I wanted to bring him to you directly
with the chart.

281
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,416
Everything okay?

282
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,666
Oh, no.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,041
That's not good.

284
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,541
Really? Why?

285
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,125
Because he's really ugly.

286
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,625
The baby, I mean.

287
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,083
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

288
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,333
-What?
-What?

289
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,291
I'm kidding.

290
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,958
Forget about it.

291
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,583
I was... I was just kidding.

292
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,791
Okay. Right.

293
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:07,125
Nour, can you check who I have at 2:30?

294
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,500
-May I?
-Go ahead.

295
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,000
Damn!

296
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,750
-What?
-Well...

297
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,083
your spreadsheets are just...

298
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,208
They're amazing.

299
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,250
-Really?
-Of course. Everything is...

300
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,625
They have everything.
They're as tight as my abs.

301
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,083
Thank you.

302
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,083
Okay, well, I need a little boost.

303
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,208
Oh, sorry.

304
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,916
Sorry, I thought it was a tiny sandbag.

305
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,166
Do you want a shake?

306
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,250
-You sure?
-Still no.

307
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,000
See you later. Keep up the good work.

308
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,083
He went hard on my ribs, did you see?

309
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,291
It doesn't mean anything.

310
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:14,166
If I really wanted him, some leggings
and a blow-dry, he's mine.

311
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,000
No, that's just not my style.

312
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,083
What the hell is going on now?

313
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,291
-Nice!
-So cool!

314
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,500
Awesome!

315
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,041
Damn! Say hi!

316
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,708
That'll be your goal for next time, okay?

317
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,791
Okay!

318
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:36,750
She's awesome!

319
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:43,083
It's not that impressive.
It's not like brain surgery or anything.

320
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,375
So...

321
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,583
Hey, it's over here!

322
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,333
Thank you... Nawel.

323
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,833
That was a great class.

324
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,916
-But it works up an appetite.
-Hi, honey.

325
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,666
Hello. Spaghetti Bolognese
and tiramisu for Nour?

326
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,666
Sorry, it's only two additional items.

327
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,791
So it was either parmesan shavings
or gruyère.

328
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,750
-Is that pasta?
-Yes, Bolognese.

329
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,541
That's my dream.
I haven't eaten pasta in forever.

330
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,791
-Let's go.
-I don't want this anymore.

331
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,583
-Let's go.
-Yeah. Can you drop me off?

332
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:24,875
Bye! See you!

333
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,208
-Bye. Thank you.
-But...

334
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,666
-What about your order?
-No, it's fine.

335
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,666
Bye. Yeah.

336
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,458
And drink water.

337
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,083
A lot of water!

338
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,708
Damn it. I'm so sorry
about the health card.

339
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,666
No, don't worry about that.

340
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,083
I'll take care of it,
then we can, you know...

341
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,416
That's so nice, thank you. That's...

342
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,666
one less thing to worry about.

343
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,125
-You're an angel.
-I have a question.

344
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,750
If you had to teach the basics,
you know, to beginners...

345
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,041
-of pole dance.
-"Pole dancing."

346
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,875
Sorry, pole dancing.

347
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,375
What are the rules? Is it hard?
How do you twirl around it?

348
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,916
My mom was talking about it yesterday,

349
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,500
-and honestly...
-Your mom's interested? That's great!

350
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,416
-Yeah. She's very...
-It's unusual.

351
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
She's crazy about it.
She had a million questions.

352
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,541
-Okay.
-Yup.

353
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,250
So?

354
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,125
I saw that flicker in your eye.

355
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,291
You don't believe me.

356
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,583
You think I'm talking about me.

357
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,750
No, not at all.

358
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,625
-Yes, I can see it.
-No, I swear.

359
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,583
You should know that I am very honest.

360
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,666
I'm not afraid to ask for what I want.

361
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,208
If it was for me, I'd be like, "Sissi,

362
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,708
"I love the pole. Why not try..."

363
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:06,000
What's going on, hon?

364
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,625
Are you scared to come to the class?

365
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,666
Is that it?

366
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,833
Me too, at first, I felt like a failure.

367
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,166
I was too scared to perform.

368
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,250
We'll do it together, just you and me.

369
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,583
I can show you the basics at night,
when no one's around.

370
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,875
It's up to you. No pressure.

371
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,458
It's... Thanks,
but I was really asking for my mom.

372
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,166
Yes, I know that.

373
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,875
But I'm still not sure
I fully believe you.

374
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,583
I was really asking for my mom, but...

375
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,666
-Yeah, why not? It could be interesting.
-Of course.

376
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,083
It could be something my mom
and I do together. Like a duo.

377
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,166
Great.

378
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,916
You know what? I'll ask my mom,

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,500
since it was her idea,
and I'll get back to you.

380
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,583
Great. Make sure she doesn't call me
too late, I take sleeping pills.

381
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,958
Really? She owns a restaurant...

382
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,125
-Right.
-So...

383
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,958
I have to go now.

384
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
-Bye.
-See you.

385
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,750
-Exactly, they don't even look alike.
-Yeah.

386
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,583
-Move.
-They're triplets.

387
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,375
Okay, seriously?
Keep your hands off my fries.

388
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,750
Don't want 'em.
I'm working on being feminine.

389
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,041
One cherry tomato, one squat.
One squat, one cherry tomato.

390
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,041
-Really?
-Yes, I'm a fitness fanatic.

391
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,125
Let me see.

392
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:36,000
He was born on Tuesday.
I cut the umbilical cord.

393
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,375
He was premature,

394
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,416
-but he'll grow up strong.
-Yeah.

395
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,666
He's so cute.

396
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,625
Damn it.

397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,458
That's a big baby.

398
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,208
You could even call that a man.

399
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,375
-How did that get there?
-Weird.

400
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:54,958
-You zoomed in!
-You like him! Finally!

401
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,291
Whatever. I don't even know why I took it.

402
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,875
-You zoom in, you like him.
-He's handsome.

403
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,958
-Are we onto something?
-Of course.

404
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,416
It's something, anyway.

405
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,583
What are you more attracted to?

406
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,791
-Drumroll, please.
-This, the zoom. This.

407
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,083
Or her?

408
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,333
Sensual, wrapping the pole.

409
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,500
You follow "Pole dancing fever"?

410
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:22,500
It's research for work.
And you wanted me to be more feminine.

411
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,625
I meant ditch the hat,
not rub yourself up against a pole.

412
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,833
Seems extreme.

413
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:31,458
If you want to be more feminine,
shave off your mustache, Pablo Escobar.

414
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,208
-I don't have a mustache.
-You do.

415
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,833
I don't have a mustache.

416
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,583
So, we're gonna do six zones?

417
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes, six zones, but is that
like the whole body or what?

418
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,791
It's a lot, right?

419
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,583
Okay, we're doing this.

420
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,083
You know what?

421
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:55,125
How about we try it on my arm first,
see how I react?

422
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:58,125
The wax is very yellow.
I've never seen a yellow...

423
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,541
I like your place.

424
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,458
But... Wait. I think you're...

425
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,916
Your mother is a bitch from hell!

426
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I didn't mean your mother.

427
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,833
I'm so sorry. I didn't meant that.

428
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,375
We better stop now, I know myself.

429
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,375
And seeing how this is going,

430
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:19,041
it's not gonna be a pleasant experience
for me, you, or your mother...

431
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,916
So, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go pay.

432
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm gonna go. Thanks.

433
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:28,708
And one, and two, always keep your feet
on the ground, and three,

434
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,333
and four, and five...

435
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:36,875
You'll do more complex moves later,
but for now, we're just walking.

436
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,708
Sensually. Good.

437
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,125
Raise your head, more sensual.

438
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,833
I'm sensual, I'm hot, I'm thirsty.

439
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,750
How many in your party?
Give me my teddy back.

440
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,166
-What are you doing?
-What's this...

441
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,208
Well, I'm just liking what I see.

442
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,625
And you like what you're doing?

443
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,833
-Not so much.
-No, so maybe stop talking, honey.

444
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,541
-Sorry, but that's not what I do.
-I won't do it again.

445
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,416
-I swear.
-This isn't a striptease.

446
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,583
-No, it's walking.
-Okay.

447
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,333
Very good.

448
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:30,166
No, it's great, but it could take a while.

449
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,708
Okay? I'll call you back when we're done.

450
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,875
Okay, bye.

451
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,125
Good! That's beautiful.

452
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,708
-Can you feel it?
-Yeah, finally I...

453
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,125
You'll see, in less than two weeks,
the guys will want to rape you.

454
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,416
That's great.

455
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:51,958
Okay, now, we're gonna
have you climb the pole.

456
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,625
No, we don't have to.

457
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:58,916
For me to get a hold of this,
we'd need to get to the hardware store.

458
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,708
Put down a deposit
on a crane or a freight lift.

459
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,125
Come on, angel.

460
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,250
Take your right hand... Come here.

461
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,583
Put it high up there.

462
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:13,208
Good. Higher. I need to see some skin.

463
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,125
Meaning?

464
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:17,791
Your skin, against the pole,
to get a good grip.

465
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,000
Right hand here.

466
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,333
-Leg here?
-Your hand.

467
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,166
Good, jump up, there we go!

468
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,583
Good! It's great!

469
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,166
Well done, it's great!

470
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:28,666
-Good.
-What the hell?

471
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,500
-It won't hold!
-That's great!

472
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,000
-Sorry.
-No, that's great.

473
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,541
-That's great.
-Damn!

474
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,958
-Are you hurt?
-No.

475
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,791
All good? Did you get hurt?

476
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,083
No, just the hair.

477
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,750
Don't break her.
She's the only one we have.

478
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,041
-You okay?
-Yes.

479
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,416
-All good.
-That's great, Nour.

480
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,458
Keep it up.

481
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,833
Aren't you on a diet?

482
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,166
I don't care anymore.

483
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,041
I'll eat non-stop.
Until I can roll myself around.

484
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,791
I'll wait for some bearded guy
to take pity on me,

485
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,708
introduce me to his mom
who'll teach me to cook,

486
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,041
we'll buy a fridge,
and on Sundays, we'll eat couscous!

487
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,583
You're being ridiculous.

488
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:16,166
No, I'm serious. I'm doomed.
I'll end up with an Uber driver.

489
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,375
-But tell us about you.
-What?

490
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:24,166
We don't know if you like G-strings
or briefs. Men or women?

491
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,375
Yeah, but...

492
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,125
-It's weird. You should know.
-I don't know.

493
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,708
-Want us to help?
-Sure, I don't know.

494
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:32,916
I have an idea.

495
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,208
Focus. First scenario.

496
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,375
Close your eyes. Imagine yourself.

497
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:39,791
What?

498
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,916
Just close your eyes.

499
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,333
-We're in Tulum.
-Okay.

500
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,125
That's in Mexico. On the beach.

501
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,708
It's super hot.

502
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,875
100 degrees.

503
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,000
I have Jessica Alba's boobs.

504
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,291
-Tits up here.
-And Jennifer Lopez's ass.

505
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,250
-Round.
-You can hear the waves.

506
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,625
Seagulls.

507
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:01,625
Find some waves on YouTube.

508
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,458
Okay. Fine sandy beach. Close your eyes.

509
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,333
I'm gonna have to take my bikini off.

510
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:13,791
So I unclip it.

511
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:18,291
I twirl it around and you're watching
my bikini spinning in the air.

512
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:20,875
I tie you up.

513
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:26,458
I tie you up real good. Tight,
as if you were in a Soviet gulag.

514
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,333
I take the bottom off,

515
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,083
the only logical next step.

516
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,791
And now, I spank your ass.
That slaps real good.

517
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,625
It slaps just right.

518
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,458
I've never seen an ass spanked so good.

519
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,041
Slap that ass.

520
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,708
Order up!

521
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,833
-What's going on?
-It's my daughter.

522
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,000
If you heard her.

523
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,125
Sodom and Gomorrah.

524
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,958
No way. Where is she?

525
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:56,916
At home.

526
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,625
Telling sex stories.

527
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,250
-To who?
-I don't know!

528
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,958
She's making loud noises.

529
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,708
This is just like that TV report
I saw on webcam girls.

530
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,375
Internet sex.

531
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,000
Internet sex.

532
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,083
This is my daughter
you're talking about.

533
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,250
I know.

534
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,125
Want me to keep an eye on her?

535
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:24,666
Okay.

536
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,708
-Final scenario.
-Okay.

537
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,291
You're at work.

538
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,500
And I... Close your eyes!

539
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,750
I'm a guy.

540
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:33,583
-Handsome.
-Very handsome.

541
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,333
Charming, a good guy.

542
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,833
Very muscular, you see?

543
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:41,791
Muscles you've never seen before.
As hard as rock.

544
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:45,041
We see each other every day.
We're at work, okay?

545
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:50,083
You guys often talk in the mornings.
He's wearing a blue polo shirt. Navy.

546
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,291
He leans in to see what you're doing.

547
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,375
Talks about numbers, spreadsheets...

548
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,625
Is that driving you crazy?

549
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:02,291
-I don't know.
-You need to know. He has to.

550
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,375
You've been stammering the whole time.

551
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,916
You need to know,
or one day, you'll wake up

552
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,083
next to a big dance pole,
on top of the teacher,

553
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,250
her ass under your head,

554
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,958
nothing'll makes sense,
and the guy you like

555
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:18,166
will be laughing at you,
so you gotta know!

556
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,416
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

557
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,791
-Yes.
-Are you doing pole dancing?

558
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:25,750
Yes. I tried pole dancing.

559
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,125
And for like two seconds,
I saw an opening.

560
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,916
It was just a tiny opening.

561
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,791
But I liked it.

562
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:41,916
For 10 minutes,
I thought, "You too you're allowed

563
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:46,625
"some debauchery, to be bawdy,
to have a libido and all that.

564
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,833
"Girly stuff.
You're allowed to flirt at a bar too."

565
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,750
Anyway, I'm tired.

566
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,375
Can you get us towels?

567
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,375
What are you doing here?

568
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,750
Free introduction to pole dancing class.

569
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,416
Come on, let's go.

570
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,083
-Come on.
-No, seriously.

571
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm serious. This is my job.

572
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,208
People know me here.

573
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,250
Come on!

574
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,000
This is so embarrassing!

575
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,333
Come on, it's free!

576
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,500
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm at a loss.

577
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:41,958
What's up, bella?

578
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,166
What's up?

579
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,875
-I'm working real hard on the accounts.
-Let me see.

580
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,291
Yeah, all these numbers...

581
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,583
You're a genius.

582
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,958
And you understand all that?

583
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:59,250
'Cause I don't understand anything.
I'd be completely lost.

584
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,833
Really. You're very smart.

585
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:02,958
Thanks.

586
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,291
We're going to work, okay?

587
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,416
I need to get back to work, too.

588
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,458
I can't just leave you like that.
It reminds me of my own failure.

589
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,041
I've seen too many girls
like you in Fresnes.

590
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,125
Fresnes?

591
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:32,666
Like, the town of Fresnes
or the prison...

592
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,750
Give me two hours.

593
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,708
Two. You're on your break.

594
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,041
I'm taking you to the Lotus.

595
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,083
Come on.

596
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,791
What's the Lotus? A Vietnamese restaurant?

597
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,750
-Hi.
-What's up, Coco?

598
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,541
-It's four.
-I'm not eating here.

599
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,250
No way.

600
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,916
This is my protégée, Nour.
Nour, Coco. Coco, Nour.

601
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,250
-Hi.
-Do I get a kiss?

602
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,333
Sure.

603
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,583
-Come on.
-Go on in.

604
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,875
I danced here for 15 years.

605
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,333
I still hold the record for biggest tip.

606
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:15,875
16,000 Francs.

607
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:56,833
So, I've checked,
and none of them are going to heaven.

608
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,250
-They don't want to.
-Be honest,

609
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,375
how do you feel when you see this?

610
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,291
Honestly?

611
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,541
Acid reflux. That's what I feel.

612
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,583
Not kidding.

613
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,750
They're practicing for Open Pole Night.

614
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,916
Look, you've got a bit of everything here.

615
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,041
Okay, that one works here at night,

616
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:18,750
so she's a bit more advanced,
but that one...

617
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,708
she's a banker, and a mom.

618
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:27,208
And coming here has saved her marriage.
It's better than ever.

619
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,041
Sorry, I got lost
in the story of that stain.

620
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,625
-Stains, actually. Cool.
-Okay.

621
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,333
Look at Marie. That's beautiful.

622
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,291
She offers up her butt,

623
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:46,083
tilts her pelvis and, boom, human chair.

624
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,208
And she only comes here occasionally.

625
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:52,541
Okay, that's kinda cool. To be honest,
I kinda want to dance with her.

626
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,041
Like we practiced together,
put on a bathing suit,

627
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,458
and get on stage with her.

628
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,666
Really, honey?

629
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,041
No, Sissi, of course not.

630
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,375
It's 2:00. People across France
are still digesting lunch.

631
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:09,541
What's your plan with me?
Use simple words, so I get it.

632
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,833
I want you to watch.

633
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,958
You'd have to forget
their asses are hanging out.

634
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,083
That's a little hard to forget.

635
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,916
Just like her!

636
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,166
Unbelievable! She's spinning and pregnant.

637
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,625
She's pregnant

638
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,250
and wearing a G-string.

639
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,916
Her! Look at her.

640
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,458
She's so proud, look! So artistic.

641
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,708
-Shut your mouth. You're drooling.
-No, I'm not.

642
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,291
She started two months ago.

643
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,333
Really?

644
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,875
Ladies!

645
00:35:58,541 --> 00:36:01,250
This is Nour. My new protégée.

646
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,333
-Hi, Nour.
-Hi!

647
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,500
-Welcome.
-Come on, girls.

648
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,750
-What's your size?
-Size of what?

649
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,291
-Your shoe size.
-Size 8.

650
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:13,791
Hi, Nour.

651
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,541
It's great here, you'll see.

652
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,916
Sissi? You're taking forever.

653
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,875
Okay. I see where you're going with this.

654
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,666
If you want to give me a present,
you can get me...

655
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:35,875
I'll take this screen.
It's nice, it's bamboo.

656
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:40,083
Look at me. I feel like you want to try,
but you're too scared.

657
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,375
So take this,

658
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,791
you can practice at home,
away from prying eyes,

659
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:50,000
and when you feel more comfortable,
come back to me. I'll be here.

660
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:50,958
I'll be waiting.

661
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,916
Don't forget to eat though,
'cause it could take a while.

662
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:58,625
I just got it.

663
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,250
Wait. Sissi?

664
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:04,375
-A strip club?
-Yeah.

665
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,958
Was she alone there?

666
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,416
With an instructor.

667
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:15,416
-My daughter?
-The instructor was a bit skanky,

668
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,250
like the girls you ignore. It's the eyes.

669
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,000
Reeks of sex when she talks.

670
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,791
Her mouth, and her breasts...

671
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,208
-My girl?
-Yes, a tall brunette.

672
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,583
Why would she do that?

673
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,833
She has a steady job.

674
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,666
Easy cash, I'm telling you.

675
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,833
I saw that on a TV report.
That's all the kids want.

676
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:40,666
She wants a father figure.
All my life, I tried to protect her!

677
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,083
My girl!

678
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,083
Excuse me.

679
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,500
One hundred-euro tip, my ass.

680
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,458
That hurts.

681
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,125
Hi. How are you?

682
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:23,208
Good, thanks.
So, I'm just returning the pole.

683
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:25,500
It's just in the way.

684
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:26,916
Like, really in the way.

685
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,333
Me, and subway line 3.

686
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,791
Have you tried, at least?

687
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:35,333
Yes. But there was no spark between us,
that special thing.

688
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,833
It's not the pole, it's me.
It deserves better.

689
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:39,791
What did you try exactly?

690
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,708
I tried this.

691
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:49,041
I'll show you. I tried this.

692
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:51,916
I got that.

693
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:55,375
I swear, I got it. That, I got too.

694
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:56,333
Good.

695
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,416
I dropped the coat. The sensual walk.

696
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,875
-Perfecto.
-Good!

697
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,208
My walk is top notch.

698
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:05,708
There, I sat down quite well.

699
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:07,916
All the touching, I got that down.

700
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:10,416
And then, from there...

701
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,416
-I couldn't get it. Nothing.
-Of course not, that's too advanced!

702
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,250
No one sells a kilo on their first day.

703
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,458
Listen to me. Here, sit.

704
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,500
First, you're the lookout.

705
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,000
Then you're entrusted
with minding the drugs.

706
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:32,041
Then you start selling,
and you sell a hundred grams,

707
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:36,291
then a bar, and only then
do you deal your first kilo.

708
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,708
And if you do well,
you might start smuggling.

709
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:41,166
But there are steps.

710
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,791
Learn the basics.

711
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,375
Look at this move, honey.

712
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,625
If we practice, you'll get it, I promise.

713
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,625
I don't feel it. It's very sweet...

714
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:54,250
-I'm gonna go. Thank you.
-If you give up...

715
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:57,291
it could become a habit. Never give up.

716
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,416
-Simone de Beauvoir?
-Michael Jordan.

717
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,208
-Really?
-Look, nobody cares about your ass.

718
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,291
Flexibility comes from there, angel.

719
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,250
You see?

720
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,291
You're stubborn. You won't let this go.

721
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:13,583
Come with me, I need to talk to you.

722
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:17,875
So?

723
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,541
I get it now.

724
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:25,333
I get it. You see me wearing my hoodies,
in my hats and tracksuits.

725
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,333
I'm not like you, I'm not...

726
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:31,916
How can I put this?

727
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,250
There'll never be anything between us.

728
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,833
-Never.
-Oh, I see!

729
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:38,958
Do you get it?

730
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,208
Can't we be friends, like sisters?

731
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,000
-Maybe like nuns...
-Shut up, angel!

732
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,375
Show me the move again, I'll explain.

733
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:49,083
-You won't...
-No!

734
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,708
Do you have to be so close?

735
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,041
You have powder?

736
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,416
-For what?
-A good grip.

737
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,916
-No.
-Old school, then.

738
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,083
Okay.

739
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,625
Okay. You see?

740
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:03,000
-Yeah.
-All right.

741
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,958
Okay. We have work to do.

742
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:09,791
Try again?

743
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,333
Half a turn and bend.

744
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,416
-Amazing! It's...
-Your turn.

745
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,500
Let's go. Here. And you let go.

746
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:29,791
Easy.

747
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:32,208
Yeah!

748
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,500
You're ready for Open Pole Night!

749
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,416
Well done!

750
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:40,583
So...

751
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm going this way.

752
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,708
Me, this way.

753
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,500
-It was nice, wasn't it?
-Yeah, it was.

754
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,125
By the way...

755
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,833
How much do I owe you
for the private lesson?

756
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:56,041
-How much do you charge?
-Forget it.

757
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,416
You're my challenge.

758
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:02,958
Okay.

759
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,458
I like you.

760
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,083
-That's all.
-That's nice.

761
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,958
And I don't want
to play scissors with you.

762
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,375
Scissors?

763
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,208
Okay.

764
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,791
Thank you so much. It means a lot to me.

765
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:24,208
Nobody has ever done that for me.

766
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:25,875
You're too sweet.

767
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:27,541
Okay...

768
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,833
See you tomorrow?

769
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, see you tomorrow. Sure.

770
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,166
Bye. It's a little...

771
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:41,500
Don't forget to show your mom!

772
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,791
Yeah, sure. I'll show my mom.

773
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:21,041
-Number three, your voice, so he listens.
-He listens.

774
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,375
Control your voice.

775
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:23,875
Control my voice.

776
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:27,166
Move as slowly as you can.
It's never too slow.

777
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,000
Move your hands any way you like.

778
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,750
Again. Let it sink in.

779
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,583
Good.

780
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,041
Bat your lashes very slowly.

781
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,208
Good.

782
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:58,625
-Really?
-Yeah.

783
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,458
FIVE FRUITS AND VEGGIES DAILY

784
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,208
THREE COOKIES TOPS
PRACTICE SENSUAL MOVES

785
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,208
Give me 10, please.

786
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:47,958
Come on. I'll watch.

787
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,875
Yeah, me too, I...

788
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:57,500
I feel lighter, looser. I don't know why.

789
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,625
I feel good. What about you?

790
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,166
Okay.

791
00:46:01,666 --> 00:46:04,083
-I want you to feel good, Michelle.
-Nour.

792
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,583
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

793
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,166
-And you?
-Good.

794
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,791
I wanted to ask you. Would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

795
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,375
Dinner?

796
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:17,125
-Tonight?
-Yes. If you can make it.

797
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,958
-I can't tonight.
-Okay.

798
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,125
Tomorrow?

799
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,041
Tomorrow you can?

800
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:23,208
-Yeah.
-Really?

801
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,541
Let me check my calendar... Okay.

802
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:31,833
I'm so happy. I'm gonna take you
to this great Italian place, Al Dente.

803
00:46:31,916 --> 00:46:33,750
-I like pasta.
-Awesome.

804
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,083
-What's that? Smile again.
-What?

805
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:40,500
That's funny.

806
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,375
Wow.

807
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,666
I like that dimple. It's beautiful.

808
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:49,875
It's really nice.

809
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:51,791
Incredible.

810
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,000
So... I'll see you tomorrow.

811
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:59,875
Okay? See you then, principessa.

812
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,625
He fingered my dimple.

813
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:09,458
Did you see that? I can't feel my cheek.

814
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:10,750
Can I have a towel?

815
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:14,708
Sure. Why just one? Take two, three,
eight, twelve. All of them.

816
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,625
Thank you.

817
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,583
He fingered my...
He called me "principessa."

818
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:23,791
I'm gonna go chill in the sauna.
Can you cover for me?

819
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,875
I should buy a trikini. I want one.
All my life, I've wanted one.

820
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,833
Today's the big day. D-Day.

821
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:41,375
Sorry, Michelle.

822
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:45,500
When you start talking like that,
you need to keep that for your village.

823
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:46,875
I got nothing.

824
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,750
Come on, guys, get moving!
We have two more moves to do.

825
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,708
Do you know how much that TV costs?

826
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,875
A thousand euros?

827
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,458
More.

828
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,083
Fifteen hundred?

829
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,000
This isn't The Price is Right.

830
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,875
Watch it, you're on probation.

831
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:07,458
She knows that?

832
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,083
I just wanted to know
if you're nearly done.

833
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,333
-Hello.
-Hello, excuse me.

834
00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:17,291
Well, we're on it.

835
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:21,708
We're just finalizing
the finishing touches.

836
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:23,875
-Great.
-Yeah, sure.

837
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:27,583
Akim, make sure to take care
of the gentleman's personal effects.

838
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,916
We're gonna get on it.

839
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:33,125
Get some bubble wrap.

840
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:35,083
We have to protect the...

841
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,083
-Bubble wrap for the remote?
-Yes.

842
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,125
I wanted to know...

843
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,541
Are the boxes of clothes
already downstairs? I need a jacket.

844
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:47,041
-What?
-The boxes of clothes? I need a jacket.

845
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,791
Your clothes, yes.

846
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:53,583
But we couldn't find your wife's clothes.

847
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm not married.

848
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,541
-Really?
-No.

849
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:02,291
Just like me. No wife, no kid.
That's incredible.

850
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:05,583
-Really?
-We have so much in common.

851
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,708
We could discuss this over a drink.

852
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:09,833
Is this okay?

853
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,875
Seriously?

854
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,166
Look at that, I'm a badass.

855
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,166
AXELLE - NOUR AND I HAVE DATES
DO YOU?

856
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,083
By the way, I wanted to ask you...

857
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:42,708
I...

858
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,625
It's an easy question, really...

859
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:48,541
Yes?

860
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:50,333
Dinner?

861
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,041
I'd love to.

862
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:56,375
When?

863
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,375
It's open!

864
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,125
-So...
-We have dates!

865
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:12,833
Come on!

866
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:14,291
His stuff is here.

867
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,208
-Cool.
-He can watch some Peppa Pig.

868
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:19,375
No, I wanted to show him
some true crime. Hard core.

869
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,208
Great. How do I look?

870
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:25,208
It's well beyond most
people's expectations.

871
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,875
-Wish me luck.
-Make me proud.

872
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,625
Do what you gotta do.

873
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,791
Good night, sweetheart!

874
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:34,416
Okay, watch your Aunt Nour.
No one has ever seen this before.

875
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,583
You're the first.

876
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,208
Aunt Nour, queen of the night, huh?

877
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,416
Check this out.

878
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,333
What do you think?

879
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,416
-Are you kidding me?
-No, wait.

880
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,791
-He's still awake?
-What are you doing here?

881
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,458
-No, he's not sleeping.
-Baby.

882
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:17,875
-We were asleep 10 minutes ago.
-Why aren't you sleeping?

883
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,583
-He was asleep.
-No, he wasn't.

884
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:23,000
-He was, five minutes ago!
-He's playing you.

885
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,458
-Not cool. What did he watch?
-Nothing.

886
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,541
Go to sleep.

887
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,000
-What are you doing here? Was it bad?
-No, it was great.

888
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:34,375
He's at my place.

889
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,291
Why did you leave?

890
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:39,333
I don't know.

891
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,625
I didn't know what to say.
I was feeling vulnerable.

892
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,666
I said you had an incurable disease.
He didn't buy it.

893
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,500
-Obviously.
-I'll never see him again, I think.

894
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,875
And besides, he would've bailed.

895
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,708
I have a kid
and I make more money than him.

896
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,625
He would've bailed, for sure.

897
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,125
It's hopeless.

898
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:03,125
Go to sleep now.

899
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,583
I still have hope for you, Pablo Escobar.

900
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:10,083
Sleepy time.

901
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:11,791
It's time to sleep.

902
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:13,916
He was sleeping.

903
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,208
He was.

904
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:17,000
-Want me to swear?
-Go on.

905
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,916
-On my mom's life.
-Okay, fine.

906
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,250
Axelle, it's me.

907
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,458
About last night. Just tell the guy.

908
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:41,500
Tell him you have a kid. There's no shame.

909
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:43,333
If he likes you, it won't matter.

910
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,333
I love you, sis. I love you very much.

911
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,833
About dinner tonight...
How can I put this?

912
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:54,208
Remember when we were making fun of girls
who had butterflies in their stomach?

913
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,541
I think I have butterflies in mine.
It's so weird.

914
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,916
This is weird. Last time I felt this...

915
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,916
It was for the World Cup finale.

916
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,958
I feel half excited, half nervous.

917
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,000
I can't wait and I'm scared.

918
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,875
What's "nude"? Like "natural?"

919
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,041
-Yes.
-I want the complete opposite.

920
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,041
-I want glitter.
-Okay.

921
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,083
You have an amazing complexion.

922
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,666
That makes a total of 242 euros, please.

923
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:26,083
Okay, so, I won't take the box sets.

924
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,416
So you don't want these.
No box sets?

925
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,000
That's right, no box sets.

926
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,375
That makes a total of 80 euros.

927
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,083
I'll take just this.

928
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,333
-Just this?
-Yes.

929
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,083
These I have already.

930
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,291
Of course.

931
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:42,875
It's too much.

932
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,541
Start in the center and work your way out.

933
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:58,041
-Here.
-Like that.

934
00:54:58,458 --> 00:54:59,458
And then you...

935
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:01,708
To spread it.

936
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,333
And you can't go looking like Jason Momoa.

937
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:07,958
I look like him?

938
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,666
Check this out.

939
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,833
-Bet Jason Momoa doesn't do this.
-Look.

940
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,583
"Can I make it up to you tonight?"
"Can't, I'll be with my son."

941
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,083
"Tomorrow..." See, quick reply.
Didn't even need to think about it.

942
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,166
No, "What? A son?"

943
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,666
You see? I like him. He's cool.

944
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:34,458
I feel like he's a real man.

945
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:36,250
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

946
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,083
We have to get rid of that peach fuzz,
it's too much.

947
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:42,583
I'm working on it.
I bought all the tools I could find.

948
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:46,666
Okay, say something sexy.
With a rough, raspy voice.

949
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,125
Like something sexual?

950
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,666
-Something dirty?
-Yes.

951
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,416
Guys like mysterious voices.
But make it hoarse.

952
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,333
Do it.

953
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,750
-Excuse us.
-Sorry.

954
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:00,750
Hi, I'm Shana.

955
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:02,166
Wow.

956
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,791
Hi, I'm Shana.
Wanna meet a tigress near you?

957
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,708
Send "KITTY" to 81212.

958
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,958
-Scary, huh?
-A little unnerving.

959
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:12,958
That's not it.

960
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,541
Is this what you're gonna wear?

961
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,291
-What is this shit?
-Yes.

962
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,750
I like it. It's "casual chic."

963
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:22,208
No, it's "casual shit."

964
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,916
No. That's mean.

965
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,083
You can't wear this.

966
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:27,791
-Let me try it on...
-No! You can't.

967
00:56:28,375 --> 00:56:30,708
I... We'll find something.

968
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,375
Take a break. Watching you is exhausting.

969
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,041
-Sorry.
-I got it.

970
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,958
Well, well...

971
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:42,083
I got everything.
I emptied the laundry basket.

972
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,625
I wore it when I was pregnant.

973
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:46,375
I picked up a lot of guys.

974
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:47,708
Like, a lot.

975
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:49,500
You were pregnant...

976
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:53,791
You still had intercourse...
Didn't the amniotic fluid stop you...

977
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:56,291
It was non-stop when I was pregnant.

978
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,041
My hormones were on fire.

979
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:00,625
No judging.
I don't know what got into me.

980
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,916
-So, we're sure about the jacket?
-Yes.

981
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,750
Yes. It's vintage.

982
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:06,416
And what about the lips?

983
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,208
Isn't it too much like...
Like Ariana Grande boosted with cortisone.

984
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,166
Well...

985
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,125
You look pretty.

986
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:16,416
She does.

987
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,666
I've been waiting this for 20 years.

988
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,916
But being a girl is hard.

989
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,083
My nails won't stick. I lost one.
It's overwhelming.

990
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,791
By the way, what do I do? For my date?

991
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,500
Where are you going?

992
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,166
I panicked, I told him to surprise me.

993
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,875
-That's a good thing!
-Sure.

994
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:38,666
-Really?
-Yeah, now you're cool.

995
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,708
-Cool.
-Come on, get a move on.

996
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:44,041
-Make me proud.
-Let's do this.

997
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,375
-I'm gonna French kiss his face off.
-Do it right.

998
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:33,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

999
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,666
-For Liu?
-No, for Nour.

1000
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:51,250
-Hi, Nour?
-Yes.

1001
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,416
Hello.

1002
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:18,833
Nour, are you okay?

1003
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:20,666
-Yes.
-What's up?

1004
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,458
-Oh, it's just...
-You okay?

1005
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:23,875
Got a tickle in my throat.

1006
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:27,333
You're...

1007
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,500
You're... You're beautiful.

1008
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:33,583
-Thank you. You too...
-I went to a tanning salon.

1009
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,166
That's the place.

1010
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:40,791
Shall we?

1011
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:43,750
Nour, baby, it's Mom.

1012
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,416
Nour?

1013
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,083
What is this?

1014
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,750
She's a hooker.

1015
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,750
My daughter's a hooker.

1016
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:23,875
Are you okay?

1017
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
The suspense.

1018
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,333
-I get that.
-Good evening.

1019
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:33,333
-Hello.
-What can I get you?

1020
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:37,166
Well... Yes...

1021
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,250
-Yeah?
-Yes.

1022
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,166
It's not easy.

1023
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,458
So, I...

1024
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:43,208
I'll have the penne...

1025
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:46,750
arrabiata, without the arrabiata.

1026
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,833
-So, plain pasta then?
-Yes, exactly.

1027
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,750
What about you?

1028
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:00,916
Surprise me.

1029
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:04,958
Well, okay, then.

1030
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,333
A surprise.

1031
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:07,708
Thank you.

1032
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,916
You caught me off-guard.
That was very cool.

1033
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:26,708
Are you okay?

1034
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,291
Yes, I'm fine.

1035
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:30,916
You don't like this?

1036
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,125
Of course I do. I like this one.

1037
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,958
Would you like to go somewhere?

1038
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,291
Go where?

1039
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:45,625
Anywhere. In that corner there...

1040
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,333
No? Or a back room.

1041
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:51,333
Or a bathroom.
That's kind of a back room.

1042
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,833
-It's better, for the first time...
-Yes, sure.

1043
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:57,166
Maybe. I don't know.

1044
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,250
Or maybe you prefer the park?

1045
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,375
Let's get some air.

1046
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:01,583
-Really?
-Yeah.

1047
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:03,833
You'll feel better. Come on.

1048
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,041
If you want...

1049
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,083
Do you like it?

1050
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,250
When I get home,

1051
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:13,500
I take 10 eggs out of the fridge,

1052
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:15,000
and put 'em in a shaker.

1053
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:17,625
I only eat the whites, but...

1054
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,833
I add a bit of sugar.

1055
01:02:23,291 --> 01:02:25,250
I love the yolks. Just the yolks.

1056
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:27,708
But that's where the fat is.

1057
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,958
I have something to tell you.

1058
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:37,125
What is it? What?

1059
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:39,833
It has to stay between you and me.

1060
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,541
Sure, tell me.

1061
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:43,958
Fine.

1062
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,666
I think that you and I...

1063
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:49,000
Yes?

1064
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,250
We belong together.

1065
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,500
I'm opening my own gym.

1066
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,666
The No Pain, No Gain.

1067
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,000
And I've always thought of you...

1068
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:08,041
to work at the from desk.

1069
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,000
I think that
with your spreadsheets skills,

1070
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:14,750
and my abs skills...

1071
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,625
we'd be a great team.

1072
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:18,750
Really.

1073
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:23,250
I'm telling you, I can only envision
doing this with you, so, please...

1074
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,791
I've never done this before.

1075
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:28,041
Please say yes. Please.

1076
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,041
Sorry, just...

1077
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,291
Just to be clear,
you're offering me a work contract?

1078
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:40,666
No, I'd like you to be
my business partner.

1079
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:48,250
Is something wrong?

1080
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,208
No, I'm fine.
I couldn't be any better.

1081
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:56,791
So, I'll think about it, but what would
you and I do together hand in hand?

1082
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,291
We'd make a great team!

1083
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:03,208
It took me four hours to get ready.

1084
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,208
I'm wearing earrings.

1085
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,208
I got my hair done.

1086
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,208
Candles, wine, pouring the wine,

1087
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:18,166
pulling out the chair, holding doors.
Not for me.

1088
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:21,500
I've never known tenderness.

1089
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:23,000
I don't know what it's like.

1090
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,500
Having my hair stroked.

1091
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,166
Someone to hold my hand.

1092
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,500
No, I don't deserve it.

1093
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:37,083
Others have a right to those things,
but not me.

1094
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,750
Nour, I don't understand.

1095
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:47,083
This was the best night
of my life. Amazing.

1096
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:48,416
-Thank you.
-Nour!

1097
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,750
Nour, I don't understand!

1098
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,000
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

1099
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,000
Is that a "no" then?

1100
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,750
I don't feel a thing.

1101
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,916
Well, thank you.

1102
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,041
No, it's not you.

1103
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:29,458
I'm a virgin when it comes to kissing.

1104
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:34,083
-I see.
-I thought it would be more...

1105
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,166
More?

1106
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,833
But, actually... It's weird.

1107
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,375
You're not gay?

1108
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,250
Yes, I am.

1109
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:45,125
I mean, no. I don't know.

1110
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,666
You don't like women?

1111
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:50,625
Well, actually, they don't like me.

1112
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:53,583
Maybe we should just try again.

1113
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:57,166
Sorry to tell you,
but you might be straight.

1114
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,708
-Damn it!
-Yes.

1115
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,625
You think so?

1116
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,708
I don't know.

1117
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:09,125
We all have a feminine side.
We just have to own it.

1118
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:12,958
It's normal.

1119
01:06:14,125 --> 01:06:16,750
-Are you saying this to hook up with me?
-No.

1120
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,500
That guy is so small!

1121
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,291
Insignificant.

1122
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:24,291
You're so out of his league.

1123
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:27,541
I promise. Where are the real men?

1124
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:31,833
You know, the tough men with real balls?

1125
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:36,208
Wait, check out the waiter over there.

1126
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,458
With his little hands.

1127
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,458
I'd break him.

1128
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:47,083
Honestly, don't let it get to you.

1129
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:50,791
It's like a failed heist.
You need to plan a new one ASAP.

1130
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:53,333
Don't give up.
Keep the adrenaline flowing.

1131
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:57,416
I'll need to see your criminal record
at some point.

1132
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,541
Don't change the subject.

1133
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:04,208
Check out that guy.

1134
01:07:06,083 --> 01:07:08,291
The one with the fish scales.
He's all alone.

1135
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,125
Go get him!

1136
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,375
No way.

1137
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:16,166
You're not leaving until you get
at least one number. Or two.

1138
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:37,583
Hey, what's up?

1139
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:39,041
Do you remember me?

1140
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:43,166
At the gym, the delivery. The...

1141
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,958
It was spaghetti carbonara, wasn't it?

1142
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:49,208
Oh, yes, sorry. It was bolognese.

1143
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,958
Can I join you?

1144
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,875
Sure, if you stay there, be my guest.

1145
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,125
How's your delivery guy party going?

1146
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:02,083
What are you talking about?

1147
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:03,875
Gas prices have gone up.

1148
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,708
Expensive.

1149
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,166
You never stop.

1150
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,833
Can I buy you a drink?

1151
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,583
In your dreams. I'm buying.

1152
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:20,958
-That's cool.
-But lose the windbreaker.

1153
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,125
Sure.

1154
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:30,083
-Not "pole dance," it's "pole dancing."
-Right.

1155
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,250
I wanted to try something new.

1156
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:34,291
My real passion is soccer.

1157
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,166
-Oh, I see.
-Yeah, I almost turned pro.

1158
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,875
-Really?
-Actually, soccer and accounting.

1159
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:43,041
-Accounting?
-Yes, it's my guilty pleasure.

1160
01:08:43,125 --> 01:08:46,166
I go crazy when I see a calculator.
Crazy! I...

1161
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,416
I manage everything at the gym.

1162
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,875
So you... Your life is so cool.

1163
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:55,125
And I have a steady job
and unlimited access to the machines.

1164
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,666
-All mine.
-You know what?

1165
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,000
What are you doing with my phone?

1166
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:02,416
I'm adding the number
of the sexiest guy in the club.

1167
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:06,458
Available 24/7.

1168
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,375
Wait, is this a joke?

1169
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:10,958
No, let's get dinner tomorrow or later...

1170
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:13,500
-You think this is funny?
-Not at all.

1171
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,708
I think you're cool. What's wrong?

1172
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:18,458
Maybe you want me to join your company,

1173
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:21,333
or maybe you want some
kind of business partnership.

1174
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:24,791
I could be your associate.
We can split the business 50-50?

1175
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,833
-Are you serious?
-Bye.

1176
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:36,791
What are you doing here?

1177
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,541
I started working as a prostitute
when I was young.

1178
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:54,583
At first for pleasure,
but then, it became a living hell.

1179
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:55,958
PROSTITUTION
A SPECIAL REPORT

1180
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:58,166
I got out thanks to my mother.

1181
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,041
She helped me, supported me.

1182
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:06,291
She saved me.
The hardest part was quitting drugs.

1183
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,500
I was addicted, but...

1184
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,750
Wait, I don't understand.

1185
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:16,541
-You think I'm a hooker?
-Don't lie to me.

1186
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:20,708
I found everything. Your browser history.
All the cookies.

1187
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,583
The pool dance.

1188
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:24,250
How to arouse a man.

1189
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,541
Striptease tutorial, Islam and pool dance,
pool dance during Ramadan.

1190
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,291
So, you went through my things.

1191
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,916
You've been up here
going through my stuff?

1192
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,375
Why are you doing this?

1193
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:43,666
I don't know. Maybe because
I'm tired of being humiliated.

1194
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,625
Maybe to find balance.
To be a real woman, finally.

1195
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,916
But you are a real woman!

1196
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:52,250
You don't need to sell your body.

1197
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,125
I'm not.

1198
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:59,000
Why don't you get it?
It's mindboggling how you never get it.

1199
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:01,958
You don't get it. You don't know who I am.

1200
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:05,208
Sticking your nose everywhere,
going through my stuff.

1201
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,958
You don't know my heart.

1202
01:11:08,041 --> 01:11:10,000
You're toxic. You're bad for me.

1203
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:13,458
You don't support me or trust me.
You're always watching me.

1204
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:17,583
All you're good for is filling me up
with your greasy food, stuffing me.

1205
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:20,166
Does it make you happy?
Fine, search away.

1206
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,041
I'm leaving. That's it. I'm done.

1207
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,708
Good!

1208
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:10,000
Straight. There you go.

1209
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:12,875
Here.

1210
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,375
I came to return your things.
There you go. Thank you.

1211
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:19,500
-You don't want to train with us?
-No, honestly, no.

1212
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:23,041
-But can I sit and watch you guys?
-Yes.

1213
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:24,083
Yeah?

1214
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,500
What about Open Pole Night?

1215
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:37,708
No.

1216
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,500
But you promised.

1217
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,000
-Promised what?
-To continue.

1218
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:45,625
-I promised to come to class.
-What did Michael Jordan say?

1219
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,750
-Never...
-Give up.

1220
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:50,166
Check this out.

1221
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,833
-You can do that.
-Yes...

1222
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,583
-We practiced it.
-Arms...

1223
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,041
-And the other one.
-Yeah.

1224
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:07,250
Come with us!

1225
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,833
You're so good!

1226
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:10,541
You're better at it!

1227
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,250
-No, I'm good.
-You can't just abandon us.

1228
01:13:13,333 --> 01:13:15,708
No, really. I'm done.

1229
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:19,583
-We worked on it together.
-But now...

1230
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,000
Come on.

1231
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:28,291
-We'll see.
-Okay, we'll see.

1232
01:13:28,375 --> 01:13:29,291
We'll see.

1233
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:53,291
IT'S OIL FREE!

1234
01:13:57,875 --> 01:14:00,041
IT'S NOT AS GOOD

1235
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:13,958
Nour!

1236
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:19,750
I just wanted to check on you, Nour.

1237
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,500
I just want to check on you.

1238
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:22,541
It's Farid.

1239
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,125
See how you're doing.

1240
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,583
Nour...

1241
01:14:29,791 --> 01:14:32,625
I've been neglecting you. I neglected you.

1242
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:34,250
I neglected you.

1243
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:39,083
I wanted to be the guy who dated girls
who were out of his league,

1244
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,583
but you and I, we belong together.

1245
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,333
We belong together, it's obvious.

1246
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:48,833
We get along, we complete
and respect each other.

1247
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,958
We're partners. Who's better at FIFA?

1248
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:53,083
-No one.
-Right! Why is that?

1249
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:55,791
Because we're so good,
we're partners. Right?

1250
01:14:56,458 --> 01:15:01,166
All this 'cause I wanted
to date girls better than you.

1251
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:04,750
I mean, physically, okay?

1252
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,166
It's not... You're enough for me.

1253
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:08,666
Look at how pretty you are.

1254
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:11,833
It's enough.

1255
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:14,375
-It's enough, I'm crazy.
-"Enough"?

1256
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:16,958
-Yeah, it's enough.
-Right, it's enough.

1257
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:20,541
Now it feels like home.

1258
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,625
-See?
-You're not dating that girl?

1259
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:24,666
She led me on, Nour.

1260
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:27,791
-Really?
-I wasn't myself, you'd have been shocked.

1261
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:30,166
I'd pick her up,

1262
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,916
drive her home, to the gym.

1263
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,375
I'd even buy her dinner. Me!

1264
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:35,750
-No way.
-And for what?

1265
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:38,625
The bitch was seeing another guy
the whole time.

1266
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,791
So, you were kind of like her lackey.

1267
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,041
-Why are you insulting me?
-I'm not.

1268
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,666
You are. I declare my love and you...

1269
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:48,708
I wouldn't use that term.

1270
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:51,250
You didn't really...
Wait, is that what you think?

1271
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:54,791
Of course. I declared my love.
I opened my heart.

1272
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:55,750
I see.

1273
01:15:55,833 --> 01:15:59,083
While what that bitch did,
that was disrespectful!

1274
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,916
-Yeah.
-No... It was humiliating.

1275
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:07,083
Humiliating, yes. That's what it was.

1276
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:09,750
Are you crying?

1277
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,416
Farid?

1278
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:21,791
Farid?

1279
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,375
You're not sleeping here.

1280
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:27,416
Get up.

1281
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,916
Come on.

1282
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:32,041
-I'm so glad.
-You'll be better over there.

1283
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:32,958
It's you...

1284
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:35,958
I love you.

1285
01:16:36,708 --> 01:16:37,791
Let's go.

1286
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,041
-Hey!
-Wait, hold on.

1287
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,708
-What's up?
-I thought you weren't speaking to us.

1288
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:53,666
-I wasn't speaking to you.
-And now, you're back?

1289
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:57,000
It's complicated. Wait.
I have to show you something.

1290
01:16:57,083 --> 01:17:00,750
You're gonna love it.
Look who's on my doorstep. There!

1291
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:02,916
Surprise!

1292
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,125
There you go!

1293
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:06,875
Are you back together?

1294
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,125
You think I want that?

1295
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,625
Look at him, he looks like a big oaf.
An oaf with an apple-eating girlfriend.

1296
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:13,833
Is he dead?

1297
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:16,791
No, he's dead drunk.
It's not exactly the same.

1298
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:19,125
He's completely wasted.

1299
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:20,541
Did you throw him out?

1300
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:21,958
I did, yes.

1301
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:24,416
I kicked him out.

1302
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,166
-Hold on a second.
-Finally!

1303
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,791
I kicked him out.

1304
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,958
Put some ice in his pants.
I love that. I'm coming over.

1305
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:36,375
No. Not right now.

1306
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,541
There's something I need to do.

1307
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,666
I'll send you an address
and I'll see you there tonight.

1308
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,500
-Okay.
-See you.

1309
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:44,416
See you later.

1310
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,375
Do you see anything?

1311
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:20,958
I don't see much lately. I'm old.

1312
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:22,375
It's not like before.

1313
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:27,500
Me too. Everything's blurry right now.

1314
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,416
Not great.

1315
01:18:35,416 --> 01:18:36,458
You smoke?

1316
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,333
Yes, I do. I smoke.

1317
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,333
And I drink sometimes.

1318
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,916
I almost got liposuction.

1319
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,500
That's my life, you see...

1320
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,875
Come out for a smoke.

1321
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,166
No, I'll stay here.

1322
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,166
It'd be nice if you came with me.

1323
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:02,166
Come with me, Mom. Please.

1324
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:14,458
-Where are we going?
-You'll see. Just enjoy.

1325
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,750
Here.

1326
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:20,500
Where are we going?

1327
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,666
Just go with it.

1328
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,833
-Let's go!
-Oh, God!

1329
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:30,000
I want to show you something.

1330
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:32,916
I did some research.

1331
01:19:33,208 --> 01:19:36,333
The pool dance is gonna be
at the Olympics.

1332
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:40,916
If my daughter does an Olympic sport,
I'll be so proud.

1333
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,333
Just so you know,
it's "pole dancing," not "pool dance."

1334
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:47,208
-Paul dancing.
-Yes, that's it.

1335
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:51,958
Like Paul Mc Cartney Paul Newman...
All the Pauls.

1336
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:53,750
-North Paul.
-Totem Paul.

1337
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:55,666
OPEN POLE NIGHT

1338
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:58,333
-Sorry, can I come in? I need to pee.
-Go ahead.

1339
01:19:58,416 --> 01:19:59,458
Thank you.

1340
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:12,916
Hello. I'm here for the show.

1341
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:17,458
It's... One of my friends is performing.

1342
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,416
Yes, I'm kinda early.

1343
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,708
This is Open Pole Night?

1344
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:25,666
Nour?

1345
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,500
Yes?

1346
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,250
Sorry, I must be in the wrong place.

1347
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,458
No.

1348
01:20:48,625 --> 01:20:50,333
Are you staying or leaving?

1349
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:52,666
Well, I'm gonna go. I...

1350
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:55,166
-I'm off.
-Yes, it's that way.

1351
01:20:57,458 --> 01:21:01,625
Would you like to have a drink
with me after the...

1352
01:21:01,708 --> 01:21:03,083
After the show?

1353
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:06,458
You're sweet. You're so cute, really.

1354
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:08,416
-But...
-It's okay, I get it.

1355
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,333
Have you ever gone
with a smaller man?

1356
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:19,958
No, I haven't.

1357
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,333
'Cause, honestly, it's worth a try.

1358
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:26,041
You know, they say opposites attract.

1359
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,291
Like yin and yang, or oxymorons.
Oxymorons are cool.

1360
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:32,083
-Do you like poetry?
-Love it.

1361
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:34,166
Oh, yeah? So...

1362
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:37,291
So, is that a yes? Maybe?

1363
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:39,375
Maybe.

1364
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,916
Okay, great.

1365
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,375
-So, I'm gonna go now.
-Okay.

1366
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,791
With a "maybe."

1367
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,458
I'm so nervous.

1368
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,625
It's gonna be okay, Nour.

1369
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:04,250
-Are you okay?
-So much pressure. I'm nervous.

1370
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,333
-Hi.
-Excuse me.

1371
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:08,458
I was struggling with Call of Duty.

1372
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:09,958
And my dog had to pee.

1373
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:12,000
-Hi, finally!
-Hold on a second.

1374
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,666
-Just wait, sorry.
-Sure.

1375
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:16,750
-Can I talk to you?
-Of course. What's up?

1376
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,541
Well, my mother is here. See?

1377
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:23,166
-The woman...
-That's great.

1378
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,291
She's sitting in the audience.

1379
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:28,833
Remember when I came to you
the first time,

1380
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:31,958
-'cause I needed help for my mom?
-Of course.

1381
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:34,708
It wasn't for my mother.

1382
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,083
-It was for me.
-Yes.

1383
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,041
I got that.

1384
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,458
You did, great.

1385
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,541
-Come on.
-I mean...

1386
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,833
I'm not that...

1387
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,500
No, I just wanted to be sure...

1388
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,666
You don't want me to say anything.

1389
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,708
No, never.

1390
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,416
I won't say a word.
Why aren't you dressed?

1391
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:54,750
I am.

1392
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:57,625
You are? Okay, fine, so let's go.

1393
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:00,416
-Is there something wrong?
-Ladies, get ready.

1394
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,291
If you're ready, go up the stairs.

1395
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,333
When the lights go out,
everyone to their pole.

1396
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,333
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1397
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,458
It's gonna be great.

1398
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,041
This is an Olympic sport?

1399
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:05,500
Come on, that's not pole dance dancing!

1400
01:25:06,208 --> 01:25:10,250
It is, Mom! It's pole dancing.
It's my style of pole dancing.

1401
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:13,541
If I want to dance, I do it.

1402
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,166
I'm doing what I want!

1403
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:45,333
That was great.

1404
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:46,291
-Really?
-Yes.

1405
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,041
-I liked it.
-You were the best.

1406
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,083
Beautiful.

1407
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,500
-I love it.
-Very interesting.

1408
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:54,958
And the twerking, girl. That was so cool.

1409
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:04,833
Excuse me.

1410
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:07,083
You were incredible!

1411
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:39,166
-You're here.
-Yes.

1412
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:44,250
I went by your gym
and they said you'd be here.

1413
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,333
-Cool. Who?
-Yes, it's...

1414
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:52,791
I didn't get everything.

1415
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:54,250
Yeah, that's Michelle.

1416
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,625
Okay.

1417
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:57,666
And...

1418
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:00,000
What is it?

1419
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:02,291
Nothing. I'm happy to see you.

1420
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:05,500
You were really good on stage.

1421
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:07,541
You were so beautiful.

1422
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:10,208
So, you like me?

1423
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,000
Well, yeah.

1424
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:14,791
And you like this too?

1425
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:16,083
Well, yeah, I do.

1426
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,583
Wait, you know what? Give me your number.

1427
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:28,583
I lost it. And my mom's here.

1428
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:31,833
It's hot in here.

1429
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:34,416
-Let's get some air.
-Yes.

1430
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,166
Look. He looks
just like Christian Clavier.

1431
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,083
There you go.

1432
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,541
-So, you'll call me?
-Yes, I...

1433
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,083
I'll call you.

1434
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,375
-You will?
-Promise.

1435
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:46,500
Okay.

1436
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:50,083
What is it?

1437
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:54,000
Just a little one, to see...

1438
01:27:54,458 --> 01:27:55,708
See how it feels?

1439
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:27,375
I'll go then?

1440
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:29,583
Damn.

1441
01:28:30,041 --> 01:28:30,916
Bye.

1442
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:11,166
What are you doing there? Come here.

1443
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:14,500
Okay.

1444
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,958
No, throw it away. We don't care.

1445
01:30:34,208 --> 01:30:35,458
And this too.

1446
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:49,333
Doesn't that feel good?

1447
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:50,875
Feels good, right?

1448
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:39,083
Flexibility. It's in your head.
