1
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,954
<i>Ray, where are you going?</i>

2
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:29,123
<i>Come back to bed.</i>

3
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,107
Watch it,
you miserable little...

4
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:33,307
Queenie!

5
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,646
'Morning, Walter!

6
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,942
Good girl. Their lawn
needed fertilizing anyway.

7
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,030
<i>I am your war machine</i>

8
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:34,368
<i>Yes, I am your ghetto scene</i>

9
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,914
<i>Well, I am</i>
<i>your love of money</i>

10
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:42,710
<i>'Cause I found me</i>
<i>a little honey</i>

11
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,004
<i>- I'm working for the machine</i>
- Good morning, Lieutenant.

12
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,338
Mrs Rumsfield.

13
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:48,924
Hi, Ricky.

14
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,514
<i>I'm working</i>
<i>for the machine, baby</i>

15
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,517
Oh, Mr Rumsfield, be careful.
Queenie...

16
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:03,897
- Goddam it.
- Uh-oh.

17
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,026
Walter. Walter!

18
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,738
<i>- Walter!</i>
- I love that dude.

19
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,240
- Walter! Walter!
- Mark!

20
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:17,828
What are you doing up?

21
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:22,583
Walter's dog just took a dump
on Rumsfield's lawn again.

22
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,085
Good, honey.

23
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,087
I know you're in there,
old man!

24
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,424
- Honey, honey, the neighbours.
- Listen up, mister.

25
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,593
That piece of scum,
barking rat of yours...

26
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:35,262
has just taken
his last dump on my lawn!

27
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:40,601
I find one more... just one... I'm gonna
catch him and staple his ass shut!

28
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,105
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- No, no, no! Honey, don't.

29
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,691
Come on. Let's go home.

30
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:54,114
Hey, honey, I think we should move.

31
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:00,788
We got an arms dealer across the street
and a crazy person down it.

32
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,790
All they do is fight.

33
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:05,125
Is this sweet enough?

34
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,628
Now these new next-door neighbours...
What is their name?

35
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:09,797
- The Klopeks?
- Mm-hmm.

36
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,467
- Is that a Slavic name?
- I don't know.

37
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,305
They've been here a month. Think they're
gonna do something about their yard?

38
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:24,144
Are you gonna eat any of this?

39
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:29,149
Oh, no. I got that thing
with my stomach again.

40
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:32,027
I wonder what was going on
over there last night.

41
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,489
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- What?

42
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:39,076
- Nothing.
- What did you know
was going to happen?

43
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,078
It's started already.
Look at you.

44
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,163
You're gonna sit around
all week doing nothing...

45
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:47,835
get bored out of your mind and go
back to work worse than you are now.

46
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,837
No, I'm not.

47
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,091
Please, let's pack up the car and go
to the lake. Just get away and rest.

48
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:58,012
You should see yourself. You were
up at dawn watching a dog poop.

49
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,347
You call going up
to the lake resting?

50
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:03,517
It is four hours of driving
on the tollway in holiday traffic...

51
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,811
to sit in some dank,
wet cabin...

52
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:07,813
and wait for that neighbour
with the enormous head...

53
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:09,315
to get drunk and fall down.

54
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:12,526
He's a hydrocephalic. I don't think
that you should make fun of him.

55
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,029
Honey,
that's not my idea of restful.

56
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:18,365
This is restful: Hanging around
the house, just being lazy.

57
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:21,702
That's what I want to do.
I just wanna... hang around.

58
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,704
Be lazy,
listen to the ball game...

59
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:26,665
and drink a couple hundred beers.

60
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,209
<i>Smoke an occasional cigar...</i>
<i>outside.</i>

61
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:32,379
I'll fix the barbecue in the backyard.
I'll do that.

62
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:36,216
This is what I need, Carol.
I need... this.

63
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,304
And at the end of the week,
I'll be a brand new human being.

64
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,640
It's your vacation.

65
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:12,127
Shh! Quiet.

66
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:26,266
Art's got a gun.

67
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:30,854
Art!

68
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:34,650
<i> Hey, hi, Ray.</i>
<i>Are you guys eatin'in there?</i>

69
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:37,695
You know how Suzette
is about her bird feeder.

70
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,863
These crows start showing up
out of nowhere.

71
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,865
She's all over my back
to get rid of'em.

72
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,201
"The crows are too big
for the bird feeder," she says.

73
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,870
- I don't remember seeing crows
around here before.
- Oh, big bastards too.

74
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,373
That's why I got the gun.
I'm gonna pop a few.

75
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,376
Why didn't you go with
Suzette to her mother's?

76
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,714
Hey, I'm eating here. Can you imagine me
and the two of them alone for a week?

77
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,882
I'd rather chew broken glass.

78
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:03,387
Uh-uh, this is gonna be a big week
for the bachelor kid.

79
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,472
<i>Vince.</i>

80
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:08,058
Vince.

81
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,102
How come you're not at work, Ray?

82
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,480
- I took the week off.
- A week off?

83
00:10:13,564 --> 00:10:16,066
That's great. Are you guys
going to the lake or something?

84
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,402
- No, the backyard.
- Backyard?

85
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,904
I just want to hang around
the house and relax.

86
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,908
Relax? Good luck with those maniacs
you got living next door.

87
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,578
- Have you met the Klopeks yet?
- No.

88
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,414
No, I haven't.
Nobody on the block has.

89
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,918
But I did talk to the real estate broad
that sold them the place.

90
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,839
Apparently, their last house
only burnt to the ground.

91
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:41,425
- Really?
- Yep.

92
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:46,055
A hideous, raging inferno.

93
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,266
Neighbours from hell.

94
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,437
Maybe.

95
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,274
Whatever it is, I'm glad I'm not
the one who lives right next door.

96
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:02,112
Come on, let's face it.
These Klopeks are strange.

97
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,281
I've been watching that house
ever since they moved in.

98
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:07,117
No one goes in.
No one comes out.

99
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,620
No visitors.
No deliveries.

100
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,664
What do you think
they're eatin', Ray?

101
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:16,627
Well, maybe these people
Just want to keep to themselves, Art.

102
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,796
Remember when the Knapps
lived next door?

103
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,131
How many conversations did you
have with the Knapps? I had two.

104
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,300
- Oh, come on.
- They didn't even say goodbye
when they moved.

105
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,970
Oh, please.
Don't even compare the two.

106
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,430
At least,
if they weren't conversational...

107
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:30,140
the Knapps were semi-normal.

108
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:33,060
They worked in their yard. They mowed
their lawn. They had a lawn to mow.

109
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:37,982
These Klopeks... We don't even know
how many of them there are.

110
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,150
<i>There are three of them.</i>

111
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:43,070
They only come out at night.

112
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:45,656
Ricky Butler says
they're nocturnal feeders.

113
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,241
Oh, Ricky Butler says.

114
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:50,744
Last week when I was up on the roof
with my telescope...

115
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:53,080
I saw them in their backyard.

116
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,959
- What were they doing, honey?
- Digging.

117
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,381
- Kind of like grave diggers?
- Maybe.

118
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:05,092
All right, that's enough
of this conversation.

119
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:09,096
I want you to stop spying on the Klopeks
with Ricky Butler.

120
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,267
And I'd like you to stop filling
his head with such half-cocked theories.

121
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,438
- Where you goin'?
- I'm gonna change into my vacation togs.

122
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:19,606
Are you done with your eggs?

123
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:26,113
I'm gonna mix the zinnias in
with the rest of the flowers.

124
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:28,115
The man at the nursery said...

125
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:32,411
- Boy, that really burns my ass.
- What?

126
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:37,750
<i> That old fart.</i>
<i>He's got the best lawn on the block.</i>

127
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:42,796
And you know why?

128
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,135
Because he trains his dog
to crap in my yard.

129
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:53,849
Hey, Mrs Rumsfield.

130
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,518
No tan lines this morning.

131
00:12:56,602 --> 00:13:00,481
<i>Looks nice.</i>

132
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:03,901
That kid next door is a meatball.

133
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:11,241
<i>Peterson.</i>

134
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,496
He came out in his robe last night when
the foreigners were making that racket.

135
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,623
He didn't do one thing.

136
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:22,336
So, what are you gonna do first?

137
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:24,338
I don't know.

138
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,007
- Hey, did I show you my new tools?
- No.

139
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:29,510
These are great.

140
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,680
Carol's father gave them
to me for Christmas.

141
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:35,349
Huh?

142
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:39,019
- Look.
- Oh, those are beauties.

143
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,897
- You gonna build something with those?
- I think so.

144
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:44,900
<i>Probably.</i>

145
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:48,028
Hey, what time does
the ball game go on?

146
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:50,281
I think it's at about 1:00.

147
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,658
<i>You want to go down to the deli</i>
<i>and get one of those beef sandwiches?</i>

148
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:56,704
<i>No. I'm thinking of getting one of</i>
<i>those electric garage door openers...</i>

149
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:59,707
<i>And installing it.</i>

150
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,300
Ray. Ray!

151
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,385
<i>Ray, come here.</i>

152
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:19,101
What is it?

153
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:24,398
It's my neighbour.

154
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:31,030
Hey, one of the Huns
came out of the cave.

155
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:07,941
Why don't you go say hi?

156
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,612
Well, yeah, I guess I could.

157
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:14,615
This would be
the perfect time.

158
00:15:14,698 --> 00:15:18,035
If you go talk to him,
we could see what he's like. Go.

159
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,454
You could say hi to him too.

160
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,915
- But he's your neighbour.
- No, he's your neighbour as well.

161
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:25,292
But you share a property line with him.

162
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,962
We're all on the same block,
so you could go too.

163
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:31,131
We're all in the same town,
but you're next to him.

164
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:33,467
<i>If he was gonna borrow anything,</i>
<i>he'd come over to your place.</i>

165
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,178
<i>Well, he's busy now.</i>

166
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,764
He's not busy. Now he's goin' in.
Go now because if...

167
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:43,519
<i>He's going back in. If you were</i>
<i>gonna say hi, you should probably...</i>

168
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:46,063
He's going into the house.
You're gonna lose him.

169
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,482
<i>He's gonna go in...</i>

170
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,818
- Now you've blown it, haven't you?
- No, I didn't blow it.

171
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:52,987
- Chicken. Chicken.
- He went into his house.

172
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,322
I'm not chicken because
he went into his house.

173
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:58,909
You look like a chicken in front of
your son and everything. Your son.

174
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,911
Come on.

175
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:04,540
- If it's suddenly a big deal,
let's just go say hello.
- Hey, hey, it's a joke!

176
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:06,542
- Let's say hello.
- Why so edgy?

177
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,544
- Come on, come on.
- Try decaf.

178
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:11,505
They're daring each other
to ring the doorbell.

179
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,800
We shouldn't stare like this.

180
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,511
Why don't we both go say hello,
or are you chicken?

181
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:19,638
Go for it, Mr Peterson!
Yes!

182
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:23,851
<i>- Whoo!</i>
- Now everybody's watching us.

183
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,853
<i>- Good going, man!</i>
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

184
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:29,023
I'll go in with you.
Sure. No problem.

185
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:31,525
Let's go.

186
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,063
<i> There's bars</i>
<i>on the basement windows.</i>

187
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,567
- They got holes in their porch too.
<i>- That was a booby trap.</i>

188
00:17:13,651 --> 00:17:15,569
- You okay?
- Yeah.

189
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,238
- I'm not gonna pay for that.
- We shouldn't pay for that.
We should sue them.

190
00:17:18,322 --> 00:17:23,577
Well, um, let's...
Let's say hello.

191
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:43,597
Hey.

192
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,729
Get the hose. Hang on, men!

193
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,404
Run to me! Run to water!

194
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,868
Ray, over here! Run to water!

195
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,997
<i>Run to me! Come on!</i>

196
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,812
<i> I think they're gone, Mark.</i>
<i>I think they're gone!</i>

197
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:34,648
- You men hit?
- I cannot believe you did that.

198
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,817
- Neither can I.
- I cannot believe it! That was great.

199
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,653
The same thing happened to me
last week. I was over there.

200
00:18:39,737 --> 00:18:42,990
It wasn't bees though.
It was a foaming squirrel.

201
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:50,456
In Southeast Asia, we'd call
this type of thing "bad karma."

202
00:19:14,313 --> 00:19:17,691
<i> Honey, bee stings don't</i>
<i>heal if you keep playing with them.</i>

203
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:21,028
<i> If we had gone to the lake,</i>
<i>I'd have twice as many of these.</i>

204
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:25,532
<i>- It isn't like</i>
<i>anything you said is coming true.</i>
<i>- Where are you going?</i>

205
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:27,868
<i>I can't walk away without you</i>
<i>asking where I'm going?</i>

206
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:31,538
<i>I'm going to Paris, France.</i>
<i>I'm going to Banff, Canada, all right?</i>

207
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:33,707
- That's where I'm going.
<i>- Are you taking the dog?</i>

208
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,377
Yeah, yeah.
I'm taking the dog for a walk.

209
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,055
No, wait, wait, wait.

210
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:50,891
Hey, Vince, let's go
over here, huh?

211
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:53,060
Let's not go that way tonight.

212
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:57,231
Here's a nice yard.
It's a good yard.

213
00:19:57,314 --> 00:19:59,358
Hey, you with the dog!

214
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,737
<i> Hey, keep that mutt</i>
<i>off my lawn, will ya?</i>

215
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:05,739
All right.
Have a field day.

216
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:11,537
He comes here to smoke cigars.
His wife won't let him.
He doesn't know I know that.

217
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,039
Hi, Ray.
How ya doin', bud?

218
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,875
- Hey, there, Mr Peterson.
- Good to see you.

219
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:19,878
- Wouldn't need a lighter, would you?
- Thanks.

220
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:24,049
- It is a lovely night, isn't it?
- Yeah, green sky tonight.

221
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:30,723
Green sky at morning:
Neighbour take warning.

222
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:36,562
Green sky at night?

223
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:39,815
Neighbour take flight.

224
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:46,405
Did you ever see the movie
<i>The Sentinel,</i> Mr Peterson?

225
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,407
It's about the old guy
who owned the apartment...

226
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,619
which is kind of like
the gateway to hell.

227
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:54,913
No, I didn't see that.

228
00:20:54,997 --> 00:21:00,294
Oh, well,
I was doing some thinking.

229
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:04,757
And, you know, being that their
last house burned down and all...

230
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,761
it's like, maybe,
somebody left the gate open.

231
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:16,435
It's them.
They're movin' around again.

232
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:20,939
It was a night just like this
that it happened.

233
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,942
What happened,
Mr Weingartner?

234
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:26,445
It was a long time ago.
Hinkley Hills was a lot smaller then.

235
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:31,784
Safer too. You never had to lock
your doors. Everybody knew everybody.

236
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:35,287
I must have been maybe
nine, ten years old.

237
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:38,290
- You know where the big mall is?
- Yeah.

238
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,459
There used to be a big drugstore
on the corner there.

239
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,629
- It had a big soda fountain. Remember?
- Yeah.

240
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:46,799
The guy who ran it was a rotund guy,
had glasses.

241
00:21:46,882 --> 00:21:49,468
His name was Skip.
Lived over on Elm.

242
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:52,805
Had a wife, a couple kids.
Not too sharp.

243
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:56,475
The guy's 40 years old, he's wearing
a paper hat and making cherry Cokes.

244
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,144
It's a cinch he's not
running for governor, right?

245
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,647
Anyway, it got hot that summer.

246
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,816
It got real hot.
It was sweltering.

247
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:06,485
That heat where your unde<i>rw</i>ear sweats
and it crawls up the...

248
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,487
Anyway, it's hot, okay?

249
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:13,158
And they start smelling
this really vile stench over on Elm...

250
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:15,995
and they figure it's comin'
from Skip's place.

251
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:17,997
No one wants to say anything.

252
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,332
Do you knock on the guy's door,
"Hi, your house stinks"?

253
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,002
So people are trying
to ignore it, right?

254
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:26,672
They're trying to pretend it isn't
happening. You know those pine things?

255
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:28,841
They're trying to cover up with those
pine things that you can put in cars.

256
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:32,011
People are hanging those
on their porches.

257
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:37,516
- Oh, you think that's funny, Ricky?
- Well, yeah.

258
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,852
Let me tell you
what happened next.

259
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:43,355
The state health inspector shows up.
They talk to Skip.

260
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,524
He says he's got a sump pump problem.
They leave.

261
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:47,818
The guy's got a sewer problem.
He says he'll look after it.

262
00:22:47,901 --> 00:22:49,695
Everything's okay, right?

263
00:22:49,778 --> 00:22:51,697
Wrong.
A couple hours later...

264
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,074
there's smoke pouring out
of the windows of Skip's house.

265
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:56,201
- The firemen go in. Know what they find?
- What?

266
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:58,871
Skip's family, dead.
Murdered...

267
00:22:58,954 --> 00:23:02,583
by Skip... weeks earlier...
with an ice pick.

268
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,753
<i>Yeah, the guy killed</i>
<i>his whole family...</i>

269
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:09,381
With an ice pick.

270
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,719
Yeah. Yeah, just put 'em
in the cool basement...

271
00:23:13,802 --> 00:23:18,390
covered 'em up with a sheet and went
back to makin' treats for the townsfolk.

272
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:23,062
Only Skip didn't count on there
being a big heat wave that summer.

273
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:26,899
You know what all those people
were smelling on Elm, Ricky?

274
00:23:26,982 --> 00:23:29,068
What?

275
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:31,403
Skip's family's bodies...

276
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:35,074
decomposing in the summer heat.

277
00:23:35,157 --> 00:23:38,243
Apparently, one day Skip made
Just one-too-many lemon phosphates.

278
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:41,497
El snappo.

279
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:47,461
I remember that. I remember
hearing about that when I was a kid.

280
00:23:47,544 --> 00:23:52,508
They-They tore down
the soda fountain that fall.

281
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:56,095
These towns are full of those stories.
They're happening right under your nose.

282
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:58,180
You know, speaking of noses...

283
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,933
ever since this family
has moved to this block...

284
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:04,603
I've been noticing
a weird kind of odour.

285
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:06,939
Kind of like death.

286
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:15,155
Jump a little higher, Spud Webb.

287
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,616
- Oh, slam dunk!
- Sorry, Mr Peterson. It was a mistake.

288
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,618
- Well, it wasn't a mistake.
- Don't apologize.

289
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:22,037
- I'm goin' home.
- Oh, come on.

290
00:24:22,121 --> 00:24:25,708
- Don't be a weenie. It was a joke!
- I'm sorry, Mr Peterson.

291
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:30,170
I'm gonna go do something productive.
I'm gonna go watch televisión.

292
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:33,465
<i>The answer is:</i>

293
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,467
- What is Lincoln's birthday.
<i>- Addley?</i>

294
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:37,469
<i>- What is Memorial Day?</i>
<i>- Memorial Day is it. Select.</i>

295
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,471
They combined Lincoln's birthday
with Washington's. It's one weekend now.

296
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,473
- It's always flip-flopping.
- It's one weekend now.

297
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:43,976
<i>"Remain calm, float with arms stretched</i>
<i>out at right angles to the body..."</i>

298
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,895
That's what you used to say to me
in college, right?

299
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:51,650
- What about your parents?
- They're not home 'til Thursday.

300
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:58,657
Gail, I swear to God, this is
better than anything on televisión.

301
00:24:58,741 --> 00:25:01,660
- Why can't we go to a movie?
- "A movie"?

302
00:25:01,744 --> 00:25:04,330
That's not real.
It's the same as televisión.

303
00:25:04,413 --> 00:25:06,999
Trust me.
This is real.

304
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:09,460
This is my neighbourhood.

305
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,340
<i>Here he comes, right on schedule.</i>

306
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:20,137
God, I love this street.

307
00:25:30,773 --> 00:25:32,733
Ray.

308
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:34,735
- What?
- Who was Mussolini?

309
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,737
"How sweet it is" was, uh...

310
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,864
<i>- Right again.</i>
<i>- Business and Industry for 200.</i>

311
00:25:38,948 --> 00:25:41,367
<i> In the McDonald's</i>
<i>corporate think tank, executives...</i>

312
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,036
- Art, we're watching the show.
- What does he want?

313
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:48,207
I don't know. But I'll be back
in time for Final Jeopardy.

314
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,459
<i>Nebraskans for 1,000, please.</i>

315
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:55,172
<i>Okay, the show's started. Check it out.</i>

316
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,801
You see the guy with the curly hair?
That's Mr Peterson.

317
00:25:58,884 --> 00:26:02,262
<i>He's this sceptic.</i>
<i>He's basically grounded in reality...</i>

318
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:05,099
<i>and he doesn't want to believe</i>
<i>his neighbours are up to</i>
<i>something strange.</i>

319
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:08,268
<i>'Cause if they were,</i>
<i>he'd have to deal with it.</i>

320
00:26:08,352 --> 00:26:11,981
Okay, now see the fat guy?
That's Mr Weingartner.

321
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:14,108
<i>He thinks the Klopeks</i>
<i>are really evil...</i>

322
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,777
<i>and that they're building</i>
<i>a dungeon in their basement.</i>

323
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,948
<i>He and Mr Rumsfield decided</i>
<i>to do a little snooping tonight.</i>

324
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:23,033
<i>This should be good.</i>

325
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:26,787
Shh, shh, shh.

326
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:35,462
- What is this?
- It's an infrared scope.

327
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:38,215
<i>Snipers use it</i>
<i>for night visión.</i>

328
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,967
What are we gonna do with it?

329
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,969
Get a look in those
barred-up basement windows.

330
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:44,138
Come here.

331
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,977
I've been thinking about it. I don't
think we should go through with this.

332
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,478
Are you a 'fraidy cat?

333
00:26:51,562 --> 00:26:54,481
No, I just think things
have gone off the deep end.

334
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:58,819
Infrared night visión scopes? What
are we gonna do next, tap their phone?

335
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:00,821
That can be arranged.

336
00:27:00,904 --> 00:27:03,657
Then all we have to do is burn
a cross on their front lawn.

337
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,159
Shh.

338
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:08,162
- Quiet.
- You hear that?

339
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:10,164
I thought that was just me.

340
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:13,000
- It's a low-frequency hum or something.
- It's getting louder.

341
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,669
Listen.

342
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:18,505
Is that a transformer
or something?

343
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:20,507
The goddam power company.

344
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:24,345
But I can't...
Where is it coming from?

345
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:27,931
I know where it's coming from.

346
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:01,382
Wow.

347
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:03,717
What the hell was that?

348
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,219
Brownout.

349
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:08,222
Smells like they're cooking
a goddam cat over there.

350
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:12,351
- I'm gonna go find out what exactly...
- Get down, get down!

351
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:36,917
No headlights.

352
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,682
I can see the news report now:

353
00:30:14,765 --> 00:30:18,352
"They were a quiet family.
Kept pretty much to themselves.

354
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:23,023
No one would have ever
suspected them of foul play."

355
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,031
I've never seen anybody drive
their garbage to the street...

356
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:33,033
and then bang the hell
out of it with a stick.

357
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:35,953
I've never seen that.

358
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:45,212
I say we get a look
in those garbage cans.

359
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:49,216
Call me overly cautious, but don't
you think that's a bit suspicious?

360
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,720
The three of us going through
their garbage at 11:00 at night
in the middle of a rainstorm?

361
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:56,056
Affirmative.
That garbage is going nowhere.

362
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,059
I say we wait 'til first light.
Scope me.

363
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:01,895
I'm outta here.

364
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,734
Rain delay.

365
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:09,862
Bummer.

366
00:31:19,163 --> 00:31:24,918
Ray, what was that you were saying the
other day about half-cocked theories?

367
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:27,921
Ray... sleep tight.

368
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:37,491
No way Wednesday night.
I'm in a league.

369
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:41,662
This seminar could change your life,
Vic. The man is a great healer.

370
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:44,832
And I'm a great bowler. Wednesday night
we're taking on Roselli Plumbing.

371
00:32:44,915 --> 00:32:47,334
You should expose yourself
to this guy, Vic.

372
00:32:47,418 --> 00:32:50,170
He understands paraphysical forces...

373
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:54,508
the healing capabilities of crystals
and the laying on of hands.

374
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,553
You wanna try laying on some hands?

375
00:32:57,636 --> 00:33:00,514
Wait! Hold it, garbies!
Garbies!

376
00:33:00,597 --> 00:33:03,851
Garbagemen! Hold on a minute!
Wait a sec!

377
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:07,688
<i>Wait! Wait! Wait!</i>
<i>Hold it! What are you doin'?</i>

378
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:10,024
- I'm emptying garbage.
- Are you outta your mind?

379
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:12,568
Give me that!

380
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:16,113
- Hey, cut that out!
- There's nothing here.

381
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:18,866
Not a finger, not a nose,
nothing!

382
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:21,201
- Give me that.
- Here you go.

383
00:33:21,285 --> 00:33:24,371
- What are you doin'?
- You asked me to help.

384
00:33:24,455 --> 00:33:26,373
Who you calling?

385
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,709
I'm calling the Delvaneys
and having them open the cottage.

386
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:31,378
No, Carol.
I don't want to go to the cottage.

387
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:34,214
Fine. Then Dave and I will go
and you can stay here and spy.

388
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:36,216
Oh, all right. Okay.

389
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,553
- What? What? Are you sulking now?
- No, go up to the cottage!

390
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:42,056
Take Dave and go to the cottage.
Leave me to pad around the house.

391
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:44,224
"Pad around the house"? All you do
is pal around the neighbourhood...

392
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:46,560
- That's my vacation.
- With those two chuckleheads.

393
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:48,896
<i>- I am very, very worried about you.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

394
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:51,732
<i>- You're acting like...</i>
<i>- What am I acting like, Carol?</i>

395
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:53,734
- Like a guy who's on vacation!
- Like this!

396
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,736
- This is not someone on vacation!
- See? I sleep late!

397
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:57,738
- Get a tan then!
- In my pyjamas?

398
00:33:57,821 --> 00:34:00,074
- Fix the barbecue! I don't know!
- Look, look!

399
00:34:00,157 --> 00:34:02,409
You go to the cottage and get a tan!
Take David with you!

400
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:05,412
I don't care! I'll eat takeout!
I'll do the laundry myself!

401
00:34:05,496 --> 00:34:07,665
I'll vacuum the house!
It'll be spotless!

402
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:09,750
Art's throwing garbage
all over the street.

403
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:13,170
Your mom and I are having
a conversation! If you... What?

404
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:17,257
Get out of the truck! Are you nuts?

405
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:19,426
Hey, it's gotta be in here somewhere.

406
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,762
The Supreme Court ruled
that a person's garbage...

407
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:24,098
- is public domain
the minute it hits the kerb.
- Shut up.

408
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:26,100
Did you guys pick up
a Hefty bag out of that yard...

409
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:28,644
that was bulky
and probably a little moist?

410
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:31,939
- What is wrong with these people?
- He has a right to know, Vic.

411
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:35,609
Don't start up with me. Hey, could you
help me get this guy out of here?

412
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:37,611
Hey, Art.
What's happening?

413
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:44,118
No! Ray!
Ray, come back here!

414
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:46,328
Just one... I'll be...
Yeah.

415
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:48,622
My taxes pay your salary!

416
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:50,958
I don't want to hear
any of your bullshit either!

417
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:53,127
The question here is garbage
and who picks up this mess.

418
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,629
<i>"Who picks up this mess"?</i>

419
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:59,800
You're gonna pick up the mess
because you are a garbageman.

420
00:34:59,883 --> 00:35:02,303
I pick up garbage in cans,
not from the street!

421
00:35:02,386 --> 00:35:04,471
Ray, there's nothing in here.

422
00:35:04,555 --> 00:35:07,474
<i>We practically checked</i>
<i>this whole truck.</i>
<i>They must have switched on us.</i>

423
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:09,560
<i>- The F.B.I.?</i>
<i>- No, the Klopeks.</i>

424
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:14,440
Oh, no. Naughty little puppy.

425
00:35:16,358 --> 00:35:20,821
Uncle Markie gets very upset
when you're on his lawn.

426
00:35:20,904 --> 00:35:25,492
Wait a minute.
You're all dirty, and you're shaking.

427
00:35:25,576 --> 00:35:28,996
I wonder if Walter
knows you're outside.

428
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,165
- In the rain?
- Yeah, it was raining.

429
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,667
- There were how many of them?
- Well, uh, three.

430
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:36,170
And what were they doing?

431
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:38,339
- They were diggin'.
- Digging! Like grave diggers!

432
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:40,341
- I told you! They're ghouls!
- No, I didn't say that.

433
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:41,842
They could have been digging
for anything.

434
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,178
They could have been digging
for night crawlers.

435
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:47,514
- Night crawlers?
- They're fishermen. They need bait.

436
00:35:47,598 --> 00:35:49,516
- Wake up and smell the coffee!
- Shh.

437
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,187
The kid spotted us last night.
When we were sleeping, he got up.

438
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,190
He went to the garbage can,
he took the body and then he...

439
00:35:56,273 --> 00:36:00,027
He buried him in the backyard.

440
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:03,072
- Let's get outta here.
- I like this.

441
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,699
I hate cul-de-sacs. There's only
one way out, and the people are weird.

442
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:08,953
Naked ladies.

443
00:36:10,788 --> 00:36:14,375
Does anyone know if Walter
left a spare key around anywhere?

444
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:19,171
He must have gone away
and forgot to feed Queenie.

445
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:24,385
- Walter!
- I hope nothing happened to him.

446
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:27,721
- I think we should call the police.
- Oh, good plan, Ray.

447
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:30,724
I think I see something
moving in there.

448
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:37,564
How did you get in there?

449
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:42,736
A soldier's way saves the day.
<i>Entrez.</i>

450
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,240
<i>- Good, honey.</i>
- Beautiful.

451
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:48,742
- Walter?
<i>- What's been going on here?</i>

452
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:51,078
- This doesn't look good.
<i>- Murder, my friend.</i>

453
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:53,580
- Murder?
- There are signs of a struggle here.

454
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:56,083
The TV's still on.
Chairs turned over.

455
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,752
I wouldn't say that's
a sign of a struggle.

456
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:01,588
I think I should go
upstairs and check this out.

457
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:04,258
Maybe the guy's upstairs
in a bathtub or something...

458
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:07,594
cracked his head open,
there's blood everywhere...

459
00:37:07,678 --> 00:37:09,930
Just don't touch anything
up there, all right?

460
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:12,766
Yes, sir, Mr Peterson.

461
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,769
Let's see if we can find
some dog food.

462
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:19,607
I don't like this. I don't like
snooping around a neighbour's house.

463
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:22,610
You mean a dead guy's house?

464
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:25,112
You wanna take that
out of your pocket?

465
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:27,948
- You wanna not steal that
from Walter's house?
- Hey, what's the difference?

466
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:30,868
All this junk is gonna end up
in a flea market sooner or later.

467
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:34,288
<i> He might have left in a hurry</i>
<i>and forgot about the dog.</i>

468
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:36,790
Okay, stay right here,
and we'll find your dish.

469
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:39,335
<i>- Old people space out sometimes.</i>

470
00:37:39,418 --> 00:37:41,670
Bull's-eye!

471
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:43,672
What, what, what?

472
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:45,716
A dead rat!
There!

473
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:48,636
Honey, that's not a rat.

474
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,638
That's Walter's toupee.

475
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:53,474
Beautiful place to keep a toupee:
On the stove.

476
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:55,476
I'm starving.

477
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:58,479
One thing about these old guys:

478
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:01,649
They don't ever leave the house
without their hair.

479
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:04,318
No, sir.

480
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,824
Walter left this house
in a big hurry.

481
00:38:10,908 --> 00:38:14,161
<i>Hey, you guys, look!</i>
<i>These cookies are...</i>

482
00:38:14,244 --> 00:38:16,664
<i>- That's great! Everybody out!</i>
- Great, Ricky.

483
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:19,166
I think we've broken
enough laws for one day.

484
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,335
- Hey, sorry, but we have not looked...
- Let's just get outta here.

485
00:38:21,418 --> 00:38:23,337
It's not against the law
to break cookies.

486
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,339
I can't believe you people
talked me into this.

487
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:28,217
Why don't we just get out
of our neighbour's house?

488
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,844
"Walter, your dog is at my house.

489
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:34,515
Your window is broken
because we all thought that..."

490
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:44,358
"Walter... I have your dog.

491
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:47,528
Ray."

492
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:05,379
Mr Klopek!

493
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:07,381
Mr Klopek, hi.
Ray Peterson.

494
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:09,383
<i>Listen, I was w...</i>

495
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:22,396
What is this doggy-gram? This just
came for you. It might be important.

496
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:25,899
Come here. Save some for your friend.
Right there. Go on.

497
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:29,236
- Honey, have you seen your father?
- I think he's in the basement with Art.

498
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,405
He's playing canasta or something.

499
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:37,745
Honey?

500
00:39:37,828 --> 00:39:40,414
Ray!

501
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:44,418
Art, you had a dream you were gonna win
the lottery. You blew $500 on tickets.

502
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:46,420
<i> I can't believe</i>
<i>you're still bringing that up.</i>

503
00:39:46,503 --> 00:39:49,256
You had a dream a plane
was gonna crash,
so you took the bus to Las Vegas.

504
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,425
If I had been on the plane,
it would have crashed.

505
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:54,094
This wasn't a dream.
This was a visión.

506
00:39:54,178 --> 00:39:56,096
These people are Satanists.
They are Satanists.

507
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,598
This is all gibberish.

508
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:00,267
Look, the worid is full
of these kind of things. Look at this.

509
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:03,562
Black masses, mutilations.
Mutilations!

510
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:08,567
The incubus, the succubus. I'm telling
you, Walter was a human sacrifice.

511
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:11,278
I should have gone to the lake.

512
00:40:11,362 --> 00:40:13,447
I should have listened to Carol.

513
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,284
Listen to your wife? Who listens
to their wife? You gotta listen to me.

514
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:20,788
We gotta go down
to the religious supply store.

515
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:22,957
We gotta get ourselves
a couple of gallons of holy water.

516
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,292
My cousin is a priest.
He can get us a deal.

517
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:27,628
- Then we gotta go to the market.
- I don't want to hear this.

518
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:31,799
- We gotta get big strings of garlic.
- I'm not gonna listen.

519
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:35,386
- We gotta get some fresh lamb's blood.
- I'm not going to hear this.

520
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,471
Ray, do you want 'em
to take your family, kidnap 'em...

521
00:40:37,554 --> 00:40:40,140
tear their livers out
and make some satanic pate?

522
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:42,810
I'm not going to hear this.
I'm not going to listen.

523
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:46,146
Ray, you're chanting. Ray.

524
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,401
Ray, look. Ray.
Unconscious chanting. You're chanting.

525
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,987
I want to kill everyone.

526
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,906
Satan is good.
Satan is our pal.

527
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,327
Ray, Ray, you're chanting.
Hey.

528
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:05,666
Once they get in here,
it's over, pal.

529
00:41:07,876 --> 00:41:10,337
Satanists, huh?

530
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:13,257
Ritual killers?

531
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,011
Nice.
Very, very nice.

532
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:19,179
So let me get this straight.

533
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:25,060
The Klopeks are offering up Walter
as a human sacrifice to Beelzebub?

534
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:27,354
That's one of the theories.
Yeah.

535
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:31,525
Mm-hmm.
Great, great.

536
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:35,362
So this is your relaxing
week at home, huh?

537
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,865
I wouldn't have missed this
for the worid.

538
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:40,826
- A week in Jonestown.
- Where are you going?

539
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:42,828
To the bathroom.

540
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:45,247
Relax.

541
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:13,901
What is it?

542
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:33,712
<i>Shut it off! No!</i>

543
00:43:04,034 --> 00:43:05,953
Carol?

544
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:18,632
Carol?

545
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:25,472
Carol?

546
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:50,664
<i>Ray.</i>

547
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:54,001
Ray.

548
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:59,673
It was so nice of you to invite
the new neighbours over for a barbecue.

549
00:44:07,932 --> 00:44:10,184
Ow.

550
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:15,356
<i>Satan is good. Satan is our pal.</i>

551
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,858
<i>I want to kill everyone.</i>

552
00:44:17,942 --> 00:44:20,319
<i>Satan is good.</i>
<i>Satan is our pal.</i>

553
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:33,666
<i>Oh, Ray Peterson...</i>

554
00:44:33,749 --> 00:44:35,668
<i>whatever you do...</i>

555
00:44:35,751 --> 00:44:38,629
don't let them do to you...

556
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:41,548
what they did to me.

557
00:44:41,632 --> 00:44:43,801
Ooh, I bet that hurts, huh?

558
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:55,062
Hey, hey, hey!

559
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:58,399
Who the heck ordered the blood shake?

560
00:44:58,482 --> 00:45:02,736
Hey, Ray. It's not Skip. It's me, Art.
I'm just pretending to be Skip.

561
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,239
You didn't happen to see an ice pick
around here, did you?

562
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:10,911
<i>Mind your own business.</i>

563
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:15,082
Mind your own business!

564
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:20,254
Okay!

565
00:45:20,504 --> 00:45:23,090
It's a beautiful day
in this neighbourhood

566
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:25,592
It's a beautiful day
for a neighbour

567
00:45:25,676 --> 00:45:29,430
Would you be mine
Could you be mine

568
00:45:29,513 --> 00:45:31,932
<i>It's a neighbourly day</i>
<i>in this beauty wood</i>

569
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:34,268
<i>A neighbourly day</i>
<i>for a beauty</i>

570
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:38,439
<i>Would you be mine</i>
<i>Could you be mine</i>

571
00:45:38,522 --> 00:45:41,609
<i>I have always wanted</i>
<i>to have a neighbour</i>

572
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,611
<i>Just like you</i>

573
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:45,613
<i>I've always wanted to live</i>

574
00:45:45,696 --> 00:45:48,949
<i>In the neighbourhood with you</i>

575
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:54,622
<i>So let's make the most</i>
<i>of this beautiful day</i>

576
00:45:54,705 --> 00:45:58,292
<i>Since we're together</i>
<i>I might as well say</i>

577
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,961
<i>Would you be mine</i>
<i>Could you be mine</i>

578
00:46:01,045 --> 00:46:04,298
<i>Won't you be my neighbour</i>

579
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:08,969
<i>Won't you please</i>
<i>Won't you please</i>

580
00:46:09,053 --> 00:46:12,973
<i>Please, won't you be</i>
<i>my neighbour</i>

581
00:46:13,057 --> 00:46:17,269
Hey, Ray!
Ray, we got a plan! Come on.

582
00:46:17,353 --> 00:46:21,565
We got a plan.
Come on. We got...

583
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:24,902
Sorry, boys. My husband's not feeling
well. He has to stay in his room.

584
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:27,321
- Ooh, he was bad.
- Come on.

585
00:46:27,404 --> 00:46:29,365
Please, Carol, let him come out.

586
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:31,992
<i>Come on.</i>

587
00:46:32,076 --> 00:46:35,329
He can't come out until he resembles
the man that I married.

588
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:39,041
- We don't have that kind of time.
- Please let him come out.

589
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:42,378
I think that I have
given you my answer.

590
00:47:05,442 --> 00:47:10,531
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The bees came from there.

591
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:14,201
- Watch this hole.
- Okay, let's try the side door.

592
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:30,718
Okay, do it.

593
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:35,389
Do what?
We agreed to do it together.

594
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:09,423
Ray. Ray.

595
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:11,425
I'm only trying to take a nap.

596
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:13,427
I'm only laying here
with my eyes closed...

597
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,429
trying to get some goddam sleep.

598
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:17,765
Quiet, quiet, quiet. I wouldn't wake you
if it wasn't important.

599
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:19,767
- I think we flushed 'em out.
- Okay.

600
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,268
The Klopeks.

601
00:48:21,352 --> 00:48:23,771
- Rumsfield and I, we flushed 'em out.
- How?

602
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:25,940
We wrote a note.
We slipped it under their door.

603
00:48:26,023 --> 00:48:28,108
- We rang the bell, and then we ran.
- You did that?

604
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:31,612
- Yeah.
- Oh, geez! Stupid idi...

605
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:33,614
I can't believe you...

606
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,620
All I did was write,
"I know what you've done."

607
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:42,957
- I didn't sign it or anything.
- Oh, I can't... You stupid...

608
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,460
- Why didn't you... God!
- You gotta goose these people.

609
00:48:46,543 --> 00:48:50,130
You gotta give them a little shot,
let 'em know that you're there.

610
00:48:50,214 --> 00:48:52,466
Good dog, Vince.
Go get it.

611
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:55,469
Here's the thing, Art.
They're gonna think I did it.

612
00:48:55,552 --> 00:48:57,972
- Why?
- The old guy saw me write a note...

613
00:48:58,055 --> 00:48:59,974
and put it under Walter's door.

614
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:02,643
So they're gonna think
that I did it!

615
00:49:02,726 --> 00:49:06,230
You wrote a note and put it under the...
I didn't know that.

616
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,024
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>'cause we got 'em on the run now.</i>

617
00:49:09,108 --> 00:49:11,026
Now they know that we know
that they know that we know!

618
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,905
Yes, it does matter! You did it,
but they're gonna suspect me!

619
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:17,324
They're not gonna suspect anybody.
They're...

620
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:30,004
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a bone.

621
00:49:30,087 --> 00:49:34,341
- It's a femur.
- It's a femur bone.

622
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:41,348
A femur just happens to be
a human thigh bone, Ray.

623
00:49:41,432 --> 00:49:45,019
- Wait, how do you know that?
- Biology 101.

624
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:48,355
Look at the size of this thing.

625
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:50,858
Think this came off
a chicken or something?

626
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:53,360
Where the hell did Vince get this?

627
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,411
<i> He dug it up</i>
<i>from underneath the fence.</i>

628
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:11,170
Ray. Ray,
there's no doubt any more.

629
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:15,049
This is real.
Your neighbours are murdering people.

630
00:50:15,132 --> 00:50:19,887
They're chopping 'em up.
They're burying 'em in their backyard.

631
00:50:21,889 --> 00:50:24,558
Ray, this is Walter.

632
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:30,397
No!

633
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:46,789
There's just got to be
some other explanation for this.

634
00:50:50,918 --> 00:50:54,254
It's just some litter.
The guy's a litterbug.

635
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,928
<i>It could be a candy bar wrapper.</i>
<i>It could be a napkin.</i>

636
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:02,930
It could be a crumpled up
credit card receipt.

637
00:51:03,013 --> 00:51:05,474
Those things blow around
all the time.

638
00:51:05,557 --> 00:51:07,977
It, uh... No, it's my note.

639
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:14,316
- Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
- Ouch!

640
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,695
I didn't see you.
I didn't see you.

641
00:51:19,363 --> 00:51:23,117
Great. Crush a beer can.
You feel better now?

642
00:51:23,617 --> 00:51:26,120
<i>Well...</i>

643
00:51:26,203 --> 00:51:29,790
I think it's time we all stopped
acting like kindergartners.

644
00:51:29,873 --> 00:51:34,128
- Don't you, Ray?
- Yes, Carol.

645
00:51:34,211 --> 00:51:38,424
Now, before somebody falls off a roof
or sets themselves on fire...

646
00:51:38,507 --> 00:51:40,426
I think we should go over there,
knock on their door...

647
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:42,469
and invite ourselves in
for a nice, neighbourly chat.

648
00:51:42,553 --> 00:51:46,807
<i>Get to know these people</i>
<i>like we should have done a month ago.</i>

649
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:50,019
That's a good idea.
I'll make brownies.

650
00:51:50,102 --> 00:51:54,690
- Great. While you keep 'em busy, l...
- You're not invited.

651
00:52:15,961 --> 00:52:18,505
- Can't we do this tomorrow, Carol?
- Would you relax?

652
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:21,508
We'll probably find out more
in five minutes of friendly chat...

653
00:52:21,592 --> 00:52:25,304
than you guys can in a month
of snooping around.

654
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:35,356
Okay, now,
everybody just act normal.

655
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:44,365
- Who is it?
- Yoo-hoo!

656
00:52:44,448 --> 00:52:47,409
It's Carol Peterson from next door.

657
00:52:48,786 --> 00:52:51,372
Oh!

658
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:54,416
There go
the goddam brownies.

659
00:52:57,461 --> 00:53:02,383
Hi. Welcome to Mayfield Place.
We're your neighbours.

660
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:04,551
We brought dessert...

661
00:53:06,971 --> 00:53:09,890
Uh, is your mother home?

662
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:14,395
Here you go, sonny.
A little something for the sweet tooth.

663
00:53:28,492 --> 00:53:30,869
I can't believe you've
lived here a whole month...

664
00:53:30,953 --> 00:53:33,664
and we haven't come by
to say hello.

665
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:39,044
I'm your neighbour, Ray Peterson.
That's my wife, Carol.

666
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:41,547
That's Bonnie,
and this is, uh...

667
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,049
Rumsfield's the name.

668
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:46,719
Don't think I caught yours, sonny.

669
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:48,887
- Hans.
- Hans.

670
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:53,392
A fine, Christian name.
Hans Christian Andersen.

671
00:53:53,475 --> 00:53:55,436
What, are you Catholic?

672
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:57,563
I don't know.

673
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:03,736
Oh. Pretty girl.

674
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:07,573
- Friend of yours?
- No, it came with the frame.

675
00:54:07,656 --> 00:54:10,034
- "It came with the frame"?
- Yes.

676
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:15,080
Oh, is this the dining room?
Oh! You startled me.

677
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:18,917
- My Uncle Reuben.
- How do you do?

678
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:27,426
You are the one
who lives next door.

679
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:32,097
<i>- Um... why don't we get some coffee?</i>
<i>- I'll do it.</i>

680
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:36,685
What do you say we all sit down
for a little face-to-face, eh, Reub?

681
00:54:36,769 --> 00:54:40,439
They're in there, all right.
They're just standing around.

682
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:45,110
Oh, great. Don't worry, you guys.
I can get this.

683
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:48,781
- I really appreciate your help. Really.
- No problem. Just be careful.

684
00:54:48,864 --> 00:54:51,283
It's pretty dangerous
with the trip wire.

685
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:53,285
Thanks for your advice.

686
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,287
<i>- W-Watch!</i>
<i>- Be careful!</i>

687
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:59,083
- I'm watchin'.
<i>- Did you make it?</i>

688
00:55:02,711 --> 00:55:05,798
I'm all right.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

689
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:10,469
Just throw me the tools.

690
00:55:10,552 --> 00:55:13,597
<i>Ow!</i>

691
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:58,058
Sure was damp today.

692
00:55:58,142 --> 00:56:02,062
<i>Yes, I just can't seem</i>
<i>to do anything with my hair.</i>

693
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,460
A sardine?

694
00:56:26,962 --> 00:56:29,798
I'm trying to cut back.

695
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:32,384
<i>Sardine?</i>

696
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:28,315
Um...

697
00:57:28,399 --> 00:57:31,151
So, how are you enjoying
Hinkley Hills?

698
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:33,821
We just love it.

699
00:57:33,904 --> 00:57:36,740
- Don't we?
- Yes.

700
00:57:36,824 --> 00:57:40,077
Klopek.
What is that, Slavic?

701
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:45,499
No!

702
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:49,670
About a nine
on the tensión scale, Reub.

703
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:52,172
How do you like
living here so far?

704
00:57:52,256 --> 00:57:54,675
Pretty comfortable house, ain't it?

705
00:57:54,758 --> 00:57:57,845
Good, solid walls.

706
00:57:57,928 --> 00:58:01,515
Good, solid floors.

707
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:12,693
Got somebody tied up in the old cellar,
have you, Reub?

708
00:58:33,464 --> 00:58:36,133
It's packing dust.
I'm sorry.

709
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:38,636
<i>So...</i>

710
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,056
Just you and Unc living here
in the house, is that it, sonny?

711
00:58:42,139 --> 00:58:45,893
- No...
- Please, this is a small family:

712
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:49,396
Me, the young boy...

713
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,068
and my brother... the doctor.

714
00:58:54,151 --> 00:58:57,905
<i>Won't it be nice to have</i>
<i>a doctor in the neighbourhood?</i>

715
00:59:01,325 --> 00:59:06,747
You know, I think it's great you've been
able to stay with all the original wood.

716
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,583
I was never over here
when the Knapps lived here.

717
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:13,587
How unfortunate for the Knapps.

718
00:59:13,671 --> 00:59:19,426
You know, it's funny, but I don't
remember seeing a moving van out front.

719
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:24,390
I don't understand that.
It was parked outside <i>all day!</i>

720
00:59:24,723 --> 00:59:28,602
<i>- Really?</i>
- S-Say, how is, uh...

721
00:59:28,686 --> 00:59:33,107
the... drainage
on your property here?

722
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,442
I know when it rains at our house...

723
00:59:35,526 --> 00:59:39,780
boy, the basement
Just floods right over.

724
00:59:39,863 --> 00:59:44,118
Basement? Ray comes up
with a winning idea.

725
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:46,370
Maybe we should go
take a look in the basement.

726
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:48,372
<i>Maybe that was brother</i>
<i>down there...</i>

727
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:50,457
tapping on the ceiling
a couple minutes ago.

728
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,459
Who knows?

729
00:59:55,879 --> 00:59:58,799
Just what kind of doctor
is this brother of yours?

730
00:59:58,882 --> 01:00:02,303
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

731
01:00:37,421 --> 01:00:40,674
Ah, we have guests.

732
01:00:40,758 --> 01:00:43,010
Sort of.

733
01:00:43,093 --> 01:00:46,347
My brother, the doctor.

734
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:50,351
Werner Klopek.

735
01:00:50,434 --> 01:00:52,686
How nice to meet you.

736
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,688
Ray Peterson.

737
01:00:54,772 --> 01:00:58,359
Oh, pardon my glove.

738
01:01:46,824 --> 01:01:50,911
I thought the candles
would be romantic... for the ladies.

739
01:01:50,995 --> 01:01:53,247
- Oh.
- They're lovely.

740
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:56,083
I really must apologize
for the paint.

741
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:59,420
I was just touching up
one of my pictures.

742
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:03,757
<i>I find painting relaxes me.</i>

743
01:02:13,183 --> 01:02:16,770
- Sugar substitute?
- No, thank you.

744
01:02:16,854 --> 01:02:22,443
<i>It was impolite of us not to have</i>
<i>introduced ourselves sooner.</i>

745
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:26,196
<i>I find my work is rather solitary.</i>

746
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,284
It always keeps us on the move.

747
01:02:30,367 --> 01:02:34,788
Did you know we've had to move
four times in as many years?

748
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:40,461
Oh, all that moving must be
very hard on you, Hans.

749
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:43,964
Indeed.
And tomorrow...

750
01:02:44,048 --> 01:02:46,967
Tomorrow we must all go
to the university...

751
01:02:47,051 --> 01:02:50,304
to discuss yet another transfer.

752
01:02:50,387 --> 01:02:52,890
No. And we're just
getting to know you.

753
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:55,643
That's a shame.
Isn't that a shame, honey?

754
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:57,186
That's a shame.

755
01:02:57,269 --> 01:02:59,480
Says who?

756
01:03:01,565 --> 01:03:03,984
And I was just remarking...

757
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:07,655
to Hans... today...

758
01:03:07,738 --> 01:03:10,991
how nice it would be...

759
01:03:11,075 --> 01:03:13,494
to meet all
of our new neighbours...

760
01:03:13,577 --> 01:03:16,830
<i>and here you are.</i>

761
01:03:16,914 --> 01:03:20,250
<i>- Actually, we're not all here.</i>
<i>- Oh?</i>

762
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:25,631
Walter, the old man next door.
We don't know where the hell he is.

763
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:27,633
Oh, God! Jesus Christ!

764
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:31,595
Sorry! Sorry! Ow!

765
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:34,848
Terrible thing,
the plight of the elderly.

766
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,850
We were just remarking
the other day...

767
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:38,852
about how an old guy like that...

768
01:03:38,936 --> 01:03:41,355
could just drop off
the face of the Earth without a sign.

769
01:03:41,438 --> 01:03:44,692
Vanish. No one ever see him again.
No trace. Nothing.

770
01:03:44,775 --> 01:03:47,653
Right, Ray? Yesterday, wasn't it?

771
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:49,655
<i>We werejust talking</i>
<i>about it yesterday.</i>

772
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:53,617
I bet you were.

773
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:58,205
<i>Why don't wejust cut all this</i>
<i>polite crap, all right?</i>

774
01:03:58,289 --> 01:04:01,375
What's the weird goddam noise
you got comin' outta here all the time?

775
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:02,960
Uh, I think we should go...

776
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:05,212
What have you got
in the cellar, Herr Klopek?

777
01:04:05,296 --> 01:04:08,716
<i>- Mark!</i>
- Ray.

778
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:12,052
<i>Come on. Tell him what you saw.</i>
<i>Tell him.</i>

779
01:04:12,136 --> 01:04:14,054
I have to use your bathroom.

780
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:16,557
Ray, remember night before last?

781
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,726
- You said they were digging.
- Don't open that!

782
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:20,978
<i>- Ray!</i>

783
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:22,771
Oh! Oh!

784
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,819
You keep a horse
in the basement?

785
01:04:46,962 --> 01:04:50,925
- Is it a burglar?
- No, it's Art.

786
01:04:51,008 --> 01:04:54,595
Another neighbour?

787
01:04:54,678 --> 01:04:56,764
A fat one.

788
01:04:58,349 --> 01:05:00,684
Go on, you mangy mutt!

789
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:07,107
I'm sorry if Landru frightened you.

790
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:10,945
- His size tends to ove<i>rw</i>helm people.
- Oh, no, no.

791
01:05:11,028 --> 01:05:14,448
We've imposed on you enough for one
evening. It's been lovely meeting you.

792
01:05:14,531 --> 01:05:16,784
- See you, Doc. Later, Reub.
<i>- Bye, Hans.</i>

793
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:20,621
Yes, Doctor.
It's been real.

794
01:05:20,704 --> 01:05:22,957
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

795
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,251
Let's do this again sometime...
real soon.

796
01:05:26,335 --> 01:05:30,297
- We'll see ourselves to the door. Honey?
<i>- Goodnight.</i>

797
01:05:35,386 --> 01:05:37,805
<i> Okay, I admit it.</i>
<i>They're slightly eccentric.</i>

798
01:05:37,888 --> 01:05:39,807
<i>"Slightly eccentric"? Carol...</i>

799
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,976
<i>- But that doesn't mean...</i>
<i>- Come on!</i>

800
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,229
<i>- They chopped Walter into little pieces!</i>
<i>- These people are clearly psychos!</i>

801
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:49,650
Ray, what do you think?

802
01:05:49,733 --> 01:05:54,655
Yeah, what do you think?

803
01:05:54,738 --> 01:05:58,492
Right.
Been awfully quiet, Ray.

804
01:05:58,575 --> 01:06:02,329
Maybe we could have
a little participation here.

805
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:06,834
I think they're clean.
I think Bonnie and Carol are right.

806
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:09,169
- See?
<i>- That's great, Ray.</i>

807
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:11,839
Just pull open the door,
pull the rip cord and bail out on us.

808
01:06:11,922 --> 01:06:14,675
That's rich, considering you're
the one who started this whole thing.

809
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:16,844
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who started it, tuna neck?

810
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:18,846
- "Tuna neck"?
- You instigated this whole damn thing!

811
01:06:18,929 --> 01:06:20,848
You know who instigated this? Your boy
watching people dig in the backyard!

812
01:06:20,931 --> 01:06:24,351
- You leave my...
- Honey, would you
and Bonnie excuse us?

813
01:06:24,435 --> 01:06:28,856
I think I should have a talk with
the boys in the den for a few minutes.

814
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:31,525
- Okay.
- Oh.

815
01:06:31,609 --> 01:06:34,361
It's good to see you've
come to your senses, sweetie.

816
01:06:35,779 --> 01:06:38,198
Just a minute or two.

817
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:54,214
So, what's the deal, Ray?

818
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:58,177
Are you siding with the chicks
against us? Is that it?

819
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:01,722
Yeah, are you totally
pussy-whipped or what?

820
01:07:01,805 --> 01:07:04,058
Just take your balls
out of your wife's purse.

821
01:07:04,141 --> 01:07:06,393
Make a stand for one time in your life.

822
01:07:06,477 --> 01:07:09,396
Hey, Ray, come on.

823
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,232
- It's just a figure of speech.
- It's a joke. He's kiddin' around.

824
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:14,568
<i>Oh, it's Walter's rug.</i>

825
01:07:14,652 --> 01:07:17,529
<i>You got an old guy's wig.</i>
<i>Big deal.</i>

826
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:20,574
You've had that
in your trousers all day?

827
01:07:20,658 --> 01:07:25,913
After you found this
in Walter's house yesterday...

828
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:30,417
I slipped it back in
through the mail slot.

829
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:34,255
- Yeah?
- Where did you get it this time?

830
01:07:37,174 --> 01:07:39,260
Klopeks?
Wow.

831
01:07:39,343 --> 01:07:42,096
After the dog came up
out of the basement.

832
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:44,265
I found it wedged between
a bunch of magazines...

833
01:07:44,348 --> 01:07:47,601
all of which
were addressed to Walter.

834
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:51,272
Then that means that...

835
01:07:51,355 --> 01:07:56,277
Klopeks went back
inside Walter's house...

836
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,779
and got the hair.

837
01:08:03,534 --> 01:08:06,453
What do we do now, soldier?

838
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:09,957
You heard them say
they were going away tomorrow.

839
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,375
Yeah.

840
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,794
As soon as that car leaves
in the morning...

841
01:08:13,877 --> 01:08:18,882
I'm going over the fence and I'm not
comin' back 'til I find a dead body.

842
01:08:20,551 --> 01:08:24,972
Nobody knocks off an old man in
my neighbourhood and gets away with it.

843
01:09:20,778 --> 01:09:25,866
Gentlemen, we are on alert.

844
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,868
Honey, you know what you could do?

845
01:09:27,952 --> 01:09:31,580
Go get those flag stones at the garden
centre and put them along the walk.

846
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:33,540
Yeah, that'd be a nice project.

847
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:37,211
I've got a foursome lined up with Art
today in an hour and a half though.

848
01:09:37,294 --> 01:09:40,047
I didn't mean right now.
You hate golf.

849
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,217
Well, it's my vacation.
I just wanted to get out of the house.

850
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,386
I would think, after the week
I put you through, you'd want to too.

851
01:09:45,469 --> 01:09:49,223
Why do I get the impressión
you're trying to get rid of me?

852
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:52,643
I'm gonna be gone all day. It'd be
a good time for you to go see Evelyn.

853
01:09:52,726 --> 01:09:54,895
And you have a good time
with the cousins.

854
01:09:54,979 --> 01:09:58,649
I hate them, Dad.
Rudy is a moron, and Diane smells.

855
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:01,235
Have a nice weekend.

856
01:10:02,653 --> 01:10:05,406
I'll see you later.

857
01:10:08,826 --> 01:10:11,245
<i>Hey, Carol,</i>
<i>see my new golf glove?</i>

858
01:10:11,328 --> 01:10:13,414
I got it so I don't get
blisters playing golf.

859
01:10:13,497 --> 01:10:15,749
We're gonna be playing
that much golf. Really.

860
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:19,253
Fore!

861
01:10:19,336 --> 01:10:21,422
Think she bought it?

862
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:36,020
Yo, Steve-man.
What's the haps, dude?

863
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:39,273
You gotta come down here today.
It's gonna be live.

864
01:10:39,356 --> 01:10:41,442
No, you've got to.

865
01:10:41,525 --> 01:10:44,778
Something's about to happen.
I can't tell you.

866
01:10:51,201 --> 01:10:53,120
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Art?

867
01:10:53,203 --> 01:10:55,289
There's a lot of juice
going through those wires.

868
01:10:55,372 --> 01:10:57,458
You hit the wrong one,
you're a Post Toastie.

869
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:59,710
Electricity is our friend.

870
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:01,712
Besides, we wanna take out
their alarms, don't we?

871
01:11:01,795 --> 01:11:05,799
I was thinking we could bypass the fence
altogether and find another way in.

872
01:11:05,883 --> 01:11:08,302
No one knows how many trip alarms
they have in there.

873
01:11:08,385 --> 01:11:11,972
No, I can take out everything
they've got with one clip of the snips.

874
01:11:12,056 --> 01:11:14,141
- Right, Captain?
- Affirmative.

875
01:11:16,894 --> 01:11:18,979
Siren mode.

876
01:11:19,063 --> 01:11:21,982
Pretty neat, eh?

877
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:24,485
I can raise all the police channels...

878
01:11:24,568 --> 01:11:27,738
and the power company channels
on this baby.

879
01:11:27,821 --> 01:11:29,990
<i>- Be careful up there, Art.</i>
- It's okay, Ray.

880
01:11:30,074 --> 01:11:33,160
We gotta get going though.
We're burning daylight here.

881
01:11:36,246 --> 01:11:40,167
Hey, where should we start diggin'
once we get over there?

882
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:44,171
We start in the backyard,
then check the basement.

883
01:11:44,255 --> 01:11:46,382
Be careful up there.
Go slow, huh?

884
01:11:46,465 --> 01:11:49,718
Hey, safety is my middle name.

885
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,681
I thought his middle name was Louis.

886
01:11:55,266 --> 01:11:57,851
<i>Are you sure you're</i>
<i>all right up there?</i>

887
01:11:57,935 --> 01:11:59,895
I don't know that
he knows what he's doing.

888
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:04,358
- Well, why didn't you go up there?
- It's very high.

889
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,787
Oh, Jesus!

890
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:22,167
Jesus Christ!
Get an ambulance on that thing!

891
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,007
I'm okay. I'm all right.

892
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:32,136
Ow! God!

893
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:34,138
I took a jolt, but I'm okay.

894
01:12:34,221 --> 01:12:36,140
- Can you stand up?
- Oh, yeah.

895
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:39,643
- Try one of these.
- Oh, yeah, that's better.

896
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:42,146
- Whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no. Jesus.

897
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:45,899
Look at my fingers.

898
01:12:45,983 --> 01:12:49,987
My fingernails are black.

899
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,740
- My fillings are hot.
- Hey, look at this.

900
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:56,577
The man actually hit the right wire.
There's no alarm.

901
01:12:56,660 --> 01:13:00,247
- Hey, good work.
- Congratulations. Now give me five.

902
01:13:00,331 --> 01:13:03,917
- I'm gonna set up a communications base.
- You got it.

903
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:07,671
- Here, you're gonna need this.
- Here.

904
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:34,740
Hey, hey, hey, Rumsfield!
Dude!

905
01:13:34,823 --> 01:13:36,867
What are you doing with the gun?

906
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:39,787
Just shut up
and paint your goddam house!

907
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:43,707
Whoa! Fine.

908
01:13:49,088 --> 01:13:52,466
Task Force One,
this is Eagle Eye.

909
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:55,928
You are all clear.

910
01:13:57,429 --> 01:13:59,723
Roger, Eagle Eye.
We're going over.

911
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:05,187
Roger.
Red rover, red rover, let Ray go over.

912
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:11,735
Good. Now, red rover, red rover,
let Art go on over.

913
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:18,534
That's great. Over.

914
01:14:24,748 --> 01:14:27,626
It's really getting hot out here.

915
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:30,629
Yeah.
Yeah, it is getting hot, Art.

916
01:14:30,713 --> 01:14:35,009
Why don't you dig one
of your own holes, huh?

917
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:38,846
I was just checking this one.
Besides, the radio... I was monitoring...

918
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:43,142
This is turning out to be a lot more
work than we thought it was gonna be.

919
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:47,104
Why don't we check the house?
It's probably a lot cooler in there.

920
01:14:47,187 --> 01:14:49,815
That's a good idea.
Let's try the house.

921
01:14:49,898 --> 01:14:52,568
We'll start in the basement.

922
01:14:52,651 --> 01:14:56,989
We'll start in the basement
and just work our way up.

923
01:14:57,072 --> 01:15:00,200
<i> Ray, I'm thinking the reason we</i>
<i>didn't find anything in the backyard...</i>

924
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:02,828
<i>is because they probably weren't</i>
<i>burying anybody in the backyard.</i>

925
01:15:02,911 --> 01:15:06,624
<i>They were digging bodies up and they</i>
<i>probably buried them in the basement.</i>

926
01:15:06,707 --> 01:15:08,959
<i>That's a possibility, Art.</i>

927
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:12,796
<i>I say we start in the kitchen. They</i>
<i>probably got some cold beer in there.</i>

928
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,467
<i>Or some knockwurst or something.</i>
<i>I'm starving.</i>

929
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,470
It's locked.

930
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:21,764
- Hey, give me a credit card.
- Yeah.

931
01:15:39,531 --> 01:15:44,328
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- I don't know how to do this.

932
01:15:47,665 --> 01:15:50,292
Ah, it's a shit store anyway.

933
01:15:55,339 --> 01:15:59,510
Ray, do the words "breaking
and entering" mean anything to you?

934
01:16:00,761 --> 01:16:06,642
<i> Hey, Mr Rumsfield!</i>
<i>Hey, yo, man!</i>

935
01:16:06,725 --> 01:16:08,644
I wanted to introduce you
to my friend.

936
01:16:08,727 --> 01:16:11,981
- This is Steve Kuntz.
- Hey, dude.

937
01:16:12,064 --> 01:16:14,191
He's here to watch the show
this afternoon.

938
01:16:14,275 --> 01:16:16,193
Great.

939
01:16:57,234 --> 01:16:59,612
<i>It's about time, you guys.</i>

940
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:02,948
Hey, man,
when's the big unveiling, huh?

941
01:17:03,032 --> 01:17:08,746
- I gotta go to work in a couple hours.
- Hey, man, piss off!

942
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:12,249
- Get this lame-o out of your yard!
<i>- Yo!</i>

943
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:15,336
- Get out of my yard, lame-o! Hey!
- What's his problem?

944
01:17:15,419 --> 01:17:17,588
<i>Get out of my yard!</i>

945
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:27,765
<i> Ray, look at the size</i>
<i>of this furnace.</i>

946
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:30,351
This thing's
got to be 80 years old.

947
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:33,020
These old places have got
to be hell to heat.

948
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:34,855
<i>This house isn't that big.</i>

949
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:39,109
What the hell does he need
a furnace like this for?

950
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:44,573
I think there's been some modifications
on this 'cause this conduit's brand new.

951
01:17:44,657 --> 01:17:47,284
It runs all the way back over there
and up through a hole in the ceiling.

952
01:17:47,368 --> 01:17:49,870
I saw some of that
in their living room.

953
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:52,623
And a thermostat
on a home furnace...

954
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:55,417
Is that supposed to go
to 5,000 degrees, do you think?

955
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:57,378
It must be what all the noise was.

956
01:17:57,461 --> 01:17:59,380
Look at all the stuff
they put together down here.

957
01:17:59,463 --> 01:18:02,549
- They got this place
wired with batteries.
- There's got to be 40 of them.

958
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:05,427
Look, we got power here.

959
01:18:22,736 --> 01:18:25,990
This is no ordinary furnace.

960
01:18:32,663 --> 01:18:37,293
What's that?

961
01:18:43,882 --> 01:18:46,343
<i>Yo, Rumsfield!</i>

962
01:18:52,057 --> 01:18:55,352
Awesome!

963
01:18:55,436 --> 01:18:57,938
<i>Mr Rumsfield, are you okay?</i>

964
01:18:58,022 --> 01:19:00,691
- Yes, yes, I'm all right.
- That was very cool, man.

965
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:04,612
Art. Art, look.

966
01:19:04,695 --> 01:19:07,114
- Look! I found it!
- That's loose dirt.

967
01:19:07,197 --> 01:19:11,243
They must have burned his body up
in the furnace...

968
01:19:11,327 --> 01:19:13,287
and then buried his bones right here.

969
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:16,165
What do we do now?

970
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:20,961
I'll tell him that
they built a crematorium down here.

971
01:19:21,045 --> 01:19:25,090
Don't tell him that. He'll just want to
come down. Wait 'til we find something.

972
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:27,801
Ray, that could take all night.

973
01:19:33,349 --> 01:19:37,978
Mr Rumsfield, you guys managed to
knock out the power in the entire block.

974
01:19:38,062 --> 01:19:40,397
Probably the whole south end of town.

975
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:42,441
Ricky, shut up!

976
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:45,986
- Shh.
- We're gonna make a run to McD's.

977
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,864
- You want a Quarterpounder
or something?
- Oh, no way!

978
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:51,659
Hey, you guys can't go now.
It's the best part.

979
01:19:51,742 --> 01:19:55,245
- I called the pizza dude.
- All right!

980
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:28,028
<i> Ray, I think we can give up.</i>
<i>They'd never bury him this deep.</i>

981
01:20:28,112 --> 01:20:33,742
<i>Who, besides us, would dig this deep</i>
<i>into this kind of sludge?</i>

982
01:20:33,826 --> 01:20:36,370
That was metal!

983
01:20:36,453 --> 01:20:38,914
- Hey!
- That was metal! You hit a crypt!

984
01:20:38,998 --> 01:20:44,545
They buried him in a crypt!
I'll get my blowtorch! I'll call it in!

985
01:20:44,628 --> 01:20:49,258
Hello! Hey, uh...
Eagle Eye, this is Ground Force One.

986
01:20:49,341 --> 01:20:52,678
We have found Walter! We found Walter!
I'll be out in a minute!

987
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:56,640
Dig there! Dig there!
Oh, yes! We found him!

988
01:20:58,976 --> 01:21:01,228
We caught you, Reub.

989
01:21:01,312 --> 01:21:04,732
You've been playing us for saps,
but you were wrong.

990
01:21:47,858 --> 01:21:50,069
<i>Mr Weingartner! Art!</i>

991
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:53,197
Look! Look over there!
Look! Right now!

992
01:22:00,454 --> 01:22:02,331
Go on. Go on. I'll...

993
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,960
<i>Walter!</i>

994
01:22:08,879 --> 01:22:11,840
<i>Let me go. I'm all right.</i>

995
01:22:11,924 --> 01:22:15,261
Ray! Raymond!

996
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,681
<i>Listen up real carefully, mister.</i>

997
01:22:18,764 --> 01:22:21,058
We got a real problem.

998
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:24,687
Hey, Ray, guess who's not
in the basement? Walter!

999
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,314
He's back! He's back!

1000
01:22:34,613 --> 01:22:38,325
<i>Klopeks! With coppers!</i>

1001
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:42,454
Keep 'em busy. Keep 'em busy.
I'll get Ray.

1002
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:45,457
<i>- Keep them busy!</i>
- All right, okay, all right!

1003
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:49,795
Stop! Stop right there!
Don't go any further!

1004
01:22:49,878 --> 01:22:53,465
You're going!
Stop!

1005
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:57,177
Hey, Mr Officer, wait.

1006
01:22:57,261 --> 01:22:59,179
There are these people
in my parents' house...

1007
01:22:59,263 --> 01:23:01,223
and they're eating
all their food!

1008
01:23:07,896 --> 01:23:09,815
<i>- Ray, Walter showed up!</i>

1009
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:14,028
- The Klopeks! I got Ricky down there...
- I hit the gas line! Run!

1010
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:16,530
- Gas!
- Run!

1011
01:23:16,614 --> 01:23:18,657
- What is the problem here?
<i>- Thank God you're here.</i>

1012
01:23:18,741 --> 01:23:21,619
- No problem, sir.
- This is not a police matter.

1013
01:23:21,702 --> 01:23:24,038
<i> We hit a pipe!</i>
<i>There's all kinds of gas!</i>

1014
01:23:24,121 --> 01:23:27,207
It's gonna blow!

1015
01:23:30,127 --> 01:23:33,923
- All right!
- Ricky sure knows how to throw a party.

1016
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:07,122
Was that your house?

1017
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:17,007
Ray.

1018
01:24:22,638 --> 01:24:25,099
Something is moving in there.

1019
01:25:01,093 --> 01:25:04,388
Ray... Ray, you found it, right?

1020
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,682
Before it blew, you found it, right?

1021
01:25:06,765 --> 01:25:09,852
Hey, tell me you found it.
You found it, right?

1022
01:25:09,935 --> 01:25:13,606
Before everything went off,
you had to have found it.

1023
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,735
You got a lawsuit
on your hands, mister.

1024
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:23,991
Oh, God, what's this?

1025
01:25:43,761 --> 01:25:47,097
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1026
01:25:47,181 --> 01:25:49,600
<i>Please stay behind the barricade.</i>

1027
01:25:56,398 --> 01:25:59,652
You want to step back, please?

1028
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:02,863
- That's my house.
- Sorry, I've got to get the all clear
from the gas company.

1029
01:26:02,947 --> 01:26:06,033
- I can clear this. She lives here.
- Did I ask you?

1030
01:26:06,116 --> 01:26:08,702
Miss, you wanna
come back here, please?

1031
01:26:08,786 --> 01:26:10,704
Excuse me, pal.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough.

1032
01:26:12,248 --> 01:26:14,291
<i>Hey!</i>

1033
01:26:23,634 --> 01:26:28,973
- Oh, honey, what have they done to you?
- You cut your hair.

1034
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,018
I like it.

1035
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:35,938
<i> I'm telling you, Officer,</i>
<i>there's a body buried in that house.</i>

1036
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:38,857
- Mr Seznick, right?
- Yeah, the old guy who's sitting here...

1037
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:41,443
- is buried in that house, Sherlock.
- Watch it.

1038
01:26:41,527 --> 01:26:43,445
Where was he anyway?

1039
01:26:43,529 --> 01:26:46,490
Mr Seznick was at the hospital
'til 8:00 this evening.

1040
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:49,243
Monday night
he had some heart palpitations.

1041
01:26:49,326 --> 01:26:53,831
He called his daughter and son-in-law,
and they took him to the hospital.

1042
01:26:53,914 --> 01:26:57,418
What about the wig?
They found a wig in this house.

1043
01:26:57,501 --> 01:26:59,712
- His wig.
- The Klopeks were picking up his mail.

1044
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:04,258
The doctor somehow got that wig mixed
up with the newspapers and letters.

1045
01:27:04,341 --> 01:27:07,595
"Doctor"? You don't believe that
this guy's a real doctor, do you?

1046
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:10,014
Yes, I do believe he's a doctor.

1047
01:27:10,097 --> 01:27:13,434
In fact, he's a very well-respected
pathologist, my friend.

1048
01:27:13,517 --> 01:27:17,521
I'd say that you are damn lucky
you didn't kill him in that blast.

1049
01:27:17,605 --> 01:27:21,483
Oh, yeah,
I thank my lucky stars.

1050
01:27:21,567 --> 01:27:26,363
- Take care of this nitwit.
- Sorry about your car, man.

1051
01:27:26,447 --> 01:27:30,618
<i>Destruction of private property.</i>
<i>Destruction of public property.</i>

1052
01:27:30,701 --> 01:27:33,787
Three counts
of criminal trespassing.

1053
01:27:33,871 --> 01:27:38,626
Harassment, assault,
vandalism.

1054
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:41,128
And that poor old man claims
he's got a ransom note...

1055
01:27:41,211 --> 01:27:43,672
that says you kidnapped his dog!

1056
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:48,510
Do you hear me okay, Mr Peterson?

1057
01:27:51,138 --> 01:27:55,267
I really do like your hair, honey.

1058
01:27:55,351 --> 01:27:57,394
<i> You know,</i>
<i>this doesn't change a thing.</i>

1059
01:27:57,478 --> 01:28:00,314
They may think it does. They may think
they're off the hook, but they're not.

1060
01:28:00,397 --> 01:28:03,025
No, they're not. Are they, Ray?
Go ahead, tell 'em.

1061
01:28:03,108 --> 01:28:05,402
We got the goods on 'em, don't we?

1062
01:28:05,486 --> 01:28:07,655
Someday they're gonna dig up
the back of that yard...

1063
01:28:07,738 --> 01:28:10,199
and they're gonna find the rest
of that skeleton to go with that femur.

1064
01:28:10,282 --> 01:28:14,495
- It might not be Walter, but...
- Shut up, Art! Shut up!

1065
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:18,082
God, you don't know when
to quit, do you?

1066
01:28:18,165 --> 01:28:21,043
Look at me!

1067
01:28:21,126 --> 01:28:23,796
I'm a shell of a man
because of you, Art.

1068
01:28:23,879 --> 01:28:27,132
- Now, now...
- Soldiers!

1069
01:28:27,216 --> 01:28:30,135
You leave 'em alone!
Get off their case already!

1070
01:28:30,219 --> 01:28:34,640
They didn't do anything to us.
They didn't do anything to us!

1071
01:28:34,723 --> 01:28:37,893
All right, so they're different!
So they keep to themselves!

1072
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:41,522
Can you blame them? They live next door
to people who break into their house...

1073
01:28:41,605 --> 01:28:44,275
and burn it down
while they're gone for the day.

1074
01:28:45,693 --> 01:28:49,280
Remember what you were saying
about people in the 'burbs?

1075
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:51,282
People like Skip?

1076
01:28:51,365 --> 01:28:57,079
People who mow their lawn
for the 800th time and then snap?

1077
01:28:57,162 --> 01:29:00,332
Well, that's us!
It's not them! That's us!

1078
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:05,170
We're the ones vaulting over fences and
peeking in through people's windows!

1079
01:29:05,254 --> 01:29:09,717
We're the ones throwing garbage
in the street and lighting fires!

1080
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,595
We're the ones who are acting
suspicious and paranoid, Art!

1081
01:29:12,678 --> 01:29:17,057
We're the lunatics! Us!
It's not them!

1082
01:29:18,642 --> 01:29:20,936
It's us.

1083
01:29:23,606 --> 01:29:27,526
I don't know what to say.

1084
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:29,528
What, do you want me to move?

1085
01:29:33,365 --> 01:29:36,243
- I'm gonna kill him!
- You're crazy!

1086
01:29:38,329 --> 01:29:40,581
- Back off!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1087
01:29:40,664 --> 01:29:44,084
<i>- Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>
<i>- Break it up!</i>

1088
01:29:44,168 --> 01:29:47,212
- Stop it! Stop it!
- I don't care! I've been blown up!

1089
01:29:47,296 --> 01:29:49,465
Take me to the hospital!

1090
01:29:49,548 --> 01:29:52,051
Take me to a hospital.
I'm sick.

1091
01:29:52,134 --> 01:29:57,806
My eye hurts.

1092
01:30:06,148 --> 01:30:08,692
Honey? I'll just...

1093
01:30:08,776 --> 01:30:11,070
find out what hospital
they're taking you to...

1094
01:30:11,153 --> 01:30:14,949
and then I'll...
follow right along.

1095
01:30:15,032 --> 01:30:17,034
- Okay?
<i>- Okay, honey.</i>

1096
01:30:18,327 --> 01:30:20,871
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Carol.

1097
01:30:30,506 --> 01:30:34,218
Okay, hepcats, get off my car!

1098
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:36,971
- Get off my car!
- Dude, you should hang out a little bit.

1099
01:30:37,054 --> 01:30:40,057
- This goes for you!
- We've got the pizza dude coming.

1100
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,851
You imbecile!
You sub-moron, you!

1101
01:30:43,435 --> 01:30:47,648
Who's that?

1102
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:54,363
Oh, Dr Klopek,
I'm so sorry.

1103
01:30:54,446 --> 01:30:56,991
You know, Dr Klopek,
when I get out of prison...

1104
01:30:57,074 --> 01:31:00,160
I'm gonna help you
rebuild your house.

1105
01:31:00,244 --> 01:31:03,747
I'll even do some of the work myself.
I have the tools.

1106
01:31:03,831 --> 01:31:07,167
Carol's father just gave me
a brand new set of tools.

1107
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:11,630
Do I look like an idiot, Mr Peterson?

1108
01:31:11,714 --> 01:31:13,632
No.

1109
01:31:13,716 --> 01:31:17,761
Do you take me for an imbecile?

1110
01:31:17,845 --> 01:31:19,763
No.

1111
01:31:19,847 --> 01:31:24,393
You may have fooled the others,
Mr Peterson...

1112
01:31:24,476 --> 01:31:26,478
but you don't fool me.

1113
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:30,065
Uh, I fooled the others?

1114
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:33,402
<i>- But you don't fool me.</i>
- I don't?

1115
01:31:33,485 --> 01:31:36,447
No, you don't.

1116
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:38,907
Am I missing something, Doctor?

1117
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:44,121
Come now, Mr Peterson.
You were in my basement.

1118
01:31:44,204 --> 01:31:49,084
Surely, you looked in the furnace.

1119
01:31:49,168 --> 01:31:53,464
I saw your furnace, Doctor...

1120
01:31:53,547 --> 01:31:58,218
but I figured a man's furnace
is his own business.

1121
01:31:59,303 --> 01:32:03,140
You saw one of my skulls, didn't you?

1122
01:32:03,223 --> 01:32:06,310
Oh, yes. I know you did.

1123
01:32:07,311 --> 01:32:10,940
It belonged to a neighbour of yours.

1124
01:32:11,023 --> 01:32:15,235
The name was Knapp.

1125
01:32:15,319 --> 01:32:18,530
We took the house from them.

1126
01:32:18,614 --> 01:32:23,327
I offered to buy it,
but you know how old people are.

1127
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:27,414
They grow so attached to things.

1128
01:32:27,498 --> 01:32:29,917
Uh, you know, Dr Klopek,
I think I forgot my wallet.

1129
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,755
I let you keep the femur.

1130
01:32:34,838 --> 01:32:39,343
Now, now, I want my skull.

1131
01:32:39,426 --> 01:32:43,264
Or, perhaps, I might just take yours.

1132
01:32:43,347 --> 01:32:45,099
Hans.

1133
01:32:45,182 --> 01:32:48,185
<i>Uh, hey!</i>

1134
01:33:16,255 --> 01:33:18,382
<i>Hey, the pizza dude!</i>

1135
01:33:25,055 --> 01:33:26,974
Yeah! Way to go!

1136
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:40,946
Far out.

1137
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:50,039
Citizen's arrest!
Citizen's arrest!

1138
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:55,753
I, Ray Peterson, am placing you
under citizen's arrest...

1139
01:33:55,836 --> 01:33:57,922
for my attempted murder!

1140
01:33:58,005 --> 01:33:59,924
The man doesn't know
what he's talking about.

1141
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:02,468
- Citizen's arrest. Citizen's arrest.
- Oh, Ray.

1142
01:34:02,551 --> 01:34:05,429
Don't start with me, Carol. The man
confessed. They murdered the Knapps.

1143
01:34:05,512 --> 01:34:07,514
<i>- He's demented.</i>
- Hey, Sherlock.

1144
01:34:07,598 --> 01:34:10,184
<i>Get the Klopeks to tell you</i>
<i>where they buried the stiffs.</i>

1145
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:13,312
<i> You don't have a stiff.</i>
<i>You don't have any evidence.</i>

1146
01:34:13,395 --> 01:34:15,314
You do now.

1147
01:34:26,450 --> 01:34:28,410
This your vehicle, Dr Klopek?

1148
01:34:32,456 --> 01:34:35,042
<i>Let's go, Doc.</i>

1149
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:39,755
Hey! Pinocchio!

1150
01:34:39,838 --> 01:34:41,799
Where are you going?

1151
01:34:46,428 --> 01:34:48,555
Gotcha!

1152
01:34:53,269 --> 01:34:56,105
Don't you make a move, sonny.

1153
01:34:56,188 --> 01:35:01,151
I was 18 months in the bush,
and I can snap your neck in a heartbeat.

1154
01:35:01,235 --> 01:35:04,405
I think the message
to psychos, fanatics, murderers...

1155
01:35:04,488 --> 01:35:06,407
nutcases all over the worid
is, uh...

1156
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:10,911
do not mess with suburbanites because,
uh, we're not gonna take it any more.

1157
01:35:10,995 --> 01:35:12,871
We're not gonna be content
to look after our lawns...

1158
01:35:12,955 --> 01:35:14,790
and wax our cars, paint our houses.

1159
01:35:14,873 --> 01:35:18,002
We're out to get 'em, Don.
We are out to get them.

1160
01:35:22,172 --> 01:35:24,216
- Hello.
- Hi.

1161
01:35:26,093 --> 01:35:30,097
So, what are you gonna do now?

1162
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:34,351
I'm gonna pack a bag
and go up to the lake.

1163
01:35:34,435 --> 01:35:36,353
We got 'em, neighbour.

1164
01:35:37,563 --> 01:35:41,108
- Get away from him.
- Hey, you guys.

1165
01:35:41,191 --> 01:35:44,028
You wanna go down to Bowl-O-Rama
for a beer or something?

1166
01:35:44,111 --> 01:35:47,823
Man, that was an incredible choke hold
you put on me, pal. The guy's a brute.

1167
01:35:47,906 --> 01:35:49,825
How's that finger?
Is it okay?

1168
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:51,994
Where are you guys going?
Where you going?

1169
01:35:52,077 --> 01:35:54,705
I'm going on vacation.

1170
01:35:54,788 --> 01:35:57,124
"Vacation"?
What, are you crazy?

1171
01:35:57,207 --> 01:35:59,251
This is a major media event here.

1172
01:35:59,335 --> 01:36:03,297
Geraldo Rivera's coming, and he's gonna
excavate the basement of the Klopeks!

1173
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:07,551
It's gonna be broadcast
on satellite all over the worid, live!

1174
01:36:07,635 --> 01:36:09,553
Art!

1175
01:36:09,637 --> 01:36:12,514
Your wife's home.

1176
01:36:12,598 --> 01:36:16,268
- And your house is on fire!
- Art, where are you?

1177
01:36:17,394 --> 01:36:18,979
My wife is home!

1178
01:36:19,063 --> 01:36:22,274
Mr Peterson, where you going?

1179
01:36:22,358 --> 01:36:25,319
It's just starting to get good.

1180
01:36:25,402 --> 01:36:28,238
I'm going away for a while, Ricky.

1181
01:36:31,408 --> 01:36:35,246
I want you to keep an eye
on the neighbourhood for me.

1182
01:36:35,329 --> 01:36:38,040
You betcha, Mr Peterson.

1183
01:36:38,123 --> 01:36:41,043
<i>No problem.</i>

1184
01:36:56,767 --> 01:36:58,727
God, I love this street.
