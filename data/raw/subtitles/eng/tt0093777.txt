1
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,100
I found Father Carlton
this morning.

2
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,460
He was taken to the hospital,
but he never regained consciousness.

3
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,140
Why was he here?

4
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,740
He had an appointment with
His Eminence this afternoon.

5
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,180
Let's talk about
our beliefs...

6
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
and what we can
learn about them.

7
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,900
We believe nature is solid...

8
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,140
and time a constant.

9
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,060
Matter has substance,
and time a direction.

10
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,020
There is truth in flesh,
huh,

11
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,060
and the solid ground.

12
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,100
The wind may be invisible,
but it's real.

13
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,260
<i>Smoke, fire, water, light...
they're different,</i>

14
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,780
<i>not as to stone nor steel,
but they're tangible.</i>

15
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,220
And we assume time
has an arrow,

16
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,460
because it is as a clock.

17
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,220
One second is
one second for everyone.

18
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,100
<i>Cause precedes effect.</i>

19
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,700
<i>Fruit rots,
water flows downstream.</i>

20
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,420
<i>We're born, we age, we die.</i>

21
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,620
<i>The reverse never happens.</i>

22
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,660
None of this is true.
Say good-bye to classical reality,

23
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,500
because our logic collapses
on the subatomic level...

24
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,900
into ghosts and shadows.

25
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,500
From Job's friends insisting...

26
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,660
that the good are rewarded
and the wicked punished...

27
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,540
to the scientists of the 1930s...

28
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,780
proving to their horror a theorem...

29
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,100
that not everything can be proved,

30
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,380
<i>we've sought to impose
order on the universe.</i>

31
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,780
<i>But we have discovered
something very surprising.</i>

32
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,260
While order does exist in the universe,

33
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,660
it is not at all what we had in mind.

34
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,900
<i>Professor Birack, in relativity...</i>

35
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,740
<i>geometry breaks down on the cosmic
scale, and in quantum physics...</i>

36
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,820
<i>logic breaks down
on the sub-microscopic scale.</i>

37
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,140
What's this?
I don't know.

38
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,820
Birack did that whole series of
debates on the B.B.C. A few years ago.

39
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,860
Oh, with the English priest.
Right.

40
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,860
Maybe they're planning
another one.

41
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,340
He died before his appointment
with the Cardinal,

42
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,380
but he left a diary.

43
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,980
You-You must help us.

44
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,580
Please.

45
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,780
The discovery of this supernova...

46
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,660
has immense significance
to the scientific community.

47
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,420
Particles collected date
from pre-Cambrian times...

48
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,100
before man walked on earth.

49
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,180
<i>Light from the explosion
was hurled through space...</i>

50
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,180
<i>at 186,000 miles per second,</i>

51
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,700
and is just now reaching us
across the vast expanse of the universe.

52
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,140
He was the guardian priest.

53
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,380
Apparently, he lived here
for over 30 years.

54
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,460
Once a week,
he would venture out for food.

55
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,860
And every day,

56
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,140
he opened this door.

57
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,820
Built in the 1500s...

58
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
by arrangement
with the Spanish government.

59
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,020
Who knew about this? Only the
members of this forgotten sect.

60
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,340
The Brotherhood of Sleep.

61
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,540
There was a vow of silence.

62
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,860
Even their very existence
was kept from the Holy See.

63
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,380
The Vatican didn't know?

64
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,380
The guardian priest
would keep the secret,

65
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,260
and before he died
would pass it on to another.

66
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,540
The sect had enormous
power and authority.

67
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,900
Their actions were never questioned.

68
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,940
Latin.
Some of it is in Latin.

69
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,540
<i>Some in Coptic, Greek, numbers.</i>

70
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,500
<i>It's not easy to decipher.</i>

71
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,300
The original text has been
distorted over the years.

72
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,660
Distorted?
Rewritten.

73
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,660
Writing upon writing,

74
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,980
sometimes two or three times,

75
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,500
and improperly erased.

76
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,140
You can still see
the old writing.

77
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,020
It's underneath.

78
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,860
What is it?

79
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,180
<i>A secret that can no longer be kept.</i>

80
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,460
Do you feel it?
Yes. Something.

81
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,060
It was never here before.

82
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,380
It started a month ago.
What started?

83
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,740
A change in the earth...
and the sky.

84
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,820
His power.

85
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,740
I don't get it.
What don't you get?

86
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,580
The whole thing.
It doesn't make sense.

87
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,420
It violates common sense. That's the whole
point. That's what Einstein couldn't accept.

88
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,060
I can't accept it either. Do you know
anything about spontaneous human combustion?

89
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,700
Walter, come on. That's
Schrodinger's cat. I know, I know.

90
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,980
So what's the point? The point is,
until the cat is observed by someone,

91
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,940
he's not in any definite state,
either alive or dead.

92
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,820
He's in a wave superposition state,
both dead and alive at the same time.

93
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,220
Huh?
Okay.

94
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,060
Only when we open the box
and observe the cat...

95
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,140
does he materialize into reality,
either dead or alive.

96
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,260
But it doesn't make sense. That
is the entire, complete point.

97
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,540
It doesn't make
any common sense.

98
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,860
Our common sense breaks down
on a subatomic level.

99
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,020
Why do I want a Ph. D in this?

100
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,900
Particle beam weapons,
research grants.

101
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,660
A millionaire when I'm 40.
Now I remember.

102
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,500
<i>You're really gonna like this.
Class canceled?</i>

103
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,900
"Will the following students
please see Professor Birack. "

104
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,540
Shit, there I am.
Me too.

105
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
All of us. And we heard Birack wants
us to cancel our plans for the weekend.

106
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,940
What? That's not all. A couple of
biochemistry's finest are coming with us.

107
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,100
And someone to translate Latin.
Coming with us where?

108
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,660
I'm gonna have to pull some strings here. This is just
not gonna happen. I have serious plans for the weekend.

109
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,940
4:00, Walter, Birack's office. Oh, I gotta
ditch Pagels again. He's not gonna like it.

110
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,820
Sleep with him.
Get an "A."

111
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,060
So what about your plans?
I was gonna study, actually.

112
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,380
Me too.
I'm Brian Marsh, by the way,

113
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,420
since we're spending
the weekend together.

114
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,820
I know.
Catherine Danforth.

115
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,700
I know.

116
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,340
So where did you
transfer from?

117
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,820
Kneale.
Theoretical physics.

118
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,220
I came here to study with Birack.
You're applied physics, right?

119
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,420
So why are you taking
Birack for theory?

120
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I wanna know
what the math means.

121
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,300
Birack's ruthless.
He wants philosophers, not scientists.

122
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,420
Well, I've read his books.
He's a brilliant man.

123
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,180
Just when I think I've got it,
visualized it, it just all goes away.

124
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,740
I start seeing
old-fashioned classical reality again.

125
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,460
I want the clock put back.
I wanna put it all into a little box.

126
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,340
But whenever I try,
it just, uh, slithers out.

127
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,020
Some things aren't changed
by quantum physics though.

128
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,660
Such as?
Well, for instance,

129
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,020
every theoretical physicist
I know wonders why it is...

130
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,340
that no one who looks like you...

131
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,860
ever seems to settle down
in our end of the building.

132
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,660
That's not true, and that's
an extremely sexist thing to say.

133
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,180
Confirmed sexist,
and proud of it.

134
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,420
Hey. I was just joking.

135
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,860
What happened?

136
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,860
You talk numbers, you get romantic.

137
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,100
You talk people, you clam up.

138
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,740
Just a little miscue, that's all.

139
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,740
It's not your fault.

140
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,860
I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.

141
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,780
Hey, wait.

142
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,860
This conversation isn't what I
had in mind. Can we start over?

143
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,180
Okay.
Okay.

144
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,140
I was hoping that you would need
some help with your theory,

145
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,060
and that maybe we could discuss it...

146
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,900
over... over dinner or something.

147
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,780
Well, I suppose
something could be arranged.

148
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,460
There are other things
that I need help with... over dinner.

149
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,060
I have volunteered our services
to the Archdiocese.

150
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,340
Now, each of you
is a competent physicist,

151
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,980
even though you don't have
a degree to prove it.

152
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,500
Participating in this examination...

153
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,060
will greatly improve your
classroom averages, I might add.

154
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,300
<i>Plan to take your meals there.</i>

155
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,740
<i>We'll bring cots to sleep on.</i>

156
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,460
<i>There are other departments joining us.
Excuse me, sir.</i>

157
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,540
Is there some reason why you're not
telling us what we're gonna be doing?

158
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,780
In time.

159
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,100
<i>It's your disbelief that powers him.</i>

160
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:16,340
Your stubborn faith in...
in common sense...

161
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,660
that allows his deception.

162
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,740
He lives in
the smallest parts of it...

163
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,660
in the atoms.

164
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,300
Smaller,

165
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,260
invisible.

166
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,980
He lives in all of it...

167
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,500
in the sum of its parts.

168
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,020
We must translate
this book.

169
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,340
You must prove it
scientifically.

170
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,220
Convince the outside world.

171
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,420
The outside world doesn't want
to hear this kind of bullshit.

172
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,300
Just keep it locked away.

173
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,180
You've already managed that
for 2,000 years.

174
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,820
No prison can hold him now.

175
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,540
Hi.
HI.

176
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,460
It's getting cold out here. I thought
this was supposed to be California.

177
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,900
Did you have a class tonight, or...
Library.

178
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,100
Oh. Actually, I was hoping you'd
have a cup of coffee with me again.

179
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,420
This is startin'
to become a habit.

180
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,100
Okay.
Okay.

181
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,940
Good morning.

182
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,780
Thank you.

183
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,660
We didn't get much sleep.
Mmm.

184
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,500
Who needs sleep?

185
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,740
We do. Today's Friday.

186
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,060
Can I tell you something?

187
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,340
Oh, please, don't.
I want to.

188
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,980
Tell me next time...

189
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,020
if there is one.

190
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,580
Or the time after that, or...

191
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,660
two years from now.

192
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,980
Who was he?

193
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,060
The one who gave you
such a high opinion of men?

194
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,940
I wouldn't like it if
either of us jumped to conclusions.

195
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,140
How do you know I was going to say
what you think I was gonna say?

196
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,860
Because if you don't,

197
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,780
I don't wanna know.

198
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Oh, please, don't tell me.

199
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,260
This place gives me the creeps.
Well, it was abandoned.

200
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,140
Hmm. I never would've guessed.

201
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,500
No, I hear it used to be
a beautiful church. When?

202
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,700
In the 1950s. My husband's
parents used to come here.

203
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,580
And then for some reason,
it was closed down.

204
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,820
Well!
Yeah.

205
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,060
Hi. I'm, uh, Leahy.
I'm looking for Birack.

206
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,220
Hi. Brian Marsh.
He's over in... There he is.

207
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,060
Ah. Thanks.

208
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,300
Professor Birack.
Yes.

209
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,820
Hi. I'm Paul Leahy.
Oh. Dr. Leahy.

210
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,580
I'm glad you could come. Yes. Well, now, all
I really know about what's goin' on here...

211
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,820
is what one of your students
told me on the telephone.

212
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,380
We're just getting organized. If you have
some equipment, find a spot over there.

213
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,140
All right.
We're making this the central lab.

214
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,580
Sure. Well, what are we
actually doing here?

215
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,260
Well, I gotta cover for Leahy over
the weekend. Extra credit seminar. Wow.

216
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,300
Hi, Frank.
Don't leave.

217
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,460
Excuse me.
I have to set up.

218
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,900
Hi.
Hello.

219
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,260
Frankie, who's that?

220
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,420
Susan Cabot.
Radiologist. Married.

221
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,020
Ah. How married?
Very.

222
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,900
Oh. Hi, Doc.
Hi. I'll be workin' upstairs.

223
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,380
I want you to set up the
basic panel down here. Right.

224
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,260
What are you supposed
to be testing?

225
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,660
I don't know.
Compounds? Basic structures?

226
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,260
When I know, you'll know.
Uh, Leahy.

227
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,340
Great.
Science marches on.

228
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,180
Yeah.

229
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,820
Need any help?
No, I'm okay.

230
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,380
There better be a diploma in my
mailbox when I get home on Monday.

231
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,940
I really can't believe this is
happening. I had a date tonight...

232
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,380
with this beautiful young
trial attorney from Century City.

233
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,020
Where were you taking him?
Please, it isn't funny.

234
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,940
<i>What are they doing?
They're watching us.</i>

235
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,620
They started comin' around when
I got here at 9:00 this morning.

236
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,340
I'm Calder. Microbiology.
Brian Marsh.

237
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,940
Walter.
Lomax. Engineering.

238
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Nice meeting you.
Hi.

239
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,540
Lomax.
How you doing?

240
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
So anybody know what
this whole deal's about yet?

241
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,900
Not a clue.
Nobody's got a clue.

242
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,500
I'm getting my doctorate
in theology.

243
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,100
Analysis of ancient scriptures.

244
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,420
This shouldn't be too difficult,
except for the numbers.

245
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,180
It's so wonderful
what you're doing, Father,

246
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,860
opening the church again.

247
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,940
Are you all right?

248
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,860
We're ready.

249
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,260
<i>He's gaining strength.</i>

250
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,380
I can feel it all around us now.

251
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,300
So what's going on?

252
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,300
Something downstairs.

253
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,980
Yeah? What?

254
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,380
I hate to tell you guys,
but this is real bullshit.

255
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,060
I know there's a reason why
nobody's opened this thing yet, right?

256
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,740
Let me have your pen
for a second.

257
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,020
Is this some kind of
toxic crap? Could be.

258
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,700
Okay, but I still don't understand
why we're not taking direct samples.

259
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,380
I mean, what's the big mystery?

260
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,540
<i>Catherine's entering these equations
upstairs. They're translated from Latin.</i>

261
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,420
Differential equations?

262
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,340
From a book written
2,000 years ago.

263
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,300
We hadn't invented
differential equations... Right.

264
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,100
<i>Professor Birack, I don't think
we have too much to worry about.</i>

265
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,860
The lid on that thing won't open.
Look.

266
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,780
It's incredibly elaborate.

267
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,020
Right here, there's a...
there's a weird locking mechanism.

268
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,780
Looks like it can only
be opened from the inside.

269
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,220
I'm going back.

270
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,380
Look at this.

271
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,060
Now, a friend of mine at U.C.L.A.
Did a study of chronic schizophrenics.

272
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,180
<i>They're supposed to have stereotyped routines
that they repeat every 20 minutes or so.</i>

273
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,140
You know, like a stuck record in their brains
repeating the same phrase over and over.

274
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,900
Well, I have been watching them
on and off all day,

275
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,900
and they don't seem
to be making any movements.

276
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,460
They just stand there.
With those kinds of problems,

277
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,540
I say let 'em stand there
if they want to. Ooh!

278
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,100
You okay?

279
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,180
Yeah. I bumped into something
this afternoon.

280
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,300
It's starting to hurt.
Probably nerves.

281
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,740
It's a bruise, Walter.
You don't bruise from nerves.

282
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,140
I used to break out when I was 12.
Doctor said it was homosexual panic.

283
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,500
I'll see you Monday morning.
You got anything for me?

284
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,220
No, I'm afraid not. I'm guessing on the
acidity based upon the corrosion samples.

285
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,860
The figures you gave me.
Yeah.

286
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,060
Well, it can't be that high. Well,
I know, but you asked me to guess.

287
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,900
All right, get outta here.
Good night, sir.

288
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,700
Hey, what's with the "sir" business?
Okay, good night, Sir Doc.

289
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,100
Better.
A lot better.

290
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,780
My God.

291
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,580
Hey, look, can I talk
to you for a minute? Yes.

292
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,380
Nobody's really saying
much of anything here.

293
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,420
We're still putting together the first round of
tests, and nobody's really stopped since we got here.

294
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,780
Get to the point.

295
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,940
Nothing... anywhere ever is supposed
to be able to do what it is doing.

296
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,780
Now, settle down now.

297
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,180
Go back to work. A life form is
growing out of pre-biotic fluid.

298
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,420
It's not winding down into disorder.
It's self-organizing.

299
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,900
It's becoming something.
What?

300
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,260
I mean, an animal?
A disease? What?

301
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,180
The hardest thing to hear for any of
us is something we don't agree with.

302
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,940
"I saw a star fall from heaven
unto the bottomless pit,

303
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,300
and he was cast out
as water from the flood... "

304
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,940
This is crazy.

305
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,380
Man.
Hadn't you seen it yet?

306
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,940
No. For the last four hours, I've been
carbon dating the corrosion on the lid there.

307
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,620
We're talking about
seven million years.

308
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,940
What?
Yeah.

309
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,540
I'm goin' topside.

310
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,860
Want me to wait for you?
No, uh-uh. Go on.

311
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,980
This whole section's a kind of history.
Part of it was indecipherable,

312
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,860
as if someone were deliberately
trying to erase it.

313
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,420
I managed to piece together most of it.
Okay, it kind of starts here.

314
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,660
"The container was buried somewhere
in the Middle East eons ago by... "

315
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,940
It gets a little wild here...
"the father of Satan,

316
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,100
"a god who once walked the earth
before man...

317
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,780
but was somehow banished
to the dark side. "

318
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,140
Apparently, the father
buried his son inside the container.

319
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,940
This was the section
someone was trying to erase.

320
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,620
Now later on here,
"Christ comes to warn us.

321
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,260
He was of extraterrestrial ancestry,
but a human-like race. "

322
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,740
Finally, they determine Christ is crazy,

323
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,380
but he's also gaining power converting a lot
of people to his beliefs, so they kill him.

324
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,580
But his disciples keep the secret
and hide it from civilization...

325
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,060
until man could develop a science sophisticated
enough to prove what Christ was saying.

326
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,820
Something like this can really
fuck up your weekend.

327
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,380
How did the Roman Catholic Church manage
to keep this a secret for 2,000 years?

328
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,660
Apparently, a decision was made...

329
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,140
to characterize pure evil
as a spiritual force,

330
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,220
even within the darkness
in the hearts of men.

331
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,340
It was more convenient.

332
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,740
In that way, man remained
at the center of things.

333
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,660
A stupid lie.
We were salesmen, that's all.

334
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,100
We sold our product...

335
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,820
to those who didn't have it.

336
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,860
The new life.

337
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,940
Reward ourselves,
punish our enemies...

338
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,300
so we can live without truth.

339
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,300
A substance,

340
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,340
malevolence.

341
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,460
That was the truth.

342
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,700
Asleep...

343
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,740
until now.

344
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,060
Help me break this up.
The others shouldn't hear this.

345
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,380
Faith is a hard thing to come
by these days. Look at this.

346
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,940
<i>That thing down therejust directed
a fairly sizable burst of energy.</i>

347
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Directed?

348
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,820
In a straight line... with the precision
of less than a millisecond.

349
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,820
Everybody's acting like we should
really be taking this seriously.

350
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,500
You two aren't taking
this seriously, are you?

351
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,740
What are we supposed to do?
Just go back to work?

352
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,100
What would you rather have,
a wreath of garlic?

353
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,740
A benediction?
A crucifix?

354
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,900
Then it really is Old Scratch
knocking at the door.

355
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,460
<i>A few minutes ago, a vibration was triggered
in the metal on that thing downstairs.</i>

356
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,420
A strong one.
Some kind of...

357
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,220
kinetic emission came out of it.

358
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,220
Now, if it can transmit
a signal strong enough...

359
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,700
It can move other objects...

360
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,900
instantaneously across a distance...

361
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,740
Without outside intervention.

362
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,660
Psychokinesis.

363
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,580
Mind-directed energy.

364
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,220
Don't tell the others yet.
Why not?

365
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,420
They have a right to know that this...
that it... it's conscious.

366
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,740
Not until you prove
it wasn't something else...

367
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,100
a power surge or a draft of air.

368
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,460
All right.

369
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,260
You missed the big history lesson.

370
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,140
You're not gonna believe
what's been going on up here.

371
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,220
Want one?

372
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,540
Anyone ever tell you that
you could pass for Asian?

373
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,660
Whew.

374
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,780
What was that all about?
No sense of humor.

375
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,580
Have you seen Susan?
Who?

376
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,820
Radiologist, glasses.
Oh, yeah. She's right outside.

377
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,980
Where?

378
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,420
She was there. I think
somebody oughta tell her.

379
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,940
Look, am I crazy, or are we
stroking ourselves heavily here?

380
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,660
Thank you for taking the time
to share your thoughts.

381
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,100
Susan?

382
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,340
There's more to it.

383
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,260
There's some kind of power...
directed outward.

384
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,140
A controlled force.

385
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,180
<i>What's it doing?
Reaching out.</i>

386
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,500
Influencing.

387
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,340
Changing things.

388
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,340
Moving objects by thought.

389
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,300
<i>Extraordinary intervention.</i>

390
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,180
Intelligent cause other than man.

391
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,980
Susan?

392
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,460
<i>Hello?</i>

393
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,060
Suppose...

394
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:17,020
what your faith has said
was essentially correct.

395
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,220
Suppose there is a universal mind
controlling everything.

396
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,780
A god willing the behavior
of every subatomic particle.

397
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,540
Now, every particle
has an anti-particle.

398
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,380
Its mirror image.

399
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,740
Its negative side.

400
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,500
Maybe this universal mind...

401
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,820
resides in the mirror image
instead of in our universe...

402
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,420
as we wanted to believe.

403
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,740
Maybe he's anti-God,

404
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,060
bringing darkness instead of light.

405
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,060
Why weren't we told the truth?

406
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,180
<i>Without the technology to confirm,</i>

407
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,060
<i>it would have been another legend.</i>

408
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,580
But he was our prisoner, not yours!

409
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,700
<i>We had a responsibility...</i>

410
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,020
<i>to warn the rest of the world.</i>

411
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,220
Only the corrupt
are listened to now,

412
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,340
and they tell us
what we want to hear.

413
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,580
We believe it to be divine light.

414
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,260
It just got colder in here.

415
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,740
I know.

416
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,940
Suddenly, as if...

417
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,700
as if something...

418
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,340
moved through the room.

419
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,820
Listen, do you realize
what's going on up there?

420
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,140
We are on the brink
of the ultimate truth!

421
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,260
Oh, this priest is a real case.

422
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,300
He is looney tunes, and I'm
beginning to wonder about Birack too.

423
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,860
I'm going back.
Come on, Calder.

424
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,700
Come on, Frank!

425
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,980
You're outta your minds!
This is a joke. This is caca.

426
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,780
Come on!

427
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,900
Caca.

428
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,660
Hello?

429
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,020
Where's Wyndham?
Uh, he left.

430
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,660
When?

431
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,980
<i>Oh, about 20 minutes ago.</i>

432
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,180
We tried to talk him out of it,
but, uh...

433
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,900
Has anyone seen Susan?
Who?

434
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:38,260
The radiologist. Glasses?

435
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,620
<i>Well, maybe she left too.</i>

436
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,060
Maybe they both had
the right idea.

437
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,620
<i>This is not a dream.
Not a dream.</i>

438
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,660
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

439
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,300
<i>We are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro-interference.</i>

440
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,540
<i>You are receiving
this broadcast as a dream.</i>

441
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,340
<i>We are transmitting from the year 1-9...</i>

442
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,300
Walter?

443
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,940
What?
Have you seen Mullins?

444
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,460
What? No.
Susan?

445
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,340
Who?
Radiologist. Glasses.

446
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,460
Come on, man.
I was asleep.

447
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:51,500
We can't find them.
And Wyndham's left.

448
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,740
Couple of the others are talking about leaving.
We're gonna have a meeting in the lab in half an hour.

449
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,060
Mullins left?
I don't know.

450
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,940
I'm gonna go downstairs
and look for him.

451
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,900
Well, since I'm up now.

452
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,860
If I don't come back,
you can have my Porsche.

453
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,460
<i>You are receiving this broadcast in order
to alter the events you are seeing.</i>

454
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,540
<i>Our technology has not developed
a transmitter strong enough...</i>

455
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,820
<i>to reach your conscious
and your awareness.</i>

456
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,700
What were you dreaming?

457
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,940
Your kingdom, Father, does
not include my unconscious.

458
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,900
It's mine, and I may abuse it
any way I wish...

459
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,580
without having to confess
what's in it.

460
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
<i>Something I haven't
told you.</i>

461
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,580
The Brotherhood of Sleep...

462
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,220
Anyone in close proximity...

463
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,340
has the same dream.

464
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,140
<i>The one you had
just now.</i>

465
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,780
Um...
Excuse me, but I...

466
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,340
The guardian priests had
the dream for years.

467
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,060
What does it mean?

468
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,780
A premonition.

469
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,380
The dream evolves,
unfolds.

470
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,740
We shall start to have it
every time we go to sleep.

471
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,380
As if it's pushing
everything else out.

472
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,220
Making room for itself.

473
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,540
Mullins?

474
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,740
Do you think he really
just took off?

475
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,700
I mean, like he was actually
believing this whole business?

476
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,740
Why is everybody
looking at me that way?

477
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,340
'Cause you're being asshole-ish. That's
very asshole-ish of you to say so.

478
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,940
Look, Mullins is probably
off asleep someplace.

479
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,020
Or he's boffing
the radiologist.

480
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,100
I hope he's getting laid. I hope they're both
on their way to a nice Chinese restaurant.

481
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,300
How can you keep
working like this?

482
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,340
It's... 3:30.

483
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,660
No wonder I'm so tired.

484
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,420
I keep getting these figures
in the computer,

485
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,340
but they're not
making any sense.

486
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,740
I stopped making sense
about 15 minutes ago.

487
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,300
No, I mean these equations
are beyond me now.

488
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,380
They're like another language. Mmm.

489
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,980
Go get some sleep.
I'll wake you in half an hour.

490
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,460
Oh, 45 minutes?
Okay.

491
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,140
Hey, are you okay?

492
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,820
No.

493
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,340
I know what you mean.

494
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:39,060
I just want to go home, pretend
none of this is really happening.

495
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,820
What's that?
Hmm?

496
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,380
Oh, it's just a bruise
I got somehow.

497
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,780
Finally stopped hurting.

498
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,700
This looks like a figure
of some kind.

499
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,860
No, I got to close my eyes. Okay.

500
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,980
I'll wake you.
Thanks.

501
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,140
Hello.

502
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,500
I'm opening the door, if you want to stop
what you're doing and put your clothes on.

503
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,020
Big doings in the lab tonight.
There's a meeting.

504
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,460
Oh, give me just 15 minutes.

505
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,860
You want me to come back?
Later.

506
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,220
Any luck?
Can't find anybody.

507
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,700
I'm going up to the lab.
I'll be there in a minute.

508
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,260
We're having a meeting
in the lab.

509
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,500
<i>Lisa.!</i>

510
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,700
Mona Lisa!

511
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,060
Lisa?

512
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,700
This whole building is gonna
have to be encased in concrete.

513
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,700
No way. A building this size? I
say we launch the fucker into space.

514
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,620
I'm hearing something.

515
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,780
Where are the others?
We think they've left.

516
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,980
Kelly's asleep. I didn't
want to wake her up.

517
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,020
I'm asking you to stay.

518
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,860
The work that we do in the
next 48 hours is critical.

519
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,300
How many of you have fallen
asleep tonight? Please, tell me.

520
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,900
<i>Come on. Please.</i>

521
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:07,380
<i>You dreamed... You dreamed about
the front of this church.</i>

522
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,140
About a dark figure coming out.

523
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,700
Didn't you...
Didn't you feel it?

524
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,300
<i>Not like a dream.</i>

525
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,820
<i>Like something else.
Here.</i>

526
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,020
<i>I had the dream too.</i>

527
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,100
This image of something that didn't
seem to belong to my subconscious.

528
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,380
Almost if I was watching
something prerecorded.

529
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,860
<i>Tachyons?
One possibility.</i>

530
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:42,100
<i>What's that?
- It's a Greek word.</i>

531
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,020
It means "swift one. "

532
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,860
So what is the dream?
Huh? Precognition?

533
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:52,180
Previous knowledge
of a future event?

534
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,460
A shared vision of something
that is yet to occur?

535
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,900
<i>Caused by that thing
downstairs? Perhaps not.</i>

536
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,900
Tachyon is a subatomic particle
that travels faster than light.

537
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,780
<i>Supposing it isn't a dream.</i>

538
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,860
Supposing it's a message.

539
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,540
What if these dreams,
premonitions, omens...

540
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,100
<i>What if they're really...</i>

541
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,220
<i>visual messages sent
by other human beings?</i>

542
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,780
Photographs.
Video signals.

543
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,380
<i>From where?
The future.</i>

544
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:25,220
Anything traveling faster
than the speed of light...

545
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,380
would appear to be
going backward in time.

546
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,260
A future scientist calculates
the exact spot...

547
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,500
that the Earth occupied
in space in the past,

548
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,100
given trajectory and speed.

549
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,860
He then beams
a tachyon signal...

550
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,780
at that spot,

551
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,820
transmitting video information
backwards through time.

552
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,100
For us to receive as electrical
impulses, neural stimulus.

553
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:51,180
Man, oh, man.
For what purpose?

554
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,660
<i>Could be a warning.</i>

555
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,260
To show us
what's going to happen.

556
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,580
A sort of...

557
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,020
remote camera view
of the future,

558
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,460
so that we can change it.

559
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:16,300
Someone has finally
shown up to tell us.

560
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,860
I think it's time we stood up
for what we are.

561
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,700
I think there's something wrong with
this. I'm not getting anything now.

562
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,860
It's gone dead.

563
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,980
<i>Maybe the generator's dead. No, it looks
more like the units downstairs were cut off.</i>

564
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,220
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

565
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,060
Hey, Wyndham!

566
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,820
Hello? Hello?

567
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,500
Come here.
Look at this.

568
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,820
I've got a message for you.

569
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,380
And you're not
going to like it.

570
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,580
Look at his chest.

571
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,660
Pray for death.

572
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,820
Jesus Christ!

573
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,860
Calder?

574
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,060
No, Calder!
No! No!

575
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,700
Oh...

576
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,820
no.

577
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,500
Kelly?

578
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,020
Aah!

579
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,100
Hey. Hey, you guys!

580
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,260
They got the back doors
blocked away there.

581
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,660
What the hell's
happening here?

582
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,020
The back doors are locked!

583
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,140
You okay?
Check the windows?

584
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:32,980
<i>What's going on here?</i>

585
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,180
<i>We can't get out.!</i>

586
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,540
- It's in here!
Don't come in here!

587
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,420
Go, go, go!

588
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,740
Lock the door!

589
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,060
Come on!
Get over here!

590
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,220
The sun's coming up.

591
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:47,860
Normally, I love
being dominated by women.

592
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:53,580
Lisa, I'm sorry about
what I said before.

593
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,060
You don't look Asian
at all.

594
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:01,580
Shit.

595
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,700
I thought I heard Walter.

596
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:15,220
Walter? Walter!

597
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,900
<i>What the fuck do you want?
Where are you?</i>

598
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,180
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

599
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,180
Hey. Can you dig through
and get me out of here?

600
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,500
I don't know. The wall's
pretty thick. Are you all right?

601
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:42,140
<i>Well, that's a relative
thing right now, but yeah.</i>

602
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,140
<i>Wait a second.</i>

603
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,540
They're just standing there
outside.

604
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,700
Not trying to get in. They've
stopped attacking for some reason.

605
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,220
Walter, where are you,
exactly?

606
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,180
<i>I'm in this closet.</i>

607
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,460
I think we can
get through with this.

608
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,260
It's gonna take a while.

609
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,620
Walter, we're gonna
try and dig through.

610
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,220
<i>How long will it take?
A couple ofhours.</i>

611
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,940
Oh, great. I'll tell you what.
I'll hang out here anyway.

612
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,580
Well, get ready
to pull me back.

613
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:42,620
<i>Come on, Brian. Come here.
Come on, Brian.</i>

614
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:44,380
Come on! Let's go!
Now!

615
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:47,580
<i>Come on.! Come up here.
Come on, man. Hurry up.!</i>

616
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,380
<i>Come on.! Come on, Brian.</i>

617
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:53,980
<i>Come on.! Come on, Brian.
Come on.!</i>

618
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,940
Come on.

619
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:05,780
You guys seen
any movies you like?

620
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,020
All right.

621
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,660
AJewish mother goes to the airport
to meet her daughter.

622
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,940
The daughter steps off the plane
with an eight-foot-tall Zulu warrior...

623
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:37,780
with a bone through his nose.

624
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:40,020
The mother screams,
"You fool!

625
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,300
I said a rich doctor!"

626
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,180
<i>Not a dream.</i>

627
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:00,140
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

628
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:04,820
<i>We are unable to transmit
through conscious neuro-interference.</i>

629
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:08,180
<i>You are receiving this broadcast
as a dream.</i>

630
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,660
<i>We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9...</i>

631
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,580
We can try the hallway
after it gets dark.

632
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:40,060
If I can make my way up front, I could
break some windows, call for help.

633
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,820
No one out there
can help us.

634
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,780
The other morning you said that
you had something to tell me.

635
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,620
And you probably...

636
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:16,820
think that none of that
matters now.

637
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,220
But you're wrong.

638
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,060
It's the only thing
that does.

639
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:27,260
<i>Worker ants, driven
to a higher purpose,</i>

640
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,780
unknown
to the individual.

641
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:33,100
Street people...

642
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,380
our colleagues,
all controlled.

643
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,500
<i>Demonic possession?
Of a kind.</i>

644
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:45,700
<i>Not what we would
expect, though. Never that.</i>

645
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,900
Why would he need us?

646
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,980
The book says his purpose
is to bring the Father...

647
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,820
back from the dark side,
wherever that is.

648
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:58,380
<i>There could be a limit as to
what he could do, you know,</i>

649
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:01,300
as a volume of liquid.

650
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:06,020
He controls simple
organisms easily.

651
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:10,460
But maybe he needs something more
complex to complete a life cycle,

652
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:12,340
<i>a host in which to live.</i>

653
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:16,660
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

654
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,500
- Walter?
- It's Kelly. She's changing again.

655
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:24,940
<i>The swelling's gone down, as if the
liquid was absorbed into her system.</i>

656
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,380
<i>I can see tissue changes
on her face.</i>

657
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,780
Also, I think
her bone structure is changing.

658
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:34,700
Maybe this is the only way
he could actualize his power.

659
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,900
A parasite
growing into its host.

660
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,980
This could be
some kind of gestation period.

661
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,180
I know I'd seen it before.

662
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,500
Kelly had a mark. It was a
bruise, almost like a figure.

663
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,220
I saw it in a history book...
the astrologer's staff,

664
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:52,940
used in ritual magic
in the middle ages.

665
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,580
The mark was on her?
Yes.

666
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,340
As if she were chosen.

667
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,940
- Walter!
- What?

668
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:05,340
<i>Keep watching her closely.
Anything that you see, tell us.!</i>

669
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,660
I have to go
to the bathroom.

670
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:11,180
God... and Father...

671
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,500
of our Lord...

672
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:18,060
Jesus Christ.

673
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,140
I appeal to your...

674
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,060
holy name,

675
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:27,060
humbly begging that You...

676
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:33,860
will grant us help...

677
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,980
against this...

678
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:44,140
unclean...

679
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:45,980
spirit.

680
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,980
Thou...

681
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,460
tormenteth these creatures...

682
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,420
of hell.

683
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,580
Through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

684
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,620
Look down...

685
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,220
upon these, Thy servants,

686
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:50,060
caught in the coils of...

687
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,980
Where are You?

688
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,180
Christ,

689
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,580
where are You?

690
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,900
Holy shit!

691
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:36,580
<i>Get me the hell out ofhere.!
Help me.! Help me get out ofhere.!</i>

692
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,740
They're gonna kill me!
I don't want to die!

693
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,660
Help me! Help!

694
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:43,060
<i>Help me.!</i>

695
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:46,100
Behind the door. Behind
the door! You can't, Brian!

696
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,420
Oh, God! Help!

697
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:53,460
Help me! Oh.

698
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,060
Hey!

699
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,380
Aah!

700
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,580
Come on!

701
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,940
It's not working!

702
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:57,900
Father!

703
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,660
Father!

704
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,700
I could.

705
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,020
I could.

706
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,020
Unclean spirit.

707
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:38,620
Father.

708
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:44,820
Come to freedom!

709
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,620
No!

710
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:05,180
We stopped it.

711
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:07,260
We stopped it here.

712
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:11,460
<i>Through the grace of God,</i>

713
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,700
<i>I stopped it.</i>

714
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:17,460
The future conjured up by the...

715
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,260
that vile serpent...

716
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,380
will not happen now.

717
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,860
<i>The smaller parts
could not live...</i>

718
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,740
<i>without the strength
of the whole.</i>

719
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:47,060
They had to die,
to fade away,

720
01:32:47,220 --> 01:32:50,700
as the whole was thrown
back and repelled.

721
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,220
We're safe,

722
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,900
but he's waiting
on the other side.

723
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:03,300
She died for us.

724
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:10,020
<i>This is not a dream.
Not a dream.</i>

725
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:14,900
<i>We are using your brain's
electrical system as a receiver.</i>

726
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:19,580
<i>We are unable to transmit through
conscious neuro-interference.</i>

727
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:23,180
<i>You are receiving this broadcast
as a dream.</i>

728
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:28,260
<i>We are transmitting
from the year 1-9-9-9.</i>

729
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:33,300
<i>You are receiving this broadcast in
order to alter the events you are seeing.</i>

730
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,380
<i>Our technology is known to those
with transmitters strong enough...</i>

731
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,500
<i>to reach your conscious
state of awareness.</i>

732
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:41,820
<i>But this is not a dream.</i>

733
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:44,540
<i>You are seeing
what is actually occurring...</i>

734
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,860
<i>for the purpose
of causality violation.</i>
