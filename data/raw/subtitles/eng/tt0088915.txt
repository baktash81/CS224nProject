was I didn't know
how to be a man.

What, uh, what was
your first job
as a dancer?

At the jewel box

I went to audition,

1671

but they weren't
interested in my dancing.

1672
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:04,992
They said, "show
us your legs,"

1673
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:08,529
and they took me
upstairs to this
filthy rat hole.

1674
01:25:08,597 --> 01:25:10,499
And they
shaved my legs

1675
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:12,669
and put a pair of
nylon stockings on me,

1676
01:25:12,736 --> 01:25:14,237

doing this
