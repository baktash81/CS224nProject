00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,662
We're good. Okay, that was perfect.
I loved your passion.

680
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:10,916
And we're glad that you are coming
to our Clemson family, Ray Ray.

681

- Thank you, ma'am.
- He's got good manners.

682
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:14,962
Yes, he does.

683
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:18,090
Your mother has taught you correctly.
Will she be coming to the games?

684
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:23,762
Whenever she can.
She travels a lot with work. So...

685
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,806
Oh, she does? What does she do?

686
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:29,184
She's a travel nurse.

687
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:31,603
Well, that's okay. I hope she gets there,

688
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:34,857
and we welcome you to the Clemson family
and playing in Death Valley.

689
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,066
Go, Clemson.

690
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,902
So? How did I do?

691
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,281
Surprisingly well.

692
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,034
You might be better off
behind the camera than on the field.

693
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,494
Ouch.

694
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,454
That's how you feel?

695
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,416
Don't think I haven't read
the practice reports.

696
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,293
Big difference from high school, huh?

697
00:38:54,501 --> 00:39:01,008
(SIGHS) Yeah, it's hard
when you have ball, class, and...

- Okay. Thanks.
- All right.

Yeah. It's time for you to separate
yourself from the rest of the pack.

Show up, Ray!

What are the five cards?

responsibility, discipline, sacrifice.

hand-picked or walk-on.

We have a problem with Fay.

What kind of problem?

797
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:21,078
He refuses to change into
the school's gym uniform.

798
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,621
He sits out every day.

799

Look, he's only got a few days left.

800
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:27,709
No, I understand.
But it encourages insubordination.

801
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,503
Now, no students wanna wear the uniform.

802
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,213
So, that makes him a leader.

If I can interject.

804
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,385
Ray, the more serious issue here
is Fahmarr's education.

805
00:44:37,928 --> 00:44:41,849
He's years behind where he should be
in reading, math.

806
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,936
My advice? When Fahmarr goes back home,
he should drop a grade.

807
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,604
But he's a smart kid.

808
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,274
He's too smart to be doing this poorly.

809
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,819
When your mom gets out of the hospital,

810
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,821
she should explore counseling for him.

That's 'cause they don't need 'em.

Look around. No one's gonna go through
your pockets and steal your food money.

you dropped some kids' underwear.

No. No kids.

with a bruised quad?

He's already shooting 33% from the field.

She's a drug addict.

For the past month,

1088

I had to bring my little brother
to live with me on campus

while she's in treatment.

1090

That's the underwear you found

1091
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,658
and why I was acting weird towards you.

1092
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,577
Why would you keep that from me?

1093
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:45,497
I didn't want you to see me as baggage.

1094

We all have baggage, Ray.

1095

But taking care of your family
isn't something you hide.

1096

And it's nothing to be embarrassed about.

- What's his name?
- Fahmarr.

I assume your father isn't around.

1105
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:26,580
No. He left
a few years after Fay was born.

1106

Is Fay with your mom again, now?

1107
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:32,211
No. She's in treatment
a little bit longer.

1108

So, he's in a group home.

- Kaycee, I have no choice.

almost cost me my spot on the team.

If it's okay,
I'd love to help get Fay to school.

1532
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:25,347
Yes, God!

1533

(CHUCKLES)

1534
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:28,600
What do you say, huh?

1535
01:28:30,602 --> 01:28:32,855
- Go ahead.
- All right, man. Thank you.

1536
01:28:32,938 --> 01:28:34,815
- Thanks, Ray.

cabinet there? We can do it.

1541
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:48,704
Thank you. God bless you.
We're doing the Lord's work today!

1542

01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:55,502
Thank you so much. Come on!

1545
01:28:55,586 --> 01:28:57,504
God gave you strong backs for a reason!

1546
01:28:57,588 --> 01:28:58,714
How you doing, Ray?

1547
01:28:58,797 --> 01:29:00,132
Let's get this right here.

1548
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:04,344
SAMANTHA: Oh, there they go.

1549
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:08,473
Somebody is gonna be an athlete
like his brother.

1550
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:10,893
- Watch him be the fastest.
- He will be. You're right.

1551
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:12,811
A friendly competition
never hurt anything.

1552
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:15,355
- Yeah. Yeah, he have a lot of energy.
- He sure does.

1553
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:16,940
You know, all three. Oh, my gosh.

1554
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:19,568

in the dorm room. Man!

Coach. It's me.

MIKE: <i>Ray...</i>

1561
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:39,171
I'm here to determine if you've received
any financial assistance

1562
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:41,340
outside of your designated school stipend.

1563
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:43,634
No one's giving me any money.

1564
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:45,928
Okay, that's good.

1565
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:50,057
Have you or your brother received
any rides from coaches and their wives?

1566
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,646
Rides?

1567
01:29:57,523 --> 01:29:59,233
Yes, sometimes.

1568
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:01,610
And you've been
to coaches' homes for meals?

1569
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:03,904
Would you like my wife
to give him an itemized bill?

1570
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:08,116
I'm just doing my job, Coach.
After all, we both work for Clemson.

1571
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,201
Okay.

1572
01:30:10,369 --> 01:30:14,456
I also learned that the church
assisted you with free labor?

1573
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:18,001
Just moving junk to a dumpster,
but I didn't ask them to.

1574
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:19,378
Look, I understand.

1575
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:22,422
But that could be considered
an improper benefit.

1576
01:30:22,506 --> 01:30:23,632
Hold on here a second.

1577
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:27,427
These are people trying to help him
and his little brother out.

1578
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:29,805
Now, Fay living with Ray
is not a violation.

1579
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:32,224
People have visitors all the time.

1580
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:36,061
Look, it's my job to overreact so that
we don't get blind-sided by infractions.

1581
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:37,896
It's a thin line with these things.

1582
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,190
And we prefer
to be on the right side of it.

1583
01:30:40,482 --> 01:30:43,777
(SCOFFS) I appreciate you, Mike.
But your side of the line is crap.

1584
01:30:43,861 --> 01:30:46,655
I wonder if another player
has a sick grandfather

1585
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:48,615
or a mother who can't pay the bills.

1586
01:30:49,408 --> 01:30:52,786
These rules are in place
so that schools recruit players

1587
01:30:53,745 --> 01:30:54,788
instead of buying them.

1588
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:57,374
Look, I'm not thrilled with this.

1589
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,837
But legally, if we're not careful,
this could be an issue.

1590
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,214
We heard you the first time, Mike.
Get to the point.

1591
01:31:07,176 --> 01:31:08,177
Ray,

1592
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:11,388
if you wanna keep playing college ball,

1593
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,141
something's got to give.

1594
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:17,811
I'm sorry.

1595
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,445
(DOOR CLOSES)

1596
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:30,991
I can't send him back.

1597
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:34,411
They'll stick him in a group home.

1598
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,747
Coach, y'all got my back, right?

1599
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:40,250
I have everybody in this building's back.
But it's a fine line, Ray.

1600
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:44,796
The longer Fay is here,
the bigger risk you run

1601
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:47,966
of slipping up with some violation
we don't even see coming.

1602
01:31:49,092 --> 01:31:52,346
We're talking fines, lost scholarships,

1603
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:56,725
- forfeiting wins.
- Can't they make an exception?

1604
01:31:57,267 --> 01:32:00,604
I just want a waiver
that says I can get a little help.

1605
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:04,942
No. You're asking the NCAA
to reverse themselves,

1606
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:06,360
and before a game at that.

1607
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:09,363
I'm not asking them to reverse anything.

1608
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:11,448
Just consider my circumstances.

1609
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:15,035
Ray, I'm considering your circumstances.
But this right here is a Hail Mary.

1610
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:16,787
I don't think we're gonna win this one.

1611
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:20,374
They're asking me to choose
between football and my brother!

1612
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:26,171
But clearly, y'all already chose.

1613
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:34,930
SIMMONS: Ray!

1614
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:39,601
Ray, you will not disrespect us like that
while I am your coach.

1615
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:40,853
You understand that?

1616
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:43,814
We put our jobs on the line for you also.

1617
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,482
This just got bigger than us.

1618
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:48,235
- Okay? So, I get it.
- You don't get it.

1619
01:32:48,318 --> 01:32:51,154
You're helping another Black kid in need
so you can sleep better.

1620
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,865
Stop fronting like you care.

1621
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:56,827
Let me tell you something, son.

1622
01:32:57,619 --> 01:33:00,831
I grew up in $8-a-night motels
with my mother till we got evicted.

1623
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:05,002
So, when I played college ball,
she slept on a cot in my room.

1624
01:33:05,085 --> 01:33:06,503
Does that sound familiar to you?

1625
01:33:08,046 --> 01:33:10,924
So, maybe I do know
a little bit of what you're going through.

1626
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:13,760
And you cannot help
your brother or your mother

1627
01:33:13,844 --> 01:33:16,305
if you get thrown outta here
for violations.

1628
01:33:17,181 --> 01:33:18,724
I can't let him down.

1629
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:22,644
I know, son.

1630
01:33:22,728 --> 01:33:25,647
And you have done more for that kid
than you can ever imagine.

1631
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:30,194
It ain't fair. But it's reality.

1632
01:33:33,572 --> 01:33:36,658
Well, I'm not
accepting that reality again, Coach.

1633
01:33:36,742 --> 01:33:39,203
I'm tired of that excuse
hanging over my life.

1634
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:41,788
So if you and everyone else
is done fighting with me,

1635
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:43,790
I'll fight by myself.

1636
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:46,126
Used to it.

1637
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:54,384
SOLOMON: Thank you. And speaking of which,
you look hungry.

1638
01:33:54,468 --> 01:33:55,969
Eat you some of this.

1639
01:33:56,512 --> 01:33:58,180
FAHMARR: This is caramel, so I like it.

1640
01:33:58,263 --> 01:33:59,848
DANIEL: I'm hungry, too.
Can I get a piece?

1641
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:02,392
Hey, Fahmarr. Where'd you get that?

1642
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:03,644
Solo gave it to me.

1643
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:09,149
Yo! It's literally just a candy bar.

1644
01:34:09,233 --> 01:34:11,443
It's food paid for by the school.

1645
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:13,612
In a few days,
I'm gonna be asking the NCAA

1646
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:15,405
to bend the rules so I can keep you here.

1647
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:17,824
- You think this helps?
- My fault, man.

1648
01:34:19,284 --> 01:34:20,285
I'm sorry.

1649
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:22,162
Ray?

1650
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:24,915
You didn't call.
I wanted to see how you guys were.

1651
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:25,999
We're fine.

1652
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:31,672
KAYCEE: But I drove.
I could take you home.

1653
01:34:31,755 --> 01:34:34,716
Your dad's alumni. He paid for that car.

1654
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,803
No rides, no food, no help. So, stop.

1655
01:34:37,886 --> 01:34:39,513
Everybody, stop.

1656
01:34:39,596 --> 01:34:42,391
We can take care of ourselves
by ourselves.

1657
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:45,644
Hope that article was worth it.

1658
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:47,896
Let's go, Fay.

1659
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,065
SOLOMON: Yo, I'm sorry.
FRESH: Sorry, man.

1660
01:34:50,524 --> 01:34:51,984
SOLOMON: I'll catch you, little bro.

1661
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,402
Goodbye, bro.

1662
01:34:54,278 --> 01:34:56,113
TOBIN: Bye, nephew.
RAY: Fahmarr!

1663
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:57,197
Okay!

1664
01:34:57,906 --> 01:34:59,074
Stop yelling at me!

1665
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:02,786
Why are you so mad, man?

1666
01:35:03,662 --> 01:35:04,830
You need to chill, bro.

01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:09,293
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

1668
01:35:21,889 --> 01:35:22,890
Fay!

1669
01:35:23,974 --> 01:35:26,643
I don't think I should get in.
Thank you, though.

1670
01:35:26,727 --> 01:35:27,853
Sorry, buddy.

1671
01:35:41,533 --> 01:35:43,118
From students, alumni and professors,

1672
01:35:43,202 --> 01:35:45,120
voicing their support
for Ray and his brother.

1673
01:35:45,204 --> 01:35:46,830
We don't like this situation, either.

1674
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:49,666
But between us, Coach,

1675
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:53,253
there's no way he's getting that waiver
passed this week.

1676
01:35:54,171 --> 01:35:55,964
At least you know where you stand on this.

1677
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:58,926
Look, I didn't ask Ray McElrathbey
to take his brother in.

1678
01:35:59,009 --> 01:36:00,093
No, you didn't.

1679
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,513
You're asking him to give him up
or give up his future.

1680
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:07,059
If we have any more perceived violations,
they could sanction the entire program.

1681
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:09,436
And if I'm being candid,

1682
01:36:10,354 --> 01:36:12,481
that's too much to risk for one player.

1683
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:14,441
That's where you and me differ, Mike.

1684
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:17,277
'Cause he's not just one player to me.
He's part of a family.

1685
01:36:17,361 --> 01:36:19,029
I'll take that risk any day of the week.

1686
01:36:20,405 --> 01:36:21,532

that he hasn't been to the bus stop.

Oh, man, oh, man.

01:50:40,182 --> 01:50:43,477
does the board
see such support for a cause,

1871
01:50:44,603 --> 01:50:47,689
and rarely do we have the pleasure

1872
01:50:47,773 --> 01:50:52,194
of hearing from such a dedicated
and impressive student athlete.

1873
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:58,951
However, our emotions
cannot dictate our actions.

1874
01:51:00,661 --> 01:51:03,789
Mr. McElrathbey, what you are asking for
is unprecedented.

1875
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,293
You want the NCAA

1876
01:51:08,919 --> 01:51:11,755
to allow a university and its community

1877
01:51:11,839 --> 01:51:13,882
to provide you assistance

1878
01:51:13,966 --> 01:51:16,510
so you can support
a member of your family.

1879
01:51:20,430 --> 01:51:21,890
And in this case,

1880
01:51:23,976 --> 01:51:25,394
considering the circumstances,

1881
01:51:28,981 --> 01:51:32,484
I find adequate justification
to create precedent.

1882
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:34,528
My vote is yea.

Twenty-year-old Ramon McElrathbey,
known as Ray Ray,

1918
01:55:08,575 --> 01:55:12,371
has been all over the news lately
for something he did off the field.

1919
01:55:12,454 --> 01:55:14,998
Just last year,
he won a full football scholarship

1920
01:55:15,082 --> 01:55:16,500
to Clemson University.

But listen to this.

1924
01:55:21,839 --> 01:55:24,174
After his freshman year, troubles at home

1925
01:55:24,258 --> 01:55:27,177
brought him back to Atlanta
to face another family crisis.
