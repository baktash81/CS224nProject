1
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,439
Honey, have you seen my wallet?

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,151
Isn't it on the bedside table?

3
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,202
Now listen, we're running a little late.

4
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,453
I know.

5
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,539
How do I look?

6
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,207
Perfect.

7
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,126
Is my hair okay?

8
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,752
It's great.

9
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,005
You're not even looking at it.

10
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,674
It's beautiful.

11
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,843
You always look beautiful.

12
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,387
Did you give Roz the phone
and pager numbers?

13
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,056
Yeah, I put it on the fridge.
Let's go.

14
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,266
Coming.

15
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,685
All right.

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,186
I'm ready.

17
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,913
What's the babysitter's name?

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,081
Roz.

19
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,462
Okay, Roz, we're going now.

20
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,548
You look amazing, Mrs. Harford.

21
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,051
Thank you.
Helena, are you ready for bed?

22
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,887
Yes, Mommy. Can I stay up
and watch <i>The Nutcracker?</i>

23
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,014
- What time's it on?
- 9:00.

24
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,892
- You can watch that.
- Can I stay up until you get home?

25
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,145
- No, darling.
- It'll be a little late for that.

26
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,606
The phone number is on the fridge...

27
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,484
...and there's food in there,
so help yourself.

28
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,444
We shouldn't be later than 1:00.

29
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,364
- I'll hold our cab to take you home.
- Thanks, Dr. Harford.

30
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,658
- You be good, baby.
- Good night, Daddy.

31
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,577
- Good night, sweetheart.
- See you in the morning.

32
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,131
- Victor, lllona.
- Bill, Alice.

33
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,842
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you for coming.

34
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,722
- Thanks so much for coming.
- We wouldn't miss it for the world.

35
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,975
Alice, look at you.
God, you're absolutely stunning!

36
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,144
I don't say that to all the women.
Do I?

37
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,105
- Yes, he does.
- He does?

38
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,274
That osteopath you sent me to,
the guy that worked on my arm?

39
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,945
- You ought to see my serve now.
- He's the top man in New York.

40
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,614
I could have told you that,
looking at his bill.

41
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,242
Go inside, have a drink,
enjoy the party.

42
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,161
I'll see you in a little bit.
Thanks for coming.

43
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,176
Do you know anyone here?

44
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,013
Not a soul.

45
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,317
Why do you think Ziegler invites us
to these things every year?

46
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,990
This is what you get
for making house calls.

47
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,295
You see that guy at the piano?

48
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,007
I went to medical school with him.

49
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,592
Really?

50
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,389
He plays pretty good for a doctor.

51
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,727
He's not a doctor. He dropped out.

52
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,316
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

53
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,944
The band's gonna take a break.
We'll be back in 10 minutes.

54
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,696
Thank you.

55
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,789
Let's go over and say hello.

56
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,374
I desperately need
to go to the bathroom.

57
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,587
You go and say hello, and I'll
meet you where? At the bar?

58
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,214
Good.

59
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,059
Nightingale.

60
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,102
Nick Nightingale!

61
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,563
Oh, my God! Bill.

62
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,067
Bill Harford!
How the hell are you, buddy?

63
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,612
- How long has it been?
- I don't know. 10 years?

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,197
And a couple.

65
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,616
- Do you have time for a drink?
- Sure.

66
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,872
You haven't changed a bit.

67
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,959
Thanks, I think.
So how you doing?

68
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,920
Not too bad, you know. Not too bad.

69
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,339
I see you've become a pianist.

70
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,133
Oh, yes. Well, my friends call me that.

71
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,595
How about you?
You still in the doctor business?

72
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,808
You know what they say,
"Once a doctor, always a doctor."

73
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,312
Yes, or in my case,
"Never a doctor, never a doctor."

74
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,566
I never did understand
why you walked away.

75
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,694
It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.

76
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,112
Cheers.

77
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,116
Excuse me.
Nick, I need you a minute.

78
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,951
Be right with you.

79
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,787
I gotta go do something.
If I don't catch you later...

80
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:14,791
...I'll be down at the Village
for two weeks at the Sonata Cafe.

81
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,711
- Stop by if you get a chance.
- I'll be there.

82
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,506
- It's great seeing you.
- Good seeing you too, man.

83
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,426
I think that's my glass.

84
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,763
Oh, I'm absolutely certain of it.

85
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,781
My name is Sandor Szavost.
I'm Hungarian.

86
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,835
My name is Alice Harford.

87
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,213
I'm American.

88
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,757
Delighted to meet you, Alice.

89
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:52,138
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid
on <i>The Art of Love?</i>

90
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,894
Didn't he wind up all by himself...

91
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,897
...crying his eyes out...

92
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,818
...in some place
with a very bad climate?

93
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,947
But he also had a good time first.

94
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,700
A very good time.

95
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,955
Are you here
with anyone tonight, Alice?

96
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,127
With my husband.

97
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,421
Oh, how sad.

98
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:30,093
But then I'm sure he's the sort of man
who wouldn't mind if we danced.

99
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,100
What do you do, Alice?

100
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,021
Well, at the moment...

101
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,190
...I'm looking for a job.

102
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,112
I used to manage
an art gallery in SoHo.

103
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,948
But it went broke.

104
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,535
What a shame.

105
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,789
I have some friends in the art game.

106
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,667
Perhaps I can be of some help.

107
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,131
Thank you.

108
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,902
Someone you know?

109
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,449
My...

110
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,576
...husband.

111
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,292
Don't you think
one of the charms of marriage...

112
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:49,172
...is that it makes deception
a necessity for both parties?

113
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,678
May I ask why a beautiful woman...

114
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,849
...who could have any man in this room,
wants to be married?

115
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,813
Why wouldn't she?

116
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,691
Is it as bad as that?

117
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,362
As good as that.

118
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,864
Do you know Nuala Windsor?

119
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,702
No, and it's very lovely
to meet you both.

120
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,748
How do you spell Nuala?

121
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:29,254
N-U-A-L-A.

122
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,758
You don't remember me, do you?

123
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,554
You were very kind to me once.

124
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,516
Only once?
That sounds like a terrible oversight!

125
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,063
I was doing a photo session
in Rockefeller Plaza...

126
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,898
...on a very windy day...?

127
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:53,278
- And you got something in your eye.
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue.

128
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,240
You were such a gentleman!
You gave me your handkerchief...

129
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,909
...which was also clean.

130
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:05,331
Well, that is the kind of hero
I can be sometimes.

131
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,419
You know why women used to get married,
don't you?

132
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,131
Why don't you tell me?

133
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,886
It was the only way they could
lose their virginity...

134
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,890
...and be free to do
what they wanted with other men.

135
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,143
The ones they really wanted.

136
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,774
Fascinating.

137
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,532
Do you know what's so nice
about doctors?

138
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,621
Usually a lot less than people imagine.

139
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,000
They always seem so...

140
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,461
...knowledgeable.

141
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,299
Oh, they are very knowledgeable...

142
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,344
...about all sorts of things.

143
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,473
But I bet they work too hard.

144
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,769
Just think of all they miss.

145
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,022
You're probably right.

146
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:16,819
Ladies, where exactly are we going?

147
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,030
Exactly?

148
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,993
Where the rainbow ends.

149
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,496
Where the rainbow ends?

150
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,124
Don't you wanna go
where the rainbow ends?

151
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,461
Now that depends where that is.

152
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,338
Well, let's find out.

153
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,383
Excuse me, ladies.
Sorry, Dr. Harford.

154
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,887
Could you come with me for a moment?
Something for Mr. Ziegler.

155
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,391
Fine.

156
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,560
To be continued?

157
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,872
Yeah.

158
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,460
Bill, thanks for coming.

159
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,299
We had a little accident here.

160
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,092
What happened?

161
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,553
Well, she was...

162
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:28,224
She was shooting up
and she had a bad reaction.

163
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,227
What did she take?

164
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,732
A speedball or a snowball
or whatever the hell they call it.

165
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,775
It's heroin and coke.

166
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,739
Heroin and coke?

167
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,534
Anything else?

168
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,456
We had a couple of drinks,
some champagne. That was it.

169
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,624
How long has she been like this?

170
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,336
Maybe five minutes, six minutes,
something like that.

171
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,671
What's her name?

172
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,425
Mandy. Mandy.

173
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,179
Mandy.

174
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,098
Mandy?

175
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,435
Can you hear me, Mandy?

176
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,440
Can you hear me?
Move your head if you can hear me.

177
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,028
Move your head if you can
hear me, Mandy. There you go.

178
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,780
You can hear me.

179
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:28,242
Can you open your eyes for me?
Mandy, can you do that?

180
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,288
Let me see you open your eyes.
There you go, come on.

181
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,458
Come on, look at me. Look at me.

182
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,503
Look at me. Look at me.

183
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,465
Look at me. Look at me, Mandy.

184
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,134
Good.

185
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,970
Good.

186
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,226
I love Victor's art collection,
don't you?

187
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,065
Yes. It's wonderful.

188
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,528
Have you ever seen
his sculpture gallery?

189
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,575
No. I haven't.

190
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:15,164
He has a wonderful collection
of Renaissance bronzes.

191
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,460
Do you like the period?

192
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,340
I do.

193
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,176
I adore it.

194
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,722
The sculpture gallery is upstairs.

195
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,184
Would you like to see it?

196
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,022
I can show it to you.

197
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,528
We won't be gone long.

198
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,912
Maybe...

199
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,585
...not just...

200
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,504
...now.

201
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,485
That was really one hell
of a scare you gave us, kiddo.

202
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,404
Sorry.

203
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,498
How are you feeling now, Mandy?

204
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,668
Better.

205
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:56,807
You are a very, very lucky girl.

206
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,268
You know that?

207
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,147
I know.

208
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,484
You're gonna be okay this time.

209
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,030
But you can't keep doing this.

210
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,282
You understand?

211
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,119
Yeah.

212
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,541
You're gonna need some rehab.
You know that, don't you?

213
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,961
I know.

214
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,798
Okay.

215
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,974
Well, Victor...

216
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,143
...I'll leave the rest to you.

217
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,021
Is it okay if I dress her
and get her out of here?

218
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,984
No, I'd keep her here
for another hour.

219
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,652
Another hour?

220
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,490
Then I'd have someone take her home.

221
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,744
Okay. Okay.

222
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,041
- Good night, Mandy.
- Listen...

223
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,253
...I can't thank you enough for this.

224
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,214
- You saved my ass.
- I'm glad I was here.

225
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,883
Bill, I probably...

226
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,263
I know I don't have to mention this...

227
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,391
...but this is just between us, okay?

228
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,143
Of course.

229
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,936
Thanks.

230
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:49,545
I think I've had
a little too much champagne.

231
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:56,260
I think I have to go
and find my husband now.

232
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:01,098
But I'm sure he'll be all right
on his own a little longer.

233
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,019
Yes...

234
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,064
...but will I?

235
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,441
Of course you will.

236
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,488
No. No, no, no.

237
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,408
I really have to go.
I have to go.

238
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,410
You don't, you know.

239
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,748
Yes, I do.

240
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,542
Alice.

241
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,922
I must see you again.

242
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,343
- That's impossible.
- Why?

243
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,596
Because...

244
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,434
...I'm married.

245
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,834
Good morning, Lisa.

246
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,128
Good morning, doctor.
Your mail.

247
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,214
Good. Please ask Janelle
to bring me my coffee.

248
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,008
- Sure.
- Thank you.

249
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,636
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, doctor.

250
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,848
<i>"'" Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house...</i>

251
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,934
<i>...not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse."</i>

252
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,691
Okay. That's fine.
You can put your gown on.

253
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,114
Hold this for Mommy.

254
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,118
- Looking forward to Christmas?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,496
- Does this hurt?
- Yeah.

256
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,054
- Right there?
- Yeah.

257
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,774
Daddy's gonna like that.

258
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,193
Very good choice.

259
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,321
"-Before me...

260
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:07,743
...when I jump into my bed."

261
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:13,958
We should call the Zieglers
and thank them for the party.

262
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,752
I've taken care of that.

263
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,755
Good.

264
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,093
So how do you feel about wrapping
the rest of the presents?

265
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,972
Let's do that tomorrow.

266
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,145
Tell me something.

267
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:24,403
Those two girls...

268
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,866
...at the party last night...

269
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,707
Did you...

270
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,085
...by any chance...

271
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,796
...happen to...

272
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,217
...fuck them?

273
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,180
What?

274
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,852
What are you talking about?

275
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,526
I'm talking about the two girls...

276
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:08,697
...that you were so blatantly
hitting on.

277
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,369
I wasn't hitting on anybody.

278
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,415
Who were they?

279
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:25,381
They were just a couple of models.

280
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,973
And where did you disappear to
with them for so long?

281
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,642
Wait a minute.

282
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,228
Wait a minute.

283
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:44,525
I didn't disappear with anybody.

284
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,989
Ziegler wasn't feeling too well...

285
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,659
...and I got called upstairs
to see him.

286
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,457
Anyway, who was the guy
you were dancing with?

287
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,508
A friend of the Zieglers.

288
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,595
What did he want?

289
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,931
What did he want?

290
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,394
What did he want?

291
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,273
Sex...

292
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,235
...upstairs.

293
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,155
Then and there.

294
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,159
Is that all?

295
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah, that was all.

296
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,081
Just wanted to fuck my wife.

297
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,920
That's right.

298
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,548
Well, I guess that's understandable.

299
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,720
Understandable?

300
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,765
Because you are a very...

301
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,976
...very beautiful woman.

302
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:07,316
Wait. So...

303
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,153
...because I'm a beautiful woman...

304
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,657
...the only reason any man
ever wants to talk to me...

305
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:21,830
...is because he wants to fuck me.
Is that what you're saying?

306
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:29,296
Well, I don't think it's quite
that black and white...

307
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,345
...but I think we both know
what men are like.

308
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,349
So on that basis...

309
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:45,479
...I should conclude that you
wanted to fuck those two models.

310
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,442
There are exceptions.

311
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,031
And what makes you an exception?

312
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,454
What makes me an exception is that...

313
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,083
...I happen to be in love with you.

314
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,794
And because we're married...

315
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:13,257
...and because I would never
lie to you...

316
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,551
...or hurt you.

317
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,354
Do you realize that
what you're saying...

318
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,858
...is that the only reason you
wouldn't fuck those models...

319
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,652
...is out of consideration for me?

320
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,905
Not because you really
wouldn't want to.

321
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,075
Let's just relax, Alice.

322
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,870
This pot is making you aggressive.

323
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,456
No! It's not the pot. It's you!

324
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,293
Why can't you ever give me
a straight fucking answer?

325
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,087
I was under the impression
that's what I was doing.

326
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,507
I don't even know
what we're arguing about here.

327
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,926
I'm not arguing.

328
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm just trying to find out
where you're coming from.

329
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,142
Where I'm coming from?

330
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:14,318
Let's say-Let's say, for example,
you have some gorgeous woman...

331
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,655
...standing in your office naked...

332
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,575
...and you're feeling her fucking tits.

333
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,577
Now, what I wanna know...

334
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:28,707
I wanna know what you're thinking
about when you're squeezing them.

335
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,128
Alice, I happen to be a doctor.

336
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,881
It's all very impersonal...

337
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,676
...and you know
there's always a nurse present.

338
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,098
So when you're feeling tits, it's
nothing more than your professionalism?

339
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,350
Exactly.

340
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,146
Sex is the last thing on my mind
when I'm with a patient.

341
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,526
Now, when she is having
her little titties squeezed...

342
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,029
...do you think she ever
has fantasies...

343
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,533
...about what handsome Dr. Bill's
dickie might be like?

344
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,915
Come on, I can assure you
sex is the last thing...

345
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,336
...on this fucking hypothetical
woman patient's mind.

346
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,505
And what makes you so sure?

347
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,553
If for no better reason...

348
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,057
...because she's afraid of
what I might find.

349
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:32,729
Okay, okay. So after you tell her that
everything's fine, what then?

350
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,190
What then?

351
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,819
I don't know, Alice...

352
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,613
What then?

353
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,494
Look, women don't...

354
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,207
They basically just don't
think like that.

355
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:59,756
Millions of years of evolution, right?
Right?

356
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,384
Men have to stick it
every place they can...

357
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,762
...but for women, it is just about
security and commitment...

358
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,223
...and whatever the fuck else!

359
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,227
A little oversimplified, Alice.
But yes, something like that.

360
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,398
If you men only knew.

361
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,862
What I do know is you got stoned,
you tried to pick a fight...

362
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,198
...and now you're trying
to make me jealous.

363
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,492
But you're not the jealous type,
are you?

364
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,910
No, I'm not.

365
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,246
You've never been jealous about me,
have you?

366
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:32,414
No, I haven't.

367
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,083
And why haven't you ever
been jealous about me?

368
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,296
Well, I don't know, Alice.
Maybe because you're my wife.

369
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,882
Maybe because you're
the mother of my child...

370
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,885
...and I know you would never
be unfaithful to me.

371
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:49,389
You are very, very sure of yourself...

372
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:50,932
...aren't you?

373
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,559
No.

374
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,103
I'm sure of you.

375
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,201
Do you think that's funny?

376
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,961
All right. Fuck it.

377
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,508
Now we get
the fucking laughing fit, right?

378
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,437
Do you...?

379
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,276
Do you remember
last summer at Cape Cod?

380
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,990
Yes.

381
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,328
Do you remember one night
in the dining room...

382
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,664
...there was this young naval officer...

383
00:31:55,872 --> 00:32:00,419
...and he was sitting near our table
with two other officers?

384
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,004
No.

385
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,845
The waiter brought him a message,
at which point he left.

386
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,722
Nothing rings a bell?

387
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,100
No.

388
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,689
Well...

389
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,695
...I first saw him
that morning in the lobby.

390
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,157
He was checking into the hotel...

391
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,869
...and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage...

392
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,538
...to the elevator.

393
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:45,547
He glanced at me as he walked past.
Just a glance.

394
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,467
Nothing more.

395
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,977
But I could hardly...

396
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,189
...move.

397
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,408
That afternoon...

398
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,748
...Helena went to the movies
with her friend...

399
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,587
...and you and I made love.

400
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:33,178
And we made plans about our future...

401
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,350
...and we talked about Helena.

402
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,770
And yet...

403
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,607
...at no time...

404
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,527
...was he ever...

405
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:54,533
...out of my mind.

406
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:04,918
And I thought if he wanted me...

407
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,256
...even if it was only...

408
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,676
...for one night...

409
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,684
...I was ready to give up everything:

410
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,770
You...

411
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,899
...Helena...

412
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,239
...my whole fucking future.

413
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,118
Everything.

414
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:49,004
And yet it was weird,
because at the same time...

415
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,966
...you were clearer to me than ever.

416
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,515
And at that moment, my love for you...

417
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,436
...was both...

418
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,901
...tender and sad.

419
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,498
I barely slept that night...

420
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,713
...and I woke up the next morning
in a panic.

421
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,886
I didn't know whether I was
afraid that he had left...

422
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,724
...or that he might still be there.

423
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,273
But by dinner...

424
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,738
...I realized he was gone...

425
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,372
...and I was...

426
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,416
...relieved.

427
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,151
Hello.

428
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,239
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

429
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,288
When did it happen?

430
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,797
No, no. I have the address.

431
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,882
Thank you.

432
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,767
Lou Nathanson just died.

433
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,320
I think I have to go over there
and show my face.

434
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,002
- Hello, Rosa.
- Good evening, Dr. Harford.

435
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:21,216
- How is Miss Nathanson?
- Not so good. She's in the bedroom.

436
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,509
Thank you.

437
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,025
Come in.

438
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,407
Marion...

439
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,119
Oh, Dr. Harford...

440
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:53,623
How good of you to come.

441
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,292
I came as soon as I got the message.

442
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,462
- Thank you.
- I'm so...

443
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,965
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

444
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,967
Your father was...

445
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:07,929
He was a very brave man.

446
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,223
Oh, thank you.

447
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,642
How are you holding up?

448
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,646
I'm a bit numb.

449
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,983
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

450
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,361
Would you like to sit down?

451
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,393
It's so unreal.

452
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,688
Daddy had such a good day.

453
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:05,320
His mind was clear,
and he remembered so many things.

454
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,533
Then he had a little dinner...

455
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,162
...and he said he felt like
taking a nap.

456
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:20,376
I went into the kitchen and talked
to Rosa for half an hour at most...

457
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,839
...and when I went to see how he was...

458
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,342
...I just thought he was asleep.

459
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:36,351
Then I realized he wasn't breathing.

460
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,775
Marion, from what you've said...

461
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,029
...I'm sure your father died peacefully
in his sleep.

462
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,991
Oh, God, I hope so.

463
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:59,123
I think I've been more afraid of
the way it was going to happen...

464
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,959
...than his death itself.

465
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,547
Have you had a chance to phone
any of your relatives?

466
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:13,137
I tried to call my stepmother in London,
but she was out.

467
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,557
My boyfriend, Carl,
is making some calls...

468
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,602
...and he'll be coming over soon.

469
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,235
I think you've met Carl here
a few times.

470
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,698
Yes, I remember him.
He's a teacher, isn't he?

471
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,908
A math professor.

472
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,623
We're going to get married in May.

473
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:46,546
Well, that's wonderful news.
Congratulations.

474
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,759
Thank you.

475
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:58,057
Carl has a new teaching appointment
at the University of Michigan.

476
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,393
We'll be moving out there soon.

477
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:05,106
Michigan's a beautiful state.
I think you'll like it a lot.

478
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,694
Yeah.

479
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,824
It really could be a wonderful
change for you, Marion.

480
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,596
Oh, my God, no...

481
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,242
I love you.

482
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,288
I love you.

483
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,166
I love you, I love you, I love you.

484
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,336
I don't want to go away with Carl.

485
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,671
Marion, I don't think you realize-

486
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,173
I do.

487
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:17,428
Even if I'm never to see you again,
I want at least to live near you.

488
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,224
Marion, listen to me. Listen to me.

489
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:27,355
You're very upset right now, and I don't
think you realize what you're saying.

490
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,483
I love you.

491
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,862
We barely know each other.

492
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:39,534
We haven't had a single conversation
about anything except your father.

493
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,410
I love you.

494
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,418
That's probably Carl.

495
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,880
Please don't despise me.

496
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,721
- Hello, Rosa.
- Hello, Mr. Thomas.

497
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,685
- Is she in the bedroom?
- Yes, she is.

498
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,061
Thank you.

499
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:19,407
Come in.

500
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,997
Darling.

501
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,086
I'm so very sorry.

502
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,505
Are you all right?

503
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,549
I'm okay.

504
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:42,013
- Dr. Harford, good evening.
- Good evening, Carl.

505
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,099
Thank you very much
for coming over here tonight.

506
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,269
- It's the least I could do.
- It means a lot to us.

507
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,645
Thank you.

508
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,445
Well, I was actually on my way out.

509
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,449
Marion...

510
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,453
...your father was very proud of you...

511
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,583
...and I know you gave him
great comfort these last months.

512
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,254
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

513
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,136
I'll show you out.

514
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,973
Good night.

515
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,315
Listen to this.
She had a red rose in her mouth.

516
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,026
She was doing a Mexican lap dance
right in my face.

517
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,655
I'm serious!
I got scars on the back of my neck.

518
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,782
What team's this switch hitter
playing for?

519
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,326
- Looks like the pink team.
- Look at this faggot!

520
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,286
Hey, watch it, you faggot!

521
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,789
Merry Christmas, Mary!

522
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,625
- Your butt-brothers are back there!
- Prime cut of meat!

523
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:38,337
You wanna take a ride in this
fudge-tunnel, you stupid faggot?

524
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,299
You should have tits,
you're standing so close!

525
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:46,679
- I got dumps that are bigger than you!
- Come on, macho man!

526
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,057
- You want a piece of this, baby?
- Exit only, honey.

527
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,853
Go back to San Francisco
where you belong, man!

528
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,295
Excuse me.
Do you know what time it is?

529
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,881
Ten past 12.

530
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,135
Going anywhere special?

531
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,597
No, I'm just taking a walk.

532
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,687
How'd you like to have a little fun?

533
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,607
I'm sorry?

534
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,777
Have a little fun?

535
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,614
I just live right down there.

536
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,909
Would you like to come inside with me?

537
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:55,206
- Come inside with you?
- Yeah.

538
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:59,543
It's a lot nicer in there
than it is out here.

539
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,511
You live in there?

540
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,638
Yes.

541
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,932
By yourself?

542
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,976
No. I have a roommate,
but she's not home.

543
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,896
Hey, it's okay.

544
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,732
Listen, no one will bother us.

545
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,276
It's okay. Come on.

546
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,112
Come on.

547
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,681
This is it.

548
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,353
That's a nice tree.

549
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,363
Sorry about the mess.
Maid's day off.

550
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,546
It's...

551
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,507
...cozy. It's a...

552
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,843
...cozy place.

553
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,387
It's okay.

554
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,396
So...

555
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:53,574
Do you suppose we
should talk about money?

556
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,868
Yeah, I guess so.

557
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,622
That depends on what you wanna do.

558
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,669
What do you wanna do?

559
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,717
Well, what do you recommend?

560
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,265
What do I recommend?

561
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,741
I'd rather not put it into words.

562
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,788
How about you just leave it up to me?

563
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:44,959
- I'm in your hands.
- Okay.

564
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,504
And how does 150 sound?

565
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,007
Sounds wonderful.

566
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,932
Don't worry. I don't
keep track of the time.

567
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,774
<i>Thank you.</i>

568
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:09,984
Prego, prego.

569
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,444
- Grazie.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

570
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,906
<i>If I was Italian, he'd have
answered me in Italian.</i>

571
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,865
So...

572
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,493
...shall we?

573
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,263
Excuse me.

574
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,399
Hello.

575
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,526
Hi.

576
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,404
Hi. Is everything all right?

577
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,866
Yeah. I was...

578
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,536
I was just wondering if you
were gonna be much longer.

579
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:51,085
Listen, it's a little difficult
to talk right now.

580
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,712
It could be a while.

581
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,424
Any idea how long?

582
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,636
No, I don't really know.

583
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,806
We're still waiting
for some relatives to arrive.

584
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:10,104
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now.

585
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,857
Okay. Bye-bye.

586
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:32,126
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill?

587
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,596
Yes. Yes.

588
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,981
Do you have to go?

589
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,359
Do I have to go?

590
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,657
I think I do.

591
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,911
Are you sure?

592
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,336
Yes, I'm afraid so.

593
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,426
But listen, I wanna pay you anyway.

594
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,347
How much did you say it was?
Hundred and fifty?

595
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,600
Yeah.

596
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:34,813
But you know what? You don't
have to bother about that.

597
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:36,482
No, it's all right.

598
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,527
- No, really. You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

599
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,282
- Really?
- Really.

600
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,619
Well, thank you very much.

601
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,540
Thank you.

602
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,432
Good evening. Would you like a table
or would you like to sit at the bar?

603
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,435
- I'd like a table.
- Please follow me.

604
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,779
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.

605
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,907
Could I get you anything to drink?

606
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,452
- I'd like a beer.
- Certainly.

607
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,424
One, two, one-two-three-four.

608
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:28,885
That's it for tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.

609
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:33,807
On the bass, Mr. Larry McVey.
On the drums, Kip Fleming.

610
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:38,145
And on the guitar,
the one, the only, Mr. Bobby Berman.

611
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:42,524
We'll be here for the next two weeks,
so please do stop by.

612
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,319
I'm Nick Nightingale. Good night.

613
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,332
- Nick, that was great.
- Thanks.

614
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:02,002
- Nightingale.
- Hey, Bill, you made it.

615
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:05,714
I'm sorry, I got here just as you
were finishing your last set.

616
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,967
That's all right.
The band sucked tonight anyway.

617
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,846
- What are you drinking?
- A vodka and tonic, please.

618
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,432
Thank you.

619
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:19,519
So what brings you out at this hour?

620
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,856
- I have a patient in the neighborhood.
- You live in the Village?

621
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:26,026
No, we have an apartment
on Central Park West.

622
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,569
You're married?

623
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,613
Nine years.

624
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,949
- Any kids?
- Yes, we have a 7-year-old daughter.

625
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,242
How about you?

626
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,037
I've got a wife
and four boys in Seattle.

627
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,705
You're a long way from home.

628
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,792
Well, you gotta go where the work is.

629
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,627
Thank you.

630
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,177
- So is this your band?
- No, it's a pick-up band.

631
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:56,390
- Who do you normally play with?
- Anybody, anywhere.

632
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,059
I got another gig later tonight.

633
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,228
You're playing somewhere else tonight?

634
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,105
They only get started around 2.

635
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:05,107
In the Village?

636
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,737
Believe it or not, I don't actually
know the address yet.

637
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,239
You don't?

638
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:17,619
No. It may sound ridiculous, but it's
in a different place every time...

639
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,664
...and I only get it
an hour or so before.

640
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,583
- A different place every time?
- So far.

641
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:25,919
What's the big mystery?

642
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,923
Hey, man, I just play the piano.

643
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,888
Nick, I'm sorry.
Is there something I'm missing here?

644
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,728
I play blindfolded.

645
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,063
What?

646
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,484
I play blindfolded.

647
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,073
You're putting me on.

648
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:57,784
No, it's the truth.

649
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:03,373
And the last time,
the blindfold wasn't on so well.

650
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,461
Oh, man.

651
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:12,924
Bill, I have seen one or two things
in my life...

652
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,968
...but never...

653
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,804
...never anything like this...

654
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,641
...and never such women.

655
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,567
Well...

656
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,153
Excuse me.

657
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,782
Hello.

658
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,993
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this is Nick.

659
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:47,709
I know where that is.

660
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,301
Right.

661
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,807
Okay. Well, I'm on my way right now.

662
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,060
Okay, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.

663
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,855
What is this?

664
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,026
It's the name of a Beethoven opera,
isn't it?

665
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,111
Nick.

666
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,533
It's the password.

667
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,701
The password?

668
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:26,665
Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry
to do this to you, Bill.

669
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,545
I gotta get going. I gotta go.

670
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,923
Nick...

671
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,554
...you know there is no way on earth...

672
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,558
...that you are going to leave here
without taking me with you.

673
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,895
- Come on, buddy, give me a break.
- Nick, I'll tell you what.

674
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,315
I've already got the password.

675
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,403
Just give me the address.
I'll go there by myself...

676
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,240
...and there won't be any connection
between us whatsoever.

677
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:07,080
Listen, let's just say
for one second...

678
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,208
...that I was prepared to do that.

679
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:13,879
You couldn't get in anyway
in those clothes.

680
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,423
Why not?

681
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:21,136
Because everyone is always
costumed and masked.

682
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,682
Where the hell are you gonna
get a costume at this hour?

683
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,787
Thanks. Keep the change.

684
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,220
<i>Yes? Who is it?</i>

685
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,180
Peter, this is Bill Harford.

686
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:09,809
I apologize for disturbing you
at this late hour, but I need your help.

687
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,854
<i>Who is it that you want?</i>

688
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,400
I'm very sorry.
I'm looking for Peter Grenning...

689
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,111
...the owner of Rainbow Fashions.

690
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,698
<i>What's your name?</i>

691
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,326
My name is Bill Harford.

692
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,703
I'm Mr. Grenning's doctor.

693
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:33,541
<i>- You are Grenning's doctor?
</i>-Yes.

694
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:35,961
<i>Okay.</i>

695
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,004
<i>Just a moment.</i>

696
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,230
You are looking for Peter Grenning?

697
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,023
Yes, I am.

698
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:01,361
He moved to Chicago over a year ago.

699
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,406
He moved to Chicago?

700
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,119
I wasn't aware of that.

701
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,666
Then are you the present owner
of Rainbow Fashions?

702
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,501
Yes, I am.

703
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,877
Well, first of all...

704
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:23,008
...please let me apologize again
for disturbing you at this hour, Mr...

705
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,426
Milich.

706
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,805
Mr. Milich. Just to let you know
that I really am Dr. Harford...

707
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,017
...this is my New York State
Medical Board card.

708
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,895
Okay, so you are Dr. Harford.

709
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:39,524
If I see Peter, I tell him
you were looking for him.

710
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,901
Oh, no, wait. Please, please...

711
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,989
Listen, the reason that
I came here tonight was...

712
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:52,954
Basically, the reason is
that I need a costume.

713
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:57,250
And I'd be happy to pay you
$100 over the rental price...

714
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,044
...for the inconvenience.

715
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:04,007
- A hundred dollars?
- Yes.

716
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,427
I don't think so.

717
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,724
Okay. How about $200?

718
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,935
Two hundred dollars
over the rental price?

719
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:17,896
Yes.

720
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,607
Okay.

721
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:28,948
Come in.

722
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:36,081
Can't be too careful these days.

723
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,418
Please.

724
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,965
Is it any special costume
you are looking for?

725
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,801
Yes.

726
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:54,140
I need a tux, a cloak with a hood
and a mask.

727
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:59,604
- A cloak with a hood and a mask?
- Yes.

728
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:04,067
Okay, I think we'll find something for you.

729
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,486
Follow me, please.

730
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,029
Good.

731
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:20,750
- Looks like alive, huh?
- Yes.

732
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,919
- It's wonderful.
- Come.

733
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,214
So what color cloak?

734
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,384
Red, brown, red?

735
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:31,886
Black.

736
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:35,598
The good doctor wouldn't
like something more colorful?

737
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,518
- I don't think so.
- Clowns, officers, pirates?

738
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,354
No, just the tux, the black cloak-

739
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,690
With a hood and a mask.

740
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,067
- Yes.
- Okay.

741
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,777
May I take your coat?

742
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:52,949
- You are medicine doctor, yes?
- Yes, I am.

743
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:57,745
- I have some problem with my hair.
- Your hair?

744
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,039
It's starting to fall down too fast.

745
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:03,168
I lost, in two weeks, a lot of hair.
Mostly here.

746
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,378
Look at this. Here.

747
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,339
- You see?
- Yes.

748
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,674
And?

749
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,844
I'm afraid this really isn't my field.

750
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,013
What? You can't help me?

751
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,808
No. You should see a trichologist.
It's a hair specialist.

752
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:22,645
Mr. Milich, I've obviously
left things a bit late tonight.

753
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,689
- So if you don't mind-
- Okay, okay.

754
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,858
I'm in hurry too, to get back to bed.

755
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,401
I understand.

756
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,904
So black cloak?

757
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,243
Did you hear something?

758
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,413
Yes.

759
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,165
What is this?

760
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,676
What is it?

761
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,767
What is this?

762
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,116
What on earth is going on here?!

763
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,452
Milich, I can explain everything.

764
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,955
You! What are you doing here?

765
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,957
I promise I'll kill you!

766
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:28,086
And you!
Have you no sense of decency?

767
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:32,131
Gentlemen, have you
no sense of decency?!

768
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:35,969
Milich, are you crazy? We were
invited here by the young lady.

769
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:40,515
Young lady? This is my daughter!
Couldn't you see she's a child?

770
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,518
- You will have to explain to police!
- To the police?!

771
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,604
You little whore!
I kill you for this.

772
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:50,316
I promise, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

773
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,735
Hold on to that girl for me, please!

774
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:56,906
Milich, this is preposterous.
The young lady invited us here.

775
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,200
Couldn't you see she is deranged?!

776
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:04,080
Doctor, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Gentlemen, this is now a police matter.

777
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,874
You will please stay here
until I return.

778
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,751
Let us out of here!

779
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,878
That's out of the question.

780
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,716
Doctor, sorry,
what color did you say?

781
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,509
- Black?
- Black.

782
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:20,763
Gentlemen, please have the goodness
to be quiet for the moment!

783
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:23,224
Couldn't you see
I try to serve my customer?

784
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,392
Sorry.

785
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:28,521
And you, little whore, go to bed
at once, you depraved creature.

786
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,190
I'll deal with you
after I serve this gentleman.

787
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:34,694
You should have a cloak
lined with ermine.

788
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,720
Okay, that's $74.50.

789
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:28,307
Seventy-four fifty. All right.

790
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,977
There's 80.

791
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,313
I promised you 50 bucks
over the meter, right?

792
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:40,027
I'll make that a hundred,
if you wait for me.

793
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,821
Just let the meter run.

794
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:45,366
I'll give you the other half
plus the meter when I get back.

795
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,202
- Okay?
- How long you gonna be?

796
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,831
I don't know, maybe an hour or more.
But maybe only 10 minutes.

797
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,001
I'll leave my stuff here in the back.

798
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,673
- Okay?
- Okay.

799
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,228
Good evening, sir.

800
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,481
Good evening.

801
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,483
Can we be of any help?

802
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,111
I suppose you'd like the password.

803
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,946
If you'd like, sir.

804
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,198
Fidelio.

805
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:28,534
Thank you, sir.
We'll run you up to the house.

806
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:10,243
Good evening, sir.

807
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,786
Good evening.

808
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,704
Password, sir?

809
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,581
Fidelio.

810
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,583
Thank you, sir.

811
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,951
I'm not sure what you
think you're doing.

812
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,204
But you don't belong here.

813
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:34,001
I'm sorry, but I think you've
mistaken me for someone else.

814
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:40,424
Please! Don't be foolish.

815
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,843
You must go now.

816
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:48,933
Who are you?

817
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,310
It doesn't matter who I am.

818
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,313
You are in great danger.

819
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:58,025
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

820
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:05,324
Would you be so good
as to excuse us for a moment?

821
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,839
Have you been enjoying yourself?

822
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:12,344
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

823
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,517
Do you wanna go somewhere
a little more private?

824
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,021
Private?

825
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:27,401
That might be a good idea.

826
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:32,364
Oh, here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

827
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:36,368
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

828
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:39,037
I promise to bring him right back.

829
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:52,176
I don't think you realize
the danger you're in now.

830
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,386
You can't fool them for much longer.

831
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:57,556
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

832
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,560
Why are you telling me this?

833
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:03,729
It doesn't matter.

834
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,063
Who are you?

835
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:10,986
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

836
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:14,406
Will you come with me?

837
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,325
That's impossible.

838
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,576
Why?

839
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:22,039
Because it could cost me my life
and possibly yours.

840
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,084
- Let me see your face.
- No!

841
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:27,920
Go!

842
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,673
Excuse me, sir.

843
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:38,263
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

844
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:40,933
Yes.

845
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:45,354
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

846
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:51,086
Please, come forward.

847
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:26,663
May I have the password, please?

848
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:30,709
Fidelio.

849
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:35,922
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

850
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,924
...for admittance.

851
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:43,638
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

852
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:52,230
The password for the house?

853
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,733
Yes.

854
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,077
I'm sorry, I...

855
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,293
I seem to have...

856
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,588
...forgotten it.

857
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,759
That's unfortunate.

858
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:26,515
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

859
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,601
...or if you never knew it.

860
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:34,940
You will kindly remove your mask.

861
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:56,753
Now...

862
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,047
...get undressed.

863
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:08,682
Get undressed?

864
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:13,061
Remove your clothes.

865
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,993
Gentlemen, please...

866
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:33,540
Remove your clothes.

867
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:37,669
Or would you like us to do it for you?

868
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,297
Stop!

869
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:48,972
Let him go.

870
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,684
Take me!

871
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,731
I am ready to redeem him.

872
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:07,699
You are ready to redeem him?

873
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,119
Yes.

874
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,168
Are you sure you understand
what you're taking upon yourself...

875
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,504
...in doing this?

876
01:28:21,922 --> 01:28:23,298
Yes.

877
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,348
Very well.

878
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,230
You are free.

879
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,858
But I warn you...

880
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,070
...if you make any further inquiries...

881
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:49,241
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

882
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:52,160
...about what you have seen...

883
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:56,873
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

884
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,084
...and your family.

885
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,963
Do you understand?

886
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,255
What is gonna happen to that woman?

887
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,134
No one can change her fate now.

888
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,721
When a promise has been made here...

889
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,141
...there is no turning back.

890
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,685
Go!

891
01:32:02,225 --> 01:32:03,601
Alice.

892
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:10,191
Alice. It's okay. It's okay.

893
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,861
I'm sorry.

894
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:17,949
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

895
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,993
Oh, God.

896
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,997
I just had such a horrible dream.

897
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:27,375
What time is it?

898
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,669
It's a little after 4.

899
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:36,384
- Did you just get home?
- Yes.

900
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:40,889
It took longer than I thought.

901
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,475
You must be exhausted.

902
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,689
Come on, lie down. Lie down.

903
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:57,947
What were you dreaming?

904
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:07,081
Just these weird things.

905
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,792
What was it?

906
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:15,173
It was so weird.

907
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:19,052
Tell me.

908
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,368
We were in a deserted city...

909
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:50,875
...and our clothes were gone.

910
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:54,712
We were naked...

911
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:02,846
...and I was terrified...

912
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:10,311
...and I felt ashamed.

913
01:34:11,396 --> 01:34:13,064
Oh, God...

914
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,406
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

915
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:28,371
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

916
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:36,754
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

917
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,011
I felt wonderful.

918
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:52,186
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

919
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:55,857
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

920
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,740
...and a man walked out of the woods.

921
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:12,290
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

922
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,794
The naval officer.

923
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:23,843
He stared at me...

924
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:31,017
...and then he just laughed.

925
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:36,105
He just laughed at me.

926
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:54,165
But that's not the end...

927
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,501
...is it?

928
01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,921
No.

929
01:36:02,298 --> 01:36:04,592
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

930
01:36:10,515 --> 01:36:12,517
It's too awful.

931
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,145
It's only a dream.

932
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:43,756
He was kissing me...

933
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:52,974
...and then we were making love.

934
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:01,566
Then there were all these
other people around us...

935
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:04,569
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

936
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,322
Everyone was fucking.

937
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:14,746
And then I...

938
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:20,293
I was fucking other men.

939
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,670
So many...

940
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:27,091
...I don't know how many I was with.

941
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:35,141
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

942
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,938
...just fucking all these men.

943
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,071
I wanted to make fun of you...

944
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:52,200
...to laugh in your face.

945
01:37:55,536 --> 01:38:00,458
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

946
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,767
That must have been
when you woke me up.

947
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,479
Shit!

948
01:39:37,555 --> 01:39:40,099
- Hi.
- Hi.

949
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:42,643
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

950
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:51,360
Anything else?

951
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:54,405
No, thank you.

952
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:02,622
Excuse me.

953
01:40:03,623 --> 01:40:06,792
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Cafe?

954
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:10,421
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

955
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:19,472
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

956
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:22,600
He's playing piano
over there right now.

957
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,393
Nick Nightingale?

958
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,438
Sure, he comes in here.

959
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:33,027
Look, maybe you can help me...

960
01:40:33,236 --> 01:40:36,864
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

961
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:39,784
Do you know where he's staying?

962
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:46,624
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

963
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,126
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

964
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,921
I'm actually a very old friend of his.

965
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,007
Well, doctor...

966
01:40:57,468 --> 01:41:01,138
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

967
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,060
Listen, to be perfectly honest...

968
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:10,106
...it's a medical matter.

969
01:41:10,523 --> 01:41:14,819
Some tests. I know he'll wanna
know about them as soon as possible.

970
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:43,014
Excuse me.

971
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:46,934
Hi! How can I help you?

972
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:50,896
Can you please ring Mr. Nightingale's
room for me? Nick Nightingale.

973
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,026
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

974
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:58,154
- He checked out?
- Yes.

975
01:42:00,906 --> 01:42:04,827
- Did he leave a forwarding address?
- No, I'm afraid not.

976
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:07,997
When did he check out?

977
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,459
About 5:00 this morning.

978
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,919
- 5:00?
- Yes.

979
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,714
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

980
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,675
It is a little on the early side, yeah.

981
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,386
Look...

982
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:26,640
...did you notice anything...

983
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:28,434
...I don't know...

984
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:32,188
...unusual about him when he left?

985
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,566
Unusual?

986
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:40,196
- Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?
- No.

987
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,114
No, I'm an old friend of his.

988
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:43,407
Really?

989
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:45,368
I'm a doctor.

990
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:53,084
- Well, Bill...?
- Sure.

991
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:58,339
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

992
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:01,926
...because actually there was
something a little strange...

993
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:04,637
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

994
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,348
Really? What was that?

995
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:20,111
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 a. m...

996
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,530
...with two men.

997
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,282
Big guys.

998
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,786
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

999
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:32,665
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

1000
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,667
...if you know what I mean.

1001
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:38,963
Anyways...

1002
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:45,010
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

1003
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:50,641
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

1004
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:52,852
Scared?

1005
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:54,353
Yes. Yes.

1006
01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:57,231
He said he wanted to check out.

1007
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,318
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

1008
01:44:01,652 --> 01:44:05,531
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

1009
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,453
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

1010
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:12,371
But they saw it and took it...

1011
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,499
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

1012
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:20,296
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

1013
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:23,632
And then they just
took him off in a car.

1014
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:27,219
Do you have any idea where they went?

1015
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:29,555
No, not a clue.

1016
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,106
Well, anyway...

1017
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,861
I certainly appreciate your help.

1018
01:44:44,028 --> 01:44:47,281
Anytime, Bill. Bye.

1019
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:26,070
- Oh, the good doctor!
- Mr. Milich.

1020
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:31,200
- Was your outfit a success?
- Yes, it was. Thank you.

1021
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:33,077
Good, good.

1022
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:38,207
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

1023
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,588
I think you forgot the mask.

1024
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:48,175
- It's not there?
- No, no, no.

1025
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:50,844
Maybe you left it at the party?

1026
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,518
I don't think so.

1027
01:45:59,478 --> 01:46:02,982
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

1028
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:04,191
Sure.

1029
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:10,447
Here we are.

1030
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:16,036
That was 150 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

1031
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:19,665
...25 for the mask. Sorry...

1032
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:24,128
Three hundred seventy-five.

1033
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:28,007
Yes, dear?

1034
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,842
Come, come.

1035
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,054
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

1036
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:38,225
- Hello.
- Hello.

1037
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:46,984
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon. Bye-bye.

1038
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,986
Goodbye, gentlemen.

1039
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:52,573
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
- And you too.

1040
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,784
Well, Dr. Harford...

1041
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:58,621
...here is your receipt.

1042
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:02,207
I'm tearing up your deposits...

1043
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:05,711
...and thanks for the business.

1044
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:13,594
Mr. Milich, last night...

1045
01:47:16,347 --> 01:47:18,849
...you were going to call the police.

1046
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:24,438
Well, things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

1047
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:29,568
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

1048
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:31,987
...anything at all...

1049
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:35,532
...it needn't be a costume.

1050
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:04,228
Come in.

1051
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:08,732
- Tuna salad and black coffee.
- Thanks.

1052
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:12,861
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

1053
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:17,991
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

1054
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:22,579
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not gonna be able to see them.

1055
01:48:22,788 --> 01:48:26,500
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

1056
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:28,627
- ...and make new appointments.
- Sure.

1057
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:33,132
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

1058
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,509
- No problem.
- Okay?

1059
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:19,900
- Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

1060
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,569
Hi.

1061
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:27,157
Any calls for me?

1062
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:31,328
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

1063
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:34,373
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, Daddy.

1064
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:35,791
Hey.

1065
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,918
Look, I got all these right.

1066
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:40,462
- You got all of those right?
- Yeah.

1067
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:42,381
Every single one of them?

1068
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:44,132
That's good.

1069
01:52:44,341 --> 01:52:45,842
You hungry?

1070
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:48,345
Sort of.

1071
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:50,347
Wanna eat at 7?

1072
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,849
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

1073
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:57,020
I have some appointments
at the office.

1074
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:59,273
You have to go out again tonight?

1075
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,482
I'm afraid so.

1076
01:53:00,691 --> 01:53:04,194
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

1077
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,281
We'll see about that, okay?

1078
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:11,994
He could be a watchdog...

1079
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:13,620
We'll see.

1080
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:16,623
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

1081
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:20,460
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

1082
01:53:20,669 --> 01:53:25,257
And Mike has $1.75.

1083
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:29,177
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

1084
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:31,722
$0.75?

1085
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:37,060
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

1086
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:44,067
"How much more" means that
it would be a subtraction.

1087
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:47,237
Yeah, because you're gonna be taking...
Right.

1088
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:50,866
<i>And there were all these
other people around us.</i>

1089
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:53,702
<i>Hundreds of them, everywhere.</i>

1090
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,413
<i>Everyone was fucking.</i>

1091
01:53:57,414 --> 01:54:00,876
<i>And then I...
I was fucking other men.</i>

1092
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:03,879
<i>So many...</i>

1093
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:07,299
<i>.../ don't know how many I was with.</i>

1094
01:55:12,823 --> 01:55:13,824
Hello.

1095
01:55:15,659 --> 01:55:17,285
<i>Hello?</i>

1096
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:21,164
Hello?

1097
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:47,566
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

1098
01:56:18,096 --> 01:56:20,515
- What is it?
- Domino?

1099
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:22,726
No, she's not in.

1100
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,940
Are you expecting her back soon?

1101
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:30,650
No, I'm not.

1102
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:36,114
Okay.

1103
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:40,744
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

1104
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:42,913
Just a minute.

1105
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,755
Can I say who it's from?

1106
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:55,592
Well, just tell her it's from...

1107
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:57,636
...Bill.

1108
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:00,889
- You're Bill?
- Yes.

1109
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:05,101
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

1110
01:57:06,102 --> 01:57:08,563
Well, I suppose I am.

1111
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:11,191
Domino said how nice you were to her.

1112
01:57:12,484 --> 01:57:13,610
Did she?

1113
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:18,448
Why don't you come in for a second?

1114
01:57:21,493 --> 01:57:22,535
Sure.

1115
01:57:43,306 --> 01:57:44,808
I'm Sally.

1116
01:57:45,558 --> 01:57:47,435
Hello, Sally.

1117
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:55,443
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

1118
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,321
No.

1119
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:00,991
I have no idea.

1120
01:58:01,908 --> 01:58:05,203
- You have no idea?
- No.

1121
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:14,337
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

1122
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:19,426
She may not even be coming back?

1123
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:35,066
Well...

1124
01:58:40,155 --> 01:58:41,364
I...

1125
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:45,910
You...?

1126
01:58:46,202 --> 01:58:50,540
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

1127
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:53,501
- Really?
- Yeah.

1128
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:56,713
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

1129
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:00,175
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

1130
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:06,556
I don't know whether to tell you this.

1131
01:59:12,228 --> 01:59:15,065
Why don't you have a seat?

1132
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,525
Let's sit down.

1133
01:59:33,667 --> 01:59:38,046
- I don't quite know how to say this.
- You don't quite know how?

1134
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:46,221
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

1135
01:59:48,765 --> 01:59:53,186
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

1136
01:59:56,272 --> 01:59:59,609
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

1137
01:59:59,776 --> 02:00:03,071
...and it was HIV-positive.

1138
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:17,001
- HIV-positive?
- Yeah.

1139
02:00:31,391 --> 02:00:36,271
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

1140
02:00:40,817 --> 02:00:42,193
Yeah.

1141
02:00:43,486 --> 02:00:46,448
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

1142
02:00:59,502 --> 02:01:02,213
Listen, can I offer you anything?

1143
02:01:02,714 --> 02:01:04,674
A cup of coffee maybe?

1144
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:14,726
No, thank you.

1145
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:21,024
I think...

1146
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,360
...maybe I'd better be going.

1147
02:01:28,782 --> 02:01:30,950
Okay.

1148
02:03:13,219 --> 02:03:14,846
- Taxi!
- Off duty.

1149
02:05:04,664 --> 02:05:07,709
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

1150
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:09,752
I'll bring it over to you.

1151
02:05:09,919 --> 02:05:11,045
Thank you.

1152
02:06:51,104 --> 02:06:52,480
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1153
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:54,106
I'm Dr. Harford.

1154
02:06:54,315 --> 02:06:58,694
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

1155
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:01,030
Could you please
give me her room number?

1156
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:05,034
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

1157
02:07:05,368 --> 02:07:07,912
Curran. Amanda Curran.

1158
02:07:08,121 --> 02:07:10,331
C-U-R-R-A-N?

1159
02:07:11,749 --> 02:07:13,125
Yes.

1160
02:07:14,919 --> 02:07:16,754
Miss Amanda Curran?

1161
02:07:17,547 --> 02:07:18,881
That's right.

1162
02:07:19,549 --> 02:07:23,052
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

1163
02:07:27,098 --> 02:07:28,975
She died this afternoon?

1164
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:32,687
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

1165
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:34,605
I'm sorry.

1166
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:25,448
<i>Because it could cost me my life...</i>

1167
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:28,409
<i>...and possibly yours.</i>

1168
02:10:12,013 --> 02:10:13,556
Hello.

1169
02:10:14,265 --> 02:10:16,058
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

1170
02:10:18,227 --> 02:10:19,520
Tonight?

1171
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:22,356
No, no, no, that's okay.

1172
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:30,114
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes. Okay?

1173
02:10:53,054 --> 02:10:54,347
Come in.

1174
02:10:56,432 --> 02:11:00,144
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

1175
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:03,147
- Let me have your coat.
- I was out anyway. Thank you.

1176
02:11:03,355 --> 02:11:04,732
How about a drink?

1177
02:11:05,316 --> 02:11:06,692
- Are you having one?
- Sure.

1178
02:11:06,859 --> 02:11:09,028
- Okay.
- What would you like?

1179
02:11:09,528 --> 02:11:10,780
Just a little scotch.

1180
02:11:10,988 --> 02:11:12,114
Good.

1181
02:11:14,033 --> 02:11:15,284
How do you take it? Neat?

1182
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:16,577
Please.

1183
02:11:18,287 --> 02:11:20,498
That was a terrific party
the other night.

1184
02:11:20,706 --> 02:11:24,960
- Alice and I had a wonderful time.
- Well, good. Good.

1185
02:11:25,461 --> 02:11:27,254
It was great seeing you both.

1186
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:29,465
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1187
02:11:29,632 --> 02:11:31,008
Were you playing?

1188
02:11:31,509 --> 02:11:34,804
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

1189
02:11:36,055 --> 02:11:38,808
- Beautiful scotch.
- That's a 25-year-old.

1190
02:11:38,974 --> 02:11:41,477
- I'll send you over a case.
- No, please.

1191
02:11:41,685 --> 02:11:44,063
- Why not?
- No.

1192
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:48,317
You feel like playing?

1193
02:11:48,484 --> 02:11:51,821
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

1194
02:11:54,407 --> 02:11:55,866
I was just...

1195
02:11:58,661 --> 02:11:59,745
Listen...

1196
02:12:01,497 --> 02:12:02,998
...Bill...

1197
02:12:06,335 --> 02:12:11,298
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

1198
02:12:13,259 --> 02:12:15,636
...I need to talk to you
about something.

1199
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,763
Sure.

1200
02:12:20,975 --> 02:12:22,643
It's a little bit awkward.

1201
02:12:25,312 --> 02:12:28,190
And I have to be completely frank.

1202
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:32,403
What kind of problem are you having?

1203
02:12:37,074 --> 02:12:39,201
It isn't a medical problem.

1204
02:12:44,832 --> 02:12:46,250
Actually...

1205
02:12:48,169 --> 02:12:50,087
...it concerns you.

1206
02:12:58,804 --> 02:13:00,264
Bill...

1207
02:13:03,142 --> 02:13:06,228
I know what happened last night.

1208
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:13,777
And I know what's been
going on since then.

1209
02:13:18,449 --> 02:13:21,827
And I think you just might...

1210
02:13:23,204 --> 02:13:26,665
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

1211
02:13:39,970 --> 02:13:42,431
I'm sorry, Victor, I...

1212
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:47,645
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1213
02:13:49,772 --> 02:13:52,441
Please, Bill, no games.

1214
02:13:54,610 --> 02:13:56,111
I was there.

1215
02:13:58,030 --> 02:13:59,615
At the house.

1216
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:06,247
I saw everything that went on.

1217
02:14:15,005 --> 02:14:16,507
Bill...

1218
02:14:18,133 --> 02:14:22,096
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1219
02:14:25,724 --> 02:14:29,061
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

1220
02:14:30,271 --> 02:14:31,981
...how you'd even heard about it...

1221
02:14:32,147 --> 02:14:35,818
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

1222
02:14:39,655 --> 02:14:44,577
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

1223
02:14:44,827 --> 02:14:48,038
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

1224
02:14:48,998 --> 02:14:51,959
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

1225
02:14:56,463 --> 02:14:58,257
It wasn't Nick's fault.

1226
02:15:00,092 --> 02:15:01,677
It was mine.

1227
02:15:02,011 --> 02:15:04,096
Of course it was Nick's fault.

1228
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:08,017
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

1229
02:15:08,183 --> 02:15:10,894
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

1230
02:15:11,103 --> 02:15:14,064
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

1231
02:15:18,861 --> 02:15:20,321
Victor...

1232
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:23,657
What can I say?

1233
02:15:30,039 --> 02:15:31,373
I had...

1234
02:15:32,875 --> 02:15:34,418
...absolutely...

1235
02:15:35,377 --> 02:15:39,965
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

1236
02:15:41,425 --> 02:15:43,552
I know you didn't, Bill.

1237
02:15:45,387 --> 02:15:47,473
But I also know that you...

1238
02:15:48,432 --> 02:15:51,060
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

1239
02:15:51,268 --> 02:15:53,062
...and talked to the desk clerk.

1240
02:15:54,605 --> 02:15:56,273
How do you know that?

1241
02:15:58,275 --> 02:16:00,319
Because I had you followed.

1242
02:16:06,241 --> 02:16:07,910
You had me followed?

1243
02:16:10,329 --> 02:16:12,664
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1244
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:14,958
All right? I owe you an apology.

1245
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:17,920
This was for your own good, believe me.

1246
02:16:18,295 --> 02:16:22,299
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

1247
02:16:22,508 --> 02:16:25,719
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

1248
02:16:26,095 --> 02:16:29,473
By now he's probably back
with his family...

1249
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:32,393
...you know, banging Mrs. Nick.

1250
02:16:33,769 --> 02:16:36,980
The clerk said
he had a bruise on his face.

1251
02:16:39,066 --> 02:16:42,277
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

1252
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:46,281
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

1253
02:16:47,116 --> 02:16:51,245
Listen, Bill, I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

1254
02:16:52,663 --> 02:16:54,790
Who do you think those people were?

1255
02:16:55,416 --> 02:16:57,626
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

1256
02:16:57,793 --> 02:17:01,130
If I told you their names-
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

1257
02:17:01,296 --> 02:17:05,134
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

1258
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:10,848
Was it the second password?

1259
02:17:12,224 --> 02:17:13,934
Is that what gave me away?

1260
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:18,355
Yes, finally.

1261
02:17:20,482 --> 02:17:22,818
But not because you didn't know it.

1262
02:17:24,695 --> 02:17:27,614
It's because there was
no second password.

1263
02:17:28,782 --> 02:17:33,328
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

1264
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:36,039
...and you showed up in a taxi.

1265
02:17:36,331 --> 02:17:40,002
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

1266
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:43,338
...made out to you-know-who.

1267
02:17:52,806 --> 02:17:54,641
There was a...

1268
02:17:58,437 --> 02:18:00,272
There was a...

1269
02:18:01,064 --> 02:18:04,526
There was a woman there...

1270
02:18:10,365 --> 02:18:12,075
...who tried to warn me.

1271
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:19,041
I know.

1272
02:18:24,755 --> 02:18:26,548
Do you know who she was?

1273
02:18:31,929 --> 02:18:33,430
Yes.

1274
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:42,231
She was a hooker.

1275
02:18:51,782 --> 02:18:53,492
Sorry, but...

1276
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,662
...that's what she was.

1277
02:19:01,041 --> 02:19:02,209
A hooker.

1278
02:19:10,759 --> 02:19:13,512
Bill...

1279
02:19:17,099 --> 02:19:19,601
...suppose I told you...

1280
02:19:21,228 --> 02:19:24,106
...that everything that
happened to you there...

1281
02:19:25,649 --> 02:19:29,778
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

1282
02:19:29,987 --> 02:19:32,781
...her last-minute intervention...

1283
02:19:32,948 --> 02:19:36,702
...suppose I said that all of that...

1284
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:40,789
...was staged.

1285
02:19:42,875 --> 02:19:46,795
That it was a kind of charade.

1286
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:50,299
That it was fake.

1287
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:56,305
Fake?

1288
02:19:58,056 --> 02:20:00,601
Yes. Fake.

1289
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:14,031
Why would they do that?

1290
02:20:14,907 --> 02:20:16,116
Why?

1291
02:20:17,409 --> 02:20:19,161
In plain words...

1292
02:20:20,037 --> 02:20:22,581
...to scare the living shit out of you.

1293
02:20:23,749 --> 02:20:27,169
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

1294
02:20:27,669 --> 02:20:29,379
...and what you'd seen.

1295
02:20:49,441 --> 02:20:51,068
Have you seen this?

1296
02:21:08,377 --> 02:21:10,379
Yes, I have.

1297
02:21:15,884 --> 02:21:18,971
I saw her body in the morgue.

1298
02:21:27,813 --> 02:21:31,024
Was she the woman at the party?

1299
02:21:38,907 --> 02:21:40,450
Yes.

1300
02:21:43,328 --> 02:21:44,746
She was.

1301
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:57,467
Victor...

1302
02:21:59,094 --> 02:22:01,596
...the woman lying dead in the morgue...

1303
02:22:03,598 --> 02:22:05,517
...was the woman at the party?

1304
02:22:07,936 --> 02:22:09,563
Yes.

1305
02:22:14,151 --> 02:22:19,114
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

1306
02:22:19,948 --> 02:22:23,410
You called it a fake, a charade.

1307
02:22:25,078 --> 02:22:28,457
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

1308
02:22:28,665 --> 02:22:32,544
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

1309
02:22:38,425 --> 02:22:43,138
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

1310
02:22:43,305 --> 02:22:46,141
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

1311
02:22:46,308 --> 02:22:49,811
You wanna know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

1312
02:22:51,063 --> 02:22:54,691
That whole play-acted,
"take me" phony sacrifice...

1313
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:59,529
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

1314
02:22:59,738 --> 02:23:03,366
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

1315
02:23:03,575 --> 02:23:06,661
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

1316
02:23:08,038 --> 02:23:12,417
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

1317
02:23:13,084 --> 02:23:14,836
...and the rest is in the paper.

1318
02:23:15,003 --> 02:23:18,673
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

1319
02:23:18,882 --> 02:23:23,095
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

1320
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:29,476
Come on. It was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

1321
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,520
Remember, you told her so yourself.

1322
02:23:31,686 --> 02:23:35,524
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

1323
02:23:52,415 --> 02:23:56,586
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

1324
02:23:57,045 --> 02:23:59,673
Someone died. It happens all the time.

1325
02:24:01,133 --> 02:24:03,426
But life goes on.

1326
02:24:03,885 --> 02:24:05,303
It always does...

1327
02:24:05,512 --> 02:24:07,013
...until it doesn't.

1328
02:24:08,598 --> 02:24:10,559
But you know that, don't you?

1329
02:27:35,138 --> 02:27:37,682
I'll tell you everything.

1330
02:27:43,104 --> 02:27:45,398
I'll tell you everything.

1331
02:28:37,242 --> 02:28:39,452
Helena's gonna be up soon.

1332
02:28:56,344 --> 02:29:00,598
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

1333
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:26,541
That's nice.

1334
02:29:26,708 --> 02:29:29,377
I could put Sabrina in here.

1335
02:29:30,044 --> 02:29:32,547
It's really pretty.

1336
02:29:32,714 --> 02:29:34,716
It's old-fashioned.

1337
02:29:43,892 --> 02:29:45,101
He's big.

1338
02:29:45,310 --> 02:29:48,730
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

1339
02:29:48,897 --> 02:29:50,190
You do?

1340
02:29:52,567 --> 02:29:54,694
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

1341
02:30:00,742 --> 02:30:02,410
Alice.

1342
02:30:08,833 --> 02:30:10,877
What do you think we should do?

1343
02:30:16,049 --> 02:30:17,592
What do I think we should do?

1344
02:30:17,759 --> 02:30:19,093
Look, Mommy!

1345
02:30:21,721 --> 02:30:23,223
Hey.

1346
02:30:28,436 --> 02:30:31,105
What do I think?
I don't know.

1347
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:35,068
I mean, maybe...

1348
02:30:35,944 --> 02:30:37,612
Hey.

1349
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:50,625
Maybe I think...

1350
02:30:51,292 --> 02:30:53,586
...we should be grateful.

1351
02:30:59,634 --> 02:31:01,219
Grateful...

1352
02:31:01,803 --> 02:31:06,724
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

1353
02:31:07,642 --> 02:31:09,352
...adventures...

1354
02:31:11,813 --> 02:31:14,148
...whether they were real...

1355
02:31:14,649 --> 02:31:16,901
...or only a dream.

1356
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,998
Are you sure of that?

1357
02:31:33,876 --> 02:31:35,545
Am I sure?

1358
02:31:51,352 --> 02:31:53,146
Only as sure as I am...

1359
02:31:53,354 --> 02:31:57,191
...that the reality of one night...

1360
02:31:58,484 --> 02:32:01,362
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

1361
02:32:03,865 --> 02:32:06,242
...can ever be the whole truth.

1362
02:32:13,041 --> 02:32:15,043
And no dream is ever...

1363
02:32:16,878 --> 02:32:18,671
...just a dream.

1364
02:32:27,221 --> 02:32:29,223
The important thing is...

1365
02:32:31,142 --> 02:32:32,894
...we're awake now...

1366
02:32:34,228 --> 02:32:36,564
...and hopefully...

1367
02:32:39,525 --> 02:32:41,778
...for a long time to come.

1368
02:32:45,448 --> 02:32:46,908
Forever.

1369
02:32:49,118 --> 02:32:50,578
Forever?

1370
02:32:52,914 --> 02:32:54,374
Forever.

1371
02:32:56,793 --> 02:33:00,380
Let's not use that word. You know?

1372
02:33:01,714 --> 02:33:03,675
It frightens me.

1373
02:33:13,935 --> 02:33:17,063
But I do love you...

1374
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:21,901
...and you know...

1375
02:33:23,111 --> 02:33:25,238
...there is something very important...

1376
02:33:25,446 --> 02:33:28,157
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

1377
02:33:29,492 --> 02:33:30,785
What's that?

1378
02:33:33,955 --> 02:33:35,456
Fuck.
