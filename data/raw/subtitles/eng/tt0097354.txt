1
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:24,987
- Nixon, Nixon!

2
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,070
Nixon, Nixon!

3
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,478
- Congratulations, Mr. President!

4
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,541
- The next president
of the United States!

5
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,537
- Nixon!

6
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:20,430
- Nixon, Nixon, Nixon,
Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, Nixon!

7
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,070
- Got bars and tone in five.

8
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,860
- Everybody settle down now.

9
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,530
Charlie I still get a
reflection in camera two.

10
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,818
- Check.
- I'm too hot over here.

11
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,740
- You remember
everybody, this is live.

12
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
- Standby.
- And camera one,

13
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,690
start wide--
- Everybody off theater com.

14
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,250
- On both of the flags
and I'll take a slow zoom

15
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,670
into the top of the mics on my cue.

16
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,503
- Okay good.

17
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:43,870
- Just wanna rebalance.
- That's fine.

18
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,020
Video, I still need
more level on the seal.

19
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,580
- Are you gonna get
the south shot for the open?

20
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,680
- Good.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,260
- Okay, one minute to air.

22
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,580
- Mop is on.
- He looks good.

23
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,770
Is he ready for us, he knows
to take the cue from you?

24
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,500
Be cued to talk at 40 after the hour.

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,050
- So we're going
to go from the south lawn

26
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,650
to the seal to the pres at 40.
- Correct.

27
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,520
Where are we on time?
- 30 seconds to air

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,580
and one to the pres.
- Is everybody on

29
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,820
the inner city?
- Bars are up.

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,410
- All have checked in.

31
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,800
Starting countdown, 10, nine--
- Okay standby on the seal

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,760
on C2.
- Eight, seven--

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,640
- Dis to two.
- Six, five, four, three--

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,840
- Okay, 10.
- Two, one.

35
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,940
10 to the pres.

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,840
10, nine, eight--

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,913
- Okay, standby on C1 and his cue.

38
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:30,770
- Seven, six, five, four--

39
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,610
- Dis to C1.
- Three, two, one.

40
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,443
- Cue the pres.

41
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,550
- Last June 17th, while I was in Florida

42
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,810
trying to get a few days'
rest after my visit to Moscow,

43
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,870
I first learned from news reports
of the Watergate break in.

44
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:52,224
I was appalled at this
senseless, illegal action

45
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:55,090
and I was shocked to learn that employees

46
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,340
of the reelection
committee were apparently

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,290
among those guilty.

48
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:03,087
I immediately ordered an
investigation by appropriate

49
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,540
government authorities.

50
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,400
On September 15th, as you will recall,

51
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,790
indictments were brought
against seven defendants

52
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,343
in the case.

53
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:16,216
As the investigations went forward,

54
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:20,710
I repeatedly asked those
conducting the investigation

55
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,050
whether there was any reason
to believe that members

56
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,140
of my administration
were in any way involved.

57
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,470
I received repeated
assurances that they were not.

58
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,260
Until March of this year,
I remained convinced

59
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,140
that the denials were true
and that the charges of

60
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,750
involvement by members of the
White House staff were false.

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,020
However, new information then came to me

62
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,120
which persuaded me that
there was a real possibility

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,580
that some of these charges were true

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,150
and suggesting further that
there had been an effort

65
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,510
to conceal the facts, both
from the public, from you,

66
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,343
and from me.

67
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,900
I was determined that we
should get to the bottom

68
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,240
of this matter.

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,920
And that the truth should
be fully brought out.

70
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,220
No matter who is involved.

71
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,890
Today, in one of the
most difficult decisions

72
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,460
of my presidency, I
accepted the resignations

73
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,860
of two of my closest
associates, Bob Haldeman,

74
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,693
John Ehrlichman.

75
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,190
Two of the finest public
servants it has been

76
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,240
my privilege to know.

77
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,180
I want to stress that in
accepting these resignations

78
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,520
I mean to leave no implication
whatever of personal

79
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,510
wrongdoing on their part.

80
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,660
- Get Mr. Buzhardt
al the Pentagon please.

81
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,520
- Council to
the president John Dean

82
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,420
has also resigned.

83
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,390
- General Haig is
calling, is Mr. Buzhardt in?

84
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,430
I have Mr. Buzhardt for you on line two.

85
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,660
- Whatever may appear--
- Fred.

86
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,493
Al Haig.

87
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,010
We need to talk.

88
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,590
Can you come here this afternoon?

89
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,270
I'll send a car for you.

90
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,168
- Whatever improper activities

91
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,150
may yet be discovered--
- That's fine.

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,380
- In connection
with this whole--

93
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,020
- See you then.
- Sordid affair.

94
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,470
I want the American people, I want you

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,580
to know beyond a shadow of a doubt

96
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,190
that during my term as president

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,820
justice will be pursued fully,
fairly, and impartially,

98
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,010
no matter who is involved.

99
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:33,650
This office is a sacred
trust and I am determined

100
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,140
to be worthy of that trust.

101
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,190
I want these to be the best
days in America's history

102
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,430
because I love America.

103
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,740
I deeply believe that America
is the hope of the world

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,400
and I know that in the quality and wisdom

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,830
of the leadership America
gives lies the only hope

106
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,530
for millions of people all over the world

107
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,230
that they can live their
lives in peace and freedom.

108
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,693
We must be worthy of that hope
in every sense of the word.

109
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,440
Tonight I ask for your prayers.

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,980
To help me in everything that I do

111
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,800
throughout the days of the presidency.

112
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,420
To be worthy of their hopes and of yours.

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,440
God bless America, and God
bless each and every one of you.

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,310
- You know Len Garment.

115
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,920
- Yes, of course, how are you Len?

116
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,620
- Overworked.
- I can believe it.

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,110
- We need your help, Fred.

118
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,630
The Senate Watergate
Committee begin their hearings

119
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,972
in a few days' time and we need a special

120
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,590
White House council to deal exclusively

121
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,270
with the problems that
arise from Watergate.

122
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,420
The president agrees that the feeling is

123
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,940
that you are the man for the job.

124
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,320
- Well what exactly would I have to do?

125
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:30,520
- The president will
tell you that himself.

126
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,800
Len will remain as
council to the president.

127
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,790
Your assignment will be a temporary one.

128
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,620
Like mine.

129
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,050
I'm only doing Bob Haldeman's
job until the president

130
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,130
finds a permanent replacement.

131
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,860
Once we've gotten rid of Watergate,

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,260
you go back to the Pentagon.

133
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,180
It's gonna be a long and bloody struggle.

134
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,920
But we have got to put Watergate behind us

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,770
so that we can get back to
the things that really matter.

136
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,200
- Well, okay, I'll do what I can.

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,700
- Good, that's great.

138
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,009
The president will wanna
see you this afternoon.

139
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,280
- First of all there's the Dean problem.

140
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,122
John Dean is scheduled
to appear before the

141
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:20,530
Watergate Senate Committee next month.

142
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,561
And he's already spreading
stories all over town,

143
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:27,140
trying to give the
impression that I was somehow

144
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,340
involved in the coverup.

145
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,580
Now, this nonsense has got to be stopped.

146
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,400
I can't have that man saying
whatever the hell he wants

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,750
to whoever cares to listen.

148
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,540
- Does he have anything
to back up these stories?

149
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,390
- He says he has.

150
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,320
Told Judge Sirica that he
had removed certain documents

151
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,560
from the White House to
protect them from what he calls

152
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,670
illegitimate destruction.

153
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,070
- Where are these documents?

154
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,050
- He's put them in a safe deposit box.

155
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,680
Given the keys to the judge.

156
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,780
But that's no problem.

157
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,660
We'll get copies of everything.

158
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,630
Take a look, come up with
an explanation for it.

159
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,640
That's job number one, Fred.

160
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,740
We need a totally convincing explanation

161
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,440
for whatever's in those documents.

162
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,490
Okay?

163
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,260
- I'll do what I can, sir.
- You'll do a great job,

164
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,550
I'm sure of it.

165
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,550
Remember this, Fred.

166
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,200
The important thing is the presidency.

167
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,130
It is our duty at all times
to preserve and protect

168
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,580
the integrity of this office.

169
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,820
That must always be your main concern.

170
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,693
Always.

171
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,570
- Mr. President I'd like
you to meet Kate Adams.

172
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,970
Mr. President I'd like you
to meet Major Sandborn.

173
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,803
- Major.

174
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:59,551
Nice to see you this evening.

175
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,530
- Mr. President,.

176
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:05,013
Captain Laurie, Captain
Laurie, nice to meet you.

177
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:05,930
Mr. President I'd like you
to meet Captain Laurie.

178
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,830
- Captain, how are you?

179
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,840
Nice to have you with us.

180
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,760
- On May
24th, my parents hosted

181
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,080
a gala dinner in honor
of the prisoners of war

182
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,430
returning from Vietnam.

183
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,150
It was the largest dinner
ever given in the White House,

184
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,750
and there was the electricity
of excitement in the air.

185
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,310
In a voice gravely with
age yet strong in spirit,

186
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,490
Irving Berlin led all of us
in singing God Bless America.

187
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,350
- I have examined the documents, sir.

188
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,615
Basically they're top secret
plans relating to the expansion

189
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:04,760
of domestic intelligence
activities by the FBI,

190
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,550
the CIA, and military intelligence units

191
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,550
dealing with surreptitious
entries, wiretaps,

192
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,220
mail surveillance, and so on.

193
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,350
The documents were prepared
by one of your aides.

194
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,770
- Tom Huston, yeah.

195
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,970
But he's left, he doesn't
work here anymore.

196
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,350
- Seems that you signed
a paper agreeing with

197
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,618
the Huston Plan and then
four or five days later

198
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:33,510
you canceled it?
- Listen.

199
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,403
This happened several years ago, 1970.

200
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:40,660
All those papers should
have been sent back here.

201
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,820
How the hell did Dean get a hold of them?

202
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,900
- Presumably one of the agencies involved

203
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,060
disregarded your instructions.

204
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,893
- I guess so.

205
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,353
Well.

206
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,180
It's not as bad as it might have been.

207
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,230
I mean the press has been inventing

208
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,170
all sorts of fairy tales
saying that Dean's documents

209
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:02,340
would link Haldeman and
Ehrlichman to Watergate.

210
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,173
- Yes I know.

211
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,213
- And me.

212
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,690
They were hoping to find
something to nail on me.

213
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,623
This stuff you're talking about, it's all

214
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,260
relatively unimportant.

215
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,180
- Yes sir but this sort
of domestic intelligence

216
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,260
gathering, it's clearly illegal.

217
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,220
- I know, I know,
that's why it was canceled.

218
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,320
Listen, we were looking for some kind

219
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,200
of legitimate response to all the trouble

220
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,040
that we had that year.

221
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,030
1970, remember?

222
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,840
Arson, bombing, violence
on the university campuses?

223
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,900
God knows what else.

224
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
- So what do we say?

225
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,780
- Say?

226
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,280
- If Dean decides to use this.

227
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,790
- Well you just say
that these ideas were

228
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,850
considered but rejected
because they weren't

229
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,870
legally acceptable.

230
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,843
Okay?

231
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,830
- There is something else, sir.

232
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,000
- What's that?

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,920
- There's a memo of a
conversation at the White House,

234
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,802
I got this from the CIA,

235
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,040
that seems to imply that
you didn't want the FBI

236
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
to pursue an inquiry into
the source of the money

237
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,710
paid to the Watergate burglars.

238
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,640
That's a reference to the sum of $89,000

239
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,321
that was laundered through Mexico.

240
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:24,660
- Well, memo says that
Haldeman stated it was, quote,

241
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,070
the president's wish,
unquote, that the FBI

242
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,520
should no pursue this matter.

243
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,090
- Was Haldeman correct in saying that?

244
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,240
- Sure, absolutely.

245
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:43,010
It was a question of, you
know, national security.

246
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,150
There's a danger that
we were trying to ensure

247
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,210
that no CIA operations
would be compromised.

248
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,410
National security, Fred.

249
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,590
- But there's
no denying the fact that

250
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,480
the White House

251
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,480
and Ehrlichman, Haldeman,
Dean, we're all involved

252
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,900
in some of the early money decisions.

253
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,340
- How much money do you need?

254
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,207
- I would say these
people are going to cost

255
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:51,070
$1 million over the next two years.

256
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,160
- We could get that.

257
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,090
You, on the money,

258
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,050
if you need the money, I mean,

259
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,830
you can get the money.

260
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,970
Let's say.

261
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,180
- Well I think that we're going--

262
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,370
- What I mean is you could,

263
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,000
you could get $1 million,

264
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,776
and you could get it in cash.

265
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,730
I know where it could be gotten.

266
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,620
I mean it's not easy.

267
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,040
But it could be done.

268
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,440
But, um, the question is who
the hell would handle it?

269
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,010
Former presidential
council John W. Dean III

270
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,860
has told Senate investigators
and federal prosecutors

271
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,600
that he discussed aspects
of the Watergate coverup

272
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,710
with President Nixon or
in Mr. Nixon's presence

273
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,140
on at least 35 occasions between

274
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,250
January and April of this year.

275
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,673
You saw this?

276
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:44,614
- I read that, yeah.

277
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:46,410
- Okay.

278
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,150
Ron Ziegler's on his way over.

279
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,690
Well, I've listened to
some of the other tapes.

280
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,660
We've always had a problem
with that damn conversation

281
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,370
on March 21st, but I
think we can handle that.

282
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,460
- I'm glad you listened to those tapes.

283
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,770
It's good for your own peace of mind.

284
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,560
- As you know, we're up
against ruthless people.

285
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,240
- No no, this puts us
in very good shape now.

286
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,230
We can prepare a proper response.

287
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,680
Maybe we can release our
own version of the events

288
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,270
through Buzhardt.

289
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,450
- But Fred doesn't know
about the taping system.

290
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,100
- No, he knows about
the taping capability

291
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,550
on the phones, but that's it.

292
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,110
- Alright, no further.

293
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,610
We can put out a story to the effect

294
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,930
that Fred has mem coms,
chronologies, telephone reportings,

295
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,050
all that sort of stuff.

296
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,660
Hi Ron, come on in.

297
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,040
We're discussing the Dean
stuff in the Washington Post.

298
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,250
You've heard my summary of the tapes.

299
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,350
How did it strike you?

300
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,250
Was Dean telling me there was a coverup?

301
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,083
- Not at all.

302
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:44,916
But Dean knew.

303
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,000
- Of course he knew it!

304
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,130
He knew all of this.

305
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,210
I mean, god.

306
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,430
Maybe we were talking about a coverup.

307
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,573
Watergate.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,370
I really didn't, I didn't
know what the hell.

309
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,700
I honestly didn't know.

310
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,360
- You'll talk to Buzhardt?

311
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,840
- Yeah yeah yeah, I'll talk to him.

312
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,340
- I spoke to the president.
- Yeah, how was that?

313
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,410
- Okay, not wonderful, but okay.

314
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,910
He's been through his notes of about

315
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,320
20 key meetings and phone
conversations with Dean.

316
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,880
And?

317
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,040
- Well there are contradictions.

318
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,008
- Well.

319
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:37,520
- I suppose that's
inevitable, but it appears

320
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,150
that some of the president's
key advisors and aides

321
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,420
could be implicated in the coverup.

322
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,210
- What about the March 21st conversation?

323
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,160
- Money was mentioned, that's for sure.

324
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,790
You know, to buy silence.

325
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,790
The president says he told
Dean that it was blackmail,

326
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,710
that it was wrong, that it wouldn't work,

327
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,360
that the truth'd come out anyway.

328
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:04,770
Do you think Dean has a case?

329
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,603
- Maybe.

330
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,090
What he can do, what he
almost certainly will do

331
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,240
is to tell the world
about his White House.

332
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:16,750
The wiretappings, the
burglaries, the money laundering

333
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,630
and all the rest of it.

334
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,450
- Did you say this to the president?

335
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,900
- I did.

336
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,000
He said the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,580
were far worse.

338
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,200
- He's right, you know.

339
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,470
What's happened in this administration

340
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,430
happened in spades in others.

341
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,850
Can we talk later?

342
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,120
- Hi Doreen, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

343
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,660
- Any messages?
- Mr. Cox called,

344
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,660
could you call him back?

345
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,940
- I have a problem here, Mr. Buzhardt.

346
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,770
Shortly after I was
appointed special prosecutor,

347
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,590
I spoke to the Assistant
Attorney General Petersen

348
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,220
who told me about a conversation he had

349
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,984
with the president about
John Dean and the allegations

350
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:03,010
he has made to the federal prosecutors.

351
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,400
During the course of this conversation,

352
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
the president said, "I have Dean on tape."

353
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,220
Implying that this tape
recording could prove

354
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,740
that he, the president, was
not involved in the coverup.

355
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,590
- Now hang on, hang on just a minute.

356
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:22,600
The president was talking
to Henry Petersen, right?

357
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,090
- Right.

358
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,687
- And the president said,
"I have Dean on tape."

359
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,560
- That's right.

360
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,780
Do you know if this conversation

361
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,700
between the president and
John Dean could have been

362
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,533
tape recorded?

363
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,090
- No, I do not.

364
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,230
- Well perhaps you could clarify
this for me, Mr. Buzhardt.

365
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,930
- Yes, sure, I'll look into it.

366
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,310
- No no, Petersen's got it all wrong.

367
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,020
He misunderstood me.

368
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,830
I was referring to a Dictabelt,
not a tape recording.

369
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,960
I often dictate a summary of the events

370
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,720
at the end of each day.

371
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,130
That's what I meant, Fred.

372
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,090
That's what I was talking about.

373
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,390
Petersen misunderstood me.

374
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,160
- Mr.
Brezhnev's plane landed

375
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,330
at Andrews Air Force Base on
the afternoon of June 16th.

376
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,720
And shortly thereafter we
began the series of talks

377
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,380
known as Summit II.

378
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,660
On the following Tuesday,
Henry Kissinger and I

379
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,860
boarded helicopters and flew to Camp David

380
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,410
to continue our discussions
with the Soviet leader.

381
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:31,850
I presented Mr. Brezhnev
with an official gift

382
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,030
commemorating his American visit,

383
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,210
a dark blue Lincoln Continental

384
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,100
donated by the manufacturer.

385
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,713
It had black velour
upholstery and a special

386
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:44,457
good wishes greeting
engraved on the dashboard.

387
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,060
- Is this a gift for me?

388
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,793
- Lincoln Continental.
- Lincoln Continental.

389
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:56,662
- Thank you, thank you.

390
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:00,241
This is a very fine machine.

391
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,350
- Yes, it's the best.

392
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,549
- Good, good.

393
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,643
- It's very nice.

394
00:22:08,643 --> 00:22:09,745
- Does he like the color?

395
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,930
- It is his very favorite color, blue.

396
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,708
- Yes, I know, midnight
blue, midnight blue.

397
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,558
Bulletproof.

398
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:36,046
- Brezhnev,

399
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:37,230
collector of luxury cars, did not attempt

400
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,990
to conceal his delight.

401
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,840
He insisted upon trying
it out immediately.

402
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,220
He got behind the wheel
and enthusiastically

403
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,080
motioned me into the passenger seat.

404
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,280
The head of the Secret
Service detail went pale

405
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,350
as I climbed in and he took off

406
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,870
down on of the narrow roads

407
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,547
that run around the
perimeter of Camp David.

408
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,193
- There's a, this is not
such a good section here.

409
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,012
- Brezhnev was used

410
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:15,980
to unobstructed driving in
the center lane in Moscow.

411
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,940
And I could only imagine what would happen

412
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,814
if a Secret Service or Navy jeep

413
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:24,175
had suddenly turned a corner
into that narrow road.

414
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:26,846
- I would take it a little easy.

415
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:33,828
No but, um, you see--

416
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,500
No, um, you see the sign?

417
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,420
Just a little easier.

418
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,253
It's very, very--

419
00:23:42,024 --> 00:23:43,957
No no no no no, please.

420
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,770
I would slow down, I would
take it a little slower.

421
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,599
Mr. Brezhnev, I would...

422
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,205
- No no no no no.

423
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:59,133
Don't worry Mr. President.

424
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,131
- No no no!

425
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:01,165
Slow down!

426
00:24:01,165 --> 00:24:02,310
You're gonna run through the sectional!

427
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,506
This is a bad section, Brezhnev!

428
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,150
Take it easy!

429
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,566
There's an edge coming up!

430
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,411
Brezhnev, keep right!

431
00:24:10,411 --> 00:24:11,412
Slow down!

432
00:24:11,412 --> 00:24:12,427
Slow down!

433
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,320
- This is a very fine automobile.

434
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,960
It holds the road very well.

435
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,674
- Yes, well you're an excellent driver.

436
00:24:39,674 --> 00:24:42,153
I would have never been
able to take that turn

437
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:44,066
at the speed we were traveling.

438
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:52,313
- Thank you.

439
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:53,816
- I am super driver.

440
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:57,780
- General Secretary
says he is super driver.

441
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,613
- Super driver.

442
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,200
- He's joking, he's joking.

443
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,930
Mr. Kissenger.

444
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,130
- Super driver.
- Super driver.

445
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,530
- Super driver.

446
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,423
- How could he say super driver?

447
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,450
- No modern
president could have been

448
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,250
less equipped by nature
for political life.

449
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,490
Painfully shy, Nixon
dreaded meeting new people.

450
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,620
Only the anonymity of
large, approving crowds

451
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,080
could make him feel secure.

452
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:29,190
Few men so needed to be loved

453
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,940
and we so shy about the grammar of love.

454
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,473
- Now Mr. Dean, let's
move on to something else.

455
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,030
Did you discuss any
aspects of the Watergate

456
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,250
at that meeting with the president

457
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,420
on September 15th?

458
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:49,976
In other words, did you tell him anything

459
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:53,310
about what Haldeman knew
or what Ehrlichman knew?

460
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,640
- Well, given the fact that
he told me I'd done a good job

461
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,929
I assumed he was very pleased

462
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,630
with what had been going on.

463
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,350
- Did you
discuss the coverup money

464
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,660
that was being raised and paid?

465
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,520
- No sir.

466
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,160
- Did you discuss the fact of an aide

467
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,610
bringing wiretap
information to Mr. Haldeman?

468
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,463
- No I did not.

469
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,070
- Did you discuss
Haldeman instructing his aide

470
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,620
to destroy all these materials?

471
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,670
- No I did not.

472
00:26:31,651 --> 00:26:34,160
- Did you discuss
the CIA coverup idea?

473
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:36,590
- Did not.

474
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:41,663
- In other words, your
whole thesis on saying

475
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,640
that the president of the United
States knew about Watergate

476
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,140
on September 15th is purely an impression.

477
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,720
There isn't a single shred of evidence

478
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,850
that came out of this meeting--

479
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,770
- Senator, I don't--
- That he knew

480
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,380
anything about it.
- Senator, I don't have

481
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,934
a thesis, I'm reporting the
facts as I am able to recall

482
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:03,330
them, truthfully, to this committee.

483
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,243
- You know what?

484
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,880
- What?

485
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,713
- Nixon's right.

486
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,210
It's legally inconclusive.

487
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,130
- What is?

488
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,880
- Dean's account of the
president's involvement

489
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,780
in this Watergate thing, this coverup.

490
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,690
It sounds authentic.

491
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,120
But it rests entirely on his
own recollection of events.

492
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,350
- So?

493
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,406
- So there's no documentation.

494
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,370
And without documentation,

495
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,231
Dean's story can't be corroborated.

496
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,430
- Meaning they'll find someone.

497
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,380
You know, someone--

498
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,590
- No no, not a chance.

499
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,280
No there's only a few witnesses left,

500
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,730
clerks, secretaries and so on.

501
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,470
They'll be interviewed
by the Watergate staff.

502
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,500
That's just routine.

503
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,849
But nobody expects them to
come up with corroboration

504
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,804
or proof.

505
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:04,713
Without that, there's nothing.

506
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:09,192
It's the end of the road.

507
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,493
- Morning, sir.

508
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,630
What's the matter, sir?

509
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,580
Is something wrong?

510
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,830
- There's one hell of a pain in my chest.

511
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,530
- It's viral pneumonia.

512
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,140
He's going to have to stay
here for about a week.

513
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,340
Above all he needs rest
and plenty of sleep.

514
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,080
- Mr. Butterfield.

515
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,326
You resigned your commission
from the Air Force

516
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,390
to work for Mr. Haldeman.

517
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,690
Is that right?
- Yes sir.

518
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,920
- And what was the name
or title of this job?

519
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,720
- Deputy Assistant to the President.

520
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,380
- Now we received this account from

521
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,177
the White House of the
conversations between the president

522
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:34,250
and Mr. Dean.

523
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,450
Would you look at that?

524
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,540
Can you suggest where such an
account might have originated?

525
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,830
- Where did you get this?

526
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,030
- Mr. Buzhardt provided
it to the committee.

527
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,590
Could that have come from,
say, someone's notes?

528
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:58,140
- No, no, it seems too detailed.

529
00:30:01,006 --> 00:30:03,390
- Dean indicated that there may have been

530
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,660
some facility for taping.

531
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,880
He said that on April
15th, in the president's

532
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,000
EOB office, he had the impression
that he was being taped.

533
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,340
Is it possible that Dean knew
what he was talking about?

534
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,090
- No, Dean didn't know about it.

535
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,070
But that's where this must have come from.

536
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,000
There are tapes in each of
the president's offices.

537
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,320
It's kept by the Secret Service

538
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
and there are only four
men who know about it.

539
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
Dean had no way of knowing about it.

540
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,970
He was just guessing.

541
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,940
Why in God's name did he do it?

542
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,820
- Well I don't think he
realized the full significance

543
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,920
of what he was saying.

544
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,760
- Well I can't believe that.

545
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,010
Look, first tell Fred
Buzhardt to write a letter,

546
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,650
a formal letter, to
the Watergate Committee

547
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,630
saying that the system, the taping system,

548
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:11,657
is the same as, similar,
you'd better say similar,

549
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,900
to the one used by the
previous administration.

550
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,733
- Right.

551
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,810
- And then get it disconnected.

552
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,870
Wires, microphones, every damn thing.

553
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:23,219
- Right.

554
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:26,316
Fred was wondering, he
would like permission to

555
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:27,600
review the tapes.

556
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,513
- No no no.

557
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:31,560
You tell him no.

558
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,600
- Well he thinks the prosecutor
is gonna want those tapes

559
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,289
for evidence and Fred thinks
he should listen to them.

560
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,920
No no no!

561
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,753
Never!

562
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:40,586
Never never!

563
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,270
No one is gonna hear those tapes.

564
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,393
No one.

565
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,320
- Welcome home, Mr. President.

566
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,270
- Thank you, Fred.

567
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,420
How are you, Ollie?
- Fine, Mr. President.

568
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,930
- Archibald Cox wants to see
those tapes, Mr. President.

569
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,500
- Has he asked for them?

570
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,551
- No, not yet.

571
00:32:21,384 --> 00:32:22,560
He will.
- Okay.

572
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,930
We'll refuse.

573
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,960
Executive privilege.

574
00:32:27,263 --> 00:32:28,490
- Well it's not as simple as that, sir.

575
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,010
Those tapes are evidence.

576
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,655
Evidence in a criminal prosecution.

577
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:35,160
- No no no, that's
enough, thank you Ollie.

578
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,710
- Now as special prosecutor,

579
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,430
Cox is in a very powerful position.

580
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,180
You refuse to hand over those tapes

581
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,160
and a subpoena could be issued--

582
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,930
- I don't give a hootin'
hell about Archibald Cox

583
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,848
and those subpoenas and all of this

584
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,370
criminal prosecution stuff.

585
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,070
What we're talking about is
infinitely more important.

586
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,940
Now listen to me, Fred.

587
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,490
No outsider can possibly
comprehend the breadth

588
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,130
of the intimate material
that is on those tapes.

589
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,020
They contain the private
thoughts and comments,

590
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,300
not only of the president,
but of foreign leaders,

591
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,370
congressmen, my staff, my
own family, for god's sake!

592
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,155
If I were to break the
confidence of those who have

593
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:17,530
unburdened themselves in my office,

594
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,900
I would shatter the presidency.

595
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,850
And not just my presidency,

596
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,550
but for all my successors as well.

597
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,430
Now this decision is a matter
of the highest principle.

598
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Those tapes contain the very
essence of the presidency.

599
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,770
You must understand this, Fred.

600
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,723
- Yes, well.

601
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,000
Obviously the president's
private conversations

602
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,940
must be protected.

603
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,000
You're right.

604
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,060
We'll have to claim executive privilege.

605
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,290
There's no alternative.

606
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,490
- Yep.
- I have Attorney General

607
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,190
Richardson on line two, sir.
- Okay, put him through.

608
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,890
Elliot.
- Good morning, Al.

609
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:28,723
- How are you today?

610
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:30,280
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Good.

611
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,050
- Al, listen, I'd like to see you

612
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,390
if you have any free time

613
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,690
tomorrow, is that possible?

614
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,523
Won't take long.

615
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:38,890
- Let me see.

616
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,510
What about 2:30 tomorrow
afternoon, that be any good?

617
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,540
Yes, yes, that's fine, 2:30.

618
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,840
- Okay, see you then.

619
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,196
- So it looks like the
president is refusing

620
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:56,020
to turn over the subpoenaed tapes.

621
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,930
- Well, he's leaning that way.

622
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,000
I told him when I raised the possibility

623
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,300
of handing over the tapes,

624
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,140
he lost his temper.

625
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,970
Swore he'd resign first.

626
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,680
Makes you wonder what's on those tapes.

627
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,480
- Yes, I wondered that too.

628
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,590
- I've never seen him so worked up.

629
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,853
Never.

630
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,930
Elliot, do me a favor.

631
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,070
Tell Archibald Cox to
back off a little bit.

632
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,550
Not to be so inflexible.

633
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,600
- I can't do that.

634
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,850
- Try, Elliot.

635
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:42,770
There is a real danger that
the president will fire Cox

636
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,530
if he's not reined in.

637
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,840
- I don't want
a confrontation, Al.

638
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,673
- Neither do I.

639
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,290
But if we have to have a confrontation,

640
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,080
I guess we'll have it.

641
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,830
- There's something else you should no.

642
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,530
Has nothing to do with Watergate.

643
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,890
Do you remember I told you about

644
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,580
the federal prosecutors in Baltimore

645
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,380
that were investigating
the vice president's

646
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,540
financial affairs?

647
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,540
- Yeah, some vague allegations
about illegal payoffs?

648
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,890
- Well there's rather
more to it than that.

649
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:16,670
The allegations are extremely serious,

650
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,416
conspiracy, extortion,

651
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,050
bribery, tax fraud.
- What?

652
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,940
- Well there's potentially indictable

653
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,610
on more than 40 counts.

654
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,590
- What about Agnew, what does he say?

655
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,650
- Well he's very bitter about it,

656
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,010
he says it's a political vendetta,

657
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,510
but the case against him
looks, well, bad.

658
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,360
To say the least.

659
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,710
- How bad?

660
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,543
- Cut and dried.

661
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,533
- Well.

662
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,873
Thanks, Elliot.

663
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:51,790
That's all we need.

664
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,670
- Hi Rose, how are you today?

665
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,770
- Fine, thank you sir.

666
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,480
- Listen, about these subpoenaed tapes.

667
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,759
- I think it might be a good idea

668
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:12,470
if we prepared some kind of transcript.

669
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,560
Not a complete transcript,
that would take forever.

670
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,050
- But, you know.

671
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,640
Some kind of summary.

672
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,540
What do you think?

673
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,690
- Yes, I could do that.

674
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,890
- Just the conversations subpoenaed

675
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,590
by the special prosecutor, okay?

676
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,670
- Yes.

677
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,970
- You're a fast typist,
shouldn't take long.

678
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,803
- Yes sir.

679
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:41,640
- On
Saturday, October 6th,

680
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,701
we received a cable from our ambassador

681
00:37:43,701 --> 00:37:44,850
in Tel Aviv.

682
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,450
Reporting that Syria and
Egypt were in a final

683
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,070
countdown for war.

684
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,280
It was Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.

685
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:53,620
The one day of the year when Israel

686
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,160
was least able to defend itself.

687
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,760
It was hard for me to believe that the

688
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,110
Egyptians and Syrians would have moved

689
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,725
without the knowledge of the Soviets

690
00:38:02,558 --> 00:38:04,270
if not without their direct encouragement.

691
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,696
Four days later on October
10th, Ted Agnew resigned.

692
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:15,531
A federal court in Baltimore sentenced him

693
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:18,790
to three years' probation
and a $10,000 fine.

694
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,250
I wrote him a letter in which I said

695
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:25,770
I have been saddened by
this whole course of events

696
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,330
and I hope that you and your
family will be sustained

697
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,890
in the days ahead.

698
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,330
By a well-justified pride in
all that you have contributed

699
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,163
to the nation.

700
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,940
- Okay Elliot, here's the plan.

701
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,940
The president will personally listen to

702
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,890
the subpoenaed tapes and
then he will supervise

703
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,020
the preparation of transcripts
that will be handed

704
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,176
to the court as a substitute
for the tapes themselves.

705
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:52,770
How do you feel about that, Elliot?

706
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,603
- I'll tell you one thing,

707
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:55,930
the special prosecutor will never agree.

708
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,740
- The hell with Cox.

709
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,260
You know how the
president feels about him.

710
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,460
If he objects, he'll have to go.

711
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,650
- Go?
- He'll be fired.

712
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,080
I remember warning you of this.

713
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,090
- If you're worried
about the authentication

714
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,650
of the transcripts,
that's all taken care of.

715
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,350
Now we've spoken to Senator Stennis

716
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,370
and he's gonna make a comparison

717
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,940
between the transcripts and the tapes.

718
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,400
Then we'll present his
authenticated version to the court.

719
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,210
That should keep everybody happy.

720
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,430
- Have you spoken to the
prosecutor about this?

721
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,520
- Will you stop worrying
about Cox, for god's sake?

722
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,280
The president is offering a
perfectly reasonable compromise

723
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,780
and if Cox objects, he'll have to go.

724
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,863
Am I right?

725
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,763
- That's right.

726
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,130
- As you all know, there
has been in this evidence

727
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,248
not proof perhaps in some
instances, but clearly

728
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:51,450
prima facie evidence of serious wrongdoing

729
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:54,060
on the part of high government officials.

730
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,440
Wrongdoing involving an effort
to cover up other wrongdoing.

731
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,270
Last night we were told
that the court order

732
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,559
would not be obeyed and that the papers,

733
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,290
the memoranda and documents
of that kind would not be

734
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,150
provided at all.

735
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,020
And that instead of the
tapes, a summary of what

736
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,640
they showed would be provided.

737
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,600
The other main part of
the president's statement

738
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,260
said that I would be instructed not to use

739
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,630
the judicial process in
order to obtain tapes,

740
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,270
documents, and memoranda relating to other

741
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,760
presidential conversations.

742
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,610
Now this instructs me not
to pursue what would be

743
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,970
the normal course of a prosecutor's duty

744
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,190
in conducting this kind
of an investigation.

745
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:37,710
I think these instructions
are inconsistent with pledges

746
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,170
that were made to the United States Senate

747
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,910
and through the Senate
to the American people

748
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,400
before I was appointed and before

749
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,090
Attorney General Richardson's
nomination was confirmed.

750
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,970
Now for me to comply
with these instructions

751
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,590
would violate my solemn
pledge to the Senate

752
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,558
and to the country to
invoke judicial process

753
00:40:55,558 --> 00:41:00,558
to challenge exaggerated
claims of executive privilege.

754
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:03,700
I will not violate that promise.

755
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,533
- Okay.

756
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,550
Tell Elliot Richardson to fire him now.

757
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,723
Elliot.

758
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,660
I want you to delay
your decision to resign.

759
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,510
- I'm sorry sir, that's not possible.

760
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,880
- I need to show strength.

761
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,380
Brezhnev would never
understand if I didn't fire Cox

762
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,880
after all of this.

763
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,230
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

764
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,600
- Yes, I'm sorry too.

765
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,520
I'm sorry you feel you have to act

766
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,708
on your commitment to
Cox and his independence

767
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:48,170
and not to the larger public interest.

768
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:52,520
- Maybe your perception and my perception

769
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,020
of the public interest differ.

770
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:15,930
- Now I know many of you are on deadline,

771
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,430
I have a brief statement
to give you at this time.

772
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,786
President Nixon has tonight
discharged Archibald Cox.

773
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,170
Special prosecutor in the Watergate case.

774
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,810
Before taking this action,
the president met this evening

775
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,515
with Attorney General Richardson.

776
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:36,820
The Attorney General, on hearing
of the president's decision

777
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,520
felt obliged to resign
as he felt the discharge

778
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,590
of Mr. Cox to be inconsistent
with his confirmation

779
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,640
and the conditions thereof in the Senate.

780
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:50,126
As the Deputy Attorney General,
Mr. William Ruckelshaus

781
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:53,770
refused to carry out the
president's explicit directive

782
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,080
to discharge Mr. Cox.

783
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,617
He, like Mr. Cox, has been
discharged of further duties

784
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,997
effective immediately.

785
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:24,880
- Okay Fred, where do we go from here?

786
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,700
- Well, options are scarce, sir.

787
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,960
We can either defy the court
order to turn over the tapes

788
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,870
or we can comply.

789
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,969
- Any other alternatives?

790
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:35,990
- Not really.

791
00:43:36,954 --> 00:43:39,220
If we don't turn over
the tapes, Judge Sirica

792
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,080
will almost certainly order a hearing

793
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,940
which means your attorneys will have to go

794
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,470
into court and argue why the president

795
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,677
should not be held in contempt.

796
00:43:48,677 --> 00:43:50,540
That could be an ugly situation.

797
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,373
- Yep.

798
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,680
- Outright defiance could lead to...

799
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,410
Well, it could end in impeachment.

800
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,243
- Yep.

801
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,953
Well.

802
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:06,310
Least we got rid of Cox.

803
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:13,570
So, what are you saying, Fred?

804
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,370
You're saying we have no choice.

805
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,203
- Not really.

806
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,540
However, there is a positive side to this.

807
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,890
Turning over the tapes
could have real shock value

808
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,050
that would show everybody
that Cox was not fired

809
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,400
because of damaging
information on those tapes.

810
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,380
- That's right.

811
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,210
- Turning them over
would be precisely what

812
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,210
nobody would expect.

813
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:43,540
- Okay.

814
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:45,663
Comply.

815
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,860
- Sir, Len Garment says that

816
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,360
some of the tapes are missing.

817
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,373
- Is that true, have you checked?

818
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:58,390
- Frankly it's pretty
hard to check on anything.

819
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,950
There's no real index or storage system.

820
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,990
Everything seems to be
in a hell of a mess.

821
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,530
- Well look, maybe we got the
dates mixed up or something.

822
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,430
Is it really important?

823
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,380
- The April 15th tape
is extremely important.

824
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,870
We can't find either the tape

825
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,040
or the Dictabelt you mentioned.

826
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,870
- You mean--

827
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,230
- The one you mentioned
in the conversation

828
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,760
with Henry Petersen, remember?

829
00:45:24,974 --> 00:45:27,420
You said you had Dean on tape.

830
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,920
You told me it was a Dictabelt.

831
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,870
We talked about it.

832
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,240
- Yeah.

833
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,710
So it's been lost.

834
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:35,850
These things happen.

835
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:36,729
- Sir.

836
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,335
The point is, I have to testify

837
00:45:40,335 --> 00:45:42,470
before Judge Sirica next week.

838
00:45:43,378 --> 00:45:45,214
It'd look bad if the court were told

839
00:45:45,214 --> 00:45:47,835
that both the tape and the Dictabelt

840
00:45:47,835 --> 00:45:50,430
for that particular
date were gone missing.

841
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,930
- Okay, don't testify.

842
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,840
I'll invoke attorney-client privilege.

843
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,490
- I don't think that's a good idea.

844
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:59,323
- Why not?

845
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,402
- It's bad enough me
being dragged into court;

846
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:05,090
to invoke attorney-client privilege

847
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,490
would just add fuel to
this whole coverup thing.

848
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,480
- Why don't we make a new Dictabelt?

849
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,760
- Sir...

850
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,880
- I've got some notes somewhere.

851
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,780
My own personal notes.

852
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,070
We can use those, it
shouldn't be too difficult.

853
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,860
- Sir that would be
manufacturing evidence.

854
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,660
We don't wanna get involved in that.

855
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,520
- No, you're right.

856
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:34,790
Okay, fine.

857
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,760
Keep looking for the tapes, okay?

858
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,200
They should be around somewhere.

859
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,290
- Mr. Buzhardt, did you
have personal knowledge

860
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,000
of the existence of a tape
recording made by the president,

861
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,474
dictated by him following
the meeting with John Dean

862
00:46:57,474 --> 00:46:59,090
on the 15th of April?

863
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,020
- I will answer it this
way, Mr. Ben-Veniste,

864
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,170
I have never seen such.

865
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,480
- You have never seen such.

866
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,730
- I have never seen such.

867
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:12,588
- Now as a matter of fact, there is no

868
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:15,910
Dictabelt conversation of
the president's recollections

869
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:17,776
of his meeting with Mr. Dean.

870
00:47:17,776 --> 00:47:19,030
Isn't that so?

871
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:25,120
- That is correct, we have
not been able to locate one.

872
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:09,280
I'm looking for Mr. Garment.

873
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,740
Len.
- Fred.

874
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,260
- Apologies, but we've got to talk.

875
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,805
- What's the problem?

876
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:27,805
- Well, I was sitting
back at the office and I,

877
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,782
I was wondering what the
hell we're gonna do next.

878
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,600
And I suddenly said to
myself, this is ridiculous.

879
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,540
We are in an impossible situation.

880
00:48:39,538 --> 00:48:41,210
We're trying to defend a man

881
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,350
who does absolutely nothing to help us.

882
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,740
We need answers, he won't give us any.

883
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,865
- Here you go, gentlemen.

884
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:50,067
- We need...

885
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,363
- There.

886
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,290
- We need evidence to defend him,

887
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,630
all we get is excuses.

888
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,260
Now we cannot go on like this!

889
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,093
- I agree.

890
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:04,560
- I mean I, I keep telling myself

891
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,260
that I'm defending the presidency,

892
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,640
but the point is by
defending Richard Nixon

893
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,540
are we in fact harming the presidency?

894
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,520
I mean just look at this
situation objectively.

895
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,330
44 separate bills have been
introduced in Congress,

896
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,006
all of them relating to Watergate,

897
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:25,220
half of them calling for an
impeachment investigation.

898
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,050
Now how can we as lawyers justify

899
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,670
what we're trying to do here?

900
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,900
- Now Fred, stop blaming yourself.

901
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,360
If anyone's to blame, it's the president.

902
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,490
He's at the center of everything.

903
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,260
We've got time bombs everywhere.

904
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,060
Some of them already
gone off, others are just

905
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,710
laying there ticking and there's nothing

906
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,780
we can do about it.

907
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,280
- There's plenty we can do about it.

908
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,640
We can talk to him.

909
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,919
No more time wasting.

910
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:48,090
We can fly down to Florida
and see him tomorrow evening.

911
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,490
- That wouldn't make us very popular,

912
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,250
he's supposed to be having a rest.

913
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,980
- Well, for god's sake
this country is in a state

914
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,820
of virtual revolution!

915
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,500
We can't just stand by and do nothing,

916
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,330
we've got to talk to him right now!

917
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,163
- And say what?

918
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,010
- Tell it like it is.

919
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,910
Tell him straight, lay it on the line.

920
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,860
- Just a minute, just a minute.

921
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,150
What the hell are you trying to say?

922
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,710
- I'm not trying to say anything.

923
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,050
I am telling you that
the president means--

924
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,210
- Don't bother, I've heard this before.

925
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,550
- Ron, Ron!

926
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,090
You better listen to
this, this is the truth

927
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,820
and it's about time we all faced it.

928
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,570
- Don't give me that, it's just panic.

929
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,040
You just lost your nerve.

930
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,240
- Okay, we're scared.

931
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,090
So should you be.

932
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,430
We've done everything we
can to defend the president,

933
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,950
now we have to protect ourselves.

934
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,780
That includes you and Al.

935
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,170
If we don't handle this very carefully

936
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,500
we could all be cited for
obstruction of justice.

937
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,380
- That's just nonsense.

938
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,380
I mean all that stuff about the president

939
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,110
suggesting we make a new Dictabelt,

940
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,030
that wasn't a serious proposal,

941
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,939
he was just thinking out loud!

942
00:51:25,939 --> 00:51:27,670
- How do you know that?

943
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,690
How do we know what to believe?

944
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,178
- Okay.

945
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,380
Okay.

946
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,680
So what's the bottom line?

947
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,950
- It's our recommendation
that the president resign.

948
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,310
- God almighty.
- What?

949
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,340
You're not serious.
- Yes, we are.

950
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,400
- How the hell can you
come to that conclusion?

951
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,720
He wasn't being serious
about a new Dictabelt

952
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,700
for god's sake!

953
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:58,260
God knows how many outrageous
ideas he comes up with,

954
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,640
then he makes a decision,
that's the way he operates!

955
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,740
Now you know that, Fred!
- Ron, Ron,

956
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,350
it's not just the Dictabelt.

957
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:08,410
- Wiretaps, breaking and entering,
interfering with the FBI,

958
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,900
not to mention all the financial stuff,

959
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,460
the income tax problem,
god knows what else.

960
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,610
The water is full of sharks.

961
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,940
- Len, come on, you know
that hounding the president's

962
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,210
become the national mania.

963
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,190
- That's right!

964
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,830
That's right, it's just panic.

965
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:22,590
Resignation is absolutely
out of the question.

966
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,160
- No Ron, you can't say that.

967
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,920
It's an option we have to consider.

968
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,820
- And so has the president.

969
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,653
- Right.

970
00:52:28,653 --> 00:52:29,720
- Let's be practical.

971
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,880
We haven't got a vice president.

972
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,180
We can't do anything until
Gerry Ford is confirmed

973
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,260
by the Congress.

974
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,820
- That's only a matter of days.

975
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,830
- Okay, fine.

976
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,290
Let's say we recommend that Nixon resign.

977
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,390
Do you have any idea
what the impact will be

978
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,910
on foreign policy?

979
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,030
The Middle East could blow
up into a major crisis.

980
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,150
Do you really think that Gerry Ford

981
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,140
is experienced enough to handle that?

982
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,000
- Now listen Al.

983
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,870
Watergate has crippled the president.

984
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,620
It's crippled his capacity to lead.

985
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,010
- What's happened to
everyone's sense of loyalty?

986
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:04,210
It's not your job to judge these matters.

987
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,700
- We don't want the president to go out

988
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,490
and hang himself, we just
want him to understand

989
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,140
the reality of the situation.

990
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,840
- You're both turning against him.

991
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,196
- That's not true.

992
00:53:15,196 --> 00:53:17,140
- Ron, look at the facts, will you?

993
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,420
The president's position...

994
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,040
It's absurd!

995
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,152
His explanations aren't
being bought by the judge,

996
00:53:24,152 --> 00:53:27,740
the special prosecutor, the public.

997
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,310
Even the traditional Nixon
supporters on the Hill

998
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,980
aren't buying any of it.

999
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,050
Now I know there's no
immediate solution to this

1000
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,520
but the least we can do is
tell the man the bad news.

1001
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,820
The situation is perilous.

1002
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,430
- Okay, here's what we'll do.

1003
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,630
I will go to him and tell
him why you're in Florida

1004
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,950
and why you wanna see him.

1005
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:53,602
Okay?

1006
00:53:57,765 --> 00:54:01,753
- Okay.

1007
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:39,230
- The president doesn't want to see you.

1008
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,150
I'm sorry, I told him why you came

1009
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,660
and I said that it isn't a question

1010
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,580
of your doubting his innocence,

1011
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,560
just his chances of survival.

1012
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,730
He's in a deep depression, Fred.

1013
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,700
He doesn't wanna see
anyone, he doesn't wanna

1014
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,533
talk to anyone.

1015
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,150
I'm sorry.

1016
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,150
I know how you feel.

1017
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,000
Anyway, there is a feeling
that we need to establish

1018
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,830
a kind of damage limiting operation.

1019
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,210
- What does that mean?

1020
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,380
- Well, it means that
someone needs to listen

1021
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:21,620
to the subpoenaed tapes
to make an assessment.

1022
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:25,050
The president wants you to do it.

1023
00:55:25,883 --> 00:55:26,860
I know.

1024
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,820
I know, it's gonna be one hell of a job.

1025
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,230
- I thought he said he didn't want anybody

1026
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,640
listening to those tapes but him.

1027
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,120
- Times have changed.

1028
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,547
Since those tapes are
going to Judge Sirica,

1029
00:55:37,547 --> 00:55:40,860
we need an analysis of each conversation

1030
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,550
so that we can make the appropriate claim

1031
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,540
for executive privilege.

1032
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,080
I wish there was someone
else to do it, Fred,

1033
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,100
but there's not.

1034
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,140
- The reason I thought
we oughta talk this morning

1035
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:01,140
is because in our conversations
I have the impression

1036
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,030
that you don't know everything I know.

1037
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,760
- That's right.
- And it makes it

1038
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,010
very difficult for you
to make judgments that

1039
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,630
only you can make.
- That's right.

1040
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,410
- On some of these
things, and I thought that--

1041
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,780
- You've got, in other words,

1042
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:22,000
I've got to know why you feel
that something, well, that--

1043
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,600
- Let me--
- That we shouldn't

1044
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,690
unravel something.

1045
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,960
- Let me give you my overall first.

1046
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,220
- In other
words, you, your judgment

1047
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,840
as to where it stands and where we go now.

1048
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,300
- I think, I think
that there's no doubt about

1049
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,950
the serious of the
problem where we've got,

1050
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,750
we have a cancer within
most of the presidency

1051
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,710
that's growing, it's growing daily.

1052
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,460
It's compounding, it
grows geometrically now

1053
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,880
because it compounds itself.

1054
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,990
It'll be clear as I
explain some of the details

1055
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,360
of why it is and it
basically is because one,

1056
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,360
we're being blackmailed, two,
people are going to start

1057
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,820
perjuring themselves very
quickly that have not

1058
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,890
had to perjure themselves
to protect other people

1059
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,380
down the line and that is just...

1060
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,660
And there is no assurance--
- Bet or go bust.

1061
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,850
- That we'll bust.

1062
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:30,670
- Richard, there is some
confusion about one of the tapes.

1063
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:31,540
- Which one?

1064
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,580
- June 20th.

1065
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:36,470
- Is that the one Rosemary
Woods told me about?

1066
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,080
- What did she say?

1067
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,560
- Well,
as I understand it,

1068
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,600
there were two
conversations for that date.

1069
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,060
One between the president
and John Ehrlichman

1070
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,700
and the other between the
president and Bob Haldeman

1071
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,384
and apparently Rosemary can't find

1072
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,570
the Haldeman conversation.

1073
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:57,570
- Yeah well, what happened,
seems she accidentally

1074
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,480
erased it.

1075
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,980
- She must have pressed the
wrong button or something.

1076
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,910
She, anyway, whatever happened,

1077
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,480
she erased about four minutes,
four and a half minutes,

1078
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,000
just, you know, wiped it out.

1079
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,160
- Well, I don't think that
should be a real problem.

1080
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,820
As I recall, the subpoena
didn't even mention

1081
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,130
a Haldeman tape.

1082
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,440
- Yeah well that's what I thought too.

1083
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:27,190
- But I'll check
it out just in case.

1084
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,649
- Alright Bob, come on in.

1085
00:58:48,649 --> 00:58:50,189
How are you today?
- Fine,

1086
00:58:50,189 --> 00:58:52,097
thank you Mr. President.
- Okay.

1087
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:57,097
What do you know about,
you know, Congress?

1088
00:58:57,259 --> 00:59:01,802
- Um, well...

1089
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,100
- I'm afraid you've been misinformed, sir,

1090
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,710
about the length of that erasure.

1091
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:27,500
It's substantially more than
four and a half minutes.

1092
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,150
- How much more?

1093
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,160
- 18 minutes at least.

1094
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,260
- 18, are you sure about that?

1095
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:34,710
- I've checked and rechecked.

1096
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,800
And there's something else.

1097
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,810
I had another look at the subpoena.

1098
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:42,270
It seems to me that
the erased conversation

1099
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,020
is part of the subpoenaed material.

1100
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,670
- Damnit, Fred, how could
we be confused about this?

1101
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:48,503
- I don't know.

1102
01:00:48,503 --> 01:00:50,500
- Just a minute, let's get this straight.

1103
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,710
You're saying the stuff
that's been erased is part of,

1104
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:56,180
you mean it's subpoenaed material.

1105
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,150
All of it, the whole conversation?

1106
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,250
- I think so, yes sir.

1107
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,880
- Do you have any idea
what's on that tape?

1108
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,510
- No sir, I do not.

1109
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,360
Can you remember?

1110
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,630
- Must be a simple
explanation for this, Al.

1111
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,410
Maybe some technical
fault with the equipment.

1112
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:18,861
18 minutes is a hell of a long time.

1113
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:22,470
Must be either a technical
fault or an accident.

1114
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,670
- There's another thing.

1115
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,040
There are two separate erasures.

1116
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,190
- What do you mean?

1117
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,440
- There's a buzz indicating
the first four and a half

1118
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,273
minute erasure.

1119
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,930
Then there's a pitch
change indicating a second,

1120
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,320
separate erasure.

1121
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,160
- Perhaps the conversation
can be recovered

1122
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,960
electronically, something like that.

1123
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,230
- No, I doubt it.

1124
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,470
Frankly sir this could be very serious.

1125
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,730
- What the hell do you
expect me to do about it?

1126
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:00,520
- First thing we need
is some expert advice,

1127
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,990
someone who really knows tape recorders.

1128
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,540
We'll get on that straight away.

1129
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,373
- Yeah, right.

1130
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,060
- Maybe we could talk to Bob Haldeman.

1131
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:12,390
He might have made notes
during that conversation.

1132
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,930
- Okay, fine.

1133
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,090
Do that.

1134
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:17,790
- And we should tell Judge Sirica

1135
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,240
and the special prosecutor.

1136
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,410
- Tell him what?

1137
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,530
- I don't think--

1138
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,680
- Better we tell them
before they find out.

1139
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,680
- Very serious matter, Mr. Buzhardt.

1140
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,230
- Yes your honor, very serious.

1141
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,160
- You say that the label on
the box containing the tape

1142
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,910
indicates that Mr. Haldeman
was talking with the president?

1143
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,540
- Yes sir.

1144
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,640
- And that there is an
obliteration of the voices

1145
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,430
for approximately 18 minutes.

1146
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,640
- Yes sir.

1147
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,560
- Furthermore it doesn't
appear from what you know

1148
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,180
at this point that that obliteration

1149
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,680
could have been accidental.

1150
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,513
- No sir.

1151
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,750
The circumstance is even
a little worse than that,

1152
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,583
your honor.

1153
01:03:17,871 --> 01:03:19,671
- I don't see how it could be worse.

1154
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,470
- We have found Mr. Haldeman's
notes of that meeting.

1155
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:28,465
They consisted of two legal pads of paper.

1156
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,010
The notes reflect that the discussion

1157
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,010
was about Watergate.

1158
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,150
- The matter will have to be made public.

1159
01:03:42,093 --> 01:03:45,610
I shall order an immediate
inquiry in open court.

1160
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,180
- For almost six months,

1161
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,330
there had been rumors of
my father's private gain

1162
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:07,220
from public office ranging
from the story that he may

1163
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,470
have used $1 million in campaign funds

1164
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,845
to buy San Clemente

1165
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:13,530
to Newsweek's contention
that Trisha may have

1166
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:15,890
improperly filed her income tax returns

1167
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,530
because of my father's manipulation

1168
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:18,630
of family property.

1169
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,236
By the end of November, my
father reached the conclusion

1170
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:25,950
that the only way to
quell these ugly rumblings

1171
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,980
was to allow the Joint
Congressional Committee

1172
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:31,010
on Internal Revenue Taxation
to review his tax returns.

1173
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,350
- I was telling Ron that
this is a little bit

1174
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,431
like walking into the lion's den.

1175
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:01,840
I have made my mistakes,
but in all my years

1176
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,020
of public life I have never
profited, never profited

1177
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,400
from public service.

1178
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,300
I have earned every cent.

1179
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,996
And in all my years of
public life I have never

1180
01:05:09,996 --> 01:05:14,996
obstructed justice and I
think too that I could say

1181
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,290
that in my years of public
life too that I have welcomed

1182
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,310
this kind of examination.

1183
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:23,870
Because the people have
got to know whether or not

1184
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:25,740
their president is a crook.

1185
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,710
Well, I am not a crook.

1186
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,410
I have earned everything I've got.

1187
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,570
- As I understand it, Miss
Woods, the president had asked

1188
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:39,100
you to transcribe some of
the tapes and you were doing

1189
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,740
that in your office at the
White House, is that correct?

1190
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,240
- Yes.

1191
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,790
- How did you operate the
tape recording machine?

1192
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,150
- By pushing either the buttons

1193
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:51,430
on the machine itself or
by operating a foot pedal.

1194
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,420
- Would you tell this
inquiry what happened

1195
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,850
when you got to the
beginning of the conversation

1196
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,010
between the president and Mr. Haldeman?

1197
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,750
- Well I was
listening to the tape

1198
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,330
when the telephone rang.

1199
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:06,850
I pushed the record button
instead of the stop button.

1200
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:10,212
I, I suppose I
must have left my foot

1201
01:06:10,212 --> 01:06:13,170
on the pedal during the
telephone conversation.

1202
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,650
- And that's what caused this erasure?

1203
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,660
- You can call it an erasure.

1204
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,840
I call it a gap.

1205
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:26,290
- Miss Woods, how longs was
this telephone conversation?

1206
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,890
- About four or five minutes.

1207
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:31,180
- The erasure lasts
longer than 18 minutes.

1208
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,110
- Yes.

1209
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,640
- How do you explain the difference?

1210
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,830
- I can't explain it.

1211
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,382
I almost panicked when I
realized what had happened

1212
01:06:42,382 --> 01:06:45,810
but I don't think I can admit
to doing anything wrong.

1213
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,610
I'm most dreadfully sorry, your honor.

1214
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,610
- I'm sorry to interrupt
your vacation, Mr. St. Clair,

1215
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:19,950
but we need to discuss a matter
of the greatest importance.

1216
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:21,730
There is a feeling that the president

1217
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:25,310
is going to need the services
of a good criminal lawyer.

1218
01:07:27,499 --> 01:07:28,649
I'll be frank with you.

1219
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:31,850
There is no doubt.

1220
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:38,130
The president has discussed
some very unseemly matters,

1221
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:42,710
but he is not, nor has he been involved

1222
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,620
in any overtly illegal acts.

1223
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,950
I truly believe that.

1224
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,900
Nevertheless, I am
advised that a man can be

1225
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:56,230
charged as a member of a conspiracy

1226
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,865
simply for taking part in discussions

1227
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:01,380
that lead to the criminal acts of others.

1228
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,430
For that reason, we need the advice

1229
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:13,150
and the experience of a
first class criminal lawyer.

1230
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,460
Things are in a shambles here.

1231
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,290
And I truly believe that
men such as yourself

1232
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:27,204
should be willing to
abandon their lucrative

1233
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:31,740
law practices for a while to
take the president's case.

1234
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:34,990
The salary is $42,000 a year.

1235
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,140
- Well...

1236
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:44,407
It's a challenge I welcome, General Haig.

1237
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:48,380
I appreciate the gravity
of the situation but

1238
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,080
I have every confidence
that I can handle it,

1239
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:53,970
and handle it well.

1240
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,580
- Because
my father's will to fight

1241
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,380
and to survive was a major factor

1242
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,420
in the unfolding Watergate drama,

1243
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,940
the press was scrutinizing his actions

1244
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:24,150
as if he were beneath a magnifying glass.

1245
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:28,500
One of the White House
press aides was asked

1246
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,941
if the president was using
drugs or seeing a psychiatrist

1247
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:34,300
and whether or not he
still believed in prayer.

1248
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,300
The drinking rumors were
the most persistent,

1249
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,230
perhaps because it seemed he was drinking

1250
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:42,000
a little more than he ever had before

1251
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,060
but at dinnertime when
he was trying to unwind.

1252
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,690
He still adhered to a self-imposed code of

1253
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,090
no alcohol on nights he
was attending receptions

1254
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:53,700
or dinners, nor did he
drink during the day.

1255
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:56,970
Other rumors about the
president's behavior

1256
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,635
and distress were rife in the press room.

1257
01:09:59,635 --> 01:10:02,450
There was even one story
that he was wearing makeup

1258
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,790
to disguise an illness.

1259
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:19,300
- As you know sir, the
House Judiciary Committee

1260
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,260
has issued a subpoena for an additional

1261
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,820
42 tape recordings.

1262
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,620
In my view, the White House should give

1263
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,340
the appearance of cooperation.

1264
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,400
- Well, in my view I think
we should tell the committee

1265
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,233
to go to hell.

1266
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,463
- Well.

1267
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,810
We can't do that, we can't
risk a charge of concealment.

1268
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,660
- There has to be some accommodation.

1269
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:43,470
- You mean a compromise.

1270
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,303
- Yes sir.

1271
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,474
- Okay.

1272
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:53,830
How about, what about
an abridged transcript?

1273
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,300
A summary of the relevant parts?

1274
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,540
- Good idea.

1275
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,540
- I disagree.

1276
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,590
Committee's already suspicious.

1277
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:03,850
Give them no more than a summary

1278
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,490
and it's just gonna make matters worse.

1279
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:06,930
- For god's sake, Fred!

1280
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,370
I give them those tapes,
they'll just want more and more!

1281
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:13,414
- Sir, that is a risk we're
just gonna have to take.

1282
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,250
- It seems to me that we should surrender

1283
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,700
enough information from the tapes

1284
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,000
to give the impression
of reasonable behavior.

1285
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,271
What do you suggest, Fred?

1286
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:27,550
- We have to take the
mystery out of those tapes.

1287
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,780
I suggest we offer a
full verbatim transcript

1288
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,880
to the relevant material
from the subpoenaed tapes.

1289
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,890
- We can't do that, Fred.
- Why not?

1290
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,120
- Those are private, candid discussions.

1291
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,530
There's rough language on those tapes.

1292
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:40,950
- Right, you're right.

1293
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,020
That stuff was never
meant for public scrutiny.

1294
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,558
- We can delete any
offensive words or language.

1295
01:11:46,391 --> 01:11:47,490
- What do you think, Al?

1296
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:51,140
- Well, now, that is
certainly a possibility.

1297
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,640
- There'll be no principle
of privilege abandoned,

1298
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:57,940
there'll be no precedent set.

1299
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,110
- Well, why don't you tell the committee

1300
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:03,028
that in spite of their
unreasonable demands,

1301
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:05,960
that I'm willing to meet
them more than halfway.

1302
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,400
- Yes sir, I think
that'd make a big impact.

1303
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,650
- Hold on, wait a minute.

1304
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:10,600
Let's think about this.

1305
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,820
It's not just the committee

1306
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,040
that we have to be concerned about.

1307
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,280
This material will be leaked.

1308
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,510
It'll be given out to the public!

1309
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,350
- He's right.

1310
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:20,996
- This is gonna cost us one
hell of a lot of damage, sir.

1311
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:22,662
- Be sensible, Ron.

1312
01:12:22,662 --> 01:12:24,760
If we defy the committee outright,

1313
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,580
it'll almost certainly end in a citation

1314
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,573
for contempt of congress and impeachment.

1315
01:12:29,573 --> 01:12:34,573
Agreed?
- Agreed.

1316
01:12:37,847 --> 01:12:41,389
- Okay, okay, go ahead.

1317
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,200
- He isn't just deleting bad language.

1318
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:05,250
He's deleting entire
conversations about Watergate,

1319
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,210
I mean look at this here, look at that.

1320
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,260
Entire conversations.

1321
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:14,672
- Don't tell me, tell the president.

1322
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,760
- The point is sir we
have got to be consistent.

1323
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,080
The only conceivable
justification for major deletions

1324
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,980
is that certain subjects are not relevant

1325
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,480
for the committee's investigation.

1326
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,313
Now these--

1327
01:14:29,313 --> 01:14:31,275
- Okay, okay Fred, you've made your point.

1328
01:14:32,108 --> 01:14:34,540
But you must try and
understand my position.

1329
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:38,390
A president of the United
States is confronted

1330
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:41,220
with allegations that his
top aides are involved

1331
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,250
in an obstruction of justice.

1332
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,083
What does he do?

1333
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,270
Explore every option,
that's all he can do.

1334
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,760
Okay.

1335
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,140
Some of these options may sound bad.

1336
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,680
But what matters, the only
thing that really matters,

1337
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,630
is the final decision.

1338
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:58,780
- Yes sir, I can appreciate that but--

1339
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,150
- The material I've been deleting

1340
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:03,670
is irrelevant to my actions.

1341
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,010
I was just thinking
aloud, you know how it is.

1342
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:07,851
- Well.

1343
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:09,860
I don't see how we're
going to explain this

1344
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,020
to the committee.
- It's simple.

1345
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,910
You just insert an appropriate phrase

1346
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,500
where I've made cuts.

1347
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,580
- What sort of appropriate phrase?

1348
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,670
- Um, materials unrelated to
presidential action deleted,

1349
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,288
how about that?

1350
01:15:23,288 --> 01:15:24,690
- Okay.

1351
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:29,150
- That's precisely and exactly
why I made those cuts, Fred.

1352
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:32,500
Don't worry about it.

1353
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,850
I take full responsibility.

1354
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:40,520
In giving you these
records, blemishes and all,

1355
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,460
I am placing my trust
in the basic fairness

1356
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,610
of the American people.

1357
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,360
I know in my own heart

1358
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,653
that through the long,
painful, and difficult process

1359
01:15:54,653 --> 01:15:56,720
revealed in these transcripts,

1360
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,330
I was trying in that period to discover

1361
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:04,370
what was right and to do what was right.

1362
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,630
- There's no way he's going
to change his mind, sir.

1363
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:19,380
The new special prosecutor's
made that very clear.

1364
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,040
Edited transcripts are
totally unacceptable.

1365
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,070
He wants the tapes.

1366
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,570
- To hell with that.

1367
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,740
I've said this to you, Fred,
and I'll say it to all of you.

1368
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,750
I'll fight the case for those tapes

1369
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,550
all the way up to the Supreme Court.

1370
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,319
- There...

1371
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,850
There is something else
that you should know, sir.

1372
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,683
- What's that?

1373
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:46,980
- Well, I had a visit this morning

1374
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,520
from the special prosecutor.

1375
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,520
It would seem that he's been
authorized by the grand jury

1376
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:56,320
to cite you as an
unindicted co-conspirator

1377
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,570
in the Watergate coverup.

1378
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,670
Apparently he's known about
this for some weeks now

1379
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:05,530
but out of deference
to you he and his staff

1380
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:06,460
have kept quiet about it.

1381
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,010
- So why is he telling you now?

1382
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:09,783
- Well.

1383
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:15,050
If you're willing to give
him 15, maybe 18 of the 64

1384
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:19,790
subpoenaed tapes, he will drop the suit

1385
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:24,790
for the rest of them and
not reveal at this time

1386
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,570
that the grand jury has named you

1387
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,430
as an unindicted co-conspirator.

1388
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,210
- He calls it compromise.

1389
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,860
I call it blackmail.

1390
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,140
- What'd you say to him?

1391
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,460
- I said we'd have to
talk to you about it.

1392
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,140
We need to know how many
tapes he'll settle for

1393
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:41,840
and which ones he's talking about.

1394
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:49,700
- Well I guess, um, I mean, if we agree

1395
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,440
at least it'd put a stop

1396
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,800
to this legal stuff about the tapes.

1397
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,140
- That's right.

1398
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,840
We can see the barbed wire
at the end of the street.

1399
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,970
Now we have to muster
everything to cut through it.

1400
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,460
- Okay, um...

1401
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:07,140
I'll think about it.

1402
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:10,125
- Listen to the tapes that he wants

1403
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:11,800
and then see how you feel.

1404
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:17,880
- How do you like this scotch, Jim?

1405
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,293
30 years old.

1406
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,070
- Very good.

1407
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:23,903
- The best.

1408
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:27,470
How 'bout you, Fred, another ginger ale?

1409
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,900
- No sir.
- Fred doesn't drink.

1410
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,060
I call him the Baptist.

1411
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,191
They pay you nickels and dimes,

1412
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:27,603
but this is what makes it all worth it.

1413
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,415
- Are you alright, Fred?

1414
01:20:28,088 --> 01:20:29,338
Yeah, I'm fine.

1415
01:20:30,799 --> 01:20:31,632
Fine.

1416
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:42,510
- On
June 10th, Henry Kissinger

1417
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:43,910
and I left for the Mid East.

1418
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:49,410
We landed in Cairo on June
12th in the hot afternoon sun.

1419
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,920
I began this trip recognizing
the profound importance

1420
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,390
it will have for the future

1421
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,660
as far as the Mid East is concerned

1422
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:59,600
and as far as the American
position in the world.

1423
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,440
I was suffering from phlebitis,

1424
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,230
an inflammation of a vein in my left leg.

1425
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:06,413
The doctors told me that
a blood clot might form

1426
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:07,670
and break loose

1427
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,990
into the bloodstream.

1428
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,500
That could be fatal.

1429
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,900
They urged me to return to Washington.

1430
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,880
I, of course, will not
allow them to do anything

1431
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,460
that will disrupt the trip at this point.

1432
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,350
My phlebitis attack must
be kept absolutely secret.

1433
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:26,190
The irony of it all is
that as I told Ziegler,

1434
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:28,670
the press or at least most of the press

1435
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:30,900
will be more obsessed
with what happens with the

1436
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,220
minuscule problems involved in Watergate

1437
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,160
then they are with the momentous stakes

1438
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,008
that are involved in what
I will be doing and saying

1439
01:21:39,008 --> 01:21:40,140
in the Mid East.

1440
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:42,813
- And so the president's travels continue.

1441
01:21:43,646 --> 01:21:46,210
From Egypt he flew to
Saudi Arabia, to Syria,

1442
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:47,340
and then to Israel.

1443
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,490
His last stop was in
Jordan where he had talks

1444
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:50,460
with King Hussein.

1445
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:55,580
- And we in the Arab world are grateful

1446
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,820
that you have made it.

1447
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:59,680
Although you know better than anyone else

1448
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,476
that the journey for peace

1449
01:22:02,309 --> 01:22:04,081
seems to have no ending.

1450
01:22:04,081 --> 01:22:06,801
Your coming to us at this time

1451
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:08,632
has been perfectly timed

1452
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:12,469
to preserve the momentum
that the American initiative

1453
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:17,469
had begun under your inspired
and inspiring leadership.

1454
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:57,700
- Are you okay sir?

1455
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,049
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1456
01:22:59,049 --> 01:23:00,930
Any word on Fred Buzhardt?

1457
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:02,800
- He's out of danger and
making good progress now.

1458
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,560
- Good well send around some flowers,

1459
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,240
a basket of fruit, something like that.

1460
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,073
- Yes sir.

1461
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:09,123
Yes sir.

1462
01:23:09,123 --> 01:23:10,905
- Mr. President,.

1463
01:23:10,905 --> 01:23:12,280
- Looks to me like the president

1464
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,270
should be in the hospital
with that leg, Steve.

1465
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:16,750
Phlebitis is a killer.

1466
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,370
- The doctors are taking good care of him.

1467
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:20,970
- It's crazy him coming to
Moscow in that condition.

1468
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,039
Why wasn't the trip called off?

1469
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:26,580
- President's anxious to
use his personal friendship

1470
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,980
with Brezhnev to advance
the peace process.

1471
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:29,890
- Good PR too.

1472
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:32,480
Keeps Watergate off the front page.

1473
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:49,960
- I
felt more warmly toward

1474
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,710
my doomed chief than at any previous time.

1475
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,950
Whatever happened and
whoever else deserved it,

1476
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:59,349
I had determined to stick by the president

1477
01:23:59,349 --> 01:24:02,918
who had appointed me to
high office to vindicate

1478
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,900
the continuity of government.

1479
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,460
But in the recesses of
my soul I began to feel

1480
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,030
what I am told is sometimes

1481
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:14,820
the attitude of survivors
toward the terminally ill.

1482
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,810
I hoped that since the end was unavoidable

1483
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:21,605
it would for the sake
of our country be quick

1484
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:23,700
and that if it had to happen

1485
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:27,060
it would for the sake of
the president be merciful.

1486
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:39,040
- Well I got pretty bored lying in bed.

1487
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,300
Reading seemed a good idea.

1488
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:45,260
So I read the briefs Jim St. Clair

1489
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,455
submitted to the Supreme Court.

1490
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:49,700
Frankly I'm appalled.

1491
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,533
- Appalled?

1492
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,060
- His job is to convince the Supreme Court

1493
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,160
that the president is legally entitled

1494
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,320
to withhold the subpoenaed tapes.

1495
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,410
Right?

1496
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:00,243
I mean that's his function,

1497
01:25:00,243 --> 01:25:01,780
that's why he was hired, yes?

1498
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,580
Well, he's done a sloppy job, Al.

1499
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,370
His arguments lack any
articulate reasoning--

1500
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:11,203
- Fred--
- There's no

1501
01:25:11,203 --> 01:25:12,590
intellectual muscle, there's no sense of--

1502
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:14,863
- Fred, Fred, you worry too much.

1503
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,870
He knows what he's doing.

1504
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,340
It all went very well.
- What did?

1505
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,980
- The Supreme Court thing.

1506
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,760
Everything's okay, Jim is
very confident about it.

1507
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,720
- Means nothing.

1508
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,920
- In your opinion.

1509
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,860
- I've been told the
Supreme Court is gonna

1510
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:29,330
order the president to hand over all 64

1511
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:31,480
of the subpoenaed tapes to Judge Sirica.

1512
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,720
All of them Al, every one.

1513
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,082
- That's just hearsay.

1514
01:25:34,082 --> 01:25:36,360
- Reliable hearsay.

1515
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:39,390
- What are you trying to say, Fred?

1516
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,223
- Nothing.

1517
01:25:40,223 --> 01:25:42,190
Just imparting information.

1518
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,760
- Information or rumor?

1519
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,020
- Little of both.

1520
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:46,980
- Okay, what else?

1521
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:50,130
- Well the House Judiciary Committee

1522
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:53,120
is about to publish its
evidence on Watergate.

1523
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,170
- I know that.

1524
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:56,570
- I'm told it comes
to almost 4,000 pages.

1525
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:58,870
- Have you any idea what
the evidence will be?

1526
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,250
- Well I can hazard a reasonable guess.

1527
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,760
We know for a fact that
they've done their own

1528
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,390
transcriptions of some
of the president's tapes.

1529
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,070
We also know for a fact
that there are substantial

1530
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:14,220
differences between
their version and ours.

1531
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,450
Awesome differences.

1532
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,710
- Well Fred there are bound
to be some differences,

1533
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:20,710
that's inevitable.

1534
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,810
After all, the president
made his own edits,

1535
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,170
secondly, they have top quality equipment,

1536
01:26:25,170 --> 01:26:26,250
they can hear things we couldn't.

1537
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,430
- Al, Al, don't delude yourself.

1538
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:31,580
They're not interested
in logical explanations.

1539
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,880
They're out for his blood.

1540
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:36,640
- So you think the committee
will vote to impeach.

1541
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,473
- Don't you?

1542
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:40,480
The evidence is gonna
be extremely damaging,

1543
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,380
we both know that.

1544
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,073
- Well.

1545
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,700
At least there's no bombshell.

1546
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:48,180
- Meaning what?

1547
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:49,200
- Well no matter what they say,

1548
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,250
no smoking pistol has been
found in the president's hand.

1549
01:26:57,030 --> 01:26:57,863
- Not yet.

1550
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,750
- Sit down, Fred.

1551
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:15,600
- Thank you, sir.

1552
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:21,700
- How are you, feeling better?
- Yes I am sir, thank you.

1553
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:22,980
- Well.

1554
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,450
It's good to have you back.

1555
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:25,283
- Thank you.

1556
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:28,663
- Must have been a worrying
time for your wife.

1557
01:27:28,663 --> 01:27:30,590
- Yes, yes sir it was.

1558
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:34,670
- Well, give her my best, will you?

1559
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,420
- I will, Mr. President, thank you.

1560
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:41,040
- The Supreme Court
decision was a bad blow.

1561
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:44,750
I had counted on at least
one dissenting voice but

1562
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:46,590
that wasn't to be.

1563
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,190
It's not only we who lost, Fred.

1564
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,857
The presidency has lost,
United States has lost.

1565
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:00,080
To tell you the truth, I was stunned.

1566
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:03,330
- Yes sir, I can believe that.

1567
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,220
- Anyway.

1568
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:10,010
We need to assess the tapes
that have to be turned over.

1569
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:15,395
June 23rd might give us a problem.

1570
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,000
- Get right on
it and get back to Al Haig.

1571
01:28:49,472 --> 01:28:51,190
- Now on the investigation.

1572
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:53,510
You know, the Democratic break in thing?

1573
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:57,560
We're back to the in
the problem area because

1574
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:00,770
the FBI is not under
control and they have,

1575
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,610
their investigation is now leading

1576
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,780
into some productive areas
because they've been able

1577
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,010
to trace the money not
through the money itself

1578
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,890
but through the bank.

1579
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:12,710
You know, sources, a banker himself.

1580
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:16,650
And it goes in some directions
we don't want it to go.

1581
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:21,470
The way to handle this now
is for us to have the CIA

1582
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:25,280
call the FBI and just say
stay the hell out of this.

1583
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,250
This is business here, we don't want you

1584
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,080
to go any further on it.

1585
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,930
That's not an unusual development.

1586
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,510
- And that would take care of it.

1587
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,130
- Yes Fred, what's the matter?

1588
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:06,930
- I found the smoking pistol.

1589
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,970
- Are you sure?

1590
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,100
- Yeah.

1591
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,000
It's the ballgame.

1592
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,060
Haldeman told him a lot that day.

1593
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,110
- Fred is completely off-base.

1594
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,540
There is nothing new on that tape.

1595
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,600
Everything has been disclosed
in previous statements.

1596
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,980
- Yes but--
- I know what I mean,

1597
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:25,813
General Haig!

1598
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,140
I was telling Haldeman
to make sure that the FBI

1599
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,790
did not jeopardize CIA secrets left over

1600
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,950
from the Bay of Pigs operation.

1601
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:35,950
That's what I meant.

1602
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,180
- Fred is making his own judgments

1603
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:41,600
based on what he heard on that tape

1604
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,060
and other people are
probably gonna do the same.

1605
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:49,230
- Fred is tired, Fred is
ill, Fred is the sort of man

1606
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:51,230
who panics too damn easily.

1607
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:53,720
I mean look how he panicked last November,

1608
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,620
coming down to Florida with Len Garment

1609
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:56,770
to say I should resign.

1610
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,430
Now that was not a considered judgment,

1611
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:00,340
that was a panic.

1612
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:02,883
Don't you agree?

1613
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:06,450
- Fred's opinion is not
the issue here, sir.

1614
01:31:06,450 --> 01:31:07,790
The really important matter

1615
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:09,880
is the Supreme Court decision.

1616
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:11,440
I must advise full compliance.

1617
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,750
Judge Sirica must have those tapes.

1618
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,600
- And you're being too hasty.

1619
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,360
You're not considering
the full implications.

1620
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:23,030
I mean, isn't it possible,
just think about it,

1621
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:26,550
maybe I have a constitutional duty

1622
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:29,180
to reject that court order

1623
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:30,760
- I wouldn't advise--
- A duty to defy

1624
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,090
that court order!

1625
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:34,490
And thus preserve the
power of this office!

1626
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:36,590
- That would lead directly to impeachment.

1627
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:38,593
- Not necessarily.

1628
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:39,740
- I think it would.

1629
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:45,970
- Okay, okay.

1630
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,560
So.

1631
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,393
So what are you saying?

1632
01:31:48,393 --> 01:31:50,820
You're saying I should just give in?

1633
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:55,350
Just comply with the court
order, turn over the tapes?

1634
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:58,730
- That's my opinion, yes.
- That's it?

1635
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,010
- Al?

1636
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:05,000
- I don't think you have
any other choice, sir.

1637
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:09,403
- Well.

1638
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,510
In that case I'll need
to listen to those tapes.

1639
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,200
I can make a start at San Clemente.

1640
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:21,170
- You mean listen to all of them?

1641
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:22,670
- Right.

1642
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:25,030
All of them.

1643
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:29,230
I'm not giving Sirica those tapes

1644
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:33,100
without listening to them

1645
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,540
and reviewing them myself.

1646
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,440
- That's gonna take a hell of a long time.

1647
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,650
- A few weeks.

1648
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:41,620
- I can't delay that long,

1649
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:44,120
there's no way the court
will agree to that.

1650
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:45,420
- What do you mean no way?

1651
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,080
You find a way!

1652
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,730
That's what I want and it's your job

1653
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:52,020
to make sure I get it.

1654
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:54,103
Okay?

1655
01:33:14,942 --> 01:33:16,249
- Now on the investigation,

1656
01:33:16,249 --> 01:33:18,990
you know, the Democratic break-in thing?

1657
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:22,510
We're back to the, in the problem area

1658
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:25,680
because the FBI is not under control

1659
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,070
and they have, their
investigation is now leading

1660
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,170
into some productive areas
because they've been able

1661
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:33,490
to trace the money not
through the money itself

1662
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:36,370
but through the bank, you know, sources?

1663
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:38,689
A banker himself.

1664
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:42,903
And it goes in some directions
we don't want it to go.

1665
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:58,080
The Democratic break-in thing?

1666
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,610
We're back to the, in the problem area

1667
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:03,955
because the FBI is not under control

1668
01:34:03,955 --> 01:34:08,180
and they have, their
investigation is now leading

1669
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:09,600
into some productive areas

1670
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,290
because they've been
able to trace the money

1671
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:14,470
not through the money
itself but through the bank.

1672
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:15,490
You know, sources?

1673
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,469
A banker himself.

1674
01:34:17,469 --> 01:34:21,466
And, and it goes in some
directions we don't want it to go.

1675
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:36,610
- I have reviewed the
decision of the Supreme Court

1676
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:38,220
with the president.

1677
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:40,490
He has given me this
statement which he has

1678
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:41,690
asked me to read to you.

1679
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:45,940
While I am of course
disappointed in the result,

1680
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:49,030
I respect and accept the court's decision

1681
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:51,800
and I have instructed
Mr. St. Clair to take

1682
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,970
whatever measures are necessary

1683
01:34:53,970 --> 01:34:57,460
to comply with that
decision in all respects.

1684
01:34:57,460 --> 01:35:00,400
I was gratified to note
that the court reaffirmed

1685
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,749
both the validity and the importance

1686
01:35:02,749 --> 01:35:06,210
of the principle of executive privilege.

1687
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:08,410
The principle I had sought to maintain.

1688
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,510
As we all know, the
president has always been

1689
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:15,380
a firm believer in the rule of law.

1690
01:35:16,890 --> 01:35:19,450
In accordance with his instructions,

1691
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:24,450
the time-consuming process
of reviewing the tapes

1692
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,408
will begin forthwith.

1693
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:29,670
- Thank you.
- Mr. St. Clair!

1694
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:32,600
Mr. St. Clair!

1695
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,190
- You open that
scab there's a hell of

1696
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:42,540
a lot of things that we
just feel that it would be

1697
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:45,340
very detrimental to have
this thing go any further.

1698
01:36:31,194 --> 01:36:36,194
Damn.

1699
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:50,440
When you get these people in say look,

1700
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,928
the problem is that this
will open the whole,

1701
01:36:53,928 --> 01:36:55,180
the whole Bay of Pigs thing

1702
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:58,980
and the president just feels that, um,

1703
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,580
without going into the details,

1704
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:04,310
don't, don't lie to them
to the extent to say

1705
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:06,350
there is no involvement.

1706
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:09,780
Just say this is sort
of a comedy of errors,

1707
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,087
bizarre, without getting into it.

1708
01:37:12,087 --> 01:37:15,020
The president believes
that it's going to open

1709
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,245
the whole Bay of Pigs thing up again.

1710
01:37:17,245 --> 01:37:22,245
And because these people
are playing for keeps

1711
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:26,230
and that they should call
the FBI and say that we

1712
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:27,280
wish for the country,

1713
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:31,797
don't go any further
into this case, period.

1714
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:42,250
The whole Bay of Pigs thing,
and the president just feels

1715
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:46,880
that, um, without going into the details,

1716
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,620
don't, don't lie to them
to the extent to say

1717
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,212
there is no involvement.

1718
01:37:54,273 --> 01:37:56,710
Don't, don't lie to them

1719
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,562
to the extent to say
there is no involvement.

1720
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:13,420
Don't, don't lie to them
to the extent to say

1721
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:14,620
there is no involvement.

1722
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,705
Just say this is sort of a
comedy of errors, bizarre, with--

1723
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:38,860
Okay, and just postpone the hearings.

1724
01:38:40,727 --> 01:38:43,050
With all that garbage.

1725
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,920
Just say that I have to
look at the primaries.

1726
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:50,280
Very bad to have this fellow Hunt.

1727
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,380
He knows too damn much
and he was involved,

1728
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,530
we happen to know that.

1729
01:38:55,218 --> 01:38:57,770
And then it gets out and the whole

1730
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:01,600
place is all involved in that Cuban thing.

1731
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,560
Then it's a fiasco and
it's gonna make the FBI,

1732
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,230
CIA look bad.

1733
01:39:07,102 --> 01:39:09,550
It's gonna make Hunt look bad.

1734
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:13,340
It's likely to blow the whole
Bay of Pigs thing

1735
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:18,060
which we think would be very
unfortunate for the CIA.

1736
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,870
And for the country at this time.

1737
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:22,940
And for American foreign policy.

1738
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:26,110
And he just better tough
it out and lay it on 'em.

1739
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:28,910
Isn't that what you...
- Yeah, that's the basis

1740
01:39:29,793 --> 01:39:32,080
for the.
- I don't want them

1741
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,340
to get any ideas we're
doing it because our concern

1742
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,173
is political.

1743
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,000
And at the same time I wouldn't tell them

1744
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,550
it's not political.
- Right.

1745
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,200
- You call them in.

1746
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,190
Good, good deal.

1747
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:47,100
Play it tough, that's the way they play it

1748
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,400
and that's the way we're gonna play it.

1749
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,310
- Okay, good?

1750
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:52,160
- Yeah when I
saw that new summary item

1751
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:55,450
I of course knew it was a
bunch of crap but I thought

1752
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,950
well it's good to have them off on this

1753
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:01,478
wild hare thing 'cause
when they start bugging us

1754
01:40:01,478 --> 01:40:04,590
which they have, we'll know our new boys

1755
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:06,140
will not know how to handle it.

1756
01:40:08,830 --> 01:40:11,640
When you get these people in say look,

1757
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:15,076
the problem is that this
will open the whole,

1758
01:40:15,076 --> 01:40:16,926
the whole Bay of Pigs thing,

1759
01:40:16,926 --> 01:40:20,200
and the president just feels that, um,

1760
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:22,450
without going into the details.

1761
01:40:22,450 --> 01:40:24,530
Don't, don't lie to them to the extent--

1762
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:25,499
- I, Richard Millhouse Nixon--
- To say

1763
01:40:25,499 --> 01:40:26,332
there was no involvement.

1764
01:40:26,332 --> 01:40:27,732
Do solemnly swear--
- That you will faithfully

1765
01:40:27,732 --> 01:40:30,890
execute the office--
- Comedy of errors, bizarre.

1766
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:32,810
That I will faithfully execute the office.

1767
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:34,070
- Of the president of the United States--

1768
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,450
- The president believes
that it's going to open

1769
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:36,340
the whole Bay of Pigs thing up again.

1770
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,289
Of the president of the United States.

1771
01:40:38,289 --> 01:40:40,330
- And you will to the
best of your ability--

1772
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:41,490
- Because these people
are playing for keeps.

1773
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,120
And I will to the best of my ability.

1774
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,350
And that I should--
- Preserve, protect,

1775
01:40:44,350 --> 01:40:45,852
and defend--

1776
01:40:45,852 --> 01:40:46,685
- Call the FBI and say that we...

1777
01:40:46,685 --> 01:40:47,518
Preserve, protect, and defend.

1778
01:40:47,518 --> 01:40:49,490
Wish for the country.
- The constitution

1779
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:51,050
of the United States.
- Don't go any further.

1780
01:40:51,050 --> 01:40:53,240
The constitution of the United States.

1781
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,370
- So help you God.
- So help me God.

1782
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:57,760
- Good swim, sir?
- Great, thank you.

1783
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,500
That's okay, I'll get it.

1784
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:07,883
Yeah.

1785
01:42:07,883 --> 01:42:09,880
- Sir, is that you?
- Hi.

1786
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,430
- The Judiciary Committee
has voted for impeachment,

1787
01:42:12,430 --> 01:42:13,610
27 to 11.

1788
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:17,470
They say the president
engaged in a course of conduct

1789
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:19,230
designed to obstruct the investigation

1790
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:20,330
of the Watergate case.

1791
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:40,470
John Ehrlichman's going to prison.

1792
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:42,740
20 months to five years.

1793
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:48,870
I've been talking to the lawyers.

1794
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:52,480
And I've been talking to Al Haig

1795
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,280
and he thinks the lawyers are right.

1796
01:42:56,505 --> 01:42:57,910
The point is sir if,

1797
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:00,650
what they're saying is

1798
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,424
if you don't resign you're going to face

1799
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,900
conviction in the Senate.

1800
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,690
And I know this sounds
disloyal but it's not.

1801
01:43:14,690 --> 01:43:15,740
Believe me, it's not.

1802
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:21,850
But the circumstances are
surrounding us, Mr. President.

1803
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:31,240
We can't ignore it.

1804
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:35,460
The lawyers are acting
in your best interest.

1805
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,473
- Out!

1806
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:42,703
Get out!

1807
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:06,510
- I want to alert you, Gerry,

1808
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:09,050
that things are deteriorating.

1809
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,640
Like the whole ballgame may be over.

1810
01:44:14,695 --> 01:44:17,395
You should start thinking
about a change in your life.

1811
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,523
- What happened?

1812
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,480
- We've been listening to
one of the president's tapes.

1813
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,640
It's catastrophic.

1814
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:33,020
The impact will be
immediate and devastating.

1815
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:40,840
Are you ready, Mr. Vice President,

1816
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:45,330
to assume the presidency
in a very short time?

1817
01:44:48,819 --> 01:44:51,580
- Al, if it happens, I'm prepared.

1818
01:44:52,961 --> 01:44:54,020
- Well I can't tell you
what's going to happen

1819
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,270
in the next 48 hours.

1820
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,730
I don't know what the
president's gonna do.

1821
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:01,580
- Do you think he's going to resign?

1822
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:04,180
- I can't be sure.

1823
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,700
That's our recommendation.

1824
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:11,760
You understand this is
very complicated matter.

1825
01:45:15,258 --> 01:45:17,210
- Al, I don't know what to say.

1826
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,450
I need to think.

1827
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:23,790
- I know, I know.

1828
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:27,880
But there are some things
that have to be dealt with

1829
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:28,713
right now.

1830
01:45:29,770 --> 01:45:30,670
This, for example.

1831
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:35,440
I've been talking to
some knowledgeable people

1832
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:38,740
on the White House staff about

1833
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,990
the question of a pardon.

1834
01:45:41,533 --> 01:45:43,590
Whether the president
should pardon himself,

1835
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:46,186
whether some other people
should be pardoned,

1836
01:45:46,186 --> 01:45:50,120
or if the president should
be pardoned if he resigns.

1837
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:52,440
Those are the options open to us.

1838
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:56,743
- Well.

1839
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:00,030
What kind of power does
the president have?

1840
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:04,530
Can he grant pardons to whom he chooses?

1841
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,447
- Our lawyer tells me
that the president has

1842
01:46:07,447 --> 01:46:10,470
the power to grant a pardon.

1843
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:12,640
It's an unrestricted power

1844
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:15,100
so it can be exercised
before charges are brought.

1845
01:46:18,922 --> 01:46:21,560
- I need to talk to Jim St. Clair.

1846
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,960
I want his legal assessment
of Nixon's problems.

1847
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:28,910
And I'll need to talk to my wife.

1848
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,060
She deserves to be brought up to date.

1849
01:46:33,930 --> 01:46:35,810
- Well, we have to stay in contact.

1850
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,100
Don't hesitate to call me,

1851
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,790
I won't hesitate to call you.

1852
01:46:39,790 --> 01:46:42,210
Things could break so fast that we've

1853
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,183
got to be accessible to each other.

1854
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:49,080
- Right.

1855
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:49,980
I'll be available.

1856
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:52,620
I'll keep my cool.

1857
01:47:08,490 --> 01:47:09,930
- A
few days after his return

1858
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:12,642
from San Clemente, my
father asked us to join him

1859
01:47:12,642 --> 01:47:17,642
in the Lincoln sitting room.

1860
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:19,860
Mother sat with her back to the windows

1861
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:22,480
next to my father who was
sunk in his brown chair.

1862
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,190
David and I were together on
the only sofa in the room.

1863
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:29,760
My father said that he
had asked General Haig

1864
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,900
to send over four transcripts
of the June 23rd tape.

1865
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:37,170
Soon Manolo arrived with the copies.

1866
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:59,920
David and I took one
and went down the hall

1867
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,390
so that we could be alone to read it.

1868
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,281
Trisha and Ed who had
arrived from New York

1869
01:48:04,281 --> 01:48:06,830
went in the opposite
direction with their copy.

1870
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:20,230
- I don't think your father
can take much more of this.

1871
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:21,930
- He's strong, Ed, he's a fighter.

1872
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:28,530
- I saw him the other night.

1873
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:33,540
He was talking to these pictures.

1874
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,233
- What?

1875
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:42,320
- He was walking up and down
right here, giving speeches

1876
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:44,920
and talking to the pictures on the walls.

1877
01:48:52,687 --> 01:48:54,354
- He mustn't resign.

1878
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:56,253
He mustn't.

1879
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,945
- When we
came back, we gave our opinions.

1880
01:49:19,945 --> 01:49:21,495
- I don't think you can resign.

1881
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:23,510
You're not the only person that--

1882
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:25,500
- Trisha
and I were adamantly opposed

1883
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,880
to his resigning and Ed was also opposed.

1884
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:29,649
- You can't let a
bunch of political enemies--

1885
01:49:29,649 --> 01:49:31,820
- David's
response was to encourage

1886
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:33,530
my father to do what he thought was best.

1887
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:35,400
- More importantly, you're my father

1888
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:38,440
and we're behind you and
I'm trying to give you

1889
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,110
advice here on something
that I really can't

1890
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:41,572
give you advice on.

1891
01:49:41,572 --> 01:49:44,102
This is your decision.

1892
01:49:44,102 --> 01:49:46,915
- I don't think is right
but this certainly...

1893
01:49:46,915 --> 01:49:48,281
- Everything else you've done and said

1894
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:49,860
have twisted them to suit

1895
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:52,902
their character assassination...

1896
01:49:58,230 --> 01:49:59,063
- Through all this

1897
01:49:59,063 --> 01:50:00,210
Mother listened intently.

1898
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,460
I sensed in her a rock-like solidarity

1899
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:06,750
with my father and a
fierce protectiveness.

1900
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:10,070
I'm not sure she even
looked at the transcript.

1901
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:50,977
- Thank you all for coming.

1902
01:50:50,977 --> 01:50:54,430
I have the tough job of
bringing you some bad news.

1903
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:00,040
The president has been
reviewing tapes, all except one

1904
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,460
are consistent with his
previous explanations.

1905
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,650
The exception is of sufficient gravity

1906
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:10,780
that it warrants this
briefing and it's the tape

1907
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:15,310
of June 23rd, 1972, which shows that

1908
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:20,310
his previous explanations
have been incomplete

1909
01:51:20,699 --> 01:51:24,310
and erroneous about CIA involvement.

1910
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:29,040
President has asked me to
read the following statement.

1911
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,250
To the White House staff.

1912
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:38,170
This was a serious act of omission

1913
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:40,870
for which I take full responsibility

1914
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:44,440
and which I deeply regret.

1915
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:52,240
I hope you will all stay at your desks.

1916
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:54,704
If not out of loyalty to the president,

1917
01:51:54,704 --> 01:51:56,380
out of loyalty to the nation.

1918
01:51:58,001 --> 01:52:01,370
I've served with men
in combat and I can say

1919
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:06,050
that no men and women have been as brave

1920
01:52:06,050 --> 01:52:07,360
as this White House staff.

1921
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,979
Thank you.

1922
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:31,500
- You fellas and your business.

1923
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:35,710
You have a way of handling
problems like this.

1924
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,000
- My business?
- The army.

1925
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:44,080
Somebody leaves a pistol in the drawer.

1926
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,780
I don't have a pistol.

1927
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,660
- On Monday, August 5th,

1928
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:07,160
we had dinner on the Sequoia.

1929
01:53:14,668 --> 01:53:16,860
It was obvious that my
father did not want to talk

1930
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:19,340
about the telephone
report he was waiting for.

1931
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,840
A report that would
tell him whether or not

1932
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,720
he still had congressional support

1933
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,270
in the wake of the release
of the June 23rd tape.

1934
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,400
After dinner, my father went below

1935
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,350
and lay down in one of the state rooms.

1936
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,290
Rose called Al Haig to get
the congressional reaction.

1937
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,900
Then she went below to report.

1938
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,290
Who is it?

1939
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:48,580
- It's Rose, sir.

1940
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:51,290
- Come on in.

1941
01:53:54,429 --> 01:53:55,262
Well?

1942
01:53:56,270 --> 01:53:57,550
- General Haig says it's coming

1943
01:53:57,550 --> 01:53:58,930
about the way we expected.

1944
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:04,093
- Well Rose.

1945
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:07,150
There goes the presidency.

1946
01:54:23,767 --> 01:54:26,340
- And I called
the president's doctor.

1947
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:30,024
Told him not to give him
any pills, tranquilizers,

1948
01:54:30,024 --> 01:54:31,130
sleeping pills.

1949
01:54:32,958 --> 01:54:35,810
We need his mind sharp and clear.

1950
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:36,643
Couldn't afford it--

1951
01:54:36,643 --> 01:54:38,470
- He won't try to kill himself.

1952
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:40,120
- That wasn't what I had in mind.

1953
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:46,860
Well, obviously that crossed my mind.

1954
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:50,050
We wouldn't want Watergate to end

1955
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:51,500
in a presidential suicide.

1956
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:58,140
- No, deep down the president
is a very religious man.

1957
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:01,671
Religious men don't kill themselves.

1958
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:03,760
- Maybe not.

1959
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:06,450
Wish I knew him better.

1960
01:55:09,980 --> 01:55:12,240
Wonder what he thinks
about when he's all alone.

1961
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,260
- He gave me some tapes
once, some Dictabelts.

1962
01:55:19,710 --> 01:55:21,140
Never asked me what I thought of them,

1963
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:23,220
never made any comment at all.

1964
01:55:26,829 --> 01:55:29,129
It was like listening
to a private confession.

1965
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:31,680
Nothing to do with Watergate.

1966
01:55:32,770 --> 01:55:37,279
Just his fears and obsessions.

1967
01:55:39,716 --> 01:55:42,757
A catalog of his inadequacies as a man.

1968
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,360
Those tapes were never meant

1969
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,510
for anyone else's ears.

1970
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:51,840
He wouldn't even let Rose transcribe them.

1971
01:55:55,110 --> 01:55:57,890
I never realized what an introvert he is.

1972
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:00,090
How isolated.

1973
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:04,658
Tell you the truth I was embarrassed

1974
01:56:04,658 --> 01:56:06,800
by the insights those tapes gave me.

1975
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,160
I can imagine him,
sitting there all alone,

1976
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:19,600
pouring those dark thoughts
into a tape recorder.

1977
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,983
He's strange.

1978
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:35,130
- Dear Daddy.

1979
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:37,743
I love you.

1980
01:56:42,164 --> 01:56:44,340
Whatever you do, I will support.

1981
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:46,720
I am very proud of you.

1982
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:50,960
Please wait a week or even 10 days

1983
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,580
before you make this decision.

1984
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:55,620
Go through the fire a little longer.

1985
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,320
You are so strong.

1986
01:56:59,860 --> 01:57:01,600
I love you, Julie.

1987
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:06,440
Millions support you.

1988
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:42,790
- Come in, Henry.

1989
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:53,920
Henry, I, I've decided
to resign the presidency

1990
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,330
effective noon on Friday.

1991
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:00,670
We'll need to notify
foreign governments tonight,

1992
01:58:00,670 --> 01:58:01,930
immediately.

1993
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:06,060
And I would like to send
special messages to the

1994
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,230
leaders of China, the Soviet Union,

1995
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:13,470
and the Middle Eastern countries.

1996
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,860
- I'll see to it right away.

1997
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:21,550
- They'll be asleep in Cairo and Tel Aviv.

1998
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:30,320
Eight weeks ago they lined their streets

1999
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:34,650
in the thousands, tens of
thousands, to cheer me.

2000
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:37,410
That was a great triumph, Henry.

2001
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:39,943
- It was.

2002
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:45,400
- Eight short weeks, triumph to disaster.

2003
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:50,190
Henry I'm not sure I'll be able to resign.

2004
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:54,460
Can I be the first
president to quit office?

2005
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:58,586
- Whatever you decide, you will always

2006
01:58:58,586 --> 01:59:01,940
be respected as one of
the finest statesmen

2007
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:03,340
this country has ever known.

2008
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:08,620
- You think history will

2009
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:13,070
treat me kinder than my contemporaries?

2010
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,493
- Certainly.

2011
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:17,183
Definitely.

2012
01:59:18,230 --> 01:59:20,850
When all this is over,
you will be remembered

2013
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:23,240
for the peace you have achieved.

2014
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,790
All foreign leaders regard you as a man

2015
01:59:25,790 --> 01:59:27,990
who has shown the greatest distinction

2016
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:30,420
in international diplomacy.

2017
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,740
Watergate is not going to change that.

2018
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,010
Your reputation is secure.

2019
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:39,030
- Yes but...

2020
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,290
What have I done?

2021
01:59:49,641 --> 01:59:53,490
What have I done to this
country and its people?

2022
01:59:57,884 --> 01:59:59,920
Everything is so confused, I...

2023
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:05,880
I don't understand

2024
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:09,010
how all of this happened.

2025
02:00:11,856 --> 02:00:15,990
How can a simple burglary
lead to all of this?

2026
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:21,590
- I know you are not a
courageous man by nature,

2027
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:25,140
but throughout your
political career you have

2028
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:30,840
shown remarkable courage, you
have made tough decisions,

2029
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:32,240
and you have never faltered.

2030
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:36,680
Don't lose that courage now, sir.

2031
02:00:41,420 --> 02:00:42,253
- Henry.

2032
02:00:44,707 --> 02:00:47,040
I know you're not a very orthodox Jew.

2033
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,770
And I am not an orthodox Quaker.

2034
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,440
But we need to pray.

2035
02:01:04,850 --> 02:01:05,683
God.

2036
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,500
Grant us...

2037
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:37,510
What have I done?

2038
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:44,200
- Nixon
had set himself a goal

2039
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:49,200
beyond human capacity, to
make himself over entirely,

2040
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:53,350
to create a new personality
as if alone among

2041
02:01:53,350 --> 02:01:56,610
all of mankind he could
overcome his destiny.

2042
02:01:57,690 --> 02:02:02,250
But the gods exacted a fearful
price for this presumption

2043
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:05,950
and ultimately he learned
what the Greeks had known,

2044
02:02:05,950 --> 02:02:09,200
that the worst punishment
can be having one's wishes

2045
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:11,080
fulfilled too completely.

2046
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:46,830
- You are a great patriot, Mr. President,

2047
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:49,280
and a great peacemaker.

2048
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:53,890
You've never lost sight of
the ideals you believe in.

2049
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:57,930
You will go down in history

2050
02:02:57,930 --> 02:03:01,630
as one of the great
peacemakers of all time.

2051
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:11,810
- Maybe, there'll be a
role for me in government.

2052
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:15,950
What do you think?

2053
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:21,920
Advisor, perhaps?

2054
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,960
Special ambassador?
- Well yes.

2055
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:31,813
Who knows, yes.

2056
02:03:33,209 --> 02:03:34,359
I'm sure it's possible.

2057
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:38,363
- Henry.

2058
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:46,020
You know you must stay here
and carry on with Gerry

2059
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,970
the things that you and I have started.

2060
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:53,880
The whole world will need reassurance

2061
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:56,130
that my leaving will
not change our policies.

2062
02:03:57,583 --> 02:03:59,890
They don't know anything about Gerry Ford.

2063
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:02,810
You must tell them how strongly

2064
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,680
he has supported my foreign policy.

2065
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:08,067
- Very well, sir.

2066
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:22,593
- Henry.

2067
02:04:26,650 --> 02:04:28,800
Please don't ever tell
anyone that I cried.

2068
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:31,450
Or that I wasn't strong.

2069
02:04:51,610 --> 02:04:53,410
- Your father has decided to resign.

2070
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:56,393
- Okay.

2071
02:04:58,124 --> 02:04:58,957
We're going back to California.

2072
02:05:00,490 --> 02:05:02,504
- We're all very proud of you, Daddy.

2073
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:12,660
No man who ever lived had
a more wonderful family

2074
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,550
than I have.

2075
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:19,810
Well this cuts it all fit.

2076
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:22,260
We'll go out to California,
they'll leave us alone.

2077
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:23,930
- No they won't, sir.

2078
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:25,370
I know these people.

2079
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:27,460
I worked in the US Attorney's
office in New York.

2080
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:29,000
Went to school with some of them.

2081
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,850
They're very smart and they're tough.

2082
02:05:31,774 --> 02:05:34,950
But most of all sir, they
hate you with a passion

2083
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:36,680
and they will hound you and harass you

2084
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:37,980
for the rest of your life.

2085
02:05:39,810 --> 02:05:43,884
- Well, let's hope I
can take it like a man.

2086
02:05:45,070 --> 02:05:45,903
Come in.

2087
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:49,480
I asked Ollie to come.

2088
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:51,890
Ollie, take a few shots.

2089
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:54,200
- Mr. Ziegler said I've got to photograph

2090
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:55,140
absolutely everything.

2091
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:57,240
- Yes, that's right, for history.

2092
02:05:59,294 --> 02:06:00,320
How do you want us, Ollie?

2093
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:02,250
Some sort of group shot or what?

2094
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:04,920
- That's up to you, sir.

2095
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:07,310
- What do you think?

2096
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:14,210
- Maybe we should all
stand up and link arms.

2097
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:15,950
- Yes, that's a good idea.

2098
02:06:17,260 --> 02:06:20,550
Rose, would you have Manolo
send some food up on a tray?

2099
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:24,870
Where should we go, Ollie?

2100
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:27,940
- Um...
- Over there by the window?

2101
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:31,860
What about over here by
the piano, what do you think?

2102
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:34,430
- Well, by the piano.

2103
02:06:34,430 --> 02:06:35,660
- That's best.

2104
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:38,190
Between the piano and the
French doors, how about that?

2105
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:39,350
- Yes sir.

2106
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:40,270
- Okay.

2107
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:43,920
Okay everybody, over here, come on.

2108
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:46,280
Come on everybody, over here.

2109
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:48,393
Julie.

2110
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:51,050
You come over on one side, David.

2111
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:54,820
Trisha and Ed to the other side.

2112
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:56,160
Pat and me in the middle.

2113
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,550
Julie you go to the left.

2114
02:06:58,630 --> 02:07:01,990
Okay let's all bunch together, link arms.

2115
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:06,503
Okay Ollie.

2116
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:09,840
- That's fine, Mr. President.

2117
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:11,310
- I can't Daddy, I can't.

2118
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:13,900
- It'll only take a few seconds.

2119
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:15,327
Get moving, Ollie.

2120
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:17,890
- I don't wanna be photographed like this.

2121
02:07:17,890 --> 02:07:20,540
- Try again, Ollie, keep
going til you get a good one.

2122
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:22,440
Come on everybody, come on, smile now.

2123
02:07:23,308 --> 02:07:24,736
Come on.

2124
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:35,760
- That's fine, sir.

2125
02:07:36,859 --> 02:07:39,030
I think we've got enough, Mr. President.

2126
02:07:40,530 --> 02:07:41,952
Thank you very much.

2127
02:07:41,952 --> 02:07:45,108
- Well thank you, Ollie.

2128
02:07:45,108 --> 02:07:50,108
- I love you, Daddy.

2129
02:08:57,650 --> 02:08:59,100
- Will I be prosecuted, Fred?

2130
02:09:00,610 --> 02:09:01,510
What do you think?

2131
02:09:02,940 --> 02:09:05,080
- Impossible to say.

2132
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,730
I'm not sure what's gonna happen.

2133
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:10,173
- Well.

2134
02:09:11,988 --> 02:09:14,030
If they wanna put me in jail, let 'em.

2135
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:22,100
Least it'd give me time
to do some thinking.

2136
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,470
And writing?

2137
02:09:30,490 --> 02:09:32,230
All the best writing done by politicians

2138
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:33,430
has been done from jail.

2139
02:09:35,430 --> 02:09:39,020
It's true, think about it, I mean, Gandhi.

2140
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:43,820
Take Gandhi, Gandhi's
an interesting example.

2141
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:47,940
I mean, if they send me to jail

2142
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:50,640
I'll be sort of a political
prisoner just like Gandhi.

2143
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,450
And like him I've been persecuted.

2144
02:09:56,530 --> 02:09:57,930
Persecuted, don't you agree?

2145
02:09:59,690 --> 02:10:00,523
- I do.

2146
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:02,630
- Persecuted, Fred.

2147
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:06,063
- If any other president
had been investigated

2148
02:10:06,063 --> 02:10:07,946
as thoroughly as you,

2149
02:10:07,946 --> 02:10:10,010
God knows what would have been uncovered.

2150
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:14,183
- That's right.

2151
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:18,910
- The press has been
especially tough on you.

2152
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:22,840
All the usual restraints
have been ignored.

2153
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:26,767
- What matters to me, Fred, is the loyalty

2154
02:10:26,767 --> 02:10:29,330
and respect and affection
of those close to me.

2155
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:31,920
The people here at the White House.

2156
02:10:33,959 --> 02:10:35,340
They come in here crying.

2157
02:10:37,390 --> 02:10:38,740
I oughta be the one crying.

2158
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,530
I don't want anyone crying.

2159
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:45,800
I'll tell you something.

2160
02:10:48,572 --> 02:10:50,422
Do you know what happened last night?

2161
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:55,070
Last night the Secretary of State

2162
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:58,210
and President of the United States

2163
02:10:58,210 --> 02:10:59,960
got down on their knees and prayed.

2164
02:11:02,867 --> 02:11:04,680
And I'll tell you something else.

2165
02:11:07,730 --> 02:11:09,740
I couldn't have done it without my family.

2166
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:13,970
God am I proud of my family.

2167
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:18,510
They wanted me to fight all the way.

2168
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:19,580
Well that's what I wanted.

2169
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,530
Well you know that.

2170
02:11:21,490 --> 02:11:22,790
I've never been a quitter.

2171
02:11:23,710 --> 02:11:24,543
I hate quitting.

2172
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:28,260
One year in high school

2173
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:32,040
I made the football team by being

2174
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:34,900
the 11th man to turn out for the squad.

2175
02:11:37,390 --> 02:11:40,310
I wasn't much good, but I didn't quit.

2176
02:11:42,788 --> 02:11:44,050
And I made the team.

2177
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:46,873
And track too.

2178
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:52,690
I remember there was a foot race

2179
02:11:54,790 --> 02:11:57,010
that I was damn sure
that I couldn't finish.

2180
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,040
But I pushed myself.

2181
02:12:00,850 --> 02:12:02,150
God did I push myself.

2182
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,650
I didn't win, but I didn't
come in last, either.

2183
02:12:10,770 --> 02:12:11,660
I didn't quit.

2184
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:19,720
- They're ready for you
in the Oval Office now,

2185
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:21,200
Mr. President.

2186
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,150
- Thank you, Steve.

2187
02:12:47,060 --> 02:12:49,800
There was something you
wanted to tell me, what was it?

2188
02:12:51,580 --> 02:12:54,250
- I received a call from John Wilson,

2189
02:12:55,540 --> 02:12:56,850
Bob Haldeman's lawyer.

2190
02:12:58,110 --> 02:12:58,943
- Yeah.

2191
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:04,600
- Regarding this thing about the pardon.

2192
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:05,610
- No pardons.

2193
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:07,552
Okay?

2194
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,150
You call him, you tell him.

2195
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:13,130
No pardons will be granted

2196
02:13:14,410 --> 02:13:15,660
and that's the end of it.

2197
02:13:17,225 --> 02:13:18,058
Okay?

2198
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:44,460
Do think I'm doing the right thing?

2199
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:45,293
- No sir.

2200
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:48,590
- You support me?

2201
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:49,423
- Yes sir.

2202
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:52,130
But you should hang in there.

2203
02:13:58,850 --> 02:13:59,683
- Well.

2204
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:06,110
I've made up my mind.

2205
02:14:11,070 --> 02:14:12,650
- Two minutes to air.

2206
02:14:12,650 --> 02:14:14,230
- South Lawn I'll use you for a beauty

2207
02:14:14,230 --> 02:14:16,260
until straight then
I'll test to camera two

2208
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,530
for a shot of the city.

2209
02:14:17,530 --> 02:14:19,140
- Desk mic's not working.

2210
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:20,500
Walk his two mics out for us

2211
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,610
and I brought a backup.

2212
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:22,720
- Fine, one of the two desks

2213
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,320
is for backup anyway.

2214
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:26,050
Is the prompter up and ready?
- Yes.

2215
02:14:26,050 --> 02:14:27,840
The corrections have been made.

2216
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,673
- Okay you're a little low

2217
02:14:28,673 --> 02:14:29,770
on the overall bit on camera two.

2218
02:14:29,770 --> 02:14:31,908
Do you need more light on the...

2219
02:14:31,908 --> 02:14:34,000
- Are those lights set properly?

2220
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:34,950
They're a bit too high,

2221
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:36,890
they're shining in my eyes a bit.

2222
02:14:36,890 --> 02:14:38,480
Sure.

2223
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:40,810
Thank you, thank you, that's fine.

2224
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:44,040
- Yeah tell him
there's a shadow still,

2225
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,873
we're seeing a shadow.

2226
02:14:44,873 --> 02:14:46,370
- One minute to air.
- Okay, looks good.

2227
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:48,603
Is he ready for us, knows to cue?

2228
02:14:48,603 --> 02:14:49,600
He'll be cued to talk

2229
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:52,000
at 40 after the hour.

2230
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:55,350
- My friend Ollie always likes

2231
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:56,950
to take a lot of pictures of me.

2232
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,545
I'm afraid he'll catch me picking my nose.

2233
02:15:04,015 --> 02:15:06,900
But he wouldn't print
that, would you Ottie?

2234
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,750
I mean Ollie.
- No sir.

2235
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:13,220
- That's enough, no more
pictures, that's enough.

2236
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:15,900
- 30 seconds to air and 110 to the pres.

2237
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,620
- Is the Secret Service in the room?

2238
02:15:17,620 --> 02:15:18,735
- Yes sir, just me sir.

2239
02:15:18,735 --> 02:15:21,290
- Al.
- Start countdown.

2240
02:15:21,290 --> 02:15:22,123
10, nine--

2241
02:15:22,123 --> 02:15:22,956
- You don't have to stay, do you?

2242
02:15:22,956 --> 02:15:24,450
- Yes sir.
- Eight, seven--

2243
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:25,946
- You're required to?
- Six, five--

2244
02:15:25,946 --> 02:15:29,010
- Yes sir.
- Four, three, two--

2245
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:30,572
- Don't worry.
- One.

2246
02:15:30,572 --> 02:15:31,838
- I was just kidding.

2247
02:15:32,830 --> 02:15:34,160
- 10 to the pres.

2248
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:39,160
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

2249
02:15:41,438 --> 02:15:44,180
three, two, one.

2250
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:45,210
- Cue the pres.

2251
02:15:45,210 --> 02:15:46,043
- Good evening.

2252
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:49,920
This is the 37th time I have spoken to you

2253
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:50,890
from this office.

2254
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:54,180
Where so many decisions have been made

2255
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:56,330
that have shaped the
history of our nation.

2256
02:15:57,980 --> 02:15:59,520
From the discussions I have had

2257
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,180
with congressional and other leaders,

2258
02:16:02,180 --> 02:16:05,338
I have concluded that because
of the Watergate matter,

2259
02:16:05,338 --> 02:16:09,000
I might not have the
support of the congress

2260
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,550
that I would consider necessary

2261
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:13,870
to back the difficult decisions

2262
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:16,460
and carry out the duties of this office

2263
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:19,060
in the way the interests
of the nation will require.

2264
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:26,740
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency

2265
02:16:26,740 --> 02:16:28,090
effective at noon tomorrow.

2266
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:33,749
Vice President Ford will
be sworn in as president

2267
02:16:33,749 --> 02:16:35,967
at that hour in this office.

2268
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:43,970
- Ladies and gentlemen,

2269
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:46,510
the President of the
United States of America

2270
02:16:46,510 --> 02:16:47,767
and Mrs. Nixon.

2271
02:16:50,670 --> 02:16:52,840
Mr. and Mrs. David Eisenhower.

2272
02:16:54,030 --> 02:16:56,157
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cox.

2273
02:17:40,635 --> 02:17:42,552
- Thank you, thank you.

2274
02:17:51,170 --> 02:17:54,590
Members of the cabinet, members
of our White House staff,

2275
02:17:55,816 --> 02:17:57,220
all of our friends here.

2276
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:01,420
You are here today to say goodbye to us

2277
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:05,940
and we don't have a good
word for it in English.

2278
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:08,270
The best is au revoir.

2279
02:18:11,510 --> 02:18:12,610
We will see you again.

2280
02:18:14,698 --> 02:18:16,990
I look around here I see so many

2281
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:21,090
people on the staff that you know I

2282
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:25,100
should have been by your
office and shaken hands.

2283
02:18:27,410 --> 02:18:29,040
And I would have loved
to have talked to you

2284
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:32,390
and found out how to run the world.

2285
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:38,320
Everybody always wants to
tell the president what to do

2286
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:40,680
and boy, he needs to be told many times.

2287
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:43,930
But I want you to know

2288
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,050
that each and every one of you I know

2289
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,960
is indispensable to this government.

2290
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:58,990
I am proud of this
cabinet, I am proud of our

2291
02:18:58,990 --> 02:18:59,890
White House staff.

2292
02:19:02,650 --> 02:19:04,780
Like I said last night, sure,

2293
02:19:06,150 --> 02:19:08,800
we have done some things
wrong in this administration

2294
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:13,040
and the top man always
takes responsibility

2295
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:14,390
and I have never ducked it.

2296
02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:20,680
But I would like to say
we can be proud of it.

2297
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:25,450
Five and a half years
and not one man or woman

2298
02:19:25,450 --> 02:19:27,660
came into this administration and left it

2299
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:31,360
with more of this world's
goods than when he came in.

2300
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:37,360
No man or no woman ever
profited at the public expense

2301
02:19:39,390 --> 02:19:42,350
or at the public till, and
that says something about you.

2302
02:19:44,140 --> 02:19:45,270
Mistakes, yes.

2303
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:47,870
But for personal gain, never.

2304
02:19:49,708 --> 02:19:51,330
You did what you believed in.

2305
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:55,190
Sometimes right, sometimes wrong.

2306
02:19:56,990 --> 02:19:59,090
And I only wish that I were a wealthy man.

2307
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,360
At the present time,
I've got to find a way

2308
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:05,660
to pay my taxes.

2309
02:20:12,730 --> 02:20:16,450
And if I were, I would
like to recompense you

2310
02:20:17,670 --> 02:20:21,410
for the sacrifices that
all of you have made

2311
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:22,560
to serve in government.

2312
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:29,450
There is one thing I'd like for you

2313
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:30,750
to tell your young people.

2314
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:34,150
You know, people come in and,

2315
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:38,620
and say, what will I tell my kids?

2316
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,980
And, they look around
and they see the mistakes

2317
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:46,813
that are made.

2318
02:20:48,890 --> 02:20:50,940
They get the impression
that everyone is here

2319
02:20:50,940 --> 02:20:53,090
for the purpose of
feathering his own nest.

2320
02:20:54,450 --> 02:20:56,490
That is why I made this earlier point,

2321
02:20:56,490 --> 02:20:58,190
not in this administration,

2322
02:20:58,190 --> 02:21:00,140
not one single man or woman.

2323
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:09,550
And I say to them,

2324
02:21:09,550 --> 02:21:11,490
there are many fine careers.

2325
02:21:13,010 --> 02:21:18,010
This country needs good
farmers, good businessmen,

2326
02:21:19,770 --> 02:21:20,603
good plumbers.

2327
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:26,710
I remember my old man.

2328
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:37,710
I think they would have called him sort of

2329
02:21:39,310 --> 02:21:40,600
a little man, common man.

2330
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,450
He didn't see himself that way, though.

2331
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:48,760
You know what he was?

2332
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:52,900
He was a streetcar motorman first.

2333
02:21:53,923 --> 02:21:55,170
Then he was a farmer.

2334
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:58,400
Then he owned a lemon ranch.

2335
02:21:59,550 --> 02:22:03,570
It was the poorest lemon
ranch in California,

2336
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:04,540
I can assure you.

2337
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:08,370
He sold it before they found oil on it.

2338
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:19,850
And then he was a grocer.

2339
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:24,720
But he was a great man
because he did his job

2340
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:28,530
and every job counts up to the hilt,

2341
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:30,830
regardless of what happened.

2342
02:22:36,918 --> 02:22:41,918
Nobody will ever write a book
probably about my mother.

2343
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:49,210
Well I guess all of you could
say this about your mother.

2344
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:52,120
My mother was a saint.

2345
02:22:57,090 --> 02:22:58,070
And I think of her

2346
02:23:01,300 --> 02:23:06,300
two boys dying of tuberculosis,
nursing four others

2347
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:09,040
in order that she could take
care of my older brother

2348
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:11,820
for three years in Arizona.

2349
02:23:14,530 --> 02:23:15,630
And watching them die.

2350
02:23:18,340 --> 02:23:20,640
And when they died it
was like one of her own.

2351
02:23:25,550 --> 02:23:26,383
Yes.

2352
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:32,320
She will have no books written about her.

2353
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:35,460
But she was a saint.

2354
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:51,270
Now however we, we look to the future.

2355
02:23:53,970 --> 02:23:56,411
As you know, I kinda like to read books.

2356
02:23:58,122 --> 02:24:00,520
I'm not educated but I do read books.

2357
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:07,200
And here is a little quote
from Theodore Roosevelt I found

2358
02:24:09,610 --> 02:24:13,753
while reading my last
night in the White House.

2359
02:24:16,430 --> 02:24:19,760
And this quote is about a young man.

2360
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:23,810
He was a young lawyer from New York

2361
02:24:23,810 --> 02:24:28,470
and he married a lovely girl and they had

2362
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:31,580
a lovely daughter and
then suddenly she died.

2363
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:39,180
And here is what he wrote,
this was in the diary.

2364
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:45,820
He said, she was
beautiful in face and form

2365
02:24:45,890 --> 02:24:48,470
and lovelier still in spirit.

2366
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:54,530
As a flower she grew and as a
fair young flower, she died.

2367
02:24:56,860 --> 02:24:58,650
And when my heart's dearest died,

2368
02:25:00,240 --> 02:25:02,720
the light went from my life forever.

2369
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:10,110
That was Theodore
Roosevelt in his twenties.

2370
02:25:12,940 --> 02:25:15,290
He thought the light had
left his life forever.

2371
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:18,883
But he went on.

2372
02:25:20,727 --> 02:25:23,200
And he not only became president,

2373
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,070
but as ex-president,
he served his country,

2374
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:31,470
always in the arena, tempetuous,
strong, sometimes wrong.

2375
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:35,250
But he was a man.

2376
02:25:38,605 --> 02:25:39,870
And as I leave,

2377
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:47,040
I think that is something that we all,

2378
02:25:49,003 --> 02:25:49,953
we should remember.

2379
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:55,990
We think that when
someone dear to us dies,

2380
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:58,180
we think that when we lose an election,

2381
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:02,173
we think that when we suffer
a defeat, all is lost.

2382
02:26:04,820 --> 02:26:09,180
We think, as TR said, the light
had left his life forever.

2383
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:10,013
Not so.

2384
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:12,940
It is only a beginning, always.

2385
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:18,500
The young must know it,
the old must know it,

2386
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:21,930
it must always sustain us.

2387
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:28,180
Because the greatness
comes not when things

2388
02:26:28,180 --> 02:26:33,180
always go good for you,
but the greatness comes

2389
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:38,240
and you are really tested
when you take some knocks,

2390
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:42,690
when disappointments
come, when sadness comes.

2391
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:49,530
Because only if you have
been in the deepest valley

2392
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:52,650
can you ever know how magnificent it is

2393
02:26:52,650 --> 02:26:54,150
to be on the highest mountain.

2394
02:26:59,470 --> 02:27:02,640
And so I say to you on
this occasion as we leave,

2395
02:27:06,180 --> 02:27:08,630
we leave proud of the
people who have stood by us

2396
02:27:09,790 --> 02:27:13,860
and worked for us and
served their government.

2397
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,450
We want you to be proud
of what you have done.

2398
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:22,460
We want you to continue
to serve in government

2399
02:27:22,460 --> 02:27:23,510
if that is your wish.

2400
02:27:24,891 --> 02:27:27,900
Always give your best,
never get discouraged,

2401
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:28,733
never be petty.

2402
02:27:32,390 --> 02:27:33,223
Always remember,

2403
02:27:35,465 --> 02:27:40,153
others may hate you, but the
ones that hate you can't win

2404
02:27:42,748 --> 02:27:44,948
unless you hate them.

2405
02:27:47,364 --> 02:27:49,543
And then you destroy yourself.
