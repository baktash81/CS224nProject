00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:36,876
<u><b><i>Rip made by ForsakeN</u></b></i>

2
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:44,072
<i>Once upon a time, a long time ago,</i>

3
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:47,593
<i>a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

4
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,351
<i>But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.</i>

5
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:54,954
<i>By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

6
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,756
<i>Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.</i>

7
00:00:57,917 --> 00:01:01,910
<i>So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

8
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,671
<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

9
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

10
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:11,025
<i>the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.</i>

11
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:02,469
Whoa, there.

12
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:05,429
I don't know about this, Lillian.

13
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:09,749
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

14
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:14,030
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

15
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:17,189
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

16
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:21,794
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

17
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:26,473
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

18
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,912
Rumpelstiltskin!

19
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:34,076
Mrs. Highness.

20
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,030
How do you do?

21
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:39,549
Down, Fifi. Get down!

22
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,875
As you can see, everything's in order.

23
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:47,586
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

24
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:51,909
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

25
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:01,710
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

26
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:05,267
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

27
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,428
It's not like she's getting any younger.

28
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:10,157
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

29
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:13,115
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

30
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,747
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

31
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,550
Jump, Fifi, jump!

32
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:31,152
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

33
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,634
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

34
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,870
Who saved her?

35
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,270
<i>No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,</i>

36
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,428
<i>whose roar was feared
throughout the land,</i>

37
00:03:55,597 --> 00:03:58,157
<i>would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.</i>

38
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:01,150
<i>True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!</i>

39
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,309
<i>The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.</i>

40
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:08,675
<i>Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!</i>

41
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:12,870
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

42
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,631
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

43
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:20,346
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

44
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:26,989
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

45
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:36,113
I wish that ogre was never born!

46
00:04:47,677 --> 00:04:49,793
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

47
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:53,554
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

48
00:04:56,517 --> 00:04:58,030
Better out than in.

49
00:04:58,717 --> 00:04:59,866
That's my line.

50
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:02,870
Did my little Fergus make a...

51
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:06,154
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

52
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:09,389
Oh, that's diabolical!

53
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:14,509
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

54
00:05:14,677 --> 00:05:16,952
change your undies
to change the world!

55
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,153
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

56
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:23,468
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

57
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,588
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

58
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:30,032
...and finally, into the castle.

59
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:36,466
Play date!

60
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,273
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

61
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:47,393
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

62
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:48,546
Happily...

63
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:50,116
- Ever...
- After.

64
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:57,745
Look! A shooting star!

65
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:01,788
So, what did you wish for?

66
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:03,948
That every day could be like this one.

67
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,516
Come here, you.

68
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:19,265
Morning, Daddy.

69
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:20,506
Morning.

70
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:23,792
Better out than in.

71
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,669
Did my little Fergus make a...

72
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:31,833
Cute. Real cute.

73
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:34,672
This lovable lug taught us

74
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:37,635
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

75
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:39,706
Play date!

76
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:44,631
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

77
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:47,630
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

78
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:48,786
- Happily...
- Ever...

79
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:49,946
After?

80
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:54,672
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

81
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,470
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

82
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,716
- Play date!
- No!

83
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:04,671
Outhouse again!

84
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:05,872
Come on.

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,752
Undies!

86
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:13,552
Outhouse!

87
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,753
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

88
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,316
- Happily...
- Ever...

89
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,671
After.

90
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:08,591
Roar.

91
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:57,230
Nice landing, baby.

92
00:08:57,397 --> 00:08:59,672
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

93
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:04,552
<i>Happy birthday, ninos!
Vamos a la fiesta!</i>

94
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,395
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

95
00:09:08,517 --> 00:09:11,031
Mr. Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

96
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:12,232
And our torches?

97
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,035
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

98
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:15,949
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

99
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:17,948
A real ogre?

100
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:31,835
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

101
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:34,989
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

102
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,435
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

103
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,827
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

104
00:09:41,997 --> 00:09:43,191
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?

105
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,427
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

106
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:47,030
He's a big, big fan.

107
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:48,266
Do the roar.

108
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:51,110
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

109
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:53,188
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

110
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,631
Why don't you go check on the cake?

111
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:58,028
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

112
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,186
Hold still.

113
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:01,234
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

114
00:10:01,397 --> 00:10:04,150
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

115
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,636
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

116
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,389
<i>Your cake. Voila!</i>

117
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:11,709
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

118
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,152
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

119
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:16,467
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

120
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,150
I'm in a great mood, actually.

121
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,070
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

122
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:22,352
As long as you're not doing anything,

123
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:23,916
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

124
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,511
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

125
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,111
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

126
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:31,268
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

127
00:10:31,437 --> 00:10:32,665
Do it.

128
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:35,834
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

129
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:37,988
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

130
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:39,385
Oh, good.

131
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:42,913
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

132
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,590
- You licked it!
- No.

133
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:47,510
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

134
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,872
Looks like you forgot the candles!

135
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:52,187
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

136
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,585
Watch the cake?

137
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,267
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

138
00:10:56,437 --> 00:10:57,472
- Ya.
- What?

139
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,831
No, don't cry.

140
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,386
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

141
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,910
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

142
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:05,272
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

143
00:11:05,437 --> 00:11:08,156
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

144
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,626
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

145
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,391
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

146
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:15,354
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

147
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,632
No, I ate them.

148
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:19,391
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

149
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:22,435
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

150
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,474
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

151
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:27,789
We need the cake!

152
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:31,307
Cake! Cake! Cake!

153
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:46,792
I love you, Daddy.

154
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,551
Everybody, I have found another cake!

155
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:52,793
Shrek? Are you OK?

156
00:12:19,397 --> 00:12:22,469
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

157
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:25,834
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

158
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:28,875
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

159
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:32,871
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

160
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:34,993
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

161
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:37,751
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

162
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:42,229
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

163
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:46,390
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

164
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,675
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

165
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,475
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

166
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:56,152
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

167
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,512
You spent half your life in a palace.

168
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,111
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

169
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:06,351
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

170
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:11,068
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

171
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:14,673
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

172
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,068
Back when the world made sense!

173
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,797
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

174
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,276
Exactly!

175
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:31,950
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

176
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:34,187
a wife who loves you,

177
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:38,236
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

178
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:44,795
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

179
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,349
That's just great.

180
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,268
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologise,

181
00:14:16,517 --> 00:14:19,634
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

182
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:23,472
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologise
for acting like one.

183
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:27,789
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

184
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,629
Please, help!

185
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,590
Please, help!

186
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,675
I'm stuck! Help!

187
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,589
Oh, please, help!

188
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:38,430
Someone, anyone! Help me!

189
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:41,953
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

190
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:44,475
Grandma? Is that you?

191
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:45,956
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

192
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:49,553
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre,
please don't eat me!

193
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:51,196
I'm not gonna eat you.

194
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,508
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

195
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:57,396
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

196
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:59,866
Look, move out or get crushed.

197
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:01,948
So you're not gonna eat me?

198
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:06,747
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

199
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,915
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

200
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,066
Nowhere.

201
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:14,797
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

202
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:19,269
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

203
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:23,635
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

204
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,590
I got a hot rat cooking.

205
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:31,992
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

206
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:34,990
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

207
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:39,275
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

208
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:43,991
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."

209
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:47,591
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

210
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:50,954
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

211
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,756
You are free to pillage
and terrorise as you please.

212
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:57,068
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

213
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:02,586
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

214
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:03,826
Why didn't you say so?

215
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:07,034
Magical transactions are my specialty!

216
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:10,746
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

217
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:13,110
Hold on.

218
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:16,314
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."

219
00:16:19,557 --> 00:16:21,468
Ogre for a day.

220
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:24,993
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

221
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:26,146
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

222
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:29,753
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

223
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:33,148
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

224
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:38,710
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

225
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:42,392
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

226
00:16:42,557 --> 00:16:44,548
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

227
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:47,595
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

228
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,509
- A day.
- A day.

229
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:50,666
Rat's done!

230
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:55,194
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

231
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:58,155
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

232
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,911
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

233
00:17:01,077 --> 00:17:04,592
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

234
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,509
No one will even know you're gone.

235
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:12,229
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

236
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,068
Still, I don't know.

237
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:18,627
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

238
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:21,186
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

239
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:25,275
So what day would I have to give up?

240
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:28,190
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

241
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:30,666
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

242
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:33,146
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

243
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,875
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

244
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:39,796
Just for an example.

245
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:41,629
How about the day I met Donkey?

246
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:44,186
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

247
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,276
I don't know who that is.

248
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,545
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

249
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,833
Like a day when you were a baby.

250
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:57,025
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

251
00:17:57,197 --> 00:18:01,395
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

252
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,277
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

253
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:08,907
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

254
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,556
Just 24 tiny little hours.

255
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,708
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

256
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:15,027
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

257
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,757
So why start now?

258
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:27,476
Go on, Shrek.

259
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:29,116
Sign it!

260
00:18:30,157 --> 00:18:31,556
Go on, Shrek.

261
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:34,116
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

262
00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:36,986
You signed it.

263
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,830
So, tell me. What happens now?

264
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:41,589
Have a nice day.

265
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,146
I think I fell on my keys.

266
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,545
<i>There are 40 children in that shoe,</i>

267
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:05,428
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

268
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:06,586
Oh, great.

269
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:09,146
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

270
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,306
Ogre!

271
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:34,270
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

272
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,590
This is the part where you run away!

273
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,666
Sure is great to be wanted again.

274
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:54,390
Nice one.

275
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:04,036
Fiona?

276
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:15,230
Oh, no.

277
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,229
My home.

278
00:21:31,517 --> 00:21:32,791
Fiona!

279
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,596
Fiona! Are you in there?!

280
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:15,827
All right, Rumpel!

281
00:22:16,477 --> 00:22:18,866
This wasn't part of the deal!

282
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:23,510
Rumpel!

283
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:45,993
Ogre!

284
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:50,234
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

285
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:53,309
Who are you?!

286
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:55,388
What are you doing in my swamp?

287
00:23:01,397 --> 00:23:03,513
Looks like a troublemaker!

288
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:16,785
Spread 'em!

289
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:20,953
Nice job, ladies!

290
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:32,315
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

291
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,991
You have the right to shut your mouth!

292
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:57,113
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

293
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,191
Donkey!

294
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:10,546
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

295
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,754
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

296
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:22,870
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

297
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,716
Will you witches make up your mind?

298
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:38,593
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

299
00:24:39,197 --> 00:24:41,791
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

300
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:43,549
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

301
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:46,390
Tell me to E-l-E-l-O.
"E-l-E-l-No!" That's what I said.

302
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:50,106
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

303
00:24:50,277 --> 00:24:52,996
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

304
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:54,476
I've never seen you before in my life.

305
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:57,105
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

306
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,347
And how do you
know my name anyway?

307
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:02,270
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

308
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,270
A donkey and an ogre friends?

309
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,587
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

310
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:11,706
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

311
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,914
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

312
00:25:15,677 --> 00:25:18,635
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

313
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,351
Oh, no.

314
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:41,757
It's time to crumble!

315
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:46,069
<i>Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!</i>

316
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,226
Yeah!

317
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:51,556
Gingy?

318
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:57,109
Gingy snap!

319
00:25:59,597 --> 00:26:00,586
There's one!

320
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,395
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

321
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:04,231
Hideous monster!

322
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,955
Filthy, filthy creature!

323
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:08,312
Disgusting creature!

324
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:34,955
Move it!

325
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:53,996
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

326
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:57,194
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

327
00:27:32,797 --> 00:27:34,549
Mr. Stiltskin?

328
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:38,553
You got another customer.

329
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:41,306
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.

330
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,229
Bring me my business wig.

331
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:45,513
Mr. Stiltskin, please!

332
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:50,672
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

333
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,068
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

334
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,876
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

335
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:58,711
Stiltskin!

336
00:28:00,037 --> 00:28:01,072
Shrek!

337
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:04,356
There he is!

338
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,670
So close!

339
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:10,230
Have I been waiting for you!

340
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:13,466
Ladies, this is the guy

341
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:16,868
that made all of this possible!

342
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,351
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

343
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:23,509
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

344
00:28:23,677 --> 00:28:26,714
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

345
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:30,506
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

346
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,030
They would never do that.

347
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:36,634
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

348
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:40,307
<i>And then they disappeared!</i>

349
00:28:49,277 --> 00:28:50,596
They would have done anything

350
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:52,793
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

351
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:55,232
I ended Fiona's curse!

352
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:58,594
How could you when you never existed?

353
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:01,635
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

354
00:29:01,797 --> 00:29:03,992
Here, let me spell it out for you!

355
00:29:04,157 --> 00:29:08,309
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

356
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:12,516
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

357
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:17,510
You took the day I was born.

358
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:20,555
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

359
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,107
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

360
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:26,871
But you haven't heard the best part.

361
00:29:27,037 --> 00:29:32,509
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

362
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:37,955
Where's Fiona?

363
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:39,786
Where's my family?

364
00:29:39,957 --> 00:29:43,029
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

365
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:45,631
You see, you were never born.

366
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:47,833
You never met Fiona.

367
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:51,433
Your kids don't exist.

368
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:57,269
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

369
00:29:59,037 --> 00:30:01,346
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

370
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:05,434
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

371
00:30:07,357 --> 00:30:08,585
Get him, witches!

372
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:21,794
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

373
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:24,517
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

374
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,829
Come on, girls!

375
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:46,586
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

376
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:50,835
I'll be right back, Donkey!

377
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:54,273
I don't know you! I don't know him!

378
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:14,868
I'm glad I'm not you.

379
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:20,631
Help me! Help!

380
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:22,786
Help!

381
00:31:30,877 --> 00:31:32,356
No, not my pretty ball!

382
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:38,389
Watch out!

383
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:51,026
Wolfie?

384
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:53,427
My angry wig.

385
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:04,949
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

386
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:06,470
Donkey! Get off of me!

387
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:09,435
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

388
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:17,755
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

389
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,828
I'm being ass-napped!

390
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:21,552
Animal cruelty! Help!

391
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:23,708
You need to calm down!

392
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:24,992
I'm your friend.

393
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:27,708
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

394
00:32:28,637 --> 00:32:30,434
Good. I'm gonna let go...

395
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,952
...right... now.

396
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,551
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

397
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:38,072
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

398
00:32:38,237 --> 00:32:40,705
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

399
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,868
Because...

400
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,671
OK.

401
00:33:23,957 --> 00:33:28,030
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

402
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:02,757
I've never seen an ogre cry.

403
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:09,675
I'm not crying.

404
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:11,793
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

405
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:14,755
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

406
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:19,069
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

407
00:34:20,357 --> 00:34:23,190
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

408
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:25,154
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

409
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,069
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

410
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:29,311
By the way, why are you upset?

411
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:32,230
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

412
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:34,592
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

413
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:37,317
No. I signed this.

414
00:34:37,957 --> 00:34:40,346
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

415
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:41,791
Yeah, I got that.

416
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,868
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

417
00:34:44,037 --> 00:34:46,267
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

418
00:34:47,077 --> 00:34:49,432
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

419
00:34:49,597 --> 00:34:50,712
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

420
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:52,708
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

421
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:54,435
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

422
00:34:54,597 --> 00:34:56,827
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

423
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:58,828
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

424
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,147
Here, let me show you how it's done.

425
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,750
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

426
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,509
without picking up a few tricks.

427
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:06,793
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

428
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:09,152
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

429
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,511
What are you doing?

430
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:13,635
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

431
00:35:13,797 --> 00:35:16,948
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

432
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,392
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

433
00:35:19,557 --> 00:35:23,550
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

434
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:25,947
"Try Lou's Bliss."

435
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:29,826
Who's Lou?

436
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,715
Give me that!

437
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,793
"True Love's Kiss."

438
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:43,386
You have to take me to dinner first.

439
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:47,234
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

440
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:50,753
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void."

441
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:54,273
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

442
00:35:54,437 --> 00:35:59,033
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

443
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,995
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

444
00:36:03,557 --> 00:36:04,956
Well, that's just it, you see.

445
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,916
I don't know.

446
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:09,147
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

447
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,547
So... where did you leave her last?

448
00:36:12,197 --> 00:36:14,267
The last time I saw her,

449
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:16,997
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

450
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:21,909
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

451
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:24,545
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

452
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:26,753
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

453
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:28,748
They keep dragons in there!

454
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:31,910
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

455
00:36:32,077 --> 00:36:34,875
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

456
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,431
Fiona!

457
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,789
Oh, no.

458
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:34,472
If I didn't save Fiona...

459
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:38,955
...then who did?

460
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:53,673
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

461
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:57,193
It's a symbol of our love.

462
00:37:57,997 --> 00:37:59,066
Now smell it!

463
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,034
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

464
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:04,587
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

465
00:38:04,757 --> 00:38:07,225
so stop complaining and start smelling.

466
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:08,796
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

467
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:10,595
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

468
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:13,066
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

469
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,876
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

470
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:17,356
And another thing...

471
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:19,716
Wait a minute.

472
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:21,710
I think I got something.

473
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,512
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

474
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,235
Luscious and tasty.

475
00:38:26,397 --> 00:38:28,831
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

476
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:31,392
Donkey!

477
00:38:35,237 --> 00:38:37,228
Yeah! Waffles!

478
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:40,230
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

479
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:44,193
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

480
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:46,427
Donkey! Don't eat that!

481
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:50,556
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

482
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:52,514
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

483
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:55,307
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you?

484
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,354
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

485
00:38:57,517 --> 00:39:01,396
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

486
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:03,266
You did.

487
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:11,186
Look out!

488
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:15,146
Donkey!

489
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:17,626
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

490
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:20,752
Donkey.

491
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,670
Help! Help me!

492
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:27,476
Help, Shrek! Help!

493
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:51,426
Watch your head.

494
00:39:51,637 --> 00:39:52,911
Hey, it's a new guy!

495
00:39:53,077 --> 00:39:55,113
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

496
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:56,949
He's really tiny, isn't he?

497
00:39:57,117 --> 00:39:59,108
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

498
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:00,835
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

499
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,874
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

500
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:09,389
- Hey!
- Here you go.

501
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:17,150
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

502
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:20,753
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

503
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:31,395
I didn't know we could do that.

504
00:40:31,557 --> 00:40:33,946
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

505
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:38,395
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

506
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:40,866
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

507
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:43,107
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

508
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,233
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

509
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:47,388
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

510
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:48,592
Your dinner is my friend!

511
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:50,793
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

512
00:40:50,957 --> 00:40:52,868
- She's back.
- There she is.

513
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:11,032
Fiona!

514
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:15,068
I'm so happy I found you!

515
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,236
Maybe you missed orientation,

516
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:27,753
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

517
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,749
You don't know who I am, do you?

518
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,350
No.

519
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:34,428
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

520
00:41:34,597 --> 00:41:36,667
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

521
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:39,226
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

522
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,274
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

523
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:45,794
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

524
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:47,948
...we're married. Hear me out.

525
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:50,756
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

526
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,270
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

527
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:54,393
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."

528
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:56,866
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

529
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:59,267
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

530
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,106
Right? Who's with me?

531
00:42:05,797 --> 00:42:08,311
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

532
00:42:08,477 --> 00:42:10,593
Fiona, I need to...

533
00:42:12,037 --> 00:42:14,426
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

534
00:42:14,597 --> 00:42:16,349
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

535
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:18,508
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

536
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:48,910
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

537
00:42:49,077 --> 00:42:52,513
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

538
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:57,074
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

539
00:42:57,477 --> 00:43:00,389
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

540
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:08,227
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

541
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:12,231
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

542
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:16,029
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

543
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:19,189
But we're not just an empire.

544
00:43:19,717 --> 00:43:20,911
We're a family.

545
00:43:21,877 --> 00:43:25,426
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

546
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:26,586
Good.

547
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:29,829
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

548
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:33,990
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

549
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:36,468
It doesn't matter to me.

550
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:39,276
It's not like it's the end of the world.

551
00:43:40,397 --> 00:43:43,195
Except... funny thing.

552
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:46,713
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

553
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:49,596
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

554
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:52,794
it is the end of the world! Our world!

555
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:54,754
My empire!

556
00:43:58,157 --> 00:44:00,512
But, as I was saying,

557
00:44:00,677 --> 00:44:04,556
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

558
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:07,868
Yelling makes me so parched.

559
00:44:08,037 --> 00:44:11,712
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

560
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:14,630
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

561
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:17,834
<i>...of agua purificada?</i>

562
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:20,227
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

563
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:23,108
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

564
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:25,791
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

565
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:27,026
Faster brooms?

566
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,710
- No!
- Pointier hats?

567
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,435
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

568
00:44:30,597 --> 00:44:32,235
a professional bounty hunter?

569
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,070
What a world! What a world!

570
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:40,435
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

571
00:44:41,037 --> 00:44:42,595
I need a bounty hunter.

572
00:44:42,757 --> 00:44:45,794
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

573
00:44:45,957 --> 00:44:49,029
...then I think I might know
just the person!

574
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:55,350
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

575
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:58,554
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

576
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:00,355
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

577
00:45:00,517 --> 00:45:02,269
I bet that's because of us.

578
00:45:02,437 --> 00:45:04,109
If that cupcake-eating clown

579
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:07,269
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

580
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:09,145
...he'll be vulnerable.

581
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:12,354
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

582
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:14,553
they'll reach the river by midnight.

583
00:45:14,717 --> 00:45:18,073
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

584
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:21,434
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

585
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,394
And then we attack!

586
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:32,034
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

587
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,425
That's my chimichanga stand.

588
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:36,547
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

589
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:40,266
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

590
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:42,875
Go and finish your little speech.

591
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:46,907
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

592
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,626
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

593
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:53,311
Far Far Away will finally be free.

594
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:55,149
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

595
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:58,434
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

596
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,793
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

597
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:05,425
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

598
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,076
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

599
00:46:07,237 --> 00:46:08,670
Revolution?

600
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:10,668
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

601
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:13,351
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

602
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:15,235
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

603
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,308
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

604
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:20,389
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

605
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:21,992
I do?!

606
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:24,955
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

607
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:26,266
I'm a daddy?

608
00:46:26,437 --> 00:46:29,668
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

609
00:46:31,597 --> 00:46:33,315
...then I can do it again.

610
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:36,273
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

611
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:37,950
Donkey!

612
00:46:38,117 --> 00:46:39,470
Hello?

613
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:41,992
Fiona?

614
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:50,715
<i>You should not be here, senor.</i>

615
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:52,196
Puss?

616
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,115
You've gotta be kidding me.

617
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:00,616
<u><b><i>Rip made by ForsakeN</u></b></i>

618
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,752
Feed me, if you dare.

619
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:18,114
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

620
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,315
...fancy.
- Do I know you?

621
00:47:22,477 --> 00:47:24,945
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

622
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:26,789
Your wee little boots?

623
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:29,312
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

624
00:47:29,477 --> 00:47:32,435
But you're Puss in Boots.

625
00:47:33,037 --> 00:47:34,550
Maybe once.

626
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:36,196
But that is a name I have outgrown.

627
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:37,949
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

628
00:47:38,117 --> 00:47:42,030
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

629
00:47:42,197 --> 00:47:44,665
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

630
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:47,749
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

631
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:50,636
I'll get him later.

632
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:53,106
Puss, what have I done to you?

633
00:47:53,277 --> 00:47:54,676
You've gone soft.

634
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:59,430
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

635
00:48:00,557 --> 00:48:02,115
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

636
00:48:02,277 --> 00:48:04,427
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

637
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:07,589
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

638
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:10,590
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

639
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:12,668
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

640
00:48:12,837 --> 00:48:16,466
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

641
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,032
A gift basket?

642
00:48:18,197 --> 00:48:20,711
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

643
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:23,152
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

644
00:48:23,757 --> 00:48:26,112
Skunk-scented candle.

645
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:30,475
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

646
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:32,593
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."

647
00:48:32,757 --> 00:48:34,987
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

648
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:38,547
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.

649
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:40,628
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

650
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:42,276
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

651
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:44,553
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

652
00:48:44,717 --> 00:48:46,753
I suggest you take your gift basket,

653
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:50,466
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

654
00:48:51,117 --> 00:48:55,235
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

655
00:48:55,397 --> 00:48:58,309
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

656
00:48:59,877 --> 00:49:00,866
An apologetic hug?

657
00:49:02,037 --> 00:49:03,265
And a quick kiss goodbye.

658
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:05,706
Hey!

659
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,347
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

660
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:13,228
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

661
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:16,389
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

662
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:20,596
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

663
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,555
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

664
00:49:23,717 --> 00:49:25,196
I am.

665
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,151
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

666
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:37,386
Honk.

667
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,070
All right, Piggies, be gone!

668
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:41,353
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

669
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:44,154
This little piggy wants to go home!

670
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:47,468
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

671
00:50:00,677 --> 00:50:03,714
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

672
00:50:05,717 --> 00:50:06,752
Good.

673
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,589
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

674
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:11,510
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

675
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:24,555
OK, got it!

676
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:27,753
Make it stop!

677
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:33,196
All right, that's enough.

678
00:50:36,397 --> 00:50:39,912
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

679
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,636
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

680
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:47,709
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!

681
00:50:47,877 --> 00:50:49,788
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

682
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:54,829
Here, now make sure they eat up!

683
00:50:54,997 --> 00:50:58,148
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

684
00:50:58,317 --> 00:50:59,750
Din-din!

685
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,950
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

686
00:51:10,117 --> 00:51:12,312
All right, but this is the last time.

687
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:14,786
Here it comes. Look at him.

688
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:21,669
I see you!

689
00:51:28,317 --> 00:51:30,114
That's quite a friend you've got there.

690
00:51:30,277 --> 00:51:32,313
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

691
00:51:32,477 --> 00:51:34,991
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

692
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:37,352
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

693
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:40,475
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

694
00:51:43,157 --> 00:51:45,113
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

695
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:48,075
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

696
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:51,389
That's a good one, Cookie!

697
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:55,235
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

698
00:51:55,397 --> 00:51:56,830
Works on me.

699
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:59,750
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

700
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,148
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

701
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:06,195
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

702
00:52:08,277 --> 00:52:09,392
All right!

703
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:31,906
Hello!

704
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:37,748
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

705
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:40,511
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

706
00:52:40,677 --> 00:52:43,237
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

707
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:47,390
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

708
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:48,546
This one taken?

709
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:50,469
We use that to clean the toilets.

710
00:52:52,317 --> 00:52:55,309
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

711
00:52:55,477 --> 00:52:56,705
I knew that.

712
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,826
There you go, chief.

713
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,347
Hey... Scott?

714
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:19,589
My name is Shrek, actually.

715
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:22,476
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

716
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:26,107
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

717
00:53:26,597 --> 00:53:27,791
Well, let's see about that.

718
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,552
Hey! Hey... Hey!

719
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:31,706
What the?

720
00:53:36,237 --> 00:53:37,511
Fiona?

721
00:54:08,757 --> 00:54:09,985
I got it.

722
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:11,591
Give me your hand.

723
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:15,475
The dragon goes under the bridge,

724
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:17,787
through the loop and finally...

725
00:54:17,957 --> 00:54:19,470
Into the castle.

726
00:54:27,757 --> 00:54:29,031
Wow.

727
00:54:30,677 --> 00:54:32,713
OK. Good.

728
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:34,955
It seems like you can handle yourself.

729
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:36,994
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

730
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:40,035
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

731
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:53,953
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

732
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:55,630
Preparation is half the battle!

733
00:54:56,757 --> 00:55:01,035
<i>Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!</i>

734
00:55:01,517 --> 00:55:03,951
<i>Ogre, ogre, un momento!</i>

735
00:55:05,517 --> 00:55:06,745
Just give me a minute.

736
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:09,636
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

737
00:55:09,797 --> 00:55:12,834
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

738
00:55:12,997 --> 00:55:14,589
Back there, you and Fiona.

739
00:55:14,757 --> 00:55:17,317
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

740
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:19,115
I thought was long extinguished.

741
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:23,509
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

742
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:26,874
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

743
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:29,189
You know of her curse?

744
00:55:29,357 --> 00:55:32,508
By day, one way, by night another.

745
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:35,316
<i>This shall be the norm.</i>

746
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:38,833
<i>Until you find true love's first kiss...</i>

747
00:55:40,077 --> 00:55:43,786
<i>...and then take love's true form.</i>

748
00:55:44,637 --> 00:55:46,434
You even know the little rhyme!

749
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:48,986
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

750
00:55:49,157 --> 00:55:51,227
- How?
- Convince her!

751
00:55:51,397 --> 00:55:52,671
Go to her when she is alone

752
00:55:52,837 --> 00:55:56,352
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

753
00:55:56,517 --> 00:55:57,996
Know about what?!

754
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:02,511
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

755
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:20,709
Excuse me. Coming through!

756
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,471
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

757
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:26,390
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

758
00:56:26,557 --> 00:56:29,310
<i>Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!</i>

759
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:31,513
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

760
00:56:31,677 --> 00:56:33,952
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

761
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,270
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

762
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:48,914
Secure your positions!

763
00:57:04,597 --> 00:57:07,031
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

764
00:57:07,197 --> 00:57:08,186
Get back in position!

765
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:11,315
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

766
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:12,876
You are going to ruin everything!

767
00:57:13,037 --> 00:57:15,187
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

768
00:57:15,357 --> 00:57:17,951
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

769
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,069
How do you know about my curse?!

770
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:25,469
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

771
00:57:25,637 --> 00:57:28,071
I can explain everything.

772
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:34,110
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

773
00:57:34,277 --> 00:57:36,996
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

774
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:05,146
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

775
00:58:05,317 --> 00:58:07,114
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

776
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:10,394
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

777
00:58:10,557 --> 00:58:13,469
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

778
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,229
I know everything about you.

779
00:58:15,397 --> 00:58:18,275
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

780
00:58:18,437 --> 00:58:20,507
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

781
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:23,237
- you put a heart over the "l".
- So what?

782
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:25,308
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

783
00:58:25,477 --> 00:58:27,388
you cross your fingers on both hands,

784
00:58:27,557 --> 00:58:31,186
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

785
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:34,110
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

786
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,869
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

787
00:58:36,037 --> 00:58:37,948
because every time
you close your eyes...

788
00:58:38,957 --> 00:58:41,835
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

789
00:58:43,477 --> 00:58:45,513
But, most importantly, Fiona...

790
00:58:46,477 --> 00:58:49,913
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

791
00:58:52,117 --> 00:58:54,108
...is because you've
never been kissed...

792
00:58:55,477 --> 00:58:56,546
...well...

793
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:00,072
...by me.

794
00:59:09,237 --> 00:59:12,991
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

795
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,987
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

796
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:20,149
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

797
00:59:20,317 --> 00:59:22,956
No, I can't stop myself!

798
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:25,836
Please! Make it stop!

799
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:28,067
I can't control myself!

800
00:59:31,757 --> 00:59:34,749
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

801
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:39,272
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

802
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:44,827
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

803
00:59:44,997 --> 00:59:49,229
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

804
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:07,470
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

805
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,913
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

806
01:00:11,077 --> 01:00:13,671
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!

807
01:00:13,837 --> 01:00:15,395
Then it's up to me!

808
01:00:23,597 --> 01:00:27,272
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

809
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:32,475
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

810
01:00:57,117 --> 01:00:59,506
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

811
01:00:59,677 --> 01:01:00,712
Say what?!

812
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:02,911
No. Hell...

813
01:01:05,277 --> 01:01:08,189
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

814
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:14,752
All right!

815
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:16,226
Stop!

816
01:01:16,397 --> 01:01:18,752
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

817
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:21,636
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

818
01:01:21,797 --> 01:01:23,025
Puss, say something.

819
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:24,994
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

820
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,193
That's how you knew so much about me.

821
01:01:27,357 --> 01:01:30,315
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

822
01:01:30,477 --> 01:01:32,035
It's the only way to save your friends.

823
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:33,186
Get out of my way.

824
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,349
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

825
01:02:01,877 --> 01:02:05,916
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

826
01:02:06,077 --> 01:02:08,591
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

827
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:10,748
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

828
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:13,147
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

829
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,911
I did. I saved myself.

830
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:20,347
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

831
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:22,826
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

832
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:24,316
How would you know?

833
01:02:24,477 --> 01:02:27,071
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

834
01:02:27,237 --> 01:02:29,956
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

835
01:02:30,117 --> 01:02:32,347
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

836
01:02:32,517 --> 01:02:34,985
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

837
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:39,673
But... But I'm your true love.

838
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:43,113
Then where were you
when I needed you?

839
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:56,866
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

840
01:02:57,477 --> 01:02:58,466
No.

841
01:02:58,997 --> 01:03:00,715
The kiss didn't work...

842
01:03:01,637 --> 01:03:03,867
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

843
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:11,795
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

844
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:16,030
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

845
01:03:17,357 --> 01:03:20,155
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

846
01:03:22,157 --> 01:03:25,274
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

847
01:03:25,437 --> 01:03:27,029
Wolfie! My speech wig.

848
01:03:27,197 --> 01:03:31,270
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

849
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:36,151
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.

850
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:41,035
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

851
01:03:42,357 --> 01:03:45,633
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

852
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:47,788
...shepherd of your dreams.

853
01:03:49,557 --> 01:03:52,390
Recently, a certain somebody

854
01:03:52,557 --> 01:03:55,754
has jeopardised our joyous lives.

855
01:03:56,677 --> 01:04:01,432
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

856
01:04:01,597 --> 01:04:03,792
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

857
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:06,346
For whomever brings me this ogre,

858
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:10,351
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

859
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:12,350
Just think of it! Total and

860
01:04:12,517 --> 01:04:14,155
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

861
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:17,627
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

862
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:19,708
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

863
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:24,314
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

864
01:04:24,597 --> 01:04:27,555
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

865
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:33,314
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

866
01:04:33,797 --> 01:04:36,709
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

867
01:04:40,797 --> 01:04:42,753
Go back where you came from!

868
01:04:45,797 --> 01:04:47,355
It seems that we are safe.

869
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:50,190
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

870
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:54,270
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

871
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:57,315
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

872
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,832
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

873
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:02,272
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

874
01:05:02,437 --> 01:05:04,029
There is no tomorrow.

875
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:07,985
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

876
01:05:08,157 --> 01:05:11,513
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

877
01:05:11,677 --> 01:05:15,113
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

878
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:18,508
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

879
01:05:23,117 --> 01:05:24,869
I didn't know what I had.

880
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:30,713
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

881
01:05:31,277 --> 01:05:34,667
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

882
01:05:34,837 --> 01:05:35,826
Gingy?

883
01:05:36,597 --> 01:05:38,906
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

884
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:40,305
Collecting my bounty!

885
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:42,388
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

886
01:05:43,117 --> 01:05:45,472
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

887
01:05:45,637 --> 01:05:48,515
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

888
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:51,589
Where all your wishes come true.

889
01:05:53,197 --> 01:05:54,471
Wait a minute.

890
01:05:55,237 --> 01:05:57,831
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

891
01:05:57,997 --> 01:06:02,115
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

892
01:06:02,277 --> 01:06:04,507
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

893
01:06:08,717 --> 01:06:10,628
Were you going to eat that?

894
01:06:12,557 --> 01:06:15,515
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

895
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:18,828
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

896
01:06:18,997 --> 01:06:19,986
- And that...
- Roar.

897
01:06:20,157 --> 01:06:21,146
...is just sad.

898
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:23,754
And what is that supposed to be?

899
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:25,430
I'm just a frightened old man.

900
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:28,395
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

901
01:06:28,557 --> 01:06:30,115
That is your father painted green.

902
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,233
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

903
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:34,706
Take them away!

904
01:06:34,877 --> 01:06:37,630
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

905
01:06:37,797 --> 01:06:40,391
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

906
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:42,151
Stiltskin!

907
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:45,315
I hear you're looking for me.

908
01:06:46,117 --> 01:06:47,994
All right! Finally!

909
01:06:48,157 --> 01:06:51,467
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

910
01:06:51,637 --> 01:06:53,389
- I do.
- What? But...

911
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:57,311
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

912
01:07:00,197 --> 01:07:03,792
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

913
01:07:03,957 --> 01:07:06,425
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

914
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:08,394
So if you thought you were just gonna...

915
01:07:09,397 --> 01:07:13,470
...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

916
01:07:13,997 --> 01:07:16,306
Then what do you want?

917
01:07:26,637 --> 01:07:29,026
The ogres. They are all free.

918
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:30,630
But where is Shrek?

919
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:37,827
This is not good.

920
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:42,273
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

921
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:48,034
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

922
01:07:48,557 --> 01:07:51,117
All that matters is that they're free...

923
01:07:51,597 --> 01:07:53,508
...and Fiona is safe.

924
01:07:54,957 --> 01:07:57,790
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

925
01:07:58,437 --> 01:07:59,665
But, hey...

926
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:02,635
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

927
01:08:03,437 --> 01:08:04,836
Fiona!

928
01:08:12,877 --> 01:08:16,995
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

929
01:08:17,157 --> 01:08:18,351
Oh, yeah.

930
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:22,954
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

931
01:08:25,837 --> 01:08:31,389
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

932
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:35,313
Nobody's smart but me!

933
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:45,506
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

934
01:08:46,237 --> 01:08:47,226
Thank you.

935
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:50,147
No, you were right.

936
01:08:50,957 --> 01:08:52,993
I wasn't there for you.

937
01:08:53,157 --> 01:08:55,387
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

938
01:08:56,677 --> 01:08:58,349
...every day since.

939
01:08:59,277 --> 01:09:00,392
Well...

940
01:09:01,357 --> 01:09:02,915
...you're here now.

941
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,235
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

942
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:08,716
Don't be a fool, mule!

943
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:11,266
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

944
01:09:11,437 --> 01:09:14,588
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

945
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:17,635
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

946
01:09:17,797 --> 01:09:20,550
Hey! We can hear you!

947
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,790
Sorry!

948
01:09:24,197 --> 01:09:25,949
We must get into the palace.

949
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:28,153
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

950
01:09:28,317 --> 01:09:29,796
But how?

951
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:33,790
The same way we're gonna bust in.

952
01:09:38,077 --> 01:09:42,036
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

953
01:09:42,197 --> 01:09:43,710
I guess it'll have to do.

954
01:09:48,957 --> 01:09:53,473
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

955
01:09:53,637 --> 01:09:56,310
The main event of the evening!

956
01:09:56,477 --> 01:09:59,514
I present Shrek and Fiona!

957
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:08,276
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

958
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:12,032
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

959
01:10:12,197 --> 01:10:15,633
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

960
01:10:15,797 --> 01:10:17,310
...Dragon!

961
01:10:39,357 --> 01:10:41,552
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

962
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:46,266
In Boots!

963
01:11:15,157 --> 01:11:17,113
Get them, get them, witches!

964
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:20,356
Incoming!

965
01:11:24,397 --> 01:11:26,672
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

966
01:11:26,837 --> 01:11:28,156
Your wife!

967
01:11:51,237 --> 01:11:52,306
Uh-oh.

968
01:11:57,597 --> 01:12:00,748
I'll call you! We're in love!

969
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,436
Fiona, hold on!

970
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:16,635
Hey, you!

971
01:12:44,957 --> 01:12:47,915
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

972
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:55,706
Jump!

973
01:12:59,037 --> 01:13:00,186
Now!

974
01:13:13,677 --> 01:13:16,191
The dragon goes under the bridge!

975
01:13:17,277 --> 01:13:18,710
Through the loop!

976
01:13:18,877 --> 01:13:19,912
And finally...

977
01:13:20,077 --> 01:13:21,590
Into the castle!

978
01:13:27,997 --> 01:13:29,316
Run!

979
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:36,471
Foo!

980
01:13:38,237 --> 01:13:39,511
So long!

981
01:13:42,277 --> 01:13:43,346
Come on, Fifi, go!

982
01:13:43,517 --> 01:13:45,314
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

983
01:13:46,397 --> 01:13:48,911
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

984
01:13:49,077 --> 01:13:52,308
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

985
01:13:53,117 --> 01:13:54,391
Fifi, no!

986
01:13:58,957 --> 01:14:00,788
Victory is ours!

987
01:14:08,837 --> 01:14:11,715
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

988
01:14:11,877 --> 01:14:14,345
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

989
01:14:14,517 --> 01:14:16,394
You have no idea.

990
01:14:23,997 --> 01:14:25,271
Shrek?

991
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:30,710
His day is up. His day is!

992
01:14:31,277 --> 01:14:32,392
Shrek?

993
01:14:33,437 --> 01:14:35,029
It's all right.

994
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,632
There has to be something I can do.

995
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:44,907
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

996
01:14:45,077 --> 01:14:47,545
You gave me a home and a family.

997
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,389
You have kids?

998
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:51,468
We have kids.

999
01:14:51,637 --> 01:14:55,346
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

1000
01:14:55,517 --> 01:14:56,791
...Felicia.
- Felicia.

1001
01:14:57,637 --> 01:15:00,310
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

1002
01:15:00,837 --> 01:15:02,429
And someday...

1003
01:15:04,037 --> 01:15:05,311
...you will.

1004
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:18,117
You know what the
best part of today was?

1005
01:15:20,637 --> 01:15:24,630
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

1006
01:15:57,157 --> 01:15:59,876
Fiona, the sunrise!

1007
01:16:00,037 --> 01:16:02,232
You're still... an ogre!

1008
01:16:04,637 --> 01:16:07,470
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

1009
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:09,789
The kiss worked.

1010
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,471
What?!

1011
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:27,870
Fifi!

1012
01:16:29,597 --> 01:16:30,871
Puss!

1013
01:16:33,117 --> 01:16:34,789
No, no, no!

1014
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,915
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

1015
01:16:51,477 --> 01:16:52,876
I love you, Daddy!

1016
01:16:53,037 --> 01:16:56,154
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

1017
01:17:00,397 --> 01:17:03,469
Everybody, I have found another cake!

1018
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:06,392
Shrek? Are you OK?

1019
01:17:12,637 --> 01:17:16,630
Fiona. I've never been better.

1020
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,309
Roar!

1021
01:17:24,957 --> 01:17:27,187
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

1022
01:17:27,357 --> 01:17:29,552
Fergus, my little man!

1023
01:17:29,717 --> 01:17:31,912
And Felicia, sweetheart.

1024
01:17:32,077 --> 01:17:34,227
I believe this is yours.

1025
01:17:35,557 --> 01:17:37,149
Thank you, Daddy.

1026
01:17:38,597 --> 01:17:40,986
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

1027
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,193
