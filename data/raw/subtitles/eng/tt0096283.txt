1
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:32,010
Totoro

2
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,848
Go! Go! Go!

3
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:39,416
Energetic!

4
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,080
I like walking most.

5
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,417
Walk straight

6
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,419
Up the hills

7
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,422
Big tunnels

8
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,992
Grasslands

9
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:58,996
Long bridges

10
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:03,709
The lively road

11
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:07,476
Look at the spider nets

12
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:11,512
Down the hills

13
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:23,920
Go! Go! Go!

14
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:26,891
Energetic!

15
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:31,094
I like walking most

16
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,532
Walk straight

17
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,342
wolves

18
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:39,641
foxes

19
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,172
come here

20
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,817
deep to the forest

21
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,122
enjoy the adventure

22
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:54,826
Many many friends

23
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:59,523
Make me live happily

24
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,061
Many many friends

25
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:12,000
Make me live happily

26
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,823
Father, caramel.

27
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:36,428
Oh, thanks.

28
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,302
Are you tired?

29
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,272
It's just a little further.

30
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,610
Mei! Hide!

31
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:02,751
It wasn't a policeman.

32
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:35,252
Is someone there from this house?

33
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:39,563
Oh, thanks.

34
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,765
I'm Kusakabe.

35
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,703
We've arrived. Welcome!

36
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:47,936
Sorry for bothering

37
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,232
Thanks for your help

38
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:56,743
Thanks a lot.

39
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,429
Well, we've arrived.

40
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,839
Wait!

41
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:28,339
Mei, there's a bridge.

42
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:34,485
Fish.

43
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,219
See, it flashed again

44
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,087
Well, do you like it?

45
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:41,924
Father, it's beautiful!

46
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,525
A tunnel of trees.

47
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,002
Ah, that house?

48
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,306
Hurry

49
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:09,285
Yes!

50
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:13,286
It's like a haunted house!

51
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:23,759
It's rotten.

52
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,062
Mei, look!

53
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,604
There...Isn't it big?

54
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:13,045
Father, a huge tree!

55
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,154
Right, it's a camphor tree.

56
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,525
Oh, a camphor tree.

57
00:06:32,706 --> 00:06:34,139
A nut.

58
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:38,335
Let me see.

59
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,869
Another one.

60
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,242
Woo...

61
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,242
Here it is

62
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:54,122
Hey, hey.

63
00:06:54,527 --> 00:06:56,119
We've got to open up
the storm shutters.

64
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:57,923
Nuts!

65
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:02,062
They fell from above.

66
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,763
Squirrels?

67
00:07:08,975 --> 00:07:10,670
Or maybe acorn-

68
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:14,845
mice?

69
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,279
No, squirrels are better.

70
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,647
Where do you want this?

71
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,320
Ah, just a minute.
I'll open up over here.

72
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:23,121
Satsuki,

73
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,616
would you open the back door?

74
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,021
You should be able to find it.

75
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,287
Come on!

76
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,288
Wait!

77
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,395
Hurry up!

78
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm going in.

79
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,621
The bath...

80
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:36,685
Nobody's here

81
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,230
It's a bath

82
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,191
Father,
there's something in here.

83
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,102
Squirrels? I don't know.

84
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:46,165
Not cockroaches, not mice...

85
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,838
Black. There were a wholebunch!

86
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,050
Hmmmmm. Hmmmmm...

87
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:05,353
It must be Mak-kuro Kurosuke

88
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,292
Mak-kuro Kurosuke?

89
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:09,127
Like the ones in the picture book?

90
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,496
It must be...Ghosts

91
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,127
wouldn't be out on a beautiful day like this.

92
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,562
When you suddenly enter a dark place
from bright sunlight,

93
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,173
black spots appear in front of your eyes.

94
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,676
So that's it!

95
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:29,241
MAK-KURO KUROSUKE, COME ON OUT!

96
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:32,176
IF YOU DON'T, WE'LL PULL
YOU OUT BY YOUR EYEBALLS!!!

97
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:38,451
Okay, back to work.

98
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,589
Where are the stairs to the second floor?

99
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,956
Let's find the stairs
and open the upstairs windows.

100
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,095
Okay!

101
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:58,841
Toilet!

102
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,096
Not Here!

103
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,926
Not Here!

104
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:35,373
Mei, I found it....

105
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:42,816
It's pitch black.

106
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,451
Mak-kuro Kurosuke!

107
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,995
....A nut!

108
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,972
MAK-KURO KUROSUKE, COME OUT!

109
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:49,245
Mister Mak-kuro Kurosuke,
are you here?

110
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,037
Father,

111
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,947
there's something
in this house after all!

112
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,979
That's great!

113
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,919
Since I was a boy,

114
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:23,720
I've wanted to live in a haunted house!

115
00:12:27,193 --> 00:12:28,353
Ooops!

116
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,339
I got one!! Sis!!

117
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:42,826
What energy!

118
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:45,971
This is the neighbor-lady
who watches over this house.

119
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,267
She came to help us move in.

120
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,572
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.
How do you do?

121
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,339
How do you do?

122
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,578
What nice children.

123
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,349
If there had been time

124
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:01,446
I could have cleaned up the house.

125
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,748
You've done plenty.

126
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:07,019
We're so busy
in the fields right now,

127
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:10,784
but I cleaned a little,
every so often.

128
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:13,594
Mei, your hands are black!
What happened?

129
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,063
Mak-kuro Kurosuke escaped!

130
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:18,630
Oh, Mei, your feet...

131
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,407
Oh, mine are black too!

132
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,044
Oh, Oh. It looks like the 'susu-atari'
have come out.

133
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,422
Susu-atari?

134
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:41,360
Are susu-atari like this,
and move like this?

135
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,194
Yes,

136
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:46,462
they live in old, empty houses

137
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:50,391
and make dust here and there.

138
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,998
I could see them too, when I was young.

139
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,469
So, you also saw them...

140
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:00,211
Are they ghosts?

141
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:04,642
Nothing that scary.

142
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,950
If you're good,
they won't do anything bad.

143
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,479
Then before you know it,
they're gone.

144
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,189
They're probably up
in the ceiling right now,

145
00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:16,393
discussing whether to move out.

146
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:23,929
Mei, they're going to leave.

147
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,065
I don't like that.

148
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:28,432
But what would you do
if they came out at once?

149
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:29,730
Mei not scared.

150
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,274
Okay then.
I won't go with you to the toilet at night.

151
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,579
Say, would you go to the creek
and bring up some water?

152
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,319
The creek? Mei go too.

153
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,455
Mei,
you better stay and here and wait.

154
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,634
Have you caught the fish!

155
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,576
Granny!

156
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,050
Keep pumping,

157
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:19,386
until the water runs cold.

158
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:03,535
Oh, it's you.

159
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,298
What can I do for you?

160
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,499
From Mother, for Granny.

161
00:17:11,043 --> 00:17:13,034
What is it?

162
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:19,779
Wait! What is this?

163
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:23,419
Is that Kanta?

164
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:29,622
YAH-H-H!! YOUR HOUSE IS HAUNTED!!!

165
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,321
KANTA!

166
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:44,571
Ha, ha, ha!
Reminds me of when I was a boy.

167
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,136
I hate boys!

168
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,639
But I love Granny's sweet rice cake.

169
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,443
Eat all you like.

170
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:53,952
Thank you for all your help.

171
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:58,617
Thank you very much.

172
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,356
Goodbye!

173
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:18,098
Father,

174
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,095
this old house will fall down.

175
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,735
Ha, ha! What a problem,
since we just moved in.

176
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,579
HA HA HA HA HA! Everyone laugh!

177
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:05,644
So your fears will all run away.

178
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,851
Mei not scared,

179
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,551
Mei not scared.

180
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,366
One, two,

181
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:02,033
one, two...

182
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:10,248
Okay, laundry is finished.

183
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:21,425
Off we go!

184
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,171
Granny!

185
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:43,707
How are you!

186
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:45,811
Don't work too hard!

187
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,252
Where are you going?

188
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:51,145
To the hospital to visit mother!

189
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,583
That's nice!

190
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,386
Say hello for me!

191
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:58,196
Okay!

192
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:15,941
This way, this way!

193
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,243
Good day. Welcome.

194
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:48,543
Oh, MOTHER!

195
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:50,944
Mei, it's good to see you!

196
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:53,146
Father took the wrong road.

197
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,143
Really? Welcome.

198
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:57,511
Today is the Harvest Holiday.

199
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,626
Father's talkinbg with the doctor.

200
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,362
I'm so happy you all came.

201
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,024
How's the new house?

202
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,692
Are you settled in?

203
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:14,971
What? A haunted house?

204
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,901
Mother, do you like haunted houses?

205
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,302
Of course.

206
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,372
I've got to hurry and get well.
I'd like to meet a ghost.

207
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,247
That's good. Right, Mei?

208
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,083
We were worried.
If you were scared,

209
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:27,382
We wouldn't know what to do.

210
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:29,683
What about you two?We like it!!

211
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:31,984
Mei not scared!

212
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,591
Is Satsuki doing Mei's hair?

213
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,495
Your good at it.
Isn't that nice, Mei?

214
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,365
Unn, but Satsuki gets real mad.

215
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:45,865
That's because you never stay still.

216
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:47,067
Satsuki,

217
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:50,298
come here. Isn't it too short?

218
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,003
Satsuki,I like it this way.

219
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,436
Mei too, Mei too!

220
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,577
Unruly, just like always, isn't it.

221
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,418
Exactly like mine when I was your age.

222
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:03,745
When I grow up,
will my hair be just like Mother's?

223
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:05,983
Probably,

224
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:08,585
since you're just like I used to be.

225
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:27,711
Mother's looking good, isn't she?

226
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:29,145
Yes.

227
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,081
The doctor was saying
she'll be able to leave the hospital soon.

228
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,345
Soon? tomorrow?

229
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:36,787
There she goes again with 'tomorrow'.

230
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:38,520
Tomorrow is probably too soon, though.

231
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,120
Mother says she wants to sleep together
with Mei again.

232
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,653
But you're a big girl now.

233
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,564
Weren't you going to sleep by yourself?

234
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,862
With mother is okay.

235
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:11,581
Father,

236
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,019
it's morning!

237
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,798
Hey, WAKE UP!!

238
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:27,298
Starting today,

239
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,231
I'm taking lunck (to school).

240
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:31,739
Darn, I completely forgot.

241
00:25:32,244 --> 00:25:34,371
It's okay. I'll make everyone's.

242
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:36,474
It's burning!

243
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:40,846
This one is Mei's.

244
00:25:42,421 --> 00:25:43,911
Mei's?

245
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,523
Want meal

246
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:49,889
Here. Wrap it yourself, okay?

247
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,028
Satsuki-chan!

248
00:25:57,102 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, no!

249
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:00,234
OKAY!!

250
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:03,539
You made a friend already?

251
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,172
She called you 'Satsuki-chan'.

252
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:11,715
I've had enough.

253
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:15,249
I'll be going.

254
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:17,645
Have a nice day.

255
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:20,591
Morning.

256
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,255
Hurry, let's go.

257
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:26,393
Morning.

258
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:35,431
Father,

259
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:39,142
does Mei look like Sis?

260
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,176
Yes. Where are you going
with your lunch basket?

261
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,238
Just over there.

262
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:06,132
Father, is it time for lunch?

263
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:08,266
What, already?

264
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,114
Father is a florist, okay?

265
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,669
Tadpoles!

266
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,093
Ah, bottom's gone.

267
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,438
Found one!

268
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,605
Who are you?

269
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,049
Mak-Kuro Kurosuke?

270
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:27,704
To Ro Ro.

271
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:36,984
Totoro...Your name is Totoro, right?

272
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,691
So...it's Totoro, after all...Totoro.

273
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:50,790
See you later.

274
00:35:52,397 --> 00:35:53,295
I'm home.

275
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:55,859
Welcome. Oh, is it that time already?

276
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,693
Where's Mei?
I'm going over to Mit-chan's house.

277
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:01,230
We haven't had lunch yet.
Isn't she playing in the garden?

278
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,038
Mei!

279
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,003
MEI!!!

280
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:08,473
Mei!

281
00:36:11,015 --> 00:36:13,176
Mei!

282
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,421
Father, I found Mei's hat.

283
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,103
Mei, Mei!!

284
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:49,185
...MEI! Wake up

285
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:52,949
You can't sleep in a place like this!

286
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:57,555
Where's Totoro? Totoro?

287
00:36:58,029 --> 00:36:59,291
Huh? Huh?

288
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:03,766
Were you dreaming?

289
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,098
Totoro was here.

290
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:09,337
Totoro? You mean Tororo
that was in the picture book?

291
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,669
Unn. He said he was Totoro.

292
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:14,606
With fur,

293
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:16,469
and a mouth like this.

294
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:17,777
One like this,

295
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:23,651
and one about like this.

296
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,820
There you are, there you are.

297
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,351
Hey, how great.

298
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:32,821
Just like a secret hideaway.

299
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:35,458
Father! Mei, says she met Totoro here.

300
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,566
Totoro?

301
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,967
Over here!

302
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:49,980
Hey, wait!

303
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:56,754
Here?

304
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,948
Uh-uh.
Before he was by the big tree.

305
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:02,326
But there was only one pathway...

306
00:38:02,994 --> 00:38:03,892
Mei,

307
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:08,095
let's go home. I said, Mei!

308
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:21,573
It's true!

309
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:23,708
There really was Totoro!

310
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:26,446
Not a lie.

311
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:36,123
Mei...

312
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:38,553
It not lie.

313
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:43,600
Uh, Father and Satsuki
don't think you're a liar.

314
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:47,165
You must have met the keeper of the forest.

315
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:49,873
That means good fortune is with you.

316
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:53,099
But you can't see him all the time.

317
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,212
Sayy, we haven't offered
a prope greeting yet.

318
00:38:57,615 --> 00:38:58,479
Greeting?

319
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:00,817
Tsukamori! Let's go!

320
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:19,829
Mei's gotten so heavy.

321
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:21,694
Father, that camphor tree.

322
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:24,799
Isn't it huge?

323
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:34,045
There it is!

324
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:39,453
Father, hurry. Hurry!

325
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:51,324
The hole is gone.

326
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:52,927
Was this really the place?

327
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:56,462
She says the hole is gone.

328
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,639
Well, you can't see him all the time.

329
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:02,205
We'll see him again?
I want to meet him too.

330
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:05,911
Well, if good fortune is with you.

331
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,946
Isn't this a beautiful tree?

332
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:13,350
It's been here since long, long ago.

333
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:15,717
Back then,

334
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:20,057
man and trees were friends.

335
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,965
Father saw this tree

336
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,925
and fell in love with that house.

337
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,195
I'm sure Mother will like it too.

338
00:40:28,806 --> 00:40:30,467
Well, let's offer our greetings
and get back home.

339
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:31,706
We have to eat our lunch.

340
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,101
Oh yeah.
I was supposed to go to Mit-chan's.

341
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:37,913
Mei go too.

342
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:39,910
Thank you for taking care of Mei.

343
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:42,013
From this moment on,
'Onegai itashimasu'.

344
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,851
Onegai itashimasu.

345
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:46,856
A race to the house!

346
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:50,087
Wait!

347
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:53,828
Hurry!

348
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:57,399
Wait!

349
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,204
Today I have wonderful news.

350
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:04,908
Mei met the spirit, Totoro.

351
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:14,815
I'm thinking it would be wonderful
to meet him too.

352
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:47,138
Kanta! If you don't hurry,
you'll be late!

353
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,467
Attention!

354
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:32,348
Oh, it's Mei...

355
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:33,883
Teacher?

356
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:34,989
Yes, Satsuki?

357
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,954
My younger sister...

358
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:45,669
Granny, Mei...

359
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:51,539
Well, she says she wants to go where you are,
and she won't listen.

360
00:42:52,212 --> 00:42:56,114
But Mei, today's Father's day
at the university

361
00:42:56,516 --> 00:42:59,280
and you promised to be a good girl
and stay with Granny.

362
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:04,487
I have two more hours,

363
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,281
And Granny's busy too.

364
00:43:07,093 --> 00:43:09,118
She was a good girl all day,

365
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:11,053
right?

366
00:43:19,272 --> 00:43:21,467
Sigh....Granny,
I'll go and speak with the teacher.

367
00:43:27,514 --> 00:43:31,712
Satsuki's Mother is in the hospital

368
00:43:32,185 --> 00:43:34,380
and it's rather difficult right now.
Class, we'll do all we can to help, right?

369
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,919
Right!

370
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:43,423
What's that?

371
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:45,822
It's Totoro.

372
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:49,001
Shhhhh. You have to be quiet.

373
00:43:57,611 --> 00:44:03,049
Okay!

374
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,581
Tell them I'm going to skip the club today.

375
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:06,612
Okay, I'll tell the teacher.
See you later.

376
00:44:09,956 --> 00:44:10,581
Mei, let's hurry!

377
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:11,447
It looks like rain.

378
00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:41,079
Mei won't cry. Is she a big girl?

379
00:44:43,923 --> 00:44:46,721
Yes, but what a problem.

380
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:51,392
Please let us share your roof
for a little while.

381
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:38,210
But...

382
00:45:57,364 --> 00:45:58,626
Good thing. Right, Sis?

383
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:02,728
It's got holes.

384
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:16,244
Father didn't take an umbrella.

385
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,644
Mei go to meet him too.

386
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,516
And that's why I forgot it!

387
00:46:24,023 --> 00:46:26,514
What dummy would forget
his umbrella when it's raining?

388
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:28,719
That hurts!

389
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:31,192
You were probably swinging it
around and broke it.

390
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,926
I didn't!

391
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:47,337
Excuse me.

392
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh, Satsuki. And little Mei, too.

393
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:53,410
Granny!

394
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:56,679
Thank you for today.

395
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,489
You're welcome. It wasn't much.

396
00:46:59,392 --> 00:47:01,519
Oh, Kanta lent us his umbrella.

397
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:03,854
Really? That kid?

398
00:47:04,497 --> 00:47:05,987
It's such a beat up old umbrella.

399
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:07,228
Mei was with me,

400
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:08,532
so it really saved us.

401
00:47:08,968 --> 00:47:10,799
But Kanta got all wet.

402
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:12,866
Thank you. That's all right.

403
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,341
He's always so dirty anyway;
he must have gotten a little bit cleaner.

404
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:19,142
Are you going to meet your father?

405
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:20,903
Yes.

406
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:24,641
Mei-chan, bye bye.

407
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:36,686
Who came?

408
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,427
I don't know.

409
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,335
There it comes.

410
00:47:57,484 --> 00:47:59,076
Are you getting on?

411
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,643
All right, driver.

412
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,223
Father wasn't on it.

413
00:48:12,665 --> 00:48:14,690
It'll be the next bus for sure.

414
00:48:15,034 --> 00:48:17,093
Does Mei want to wait at Granny's house?

415
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:54,071
What's wrong?

416
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:26,596
Mei,

417
00:49:27,574 --> 00:49:28,836
are you sleepy?

418
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:30,903
That's why I told you...

419
00:49:31,578 --> 00:49:33,239
Want to go to Granny's house now?

420
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,180
Hold on, it's just a little longer...

421
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,090
The bus is sure late...Here.

422
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:20,444
Totoro?....

423
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,354
Ah, just a minute.

424
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,502
I'll lend you this...

425
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,533
Hurry,

426
00:51:41,908 --> 00:51:44,240
Mei will fall.

427
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:51,283
Use it like this.

428
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,917
The bus is coming!

429
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,991
Totoro took father's umbrella...

430
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:33,777
Ah, sorry, sorry.

431
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:39,782
The train was late and I missed the bus.

432
00:54:40,286 --> 00:54:41,810
Were you worried?

433
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,422
It came! Father,

434
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:47,793
it came! It came! A cat, a cat bus!

435
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:52,124
Really huge! With eyes like this!

436
00:54:52,398 --> 00:54:53,695
It was wonderful!

437
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:56,929
We met him, we met him! We met Totoro!

438
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:02,372
It was fantastic!

439
00:55:22,461 --> 00:55:25,453
Mother,
it feels like my heart is still racing.

440
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:29,664
Today is a scary day,
but is also a joyful day!

441
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:33,568
What's more? Totoro's gift!

442
00:55:33,973 --> 00:55:35,133
I was a fantastic, too.

443
00:55:35,474 --> 00:55:37,669
It was a bamboo-leaf package,
wied with a dragon's whisker.

444
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:40,101
When we got home, we opened it

445
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:44,113
and inside were nuts.

446
00:55:47,954 --> 00:55:50,047
If our garden became a forest,

447
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:53,216
it would be beautiful, so we planted them.

448
00:55:53,626 --> 00:55:55,856
But they just won't grow.

449
00:55:56,262 --> 00:55:58,059
Every day, Mei says

450
00:55:58,464 --> 00:56:00,932
'Still nothing, there's still nothing'.

451
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:05,392
She's just like
the crab of the monkey-crab fable.

452
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:12,166
It will soon be summer vacation.

453
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,513
Please hurry and get well.

454
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:17,074
Satsuki.

455
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:27,883
Okay, okay.
I'm going to turn it off. Wait.

456
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,193
Father,
I wonder if they'll come up tomorrow?

457
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:35,993
I wonder. Totoro would probably know.

458
00:56:36,335 --> 00:56:38,132
Good night.

459
00:57:26,452 --> 00:57:28,147
Mei,

460
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:46,898
that's where we planted the seeds.

461
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:22,763
Hooray! We did it, we did it!

462
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,976
Mei, we're the wind!

463
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:42,238
The tree is gone.

464
01:01:47,446 --> 01:01:50,472
We did it, we did it!

465
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:53,516
It was a dream but it wasn't a dream!

466
01:01:53,886 --> 01:01:57,754
It was a dream but it wasn't a dream!

467
01:01:57,956 --> 01:02:01,357
We did it!

468
01:02:17,142 --> 01:02:18,131
Mr. Kusakabe,

469
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:19,770
telegram.

470
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,547
Mr. Kusakabe,

471
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:25,016
it's a telegram.

472
01:02:27,319 --> 01:02:29,617
Nobody home?

473
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:36,960
Granny!

474
01:02:41,834 --> 01:02:43,768
Over here.

475
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,329
This one's ready to eat.

476
01:02:56,515 --> 01:02:57,948
Granny, how about this one?

477
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,250
It's ripe.

478
01:03:05,724 --> 01:03:08,716
Granny's garden is like a treasure-hill.

479
01:03:09,962 --> 01:03:12,021
Say, let's take a little rest...

480
01:03:18,904 --> 01:03:21,236
They're nice and cold.

481
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,800
Start

482
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:33,713
It's delicious.

483
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,288
Is it? They've gotten a lot of Mr. Sun,

484
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,981
so they're also good for you.

485
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:43,120
For Mother's sickness, too?
Of course.

486
01:03:43,595 --> 01:03:45,529
If you eat Granny's vegetables,

487
01:03:45,898 --> 01:03:47,195
you'll get real healthy fast.

488
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:49,796
Mother's coming home this Saturday.

489
01:03:50,169 --> 01:03:52,262
She will sleep with Mei.

490
01:03:53,806 --> 01:03:55,706
So she's finally
leaving the hospital.

491
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,399
Un-uh. It's not for good.

492
01:03:59,077 --> 01:04:00,669
She'll return to the hospital
on Monday.

493
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:02,603
It seems they're going
to release her gradually.

494
01:04:02,948 --> 01:04:04,279
Is that right?

495
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,014
Then we're going to have
to get her to eat more and more.

496
01:04:07,252 --> 01:04:09,720
The corn Mei picked, Mei will give to Mother.

497
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,815
That will make her so happy.

498
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:22,664
A telegram.

499
01:04:23,001 --> 01:04:24,093
Nobody was home
so we accepted it for you.

500
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:25,198
For our house?

501
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:30,000
Granny,

502
01:04:30,342 --> 01:04:31,604
Father won't be home until evening.

503
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:35,078
Open it. It might be an emergency.

504
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:42,713
P-l-e-a-s-e re-ply,
shi-koku-yama...Shikokuyama

505
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,081
Hospital!

506
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:45,856
It's form Mother's Hospital!

507
01:04:46,225 --> 01:04:47,886
Something's happened!

508
01:04:49,995 --> 01:04:52,088
Granny, what shall I do?

509
01:04:52,564 --> 01:04:54,395
We have to answer! Calm down,
calm down.

510
01:04:54,733 --> 01:04:56,132
Do you know where your father is?

511
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:57,933
I know the telephone number
of the research department,

512
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:59,632
but we don't have a phone.

513
01:04:59,872 --> 01:05:04,036
Kanta,

514
01:05:09,348 --> 01:05:12,374
take her to your uncle's.
Let her use the phone.

515
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,294
Mei, you stay with Granny!

516
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,764
Hello, long distance please.

517
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:08,831
Tokyo 31-1382. Yes.

518
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:13,635
Isn't she cute, Kanta?

519
01:06:16,048 --> 01:06:17,379
Hello,

520
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:22,114
yes...Hello,
is this the Kokogaku Research Department?

521
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:24,849
Father, I mean,
Mr. Kusakabe please.

522
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:28,050
This is Satsuki Kusakabe.

523
01:06:31,597 --> 01:06:33,121
All right....
Oh Father, it's Satsuki.

524
01:06:33,999 --> 01:06:35,227
Yes, what is it?

525
01:06:38,337 --> 01:06:40,601
Uh-huh...from the hospital?
I understand.

526
01:06:40,973 --> 01:06:42,634
I'll call the hospital right away.

527
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:43,871
Did something happen with Mother?

528
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,073
What shall I do? Father?

529
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:46,407
Don't worry.

530
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:49,042
As soon as I find out what it's all about,
I'll call you.

531
01:06:49,748 --> 01:06:51,113
Ask them to let you wait there.

532
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:54,977
I'm going to hang up now.

533
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,881
Granny, may I wait here?
Father will call back.

534
01:07:01,593 --> 01:07:03,493
Of course. Rest awhile.

535
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:12,469
Sis!

536
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:22,912
No way!

537
01:07:23,348 --> 01:07:25,942
This corn is for Mother.

538
01:07:26,718 --> 01:07:29,881
I said, no way!

539
01:07:46,805 --> 01:07:48,602
It seems Mother's not feeling well,

540
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:52,333
so they're delaying her home visit.

541
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:53,767
No!

542
01:07:55,047 --> 01:07:56,412
It can't be helped.

543
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:58,646
If she rushes it and gets worse,
what'll we do?

544
01:07:59,084 --> 01:08:00,210
No!

545
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:03,917
It's just a short postponement.

546
01:08:04,156 --> 01:08:05,714
No!

547
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,956
Then it's all right if Mother dies,
is that right?

548
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:11,191
NO!

549
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,890
You dummy!
I'm not talking to you anymore!

550
01:08:25,277 --> 01:08:27,142
Let's go.

551
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:33,210
Sis is a meany!

552
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,908
Let's put away the laundry.

553
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:07,045
Don't be so sad.

554
01:09:07,452 --> 01:09:10,444
Granny's come to help, so perk up.

555
01:09:15,827 --> 01:09:19,388
Isn't your Father at the hospital?

556
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:22,189
They say it's just a cold.

557
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:26,731
She'll be home next Saturday.

558
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:35,136
It was just like this last time.
Just a short stay at the hospital.

559
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:37,677
A little cold.

560
01:09:39,017 --> 01:09:40,985
What will we do if Mother dies?

561
01:09:41,586 --> 01:09:43,144
But, Satsuki...

562
01:09:43,655 --> 01:09:45,589
Maybe she'II...

563
01:09:49,294 --> 01:09:51,728
It's okay, it's okay.

564
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:56,494
Who would die and leave such nice children?

565
01:09:57,435 --> 01:09:58,766
Don't cry,

566
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:00,499
don't cry.

567
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:04,267
Granny will be here
till your father comes home.

568
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:49,878
Mei-chan!

569
01:10:55,093 --> 01:10:56,856
Mei!

570
01:11:00,098 --> 01:11:01,463
Mei!

571
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,028
Did Mei come home?

572
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:08,233
You didn't see her at the bus stop?

573
01:11:10,108 --> 01:11:11,166
Funny,

574
01:11:11,877 --> 01:11:13,401
where could she have gone?

575
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:15,437
A little while ago, we had a fight.

576
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:17,608
Because Mei's a ...

577
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:20,213
That kid.
I wonder if she went to Mother's hospital?

578
01:11:20,418 --> 01:11:22,716
The Shinkokuyama Hospital?

579
01:11:23,788 --> 01:11:26,450
It would even take an adult
at least three hours to walk there.

580
01:11:26,825 --> 01:11:27,757
I'm going to look.

581
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,584
Kanta!

582
01:11:30,962 --> 01:11:36,025
Hurry and call your father!

583
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:45,840
Mei's disappeared!

584
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:48,075
Darn Mei! She's always getting lost.

585
01:11:55,487 --> 01:11:57,478
MEI!

586
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:05,657
Excuse me, Mister.

587
01:12:06,231 --> 01:12:10,964
Did a little girl pass by on this road?

588
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:12,497
My little sister.

589
01:12:13,038 --> 01:12:14,471
Hmmmm...a little girl?

590
01:12:15,941 --> 01:12:17,772
I would remember if I saw someone...

591
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:20,969
I wonder if it was another road?

592
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:41,998
Are you sure she came this way?

593
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:43,792
I don't know.

594
01:12:52,277 --> 01:12:54,837
Mei!

595
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:18,099
Stop, please!

596
01:13:20,472 --> 01:13:21,871
You fool! That's dangerous!

597
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:24,735
Your little sister?

598
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,645
I think she's on her way to
the Shikokuyama Hospital.

599
01:13:29,147 --> 01:13:30,739
Four years old, a little girl.

600
01:13:31,316 --> 01:13:33,250
Ryoko, did you see anyone?

601
01:13:34,152 --> 01:13:36,017
Uh-uh. We came from Shikokuyama,

602
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,486
But we didn't see anyone like that.

603
01:13:39,257 --> 01:13:41,452
Oh. Thank you.

604
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,258
Where did you come from?

605
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:44,656
From Matsu-go.

606
01:13:45,063 --> 01:13:46,189
Matsu-go?

607
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:48,330
Isn't there some mistake?

608
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:51,602
Well, bye.

609
01:14:02,747 --> 01:14:04,180
Satsuki!

610
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:07,442
Kan-chan!

611
01:14:09,187 --> 01:14:09,983
Find her?

612
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,788
No. How about you?

613
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,187
Right now
Dad and the others are searching.

614
01:14:14,692 --> 01:14:16,421
I'll go to Shkokuyama for you.

615
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:17,817
You go home.

616
01:14:18,696 --> 01:14:20,254
Mei tried to get to the hospital

617
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,758
and got lost on the way. I'm sure.

618
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:25,600
A while ago, they found a sandal in the pond.

619
01:14:33,044 --> 01:14:35,410
We don't know for sure if it belongs to Mei!

620
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:54,631
Did you find her?

621
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,132
Nami Amida Buddha,

622
01:15:30,435 --> 01:15:31,060
Nami Amida Buddha...

623
01:15:31,136 --> 01:15:33,127
The mud's deeper over there!
Try there first!

624
01:15:34,139 --> 01:15:35,504
Hey, got another pole?

625
01:15:44,315 --> 01:15:46,010
Granny, Satsuki's coming.

626
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:52,454
Granny!

627
01:15:53,892 --> 01:15:55,325
This...this is it.

628
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:06,196
It's not Mei's.

629
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:18,347
Thank heaven.

630
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:22,348
I thought for sure it was Mei's.

631
01:16:22,687 --> 01:16:24,951
What, Granny junped to conclusions?

632
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,657
Hey, it was a mistake!

633
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:29,217
Where could she have gone?

634
01:16:29,661 --> 01:16:30,923
We'll have to start over again.

635
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:32,661
We'll have to hurry. It'll be dark soon.

636
01:16:32,997 --> 01:16:34,089
Thanks everyone.

637
01:16:34,499 --> 01:16:36,592
Let's divide up and search some more.

638
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:39,369
We we've found...

639
01:17:06,297 --> 01:17:09,425
Please let me through to Totoro's den.

640
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:10,928
Mei's lost.

641
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:12,936
It'll be dark soon,

642
01:17:13,304 --> 01:17:15,135
and that kid, she's lost somewhere.

643
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:47,033
Totoro!

644
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:51,801
Totoro! Mei's lost!

645
01:17:52,143 --> 01:17:53,542
I've searched all over,
but I can't find her.

646
01:17:53,978 --> 01:17:56,913
Please, find Mei.

647
01:17:57,181 --> 01:17:59,581
I'm sure she's crying somewhere right now.

648
01:18:00,485 --> 01:18:02,953
I don't know what to do!

649
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:03,603
Everyone can't see it!

650
01:19:55,867 --> 01:19:59,303
Mei-chan!

651
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:28,961
The trees are leaning out of the way!

652
01:21:00,364 --> 01:21:02,628
Mei!

653
01:21:05,703 --> 01:21:07,193
Sis!

654
01:21:09,707 --> 01:21:11,766
Sis!

655
01:21:12,109 --> 01:21:13,076
Mei!

656
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:25,283
Mei!

657
01:21:28,626 --> 01:21:29,422
You dummy!

658
01:21:30,027 --> 01:21:31,119
I'm sorry!

659
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:37,231
You wanted to bring that corn to Mother?

660
01:21:49,213 --> 01:21:51,374
You'll take us to the hospital?

661
01:21:53,718 --> 01:21:55,879
Thank you!

662
01:22:04,195 --> 01:22:05,093
I'm sorry.

663
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,529
It's just a little cold

664
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,164
and the hospital
had to go and send a telegram.

665
01:22:12,103 --> 01:22:13,832
The kids are sure to be worried.

666
01:22:14,672 --> 01:22:16,105
Poor kids.

667
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:19,339
Well, the kids
will be relieved when they hear.

668
01:22:19,844 --> 01:22:22,005
Our good times are just put off for a little while,
that's all.

669
01:22:23,514 --> 01:22:24,481
Those kids have to put up with so much.

670
01:22:24,882 --> 01:22:29,751
Satsuki's such a sensitive child,
I feel sorry for her.

671
01:22:31,055 --> 01:22:32,113
You're right.

672
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:38,050
When I get home I plan to really spoil them.

673
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,035
Mother's laughing.

674
01:22:47,605 --> 01:22:48,833
She looks okay.

675
01:22:58,382 --> 01:23:01,180
Ah, I've got to hurry and get well.

676
01:23:09,727 --> 01:23:10,955
Who could it be?

677
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:14,722
What's the matter?

678
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:17,426
Just now, in the pine tree,

679
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:18,794
I thought I saw Mei and Satsuki laughing...

680
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:22,535
It could be.

681
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:23,597
Look!

682
01:23:24,075 --> 01:23:27,476
This is for you! (Mother)

683
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:32,380
Totoro, totoro.

684
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,486
Totoro, totoro.

685
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:50,698
Someone quietly

686
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:58,300
Sow the rice hull in the path

687
01:23:59,677 --> 01:24:05,912
When they grow up,

688
01:24:06,651 --> 01:24:09,779
They turn the secret path

689
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:13,250
Into forest.

690
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:20,563
A wonderful adventure will soon start,

691
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:24,765
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

692
01:24:25,069 --> 01:24:28,334
Totoro, totoro.

693
01:24:28,939 --> 01:24:35,503
They used to live in the forest.

694
01:24:35,846 --> 01:24:39,145
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

695
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:42,818
Totoro, totoro.

696
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:47,117
They only show themselves

697
01:24:47,525 --> 01:24:51,552
In front of kids.

698
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:56,763
What a wonderful meeting.

699
01:24:57,635 --> 01:25:00,695
In rainy days,

700
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:04,005
a fat monster suddenly appear

701
01:25:04,508 --> 01:25:10,140
at the bus stop sign.

702
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:18,880
It is holding an umbrella for her

703
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:25,957
This is the passport to the forest.

704
01:25:26,764 --> 01:25:33,397
Magic door will open for this.

705
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:37,334
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

706
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:40,936
Totoro, totoro.

707
01:25:42,246 --> 01:25:47,582
It lovely appear in the hillock.

708
01:25:48,085 --> 01:25:52,215
Totoro in the next door, totoro,

709
01:25:52,656 --> 01:25:56,023
Totoro, totoro.

710
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,825
When you meet her by luck,

711
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:08,764
Happiness will befall.

712
01:26:13,944 --> 01:26:19,746
~The end~
