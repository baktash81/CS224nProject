2
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:37,519
All aboard!

3
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:38,920
All aboard!

4
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:04,134
- Morning.
- Special one today.

5
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,537
Blimey.

6
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,209
What have you got there?

7
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:17,879
Wouldn't you like to know.

8
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,783
Just arrived, milord.

9
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:57,819
There's one
from Buckingham Palace.

10
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:59,621
Heavens.

11
00:04:59,623 --> 00:05:01,689
But we really need

12
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,725
to cut back until the farms
repay the investment.

13
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,727
And we must make a plan
for the roof.

14
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,761
Well, this won't help us
to economize.

15
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,331
What is it?

16
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,367
The king and queen
are coming to stay.

17
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,268
What?

18
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,071
During their Yorkshire tour?

19
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,739
That's it.
Just for a night.

20
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,607
They'll spend one night
at Downton

21
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:21,643
and then go on to Harewood
for a ball.

22
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:24,112
While they're here,
there's to be a parade

23
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:26,247
of the Yorkshire Hussars
in the village.

24
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:28,617
Is there any chance
Henry might be back?

25
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,050
Well, I doubt it.

26
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:31,653
I'll send a telegram.

27
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:33,220
But there's a motor show
in Chicago

28
00:05:33,222 --> 00:05:34,989
that I know he cannot chuck.

29
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,994
Tom, you're keeping
your enthusiasm under control.

30
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,730
Is this the Irish patriot
making a reappearance?

31
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,264
I know you find my opinions
highly entertaining.

32
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:47,035
I suppose they'll send people
to check that Mrs. Patmore

33
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:49,103
- isn't a Russian spy.
- Mm.

34
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:51,138
Will you tell them
downstairs, Barrow?

35
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,611
- I'll see to Her Ladyship.
- Yes, milord.

36
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,679
A royal luncheon,
a parade and a dinner?

37
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:00,381
I'm going to have to sit down.

38
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:02,816
- Oh, what about Mr. Branson?
- What about him?

39
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:04,653
Well, he's a republican,
isn't he?

40
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,287
Should Mr. Carson look in,

41
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:08,956
no one is to say that word
in front of him.

42
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,826
I agree with Mr. Branson.
I don't like kings, either.

43
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,927
I suppose that makes me
a republican, too.

44
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,833
Are the English allowed to be?

45
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:29,309
<i>Two weeks to get ready? Golly.</i>

46
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,210
It's quite an honor.

47
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:31,946
It is. But if I know

48
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:33,715
anything about royal visits,
we will never stop

49
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,016
changing our clothes.

50
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:37,052
I've just been
on a buying spree,

51
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:38,686
which is good.

52
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:41,021
Madame Handley-Seymour
is making me a ball dress.

53
00:06:41,023 --> 00:06:43,357
- I'll get her to hurry it up.
- Have her send it here.

54
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:46,026
- How are things otherwise?
- Oh, you know.

55
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:49,230
I've got a luncheon for 30
today in aid of the lifeboats.

56
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:50,999
Or is that tomorrow?

57
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,467
Anyway,
it's in aid of something.

58
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,369
Sounds like business as usual.

59
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,838
I'll see you soon, darling.

60
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,141
You know I can bring back

61
00:07:01,143 --> 00:07:03,143
as many vegetables
as we could eat.

62
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:05,146
- Yeah, I like to keep busy.
- Yeah.

63
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,782
How have they taken the news
up at the house?

64
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:09,283
Daisy's singing
"The Marseillaise."

65
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:11,319
So no surprises there.

66
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,021
Oh, what's the matter?

67
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,456
I thought you'd be pleased.

68
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,990
I am pleased.

69
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:19,059
The visit is a great honor.

70
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:22,463
But members of the royal
and imperial household

71
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,499
are coming to Downton
who will have visited

72
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,102
the greatest houses in the land.

73
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:29,136
Blenheim, Chatsworth, Arundel.

74
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:31,405
Does Mr. Barrow know
what he's taking on?

75
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:33,874
Why should it affect you?

76
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,343
You're not in charge anymore.

77
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:37,414
Now, come in for your lunch
and let me get back.

78
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:48,324
All right, sir, here we are.

79
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:53,197
This will do very well.
Thank you.

80
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,518
The Lady Bagshaw, Your Majesty.

81
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,287
Good.

82
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:23,857
We'll go to the 1844 Room
as soon as they're here.

83
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,763
Do sit down.

84
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:30,465
I've just received the plan for
the tour of Yorkshire, ma'am.

85
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,066
Yes. It's just been finalized.

86
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,834
I think we'll enjoy it.

87
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:36,170
I didn't realize we would be
staying at Downton Abbey.

88
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:37,905
Only for a night.

89
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,873
There's to be a parade
and a dinner,

90
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,144
and then we go on
to Princess Mary at Harewood.

91
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,045
I just wondered
if I might, perhaps,

92
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:46,149
go straight to Harewood.

93
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,818
Lord Grantham is my cousin,

94
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,819
and the two families have...

95
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,353
fallen out.

96
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:56,424
Or at least we might
if I were there in person.

97
00:08:56,426 --> 00:08:59,059
And what would cause
this quarrel?

98
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,963
Lord Grantham's mother believes
her son should be my heir.

99
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:05,400
Old Lady Grantham can be
very hard to resist,

100
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,267
as I am well aware.

101
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,170
Exactly, ma'am.

102
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,972
But, surely, they need to know

103
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:12,977
if their hopes
are to be disappointed.

104
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,947
I wish I knew if they like
simple food or fancy.

105
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:21,149
I can't think
they'll want simple food.

106
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,483
With that sort,
don't they like sauces

107
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:26,487
and everything velouté and
frappé and smothered in cream?

108
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,289
"That sort"?
He's the King of England.

109
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,324
There's only one of them
in the world.

110
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:31,959
"That sort," indeed.

111
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,594
Don't plan too much.

112
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:35,563
Not until we know
what's expected.

113
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:38,131
Well, I know what's
expected of me... food.

114
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:41,169
You, too, Daisy. So less
philosophy, more elbow grease.

115
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:43,170
- Is the pudding ready?
- It is.

116
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,405
Oh, Daisy, take the soufflés
out of the oven

117
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:46,875
while I find me specs.

118
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,609
This country needs a shake-up.

119
00:09:48,611 --> 00:09:50,612
Ah, you should run for parliament.

120
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:52,613
Why not?
Lady Astor's done it.

121
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,515
And so an under-cook
from Yorkshire

122
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:56,184
is bound to follow her.

123
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,452
Well, you've got to have
big dreams.

124
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,520
But do you have
big dreams, Andy?

125
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,488
I've not offended you, have I?

126
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,558
- Why do you say that?
- Well, for a start,

127
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,325
you never talk
about the wedding anymore.

128
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,929
We'll get wed when we're
good and ready and not before.

129
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:10,164
But, you see, I am ready.

130
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:13,037
Take those up
before they collapse.

131
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,208
Maud Bagshaw is coming
to Downton?

132
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,410
Yes, as the queen's
lady-in-waiting.

133
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,212
Oh, my goodness.

134
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:26,481
Why so surprised?
Who is she?

135
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:29,119
Well, she's a cousin
of your father's.

136
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:33,288
We'll-we'll discuss it later.

137
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,955
You're not
to make things awkward.

138
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:36,357
How's it all going?

139
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,992
Well, Mary's got it
under control.

140
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:39,626
Hardly. There's so much to do.

141
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:42,429
Who were those men measuring
on the green as we came past?

142
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,966
They're building the dais
for the queen at the parade.

143
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:47,035
- Oh, how exciting.
- Seems rather a waste of money.

144
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,402
Oh, here we go.

145
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:50,505
Isn't that what
the monarchy's for?

146
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,674
To brighten the lives
of the nation

147
00:10:52,676 --> 00:10:54,442
with stateliness and glamour?

148
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:58,378
To quote Tennyson, "Kind hearts
are more than coronets,

149
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,381
And simple faith
than Norman blood."

150
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:04,017
Will you have enough clichés
to get you through the visit?

151
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,055
If not, I'll come to you.

152
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,559
Thank you, Barrow.

153
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:15,262
And, now, you were gonna
tell us about Lady Bagshaw.

154
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,997
Is she a very distant cousin?

155
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,632
No. Her father was
my great uncle.

156
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,734
Then why have I
never heard of her?

157
00:11:20,736 --> 00:11:24,338
Because she chose to cut
herself off from the family.

158
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,342
- Do you know the reason?
- Maybe.

159
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:30,545
See, I believe she means
to cheat your father

160
00:11:30,547 --> 00:11:33,046
of his rightful inheritance.

161
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,515
She has no children.

162
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:36,984
Your father is
her nearest relation.

163
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,187
I won't have her put
on the spot.

164
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,354
You're plotting something.

165
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,991
I see a Machiavellian look
in your eye.

166
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,760
Machiavelli is
frequently underrated.

167
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:48,429
He had many qualities.

168
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,564
So did Caligula,
not all of them charming.

169
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:53,166
What are you up to, Granny?

170
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:58,139
Well, ideally, I would like
Maud to see your father

171
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:00,174
as the son she never had.

172
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:02,577
Will she be the mother
I never had?

173
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,150
Sarcasm is
the lowest form of wit.

174
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:13,521
- Oh. Hello.
- Mr. Molesley.

175
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:15,390
It's very late for you
to be out.

176
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,058
Is it true?

177
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,492
Is what true, Mr. Molesley?

178
00:12:18,494 --> 00:12:20,227
Mr. Bakewell said
that you'd warned him

179
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,195
that there was to be
a royal visit.

180
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:25,065
Well, now I know who not
to trust with a secret.

181
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:28,236
That we should deserve
such honor.

182
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:29,737
Not you, too.
I am disappointed.

183
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:31,472
- Ignore her.
- I wonder, do you think

184
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,540
I might be allowed
to slip on my livery again?

185
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,809
Would the school let you?

186
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,644
Oh, they'll give me time
for this, I promise.

187
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,045
Let's wait
till we know our orders.

188
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:40,048
What about it, Mr. Barrow?

189
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,683
Will you let me wait upon
my king and queen?

190
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:44,452
Uh, well...

191
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,286
That's us.

192
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:48,055
Good night, Mr. Molesley.

193
00:12:48,057 --> 00:12:50,157
When we're done,
shall I fetch Johnny

194
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,160
- or will you?
- I can fetch him.

195
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,529
How exciting.

196
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:56,396
- Thank you.
- They're all mental.

197
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,833
All this fuss for a man
and woman we don't even know.

198
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,734
No, never mind that.
I wanted to tell you.

199
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,471
I've had some ideas about what
to serve at your wedding.

200
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:05,409
Stop going on about my wedding.

201
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,453
<i>We've only a few days left,</i>

202
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,122
<i>so I spoke to Her Ladyship,
and she's agreed</i>

203
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:23,524
<i>our normal rules
should be suspended.</i>

204
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:27,328
<i>We won't clean a room
if a family member is using it,</i>

205
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,397
<i>but, otherwise,
all restrictions are lifted.</i>

206
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,568
<i>No detail should be left
undone, however small.</i>

207
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,736
I want every surface
in this house

208
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:38,872
to gleam and sparkle
by Thursday.

209
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:40,674
Blimey.

210
00:13:40,676 --> 00:13:42,477
Can I have your attention,
please?

211
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,277
Uh, for this afternoon,

212
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,880
Their Majesties' butler,
Mr. Wilson,

213
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:47,747
will be coming over
from Raby Castle

214
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:49,750
with a lady's maid and a valet.

215
00:13:49,752 --> 00:13:51,452
To give us our instructions?

216
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:53,788
With the royal servants,
are we to wait on them?

217
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,857
That is what
will be made clear.

218
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,593
I won't be waiting
on any valets and lady's maids,

219
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,828
thank you very much.

220
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,795
Before we get hot under the
collar, let's just wait and see

221
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:03,164
- what they have to say.
- Amen.

222
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,280
Mr. Branson.

223
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,372
Can I help you, sir?

224
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:46,741
It's really you I came to see.

225
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:49,276
- Oh. Well, how can I help you, Mister...?
- Chetwode.

226
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:50,911
Major Chetwode.

227
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:53,747
Am I right you're Mr. Branson,
Lord Grantham's son-in-law?

228
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:55,583
- I am.
- Oh.

229
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,952
The, uh... the papers tell me
the king and queen

230
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:00,820
will be staying at Downton Abbey
during their tour of Yorkshire.

231
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:02,823
Well, if it's in the papers,
it must be true.

232
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,559
Yes. Great honor.

233
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:06,626
Although, as an Irishman,
you may feel differently.

234
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:09,362
I know when my parents-in-law
have been paid a compliment.

235
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:11,431
Well, there's to be
a military parade, I gather.

236
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,333
How do you...
how do you feel about that?

237
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:15,670
What do you mean, how do I feel?

238
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,405
Only you didn't say
whether you support them,

239
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,308
the... king and queen.

240
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,276
I support Lord Grantham.

241
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,349
Very neat.

242
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,487
Until we meet again,
Mr. Branson.

243
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,563
Ah, Barrow.
They said you'd be in here.

244
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,598
Heavens. We can still
put on quite a show

245
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,367
when we need to,
I'm glad to see.

246
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:48,236
Has it all been cleaned?

247
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,503
More or less everything's been
done to a basic level, milady.

248
00:15:50,505 --> 00:15:52,540
But we haven't done
the final buffing-up.

249
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:53,907
Why not?

250
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,544
I was waiting
for Their Majesties' butler.

251
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:59,646
I thought I'd ask his advice
on what to use on the table.

252
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:01,515
Really?

253
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:04,618
Can't we decide what we lay
on our own dining table?

254
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:09,457
Front doorbell, Mr. Barrow.

255
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:10,690
Please, go.

256
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:12,395
Milady.

257
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,837
Greetings, Mr. Wilson.

258
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,538
Welcome to Downton Abbey.

259
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:37,720
Uh, this way, Mr. Wilson.

260
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,632
The royal butler's
terribly scary.

261
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:55,402
Barrow looked like a rabbit
in front of a cobra.

262
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,070
Oh, dear.
Should I go down?

263
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:58,506
They know what they're doing.

264
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:00,775
Do they?
They're hideously behind.

265
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:03,410
There's a mark on the Blue Room
carpet we can't shift.

266
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,413
I have no chairs for the parade.

267
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,981
And we haven't even decided
on the footmen.

268
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,950
I'm going to have another cup,
if no one's coming up to serve.

269
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:11,685
This is nice.

270
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:14,088
Princess Mary wants us
for tea tomorrow at Harewood.

271
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,755
Ugh, I've got so much to do.

272
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,457
I wonder if that means
the young couple

273
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,693
have taken over the big house.

274
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:20,027
They're hardly
"the young couple."

275
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:21,662
Well, he isn't, anyway.

276
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,998
She always seems
quite shy to me.

277
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,398
A shy royal?

278
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,533
Is that an oxymoron?

279
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:27,770
Anyway, we're going.

280
00:17:28,937 --> 00:17:30,604
Right.

281
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:33,074
I will return to Raby Castle
and come back to Downton

282
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:35,608
in advance of Their Majesties
on Thursday.

283
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,877
But His Majesty's valet,
Mr. Ellis,

284
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:39,547
and Her Majesty's dresser,
Miss Lawton,

285
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,348
will stay on,
if that is convenient.

286
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,883
Or they can put up
in the village.

287
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:44,984
No, we'll find them rooms.

288
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,587
Then Monsieur Courbet,
the chef...

289
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:47,821
E-Excuse me.

290
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:50,691
- Mr. Courbet, the chef?
- That's right.

291
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:52,960
We'd be very grateful if you
could make the kitchens ready.

292
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:54,627
So, what should I order?

293
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:56,364
Nothing.
He will bring it all.

294
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,566
And we don't cook any
of the food?

295
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,568
Um, cook for the servants.

296
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,669
Monsieur Courbet
won't have time for that.

297
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:04,003
Oh, I see.

298
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:05,940
That is something
to look forward to.

299
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:07,540
Calm yourself, Mrs. Patmore.

300
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,409
If it's the way
these things are done...

301
00:18:09,411 --> 00:18:11,878
Mrs. Webb
and four footmen will arrive

302
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,446
with Monsieur Courbet
the day before.

303
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:14,447
Who is this...

304
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,149
Mrs. Webb, is it?

305
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:17,784
She is the housekeeper.

306
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:20,453
She will also bring two maids
with her.

307
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:21,856
The housekeeper?

308
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,390
While Their Majesties are here.

309
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,457
And the maids?

310
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,159
They will make the beds,

311
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:28,796
clean the bathrooms...
that sort of thing.

312
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:30,664
I see.

313
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:34,734
So, my maids and I will not be
involved in the preparations?

314
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:37,972
You mean, during the stay,
you'll be the butler, and...

315
00:18:37,974 --> 00:18:40,040
Excuse me.
I am not a butler.

316
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,742
I am the king's
Page of the Backstairs.

317
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:47,647
So, our staff has nothing to do?

318
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,617
I'm sure they can be useful.

319
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,886
But how can they eat
and get dressed at Raby Castle

320
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:55,688
if the chef and the valet
and the maid are all here?

321
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,124
We have two of each.

322
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,826
The principal valet
and the principal dresser

323
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:00,627
will arrive in advance
of Their Majesties,

324
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:03,129
who bring an equerry,
a lady-in-waiting,

325
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:05,899
two detectives
and two chauffeurs.

326
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,469
The other chef goes from Raby
to Harewood.

327
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:12,071
Four footmen go with him,
and the other four come here.

328
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,976
Do you all understand me?

329
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,681
You can hardly heckle
Lady Bagshaw

330
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:22,148
in front of the queen.

331
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,585
Well, I'm just trying
to prevent a crime.

332
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:26,953
- Who says it's a crime?
- I do.

333
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:29,123
Oh, and you're an expert
in the matter?

334
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,791
I am an expert in every matter.

335
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,661
You must have some idea

336
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:35,796
why she doesn't want Robert
as her heir.

337
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:37,130
I have none.

338
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,133
He is her closest relative.

339
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,136
The family have held Brompton
for three centuries.

340
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:44,672
But she wants to give it to who?

341
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:45,806
Charity?

342
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:47,140
The dogs' home?

343
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:48,576
Well, I would have thought

344
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,211
the family had enough
to worry about.

345
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:51,878
That's not the point.

346
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,213
Well, very well.

347
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,782
We must try
and discover her reasons.

348
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:58,519
Well, what possible reasons
can there be?

349
00:19:58,521 --> 00:20:02,223
Well, that's what I intend
to find out.

350
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:15,269
- Carson.
- Oh, milady.

351
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:17,771
Please come in.

352
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:19,039
This is an honor.

353
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,776
I don't want to be a nuisance,
but I need your help, Carson.

354
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,845
Barrow just isn't up
to the task.

355
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,580
- Milady?
- He won't clean the silver.

356
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:29,716
- Or he won't let Andrew clean it.
- What?

357
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:31,784
He says the page of the...
thingummy

358
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:34,722
- will choose which pieces to use.
- I see.

359
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,825
The truth is,
he's in a sort of trance.

360
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,225
Won't you help me?

361
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:40,927
I feel I'm pushing
a rock uphill.

362
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,864
I'll be there in the morning,
milady. Don't you worry.

363
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,666
You're a treasure, Carson.
That's all there is to say.

364
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:48,237
I'll see myself out.

365
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:54,241
- You could never refuse her anything.
- Mm.

366
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,210
And what about Mr. Barrow?

367
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:58,578
Mr. Barrow can like it
or lump it.

368
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,082
Then I'm afraid he'll lump it.

369
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:04,952
We have supper
after the upstairs dinner,

370
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:06,252
so you've plenty of time.

371
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:08,289
Thanks.

372
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,191
How does it work
with two valets?

373
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,092
Well, I prepare
His Majesty's clothes

374
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:14,328
and uniforms for Downton.

375
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,796
Then, when Mr. Miller arrives,

376
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:17,598
I get the stuff
for Harewood ready.

377
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,867
Then I head back to London
and prepare for their return.

378
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:23,136
- It all overlaps.
- So, Mr. Miller's the one

379
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,771
who actually dresses the king?

380
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,874
Unless he's ill. Then it's me.

381
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:28,908
Is he often ill?

382
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,714
No.

383
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:36,116
I think it's rubbish.
They impose, they demand,

384
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:38,851
and now we're to be made
nothing in our own house.

385
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:41,155
It's very disappointing,
I won't deny it.

386
00:21:41,157 --> 00:21:42,889
This water's not too hot.

387
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:44,191
Have they all been having baths?

388
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:46,225
How should I know?

389
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:49,797
Mr. Barrow, don't you think you
should speak to His Lordship?

390
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,699
- About what?
- Well, it's not right, surely,

391
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,232
for us to be humiliated
in this way.

392
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:54,801
Well, what could he do about it?

393
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:56,169
Is the staff
always ridden over roughshod

394
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,805
whenever royalty come to stay?

395
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:59,706
Why do they bring
so many servants with them?

396
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,274
Maybe it's because they go
from house to house

397
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:02,842
around the county
and they need to know

398
00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:04,345
things are done
the way they like.

399
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:06,312
- As if we couldn't manage that.
- We're not footballs,

400
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,781
Mr. Bates,
and we don't deserve a kicking.

401
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:21,995
<i>But what are we</i>

402
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:24,932
to say to Barrow? After all,
he's done nothing wrong.

403
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:27,300
He's done nothing at all.
That's the problem.

404
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:29,071
But it feels very unfair.

405
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:31,371
Oh, I see.

406
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,905
- So it's now.
- I've sent down

407
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:34,942
for Mr. Barrow to join us,
milord.

408
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,779
You wanted to see me, milord?

409
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:40,280
Mr. Carson!

410
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:42,182
What brings you here?

411
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:44,751
Well, this is the thing.

412
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,686
Carson is going to move
back into the house

413
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:47,923
for the royal visit.

414
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,657
What?

415
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:52,393
You are coming back here
as butler

416
00:22:52,395 --> 00:22:53,926
when I am the butler here?

417
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:56,129
Yes, uh, that is...

418
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:58,665
Can I ask how long
this has been planned, milord?

419
00:22:58,667 --> 00:22:59,966
Well, I wouldn't say
it's been exactly planned.

420
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:01,167
Because I don't quite understand

421
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:02,802
where it leaves me.

422
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:04,238
- Well, you can be a sort of...
- With your permission,

423
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,174
I'd prefer not to be
a "sort of" anything, milord.

424
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:09,042
I will surrender my position

425
00:23:09,044 --> 00:23:11,878
for the duration of the visit,
if I must,

426
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,914
and serve you again
when Their Majesties

427
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,183
have gone, if you so wish.

428
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,051
- Please don't think that...
- By the way,

429
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:21,187
the boiler's playing up,
and there's no hot water.

430
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:23,022
God, that's all we need.

431
00:23:23,024 --> 00:23:24,192
Now, Barrow...

432
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:28,361
Not to worry. The plumber
will soon have it mended,

433
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:30,263
milady,
and we'll bring water jugs

434
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:32,265
up to the bedrooms tonight
and in the morning.

435
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,901
It can't be that hard.

436
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:35,802
We did it for 300 years.

437
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:37,206
Thank you, Carson.

438
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,707
Well, that went well.

439
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:42,076
Will you sack him?

440
00:23:42,078 --> 00:23:45,244
No. As a matter of fact,
I was quite interested.

441
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:48,214
I never thought of him
as a man of principle before.

442
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:53,921
I'll have to tell him

443
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:56,022
I'm only ordering
for the servants' hall.

444
00:23:56,024 --> 00:23:57,960
I'm afraid
I've got his hopes up.

445
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:00,493
Aha!

446
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:02,495
Oh, speak of the devil.

447
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:04,998
Come in, come in. I was
just saying you'll be wanting

448
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,733
- to finalize the order.
- Were you, indeed?

449
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:08,101
Honestly, no one in the village

450
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:09,736
- can talk about anything else.
- Of course.

451
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:10,937
Oh, now, I know it's

452
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,940
a bit of a liberty,
but I've made a list

453
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,441
of all the ingredients
of your favorite dishes.

454
00:24:14,443 --> 00:24:16,443
I know them well enough
after all these years.

455
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:18,779
But some things
will have to be brought in,

456
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:20,180
so we should really
get on with it.

457
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:21,380
Oh, well, I appreciate

458
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:22,849
everything you've done,
Mr. Bakewell...

459
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:26,886
My heart is fit to burst,

460
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:28,422
I don't mind telling you.

461
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,790
I shall have fed
the king-emperor

462
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:33,226
from my own shop.

463
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:35,428
If only my father were alive.

464
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,197
He'd be so proud of me.
He would.

465
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:41,367
Well, I-I'm sure he'd be proud
of you anyway, Mr. Bakewell.

466
00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:43,436
Oh, no, no, not like this, no.

467
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:46,272
This is the peak of my career.

468
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:49,475
Well, the peak
of my life, really.

469
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:51,544
Everyone's so jealous.

470
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:53,780
Oh, now, I've put ticks

471
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:55,449
next to the ones
I think you'll go for.

472
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:57,184
- Now, the thing is...
- I'm guessing the luncheon

473
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,551
will be for around a dozen.

474
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,287
Of course,
the dinner will be larger.

475
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,021
Let's say 30 or thereabouts?

476
00:25:02,023 --> 00:25:03,857
You'll correct me if I'm wrong.

477
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,858
- Well, you see...
- You're not wrong, Mr. Bakewell.

478
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,028
But we'll say
if the numbers change.

479
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,296
The pavlova's not realistic.

480
00:25:09,298 --> 00:25:10,830
We'd be safer
with a charlotte russe.

481
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,331
We can do most
of the work before.

482
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,001
And I shall be serving!

483
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:15,569
Think of that!

484
00:25:15,571 --> 00:25:18,305
♪ I've danced with a man
who's danced with a girl ♪

485
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:20,072
♪ Who's danced
with the Prince of Wales ♪

486
00:25:20,074 --> 00:25:21,942
- ♪ I'm crazy with excitement ♪
- No. Stop it, Mr. Molesley.

487
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,944
♪ Completely off the rails. ♪

488
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:27,947
All of my suppliers
are so excited.

489
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:29,950
Oh, Mrs. Patmore,

490
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:31,518
I shall never be able

491
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,221
to thank you enough,
not if I live to be 100.

492
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,126
I feel like a liar.

493
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:40,527
I should go back.

494
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:42,863
And lower yourself
to a kitchen skivvy

495
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:44,364
in the eyes of the village?

496
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,500
Never mind ruining
Mr. Bakewell's year.

497
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:48,467
You'll do no such thing.

498
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:02,616
No maid. No valet.

499
00:26:02,618 --> 00:26:04,917
No nanny, even.

500
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,453
It's 1927.

501
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:07,954
We're modern folk.

502
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,123
Nanny will take care
of Marigold.

503
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,392
And Anna can look after you.

504
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:14,461
Really? Can she?

505
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:16,262
Of course.

506
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:19,031
Just like the old days.
Granny's here, and Isobel,

507
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:21,467
and we're paying a call this
afternoon on Princess Mary.

508
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:23,502
Oh. Has my new ball dress
arrived?

509
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:25,239
Not yet, but it will.

510
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,143
Hello, Mary.

511
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:30,277
How are you?

512
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:32,546
How long have you worked
for Her Majesty, Miss Lawton?

513
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:34,313
- Six years.
- How interesting.

514
00:26:34,315 --> 00:26:36,983
I expect you're a skilled
needlewoman for that job.

515
00:26:36,985 --> 00:26:38,351
Well, I've had no complaints.

516
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:40,988
I trained under Madame Lucile.

517
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,190
Her Majesty wanted
a professional dressmaker.

518
00:26:43,192 --> 00:26:45,024
And they found you?

519
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,062
My reputation found me.

520
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:52,199
Oh.

521
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:54,001
Come on, you two.
It's nearly 3:00.

522
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:55,935
We ought to get ready.

523
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:57,436
- Will the princess be at the parade?
- Thank you.

524
00:26:57,438 --> 00:26:59,172
- They both will.
- What time are they expecting us?

525
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:01,474
I always find her rather sad,
Princess Mary.

526
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:03,242
Well, she is royal.

527
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:06,178
Royal women are not meant
to grin like Cheshire cats.

528
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,014
Well, they don't have
to look miserable.

529
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:09,249
Well, to you,
she looks miserable.

530
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,018
To me, she looks dignified.

531
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,618
Doesn't that say it all?

532
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,155
How comforting
to see you here, Carson.

533
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:18,492
What prompted you to take up
the flaming sword again?

534
00:27:18,494 --> 00:27:21,360
I felt I should go where I
could do the most good, milady.

535
00:27:21,362 --> 00:27:23,396
Wise words for all of us.

536
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,924
Her Royal Highness is here.

537
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:53,592
The Marchioness of Hexham,

538
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:55,529
the Countess of Grantham,

539
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,530
the Lady Mary Talbot.

540
00:27:57,532 --> 00:28:00,166
Your Royal Highness.

541
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:02,668
Please, sit down, Lady Grantham.

542
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,272
I suppose you're in turmoil
because of my parents' visit.

543
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:07,574
I do sympathize.

544
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,576
We don't need
to explain it to you.

545
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:11,677
Just don't paint anything.

546
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,013
They're sick
of the smell of new paint.

547
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:16,316
I hope it's not too late.

548
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:18,050
Are you living here now, ma'am?

549
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,419
No. No, we're still
at Goldsborough.

550
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,688
But Lord Harewood's
not well, so...

551
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,258
we've come to run the visit and the ball.

552
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:28,595
Oh, hello.

553
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,496
Hello, my darlings.

554
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:33,165
How have you been?

555
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,368
Have you been having
a lovely day? Hmm?

556
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,677
Yes?

557
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:45,981
This is your lucky day.

558
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:49,715
I'm the new plumber,
Tony Sellick.

559
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:51,617
Oh, yes. Right.

560
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:53,956
Well, I'd better show you
where the boiler is.

561
00:28:55,623 --> 00:28:57,390
Where are you off to?

562
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:59,592
This is Mr. Sellick,
the plumber.

563
00:28:59,594 --> 00:29:01,228
I'm taking him
to the boiler house.

564
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,230
- I'll do it.
- No, you're all right.

565
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:05,065
Just tell Mrs. Patmore
where I am.

566
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,605
Please bring the boys on Thursday.

567
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:14,010
Oh, how lovely.

568
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:16,409
Why are the children in here?

569
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:19,146
We just got back,
and they wanted to...

570
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,513
They're not allowed in
the drawing room before 6:00.

571
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:23,082
- I know, milord. But they...
- Take them upstairs.

572
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:24,483
And don't bring them
down again tonight.

573
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:26,353
- Yes, milord.
- But they were only...

574
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:27,587
Thank you, Nanny.

575
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:30,223
- Please, Nanny?
- No, we're going.

576
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,697
You remember Lady Grantham
and her daughters?

577
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:40,166
Lady Grantham.

578
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:42,269
They want us to bring the boys
to the parade.

579
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:44,236
No. They'd only cause a ruckus.

580
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:45,739
We were hoping
you would both stay

581
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,674
for dinner that night,
Lord Lascelles.

582
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,145
No, I'm afraid not.

583
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:51,677
Well...

584
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,680
I'll leave you to it.

585
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,661
Well, I suppose
I better let you get started,

586
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:10,430
- so I'll be on me way.
- Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

587
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,299
You don't look as if you need me
to wish you luck, Mr. Sellick.

588
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:14,434
Or anyone else, for that matter.

589
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:16,536
You don't know what I need.

590
00:30:16,538 --> 00:30:19,172
And I don't intend to find out.

591
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:27,513
Do we need
to cut the grass again?

592
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:28,714
They're doing it
tomorrow morning.

593
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:31,318
Hello, Mr. Branson. Ah.

594
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,853
Getting ready
for Their Majesties, I see.

595
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:34,753
- That's right. This is Lord Hexham.
- Ah.

596
00:30:34,755 --> 00:30:36,623
May I present Major Chetwode.

597
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,358
- Are you here for the parade?
- I am. I'm staying at the pub.

598
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,229
- Milord?
- Excuse me.

599
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,498
Or are you here
to keep an eye on me?

600
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,501
I was rather hoping you'd be
my guide for the ceremony.

601
00:30:47,503 --> 00:30:49,435
Would you like a drink?

602
00:30:49,437 --> 00:30:51,271
I'll join you in a minute.

603
00:30:51,273 --> 00:30:52,542
Well, well done.

604
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:58,310
- Who's he?
- I don't really know.

605
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:00,847
Army, perhaps.
Or maybe a civil servant.

606
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:02,348
But I'll drink with him

607
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,884
and try and put his mind
at rest.

608
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,286
What does he want?

609
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:09,522
Maybe to make sure I'm a leopard
who <i>has</i> changed his spots.

610
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,530
<i>What about you, milady?</i>

611
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:17,864
- Is everything ready?
- No.

612
00:31:17,866 --> 00:31:19,633
And my heart is pounding.

613
00:31:19,635 --> 00:31:21,768
By the way,
have you seen the silver box

614
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,271
from the table by the fire
in the drawing room?

615
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:26,606
My grandmother used to keep
playing cards in it.

616
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,174
I know the one.

617
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:30,210
- Is it missing?
- Yes.

618
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:33,413
And so is the little cupid
from the mantelshelf.

619
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:35,714
Oh, they must have been taken
downstairs for cleaning.

620
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:38,184
I was just coming to you,
milady.

621
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:39,685
Oh, don't worry. I'm fine.

622
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,254
- If that's all, milady?
- I suppose.

623
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,822
Can you manage the jug
and basin?

624
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:45,258
Or are they too heavy?

625
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,893
No, no, I can do it.

626
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,861
Oh, how's the boiler?

627
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:51,133
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

628
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:58,905
Bertie was with Tom earlier.

629
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:02,274
You don't think Tom
would ever try to make trouble?

630
00:32:02,276 --> 00:32:04,444
Why do you say that?

631
00:32:04,446 --> 00:32:06,213
Well, Bertie says
there's some army type

632
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,681
who has him under surveillance.

633
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,782
Tom likes to shock, that's all.

634
00:32:09,784 --> 00:32:12,685
He'd never be disloyal
to this family. Never.

635
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,654
Shall we go down?

636
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,989
Yes, let's.

637
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:17,557
<i>So, I said to her,</i>

638
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:19,425
"Listen, lady,
there's a little one here

639
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:20,926
- who still needs turning."
- Oh!

640
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:22,395
Careful. Mr. Sellick,

641
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:23,696
you'll make Daisy blush.

642
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,432
Takes more than that
to make me blush.

643
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:27,434
- Now, get that down you.
- You deserve that.

644
00:32:27,436 --> 00:32:29,636
- It's very late.
- Well, I've got to get it done.

645
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:30,869
And I don't mind long hours.

646
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,771
I, uh, mean to build
me own business,

647
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:35,008
and you can't do that
working 9:00 to 5:00.

648
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,509
These water jugs
nearly killed me.

649
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:38,310
How did we manage
in the old days?

650
00:32:38,312 --> 00:32:40,480
Well, maybe people
were tougher then.

651
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:41,815
Maybe they expected less
from life.

652
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,282
Well, I expect a lot from life.

653
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:44,783
So do I.
And I mean to have it, too.

654
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:46,886
Are you still here?

655
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:49,688
Mr. Sellick's been working hard
for hours

656
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,956
for our benefit, Andy.

657
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:52,591
Then it's time he went home.

658
00:32:52,593 --> 00:32:53,993
Is the savory ready?

659
00:32:53,995 --> 00:32:55,962
Take this.

660
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:59,801
Mmm.

661
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:04,838
He's right. The new pump
should arrive around 9:00.

662
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,307
- I'll be here.
- So will we.

663
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:08,808
Ta-ra.

664
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,885
That was Mama. She's in London.

665
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:21,387
- She's staying with Rosamund.
- She can't be.

666
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:23,656
She was here for lunch.
She didn't say anything.

667
00:33:23,658 --> 00:33:25,724
She went up this afternoon.
She'll be back tomorrow,

668
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:27,594
so I've asked her
to come for tea.

669
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:30,030
You must persuade her
to leave Maud Bagshaw alone.

670
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:31,630
I don't believe even Mama

671
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:33,666
will pick a quarrel
in front of the king.

672
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,335
I wonder if he can come early.

673
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,838
Are you excited?

674
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,709
I am a bit. Are you?

675
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,676
Would it be common to admit it?

676
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,412
Not to an American.

677
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,829
Here we go, Mr. Carson.

678
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,768
Leave this to me.

679
00:34:42,404 --> 00:34:44,103
I am Monsieur Courbet.

680
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:46,072
And this is Mrs. Webb,
the housekeeper.

681
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:48,074
Ah. Follow that path,

682
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:50,509
and it'll take you
into the kitchen courtyard.

683
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:53,445
I said, I am Monsieur Courbet,

684
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:55,884
chef to Their Majesties.

685
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:01,054
Well done, Charlie.

686
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,725
Always start
as you mean to go on.

687
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,395
This way, gentlemen.

688
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:13,866
- Miss Lawton?
- I was just looking round.

689
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:15,902
It's a beautiful house.

690
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:18,570
You've seen many that are finer.

691
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:20,005
That's what I came for.

692
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:23,409
But we shouldn't be in here,
really.

693
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,880
Prepare for your
battle with the barbarians.

694
00:35:27,882 --> 00:35:29,114
Oh!

695
00:35:29,116 --> 00:35:31,150
You. Uh, where can I put this?

696
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,619
Don't tempt me.

697
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:34,119
We've cleared some space
in the scullery.

698
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,521
And that cupboard.

699
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,123
What a lot of fuss over nothing.

700
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,726
Well, where's our order
from Mr. Bakewell?

701
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:42,061
Follow me.

702
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,032
Well, how did you manage it?

703
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:49,936
A gardener helped me carry
everything in, so no one saw.

704
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:52,471
I suppose you could sell the lot

705
00:35:52,473 --> 00:35:54,072
and use the money
to pay Mr. Bakewell.

706
00:35:54,074 --> 00:35:56,009
Don't worry.
They can eat it gradual

707
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,110
when the visit's over.

708
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:05,617
Ah! It's done, Mrs. Patmore.

709
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:07,219
The new pump's installed.

710
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:08,755
Hail the conquering hero.

711
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:10,857
It's Mrs. Hughes
you should be telling.

712
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,491
Or Mr. Carson. Not them.

713
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,126
It's all right, Mr. Sellick.

714
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:15,829
We'll see the news
gets through. Thanks.

715
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,831
I would not feed it to my dog!

716
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,898
But I don't need
your help, Mrs. Hughes.

717
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,601
I just want to know where
Their Majesties are sleeping

718
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:24,237
so Miss Stinson
can prepare the rooms.

719
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:26,072
Then I will show you, Mrs. Webb,

720
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:27,940
because, without my help,

721
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:30,944
you will not find them.

722
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:32,244
Is it always like this?

723
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:34,480
A royal visit is like a swan
on a lake.

724
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:37,650
Grace and serenity above,
demented kicking down below.

725
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,117
I wish I could get away.

726
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,020
I've got tomorrow night off
when Mr. Miller arrives.

727
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:42,221
Told my mum I'd look in.

728
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:43,956
Why don't you come to York
with me?

729
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:45,692
- We could have a drink.
- You should go.

730
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:47,826
- You're not on duty.
- That settles it, then.

731
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:50,063
I'll come find you
when I'm released.

732
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:51,730
We can borrow a car.

733
00:36:51,732 --> 00:36:54,233
Mrs. Webb,
I am the housekeeper here.

734
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:56,134
You are not housekeeper
so long as

735
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:57,737
His Majesty is under this roof.

736
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:00,639
Yes, but he's not here yet,
is he?

737
00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:11,518
It's like living in a factory.

738
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,985
It reminds me of our days

739
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:14,987
as a convalescent home
during the war.

740
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:18,224
I enjoyed that, although
I always feel guilty saying so.

741
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:19,992
Where's Tom?

742
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:21,860
- Daddy's in the village.
- Again?

743
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:24,596
- What's he playing at?
- Oh, I saw Tom

744
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:27,166
looking very stern
as I came up the drive.

745
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,134
I hope he's not building a bomb.

746
00:37:29,136 --> 00:37:31,070
Many a true word
is spoken in jest.

747
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:33,540
We think he's being tailed
by Special Branch.

748
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,840
Nonsense.

749
00:37:34,842 --> 00:37:37,210
- Mama, how was London?
- Oh, fine. Fine.

750
00:37:37,212 --> 00:37:39,078
What were you there for?

751
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,780
- Oh, various things.
- But you hate London.

752
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:43,750
Whoever told you that?

753
00:37:43,752 --> 00:37:45,784
Now, when do you want me
tomorrow?

754
00:37:45,786 --> 00:37:46,886
12:00 at the latest.

755
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,688
They arrive at half past.

756
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,991
But, Mama, you must promise
not to attack Maud Bagshaw.

757
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:53,659
Well, I can't ignore her.

758
00:37:53,661 --> 00:37:55,594
- She is my cousin.
- Exactly.

759
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,697
Greet her as a cousin,
and leave it at that.

760
00:37:57,699 --> 00:37:59,998
- I'll think about it.
- But even if she has

761
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,235
left everything to an outsider,
what could we do?

762
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:05,003
Challenge the will.

763
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:06,139
On what basis?

764
00:38:06,141 --> 00:38:07,974
Undue influence.

765
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:10,108
But how could you know that?
And how would you prove it?

766
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,643
We'd find a friendly judge.

767
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:13,279
Friendly or corrupt?

768
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:15,148
Whichever does the trick.

769
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,882
Are you here

770
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,284
for dinner, Mama?
It's a buffet.

771
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:20,619
- Well, I'm not changed.
- We won't change,

772
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,288
either, so you just need
to take off your hat.

773
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,757
You talk as if that were easy.

774
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:26,092
Where's the paper knife,

775
00:38:26,094 --> 00:38:28,563
the silver one
with my regimental crest?

776
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:33,299
They won't help tonight,
apparently.

777
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:35,768
They won't lift a finger.

778
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,072
But then, my food
is only fit for servants.

779
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:40,739
Well, at least your young hero

780
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:42,175
seems to have sorted out
the water.

781
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,875
He's not my hero.

782
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:45,777
Yes.
Why did you call him that?

783
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:47,246
Oh, it was just a joke.

784
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:50,152
- But why's it funny?
- Oh, Andy, leave it.

785
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:13,306
- But this is a rabbit hutch.
- Don't look at me,

786
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:14,940
Mr. Courbet. You couldn't
swing a cat in my room.

787
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:17,043
Gentlemen, please.
I'm sure you'll find...

788
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,777
Out of my way.

789
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:22,114
I will have a bath,
and then I will decide.

790
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:23,983
Perhaps I will find a hotel.

791
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:26,386
Where can we eat?
Somewhere apart?

792
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:28,387
Uh, why not
in the servants' hall?

793
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,188
We never eat
with the resident staff.

794
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,824
- Excuse me.
- The water's cold.

795
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:32,824
What's happening?

796
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:34,192
Th-This is impossible.

797
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:35,994
We can't stay here
with no hot water.

798
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,730
- Are you crazy?
- But the boiler was fixed today.

799
00:39:37,732 --> 00:39:39,766
It was hot an hour ago.

800
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:41,867
Well, it's cold now.

801
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:43,802
Why are you
here again, Mr. Carson?

802
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:45,971
So you could keep control
when I would fail?

803
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:47,273
Was that it? I-I forget.

804
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:48,741
You... Mr. Barrow,
would you mind?

805
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:51,978
I'm not on duty, Mr. Carson.
You are.

806
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,849
Sorry, sir.

807
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:09,962
What do you want?

808
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:11,998
Since you are in my room,
sitting at my desk,

809
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
it is for me to ask
what you want.

810
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:15,300
Nothing from you.

811
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:17,036
I would remind you that I have

812
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:19,304
been in charge of Downton
for many years.

813
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:21,074
Mr. Carson,
you are a retired servant

814
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:22,308
in a minor provincial house,

815
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,277
serving an
undistinguished family.

816
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:26,712
Your history
is of no interest to me.

817
00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:29,882
Now, if you will excuse me.

818
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:32,284
So, what would you
like me to do?

819
00:40:32,286 --> 00:40:34,820
I would like you to find
a good book

820
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:36,489
and read it until we leave.

821
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:39,862
Mr. Carson, you'd better come
and see this.

822
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:47,733
It's well and truly damaged.

823
00:40:47,735 --> 00:40:49,802
- Can you mend it in time?
- Oh, yeah.

824
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:51,036
But somebody should tell them

825
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:52,804
someone wanted to wreck
the royal visit.

826
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:55,407
They ought to know.

827
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,375
- Has the dress arrived?
- Not yet.

828
00:40:57,377 --> 00:40:59,811
- What am I going to wear?
- Carson, what is it?

829
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:02,949
Uh, some folding chairs...
well, a great many chairs

830
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:04,183
have been delivered, milady.

831
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,518
They're at the back door.

832
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,918
Anna thought
you should be told at once.

833
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,855
She's right.
They're for the parade,

834
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,355
and we'll have
to set them out tonight.

835
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:12,157
There'll be no time tomorrow.

836
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,527
The villagers will start
arriving from 9:00 onwards.

837
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:16,462
I'm not sure fate
is on our side.

838
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:17,829
Poor little Mary.

839
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:20,766
Have we let her
take on too much?

840
00:41:20,768 --> 00:41:22,134
Yes, you're right.
Come on.

841
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:23,369
We should lend her a hand.

842
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,438
Well, you can't go out in this.

843
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,405
Of course we can.
Good night, Mama.

844
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:30,442
Remember to pray for us,
mainly for better weather.

845
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:31,846
I'll put in a word.

846
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:35,248
Of course, little Mary could

847
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,849
hammer in a tent peg
with her teeth.

848
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:39,420
I wonder who she got that from.

849
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:43,855
You know, I'm always surprised
when you praise me.

850
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:46,793
I'm surprised to hear
that I have.

851
00:41:49,496 --> 00:41:52,063
As if things aren't bad enough
without a thunderstorm.

852
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:54,099
We'll manage.
I've roped in Mr. Molesley,

853
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:55,567
and Andy's gone for the truck.

854
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:57,436
But, well, Mr. Bates can't help.

855
00:41:57,438 --> 00:41:59,271
And Mr. Barrow has vanished.

856
00:41:59,273 --> 00:42:01,873
Ditto. Lord Hexham's
out looking for Mr. Branson.

857
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,809
We'll have to do our best
without them.

858
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:05,177
You're not going yourself?

859
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,413
Well, how else will they know
what to do?

860
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:08,980
Then I'll fetch our coats.

861
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:10,315
Well, you don't have to come.

862
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:11,851
Of course I do.

863
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:14,085
I'll just tell Mr. Bates
where I've gone.

864
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:16,021
You're a good friend
to me, Anna.

865
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:19,094
I hope we're good friends
to each other, milady.

866
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:28,233
- This should be the last of them.
- Great.

867
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:29,902
Okay, give me that,
Mr. Molesley.

868
00:42:29,904 --> 00:42:31,404
- Can you chuck us the rope?
- Here you go.

869
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,405
- Tie it down, make sure it's tight.
- Here we are.

870
00:42:33,407 --> 00:42:35,440
- All set and ready.
- Oh, Papa,

871
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:37,909
Dickie, you're so kind.
But are you sure?

872
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:39,878
You'll be soaked to the skin
and filthy.

873
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,047
Well, what's that to us?
We're hunting men.

874
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:43,983
- Come on.
- You don't need to come, my dear.

875
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:45,183
We can manage it between us.

876
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:47,119
Of course I'm coming.

877
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:48,253
Come along.

878
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:50,324
Cheer up, Molesley.

879
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,262
The villagers and guests

880
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:59,264
will watch from both sides
of the dais.

881
00:42:59,266 --> 00:43:01,500
And there'll be seats at
the front kept for the family.

882
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:04,003
- I'll join you there.
- I suppose so.

883
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:06,639
We'll meet in the high street
where we planned.

884
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:09,108
Don't bring anyone.
Come on your own.

885
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,942
It's all ridiculous, of course.

886
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:13,012
It's a lot of fuss over nothing.

887
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:15,614
What? I thought you
were here to check

888
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:17,916
I didn't do anything foolish
and spoil things.

889
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:20,619
- In what way?
- I don't know.

890
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:24,223
Throw eggs or wave a banner
or shout.

891
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:26,259
Will you?

892
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:28,261
No.

893
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:30,563
But I'm starting
to wonder about you.

894
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:33,235
I don't throw eggs.

895
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:37,306
- Have another?
- Yes.

896
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:42,109
- Same again, please.
- Right you are, sir.

897
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:45,543
We'll bring a special chair up

898
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:47,079
for the queen
after breakfast when,

899
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:48,213
hopefully,
it will have stopped raining.

900
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:50,416
I shall carry it myself, milord.

901
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:53,351
- Well, what about the king?
- Well, he'll be on his horse.

902
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:55,054
But suppose it's still raining?

903
00:43:55,056 --> 00:43:56,358
God will make it stop.

904
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:04,262
Is that Tom?

905
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,364
Has he been in the pub
the whole evening?

906
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,117
<i>Well, the day has dawned,
and the weather proves</i>

907
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:28,454
conclusively
that God is a monarchist.

908
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:31,157
Who could doubt it, milady?

909
00:44:34,395 --> 00:44:36,098
Here they come now.

910
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,291
Mr. Molesley?

911
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:08,059
I'm all right.

912
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:09,728
Just need a minute
to catch my breath.

913
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,663
Your Majesties,

914
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:13,532
welcome to Downton Abbey.

915
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:15,567
We're glad to be here,
Lady Grantham.

916
00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:16,705
Grantham.

917
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:21,040
You remember
Lord Grantham's mother.

918
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:24,175
- Hello, Lady Grantham.
- Oh.

919
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:25,610
Oh, can I help you?

920
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:29,081
Someone must, sir, or I...
I may never rise again.

921
00:45:30,418 --> 00:45:31,784
Thank you.

922
00:45:31,786 --> 00:45:35,420
- My daughter, Lady Mary Talbot.
- Hmm.

923
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:38,056
The Marquess and Marchioness
of Hexham.

924
00:45:38,058 --> 00:45:39,558
Mr. Tom Branson.

925
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,128
Lord and Lady Merton.

926
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,596
This is kind of you,

927
00:45:43,598 --> 00:45:45,398
- Lord Grantham.
- Oh, not at all.

928
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,766
It is a great honor.

929
00:45:46,768 --> 00:45:49,235
I'm sure you know,
but Princess Mary

930
00:45:49,237 --> 00:45:50,636
and Lord Lascelles
will be joining us

931
00:45:50,638 --> 00:45:52,237
for luncheon and the parade.

932
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:53,605
They're both coming?

933
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:55,174
As far as I'm aware.

934
00:45:55,176 --> 00:45:56,608
What a relief.

935
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,511
Please forget I said that.

936
00:45:58,513 --> 00:46:00,281
Said what, ma'am?

937
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,119
- Cousin Maud.
- Violet.

938
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:10,121
Are we going to kiss?

939
00:46:10,123 --> 00:46:12,358
I'm glad you want to kiss me.

940
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,061
It wasn't quite what you said
when I last heard from you.

941
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:18,300
Wasn't quite how I felt
when I wrote.

942
00:46:30,645 --> 00:46:32,610
Can I help you at all?

943
00:46:32,612 --> 00:46:34,612
Thanks.
The others all shot off,

944
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:36,681
and I'm not sure
if this is the right way.

945
00:46:36,683 --> 00:46:38,650
Just come with me.

946
00:46:38,652 --> 00:46:40,453
What's your part in this circus?

947
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:42,154
I'm Lady Bagshaw's maid.

948
00:46:42,156 --> 00:46:44,426
Oh, well, then it's this door.

949
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:49,094
You just ask for Mrs. Hughes.

950
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:51,132
- She'll look after you.
- Thank you.

951
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:57,268
Oh, have you tasted the water?

952
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,172
Only for body.
Never for drinking.

953
00:47:00,174 --> 00:47:02,775
Ah, this has just arrived
for Lady Edith.

954
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:05,376
Lady Hexham these days,
Mr. Bates, but...

955
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:08,514
Thank you, Albert.
It's a relief.

956
00:47:08,516 --> 00:47:09,815
I want the milk now.

957
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:11,250
I want the egg yolks now.

958
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:12,585
I want the olive oil now.

959
00:47:12,587 --> 00:47:14,552
And I want
the vanilla pod now.

960
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:16,688
He wants a clip
around the ear... now.

961
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,257
Careful, Mrs. Patmore.

962
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:19,824
Uh, right. Who's taking
this up? Mr. Molesley?

963
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:21,860
Uh, there's no need for you
to meddle, Mrs. Hughes.

964
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:23,661
- We will see to it.
- Meddle?

965
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:25,364
I don't believe I'm meddling

966
00:47:25,366 --> 00:47:27,900
in my own house, thank you.
Andrew, yes.

967
00:47:27,902 --> 00:47:30,201
- You take that one.
- But it's not your house, is it?

968
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:32,471
So, would you like to go
and sit down?

969
00:47:32,473 --> 00:47:34,473
- Now, just a minute.
- Uh, you leave those.

970
00:47:34,475 --> 00:47:35,674
Put them down.

971
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:36,909
For heaven's sake,
go after them.

972
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:38,511
I really must protest.
My staff are...

973
00:47:38,513 --> 00:47:40,445
Keep them down here, Mr. Carson.

974
00:47:40,447 --> 00:47:42,181
That goes for you, too.

975
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,282
Stay out of our way.

976
00:47:44,284 --> 00:47:47,355
You've seen Their Majesties.
Let it be enough.

977
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:56,695
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute.

978
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,230
What-what are you playing at?

979
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:00,366
Hang on.

980
00:48:00,368 --> 00:48:02,867
What...?

981
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:07,739
Things seem calmer in the north.

982
00:48:07,741 --> 00:48:09,675
You mean after the strike, sir?

983
00:48:09,677 --> 00:48:12,777
Yes, if calmer means
more resigned.

984
00:48:12,779 --> 00:48:14,646
I'm not sure
what the future holds.

985
00:48:14,648 --> 00:48:17,449
Hmm.
And you, Lady Grantham.

986
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:19,751
Were you affected
by the general strike?

987
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:24,924
Well, my maid was rather curt
with me while it was on, sir.

988
00:48:24,926 --> 00:48:28,393
But, you know,
she is a communist at heart.

989
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:30,764
So I suppose
it was only to be expected.

990
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:34,433
Wasn't the princess joining us?

991
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:35,934
Uh, they telephoned.

992
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:38,704
Lord Lacelles has been
held up by something.

993
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:41,639
Uh, but they are planning
to come for the parade.

994
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:42,974
I imagine the servants' bedrooms

995
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:44,476
are quite pleasant here.

996
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:46,844
Why? Are you worried
for your maid?

997
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:48,846
How clever of you.

998
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:50,782
Lucy is more of a companion
than a maid.

999
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:52,418
I'd hate for her
to be uncomfortable.

1000
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,389
Of course.

1001
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:57,755
I really have to go.

1002
00:48:57,757 --> 00:49:00,226
You can't embarrass Mama.

1003
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,262
I'm sorry, but you must wait
until we stand.

1004
00:49:03,264 --> 00:49:06,364
Lord Hexham,
how is Northumberland?

1005
00:49:06,366 --> 00:49:08,300
As beautiful as ever, sir.

1006
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:10,305
Can it spare you, do you think?

1007
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:14,005
Well, that was humiliating.

1008
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:16,541
Go on.

1009
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,645
Oh! Well, we might as well
all go for a walk.

1010
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:21,380
We cannot challenge the way

1011
00:49:21,382 --> 00:49:23,514
a royal visit is conducted,
Mrs. Patmore.

1012
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:25,451
- I'm not so sure.
- Why don't we all meet

1013
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:27,886
- back here after the parade?
- Anna, Mr. Bates,

1014
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:31,657
there must be no trouble or
disloyal tomfoolery of any kind.

1015
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:33,659
Do you hear me?

1016
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:36,027
We'll meet in the wine cellar.

1017
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:37,730
Tell the others.

1018
00:49:37,732 --> 00:49:39,732
Now, I'm walking
to Mr. Bakewell's,

1019
00:49:39,734 --> 00:49:42,300
- if you've any errands.
- No.

1020
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:44,335
Well, then,

1021
00:49:44,337 --> 00:49:46,337
- we should get moving.
- Ah. - Of course, sir.

1022
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:48,907
- Yes.
- Here we go.

1023
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:50,476
Ma'am.

1024
00:49:50,478 --> 00:49:52,478
I'm so looking forward to this.

1025
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,346
- Okay.
- Good lunch, I thought.

1026
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:57,382
What was the king saying
earlier? I couldn't hear.

1027
00:49:57,384 --> 00:49:59,985
He's planning a tour for the
Prince of Wales next March.

1028
00:49:59,987 --> 00:50:02,554
It'll take in most
of the African colonies

1029
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:04,889
- and finish in Cape Town.
- And he wants you to go?

1030
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:07,826
He thinks
I'm a steadying influence.

1031
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:09,762
How long would you be away?

1032
00:50:09,764 --> 00:50:11,462
About three months.

1033
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:13,766
I can't believe my luck.
Can you?

1034
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:24,710
I think we're parked
around the back.

1035
00:51:28,074 --> 00:51:29,507
Tom.

1036
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:31,876
What on earth
are you doing here?

1037
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:33,445
I might ask you
the same question.

1038
00:51:33,447 --> 00:51:34,746
Go back, or you'll ruin things.

1039
00:51:34,748 --> 00:51:35,947
Isn't that what you're doing?

1040
00:51:35,949 --> 00:51:37,549
You don't know what I'm doing.

1041
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:38,817
- Who's this?
- This is my sister-in-law,

1042
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,485
Lady Mary Talbot.

1043
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:42,323
I told you to come alone.

1044
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,659
Leave this to me.

1045
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:54,395
- Tom!
- Get the gun!

1046
00:52:57,964 --> 00:53:00,498
There he is.

1047
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,237
- Hold still.
- Got him?

1048
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:07,942
Calm down.
You're not going anywhere.

1049
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:20,652
- Hold still.
- Are you all right, sir?

1050
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:21,820
- High treason, that is.
- Your Ladyship?

1051
00:53:21,822 --> 00:53:23,255
Why are you even here?

1052
00:53:23,257 --> 00:53:24,989
I didn't suspect him myself
until last night.

1053
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,858
How was I to know you'd
given up on a free Ireland?

1054
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,559
Isn't it free now?

1055
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:30,795
Not with the bloody Crown
around its neck!

1056
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:31,963
Get in.

1057
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:34,532
- Take him away.
- All right, sir.

1058
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:35,733
I'm not impressed
you all decided

1059
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:36,869
I was a royal assassin.

1060
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:38,237
I didn't.

1061
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,704
It was really the others.

1062
00:53:39,706 --> 00:53:40,909
If you'll follow us
to the station.

1063
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:43,741
Why didn't you tell us?

1064
00:53:43,743 --> 00:53:45,110
I thought he'd come
to check up on me

1065
00:53:45,112 --> 00:53:46,578
and didn't want
to drag you into it.

1066
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,145
I assumed he'd back off

1067
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:50,715
if I answered his questions
and met him for a drink.

1068
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:52,518
But last night at the pub,

1069
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,887
I realized he wanted to use me
to get close to the king.

1070
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:38,096
Royal salute!

1071
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:41,268
Carry... swords!

1072
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:56,315
Sorry.

1073
00:54:56,317 --> 00:54:58,119
Excuse me.

1074
00:55:00,253 --> 00:55:01,853
We thought you'd miss it.

1075
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:03,121
I was just in time.

1076
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:04,590
I don't know why I bothered.

1077
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,657
- Shh!
- Oh, quiet.

1078
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:26,945
Your Majesty,

1079
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:28,179
the Yorkshire Hussars
are formed up,

1080
00:55:28,181 --> 00:55:31,016
ready and awaiting
your inspection.

1081
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:40,858
Where is he?

1082
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,927
He's not feeling well.

1083
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:45,630
Wasn't he out shooting
yesterday?

1084
00:55:45,632 --> 00:55:48,032
- What do you want me to say?
- Nothing.

1085
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:49,867
You have to let me leave him.

1086
00:55:49,869 --> 00:55:52,940
We will not talk about it now.

1087
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:06,851
Is that your maid?

1088
00:56:06,853 --> 00:56:09,820
That's right. Lucy.

1089
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:12,190
Don't you call her
by her surname?

1090
00:56:12,192 --> 00:56:14,291
She's been with me so long.

1091
00:56:21,235 --> 00:56:23,101
It's so strange.

1092
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:25,237
- He seemed so English.
- And so he was.

1093
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:26,837
A pillar of the establishment,

1094
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:28,306
until the notion
of Irish independence

1095
00:56:28,308 --> 00:56:30,041
took him over to the other side.

1096
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:31,876
That's where I came in.

1097
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:34,779
He'd heard my sympathies lay
with Ireland and the republic.

1098
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:36,715
Don't they?

1099
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:38,150
Not at any cost.

1100
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:39,750
I'm a law-and-order man
these days.

1101
00:56:39,752 --> 00:56:41,319
That's what you lot
have done to me.

1102
00:56:42,723 --> 00:56:44,288
So, will there be a great splash

1103
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:45,956
all over the newspapers?

1104
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,458
Poor Papa.

1105
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,460
Oh, no. You'll find
there isn't a whisper

1106
00:56:49,462 --> 00:56:51,762
about this anywhere.

1107
00:56:51,764 --> 00:56:54,065
An establishment cover-up.

1108
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:56,737
I don't believe
in conspiracy theories.

1109
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,108
Yes.

1110
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,809
- Do you... do you write?
- I try.

1111
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:06,844
Ah, Miss Smith.
Did Mrs. Hughes sort you out?

1112
00:57:06,846 --> 00:57:08,980
She did.

1113
00:57:08,982 --> 00:57:11,849
And have you enjoyed the parade?

1114
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:15,786
Do you work at the house?

1115
00:57:15,788 --> 00:57:17,121
Not exactly.

1116
00:57:17,123 --> 00:57:19,424
I sell cars,
and I help with the estate.

1117
00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:21,793
Lord Grantham
is my father-in-law.

1118
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,228
Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir.

1119
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,197
Oh, no, please, let me explain.

1120
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:28,900
I started here as a chauffeur.

1121
00:57:28,902 --> 00:57:30,501
You must be
Lady Sybil's husband.

1122
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:32,003
I am.

1123
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:33,971
Lady Bagshaw and I
followed the story.

1124
00:57:33,973 --> 00:57:35,873
We were so sad when she died.

1125
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,375
How long ago was it?

1126
00:57:37,377 --> 00:57:39,143
Seven years, or nearly.

1127
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:41,313
- My God.
- I'm sorry.

1128
00:57:41,315 --> 00:57:43,982
- It's still painful.
- Not in that way.

1129
00:57:43,984 --> 00:57:47,351
It doesn't hurt anymore,
but it's still there.

1130
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:50,288
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

1131
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:53,824
Was it hard,
coming up like that?

1132
00:57:53,826 --> 00:57:55,427
Joining the family.

1133
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:57,862
Very hard.

1134
00:57:57,864 --> 00:57:59,931
Between my old world
and the new one,

1135
00:57:59,933 --> 00:58:01,766
sometimes I didn't know
who I was.

1136
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:03,268
But you do now?

1137
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,270
I think so, yes.

1138
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:07,338
I came to terms with it.

1139
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,873
Why?

1140
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:11,078
I'm just curious.

1141
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:20,284
Quickly, everyone. Quick.

1142
00:58:20,286 --> 00:58:22,520
Come on. Quickly, Mr. Barrow.

1143
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:24,422
Can somebody tell me
what's going on? Anna?

1144
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:26,224
- Shh!
- What's going on?

1145
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:27,826
What are we all
doing down here?

1146
00:58:27,828 --> 00:58:29,427
Shh. Go inside.
They can't hear us in there.

1147
00:58:29,429 --> 00:58:31,329
This is most improper.

1148
00:58:31,331 --> 00:58:33,431
Yes, why-why have you
got us all here?

1149
00:58:33,433 --> 00:58:35,000
- Yeah.
- I will tell you.

1150
00:58:35,002 --> 00:58:37,168
Mr. Bates and I...

1151
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,005
we want to defend
Downton's honor.

1152
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:41,405
In what way?

1153
00:58:41,407 --> 00:58:43,340
Would you like a repeat
of how you were all

1154
00:58:43,342 --> 00:58:44,509
treated at luncheon?

1155
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:45,976
No, I bloody well would not.

1156
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:47,179
Andrew,
there are ladies present.

1157
00:58:47,181 --> 00:58:49,181
We think we should fight back.

1158
00:58:49,183 --> 00:58:50,549
I don't like the sound of this.

1159
00:58:50,551 --> 00:58:52,550
I do not like this at all.

1160
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,386
Anna, tell them.

1161
00:58:54,388 --> 00:58:57,521
We are going to clear the way
so you cook and serve dinner

1162
00:58:57,523 --> 00:59:00,090
for the king and queen
at Downton Abbey.

1163
00:59:00,092 --> 00:59:02,194
As you should.

1164
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:04,829
Well, oh, my God,
is this a revolution?

1165
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,398
Shall I fetch the pitchforks?

1166
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,065
No, we're serious, Mr. Moseley.

1167
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:09,601
But do you know
what Mr. Courbet's

1168
00:59:09,603 --> 00:59:11,369
brought in for tonight?

1169
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:13,605
Mm, never mind that.
We've got our own supplies.

1170
00:59:13,607 --> 00:59:15,206
And you can leave
Mr. Courbet to me.

1171
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,509
What do you want us to do?

1172
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:19,110
Don't bother with the maids
and valets.

1173
00:59:19,112 --> 00:59:20,478
We've no quarrel with them.

1174
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,380
But we need to get rid
of the royal butler

1175
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:24,114
- for the night.
- The Page of the Backstairs,

1176
00:59:24,116 --> 00:59:25,851
if you don't mind, Mr. Bates.

1177
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,886
And the footmen need to be
out of commission

1178
00:59:27,888 --> 00:59:29,587
from 7:00 until you finish
serving them.

1179
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:31,355
This is treason.

1180
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:32,590
Well, what can we do about 'em?

1181
00:59:32,592 --> 00:59:34,092
Well, we could lock them
in the attic.

1182
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:36,027
Any more talk like that,

1183
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:38,429
and we'll all end up
in Botany Bay.

1184
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:39,965
And did you enjoy

1185
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:41,599
being pushed around
and passed over

1186
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:45,003
and told to stay down here
by Mr. Wilson?

1187
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:46,971
I will play
no active part in this.

1188
00:59:46,973 --> 00:59:49,007
Well, suppose His Majesty sees

1189
00:59:49,009 --> 00:59:50,442
what's going on
and is displeased.

1190
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:52,009
Why? Do you think

1191
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:54,246
I'm not capable of cooking
a decent dinner?

1192
00:59:54,248 --> 00:59:56,146
Oh, no, of course not.
But-but I...

1193
00:59:56,148 --> 00:59:58,016
I'll see to the footmen.

1194
00:59:58,018 --> 00:59:59,451
What are you going to do?

1195
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:01,319
You'll find out.

1196
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:03,889
So, does this mean
we're back on duty after all?

1197
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,324
- Me and Mr. Moseley?
- And Albert as well.

1198
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:08,326
You know where to find
the state liveries.

1199
01:00:08,328 --> 01:00:10,161
Right.

1200
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:12,230
- Well, come on, Daisy.
- Will I pour wine

1201
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:14,199
for the queen's sweet lips?

1202
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:16,967
Any more of that,
and we'll lock you in the attic.

1203
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:18,168
I don't know why
you're bothering.

1204
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,536
What about that Mrs. Webb

1205
01:00:19,538 --> 01:00:21,105
who keeps telling us
she's the housekeeper?

1206
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:22,440
Don't you worry about Mrs. Webb.

1207
01:00:22,442 --> 01:00:24,576
I am more than a match
for Mrs. Webb.

1208
01:00:28,248 --> 01:00:30,181
<i>I still don't know</i>

1209
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:31,983
how you're going to manage
Mr. Courbet.

1210
01:00:31,985 --> 01:00:33,951
Well, there's, um...

1211
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:35,987
I'm just going upstairs
to lie down.

1212
01:00:35,989 --> 01:00:38,322
Can you get things ready
for when I come back?

1213
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:41,192
When will that be, O Mighty One?

1214
01:00:41,194 --> 01:00:43,561
Wake me in half an hour

1215
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:46,965
if I'm not already
in the kitchen.

1216
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:51,272
Trust us.

1217
01:00:55,007 --> 01:00:57,074
Tell us about your maid.

1218
01:00:57,076 --> 01:00:58,944
Lucy is the daughter of...

1219
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,545
David's army servant,
Jack Smith.

1220
01:01:00,547 --> 01:01:03,648
And, like my husband,
he died in the Boer Wars.

1221
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,650
So you looked after his child?

1222
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:07,451
Lucy had no mother, you see.

1223
01:01:07,453 --> 01:01:08,987
So I gave her a home.

1224
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:10,956
That's very generous.

1225
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,458
Generosity that has been amply
returned, I can assure you.

1226
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,594
I'm glad.

1227
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:19,266
You don't sound very glad.

1228
01:02:03,143 --> 01:02:06,043
Oh, goodness.

1229
01:02:06,045 --> 01:02:08,779
I thought everyone
was in the drawing room.

1230
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,349
I've been dodging it,
I'm afraid.

1231
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:14,284
I suppose I ought to get back.

1232
01:02:14,286 --> 01:02:16,154
Can I get someone for you?

1233
01:02:16,156 --> 01:02:18,223
No, thank you.

1234
01:02:18,225 --> 01:02:20,791
You're the widower of the
youngest daughter, aren't you?

1235
01:02:20,793 --> 01:02:22,427
I've heard of you, Mister...

1236
01:02:22,429 --> 01:02:23,795
Branson.

1237
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:26,096
Tom Branson.

1238
01:02:26,098 --> 01:02:28,199
And who are you?
Ah, I should know,

1239
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:30,201
but I'm no good
at that sort of thing.

1240
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:35,172
Well, I suppose you can't
be expected to know everyone.

1241
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:37,375
Mm.

1242
01:02:37,377 --> 01:02:39,476
Did you enjoy the parade?

1243
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:41,478
I'm afraid
I missed it completely.

1244
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:42,813
I got distracted.

1245
01:02:42,815 --> 01:02:44,815
- What a shame.
- Well, to be honest,

1246
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:46,483
I'm not much of a royalist.

1247
01:02:46,485 --> 01:02:48,052
Although I probably
shouldn't say that out loud.

1248
01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:51,422
Certainly not to a stranger.

1249
01:02:51,424 --> 01:02:53,090
That seems odd, as the Crawleys

1250
01:02:53,092 --> 01:02:55,159
would die for the Crown
if they had to.

1251
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:57,661
You can love people
you disagree with.

1252
01:02:57,663 --> 01:03:00,230
And you love them?

1253
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,833
They're decent at the core.

1254
01:03:02,835 --> 01:03:06,204
People can be decent at the core
but very difficult to live with.

1255
01:03:06,206 --> 01:03:07,639
True enough.

1256
01:03:07,641 --> 01:03:10,340
And they're silly, too,
and snobbish at times.

1257
01:03:10,342 --> 01:03:13,244
And I wouldn't give tuppence
for their politics.

1258
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:16,081
But I've learned to be happy
with all of that.

1259
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,215
And besides...

1260
01:03:18,217 --> 01:03:20,819
they're my daughter's family.

1261
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,422
And she lives here?

1262
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:28,326
I nearly took her away once.

1263
01:03:28,328 --> 01:03:31,228
But she belongs here now.

1264
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,199
I spent so much of my life
not belonging anywhere.

1265
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:36,536
That's important to me.

1266
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:41,172
I suppose, in the end,
it's deciding

1267
01:03:41,174 --> 01:03:43,543
what's important, isn't it?

1268
01:03:46,378 --> 01:03:49,346
You've given me a great deal
to think about, Mr. Branson.

1269
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:50,882
Good things, I hope.

1270
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:53,684
That may be so, but...

1271
01:03:53,686 --> 01:03:56,156
now we must go in.

1272
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:03,494
We must change.

1273
01:04:03,496 --> 01:04:05,295
And you leave in the morning.

1274
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:07,599
I wonder if we might have
a talk later.

1275
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:08,833
We'll find a cozy spot.

1276
01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:10,869
And Robert can join us.

1277
01:04:10,871 --> 01:04:12,737
I won't be interrogated, Violet.

1278
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:16,808
Please, don't miss the chance
to settle things between you.

1279
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:18,742
Very well.

1280
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:20,777
But now I must go.

1281
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:28,152
That was helpful.
Thank you.

1282
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:29,786
Well, I told you
I wanted to help.

1283
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:32,359
Well, thanks to you,
we have her cornered.

1284
01:04:37,197 --> 01:04:38,862
Mr. Wilson.

1285
01:04:38,864 --> 01:04:40,898
There's a telephone call
for you.

1286
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,766
For me?

1287
01:04:42,768 --> 01:04:45,536
But, Sir Harry, they wouldn't
get to London until 9:00.

1288
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:47,172
It doesn't matter.

1289
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,373
The ball at Clarence House
won't start till 10:00.

1290
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,375
What ball at Clarence House?

1291
01:04:51,377 --> 01:04:52,876
The Duke of Connaught's.

1292
01:04:52,878 --> 01:04:54,712
What are you playing at, Wilson?

1293
01:04:54,714 --> 01:04:56,280
I'm not questioning you, sir,

1294
01:04:56,282 --> 01:04:58,349
not if it's what
the Duke of Connaught wishes.

1295
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:00,284
But how do I manage here?

1296
01:05:00,286 --> 01:05:02,186
Don't they have footmen
at Downton?

1297
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:04,822
Yes, there are footmen.
But won't His Majesty...

1298
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:07,224
His Majesty won't give
a tinker's cuss!

1299
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:10,663
- Now, do as I say.
- Of course, Sir Harry. At once.

1300
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:18,802
Everything all right,
Mr. Wilson?

1301
01:05:18,804 --> 01:05:20,471
I need to see my footmen

1302
01:05:20,473 --> 01:05:22,607
and the house footmen
and the hall boy.

1303
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:24,808
Uh, when is the next train
to London?

1304
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,513
I hope it's not bad news.

1305
01:05:28,248 --> 01:05:30,848
Not bad, exactly.

1306
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,217
But irregular.

1307
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:35,522
Very irregular, indeed.

1308
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:42,360
I'll get drummed out of the
regiment if they ever find out.

1309
01:05:42,362 --> 01:05:44,362
Well, you sounded
convincing to me.

1310
01:05:44,364 --> 01:05:46,431
Oh, I'm very good
at doing Sir Harry Barnston,

1311
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:49,433
- I can assure you.
- What if Mr. Wilson rings back?

1312
01:05:49,435 --> 01:05:51,436
No one queries
Sir Harry's orders.

1313
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:52,704
But if he did?

1314
01:05:52,706 --> 01:05:54,706
Well, then they'd
uncover the trick.

1315
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:57,275
But they couldn't
trace it back to me.

1316
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:59,376
Right. Shall we go into York?

1317
01:05:59,378 --> 01:06:01,679
Sorry to miss out
on the fun, in a way.

1318
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:04,549
Where shall I wait for you
when you're with your parents?

1319
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,186
We'll find a pub.

1320
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:14,692
Did you manage
to speak to someone?

1321
01:06:14,694 --> 01:06:17,328
I got hold
of Madame Seymour's assistant.

1322
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,895
They've sent you the wrong one.

1323
01:06:18,897 --> 01:06:21,666
It's similar in style
but not, as you can see,

1324
01:06:21,668 --> 01:06:24,501
- in size.
- Well, where's my dress now?

1325
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:25,940
On its way to New York.

1326
01:06:27,273 --> 01:06:28,405
Well, that's that, then.

1327
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:30,275
Wonderful.

1328
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,976
Everything's going wrong
for me today.

1329
01:06:31,978 --> 01:06:35,313
- Milady?
- Oh. Never mind.

1330
01:06:35,315 --> 01:06:38,349
How are things downstairs?
Any better?

1331
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:40,684
A bit better, yes, milady.

1332
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:43,288
In fact,
I ought to be getting back.

1333
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,558
Of course.

1334
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:48,759
Oh, one thing.

1335
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:51,895
The painted glass
that used to sit by my bed,

1336
01:06:51,897 --> 01:06:53,900
was it broken while I was away?

1337
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,567
Leave it with me, milady.

1338
01:06:57,569 --> 01:06:59,436
And the dress.

1339
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:02,639
You wouldn't mind a fitting
later tonight, would you?

1340
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:04,741
I don't understand.
Who with?

1341
01:07:04,743 --> 01:07:07,547
I just had an idea.

1342
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:11,983
I shouldn't think so,

1343
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:13,817
not if she knows
what's good for her.

1344
01:07:13,819 --> 01:07:15,453
Oh, I...

1345
01:07:15,455 --> 01:07:17,822
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1346
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:20,657
How clever of you to find me.

1347
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:23,661
Well, not really.
I lived here 40 years.

1348
01:07:23,663 --> 01:07:25,596
I assume this is your maid?

1349
01:07:25,598 --> 01:07:28,699
- Yes, this is Lucy Smith.
- Oh.

1350
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,400
Good evening, Smith.

1351
01:07:30,402 --> 01:07:32,603
Good evening, milady.

1352
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:35,038
- Shall I go?
- No, not for me.

1353
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,875
Not for me.
I'm delighted to meet you.

1354
01:07:37,877 --> 01:07:40,610
I've heard so much about you.

1355
01:07:40,612 --> 01:07:42,579
Is there something you want?

1356
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:43,915
Hmm?

1357
01:07:43,917 --> 01:07:46,083
Oh, just-just to see
you're comfortable

1358
01:07:46,085 --> 01:07:48,985
and to confirm
our little chat for later.

1359
01:07:48,987 --> 01:07:50,788
I live my own life now, Violet.

1360
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,590
I'm not what I was.

1361
01:07:52,592 --> 01:07:54,592
My father is gone.
My husband is gone.

1362
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:56,793
I see no reason
not to do what I want.

1363
01:07:56,795 --> 01:07:59,630
Well, that doesn't mean
there is no reason,

1364
01:07:59,632 --> 01:08:02,132
merely that you cannot see it.

1365
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:04,134
I think Lady Merton is right.

1366
01:08:04,136 --> 01:08:07,105
We'll have it out,
once and for all.

1367
01:08:07,107 --> 01:08:09,409
But now I must go
to Her Majesty.

1368
01:08:14,413 --> 01:08:15,581
Hmm.

1369
01:08:18,985 --> 01:08:21,385
You're not to speak.
You're not to think.

1370
01:08:21,387 --> 01:08:23,054
Just follow my lead.

1371
01:08:23,056 --> 01:08:26,157
Their Majesties must not know
they're being served

1372
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,891
by anyone different.
Do you hear me?

1373
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:29,894
I don't want them
to even notice.

1374
01:08:29,896 --> 01:08:31,595
We will do our best, Mr. Wilson.

1375
01:08:31,597 --> 01:08:32,796
I don't want your best.

1376
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:34,665
I want far better
than your best.

1377
01:08:34,667 --> 01:08:37,435
Is everything under control
here, Mr. Wilson?

1378
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:39,636
I gather the others
caught the train.

1379
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:41,872
And this is
what we're left with.

1380
01:08:41,874 --> 01:08:44,675
Mind you don't disgrace
the state livery, Albert.

1381
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:46,144
Of course, Mr. Carson.

1382
01:08:46,146 --> 01:08:48,145
Where is Monsieur Courbet?

1383
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:50,848
- I came in here to see him.
- Uh, he went out.

1384
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,917
So I thought I'd better get on
with dinner. Wasn't I right?

1385
01:08:53,919 --> 01:08:56,753
- No, you were not right. You were entirely wrong!
- Oh!

1386
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

1387
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:03,629
I don't know h-how
that happened.

1388
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:08,468
Well, I shall
have to go and change.

1389
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:12,705
We'll sort this out
when I return.

1390
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:23,717
Andy.

1391
01:09:29,088 --> 01:09:30,854
If you don't
want me to, I won't.

1392
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:32,155
But you've already said
that you will.

1393
01:09:32,157 --> 01:09:34,458
Because it's a fantastic chance.

1394
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,226
It didn't occur to me
you'd mind.

1395
01:09:36,228 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't, exactly.
Not in that way.

1396
01:09:38,664 --> 01:09:39,729
Then in what way?

1397
01:09:39,731 --> 01:09:41,232
I wasn't going to tell you.

1398
01:09:41,234 --> 01:09:44,668
I wasn't going
to tell anyone, but...

1399
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,737
I might be pregnant.

1400
01:09:48,674 --> 01:09:50,511
Oh, darling.

1401
01:09:52,178 --> 01:09:54,511
How marvelous.

1402
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:56,247
How fabulous.

1403
01:09:56,249 --> 01:09:58,216
My heart is bursting.

1404
01:09:58,218 --> 01:10:00,016
Oh, well, that's
exactly what I don't want.

1405
01:10:00,018 --> 01:10:02,519
- It could easily go wrong.
- Oh, but-but if it doesn't...

1406
01:10:02,521 --> 01:10:04,020
Then I'll give birth

1407
01:10:04,022 --> 01:10:07,093
just as you set off on
your three-month colonial tour.

1408
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:11,962
Why didn't you say this
when I first mentioned it?

1409
01:10:11,964 --> 01:10:13,965
You'd agreed
before I had the chance.

1410
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:15,933
Secrets always muddle things.

1411
01:10:15,935 --> 01:10:18,101
Oh, yes, that's right,
let's make it my fault.

1412
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:21,072
Well, I'll tell the king
I can't go.

1413
01:10:21,074 --> 01:10:23,643
And he'll accept that, will he?

1414
01:11:00,146 --> 01:11:02,712
Hello.
It's Miss Smith, isn't it?

1415
01:11:02,714 --> 01:11:04,814
We were talking about you
earlier. Weren't we?

1416
01:11:04,816 --> 01:11:06,817
Oh, Tom.

1417
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:10,820
What luck.
You know Miss Smith, don't you?

1418
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:12,959
Come along, Mary.

1419
01:11:19,331 --> 01:11:20,797
Are you all right?

1420
01:11:20,799 --> 01:11:22,233
Has something happened?

1421
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:25,302
Old Lady Grantham came in
while we were dressing.

1422
01:11:25,304 --> 01:11:28,939
I think the stage is set
for a fight later, about me.

1423
01:11:28,941 --> 01:11:31,207
She thinks Lady Bagshaw
means to favor me,

1424
01:11:31,209 --> 01:11:34,045
- and she doesn't approve.
- What business is it of hers?

1425
01:11:34,047 --> 01:11:35,813
Lady Bagshaw
must have her reasons,

1426
01:11:35,815 --> 01:11:37,848
and that's good enough for me.

1427
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:40,117
Going down, Tom?

1428
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:42,054
Good night.

1429
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:50,027
Ah, there you are, Miss Lawton.

1430
01:11:50,029 --> 01:11:51,729
I hope you're having
a well-earned rest.

1431
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:53,296
Well, there's
always less for me to do

1432
01:11:53,298 --> 01:11:55,065
when Miss Aplin arrives.

1433
01:11:55,067 --> 01:11:57,368
But we must be ready
for the ball tomorrow.

1434
01:11:57,370 --> 01:11:59,302
That's what I want
to talk about.

1435
01:11:59,304 --> 01:12:02,640
Later this evening, when I
go up to help Lady Hexham,

1436
01:12:02,642 --> 01:12:04,241
I want you to come with me,

1437
01:12:04,243 --> 01:12:06,810
fit a new ball dress
and sew it overnight

1438
01:12:06,812 --> 01:12:08,778
so it's done before you leave
in the morning.

1439
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,915
Why on earth would I do that?

1440
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,984
The box and cupid
from the drawing room.

1441
01:12:13,986 --> 01:12:16,220
The library paper knife.

1442
01:12:16,222 --> 01:12:18,926
Lady Hexham's painted glass.

1443
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:22,827
Never took the glass.

1444
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:25,895
Then it must have been broken,
like she said.

1445
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:28,265
But you took something
from that room.

1446
01:12:28,267 --> 01:12:30,301
What was it?

1447
01:12:30,303 --> 01:12:33,837
A patch box
from the dressing table.

1448
01:12:33,839 --> 01:12:35,973
I'd like them all back, please.

1449
01:12:35,975 --> 01:12:38,376
I can't sew a dress in a night.

1450
01:12:38,378 --> 01:12:40,077
When would I sleep?

1451
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:41,979
When you get to Harewood
tomorrow.

1452
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:43,913
And don't think I won't tell.

1453
01:12:43,915 --> 01:12:46,917
"Queen's dresser a thief."

1454
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:49,823
That'll make headlines
from here to Peru.

1455
01:13:02,101 --> 01:13:05,202
The Marquess
and Marchioness of Granby.

1456
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:13,146
Sir William and Lady Ingleby.

1457
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,949
Where are the royal footmen?

1458
01:13:19,951 --> 01:13:21,952
They've had to go back
to London.

1459
01:13:21,954 --> 01:13:25,055
All of them?
Wasn't that rather unlucky?

1460
01:13:25,057 --> 01:13:27,792
Unlucky for some, milady.

1461
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:31,228
The Earl and Countess
of Scarborough.

1462
01:13:36,468 --> 01:13:37,737
Ah.

1463
01:13:42,441 --> 01:13:45,341
For goodness' sake!

1464
01:13:45,343 --> 01:13:48,345
Help me!

1465
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:50,917
Will someone help me?

1466
01:14:05,364 --> 01:14:08,299
I'm going on to Turton's
in a minute.

1467
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:09,934
Do you know it?

1468
01:14:09,936 --> 01:14:11,438
Uh...

1469
01:14:16,142 --> 01:14:18,309
I'm Chris Webster, by the way.

1470
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:20,911
I'm waiting for someone.

1471
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:22,912
For a very long time.

1472
01:14:22,914 --> 01:14:24,685
Perhaps he's found
better things to do.

1473
01:14:25,951 --> 01:14:27,353
And?

1474
01:14:28,987 --> 01:14:31,287
Why don't you come with me?

1475
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:33,325
You know you want to.

1476
01:14:39,298 --> 01:14:41,966
Excuse me, sir.
My name's Barrow.

1477
01:14:41,968 --> 01:14:45,301
If someone comes looking for me,
could you tell him I've gone?

1478
01:14:45,303 --> 01:14:48,107
- Shall I say where to?
- Never mind that. - Turton's.

1479
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,878
I just cannot understand
where Mr. Wilson has got to.

1480
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,947
Never mind him.
What about you?

1481
01:14:56,949 --> 01:14:59,984
Surely, you can't really mean
to leave His Majesty unattended.

1482
01:14:59,986 --> 01:15:02,051
But is it for me to attend him?

1483
01:15:02,053 --> 01:15:03,520
Well, you've got
your breeches on.

1484
01:15:03,522 --> 01:15:05,288
- Well, I have, but...
- Mr. Carson,

1485
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,158
this is your destiny.

1486
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,926
You know as much, and so do I.

1487
01:15:09,928 --> 01:15:12,028
Now, accept it proudly.

1488
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:15,966
And walk into that room
with your head held high.

1489
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:17,204
You can do it, Mr. Carson.

1490
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:24,207
Please tell me what is going on.

1491
01:15:24,209 --> 01:15:26,310
Mr. Courbet is missing,
ditto Mr. Wilson,

1492
01:15:26,312 --> 01:15:29,113
and your footmen are
on their way up to London.

1493
01:15:29,115 --> 01:15:30,915
I am still in charge here.

1494
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,050
No, Mrs. Webb.
These are my people now.

1495
01:15:33,052 --> 01:15:36,386
So please, uh, go back to the
servants' hall and sit down.

1496
01:15:36,388 --> 01:15:38,257
Or would you rather
ruin the evening?

1497
01:15:40,593 --> 01:15:42,292
That's telling her.

1498
01:15:44,463 --> 01:15:46,430
Mrs. Patmore forgot
to send up the sauce.

1499
01:15:46,432 --> 01:15:48,332
- And I've got the chopped egg.
- Oh, that's kind

1500
01:15:48,334 --> 01:15:50,134
- when it's not your job.
- Nonsense.

1501
01:15:50,136 --> 01:15:53,069
We must all pull our weight
tonight for Downton's glory.

1502
01:15:53,071 --> 01:15:55,072
Now, are you ready, boys?

1503
01:15:55,074 --> 01:15:56,306
Ready as we'll ever be.

1504
01:15:56,308 --> 01:15:57,440
We'll be fine, Mrs. Hughes.

1505
01:15:57,442 --> 01:15:59,109
What about you, Mr. Molesley?

1506
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:00,845
I know I'm
gonna forget my lines.

1507
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:02,313
You haven't got any lines.

1508
01:16:02,315 --> 01:16:03,850
- You're on.
- Oh. Right.

1509
01:16:05,383 --> 01:16:07,885
And, Mr. Molesley?

1510
01:16:07,887 --> 01:16:09,485
Remember to breathe.

1511
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:11,287
Breathe, yeah.

1512
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:13,023
Gentlemen.

1513
01:16:43,422 --> 01:16:45,288
I'm glad you're here,
Mr. Carson.

1514
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:47,828
I must go
where my king needs me.

1515
01:16:56,268 --> 01:16:58,269
- Hello.
- All right.

1516
01:17:07,612 --> 01:17:09,113
Oh, hello.

1517
01:17:13,218 --> 01:17:15,219
Looks like we've got
some new blood here.

1518
01:17:15,221 --> 01:17:17,020
Hello.

1519
01:17:17,022 --> 01:17:19,592
You're a very charming
young man.

1520
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:22,158
Hey!

1521
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,561
Stay with me!
Stay with me, Michael!

1522
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:27,965
I can't believe this.

1523
01:17:27,967 --> 01:17:30,266
I've never seen
anything like it.

1524
01:17:30,268 --> 01:17:32,202
There's a first time
for everything.

1525
01:17:32,204 --> 01:17:33,970
I know, but...

1526
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:37,076
Here. Come dance with me.

1527
01:17:42,514 --> 01:17:44,415
- What'd you say?
- I said, "There's your friend."

1528
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:45,683
No, my friend's over there.

1529
01:17:48,553 --> 01:17:52,155
I wish I could tell them how
grateful they should be to you.

1530
01:17:52,157 --> 01:17:54,358
You were every bit as brave
as I was.

1531
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,993
Mary,

1532
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:57,964
you're talking
in the wrong direction.

1533
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:01,532
Don't worry about Granny.

1534
01:18:01,534 --> 01:18:04,400
She's getting ready
to give Cousin Maud a grilling.

1535
01:18:04,402 --> 01:18:07,104
Mainly, I suspect,
about her maid.

1536
01:18:07,106 --> 01:18:10,274
I think Lady Bagshaw sees her
as more than just her maid.

1537
01:18:10,276 --> 01:18:12,076
Oh, I'm sure she does.

1538
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:14,411
And that's what
Granny's afraid of.

1539
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:16,313
I might as well admit...

1540
01:18:16,315 --> 01:18:18,015
I like her.

1541
01:18:18,017 --> 01:18:19,550
Good.

1542
01:18:19,552 --> 01:18:22,353
Don't let them put you off.

1543
01:18:22,355 --> 01:18:24,121
Tom, you're looking
pleased with yourself.

1544
01:18:24,123 --> 01:18:25,689
He was just praising

1545
01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:26,890
Lady Bagshaw's maid.

1546
01:18:26,892 --> 01:18:32,028
Well, uh, how did she contrive
to make your acquaintance?

1547
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,230
She didn't contrive anything.
We met by chance.

1548
01:18:34,232 --> 01:18:37,100
What simpletons men are.

1549
01:18:37,102 --> 01:18:38,568
This is good.

1550
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,738
And I thought
something else was planned.

1551
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,338
But it is excellent.

1552
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,742
So, a well-done to old Courbet.

1553
01:18:44,744 --> 01:18:46,577
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, very delicious.

1554
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:48,311
This wasn't Monsieur Courbet,
Your Majesty.

1555
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:49,613
Mrs. Patmore cooked it.

1556
01:18:49,615 --> 01:18:52,149
In fact, it is
the Downton Abbey staff

1557
01:18:52,151 --> 01:18:53,520
who are serving you
this evening.

1558
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:03,696
Oh.

1559
01:19:07,432 --> 01:19:09,535
Oh.

1560
01:19:11,102 --> 01:19:13,537
I do beg your pardon,
Your Majesty.

1561
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:16,109
That's quite enough, Molesley.

1562
01:19:17,543 --> 01:19:20,176
You must give our compliments
to Mrs. Patmore

1563
01:19:20,178 --> 01:19:22,512
and all the staff.

1564
01:19:22,514 --> 01:19:24,515
- Molesley.
- Huh?

1565
01:19:24,517 --> 01:19:27,620
Her Majesty is speaking to you.

1566
01:19:31,156 --> 01:19:34,727
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

1567
01:19:49,107 --> 01:19:50,607
That was kind of you, ma'am.

1568
01:19:50,609 --> 01:19:52,676
I suppose he's excited

1569
01:19:52,678 --> 01:19:55,144
that they've had to take over
from our people.

1570
01:19:55,146 --> 01:19:56,747
I wonder what's happened.

1571
01:19:56,749 --> 01:19:59,683
Whatever may have happened
does not excuse his behavior.

1572
01:19:59,685 --> 01:20:01,518
I can assure you,
Lady Grantham,

1573
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,753
we are quite used
to people behaving strangely

1574
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,189
when we are near.

1575
01:20:20,772 --> 01:20:23,308
- Whoa!
- That's it. I've got you.

1576
01:20:29,315 --> 01:20:31,280
The peelers are here!

1577
01:20:31,282 --> 01:20:33,250
It's the police!

1578
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:35,284
Make sure no one
scarpers. Block all the exits.

1579
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:36,752
- What's going on?
- All right, gentlemen,

1580
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:39,723
that's the end of your evening.
Shut that music up now!

1581
01:20:39,725 --> 01:20:41,425
Right!

1582
01:20:41,427 --> 01:20:43,726
You are all coming
to the station with us.

1583
01:20:45,364 --> 01:20:47,163
We're just having a bit of fun,
Officer.

1584
01:20:47,165 --> 01:20:48,465
No one's making any trouble.

1585
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:49,699
That's for the judge to decide.

1586
01:20:49,701 --> 01:20:50,734
- Judge?
- What did you think?

1587
01:20:50,736 --> 01:20:52,735
We're gonna slap your wrists
and send you home?

1588
01:20:52,737 --> 01:20:54,304
I've never been here before.

1589
01:20:54,306 --> 01:20:55,538
You're here now. Right!

1590
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:56,907
Gather your things!

1591
01:20:56,909 --> 01:21:00,409
You're coming with us,
you dirty perverts. Out.

1592
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:02,613
- Get out! Move it!
- Come on, you filthy sods.

1593
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,820
- Come on, you lot.
- Pack it in. Get in the van.

1594
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:13,293
Sort it out.

1595
01:21:31,744 --> 01:21:33,476
- There we are, my dear.
- Oh, thank you.

1596
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:35,179
Yes, darling.

1597
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:36,479
Thank you.

1598
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:40,520
There might be a moment.

1599
01:21:42,353 --> 01:21:44,287
I met the maid.

1600
01:21:44,289 --> 01:21:46,523
She has Maud wound
around her little finger.

1601
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:48,625
- Then we need to know why.
- Mm.

1602
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,793
Well, I'll
look forward to it, gentlemen.

1603
01:21:50,795 --> 01:21:53,729
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Milord.

1604
01:21:53,731 --> 01:21:55,565
What is it, Hexham?

1605
01:21:55,567 --> 01:21:57,533
Well, Your Majesty, it's this.

1606
01:21:57,535 --> 01:21:59,769
I've just learned
that Lady Hexham

1607
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:02,206
is expecting our first child.

1608
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,774
But that's wonderful news.

1609
01:22:03,776 --> 01:22:05,576
We're not telling anyone
quite yet,

1610
01:22:05,578 --> 01:22:07,510
but I thought
you'd be interested.

1611
01:22:07,512 --> 01:22:10,449
And so I am. Congratulations.

1612
01:22:11,517 --> 01:22:13,583
The-the thing is, sir,

1613
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:15,418
it's due to be born
around the time

1614
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,688
the prince and I
will be setting off on tour.

1615
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:18,921
Excellent.

1616
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:21,390
Please make it register
with him.

1617
01:22:21,392 --> 01:22:23,760
Help the prince
to understand what it means

1618
01:22:23,762 --> 01:22:25,429
to have a real family life.

1619
01:22:25,431 --> 01:22:27,463
You can be such an example
to him.

1620
01:22:27,465 --> 01:22:29,466
I know it.

1621
01:22:29,468 --> 01:22:33,269
Very well.
Let's get to the point.

1622
01:22:33,271 --> 01:22:37,006
Robert is my nearest relation
on my father's side.

1623
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:39,275
He is.

1624
01:22:39,277 --> 01:22:40,943
But he will not be my heir.

1625
01:22:40,945 --> 01:22:44,280
And there we have it.

1626
01:22:44,282 --> 01:22:45,849
Who will be? Can you tell us?

1627
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:48,585
Lucy Smith, my maid.

1628
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:51,354
What? Are you out of your mind?

1629
01:22:51,356 --> 01:22:53,489
No. And I know what I'm doing.

1630
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:55,725
On the contrary,
you're-you're clearly insane.

1631
01:22:55,727 --> 01:22:57,493
You should be in an asylum.

1632
01:22:57,495 --> 01:22:59,262
How like you.
A word of resistance,

1633
01:22:59,264 --> 01:23:01,465
and you slash with your saber.

1634
01:23:01,467 --> 01:23:04,967
It is lucky for Miss Smith
that I do not own a saber.

1635
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:07,570
So, this is truly your choice?

1636
01:23:07,572 --> 01:23:09,872
Lucy has taken care of me
for many years.

1637
01:23:09,874 --> 01:23:12,042
I wish to show my gratitude.

1638
01:23:12,044 --> 01:23:14,043
With the family house?

1639
01:23:14,045 --> 01:23:15,811
With the family estate?

1640
01:23:15,813 --> 01:23:17,648
You belong in a straitjacket.

1641
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:21,685
To treat your maid
as a blood relation

1642
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:25,021
is to unpick every fiber
of the English way of life.

1643
01:23:25,023 --> 01:23:26,422
What piffle you talk.

1644
01:23:26,424 --> 01:23:29,626
- Oh!
- Please, there is no need to argue.

1645
01:23:29,628 --> 01:23:30,793
I never argue.

1646
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:32,528
I explain.

1647
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:34,665
Face it, Violet,
I'll outlive you anyway,

1648
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,300
so it need trouble you
no further.

1649
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:39,706
And now...
I must attend Her Majesty.

1650
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:47,610
Game, set and match
to Lady Bagshaw.

1651
01:23:47,612 --> 01:23:49,813
Not while I'm the umpire.

1652
01:23:53,785 --> 01:23:55,786
We had a few drinks,
and Mr. Barrow thought

1653
01:23:55,788 --> 01:23:59,389
it'd be fun to play a trick
on the queers, that's all.

1654
01:23:59,391 --> 01:24:00,991
He was only in there
for five minutes.

1655
01:24:00,993 --> 01:24:04,528
Dancing the tango
with another man.

1656
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:06,898
Come on, Sergeant,
it was a joke.

1657
01:24:09,634 --> 01:24:11,435
Turns your stomach, though.

1658
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:13,502
- Relieved to hear it.
- Yeah, I'd rather be dead

1659
01:24:13,504 --> 01:24:15,307
if I thought I was one of them.

1660
01:24:18,343 --> 01:24:20,379
But what can I say to the earl?

1661
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,380
What earl?

1662
01:24:23,382 --> 01:24:25,015
The Earl of Grantham.

1663
01:24:25,017 --> 01:24:26,550
Mr. Barrow is his butler.

1664
01:24:26,552 --> 01:24:28,085
Of course,
you'll want to see proof

1665
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:29,522
of my identity.

1666
01:24:54,512 --> 01:24:57,046
- Was it you who got me out?
- No.

1667
01:24:57,048 --> 01:24:59,051
The good fairy came down
on a moonbeam.

1668
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,119
How did you know where I'd gone?

1669
01:25:03,121 --> 01:25:05,122
The landlord told me.

1670
01:25:05,124 --> 01:25:07,123
Waited outside,
followed you here.

1671
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:09,559
Then I showed the sergeant
my card,

1672
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:11,731
and that seemed
to settle things.

1673
01:25:14,967 --> 01:25:16,966
"The royal household."

1674
01:25:16,968 --> 01:25:18,904
He must have loved that.

1675
01:25:22,407 --> 01:25:23,739
I'm a...

1676
01:25:23,741 --> 01:25:25,677
I'm afraid
I've been a silly boy.

1677
01:25:27,445 --> 01:25:29,445
You just need to be
a bit more circumspect

1678
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:31,415
in future, Mr. Barrow.

1679
01:25:45,798 --> 01:25:47,564
Could you please remove it,
milady,

1680
01:25:47,566 --> 01:25:49,565
leaving the pins in place?

1681
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:52,568
Can you really get it done
before you go?

1682
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:55,037
- I don't see how.
- She'll finish it.

1683
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:57,774
- Won't you?
- I'll do my best.

1684
01:25:57,776 --> 01:25:59,975
I'm sure you'll manage.

1685
01:25:59,977 --> 01:26:02,778
By the way, I think I know
what happened to the cupid

1686
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,613
from the drawing room, milady.

1687
01:26:04,615 --> 01:26:06,649
Really? Was it missing?

1688
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:09,586
Your dress will be ready
in the morning, milady.

1689
01:26:09,588 --> 01:26:10,556
Thank you.

1690
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:16,158
I don't know how
you persuaded her.

1691
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,993
She's nice, really.
When you get to know her.

1692
01:26:19,464 --> 01:26:21,030
Is there anything else?

1693
01:26:21,032 --> 01:26:22,899
Only to say
that you're a genius.

1694
01:26:22,901 --> 01:26:25,805
- Good night.
- Good night.

1695
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:35,581
I'm afraid
I didn't get anywhere.

1696
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:38,614
Well, that's that.

1697
01:26:38,616 --> 01:26:40,516
Just because the king
doesn't see that a man

1698
01:26:40,518 --> 01:26:41,885
has any part to play
in childbearing.

1699
01:26:41,887 --> 01:26:43,720
Well, he doesn't.

1700
01:26:43,722 --> 01:26:46,021
But you'd think he'd know
that one likes to be around.

1701
01:26:46,023 --> 01:26:47,858
You can't just tell him no?

1702
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:50,627
Darling, I'm one of
the senior peers in the land.

1703
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:52,061
What do you think that means?

1704
01:26:52,063 --> 01:26:54,163
What do you think I'm sworn to?

1705
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,908
Lady Bagshaw,
could I have a word

1706
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,846
before you ring for your maid?

1707
01:27:08,914 --> 01:27:12,151
Does Lucy know
that you're her mother?

1708
01:27:14,253 --> 01:27:16,252
She does.

1709
01:27:16,254 --> 01:27:18,555
For years,
I said I was her godmother,

1710
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:20,857
but I told her the truth
on her 18th birthday.

1711
01:27:20,859 --> 01:27:23,693
How old was she when Jack died?

1712
01:27:23,695 --> 01:27:25,929
Six.

1713
01:27:25,931 --> 01:27:29,198
She'd lived with Jack
and his mother until then.

1714
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,800
But I took her into the house,

1715
01:27:30,802 --> 01:27:32,167
and she went
to the village school

1716
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:34,537
until, eventually,
she became my maid.

1717
01:27:34,539 --> 01:27:36,238
I suppose
if she'd been your ward,

1718
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,841
people would have guessed.

1719
01:27:37,843 --> 01:27:39,208
Exactly.

1720
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:41,077
Who takes notice of a servant?

1721
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:42,982
I hid her in plain sight.

1722
01:27:44,115 --> 01:27:45,917
Did you love Jack Smith?

1723
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:52,588
Everyone should know
a total love at least once.

1724
01:27:52,590 --> 01:27:55,026
Jack was mine.

1725
01:27:58,129 --> 01:28:01,564
My husband was very dull,
you know?

1726
01:28:01,566 --> 01:28:03,600
He wasn't a bad man, but...

1727
01:28:03,602 --> 01:28:06,670
but he wasn't a clever one,
either.

1728
01:28:06,672 --> 01:28:09,905
Then he died,
and Jack came to see me,

1729
01:28:09,907 --> 01:28:11,774
and it began from there.

1730
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,877
How daring.

1731
01:28:13,879 --> 01:28:15,744
I know it sounds reckless,

1732
01:28:15,746 --> 01:28:17,948
but I was 39
when I got pregnant.

1733
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:20,750
I thought I was barren.

1734
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:24,787
Of course, I knew I couldn't
tell my father, so...

1735
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,756
I went to America.

1736
01:28:26,758 --> 01:28:28,658
They must have
thought that wild.

1737
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:32,628
Well, little did they know
how wild it really was.

1738
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,764
But you were happy with Jack?

1739
01:28:34,766 --> 01:28:38,033
Oh, very.

1740
01:28:38,035 --> 01:28:40,806
We had ten years together
before he died.

1741
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,242
I'd have married him
if I'd had the courage.

1742
01:28:46,244 --> 01:28:48,345
I was weak.

1743
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:50,913
But you never knew my father.

1744
01:28:50,915 --> 01:28:53,750
I suppose royal service
kept you silent on the subject.

1745
01:28:53,752 --> 01:28:54,984
Yes.

1746
01:28:54,986 --> 01:28:57,886
In a way.

1747
01:28:57,888 --> 01:29:00,092
But it was cowardice, really.

1748
01:29:01,826 --> 01:29:04,193
Now, by making Lucy my heir,

1749
01:29:04,195 --> 01:29:06,965
I will have taken
the first step.

1750
01:29:08,667 --> 01:29:10,667
You must tell Violet at once.

1751
01:29:10,669 --> 01:29:12,668
- I couldn't.
- You're wrong.

1752
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:15,037
As soon as she knows the truth,
she'll fathom your plans

1753
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:17,774
and cease to fight you.

1754
01:29:17,776 --> 01:29:20,976
The servants seem to be
enjoying themselves tonight.

1755
01:29:20,978 --> 01:29:23,048
Especially Molesley.

1756
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:27,016
What happened to the royal team?

1757
01:29:27,018 --> 01:29:29,118
It's a long story, milady.

1758
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,988
But you're right.
We did have fun.

1759
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:35,125
Well, I'm glad it's gone well
for everyone.

1760
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:37,661
But I don't think
I could face doing it again.

1761
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,662
You're not finished yet.

1762
01:29:39,664 --> 01:29:41,197
You've still got the ball
at Harewood.

1763
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,667
Yes, but it won't be our fault
if anything goes wrong.

1764
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:45,668
That's not very cheerful.

1765
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:48,671
The last few days
have made me think.

1766
01:29:48,673 --> 01:29:50,806
Should we really go on with it?

1767
01:29:50,808 --> 01:29:53,275
We're running the house
with too few people as it is,

1768
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:56,145
and half of those here now
will leave soon.

1769
01:29:56,147 --> 01:29:58,047
What are you saying, milady?

1770
01:29:58,049 --> 01:30:00,917
Isn't it time
to chuck in the towel?

1771
01:30:00,919 --> 01:30:03,155
Lots of people have.

1772
01:30:04,755 --> 01:30:07,323
You mean... leave Downton?

1773
01:30:07,325 --> 01:30:09,926
We could sell it for a school

1774
01:30:09,928 --> 01:30:12,729
or an old people's home
or something.

1775
01:30:12,731 --> 01:30:15,732
And buy a manor house
with a modest estate

1776
01:30:15,734 --> 01:30:17,332
and live a normal life.

1777
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:19,638
Is that what you want?

1778
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:25,408
I want everything
to stop being such a struggle.

1779
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:29,045
Will the staff stay?
Will the farms pay?

1780
01:30:29,047 --> 01:30:30,982
What are we going to do
about the roof?

1781
01:30:32,417 --> 01:30:34,451
When I was putting up
the chairs in the rain,

1782
01:30:34,453 --> 01:30:37,453
I kept thinking,
"What am I doing?"

1783
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:39,456
I'll tell you
what you're doing, milady.

1784
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:42,759
You're making a center
for the people who work here.

1785
01:30:42,761 --> 01:30:44,426
For this village.

1786
01:30:44,428 --> 01:30:46,162
For the county.

1787
01:30:46,164 --> 01:30:48,965
Downton Abbey is the heart
of this community,

1788
01:30:48,967 --> 01:30:51,904
and you're keeping it beating.

1789
01:30:53,271 --> 01:30:55,270
So you think
we should battle on?

1790
01:30:55,272 --> 01:30:59,208
- While there's blood in your veins.
- Hmm.

1791
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:12,122
Ah, Miss Smith.

1792
01:31:12,124 --> 01:31:13,790
Is she settled for the night?

1793
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,925
She's more rattled than settled.

1794
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:17,460
And I was right.

1795
01:31:17,462 --> 01:31:20,395
There was an argument.
It was about me.

1796
01:31:20,397 --> 01:31:22,030
I hear from Lord Grantham
she's planning

1797
01:31:22,032 --> 01:31:23,766
to alter your life
for the better.

1798
01:31:23,768 --> 01:31:25,769
He says Old Lady Grantham
was up in arms.

1799
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:28,104
I can imagine.

1800
01:31:28,106 --> 01:31:31,073
Are you entitled
to your good luck?

1801
01:31:31,075 --> 01:31:33,275
Do you know why she's doing it?

1802
01:31:33,277 --> 01:31:35,177
I do.

1803
01:31:35,179 --> 01:31:37,180
And I think it's fair.

1804
01:31:37,182 --> 01:31:40,486
Go forward in health,
and use your luck wisely.

1805
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:44,921
I have such a feeling
that you can understand

1806
01:31:44,923 --> 01:31:48,224
what's going on inside my head
when no one else does

1807
01:31:48,226 --> 01:31:49,962
or ever could.

1808
01:31:53,964 --> 01:31:55,965
I'll miss our talks.

1809
01:31:55,967 --> 01:31:58,268
Would you like to write to me?

1810
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:00,470
I could always provide
a shoulder.

1811
01:32:00,472 --> 01:32:02,037
May I?

1812
01:32:02,039 --> 01:32:03,341
Really?

1813
01:32:07,478 --> 01:32:10,512
I should be pleased
and flattered if you would.

1814
01:32:28,365 --> 01:32:32,001
And now I think it's time
to say good night, Mr. Branson.

1815
01:32:32,003 --> 01:32:34,503
Good night, Miss Smith.

1816
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:46,282
Here's to the triumph of Downton

1817
01:32:46,284 --> 01:32:48,016
and my beautiful wife.

1818
01:32:48,018 --> 01:32:50,452
Oh, here's to all of you
who brought it off.

1819
01:32:50,454 --> 01:32:52,988
Here's to Mr. Carson
for swallowing his principles.

1820
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,890
Well, I shan't
sleep a wink tonight.

1821
01:32:54,892 --> 01:32:56,259
And here's to Her Majesty

1822
01:32:56,261 --> 01:32:58,094
for taking pity on Mr. Molesley.

1823
01:32:58,096 --> 01:33:00,630
For a moment there, I thought
I was headed for the Tower.

1824
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:04,033
You're not coming round to 'em,
are you?

1825
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,034
Uh, it was decent of her, Daisy,

1826
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:07,202
when she could have let it
spoil things.

1827
01:33:07,204 --> 01:33:09,204
Not everyone's like Robespierre.

1828
01:33:09,206 --> 01:33:12,007
Let's hear it
for the king and queen.

1829
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:14,176
The king and queen.

1830
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:17,079
I've got to tell you
something, Daisy.

1831
01:33:20,084 --> 01:33:22,185
It was me that broke the pump.

1832
01:33:22,187 --> 01:33:24,119
I don't know what I was doing.

1833
01:33:24,121 --> 01:33:25,988
I was just in a jealous rage.

1834
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:28,323
- Why?
- It was that plumber you made eyes at.

1835
01:33:28,325 --> 01:33:29,893
I just saw red.

1836
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:31,260
And then when I realized
I'd brought him

1837
01:33:31,262 --> 01:33:32,895
back to the house,
I went nearly mad.

1838
01:33:32,897 --> 01:33:34,463
I did not make eyes.

1839
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:37,332
I liked him, but there was
nothing more to it.

1840
01:33:37,334 --> 01:33:40,103
Well, I feel a fool now.

1841
01:33:40,105 --> 01:33:43,506
You tried to wreck the visit
of the King of England.

1842
01:33:43,508 --> 01:33:45,207
You risked being sacked,

1843
01:33:45,209 --> 01:33:46,676
you risked ruin...

1844
01:33:46,678 --> 01:33:48,211
...just for the love of me?

1845
01:33:48,213 --> 01:33:50,512
I just...
my feelings took over.

1846
01:33:50,514 --> 01:33:52,515
That's all I can say.

1847
01:33:52,517 --> 01:33:54,016
Can you forgive me?

1848
01:33:54,018 --> 01:33:56,185
Forgive you?

1849
01:33:56,187 --> 01:33:59,255
Oh, Andy, I'd have done it
myself if I'd had the nerve.

1850
01:33:59,257 --> 01:34:02,391
Don't you see what it means?

1851
01:34:02,393 --> 01:34:04,394
We're alike, you and I.

1852
01:34:04,396 --> 01:34:06,930
Full of passion
for what matters.

1853
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:08,997
I thought
you were easily satisfied,

1854
01:34:08,999 --> 01:34:11,033
but I see now you're not.

1855
01:34:11,035 --> 01:34:14,237
So we can fight our way
to a better world together.

1856
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,306
I'm not sure I've shown

1857
01:34:17,308 --> 01:34:18,975
enough gratitude
for what you did.

1858
01:34:18,977 --> 01:34:20,976
We have to stick
together, men like us.

1859
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:22,144
That's the point.

1860
01:34:22,146 --> 01:34:23,947
I don't know any men like I am.

1861
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:26,015
I've never just talked
to someone like me.

1862
01:34:26,017 --> 01:34:27,183
Well, we're talking now.

1863
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:29,351
And it feels good.

1864
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:31,287
Just to be two blokes,
having a chat,

1865
01:34:31,289 --> 01:34:33,189
not trying to fit in for once.

1866
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:36,591
Well, we all have to do
what we must to get by.

1867
01:34:36,593 --> 01:34:39,597
But yeah. Feels good
to be two ordinary blokes.

1868
01:34:41,098 --> 01:34:43,632
Will they ever see it our way?

1869
01:34:43,634 --> 01:34:46,034
I don't know.

1870
01:34:46,036 --> 01:34:48,641
50 years ago, who'd have
thought man could fly?

1871
01:35:19,236 --> 01:35:21,172
Mrs. Bates?

1872
01:35:22,673 --> 01:35:24,208
Well, here's the dress.

1873
01:35:25,276 --> 01:35:26,775
We can try it before you leave.

1874
01:35:26,777 --> 01:35:29,380
No need. It'll fit.

1875
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:34,987
Those are the things you wanted.

1876
01:35:38,056 --> 01:35:40,355
Why do you do it, Miss Lawton?

1877
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:42,492
Doesn't it ever worry you

1878
01:35:42,494 --> 01:35:44,193
that on each table
in this house,

1879
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:45,661
there's an ornament
that you couldn't buy

1880
01:35:45,663 --> 01:35:46,762
with a year's wages?

1881
01:35:46,764 --> 01:35:48,296
And what's your answer?

1882
01:35:48,298 --> 01:35:49,564
Because everyone
can't have them,

1883
01:35:49,566 --> 01:35:51,567
- no one should have them?
- No.

1884
01:35:51,569 --> 01:35:54,436
My answer is,
"Why can't I have them?

1885
01:35:54,438 --> 01:35:56,171
Or some of them."

1886
01:35:56,173 --> 01:35:58,808
Don't worry,
they won't miss what I take.

1887
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,810
I doubt there's more
than one in 100

1888
01:36:00,812 --> 01:36:02,244
would even notice they're gone.

1889
01:36:02,246 --> 01:36:04,247
But they're not yours,
Miss Lawton.

1890
01:36:04,249 --> 01:36:05,715
And they never will be.

1891
01:36:05,717 --> 01:36:07,783
I'd give it up if I were you.

1892
01:36:07,785 --> 01:36:10,653
What if people were to think
Her Majesty was light-fingered

1893
01:36:10,655 --> 01:36:13,359
if things go missing
from every house she stays in?

1894
01:36:15,259 --> 01:36:19,097
Keep your advice for someone
who's interested, Mrs. Bates.

1895
01:36:20,731 --> 01:36:23,399
Those doors play up
something dreadful.

1896
01:36:23,401 --> 01:36:25,301
They jam and stick
for no reason.

1897
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:26,536
It's happened to everyone.

1898
01:36:26,538 --> 01:36:28,403
Why didn't any of you look
for me?

1899
01:36:28,405 --> 01:36:30,439
I thought I'd seen you go out,
Mr. Wilson.

1900
01:36:30,441 --> 01:36:32,442
I'm afraid I was mistaken.

1901
01:36:32,444 --> 01:36:35,711
Just as you were mistaken
in not waking Monsieur Courbet.

1902
01:36:35,713 --> 01:36:37,715
- We thought he'd gone out and all.
- Oh.

1903
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:42,618
Thank you, Mrs. Hughes.

1904
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:45,087
Uh, a little more marmalade,
if you please.

1905
01:36:46,691 --> 01:36:47,790
The footmen have
telephoned this morning.

1906
01:36:47,792 --> 01:36:50,693
It seems it was a hoax
that took them up to London.

1907
01:36:50,695 --> 01:36:53,395
- But who would do that?
- Who, indeed?

1908
01:36:53,397 --> 01:36:56,265
We can investigate
when we get to Harewood.

1909
01:36:56,267 --> 01:36:57,867
I should be careful,
Monsieur Courbet,

1910
01:36:57,869 --> 01:37:00,103
unless you enjoy ridicule.

1911
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:03,271
- What?
- I'd say the dinner was a success.

1912
01:37:03,273 --> 01:37:05,408
They sent down
their compliments,

1913
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:07,643
so I think it must have been.

1914
01:37:07,645 --> 01:37:10,145
Well, then,
why call attention to it?

1915
01:37:10,147 --> 01:37:13,515
Would you show to advantage
in this story, do you think?

1916
01:37:13,517 --> 01:37:16,118
But what do we say
if we're asked?

1917
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,886
There was a confusion in London.

1918
01:37:17,888 --> 01:37:20,857
Monsieur Courbet was ill.

1919
01:37:20,859 --> 01:37:23,493
If I were you,
I wouldn't mention it.

1920
01:37:23,495 --> 01:37:25,293
Not unless they bring it up.

1921
01:37:25,295 --> 01:37:27,162
Quite right.

1922
01:37:32,169 --> 01:37:34,072
There you are.

1923
01:37:35,572 --> 01:37:37,476
I've been looking everywhere.

1924
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:42,878
What's the matter, darling?

1925
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:46,349
Is it something I can help with?

1926
01:37:46,351 --> 01:37:49,484
Judging by last night,
I doubt it.

1927
01:37:50,922 --> 01:37:53,689
I just want to own my own life.

1928
01:37:53,691 --> 01:37:56,525
I want to say things that
I think and do what I like.

1929
01:37:56,527 --> 01:37:58,528
- Don't you now?
- No.

1930
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:01,430
I spend my time entertaining
people who bore me to death

1931
01:38:01,432 --> 01:38:03,698
because they're entitled
to sit at our table.

1932
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:06,335
I attend committees
that I haven't chosen

1933
01:38:06,337 --> 01:38:08,738
because they've chosen me.

1934
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:12,308
I used to have a job
that I loved, but not anymore.

1935
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:14,743
And now my husband won't
be there when I have a baby.

1936
01:38:14,745 --> 01:38:16,746
The woman in the lodge

1937
01:38:16,748 --> 01:38:18,680
is entitled to that,
but I'm not.

1938
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,394
<i>Early warning.</i>

1939
01:38:31,396 --> 01:38:33,229
Their Majesties
are getting ready to leave.

1940
01:38:33,231 --> 01:38:34,829
Very good, milord.

1941
01:38:39,971 --> 01:38:42,971
Darling, what's the matter?

1942
01:38:42,973 --> 01:38:45,440
Nothing you can help with.

1943
01:38:45,442 --> 01:38:47,178
Can't I try?

1944
01:38:49,347 --> 01:38:50,880
Oh, uh, we should go up.

1945
01:38:50,882 --> 01:38:52,480
Their Majesties
are on their way.

1946
01:38:52,482 --> 01:38:54,684
Oh, right.

1947
01:38:54,686 --> 01:38:56,418
Come on.

1948
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:57,655
Up we go.

1949
01:39:01,726 --> 01:39:03,993
So, you're off to London?

1950
01:39:03,995 --> 01:39:06,796
They'll drop me at the station.

1951
01:39:06,798 --> 01:39:09,232
Well, I hope
we can keep in touch.

1952
01:39:09,234 --> 01:39:11,335
I feel I've finally
found a friend.

1953
01:39:12,603 --> 01:39:14,670
Is that what you found,
Mr. Barrow?

1954
01:39:14,672 --> 01:39:15,871
A friend?

1955
01:39:20,878 --> 01:39:23,514
- Their Majesties are going.
- Thanks.

1956
01:39:27,017 --> 01:39:29,018
I want you to have this.

1957
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:31,586
It's not much,
but I've had it for years.

1958
01:39:31,588 --> 01:39:34,023
It'll remind you of me.

1959
01:39:34,025 --> 01:39:35,824
That's the point, isn't it?

1960
01:39:35,826 --> 01:39:38,527
So you can think of me
till we meet again?

1961
01:39:41,331 --> 01:39:43,235
Thank you.

1962
01:39:44,334 --> 01:39:45,667
Mr. Ellis,

1963
01:39:45,669 --> 01:39:48,507
you must come!

1964
01:40:01,018 --> 01:40:03,918
I hope you enjoy your time
at Harewood, sir.

1965
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,055
Yes. I hope so, too.

1966
01:40:07,057 --> 01:40:08,457
It isn't really goodbye

1967
01:40:08,459 --> 01:40:10,059
when we'll see you all
this evening.

1968
01:40:10,061 --> 01:40:11,926
We're looking forward
to the ball.

1969
01:40:11,928 --> 01:40:14,764
Harewood
is such a wonderful house.

1970
01:40:14,766 --> 01:40:17,466
Well, let's mount up, shall we?

1971
01:40:19,704 --> 01:40:22,738
- We'll see you later, Grantham.
- Your Majesty.

1972
01:40:50,435 --> 01:40:52,801
Well done, everyone.
Shall we head back in?

1973
01:40:55,572 --> 01:40:57,973
Mary, what are you
wearing to the ball?

1974
01:40:57,975 --> 01:40:59,108
Oh, I don't know.

1975
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:02,644
Carson, what happened to
the royal servants last night?

1976
01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:04,113
Hard to say, milord.

1977
01:41:04,115 --> 01:41:06,716
They sort of gave up the ghost.

1978
01:41:06,718 --> 01:41:09,452
Well, you managed splendidly.

1979
01:41:09,454 --> 01:41:12,555
Although I could have done
without Molesley's aria.

1980
01:41:12,557 --> 01:41:15,457
But please thank the staff
for saving the day.

1981
01:41:18,463 --> 01:41:20,829
Oh, uh, Mrs. Bates?

1982
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:23,899
- Excuse me.
- Can I ask you something?

1983
01:41:23,901 --> 01:41:26,635
What did you give
Monsieur Courbet?

1984
01:41:26,637 --> 01:41:29,003
A double dose
of a sleeping draught

1985
01:41:29,005 --> 01:41:31,976
from Mr. Bakewell's...
in his tea.

1986
01:41:36,981 --> 01:41:40,616
I'm afraid I made rather a fool
of myself last night.

1987
01:41:40,618 --> 01:41:43,786
You could never be a fool to me.

1988
01:41:43,788 --> 01:41:45,653
Do you mean that, really?

1989
01:41:45,655 --> 01:41:47,021
I do.

1990
01:41:47,023 --> 01:41:49,660
And I think you know how much.

1991
01:42:00,036 --> 01:42:01,936
You're right, Mrs. Patmore.

1992
01:42:01,938 --> 01:42:04,774
It's time I started
to plan my wedding.

1993
01:42:04,776 --> 01:42:06,775
Well, I don't know
what took you so long.

1994
01:42:06,777 --> 01:42:09,778
I wasn't sure before,
but I am now.

1995
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:12,448
Well, that's good to hear.

1996
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:14,850
I'm happy, Mrs. Patmore.

1997
01:42:14,852 --> 01:42:17,853
I don't often say that,
but I am.

1998
01:42:25,695 --> 01:42:28,430
Are you very shocked by it all?

1999
01:42:28,432 --> 01:42:31,033
I should be. Interfering
with the palace staff

2000
01:42:31,035 --> 01:42:33,735
on a royal visit...
and me part of it, to boot.

2001
01:42:33,737 --> 01:42:35,171
I don't know what came over me.

2002
01:42:35,173 --> 01:42:37,473
But?

2003
01:42:37,475 --> 01:42:39,140
They had it coming to them,
Elsie.

2004
01:42:39,142 --> 01:42:42,010
Let's face it,
they had it coming in spades.

2005
01:42:42,012 --> 01:42:43,778
Hello.

2006
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:45,747
What's this?

2007
01:42:57,527 --> 01:42:59,194
Welcome back, Mr. Talbot.

2008
01:42:59,196 --> 01:43:01,729
Hello, Carson. Mrs. Hughes.

2009
01:43:01,731 --> 01:43:03,466
Do you know where
I'll find Lady Mary?

2010
01:43:03,468 --> 01:43:05,033
After everything that's gone on,

2011
01:43:05,035 --> 01:43:07,536
I should think
she'll be lying down, sir.

2012
01:43:07,538 --> 01:43:09,537
They all will be.

2013
01:43:09,539 --> 01:43:10,905
Sounds ominous.

2014
01:43:14,145 --> 01:43:17,246
That's nice that he's back
in time for the ball.

2015
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:21,082
And thank the Lord
we don't have to organize it.

2016
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:38,067
Oh, darling, you don't know
what we've lived though.

2017
01:43:38,069 --> 01:43:39,868
I'm sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

2018
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:42,104
It was the first ship after
the last meeting, I promise.

2019
01:43:42,106 --> 01:43:43,805
Oh, never mind.
You're here now.

2020
01:43:43,807 --> 01:43:45,841
And I don't have to go
to the ball alone

2021
01:43:45,843 --> 01:43:47,609
like a sad little wallflower.

2022
01:43:47,611 --> 01:43:49,043
Well, I'll only come
if you promise

2023
01:43:49,045 --> 01:43:52,046
- to dance with me nonstop.
- Oh, it's a deal.

2024
01:44:08,298 --> 01:44:10,165
- Good evening.
- Your Majesty.

2025
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:12,167
I suppose Maud has brought

2026
01:44:12,169 --> 01:44:14,569
that scheming little minx
with her.

2027
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:16,271
If you continue in this vein,

2028
01:44:16,273 --> 01:44:18,006
you will only make yourself
look stupid.

2029
01:44:18,008 --> 01:44:20,943
- What-what do you mean?
- What I say.

2030
01:44:20,945 --> 01:44:22,845
Are you keeping something
from me?

2031
01:44:22,847 --> 01:44:24,313
Come with me.

2032
01:44:24,315 --> 01:44:25,784
What?

2033
01:44:27,852 --> 01:44:29,251
Why aren't you happy?

2034
01:44:29,253 --> 01:44:31,019
I thought you'd be delirious.

2035
01:44:31,021 --> 01:44:34,723
Well, we are happy,
if you mean it. Very.

2036
01:44:34,725 --> 01:44:36,792
But how will you manage Henry?

2037
01:44:36,794 --> 01:44:39,761
By altering the way
we manage each other.

2038
01:44:39,763 --> 01:44:41,262
And it may not be easy,

2039
01:44:41,264 --> 01:44:44,033
but I've decided
that I'm staying with him.

2040
01:44:44,035 --> 01:44:46,301
I just don't understand
what changed your mind.

2041
01:44:46,303 --> 01:44:48,304
It was something
Mr. Branson said

2042
01:44:48,306 --> 01:44:50,605
about deciding what matters.

2043
01:44:50,607 --> 01:44:53,609
For me, the Crown matters more
than any of us.

2044
01:44:53,611 --> 01:44:55,210
I can make it work.

2045
01:44:55,212 --> 01:44:57,979
Branson? The Irish republican?

2046
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:00,181
Oh, you're well-informed.

2047
01:45:00,183 --> 01:45:02,016
I'm better informed
than you know.

2048
01:45:02,018 --> 01:45:04,353
So, he persuaded you to do this?

2049
01:45:04,355 --> 01:45:06,854
Oh, we were talking
after the parade.

2050
01:45:06,856 --> 01:45:08,592
Oh, there he is.

2051
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,225
Ah.

2052
01:45:11,227 --> 01:45:14,762
Say something nice. Please.

2053
01:45:14,764 --> 01:45:17,232
I have to say, it's
been very quiet without you.

2054
01:45:17,234 --> 01:45:19,768
Mr. Branson.

2055
01:45:19,770 --> 01:45:23,973
I wish we had spoken more
while we were at Downton Abbey.

2056
01:45:23,975 --> 01:45:26,074
- Do you, sir?
- Certainly.

2057
01:45:26,076 --> 01:45:29,310
I believe I have more than one
reason to be grateful to you.

2058
01:45:29,312 --> 01:45:31,081
More than one.

2059
01:45:37,855 --> 01:45:39,287
What was that all about?

2060
01:45:39,289 --> 01:45:41,256
I'll tell you when we're alone.

2061
01:45:41,258 --> 01:45:43,257
Why more than one?

2062
01:45:44,395 --> 01:45:45,860
Who is she?

2063
01:45:45,862 --> 01:45:47,261
That's Princess Mary.

2064
01:45:47,263 --> 01:45:49,364
She was at Downton
for the parade yesterday.

2065
01:45:49,366 --> 01:45:50,899
Didn't you see her?

2066
01:45:50,901 --> 01:45:52,301
Not at the parade.

2067
01:45:52,303 --> 01:45:55,173
But I saw her afterwards
at the tea.

2068
01:46:11,288 --> 01:46:13,855
So, you see,
she has Brompton blood,

2069
01:46:13,857 --> 01:46:15,957
albeit from an unusual angle.

2070
01:46:15,959 --> 01:46:18,092
Why did you not say this
long ago?

2071
01:46:18,094 --> 01:46:20,194
It seemed too great a leap
for you.

2072
01:46:20,196 --> 01:46:22,730
Well, who do you think I am?

2073
01:46:22,732 --> 01:46:25,434
Some maiden aunt
who's never left the village?

2074
01:46:25,436 --> 01:46:27,903
Obviously not.

2075
01:46:27,905 --> 01:46:31,974
Well, don't think I approve,
because I don't.

2076
01:46:31,976 --> 01:46:34,810
But at least I understand.

2077
01:46:34,812 --> 01:46:37,712
Does Miss Smith know the truth?

2078
01:46:37,714 --> 01:46:39,715
Yes, she does.

2079
01:46:39,717 --> 01:46:42,150
When I get home,
I will hire another maid,

2080
01:46:42,152 --> 01:46:43,885
and Lucy can be my companion.

2081
01:46:43,887 --> 01:46:45,186
Well, that's much more suitable.

2082
01:46:45,188 --> 01:46:47,189
And I'm afraid
you'll dislike it,

2083
01:46:47,191 --> 01:46:49,390
but she says
that she and Tom Branson

2084
01:46:49,392 --> 01:46:51,126
have agreed to correspond.

2085
01:46:51,128 --> 01:46:52,694
Dislike it?

2086
01:46:52,696 --> 01:46:54,930
I will lick the stamps myself.

2087
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:02,304
You are amazing, Violet.

2088
01:47:02,306 --> 01:47:04,006
You haven't won, you know.

2089
01:47:04,008 --> 01:47:06,108
I don't believe in defeat.

2090
01:47:06,110 --> 01:47:07,975
But we can hammer this out

2091
01:47:07,977 --> 01:47:10,479
when you come back to stay,
you and Lucy,

2092
01:47:10,481 --> 01:47:13,015
when you've finished
your tour of duty.

2093
01:47:13,017 --> 01:47:16,154
You mean I am once more
a member of this family?

2094
01:47:21,459 --> 01:47:24,193
She's right, you know.
Brompton is gone.

2095
01:47:24,195 --> 01:47:26,862
And you must all learn
to live with it.

2096
01:47:26,864 --> 01:47:29,765
I think we can get it back.

2097
01:47:29,767 --> 01:47:32,234
For Tom, at least.

2098
01:47:32,236 --> 01:47:35,203
That's why we need the girl
back here.

2099
01:47:35,205 --> 01:47:37,405
Oh, Violet.

2100
01:47:37,407 --> 01:47:41,143
After all these years,
you still astonish me.

2101
01:47:41,145 --> 01:47:43,278
Oh, good.
I'm glad I'm a revelation

2102
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,012
and not a disappointment.

2103
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:50,985
- It's very important.
- Quite right.

2104
01:47:50,987 --> 01:47:53,154
- Oh, there they are now. Do ask.
- Ah, yes.

2105
01:47:53,156 --> 01:47:54,823
There you are, Hexham.

2106
01:47:54,825 --> 01:47:57,926
I'm sad you can't be part
of the prince's tour,

2107
01:47:57,928 --> 01:48:00,095
but we'll find something else
for you to do.

2108
01:48:00,097 --> 01:48:02,363
- What?
- Sir, I-I didn't, um...

2109
01:48:02,365 --> 01:48:04,867
I understood why not, uh,

2110
01:48:04,869 --> 01:48:07,469
as soon as Her Majesty
had explained it to me.

2111
01:48:07,471 --> 01:48:09,537
Congratulations to you both.

2112
01:48:24,888 --> 01:48:26,889
You're looking very sunny tonight.

2113
01:48:26,891 --> 01:48:29,024
I'm happy.
Why? Does it bother you?

2114
01:48:29,026 --> 01:48:31,460
No. But tell me,
what are you playing at

2115
01:48:31,462 --> 01:48:34,195
- with Tom and Cousin Maud's famous maid?
- What do you mean?

2116
01:48:34,197 --> 01:48:35,930
I heard you
at dinner last night.

2117
01:48:35,932 --> 01:48:37,299
What are you up to?

2118
01:48:37,301 --> 01:48:39,568
You know she'll inherit
the Brompton estate.

2119
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:42,171
- Well, so Mama told me.
- Well, then,

2120
01:48:42,173 --> 01:48:45,541
wouldn't you like Tom
to have a proper establishment?

2121
01:48:45,543 --> 01:48:48,210
Oh, you devious cat.

2122
01:48:48,212 --> 01:48:50,444
Will they be happy?
Do you think they will?

2123
01:48:50,446 --> 01:48:53,247
Oh, I just want a word
with Granny.

2124
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:08,063
How long were you
planning to wait

2125
01:49:08,065 --> 01:49:10,465
before you told us why
you really went up to London

2126
01:49:10,467 --> 01:49:12,033
on Wednesday?

2127
01:49:12,035 --> 01:49:15,537
Since you ask,
I haven't decided.

2128
01:49:15,539 --> 01:49:17,038
So, if I tell you now,

2129
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,073
will you promise
to keep it to yourself?

2130
01:49:19,075 --> 01:49:20,975
I promise.

2131
01:49:20,977 --> 01:49:23,244
Very well. I...

2132
01:49:23,246 --> 01:49:26,314
I had some medical tests
a few weeks ago,

2133
01:49:26,316 --> 01:49:29,952
and I went up to London
to hear the results.

2134
01:49:29,954 --> 01:49:32,386
- Yes?
- And, uh,

2135
01:49:32,388 --> 01:49:36,127
I may not have long to live.

2136
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:39,560
It won't be too quick.

2137
01:49:39,562 --> 01:49:41,262
But, of course,

2138
01:49:41,264 --> 01:49:43,868
you can never get
a London doctor to be precise.

2139
01:49:44,968 --> 01:49:46,368
- Oh, Granny.
- No.

2140
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:47,869
No, no.

2141
01:49:47,871 --> 01:49:50,372
My dear, save your tears
for something sad.

2142
01:49:50,374 --> 01:49:53,140
Th-There's nothing sad here.

2143
01:49:53,142 --> 01:49:56,612
I have lived a privileged
and an interesting life,

2144
01:49:56,614 --> 01:49:59,081
and now it's...

2145
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,983
it's time to go.

2146
01:50:00,985 --> 01:50:03,085
I'm leaving the family

2147
01:50:03,087 --> 01:50:06,287
and the place that I treasure

2148
01:50:06,289 --> 01:50:08,392
in talented hands.

2149
01:50:10,127 --> 01:50:12,127
- Well, I know Papa will be...
- Oh, no, no.

2150
01:50:12,129 --> 01:50:13,595
No, I don't mean your father.

2151
01:50:13,597 --> 01:50:15,930
I... No, I-I love him dearly.

2152
01:50:15,932 --> 01:50:18,667
No, I... I mean you.

2153
01:50:18,669 --> 01:50:21,940
You are the future of Downton.

2154
01:50:23,374 --> 01:50:25,540
But I have such doubts, Granny.

2155
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:27,943
Are we right
to keep it all going

2156
01:50:27,945 --> 01:50:29,978
when the world it was built for

2157
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:32,680
is fading
with every day that passes?

2158
01:50:32,682 --> 01:50:35,516
Will George and Caroline
still be living that life?

2159
01:50:35,518 --> 01:50:37,985
- Are we living it now?
- No, no.

2160
01:50:37,987 --> 01:50:41,924
Our ancestors
lived different lives from us,

2161
01:50:41,926 --> 01:50:44,559
and our descendants
will live differently again,

2162
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:48,266
but Downton Abbey
will be part of them.

2163
01:50:49,365 --> 01:50:50,933
Won't be the same without you.

2164
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:52,567
Of course it will.

2165
01:50:52,569 --> 01:50:55,938
You'll take over
from where I left off.

2166
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:58,140
You'll be
the frightening old lady

2167
01:50:58,142 --> 01:51:00,074
keeping everyone up to the mark.

2168
01:51:00,076 --> 01:51:02,411
Thank you very much.

2169
01:51:02,413 --> 01:51:04,246
You will, my darling.

2170
01:51:04,248 --> 01:51:07,282
And you'll do it wonderfully.

2171
01:51:07,284 --> 01:51:11,552
You're the best of me
that will live on.

2172
01:51:11,554 --> 01:51:13,988
Hurrah.

2173
01:51:15,325 --> 01:51:17,326
Oh, Granny, I love you so much.

2174
01:51:17,328 --> 01:51:20,095
No, shh.

2175
01:51:20,097 --> 01:51:21,563
But should you be here tonight?

2176
01:51:21,565 --> 01:51:23,230
Won't you be worn out?

2177
01:51:23,232 --> 01:51:25,533
Oh, Mary, I can't spend
the rest of my life

2178
01:51:25,535 --> 01:51:27,702
in a shower of
"How are you feeling?"

2179
01:51:27,704 --> 01:51:29,704
and "Are you quite well?"
Oh, no.

2180
01:51:29,706 --> 01:51:33,475
The point is...
I'll be fine until I'm not.

2181
01:51:33,477 --> 01:51:35,176
That's all there is to it.

2182
01:51:35,178 --> 01:51:37,179
Ah, there you are.

2183
01:51:37,181 --> 01:51:39,314
- The dancing's starting.
- Ah.

2184
01:51:39,316 --> 01:51:40,983
You mustn't miss it.

2185
01:51:40,985 --> 01:51:42,717
No. Thank you.

2186
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:49,056
Thank you.

2187
01:51:49,058 --> 01:51:52,496
You know, you'll always be
with us, Granny.

2188
01:51:53,629 --> 01:51:55,997
Staring from every picture,

2189
01:51:55,999 --> 01:52:00,202
talking from every book,
as long as the house stands.

2190
01:52:00,204 --> 01:52:02,537
Sounds very exhausting.

2191
01:52:02,539 --> 01:52:05,239
Do you know, I think...

2192
01:52:05,241 --> 01:52:07,743
I should prefer
to rest in peace.

2193
01:52:09,445 --> 01:52:11,345
Come on.

2194
01:52:51,054 --> 01:52:53,055
Darling.

2195
01:53:02,732 --> 01:53:04,198
What is it you want?

2196
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,201
We have things in common.

2197
01:53:06,203 --> 01:53:08,269
The boys, horses, racing.

2198
01:53:08,271 --> 01:53:11,206
And there must be more
if we look for it.

2199
01:53:11,208 --> 01:53:13,574
I want us to be friends.

2200
01:53:13,576 --> 01:53:15,676
Well, we'll have to see.

2201
01:53:15,678 --> 01:53:17,378
No, dear.

2202
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:19,146
We'll have to change.

2203
01:53:19,148 --> 01:53:20,448
Both of us.

2204
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:22,184
How did that happen?

2205
01:53:22,186 --> 01:53:23,452
Was it you, Mama?

2206
01:53:23,454 --> 01:53:24,653
How did you do it?

2207
01:53:24,655 --> 01:53:26,121
Simple.

2208
01:53:26,123 --> 01:53:27,855
Bertie asked the king.

2209
01:53:27,857 --> 01:53:29,591
I asked the queen.

2210
01:53:35,632 --> 01:53:37,765
I do love our adventures.

2211
01:53:37,767 --> 01:53:40,668
But isn't it fun
when they're over?

2212
01:53:56,520 --> 01:53:58,185
What are you doing here?

2213
01:53:58,187 --> 01:54:01,122
I wanted to see the dancing,
so I thought I'd pretend

2214
01:54:01,124 --> 01:54:03,390
I was bringing Lady Bagshaw
a handkerchief.

2215
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,393
I can give it to her,
if you'd like.

2216
01:54:09,866 --> 01:54:11,835
I wish you could dance with me.

2217
01:54:48,605 --> 01:54:50,337
I've got a question for you.

2218
01:54:50,339 --> 01:54:51,540
Hmm?

2219
01:54:51,542 --> 01:54:53,207
You'd never want
to leave Downton

2220
01:54:53,209 --> 01:54:55,710
and start up somewhere else,
would you?

2221
01:54:55,712 --> 01:54:57,345
And tell me truthfully.

2222
01:54:57,347 --> 01:54:58,412
What brought this on?

2223
01:54:58,414 --> 01:54:59,680
Just tell me.

2224
01:54:59,682 --> 01:55:01,416
Leave Downton?

2225
01:55:01,418 --> 01:55:04,155
I think we're stuck with it,
aren't we?

2226
01:55:05,222 --> 01:55:06,590
Yes.

2227
01:55:07,691 --> 01:55:10,692
Yes, I believe we are.

2228
01:56:34,343 --> 01:56:36,344
We shouldn't come out this way.

2229
01:56:36,346 --> 01:56:38,613
Oh, they won't mind.

2230
01:56:38,615 --> 01:56:41,049
Not this once.

2231
01:56:41,051 --> 01:56:44,985
Well, they've gone,
and Downton is still standing.

2232
01:56:44,987 --> 01:56:47,721
Elsie, a hundred years from now,

2233
01:56:47,723 --> 01:56:49,991
Downton will still be standing.

2234
01:56:49,993 --> 01:56:53,231
And the Crawleys
will still be here.

2235
01:56:54,498 --> 01:56:57,532
And that is a promise.

2236
01:56:57,534 --> 01:56:59,833
We'll see, Charlie.

2237
01:56:59,835 --> 01:57:01,635
