00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,251
<i>A famous man once said,</i>

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,091
<i>"We create our own demons."</i>

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,642
<i>Who said that?
What does that even mean?</i>

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,609
<i>Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</i>

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,330
<i>So, now, he was famous</i>

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,881
<i>and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</i>

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,605
<i>I don't, uh...</i>

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,802
<i>I'm going to start again.</i>

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,482
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,371
<i>♪ Yo listen up here's a story</i>

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,809
<i>♪ About a little guy that
lives in a blue world</i>

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,645
<i>♪ And all day and all night
and everything he sees</i>

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,009
<i>♪ Is just blue like him
inside and outside</i>

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,289
<i>♪ Blue is his house
with a blue little window</i>

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,850
<i>♪ And a blue Corvette</i>

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,402
<i>♪ And everything is blue
for him and himself</i>

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,329
<i>♪ And everybody around</i>

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,846
<i>♪ 'Cause he ain't got nobody... ♪</i>

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,880
Half hour till the ball drops.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,201
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,520
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,290
I gave a speech? How was it?

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,646
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,761
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,841
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,809
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,927
Probably back in your room

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,126
because I also want to
see your research.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,201
Okay, you can see my research,

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,248
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,560
Mr Stark.

32
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,607
Ho Yinsen.

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,681
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,767
- Come here.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,083
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,646
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,641
- You're a heart doctor.

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,047
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,769
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,489
<i>It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.</i>

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,369
<i>- The old days.</i>
- Mr Stark!

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,847
<i>I never thought they
would come back to bite me.</i>

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,921
<i>Why would they?</i>

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,684
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,364
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,641
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,241
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,768
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,921
Yeah, we're full.

50
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,410
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,641
What floor you going to, pal?

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,210
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,481
The ground floor, actually,

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,483
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,401
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,051
- Uh...
- She'll take both.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,401
One to throw away and one to not call.

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,167
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

59
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,720
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,407
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,164
Thank you, I'll call you.

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,127
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,441
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,280
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

65
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,890
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

66
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,041
You know what I'm talking about?

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,121
I'll see you up there.

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,611
Damn betcha.

69
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,326
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,726
Well, it was.

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,529
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,601
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,041
...and chemically recode it.

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,526
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

75
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,721
...operating system...

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
- ...of a living organism.
- Exactly.

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,561
- Yes.
- Wow.

78
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,641
Is that...
Can you...

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,245
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,050
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,129
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,244
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...

83
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,765
Leave her ficus alone.

84
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,927
Because...
And, no, seriously, don't.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,001
And you're starting with plants.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,121
- For now, yeah.
- Huh.

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,442
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

88
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,160
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,446
Exactly, exactly.

90
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,640
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,046
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,610
...even limb regrowth.

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,485
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

94
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,801
Wow.

95
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,486
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,562
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,689
You almost bought it, didn't you?

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,324
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,686
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,887
- The what?
- Down!

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,323
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

102
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,970
- We're good.
- Stay down.

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,168
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.

104
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,401
What the hell was that?

105
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,809
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,451
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,687
It's not Y2K.

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,524
- Hey! Happy New Year!

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,841
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,286
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,441
- You good?
- Yeah.

112
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,000
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

113
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,929
<i>So, why am I telling you this?</i>

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,809
<i>Because I had just created demons</i>

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,364
<i>and I didn't even know it.</i>

116
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,763
<i>- Yeah, those were good times.</i>

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,449
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

118
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,970
<i>After a brief soirée in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</i>

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,008
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

120
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,764
<i>These days, I'm a changed man.</i>

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,927
<i>Forty-six.</i>

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,764
<i>- I'm different now.</i>

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,001
<i>I'm... Well...</i>

124
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,525
<i>- Forty-seven.</i>
<i>- You know who I am.</i>

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,601
Ow!

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,605
<i>Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</i>

127
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,125
No. Forty-eight.

128
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,164
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,241
<i>As you wish, sir.</i>

130
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,410
<i>I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</i>

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,090
Which I will.

132
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,801
All right, let's do this.

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,801
Hi, DUM-E.

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,241
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

135
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,209
Hey. Hey!

136
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,722
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

137
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,087
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,085
<i>Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</i>

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,001
Focus up, ladies.

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,925
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,407
<i>I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</i>

142
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,444
<i>of your bouncing,

143
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480

All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

161
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,681
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

162
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,121
- Slow it down just a...

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,161
...little bit.

164
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

165
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,601
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

166
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,241
I'm the best.

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,850
<i>As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</i>

168
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,808
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long time

169
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>I didn't think it could get any worse.</i>

170
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,281
<i>Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</i>

00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,608

174
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,771
<i>America.</i>

175
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,040
<i>Ready for another lesson?</i>

176
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,368
<i>In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</i>

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,689
<i>until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</i>

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,050
<i>Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</i>

179
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,444
<i>and claim their land.</i>

180
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,404
<i>39 hours ago,</i>

181
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,364
<i>the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</i>

182
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,682
<i>I... I... I did that.</i>

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,126
<i>A quaint military church</i>

184
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,682
<i>filled with wives and children,
of course.</i>

185
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,728
<i>The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.</i>

186
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,041
<i>The braves were</i> away.

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,605
<i>President Ems.</i>

188
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,048
<i>You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</i>

189
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,845
<i>And now you've missed me again.</i>

190
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,803
<i>You know who I am.</i>

191
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,969
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

192
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,006
<i>And you'll never see me coming.</i>

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
<i>Now that we seem to be back,</i>

194
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,205
<i>let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</i>

195
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,169
<i>American airwaves were hijacked...</i>

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,851
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,600
<i>All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</i>

198
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,009
<i>Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</i>

199
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,203
<i>is a newly minted resource.</i>

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,569
<i>I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

201
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,763
<i>The American people
will soon know him</i>

202
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,530
<i>as the tron Patriot.</i>

203
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,487
<i>And how is President Ems responding?</i>

204
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,722
<i>By taking the guy
they call War Machine</i>

205
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,450
<i>and giving him a paint job.</i>

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,207
<i>The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</i>

207
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,171
<i>Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."</i>

208
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,164
<i>You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</i>

209
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,323
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

210
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,130
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

211
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,611
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
All right?
This sends a better message.

213
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,523
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

214
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,047
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,685
It's classified information, Tony.

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,248
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

217
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,568
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.

218
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,723
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

219
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,927
There's no bomb casings.

220
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,328
You know I can help.
Just ask.

221
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,130
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,890
I got bomb disposal.

223
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,564
It catches explosions in mid-air.

224
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,165
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,891
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

226
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,560
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,721
You're going to come at me like that?

228
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,561
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,161
...tator.

230
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,765
Do you mind signing my drawing?

231
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,007
- If Richard doesn't mind.

232
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,206
Are you all right with this, Dick?

233
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,884
Yeah. Fine with me.

234
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,323
- What's your name?
- Erin.

235
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,444
I loved you in <i>A Christmas Story,</i>
by the way.

236
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,082
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

237
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,005
After New York, aliens... Come on.

238
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,764
They need to look strong.

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,004
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

240
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,884
- it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,530
- I get it.
- It's American business.

242
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,443
That's why I said I got it.

243
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,611
- Are you okay?

244
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,281
I broke the crayon.

245
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,124
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

246
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Take it easy. Tony.

247
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,208
How did you
get out of the wormhole?

248
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,967
- Wait a minute. Tony!

249
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
- What did you say?
- Tony.

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,769
Sorry.

251
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,285
I'm just checking on the suit.

252
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,441
Okay.

253
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,126
Check the heart.

254
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,645
Is it the brain?

255
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,644
<i>No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</i>

256
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,564
Okay, so I was poisoned?

257
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,962
<i>My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</i>

258
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,606
- Me?

259
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,764
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

260
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,928
Sorry, I gotta split.

261
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,287
Badge.

262
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,682
- Badge.

263
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,205
Come on, badge.

264
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,131
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

265
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,487
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

266
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,720
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,811
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

268
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,485
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

269
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,644
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

270
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,041
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

271
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,611
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

272
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,966
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

273
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,650
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

274
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,451
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?

275
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,250
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

276
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,845
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

277
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,843
- ...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

278
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,442
...we've had a rise in
staff complaints of 300%.

279
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,601
Thank you.

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,246
It's not a compliment.

281
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,560
It's not...
It is a compliment.

282
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,210
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

283
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,481
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

284
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,528
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

285
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,051
- Thank you.
Did you clear this 4: -00 with me?

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,929
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

287
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,361
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

288
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,851
How so?

289
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

290
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,567
so it's a little awkward.

291
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,484
I don't like the sound of that.

292
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,481
Pepper.

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,441
Killian?

294
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,284
You look great.

295
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,965
You look really great.

296
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,327
God, you look great.

297
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,561
What on earth have you been doing?

298
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,881
Nothing fancy.

299
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,288
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

300
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,329
And please, call me Aldrich.

301
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,562
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

302
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,121
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.

303
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,760
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.

304
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,960
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.

305
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,845
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

306
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,565
Hey, guy.

307
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,241
Merry Christmas.

308
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,131
After years dodging
the President's ban

309
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,561
on "immoral" biotech research,

310
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,971
my think tank

311
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,126
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,085
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

313
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

314
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,123
Regard the human brain.

315
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,640
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.

316
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,569
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

317
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,529
But if I do that...

318
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,124
That's the brain.

319
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,643
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

320
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,051
Wow, that's amazing.

321
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,810
Thanks, it's mine.

322
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,166
What?

323
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,131
This. You're inside my head.

324
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,289
It's a...
It's a live feed.

325
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,210
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

326
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,001
Come on.

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,001
Now, pinch my arm.

328
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,162
- I can take it. Pinch me.

329
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,600
What is that?

330
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,009
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.

331
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,604
But this is what I wanted to show you.

332
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,364
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential

333
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,364
and it goes here.

334
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,649
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

335
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,530
is that our mind,

336
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,125
our entire DNA, in fact,

337
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,123
is destined to be upgraded.

338
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,361
Wow.

339
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,160
Oh, wait...

340
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,044
- Uh...

341
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,408
- Hello?

342
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,521
- Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?

343
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,205
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

344
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

345
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,807
What, harassing interns?

346
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,166
<i>Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</i>

347
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,241
<i>when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</i>

348
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,288
<i>- They would laugh in my face.</i>

349
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,761
<i>I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</i>

350
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,684
<i>Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</i>

351
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,569
What's going on? Fill me in.

352
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,846
<i>- For real?</i>
- Yeah.

353
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,525
<i>All right. So, she's meeting
up with this scientist.</i>

354
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,250
<i>- Rich guy. Handsome.</i>
- Right.

355
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,727
<i>I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</i>

356
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,801
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

357
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,245
<i>Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</i>

358
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,841
<i>Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</i>

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,201
<i>Where were we in '99?</i>

360
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,566
<i>- The science conference?</i>
- Um...

361
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,209
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

362
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,765
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

363
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,365
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

364
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,090
<i>At first, it was fine.
They were tanking business.</i>

365
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,323
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

366
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,164
- His what?
<i>- Big brain.</i>

367
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,801
<i>And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</i>

368
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,890
Hold on. See?

369
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,761
<i>Look at what? You, watching them?</i>

370
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,564
<i>Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</i>

371
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,491
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

372
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,290
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

373
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,606
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

374
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,446
<i>Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</i>

375
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,120
<i>All right?
I don't work for you.</i>

376
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,649
<i>And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</i>

377
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,767
<i>He's shifty.</i>

378
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,841
- Relax.
<i>- Seriously?</i>

379
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,445
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

380
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,846
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

381
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,605
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

382
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,450
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

383
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,965
and you're just ignoring her.

384
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,121
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.

385
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,531
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

386
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,281
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

387
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,880
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

388
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,607
I miss you, Happy.

389
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,802
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

390
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
<i>Now you're off with the super-friends.</i>

391
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,406
<i>I don't know
what's going on with you any more.</i>

392
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,561
<i>- The world's getting weird.</i>
- Hey!

393
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,641
I hate to cut you off.

394
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,721
- Do you have your Taser on you?
<i>- Why?</i>

395
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,007
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

396
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,162
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

397
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,566
<i>Yeah, nice.</i>

398
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,489
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,608
and recode its DNA.

400
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,689
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.

401
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,481
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.

402
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,247
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

403
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,004
Tony, Tony.

404
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,807
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

405
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,927
He turned me down.

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,447
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne

407
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,808
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more

408
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,848
and who has slightly less of an ego.

409
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,931
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

410
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,404
As much as I'd like to help you.

411
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,002
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

412
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,805
But then,
as my father used to say,

413
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,645
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

414
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,205
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.

415
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,691
And I have no idea what it means.

416
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,042
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

417
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,690
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

418
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,441
Happy.

419
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,644
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

420
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,490
Yes, I just, um...

421
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,962
God, I forgot my other things, so...

422
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,165
I'm just gonna...

423
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,921
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

424
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,365
What the...
What is that?

425
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,968
You're wearing this in the house now?

426
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,650
What is that, like, Mark 15?

427
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,451
Uh, yeah.

428
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,529
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

429
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,807
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

430
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,609
Just breaking it in.

431
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,523
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag

432
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,801
- at first, so...

433
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,042
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

434
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,486
Yes, I did. I...

435
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,086
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

436
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,208
Is it gonna fit through the door?

437
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,601
Well, actually,
it's a good question.

438
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,247
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

439
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,765
- Okay.
- So, uh...

440
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,530
Tense? Good day? Huh?

441
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,285
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

442
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,967
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

443
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,161
Did I like it?

444
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,011
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

445
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,890
I appreciate the thought very much.

446
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,562
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

447
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,449
Huh...

448
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,366
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,488
You want to just kiss it on the...

450
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,324
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.

451
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,402
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

452
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,086
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?

453
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,810
Crowbar, yeah.

454
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,247
Oh! Except there's been
a radiation leak.

455
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,243
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

456
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,721
At least, let me get you

457
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,450
like, a hazmat suit you can...

458
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,081
- A Geiger counter or
something like that.

459
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,127
Busted.

460
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,809
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.

461
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,327
You ate without me already?
On date night?

462
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,440
- He was just...
- You mean you.

463
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,171
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were just hosting you...

464
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,170
- ...while I finished up a little work.
- Uh-huh.

465
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,566
And yes, I had a quick bite.

466
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,607
I didn't know if you were coming home

467
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,521
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

468
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,570
- What?
- What?

469
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,246
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

470
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,321
Happy was concerned.

471
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,526
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.

472
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,760
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.

473
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,280
Come on. Pep?

474
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,361
Hey, I admit it.

475
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,490
My fault. Sorry.

476
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,685
I'm a piping hot mess.

477
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,891
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

478
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,449
Nothing's been the same
since New York.

479
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,007
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.

480
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,682
You experience things

481
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,961
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

482
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,645
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

483
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,160
The only reason I haven't cracked up

484
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,164
is probably because you moved in.

485
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,641
Which is great.

486
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,290
I love you. I'm lucky.

487
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,325
But honey, I can't sleep.

488
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,729
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

489
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,564
I tinker. I...

490
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,483
Threat is imminent.

491
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,201
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

492
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,009
That's you.

493
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,321
And my suits, they're, uh...

494
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,401
Machines.

495
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,250
They're part of me.

496
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,524
A distraction.

497
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,685
Maybe.

498
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,366
I'm gonna take a shower.

499
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,169
Okay.

500
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,601
And you're gonna join me.

501
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,765
Better.

502
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,531
- Tony.

503
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,646
- Tony. Tony.

504
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,050
To...

505
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,321
Power down!

506
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,321
I must have called it in my sleep.

507
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,687
That's not supposed to happen.

508
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,208
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

509
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,084
Can we just... Just let me...

510
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,606
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

511
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,808
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

512
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,167
Tinker with that.

513
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,845
Can you regulate?

514
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,967
Yes, I can regulate.

515
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,166
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

516
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,131
- It's a decent batch.

517
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,680
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.

518
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,162
I mean, for understanding.

519
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,721
I'm sorry, buddy.

520
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,125
What are you doing, buddy?

521
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,565
You out by yourself?
A little date night?

522
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,721
Seeing your favourite chick flick,
maybe?

523
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,004
Yeah, a little movie
called The Party's Over,

524
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,969
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

525
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,041
Here's the ticket.

526
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,481
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

527
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,967
Savin!

528
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,121
Help!

529
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,009
Help me!

530
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,170

531
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,605
<i>They look Chinese.</i>

532
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,570
<i>They sound Chinese.</i>

533
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,766
<i>But they're actually
an American invention.</i>

534
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,641
<i>Which is why they're hollow,

535
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,882
<i>and leave a bad taste in the mouth.</i>

<i>My disciples just destroyed

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,131
<i>The Chinese Theatre.</i>

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,721
<i>Mr President,</i>

539
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,087
<i>I know this must be getting frustrating.</i>

540
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,482
<i>But this season of terror
is drawing to a dose.</i>

541
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,728
<i>And don't worry,</i>

542
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,604
<i>- the big one is coming.</i>

<i>Your graduation.</i>

544
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,846
- Hi.
- Oh!

545
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,804
Do you mind leaving that on?

546
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,681
Sure.

547
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,124
Sunday nights. PBS. <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

548
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,844
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

549
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,568
One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.

550
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,846
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

551
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,049
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

552
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,168
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

553
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,880
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

554
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,524
His reaction
to the latest attack.

555
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,521
- Mr Stark, hi there.

556
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,522
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

557
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,730
Anything else you can tell us?

558
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,804
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

559
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,641
I'm just saying.

560
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,808
Is that what you want?

561
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,650
Here's a little holiday greeting

562
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,161
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

563
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,641
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

564
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,369
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

565
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,523
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

566
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,845
that you just died, pal.

567
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,044
I'm gonna come get the body.

568
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,886
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

569
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,205
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

570
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,127
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

571
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,682
10880 Malibu Point.

572
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,967
90265.

573
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,883
I'll leave the door unlocked.

574
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
That's what you wanted, right?

575
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,044
- Bill me.

576
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,449
<i>I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,</i>

577
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,770
<i>drawn from
S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.</i>

<i>Initiating virtual crime scene

579
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,360
Okay. What have we got here?

580
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,764
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "advisor to the king."

581
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,162
South American insurgency tactics.

582
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,686
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

583
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,129
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.

584
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,761
<i>The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3, 000 degrees Celsius.</i>

585
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,487
<i>Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.</i>

586
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,245
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

587
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,321
<i>No, sir.</i>

588
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,361
Talk to me, Happy.

589
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,003
When is a bomb not a bomb?

590
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,765
Any military victims?

591
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,081
<i>Not according to public record, sir.</i>

592
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,288
Bring up the thermogenic
signatures again.

593
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,089
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

594
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,891
<i>The Oracle cloud

595

<i>and plotting the last 12 months

597
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,126
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

598
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,200
Nope.

599
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,721
That. Are you sure
that's not one of his?

600
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,280
<i>It predates any known Mandarin attack.</i>

601
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,204
<i>The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.</i>

602
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,123
Bring her around.

603
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,207
<i>The heat signature
is remarkably similar.</i>

604
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,325
<i>3,000 degree Celsius.</i>

605
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,202
That's two military guys.

606
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

607
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,160
<i>Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.</i>

608
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,241
Are we still at ding-dong?

609
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,761
- We're supposed to be on total...

610
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,966
...security lockdown.

611
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,881
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

612
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,610
<i>There's only so much I can do, sir,</i>

613
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,605
<i>when you give the world's press
your home address.</i>

614
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,889
Right there is fine.

615
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,603
You're not the Mandarin.

616
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,762
Are you? Are you?

617
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,930
You don't remember.

618
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,126
Why am I not surprised?

619
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,482
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

620
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,005
<i>Gluten-free waffles, sir.</i>

621
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,411
That's right.

622
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,410
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.

623
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,481
It's urgent.

624
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,764
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

625
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,887
It's...

626
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,730
- With her.
- Tony?

627
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,366
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah,

628
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,283
- it's Maya Hansen.
- Ah...

629
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,403
Old botanist pal

630
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,881
that I used to know, barely.

631
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,650
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

632
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,841
waiting in the car that I've never met.

633
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,921
He's 13.

634
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,809
No, I need your help.

635
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,450
But, what for? Why now?

636
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,808
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

637
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,927
I'll be fine.

638
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,321
I'm sorry,
with Happy in the hospital,

639
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,488
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

640
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,449
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

641
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,249
- She's not, really.
- No, not really. I...

642
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,523
- it was just one night.
- Yep.

643
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,329
That's how you did it, isn't it?

644
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,721
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.

645
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,723
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?

646
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,404
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.

647
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,481
Okay. We've been through this.

648
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,607
- Nope.
- Yep!

649
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,640
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

650
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,281
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.

651
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,971
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

652
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,530
This is how normal people behave.

653
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,802
I can't protect you out there.

654
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,723
Is... Is that normal?

655
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,968
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!

656
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,690
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

657
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,087
Calm down.

658
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,049
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.

659
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,491
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

660
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,846
I don't like it.

661
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,921
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

662
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,207
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?

663
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,406
That's not even up for discussion.

664
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,687
- Can we, um...
- I said no. What?

665
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,000
Do we need to worry about that?

666
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,481
I got you.

667
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,722
I got you first.

668
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,165
Like I said, we can't stay here.

669
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,881
Oh!

670
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,531
Move! I'm right behind you.

671
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,525
Oh!

672
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,240
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

673
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,565
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

674
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,691
Go!

675
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,769
Ch, my God. Tony!

676
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,930
<i>Sir, Ms Potts
is clear of the structure.</i>

677
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,371
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

678
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,488
<i>Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</i>

679
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,606
That's one.

680
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,120
<i>Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</i>

681
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,206
That's two.

682
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,001
Oh.

683
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,088
Tony!

684
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,604
<i>Sir, take a deep breath.</i>

685
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,168
<i>Flight power restored.</i>

686
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,646
<i>Sir?</i>

687
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,450
<i>- Sir!</i>

688
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,566
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

689
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,610
<i>That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</i>

690
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,681
Oh...

691
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,326
Oh!

692
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,650
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

693
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,441
<i>We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</i>

694
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,965
Why?

695
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,691
Jarvis. Not my idea.

696
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,482
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

697
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,005
I gotta get Pepper.
I gotta...

698
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,841
<i>I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</i>

699
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,967
Who asked you?

700
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,000
- Open the suit.
I...

701
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,246
<i>I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</i>

702
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,321
Open it, J.

703
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,527
That's brisk.

704
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,324
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

705
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,325
<i>I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</i>

706
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,965
- Jarvis.

707
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,565
Jarvis?

708
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,242
Don't leave me, buddy.

709
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,571

00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,403
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.

713
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,370
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

714
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,206
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.

715
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,363
Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.

716
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,442
Done. Sorry.

717
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,524
And I'm sorry in advance

718
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,568

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,767
Freeze!

725
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,324
Don't move.

726
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,365
You got me.

727
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,604
Nice potato gun.

728
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,286
Barrel's a little long.

729
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,281
Between that and the wide gauge
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

730
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,680
And now you're out of ammo.

731
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,250
What's that thing on your chest?

732
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,443
It's an electromagnet.

733
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,480
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

734
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,041
What does it power?

735
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,963
Oh, my God.

736
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,246
That...

737
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,690
That's...
Is that Iron Man?

738
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,325
Technically, I am.

739
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,048
Technically, you're dead.

740
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,087
Valid point.

741
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,561
What happened to him?

742
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,051
Life.

743
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,720
I built him. I take care of him.

744
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,721
I'll fix him.

745
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,847
Like a mechanic?

746
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,405
Yeah.

747
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,007
Hmm.

748
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,845
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

749
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,001
It's "Iron Patriot" now.

750
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,241
That's way cooler.

751
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,651
No, it's not.

752
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,810
Anyways, I would have added in,
um, the retro...

753
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,446
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

754
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,489
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

755
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,600
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

756
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,001
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.

757
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,448
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

758
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,046
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.

759
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,161
Sorry.

760
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,771
Are you?

761
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,567
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

762
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,369
So, uh, who's home?

763
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,809
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

764
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,969
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.

765
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,561
Hmm.

766
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,928
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

767
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,001
Here's what I need.

768
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,520
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

769
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,046
the pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

770
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,488
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

771
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,728
What's in it for me?

772
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,565
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?

773
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,043
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

774
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,645
How'd you know that?

775
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,970
I got just the thing.

776
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,290
This is a piñata for a cricket.

777
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,080
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

778
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,403
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

779
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,561
it discourages bullying.

780
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,007
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

781
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,481
Deal? What do you say?

782
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,404
- Deal.
- Deal?

783
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,881
What's your name?

784
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,482
Harley. And you're...

785
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,966
The mechanic.

786
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,240
Tony.

787
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,201
You know what keeps
going through my head?

788
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,884
"Where's my sandwich?"

789
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,206
Where is Tony Stark?

790
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,091
<i>Stark secure server.</i>

00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,248

795
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,047
<i>That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</i>

796
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,120
Why were you
at the house tonight?

797
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,402
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

798
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,210
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

799
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,971
So, if you still want to talk about it

800
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,123
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.

801
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,290
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

802
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,608
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

803
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,411
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

804
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,841
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

805
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,649
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

806
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,048
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

807
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,881
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

808
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,481
<i>Well, we took the house down,
sir. But there's no sign of a body.</i>

809
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,681
- Mmm-hmm. I see.
<i>- No Stark.</i>

810
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,321
I have to go.

811
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,641
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

812
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,324
Well, you know how he gets.

813
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,927
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

814
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,521
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

815
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,927
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

816
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,641
Report in.

817
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,681
Path is clear.

818
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,165
The master is travelling.

819
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,049
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

820
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,360
The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

821
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,846
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

822
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,649
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

823
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,801
- Yeah?
- ...I was kind of hoping

824
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,201
for something a little more
adult than that.

825
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,927
She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

826
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,445
When can we talk about New York?

827
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,409
Maybe never.
Relax about it.

828
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,005
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

829
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,281
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

830
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,887
What's the official story here?
What happened?

831
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,488
I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.

832
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,006
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

833
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,324
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

834
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,088
Then he blew himself up, right here.

835
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,169
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.

836
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,009
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.

837
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,562
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

838
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,881
Think about it.

839
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,568
Six dead. Only five shadows.

840
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,166
Yeah.

841
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,084
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

842
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,529
Except the bomb guy.

843
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,491
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

844
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,011
That's why there's only five.

845
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,050
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.

846
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,807
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

847
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,360
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

848
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,046
That giant Wormhole in,
um, in New York.

849
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,568
Does it remind you?

850
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,688
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

851
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,728
Are they coming back? The aliens?

852
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,126
Maybe. Can you stop?

853
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,002
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

854
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,889
Does this subject make you edgy?

855
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,201
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

856
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,123
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

857
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,601
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

858
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,484
- Do you have medication?
- No.

859
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,011
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

860
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,571
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

861
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,130
Are you going completely mental?

862
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,490
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

863
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,480
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

864
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,086
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

865
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,522
Ah, man, you did it,
didn't you? You happy now?

866
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,647
What did I say?

867
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,480
- Hey! Wait up!

868
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,044
Wait, wait.

869
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,003
- What the hell was that?

870
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,161
Your fault.
You spazzed me out.

871
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,207
- Okay, back to business.
- Where were we?

872
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,486
The guy who died.

873
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,724
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs Davis, where is she?

874
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,847
Where she always is.

875
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,569
See? Now, you're being helpful.

876
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,681
Uh...

877
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,000
Sorry.

878
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,610
Lady?

879
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,528
Is this, uh...

880
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,561
Thank you.

881
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,691
Nice haircut. It suits you.

882
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,241
Nice watch.

883
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,925
Yeah. A limited edition.

884
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,528
Oh, I don't doubt it.

885
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,800
Well, have a good evening.

886
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,566
Excuse me.

887
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,884
Mrs Davis?

888
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,641
Mind if I join you?

889
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,521
Free country.

890
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,490
Sure is.

891
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,605
All right.

892
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,562
Where would you like to start?

893
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,129
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

894
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,720
I want to know
what you think happened.

895
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,767
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

896
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,526
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

897
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,484
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

898
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,800
Supposed to meet someone here?

899
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,881
Yeah.

900
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,161
Mrs Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

901
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,129
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

902
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,961
Someone used him.

903
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,281
What?

904
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,883
As a weapon.

905
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,361
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

906
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,441
Actually, I am.

907
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,920
Hey, hey, hey!

908
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,645
What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

909
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,730
- It's called an arrest.

910
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,851
- Sheriff, is it?

911
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,803
Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

912
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,928
Homeland Security. We good here?

913
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,843
No, we're not "good."

914
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,600
I need a little more information
than that.

915
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,001
Well, I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

916
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,326
Yeah?
Well, why don't you

917
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,448
get on the horn
to Nashville and, uh, upgrade me?

918
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,327
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way,

919
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,360
but, uh, the fun way is always good.

920
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,050
Deputy, get this woman out of...

921
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,160
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

922
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,848
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.

923
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,407
Watch this.

924
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,365
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

925
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,761
That's all you got?

926
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,691
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

927
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,162
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

928
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,968
- Let me go!
- Help me!

929
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,361
Anyway.

930
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,608
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

931
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,648
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.

932
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,926
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

933
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,923
"I want my goddamn file."

934
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,407
It's not your fault, kid.

935
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,885
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

936
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,680
You like that, Westworld?

937
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,441
That's the thing about smart guys,

938
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,009
- we always cover our ass.

939
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,161
Ah!

940
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,129
You're welcome.

941
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,771
For what? Did I miss something?

942
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,808
Me, saving your life.

943
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,043
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

944
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,885
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

945
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,248
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

946
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,129
Unlike you?

947
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,609
Admit it, you need me.

948
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,206
We're connected.

949
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,440
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

950
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,847
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

951
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,160
and stay connected to the telephone

952
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,969
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

953
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,166
Can you feel that? We're done here.

954
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,526
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

955
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,331
Bye, kid.

956
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,405
I'm sorry, kid.

957
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,121
You did good.

958
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,080
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

959
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,201
Yeah.

960
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,051
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

961
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,770
I'm cold.

962
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,281
I can tell.
You know how I can tell?

963
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,285
Because we're connected.

964
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,202
It was worth a shot.

965
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,962
<i>You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</i>

966
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,451
<i>It goes with any decor...</i>

967
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,641
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.

968
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,731
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

969
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,801
<i>I'm trying.
There's nothing I can...</i>

970
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:33,921
<i>Well, where is
the feed coming from?</i>

971
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,083
<i>I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and I...</i>

972
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,288
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

973
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,760
It's not just our station.

974
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,881
What about a backup manual?

975
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,080
<i>We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</i>

976
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,046
Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.

977
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,530
Oh, God, not again.

978
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,326
Is the President getting this?

979
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,204
<i>Mr President.</i>

980
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,443
<i>Only two lessons remain.</i>

981
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,562
<i>And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</i>

982
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,407
<i>Meet Thomas Richards.</i>

983
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,643
<i>Good strong name.
Good strong job.</i>

984
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,245
<i>Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</i>

985
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,566
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

986
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,280
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

987
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,644
live on your television in 30 seconds.

988
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,846
No!

989
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,322
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

990
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,529
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

991
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,370
<i>America,</i>

992
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,564
<i>if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</i>

993
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,365
<i>Tom fives.</i>

994
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,441
<i>Go!</i>

995
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,051
How did he hack my phone?

996
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,088
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

997
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,400
I have to make this call.

998
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,891
I'd strongly advise against that.

999
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,566
This is the right thing to do.

1000
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,566
<i>There's just
one lesson left, President Ellis.</i>

1001
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,529
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

1002
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,601
Because nothing,

1003
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,160
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

1004
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,208
can save you.

1005
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,642
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

1006
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,128
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

1007
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,929
Sir, we tracked
the broadcast signal.

1008
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,843
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

1009
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,046
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

1010
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,282
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

1011
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,164
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.

1012
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,210
Don't move!

1013
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,241
Uh...

1014
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,521
Hang on a second.

1015
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,361
Hello?

1016
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,210
You ever have a chick straddling you
and you look up

1017
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,126
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

1018
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,726
Yeah, I've had that.
Who is this?

1019
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,767
<i>It's me, pal.</i>

1020
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,922
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

1021
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,002
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

1022
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,491
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

1023
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,561
What are you doing?

1024
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,764
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?

1025
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,841
Yeah.

1026
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,801
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.

1027
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,168
It's the same as
it's always been, "WarMachine68."

1028
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,287
And password, please.

1029
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,408
Well, look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

1030
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,847
It's not the '80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.

1031
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,921
Give me your login.

1032
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,966
With an all caps.

1033
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,681
Yeah, okay.

1034
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,009
That is so much better
than "Iron Patriot."

1035
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,731
<i>Very nice. Very nice.</i>

1036
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,486
<i>I have one question for you.</i>

1037
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,126
<i>What would you like
for Christmas this year?</i>

1038
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,251
<i>Well, David...</i>

1039
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,122
Do not erase a programme from my DVR
unless you are 100% sure...

1040
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,366
<i>One more time!
Ms Elk Ridge, everybody!</i>

1041
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,441
<i>All right.</i>

1042
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,211
Because you erase my shows!

1043
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,081
That ain't gonna cut it.

1044
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,208
We talked about this.

1045
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,808
Excuse me, sir.
I don't know who...

1046
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,604
Shh.

1047
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,160
Morn, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

1048
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,083
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Shh. Keep it down.

1049
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,685
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

1050
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,921
I knew you were still alive!

1051
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,001
Come on in. Close the door.

1052
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,760
Oh, wow.
Can I just say, sir...

1053
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,966
Yep.

1054
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,921
I am your biggest fan.

1055
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,969
Okay. First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

1056
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,287
No, no, no. Just us.

1057
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,441
Great. What's your name?

1058
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,130
- Gary.
- Gary.

1059
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,250
- Oh, wow.
- Right there is fine.

1060
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,566
- Okay.
Okay?

1061
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,880
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1062
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,240
- Oh, good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.

1063
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,691
I don't know if you can tell,

1064
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,888
but I have, like, patterned
my whole look after you.

1065
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,371
- My hair's a little...
- It's fine.

1066
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,970
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

1067
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,844
Right.

1068
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,011
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

1069
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,446
Boom!

1070
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,651
- A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1071
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,451
- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...

1072
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,287
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

1073
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,844
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1074
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,845
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

1075
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,843
I got an issue.
I'm chasing bad guys.

1076
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,681
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

1077
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,846
I don't have enough juice.

1078
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,282
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

1079
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,567
Recalibrate the ISDNs.

1080
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,688
Pump it up by about 40%.

1081
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,286
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.

1082
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,361
Yeah.

1083
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,442
Tony needs Gary.

1084
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,681
And Gary needs Tony.

1085
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,125
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.

1086
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,166
<i>What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</i>

1087
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,521
<i>Well, uh, I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</i>

1088
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,484
<i>Will you please state
your name for the camera?</i>

1089
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,800
<i>Ellen Brandt.</i>

1090
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:22,245
<i>Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</i>

1091
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,760
<i>Addiction will not be tolerated.</i>

1092
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,770
<i>And those who cannot regulate
will be cut from the programme.</i>

1093
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,004
<i>Once misfits, cripples...</i>

1094
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,769
<i>You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</i>

1095
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,925
<i>Everybody, before we start...</i>

1096
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,209
<i>I promise you, looking back at your
life, there will be nothing as bitter</i>

1097
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,444
<i>as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.</i>

1098
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,170
<i>Today is your glory.</i>

1099
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,366
<i>Let's begin.</i>

1100
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,926
<i>We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

1101
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,441
<i>Get her out!
Get them out of here!</i>

1102
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,284
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

1103
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,005
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

1104
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,287
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1105
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,727
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1106
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,567
Got you, pal.

1107
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,643
<i>What happened?</i>

1108
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,328
Fun fact.

1109
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,529
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1110
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,005
the idealistic Wernher von Braun

1111
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,322
dreamed of space travel.

1112
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,443
He stargazed.

1113
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,282
Do you know what he said when
the first V-2 hit London?

1114
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,727
"The rocket performed perfectly."

1115
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,325
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1116
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,001
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

1117
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,646
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

1118
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,961
And you look up,

1119
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,321
you're a long way from shore.

1120
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,404
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

1121
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,571
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

1122
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,201
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

1123
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,801
That's exactly what we used to do.

1124
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,128
So, don't judge yourself.

1125
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,608
Thank you, Pepper.

1126
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,604
I really appreciate that.

1127
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,601
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.

1128
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,771
Maya, run!

1129
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,605
Hi, Pepper.

1130
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,408
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

1131
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,801
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1132
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,201
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

1133
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,648
Oh, I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark when he threatened us?

1134
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,609
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1135
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,682
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1136
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,730
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

1137
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:21,367
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

1138
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,929
<i>This is support team Blue-Zero.</i>

1139
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,685
<i>Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</i>

1140
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:31,807
Copy.

1141
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,081
Nobody move.

1142
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,282
Oh. Support Blue-Zero,

1143
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,283
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

1144
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,930
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1145
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,441
I think you messed up again.

1146
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,364
Yes, you're free, uh,
if you weren't before.

1147
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,687
It's... Of course.

1148
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,761
Yes, ma'am.

1149
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,007
Iron Patriot on the job.

1150
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,161
Happy to help.

1151
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,441
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1152
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,840
It's my pleasure.

1153
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,201
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.

1154
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,566
If you want this suit,

1155
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,961
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

1156
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,770
That's the plan, Colonel.

1157
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,931
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

1158
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,322
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

1159
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,441
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.

1160
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,330
<i>- Can you still see straight?</i>
- Sort of.

1161
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,920
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

1162
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,401
<i>Jarvis, how are we?</i>

1163
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,721
<i>It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</i>

1164
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,883
<i>and then at the end of the sentence
I say the wrong cranberry.</i>

1165
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,246
<i>And, sir, you were right.</i>

1166
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,005
<i>Once I factored in
available AIM down/ink facilities</i>

1167
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,482
<i>I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</i>

1168
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,922
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa,

1169
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,968
Iran, Pakistan, Syria?
Where is it?

1170
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,446
<i>Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</i>

1171
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,400
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

1172
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,885
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1173
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,405
but not right now.

1174
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,561
Harley, where is he really?

1175
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,600
<i>Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</i>

1176
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,248
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.

1177
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,290
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?

1178
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,766
Uh, it's not charging.

1179
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,329
<i>Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</i>

1180
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,841
<i>It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</i>

1181
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,883
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

1182
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,806
- It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna...
- I don't wanna...

1183
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,846
Oh, God, not again.

1184
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,644
<i>- Tony?</i>

1185
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,603
<i>Are you having another attack?</i>

1186
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,000
I didn't even mention New York.

1187
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,522
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

1188
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,410
Okay, um, uh...

1189
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,681
God, what am I gonna do?

1190
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,328
Just breathe.
Really, just breathe.

1191
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,246
You're a mechanic, right?

1192
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,765
Right.

1193
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,925
<i>You said so.</i>

1194
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,405
Yes, I did.

1195
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,405
Why don't you just build something?

1196
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,447
Okay.

1197
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,521
<i>Thanks, kid.</i>

1198
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:07,286
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

1199
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,691
My fault again.

1200
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,600
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

1201
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,080
Well.

1202
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,807
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1203
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,407
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1204
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,766
- That's me.
- Ah!

1205
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,407
Nessie.

1206
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:28,567
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

1207
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,165
There's some guy over here.

1208
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,449
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

1209
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,727
Hey!

1210
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,881
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1211
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,487
Don't move.

1212
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,722
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

1213
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,801
Although the guns are all fake

1214
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,723
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1215
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,041
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1216
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,280
Heard enough.

1217
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,488
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

1218
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,687
Where?

1219
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,922
Where's the Mandarin?
Where is he?

1220
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,966
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.

1221
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,644
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

1222
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,804
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

1223
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,644
- It is.
- It's complicated.

1224
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,080
Uncomplicate it.
Ladies, out.

1225
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,800
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

1226
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,646
Sit.

1227
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,880
- Ew!
- Oh, Jesus.

1228
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,963
My name is Trevor.
Trevor Slattery.

1229
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,087
What are you?

1230
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,811
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?

1231
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,970
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

1232
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,850
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.

1233
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,722
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

1234
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,771
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.

1235
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,248
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1236
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:51,367
Well, I, um, had a little
problem with, um, substances.

1237
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,684
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

1238
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,081
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

1239
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,685
- Next?
- Then,

1240
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,690
they approached me
about the role,

1241
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,171
and they knew about the drugs.

1242
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,401
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

1243
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,205
They said they'd give me more.

1244
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,327
They gave me things.

1245
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,927
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

1246
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,241
They gave me things.

1247
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,566
Did you just nod off?

1248
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,721
Hey.

1249
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,643
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1250
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,121
And the thing was, he needed someone

1251
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,165
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

1252
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,561
"He"?

1253
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,168
- Killian?
- Killian.

1254
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,084
- He created you?
- He created me.

1255
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,807
Custom-made terror threat.

1256
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,084
Yes. Yes.

1257
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,044
His think tank thinked it up.

1258
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,767
The pathology of a serial killer.

1259
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,850
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

1260
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,403
Ready for another lesson?

1261
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:54,966
Blah, blah, blah.

1262
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,526
No.

1263
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,443
Of course, it was my performance

1264
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,567
that brought the Mandarin to life.

1265
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,125
Your performance?

1266
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,167
Where people died?

1267
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,964
No, they didn't.

1268
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,968
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

1269
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,208
Honestly, I wasn't on
location for half this stuff.

1270
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,089
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

1271
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,360
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

1272
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,561
and he might not wake up.

1273
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,001
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

1274
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,570
You're still going down, pal.

1275
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,641
You under...

1276
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,244
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1277
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,841
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

1278
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,841
No.

1279
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,721
You should have pressed
the panic button.

1280
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,647
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1281
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,281
Ah...

1282
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,401
Okay.

1283
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,010
It's just like old times, huh?

1284
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:07,091
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.

1285
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,810
It wasn't my idea.

1286
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,882
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1287
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,041
I took his money.

1288
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,527
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

1289
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,409
- No.
- Yeah.

1290
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,170
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

1291
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,086
Yeah?

1292
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,485
A lot has happened, Tony.

1293
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,885
But I'm close.

1294
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,688
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

1295
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,922
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

1296
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,445
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

1297
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,851
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1298
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,206
Then help me fix it.

1299
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,891
Did I do that?

1300
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,201
Yes.

1301
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,040
I remember the night, not the morning.

1302
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,206
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

1303
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,362
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

1304
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,967
You used to have a moral psychology.

1305
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,202
You used to have ideals.

1306
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,961
You wanted to help people.

1307
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,929
Now look at you.

1308
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,928
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

1309
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,765
still has their soul.

1310
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,441
Get me out of here.

1311
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,930
Come on.

1312
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,120
You know what my old man
used to say to me?

1313
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,883
One of his favourite of many sayings...

1314
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:34,329
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."

1315
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:36,682
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1316
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,161
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1317
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,242
I'm here to thank you.

1318
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,760
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

1319
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,885
Desperation.

1320
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,090
If you think back to Switzerland,

1321
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,204
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

1322
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,170
Well, for the first 20 minutes,

1323
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,568
I actually thought you'd show up.

1324
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,449
And the next hour...

1325
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:04,443
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1326
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:05,721
If you know what I mean.

1327
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,124
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1328
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,887
But as I looked out over that city,

1329
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,805
<i>nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</i>

1330
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,121
<i>no one was even looking.</i>

1331
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,205
<i>I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.</i>

1332
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,006
Anonymity, Tony.

1333
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,481
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

1334
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,641
Right?

1335
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,121
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

1336
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,680
<i>Because the second
you give evil a face,</i>

1337
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,724
<i>a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</i>

1338
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,404
you hand the people a target.

1339
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,170
You're something else.

1340
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,481
You have met him, I assume?

1341
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,164
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1342
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,561
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

1343
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,369
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1344
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,487
He's a stage actor.

1345
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,563
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1346
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,722
Anyway, the point is,

1347
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,122
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1348
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,521
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1349
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,764
What's next for you in your world?

1350
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,571
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift

1351
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,961
that you so graciously imparted to me.

1352
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,761
Desperation.

1353
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,767
Now, this is live.

1354
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,089
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

1355
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,448
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS

1356
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,601
or just give up.

1357
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,529
And if it gives up,

1358
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,530
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

1359
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,927
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

1360
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,644
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1361
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:44,201
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1362
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,081
Let him go.

1363
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,407
Hold on, hold on.

1364
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,407
Maya...

1365
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,443
I said, let him go.

1366
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,605
What are you doing?

1367
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,411
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1368
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,490
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1369
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,891
Maya, give me the injector.

1370
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,440
If I die, Killian,

1371
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,603
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1372
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,920
We're not doing this, okay?

1373
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,160
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

1374
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,287
The good news is,

1375
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,881
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

1376
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,566
You are a maniac.

1377
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,802
No, I'm a visionary.

1378
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,367
But I do own a maniac.

1379
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,410
And he takes the stage tonight.

1380
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,201
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1381
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,250
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1382
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,731
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked

1383
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,040
there was somebody inside of it.

1384
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,400
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1385
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,605
Hello, Colonel.

1386
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:14,925
Step aside.

1387
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,285
Oh!

1388
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,124
We'll get you out of there.

1389
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,326
Don't worry.

1390
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,769
You'll damage the armour.

1391
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,411
Yes, I will.

1392
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,161
But you can fix it, right?

1393
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,728
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

1394
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,330
And I want Potts with me.

1395
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,401
She's still in Phase Two.

1396
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,680
You're not going deaf, are you?

1397
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,686
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.

1398
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,127
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.

1399
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,323
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

1400
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,521
832 miles.

1401
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,131
Very nice.

1402
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,880
- I'm good like that.

1403
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:11,605
Can you, uh, stop that?

1404
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,250
Break it, you bought it.

1405
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,601
I think I bought it.

1406
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,206
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

1407
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,647
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

1408
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,846
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1409
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,525
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1410
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,885
This.

1411
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:31,967
That.

1412
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,370
Are you coming out?

1413
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,809
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

1414
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,484
- All right. Let's go.

1415
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,841
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1416
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,131
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1417
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,168
This time tomorrow,

1418
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,847
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

1419
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,686
and the world's
most feared terrorist in the other.

1420
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,930
I'll own the war on terror.

1421
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,971
Create supply and demand.

1422
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,406
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1423
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,688
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1424
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,206
on the ground in five, four, three...

1425
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:29,566
Come on! Two...

1426
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,611
How did we get this shift?

1427
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,171
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1428
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,045
- Put down your weapons.

1429
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,487
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

1430
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,961
In five, four, bang!

1431
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,121
- Ooh!
- Wow. That was...

1432
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,049
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

1433
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,650
I am just beyond terrified.

1434
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,251
Here it comes.

1435
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,688
- Three, four...
- Shut up.

1436
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,680
- Five, four, three, two, one!

1437
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,005
- Told you.

1438
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,721
Where's the rest?

1439
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,565
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

1440
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,329
Ah! Better late than never.

1441
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,247
Not this time.
Not the face.

1442
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,643
Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

1443
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,051
<i>Oh, hello, sir.</i>

1444
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,921
<i>All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1445
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,611
<i>Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1446
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,200
- Ah! Let's go!

1447
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,560
Aw, crap.

1448
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,361
Tony?

1449
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,761
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

1450
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,922
- No. You got yours?
- Uh... Mmm.

1451
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,129
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

1452
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,040
<i>There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</i>

1453
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,571
- You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1454
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,161
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1455
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,880
- What's this? I had winners.

1456
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:24,766
What have you come as?

1457
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,282
You make a move,
and I break your face.

1458
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:32,247
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1459
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,721
This is the Mandarin?

1460
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,803
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

1461
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,684
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1462
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,890
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1463
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,849
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1464
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,724
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1465
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,245
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1466
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,482
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1467
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,085
- Doing what?

1468
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,367
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!

1469
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,168
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1470
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,241
Spill.

1471
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,401
Do you know
what they did to my suit?

1472
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,527
What? No.

1473
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,088
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1474
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,562
Something to do with a big boat.

1475
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,005
I can take you there.

1476
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,529
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé...</i>

1477
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,604
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1478
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:16,685
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1479
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,441
Is that...
Is that important?

1480
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,284
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1481
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,121
So?

1482
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,045
What are we gonna do?

1483
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,201
I mean, we don't have any transport.

1484
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,281
- Right.

1485
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,321
Hey, Ringo.

1486
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,006
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1487
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,720
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1488
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,927
But we also have to figure out this

1489
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,764
- vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1490
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,080
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1491
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,360
Oh! That's the vice president.

1492
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,686
Thanks.

1493
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:47,446
Hello?

1494
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,204
<i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

1495
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:51,170
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1496
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,527
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1497
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,125
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1498
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,921
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1499
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,241
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1500
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,642
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1501
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,767
I think we're good, here.

1502
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,842
<i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1503
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,120
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1504
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,565
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1505
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,401
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1506
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,608
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1507
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,604
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1508
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,520
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.

1509
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,804
Everything okay, sir?

1510
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,881
Couldn't be better.

1511
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,250
I love you, babe.

1512
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,365
Colonel Rhodes.

1513
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,762
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1514
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,726
We gotta make a decision.

1515
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,610
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1516
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,410
<i>Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.</i>

1517
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,608
<i>The cranes have finally arrived,</i>

1518
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,760
<i>and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</i>

1519
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,524
And what about
the suit I'm wearing?

1520
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,967
<i>The armour is now at 92%.</i>

1521
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,122
That's going to have to do.

1522
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,243
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.

1523
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,367
Sure.

1524
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:33,805
Oh!

1525
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:49,880
Everything all right, Colonel?

1526
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,728
It is an honour, Mr President.

1527
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,122
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1528
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,444
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.

1529
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,045
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1530
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,601
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

1531
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,603
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1532
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,886
Get me eyes on it now.

1533
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,163
Image coming through now, sir.

1534
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,369
Was that Rhodes?

1535
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:53,885
Is anyone there?

1536
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,884
Let us out!

1537
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,850
The President.

1538
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,566
Now.

1539
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,641
He's not here.

1540
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,529
Try the jet stream?

1541
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,563
Speaking of which, go fish.

1542
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,288
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1543
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,281
How many in the air?

1544
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,007
<i>Thirteen, sir.</i>

1545
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,968
- How many can I carry?
- Four, sir.

1546
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,561
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

1547
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,611
Oh, God! No! No!

1548
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,441
Listen to me.
See that guy?

1549
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,481
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

1550
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,046
- You got it?
- What? Oh!

1551
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:42,882
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

1552
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:45,326
We can do this, Heather.

1553
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,441
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1554
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,928
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

1555
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,081
That's what we're going to do.

1556
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:04,446
<i>18,000 feet.</i>

1557
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,280
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

1558
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,246
Nice.

1559
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,250
<i>10,000 feet.</i>

1560
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,840
<i>6,000 feet.</i>

1561
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,565
Come on, people.

1562
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:22,726
Come on, come on, come on!

1563
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,166
Yeah!

1564
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,091
<i>1,000 feet.</i>

1565
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,844
<i>400 feet.</i>

1566
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,640
<i>200 feet, sir.</i>

1567
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,360
He's a chunky monkey,
let's get him.

1568
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,041
Hello.

1569
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,481
We made it!

1570
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,685
Nice work, guys!

1571
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,411
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

1572
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:05,761
All right, Jarvis.

1573
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,121
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

1574
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,884
That came out of nowhere.

1575
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,166
Wow.

1576
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,726
Give me some good news, man.

1577
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,801
I think they all made it.

1578
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,847
Oh, thank God.

1579
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,241
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1580
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,283
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

1581
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,528
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

1582
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,648
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?

1583
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,643
<i>The House Party protocol sir?</i>

1584
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,767
Correct.

1585
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,485
Hi.

1586
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,327
You think he's gonna help you?

1587
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,405
He won't.

1588
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,765
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...

1589
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,971
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

1590
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,247
You're here as my, um...

1591
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,003
Trophy.

1592
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,168
Mmm.

1593
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,566
Good evening, sir.

1594
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,925
Welcome aboard, Mr President.

1595
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,160
Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?

1596
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,922
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

1597
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,366
This is the <i>Roxxon Norco.</i>

1598
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,601
And, of course, you'll remember

1599
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:16,365
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

1600
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,365
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1601
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,529
What do you want from me?

1602
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,766
Uh, nothing, sir.

1603
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:27,602
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1604
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,728
You see, I've moved on.

1605
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,167
I found myself
a new political patron,

1606
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:35,410
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

1607
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,243
String him up.

1608
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,881
Hey!

1609
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,604
Come on.

1610
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,043
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

1611
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,849
I hope not.

1612
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,323
Oh, my God.

1613
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:36,081
He's strung up over the oil
tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.

1614
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,766
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

1615
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,604
Yeah, death by oil.

1616
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,643
<i>Broadcast will commence shortly.</i>

1617
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:49,846
<i>Take final positions.</i>

1618
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:52,441
Okay. That's good.

1619
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:56,366
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1620
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,760
Is your gun up?

1621
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,444
Yep. What do I do?

1622
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,966
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

1623
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,322
Six, high, back. All right.

1624
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,526
You see that? Nailed it.

1625
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,521
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1626
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:18,641
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1627
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,280
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1628
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,930
<i>All personnel, we have hostiles</i>

1629
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,001
<i>- on east unit 12.</i>
- Over there!

1630
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,844
<i>- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.</i>
- I'm out. Give me...

1631
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,207
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.

1632
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,408
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

1633
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,806
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.

1634
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:32,961
You've got, like, five of them.

1635
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,246
Here's what I'm going to do.

1636
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,283
Save my spot, ready?

1637
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,165
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.

1638
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,566
Here we go.

1639
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,363
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

1640
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,010
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.

1641
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,048
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.

1642
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,841
You know what?

1643
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,881
Is that...

1644
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,849
Yep.

1645
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,524
- Are those...
- Yeah.

1646
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,480
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1647
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:37,485
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1648
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,403
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1649
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,281
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1650
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:47,810
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1651
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,327
Take them to church.

1652
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,090
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1653
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,361
Incoming!

1654
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,610
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1655
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,680
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

1656
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,801
Everybody needs a hobby.

1657
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,040
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

1658
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,844
Nice timing.

1659
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,127
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

1660
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,244
Oh, I'm sorry,
they're only coded to me.

1661
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,603
What does that mean?
I got you covered.

1662
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,247
<i>Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you</i> a <i>lift?</i>

1663
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,810
Very funny.

1664
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,171
<i>Sir, I've located Ms Potts.</i>

1665
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:42,241
About time.

1666
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,727
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1667
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:04,401
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1668
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:06,800
You're such a jerk.

1669
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,440
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1670
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,040
Come on. A little more, baby.

1671
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,244
- Oh!

1672
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,607
Is this guy bothering you?

1673
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,811
Don't get up.

1674
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,961
Ooh.

1675
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,561
Is it hot in there?

1676
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,201
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1677
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,602
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

1678
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,921
Oh, Tony.

1679
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,002
- She's watching.

1680
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,080
I think you should close your eyes.

1681
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,930
Close your eyes.

1682
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,762
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

1683
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,929
- Yeah, you take a minute.

1684
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,561
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1685
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,561
Oh, come on!

1686
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:58,723
Mr President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1687
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:02,007
Just hold on. Hold on.

1688
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,245
Okay.

1689
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:25,051
Bye-bye.

1690
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:37,921
Brace yourself.

1691
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,769
You look damn good, Mr President,

1692
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:52,410
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1693
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,160
<i>The President is secure, Tony</i>

1694
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:08,640
<i>- I'm clearing the area.</i>
- Nice work.

1695
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:11,324
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1696
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:22,845
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

1697
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:24,041
- Just look at me!

1698
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,681
Honey, I can't reach any
further and you can't stay there.

1699
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,205
All right?
You've got to let go.

1700
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:33,763
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

1701
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,170
- No!

1702
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,089
A shame. I would've caught her.

1703
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,241
Eject.

1704
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:26,250
Well, here we are on the roof.

1705
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,041
<i>Mark 42, inbound.</i>

1706
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,568
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

1707
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:58,521
Whatever.

1708
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,245
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1709
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,601
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

1710
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,767
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

1711
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,207
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1712
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,523
Here's where you're wrong.

1713
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:18,806
She was already perfect.

1714
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,204
Jarvis,

1715
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,770
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

1716
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,281
No...

1717
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,328
No more false faces.

1718
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,969
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1719
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,845
You're looking right at him.

1720
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,204
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

1721
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,364
I am the Mandarin!

1722
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,040
I got nothing.

1723
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,645
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1724
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,803
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?

1725
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,081
Whoo!

1726
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,126
Honey?

1727
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,044
Oh, my God.

1728
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,807
That was really violent.

1729
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,802
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

1730
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,008
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1731
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,164
Who's the hot mess now?

1732
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,402
It's still debatable.

1733
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,246
Probably tipping your way a little bit.

1734
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,368
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?

1735
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,363
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1736
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,649
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1737
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,366
What am I going to complain
about now?

1738
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:36,850
Well, it's me.

1739
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,687
You'll think of something.

1740
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,651
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

1741
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,643
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

1742
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:45,681
Not hot.

1743
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,764
Am I gonna be okay?

1744
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:49,841
No.

1745
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,651
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

1746
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,763
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1747
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,729
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

1748
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,929
I think I can get you better.

1749
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,086
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1750
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,447
And all your distractions?

1751
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,082
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

1752
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,687
Jarvis. Hey.

1753
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,082
<i>All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</i>

1754
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,288
You know what to do.

1755
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:19,125
<i>The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</i>

1756
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:22,363
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1757
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:59,966
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?

1758
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,567
It'll do.

1759
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,325
<i>And so,
as Christmas morning began,</i>

1760
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,085
<i>my journey had reached its end.</i>

1761
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,522
<i>You start with something pure,</i>

1762
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,764
<i>something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</i>

1763
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,570
<i>The compromises.</i>

1764
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:40,851
<i>- We create our own demons.</i>

1765
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,602
- Oh!

1766
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,242
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!

1767
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:53,521
<i>As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.</i>

1768
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:57,400
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</i>

1769
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:04,562
<i>Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,</i>

1770
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:08,167
<i>but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</i>

1771
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,609
<i>And now, neither will I.</i>

1772
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,289
<i>- Let me tell you...</i>

1773
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,522
<i>...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</i>

1774
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,408
It's okay. It's okay.

1775
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,527
It's okay.

1776
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,601
No, look.

1777
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:02,930
<i>So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</i>

1778
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,324
<i>I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</i>

1779
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,482
<i>or a hobby.</i>

1780
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,562
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

1781
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,569
<i>And now,</i>

1782
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,807
<i>I'm a changed man.</i>

1783
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:30,401
<i>You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.</i>

1784
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,244
<i>One thing you can't take away...</i>

1785
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:38,609
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1786
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,721
<i>You know, and thank you
by the way. For listening.</i>

1787
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:09,286
<i>Plus, something about just
getting it off my chest,</i>

1788
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,921
<i>and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...</i>

1789
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,731
<i>I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.</i>

1790
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:18,849
<i>Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</i>

1791
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,446
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

1792
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,646
and my experiences with someone,

1793
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:25,246
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

1794
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,725
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

1795
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,609
Everything comes full circle.

1796
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:30,091
- And the fact that you've been able to

1797
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,049
- help me process...

1798
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,090
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.

1799
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:37,241
We were at, uh...

1800
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:38,646
Are you actively napping?

1801
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:41,047
I was... I... I drifted.

1802
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:42,681
Where did I lose you?

1803
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:46,364
Elevator in Switzerland.

1804
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,411
So, you heard none of it.

1805
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,730
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

1806
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:54,651
I'm not a therapist.

1807
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,689
- It's not my training.
- So?

1808
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,404
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?

1809
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:59,766
Temperament.

1810
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,565
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

1811
02:10:01,640 --> 02:10:03,005
Oh! God, my original wound.

1812
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:05,447
- 1983, all right?
- Yes.

1813
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,205
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
