1
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:46,257
<i>Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom,
lived a beautiful little girl...</i>

2
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,556
<i>...and her widowed father.</i>

3
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,535
It's beautiful.

4
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:59,971
<i>Okay. It wasn't that long ago.
And it wasn't really a faraway kingdom.</i>

5
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,839
<i>It was the San Fernando Valley.
It only looked faraway...</i>

6
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,480
<i>...because you could barely see it
through the smog.</i>

7
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,049
<i>But to me, growing up,
the Valley was my kingdom.</i>

8
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:19,691
<i>I was my dad's best friend.
And he was mine.</i>

9
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:24,499
<i>Although being raised by a man put me behind in
the make-up and fashion department,</i>

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,000
<i>I never felt like I missed out
on anything.</i>

11
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,671
<i>I was the luckiest girl in the world.</i>

12
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:38,100
<i>My dad owned the coolest diner in the whole valley.
I loved hanging out there.</i>

13
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,421
"Never let the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game"
<i>It was the kind of place where
diet was a four-letter word...</i>

14
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,855
<i>...and grease came
at no additional charge.</i>

15
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:54,355
<i>At Hal's, everyone felt like family.</i>

16
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,829
Alright, I have drinks for everyone.

17
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:03,504
Happy birthday!

18
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,469
Make a wish, princess.

19
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:10,409
<i>What did I need a wish for?
I had amazing friends and the coolest dad.</i>

20
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:20,320
<i>But I guess my dad thought I needed
one more thing: Fiona.</i>

21
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,151
I am so sorry.

22
00:02:24,994 --> 00:02:26,894
You look beautiful, Fiona.

23
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,963
Hey, Hal!

24
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:36,629
<i>Along with my new stepmother came
her twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella.</i>

25
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,775
<i>My out-of-step-sisters.</i>

26
00:02:39,943 --> 00:02:45,142
<i>But as long as my dad was happy, so was I.
We were going to be one big, happy family.</i>

27
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:46,839
Cheese.

28
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:49,612
One's enough.

29
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,983
<i>Unfortunately, this was no fairy tale.</i>

30
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,725
"He took her hand, and he kissed it.

31
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,952
"Then he swooped her up onto
his horse.

32
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:05,161
"And the beautiful princess and the
handsome prince rode off to his castle

33
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:11,274
"where they lived happily ever after. "

34
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,569
Do fairy tales come true, Dad?

35
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:18,544
Well, no. But dreams come true.

36
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,081
- Do you have a dream?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,311
My dream is that you'll grow up
and go to college...

38
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:27,650
...and then maybe someday you'll build
your own castle.

39
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,151
Where do princesses go to college?

40
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:35,056
They go...

41
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,392
...where the princes go.

42
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,558
They go to Princeton.

43
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:43,604
But, Sam, you know, fairy tales aren't
just about finding handsome princes.

44
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:47,342
They're about fulfilling your dreams...

45
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,638
...and about standing up for what
you believe in.

46
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,577
It's just as I always say:
never let the fear of striking out...

47
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,048
- Keep you from playing the game.
- That's right.

48
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:01,480
And just remember, if you look carefully,
this book contains important things...

49
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,684
...that you may need to know
later in life.

50
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,973
<i>- Earthquake!
- My kingdom came crumbling down...</i>

51
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:20,075
<i>...the day the Northridge earthquake stroke the Valley.</i>

52
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,404
Help! Help!

53
00:04:22,578 --> 00:04:25,547
- Don't go!
- I'll be right back.

54
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:40,021
<i>I lost my best friend that day.</i>

55
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,756
<i>And from then on, the only fairy tales
in my life...</i>

56
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,526
<i>...were the ones I read about in books.</i>

57
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:56,077
<i>Since my father didn't leave a will,
my stepmother got everything.</i>

58
00:04:56,245 --> 00:05:02,650
<i>The house, the diner,
and to her dismay, me.</i>

59
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,093
<i>Sam.</i>

60
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,230
<i>Sammy.</i>

61
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,867
<i>Sam!</i>

62
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,572
<i>It's breakfast time.</i>

63
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:04,542
<i>So bring me my breakfast.</i>

64
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:11,345
<i>Sam!</i>

65
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:18,200
Careful, ladies. Look for the eyes.
One, two, three, bicycle.

66
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:24,861
And feint. Magpie, magpie, magpie.
Flap and flap and flap. Mary Lou Retton!

67
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:28,663
Palm tree and palm tree.
Lady Liberty. Lady Liberty.

68
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:31,705
Around the harbor. Around the harbor.
Circle Line tour.

69
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,240
And hurricane.

70
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,607
Can you believe how extraordinarily
gifted my girls are?

71
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,272
Absolutely unbelievable. Really.

72
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,818
- Sam!
- Find each other. Look in the eyes.

73
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,251
- I'm coming.
- One, two, three and four...

74
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,220
...and right, left, up and down.

75
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:53,089
Is this the Norwegian salmon that I asked for?
Beause I need my omega-3s.

76
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,925
Only the best.

77
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,930
I can tell.

78
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:04,199
You know, it costs a fortune to fly
that stuff in from Norwegia.

79
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:07,171
And push it, ladies. Push it, ladies.
Push it, ladies.

80
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,867
Ready? Okay.

81
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,216
- Gross. Mom!
- I have a spastic colon.

82
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:20,617
Well, you have a spastic brain.

83
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,388
- Stop. Stop hitting her. Stop it. Stop it.
- You bit me.

84
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,762
What are you doing just standing there?
Get to work.

85
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:30,262
Fiona, I can't go to work this morning.
I've got a really big test I have to study for.

86
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:36,394
Listen, Sam: People go to school
to get smarter...

87
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:39,268
...so that they can get a job.

88
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:43,071
You already have a job.
So it's like skipping a step.

89
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,441
Come on, get going.

90
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,978
And Flying Karamazov.

91
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,360
No, honey. Leave those on.

92
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,156
The lawn is looking a little brown.

93
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,926
Fiona, we're supposed to be conserving water.
We're in the middle of a drought.

94
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:07,933
Droughts are for poor people.

95
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:11,832
Do you think J. Lo has a brown lawn?

96
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:16,539
People who use extra water
have extra class.

97
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:56,414
You call that grade-A beef? Well, that cow
must have cheated on his test.

98
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:02,419
Pickup.

99
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:09,925
Bobby, that's enough with the salmon.

100
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:14,900
You already made a salmon omelet,
salmon soup and salmon pudding. Come on.

101
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,097
- Help me. Fiona wants to eat me.
- That's nasty.

102
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:21,675
- Bite me, Rhonda. Bite me.
- That's nasty.

103
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:26,208
- Eleanor, your order's up.
- Coming. I got it.

104
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:27,815
Safe!

105
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,576
I'm okay.

106
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,617
- Chuck, how you doing?
- Super.

107
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:36,952
That's good. So cheese omelet,
extra bacon, crisp...

108
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:39,993
...blueberry muffin and a Coke.
- Make it a Diet Coke.

109
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,630
I'm trying to watch my weight.

110
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,629
It ain't going nowhere.

111
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,397
Pick up these salmon waffles.

112
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:55,036
- Sam, what are you still doing here?
- I'm almost done.

113
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,543
- You'll be late for school.
- I'll get there.

114
00:09:57,713 --> 00:09:59,999
- Fiona goes ballistic if I don't finish.

115
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,884
I couldn't care less about Fiona.
What I care about is your education.

116
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:05,850
She's got you getting up
at the crack of dawn.

117
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,252
- Your dad would want you at school.
- But...

118
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:13,088
No more "buts. " You just leave Fiona
and her big butt to me.

119
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:16,158
- Thanks, Rhonda.
- Get.

120
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,975
Hey, looking good, Mr. Farrell.

121
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,774
A man's best friend is his Mercedes,
Sam.

122
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,578
I'll remember that.

123
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,848
Any... Anything is possible
if you just believe.

124
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:42,513
- Anything is possible if you just...
- Audition today, son?

125
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:47,322
- Yeah, 5:00, all right? Tell Mom.
- Knock them dead.

126
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:54,668
Dad. Now, do you see what I have to go
to school in? No offense, Sam.

127
00:10:54,837 --> 00:10:56,862
Honestly, don't you feel sorry
for me?

128
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:00,801
No, I feel sorry about the three cars
we got you that you totaled.

129
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,445
Okay. All right.

130
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:11,719
- Carter, what are you wearing?
- What...?

131
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,650
This is my Snoop Dizzle look.

132
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,381
I cannot drive you to school like that.

133
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,725
Sam, I am a Method actor, okay?
This is part of my training.

134
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:26,129
I know, I know, I know. But look at this.

135
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:29,667
All right. Take two.

136
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,572
<i>Buenos dias, Fighting Frogs.</i>

137
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,614
Here's your daily drought reminder
to conserve agua.

138
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,546
Cut your showers short.

139
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:46,882
Brownie points go out to Mr. Rothman,
who hasn't had one in weeks.

140
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,752
<i>And don't forget, today's
your last chance to get tickets...</i>

141
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:52,723
<i>...to the big Halloween homecoming
dance.</i>

142
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:56,729
You too can dress up like someone
you're not, for a change.

143
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,663
- I mean, I...
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...

144
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:03,896
...of the United States of America,
and to the republic...

145
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,268
<i>...for which it stands, one nation...</i>

146
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,603
Primo parking spot dead ahead.

147
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:12,407
- Okay, there's a spot. There's a spot.
- Sam, watch out. Watch out.

148
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:16,144
Okay. You snooze, you lose!

149
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,448
Well, if it isn't Shelby Cummings
and her ladies in waiting.

150
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,354
- Shelby wants me so bad.
- You've never even talked to her before.

151
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,519
Oh, I've talked to her. Okay?

152
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:34,101
In my mind. And let me tell you,
in my mind, she wants me so bad.

153
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:38,897
Carter, you could do so much better than
Shelby Cummings. Even in your mind.

154
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,736
- There's another spot.
- Got it.

155
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,346
Come on.

156
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,931
Austin.

157
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,365
I swear, people like Shelby and Austin...

158
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,063
...are genetically programmed
to find each other.

159
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,471
How can so much ego be
in one relationship?

160
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:18,975
- Imagine what they say about you.
- They don't even know I exist.

161
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:23,751
Stalkerazzi at 3 o'clock.

162
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,912
The white zone is for cool people only.
No peaks.

163
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:33,588
Hey, diner girl, can I get a
breakfast burrito to go? Thank you.

164
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,992
And you thought they didn't
know you exist.

165
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:38,326
- That car's as old as that hat.
- Right.

166
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:42,699
Move. Move. Move.

167
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:45,932
- Move. Move.
- Hi.

168
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:49,839
Shelby. Hey, sister-friend.

169
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,173
Remind me again why we tolerate them.

170
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,612
because they give you a Prada bag
for your birthday.

171
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:57,445
Try "Frada" bag. Totally fake.

172
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,528
Greetings. Samantha, you look absolutely
stunning today, as per usual.

173
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,394
Thank you, Terry.

174
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:16,402
Excuse me, I must get back
to my galaxy now.

175
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:20,433
Zion, Lieutenant Terry here. Hello?

176
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,635
Can you hear me? Captain?
You're going in and out.

177
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:26,645
- Poor guy.
- At least he's happy.

178
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,717
- Happy? The guy lives in another world.
- I copy.

179
00:14:30,886 --> 00:14:34,151
Sometimes fantasy is better
than reality, Carter.

180
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:42,994
- Speaking of fantasy.
- I'll see you later.

181
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:46,931
Yes, the secret admirer beckons.

182
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:56,375
<i>Where have you been?
We haven't talked in ages.</i>

183
00:14:56,946 --> 00:15:00,074
We talked this morning.

184
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,675
<i>I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

185
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,384
<i>What's on your mind right now?</i>

186
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,782
You first.

187
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,564
<i>Well, I'm thinking that Professor Rothman's
dissected one too many frogs.</i>

188
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,202
<i>Ribet, ribet.</i>

189
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:33,646
Laugh out loud.

190
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,353
<i>I wanna hear your laugh.
When can we finally meet?</i>

191
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,168
<i>Soon.</i>

192
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:04,568
<i>How's your day so far?</i>

193
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,579
<i>Raging stepmom, work and cool kids
who can't get over themselves.</i>

194
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,243
<i>- Ever feel like you don't belong?
- Absolutely.</i>

195
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:17,081
<i>I can be surrounded by a sea
of people and still feel all alone.</i>

196
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,523
<i>Then I think of you.</i>

197
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,463
<i>Hey, Nomad, do you think
we've ever met?</i>

198
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:29,699
<i>I don't know. Our school
has over 3500 kids.</i>

199
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,500
<i>Well, that narrows it down.</i>

200
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,439
<i>Well, at least I can eliminate the guys.</i>

201
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:40,145
<i>You're not a guy, right? Because if you are,
I'll kick your butt.</i>

202
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,518
<i>I am not a guy.</i>

203
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,751
<i>Have you told your dad
about Princeton yet?</i>

204
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:51,188
<i>If only I could. I haven't even told him
I wanna be a writer.</i>

205
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,090
<i>My father always encouraged me
to pursue my dreams.</i>

206
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,359
<i>Not mine. He has a whole 
other plan for my life.</i>

207
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:02,396
<i>It's 2 a. m. We've been at this
for five hours.</i>

208
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,170
<i>Well, I think we broke our record.</i>

209
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:11,206
<i>- We should turn in. Sweet dreams.
- Wait.</i>

210
00:17:13,082 --> 00:17:15,744
<i>I can't sleep without knowing
there's hope.</i>

211
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:20,043
<i>Half the night I waste in sighs.</i>

212
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:23,185
<i>In a wakeful doze I sorrow.</i>

213
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,287
<i>For the hand, the lips...</i>

214
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,762
<i>...the eyes.</i>

215
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,299
<i>For the meeting of tomorrow.</i>

216
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,894
<i>Quoting Tennyson. Impressive.</i>

217
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,664
<i>Please meet me at the
homecoming dance.</i>

218
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:44,370
<i>I'll be waiting for you at 11:00
in the middle of the dance floor.</i>

219
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,084
Sweet dreams.

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,686
That was close.

221
00:17:54,858 --> 00:18:01,057
- Sam, this is great.
You're finally gonna be able to meet him.
- I don't know. This guy's too good to be true.

222
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:10,596
Come on. It's been, like, a month since you
met him in that Princeton chat room, okay?

223
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:15,176
- You talk to him all the time. You know him.
- I know, but he doesn't know me.

224
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,006
What if I meet him
and I'm not what he expects?

225
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,638
Maybe this whole relationship's
just better for cyberspace.

226
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,987
Listen, okay? You have to go
to that dance, okay?

227
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:33,788
This Nomad guy isn't gonna be in one place
for long, all right?

228
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:36,795
- If it helps, I'll be your escort.
- Really?

229
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:40,660
- Yeah.
- You rock, Carter!

230
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,871
- Hello?
<i>- Sam?</i>

231
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:50,573
Some little brat got into my salmon
and ate it all.

232
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:54,580
<i>I need more salmon.
And pick up my dry cleaning.</i>

233
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,308
And wash the Jag.

234
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,782
Fiona. One more pitch.

235
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:05,825
- Why do you act like her slave?
- Simple. No Fiona, no money for Princeton.

236
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,985
- That sucks.
- Tell me about it.

237
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,629
Hey, it's out of here.

238
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:27,474
Damn, a girl hit that.
See, now that's impressive.

239
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:31,278
So, what are you and Shelby going
to the dance as?

240
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,881
I don't know if I'm going with Shelby.

241
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:38,652
You're not gonna go with Shelby?
Who else you gonna go with?

242
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,788
I don't know. It's a mystery to me.

243
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:45,161
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

244
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:49,162
Okay, guys. Come on.
A little bit further. Right there.

245
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,834
Thirty percent off for USC alumni.

246
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,080
Looks good, my friend.
Make sure you get these rims alright...

247
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,741
- Austin.
- What's up?

248
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,979
What's with all those college
brochures in your bedroom?

249
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,282
What are you doing in my room?

250
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,258
- I'm just trying to keep my options open.
- You don't need any options.

251
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,920
It is all taken care of.

252
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:22,162
Look, son, we've been working on this
program since you were 9 years old.

253
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,828
You're gonna play USC football,
graduate...

254
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:28,875
...and then you'll manage this business
with me. Your future's set.

255
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:32,036
So don't mess with the plan. Alright?

256
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,375
Wouldn't think of it.

257
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,746
There's another customer.
Go make them happy.

258
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,052
Yes, sir, here's your car.

259
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,989
Well, you need a wax.

260
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:49,693
- Excuse me?
- I meant the car.

261
00:20:50,465 --> 00:20:52,126
Oh, fine.

262
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:04,935
- Austin.
- Hi.

263
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:07,138
- We need our cars washed.
- Yeah, look.

264
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:08,546
Dirt!

265
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,386
One second, ladies. Alright.

266
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:17,286
Take this inside when you're done.
Thank you very much.

267
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:20,257
Oh, my God, he is an angel.

268
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,624
- He's so cute.
- I know.

269
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,666
So who'd you guys pay to make
your cars so dirty?

270
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:31,602
Excuse me? Like, what are you,
the dirt police?

271
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:33,536
Yeah. The dirt police.

272
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:38,146
Like, excuse me, miss, do you know
how fast your dirt was going?

273
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:40,907
You should have stopped
with the dirt police.

274
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,687
You know, you should really get going,
because our mom's looking for you.

275
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:49,517
- Well, where is she?
- She's at home, baking.

276
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,491
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

277
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,360
Oh, my... Did you finish your errands?

278
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:03,163
Because I need you to head to the diner
and take the night shift.

279
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:07,867
Tonight's my night off and it's
the Halloween dance at school, so...

280
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:13,345
I know, but you need to stop being so
self-centered, Sam, and start thinking of others.

281
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:16,916
Others need you to go to the diner
and mop the floors tonight.

282
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:20,543
But I really need to go to this dance,
Fiona. I have to.

283
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:23,623
You need to earn your tuition money
for college.

284
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,625
You gotta bus a lot of tables.

285
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:32,597
I'm a straight-A student. I work seven days
a week and I'm taking extra AP classes.

286
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:37,796
I never asked you for anything.
Please let me go to this dance.

287
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:42,638
Sweetheart, now that you're
old enough...

288
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:47,475
...there's something I've always wanted to
tell you, and I think you're ready to hear it.

289
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:51,580
You're not very pretty,
and you're not very bright.

290
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:55,684
I'm so glad we had that talk.

291
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,760
- Man, you...
- Scoot over, bro.

292
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:09,904
- See if we can get a bigger table.
- Move over.

293
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,106
You're in my way.

294
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:21,708
It must be Halloween. Look what just flew in:
The wicked witch of the Valley.

295
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:25,683
I'm gonna be picking up
Gabriella and Brianna at the Halloween dance.

296
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:29,415
- I'll be back by 12 sharp.
- Okay.

297
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,919
Still got room in there, huh?

298
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:38,863
Well, if it isn't little Betty Crocker
from the 'hood.

299
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,969
Don't you have something to do,
like cleaning toilets?

300
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:46,574
You know, I would, but I'm too busy
running this place. But be my guest.

301
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:52,045
I'm sorry, I can't, because I just got
a $ 150 manicure. Silver palm trees.

302
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:58,248
You know, keep it up, Fiona, and I'm gonna find
a place to put my $6 pedicure.

303
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,385
Where are your skates?
That's part of the uniform.

304
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:05,219
Fiona, if I wanted to look like a clown,
I'd join the circus.

305
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:10,456
If you were part of my circus, I'd have you
clean elephant butts with a Wet One.

306
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:14,966
- I don't think you realize that I could...
- Fire me? Oh, please, go right ahead.

307
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:18,732
And let's see how many customers
you have left when you do.

308
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:23,072
I am a very appealing person.

309
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,547
Yeah, in your head.

310
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:37,087
- "I'm a very appealing person. "
- "I'm a very appealing person. "

311
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,056
That woman can make a nun swear.

312
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,561
I'm graduating a year early so I can
be 3000 miles away in Princeton.

313
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:49,500
You could go to the University of Mars
and it still wouldn't be far enough.

314
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,035
Honey, I'm desperate.

315
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,674
- Can you cover that back booth?
- We're waiting.

316
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:57,107
- I don't think I can eat anything here.
- But...

317
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:03,977
I have the feeling I won't be able
to get a Zone meal here.

318
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:07,952
- I already ate.
- Laxatives don't qualify as a food group.

319
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,218
- Surprised you didn't know that.
- Stop it.

320
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:15,124
Well, if it isn't diner girl.

321
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:18,789
- What can I get you guys?
- What can I get here that has no sugar...

322
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,061
...no carbs and is fat-free?
- Water.

323
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:25,536
- Water? Feisty.
- Was that supposed to be a joke?

324
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,306
It was funny.

325
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:29,807
- I'll have a Voss.
- Excuse me?

326
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,046
- It's water. From Norway.
- She's the worst.

327
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:38,913
- Sorry, we only have water from the Valley.
- Oh, well, then I'll have an iced tea.

328
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:41,419
Make that two.
And I'm still waiting...

329
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,650
...on that breakfast burrito, diner girl.
- See you.

330
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:48,262
- Thank you.
- She is so not getting a tip.

331
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,491
Shelby, we really need to talk.
Privately.

332
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:56,660
Anything you say to me,
you can say in front of my peeps.

333
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,566
Okay.

334
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,270
I wanna break up.

335
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:04,673
What?

336
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,074
That was harsh.

337
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,046
- Are you in love with somebody else?
- I think so.

338
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,082
- No way.
- What? Who, bro?

339
00:26:11,253 --> 00:26:12,982
I don't know.

340
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:17,487
- But we can still be...
- Don't say the word "friends. "

341
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,925
Fortunately for you, I'm gonna overlook
this mental breakdown of yours.

342
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:27,228
Look, just chill out. We're gonna go get
ready for the dance, and I'll see you there.

343
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,562
- Later.
- Late.

344
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:35,571
- That went well, bro.
- No, she took it well.

345
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:38,372
Good looking out.

346
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:41,413
- Later, diner girl.
- Too late.

347
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,483
Don't worry about it.

348
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:54,388
You know, those kids remind me
of why I used to fight in school.

349
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,592
Have no fear.

350
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:02,063
Zorro is here.

351
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:07,063
And he's got the keys
to his dad's Mercedes.

352
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,067
You're going dressed as a bus girl?

353
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:13,442
- Carter, I'm not going.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

354
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:19,019
- Okay, sorry, sorry. What about cyberdude?
- Cyberdude?

355
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:21,883
The boy that's been sending
you love notes?

356
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,855
They're not love notes. They're e-mails.

357
00:27:25,026 --> 00:27:29,622
If a man is taking his time to write down
his feelings for you, it's a love note.

358
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:32,460
You've got a secret admirer.

359
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:36,035
And he wants to meet her tonight
at the dance.

360
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:39,002
- What are you still doing here?
- I'm obeying orders.

361
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:42,940
- Sam, this is your true love.
- Well, true love is gonna have to wait.

362
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:47,673
Oh, girl, please, save all that drama for the
soap operas. You are going to that dance.

363
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,181
Go ahead, girlfriend.

364
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:55,551
I can't go. Fiona would kill me and then
bring me back to clean up the mess.

365
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:58,284
She's gonna have to
go through me to hurt you.

366
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,123
- You go, girlfriend, do your thing.
- Call me "girlfriend" one more time.

367
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:03,662
Okay, sorry.

368
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:07,393
Sam, your dad did not leave this earth
wanting you to be unhappy.

369
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:11,300
It's time for you to find your own bliss,
starting with this dance.

370
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:13,907
Sam, you need to listen to Rhonda.

371
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:17,636
You're always studying, always working.
You need to take some time for yourself.

372
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:20,576
Yeah, why don't you go out
and bust a move?

373
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:25,083
- Put your freak on!
- Whatever it is you kids do these days.

374
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,246
You know what? You guys are right.
I never do anything for myself.

375
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:31,754
- No, you don't.
- True.

376
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:33,822
And I deserve to have some fun.

377
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,553
- That's right.
- Yeah.

378
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,131
- I am gonna go to that dance.
- Okay, great.

379
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,031
And I am gonna meet my true love
and I'm gonna dance all night.

380
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,044
- I can't go.
- What?

381
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:52,907
I don't have a costume.

382
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:58,880
- But you will. Are you coming, Zorro?
- Yes, ma'am.

383
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:09,290
Vernon. Sam needs a costume.

384
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,433
No. No, Rhonda. I am closed.

385
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,899
Come on, I'll give you free breakfast
for a week.

386
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:19,202
Make it a month.

387
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:22,875
There's gotta be something here.

388
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:25,979
There is this one.

389
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,943
Perfect.

390
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,483
- Olay!
- No way.

391
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,254
Hey, you're killing me here.

392
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,925
Aloha.

393
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:50,195
No, no. I got something.

394
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,875
Bless you.

395
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,813
Rhonda, this is hopeless.

396
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:09,147
Vernon, let me see that mask.

397
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,891
I don't have an outfit
that goes with that.

398
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,964
Yeah, but I do.

399
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:33,808
Rhonda, you sure do have a knack for taking
something simple and making it beautiful.

400
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:39,783
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

401
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,816
I was saving this dress for my
next attempt down the aisle.

402
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,962
Long story.

403
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,668
It's beautiful.

404
00:30:55,403 --> 00:31:01,171
- Rhonda, I can't wear that.
- Yes, you can. And you will.

405
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:06,478
That dress has been in that box so long,
it deserves a night out.

406
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:09,379
Let's go.

407
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,315
This is gonna look so good on you.

408
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:24,390
Welcome, North Valley High School seniors
to the Halloween homecoming dance.

409
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:29,060
Tonight, our panel of esteemed teachers
will use their years of higher education...

410
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:32,338
...to choose our homecoming
prince and princess.

411
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:36,338
In true L.A. Fashion,
it's not about who you are.

412
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:41,676
It's about what you wear.
Are you ready to crank it up? Yeah.

413
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:50,253
I cannot believe I put you 
in charge of costumes.

414
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:55,055
I told you Siamese cats,
not Siamese twins.

415
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:58,460
Are we having a catfight?

416
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:10,138
- Welcome, guys.
- What's up?

417
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:13,178
- Sorry about the costume you lost, Austin.
- It's all good, bro.

418
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,317
No, it's not all good, bro.
Now we don't get to be the Three Musketeers.

419
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:20,147
You get to be Prince Charming
and we're the two wimps in wigs.

420
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,886
Take the cape off already.
You look amazing.

421
00:32:28,062 --> 00:32:31,828
- I'm sorry, I'm just freaking out here.
- Listen, it's gonna be okay.

422
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,094
- Hurry up, it's almost 11.
- Carter, wait.

423
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,102
Remember, I have to be back
in the diner by 12, okay?

424
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:41,070
Okay, give me your cell phone.
Come on, cell phone.

425
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:48,373
Okay. All right, I'm going to set the alarm
for a quarter to 12, okay?

426
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,349
- Okay.
- All right, there. Now, give me the cape.

427
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,078
Come on, it's time.

428
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:16,208
Sam, what are they all staring at?

429
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,556
Love her dress. Hate her.

430
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:18,399
Sam, don't worry, okay?

431
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:24,239
Any guy would have to be completely
insane not to like you, all right?

432
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:27,279
I'm just gonna be standing
right over here. Okay.

433
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:43,453
Do you know you're standing precisely
in the middle of the dance floor?

434
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:49,836
Fate has brought us together right here
at this anointed hour...

435
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,234
...under the shimmering disco ball.

436
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:55,770
Terry.

437
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,169
- Are you Nomad?
- Nomad?

438
00:34:59,914 --> 00:35:05,045
Indeed. I have travelled through time
and space to find you.

439
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,449
Now join me in the
mating dance of Zion.

440
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,586
Terry, that's nice.

441
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:20,824
Hey, I know that girl from somewhere.

442
00:35:23,738 --> 00:35:28,175
- I'm thirsty. I gotta get some punch...
- Some libations for the fair maiden?

443
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,503
Your wish is my command.

444
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,846
I knew this was too good to be true.

445
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,323
Princeton Girl?

446
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,232
Austin Ames?

447
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,234
- You're Nomad?
- Yeah, I guess my costume doesn't do...

448
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:01,000
...a very good job at hiding who I am.
- No, I know exactly who you are.

449
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:05,544
I'm sorry. This was a really big mistake.
I've gotta go.

450
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,615
Wait. Wait!

451
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:12,878
Wait. It's not a mistake.

452
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:18,488
- Don't you know who I am?
- Of course I do. You're Princeton Girl.

453
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:22,060
You're the girl I've been waiting to meet.
I know exactly who you are.

454
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,788
What's your name?

455
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,866
Your sweet libations, my lady.

456
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:29,264
Mr. Anderson.

457
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:35,934
Austin Ames with the lady.
A devastating blow!

458
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,843
A worthy opponent.

459
00:36:44,552 --> 00:36:48,921
- What about your girlfriend?
- It's over.

460
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,533
I guess you were expecting some guy
who hangs out at Starbucks...

461
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:05,570
...and writes poetry.
- Something like that.

462
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,365
Come on, you're Austin Ames.

463
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,340
You're football captain
and student body president.

464
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:16,275
And closet poet?
You can't be both guys.

465
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,908
- I'm not.
- Then who are you?

466
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:24,751
On September 7th, I wrote you:

467
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:29,363
"I live in a world full of people pretending
to be something they're not.

468
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,466
- "But when I talk to you... 
- "I'm the guy I wanna be. "

469
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,931
Give me a chance to be that guy.

470
00:37:37,405 --> 00:37:39,965
Do you want to join me
for a stroll outside?

471
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:43,633
If you wanna be voted homecoming prince,
you'd better stay inside to see, you know?

472
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:46,575
I really don't care about becoming
homecoming prince.

473
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:11,533
So, Princeton Girl, would you tell me
who you are if I guessed it right?

474
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,903
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

475
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:17,874
- Well, how about we play 20 questions?
- How about 10?

476
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,637
I'll take what I can get.

477
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,018
Okay, first question.

478
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,287
You do actually go to
North Valley High School, right?

479
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:30,651
- Of course!
- Look, I'm just checking.

480
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:33,225
I mean, you never know
with the Internet.

481
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:36,056
Okay, next question.

482
00:38:38,032 --> 00:38:41,195
Were you disappointed when you
found out that I was Nomad?

483
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:46,338
- Be honest.
- Surprisingly, no.

484
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:49,604
Did you vote for me for
student body president?

485
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,940
- Surprisingly, yes.
- Really?

486
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:56,415
Okay, I got it. Given the choice...

487
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,712
...would you rather have a rice cake
or a Big Mac?

488
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:04,688
- A Big Mac. But what does that matter?
- Well, I like a girl with a hearty appetite.

489
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:09,125
And besides, you just eliminated about
50 percent of the girls in our class.

490
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:18,336
You'd think I'd remember those eyes.

491
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,332
They're so beautiful.

492
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:26,308
Next question.

493
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,044
What's up, girl?

494
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:33,050
- What are you supposed to be?
- A Three Musketeer.

495
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,383
- You don't look like a candy bar.
- Right.

496
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:39,025
Look, now that you
and Austin are toast...

497
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:42,328
...okay, why don't we
have our own little party?

498
00:39:42,496 --> 00:39:45,522
- Back off, David.
- Come on, Shelby. I know you like me.

499
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:47,826
- No. Stop it. No!
- I know... I know it.

500
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:49,731
- No, stop it. Stop!
- Come on.

501
00:39:49,904 --> 00:39:53,237
The lady said, "Stop. "

502
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,207
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

503
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:57,674
- Give me that!
- Oh, God.

504
00:39:58,112 --> 00:40:00,376
I believe you just saw your life flash
before your eyes.

505
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:06,048
Oh, yeah? Well, did you see the part
where I run away?

506
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,392
- That was awesome.
- Oh, you're dead, taco boy!

507
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:19,396
Ladies.

508
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:24,000
- You're mine!
- Move over, please.

509
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:36,243
- It's over, dude.
- Oh, yeah?

510
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:39,045
- Yeah.
- Well, I hate to tell you this, dude...

511
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,984
...but I starred in Pirates of Penzance
three summers in a row.

512
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,223
- Oh, yeah?
- Say hello to act two, scene one.

513
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:08,911
If I ask you to dance,
does that count as a question?

514
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,607
There's no music.

515
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:13,948
So?

516
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:52,108
All out of questions?

517
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,879
Do you believe in love at first sight?

518
00:42:56,924 --> 00:42:59,085
I'll let you know.

519
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,795
- But I've seen you before?
- Yes.

520
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:09,635
Man. How could I have
seen you before...

521
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:11,598
...and not know who you are now?

522
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:16,068
Maybe you were looking,
but you weren't really seeing.

523
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,572
- You've got one more question left.
- Okay.

524
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:29,649
Do you, Princeton Girl...

525
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,416
...feel like you made the right choice
meeting me here tonight?

526
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:38,194
I do.

527
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:43,833
And do you, Austin Ames,
ever wanna see me again after tonight?

528
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,835
I'd have to think about that.

529
00:43:50,644 --> 00:43:52,441
Absolutely.

530
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:03,984
Not now.

531
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:06,456
- What?
- I've gotta go.

532
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:09,492
- What, you have a curfew or something?
- Something like that.

533
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:13,861
I'm sorry, but thank you.
This has been the most amazing night.

534
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,898
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm late.

535
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,302
- For what?
- Reality.

536
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,221
I was right in the middle
of a power jam, Mrs. Wells.

537
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:38,586
- You totally harshed my mellow.
- You'll get over it and live.

538
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,786
Hello! It is almost midnight.

539
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:46,899
And that means it's time to announce
who we have selected...

540
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,701
- What's up, dog?
- Have you seen the girl I was with?

541
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,031
No, I haven't seen her,
but you missed it.

542
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:54,174
David beat some kid's butt. It was crazy.

543
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:58,340
Now, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

544
00:44:58,512 --> 00:45:02,004
- Carter? Carter. Carter, come on.
- Your new North Valley High...

545
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:04,241
...homecoming prince and princess...

546
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:08,218
- I'm gonna be late.
... are Prince Charming and Cinderella!

547
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:11,689
It's you, bro. It's you.

548
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,757
My dear, I must bid you adieu.
I'm sorry.

549
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:21,264
- A what?
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.

550
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,269
Hurry up!

551
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:31,034
Bravo! There he is, bravo!
Looks like Cinderella is playing hard to get.

552
00:45:57,704 --> 00:46:02,198
- I almost kissed Austin Ames!
- I totally, totally kissed Shelby Cummings!

553
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:07,075
Wait, so, what...? What did he say
when he found out that you were you?

554
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:11,013
He didn't say, because he didn't find out.

555
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,710
You didn't tell him? Why not?

556
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:17,050
Carter, I live in an attic, okay?

557
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:22,423
I drive a beat-up old car
and he's expecting Malibu Barbie.

558
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:25,292
I'll be doing him a favor
if I just disappear.

559
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:27,628
- Shotgun.
- Oh, no, I'm shotgun.

560
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,530
- Get in already.
- Stop pulling.

561
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,433
Where are your crowns?
Where are your prizes?

562
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:36,042
- Winners get prizes.
- We didn't win, Mom.

563
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,838
Some girl stole it from us.

564
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:43,841
I am very, very, very, very upset
about this.

565
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:49,078
- You don't look upset.
- It's the Botox.

566
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:51,986
I can't show emotion
for another hour and a half.

567
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,754
- I told you she wanted me bad.
- Carter, just drive.

568
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:02,659
- Spam?
- Spam?

569
00:47:03,971 --> 00:47:05,802
Mom!

570
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:09,101
- It's Sam! Over there.
- Over there.

571
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:13,243
Hi, Mrs. Montgomery.

572
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:20,578
- Mom, she was there. She's in the car.
- We saw her, Mom.

573
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,281
That's ridiculous.
She's working tonight.

574
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:27,222
- She would never disobey me.
- She was there.

575
00:47:27,394 --> 00:47:29,021
- She was with that boy.
- In the car.

576
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:30,823
- I saw...
- Shut your cat face.

577
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:36,466
- Did they see me?
- No, I don't think so...

578
00:47:36,637 --> 00:47:40,334
...but the wannabe Olsen twins
might have.

579
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,245
Carter, I know you wanna take care of this car,
but please can you step on it?

580
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,777
In case you haven't noticed, I'm already
going 38 in a 35-mile zone, Sam...

581
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,149
...so can you just lay off, please?

582
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,058
Come on, catch up to them.

583
00:47:59,226 --> 00:48:02,593
Mother, will you speed up?
We've got to beat Sam back to the diner.

584
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:06,358
Shut up, girls. We'll be back
at the diner soon enough.

585
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,433
Soon enough isn't soon enough!

586
00:48:09,036 --> 00:48:11,504
What are you doing?
Take your paw off the gas!

587
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:13,367
I can't. It's stuck!

588
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:29,448
Go, go!

589
00:48:29,856 --> 00:48:32,620
Carter, you could've totally
made that light.

590
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:37,526
FYI, Sam, yellow means slow down,
okay? Not speed up.

591
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:41,657
I need "The Fast and the Furious",
not "Driving Miss Daisy".

592
00:48:44,438 --> 00:48:47,532
We're gonna die!

593
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:51,342
Was that...?
Huh, huh...

594
00:48:56,149 --> 00:49:00,051
- Mother, stop!
- We're gonna die!

595
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:17,936
I think I need to use the litter box.

596
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:22,274
Oh, my God. My face is back.

597
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:30,481
- I told you she wasn't here.
- No dope.

598
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:33,245
- Where is Sam?
- What do you mean, where is Sam?

599
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,911
- Where do you think she is?
- She better be here.

600
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:40,185
Fiona, I was gonna talk to you about
something that I really... Fiona, wait!

601
00:49:42,129 --> 00:49:44,620
I want to get my breasts done.
Where did you get those?

602
00:49:44,798 --> 00:49:47,198
San Diego. Excuse me.

603
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:51,133
Did you notice how shiny the floors
are since we switched to Mr. Clean?

604
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:54,766
What are you, a commercial? Click.

605
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:56,772
Oh, mommy, oh.

606
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:59,912
Fiona, I'm so glad you're here,
because...

607
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,811
The fish. Nemo is no more. Smell.

608
00:50:03,984 --> 00:50:07,351
- There is a tear in one of the booths.
- We were gonna tell you.

609
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:09,682
What am I supposed to do
with a dead fish?

610
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:13,185
Everyone, shut up!

611
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,096
When I find her, I'm gonna wring her...

612
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,061
Order's up.

613
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:25,335
- Sam. What are you doing back there?
- Just working on my cooking skills.

614
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,532
Yeah, I was teaching her to make
pancakes with salmon.

615
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,974
How was the dance, girls?

616
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:36,712
You know, something stinks
around here.

617
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:39,351
And it's not the fish.

618
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:45,513
You're gonna get it. Come on, girls.

619
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:58,867
We made it and not a scratch.

620
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,874
- Girls, come on.
- You bit me, you dumb face.

621
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:09,413
The car smells like bad cheese.

622
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:18,748
- Don't put your dirty paws all over me.
- Pushing me.

623
00:51:24,464 --> 00:51:26,227
What is he doing here?

624
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,834
Tonight must be my lucky night.

625
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,943
Okay.

626
00:51:56,429 --> 00:51:57,828
Mrs. Montgomery...

627
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:02,063
...your sign hit my...

628
00:52:02,736 --> 00:52:04,533
...car.

629
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,307
<i>- Gozaimasu, Fighting Frogs.
Here's your daily drought reminder:</i>

630
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:12,138
<i>Only flush for number two.</i>

631
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:16,772
Austin Ames was crowned prince
of the homecoming dance.

632
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:20,044
Big shocker there.
Didn't see that one coming.

633
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,247
But the real mystery, though,
is who was his princess?

634
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:28,121
- How long are you grounded for?
- Well, how long is forever?

635
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,957
- So you're not gonna tell Austin?
- Come on, Carter.

636
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:36,091
It's not like he's gonna be pinning for me.
Trust me, he's forgotten all about Cinderella by now.

637
00:52:47,948 --> 00:52:50,678
Yeah, he's obviously forgotten
all about you.

638
00:52:55,989 --> 00:52:59,390
Dude, why are you going through
all this trouble for one chick?

639
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:03,586
Look, she's not just some chick, all right?
She was real.

640
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,290
- Real. Like, she still had her old nose.
- No, real.

641
00:53:07,467 --> 00:53:10,265
The kind of girl who has more on her mind
than what she wears...

642
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,496
...or how much weight she wants to lose.

643
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:14,663
- She listens to me.
- Listens to you?

644
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:18,777
Hey, brother, I listen to you, okay?
I feel your pai...

645
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:23,546
- Hello, kitty.
- Yeah, you're a great listener.

646
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:26,049
- Well...
- Look, man, you found her cell phone.

647
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,416
- You just gotta get some clue from that.
- The phone's locked.

648
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:33,081
I keep getting messages like, "I need you,"
and, "Come see me now. "

649
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,252
- Oh, dude, it's so hot.
- See, that's what I thought.

650
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:42,426
- Until I got one that said, "Come fix fryer. "
- Oh, dude, that's hot and kinky, baby.

651
00:53:42,602 --> 00:53:46,561
You know what I'm saying? Can I get one?
Let me get a pound, baby.

652
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:50,540
He's looking for you everywhere.
You gotta tell him it was you.

653
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,440
Isn't it better to cling
to the dream of what might've been...

654
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:56,013
...instead of ruining everything
with reality?

655
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:58,776
- You can't hide from him forever.
- Not forever.

656
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:02,683
Just until graduation, when I leave
this place and never see him again.

657
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:06,690
Okay, so, what about you, Zorro?
When are you gonna tell Shelby?

658
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,455
Well, I've been thinking about doing
just that, as a matter of fact.

659
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:15,863
Right. Okay, so the day you tell Shelby
it was you, I'll tell Austin it was me.

660
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:18,470
- Deal.
- Deal.

661
00:54:18,638 --> 00:54:20,799
Look in the yearbook again,
maybe you've missed her.

662
00:54:20,974 --> 00:54:27,106
- Maybe she's foreign exchange. That's hot.
- Totally. That's, like... That's, like, le hot.</i>

663
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,376
Look, there's no way I missed her.
I mean, we had a connection.

664
00:54:39,426 --> 00:54:42,418
- Thanks.
- Jeez, are you okay?

665
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:55,503
Keep your legs straight.
Straighter, straighter.

666
00:54:55,675 --> 00:55:01,079
What are you doing? Brianna!
After the flip, it's the butterfly rollover.

667
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:03,374
- No, it's not. It's mermaid plunge!
- Yes!

668
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,145
Oh, my God. I cannot wait
for my solo career!

669
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,652
When are we going solo?

670
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:14,351
He was so mysterious,
but really obvious at the same time.

671
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:20,830
I mean, kind of dangerous, but very safe.
And wild, but tame.

672
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:24,068
I'm gonna go change.

673
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:27,169
I cannot believe you're gonna tell Shelby
it was you.

674
00:55:27,374 --> 00:55:32,539
Sam, once she realizes that she's found
her Zorro, okay, she'll be thrilled.

675
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:37,046
- Now, watch and learn.
- Good luck.

676
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:41,153
- And, oh, my God, when I kissed him, I...
- Enough already.

677
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:46,958
Madison, I think somebody's got a green
monster on their back called Mr. Jealousy.

678
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:52,690
- Shelby, baby, what's up?
- And you are?

679
00:55:54,934 --> 00:56:00,133
Yeah. Allow me to refresh your memory.

680
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:06,168
- Zorro.
- You mean Zero.

681
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:08,574
- Who is he?
- That's Carter Farrell.

682
00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:11,080
He's the guy you cheat off
of in Algebra II.

683
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:13,883
The freak who hums show tunes?

684
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,388
- I'm in front.
- Quit it.

685
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:22,994
Sorry.

686
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,188
- Let me in the front.
- Listen.

687
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:29,734
Last night I had a very bad cold,
and I drank a whole bottle of NyQuil.

688
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:35,500
- I just wasn't myself.
- But I thought we had, like, a connection.

689
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,737
Okay. We don't have anything.

690
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:43,872
We are from completely different 
classes of human.

691
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,019
Let's just go back to our usual lives,
where we only mingle...

692
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:50,554
...when I copy you in Algebra II, okay?

693
00:56:52,459 --> 00:56:55,519
- "Okay?"
- We didn't rehearse it!

694
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,926
Was that good?

695
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:08,535
You all right?

696
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:12,804
If she thinks she's still cheating off me,
she's crazy.

697
00:57:12,979 --> 00:57:15,243
<i>- Guys, I don't know about this.
- Come on.</i>

698
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,980
- Just trust us.
- We asked every girl...

699
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:21,450
...if they were with you at the dance.
These said yes.

700
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:26,183
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- Austin! Introduce me on the cell phone.

701
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:29,884
- Guys, come on.
- Sit down here.

702
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:32,930
Okay! Austin Ames!

703
00:57:33,266 --> 00:57:36,861
Let's bring out bachelorette number one!

704
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:40,767
She's a transfer from Woodland Hills,
enjoys collecting puka shells...

705
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:43,670
...long walks on the beach
and getting tubed.

706
00:57:43,843 --> 00:57:45,504
Pleased to meet you, Missy!

707
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:49,238
- What's up, Austin?
- Thanks for coming, Missy.

708
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:53,008
- See you, dude.
- You're dead.

709
00:57:53,186 --> 00:57:57,452
Okay, okay, let's bring out
bachelorette number two!

710
00:57:57,624 --> 00:58:00,149
This little filly's into barbells...

711
00:58:00,326 --> 00:58:05,423
...World War II and protein shakes.
Here's Helga.

712
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:07,662
Thank you.

713
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:10,526
You are so dead.

714
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:16,766
- Okay, okay, next up is...
- Enough, enough. Guys, come on.

715
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:22,777
Look, you're beautiful, okay?
But I'm not your prince.

716
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:26,883
- You'll meet him someday, but it's not me.
- Thanks, Austin.

717
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:30,288
- Late entry.
- David, you stop it right now.

718
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:33,448
You're a bad boy,
and that is a terrible shirt.

719
00:58:34,527 --> 00:58:36,961
Everybody, back to your class.

720
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:38,927
Hi, Ryan.

721
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:40,928
That's not fair!

722
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:51,941
Don't want that, don't want that,
don't want that, don't want...

723
00:59:04,257 --> 00:59:08,421
Accepted? Oh, this won't do.

724
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:15,332
- Hey. Anything in the mail for me?
- Oh, actually...

725
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:18,902
...there's a personalized letter here
from Ed McMahon...

726
00:59:19,072 --> 00:59:22,599
...saying you just won a million dollars.

727
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:26,139
Don't spend it all in one place.

728
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:41,186
<i>I need to know who you are.
I can't take my mind off you.</i>

729
00:59:41,728 --> 00:59:43,719
<i>Please tell me who you are.</i>

730
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,569
Okay.

731
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:57,306
- My name is...
- Sam!

732
00:59:57,477 --> 01:00:01,709
- I guess you missed the "Do Not Disturb" sign.
- No, I saw it.

733
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:04,941
So you almost done with my report?
It's due Friday.

734
01:00:05,118 --> 01:00:07,552
- I'm working on it.
- Well, hurry up.

735
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:10,117
It makes me nervous
to have to wait for it.

736
01:00:10,423 --> 01:00:13,859
Imagine how nervous you'd be
if you actually had to write it.

737
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:17,255
My God, you're right.

738
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:21,264
So this time, could you try
to make it sound more like me?

739
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:24,835
I'm so sick of having to explain
why I sound so smart on paper...

740
01:00:25,004 --> 01:00:28,235
...and so not smart not on paper.

741
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:32,266
<i>- Sam? Can you come downstairs?</i>
- I'll be right there.

742
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:34,569
<i>Now!</i>

743
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:40,346
I'll be right back.

744
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,616
Hurry up.

745
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,637
Who the heck is Nomad?

746
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:07,804
"Cinderella, are you not talking to me
because you freaked...

747
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,073
"...when you found out I'm...

748
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,685
"...Austin Ames?"

749
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,917
Sam is Cinderella?

750
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,826
- I got in.
- Austin!

751
01:01:29,003 --> 01:01:31,870
- Austin.
- What?

752
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:36,076
What's going on?

753
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:38,142
Nothing.

754
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:43,311
Let me guess. You're thinking,
"Is USC really the right choice for me?"

755
01:01:43,485 --> 01:01:46,750
Well, yeah. I've been thinking
a lot about this and...

756
01:01:46,921 --> 01:01:52,325
Don't worry about it. You're making
the right choice, alright?

757
01:01:56,865 --> 01:01:58,560
Okay.

758
01:01:58,733 --> 01:02:02,965
It's me, Austin. It's Cinderella,
from the dance.

759
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:06,504
Oh, you found me.

760
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,906
Oh, no.

761
01:02:09,711 --> 01:02:13,511
You see, Austin, I live in this world... 

762
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:17,845
Full of people pretending
to be something they're not.

763
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:21,785
- Pretending...
- I miss you. I don't want...

764
01:02:21,956 --> 01:02:23,617
I got it.

765
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:28,955
- How are you doing?
- Good.

766
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,261
- Regular wash?
- No, more like the royal treatment.

767
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:39,873
I mean, that's what Cinderella
would want.

768
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:42,966
- What did you just say?
- I'm her, Austin.

769
01:02:43,144 --> 01:02:46,136
I'm Cinderella, your dream girl.

770
01:02:46,314 --> 01:02:50,273
- You see, I live in a world full of...
- You!

771
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:53,352
What are you doing here?

772
01:02:54,088 --> 01:02:58,320
I'm Cinderella,
coming to meet my prince.

773
01:02:58,826 --> 01:03:01,886
That's a little hard,
considering I'm Cinderella.

774
01:03:02,063 --> 01:03:05,191
I mean, I'm the most "Cinderelly"
Cinderella there ever was.

775
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:08,426
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Look, I can settle this, all right?

776
01:03:08,603 --> 01:03:12,937
The girl that I met at the dance,
she dropped something on her way out.

777
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:17,074
- What was it?
- Oh, that's easy.

778
01:03:17,245 --> 01:03:19,577
- A wallet.
- No.

779
01:03:20,148 --> 01:03:25,780
- I meant a wallet-purse.
- No.

780
01:03:26,054 --> 01:03:28,045
Oh, a fish!

781
01:03:28,756 --> 01:03:30,815
- A fish?
- It was the first thing...

782
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:34,484
...that popped into my head.
You said, "wallet-purse. " What's that?

783
01:03:34,662 --> 01:03:37,688
- Austin?
- Well...

784
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,164
Look what you did. See?
You always ruin everything.

785
01:03:42,337 --> 01:03:44,965
I was supposed to be Cinderella.
I'm the oldest.

786
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:51,305
By a minute and 26 seconds.
And you never let me forget it!

787
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:58,215
- Well, maybe this will help you remember.
- No.

788
01:03:58,386 --> 01:04:00,013
Come here!

789
01:04:01,055 --> 01:04:04,547
You're dead. I'm gonna kill you!

790
01:04:09,297 --> 01:04:11,026
Bri?

791
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:18,038
Oh, I'm gonna kill you! Get off!

792
01:04:19,173 --> 01:04:25,339
- That's what you get for stealing my idea!
- Hey, Dad, isn't that our car?

793
01:04:25,847 --> 01:04:28,509
- I hate you!
- I hate you!

794
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,385
- Oh, no!
- Not the...

795
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:43,257
- Hot wax!
- Hot wax!

796
01:05:15,096 --> 01:05:17,291
Thank you. Have a good night.

797
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:23,399
- Bobby, can I get two BLT's?
- It's coming.

798
01:05:25,306 --> 01:05:27,035
<i>That's him.</i>

799
01:05:27,241 --> 01:05:31,610
<i>- It's cute. Go over.
- No.</i>

800
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:45,288
Hey.

801
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,728
Can I get you something?

802
01:05:49,197 --> 01:05:51,222
Do you know what bugs me?

803
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,129
- People taking your order?
- No.

804
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,465
Taking people's orders.

805
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:03,235
- Why would you do that?
- You don't know my dad.

806
01:06:04,412 --> 01:06:08,280
Sushi and doughnuts? Who does that?

807
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:13,342
- I'll take a coffee. Thank you.
- Excuse me, miss?

808
01:06:16,023 --> 01:06:19,322
Do you ever feel like if you show
someone who you really are...

809
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:21,291
...they won't accept you?

810
01:06:21,963 --> 01:06:24,625
Yeah. I do.

811
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:28,691
Like being yourself isn't good enough.

812
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:32,864
- Right.
- Like you're wearing a mask.

813
01:06:34,342 --> 01:06:35,775
That's exactly how I feel.

814
01:06:37,879 --> 01:06:41,679
You just wanna be honest with this person
and tell them, "It's me.

815
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,884
"I'm the one that you've
been looking for. "

816
01:06:45,052 --> 01:06:46,986
Yeah.

817
01:06:47,955 --> 01:06:49,820
Austin...

818
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:52,859
...I'm...
- Sam!

819
01:06:54,562 --> 01:06:56,553
- One second.
- No, now.

820
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,332
No, it's cool, I gotta bounce.

821
01:07:05,673 --> 01:07:07,197


822
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:12,309
Thank you very much, Sam.

823
01:07:15,316 --> 01:07:16,840
You're welcome.

824
01:07:17,018 --> 01:07:20,385
<i>Bonjour, Fighting Frogs.
Here's your daily drought reminder:</i>

825
01:07:20,555 --> 01:07:24,491
<i>Don't hose your lawn, your car,
or anybody else, for that matter.</i>

826
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:27,556
<i>And remember, tickets
for the big game go on sale...</i>

827
01:07:27,728 --> 01:07:33,257
And then she told us that she was
going to try to steal...

828
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:36,562
...Austin away from you
if that was the last thing she did.

829
01:07:37,538 --> 01:07:41,338
Our stepsister has always been jealous of you.

830
01:07:43,744 --> 01:07:45,006
Go on.

831
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:48,876
Well, that's when she invented
this whole Cinderella plot.

832
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:51,581
She got ahold of Austin's
e- mail address...

833
01:07:51,752 --> 01:07:54,550
...and that's when she
started the whole affair.

834
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:59,182
We only wanted to tell you sooner,
but she threatened to kill us.

835
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,692
She's such a monster.

836
01:08:03,164 --> 01:08:06,691
Look, if you don't believe us,
look at the e-mails.

837
01:08:07,101 --> 01:08:11,868
She goes by Princeton Girl 818,
but her real name is Sam Montgomery.

838
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:13,901
And we're Brianna and Gabriella.

839
01:08:17,411 --> 01:08:22,041
So that little boyfriend stealer
thinks she can pull a fast one on me?

840
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,476
Well, we'll just see about that.

841
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:37,422
Austin was really late today and asked me
if you'd read this announcement.

842
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:42,998
Cinderella...

843
01:08:43,271 --> 01:08:48,709
<i>...if you're listening, your prince wants to
rendezvous with you after the pep rally.</i>

844
01:08:49,243 --> 01:08:52,610
<i>Nothing like a pep rally
to warm up our prince.</i>

845
01:09:03,391 --> 01:09:06,758
Carter! I talked to him.
And not as Cinderella.

846
01:09:06,928 --> 01:09:10,125
I talked to him as me, Sam,
and he didn't hate me.

847
01:09:10,298 --> 01:09:12,266
So you told him everything?

848
01:09:12,433 --> 01:09:15,527
No, not everything. Not the part
about me being Cinderella.

849
01:09:15,703 --> 01:09:19,639
But I'm gonna go tell him right after
the pep rally. You coming, cowboy?

850
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:23,771
- So you think I look like a real cowboy?
- Sure.

851
01:09:53,341 --> 01:09:56,208
- Who're we gonna beat?
- The Lancers!

852
01:09:56,377 --> 01:09:58,504
- And when're we gonna beat them?
- Friday!

853
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,375
Good news, buddy. I just got off
the phone with Hank Cole.

854
01:10:01,549 --> 01:10:05,485
You play well on Friday, and your future
is set at USC football.

855
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:08,514
That's great, Dad.

856
01:10:09,724 --> 01:10:11,988
And who's gonna lead us to victory?

857
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,593
- Austin!
- I can't hear you!

858
01:10:14,762 --> 01:10:17,094
- Kill the Lancers!
- Austin!

859
01:10:21,435 --> 01:10:25,269
The cheerleaders have put together
a little sketch to help get us in the spirit.

860
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:30,470
I love you, Shelby!

861
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:31,975
Thank you.

862
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:36,746
"Once upon a time, there was
a big, strong Fighting Frog.

863
01:10:37,518 --> 01:10:42,512
"He had a beautiful girlfriend and his dad
owned the biggest pond in all the land.

864
01:10:43,524 --> 01:10:45,515
"But he still wasn't happy.

865
01:10:48,562 --> 01:10:51,725
"If only he can find a princess,
then she could kiss him...

866
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:55,801
"...turn him into a prince,
and they would run away together.

867
01:10:59,607 --> 01:11:03,737
"One night, after the slimy frog ditches his super-hot
senior-poll-most-popular girlfriend...

868
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:07,608
"...he meets his princess. "

869
01:11:07,782 --> 01:11:09,249
Your highness.

870
01:11:12,086 --> 01:11:15,920
"Alas, it turned out that our frog
not only had a secret identity...

871
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:21,790
"...but also had a secret e-mail relationship
with a pen pal named Princeton Girl. "

872
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:23,927
This isn't good.

873
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:27,431
Dear Princeton Girl, I can't wait
till we finally get to meet.

874
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:30,092
You're the only one
who understands the real me.

875
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:32,671
The man who doesn't want
to play USC football.

876
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,105
But who wants to be at Princeton,
with you.

877
01:11:36,477 --> 01:11:39,913
- What are they talking about?
- Nothing.

878
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:44,984
Dear Nomad, I want you to know
who I am, but I'm scared!

879
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:48,048
I'm scared that you'll reject me.

880
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:52,420
And I've never had a real kiss before.

881
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:56,628
- I can't believe they're reading my e-mails.
- Let's go.

882
01:11:56,797 --> 01:11:58,594
But our princess had a secret too.

883
01:11:58,766 --> 01:12:04,500
She wasn't royalty at all, but a geek,
a loser, a servant girl.

884
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:11,634
Yeah!

885
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:14,039
Any ideas about this?

886
01:12:16,484 --> 01:12:19,146
And who, may you ask, is this imposter?

887
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:25,156
Give it up for the pretend princess,
diner girl, Sam Montgomery!

888
01:12:30,998 --> 01:12:36,026
<i>Diner girl! Diner girl!
Diner girl! Diner girl!</i>

889
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,744
Come on.

890
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,928
- Sam!
- Go away!

891
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:14,734
But, Sam, you've got a letter
from Princeton.

892
01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:23,879
What does it say?

893
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:32,387
I didn't get in.

894
01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:36,763
Oh, no!

895
01:13:38,532 --> 01:13:40,363
And you studied so hard.

896
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:43,328
I can't believe I actually thought
I had a chance.

897
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:46,439
Sam, I'm heartbroken.

898
01:13:46,807 --> 01:13:49,867
Life can be so unfair.

899
01:13:50,878 --> 01:13:53,142
Well, just look at the bright side.

900
01:13:53,681 --> 01:13:57,242
You have a job at the diner
for the rest of your life.

901
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:02,112
You want a cookie?

902
01:14:06,227 --> 01:14:07,956
They're so moist.

903
01:15:20,234 --> 01:15:23,499
People like her don't belong
in our world, Austin.

904
01:16:06,246 --> 01:16:08,180
Sam, what are you doing?

905
01:16:09,049 --> 01:16:11,574
I'm trying to get these floors clean.

906
01:16:13,454 --> 01:16:15,615
Come on, sweetie, get up.

907
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:19,185
What I meant is, what are you
doing with your life?

908
01:16:19,526 --> 01:16:22,859
I'm diner girl. I'm doing what
diner girls do, Rhonda.

909
01:16:23,597 --> 01:16:27,966
Baby, what's gotten into you? You don't
even realize how blessed you are.

910
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:32,003
Look, you've got a whole family
behind you.

911
01:16:33,574 --> 01:16:35,405
We have faith in you.

912
01:16:35,576 --> 01:16:37,544
And you gotta have faith in yourself.

913
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,565
Mother!

914
01:17:00,734 --> 01:17:04,067
- Sam just ruined your wall.
- What?

915
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:08,436
Yes, you did. Well, that's gonna come
out of your paycheck.

916
01:17:10,344 --> 01:17:12,835
And cover up those stupid words.

917
01:17:13,313 --> 01:17:18,080
"Never let the fear of striking out
keep you from playing the game. "

918
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:23,153
All right. I'm going off to
get some more lipo.

919
01:17:23,323 --> 01:17:26,759
Come on, girls. Sam, I need you
to clean the pool tonight.

920
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:28,992
No.

921
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:35,796
Excuse me?

922
01:17:35,969 --> 01:17:39,166
You heard me. I quit.

923
01:17:39,339 --> 01:17:44,003
I quit this job. I quit your family.
And I'm moving out.

924
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:51,342
Oh, and where are you gonna live?

925
01:17:51,652 --> 01:17:53,381
With me.

926
01:17:55,956 --> 01:17:58,083
You can't just walk out on me.

927
01:17:58,358 --> 01:17:59,586
You know what, Fiona?

928
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,627
You can mess with your hair,
your nose and your face...

929
01:18:02,796 --> 01:18:05,128
...and you can even mess
with my dad's diner.

930
01:18:05,499 --> 01:18:07,694
But you're through messing with me.

931
01:18:09,169 --> 01:18:10,500
Wait up, Sam.

932
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:14,573
You take one more step and you're fired.

933
01:18:14,741 --> 01:18:18,541
Oh, no, that won't be necessary,
because I quit too. And you know what?

934
01:18:18,712 --> 01:18:23,877
The only reason why I stayed aroud and put up with
you all these years is because of that girl.

935
01:18:24,251 --> 01:18:28,210
Now that she's free of you, nothing
is stopping me from kicking your butt.

936
01:18:28,555 --> 01:18:32,491
Come on, no. Not my face. It's much
newer than the girls. Go for the girls!

937
01:18:32,659 --> 01:18:35,560
- Mom!
- Rhonda? Rhonda!

938
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:37,754
She's not even worth it.

939
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:43,562
- You're right.
- You know what? I quit too.

940
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:47,604
Me too. Hey, Rhonda. Eleanor.
Hold up, I need a ride.

941
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:49,668
See you.

942
01:18:51,578 --> 01:18:53,102
Well...

943
01:18:54,114 --> 01:18:55,672
See you.

944
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:00,016
Send me a bill.

945
01:19:03,690 --> 01:19:06,181
Fiona actually thought
you were gonna slug her.

946
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,225
I was gonna do more than that.

947
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,829
I had no idea that you were that tough.

948
01:19:11,798 --> 01:19:14,289
Yeah, but I always knew that you were.

949
01:19:16,203 --> 01:19:17,693
Rhonda...

950
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,935
...are you sure that this is okay?

951
01:19:22,109 --> 01:19:25,135
Sam, I wouldn't have it any other way.

952
01:19:31,318 --> 01:19:34,310
I haven't felt this much at home
in such a long time.

953
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:37,212
I'm sure, compared
to the Addams Family.

954
01:19:40,894 --> 01:19:44,125
- What's on your mind?
- I gotta do something tonight.

955
01:19:44,298 --> 01:19:46,630
Don't wait up for me, okay?

956
01:19:48,602 --> 01:19:52,333
<i>Welcome to the start of tonight's game
between the South Bay Lancers...</i>

957
01:19:52,506 --> 01:19:54,736
<i>...and the North Valley Fighting Frogs!</i>

958
01:19:58,412 --> 01:20:03,873
<i>Big welcome to all returning alumni to
tonight's 38th annual homecoming game!</i>

959
01:20:07,654 --> 01:20:10,122
- Check it!
- Chick at 3 o'clock!

960
01:20:11,425 --> 01:20:14,883
- Hey, diner girl!
- What's she doing in here?

961
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:23,465


962
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,331
Sam.

963
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:28,639
- Okay, I know you think I'm just some...
- Coward? Phony?

964
01:20:28,809 --> 01:20:31,175
- Okay, just listen.
- No, you listen.

965
01:20:31,378 --> 01:20:34,176
You turned out to be exactly
who I thought you were.

966
01:20:34,348 --> 01:20:37,715
I never pretended to be somebody else.
It's been me all along.

967
01:20:37,884 --> 01:20:40,876
And it was me who was hurt
in front of everybody.

968
01:20:41,688 --> 01:20:45,681
Look, I didn't come here
to yell at you, okay?

969
01:20:45,859 --> 01:20:50,091
I came to tell you I know what it feels
like to be afraid to show who you are.

970
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,060
I was. But I'm not anymore.

971
01:20:52,232 --> 01:20:55,360
And the thing is, I really don't care
what people think about me...

972
01:20:55,535 --> 01:20:59,562
...because I believe in myself.
And I know that things are gonna be okay.

973
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:03,904
But even though I have no family
and no job and no money for college...

974
01:21:04,077 --> 01:21:06,409
...it's you that I feel sorry for.

975
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:10,416
- Heads up. Yo, five minutes.
- I'm coming.

976
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:15,881
I know that guy that sent those e-mails
is somewhere down inside of you.

977
01:21:16,056 --> 01:21:18,286
But I can't wait for him...

978
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:22,221
...because waiting for you is like
waiting for rain in this drought.

979
01:21:22,396 --> 01:21:24,830
Useless and disappointing.

980
01:21:28,669 --> 01:21:30,364
Sam.

981
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:44,442
- Sam.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

982
01:21:44,618 --> 01:21:49,214
Rhonda told me where you might be. I
thought you could use a friend. Come here.

983
01:21:51,058 --> 01:21:54,391
Sam, I'm so proud of you.
You did...

984
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:58,156
Your stepmom and Austin,
all in one day. How do you feel?

985
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:02,267
I'll let you know when I can catch
my breath. Let's do something tonight.

986
01:22:02,436 --> 01:22:06,998
Well, I was actually thinking
about going to the game...

987
01:22:07,174 --> 01:22:09,734
...but I understand
if you don't wanna do that.

988
01:22:10,577 --> 01:22:12,067
No, I'll go.

989
01:22:12,713 --> 01:22:14,738
Really? You'll go to the game?

990
01:22:15,248 --> 01:22:18,649
Yeah. I can handle it now.
It'll be our first and last.

991
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:22,585
And besides, if I don't go, who else
is gonna explain the game to you?

992
01:22:25,125 --> 01:22:28,458
I like what you're wearing.
What character are you today?

993
01:22:28,628 --> 01:22:31,927
- Myself.
- I think it's your best look.

994
01:22:32,099 --> 01:22:33,498
Thank you.

995
01:22:34,935 --> 01:22:38,234
<i>Come on, everybody. Weren't they great?
Let's hear it for them.</i>

996
01:22:38,405 --> 01:22:42,068
<i>Let's give our cheerleaders a big hand.
Make some noise.</i>

997
01:22:42,242 --> 01:22:47,270
Austin and I are almost back together.
It isn't official or anything, but it's on.

998
01:22:47,447 --> 01:22:48,846
- Sorry, guys.
- Sorry.

999
01:22:49,015 --> 01:22:53,247
<i>Okay, everybody. Get ready.
Here they come!</i>

1000
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,682
I'm glad you came, Sam.

1001
01:22:54,855 --> 01:23:00,487
<i>The defending regional conference
champions, your very own Fighting Frogs!</i>

1002
01:23:11,538 --> 01:23:14,063
<i>Both the Lancers and the Frogs
enter the game...</i>

1003
01:23:14,241 --> 01:23:16,766
<i>...tied for the lead in the
conference standings.</i>

1004
01:23:16,943 --> 01:23:22,142
<i>The winner of tonight's game will advance
to the playoffs for the state championship.</i>

1005
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:25,474
Austin.

1006
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:29,786
Austin. All right, buddy.
This is the big one, all right?

1007
01:23:29,956 --> 01:23:32,220
You stay focused and win it.

1008
01:23:32,392 --> 01:23:34,860
- Everyone is counting on you. All right?
- Andy!

1009
01:23:35,028 --> 01:23:37,792
Hey, Chuck! How you doing, pal?

1010
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:43,193
Let's do it again! One more time.

1011
01:24:06,793 --> 01:24:11,093
Down, set, 28 guarding, 28 guarding!

1012
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:14,026
Hike!

1013
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:22,574
<i>The clock is stopped with nine seconds
left in the game.</i>

1014
01:24:22,742 --> 01:24:27,441
<i>- The Frogs need one touchdown to win.
- I love football! I love football!</i>

1015
01:24:28,248 --> 01:24:30,842
I love football!

1016
01:24:32,686 --> 01:24:37,953
<i>Austin! Austin! Austin!
Austin! Austin!</i>

1017
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:54,368
Carter, I thought that I could handle this,
but I really can't. I'm gonna go.

1018
01:25:00,647 --> 01:25:04,174
You know what? I'll tell you
how it ends, okay?

1019
01:25:06,019 --> 01:25:08,214
- Come on!
- Do it, baby!

1020
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:24,030
This is the one. This is the one, Austin.
This is the one.

1021
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:36,010
- Sorry, boys.
- Where are you going?

1022
01:25:36,616 --> 01:25:37,981
What's he...?

1023
01:25:42,656 --> 01:25:43,918
What's the problem?

1024
01:25:44,324 --> 01:25:46,292
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm out of here.

1025
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,693
What? You're throwing away your dream!

1026
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:52,621
No, Dad. Throwing away yours.

1027
01:25:55,035 --> 01:25:57,435
It's your game now. Go get them.

1028
01:26:01,308 --> 01:26:05,005
<i>Substituting for Ames is number 23,
Ryan Henson.</i>

1029
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:08,337
- Austin!
- Austin! Get back here!

1030
01:26:19,826 --> 01:26:22,124
Austin, what are you doing?

1031
01:26:22,796 --> 01:26:25,026
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1032
01:26:54,427 --> 01:26:56,622
Sorry I waited for the rain.

1033
01:26:57,097 --> 01:26:58,621
It's okay.

1034
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:03,230
No!

1035
01:27:04,838 --> 01:27:06,738
Oh, my God.

1036
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:26,448
<i>Touchdown! The Fighting Frogs have won.
They've done it. They won the game.</i>

1037
01:27:26,793 --> 01:27:30,957
Oh, my...
You gotta love high school.

1038
01:27:41,908 --> 01:27:43,637
<i>So we won the big game that day.</i>

1039
01:27:43,810 --> 01:27:46,370
<i>But what I remember most
is that I got my prince.</i>

1040
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:48,537
<i>And a really bad cold.</i>

1041
01:27:50,316 --> 01:27:53,717
<i>After that, it was like everything
fell into place.</i>

1042
01:28:08,768 --> 01:28:13,068
<i>My dad was right. The fairy tale book
did contain something important.</i>

1043
01:28:18,845 --> 01:28:21,473
Take this one and take the
two cars in the front.

1044
01:28:21,648 --> 01:28:24,310
I can pay for those parking tickets!

1045
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:28,943
Actually, I'm selling your cars, Fiona.
For college tuition money.

1046
01:28:29,689 --> 01:28:32,487
What gives you the idea
you can sell our cars?

1047
01:28:32,692 --> 01:28:36,093
- She owns them.
- Exactly. I own them.

1048
01:28:36,262 --> 01:28:40,130
I'm the county district attorney.
Have you ever seen this before?

1049
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,598
I've never seen that before.

1050
01:28:43,703 --> 01:28:46,399
Isn't this your signature
on the witness line?

1051
01:28:47,507 --> 01:28:50,874
I have never seen my
husband's hidden will before.

1052
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:55,710
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come
downtown with me, ma'am.

1053
01:28:58,284 --> 01:29:03,722
<i>That hidden will stated that the house,
the diner and everything belonged to me.</i>

1054
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:09,824
<i>It turned out my stepsisters knew where
Fiona had filed my real acceptance letter from Princeton.</i>

1055
01:29:09,996 --> 01:29:11,520
I got it!

1056
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:17,097
<i>My dad's diner was restored
to its former glory.</i>

1057
01:29:19,973 --> 01:29:22,203
<i>And my stepmother
made a deal with the DA.</i>

1058
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:25,867
<i>She's working off her debt
to society at Hal's...</i>

1059
01:29:26,613 --> 01:29:29,514
<i>...under the watchful eye
of my new partner.</i>

1060
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:41,927
<i>And my stepsisters? They finally put
their teamwork to good use.</i>

1061
01:29:47,767 --> 01:29:52,500
<i>Austin's dad finally came around
and got off his Trojan horse.</i>

1062
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:56,871
<i>Things even cleared up for Carter.</i>

1063
01:29:59,879 --> 01:30:03,542
Anything is possible if you just believe.

1064
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:06,450
<i>He ended up filming a commercial.</i>

1065
01:30:07,587 --> 01:30:10,283
<i>And in addition to
landing that commercial...</i>

1066
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:13,691
<i>...Carter also landed the girl.</i>

1067
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:24,793
<i>The San Fernando Valley
was clear and beautiful...</i>

1068
01:30:24,971 --> 01:30:27,633
<i>...the way it only is after a big rainstorm.</i>

1069
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:34,110
<i>As for Austin and me, well,
I finally got my cell phone back.</i>

1070
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:38,410
<i>We wound up going to Princeton together
and lived happily ever after.</i>

1071
01:30:39,819 --> 01:30:43,255
<i>At least for now.
Hey, I'm only a freshman.</i>

1072
