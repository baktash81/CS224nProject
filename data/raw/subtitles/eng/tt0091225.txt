What's in the bag?

364
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,588
I'm doing fine,
thank you very much.

365
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,212
Let me out of here. Ouch.

366
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,258
Excuse me,
could I help you with that?

367
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,710
Yes! No!

368
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,842
Why are we stopping?

369
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,216
Hi.
Oh, hi, Beverly.

370
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,300
We had an appointment.

371
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,519

as fast as we could.

It's in there.

375
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,911

It's a bird!

Can you burn a hole through this
with some kind of eye laser?

with my super bill?

Howard, quit holding out!

415
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,598
I want you to concentrate
and read my mind!

416
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,805

into the future

You can't leave!

Oh, yeah? Why not?

427
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,739
Because there are
papers to be written,

there's symposiums
to give, lecture tours.

to the science hall of fame.

“Let's cut him into little pieces

"and see what color
his organs are!"

A, what I'm doing here,

439

and B, how I'm gonna get back.

440
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,859
Piece of cake.
A, I'm just the guy to help,

441
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,109
and that's because
B, I've already got a theory.

442
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,360
What theory?

443
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:04,114
Well, this is, of course,
the evolutionary ladder,

from monkey to...

exactly like ours,

of the dominant species

was not a monkey, but a duck!

knows this stuff.

This is my friend Carter, and this is Dr.
Walter Jenning,

924
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,115
and I told 'em
all about you, Howard.

925
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,864
You were obviously right.

926
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,944
Show him the evidence.

What evidence?

928
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,616
We tested them, and they're
both from the same fowl.

929
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,038
You, Howard.

930
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,620

don't go berserk! No!

to me, small visitor.

934
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,390

935
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,807
Hmm'?

936
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,392
CARTER: Dr. Jenning <i>is</i> in charge of
the astrophysics lab at Dynatechnics.

937
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,831
Now, on the night
of September 8...

938
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,106
That's the night
that Howard landed.

939
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,230
Yes, now, on that night,
we were initiating

940
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,062
our first full-scale test
of the laser spectroscope.

941
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,818
This was shot
during the experiment.

942
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,817
It was just a routine
procedure meant to measure

943
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,779
the density of the gases
that surround Alpha Centauri.

944
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,080
However, partway through
the experiment,

945
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:46,787
there was a deviation and we lost
control of the laser spectroscope.

946
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,046
What do you mean, lost control?

947
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:54,343
Some unknown force was redirecting the
laser beam from its original target

948
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,420
so that it hit
your planet instead.

949
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,553
Hit my planet? How about
hit my living room?

950
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,225
Talk about an
invasion of privacy.

951
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,553
When the beam hit, you
must have been caught up

952
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,604
in a massive energy inversion

953
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,274
which literally
dragged you through space

954
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,852
back to the power source
here on Earth.

955
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,187
Radical.

956
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,241
JENNING: In the lab that night,
we saw a single feather fall.

957
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,491
Oh.

958
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,116
We weren't aware that
the rest of you, Howard,

959
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,203
had landed in that alley
just 2 miles away.

960
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,458
Any questions?

961
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,631
Yeah. Where are my pants?

962
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,120
Howard, where are you going?

963
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,793
To this lab of theirs.
What for'?

964
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,588
<i>To hop back onboard
that laser thing.</i>

965
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:42,175
Then all you have to do is hit the reverse
lever to send me back home, right?

966
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,095
Well, we hadn't considered
reversing the process.

967
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,562
I don't think it's feasible.
Me either.

968
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,765
Now, wait a minute.
If we could generate

969
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,395
a strong enough hypercharge...

970
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,521
You can't do that

971
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,319
You mean the reflex mode might
provoke a total reversal.

972
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,147
It just might be possible.
It won't work.

973
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,482
Yeah.
Sir...

974
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,737
Don't listen to them, Howard.

975
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,365
I have got you booked
on A.M. Cleveland.

976

979
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,538
Look, you guys, could you
really send him back?

980
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,287
JENNING: If we did, we could
establish a continuing link

981
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,997
between our planets,

982
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,503
but he would have to leave tonight,
while the alignment still exists.

983
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,800
We can't afford to wait.

984
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,345
You mean I'm finally
gonna breeze this flytrap?

985
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,967
Ducky, this is what you wanted.

986
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,173
You're going home.

987
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,508
Yeah.
JENNING: Right.

988
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,515
Carter, call Larry. Have him set
up the initiation procedure.

989
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,891
Tell him I'll meet him
at the lab right away.

990
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,813
You and Blumburtt
can bring Howard.

991
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,735
You are about to make history a
second time, my little friend.

992
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,278
Thanks. But once was plenty.

993
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,360
Get to it.
Right.

994
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,989
You know, Howard, we could
hold out for a PBS special...

995
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,160
Phil.

996
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,614
HOWARD: Bev, get dressed.
Aren't you gonna see me off?

997
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,622
Sure, I am. I just hope they
let you take a carry-on bag.

998
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,921
Look, I'm gonna put in these
Polaroids that we took at the club.

are never gonna believe me.

1007
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,980

00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,004
I could have been a contender.

could have fallen into that night,

the first time, but what if...
