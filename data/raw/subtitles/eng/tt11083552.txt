00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,325
Last but not least, Mr. Hill.

519
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,661
OKEY: Well, you're all
sticking to the same story.

520
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,663
That's what happened.

521
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,998
What I don't understand

522
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,533
is how you managed
to take down six men

523
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,268
without even so much
as a scratch.

524
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:17,771
Well, you gotta admit
it's impressive.

525
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:19,538
He saved his partner's life.

526
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,107
What about
your firearms experience?

527
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:25,678
Your shooting was
unambiguously precise, yet

528
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,348
your training scores
were decidedly average.

529
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,383
Barely even passed.

530
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:34,987
Kill or be killed.

All right. (CLEARS THROAT)
Well, there's something else.

533
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,200
We'd like you
to take a look at this video.

534
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,069
It's the security footage

535
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:52,104
from the raid on
the Fortico cash truck before.

536

When the guards were killed.

537
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,407
Uh, I can't watch this again.

OKEY: Step outside,
by all means.

539

We just want
you to let us know

540
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,448
if you think
there's any connection

541
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:04,016
between this robbery

542
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,884
and the men
you encountered before.

543
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,630
You, uh... You all right
to keep watching?

544
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:22,634
Yeah. I'm all right.

548
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:40,285

in any way?

No.

OKEY: You sure?

552
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:51,397
I'm sure.

553
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,567
OKEY: All right, Mr. Hill,

554
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:57,269
we'll pick this up
another day.

555
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,640
Are we done?

556
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,008
Yeah, we'll be in touch.

557
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:06,945
Visit the therapist. Rest up.

558
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,082
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

559
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:17,222
Patrick, can I have a word?

560
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,793
We have a policy.

561
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,660
The shrinks advise

562
00:28:21,728 --> 00:28:23,929
that employees be taken off
the front line for a month

563
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,765
following violent incidents,

564
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:28,233
and longer if lives were lost.

565
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,103
So, we're gonna
transfer you to desk duty,

566
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,772
in case of PTSD.

567
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,072
Do I look disturbed?

568
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:35,775
No. No, you don't.

569
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:38,477
But then, these things
take time to manifest,

570
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,045
to percolate.

571
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:41,980
It's with your best interests
at heart.

572
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,851
You hired me to do a job.
Did a job.

573
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,386
No, we hired you
to move money.

574
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,855
You hired me to protect money.

Hey, I'm Blake Halls.
I own Fortico.

00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,295
I wanted to congratulate you
for yesterday

578
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,063
and to thank you in person.

579
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,232
What you did deserves credit.

580
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,134
You're a real hero,

581
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,603
and that's not wasted on me.

582
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,505
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off

583
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:09,575
while Terry and I
discuss your promising future?

584
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:15,647
Terry, we need that guy
in the field.

585
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,417
If we'd had him last year,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

586
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,486
He's exactly what we need,

587
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,355
and the publicity for Fortico
has been very positive.

588
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,090
Plus, have you heard
the crews talking?

589
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,625
They're inspired.

590
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:29,228
So, don't punish him,
promote him.

Oh, it had him
written all over it.

595
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,539
Question is,
what was he doing there?

596

what he was doing there, boss.

Listen, there's a reason
why I chose you two.

608
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:08,367
Because we have
the same priorities.

in a tight spot, Jan.

1384
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:49,181
I'm not sure
it has all blown over.

1385
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:51,817
You're lucky you still got
a seat at this table.

1386
01:14:53,519 --> 01:14:55,054
Got it.

1387
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:01,560
I think we all know we're
gonna need a pension fund.

1388
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,963
I can't say I wasn't pleased
to have this meeting.

1389
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:05,731
I was startin' to itch.

1390
01:15:05,798 --> 01:15:07,399
But as we are aware,

1391
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,868
the bigger the reward,
the bigger the risk.

1392
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:11,737
Everything comes at a price.

1393
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:13,572
JACKSON:
Are you ready for that?

1394
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:16,475
'Cause there is no guarantee
of success on this one.

1395
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,946
None of this was ever really
guaranteed, was it, Sarge?

1396
01:15:22,881 --> 01:15:24,550
We've been through worse.

1397
01:15:24,717 --> 01:15:25,884
Yeah, so lay it on us.

1398
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:27,419
We're dyin' to find out.

1399
01:15:28,354 --> 01:15:30,389
We do this right,

1400
01:15:30,856 --> 01:15:32,825
we'll never
have to work again.

1401
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:34,360
Neither will our kids.

1402
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:35,828

1403
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:37,963
It's game over.

1404
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:42,434
So, what is it?

1405
01:15:44,738 --> 01:15:47,606
We're not hitting
a cash truck.

1406
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,341
We're hitting them all.

1407
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,777
How is that possible?

How much?

1411
01:16:01,153 --> 01:16:03,522
North of 150 million.

1412
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:05,324

1423

doesn't come through.

1424

Why does this room
always smell so good?

1425
01:17:01,347 --> 01:17:03,382
Maybe one day,
my garden can smell like this.

I hope you're not
plannin' anything, Dave.

DAVE: Well, it's Black Friday
tomorrow,

1428
01:17:07,986 --> 01:17:09,756
so you'll have
to wait and see.

1429

If I thought you were serious,

1430
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,424
