1
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:41,467
Help! Me house is on fire!
Me house is on fire!

2
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:48,057
Call the fire brigade!

3
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:58,401
Fill them up!

4
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:00,653
Pass the bucket!

5
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:03,948
There must be another way
of doing the credits!

6
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,449
That’s right!

7
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,036
Every time they make a Robin Hood
movie, they burn our village down.

8
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:24,009
Leave us alone, Mel Brooks!

9
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:31,183
Yo! Check it out
Prince John and the Sheriff

10
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,766
They was running the show

11
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:35,102
Raising the taxes
‘Cause they needed the dough

12
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,354
A reign of terror
Took over the land

13
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:40,691
They was shaking down the people
Just to beat the band

14
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,734
Hey!

15
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:43,777
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

16
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:47,698
-I said Hey!
-Hey nonny nonny and a ho ho ho

17
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:54,288
The people were unhappy
Morale was low

18
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:56,749
They had no place to turn to
There was nowhere to go

19
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,084
They needed a hero
But no one could be found

20
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:02,337
‘Cause Robin Hood was out of town
I said Hey!

21
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:03,588
Hey!

22
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,632
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

23
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,719
-I said Hey!
-Hey nonny nonny and a ho ho ho

24
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:15,934
He was put into the slammer
By his Arab foe

25
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:18,019
And in a little while
He would be no more

26
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,854
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

27
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,315
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

28
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:25,652
-I said Hey!
-Hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny

29
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:28,904
Hey nonny nonny and a ho ho ho

30
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,739
Check it out!

31
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:07,441
Hello! Hello!

32
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,569
Welcome! Welcome...

34
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:15,783

Please allow me to show you

37
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,917
Duck!

38
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,253
l always forget about that.

39
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:33,300
l’m so sorry, but we cannot seat you
without the proper attire. See?

40
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:37,971
lrving.

41
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:47,730
That’s much better. Now, l leave you
in the capable hands of Muktar.

42
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,607
He’s our head guard.

43
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,447
Please, it’s better you cooperate
with him. He’s a tough guy.

44
00:05:56,697 --> 00:06:01,035
And if there’s anything you require,
please don’t hesitate to scream.

45
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:03,120
Coming!

46
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,997
We’re so busy!

47
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,209
Follow me.

48
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,880
Please sit.

49
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,260
Robin of Loxley...

50
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,554
...where is your king?

51
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:23,389
King?

52
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,849
King?

53
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,895
And which king might that be?
King Richard? King Louis?

54
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:30,814
King Kong?

55
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:32,649
Larry King?

56
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:35,944
lmpertinent English dog.

57
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:37,237
You shall talk.

58
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,572
l don’t think so.

59
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:42,241
Churchim...

60
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:45,494
...please, the tongue looseners.

61
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,835
Speak, you dog.

62
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,503
Speak!

63
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:06,473
What did he say?

64
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:09,016
You don’t wanna know.

65
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:22,155
You very brave for not a homeboy.

66
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:23,823
Thank you.

67
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:28,411
l’ve been in this place for a while.
Perhaps l can be of service.

68
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,413
Do you have any questions?

69
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,373
What are you in for?

70
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,083
Jaywalking.

71
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:37,377
l see.

72
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:47,471
lt won’t be easy getting out of here.

73
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:50,765
What we need is a great
feat of strength.

74
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,101
Feat of strength?

75
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,520
Au contraire!

76
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,649
Now that you’re here with me, what we
have is great strength of feet!

77
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,861
Don’t follow.

78
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,362
Do as l do.

79
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:08,491
Put your feet on the bar.
Both feet.

80
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,744
Now, on the count of kick.

81
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:14,079
Kick!

82
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,126
What was that noise?

83
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,878
Noise? Noise?

84
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,383
The noise you heard was the breaking
of this poor man’s heart.

85
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,842
Yes, that’s it!

86
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:29,969
What?

87
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,473
He’s decided to save his own life
by betraying his king.

88
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:35,642
Oh, yes. That’s it.

89
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,894
Oh, damn my eyes!

90
00:08:38,228 --> 00:08:41,189
Go tell your superiors
before he changes his mind.

91
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,192
By the love of Allah!
This is a wonderful thing!

92
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,568
Go!

93
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:49,280
lt will mean a big promotion for me!

94
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,491
Go!

95
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,576
Good news is always rewarded!

96
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,286
Please go.

97
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,919
On the other hand...

98
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,924
...bad news is severely punished.

99
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,556
Now is our chance.

100
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,227
Quick, follow me!
You get that chain, l’ll get this one.

101
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,567
-I’m free!
-You’re free!

102
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,446
l’m going home!

103
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,171
Come on, take my hand!

104
00:09:56,553 --> 00:10:00,390
On the count of three!
One! Two! Three!

105
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,819
l just told them the good news,
and...

106
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,529
...and....

107
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,533
And l’m in deep shit.

108
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:39,970
lt is a very long journey
from Africa to England, my friend.

109
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,179
Well...

110
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:46,351
...l owe you a debt of gratitude.
l am called Robin of Loxley.

111
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:49,687
My name is Asneeze, father of Ahchoo.

112
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:50,980
Bless you.

113
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:55,193
Ahchoo is my son.
He’s in England, your country.

114
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:57,320
He’s an exchange student.

115
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,864
l’d like you to look after him.

116
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:04,994
He is in need of guidance.
He is headstrong and cocksure.

117
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,205
Or is it the other way around?

118
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,790
Say no more.

119
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,794
l vow on the sacred word of Loxley.
l give you my undying pledge...

120
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:18,215
...my solemn oath on my father’s honour,
on the blood of my heart...

121
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:22,803
-...on the word of my soul--
-Good, good, good!

122
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:26,431
You must go now,
or you will miss the tide.

123
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:31,103
Well, farewell, my friend,
and not to worry.

124
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:32,771
l’ll find Ahchoo.

125
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:34,814
Goodbye, my friend.

126
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:35,940
Farewell!

127
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:37,859
Safe journey!

128
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,018
Home!

129
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:14,978
Home!

130
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,481
England!

131
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:35,581
A horse!

132
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:38,709
A horse! My kingdom for a horse!

133
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:04,567
Ahchoo?

134
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:08,154
Bless you!

135
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:14,744
l hope someone’s getting
the video of this.

136
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,917
That must be him.

137
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,716
Watch my back!

138
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,389
Your back just got punched twice.

139
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,432
Thank you.

140
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:46,191
Hey, thanks, man.

141
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,608
You’re welcome.

142
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:50,319
Who are you anyway?

143
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,573
l think now is not the time
for introductions.

144
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,116
Time-out!

145
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:58,661
Excuse me, bad guys.
l am running out of air.

146
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,872
Gotta get pumped.

147
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:10,506
Okay, honkies. Time in!

148
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:11,924
By the bye...

149
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:15,719
...do you know praying mantis?

150
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,345
You’re looking at him.

151
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,990
Let’s get out of here!

152
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:39,910
Yeah, boy!

153
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,161
Right, go ahead! Punk!

154
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:43,662
They’re witches!

155
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,081
-They’re possessed!
-They’re crazy!

156
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,044
-Good work.
-Thanks, man.

157
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:57,551
You haven’t seen the last of us!

158
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,106
You’ve seen the last of us.

159
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:27,247
There she is, Loxley Hall.

160
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:29,624
Home of my family
for seven generations.

161
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,168
Let’s go!

162
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,962
Move it!
Come on, let’s go!

163
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,214
That’s a boy! Let’s go! Move it!

164
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,883
That’s it.
Keep it going!

165
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,844
Keep it going!

166
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:45,180
Come on, come on!
Move it, move it!

167
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,808
-Here we go.
-Stop the castle!

168
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:53,438
You, there! l demand to know
what is going on here!

169
00:15:54,022 --> 00:15:55,607
Read it and weep.

170
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,237
What up with that?

171
00:16:01,195 --> 00:16:02,530
" Hear ye, hear ye.

172
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:06,576
For failure to pay taxes,
all the lands and properties...

173
00:16:06,826 --> 00:16:09,328
...of the Loxley family
shall be taken.

174
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,999
Signed, Prince John’s Royal
Accountant, H.M.R. Blockhead. "

175
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:17,920
This is a sham! l vow l will restore
my castle to its rightful place.

176
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:20,506
You vow, we move!

177
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:24,510
Let’s go, boys! Take it out!

178
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,723
Come on!

179
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:31,349
Move it!

180
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:33,351
Keep it going!

181
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:35,395
Come on!

182
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:37,856
That’s a boy!

183
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:53,997
Blinkin?

184
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:55,623
Who’s that?

185
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:59,168
lt’s Blinkin,
our family’s loyal blind servant.

186
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,839
-l gotta get the horse, man.
-Good.

187
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:07,259
Be right out!

188
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,141
Blinkin!

189
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,936
Master Robin, is that you?

190
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,480
Back from the Crusades?

191
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:21,564
And alive?

192
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,652
Happy day!

193
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:31,157
l’m quite sure there was a door there.

194
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,368
Master Robin!

195
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,580
You lost your arms in battle!

196
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:40,041
Oh, how terrible!

197
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,252
But you grew some nice boobs!

198
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:44,712
Blinkin, l’m over here.

199
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:47,132
Later.

200
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,510
Listen to me.
They’ve taken the castle!

201
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:55,722
l thought it felt a bit drafty.

202
00:17:57,015 --> 00:18:00,686
This never would’ve happened
if your father was alive.

203
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:02,437
He’s dead?

204
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,022
Yes!

205
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:05,524
And my mother?

206
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:09,695
She died of pneumonia whilst--
Oh, you were away.

207
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,321
My brothers?

208
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,782
They were all killed by the plague.

209
00:18:14,991 --> 00:18:16,325
My dog, Pongo?

210
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,744
Run over by a carriage.

211
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:20,455
My goldfish, Goldie?

212
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:22,957
Eaten by the cat.

213
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,834
My cat?

214
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,211
Choked on the goldfish.

215
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:32,383
lt’s good to be home,
ain’t it, Master Robin?

216
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,554
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

217
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,639
What is that?

218
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,143
Your father wanted me
to give you this.

219
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:45,854
He said that inside is the key...

220
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:49,524
...to the greatest treasure
in all the land.

221
00:18:50,442 --> 00:18:51,943
May l keep it?

222
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:56,072
No, l think l ought
to honour my father’s wishes.

223
00:18:56,323 --> 00:18:57,866
Of course.

224
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,169
Come, Blinkin.

225
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,297
Let us leave this
depressing foundation.

226
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:16,884
We have much to do,
and less time to do it in.

227
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:21,972
Hey, Robin, wait up.

228
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,766
Oh. Well done.

229
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:26,018
He’s fast, but l caught his ass.

230
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:29,772
-Who’s that?
-Blinkin, l’d like you to meet Ahchoo.

231
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:31,690
A Jew? Here?

232
00:19:32,066 --> 00:19:34,568
No, no. Not a Jew. Ahchoo.

233
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,236
Hey, put it there.

234
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:37,654
How do you do?

235
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:39,447
l’ve been better.

236
00:19:39,697 --> 00:19:41,241
What’s that?

237
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,785
Help me! Help me!

238
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:45,703
Save me!

239
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:47,247
Save me!

240
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,962
Looks like a runaway white boy.

241
00:19:54,212 --> 00:19:56,923
All right, steady on.
What’s the matter?

242
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:58,550
They’re after me.

243
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,176
Who is?

244
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:18,026
Over that boy hand!

245
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:25,075
Hand over that boy.

246
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:26,910
Who demands it?

247
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:29,245
The Sheriff of Rottingham.

248
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:34,667
What has the boy done?

249
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:39,464
He was poaching in the king’s forest.
He deered to kill a king’s dare.

250
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:45,303
Dared to kill a king’s deer.

251
00:20:46,762 --> 00:20:48,347
And this is an offence?

252
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:52,351
One punishable by death.
Where have you been?

253
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:55,312
Fighting with King Richard
in the Crusades.

254
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:59,900
Unfortunately, my father couldn’t
get me into the National Guard.

255
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:06,239
How dare you talk to me in that fashion!
Who are you?

256
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,700
l am Robin of Loxley.

257
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,621
l’ve heard of you.
They say you’re handy with a sword.

258
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,706
Let’s find out!

259
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:24,965
What happened?

260
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,305
l was angry at you before, Loxley...

261
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:33,724
...but now l’m really pissed off!

262
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:34,934
Pissed off?

263
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:39,605
lf l was that close to a horse’s wiener,
l’d worry about getting pissed on.

264
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:44,151
This wasn’t a very smart thing
for you to have done.

265
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:46,028
l’ll pay for this!

266
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,407
You’ll pay for this!

267
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:52,951
Kill them!

268
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:58,748
Wait!

269
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:00,375
l’ve changed my mind.

270
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,961
Wise decision.

271
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:06,548
So until we meet again...

272
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:08,883
...have a safe journey.

273
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,305
Mind the big rocks!

274
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:21,645
Shut up, you bloody fools!

275
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:25,566
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

276
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:30,112
Thank you for saving me life, me lord.

277
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:33,323
l’ll tell every man that
there is one who is not afraid...

278
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,325
...to stand up to Rottingham.

279
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:40,664
Good. Tell them that. And tell them
l vow to put an end to the injustice.

280
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:43,374
Right the wrongs. End the tyranny.

281
00:22:43,624 --> 00:22:45,168
Restore the throne.

282
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:46,794
Protect the forest.

283
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:49,172
lntroduce folk dancing.

284
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,635
Demand a four-day workweek and health
care for Saxons and Normans.

285
00:22:54,886 --> 00:22:56,012
Yes, yes!
Good, good.

286
00:22:56,262 --> 00:23:00,558
lt’s getting dark, and l got
to go home alone now.

287
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,059
Right, right.

288
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:10,984
What an unusual child.

289
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,867
Where is the one

290
00:23:19,493 --> 00:23:23,622
That I love most of all?

291
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,417
When will I hear him call

292
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,879
Marian, Marian?

293
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:34,382
He is the one

294
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:37,384
Who can make my life whole

295
00:23:39,136 --> 00:23:42,932
Joyful forevermore

296
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:47,978
I’ve waited so patiently

297
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:51,440
For a true love

298
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:55,444
When will he come for me?

299
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:57,029
Where is he?

300
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,031
Where is he?

301
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,997
Where is the man

302
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:11,876
Who carries the key?

303
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:15,046
When will he be:::

304
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:19,884
::: with his Marian, Marian?

305
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,388
I cannot wait

306
00:24:23,638 --> 00:24:26,474
Till he sets my heart free

307
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:32,020
Oh, when will I know him?

308
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:36,066
When will I see him?

309
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:40,154
When will I hear him:::

310
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:44,783
:::say ‘Marian, my love’?

311
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,249
Hurry up, mein lady!

312
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:57,378
You better get out of that tub
before that thing begins to rust.

313
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,298
All right, Broomhilde.

314
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,720
Hurry! Hurry!

315
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:06,888
lt’s freezing!

316
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:15,813
Button up.
You’ll catch your death of cold.

317
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:19,066
These castles are so drafty.

318
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:24,821
Toasty warm.

319
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:30,076
Broomhilde, look!

320
00:25:30,285 --> 00:25:32,537
A happy little bluebird.

321
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:44,341
This means l must make a wish.

322
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,427
l hope against hope...

323
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,887
...l wish against wish...

324
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:53,974
...that the heavens bring me a kind,
wonderful, gentle man...

325
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:56,393
...who possesses the key to my...

326
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:00,606
...heart.

327
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:03,859
Goodbye, my little friend.

328
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:10,116
That happy little bluebird has left
a happy little doo-doo on your hand.

329
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:27,048
Prince John, l must speak with you!

330
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,844
All right, everybody.
Later, later.

331
00:26:32,303 --> 00:26:33,847
Later.

332
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:40,353
Sire...

333
00:26:41,563 --> 00:26:43,230
...l have news.

334
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,902
What sort of news? Not bad news.
You know l can’t take bad news.

335
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:53,365
The day began so good. l had a good
night’s sleep. l had a good b.m.

336
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:55,617
l don’t wanna hear any bad news.

337
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,495
Now what type of news is it?

338
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:00,831
To be perfectly frank, it’s bad.

339
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,417
l knew it!

340
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,170
l knew it was bad news!

341
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,966
Wait a minute, l have an idea.

342
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:16,846
Maybe if you tell me the bad news
in a good way, it won’t sound so bad.

343
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:20,725
The bad news in a good way?

344
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,477
Yes, yes, l can do that.

345
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,229
The bad news in a good way, yes.

346
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:26,522
Well, here goes.

347
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:33,988
Wait till you hear this.
l just saw Robin of Loxley.

348
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:36,198
He’s back from the Crusades.

349
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:41,536
You know, he just beat the crap
out of me and my men!

350
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:48,627
You know, he hates you
and he loves your brother, Richard.

351
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:58,637
And he wants to see you hanged!

352
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,893
We’re in a lot of trouble.

353
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,357
What are you, crazy?

354
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,569
Why are you laughing?
This is terrible news!

355
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,658
Well, l was just trying
to soften the blow.

356
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,369
Well, you blew it.

357
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,038
This is a knotty problem
not easily solved.

358
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,832
Yes, you’re right.

359
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,627
What to do? What to do?

360
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,796
What to do?

361
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,258
Got it! Latrine!

362
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,471
The weird creature in the tower.
The one who predicts my future.

363
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,014
Oh, yes, Latrine.

364
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,975
ls she ugly!

365
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,189
Latrine!

366
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,358
Latrine, where are you?
l must talk with you!

367
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,445
lt’s you.

368
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,698
There’s a new threat to my power.

369
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:05,492
What can you tell me
about Robin of Loxley?

370
00:29:05,742 --> 00:29:06,702
Robin of Loxley?

371
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,787
Robin of Loxley.

372
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:10,456
Let me see.

373
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:14,501
Raven’s egg.

374
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,129
Blood of a hen.

375
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:19,339
Little bit more blood, yes.

376
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:23,801
Eyeballs of a crocodile.

377
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,264
Testicles of a newt.

378
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:31,100
l guess he’s a transsexual now.

379
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,240
Robin of Loxley is handsome and brave.

380
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:49,576
He seeks to regain his family’s honour.

381
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,455
The little sod could be trouble.

382
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,415
-Are you certain?
-Certain?

383
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:58,710
You want certain, hire a witch.
l’m just your cook.

384
00:29:59,002 --> 00:29:59,878
Here.

385
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:01,505
Eat this.

386
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,800
lt’s fabulous.

387
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,928
Looks like a Seder
at Vincent Price’s house.

388
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:19,313
Such an unusual name, Latrine.
How did your family come by it?

389
00:30:19,563 --> 00:30:22,024
We changed it in the ninth century.

390
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:25,778
You mean you changed it to Latrine?

391
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:29,990
Yeah, it used to be Shithouse.

392
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,494
lt’s a good change.

393
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,330
lt’s a good change.

394
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:40,751
Now, what about this Robin fellow?

395
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,086
How can l stop him?

396
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:44,546
Maybe...

397
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:47,757
...l could devise a magic potion.

398
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:51,636
One that would make him unable
to perform the slightest task.

399
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:53,930
But in return...

400
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:56,015
...you must help me.

401
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:59,936
What are you, kidding?
Name it. Anything you want.

402
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:04,149
Put in a good word for me
with the Sheriff of Rottingham.

403
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:06,818
l’ve got the hots for him.

404
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:14,199
l keep a likeness of him
in my boudoir.

405
00:31:17,536 --> 00:31:18,495
Rotty.

406
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:21,206
Rotty, Rotty, Rotty.

407
00:31:21,665 --> 00:31:26,795
l’m amazed to think that a handsome
blade like the Sheriff of Rottingham...

408
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:29,590
...would ever want a creature
like you.

409
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:35,262
Well, if you’re going
to puncture my dreams...

410
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:38,055
...you can forget my promise
to help you!

411
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:39,307
No, wait!

412
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:42,602
Wait, wait, wait!

413
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:46,189
Maybe if we got him drunk.

414
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,779
Very drunk.

415
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,198
You got a shot.

416
00:32:01,454 --> 00:32:03,288
Oh, good.

417
00:32:20,222 --> 00:32:21,431
Dismount.

418
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,481
Wait here.
l’ll go make sure it’s safe.

419
00:32:47,748 --> 00:32:51,293
l say, would you mind awfully
getting out of the way?

420
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:55,005
l say, not until you pay the toll.

421
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:57,215
Toll? What toll?

422
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:01,136
Well, the toll you pay
for crossing me bridge.

423
00:33:01,386 --> 00:33:03,263
l’m not paying any toll.

424
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,473
This bridge is on my family’s land.

425
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:08,393
Well, it used to be my family’s land.

426
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,439
You’re Robin of Loxley!

427
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:17,861
And whom might you be?

428
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:20,071
They call me Little John.

429
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:22,240
But don’t let my name fool you.

430
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,615
ln real life...

431
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:25,534
...l’m very big.

432
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,871
l’ll take your word for it.
Now, let me pass.

433
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,042
Sorry.

434
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:35,753
But a toll is a toll...

435
00:33:36,003 --> 00:33:37,713
...and a roll is a roll.

436
00:33:37,963 --> 00:33:41,300
And if we don’t get no tolls,
then we don’t eat no rolls.

437
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,386
l made that up.

438
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:49,475
lt’s very fascinating, but l’m
afraid l’m going to have to hurt you.

439
00:33:50,183 --> 00:33:51,851
My pleasure. Will!

440
00:33:59,317 --> 00:34:00,234
Thank you.

441
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,071
Hey, Blinkin.

442
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,448
Did you say, ‘Abe Lincoln’?

443
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:08,743
No, l didn’t say, ‘Abe Lincoln.’
l said, ‘ Hey, Blinkin.’

444
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:10,828
Hold the reins, man.

445
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:13,331
Damn.

446
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,711
-Excuse me.
-No, excuse me.

447
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,880
You don’t have to do this.

448
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,090
Look...

449
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:26,343
...this ain’t exactly the Mississippi!

450
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,512
l’m on one side, see?

451
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,222
l’m on the other side.

452
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,932
l’m on the east bank.

453
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:33,892
l’m on the west bank.

454
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,686
lt is not that critical.

455
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:40,524
Not the point.
lt’s the principal of the thing.

456
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:46,112
Nice knowing you.

457
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,812
Help me!

458
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,439
l can’t swim!

459
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:10,068
l’m drowning!
Oh, God, l’m drowning!

460
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:14,197
Help me!

461
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:18,034
Help! Help me!

462
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:20,912
Help me! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

463
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:23,581
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

464
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:29,712
There, there. You’re all right now.

465
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,048
Thank you, Robin.

466
00:36:33,381 --> 00:36:35,133
You saved me life.

467
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:38,386
-What?
-Air!

468
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:40,514
Sorry.

469
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,974
There. l’m in your debit.

470
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,561
-Think nothing of it.
-Are you all right?

471
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:50,524
Let me introduce you to my friends.
That is Blinkin...

472
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,859
...and this is Ahchoo.

473
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,611
Bless you.

474
00:36:55,153 --> 00:36:57,405
That’s my name, man.

475
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:02,535
Let me introduce you
to my best friend.

476
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:03,744
Will Scarlet.

477
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:05,788
Scarlet’s my middle name.

478
00:37:06,038 --> 00:37:09,291
My full name is Will Scarlet O’Hara.

479
00:37:13,003 --> 00:37:14,630
We’re from Georgia.

480
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:16,674
He’s deadly with his daggers.

481
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:19,510
Really? How’s about a demonstration?

482
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,178
Gladly.

483
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:35,567
Fire an arrow...

484
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,694
...straight at my heart.

485
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:40,739
Are you serious?

486
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,574
Absolutely.

487
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:50,831
Goodbye.

488
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,843
What part of Georgia you from?
South Central?

489
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:14,104
l haven’t quite figured
that part out yet.

490
00:38:16,648 --> 00:38:17,899
l see.

491
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:21,986
l’m sorry about the toll thing, Robin.

492
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:23,780
lt’s Prince John.

493
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,451
He’s taken our homes and everything
we own. We’ve nothing left.

494
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,495
Not to worry, Little John.

495
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:34,665
l’m planning to make trouble for
Prince John and Rottingham.

496
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:37,043
Tonight, l’ll crash their party...

497
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:40,463
...to tell them l’ll fight to rid
England of their tyranny!

498
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:42,298
Good! We’ll join you!

499
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:43,840
Hear, hear!

500
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:48,845
l can’t risk the lives of others.
One can get in more easily than six.

501
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:52,682
l must be off.

502
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:55,602
Fare thee well.
l’ll see thee upon my return.

503
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,813
All right, man. Peace, bro.

504
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:59,398
Take it easy.

505
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,866
Man, white men can’t jump.

506
00:39:17,581 --> 00:39:19,834
-Here you are, son.
-Your ticket, sir.

507
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:58,496
Kill him!

508
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:01,833
No, wait!

509
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,001
You know, a mime...

510
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:06,795
...is a terrible thing to waste.

511
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,090
Let him go.

512
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:19,933
Good evening, lady.

513
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:21,560
Lovely!

514
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,526
Maid Marian...

515
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:32,153
...you know our good
Sheriff of Rottingham?

516
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:34,655
You look ravishing, my dear.

517
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,706
Please allow me to help you
to your seat.

518
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:55,968
l must say that Prince John has spared
no expense for tonight’s party.

519
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:00,555
We have exotic foods from across
the seas. Coconuts, bananas...

520
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:03,725
...and dates.
Would you care for a date?

521
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,853
-Yes, thank you.
-How about next Thursday?

522
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:14,403
Good evening.

523
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:17,114
That’s him! That’s him!

524
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:19,658
That’s Loxley!

525
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,425
Greetings, Your Highness.

526
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,011
Tref.

527
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:43,514
A present for you and your guests.

528
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:45,349
That’s a wild boar!

529
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:49,729
No, no. That’s a wild pig.
That’s a wild bore.

530
00:41:51,062 --> 00:41:51,896
Funny!

531
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:53,898
Very amusing!

532
00:41:55,942 --> 00:41:58,194
So you’re Robin of Loxley, huh?

533
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,992
l’ve heard so much about you.

534
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,119
And you are?

535
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,954
Maid Marian.

536
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:10,457
Maid Marian.

537
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:13,752
Rumours of your beauty have travelled
far and wide.

538
00:42:14,002 --> 00:42:16,629
Yet l see they hardly do you justice.

539
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:18,922
What a smoothie!

540
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:21,925
He’s definitely a smoothie.

541
00:42:23,802 --> 00:42:25,012
Enough!

542
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:28,015
King illegal forest...

543
00:42:28,265 --> 00:42:29,600
...to pig wild...

544
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,061
...kill in it a is--

545
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:34,104
What?

546
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:36,023
l mean, don’t you know?

547
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:40,527
lt is illegal to kill wild pig
in the king’s forest!

548
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:43,947
ls it not also illegal
to sit in the king’s throne...

549
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,032
...and usurp his power in his absence?

550
00:42:46,324 --> 00:42:48,576
Careful, Robin! You go too far.

551
00:42:48,826 --> 00:42:50,119
l’ve only just begun.

552
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:53,998
l’m warning you, if you don’t stop
levying these taxes...

553
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:56,751
...l’ll lead the people
in a revolt against you.

554
00:42:58,586 --> 00:43:01,464
And why should the people
listen to you?

555
00:43:01,672 --> 00:43:05,218
Because unlike some
other Robin Hoods...

556
00:43:05,468 --> 00:43:08,221
...l can speak with an English accent.

557
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:15,268
To tell you the truth, this guy’s
starting to get on my nerves!

558
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,187
Worry not, Your Highness.

559
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:21,233
l shall dispose of this
feathered upstart.

560
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:25,362
l challenge you to a duel.

561
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:37,249
l accept.

562
00:43:42,503 --> 00:43:45,214
That’s going to cost you, Loxley!

563
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,133
Please put it on my bill.

564
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:49,301
So it’s come down to this, has it?

565
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,011
A fight to the death...

566
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:53,723
...mano a mano...

567
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:55,015
...man to man...

568
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:58,894
...just you and me and my...

569
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:00,229
...guards!

570
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:10,947
Check please, table one.

571
00:44:43,854 --> 00:44:45,773
Hurry! Let’s get out of here!

572
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:21,265
-Refreshment, sir?
-Thank you, Blinkin.

573
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:25,769
Sounds like we’re winning, sir.

574
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:27,979
lndeed we are. Carry on.

575
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:36,863
Save me! Save me!
Hurt them! Hurt them!

576
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:40,117
Save them, save them!
Hurt you, hurt you! l’ve got it.

577
00:45:54,964 --> 00:45:56,799
Care for some dessert?

578
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,552
Archers ready!

579
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,304
Fire!

580
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:07,643
Maid Marian!

581
00:46:08,394 --> 00:46:11,647
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

582
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,735
Depends on what you’re looking at.

583
00:46:16,736 --> 00:46:17,737
Well?

584
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,621
To be continued.

585
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,378
Mein liebchen, l’m so glad
l found you.

586
00:46:35,628 --> 00:46:37,380
This party’s getting rough.

587
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,296
When l’m good, l’m good.

588
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,925
Don’t let them get away!
Surround the hall!

589
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,301
Now you’re talking!

590
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,245
l hope it’s worth the noise!

591
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:14,014
We got him! We got him!

592
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:19,770
Right rope.

593
00:48:45,128 --> 00:48:48,715
Look at this!
We went from royalty to recycling.

594
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:51,426
Would you get the door?

595
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:52,969
Yeah, l’ll try.

596
00:48:54,387 --> 00:48:58,724
lt’s been a wonderful party,
and we’d love to stay and all that...

597
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:02,352
...but l’m afraid we really must dash.
So ta-ta!

598
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,919
l sent word that each village should
send the very best men they have.

599
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:29,253
These are them.

600
00:49:35,134 --> 00:49:37,345
We’re in a lot of trouble.

601
00:49:39,722 --> 00:49:43,559
Good people, who have travelled from
villages near and far...

602
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,228
...lend me your ears.

603
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:52,776
That’s disgusting.

604
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:55,237
Hear me!

605
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,490
Men like Prince John and Rottingham
must be stopped!

606
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:03,662
Stopped from taxing us into poverty!
Stopped from taking what is ours!

607
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:09,126
lf we stand up to them all together
as one, we can win the day!

608
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:13,296
We shall go on to the end.
We shall not flag or fail.

609
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:15,716
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

610
00:50:15,966 --> 00:50:19,427
We shall defend our isle,
whatever the cost may be.

611
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:21,679
We shall never surrender.

612
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,390
Then they shall say of us:

613
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,520
‘ Never have so many
owed so much to so few.’

614
00:50:33,232 --> 00:50:35,860
That was beautiful. What’s going on?

615
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,194
They’re asleep.

616
00:50:39,905 --> 00:50:41,323
Hey, man.

617
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:43,200
Tough room.

618
00:50:44,076 --> 00:50:46,494
Why don’t you let me give it a try?

619
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,799
Look at yourselves.

620
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:02,719
Go on, take a look around.

621
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:07,515
People of Sherwood, you been had!

622
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:09,684
Hoodwinked!

623
00:51:10,185 --> 00:51:11,770
Bamboozled.

624
00:51:12,019 --> 00:51:13,270
Run amuck!

625
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:16,315
We didn’t land on Sherwood Forest.

626
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:19,193
Sherwood Forest landed on us!

627
00:51:21,362 --> 00:51:22,404
Very good.

628
00:51:22,821 --> 00:51:24,281
They’re all warmed up.

629
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:27,785
Brother Ahchoo is right.

630
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:30,037
And l say we fight back!

631
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:34,166
Are you with me?
Yea or nay?

632
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:37,002
Which one means yes?

633
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:38,836
Yea.

634
00:51:43,424 --> 00:51:47,303
Grab your uniforms and equipment
and prepare for the training sequence.

635
00:51:47,553 --> 00:51:51,265
All right, gentlemen,
grab your feathered caps, shotguns...

636
00:51:51,516 --> 00:51:53,267
...bodkins, boots...

637
00:51:53,518 --> 00:51:54,685
...swords...

638
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:55,853
...quivers...

639
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:58,272
...and pantyhose!

640
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:06,279
Now, men, the object of this exercise
is to hit the target.

641
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:46,027
Now, men...

642
00:52:46,277 --> 00:52:49,071
...keep your eye on Will,
and do exactly as he does.

643
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:00,206
Very good! Well done!

644
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:02,792
-All right!
-Right, Will!

645
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:04,294
That’s not hard.

646
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:07,172
-We could do that.
-Piece of cake.

647
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,092
Good boy.

648
00:53:12,093 --> 00:53:13,136
Ready, men?

649
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:16,681
Charge!

650
00:53:25,523 --> 00:53:26,607
Man!

651
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:31,236
Rob, man, maybe we should take
the dummies into battle.

652
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,542
l must speak with you.

653
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,922
What are you smelling?

654
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:53,716
These aren’t my bubbles.
They’re from the pipes.

655
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:57,553
Your Majesty, l have terrible news.

656
00:53:57,804 --> 00:54:00,473
Strucky has loxed again.

657
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:02,141
What?

658
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,852
Loxley has struck again.

659
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,398
l’m gonna need some privacy,
so you guys can blow.

660
00:54:10,483 --> 00:54:11,359
Not blow.

661
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:12,777
Blow!

662
00:54:19,866 --> 00:54:21,618
l’m so depressed.

663
00:54:21,868 --> 00:54:25,997
Come with me. l’ll show you something
that will make you very happy.

664
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,333
Fetch the royal robe!

665
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,085
Your Majesty...

666
00:54:30,794 --> 00:54:35,298
...stop me if l’m wrong about this,
but wasn’t your mole...

667
00:54:35,549 --> 00:54:37,050
...on the other side?

668
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:41,346
l have a mole?

669
00:54:42,139 --> 00:54:43,223
What is it?

670
00:54:43,473 --> 00:54:46,767
lt’s what we’ve named
a Stealth Catapult.

671
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:50,271
We’ve been working on it secretly
for months.

672
00:54:50,646 --> 00:54:54,608
lt can hurl one of these
heavy boulders undetected...

673
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:59,280
...over 1 00 yards, completely
destroying anything it hits.

674
00:54:59,989 --> 00:55:02,241
-How does it work?
-lt’s quite simple.

675
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:06,203
Take a heavy rock. Put it where
l’m sitting. Then pull that lever.

676
00:55:06,454 --> 00:55:07,955
You mean like this?

677
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:14,085
Oh, dear Lord...

678
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:18,423
...if you see fit to send me
my one true love--

679
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:23,511
Thank you!

680
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,100
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you’re here!

681
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:30,769
Let me work magic on you.

682
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:33,646
Kiss me! Kiss me! Touch me!

683
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,981
My back!

684
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,067
l’ve got a headache.

685
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:40,527
Where are you going? Oh, bugger!

686
00:55:42,696 --> 00:55:44,990
l was that close.

687
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:47,785
l touched it.

688
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:57,961
l don’t like the way you’re walking.

689
00:55:58,212 --> 00:56:01,048
You’ve been into
the sacramental wine again.

690
00:56:01,298 --> 00:56:03,008
You’re fahsnickered!

691
00:56:03,258 --> 00:56:05,761
You drunken mule, you.

692
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,475
Whoa, Morris! Whoa!

693
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:14,894
Halt there, friend.

694
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:19,023
You’ve just entered the territory
of Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

695
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:24,821
Feygeles?

696
00:56:27,699 --> 00:56:29,659
We’re straight, just merry.

697
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:34,788
And who might you be with
the long feather in your hat?

698
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:36,748
l am Robin of Loxley.

699
00:56:36,998 --> 00:56:38,250
Robin of Loxley?

700
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:42,504
l’ve just come from Maid Marian,
the lady whose heart you stole.

701
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:45,132
You prince of thieves, you.

702
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:51,179
l knew her parents before
they were taken in the plague...

703
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:53,473
...Lord and Lady Bagelle.

704
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:56,268
You and Maid Marian were meant
for each other.

705
00:56:56,518 --> 00:57:00,730
What a combination!
Loxley and Bagelle. Can’t miss.

706
00:57:02,106 --> 00:57:03,733
And who are you, sir?

707
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:05,985
l am Rabbi Tuckman...

708
00:57:06,235 --> 00:57:08,529
...purveyor of sacramental wine...

709
00:57:08,779 --> 00:57:11,032
...and mohel extraordinaire.

710
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:12,533
Hello, rabbi.

711
00:57:13,451 --> 00:57:15,244
Hello, boys.

712
00:57:15,494 --> 00:57:18,164
Mohel? l’ve never heard
of that profession.

713
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:22,918
Mohel, he’s a very important guy.
He makes circumcisions.

714
00:57:23,669 --> 00:57:26,421
What, pray tell, sir,
is a circumcision?

715
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:29,382
lt’s the latest rage.
The ladies love it.

716
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:30,508
l want one.

717
00:57:30,759 --> 00:57:32,677
-l’ll take two.
-l get one!

718
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,429
l’m game. How’s it done?

719
00:57:34,763 --> 00:57:36,014
lt’s a snap.

720
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:38,433
l take my little machine.

721
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:42,896
l take your little thing. See?

722
00:57:43,146 --> 00:57:46,649
l put it into this little
hole here...

723
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,109
...and nip the tip.

724
00:57:50,737 --> 00:57:51,821
Who’s first?

725
00:57:52,405 --> 00:57:53,822
l changed me mind.

726
00:57:54,031 --> 00:57:55,574
l forgot, l already got one.

727
00:57:55,824 --> 00:57:56,992
Question--

728
00:57:57,368 --> 00:57:59,536
l gotta work with a much
younger crowd.

729
00:58:00,162 --> 00:58:02,790
Rabbi, you seem to be
on the side of good.

730
00:58:02,998 --> 00:58:05,501
Will you join us
and share your wisdom...

731
00:58:05,751 --> 00:58:08,420
...your counsel and perhaps...

732
00:58:08,629 --> 00:58:10,297
...some of your wine?

733
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:13,842
Well, wisdom and counsel, that’s easy.

734
00:58:14,093 --> 00:58:15,719
But this is sacramental wine.

735
00:58:15,928 --> 00:58:18,806
lt’s only used to bless things.

736
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,769
Wait a minute!
There’s things here.

737
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:27,230
There’s trees, there’s rocks...

738
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,607
...there’s birds, there’s squirrels.

739
00:58:29,857 --> 00:58:33,486
Come on! We’ll bless them all
until we get fahsnickered!

740
00:58:33,695 --> 00:58:35,113
Join me!

741
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:39,242
Let’s hear it for the rabbi!

742
00:58:50,002 --> 00:58:52,004
Good evening, Don Giovanni.

743
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:00,887
lt was very good of you to come
at such short notice.

744
00:59:01,513 --> 00:59:03,390
And all the way from Jersey.

745
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,892
Well, it is quite a drive.

746
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:11,106
But you do realize that Prince John
commanded this to be a secret meeting?

747
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:14,233
l mean, who are these men?

748
00:59:14,525 --> 00:59:16,569
These are my trusted associates.

749
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,196
On my right, Dirty Ezio.

750
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,367
On my left...

751
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:25,619
...Filthy Luca.

752
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:28,080
Now...

753
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:33,336
...we thank you for inviting us
on the day of your daughter’s wedding.

754
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:38,215
l hope her first child
is a masculine child.

755
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:40,925
Shut up.
We didn’t have our meeting yet.

756
00:59:46,598 --> 00:59:47,766
All right...

757
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:51,603
...l understand you’ve been bothered
by this fruit, Robin Hood.

758
00:59:52,187 --> 00:59:54,689
And you want Robin rubbed out...

759
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:57,400
...eliminated, maybe even killed.

760
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,320
Yes, you put it succinctly.

761
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:01,946
Suck what?

762
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:06,409
-Succinctly. lt means ‘ perfectly.’
-Oh, yeah. l knew that.

763
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:12,039
Excuse me, Don Giovanni...

764
01:00:12,581 --> 01:00:14,750
...your lizard seems limp.

765
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:18,712
At my age, you know, sometimes....

766
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:20,381
Oh, my lizard!

767
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,426
He’s just sleeping, that’s all.
Charlie. Charlie!

768
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:28,514
l could have been somebody.

769
01:00:28,764 --> 01:00:33,559
l could have been a contender.
You know, Charlie’s got bad breath.

770
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:40,066
He got excited, you know. Come on.

771
01:00:45,279 --> 01:00:48,991
Normally, l would be so happy
to be of service to you...

772
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:52,453
...but there is something that weighs
heavily on my heart.

773
01:00:52,662 --> 01:00:56,249
ln the years that we’ve been friends,
England and Jersey...

774
01:00:56,499 --> 01:01:00,585
...never once have you invited me
to your home for coffee and cake.

775
01:01:00,836 --> 01:01:01,795
Or ganool.

776
01:01:02,004 --> 01:01:03,296
Something, you know?

777
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:05,298
-A g-what?
-A ganool.

778
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:08,885
lt’s a pastry with stuffing.
And it’s got sprinkles on it.

779
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:10,429
Excuse me.

780
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:13,098
l don’t understand a word
you’re saying.

781
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:16,935
l just got back from the dentist...

782
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:20,939
...and they left in the cotton.

783
01:01:21,898 --> 01:01:25,110
l will take these cotton balls
from you with my hand...

784
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,528
...and put them in my pocket.

785
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:33,200
Whatever.

786
01:01:34,368 --> 01:01:36,454
Your other associate says little.

787
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:38,372
-He says nothing.
-Why is that?

788
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:42,001
Because my enemy cut out his tongue.

789
01:01:42,251 --> 01:01:44,503
Good grief! Why?

790
01:01:44,754 --> 01:01:47,048
Because he went like this.

791
01:01:49,258 --> 01:01:51,719
And he didn’t like it,
so he cut out his tongue.

792
01:01:51,969 --> 01:01:54,596
Come over here. Go like this.

793
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,808
He can’t do it!

794
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:01,478
l love to tease him.

795
01:02:04,314 --> 01:02:06,691
-Tell me, Don Giovanni.
-That’s me. What?

796
01:02:06,941 --> 01:02:08,735
What will you do about Robin Hood?

797
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:10,695
Listen, l’ve got an idea.

798
01:02:10,945 --> 01:02:14,657
Tomorrow, you’re going to have
your medieval fun and games.

799
01:02:14,908 --> 01:02:17,911
The most important event will be
the archery contest.

800
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,371
Robin won’t be able to resist.

801
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:21,497
Why’s that?

802
01:02:21,997 --> 01:02:24,375
We’ll make him an offer
he can’t refuse.

803
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,585
l was just gonna say that.

804
01:02:28,587 --> 01:02:30,255
-That’s brilliant!
-Thank you.

805
01:02:30,506 --> 01:02:31,799
-But--
-What?

806
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:35,636
You do realize that Robin is
the finest archer in the land?

807
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:39,431
Don’t you understand?
Luca is good, better, best.

808
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,059
Show him your archery medals.

809
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:50,108
See? l couldn’t have said it
better myself.

810
01:02:50,358 --> 01:02:55,071
Now, Luca beats Robin
at the archery contest and then...

811
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:58,533
...Dirty Ezio makes Robin no more.

812
01:03:02,036 --> 01:03:03,413
‘ No more’?

813
01:03:03,621 --> 01:03:07,667
You want plain English?
Robin is gonna be dead.

814
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,669
D-E-D...

815
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:11,754
...dead.

816
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:16,466
Dead.

817
01:03:18,218 --> 01:03:19,636
You hear him there?

818
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:41,824
Broomhilde! Broomhilde, wake up!

819
01:03:42,074 --> 01:03:43,701
There’s a foul plot afoot.

820
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:46,829
lt’s not mein feet.
l just washed them!

821
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:52,001
Prince John and the Sheriff have hired
men to kill Robin. We must warn him!

822
01:03:52,209 --> 01:03:54,962
Wait, mein lady!
lf Prince John should see us....

823
01:03:55,212 --> 01:03:57,256
Right. We’ll go out the back.

824
01:03:57,506 --> 01:03:58,716
Right.

825
01:04:00,926 --> 01:04:02,720
Lady!

826
01:04:12,687 --> 01:04:15,273
Broomhilde, l’m going on ahead.
Catch me up!

827
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:17,025
Come on, lady.

828
01:04:19,527 --> 01:04:20,862
Farfelkugel!

829
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:51,892
Farfelkugel...

830
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:56,480
...if l was you,
l would never do that again!

831
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:59,149
Any questions?

832
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:03,194
Good.

833
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,842
What are you doing up there?

834
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:29,761
Guessing.

835
01:05:30,095 --> 01:05:31,471
l...

836
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:34,266
...guess no one’s coming.

837
01:05:37,477 --> 01:05:39,896
Please come down from there.

838
01:05:40,731 --> 01:05:41,898
Twit.

839
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:47,612
l guess there’s a ladder
around here somewhere.

840
01:05:48,363 --> 01:05:49,531
Here we are.

841
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:50,824
Right.

842
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,210
Oh, shit!

843
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:20,061
l can see!

844
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,195
l was wrong.

845
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,583
Blimey, these are hard to get on.

846
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,461
Let’s face it, you’ve got to be a man
to wear tights.

847
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,340
Will...

848
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,966
...how are me seams?

849
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,259
Perfect.

850
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,595
Every time.

851
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,265
We’re men

852
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:02,476
We’re men in tights

853
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,063
We roam around the forest
Looking for fights

854
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,940
We’re men

855
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,359
We’re men in tights

856
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,194
We rob from the rich
And give to the poor

857
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:13,612
That’s right!

858
01:07:14,028 --> 01:07:17,865
We may look like sissies

859
01:07:18,157 --> 01:07:21,494
But watch what you say
Or else we’ll put out your lights

860
01:07:22,036 --> 01:07:23,204
We’re men

861
01:07:23,454 --> 01:07:25,248
We’re men in tights

862
01:07:25,957 --> 01:07:29,127
Always on guard

863
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,181
We’re men
Manly men!

864
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:45,308
We’re men in tights
Yes!

865
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:48,729
We roam around the forest
Looking for fights

866
01:07:48,979 --> 01:07:49,938
We’re men

867
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:52,274
We’re men in tights

868
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,568
We rob from the rich
And give to the poor

869
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:55,944
That’s right!

870
01:07:56,528 --> 01:08:00,782
We may look like pansies

871
01:08:01,033 --> 01:08:02,993
But don’t get us wrong
Or else we’ll put out your lights

872
01:08:04,202 --> 01:08:05,912
We’re men

873
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:08,164
We’re men in tights

Always on guard
Defending the people’s rights

875
01:08:12,418 --> 01:08:15,212
When you’re in a fix
Just call for the men in tights

876
01:08:15,463 --> 01:08:16,881
We’re butch!

877
01:08:39,152 --> 01:08:39,986
Here.

878
01:08:40,445 --> 01:08:41,613
Allow me.

879
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:44,407
Thank you.

880
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,627
You’re so sweet.

881
01:08:56,002 --> 01:08:59,381
ls there anything l can do for you?

882
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,840
You can get off me.

883
01:09:06,095 --> 01:09:07,179
Little John!

884
01:09:07,763 --> 01:09:09,139
l panicked.

885
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,689
What are you doing here?

886
01:09:16,939 --> 01:09:21,235
Prince John and Rottingham have hired
murderers to kill you at the fair.

887
01:09:21,652 --> 01:09:23,195
You mustn’t go.

888
01:09:24,822 --> 01:09:26,907
Well, that’s easy. l won’t.

889
01:09:27,574 --> 01:09:29,617
l’m so happy.

890
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:34,205
They were going to lure you there
by having an archery contest.

891
01:09:34,455 --> 01:09:37,000
An archery contest?

892
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,210
Their archer is unbeatable.

893
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,586
Really?

894
01:09:40,837 --> 01:09:43,756
Robin, promise you won’t go.

895
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:45,925
All right, l promise you won’t go.

896
01:09:46,175 --> 01:09:47,427
Thank you.

897
01:09:49,345 --> 01:09:51,097
Hey, wait a minute. You said--

898
01:09:51,306 --> 01:09:53,599
-Cool it!
-Chilled.

899
01:09:55,267 --> 01:09:56,476
Come, my dear.

900
01:10:06,153 --> 01:10:09,197
The night is young,
and you’re so beautiful.

901
01:10:09,948 --> 01:10:11,241
B flat.

902
01:10:11,908 --> 01:10:14,453
The night is young

903
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:17,539
And you’re so beautiful

904
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:19,666
Here among:::

905
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:21,459
::: the shadows

906
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:23,794
Beautiful lady

907
01:10:26,797 --> 01:10:29,300
Open your heart

908
01:10:32,803 --> 01:10:35,014
The scene is set

909
01:10:35,389 --> 01:10:37,767
The breezes sing of it

910
01:10:38,017 --> 01:10:39,435
Can’t you get

911
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:42,647
Into the swing of it?

912
01:10:42,897 --> 01:10:44,857
Lady

913
01:10:46,484 --> 01:10:48,652
When do we start?

914
01:10:50,487 --> 01:10:53,907
When the lady is kissable

915
01:10:54,991 --> 01:10:57,202
And the evening is cool

916
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:02,666
Any dream is permissible

917
01:11:04,376 --> 01:11:07,379
In the heart of a fool

918
01:11:10,298 --> 01:11:12,342
The moon is high

919
01:11:12,592 --> 01:11:15,177
And you’re so glamourous

920
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:19,431
And if I seem over-amorous

921
01:11:19,682 --> 01:11:21,433
Lady

922
01:11:23,227 --> 01:11:25,354
What can I do?

923
01:11:28,983 --> 01:11:31,360
The night is young

924
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:35,364
And I’m in love

925
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:37,783
With:::

926
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:42,161
:::you!

927
01:12:06,811 --> 01:12:10,022
Oh, my dearest,
l’m ready for that kiss now.

928
01:12:10,272 --> 01:12:12,858
But first, l must warn you...

929
01:12:13,108 --> 01:12:15,110
...it could only be a kiss.

930
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,321
For l am a virgin...

931
01:12:17,571 --> 01:12:19,156
...and could never...

932
01:12:19,906 --> 01:12:21,575
...go all the way.

933
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,828
Unless, of course, l were married.

934
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,415
Or if a man pledged
his endless love...

935
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:30,542
...to me.

936
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:34,754
Or if l knew that he
desperately cared for me.

937
01:12:35,212 --> 01:12:37,506
Or if he were really cute.

938
01:12:40,009 --> 01:12:42,345
But my darling, you’re shivering.

939
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:46,015
Are you cold? What are you wearing
underneath that cape?

940
01:12:46,223 --> 01:12:47,933
Practically nothing.

941
01:12:52,813 --> 01:12:54,940
Oh, except that.

942
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:58,819
l forgot to tell you about
my chastity belt. lt’s an Everlast.

943
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:00,071
l’ll bet.

944
01:13:00,321 --> 01:13:01,613
Oh, darling...

945
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:03,615
...don’t despair...

946
01:13:03,865 --> 01:13:06,076
...for it is written on a scroll:

947
01:13:06,284 --> 01:13:09,037
‘One day, he who is destined
for me...

948
01:13:09,287 --> 01:13:11,790
...shall be endowed
with the magical key...

949
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,000
...that will bring an end to my...

950
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,794
...virginity.’

951
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:18,421
Oh, Marian...

952
01:13:18,713 --> 01:13:20,215
...if only t’were me.

953
01:13:20,465 --> 01:13:22,550
Oh, if it t’were you, t’would be...

954
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:24,594
...t’werrific.

955
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:30,057
No ding-ding without the wedding ring.

956
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:51,245
Goodbye, my dearest.

957
01:13:59,711 --> 01:14:00,962
Toodle-loo!

958
01:14:22,607 --> 01:14:25,402
-Time-out! Time-out!
-What is wrong?

959
01:14:25,652 --> 01:14:28,322
l should have never worn these shoes.

960
01:14:29,156 --> 01:14:31,408
They just don’t match my purse.

961
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:34,703
Blinkin, fix your boobs.

962
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:37,247
You look like a bleeding Picasso.

963
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,209
Goodness gracious!

964
01:14:43,754 --> 01:14:44,838
Peanuts!

965
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:48,674
Peanut power here!
Poor man’s lunch there!

966
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:49,884
Shell game here!

967
01:15:01,103 --> 01:15:03,898
The Royal Archery Contest
is about to begin!

968
01:15:05,107 --> 01:15:08,444
Archers, take your places!

969
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:16,368
Are we...

970
01:15:17,702 --> 01:15:19,204
...prepared?

971
01:15:19,829 --> 01:15:21,039
Sire.

972
01:15:40,892 --> 01:15:42,977
Oh, it’s good.

973
01:15:43,477 --> 01:15:45,020
lt’s good.

974
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,647
Archers...

975
01:15:46,897 --> 01:15:48,273
...to the line!

976
01:15:56,907 --> 01:15:58,283
Ready...

977
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:00,995
...aim...

978
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:04,373
...wait for it...

979
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:08,043
...fire!

980
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,510
The two archers that hit
the bull’s-eye can stay!

981
01:16:18,219 --> 01:16:19,804
The rest of you gentlemen...

982
01:16:20,054 --> 01:16:21,472
...can bugger off!

983
01:16:26,686 --> 01:16:27,854
There he is!

984
01:16:28,896 --> 01:16:31,274
The old man is Loxley!

985
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:36,528
Are you sure?

986
01:16:36,778 --> 01:16:38,780
lt looks like Mark Twain.

987
01:16:42,075 --> 01:16:44,870
The old man may go first!

988
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:57,883
Well done...

989
01:16:58,133 --> 01:16:59,468
...Robin of Loxley!

990
01:17:17,276 --> 01:17:20,112
He’s crazy! We gotta stop him!

991
01:17:22,365 --> 01:17:25,034
Sorry, ladies,
this is the royal entrance.

992
01:17:25,368 --> 01:17:27,578
You’ll have to go around
the other way.

993
01:17:29,663 --> 01:17:32,457
Look what you’ve done, you idiot!

994
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:35,377
Now he’s even more of a hero
to the people.

995
01:17:35,627 --> 01:17:37,796
Luca Pazzo still has a shot.

996
01:17:38,046 --> 01:17:41,383
But he hit the very centre
of the bull’s-eye!

997
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:43,051
Schmuck!

998
01:17:43,718 --> 01:17:46,137
Wait and watch, sire.

999
01:17:59,149 --> 01:18:02,653
He split Robin’s arrow in twain!

1000
01:18:05,406 --> 01:18:07,408
Things are looking up.

1001
01:18:12,997 --> 01:18:14,498
Nice shot!

1002
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:25,341
Robin’s in trouble! Shove off!

1003
01:18:27,427 --> 01:18:28,553
l lost.

1004
01:18:29,429 --> 01:18:30,638
l lost?

1005
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:34,684
l’m not supposed to lose.
Let me see the script.

1006
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:39,522
Robin, time to fly.

1007
01:18:39,772 --> 01:18:42,233
Go back to Sherwood Forest!

1008
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:45,278
Oh, good.
They’ve opened the salad bar.

1009
01:18:45,528 --> 01:18:46,446
Wait!

1010
01:18:46,696 --> 01:18:48,489
l get another shot!

1011
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,324
He gets another shot!

1012
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,036
Does Robin get another shot?

1013
01:19:01,001 --> 01:19:03,670
Yes, he does. He does.

1014
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:10,093
Sires and ladies, silence! Listen!

1015
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:11,678
Robin has another shot.

1016
01:19:15,057 --> 01:19:16,724
Let’s give him the chop.

1017
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:32,073
Quick! Eliminate him
before he shoots!

1018
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:46,711
How did you do that?

1019
01:19:46,962 --> 01:19:49,381
l heard that coming a mile away.

1020
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:53,218
-Very good, Blinkin. Well done.
-Pardon? Who’s talking?

1021
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:55,261
‘ Patriot arrow’?

1022
01:20:43,516 --> 01:20:44,350
Arrest him!

1023
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,229
Move it! Move it! Out of the way!

1024
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:52,817
Loxley is a traitor to the Crown!

1025
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:55,737
lt’ll be so much fun
to watch you hang!

1026
01:20:58,489 --> 01:20:59,490
Wait!

1027
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:02,743
What for?

1028
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:08,624
lf you let Robin live, l’ll do the
most disgusting thing l can think of.

1029
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:12,085
And what’s that?

1030
01:21:14,463 --> 01:21:16,340
l shall marry you.

1031
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:17,466
What?

1032
01:21:17,883 --> 01:21:21,470
You’ll be mine? You’ll give
yourself to me every night?

1033
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,306
And sometimes right after lunch?

1034
01:21:25,432 --> 01:21:26,350
Yes.

1035
01:21:26,558 --> 01:21:28,435
But only my body.

1036
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:33,147
You can never have my heart,
my mind, or my soul.

1037
01:21:34,357 --> 01:21:36,651
Oh, yes. l respect that.

1038
01:21:40,404 --> 01:21:43,532
Marian, my life’s not worth it!
Just say nay!

1039
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:48,704
Walk this way.

1040
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:04,094
Send word to one and all
and all and one--

1041
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,805
That’s redundant, isn’t it?

1042
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,807
-What?
-Shut up!

1043
01:22:09,182 --> 01:22:12,894
Tell everybody that before the day
is out, we shall have a wedding...

1044
01:22:13,144 --> 01:22:14,479
...or a hanging.

1045
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:17,023
Either way, we ought to
have a lot of fun.

1046
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:26,198
We are grossly outnumbered.

1047
01:22:26,407 --> 01:22:27,992
So what can we do?

1048
01:22:28,784 --> 01:22:30,452
We gotta get the villagers.

1049
01:22:30,953 --> 01:22:34,123
-They’re not ready to fight.
-Man, we are choiceless!

1050
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:37,001
What’s the fastest way
to reach the villagers?

1051
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:38,711
Why don’t we fox them?

1052
01:22:38,919 --> 01:22:39,920
-Fox them.
-Fox them.

1053
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,880
Fox them!

1054
01:22:54,142 --> 01:22:57,812
Take this message to the village
as fast as you can.

1055
01:22:58,062 --> 01:23:00,565
Now pay attention. Have you got it?

1056
01:23:00,773 --> 01:23:01,816
Good.

1057
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:13,453
Let’s get out of this ladies’
clothing, get into our tights.

1058
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,375
Come on, man. There you go.

1059
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,711
Are you about...

1060
01:23:23,003 --> 01:23:24,880
...a 1 6, 1 6-1 I2?

1061
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,102
-There.
-lt’s a little tight.

1062
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,647
That’s the idea!

1063
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:45,900
Would you care for a blindfold?

1064
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:48,653
How about half a one?

1065
01:23:49,695 --> 01:23:50,947
Get it, sir?

1066
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:05,252
Sorry.

1067
01:24:07,755 --> 01:24:09,048
Good morrow, abbot.

1068
01:24:09,298 --> 01:24:11,049
-Welcome, abbot.
-Good morrow.

1069
01:24:11,299 --> 01:24:12,884
-Hello, abbot.
-Good morrow.

1070
01:24:13,134 --> 01:24:14,469
Hey, Abbott!

1071
01:24:15,136 --> 01:24:17,263
l hate that guy.

1072
01:24:26,398 --> 01:24:28,275
She’s beautiful!

1073
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:33,238
Present swords!

1074
01:25:00,681 --> 01:25:02,349
What’s going on?

1075
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,768
Just in case you change
your mind, my dear.

1076
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:10,148
l will conduct the opening prayer
in the new Latin.

1077
01:25:12,692 --> 01:25:14,152
‘Oh, ordl-ay...

1078
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:17,989
...iveusg-ay oury-ay essingsbl-ay.

1079
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:21,576
Amen-ay.’

1080
01:25:29,375 --> 01:25:31,627
We are gathered here today...

1081
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:36,006
...to witness the marriage
of Mervyn, the Sheriff of--

1082
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:41,178
Mervyn?

1083
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,097
Your name is Mervyn?

1084
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:49,728
Shut up! Shut up!

1085
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,855
Continue with the service.

1086
01:26:06,702 --> 01:26:08,037
Do you...

1087
01:26:08,704 --> 01:26:10,790
...Sheriff of Rottingham...

1088
01:26:10,998 --> 01:26:13,960
...take Maid Marian
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1089
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,963
To love and to hold
in sickness and in health...

1090
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:20,758
-...till death do you part?
-Yes, l do. Get on with it!

1091
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:24,594
Marian, do you vow to do
all the stuff l just said to him?

1092
01:26:25,845 --> 01:26:27,180
Say, ‘ l do’ ...

1093
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:29,182
...or Robin dies.

1094
01:26:34,854 --> 01:26:36,273
l....

1095
01:26:37,274 --> 01:26:38,858
l...

1096
01:26:40,235 --> 01:26:41,236
...do...

1097
01:26:42,028 --> 01:26:43,446
...not!

1098
01:26:48,368 --> 01:26:50,911
-Who’s the man? Who’s the man?
-Go!

1099
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,955
Arrest them! Seize them!
Stop them!

1100
01:26:53,205 --> 01:26:55,541
Hurt them! Hurt them!

1101
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:58,002
Look! The villagers are coming!

1102
01:27:08,762 --> 01:27:10,848
l believe this belongs to you, sir.

1103
01:27:11,098 --> 01:27:12,516
You know what they say...

1104
01:27:12,725 --> 01:27:15,227
...’ No noose is good noose.’

1105
01:27:24,277 --> 01:27:25,486
Nice shooting.

1106
01:27:25,737 --> 01:27:28,990
To tell you the truth,
l was aiming for the hangman.

1107
01:27:31,868 --> 01:27:33,077
Fellas...

1108
01:27:33,328 --> 01:27:34,746
...we got company.

1109
01:27:34,996 --> 01:27:38,291
On the count of jump--!
Wait for it....

1110
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:40,293
Charge!

1111
01:27:40,668 --> 01:27:41,586
Jump!

1112
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:06,902
l shall have you, married or no!

1113
01:28:35,554 --> 01:28:38,265
The Sheriff,
he got your woman, man!

1114
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:42,310
He’s taking her to the tower!

1115
01:28:42,519 --> 01:28:44,688
He’s gonna deflower her in the tower!

1116
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:50,652
l’m sorry we don’t have enough time
for romance, my dear.

1117
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,866
Consider this foreplay!

1118
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,706
A chastity belt?

1119
01:29:03,664 --> 01:29:06,625
That’s going to chafe my willy.

1120
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,544
l’ll be back.

1121
01:29:08,794 --> 01:29:11,463
l hope she’s still wearing
her iron underwear.

1122
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:16,343
No matter what you do...

1123
01:29:16,552 --> 01:29:18,512
...l will never submit.

1124
01:29:31,858 --> 01:29:33,359
Prepare for the fight scene.

1125
01:29:35,445 --> 01:29:38,031
Forgive the interruption, my darling.

1126
01:29:38,781 --> 01:29:40,950
l’ll dispatch your love...

1127
01:29:41,367 --> 01:29:43,036
...and then come back...

1128
01:29:43,286 --> 01:29:45,038
...and finish the job.

1129
01:29:49,334 --> 01:29:51,377
-En garde!
-Thanks for the warning.

1130
01:29:56,507 --> 01:29:57,716
Shocking!

1131
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:06,767
Parry, parry.

1132
01:30:07,017 --> 01:30:08,560
Thrust, thrust.

1133
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:10,062
Good!

1134
01:30:50,475 --> 01:30:51,851
Oh, sorry.

1135
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:37,980
lt is the key to the greatest
treasure in all the land!

1136
01:31:38,897 --> 01:31:43,319
This means you’ve always been my one
true love because it’s the right size!

1137
01:31:44,110 --> 01:31:47,405
lt’s not the size that counts!
lt’s how you use it!

1138
01:31:59,542 --> 01:32:01,127
Thank you, my friend.

1139
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,935
Oh, it’s...

1140
01:32:18,185 --> 01:32:19,269
...not so bad.

1141
01:32:22,481 --> 01:32:24,191
l was wrong.

1142
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:33,742
Oh, my dear, beloved
Sheriff of Rottingham!

1143
01:32:33,992 --> 01:32:35,535
You’ve been run through!

1144
01:32:35,953 --> 01:32:37,954
How do you feel?

1145
01:32:38,663 --> 01:32:41,749
l’m dying, you fool!

1146
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:43,918
-You don’t have to die!
-l don’t?

1147
01:32:45,711 --> 01:32:48,172
l’ve got this magic pill...

1148
01:32:48,422 --> 01:32:51,175
...that could save your life.

1149
01:32:52,218 --> 01:32:54,428
And l’ll give it to you...

1150
01:32:54,679 --> 01:32:56,847
...if you promise to marry me...

1151
01:32:57,098 --> 01:32:59,642
...and be mine forever!

1152
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:05,730
Oh, all right!

1153
01:33:14,906 --> 01:33:15,991
How do you feel now?

1154
01:33:16,241 --> 01:33:17,659
Good, good.

1155
01:33:17,909 --> 01:33:19,244
Surprisingly good.

1156
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:21,496
And yet, somehow...

1157
01:33:22,539 --> 01:33:25,292
...incredibly depressed.

1158
01:33:37,761 --> 01:33:40,222
l always wanted to marry a cop.

1159
01:33:40,472 --> 01:33:42,516
Wait! Wait!

1160
01:33:42,766 --> 01:33:45,477
l’ve changed my mind!

1161
01:33:49,106 --> 01:33:51,900
l love you, Robin of Loxley.

1162
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:54,862
And l you, Marian of Bagelle.

1163
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,209
Oh, my darling...

1164
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:12,503
...at last.

1165
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,021
Wait, wait!
You’re not married yet!

1166
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:34,858
Before you do it,
you must go through it!

1167
01:34:35,984 --> 01:34:37,736
Or else l blew it.

1168
01:34:46,161 --> 01:34:46,995
Hey, rabbi!

1169
01:34:53,376 --> 01:34:54,669
Who calls?

1170
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:57,838
lt is l, Robin.
We wish to get married...

1171
01:34:58,089 --> 01:34:59,340
...in a hurry.

1172
01:34:59,715 --> 01:35:01,926
‘ Married in a hurry’?
That’s wonderful!

1173
01:35:02,176 --> 01:35:05,304
Wait, l’m on my last customer.
l’ll be right out.

1174
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,686
Put a little ice on it.
lt’ll be fine.

1175
01:35:14,897 --> 01:35:17,899
Married in a hurry!
Please invite me to the bris.

1176
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:19,901
Now, are you ready?

1177
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:21,152
Robin, do you?

1178
01:35:21,403 --> 01:35:22,404
l do.

1179
01:35:22,779 --> 01:35:24,656
-Marian, do you?
-l do.

1180
01:35:24,906 --> 01:35:27,617
l now pronounce you man and--

1181
01:35:27,826 --> 01:35:28,743
l object!

1182
01:35:30,203 --> 01:35:31,037
Who asked?

1183
01:35:31,705 --> 01:35:34,749
lt’s King Richard,
back from the Crusades!

1184
01:35:36,209 --> 01:35:38,587
Boy, now l’m in trouble.

1185
01:35:43,091 --> 01:35:45,759
You are no longer worthy to wear...

1186
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:48,679
...this sacred symbol of authority.

1187
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:52,433
Oh, please have mercy on me, brother.

1188
01:35:52,766 --> 01:35:53,892
lt wasn’t my fault.

1189
01:35:54,143 --> 01:35:56,353
l got bad advice from Rottingham.

1190
01:35:56,645 --> 01:35:58,147
Bullshit! Bullshit!

1191
01:35:58,981 --> 01:36:02,610
Brother, you have surrounded
your given name...

1192
01:36:02,818 --> 01:36:04,778
...with a foul stench!

1193
01:36:06,071 --> 01:36:07,615
From this day forth...

1194
01:36:07,865 --> 01:36:12,243
...all the toilets in this kingdom
shall be known as...

1195
01:36:12,952 --> 01:36:14,162
...’Johns.’

1196
01:36:17,206 --> 01:36:18,291
Take him away!

1197
01:36:18,541 --> 01:36:19,751
Wait! Wait!

1198
01:36:20,418 --> 01:36:22,587
Put him in the Tower of London!

1199
01:36:23,546 --> 01:36:26,132
Make him part of the tour.

1200
01:36:32,805 --> 01:36:37,310
The news of your great deeds
has reached me even in Jerusalem.

1201
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:42,230
England owes you and your men a great
debt of gratitude. Henceforth...

1202
01:36:42,439 --> 01:36:44,983
...your rights and lands
shall be returned...

1203
01:36:45,234 --> 01:36:49,279
...and you shall rule all Sherwood
from this day forth.

1204
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:54,743
Kneel, Robin of Loxley.

1205
01:36:58,789 --> 01:37:00,207
And arise...

1206
01:37:00,457 --> 01:37:03,502
...Sir Robin of Loxley.

1207
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:09,924
Thank you, sir.

1208
01:37:10,216 --> 01:37:11,467
Excuse me, king.

1209
01:37:11,717 --> 01:37:16,097
Why, if you like this guy so much, do
you object to his marriage to Marian?

1210
01:37:16,347 --> 01:37:19,392
l have no objections,
but l haven’t yet kissed the bride.

1211
01:37:19,642 --> 01:37:22,728
lt is a custom and my royal right.

1212
01:37:22,979 --> 01:37:24,230
Hold this, Father.

1213
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:26,440
-Rabbi.
-Whatever.

1214
01:37:36,491 --> 01:37:38,493
lt’s good to be the king.

1215
01:37:42,914 --> 01:37:44,624
Now you may marry them.

1216
01:37:44,874 --> 01:37:46,626
Thank you. Here’s your knife.

1217
01:37:46,876 --> 01:37:48,420
-Sword.
-Whatever.

1218
01:37:49,879 --> 01:37:53,133
Okay, where did we leave off?
Oh, that’s right.

1219
01:37:53,383 --> 01:37:55,844
We’re up to the best part.
Do you, Marian?

1220
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:57,220
l do.

1221
01:37:57,470 --> 01:37:59,763
-Do you, Robin?
-l do.

1222
01:38:00,389 --> 01:38:03,809
l now pronounce you man and...

1223
01:38:07,354 --> 01:38:08,480
...wife!

1224
01:38:16,071 --> 01:38:18,741
We’re going to have to
remodel the castle...

1225
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:21,869
...to make room for all the babies.

1226
01:38:27,624 --> 01:38:30,585
For my first order of business,
l wish to appoint...

1227
01:38:30,835 --> 01:38:32,795
...a new sheriff of Rottingham.

1228
01:38:33,046 --> 01:38:34,130
My friend...

1229
01:38:34,797 --> 01:38:36,049
...Ahchoo.

1230
01:38:36,257 --> 01:38:37,508
All right!

1231
01:38:38,259 --> 01:38:40,720
A black sheriff?

1232
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:42,639
He’s black?

1233
01:38:43,514 --> 01:38:45,058
And why not?

1234
01:38:45,308 --> 01:38:47,852
lt worked in Blazing Saddles:

1235
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:51,064
That’s good.

1236
01:39:05,702 --> 01:39:07,704
So that’s the story
And it worked out good

1237
01:39:07,955 --> 01:39:10,207
Richard’s on his throne
And Robin’s back in the ‘hood

1238
01:39:10,457 --> 01:39:14,878
So let’s bid our friends a fine adieu
And hope we meet again in Robin Hood 2

1239
01:39:29,225 --> 01:39:30,434
Rise...

1240
01:39:30,685 --> 01:39:33,771
...Sir Robin of Loxley.

1241
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:41,821
Hey, Abbott!

1242
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:44,698
l hate that guy!

1243
01:39:46,116 --> 01:39:49,786
Let’s see now.
What are you, 1 6, 1 6-1 I2?

1244
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:56,918
Feygeles?

1245
01:40:01,673 --> 01:40:02,882
Welcome home...

1246
01:40:03,133 --> 01:40:04,926
...Mrs. of Loxley.

1247
01:40:05,176 --> 01:40:06,803
Mrs. of Loxley.

1248
01:40:07,053 --> 01:40:09,264
Oh, l’m so happy!

1249
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:17,146
Oh, my dearest...

1250
01:40:17,521 --> 01:40:19,440
...shall l turn the key?

1251
01:40:19,690 --> 01:40:21,650
Oh, yes, darling!

1252
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:22,860
But please...

1253
01:40:25,112 --> 01:40:26,614
...be gentle.

1254
01:40:33,245 --> 01:40:34,788
Darling?

1255
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:35,998
What?

1256
01:40:36,206 --> 01:40:39,000
-You’re not going to believe this:
-What?

1257
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:41,711
-It won’t open:
-What?

1258
01:40:42,754 --> 01:40:44,964
