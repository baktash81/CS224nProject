1
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,258
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:59,017
But she had enchantment upon her of fearful sort,
which could be only broken by love's first kiss.

3
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:06,566
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible
fire breathing dragon.

4
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:13,656
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from
this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.

5
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:21,706
She waited in the dragons keep in the highest
room of the tallest tower for her true love

6
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,833
and true loves first kiss.

7
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,004
Like that's ever going to happen.

8
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,298
What a loony.

9
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,446
Shrek

10
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,498
Beware

11
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,238
Stay out

12
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,718
I think he's in here.

13
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,011
All right. Lets get it!

14
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,430
Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

15
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,017
Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.

16
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,854
Well actually that would be a giant.

17
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,733
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.

18
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,028
They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.

19
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,367
They'll chew your livers,
squeeze the jelly from your eyes.

20
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,369
Actually, it's quite good on toast.

21
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,870
Back beast, back!

22
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,914
I warned you!

23
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,378
Right.

24
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,605
This is the part, where you run away.

25
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,899
Yeah!

26
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,406
And stay out.

27
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,787
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.

28
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,838
Right, this one is full. Take it away.

29
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:03,803
Give me that.

30
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,515
Your fine days are over.
25 pieces of silver for the witch.

31
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,102
Next
.-Come on.

32
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,647
Sit down there! And be quiet!

33
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,402
This cage is so small.

34
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,946
You wouldn't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.

35
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,448
Please, give me another chance.

36
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,532
Oh, shut up!

37
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,534
Next.

38
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,243
What do we got?

39
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,995
This little wooden puppet.

40
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,082
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.

41
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,836
Five shillings for the possessed toy.
Take it away.

42
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,880
No! Please, don't let them do it!

43
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,131
Next.
-No!
 -What do you got?

44
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,301
Well, I've got a talking donkey!

45
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,844
Right.

46
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,722
Well that's good for ten schillings,
if you can prove it.

47
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,016
Oh, go ahead little fellow.

48
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,020
Well?

49
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,564
He's just a little nervous.

50
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,775
He's really quite a chatterbox.

51
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,735
You boneheaded donkey!

52
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,195
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,155
No, no, he talks, he does!

54
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,784
I can talk. I love to talk.

55
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,036
I've talked to...

56
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,416
Get her out of my site!
 -No, no, I swear!

57
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,342
Hey, I can fly.
-He can fly!
 -He can fly!

58
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,095
He can talk!
-That's right, fool!

59
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,346
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!

60
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,183
You might have seen how fly,
maybe even a superfly.

61
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,812
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!

62
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,028
Seize him!

63
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,419
Get him! This way! Hurry!

64
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,553
You there. Ogre.
-I.

65
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,972
By the order of lord Farquaad.

66
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,516
I am authorized to place you
both under arrest.

67
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:19,105
And transport you to designated
resettlement facility.

68
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,815
Oh really?

69
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,109
You and what army?

70
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,830
Can I say something to you?

71
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,668
Listen, you were really, really something,
back there. Incredible.

72
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,544
Are you talking to...

73
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
...me?

74
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,716
Yes, I was talking to you.

75
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,678
Can I just tell you that you were
really great back there with those guards.

76
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,012
They thought that was all of that.

77
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,766
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping
on over them selves like in the babes woods.

78
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,476
That made me really good to see that.

79
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,144
Oh, that's great. Really.

80
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,396
Man, it's good to be free.

81
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,274
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom
 with your own fiends?

82
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
But I...

83
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,196
I don't have any friends.

84
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,615
And I'm not going out there by myself.

85
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,575
Hey wait a minute. I have a great idea...

86
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,993
I'll stick with you.

87
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,745
You and mean green fighting machine.

88
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,997
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us.

89
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,338
Oh, a, that was really scary.

90
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,758
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work,
your breath will certainly do the job done.

91
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,510
You definitively need some tic-tac or something,

92
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,345
'cause your breath stinks!

93
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,015
Man you've...

94
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,766
Just like the time...

95
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,769
...and then I ate some rotten berries.

96
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,480
Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day.

97
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,774
Why are you following me?

98
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,235
I'll tell you why.

99
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,489
'Cause I'm all alone,

100
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,076
there is no one here, beside me.

101
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:02,375
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.

102
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,713
But you got to have...
 -Stop singing!

103
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,133
Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends.

104
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,636
Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest.

105
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,055
Listen! Little donkey.

106
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,724
Take a look at me! What am I?

107
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,685
A...

108
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:23,855
...really tall?

109
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,110
No! I'm an Ogre.
You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.

110
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,071
Doesn't that bother you?

111
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,823
Nope.

112
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,284
Really?
 -Really really.

113
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,994
Oh?

114
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,954
Man, I like you. What's your name?

115
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,707
A..., Shrek.

116
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,751
Shrek?!

117
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,586
But do you know, what I like about you, Shrek?

118
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,589
You've got that kind of:
"I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.

119
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,592
I like that, I respect that, Shrek. You're all right.

120
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,596
Uh, look at that.

121
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,391
Who would wanna live in
a place like that?

122
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,434
That would be my home.

123
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,773
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.

124
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,608
It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget.

125
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,404
I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder.

126
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,453
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?

127
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,163
I like my privacy.

128
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,000
You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common.

129
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,294
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.

130
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,463
And then there's that big occurred silence, you know?

131
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,636
Can I stay with you?
 -What?

132
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,472
Can I stay with you, please.

133
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,350
Of course
! -Really?

134
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,894
No.
-Please! I don't want to go back there.

135
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,354
You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak.

136
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,066
Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together!

137
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,193
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!

138
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,404
OK, OK.

139
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,781
-But one night only.
 -Huh, thank you!

140
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,533
A, what are you do... No!

141
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,494
This is going to be fun.
We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.

142
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,746
And in the morning...

143
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:03,747
I'm making waffles.

144
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,709
Where do I sleep?

145
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,085
Outside!

146
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,799
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...

147
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,052
... so I guess, outside is best for me.

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
Here I go.

149
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,225
Good night.

150
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,731
I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside.

151
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,859
Sit by myself outside, I guess.

152
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:41,076
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.

153
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,060
-I thought, I told you to stay outside.
-I am outside.

154
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,363
Well James. This is far from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

155
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,489
It's not...

156
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,493
What a lovely bed.
 -Got you!

157
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,123
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.

158
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,210
-Is that you Gordon?
 -How did you know?

159
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,672
Enough! What are you doing in my house?

160
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,803
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table!

161
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,056
Where would we supposed to put her.
The bed's taken.

162
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,436
What?

163
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:36,858
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs.
I'm a terrifying Ogre!

164
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,153
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?

165
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,160
Oh, no! No, no!

166
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,132
What are you doing in my swamp?

167
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,186
All right, get out of here. All of you.
Move it! Come on, let's go.

168
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,396
And hurry up, hurry up.

169
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,483
No, no, not there. Not there!

170
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,864
Hey don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

171
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,992
Oh gosh, no one invited us.
-What?

172
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,162
We were forced to come here.
-By who?

173
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,455
Lord Farquaad. He...

174
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:39,170
All right.

175
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:43,925
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?

176
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,886
Oh I do. I know where he is.

177
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,515
Does anyone else know where to find him?

178
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,478
-Anyone at all?
 -Me
. -Anyone?

179
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,523
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.

180
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,525
Ok, fine.

181
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,656
Attention all fairy tale things!

182
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,203
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially warned up.

183
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:19,627
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now
 and get all off my land and back where you came from.

184
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,806
You. You're coming with me.

185
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,392
All right. That's what I like to hear, man.

186
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:39,356
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a
world and big city adventure. I love it.

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,112
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek!
I'm on road again...

188
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,406
What did I say about singing?

189
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,532
-Can I whistle?
-No.

190
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,284
-Well, can I hummer?
 -All right.

191
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,776
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

192
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,168
Run, run, run as fast as you can,
you can't catch me.

193
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,337
I'm the gingerbread man.

194
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,714
You monster.

195
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,924
I'm not a monster here. You are.

196
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,387
You and the rest of that fairytale trash,
poisoning my perfect world.

197
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,181
-Now tell me! Where are the others?
-Eat me.

198
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,938
I've tried to be fair to you creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!

199
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,774
-Tell me! Or I'll...
-No, no, not the buttons.

200
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,943
Not gumdrop buttons.

201
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,194
All right! Who's hiding them?

202
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,905
Ok, I'll tell you.

203
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,826
-Do you know the muffin-man?
-The muffin-man?

204
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,371
-The muffin-man.
-Yes, I know the muffin-man.

205
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,497
Who lives on Proully lane?

206
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:24,085
-Well, she's married to the muffin-man.
-The muffin-man!

207
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,839
-The muffin-man!
-She's married to the muffin-man.

208
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,508
My lord! We found it.

209
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,094
Well then, what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

210
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,111
Magic mirror.

211
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,863
Don't tell him anything!

212
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,243
Evening.

213
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:03,583
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?

214
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,544
Well, technically, you're not a king.

215
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,046
A..., felonious.

216
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,841
-You were saying.
-What I mean is a...

217
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,842
...you're not a king, yet.

218
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:17,013
But you can become one.
All you have to do is marry a princess.

219
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,391
Go on.

220
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,603
So, just sit back and relax my lord,

221
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:28,191
because it's time for you
to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

222
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,194
And here they are.

223
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,616
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused
shading from a kingdom far, far away.

224
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,077
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.

225
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,455
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters.

226
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,417
Please welcome... Cinderella.

227
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,337
Bachelorette number two is a
 kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.

228
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,090
Although she lives with seven other man,
she is not easy.

229
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,927
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips
and find out what a live wife she is.

230
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,389
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.

231
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,891
And last but certainly not least.

232
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,102
Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing dragon,

233
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:08,606
brand new, guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava.
But don't let that cool you off.

234
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,485
She's a loaded pistol who likes
Pina Coladas and getting cut in the rain.

235
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,489
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.

236
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,785
So will it be bachelorette number one?
Bachelorette number two?

237
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,954
Or bachelorette number three?

238
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,791
-Two...
-Three!
-Two!

239
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,251
One. No, no, no.

240
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:31,046
Three. Pick number three my lord.

241
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,049
Ok, ok. Number three.

242
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:39,637
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen...
princess Fiona.

243
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:48,938
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.

244
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,441
All I have to do is just find someone...

245
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,277
But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night...

246
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,071
-I'll do it!
-Yes, but after sunset...

247
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:56,654
Silence!

248
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,991
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.

249
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:04,079
And Dulock will finally have the perfect king!

250
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,415
Captain! Assemble your finest man.

251
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,377
We're going to have a tournament!

252
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,007
That's it, that's, right there, that's Dulock.

253
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,550
I've told you I'll find it.

254
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,597
So. That must be lord Farquaads castle.

255
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:23,848
Aha, that's the place.

256
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,310
Do you think maybe he's comfit sating for something.

257
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,150
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!

258
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,199
-Hey, you!
-No, no!

259
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,201
Wait a second.

260
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,079
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...

261
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,114
It's quiet.

262
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,410
To quiet.

263
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,540
Where is everybody?

264
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,709
Hey look at this.

265
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,300
Wow!

266
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,053
-Let's do that again.
-No. no.

267
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,902
All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom.

268
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,028
Sorry about that.

269
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,616
That champion should have the honor, no, no...

270
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:55,750
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona
from the fireing keep of the dragon.

271
00:22:56,209 --> 00:23:03,216
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful,
the first runner up will take his place.

272
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,677
And so on, and so forth.

273
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:12,684
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

274
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,938
Applause.

275
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,607
Let the tournament begin.

276
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,698
What is that?

277
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,826
Ugh, it's idiotest.

278
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,078
Oh, that's not very nice.

279
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,789
It's just a donkey.

280
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,541
Indeed.

281
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:42,380
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre,
 will be named champion.

282
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,423
How about him.

283
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,426
Oh, hey. Now, come on.

284
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,099
Can't we just settle this over a paint?

285
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:55,977
No?

286
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,520
All right then.

287
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,398
Come on.

288
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,307
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!

289
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,363
Chair! Use the chair!

290
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,932
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

291
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:16,808
I'm here until Thursday. Try the bier!

292
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,359
Shall I give the order sir?

293
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,821
No. I have a better idea.

294
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:35,535
People of Dulock. I give you our champion!

295
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:36,786
What?

296
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,789
Congratulation, Ogre.

297
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:43,668
You've won the honor of embarking
 on a great and noble quest.

298
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,796
Quest? I'm already on a quest.

299
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,631
A quest to get my swamp back!

300
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,676
-Your swamp?
 -Yeah, my swamp!

301
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,221
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.

302
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,265
Indeed.

303
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,975
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.

304
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,271
Go on this quest for me and
 I'll give you your swamp back.

305
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,982
Exactly the way it was?

306
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,651
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.

307
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:13,698
-And the squatters?
-As good as gone.

308
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,869
What kind of quest?

309
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,579
Ok, let me get this straight!

310
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,626
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess
 just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp,

311
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,587
which you only don't have,
 'cause he filled it with freaks on the first place.

312
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,130
-Is that about right?
 -You know what?

313
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,883
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk.

314
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,470
I don't get it Shrek.
 Why didn't you just pull some Ogre stuff on them?

315
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,725
You know,just pull their hearts. Grab their bones to make you brave.
You know the whole Ogre trick.

316
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:46,898
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village
and put their heads on plate.

317
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:51,152
Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids.

318
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,320
Does that sound good to you?

319
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,740
A, no, not really, no.

320
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:59,619
For your information there is alto more to Ogres then people think.

321
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,081
-Example.
-Example?

322
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:06,710
OK, a, Ogres are like onions.

323
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,713
-They stink? -Yes, no.

324
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,297
-O, they make you cry.
-No.

325
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,342
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and gets brown hair?

326
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,761
No! Layers! Onions have layers.

327
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,433
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.

328
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,561
You get it? We both have layers.

329
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,441
O, you both have layers.

330
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,611
You know not everybody likes onions.

331
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:36,906
Cake! Everybody like cakes. Cakes have layers.

332
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:40,035
I don't care what everyone likes.

333
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,872
Ogres are not like cakes.

334
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,626
You know what everyone likes? Paffe.

335
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,962
Have you ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe"
and

336
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,798
they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious.

337
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,093
No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.

338
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,472
Ogres are like onions. End of story.

339
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,516
Bye, bye. See you lather.

340
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,566
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

341
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,361
You know I think I've preferred you humming

342
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,112
Do you have a tissue or something, 'cause I'm making a mess.

343
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,699
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying

344
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:02,200
Why, Shrek, did you do that?

345
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,452
Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off.

346
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,037
My mouth was opened and everything.

347
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,332
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.

348
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,086
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

349
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,381
Yeah, right, brimstone.

350
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:20,051
Don't be talking Mr. Brimstone. I know what I smell and what no brimstone.

351
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,303
And they don't come of stone neither.

352
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:43,241
Sure it's big enough, but look at the location.

353
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,207
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers?

354
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,502
Oh, yeah.

355
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,089
Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers.

356
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,550
have  sleeves.

357
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,260
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

358
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:06,264
-You know what I mean.
 -Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.

359
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:11,978
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge
 over boiling lake of lava!

360
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:15,231
Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok?

361
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:18,151
For emotional support.

362
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,989
We'll just hackle this together one little baby step after time.

363
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:24,699
-Really?
 -Really really.

364
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,660
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.

365
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,746
Just keep moving and don't look down.

366
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't look down, don't look down.

367
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:41,299
Shrek! I'm looking down!

368
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,010
I can't do this. Just let me go back, please.

369
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,013
-But you're already half way.
-Yeah, but I know that half is safe.

370
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,183
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

371
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,352
Shrek, no, wait.

372
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,607
Don't do that!

373
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,150
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

374
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,320
-Oh. This?
 -Yes, that!

375
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,449
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.

376
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,911
-No, Shrek!
 -I'm doing it.

377
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:16,459
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.

378
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,088
That will do Donkey that will do.

379
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,763
Cool.

380
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,182
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck animal?

381
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:34,644
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.

382
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,690
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.

383
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:58,209
-Are you afraid?
 -No, but shhhhh.

384
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:03,089
Oh, good. Me neither.

385
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:09,471
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here's a responsible situation.

386
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,642
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.

387
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:18,063
I'm sure he's meaner then a cow or anything, but they're scare.
 You know what I mean.

388
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:21,107
I'm sure he's heavier then a cow...

389
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:23,693
Donkey. Two things. Ok?

390
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,239
Shut, up.

391
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,742
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.

392
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,328
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.

393
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:38,625
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.

394
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,418
What makes you think she'll be there?

395
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,587
I read it in a book once.

396
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:46,257
Cool. You handle the dragon, I'll handle the stairs.

397
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,844
Oh, I'll find those stairs. I'll ???. That's right.

398
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:53,014
Those stairs won't know which way they go.

399
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,020
The drafting stairs...

400
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,190
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I master the stairs.

401
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,237
I wish I had a stair right here right now, I'd step all over it.

402
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,741
Well, at lest we know where the princess is.

403
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:13,451
-But where is the...
-Dragon!

404
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,220
Donkey, look out!

405
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,358
Got you.

406
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,815
Oh, what large teeth you have.

407
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:29,235
I mean, white sparking teeth.

408
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,822
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but

409
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,659
you must bleach yourself, because
that is one dashing smile you got there.

410
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,703
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?

411
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,581
And you know what else?

412
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:47,545
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,

413
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,883
'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out.

414
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:57,889
What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye?

415
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:01,184
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and

416
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,437
I don't know if we would worked out. You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.

417
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,731
Shrek!

418
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,902
No, Shrek! Shrek!

419
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,938
-Wake up!
 -What?

420
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,982
Are you princess Fiona?

421
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,526
I am.

422
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,695
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

423
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,239
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.

424
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,616
But wait, sir knight.

425
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,702
This be our first meeting.

426
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,913
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?

427
00:36:04,622 --> 00:36:06,666
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.

428
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,211
Hey, what are you doing?
You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.

429
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:15,383
Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed.

430
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,385
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

431
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,512
Aha.

432
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,933
But we have to sing through this moment.

433
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:26,728
You can residing of a poem to me.

434
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:30,565
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.

435
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:34,319
I don't think so.

436
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,863
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?

437
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,326
Shrek.

438
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,036
So, Shrek.

439
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,832
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.

440
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,961
Thanks.

441
00:36:55,548 --> 00:37:00,178
-You didn't slay the dragon?
 -It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!

442
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:01,179
But this isn't right.

443
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,894
That's what all the other knights did.

444
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:09,020
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.

445
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:12,190
That's not the point.

446
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,151
Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there.

447
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,779
Well, I have to save my ass.

448
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,490
What kind of knight are you?

449
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,617
One of a kind.

450
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,922
...rush into physical relationship.

451
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:40,051
I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a, magnitude.

452
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,930
That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude.

453
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,182
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.

454
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,518
Hey, what are you doing?

455
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:51,688
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little
and take this one step at the time.

456
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,190
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying.

457
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,526
As friends, maybe even as...

458
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,368
Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's my personal tail.

459
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,537
And you're going to tear it off....

460
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,919
Oh, no. No!

461
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,701
-It talks?!
-Yeah. It's getting to shut up ???

462
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,283
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.

463
00:39:28,326 --> 00:39:31,329
I'll take care of the dragon.

464
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,587
Ruuuuun!

465
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,220
You did it. You rescued me.

466
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,682
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a ...

467
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,021
...a little unconvencional to admit, but

468
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:42,233
by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt.

469
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:49,532
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.

470
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:53,828
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.

471
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,830
She thinks I'm a steed.

472
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:59,626
The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight.

473
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,296
-A, no.
 -Why not?

474
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,299
I have helmet hair.

475
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,426
Please. I wouldst look opponent face of my rescuer.

476
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,262
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.

477
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,265
But, how will you kiss me?

478
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,852
What? That wasn't in a job description.

479
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:22,190
-Maybe it's a perk?
 -No. It's destiny.

480
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,901
You must know how it goes.

481
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:30,782
A princess locked in a tower guarded by a dragon
 is rescued by a brave knight.

482
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,285
And then they share true loves first kiss.

483
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,331
With Shrek? You think, wait...

484
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:40,917
...you think Shrek is your true love?

485
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,462
Well, yes.

486
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,467
You think Shrek is your true love.

487
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:51,761
What is so funny?

488
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,972
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?

489
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,765
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

490
00:41:58,518 --> 00:41:59,519
Now remove your helmet.

491
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,772
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

492
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:05,066
-Just take off the helmet.
 -I'm not going to.

493
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,359
-Take it off!
 -No!

494
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,361
-Now!
 -Ok, easy.

495
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:13,366
As you command your highness.

496
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,838
You're an Ogre.

497
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,675
Oh, you ware expecting Prince Charming.

498
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,719
Well, yes actually.

499
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:38,850
No. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre.

500
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:44,689
Princess, I was sent to rescue by lord Farquaad, ok?

501
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,151
He's the one, who wants to marry you.

502
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:50,278
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?

503
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,740
Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there.

504
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:56,284
But I have to be rescued by my true love.

505
00:42:57,577 --> 00:42:59,579
Not by some Ogre and his pet.

506
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,415
Well so much for noble steed.

507
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:04,542
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.

508
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:08,171
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.

509
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,635
You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly,

510
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,054
I'll be waiting him right here.

511
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:18,598
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?

512
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:23,311
-I'm a delivery boy.
-You wouldn't dare.

513
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:26,606
-You coming donkey?
-Put me down!

514
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,316
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

515
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:31,486
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.

516
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:32,737
This is not dignified. Put me down.

517
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:41,621
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you,
 but you don't really like her.

518
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,624
That way. Now, how you let her down real easy,
 so her feelings aren't hurt?

519
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:47,752
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do that?

520
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:49,212
Just tell her, she's not your true love.

521
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:52,215
Everyone knows what happens when you...

522
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:56,594
Hey! The sooner we get to Dulock, the better.

523
00:43:58,471 --> 00:44:00,932
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful.

524
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:04,060
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like?

525
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,771
Well, let me put it this way, princess.

526
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:11,943
Men of Farquaads stature are in short supply.

527
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,989
Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.

528
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,786
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

529
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:27,542
You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up
 to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.

530
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:33,673
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do
 that measuring when you see him tomorrow

531
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,842
Tomorrow?

532
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:38,803
It will take that long?

533
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:42,932
-Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
 -No. That would take longer.

534
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:44,559
We can keep going.

535
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,561
But there are robbers in the woods.

536
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,731
Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good.

537
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:54,861
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier then anything
 we're gonna see in this forest.

538
00:44:54,986 --> 00:44:57,989
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!

539
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:06,289
Hey, over here.

540
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:10,543
Shrek, we can do better then that.
Now, I don't think this is decent for princess.

541
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:14,047
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

542
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:16,424
Homey touches? Like what?

543
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,054
A door.

544
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:23,139
Well, gentleman I..., good night.

545
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:25,850
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will...

546
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,769
I said good night!

547
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:33,900
Shrek! What are you doing?

548
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:36,569
I just..., you know...

549
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:38,196
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.

550
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,913
And that one, that's Throwback.

551
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:50,709
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

552
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,878
Right. Yeah.

553
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:57,507
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?

554
00:45:57,757 --> 00:45:59,759
Well, the stars don't tell future, Donkey.

555
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,053
They tell stories. Look.

556
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:04,973
There's Blodna, "The Flatulent" .

557
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:07,058
You can guess what is he famous for.

558
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:09,477
All right. Now I know you're making this up.

559
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:14,190
No. Look. There he is and there's a group
 of hunters running away from the smell.

560
00:46:15,233 --> 00:46:17,235
Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots.

561
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:21,698
You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear.

562
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,702
Forget it.

563
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,292
Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?

564
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:36,713
-Our swamp?
 -You know. When we're through rescuing
 the princess and all that stuff.

565
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:38,840
We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our.

566
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,969
There's just me and my swamp.

567
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:48,433
And the first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten foot wall around my land.

568
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,103
You hurt me deep Shrek, you hurt me real deep just now.

569
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,943
You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a was to keep somebody out.

570
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:01,237
No, you think?

571
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,699
-Are you hiding something?
 -Never mind Donkey.

572
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,036
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

573
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:12,332
No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.

574
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:15,752
-Why don't you want to talk about it?
 -Why do you want to talk about it?

575
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,588
-Oh, I do not.
 -I'm not talking.
 -Oh yes you are.

576
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,509
-Donkey, I'm warning you.
 -Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?

577
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:24,719
Everyone, ok?

578
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:28,431
-Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
 -Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

579
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:33,687
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against whole world anyway?

580
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:35,980
Look. I'm not the one with the problem. Ok?

581
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:39,067
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.

582
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,070
People take one look at me and go: A..... Help! Run!

583
00:47:43,321 --> 00:47:45,323
A big stupid ugly Ogre.

584
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:49,911
They judge me, before they even know me.

585
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,498
That's why I'm better of alone.

586
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:07,470
You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

587
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:11,349
Yeah, I know.

588
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:15,770
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?

589
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:19,983
Well, there's a Cabby. The small and annoying.

590
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:25,530
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there
. That one, over there?

591
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:27,657
That's the moon.

592
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:54,100
Again. Show me again.

593
00:48:57,937 --> 00:48:59,939
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.

594
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,991
Perfect.

595
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,642
Yeah. You know I like that. Oh come on baby...

596
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:21,980
-Donkey. Wake up.
-What?
-Wake up.

597
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:27,527
Morning. How do you like your eggs?

598
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:31,781
-Good morning princess.
 -What's all this about?

599
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,705
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday
and I wanted to make up to you.

600
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:42,417
I mean after all, you did rescue me.

601
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:47,213
Thanks.

602
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:49,549
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.

603
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:59,017
-Shrek!
 -What? It's a compliment.

604
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,811
Better out then in I always say.

605
00:51:02,687 --> 00:51:05,690
But that's no way to behave in front of a princess.

606
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:09,319
-Thanks.
 -She's as nasty as you are.

607
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:13,239
You know. You're not exactly what I've expected.

608
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:18,870
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

609
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:26,878
Princess!

610
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:29,756
What are you doing?

611
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:33,343
I am your saver. And I am rescuing you from this green...beast.

612
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,642
Hey! That's my princess. Go find your own.

613
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:44,187
Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

614
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,485
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are.

615
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:53,071
Oh, of course. How rude that was.

616
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:55,031
Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men!

617
00:52:44,956 --> 00:52:46,958
Man, that was annoying.

618
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,668
Oh, you little...

619
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,282
Shall we go?

620
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:22,160
All of us

621
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,289
Whoa, hold on, now. Where did that come from?

622
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,542
-What?
 -That. Back there. That was amazing.

623
00:53:31,419 --> 00:53:32,796
Where did you learn that?

624
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:38,885
Well, when one lives alone it has to learn
 these things in case there's a...

625
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:39,969
There is an arrow in your but.

626
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,472
What? Oh, would you look at that.

627
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:45,308
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

628
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:49,479
-What's wrong?
 -Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!

629
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,774
-Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
 -Donkey, I'm ok.

630
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:54,901
You can't do this to me Shrek. I'm too young for you to die.

631
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,987
Keep your legs moving. Turn your head up.

632
00:53:58,196 --> 00:54:00,198
-Does anyone know how to handle...
-Donkey! Calm down.

633
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:04,744
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.

634
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:08,915
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

635
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:11,960
Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

636
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,964
-Donkey!
 -Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

637
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:19,592
-What are the flowers for?
 -To get rid of Donkey.

638
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:22,762
Now, you hold still and I'll yank this thing out.

639
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,933
-Hey! Easy with the yanking.
 -I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

640
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:29,978
No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite...

641
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:35,608
-Don't move.
 -Ok, look. Time out.
-Would you... Ok.

642
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:40,071
What do you propose we do?

643
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:42,657
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

644
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,659
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind.

645
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:47,078
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

646
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:49,247
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!

647
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,210
Not good.

648
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,213
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.

649
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:04,304
Nothing happened.

650
00:55:04,387 --> 00:55:06,389
We were just a...

651
00:55:06,264 --> 00:55:09,100
Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok?

652
00:55:09,267 --> 00:55:11,269
Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind.

653
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:15,940
The princess here was just... Au!

654
00:55:21,863 --> 00:55:24,866
Hey, what's that? Is that...

655
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:58,126
There it is, princess.

656
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,546
-Your future awaits you.
 -That's Dulock?

657
00:57:01,546 --> 00:57:08,553
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is
conversating for something, which I think he has

658
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:11,639
I guess we better move on.

659
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:13,725
Sure, but Shrek...

660
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:18,146
-I'm worried about Donkey.
 -What?

661
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:20,982
I mean. Look at him. He doesn't look so well.

662
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:24,402
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.
-Well, that's what they always say.

663
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:28,406
And the next thing you know you're on your back.

664
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:31,534
-Dead!
 -You know she's right. You look awful.

665
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:35,330
-Do you want to sit down?
-You know, I'll make you some tee.

666
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,831
Right, I won't say nothing, but

667
00:57:36,831 --> 00:57:39,751
I've got this twinge in my neck. And if I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?

668
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:43,421
-He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
 -I'll get the firewood.

669
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:47,592
What, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs.

670
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:53,431
I think I need a hug.

671
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:03,441
This is good. This is really good.

672
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,362
-What is this?
 -Wheat rat.

673
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:10,573
-Rotatory style.
-No kidding.

674
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,912
-Oh, this is deliciousness.
-Well, they also great in stews.

675
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:20,667
Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean wheat rat stew.

676
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:28,299
I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night.

677
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:33,304
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.

678
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:36,057
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

679
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:41,396
Swamp soup, ... fisheyes ..., you name it.

680
00:58:43,231 --> 00:58:46,234
I'd like that.

681
00:58:56,536 --> 00:58:59,539
-A, princess?
 -Yes, Shrek?

682
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:05,128
I'm a.... I was wondering.

683
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:08,006
Are you... a...

684
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:14,137
Are you gonna eat that?

685
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:22,979
Man, isn't this romantic. Just look at that sunset.

686
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:26,274
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.

687
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:31,279
-What?
-Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.

688
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:34,157
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?

689
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:37,035
Yes, yes. That's it. I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside.

690
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:41,414
But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark to.

691
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:44,417
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

692
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:49,714
-Good night.
 -Good night.

693
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:57,430
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.

694
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,432
Oh, what are you talking about.

695
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,768
Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look, I'm an animal and I got instincts.

696
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:04,187
And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it.

697
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:08,274
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to lord Farquaad.

698
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:10,985
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones

699
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:13,196
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.

700
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:19,035
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.

701
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:22,455
I'm not saying that I do. 'Cause I don't.

702
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,667
She's a princess and I'm...

703
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:28,503
...an Ogre.

704
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,922
Yeah, an Ogre.

705
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:33,925
-Hey, where are you going?
 -To get more firewood.

706
01:00:54,904 --> 01:00:57,949
Princess. Princess Fiona?

707
01:01:03,913 --> 01:01:06,916
Princess, where are you?

708
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:13,548
Princess?

709
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:20,555
It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games.

710
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:33,151
-No, no
.-Help! Shrek! Shrek!

711
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,112
-No. -Shrek!
-It's ok. It's ok.

712
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:39,032
-What did you do with the princess?
 -Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.

713
01:01:39,282 --> 01:01:43,328
-It's me, in this body.
-Oh my god. You ate the princess.

714
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,413
-Can you hear me?
 -Donkey!

715
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:48,750
Listen, keep breathing. I'll get you out of there!

716
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,168
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

717
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,172
This is me.

718
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,720
Princess? What happened to you?

719
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:04,891
You're a... different.

720
01:02:06,726 --> 01:02:08,728
-I'm ugly, ok?
 -Yeah.

721
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:12,190
Was there something that you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.

722
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:17,278
-You are what you eat, I say.
 -No. I've been this was as long as I can remember.

723
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:20,907
What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before.

724
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:24,035
It only happens when the sun goes down.

725
01:02:26,162 --> 01:02:32,168
By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find your true loves first kiss.

726
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:36,756
Then, take loves true form

727
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:44,055
-Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
 -It's the spell.

728
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:48,810
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.

729
01:02:50,353 --> 01:02:53,356
Every night I become this. This horrible ugly beast.

730
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:03,366
I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me.

731
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:11,207
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sunset and he sees me. Don't you see?

732
01:03:14,377 --> 01:03:17,380
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.

733
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,802
Wait, you are ugly. But you only look like this at night.

734
01:03:23,803 --> 01:03:25,805
Shrek's ugly 24/7.

735
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:29,434
But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess in meant to look.

736
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:35,148
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?

737
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:39,402
I have to. Only my true loves kiss can brake the spell.

738
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:44,282
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.

739
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:47,994
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common.

740
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:49,788
Shrek?

741
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:54,125
Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.

742
01:03:58,421 --> 01:04:03,176
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty.

743
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:07,347
And, well, I don't really like it, but you may like it, because you're pretty.

744
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:11,434
But I like you anyway. A....

745
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,314
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.

746
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,785
Who could ever love a piece of hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together.

747
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:33,748
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live
 happily ever after is to marry my true love

748
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:41,756
Don't you see Donkey? That's just how it has to be.

749
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:45,593
It's the only way to break the spell.

750
01:04:46,344 --> 01:04:48,346
Well, at least you have to tell Shrek the truth.

751
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:51,349
No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know.

752
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:54,060
What's the point of ain't being able to talk? You got to keep secretes.

753
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:56,104
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

754
01:04:56,604 --> 01:04:58,648
All right, all right. I won't tell. But you should.

755
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:03,319
Before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.

756
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,364
Look at my eye twinkling.

757
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:32,974
Should I tell him? I tell him not.

758
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:37,395
I tell him. I tell him not.

759
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:40,440
I tell him!

760
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:44,277
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want to...

761
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:09,302
Shrek. Are you all right?

762
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:13,306
Perfect. Never been better.

763
01:06:13,264 --> 01:06:15,183
I... There's something I have to tell you.

764
01:06:16,726 --> 01:06:20,730
You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.

765
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:23,775
-You've heard what I said?
 -Every word.

766
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,902
I thought you'd understand?

767
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:32,158
Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!

768
01:06:32,325 --> 01:06:37,330
-I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
 -Yeah, well, it does.

769
01:06:38,331 --> 01:06:42,335
Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something.

770
01:06:49,342 --> 01:06:52,387
What I missed?  What I missed?

771
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:59,102
-Princess Fiona.
-As promised. Now hand it over.

772
01:07:01,062 --> 01:07:06,985
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp. Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.

773
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:10,196
Before I change my mind.

774
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:14,534
Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me.

775
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:18,204
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.

776
01:07:18,788 --> 01:07:22,792
-I am lord Farquaad
 -Lord Farquaad?

777
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:29,674
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for I was just saying short... farewell.

778
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:39,225
Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.

779
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:43,438
-It's not like it has feelings.
-No. You're right. It doesn't.

780
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,693
Princess Fiona,so beautiful

781
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:54,657
I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

782
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:04,584
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make...

783
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,713
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we'll...

784
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:12,467
No! I mean I... Why wait?

785
01:08:13,593 --> 01:08:16,596
Let's get married today. Before sunset.

786
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:21,559
Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better.

787
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:24,604
There's so much to do.

788
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:27,732
Yes, the cake, the gang, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests.

789
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:32,153
Farewell Ogre.

790
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:34,781
Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her to get away.

791
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:39,035
-Yeah, so what.
-Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.

792
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:42,872
-I talked to her last night. She's...
-Yeah I know you talked to her last night.

793
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:48,086
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home?

794
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:51,339
-Shrek. I want to go with you.
 -I told you, didn't I?

795
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:56,636
You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!

796
01:08:57,762 --> 01:09:02,767
Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

797
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:08,064
-But. I thought...
 -Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.

798
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:13,903
Shrek.

799
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:36,671
Donkey?

800
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:38,214
What are you doing?

801
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:41,384
I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

802
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:46,681
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it.

803
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:49,392
It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half.

804
01:11:49,559 --> 01:11:51,561
Oh, your half?

805
01:11:52,437 --> 01:11:55,440
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.

806
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:59,569
I did half the work. I get half the of the prize. Now hand me that big o rock, the one that looks li

807
01:12:00,862 --> 01:12:02,947
-Back off!
 -No. You back off!

808
01:12:03,531 --> 01:12:05,283
-This is my swamp.
 -Our swamp.

809
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:07,327
-Let go, Donkey!
-You let go!

810
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,120
-Stop it, jackass.
 -Smelly Ogre.

811
01:12:09,287 --> 01:12:11,289
Fine!

812
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:13,458
Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you, yet.

813
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:17,837
-Well, I'm through with you!
 -Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.

814
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,423
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!

815
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:23,885
So you just shut up and pay attention!

816
01:12:24,761 --> 01:12:27,764
You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything I do!

817
01:12:28,139 --> 01:12:30,141
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

818
01:12:30,558 --> 01:12:34,562
Oh, yeah? If I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

819
01:12:35,021 --> 01:12:38,024
Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other!

820
01:12:38,608 --> 01:12:44,614
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!

821
01:12:47,992 --> 01:12:50,995
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings.

822
01:12:51,621 --> 01:12:54,624
-Go away.
-See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona.

823
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,043
And all she ever did, is liked you. Maybe even love you.

824
01:12:57,502 --> 01:13:00,588
Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature.

825
01:13:01,965 --> 01:13:05,969
-I heard that you two were talking.
 -She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...

826
01:13:07,053 --> 01:13:09,055
...somebody else.

827
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:14,686
She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about?

828
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,232
No way, I'm not saying anything. You won't listen to me, right? Right?

829
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:21,401
-Donkey.
 -No!

830
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:24,988
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?

831
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:33,997
I'm sorry.

832
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,083
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.

833
01:13:39,377 --> 01:13:42,380
Can you forgive me?

834
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,842
-Hey, that's why friends are for, right?
-Right.

835
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:50,138
-Friends?
 -Friends.

836
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,849
So? What did Fiona said about me?

837
01:13:56,269 --> 01:13:59,105
Why are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her.

838
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,233
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!

839
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:04,944
Never fear! For where there is a will,  there is a way.

840
01:14:05,153 --> 01:14:07,238
And I have I way.

841
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,162
Donkey?

842
01:14:14,704 --> 01:14:19,626
-I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
 -Oh, come here, you.

843
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:23,254
All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.

844
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:25,423
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.

845
01:14:25,423 --> 01:14:28,426
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet.

846
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:06,506
People of Dulock. We're gathered here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king...

847
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:13,930
Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to "I do's"?

848
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:17,892
Go on.

849
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:28,403
If I'll need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

850
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,072
Shrek, wait, wait. You want to do it right, don't you?

851
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:34,659
-What are you talking about?
 -It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.

852
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:37,620
The priest is going to say: "Speak now or forever hold your peace".

853
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,623
And that's where you say: "I object".

854
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:44,085
-I don't have time for this.
-Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!

855
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:45,837
Look, you love this woman, don't you?

856
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:47,005
-Yes.
 -You want to hold her!

857
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:49,132
-Yes.
-Please her!
 -Yes!

858
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:52,552
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.

859
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:57,932
-Chicks like that romantic crap.
 -All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

860
01:15:57,724 --> 01:15:58,683
We got to check it out.

861
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:01,728
And as so by the power of these two...

862
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,564
What do you see?

863
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:07,609
-I now pronounce you...
-There they go!

864
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:14,157
-...he already said it.
 -Oh, for 'the love of pit'.

865
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:17,243
I object!

866
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:19,704
Shrek?

867
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:21,748
Oh, now what does he want?

868
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:28,129
Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you?

869
01:16:29,339 --> 01:16:31,132
I love Dulock, first of all. Very clean.

870
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:36,221
-What are you doing here?
-Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.

871
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:38,306
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...

872
01:16:38,223 --> 01:16:42,227
-Fiona! I need to talk to you.
-Oh, now you want to talk?

873
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:45,605
Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me.

874
01:16:45,605 --> 01:16:47,607
-But you can't merry him!
-And why not?

875
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:52,320
Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be a king.

876
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:55,615
-Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
-He's not your true love.

877
01:16:56,241 --> 01:17:00,245
-What do you know about true love?
 -Well,  I love...

878
01:17:01,913 --> 01:17:03,915
Oh, this is precious.

879
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:08,378
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.

880
01:17:10,213 --> 01:17:12,215
Laugh.

881
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,807
Shrek. Is this true?

882
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:32,944
Who cares. It's proposed my Fiona, my love we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!

883
01:17:36,364 --> 01:17:39,367
By night one way, by day another.

884
01:17:41,786 --> 01:17:42,704
I wanted to show you before.

885
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:10,273
Well. That explains a lot.

886
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:16,696
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight.

887
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:20,700
-Now! Get them! Get them, both!
 -No!

888
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:27,165
Marriage is minding  and that makes me no king. See? See?

889
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:30,001
-Shrek!
 -No.

890
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:33,129
-Don't just stand there, you dogs.
-Get out of my way.

891
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:44,557
No! Shrek!

892
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,477
-And as for you my wife.
-Fiona!

893
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:52,941
I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!

894
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:56,236
I will have order. I will have potential. I will have...

895
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:06,913
All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.

896
01:19:07,622 --> 01:19:10,625
I'm a donkey on the edge!

897
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:16,256
Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

898
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,927
Look at that Shrek.

899
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:24,556
-Fiona?
 -Yes, Shrek?

900
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:29,227
I love you.

901
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:33,815
Really?

902
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:36,568
Really, really.

903
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:40,238
I love you to.

904
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:51,291
A time of true loves first kiss...

905
01:20:28,286 --> 01:20:30,246
Fiona?

906
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:36,127
Fiona? Are you all right?

907
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:42,217
Yes. But I don't understand.

908
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:46,471
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

909
01:20:48,556 --> 01:20:51,476
But you are beautiful.

910
01:20:52,852 --> 01:20:55,855
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

911
01:21:43,528 --> 01:21:46,489
God bless us, everyone.
