1
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,270
Reynolds has made my
dreams come true.

2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,674
And I have given him what
he desires most in return.

3
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,875
And what's that?

4
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,634
Every piece of me.

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,436
He's a very demanding
man, isn't he?

6
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,037
Must be quite a challenge
to be with him.

7
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Yes.

8
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,397
Maybe he's the most demanding man.

9
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,475
Morning, ladies.

10
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,553
- Morning.
- Morning, madam.

11
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,555
Good morning, ladies.

12
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,551
- Morning, Biddy.
- Morning, Mr Woodcock.

13
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,232
- Morning, Nana.
- Morning, Mr Woodcock.

14
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,435
- Pippa.
- Morning, sir.

15
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,789
Try these.

16
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,634
Reynolds. They're delicious.

17
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,313
Remember I told you, Johanna...

18
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,754
No more stodgy things?

19
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,590
I didn't know that.

20
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,958
You may have told
it to someone else.

21
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,360
- Morning.
- Morning, my old so-and-so.

22
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,239
Where have you gone, Reynolds?

23
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,437
There's nothing I can say to get
your attention aimed back at me.

24
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,709
Is there?

25
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,395
I cannot begin my day with
a confrontation, please.

26
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,672
I'm delivering the dress today.

27
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,678
And I can't take up space
with a confrontation.

28
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,155
I simply don't have time
for confrontations.

29
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,113
Good morning, Countess.
Good morning, Cyril.

30
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,269
Good morning, Peter.

31
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,671
Who is this beautiful stranger?

32
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,029
I need to see you far
more often, Henrietta.

33
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,749
- I am very excited.
- I am, too. Come in.

34
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,389
Exquisite.

35
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,035
Yes?

36
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,634
Let's take it for a walk.

37
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,115
Beautiful work, ladies.

38
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,799
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

39
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,914
It's beautiful, Reynolds.

40
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,752
Worth everything
we've been through.

41
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,031
I feel like it will
give me courage.

42
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats, please.

43
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,390
- Evening, Stephen. Is she here?
- Yes, sir.

44
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,558
What do you want to
do about Johanna?

45
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,874
I mean, she's lovely,
but the time has come.

46
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,755
And she's getting fat,

47
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,798
sitting around waiting for you
to fall in love with her again.

48
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,879
I'll give her the October dress.

49
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,235
If that's all right.

50
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,757
I have an unsettled feeling,

51
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,995
based on

52
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,911
nothing I can put my finger on.

53
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
Just butterflies.

54
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,432
Been having the strongest
memories of Mama lately,

55
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,273
coming to me in my dreams,

56
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,480
smelling her scent.

57
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,958
The strongest sense that

58
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,190
she's near us.

59
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,799
Reaching out towards us.

60
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,032
I very much hope that she saw
the dress tonight. Don't you?

61
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,430
Yes.

62
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,996
It's comforting to think the dead
are watching over the living.

63
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,438
I don't find that spooky at all.

64
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,151
Why don't you go to
the country tonight?

65
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,395
I'll follow tomorrow.

66
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,835
Good idea.

67
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,993
I like that idea very much.

68
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,599
My old so-and-so.

69
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,075
Mr Hansford?

70
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,954
- Mr Hansford?
- Hello?

71
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,554
- Good morning.
- Morning.

72
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,073
- Fill it up, please.
- I will do.

73
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,430
Check the oil and the
tires. Lovely. Thank you.

74
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,794
It's a hard frost this morning.

75
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,791
It's cold, isn't it?
It's very bitter.

76
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,551
Excuse me. Could we have a
bit more toast, please?

77
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Yes.

78
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,553
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

79
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,478
- Good morning.
- Morning.

80
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,394
What would you like to order?

81
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,194
A Welsh rarebit...

82
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,157
With a poached egg on top, please.

83
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,955
Not too runny.

84
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
And bacon,

85
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,115
scones,

86
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,113
butter, cream,

87
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
jam,

88
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,795
not strawberry.

89
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
No.

90
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,795
Raspberry?

91
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,470
What else?

92
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,470
Coffee or tea?

93
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,755
Do you have Lapsang?

94
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,952
I'll have a pot of
Lapsang, please.

95
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,309
Good choice.

96
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,709
And some sausages.

97
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,760
And some sausages.

98
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,155
Show me.

99
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,629
Will you remember?

100
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,750
Yes.

101
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,790
I'm keeping this.

102
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
And now?

103
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,314
Will you have dinner with me?

104
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Yes.

105
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,074
For the hungry boy,

106
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,789
my name is Alma.

107
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,794
- Am I late?
- No.

108
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,275
What do you think?

109
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,189
I like the sauce.

110
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,675
Custard.

111
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
It's quite good.

112
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,034
May I, Alma?

113
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,313
I like to see who I'm talking to.

114
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,834
Here.

115
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,918
There you are. That's better.

116
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,039
Does your mother have brown eyes?

117
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,950
Green.

118
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,959
Do you look very much like her?

119
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,915
I don't know, I think so.

120
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,635
Do you have a photograph?

121
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Yes.

122
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,431
- Would you let me see it?
- Not here, at home.

123
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,789
Carry it with you.

124
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,593
Always carry her with you.

125
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,630
Where's yours?

126
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,595
Your mother.

127
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,594
She's here in the canvas.

128
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,472
What do you mean?

129
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,833
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

130
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,350
Secrets,

131
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,955
coins,

132
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,994
words, little messages.

133
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,078
When I was a boy, I
started to hide things

134
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,753
in the linings of the garments,

135
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,638
things that only I
knew were there.

136
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,513
And over my breast, I have a
lock of my mother's hair,

137
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,512
to keep her close to me always.

138
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,833
She was quite a remarkable woman.

139
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,149
She taught me my trade.

140
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,560
So I try to never be without her.

141
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,438
You must love her very much.

142
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,950
Hello.

143
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,957
This is Alma. Say hello to Alma.

144
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,480
Hello.

145
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,994
This is Alma. Come
say hello to Alma.

146
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,673
- Come on, come on.
- Hello.

147
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,552
Shall we show her the house, lads?

148
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,639
I made this dress for her
when I was 16 years old.

149
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It's beautiful.

150
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,669
'Twas for her second
husband, for the wedding.

151
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,596
My father had died
many years before.

152
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,314
Our nanny, the evil
Miss Blackwood...

153
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,237
Black Death, we used to call her.

154
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,832
Because of superstition, she
refused to help me sew the dress,

155
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,954
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune,

156
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,560
to never be a bride.

157
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,033
Not that anyone
would have had her.

158
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,378
And she seemed ancient to
us, I have no idea how

159
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,838
old she actually was,
and monstrously ugly.

160
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,395
So...

161
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,317
I worked alone for
months and months,

162
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
hunched over,

163
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,309
sewing and sweating and sewing.

164
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,197
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

165
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,157
All the help I could
have had from her.

166
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,197
'Twas my sister, Cyril, came
to my rescue in the end.

167
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,073
There are endless superstitions
when making a wedding dress.

168
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,559
Young girls afraid they'll
never marry if they touch one.

169
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,595
Or models afraid they'll
marry only bald men

170
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,159
if they put one on.

171
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,117
And where's the dress now?

172
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,237
I have no idea what
happened to it.

173
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,835
No idea.

174
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,237
Most probably turned
to ashes by now.

175
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,195
Fallen to pieces.

176
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,191
And your sister?

177
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,870
What?

178
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,834
Did she ever marry?

179
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,515
No.

180
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,473
C'mon, boys, let's have a fire.

181
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,273
If you want to have a staring
contest with me, you will lose.

182
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,159
You're a very handsome man.

183
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,916
You must be around
many beautiful women.

184
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Yes.

185
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,159
So, why are you not married?

186
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,155
I make dresses.

187
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,760
You cannot be married
when you make dresses?

188
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,470
I'm certain I was
never meant to marry.

189
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,792
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

190
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,275
I'm incurable.

191
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,919
Marriage would make me deceitful
and I don't ever want that.

192
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,998
You sound so sure about things.

193
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,159
I'm sure about that.

194
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,630
I think you're only acting strong.

195
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,469
No, I am strong.

196
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,709
For who? Not for me, I hope.

197
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,596
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others

198
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,114
that cause heartache.

199
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,959
Would you help me with something?

200
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,429
- Yes.
- Come on.

201
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,556
Good. Just jump up
on the box for me.

202
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,073
I think we're going to try and

203
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,720
pull this back for you.

204
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,990
Pretty good.

205
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,955
One moment.

206
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,033
We'll save that one
for another time.

207
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,795
Quite nice.

208
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
But...

209
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,550
Bit serious.

210
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,070
This one.

211
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,590
Do you like it?

212
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,513
- Yes.
- It's very good.

213
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
That's it.

214
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,078
Let's get that off you, and then

215
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,914
I'd like to take your
measurements. Is that all right?

216
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,351
And who's this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

217
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,034
Hello, I'm Alma.

218
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,270
I'm Cyril.

219
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,759
Sandalwood and rose water.

220
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,713
Sherry,

221
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,350
and...

222
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,432
Lemon juice?

223
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,234
We had fish for dinner.

224
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,429
My old so-and-so. Would you mind?

225
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,232
Can you step towards me? Ready?

226
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Thirty-two.

227
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
Thirty.

228
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Thirty-one.

229
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,953
Thirty-five and a half.

230
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,034
Fourteen and a half...

231
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,030
Seventeen...

232
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Twenty.

233
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,709
- Can you just stand normally?
- Yes.

234
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,591
- I stand normally.
- Like before.

235
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,549
- What do you mean?
- Straight.

236
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
- Straight.
- Like that.

237
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,989
Yeah, you didn't say that.

238
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
Sixteen and a half.

239
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,270
Eight and a half.

240
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,109
You have no breasts.

241
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,555
Twenty-two.

242
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,998
- Yes, I know.
- Thirty-two and a half.

243
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,309
You can drop your arm now.

244
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,639
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, you're perfect.

245
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,274
My job to give you some,

246
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,475
if I choose to.

247
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,595
Ten.

248
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Nine.

249
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,675
Six and a half.

250
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,235
Twenty-five.

251
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,920
And 45. That's it.

252
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,560
Would you try something
else for me?

253
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:24,561
Yes.

254
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,159
You have the ideal shape.

255
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,759
I do?

256
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,589
He likes a little belly.

257
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,997
I never really liked myself.

258
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,749
I thought my

259
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,112
shoulders were too wide,

260
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,953
my neck was skinny like a bird,

261
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,239
that I had no breasts.

262
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,512
I felt my hips were
larger than needed,

263
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,473
and my arms too strong.

264
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,678
I feel as if I've been looking
for you for a very long time.

265
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,070
You found me.

266
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,235
Whatever you do,

267
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
do it carefully.

268
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,391
But in his work, I become perfect.

269
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,715
And I feel just right.

270
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,393
Good evening, Mr Woodcock, sir.

271
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,154
Maybe that's how all women
feel in his clothes.

272
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,313
You look beautiful, really.

273
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,710
Very beautiful.

274
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,273
You're making me extremely hungry.

275
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,556
- Thank you.
- I ordered you a steak tartare.

276
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,995
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

277
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,195
My little carnivore.

278
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,150
I've just been on the telephone
to your favourite client.

279
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,591
Barbara Rose is getting
married again.

280
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,949
Oh, goody.

281
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,995
All right. Well...

282
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,229
Think I'd better have
another one of these.

283
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,755
That's your room.

284
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,069
I'm right next door.

285
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,310
Get your rest.

286
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,272
We'll start early in the morning.

287
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,035
How early?

288
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,875
I'll wake you.

289
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,915
Good night.

290
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,075
Good night.

291
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,755
Sometimes

292
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,398
we wake up at 4:00 in the morning,

293
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,111
after we've gone to
bed at midnight.

294
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,438
And then he's ready
to start again.

295
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,878
And I can stand endlessly.

296
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,037
No one can stand as long as I can.

297
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,029
What is it, Alma?

298
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,910
What are you looking
so forlorn about?

299
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,030
I don't know, I...

300
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,956
I think I don't like
the fabric so much.

301
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,430
Well, Alma, this fabric is adored

302
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,591
by the women who wear our design.

303
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,919
It's perfect for this dress.

304
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,149
Cyril is right.

305
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,639
Cyril is always right.

306
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,290
It's not because the
fabric is adored

307
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,194
by the clients that
Cyril is right.

308
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,193
It's right because it's right.

309
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,075
Because it's beautiful.

310
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,950
Maybe one day you'll
change your taste, Alma.

311
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Maybe not.

312
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,313
Maybe you have no taste.

313
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,393
Maybe I like my own taste.

314
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,877
Yes, just enough to
get you into trouble.

315
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,357
- Perhaps I'm looking for trouble.
- Stop.

316
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,275
You know, at the big races
and the Derby and, those...

317
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,676
- Yes?
- Excuse me, Mr Woodcock.

318
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,799
I would like to say
that I hope one

319
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,318
day I could wear one
of your dresses.

320
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,635
Oh, thank you.

321
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,677
If that's your wish, I hope
it comes true for you.

322
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
She really means it.

323
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,359
She told me she wants to be
buried in a dress that you make.

324
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:20,798
Thank you.

325
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,351
Thank you, ladies,
for your kind words.

326
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,475
Good night.

327
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

328
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,956
- Good night. Thank you very much.
- Good night.

329
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,040
You'd dig her up and sell the
dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?

330
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,589
Well, otherwise it would
seem to be going to a waste,

331
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,512
but, yeah, I mean,
one but can try.

332
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,876
Nigel, why aren't you
eating your profiteroles?

333
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
What?

334
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,960
Have you had enough to eat?

335
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,230
You seem thirsty.

336
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,355
Morning, Reynolds.

337
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,713
Morning, Cyril.

338
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,355
Please, don't move so much, Alma.

339
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,876
I'm buttering my toast,
I'm not moving too much.

340
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Well, it's too much.

341
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,429
It's a distraction,
it's very distracting.

342
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,474
Maybe you pay too
much attention to it.

343
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,319
It's hard to ignore.

344
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,596
It's as if you just rode
a horse across the room.

345
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,914
This is too much movement.

346
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,238
It is entirely too much
movement at breakfast.

347
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,270
Perhaps you should take
your breakfast after him.

348
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,474
Or in your room.

349
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,559
I think he's being too fussy.

350
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,830
His routine, when he's in
it, is best not shaken.

351
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,752
- Well...
- This is a quiet time,

352
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,794
not to be misused.

353
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,274
If breakfast isn't right,

354
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,273
it's very hard for him to recover
for the rest of the day.

355
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,909
I didn't know that.

356
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,634
No, of course you didn't.

357
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,955
But you do now.

358
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,393
Still I think he's too fussy.

359
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,709
Well, that's as may be.

360
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,749
This is Flemish bobbin
lace from the late 1600s.

361
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,070
It's very rare, very precious.

362
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,878
I rescued it from
Antwerp during the war.

363
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,310
I've been waiting for
the right moment to...

364
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,793
To make something with it.

365
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,155
Hold it.

366
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,896
That's very nice.
That's beautiful.

367
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:22,765
- That's good.
- Best yet. Beautiful.

368
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:24,638
Very nice. Turn towards the light.

369
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,870
Just look towards the
window, please, Alma.

370
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,755
Amber, could you just
lift the bodice,

371
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,869
a little bit?

372
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,280
It keeps dropping down.

373
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,633
We need to get that adjusted
properly. It's ridiculous.

374
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,156
- Just get it fixed.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,072
Should've been ready
today, quite honestly.

376
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,389
Keep your eye on that.

377
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,198
- Together.
- I'm not sitting on the floor.

378
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,429
Sit on the floor.

379
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,035
You're lovely.

380
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,800
Ah, it's great. That's great.

381
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,030
Okay, hold that while
I change the film.

382
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,509
Have I finished yet?

383
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
All right, that's it.

384
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,633
I need to do some work.

385
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,240
Hell.

386
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,035
Yes?

387
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,030
May I come in?

388
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I'm working.

389
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,479
Do you need anything?

390
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,760
It's fabulous on the shoulders.

391
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,955
Shoulder drapes, and then you
can put it on completely.

392
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,554
Okay?

393
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,229
Good, good, good.

394
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,239
Alma? Is she ready?

395
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Nearly.

396
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,273
Come on, please.

397
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,954
Ingrid.

398
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,800
Cape's wrong. Let me do it.

399
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,390
Let me do it.

400
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,709
Ellie, you ready? Let's
have a look at you.

401
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,234
Stand here, please.

402
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,034
All right.

403
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,190
Off you go. Thank you,
Pippa. Ingrid, you ready?

404
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,959
Let me do it, let
me do it. Damn it.

405
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,870
You're no good to me just
standing there, Pippa.

406
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,435
- I need your hands on this.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry. Yes.

407
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,637
Just go. Go, go.

408
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,834
I'm sorry.

409
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,279
Let me drive for you.

410
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,634
You see, when you...

411
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,474
When you love your work

412
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,073
and you can give like he does...

413
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,200
You need to come down

414
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,435
again.

415
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,115
And then he's...

416
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,309
He's a baby.

417
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,712
Like a spoiled little baby.

418
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,709
When he's like this,
he's very tender.

419
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,749
Open.

420
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,312
How long will these episodes last?

421
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,438
Only a few days, and
then he's well again.

422
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,118
- No. Alma, what are you doing?
- There's tea for you.

423
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,073
Don't put the tray on the table,
please. Just take it off.

424
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,039
I didn't ask for tea.

425
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,874
No, but...

426
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,919
Can you take it out, please?

427
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,474
Yes, I can take it out.

428
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,319
- It's a bit late now, isn't it?
- I'm taking it out.

429
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,357
Yeah, but it's a bit
late now, isn't it?

430
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,194
But I'm taking it out.

431
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,461
The tea is going out,
the interruption

432
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:56,194
is staying right here with me.

433
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,712
What if they are yellow
underneath and white on top?

434
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,951
The poison ones have gills.

435
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,959
Look at the book in the kitchen.

436
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,319
We cook them in fat?

437
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,873
No, we'll cook them in butter.

438
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,119
But not too much.

439
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,680
Mr Woodcock detests
too much butter.

440
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,311
There's a very good
chance Barbara Rose

441
00:48:36,312 --> 00:48:38,030
will ask you to
attend her wedding.

442
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,712
What do you want me
to do with that?

443
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,393
Accept her invitation.

444
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,440
If you can stomach it.

445
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,992
I really wish I hadn't heard
this till later on, Cyril.

446
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,914
It's very unsettling.

447
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,435
Well,

448
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,590
chin up.

449
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,957
Barbara Rose pays for this house.

450
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,835
All right?

451
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,271
Morning, Barbara.

452
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,076
Morning, Cal. Morning, Tippy.

453
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,350
Good morning, - Mr Woodcock.

454
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,474
Reynolds.

455
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,673
Let's get started.

456
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,119
Put it in there.

457
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,674
Thank you.

458
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,511
I'm just going to lift
this up, Barbara.

459
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,635
Oh.

460
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,877
I know you're doing
the best you can.

461
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,915
Don't do that.

462
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,356
- Take your hand away, please.
- I'm still so ugly.

463
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,870
Barbara, I'm trying to make
you a beautiful dress.

464
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,399
I need your help.

465
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,915
Please.

466
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,599
Reynolds, will you come?

467
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,519
Just stand still, please.

468
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,277
It's really not my place, Barbara.

469
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,553
This is what I do.

470
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,518
This is my place, here.

471
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,116
I'm afraid I must
insist that you come.

472
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,871
George Riley, News of the World.

473
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,767
Who'll be the attendant
at the wedding?

474
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:43,768
My son, Cal.

475
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,436
My Cal, my son.

476
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,918
He's so wonderful, he's so
in favour of this marriage.

477
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,400
John Evans, Daily Mail.

478
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,278
And what of your
holdings, Miss Rose?

479
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,109
Do they become Dominican property?

480
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,470
- I don't know, I don't think so.
- If I may say,

481
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,796
we are being married
under Dominican law,

482
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,838
but in my country, her
money belongs to her

483
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,678
and my money belongs to me.

484
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,593
Anyway, why would I need her
money? I have enough of my own.

485
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,036
What's Barbara brought
into your life?

486
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,080
I brought sincerity into his life.

487
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,911
- Sincerity?
- Then one kiss for the cameras.

488
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,718
Go on, give us a kiss for
the cameras, Miss Rose.

489
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,393
The answer to the question

490
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,318
- is sincerity.
- Let's give them a kiss...

491
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,153
Rubio, tell us about selling visas
to the Jews during the war.

492
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,639
Thank you.

493
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,074
Visas? Jews?

494
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,669
- Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- Thank you for that.

495
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,554
Jews, visas?

496
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,111
That dress doesn't belong here.

497
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,473
- Don't start crying.
- I'm not crying.

498
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,475
I'm angry.

499
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,322
Well, don't start
blubbering, Alma.

500
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:46,323
I'm not blubbering.

501
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,552
She doesn't deserve it.

502
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,558
It's your work.

503
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,789
Come on.

504
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,200
Tippy?

505
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,269
Mr Woodcock.

506
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,397
- What is it?
- I would like the dress back.

507
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,959
Miss Rose is sleeping.

508
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,620
Well, that's got nothing
to do with the dress.

509
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,000
Can you go and get
it for me, please?

510
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,958
She's sleeping.

511
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,314
In the dress?

512
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,754
Well, yes.

513
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,194
Go and take the dress off her
and bring it to me right away.

514
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:39,171
I don't think so.

515
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:40,954
Take the fucking dress off Barbara

516
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,792
and bring it to me or
I'll do it myself.

517
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,319
I beg your pardon?

518
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,914
Alma.

519
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,114
- Hello, Mr Woodcock.
- Cal.

520
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,680
I...

521
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,512
It's no business of ours

522
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,309
what Mrs Rose decides
to do with her life.

523
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,791
But she can no longer
behave like this

524
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,389
and be dressed by the
House of Woodcock.

525
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,319
Thank you.

526
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,149
I love you.

527
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,558
- Pedigree. That's for mother.
- Racy.

528
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,237
She'd like something
like that, but...

529
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,759
- Thank you, dear.
- It's Mona's day.

530
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,769
Yes, it is.

531
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,197
So I'd like to wear
something for her.

532
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,351
- Yes, of course.
- She mentioned that last time.

533
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,669
- Did she?
- Yeah.

534
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,194
- Did she really?
- Yeah.

535
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,475
All right.

536
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,434
- Julie.
- Yes, sir.

537
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,158
- Do we have porridge?
- Yes, we do.

538
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,473
- Do we have cream?
- We do, yes.

539
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,039
- Thick cream?
- Oh, yes.

540
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,031
That's what I'd like
for breakfast, please.

541
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,019
- All right, sir.
- Don't forget the salt this time.

542
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,020
I shan't, I shan't.

543
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:00,709
Oh, Alma, would you
like some porridge...

544
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,479
- Yes.
- This morning?

545
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,750
- Some for Alma as well, please.
- Right away.

546
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,134
And, bacon and eggs with that.

547
00:57:07,135 --> 00:57:08,191
All right, sir.

548
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,675
Morning.

549
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,309
I'm so hungry.

550
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,516
Delighted that we have
cream in the house.

551
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,836
- Yes.
- Makes all the difference.

552
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,752
It's essential with porridge.

553
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,912
A little bit naughty though.

554
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,550
- Dear Reynolds.
- Your Royal Highness.

555
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,398
- Hello.
- How beautiful you are.

556
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,270
- How nice to see you again.
- Your Royal Highness.

557
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,317
- Cyril.
- Your Highness.

558
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,477
- Hello.
- How lovely to see you.

559
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,039
Good morning.

560
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,314
When you dream about your wedding
dress, what is it that you dream?

561
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,233
I dream that it's the most
beautiful wedding dress

562
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,833
in the world.

563
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,194
Naturally.

564
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,671
Perhaps the only wedding
dress in the world.

565
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,115
Yes.

566
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,159
Or to take it just a
little step further,

567
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,076
perhaps the only wedding
dress that was ever made.

568
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,315
Oui.

569
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,592
Is Your Royal Highness a gold
person or a silver person?

570
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,558
- Silver.
- Good.

571
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,314
Lace or pearl?

572
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,709
Lace.

573
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,634
Very good.

574
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,790
Merci.

575
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,117
I want to wish you

576
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,431
good fortune for your wedding.

577
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,354
Thank you.

578
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,993
Je m'appelle Alma.

579
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,270
Lovely to meet you, Alma.

580
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,994
I live here.

581
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,474
Come in.

582
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,229
Alma.

583
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,319
Good morning, Cyril.

584
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,164
I wanted to ask
your help in a gift

585
01:00:10,165 --> 01:00:12,475
I wanted to make for Reynolds.

586
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,670
I want to make him a surprise.

587
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,518
If everyone left the house

588
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,840
when he takes his
walk on Thursday,

589
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,150
I will cook for him, dinner.

590
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,759
And when he comes back, no
one will be there but me.

591
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,837
I'll be waiting for him,

592
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,432
I will surprise him and we
can have dinner together,

593
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,919
just the two of us.

594
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,834
Do you like this idea?

595
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,510
Would you help me?

596
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,473
It isn't his birthday.

597
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,675
I know.

598
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,031
I would advise against this, Alma.

599
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:56,149
Why?

600
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:58,034
Because he doesn't like surprises.

601
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,071
- He does.
- Well, he won't like this one.

602
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,158
I'm trying to surprise him

603
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,791
and love him the way
that I want to.

604
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,517
Well, if you're looking
for something kind to do,

605
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,396
perhaps you could think
of something else.

606
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,190
No, I really must advise
against this, Alma.

607
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,208
I don't think there
could be a more

608
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:23,359
inappropriate time to
try something new.

609
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,999
This is what I want to do,

610
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,152
and I think it will be very nice.

611
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,713
I respect your advice, Cyril.

612
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,590
But I have to know
him in my own way,

613
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,511
and this is what I
want to do for him.

614
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,349
Good night.

615
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,790
- Good night.
- Good night, madame.

616
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,669
Good night, madame.

617
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,754
Good luck.

618
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,674
Oh, Alma. What is this?

619
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,039
I love you, Reynolds.

620
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,957
Yes, but what is this?

621
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,759
It's a surprise.

622
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,435
Are you hungry?

623
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,475
Where is Cyril?

624
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,673
I've sent everyone home.

625
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,079
Where is Cyril?

626
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,155
She's left.

627
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,714
What time did she leave?

628
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,149
This afternoon.

629
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,479
I've made us dinner.

630
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,599
Let me collect
myself for a moment.

631
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,718
I'll just have a bath, I think.

632
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,671
This is very kind of you, Alma.

633
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,396
Would you like a
champagne or a Martini?

634
01:03:45,397 --> 01:03:46,397
No, thank you.

635
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,193
Oh, is that your
dress? It's finished.

636
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,029
Let's have a look at it.

637
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,838
It's rather interesting.

638
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,560
Very good work.

639
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,832
I'll just have my bath now.

640
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,713
When will Cyril get back?

641
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,151
Tonight?

642
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,715
How was your appointment
with the princess?

643
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,792
She's very beautiful, like
a sculpture of some kind.

644
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,356
So will you make her
a wedding gown?

645
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,475
I have made her baptism,

646
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,276
her First Communion and
confirmation dresses.

647
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,395
I made the dress for her
presentation at court,

648
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,632
indeed the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

649
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,019
It's only right that
I should make her

650
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,795
wedding dress, wouldn't you think?

651
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,431
- Christ.
- No.

652
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,593
But this is not what
I wanted to say.

653
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,637
I'm sorry, I don't
know what I said, I...

654
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,910
This is meant to
be a nice evening.

655
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,999
Let me serve you.

656
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,399
Do you like it?

657
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,390
I do.

658
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,075
No, you don't.

659
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,079
You don't like it at all.

660
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,996
Usually, you always
tell me what you think.

661
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,394
What is this?

662
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,069
You're lying.

663
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,596
As I think you know, Alma,

664
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,991
I prefer my asparagus
with oil and salt.

665
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,715
And knowing this, you've prepared
the asparagus with butter.

666
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,594
Now, I can imagine in
certain circumstances

667
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,753
being able to pretend that
I like it made this way.

668
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,919
Right now, I'm just
admiring my own gallantry

669
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,151
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

670
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,993
I don't know what I'm doing here.

671
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,870
I don't know what I'm doing here.

672
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,918
I'm just waiting around
like an idiot for you.

673
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,714
This was an ambush,
Alma. To what purpose?

674
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,909
This is not...

675
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,471
I know it's not going
as I expected.

676
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,477
I didn't mean these
things to come out.

677
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,278
I'm sorry, but it was
meant to be nice.

678
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,634
Well, what did you expect?

679
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,957
I wanted time with you. I
wanted to have you to myself.

680
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,430
- You have me all the time.
- No.

681
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,053
What on earth are
you talking about?

682
01:07:54,054 --> 01:07:55,086
I don't.

683
01:07:55,087 --> 01:07:56,792
There are always people around.

684
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,560
And if not, then there's
something between us.

685
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,039
- Something between us?
- Yes.

686
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,589
- What?
- Some...

687
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,433
- What?
- Distance.

688
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,194
When did this happen?

689
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,755
What happened to make
you behave like this?

690
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,069
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

691
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,114
- Yes.
- I don't.

692
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,196
Well, that's very
predictable of you.

693
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,240
Don't act so tough.
I know you are not.

694
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:30,597
Yeah, that's right. That's
right. If I don't protect myself

695
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,478
somebody will come in
the middle of the night

696
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,278
and take over my
corner of the room

697
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,317
and ask me about their
fucking asparagus.

698
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,798
Don't be a bully.
You're being a bully.

699
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,259
There are other things I'd like
to do with my time. It's my time.

700
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,433
I have no idea what I'm
doing here in your time.

701
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:44,229
- My time.
- What am I doing here?

702
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,311
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you.

703
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,959
- Waiting for what?
- Waiting for you.

704
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,394
Waiting for what?

705
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,836
Waiting for you to get rid of me.

706
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,993
To tell me to leave.

707
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,873
So tell me.

708
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,356
So I don't stand around
like a fucking fool.

709
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,238
Asparagus, is this all
about your asparagus?

710
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,994
- No, it's not about asparagus.
- Then what the hell is it about?

711
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,440
Are you a special agent

712
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,239
sent here to ruin my evening
and possibly my entire life?

713
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,435
Why are you so rude to me?

714
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,854
Why are you talking
to me like this?

715
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:13,917
Is this my house?

716
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,758
- This is my house, isn't it?
- Yes, this is your house.

717
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,327
- Is this my house?
- Of course it's your house.

718
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,891
Or did somebody drop
me on foreign soil.

719
01:09:18,892 --> 01:09:20,835
- What a question.
- Behind enemy lines?

720
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,954
- It's you who brought me here.
- I'm surrounded on all sides.

721
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:24,358
It's you who brought me here.

722
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,919
When the hell did this
happen? Who are you?

723
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,314
Do you have a gun?

724
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,954
You here to kill me?

725
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,600
- Why are you...
- Do you have a gun?

726
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,159
- Stop it.
- Where's your gun?

727
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,594
- Stop being a child.
- Where's your gun?

728
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,717
- Stop playing.
- Show me your gun.

729
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,513
Stop playing this game.

730
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,034
- I am not.
- I'm not playing a game.

731
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,037
- Yes. Huh.
- What game am I playing?

732
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,790
What game? What precisely
is the nature of my game?

733
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,156
- You tell me.
- Oh, this whole...

734
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,679
- What?
- All your rules and your walls

735
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,558
and your doors and your people

736
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,032
and your money and all these
clothes and everything.

737
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,554
This, this, this game.

738
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,269
Everything here.
The whole... Pfft.

739
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,833
Nothing is normal or natural or...

740
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,877
Everything is a game.

741
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,550
"Yes, mister. No, madam. Yes."

742
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,714
Well...

743
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:17,755
if it's my...

744
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,006
"I don't eat this. I
don't drink that.

745
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,010
"I don't..."

746
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:21,863
If it's my life that
you're describing,

747
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,873
it's entirely up to you whether
you choose to share it or not.

748
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,473
If you don't wish
to share that life,

749
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,393
as apparently it's so disagreeable
to you in every respect,

750
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,199
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

751
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,709
Yeah.

752
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,637
Sometimes it's good for him to
slow down his steps a little.

753
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,230
Would you like me to
ask Alma to leave?

754
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,958
No. Why?

755
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,157
Well, if you're going
to make her a ghost,

756
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,039
go ahead and do it.

757
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,714
But, please, don't let her
sit around waiting for you.

758
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,199
I'm very fond of her.

759
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,790
Oh, you're very fond of her,
are you? In that case...

760
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,994
No, don't turn it on me. I don't
want your cloud on my head.

761
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,832
- Oh, shut up, Cyril.
- No, you can shut right up.

762
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,391
Don't pick a fight with me, you
certainly won't come out alive.

763
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,100
I'll go right through
you and it'll

764
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:19,439
be you who ends up on the floor.

765
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,874
Understood?

766
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,920
- Morning, Pippa.
- Morning, sir.

767
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,929
Pen, book and glasses?

768
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,878
Yes, they're all
there for you, sir.

769
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,074
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning, sir.

770
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,713
Excellent work, ladies.

771
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,757
It's just not very good, is it?

772
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,790
It's ugly.

773
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,272
You all right, sir?

774
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,154
Reynolds?

775
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,558
Reynolds, are you all right?

776
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,874
Mr Woodcock, he seems to be ill.

777
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,914
Who seems to be ill?

778
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,998
Mr Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress.

779
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,830
I'm sorry, Biddy.
Who's fallen over?

780
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,594
Mr Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress.

781
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,637
There's stains on the
front of the skirt

782
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,599
and there's a hole in
the lace on the bodice

783
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,360
and there's shoe polish on
the front of the dress.

784
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,798
Shoe polish from what?

785
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,874
From his shoe.

786
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,315
I'm fine.

787
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,597
Oh, I don't know what
the hell came over me.

788
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,873
Must be something I've eaten.

789
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,194
Oh, God.

790
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,880
- You should lie down now.
- No, I'll be fine in a minute.

791
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:35,190
Please lie down.

792
01:17:35,191 --> 01:17:37,079
No, really, don't
fuss, Alma, please.

793
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,434
Just don't fuss.

794
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,632
Whatever it is, if you
fuss, I'll die right here.

795
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:46,237
I promise I won't fuss.

796
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:53,558
Let me do that, please.

797
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,713
- I have to take these off.
- Yes, I'll take them off.

798
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,475
Alma? Alma?

799
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,954
Yes?

800
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,909
Would you tell them
I'll be down shortly?

801
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,599
Yes, of course.

802
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,599
Hello, Cyril.

803
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:29,875
Hello.

804
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,314
What is it?

805
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,155
I don't know what the
bloody hell came over me.

806
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,318
I'll be all right in a moment.

807
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,313
Oh, you don't look all right.

808
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,314
Where does it hurt?

809
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,874
Hurts all over.

810
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,957
I've never really felt
like this before.

811
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,632
Is it your stomach? Is it
something you've eaten?

812
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,280
No, I don't think so.
Just sore, really.

813
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,555
So please tell them I'll
be with them in a minute.

814
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:00,553
No, you're not going anywhere.
You're to stay here and rest.

815
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,553
Would you like me to do anything?

816
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,313
Just give me silence.

817
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,572
Shall I call the doctor?

818
01:20:09,573 --> 01:20:11,716
No, Cyril, you certainly
will not, please.

819
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,478
All right.

820
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,699
- Exhausted yourself.
- Just give me silence.

821
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,700
Burning up.

822
01:20:16,749 --> 01:20:18,350
You take care of the dress for me.

823
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,078
Yes, of course I will.
It's all right.

824
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,594
I just...

825
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,150
I just want...

826
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,434
That's it.

827
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,835
Come on, Alma.

828
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,959
I think I may be sick again.

829
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,919
We're gonna have to
do a lot of work

830
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,594
to get this dress ready
for tomorrow, you know.

831
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,633
We're gonna have to undo the front

832
01:21:01,634 --> 01:21:03,714
of the dress and
replace the skirt.

833
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,150
We're gonna have to cut a
new panel of the satin

834
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,038
and then there's also the
organza that needs to be...

835
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,839
Yes, I'll deal with that in
a minute, Biddy. Thank you.

836
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,073
You're soaked. We need
to change your pyjamas.

837
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,633
I'm scared, Alma.

838
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,399
Yes, of course you are.

839
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,991
Do you think I'll ever get better?

840
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,680
Of course.

841
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,319
I'll take care of you.

842
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,552
Madam, there's a telephone call.

843
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,551
He's settled now, sleeping.

844
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,634
- The doctor's here.
- What doctor?

845
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,279
The doctor I sent for.

846
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,190
- Oh, no, but he doesn't...
- He needs to be examined.

847
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,319
- No.
- Yes.

848
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,193
No, he's not dying.

849
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,918
He needs to be examined.

850
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,917
He's sleeping now.
That's what he needs.

851
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,354
Let me be unambiguous.

852
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,909
Come out of the room and
downstairs immediately.

853
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,155
All right.

854
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,753
Alma, this is Dr Hardy.

855
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,593
How do you do, Mrs Woodcock?

856
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,353
How do you do?

857
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,109
How's he feeling?

858
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,470
He's better. He's sleeping.

859
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,677
Is he able to keep
anything down yet?

860
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,599
He hasn't tried yet.

861
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,831
I was going to make some soup.

862
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,514
And his fever?

863
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,034
It has gone down.

864
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,752
Would you like me to see him?

865
01:23:51,753 --> 01:23:52,765
Yes.

866
01:23:52,766 --> 01:23:55,194
- Is that all right, Mrs Woodcock?
- Yes, it is.

867
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,754
Reynolds, Lady Baltimore has
sent her godson to see you.

868
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,359
Dr Hardy.

869
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,433
Hello, Mr Woodcock.

870
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,519
May I examine you?

871
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,199
Keep your hands off me.

872
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,787
I'd just like to take
your temperature.

873
01:24:27,788 --> 01:24:30,875
Alma, there's a strange boy in the
room. Can you get him out, please?

874
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,946
I admit I do look young, but I...

875
01:24:32,947 --> 01:24:33,995
Fuck off.

876
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,111
Reynolds, please, just
let him examine you.

877
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,838
Yes, fuck off.

878
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,880
I think this is clear.

879
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,633
He wants you to fuck off.

880
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,873
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

881
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,789
- I'm very sorry.
- Not to worry.

882
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,754
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

883
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,638
- 9:00 a.m?
- Yes.

884
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,109
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

885
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,639
Of course, Doctor.

886
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,553
- Good night, Mrs Woodcock.
- Good night, Doctor.

887
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,669
Follow me.

888
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,912
When will it be ready?

889
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,077
I don't know.

890
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,119
Let me put it another way.

891
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,114
This dress will be
ready by 9:00 a.m.

892
01:26:14,115 --> 01:26:16,234
because that's when it
leaves for Belgium.

893
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,500
Ladies, I'm very
sorry, but I'm afraid

894
01:26:26,501 --> 01:26:28,440
you'll have to work
late this evening.

895
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,415
The dress needs to
be ready by 9:00

896
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:34,391
a.m. to make its
journey to Belgium.

897
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,360
Do expect to be here
for quite some time.

898
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,677
If you need to use the telephone,
please use the one in my office...

899
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,592
- Nana and Biddy...
- to alert your families.

900
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,909
What can I do to help?

901
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,118
Could you pin the ribbon on the
hem there, please? Thank you.

902
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,736
Ladies, I'm very
sorry, but I'm afraid

903
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:51,272
you'll have to work
late this evening.

904
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,192
The dress needs to be
ready by 9:00 a.m.

905
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,272
and I know there's rather
a lot to do on it still.

906
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,399
So please do expect to be here
possibly for most of the night.

907
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,010
If you need to make
telephone calls,

908
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:05,230
do so from my office. Thank you.

909
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,111
Are you here?

910
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,871
Are you always here?

911
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,277
I miss you.

912
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,595
I think about you all the time.

913
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:08,550
I hear your voice say
my name when I dream.

914
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:14,079
Then when I wake up, there are
tears streaming down my face.

915
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,272
I just miss you, it's
as simple as that.

916
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,229
I want to tell you everything.

917
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,713
I don't understand
what you're saying.

918
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,791
I can't hear your voice.

919
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,438
Your fever's gone down.

920
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,311
I love you, Alma.

921
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,470
I don't ever want
to be without you.

922
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,678
I love you.

923
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,431
I have things I want to do.

924
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,200
I had thought my
days were unlimited.

925
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,231
The mistakes I've
made and made again,

926
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,231
they can no longer be ignored.

927
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:14,156
There are things nagging at me.
Things that now must be done.

928
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,715
Things I simply cannot
do without you.

929
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,158
To keep my

930
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,354
sour heart from choking.

931
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:40,197
To break a curse.

932
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,113
A house that doesn't
change is a dead house.

933
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,277
Alma, will you marry me?

934
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,752
Will you marry me?

935
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,069
What the bloody hell are
you thinking about?

936
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,198
Will you marry me?

937
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:41,834
No?

938
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,434
Yes.

939
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,433
Will you marry me?

940
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,874
Yes, I will.

941
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,982
Reynolds to Alma,
when you say these

942
01:35:03,983 --> 01:35:05,709
binding and contracting words,

943
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,438
you'll be looking at each other.

944
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,592
After all, it is each other
you are marrying and not me.

945
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,355
Reynolds... I call upon these
persons here present...

946
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,919
I call upon these
persons here present...

947
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:26,276
To witness that I, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock...

948
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,437
Do take thee, Alma Elson...

949
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,920
Do take thee, Alma Elson...

950
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,469
To be my lawful wedded wife...

951
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,759
To be my lawful wedded wife.

952
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,953
Alma... I call upon these
persons here present...

953
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,393
I call upon these
persons here present...

954
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:46,557
To witness that I, Alma Elson...

955
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,115
To witness that I, Alma Elson...

956
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,760
Do take thee, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock...

957
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,271
Do take thee, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock...

958
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,391
To be my lawful wedded husband.

959
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,836
To be my lawful wedded husband.

960
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,031
And it now gives me great
pleasure to say...

961
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,870
Congratulations. You are
now husband and wife.

962
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,157
And you may kiss the bride.

963
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,830
- An hour?
- An hour? That's okay.

964
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,439
Cuckoo.

965
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,278
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

966
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:56,476
- Have a good time.
- You, too.

967
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,276
You, too, have a good time.

968
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,759
Not for me, thank you.

969
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,399
Dr Hardy?

970
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,233
- Dr Hardy?
- Oh. Hey. Sorry, excuse me.

971
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,676
Reynolds, do you
remember Dr Hardy?

972
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,813
Good evening, Mr and Mrs Woodcock.

973
01:38:17,814 --> 01:38:18,814
Oh, hello.

974
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,798
How do you do, Mr Woodcock?
How are you feeling?

975
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,753
I think we met in a puddle
of sweat, didn't we?

976
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,194
Yes, that's right.

977
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,032
I probably owe you an
apology of some kind.

978
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:28,611
I seem to remember barking at you.

979
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:29,656
There's no need.

980
01:38:29,657 --> 01:38:31,685
I've been laid siege
by much worse.

981
01:38:31,686 --> 01:38:32,686
Oh, really?

982
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,434
You look very healthy.
How are you feeling?

983
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,837
Didn't I tell you to fuck off?

984
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,439
Yes. Yes, you did.

985
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,955
Dinner is served, everybody.

986
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,634
Come along.

987
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,833
That's your shifty-eyed godson?

988
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,354
Shifty-eyed?

989
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,669
He's got perfectly normal eyes.

990
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,560
I'm rather less fat, I think,
than when you last saw me.

991
01:38:58,680 --> 01:38:59,954
- Really?
- Yes.

992
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:01,678
Thank you very much indeed.

993
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,918
It's fallen off me.
Ooh. I'm so sorry.

994
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,072
There are secrets nobody tells.

995
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:14,026
Your wife has got that gorgeous

996
01:39:14,027 --> 01:39:16,874
glow you get with
a first marriage.

997
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,792
How long will you be here for?

998
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:22,672
Seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

999
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,630
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

1000
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,709
Oh...

1001
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,438
We don't have any.

1002
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,673
Well, you should come out for
the Chelsea Arts Club Ball.

1003
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,795
- I don't know what that is.
- It's not something I'd suggest

1004
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,593
if I didn't think you'd
have a wonderful time.

1005
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,478
It's really something to be seen.

1006
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,070
I'll pass it on to my husband.

1007
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,913
But I think we'll stay in.

1008
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:57,753
Change your mind.

1009
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,435
Or get him to change his
mind, or whatever it takes.

1010
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,478
Now, please come. I promise
you the time of your life.

1011
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,277
How do you know how
my life has been?

1012
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,239
I don't.

1013
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,754
You're right.

1014
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,472
I think this would be quite a
fine time, if you'd like to come.

1015
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,519
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

1016
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,879
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

1017
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,517
What on earth are you doing?

1018
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:52,553
- I rolled a three.
- Yes, but that's the four pip.

1019
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,138
Go back to the bar
where you belong.

1020
01:40:55,139 --> 01:40:56,139
Oh, sorry.

1021
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,471
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

1022
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,790
I'm not cheating. I
don't need to cheat.

1023
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,151
Oh, good. You do need to be able
to count, on the other hand.

1024
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:07,194
Backgammon, by the way,
I get treble the score

1025
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,596
because you haven't gotten
any checkers off the board.

1026
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,795
Oh.

1027
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,076
Stupid game anyway.

1028
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,874
Well, maybe it seems stupid to you
now as you're currently losing,

1029
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,469
but I dare say if you
were victorious,

1030
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,876
I'm confident you'd see
it in a different light.

1031
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,032
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent. Next.

1032
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,149
Me, please.

1033
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,912
What? What are you
so cranky about?

1034
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:34,478
Have fun with your next opponent.

1035
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,915
Why, I think I will, a lot
more than I did with you.

1036
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:40,756
Gosh. She's really
very rude, isn't she?

1037
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,672
My heart breaks for you.

1038
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,558
Oh, really?

1039
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,478
Being married to a toddler.

1040
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,432
I don't want to be racist,

1041
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:55,440
but, I mean, is there some sort of
custom at this time of the night

1042
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,113
in her country, where...

1043
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,238
- I mean, what's she doing?
- Where what?

1044
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,960
I don't know. I don't know
if she's up stealing things

1045
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,997
or attacking people, I mean...

1046
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,272
I want to go dancing.

1047
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,039
When?

1048
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,519
Right now.

1049
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,833
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not.

1050
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:27,472
It's New Year's Eve.

1051
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,231
Well, I'm not going dancing.

1052
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,639
There's a party at the Devonshire
Hall to celebrate the New Year

1053
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,750
and I want to go.

1054
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,431
We need to go dancing.

1055
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,516
So what are you going
to do about it?

1056
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,590
I'm going to stay right
here and I'm going to work.

1057
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,030
On the hour, ladies and gentlemen.

1058
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:05,233
Are you ready to welcome in our
lovely, glorious, Happy New Year?

1059
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,353
Are you ready?

1060
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,029
Here we go.

1061
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:15,035
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

1062
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:21,315
five, four, three, two,
one. Happy New Year.

1063
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:22,798
How does it feel?

1064
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,192
Well, I think it
feels a little big.

1065
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,318
Shall we just take
it in on the waist?

1066
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:29,997
We can take it in a
little on the waist.

1067
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,879
- Yes.
- Yes, okay. Just take it out.

1068
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,232
How's that feeling? I
think that's better.

1069
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,439
Would you excuse me for a
minute, please, Mrs Vaughan?

1070
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,349
Where has Henrietta Harding been?

1071
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,595
- She's been to another house.
- Which one?

1072
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:56,235
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I didn't want to.

1073
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:05,837
Is there something I'm unaware of?
Because as far as I can remember,

1074
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:08,036
all I have done is to
dress her beautifully.

1075
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:10,636
I don't think that
matters to some people.

1076
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:15,352
I think they want what
is fashionable and chic.

1077
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:20,037
Chic? Oh, don't you start using
that filthy little word. "Chic"?

1078
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:22,510
Whoever invented that ought to
be spanked in public. I don't...

1079
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,781
I don't even know
what that word means.

1080
01:49:24,782 --> 01:49:26,549
What is that word? Fucking "chic"?

1081
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:29,795
They should be hung, drawn and
quartered. Fucking "chic".

1082
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,797
It shouldn't concern
you. It does concern me.

1083
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:35,271
It concerns me very much, Cyril,
because it's hurt my feelings.

1084
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,476
It's hurt my feelings.

1085
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,391
So, what's all this moaning about?

1086
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,158
I am not moaning.

1087
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:55,318
I do not like to be
turned away from.

1088
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,438
Nobody does.

1089
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:01,671
But I don't want to hear it
because it hurts my ears.

1090
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:23,556
I've made a terrible mistake in
my life, Cyril. I've made a...

1091
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:29,274
I've made a terrible mistake.
I need you to help me.

1092
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,711
What do you want me to do?

1093
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:48,275
I can't work. I can't concentrate,

1094
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,191
I have no confidence.

1095
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,393
She does not fit in this house.

1096
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,558
We built this house,
the two of us.

1097
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:02,830
Now, she's turning the whole
bloody place upside down.

1098
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,712
She's turning me inside out.

1099
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,393
She's turning you and
me against each other.

1100
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:11,358
Her arrival has cast a
very long shadow, Cyril.

1101
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,196
Mrs Vaughan is satisfied
with the dress.

1102
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,012
No one gives a
tinker's fucking curse

1103
01:51:21,013 --> 01:51:23,349
about Mrs Vaughan's satisfaction.

1104
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,798
Thank you, Alma.

1105
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,239
Not at all.

1106
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,118
What a model of
politeness you two are.

1107
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,351
There is an air of quiet
death in this house

1108
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,719
and I do not like
the way it smells.

1109
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,711
Would you like a glass of wine?

1110
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,678
No, thank you.

1111
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,392
Can I make you a Martini?

1112
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,991
Nothing for me, thanks.

1113
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:04,913
Water?

1114
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,231
I want you flat on your back.

1115
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,633
Helpless.

1116
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,234
Tender.

1117
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,349
Open.

1118
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,956
With only me to help.

1119
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,275
And then I want you strong again.

1120
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,317
You're not going to die.

1121
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,909
You might wish you were going to
die, but you're not going to.

1122
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,475
You need to settle down a little.

1123
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:38,758
Kiss me, my girl, before I'm sick.

1124
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:03,715
I think, perhaps, you
should telephone

1125
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,720
that boy doctor of
yours, just in case.

1126
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:11,471
You don't trust me?

1127
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:15,034
No, I do trust you. It's just...

1128
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,038
If you wish.

1129
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,279
But I will make you well again.

1130
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,152
I will.

1131
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,032
I love you.

1132
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,072
I love you, too.

1133
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:45,558
And I think, perhaps, you
should leave the room.

1134
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,234
- Close the door behind you.
- Yes.

1135
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,991
I'll be right outside.

1136
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,950
If he didn't wake up from this,

1137
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,790
if he wasn't here tomorrow,

1138
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,479
no matter.

1139
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:12,397
For I know he'd be waiting
for me in the afterlife.

1140
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:15,754
Or some safe, celestial place

1141
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:22,155
in this life and the next
and the next one after.

1142
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:27,160
And for whatever there is on the
road that follows from here,

1143
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,074
it would only require my patience

1144
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,233
to get to him again.

1145
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:38,714
You see, to be in love with him
makes life no great mystery.

1146
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,554
Say, "Ah."

1147
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,073
Very good.

1148
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,357
You can put your robe back on.

1149
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,276
Sometimes I jump ahead
in our life together.

1150
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:07,069
And I see a time near the end.

1151
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:12,915
I can predict the future and
everything has settled.

1152
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:18,156
And all our lovers and
children and friends

1153
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,437
come back and are welcome.

1154
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:27,596
And we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing

1155
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,514
and playing games.

1156
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:41,991
I am older and I see
things differently,

1157
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:45,589
and I finally understand you.

1158
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:53,789
And I take care of your dresses.

1159
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:59,830
Keeping them from dust
and ghosts and time.

1160
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:26,553
Yes, but right now, we're here.

1161
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,036
Yes, of course we are.

1162
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,909
And I'm getting hungry.
