2
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,255
Despite all the warnings,
she was smoking in bed, fell asleep.

3
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,466
Bad move.

4
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:48,893
And the fire begins.

5
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:59,404
It's showtime.

6
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,827
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm here to save you!

7
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,041
Keep those people back!
This is an emergency!

8
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,962
Don't you dare die on me!

9
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:19,924
Breathe, damn it, breathe!

10
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,762
She's going to make it!

11
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,937
What the...?

12
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,400
Damn!

13
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:51,474
Though it may be hard to believe
a single biology professor...

14
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,020
...making in excess of $17,500 a year
could find time...

15
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,691
...to grade your first biology
research papers, I did.

16
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:03,570
As you can see,
there was a shocking statistical anomaly:

17
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,407
Pretty much all of you got A's.

18
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:14,622
Congratulate yourselves.
I have a good feeling about this group.

19
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:19,877
And I think the parade of A's
will continue to the end of the semester.

20
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,213
So much for the bell curve.

21
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:25,049
Bell curves suck!

22
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,884
- Mr. Kane?
- Dr. Kane?

23
00:05:27,135 --> 00:05:30,221
There seems to be a mistake here.

24
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:33,308
My brother and I each got a C-.

25
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:36,060
C-. Me, too.

26
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:39,564
Allow me to share something
with the entire class.

27
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:45,570
As I was grading papers, I came across
two gems, both entitled "Cells are Bad".

28
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,366
Both with just one paragraph, which
I unfortunately committed to memory.

29
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,410
"Cells are Bad."

30
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,412
"My uncle lives in a cell."

31
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:59,918
"It's 10 by 12 and he has to read
the same boring magazine every day."

32
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,296
"The end."

33
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,051
You're talking about our papers,
aren't you, Dr. Kane?

34
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,344
Yes, I am.

35
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,847
And although my standards
are nowhere near where they used to be...

36
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:18,603
...I couldn't put an A on those beauties.
I hope you understand.

37
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,606
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

38
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:26,444
Okay, let's get back to work
at the periodic table, which...

39
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:30,240
A meteor? Where?

40
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:36,329
Route 89A. Yeah, I got it.

41
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,085
Rest assured, I will be there. Okay, 'bye.

42
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:49,175
How does it look, Professor?

43
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,135
It's tight.

44
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:53,805
Really, really tight, Nadine.

45
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:57,976
But not too tight.
You just don't have the points. Sorry.

46
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:01,312
Don't take it too hard.
Geology's tougher than people think.

47
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:03,815
Are you sure? Could you check again?

48
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:08,361
I need this credit
to get into nursing school.

49
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:10,989
Nursing school?

50
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,366
Wouldn't you prefer a different profession?

51
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:17,745
One where lives
were not dependent on you?

52
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,666
Actually, what I want to be
is Miss Arizona.

53
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,254
But my pageant consultant says
nursing school will impress the judges.

54
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:28,423
They'll think I want to help people...

55
00:07:28,673 --> 00:07:31,718
Ready for lunch?

56
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,555
Or have you already eaten?

57
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:39,350
I'm just concluding
a teacher-student conference with Nadine.

58
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:45,982
Harry, your dedication to your job
is an inspiration to us all.

59
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,028
Regrettably, I have a prior lunch
engagement with Professor Kane.

60
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:55,491
We'll discuss your extra credit later.
Cheer up.

61
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:59,245
Let me grab my stuff.

62
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,043
Where are you taking me?

63
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:09,213
- A meteor hit last night.
- That's what that was.

64
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:12,717
As Glen Canyon's representative
for the U.S. Geological Survey...

65
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,761
...I have to check it out.

66
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:17,805
I'm taking you in case
I have to do something scientific.

67
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:18,890
Then we eat.

68
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,559
You're with the USGS?

69
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,562
I signed up over the Internet.

70
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:29,901
Or were you on a cheerleader site and
accidentally got linked to the USGS site?

71
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:32,570
Something like that.

72
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,613
Watch it. Take it easy.

73
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:38,368
That's my baby. Take it easy.

74
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,079
Come on! Be careful!

75
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,415
Who's going to pay for the damage
to my goddamn car?

76
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,669
I told you, we don't do that.
It's "force majeure".

77
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,383
"Force majeure", my ass!
That car's a classic '73 Buick Riv.

78
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,426
Who are you?

79
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:58,846
Harry Block,
United States Geological Survey.

80
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:02,642
My secretary, Ira Kane.
We're here to investigate the meteor...

81
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:04,769
...if that is what it is.

82
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,772
Of course it is. It almost blew up my car.

83
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:10,775
I'm still fuzzy
on why you were here at night.

84
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,610
With Betty Lou here.

85
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,782
I was practicing for my fireman's exam,
which started seven minutes ago.

86
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:20,868
So I'd appreciate it if you'd let me go.

87
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:23,705
So you and the blonde found the meteor?

88
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:28,042
Yeah, I found it.
It bounced my car 200 feet in the air.

89
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:33,006
- Can I go?
- Bob, get him out of here.

90
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:38,094
Don't leave town.

91
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,390
Well, Sheriff, is this the...

92
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,726
...point of penetration?

93
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:50,356
Yeah. It punched through into a cavern
about 80 feet down.

94
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:54,611
Now that's a hole!

95
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,907
Damn it!

96
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,742
Next time, you carry the case.

97
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:05,538
You're the USGS representative.
That responsibility comes with the badge.

98
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:10,001
Oh, my God. Look at that.

99
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:13,087
I believe we've located the target.

100
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:14,923
Two big smiles, fellas.

101
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:17,091
Cheese!

102
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:21,221
Okay, hold it up now.

103
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,098
- Got it.
- It's really hot.

104
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,809
I'll hold you up.

105
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,853
Show a little more nightstick.

106
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,772
Look at these jackasses.

107
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:34,776
Muscle pose. Give me big smiles!
Looking good.

108
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:38,780
At ease, gentlemen! The feds are here.

109
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,115
Feds? What feds?

110
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:42,700
Who let you down here?

111
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,869
Let's not get combative.

112
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,123
The USGS and local law enforcement
have a long history of cooperation.

113
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:53,628
We're just here to get
some scientific samples. If that's okay.

114
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:59,384
Yeah, sure. We got
all the photographic evidence we need.

115
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:03,763
- Carry on.
- Thanks. Keep up the good work.

116
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:09,018
Wow.

117
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:23,199
It just hit last night
and it has stuff growing on it.

118
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,076
Could be cave moss.

119
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:28,162
After just a few hours? That's peculiar.

120
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:32,458
Let's get a sample and get out of here.

121
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,304
It's bleeding.

122
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:48,600
It's a rock that bleeds.

123
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:52,896
Now that's really peculiar.

124
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,107
Let's bag it.

125
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:08,995
I don't know if this USGS gig
is all it's cracked up to be.

126
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:13,583
I mean, it pads out my résumé,
but am I growing as a person?

127
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:18,922
Am I growing as a Division 3
women's volleyball coach?

128
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:23,259
You going to do that spectro-thingy test?

129
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,971
Spectrograph.
Yeah, I will do a spectroscopic analysis.

130
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,265
Your résumé will shine.

131
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:34,103
I got to get to the game.
Let me know if you find anything.

132
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:42,695
Ira, are you sure you can handle this
by your lonesome?

133
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:45,990
All right.

134
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,529
That's impossible.

135
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,029
Ten base pairs.

136
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:10,992
That can't be.

137
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:17,916
Come on, ladies! Look alive up here!

138
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:26,716
Tina! When Lisa goes for the spike,
you have to cover the line!

139
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,094
Lisa! Two hands, okay? Two hands!

140
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:32,472
God gave you two hands for a reason!

141
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:35,141
Big news. The most amazing thing.

142
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:38,144
The meteor samples are teeming
with one-celled organisms.

143
00:14:38,394 --> 00:14:40,355
Their metabolic rates are off the charts.

144
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:44,067
They're dividing at an incredible rate.
Almost exponential.

145
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,986
Their DNA has ten base pairs.

146
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:49,447
Ten base pairs. That's good to know.

147
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:53,493
Harry, the DNA of all earth life
has only four base pairs.

148
00:14:53,743 --> 00:14:57,830
Come on, ladies! Look alive!

149
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,832
Harry...

150
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,003
...these are organisms from another world.

151
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:07,465
They're aliens.

152
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,845
Is the Nobel Prize paid in instalments
or a lump sum, like the lottery?

153
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:15,515
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

154
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:21,646
I'm not. I'm concerned about
the potential tax consequences.

155
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:29,028
- Why in here?
- I just want to be cautious.

156
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,825
Our discovery.

157
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm all tingly.

158
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:42,250
Wow.

159
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,174
I'm no biologist, but how many cells
do single-celled organisms have?

160
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:54,679
If we want to be big important scientists,
you have to act the part.

161
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:58,141
Take a look.

162
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:16,367
There are multi-cellular organisms in there.

163
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,452
I know.

164
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:20,038
- They weren't there before.
- They snuck in.

165
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:24,000
No, there was no sneaking in.

166
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,795
It's too amazing.

167
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,715
It's like they're evolving.

168
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:32,467
They're growing.

169
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:36,471
Growing into more complex organisms.

170
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:39,474
It's evolution.

171
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:43,144
Nobel, here we come.

172
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:48,650
But it's 200 million years worth
in just a few hours.

173
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:52,987
That's fast.

174
00:16:53,154 --> 00:16:56,699
You have no idea.

175
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,368
Get ready!

176
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,830
On my signal! Go!

177
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,959
Recruit, wake up.

178
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,961
Wake up!

179
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:11,089
Go!

180
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,261
- The hose! This thing here!
- Sorry.

181
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:17,679
Move it!

182
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:22,100
Wayne, go! Come on!

183
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:30,608
These things happen, buddy.

184
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:33,111
There's another test in six months.

185
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:36,781
Six months? I can't wait six months!

186
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:39,784
At least you have the pool gig
at the country club.

187
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,620
Great. Thanks a lot.

188
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,665
Drive careful.

189
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:50,295
I got it. I do this.

190
00:17:56,467 --> 00:18:00,179
Looks like we have visitors.

191
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:11,816
Class, since this is our first field trip,
I want you to obey some simple rules.

192
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,318
Dirt.

193
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,903
Nice footwear.

194
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,614
Perfect for spelunking.
Now don't touch anything.

195
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:20,450
Don't move anything.
Don't even breathe unless we say.

196
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,493
Wear your protective gloves at all times.

197
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:24,078
Why do we have to do this?

198
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,999
Field experience.
The meat and potatoes of geology.

199
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:30,335
- Will this be on the final?
- Yes.

200
00:18:30,585 --> 00:18:32,921
- Officer, nice to see you.
- What's up, Professor?

201
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:34,672
We came to pick up the rock.

202
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,800
Pick it up? What?

203
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:42,013
Orders from the USGS.
They want it under controlled conditions.

204
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,349
It's very technical.

205
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,851
Oh, technical stuff. It's technical.

206
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:48,603
Okay. Go right ahead.

207
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:51,022
- We'll just haul it right out.
- Sure.

208
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:53,942
Deke and Danny?
Remember what we talked about?

209
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:57,695
You're in charge of hoisting.
Get the winch to the hole.

210
00:18:57,946 --> 00:19:02,575
Fellas? Stop nodding, and stare at me
for a second, okay?

211
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:04,702
Focus.

212
00:19:04,953 --> 00:19:08,206
- You understand what I want you to do?
- Yeah.

213
00:19:08,456 --> 00:19:11,167
Go do it.

214
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:24,389
Ira, I'm picking up
a heavy creepy vibe here.

215
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:28,184
Yeah, a lot has changed.

216
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:35,692
Class, I know these look like mushrooms,
but refrain from eating them.

217
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:40,488
It smells disgusting.

218
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:44,075
Nadine, sometimes science stinks.

219
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:47,787
It's the game we play, baby.

220
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,876
Rotten egg smell. Hydrogen sulfide, right?

221
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:57,255
With ammonia and methane.
It's converting the atmosphere.

222
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:01,926
Look at all this rudimentary plant life.
It's amazing.

223
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:09,142
Not to get all girly here, but I feel
something wiggling around my toes.

224
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:16,733
The ground does seem to be moving.

225
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,827
Flatworms.

226
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:30,121
Millions of them!

227
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,832
Yuck!

228
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:38,630
Barely 18 hours
and we already have flatworms.

229
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,381
- Look.
- There they are!

230
00:20:40,632 --> 00:20:43,843
Hi, Dr. Kane!

231
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:49,057
- I almost went down on that one!
- Awesome.

232
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:54,479
Come here, little buddy.

233
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,151
I won't hurt you.

234
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:07,742
You didn't hurt it. You killed it.

235
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:10,370
The oxygen must have killed it.

236
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,415
It must need its own atmosphere to live.

237
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:20,004
Grab a specimen jar. We'll scoop
some atmosphere in there with them.

238
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:26,010
It took us two billion years to do
what they did in a couple of days.

239
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:30,431
Those germs are the embodiment
of the American dream.

240
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:33,351
I'm sorry to interrupt, Professor Block.

241
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:37,021
But I was wondering if I'm correct
in assuming that that field trip...

242
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:40,024
...fulfilled any of my missing
credit assignments?

243
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,026
Nadine, you are a very...

244
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:47,073
...very smart girl. If you would just focus.

245
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:55,206
Professor, the little wiggly worm things
are breaking.

246
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:58,334
Ira, look.

247
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:04,048
It's not breaking. It's splitting.

248
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:07,385
It's mitosis. That's how they reproduce.

249
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:09,387
No sex?

250
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:11,806
No time for sex.

251
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:14,392
Bummer.

252
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:17,562
- They're splitting again.
- Put it away.

253
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:21,399
We call no one, we tell no one.
This is our secret.

254
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:24,319
What about the government?
They usually get involved.

255
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:29,699
- No government. I know those people.
- You do?

256
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:32,911
This is our discovery.
We must maintain absolute control.

257
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:38,541
We have to do more research and
check our findings. Document everything.

258
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:48,426
Wayne?

259
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,638
What's this?

260
00:22:51,888 --> 00:22:55,475
That would be an all-cotton towel, sir.
I believe it's a Fieldcrest.

261
00:22:55,725 --> 00:23:00,521
It's a damp towel.
What is a damp towel doing on my "chaise"?

262
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,192
- Let me take care of this for you.
- You should, as pool manager.

263
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:09,697
If anyone knows what to do
about the dampness on my chair, it's you.

264
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:15,828
"You know what to do with the towels
because you're the pool boy."

265
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:23,628
What the hell?

266
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:36,474
Where did you guys come from?

267
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:54,242
You're dead now.

268
00:24:20,476 --> 00:24:25,064
When I checked the samples this morning
I found three different subspecies.

269
00:24:25,315 --> 00:24:30,862
They're evolving so quickly God knows
what we'll find when we get back.

270
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:39,913
- Please tell me there's an air show today.
- Damn.

271
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,376
Shit.

272
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,094
Can I help you?

273
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:58,264
Harry Block, Ira Kane.
United States Geological Society.

274
00:24:58,514 --> 00:25:02,769
We're doing some important research.
This is our site.

275
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:05,605
Not anymore. You're not on the list.

276
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:07,857
What? We come here all the time.

277
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:11,277
Well this is not a nightclub.
Why don't you take it somewhere else.

278
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:13,988
I know my constitutional rights.
You can't tell...

279
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:19,786
Harry! Maybe you can call your superior,
we can have a word with him?

280
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,791
I have a Harry Block and an Ira Kane here...

281
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:27,752
Punk.

282
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:31,297
- Talk nice to the white man.
- I'll whup his ass.

283
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:34,050
White man doesn't like to be yelled at.

284
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,802
Ira Kane?

285
00:25:36,052 --> 00:25:38,471
The Ira Kane?

286
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:42,642
I've looked forward to this for a long time.
You bastard!

287
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:45,478
You're history! You're done!

288
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,063
Get his gun!

289
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,649
Take it easy! Okay, they're going up.

290
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:53,736
You're responsible for the worst month
of my life!

291
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:56,322
- What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.

292
00:25:56,573 --> 00:26:00,660
Drive down to the command tent.
They're expecting you.

293
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,078
Go.

294
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:05,331
That guy had me in diapers
for over a month!

295
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:08,793
What the hell was that?

296
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:41,743
- General Woodman's expecting you.
- Russell Woodman?

297
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:48,458
What an unexpected surprise.

298
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,878
For me, too.
I didn't know we were on a hugging basis.

299
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:54,255
Same old Ira Kane. And you are?

300
00:26:54,505 --> 00:27:00,136
Harry Block, this is Gen. Russell Woodman,
head of U.S. Army Research.

301
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,389
You two know each other?

302
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,225
Ira used to work for me, right?

303
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:08,311
I worked with you, actually.

304
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:11,189
You worked in Army Research
in the Pentagon?

305
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:13,983
All this time I thought you were just
a schoolteacher.

306
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:17,320
No. How did you find out about this?

307
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,074
You leave the Pentagon,
you don't call, you don't write.

308
00:27:21,324 --> 00:27:23,576
We like to keep tabs on our prodigal sons.

309
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,745
You tapped my phone?

310
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:27,747
No. We're not the KGB.

311
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:31,876
We've been monitoring your computer.

312
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:34,170
His computer?

313
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,757
All those girls in the photos are over 18.

314
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,175
Yes, I'm sure.

315
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:40,927
I should have figured, Russell.

316
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:44,764
You should've known better than
to keep something this big from us.

317
00:27:45,014 --> 00:27:46,349
And the CDC.

318
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:51,938
Just in time. Ira, this is Allison Reed,
senior researcher in epidemiology at...

319
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:54,107
...the CDC.

320
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:55,567
Nice underwear.

321
00:27:55,817 --> 00:27:58,194
A garter belt? At a day function?

322
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,779
I can do it. Thank you.

323
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:01,948
I'm okay.

324
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:03,074
Dr. Kane.

325
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:06,786
I'd heard about your recklessness
but you are way out of line on this one.

326
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:10,206
Didn't you realise how dangerous
the situation could have become?

327
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:11,624
Nice to meet you, too.

328
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:16,296
No need to play the blame game, Allison.
No harm, no foul.

329
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:20,550
We're all appreciative about the discovery
made by Dr. Kane and Mr. Black.

330
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,135
Block.

331
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:23,720
Block. I'm sorry.

332
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,472
The confirmation that life exists
outside this planet...

333
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:29,267
Would be the greatest
scientific discovery of our time.

334
00:28:29,517 --> 00:28:32,812
- Yes, actually.
- Yes, it would.

335
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:35,982
You have my word you'll be
kept in the loop from this point on.

336
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:37,567
You son of a bitch.

337
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:40,320
Kept in the loop? We are the loop.

338
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,822
We won't cut you out
but we need to take control.

339
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:46,576
We're following protocol, Ira.
You remember protocol, don't you?

340
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,495
I have some protocol right here for you,
come and get it.

341
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:54,834
Look! The fact is, this research
must continue under government control.

342
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:56,586
We've already secured the area.

343
00:28:56,836 --> 00:29:01,007
We're constructing an airlock
and a state-of-the-art field research facility.

344
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:04,344
So there's not a whole lot
for the science department...

345
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:07,180
...of Glen Canyon Community College
to do here.

346
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,766
Did you catch that condescending tone?

347
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,560
We are following well-established
federal guidelines...

348
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,855
Please, don't pull this crap.
We deserve to be here.

349
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:18,858
You deserve to be here?

350
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:23,863
You're lucky anybody's ever let you
near a science laboratory again.

351
00:29:24,113 --> 00:29:28,534
You're a disgrace,
and a dangerous one at that.

352
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,706
Lieutenant, show these men out.

353
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:36,709
This is horseshit.

354
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,045
It's not over.

355
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:42,382
You're in for a fight, Russell.

356
00:29:42,632 --> 00:29:46,469
Would you stop following me? Thank you.

357
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,222
We won't bend over and take this!

358
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:52,225
Fruit basket for Russell Woodman!

359
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:55,895
Happy holidays, General!

360
00:29:58,314 --> 00:30:01,109
Cute.

361
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:06,239
Dr. Kane, are you asking me to bar
the federal government from involvement...

362
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,908
...in a discovery as significant as this one?

363
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:13,997
No. We're asking you to ensure the local
scientists who made the discovery...

364
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,124
...continue to play a significant role.

365
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:18,376
They've kept us out for almost two weeks.

366
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:22,338
We put our lives on the line to find
these little guys, Your Majesty.

367
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:25,592
We just want to be there for them
as they grow up.

368
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:30,346
We were first team at the meteor site and
all the initial testing was done in our lab.

369
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:35,059
The facilities at Glen Canyon
Community College are a joke.

370
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,272
They weren't a joke
when I went there, General.

371
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:44,944
Your Honour, if the court would allow me
to depose Dr. Kane.

372
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:46,571
Depose me?

373
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:49,115
We think your past
is very relevant, Dr. Kane.

374
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:54,704
These issues speak directly
to his competence as a scientist.

375
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,834
Dr. Kane, you were a top-level researcher
at USAMRID from '94 to '97...

376
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,044
...were you not?

377
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,629
That's correct.

378
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:08,968
You were summarily dismissed
in the summer of 1997. Any idea why?

379
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:12,639
My services were no longer required?

380
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,893
So your firing had nothing to do
with an experimental anthrax vaccine...

381
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:23,316
...you developed and administered to
140,000 U.S. Soldiers in May of that year?

382
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:25,860
I see where you're going with this.

383
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,490
It may have been a factor.
You need to ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

384
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,494
I'll do that. For now, can you tell me
what happened...

385
00:31:34,744 --> 00:31:36,829
...to the soldiers who were inoculated?

386
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,001
None of them got anthrax,
if that's what you're asking.

387
00:31:42,252 --> 00:31:43,753
What did they get?

388
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:47,173
Well, as with any new vaccine...

389
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:49,926
...there were certain side effects
associated with...

390
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,928
Could you be more specific?

391
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:56,516
It's very technical.
I'd hate to waste the court's time with it.

392
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:59,394
Humour me.

393
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:03,189
Some debilitating stomach cramps.

394
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,191
Severe diarrhoea.

395
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,360
Memory loss.

396
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,031
Yes. Go on. Any more symptoms?

397
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:17,203
Partial facial paralysis,
temporary blindness, drooling...

398
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:20,540
...bleeding gums, erectile dysfunction...

399
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,334
...uncontrollable flatulence.

400
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,712
I think that's it.

401
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:27,714
One more question.

402
00:32:27,964 --> 00:32:32,635
Do you remember
what the soldiers called this illness?

403
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:41,978
They called it the Kane Madness.

404
00:32:45,982 --> 00:32:48,568
Keep your head up.

405
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:51,487
You know she wants to give you some.

406
00:32:51,738 --> 00:32:54,240
Were you even in that courtroom?

407
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:00,204
Getting barbecued like babyback ribs?
It's all foreplay.

408
00:33:08,338 --> 00:33:09,505
We've been hit.

409
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:13,885
Forget the foreplay. We just got screwed.

410
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,599
- Empty.
- This is bad. This is very, very bad.

411
00:33:19,849 --> 00:33:22,852
Damn it!

412
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:29,067
I don't care who they are.
Stealing is stealing!

413
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:40,328
They took the rock, the samples,
all the little wormy critters.

414
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:44,707
All the data's gone. The JPEG files,
the DNA sequences. They cleaned us out.

415
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:47,293
- I'm calling the cops.
- The cops?

416
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:50,588
They are the cops!

417
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,550
Then what?

418
00:34:06,062 --> 00:34:07,438
Let me ask you something.

419
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:10,400
How come you get to be a colonel
and I'm just a private?

420
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,859
I was a colonel.

421
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,696
And you obviously served
your country with distinction.

422
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:16,197
Consider yourself lucky.

423
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:19,534
The penalty for impersonating an officer
is five years in prison.

424
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:23,705
Maybe for you, white boy. Me, they hang.

425
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:27,166
Colonels first.

426
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:34,382
We been out here for twelve hours.
My toe is starting to hurt.

427
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,722
Stop it.

428
00:34:43,975 --> 00:34:48,187
- Just act like you belong.
- Don't worry, I got this.

429
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:50,231
- Pick up that butt, soldier.
- Sorry, sir.

430
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:53,151
- And tuck that shirt in.
- Yes, sir.

431
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:56,195
Get the door.

432
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:59,574
Thank you, Private.

433
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:03,077
Don't get used to this.

434
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:33,233
Look at that.

435
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:40,323
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

436
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:49,916
Your girlfriend, 11:00.

437
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:53,795
Darn it.

438
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:56,297
The woman's a menace.

439
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:59,467
Testing, one, two.

440
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:03,304
This is DJ Harry Block here
and I'm an Aquarius.

441
00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:05,223
Stop. I can hear you.

442
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:11,020
Don't snap at me, unless you want
an angry "Solid Gold" dancer on your hands.

443
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:14,107
Lieutenant?

444
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:19,112
Who's that?

445
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:23,116
I don't know.

446
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:26,578
I don't have anything on my schedule.

447
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:30,999
Maybe it's the guys from Sector 12
doing a nocturnal specimen run.

448
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:34,419
You know how those guys are.

449
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:43,136
This place has changed.

450
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:03,531
Can you believe this?

451
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:06,993
Harry, look at that.

452
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:24,427
Our little babies are growing up.

453
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:34,687
Three weeks,
it's already like a rain forest in here.

454
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:40,443
Looks like the kitchen
from my first apartment.

455
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:48,201
Harry...

456
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:51,621
...check that guy out.

457
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:00,171
Is it coming or going?

458
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:07,762
That tree just ate it.

459
00:38:08,012 --> 00:38:12,767
Everything here seems to be food for
something else, so let's stay off the menu.

460
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:16,062
You got that right.

461
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:24,320
Come here, look at these little things.

462
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:30,451
Cool.

463
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:32,787
Snag one.

464
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:34,372
Snag one?

465
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,791
Yeah. Snag one and put it in the bucket.

466
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:39,961
I've seen this movie.
The black dude dies first. You snag it.

467
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:43,548
Don't be scared.
We came for a specimen, now snag one.

468
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:47,635
He won't hurt you,
he's turned the other way. He's eating.

469
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:49,304
Come on.

470
00:38:49,554 --> 00:38:51,973
Come on, my little red lobster.

471
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:57,437
Come on, my sexy little crustacean.

472
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:08,156
Look at that backside.

473
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:13,494
Theatre-in-the-round. That's the kind of
trunk space you want in a late model car.

474
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:15,496
Who does that remind you of?

475
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,832
I have no idea what you're talking about.

476
00:39:18,082 --> 00:39:20,668
She's been throwing it at you enough.

477
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,837
- Dr. Reed?
- Bull's-eye.

478
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:26,674
Excuse me. Dr. Reed?
Did you authorise a walk-through?

479
00:39:26,925 --> 00:39:29,177
No. Why?

480
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:32,680
You should probably
take a look at something.

481
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,558
Here.

482
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:40,355
That's the kind of rump you'd like to roast.
Kind of mother you'd like to butter.

483
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:43,942
That is a nice image.
And I appreciate your assumption...

484
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:47,111
... that there is
an actual sexual human being...

485
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:50,531
... underneath
all Dr. Reed's deep-seated neuroses...

486
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:53,034
...but I don't think so.
- What?

487
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:56,871
I think she is a humourless ice queen.

488
00:39:57,121 --> 00:40:02,043
That's just a cover, don't you know that?
All she needs is a good humping.

489
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:06,506
Oh, Ira. Ira!

490
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:11,928
We have to get a piece of the asteroid.
And cut that out, it disturbs me.

491
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:14,180
Don't do that behind my back like that.

492
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,057
- I'm not doing it.
- Cut it out.

493
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:19,269
I'm just walking.

494
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:26,734
Let's bag that and get the hell out of here.

495
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:31,990
I'm ready when you are, Colonel.
This disco suit is making me chafe.

496
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:37,078
Shoo, fly.

497
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:41,082
Hold it. Right there.

498
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,918
Dr. Reed. Nice to see you again.
We were just leaving.

499
00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:47,964
You realise you're in violation of the
judge's orders. I could have you arrested.

500
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:50,550
Talk about violations. What about our lab?

501
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,093
Anyone have a can of Raid?

502
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:55,763
- What are you talking about?
- You stole our computer files, our samples.

503
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:58,182
- I didn't steal anything.
- Your buddies did.

504
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:00,268
- They cleaned us out.
- No, we didn't.

505
00:41:00,518 --> 00:41:01,311
Damn right.

506
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:03,313
You've been trying to grab credit...

507
00:41:03,563 --> 00:41:07,275
...on our discovery from the beginning.
We just want what's rightfully ours.

508
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:10,695
Credit has nothing to do with it.
I'm concerned with public safety.

509
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:14,032
- Is any of this true, Flemming?
- Absolutely not.

510
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:17,660
- Something's in my suit.
- You're not going to believe him!

511
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,203
Something's in my suit.

512
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:22,624
- What?
- There's something in my suit!

513
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:25,293
That's impossible, it's sealed!

514
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:29,964
The fly! There's a fly in my suit!

515
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:33,301
Take off your helmet! Turn up the oxygen!

516
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:36,429
It'll kill it!

517
00:41:38,056 --> 00:41:41,226
Do you see it? Look. Do you see it?

518
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:43,144
No.

519
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:45,230
- You're all right. Who's the man?
- You are.

520
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,814
- No, you're the man!
- I'm the man.

521
00:41:47,065 --> 00:41:49,150
- You're the man!
- Okay.

522
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,278
Oh, God.

523
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,409
It's in me!

524
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:04,916
For the love of everything holy,
get this thing out of me!

525
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,669
You'll be okay! Cut him open and get it.

526
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,922
Cut me open?
There goes your Christmas gift, you Judas!

527
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:12,966
It's moving down his leg!

528
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:15,176
- What do we do?
- Might have to amputate.

529
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:18,096
Don't take my leg!
Don't let them take my leg!

530
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:20,848
Anything else you can do?
He thinks he's an athlete.

531
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:23,893
Doctor, look.

532
00:42:24,936 --> 00:42:26,604
It's heading for his testicles.

533
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:29,357
Take it! Take the leg!

534
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:32,485
Wait!

535
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,820
It's going the other way.

536
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,198
Give me some forceps.
I might be able to catch it in his colon.

537
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:40,201
- How will you go in?
- Rectally.

538
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,661
I'll get the lubricant.

539
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:44,330
- No time.
- There's always time for lubricant!

540
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:46,124
Flip him!

541
00:42:46,374 --> 00:42:48,543
Okay, here we go.

542
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:50,795
- You have to try to relax.
- It'll be okay.

543
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:53,548
I'll shove this gurney up your ass,
see if you relax!

544
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:55,216
Cheek spreader.

545
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:58,261
I'm going in.

546
00:43:00,388 --> 00:43:03,308
- Don't clench.
- You're so brave.

547
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:05,393
- A little more.
- No more!

548
00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:07,061
A little deeper.

549
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:09,063
No deeper!

550
00:43:09,314 --> 00:43:10,732
Squeeze my hand.

551
00:43:10,982 --> 00:43:13,318
- Almost there.
- Open up.

552
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:15,653
- Breathe.
- I'm breathing.

553
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:19,657
- Almost there.
- You're there!

554
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:20,909
Got it!

555
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,621
It's over.

556
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,916
It just died.

557
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:32,545
Don't you ever do that again!

558
00:43:34,672 --> 00:43:37,759
Those forceps were like this.
You took it like a man.

559
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:41,596
You did great. Can we get you anything?

560
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:44,766
Ice cream. I'd like an ice cream, please.

561
00:43:45,016 --> 00:43:46,351
What flavour?

562
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:50,980
It doesn't matter. It's for my ass.

563
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,118
Man!

564
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:06,788
Now I'm a Hawaiian warrior?

565
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:11,960
I'm thinking seriously about moving.
Maybe to California. Start over.

566
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:15,463
Because of the fireman thing?
Big deal. You flunked out.

567
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:18,299
You know how many times
I've flunked in my life?

568
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,551
A ton.

569
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:22,637
Pool boy, you watering down the mai tais?

570
00:44:22,887 --> 00:44:28,184
No, sir.
But let me fix you something special.

571
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:31,980
Because you're nothing
but a big, fat monkey turd.

572
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,941
Excuse me?

573
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:38,403
Drink's almost ready.

574
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:43,616
Here you go. That should tide you over.

575
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:59,841
"Don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks"

576
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:04,846
"For makin' whoopee"

577
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:16,190
Damn it!

578
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:19,652
That's going to stain.

579
00:45:37,295 --> 00:45:39,380
Barry!

580
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:42,550
Barry, where are you? I can't see you?

581
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,385
Where are you?

582
00:45:44,636 --> 00:45:48,598
I'm down here, my pet, by the water.

583
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:19,712
Something just ate Barry Cartwright!

584
00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:24,384
That's too bad.

585
00:46:28,513 --> 00:46:32,350
I don't get it. How does someone
with your background...

586
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,605
...credentials, and talent end up...

587
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:40,441
...like you?

588
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:41,609
Thank you.

589
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:45,154
Your partner could have died.
What were you thinking?

590
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:46,614
I was desperate.

591
00:46:46,864 --> 00:46:49,534
I've been exiled out here in Arizona
for five years...

592
00:46:49,784 --> 00:46:51,536
...watching the world pass me by...

593
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:57,709
...and this amazing discovery
falls into my lap. It's my ticket out of here.

594
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:03,172
I don't suppose you would understand that.

595
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:09,971
No, how could I? I'm just a humourless
ice maiden in need of a good humping.

596
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:12,891
You heard that?

597
00:47:13,141 --> 00:47:15,518
Loud and clear.

598
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:18,313
Don't think you know so much about me.

599
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:20,273
You don't.

600
00:47:20,523 --> 00:47:23,484
I'm sure I don't.

601
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:28,740
Thank you for not calling the cops.

602
00:47:37,957 --> 00:47:42,337
- Be careful!
- Stop being such a baby.

603
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:48,009
We've seen that car before.

604
00:47:48,426 --> 00:47:51,971
No more bran for me.

605
00:47:53,514 --> 00:47:55,975
Hey, girls.

606
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,400
Cut it out.

607
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:06,402
It's the meteor guy.

608
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:08,821
What's in the bag, your blow-up doll?

609
00:48:09,072 --> 00:48:12,909
No. I've got something
you're really going to like.

610
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:16,871
- What happened to you?
- Shut up.

611
00:48:17,872 --> 00:48:20,625
You guys teach here?

612
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,503
I was thinking about taking some classes...

613
00:48:23,753 --> 00:48:29,050
...but I decided to hit the job market
early and get a jump start on things.

614
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:32,178
Can we help you?

615
00:48:32,428 --> 00:48:35,557
A guy got killed
at my country club last night.

616
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:38,101
A real douchebag, but...

617
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:42,105
...that just doesn't make it right.

618
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:45,400
It was an animal attack.

619
00:48:48,987 --> 00:48:50,738
Isn't that something?

620
00:48:50,989 --> 00:48:55,493
Happened by the water hazard on the 4th
green. The lady he was banging saw it.

621
00:48:55,743 --> 00:48:59,747
We chased this sucker on the fairway,
then it died in a sand trap.

622
00:48:59,998 --> 00:49:03,501
It just died? How?

623
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:07,005
Like it was choking to death.

624
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:09,674
You know? Stopped breathing.

625
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:15,680
It's like nothing I ever saw before.
I thought you guys might want to see it.

626
00:49:28,526 --> 00:49:33,072
Jill, you've got some kind
of infestation here.

627
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:37,744
You have a serious bug problem.

628
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:49,088
Jill? There's something in your closet.

629
00:49:51,716 --> 00:49:53,468
Open the door, Grace.

630
00:49:53,718 --> 00:49:57,263
Me? It's your house.

631
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:20,119
When did you guys get a dog?

632
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:25,250
We don't have a damn dog.

633
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:29,170
I don't think that's a dog.
It's like some kind of rodent.

634
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,966
Or a muskrat or a pig.

635
00:50:33,091 --> 00:50:34,759
How did it get in here?

636
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:37,679
It doesn't look too healthy, does it?

637
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:40,348
Well, it's frightened.

638
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:45,520
He can barely breathe, he's so scared.

639
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,856
Come on, cutie pie.

640
00:50:49,107 --> 00:50:50,692
Don't be afraid.

641
00:50:50,942 --> 00:50:55,071
Come on. That's a good boy...

642
00:51:03,288 --> 00:51:05,915
911?

643
00:51:20,638 --> 00:51:24,100
What the hell is that thing?

644
00:51:29,772 --> 00:51:32,358
Thanks.

645
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:35,194
Pick me up in an hour. No, two.

646
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:39,824
Well, an hour and a half would be good.

647
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:56,507
Hi. Do you have any messages for me?

648
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,888
Two single beds, please. We're fighting.

649
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:06,392
Come on. I'm tired. I've had two hours
of sleep. I need a shower.

650
00:52:06,643 --> 00:52:08,311
They're spreading.

651
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:13,233
You mean the golf course? Woodman sent
a team out there two hours ago.

652
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:17,570
Too bad you missed the 5-foot
amphibian that's lying dead in my lab.

653
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,323
They're adapting.
We have got to shut it down.

654
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:24,244
You're overreacting. We can handle this.

655
00:52:24,494 --> 00:52:27,080
I used to be arrogant like you.

656
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,749
We're both aware of what that led to.

657
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:33,378
Take me seriously, Allison.

658
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,256
I do take you seriously.

659
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:40,260
Then talk to Woodman,
because he won't listen to me.

660
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,889
We have to kill these things
while we still can.

661
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:49,269
All right. I'll talk to him,
but I can't promise anything.

662
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:51,604
Thank you.

663
00:52:51,854 --> 00:52:55,733
Just one more thing.

664
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:59,988
Could you ever be attracted to me?

665
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,576
- 'Bye, Ira.
- Just food for thought.

666
00:53:10,373 --> 00:53:13,585
She's mine.

667
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:18,298
I've been an adjunct professor
for almost four years.

668
00:53:18,548 --> 00:53:24,470
I'm hoping this whole alien brouhaha will
net me an honorary doctorate somewhere.

669
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:27,140
You going to finish that bacon?

670
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:30,810
Yeah, I am. I ordered it, didn't I?

671
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:36,274
So, about the coaching. Girls volleyball?

672
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:38,484
Do you ever get to see them take showers?

673
00:53:38,735 --> 00:53:43,156
Yeah, all the time.
Sometimes I shower with them.

674
00:53:43,406 --> 00:53:45,491
You're kidding, right?

675
00:53:45,742 --> 00:53:48,161
- So?
- She's going to talk to Woodman.

676
00:53:48,411 --> 00:53:50,496
Thank goodness.

677
00:53:50,747 --> 00:53:53,541
I'm okay.

678
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,835
So, level with me, fellows.

679
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:58,838
Is there some sort of alien...

680
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:02,091
...attack happening here?

681
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:05,136
We don't know.

682
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:10,475
Could I borrow your cream?

683
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,851
Hi, Denise.

684
00:54:12,101 --> 00:54:15,939
Hello, Ira. Still setting the world on fire?

685
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:18,775
That's Ira's ex over there
sitting with the cop.

686
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:23,029
Why the police escort?
You're not under arrest, are you?

687
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:26,532
Funny. This is Sam.
He's about to make detective.

688
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:31,454
I know Sam. Maybe you can look into
what happened to my missing shirts.

689
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:34,457
Did I tell you? She left
with two or three of my shirts.

690
00:54:34,707 --> 00:54:36,543
See what I mean?

691
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:41,506
I'm not up on the law,
but is it against the law to...

692
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:44,133
...walk out of someone's house
with what they own?

693
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:47,053
You want your shirt? Seriously, take it.

694
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:50,557
You must be cold, right? Is that it?

695
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:53,226
Why should I wear a shirt that's yours?

696
00:54:53,476 --> 00:54:54,477
Calm down.

697
00:54:54,727 --> 00:54:57,897
It's amazing how many women
just open their shirt to him.

698
00:54:58,147 --> 00:55:01,568
He'll let you borrow the shirt
for just today. Right, Professor?

699
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:06,239
10-99, we have a code 12-72
over in Valley Vista...

700
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:08,741
12-72? That's an animal attack.

701
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:10,577
10-99 responding.

702
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:12,745
- Got to go, babe.
- Now?

703
00:55:12,996 --> 00:55:15,874
They're calling.

704
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,585
Be careful out there.

705
00:55:18,835 --> 00:55:22,297
You'll take care of the check, right?

706
00:55:30,013 --> 00:55:33,725
I want those shirts back, Denise.

707
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:39,939
You have to admit, this animal attack
has kind of an ominous feel, doesn't it?

708
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:42,275
- Check it out?
- Check it out.

709
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:45,403
All right!

710
00:55:57,207 --> 00:56:02,629
Looks like we're under the microscope,
so let's be subtle. No cowboy stuff, okay?

711
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:04,631
- No problem.
- Professionals.

712
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:06,883
Officer Johnson.

713
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:08,760
What are you doing here?

714
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,386
We heard about the attack.

715
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:14,974
Part of our job
is to ascertain if there's any health risk.

716
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:18,019
No. Not this time. Forget about it.

717
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:21,147
- You didn't touch it, right?
- That would be a serious no-no.

718
00:56:21,397 --> 00:56:24,901
- You did? He touched it.
- He shouldn't have touched it.

719
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:26,819
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

720
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,989
Okay. Why don't you come in
and take a look?

721
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,158
I'll be checking things out...

722
00:56:32,408 --> 00:56:36,287
...around here in this vicinity.

723
00:56:42,752 --> 00:56:44,837
This dog is all ass.

724
00:56:45,088 --> 00:56:49,467
Jeez. Ira, look at this, man.

725
00:56:51,844 --> 00:56:53,846
He would have come from in here, right?

726
00:56:54,097 --> 00:56:58,476
It's just used for storage
and access under the house.

727
00:57:02,939 --> 00:57:07,151
Looks like he crawled through the dirt.

728
00:57:08,778 --> 00:57:10,196
Hey, guys.

729
00:57:10,446 --> 00:57:12,031
I was conducting...

730
00:57:12,282 --> 00:57:17,370
...a parameter check,
and there's something you better see.

731
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,455
You liked that thing,
you're going to love this.

732
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:21,708
What is it?

733
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:25,003
What is it?

734
00:57:32,635 --> 00:57:35,054
Great googa-mooga!

735
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:38,349
What did I tell you?

736
00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:42,061
They're crawling out.

737
00:57:42,312 --> 00:57:46,065
They're trying to breathe
in our atmosphere.

738
00:57:46,316 --> 00:57:50,695
Fortunately, they haven't been able
to adapt yet.

739
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:58,703
- I think I know how these things got here.
- How?

740
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:03,917
This entire area is just a honeycomb
of caves and old mine shafts.

741
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:08,254
I believe the Moenave cave system
starts a few miles away...

742
00:58:08,504 --> 00:58:11,966
...west of the golf course.
It runs into the foothills, continues to...

743
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:16,596
...the Kaibab Plateau
and goes right into Lake Powell.

744
00:58:17,347 --> 00:58:20,099
Our cave...

745
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:25,730
...is smack dab in the middle
of the system. It's all connected.

746
00:58:26,648 --> 00:58:29,108
- Could you repeat that?
- I'm impressed.

747
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:34,864
Beneath this calm, sexy exterior
beats the heart of a true scientist.

748
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:38,159
That one's moving.

749
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,416
What the hell is it doing?

750
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:51,381
I think it's trying to breathe.

751
00:58:59,889 --> 00:59:03,434
That's like a big loogie!

752
00:59:18,908 --> 00:59:22,620
"Mazel tov." It's a boy.

753
00:59:24,747 --> 00:59:27,876
It's oxygen tolerant.

754
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:37,010
It's flying away. Is that a bad thing?

755
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,722
Only if you're a human being.

756
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:43,683
You know how I hate shopping.

757
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:49,647
- You need something for Thanksgiving.
- I have enough clothes.

758
00:59:51,274 --> 00:59:55,486
I think that colour is great on you.

759
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:31,314
I think this may be the place.

760
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:40,657
Ever used one of these before?

761
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:43,159
Just 'cause I'm a teacher
don't make me a pussy.

762
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:49,666
Ladies, there's a flying extraterrestrial
in the store. Can we focus?

763
01:00:57,006 --> 01:01:00,718
I'm in here. Just a minute.

764
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:05,265
Just a second, please!

765
01:01:05,515 --> 01:01:10,395
I said, just a second, bitch.

766
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:16,234
How would you like me
to scratch out your eyes?

767
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,266
Here, birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy-birdy!

768
01:01:58,902 --> 01:02:03,740
If I was a giant, nasty alien bird
in a department store, where would I be?

769
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,618
- Lingerie.
- Not you, the bird.

770
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:09,621
Lingerie.

771
01:02:11,414 --> 01:02:14,459
Help!

772
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:36,981
You go low. I'm going high.

773
01:02:58,127 --> 01:03:00,046
We'll never find this damn thing.

774
01:03:00,296 --> 01:03:01,881
I lost him!

775
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:06,511
How do you lose a 20-foot bird in a mall?

776
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:09,889
I don't know.

777
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:13,268
What do we do now?

778
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:26,072
Wayne.

779
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:30,660
I think we've established that
"ca-caw" and "tookie-tookie" don't work.

780
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,913
Right. Sorry.

781
01:03:34,163 --> 01:03:38,710
So what do you say, Ira? Pack it in?

782
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,969
Step back. I'm going to shoot him.

783
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:52,015
Stand down. I'll kill this one myself.

784
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:56,144
Give me a chance.
I'm communicating here.

785
01:04:02,025 --> 01:04:07,238
Wayne, please stop.
You are embarrassing me.

786
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:30,720
It's working.

787
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,515
Sing. Rub some funk on it.

788
01:04:42,398 --> 01:04:47,111
Here he comes!
You grab the girl, I'll get the bird.

789
01:05:15,848 --> 01:05:18,685
All right! Nice shot!

790
01:05:18,935 --> 01:05:21,688
I am so sorry. I swear to God...

791
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:24,857
...I will never shoplift again.

792
01:05:25,108 --> 01:05:27,902
Good.

793
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:39,873
So what do you want, light meat or dark?

794
01:05:40,123 --> 01:05:43,167
You have to ask?

795
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,135
It's dead now.

796
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:38,932
I'm standing at the edge of
the Valley Vista housing community...

797
01:06:39,182 --> 01:06:44,437
... where just below me are dozens of giant,
odd-looking, dead creatures.

798
01:06:44,687 --> 01:06:48,775
We should stress that, to this point,
we have had no official word from...

799
01:06:49,025 --> 01:06:54,113
This ugly tentacle came out of the ground
and tried to grab my private parts.

800
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:56,533
I batted it away. It got my hand.

801
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:59,869
There is anxiety and confusion
in the Glen Canyon area.

802
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:05,124
We're outside the state capitol building
awaiting comment from the Governor...

803
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:11,256
... concerning the nature and origin
of these extraordinary creatures.

804
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,645
Governor Lewis, this way.

805
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:28,398
Can someone tell me
why I was not informed...

806
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:31,442
...that we have aliens
crawling all over my beloved state?

807
01:07:31,693 --> 01:07:34,821
Right now, 400 media vultures
are camped outside my office.

808
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:37,115
They know more about this than I do.

809
01:07:37,365 --> 01:07:40,451
I should throw the bunch of you
into prison.

810
01:07:40,702 --> 01:07:45,373
Not the cushy federal place with jumpsuits.
State prison, with crotch binders.

811
01:07:45,623 --> 01:07:50,378
I'm sorry, but there were earlier security
breaches by Dr. Kane and his team.

812
01:07:50,628 --> 01:07:52,964
Wait a minute. No, no. Excuse me.

813
01:07:53,214 --> 01:07:55,884
That's not exactly true, Gen. Woodman.

814
01:07:56,134 --> 01:07:58,720
I believe the Governor's question
was directed at me.

815
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,015
Put a plug in it!
I'm not interested in bureaucratic crapola.

816
01:08:02,265 --> 01:08:04,809
I want to know how bad this thing is.

817
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:07,312
It's bad, Governor.

818
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:11,816
According to the new ground sensors
and satellite thermal scans...

819
01:08:12,066 --> 01:08:15,153
...they indicate a potential problem.

820
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:17,572
I can't read this. What kind of problem?

821
01:08:17,822 --> 01:08:20,742
Someone take this bag of snakes
and lay them out straight.

822
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:21,993
Allow me.

823
01:08:22,243 --> 01:08:24,287
- And you are?
- Dr. Allison Reed.

824
01:08:24,537 --> 01:08:27,498
Carla? Would you mind?

825
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:34,130
The red markings indicate the growth
of the alien ecosystem.

826
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:40,511
Unless we act immediately,
we will lose Glen Canyon in three days.

827
01:08:40,762 --> 01:08:43,014
Great merciful Christ.

828
01:08:43,264 --> 01:08:45,683
In a week, the rest of Arizona.

829
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:48,853
Then, the entire southwest.

830
01:08:49,103 --> 01:08:53,358
In two months, the United States
officially belongs to them.

831
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:55,401
And we are extinct.

832
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:58,655
You must be shitting me!

833
01:09:03,076 --> 01:09:05,870
Admit it. You're glad to see us.

834
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,207
Yes, I am. Call the MP's.
Have them arrested.

835
01:09:09,457 --> 01:09:14,212
We just blew a giant alien bird out of
a store. We're covering up your mess.

836
01:09:14,462 --> 01:09:17,048
I'm Dr. Ira Kane,
chairman of the science department...

837
01:09:17,298 --> 01:09:20,385
...Glen Canyon Community College.
This is my associate.

838
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:24,639
Harry Block, adjunct professor of geology.
Voted for you.

839
01:09:24,889 --> 01:09:29,644
Wayne Gray.
I took some chemistry in high school.

840
01:09:31,187 --> 01:09:34,399
You two are the original discoverers
of the phenomena, correct?

841
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:38,319
Yes, and they're also responsible
for the mess we're in now.

842
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:39,571
Here we go.

843
01:09:39,821 --> 01:09:42,949
They broke into the contained area,
breaching security procedures.

844
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:46,911
Disseminating the alien organisms
outside the secured area.

845
01:09:47,161 --> 01:09:48,496
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

846
01:09:48,746 --> 01:09:50,415
Criminal charges are in order!

847
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:52,333
- This is bullshit!
- It is not!

848
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,127
Shut up all of you! Listen.

849
01:09:54,377 --> 01:09:56,588
My state is being overrun by aliens.

850
01:09:56,838 --> 01:10:00,925
Now you're supposed to be experts.
I want to know, and quick:

851
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:03,595
How will you deal with this?

852
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:09,100
This is an outline of the infected area
as of this afternoon.

853
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:14,105
My plan is to evacuate everyone
from within five miles of the perimeter.

854
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:16,441
You're talking about 10,000 people.

855
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:19,611
Yes, sir. We evacuate, make it safe...

856
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:22,780
...then burn the alien menace
the hell out of there.

857
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:25,283
With what?

858
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:29,120
With napalm. Lots and lots of napalm.

859
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:32,457
Napalm? Why don't you just nuke them?

860
01:10:32,707 --> 01:10:34,292
What about nukes?

861
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:37,545
Nobody's dropping an H-bomb on my state.

862
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:41,007
All this talk about napalm
and burning makes me nervous.

863
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:45,136
And we don't know how they'd react
to such an attack on a cellular level.

864
01:10:45,386 --> 01:10:49,182
Governor, it's time for a military solution.
This will work.

865
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:54,646
General? Sorry to interrupt.
You better take a look at this.

866
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:00,610
What?

867
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:02,445
You called me out for this?

868
01:11:02,695 --> 01:11:05,448
Sir, one of the creatures
just destroyed video four.

869
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:09,410
What's going on down there?

870
01:11:11,204 --> 01:11:15,917
My God. They've evolved into primates.

871
01:11:16,209 --> 01:11:19,921
That's a face for radio.

872
01:11:32,725 --> 01:11:34,978
They took out six and seven.

873
01:11:35,228 --> 01:11:36,980
All the monitors are down.

874
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,816
Well, that can't be good.

875
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:42,652
That's the elevator.

876
01:11:42,902 --> 01:11:44,988
We have no personnel down there.

877
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:47,240
They breached the air lock.

878
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,034
The fuzzy no-nose chimp?

879
01:11:50,285 --> 01:11:52,912
Call for backup.

880
01:11:53,746 --> 01:11:55,081
We need backup!

881
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:58,668
They're coming through the elevator!

882
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:00,837
They're coming through the elevator!

883
01:12:01,087 --> 01:12:03,423
- Cover the elevator!
- Give me a sidearm!

884
01:12:03,673 --> 01:12:05,925
Okay, just stay behind me!

885
01:12:06,175 --> 01:12:09,554
Get off me! I want to see!

886
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:16,936
Be prepared to fire.

887
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:34,162
It's empty, sir.

888
01:12:48,384 --> 01:12:50,470
The Governor! Don't shoot!

889
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,181
Help!

890
01:13:02,482 --> 01:13:03,733
Do something!

891
01:13:03,983 --> 01:13:08,154
Hold your fire. You'll get someone killed.

892
01:13:31,427 --> 01:13:32,845
Nice shot.

893
01:13:33,096 --> 01:13:36,057
I'll take that now.

894
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:43,940
You have my full support
to do whatever you need to do...

895
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,817
...however much firepower it takes.

896
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:49,696
Melt the place down to beaded glass,
if that's what it takes.

897
01:13:49,946 --> 01:13:52,031
Get these hellish creazoids
out of my state!

898
01:13:52,282 --> 01:13:55,118
Thank you, Governor.
I'll be ready to go by noon tomorrow.

899
01:13:55,368 --> 01:13:56,536
Good, sir.

900
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:59,330
- Where've you two been?
- Just getting out of the way...

901
01:13:59,581 --> 01:14:01,916
Get me out of here.

902
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:04,210
Science project is over.

903
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,547
I want you and your people gone.

904
01:14:07,797 --> 01:14:11,676
Soldier, escort these men out.

905
01:14:16,973 --> 01:14:19,726
Don't you have work to do?

906
01:14:19,976 --> 01:14:23,605
You are such an asshole.

907
01:14:26,482 --> 01:14:28,902
When a woman expresses anger,
it's often because...

908
01:14:29,152 --> 01:14:32,572
Shut up, Flemming.

909
01:14:32,822 --> 01:14:37,702
Okay. I know where the car is.

910
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:39,746
Wipe my ass, too.

911
01:14:39,996 --> 01:14:43,374
Hey, guys!

912
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,419
Got room for one more?

913
01:14:46,669 --> 01:14:48,421
Hell, yeah.

914
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:50,924
Who wants to be deputy director
of the CDC, anyway?

915
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:54,802
The real money's in the private sector.

916
01:14:54,928 --> 01:14:57,931
- Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.

917
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:00,225
Listen, it may not seem like much now...

918
01:15:00,475 --> 01:15:05,355
...but I got your research files
and original samples.

919
01:15:05,355 --> 01:15:06,773
So...

920
01:15:07,023 --> 01:15:11,611
...if we survive this,
you guys will get the credit.

921
01:15:14,364 --> 01:15:15,448
Thank you.

922
01:15:15,698 --> 01:15:17,450
- It's nothing.
- Let me get it.

923
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,537
No, I got it.

924
01:15:24,457 --> 01:15:25,833
Sorry. Excuse me.

925
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:28,878
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Wayne Gray.

926
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:30,880
I'm kind of with him.

927
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:34,342
That's cool.

928
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:36,594
Buckle up, Allison. We're rolling.

929
01:15:36,844 --> 01:15:39,639
Oh, my goodness!

930
01:15:42,392 --> 01:15:45,353
Facilities are being provided for you
and your families.

931
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:49,607
Please move in an orderly fashion.

932
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:00,910
They're going to blow up the whole town.

933
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,830
Hey! Hold on!

934
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,375
Where the hell you going?

935
01:16:23,266 --> 01:16:26,311
We need to clear this area, people.

936
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:31,774
For your own safety,
evacuate immediately.

937
01:16:46,331 --> 01:16:47,415
Professor Kane!

938
01:16:47,665 --> 01:16:50,793
Arizona! It's going down, baby!

939
01:16:51,044 --> 01:16:55,381
This may not be the best time
to be drinking.

940
01:17:01,304 --> 01:17:05,725
I was your first. We discovered you
in that cave. You were scared and alone.

941
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:07,560
It was just you, me and Harry.

942
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:10,230
Those were good times.

943
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,066
So, why not level with me now?

944
01:17:13,316 --> 01:17:16,444
You can trust me. Just talk to me.

945
01:17:16,694 --> 01:17:21,950
Tell me the secret. Tell me the answer.
Tell me how to kill you.

946
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,619
You are losing it, pal.

947
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:27,455
What is that stuff anyway?

948
01:17:27,705 --> 01:17:30,625
Some of the original liquid material
from inside the meteor.

949
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:35,964
- Why hasn't it evolved like the rest?
- I don't know. Maybe being refrigerated?

950
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:42,887
Being in an airtight case, nothing to
metabolise with. But we've still no clue...

951
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:47,058
When did you start smoking?

952
01:17:47,308 --> 01:17:51,229
Not much of a point
to clean living anymore.

953
01:18:16,087 --> 01:18:18,756
They react to fire like it was Miracle-Gro.

954
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:21,092
Fire.

955
01:18:21,342 --> 01:18:25,763
The organisms were dormant in space.
They hit Earth's atmosphere and bam!

956
01:18:26,014 --> 01:18:29,350
Heat. Fire. That's the catalyst.

957
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:32,937
So if a tiny match catalyses
this stuff like this...

958
01:18:33,187 --> 01:18:35,607
...what's a ton of napalm going to do?

959
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:39,485
So much for the military option.

960
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:47,911
Better call that dick general.

961
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:55,793
- That's a lot of napalm.
- Yes, it is.

962
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:59,464
We're going to blow those creatures
straight to hell.

963
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:03,343
We'll flush them out along the mine shafts
then mop up the edges as they...

964
01:19:03,593 --> 01:19:05,220
...run trying to escape the flames.

965
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:08,640
Excuse me, sir.
There's an urgent call from Dr. Reed.

966
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:11,559
She says she has important information
about the mission.

967
01:19:11,809 --> 01:19:16,981
Oh, really?
Well, unfortunately, I'm not available.

968
01:19:21,569 --> 01:19:23,154
Anything more?

969
01:19:23,404 --> 01:19:26,115
No, sir.

970
01:19:31,079 --> 01:19:33,414
He blew me off. Can you believe it?

971
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:37,835
- He wouldn't even take my call.
- You did call him an asshole.

972
01:19:38,086 --> 01:19:39,504
Dr. K!

973
01:19:39,754 --> 01:19:41,422
- We got beer!
- Time to party!

974
01:19:41,673 --> 01:19:44,342
- I'll take one of those.
- Me, too. I just quit smoking.

975
01:19:44,592 --> 01:19:46,344
What are you boys doing here?

976
01:19:46,594 --> 01:19:49,013
Thought you could use a brew
so you can mellow out.

977
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:51,474
Kick back and chill.

978
01:19:51,724 --> 01:19:54,185
Have a beer, relax.
It'll help with your research.

979
01:19:54,435 --> 01:19:57,188
Yeah, help with your research.

980
01:19:57,438 --> 01:20:00,108
Look at that thing.

981
01:20:00,358 --> 01:20:02,652
Can we have that
when you're done with it?

982
01:20:02,902 --> 01:20:06,364
Fellas, thanks for the beers,
but we're working.

983
01:20:06,614 --> 01:20:09,200
Hold it.

984
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:11,369
- Look.
- What are you doing?

985
01:20:11,619 --> 01:20:13,997
Selenium. It could be the answer.

986
01:20:14,247 --> 01:20:18,501
I'm looking at the periodic table
on your T-shirt. I'm seeing a pattern.

987
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,169
Take off your shirt.

988
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:21,462
Yes.

989
01:20:21,713 --> 01:20:23,715
- No.
- All right, look.

990
01:20:23,965 --> 01:20:26,301
We are a carbon-based life form.

991
01:20:26,551 --> 01:20:27,719
Keep pulling.

992
01:20:27,969 --> 01:20:31,556
We move down here
and you find our poison: Arsenic.

993
01:20:31,806 --> 01:20:34,225
But the aliens are nitrogen-based, right?

994
01:20:34,475 --> 01:20:35,685
You make the same move...

995
01:20:35,935 --> 01:20:41,316
...down and over,
and where do you find yourself?

996
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:43,359
Selenium.

997
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:46,070
It could be as lethal to them
as arsenic is to us.

998
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:50,742
With their metabolic rates,
it'll kill them fast.

999
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,206
Selenium. How much do we need?

1000
01:20:57,999 --> 01:21:00,668
Five hundred gallons should do it.

1001
01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:04,130
Five hundred gallons?

1002
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:07,926
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but where will we get that at 2:00 a.m.?

1003
01:21:08,176 --> 01:21:09,761
No problem.

1004
01:21:10,011 --> 01:21:13,056
We can get that.

1005
01:21:15,642 --> 01:21:17,101
Head & Shoulders.

1006
01:21:17,352 --> 01:21:18,603
The dandruff shampoo?

1007
01:21:18,853 --> 01:21:24,025
Yeah, that's the stuff.
The active ingredient is selenium sulphide.

1008
01:21:26,194 --> 01:21:28,446
How do you know that?
You don't know anything.

1009
01:21:28,696 --> 01:21:33,660
Haven't you noticed
how shiny and flake-free our hair is?

1010
01:21:36,538 --> 01:21:39,791
Okay, this is the best idea we got.

1011
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:42,752
Let's give it a shot. Come on.

1012
01:21:43,002 --> 01:21:45,630
We'll get the troops together.
We're getting shampoo!

1013
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,549
I have the perfect vehicle.

1014
01:21:47,799 --> 01:21:53,179
Good! Donalds, you just got your A's.

1015
01:22:01,145 --> 01:22:03,898
Almost full.

1016
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:12,156
There's something I should tell you,
but I don't know exactly how.

1017
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:18,454
Just say it. We're adults and we're
about to die a horrible death soon anyway.

1018
01:22:19,414 --> 01:22:23,293
I would have rocked your world.

1019
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:29,507
- You already have.
- All full.

1020
01:22:29,757 --> 01:22:33,469
Battle stations!

1021
01:22:35,263 --> 01:22:39,142
Can we continue this discussion later?

1022
01:22:39,517 --> 01:22:42,395
Let's do this!

1023
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:46,024
Let's shampoo us some aliens!

1024
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:07,754
Lots of soldiers around.

1025
01:23:12,425 --> 01:23:17,430
There's an old mine half a click south.
We can sneak into the cave through there.

1026
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,849
"Half a click"? What are you, in Vietnam?

1027
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:24,604
Hey, I'm digging this. Work with me.

1028
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:46,876
It's over here! It's right here!

1029
01:23:48,711 --> 01:23:52,131
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

1030
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,591
Let's go!

1031
01:23:53,841 --> 01:23:56,052
Let's do this.

1032
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:58,179
You sure this leads to the main cavern?

1033
01:23:58,429 --> 01:24:02,725
It'll lead somewhere.
Geology's not an exact science.

1034
01:24:04,686 --> 01:24:07,105
Where are you?

1035
01:24:07,355 --> 01:24:10,149
Where are you, my little aliens?

1036
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,444
Show yourself.

1037
01:24:22,287 --> 01:24:25,582
Warm to the touch.

1038
01:24:27,876 --> 01:24:29,460
Highly acidic.

1039
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:32,714
We've no time for you
to act like you know what you're doing.

1040
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:34,173
What happened to the respect?

1041
01:24:34,424 --> 01:24:38,511
Woodman's going at noon.
We have to hurry.

1042
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:43,474
- Good. Are the troops in place?
- Ahead of schedule.

1043
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:46,477
Excellent. We can go early.

1044
01:24:46,728 --> 01:24:51,107
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

1045
01:24:52,734 --> 01:24:54,068
Governor Lewis.

1046
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:57,197
I don't see anything burning.
Where are all the explosions?

1047
01:24:57,447 --> 01:25:00,742
We're just getting underway.
I didn't know you were coming to watch.

1048
01:25:00,992 --> 01:25:03,494
Well, better make it a good one, Sergeant.

1049
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:05,079
That's General.

1050
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:09,417
Not if you screw this up.
Keeping my chair warm for me?

1051
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:11,502
Thank you.

1052
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:14,297
I'll take a pair of spy glasses
and a hot chocolate.

1053
01:25:14,547 --> 01:25:16,341
Give me the hose.

1054
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:20,970
Get up top. When I give the signal,
start pumping the selenium.

1055
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:24,182
Got it.

1056
01:25:42,367 --> 01:25:44,953
We'll spray all around the meteor...

1057
01:25:45,203 --> 01:25:49,332
...then get out of here as fast as we can.

1058
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:54,671
Blue monkey!

1059
01:25:55,296 --> 01:25:59,175
Wayne, charge the line now!

1060
01:26:07,475 --> 01:26:09,143
That's the napalm!

1061
01:26:09,394 --> 01:26:12,438
Woodman went early.

1062
01:26:21,489 --> 01:26:23,491
Bad!

1063
01:26:23,741 --> 01:26:26,828
Wayne, come on!

1064
01:26:28,329 --> 01:26:31,207
I'm out.

1065
01:26:37,505 --> 01:26:40,800
We've got to go!

1066
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:47,056
Go! Faster! Get up there!

1067
01:26:47,765 --> 01:26:51,311
Run for your life!

1068
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,860
Quite a bonfire we've got.
Should have brought some wieners.

1069
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:00,445
That can be arranged.

1070
01:27:00,695 --> 01:27:05,575
- First reports are excellent, sir.
- Very good.

1071
01:27:07,118 --> 01:27:10,371
Keep it together, Wayne.

1072
01:27:10,705 --> 01:27:13,416
Oh, my God.

1073
01:27:19,797 --> 01:27:22,759
What's happening?

1074
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,262
- It's coming!
- What's coming?

1075
01:27:26,763 --> 01:27:29,265
Get the hell out of here!

1076
01:27:29,557 --> 01:27:34,145
- Great flaming whore balls!
- General, look!

1077
01:27:47,825 --> 01:27:49,410
Hurry!

1078
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:52,539
- Drive!
- Go!

1079
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:56,000
All right!

1080
01:28:46,718 --> 01:28:50,263
Fall back!

1081
01:28:53,766 --> 01:28:55,685
What the hell is that thing?

1082
01:28:55,935 --> 01:29:01,357
The napalm forced an evolutionary
response, like the match in the petri dish.

1083
01:29:01,608 --> 01:29:03,026
That's evolution?

1084
01:29:03,276 --> 01:29:07,614
Survival of the fittest. Often,
the simplest organism is the strongest.

1085
01:29:07,864 --> 01:29:09,699
Guys? It's freaking out!

1086
01:29:09,949 --> 01:29:14,037
It's starting to have
some sort of spaz attack.

1087
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:17,874
That's not spazzing out.

1088
01:29:18,124 --> 01:29:21,419
It's getting ready to divide.

1089
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:26,299
Mitosis.

1090
01:29:26,549 --> 01:29:29,719
Wait. There's going to be more
of these things?

1091
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:33,389
- A lot more.
- Its cycle is starting again.

1092
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:37,894
It will go on growing and doubling
until it takes over.

1093
01:29:38,144 --> 01:29:41,689
But we were here first.

1094
01:29:42,315 --> 01:29:47,570
So that Head & Shoulders idea.
Is that still the plan?

1095
01:29:50,323 --> 01:29:51,324
I'm driving.

1096
01:29:51,574 --> 01:29:55,245
So what if he's on "Air Force One"?
It has phones. I've seen them!

1097
01:29:55,495 --> 01:29:59,290
I don't think this can wait an hour.

1098
01:29:59,582 --> 01:30:03,545
What's that fire truck doing out there?

1099
01:30:18,393 --> 01:30:21,145
Mama.

1100
01:30:27,026 --> 01:30:28,778
Can you believe this?

1101
01:30:29,028 --> 01:30:33,157
We have to find a point of attack.

1102
01:30:36,536 --> 01:30:39,414
There!

1103
01:30:46,713 --> 01:30:48,131
Nasty!

1104
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:52,260
Allison, stop. Right here.

1105
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,805
Here we go!

1106
01:30:56,055 --> 01:30:59,267
Get the ladder up!

1107
01:30:59,309 --> 01:31:01,561
Feed me the hose, Deke.

1108
01:31:01,811 --> 01:31:04,147
- What are you doing?
- Going up top.

1109
01:31:04,397 --> 01:31:07,483
Not before me.
I got a major score to settle.

1110
01:31:07,734 --> 01:31:10,945
Go, go, go!

1111
01:31:25,585 --> 01:31:30,632
We don't have much time, guys! Hurry!

1112
01:31:34,928 --> 01:31:37,013
- Left!
- Left!

1113
01:31:37,263 --> 01:31:41,643
Got it.
I haven't had much practice with this.

1114
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:47,482
Stop!

1115
01:31:49,067 --> 01:31:51,903
- What's going on?
- I don't know, but it's getting bigger.

1116
01:31:52,153 --> 01:31:56,533
What are they doing with that ladder?

1117
01:31:56,699 --> 01:32:00,703
Looks like they're getting ready
to administer a jumbo enema.

1118
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:03,873
We got one shot. Let's do this.

1119
01:32:04,123 --> 01:32:08,336
It's payback time!

1120
01:32:11,631 --> 01:32:13,216
Keep it in there!

1121
01:32:13,466 --> 01:32:16,719
What's it look like I'm doing?

1122
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:20,348
It's working!

1123
01:32:24,727 --> 01:32:27,605
Shit!

1124
01:32:28,231 --> 01:32:29,399
What the hell?

1125
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:31,901
Oh, my God!

1126
01:32:32,151 --> 01:32:35,238
Give me back my friend, you big sphincter!

1127
01:32:35,488 --> 01:32:36,823
She's going to blow!

1128
01:32:37,073 --> 01:32:38,157
Stop kicking!

1129
01:32:38,408 --> 01:32:40,243
It's horrible in here!

1130
01:32:40,493 --> 01:32:43,079
- I got you!
- Help me!

1131
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:47,542
Hold me, Ira! Don't let me go!

1132
01:32:49,794 --> 01:32:52,547
We have to get out of here!
This thing's going to blow!

1133
01:32:52,797 --> 01:32:55,258
You cannot imagine what I saw in there!

1134
01:32:55,508 --> 01:32:56,801
Hurry up, guys!

1135
01:32:57,051 --> 01:33:01,472
Ira! Don't you ever tell anyone
where I've been!

1136
01:33:01,723 --> 01:33:04,350
Dear Lord.

1137
01:33:08,563 --> 01:33:11,774
Uh-oh. Time to go.

1138
01:33:12,984 --> 01:33:15,778
Go!

1139
01:33:37,717 --> 01:33:40,595
We did it!

1140
01:34:14,629 --> 01:34:19,634
Here we go, sir. Just relax
and we'll have you as good as new.

1141
01:34:19,884 --> 01:34:23,721
I am happy to report
that all remaining traces...

1142
01:34:23,972 --> 01:34:26,140
...of the alien menace
have been eradicated...

1143
01:34:26,391 --> 01:34:29,561
...using the selenium shampoo formula
developed right here.

1144
01:34:29,811 --> 01:34:33,982
Let me introduce our civilian scientist
heroes and their team...

1145
01:34:34,232 --> 01:34:40,446
...the best the great state of Arizona
has been privileged to produce.

1146
01:34:42,657 --> 01:34:48,246
So this is your moment. You wouldn't
want to miss this for anything.

1147
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:53,585
Firstly, I would like you all
to meet Wayne Gray.

1148
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:57,922
As of today, a fully credentialed fire-fighter.

1149
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:00,258
I spoke to the chief.

1150
01:35:00,508 --> 01:35:03,469
Thanks, Governor.

1151
01:35:05,513 --> 01:35:06,848
Now, our next hero...

1152
01:35:07,098 --> 01:35:09,976
...Professor Harry Block, noted geologist...

1153
01:35:10,226 --> 01:35:13,104
...and winningest coach
in north Arizona women's volleyball.

1154
01:35:13,354 --> 01:35:15,273
I appreciate that, Governor.

1155
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:18,610
First, I thank God.
With Him, all things are possible.

1156
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,530
We just played tough defence,
took it one alien at a time...

1157
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:26,409
...and came away with the big W.

1158
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:32,624
And finally...

1159
01:35:32,874 --> 01:35:35,627
...Doctors Ira Kane and Allison Reed...

1160
01:35:35,877 --> 01:35:41,633
...whose tireless efforts, research,
and academic findings led to the...

1161
01:35:41,883 --> 01:35:46,095
I think he's giving her
a bit of the Kane Madness.

1162
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:02,237
Fighting the alien menace
can be tough work.

1163
01:36:02,487 --> 01:36:05,198
So is keeping your hair clean,
shiny and dandruff-free.

1164
01:36:05,448 --> 01:36:08,535
So we always keep a healthy supply of...

1165
01:36:08,785 --> 01:36:12,497
...Head & Shoulders around the house.
