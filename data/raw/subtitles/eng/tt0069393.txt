1
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,519
Your Honor.

2
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:23,065
Gentlemen of the jury.

3
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:28,112
All of us in this country,
the South,

4
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,323
have been taught from birth
a few things

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,491
which we hold above all else.

6
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,413
Now one of the first
of these things

7
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:41,459
is that only a life could pay
for the life it takes.

8
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,581
Now I know there's not a man
on this jury

9
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,085
or a man in Mississippi
that in his heart

10
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,462
can find my client, Bookwright,

11
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,589
guilty for defending
his daughter

12
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:31,509
against a rascal like
Buck Thorpe.

13
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,264
And that's what
I'm talking about.

14
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:41,560
Not about the dead man,
character,

15
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:46,107
or the morality of the act
he was engaged in.

16
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,651
Not about self defense

17
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,404
or whether or not
the defendant was justified

18
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,865
to the point of taking a life.

19
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,285
But about all of us
who are not dead.

20
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,791
Human beings, who at the bottom,
just wanna do right.

21
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,171
Human beings,
with all the complexities

22
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,344
of human passion,
instincts, beliefs.

23
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,684
Thank you, gentlemen.

24
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,352
Thank You, Your Honor.

25
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,981
Court recessed
until jury returns!

26
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,736
Don't you agree,
he had the pistol in his hand

27
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,612
when they found him?

28
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,781
Buck Thorpe deserves
what he got.

29
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,618
I tell you, I wouldn't of waited
as long as Bookwright did.

30
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,871
He was not only no good,
but dangerous.

31
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,581
Right, right.

32
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,919
And if it hadn't
been Bookwright,

33
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,256
someone, sooner or later,
would have to kill him.

34
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,676
Yes.

35
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,553
Then what do you want?

36
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,555
What do you want?

37
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,185
I can't help it.

38
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,687
I ain't gonna vote
Bookwright free.

39
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,860
And so Jackson Fentry,
cotton farmer,

40
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,987
hung my jury-

41
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,781
Who was he?

42
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,451
I thought he'd farmed
one place all his life,

43
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,205
but I discovered
that 20 years ago,

44
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,999
he left for a job.

45
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,834
His neighbors told me.

46
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:35,216
You see, that was my first case

47
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,676
and I had to find out
why I'd lost it.

48
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,850
Good luck to you, Fentry.

49
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,815
If any of us had known
then what I know now,

50
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:54,693
Jackson Fentry never
would've been on that jury.

Hello.

75
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,737
Can I help you?

76
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,865
I'm looking for
Mr. Chester Russell.

77
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,618
Well, he's not here right now.

78
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,578
I'm his son, Isham.

79
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,500
Are you the man my father
hired as caretaker?

80
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,586
Yes, sir.

81
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,546
Come on then.

82
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,898
Last man we had
left a month ago.

83
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,443
Got too lonely for him.

84
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,904
He was drunk
half the time anyway.

85
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,915
This is the sawmill.

86
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,626
Men don't come out here
till spring.

87
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,089
Pa says you can stay on
in the boiler room.

88
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,132
He'll leave the mule
out here so you can get

89
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,386
to the store and back.

90
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,762
Next year, if you still
like it out here,

91
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,056
we'll talk about
building you a house.

92
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,937
There's a stove there
you can cook on.

93
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,024
There's a well
out there for water.

94
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,237
We'll get you some dishes.

95
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,492
If you need anything else,
you come to the house

96
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:51,036
and ask for me or Pa.

97
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,454
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:53,163
♪

99
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,058
Hey, merry Christmas, Fentry.

100
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,976
Merry Christmas, Isham.

101
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,106
Pa wanted to know
if you'd be going home

102
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,899
for Christmas.

103
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,903
I am, I'm leaving
as soon as I can make it there.

104
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,783
How far is your farm?

105
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,618
Thirty miles.

106
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,873
How you gonna get there?

107
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:04,002
I'll walk it,
I'll be home before supper time.

108
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,755
- You want some.
- Thank you.

109
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,763
When'll you be back?

110
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,890
Day after Christmas.

111
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:40,372
Don't you ever get lonesome
by yourself out here this way?

112
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,832
No.

113
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,595
You ever go huntin'?

114
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,096
I hunt some.

115
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,309
Maybe when you come back

116
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,853
we can go huntin'
together some time?

117
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,276
All right.

118
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,410
Agh...

119
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,992
Lady?

120
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,543
Oh, lady.

121
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,550
Lady?

122
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,398
Where am I at?

123
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,734
You're at Chester Russell
sawmill,

124
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,862
over in Frenchman's Bend.

125
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,823
I'm Jackson Fentry.

126
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,867
I'm the watchman out here
in the winter time

127
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,162
when the mill's shut down.

128
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,123
I heard you when I come out
the door of the boiler room.

129
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,294
You sounded to me
like you was in pain.

130
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,091
How long you been here?

131
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,011
I don't know.

132
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,222
I remember walking down
the hill back yonder--

133
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,520
I know I was feelin' dizzy.

134
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,066
I said to myself,
"I hope I ain't gonna faint."

135
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,193
But I guess I did.

136
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,239
What day is it?

137
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,076
It's the morning
before Christmas.

138
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,119
Then I haven't
been here too long.

139
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,834
It wasn't light yet when
I started out this way.

140
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,465
I think I better
be gettin' out of there.

141
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,300
Let me help you.

142
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,273
I'm sorry.

143
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,944
I guess I'll have to rest
a while longer.

144
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,281
I haven't quite
gotten my strength back yet.

145
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,952
Well, let me help you in here
so you can rest by my fire.

146
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,496
It's so raw and cold out here.

147
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,957
Thank you.

148
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,002
It has been a cold winter,
hasn't it?

149
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,129
Yes.

150
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:07,139
There was ice this morning
early when I left the house.

151
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:12,060
I seen it out
in the ditches as I passed.

152
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,395
Yes.

153
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:22,195
I said to myself,
"Jack Frost has been here."

154
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,197
He sure has.

155
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,327
Can you make it?

156
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,372
Yes, sir, I can make it.

157
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,217
You can sit here, misses.

158
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,388
Thank you.

159
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,560
It is nice and warm in here.

160
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,065
I love a good fire on the stove.

161
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,115
I could get it warmer.

162
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,242
I'm letting it die out
'cause I'm about to leave

163
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:13,246
for my papa's farm
for Christmas.

164
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,707
Well, don't go
to no trouble for me.

165
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,923
I can stay
for more than a minute?

166
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,133
Just to get my strength back

167
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,637
and to get some of the coldness
out of my bones.

168
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:48,073
Can I get you anything to eat?

169
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,200
No, thank you.

170
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,674
You'd think I'd be hungry,
wouldn't you?

171
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:11,471
Carrying a baby and all,
but I don't have no appetite.

172
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:17,018
You live here all by yourself?

173
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,980
Yes.

174
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,566
Mr. Chester Russell's gonna
build me a house

175
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,068
next spring to live in,
but he told me

176
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:29,030
to stay on out here
for the time being.

177
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,701
Warm and dry,
that does it for me.

178
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,460
Have you been here long?

179
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,213
No.

180
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,508
I was raised 30 miles from here
on a cotton farm.

181
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,012
I work with my daddy.

182
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,389
My mom's dead.

183
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,642
My daddy's on the farm,
all alone now.

184
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,274
You from around here?

185
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,655
Sort of.

186
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,658
Off and on, that is.

187
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,119
My husband never cared much
for this county

188
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:20,123
and he's always trying to find
work away from here,

189
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:26,838
but we always had to come back.

190
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,218
You're on your way home now?

191
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,346
No, no, sir.

192
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,101
Was you going to the store
at Frenchman's Bend?

193
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,550
If you was, you sit right here.

194
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,313
I'll go get whatever
it was you wanted.

195
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,817
Oh, no, no, sir,
I wasn't going to no store.

196
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,238
You goin' in to Jefferson?

197
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,824
No.

198
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,494
No, sir, I wasn't
goin' no place.

199
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,416
I was just goin'.

200
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,712
Just goin'.

201
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,722
Is your husband dead?

202
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,478
No, sir.

203
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,814
He just disappeared
about three months ago

204
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,942
when he first heard
about the baby comin'.

205
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,659
Don't you have any people?

206
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,249
Got Papa.

207
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,168
Three brothers.

208
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,838
Can't you go home to them?

209
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,799
No, sir, they asked me to leave
and never come back

210
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,218
after I married my husband.

211
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,724
I don't intend ever
to go back again.

212
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,519
My papa, he's got his pride.

213
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,980
I got mine, too.

214
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,788
I don't care a whole lot
for the winter time, do you?

215
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,623
No, Ma'am.

216
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,669
I always get sick
every winter time

217
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:33,339
it seems like to me.

218
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,383
A woman came over
to where I was staying.

219
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:39,262
She said, "You look poorly,
you ought to get a doctor."

220
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,847
I said, "There ain't
nothin' wrong with me

221
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,309
that sunshine
couldn't fix," I said.

222
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,443
You want me to put
some more wood on the fire?

223
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,570
No, it's just fine.

224
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,407
I love sunshine.

225
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,704
When I started out this mornin',
I said, "I'm goin',

226
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,664
if my strength holds up,

227
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,958
till I come to where it's warm,

228
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,002
when the sun is shinin'."

229
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,966
The strength didn't hold out
very long.

230
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,765
Listen to that wind.

231
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,895
I love to hear it
when I'm inside and warm.

232
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:36,486
That wind was cold though.

233
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,781
Walkin' right into it
the way I had to.

234
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,879
Lord, what's the matter with me?

235
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,551
Would you look at me tremble.

236
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,429
The thought of that wind and
I begin to shake and tremble.

237
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:11,604
Why don't you rest
over here on the bed?

238
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,731
Now, you can't
rest good like that.

239
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,694
Oh no -- no, I can't stay.

240
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,373
Just for a minute.

241
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,594
Well, all right then.

242
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,679
Just for a minute.

243
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,534
This does feel good, Mr.--

244
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,079
Fentry, Jackson Fentry,
and you're Mrs.--

245
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:13,124
Eubanks, Sarah Eubanks.

246
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,544
I was at fault
that I married a Eubanks.

247
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:24,010
If I have a girl...

248
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:29,891
I'm gonna name her Vesta,
after my mama

249
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,604
and if I have a boy,
I wanted him named--

250
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,859
Well, I don't know now.

251
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,945
I was gonna name him
after my husband,

252
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:47,575
but I don't know now.

253
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:56,584
Listen to that wind
whippin' around outside again.

254
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:01,714
Sounds right friendly, don't it?

255
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,884
On the inside and warm this way.

256
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,512
You're listenin' to it?

257
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,850
When I was a little girl,
at ten, my mama died.

258
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,572
They say I got everything
mixed up that year

259
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,774
'cause I grieved so.

260
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,027
I'd wake all winter long.

261
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,876
When the wind would blow
around the house,

262
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,115
I'd think it was
my mama callin'.

263
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,662
And I'd answer
and call back to her.

264
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,667
I'd ask her where
she was hidin'.

265
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,924
I never grieved no more
after that.

266
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,805
When I got over that, I vowed
nothin' would break my heart

267
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,807
ever again.

268
00:23:55,184 --> 00:24:02,191
And it didn't for the longest
kind of time.

269
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,668
0oo.

270
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,560
Oh, hello, Fentry.

271
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,521
Hello.

272
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,273
I thought you were going
to your farm for Christmas.

273
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:28,528
- I changed my mind.
- Well, where are you goin'?

274
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,988
No place.

275
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,990
How much is that hard candy?

276
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,868
Well, it depends on how much
you want to buy?

277
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,623
How much will four cents get me?

278
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,260
I'd say this would do it.

279
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,303
Give me four cents worth.

280
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,692
Thank you.

281
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,110
Merry Christmas.

282
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,544
Mister?

283
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:30,089
Yes?

284
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,593
How long I been asleep?

285
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:36,637
About ten hours.

286
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,848
Ten hours?

287
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,725
Yes.

288
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,102
Why didn't you wake me?

289
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:49,192
I figured the sleep
would be good for you.

290
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,402
My heavens.

291
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,829
It's still cold out yonder?

292
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,831
Yes, it is.

293
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:22,725
Why don't you stay on here
the rest of the night?

294
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,685
Well--

295
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:29,106
I could make me a pallet
on the floor, here, by the fire.

296
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,904
Well, thank you.

297
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,782
I wouldn't want
to put you out any.

298
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,201
You wouldn't be puttin' me out.

299
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,340
I went to the store,
I bought you this.

300
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,884
I thought you might like it.

301
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,810
I sure do, thank you.

302
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,236
It's hard candy.

303
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:21,033
Well, I declare.

304
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,953
Merry Christmas.

305
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,247
Thank you.

306
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,375
And a merry Christmas
to you, too.

307
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,339
If I fixed you something
to eat now, would you eat it?

308
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:39,093
No, I'm still not hungry.

309
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,971
I just have a taste
of my Christmas--

310
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,271
What are you cryin' for, lady?

311
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,899
I don't know.

312
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,902
I'm just tired
and nervous, I guess.

313
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,532
I've been cryin' a lot lately,
it don't mean nothin'.

314
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,910
I quit as soon as I stop.

315
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:11,375
But see, I never
used to cry before.

316
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,384
When I was a girl,
everybody used to accuse me

317
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:17,840
of being hard hearted because
nothing could get me to cry.

318
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,345
My papa told me I had to leave
home after I married my husband.

319
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,972
I didn't shed a tear, I just
said, "That's how it has to be,

320
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:28,017
that's how it has to be."

321
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,978
But lately, that's all changed.

322
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,521
Somebody'd come up to me
and they'd say, "Good morning,"

323
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,191
or "Good evening," and I'll cry.

324
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:38,361
They'll ask me what time
it is and I'll cry.

325
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,616
Did you ever hear
of anything like that?

326
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,372
I didn't used to
talk this way either.

327
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,292
I used to be able
to go a whole day

328
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:57,171
without saying a word.

329
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,383
Now I can't stand
if it's silent or quiet.

330
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,178
Oh, this is so good.

331
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:07,139
Will you have some?

332
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,058
No, thank you.

333
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,233
It's gonna be a clear night?

334
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,567
Yes.

335
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:27,284
Stars?

336
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,078
Yes.

337
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,256
Why don't you stay on out here

338
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,968
till after your baby is born?

339
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,221
I have enough to eat
for the both.

340
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,473
Warm and dry here.

341
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,561
Oh, Mr. Fentry, I don't think--

342
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,605
You don't have to answer me now.

343
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,691
You just think it over.

344
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,740
Yes, sir.

345
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,682
Mr. Fentry?

346
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:41,543
♪

347
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,482
Good morning.

348
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,276
Morning.

349
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,700
How are you feelin'?

350
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,412
Better, thank you.

351
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:44,166
- It's still Christmas, ain't it?
- Yes, ma'am.

352
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:48,128
Well, I hope I hadn't slept
clear through Christmas.

353
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:51,674
It's a pretty day for Christmas.

354
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:57,721
I'm feelin' stronger.

355
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,188
Now, let me finish doin' that.

356
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,649
No, ma'am, you rest on today.

357
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,652
You can do it tomorrow.

358
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:15,841
Ain't you hungry?

359
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,468
No.

360
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,471
Not too hungry.

361
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:27,436
I bet you will be, though,
once you're rested.

362
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:04,658
It's rained every blessed day
for a month.

363
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,002
When I was a girl,

364
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,381
I had my own tub
to catch rainwater.

365
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:28,515
I liked to wash my hair
with rainwater.

366
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,810
It made it soft.

367
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,197
Can you swim?

368
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,453
- No.
- I can't either.

369
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,333
Good thing we don't live
on the Delta.

370
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,981
We'd have to get
on top of this house

371
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:59,755
and float away,
in case it flooded.

372
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:06,470
Well, I don't think I care
to travel by water.

373
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,055
I think I'd always want to be
where I can feel

374
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,558
the ground under my feet.

375
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,894
Jesus walked on water, they say.

376
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,854
Do you believe that?

377
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,774
I knew a preacher once,
he swore it was true,

378
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,360
and he said he's
gonna do it, too.

379
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:25,489
A whole crowd of folks
went down to watch him.

380
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,200
And he sank to the bottom.

381
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:33,372
They say God's going to destroy
the world next time by fire,

382
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,998
so I guess
we don't have to worry

383
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:39,086
about this rain bein'
the end of the world.

384
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,798
I used to not sleep some nights
just worrying about what I'd do

385
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,466
when the world would come
to an end,

386
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,844
and what it would be like.

387
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:52,140
I don't worry about that
no more.

388
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,447
You're not gettin' cold,
are you?

389
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:09,491
Oh, no.

390
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,119
It's much warmer today.

391
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,998
It'll be spring
before we know it.

392
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:26,425
I'll have had my baby by then.

393
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:31,680
I wonder where I'll be
after it's spring.

394
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:36,893
I wonder if it's gonna be
a boy or a girl.

395
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,733
Marry me, Sarah.

396
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,849
Well, I can't marry you,
Mr. Fentry.

397
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:19,478
I've got a husband.

398
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,148
It's against the law
to marry into...

399
00:41:46,922 --> 00:41:49,966
You're gonna stay on here?

400
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:54,221
I hope to.

401
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:58,100
Mr. Russell said he's gonna
build me a house.

402
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,810
When you're strong,

403
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,938
I'll show you the place
I've got picked out.

404
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,107
Is it far from here?

405
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:07,651
No.

406
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:16,743
I'd like to go and see it.

407
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,416
Oh.

408
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:10,964
What a pretty place for a house.

409
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,842
Did you ever build
a house before?

410
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,594
No.

411
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,597
Well, how are you
gonna build this one?

412
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:23,935
Mr. Russell and his
boy'll help me.

413
00:43:24,144 --> 00:43:27,022
There's a house in Jefferson
we used to pass

414
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,860
goin' into town every Saturday.

415
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,987
I used to like to think
I'd like to live

416
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:36,323
in a house like that, someday.

417
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,909
What kind of house was it?

418
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:41,745
Oh, it was a fine house.

419
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,705
It was painted white.

420
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:47,250
It had a gallery all along
the front and the side.

421
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:50,295
There were oak trees
in the yard.

422
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:55,091
It always looked so peaceful
when we passed by.

423
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,969
I never saw nobody
goin' in or out.

424
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,263
I asked my papa, "What kind
of people live in there?"

425
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:04,017
"No better than you," he said,
and he hit me.

426
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,775
I never knew why he hit me.

427
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,280
It would be nice
when you have your house

428
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,951
if you had some of them trees
in your yard.

429
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,287
Papa didn't have any trees
in our yard.

430
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,207
There's no trees, no flowers,

431
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,960
there's no grass.

432
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,254
There's nothin'.

433
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,214
I love grass,

434
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,300
and flowers, and trees!

435
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:42,222
I love honey suckle
and forget-me-not,

436
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:47,727
and roses, all kinds of roses.

437
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:51,690
One day we can ride
into Jefferson

438
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,276
and see that house.

439
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,070
Maybe.

440
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:30,228
I hate to see the sun
go behind the clouds.

441
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,171
Better be gettin' back.

442
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:12,687
♪

443
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,045
I was on my way to the store,
and Mr. Kent Russell asked me

444
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,048
to do a favor for him
while I was that way.

445
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:05,425
The fellow I had to see
wasn't home,

446
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,927
so I had to wait for him.

447
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:11,973
That's how come I took so long.

448
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:13,933
You'd better get on back
in the house,

449
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,228
it's cold out today.

450
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:47,342
Are you warmer in here?

451
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,011
Yes, sir.

452
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,478
I don't think this winter's
ever gonna end, do you?

453
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,649
Yes, ma'am, it'll end one day.

454
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,567
I hope I didn't cause you
to worry.

455
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:08,613
Oh, I'll find a way to worry,
I guess.

456
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,075
There's nothin' you can do
about that.

457
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,620
I didn't know
why you were gone so long.

458
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:19,249
"How far is that store?" I said.

459
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,127
I thought, "He's just tired
of me bein' out here.

460
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:26,005
Maybe I'm too much trouble--
I'm down one day

461
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,591
and I'm up the next.

462
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,388
But that's not like Mr. Fentry,"
I said.

463
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:42,355
Then I thought,
"Well, what if my time comes

464
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,566
and he ain't here yet?"

465
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:48,027
I began to wonder what I'd do

466
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:52,574
if I had to have a baby out here
all by myself.

467
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:54,325
You left me
plenty of stove wood,

468
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:57,787
I saw that right away.

469
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,747
I didn't really think
that you'd gone off,

470
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,750
it's just that it got
so quiet here,

471
00:50:02,959 --> 00:50:05,545
and I...

472
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:16,139
Marry me, Sarah.

473
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:25,440
I can't marry you,
I told you that.

474
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,734
I've got a husband somewhere.

475
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,777
He's deserted you.

476
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,405
I can't help that.

477
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,158
We're married in sight
of the law.

478
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,619
Hey, Fentry.

479
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:45,501
I'm sorry, Fentry,
I didn't know you had company.

480
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,727
Who's that?

481
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,355
She's my wife.

482
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:06,963
Since when--
You didn't have no wife

483
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,383
when I was out here
Christmas Eve--

484
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,360
She's my wife.

485
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,737
You want us to leave?

486
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,448
What do I want you to leave for?

487
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:17,075
I don't care
what you do out here.

488
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,785
You can have 20 wives out here
for all I care.

489
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,433
I didn't come out here
to spy on you,

490
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,372
I just came to get you
to go huntin'.

491
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,374
Some other time.

492
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,709
All right.

493
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,547
Pa wanted me to ask you
to pick out the site

494
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,466
where you want your house.

495
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,219
You and me can get started
on it this spring.

496
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:40,139
I know where I want it to be.

497
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:41,557
Why don't you show me
while I'm out here,

498
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,326
and if we have a warm day
any time soon,

499
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,645
I can get Papa to come out
and look it over.

500
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,398

It's time.

520
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:20,466
- You'd better get Mrs. Hulie.
- I will.

521
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,718
Will you do a favor for me,
Isham?

522
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,767
Will you ride over
to Mrs. Hulie, the mid-wife,

523
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,487
and tell her to come out here
right away?

524
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,808
I'd be glad to.

525
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,275
I got Isham to go for me.

526
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,360
Who's he?

527
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:40,403
The fellow that came up
just now.

528
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,989
His pa owns the saw mill.

529
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:46,367
Was he surprised to see me here?

530
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,744
I reckon.

531
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:51,497
Did he ask who I was?

532
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:52,915
Yes.

533
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,751
What did you tell him?

534
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,963
I said you was my wife.

535
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,852
Are you cold again?

536
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,437
Yes.

537
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,689
All of a sudden.

538
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:18,399
Is there some wood in the fire?

539
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:19,901
Yes, there is.

540
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:21,736
You want me to put some more in?

541
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,488
If you don't mind.

542
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,293
It's red-hot now.

543
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,172
It'll have the room like an oven
before too long.

544
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:47,345
Did you show him
where you wanted your house?

545
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,972
Yeah.

546
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:52,391
Did he think
it was a nice place?

547
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,685
Yes.

548
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,989
I'm afraid.

549
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,659
What of?

550
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,994
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

551
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:14,538
From childbirth--
You won't die from that.

552
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,999
You'll get up from here
feelin' just fine.

553
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,627
Now, lots of women done that.

554
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:22,713
I'm not afraid of childbirth.

555
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,590
Of what then?

556
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,384
I don't know.

557
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,928
I'm tired and I'm worn out.

558
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:30,763
My spirits are low.

559
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:32,932
Now, you'll feel better
afterwards, you'll see.

560
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,435
Carrying the baby
has worn you out.

561
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,646
Fentry.

562
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:39,939
Oh, Fentry.

563
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,649
Fentry, I ain't had much
in this life,

564
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:46,529
and that's truth--
Work, and hunger, and pain.

565
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,656
I'm afraid.

566
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,617
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

567
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:54,787
I don't wanna die.

568
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,374
Now, you're not gonna die.

569
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,168
Do you hear me--
You're not gonna die.

570
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:04,964
I won't let you,
now I promise you.

571
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,057
Are you warmer now?

572
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,475
Yes.

573
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:19,895
Thank you.

574
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:24,191
Now you try and get some sleep
until Mrs. Hulie gets here.

575
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,865
All right.

576
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,971
Don't leave me.

577
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,890
I won't.

578
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,100
I ain't gonna never leave you,

579
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:01,729
unless you ask me to.

580
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,315
Never, never, never.

581
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,746
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

582
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:22,833
Mrs. Hulie?

583
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:26,837
Mrs. Hulie?

584
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:29,256
Mrs. Hulie?

585
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,345
Mrs. Hulie, there's a woman
over at the saw mill

586
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:33,719
about to have a baby,
can you come with me?

587
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,305
I'll be right there.

588
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,874
That be Isham's buggy.

589
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,835
Whoa, whoa.

590
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,169
Tell them to hurry.

591
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:09,296
I will.

592
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,984
Sarah, Mrs. Hulie's here.

593
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,736
Howdy, Missus.

594
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,956
How is she?

595
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:29,168
She's gonna be all right.

596
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,148
Fentry--
Fentry?

597
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:57,238
You need me for
anything else, now?

598
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:00,282
No, thank you.

599
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:07,331
Well, I'll be goin' on then.

600
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,127
Mrs. Hulie!

601
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,879
Mrs. Hulie!

602
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:02,386
Mrs. Hulie!

603
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:05,389
Mrs. Hulie!

604
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,856
Mrs. Hulie!

605
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,083
The baby's come.

606
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,085
It's a fine boy.

607
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,962
Thank you.

608
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:22,883
I made this for him to sleep in.

609
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,970
Fentry?

610
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,972
Yes?

611
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,851
Fentry?

612
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,228
Yes?

613
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,522
Um...

614
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,236
I'm worried about the mama.

615
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:46,031
She ain't doin' too well.

616
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,284
I ain't gon' lie to ya.

617
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:53,997
She ain't doin' good at all.

618
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:57,167
She says she's afraid
she's gonna die.

619
01:03:57,376 --> 01:04:02,172
She'll never get up
off that bed in there.

620
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:04,508
I hate to tell you this,

621
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:08,220
but I don't think
she will either.

622
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:11,348
What is it--
Was it havin' the baby?

623
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:17,438
No, she was sick
long before she had the baby.

624
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:21,316
She's just played out,
it seems to me.

625
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,444
Yes, ma'am.

626
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:25,279
I'll take care of her.

627
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,197
I'll make her rest.

628
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:30,534
And I'll nurse her.

629
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:06,528
Ain't it small?

630
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:09,781
Yes, it is.

631
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:20,542
Hello, son.

632
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:23,545
Welcome.

633
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:31,178
- Can I get you something to eat?
- No.

634
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,306
Now, you gotta eat--
You gotta keep your strength up.

635
01:05:34,515 --> 01:05:37,643
I'm not hungry.

636
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,354
Can I hold the baby?

637
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:43,273
Sure.

638
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:19,226
Fentry?

639
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,311
Yes.

640
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,274
If anything happens to me...

641
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:29,278
will you promise
to take care of the baby?

642
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,698
Ain't nothin'
gonna happen to you.

643
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,326
If it does.

644
01:06:36,535 --> 01:06:37,703
Then you can rest easy.

645
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:42,040
I'll always take care of him.

646
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:45,627
The same as if it was yours?

647
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:49,298
The same as if it was mine.

648
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:53,218
Thank you.

649
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:55,220
Fentry?

650
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:58,140
Yes.

651
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:01,727
If you still want to marry me...

652
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:09,359
I'm willin' now.

653
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:16,074
My husband might be dead,
for all I know.

654
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,285
And even if he's not,
he's gone so far away,

655
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,830
I'll never find him again.

656
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:27,419
So I thought, "Why can't Fentry
and I get married right now?

657
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:35,469
If he still wants to marry me."

658
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,724
I want to marry you.

659
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,144
Can you get anybody
to marry us right away?

660
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:45,812
Yes.

661
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:50,233
Preacher Whitehead, he lives
about seven miles from here.

662
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,361
Would you go get him now?

663
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:56,531
Yes, I will.

664
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:00,160
How far does he live?

665
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:02,954
About seven miles.

666
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,751
Thank you.

667
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:12,631
Will ya hurry?

668
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:52,546
You know, I've placed you.

669
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:55,173
Weren't you a Thorpe?

670
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:57,342
Didn't you live with your papa
and three brothers

671
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,761
on a farm back yonder?

672
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:04,766
Don't you think
they should be sent for

673
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,769
at a time like this?

674
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:11,481
I don't want them to know
anything about me.

675
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:18,196
I've split some of these
flour sacs in two for ya.

676
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:20,240
When Mr. Fentry comes
back I'll show him how

677
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,451
that can be used for diapers.

678
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,286
Thank ya.

679
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,307
Have you picked a name
for your baby?

680
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,559
No.

681
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:51,438
I thought I'd let
my husband name him.

682
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,315
Your husband?

683
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:55,692
Mr. Fentry.

684
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,195
We're gonna be married.

685
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:02,824
He's gone now
to get the preacher.

686
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:07,621
That's nice.

687
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:11,917
Here, let me take the baby.

688
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,836
You try and get some sleep.

689
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:16,713
Thank you.

690
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,835
Sarah.

691
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:01,883
I have the preacher here.

692
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,677
All right.

693
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:04,928
Howdy, preacher.

694
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,389
Hello, Mrs. Hulie.

695
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,855
Hello, miss.

696
01:11:15,063 --> 01:11:18,525
Hello, preacher.

697
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:19,818
Preacher.

698
01:11:42,424 --> 01:11:44,301
Dearly beloved,

699
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:45,844
we are gathered here together

700
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,847
in the sight of God.

701
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:52,058
Jackson Fentry,
do you take this woman

702
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:55,562
to be your lawful wedded wife?

703
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,606
Yes, sir.

704
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:01,359
Miss, uh...

705
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,778
Sarah Eubanks.

706
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,780
Sarah Eubanks,
do you take this man

707
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,784
to be your
lawful wedded husband?

708
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,496
I do.

709
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:18,126
Then I pronounce you
man and wife.

710
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,942
How's the fire, Fentry?

711
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,111
Are you cold?

712
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,489
I'm so cold.

713
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,704
I don't dare put
no more wood in it.

714
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,707
It's red hot now.

715
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:11,429
While you were gone
I had a terrible dream

716
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:15,934
that I was freezing to death.

717
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,435
In my dream I kept saying,

718
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:21,982
"I'm drowning in the cold...

719
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:25,819
drowning in the snow."

720
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:29,280
I was calling for you
to save me.

721
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:34,953
And I didn't save you?

722
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,913
I don't know.

723
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:42,127
I woke up when
I was calling ya...

724
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,588
and there you were

725
01:13:45,797 --> 01:13:48,008
standing right by me.

726
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,098
When I brought the preacher here

727
01:13:55,306 --> 01:14:00,812
I passed by the place where
our house is gonna be.

728
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:02,621
I don't reckon I can
build as fine as one

729
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,525
you've seen in Jefferson,

730
01:14:05,734 --> 01:14:08,737
but ours is gonna
have three rooms

731
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:12,615
and a little porch
for us to sit on.

732
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:16,578
It has some pretty trees
all around it like you want.

733
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:20,999
Hackberry tree and a Chinaberry,

734
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,585
and there'd be some
flowers in the yard

735
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,920
if you want them.

736
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,136
Will you get me the baby?

737
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:37,682
Yes, ma'am.

741
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,975

here for you.

744
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,823
Preacher Whitehead.

745
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:52,841
She's dead, Fentry.

746
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,218
No, she's not gonna die,
she's gonna be all right

747

'cause I'm gonna save her.

748
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:00,807
You can't save her, she's dead.

749

I don't know why
we met when we did.

750
01:16:55,945 --> 01:17:00,742
Or why I found you when
you was all wore out.

751

I couldn't save you
no matter how bad

752

I wanted to.

753
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,669
I don't why you want me
to raise this baby

754
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:15,673

But I don't care,
I promised ya I'd raise him.

01:33:33,567 --> 01:33:34,860
He's my boy.

902
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,612
Well, he's our sister's boy.

903
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:37,988
Daddy give him to us.

904
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:40,866
He our kin, he belong to us.

905
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:42,242
No!

906
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:45,245
You run, boy,
run to be with your grandpap.

907
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:07,851
No!

908
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,645
Stop!

909
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:10,395
Run, boy!

910
01:34:10,604 --> 01:34:11,647
Run, b0!!!

911
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:13,732
Billy, grab that boy!

912
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:18,904
Don't let that boy get away!

913
01:34:19,112 --> 01:34:20,113
Daddy!

914
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:22,366
Jackson and Longstreet!

915
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:23,951
Jackson and Longstreet!

916
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,453
Jackson and Longstreet!

917
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,956
Fentry, Fentry, stop it!

918
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:30,332
Now, there ain't
nothin' you can do.

919
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:32,626
For now they got the law
on their side.

920
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:35,337
Daddy!

921
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:36,755
Daddy!

922
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:41,969
I want daddy.

923
01:34:49,393 --> 01:34:51,395
No, no!

924
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,397
I wanna stay.

925
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,805
They can take the boy, Fentry.

926
01:34:54,982 --> 01:34:56,108
It's the law.

927
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:58,277
Her husband, he's still alive

928
01:34:58,485 --> 01:35:01,738
and he gave the boy to them.

929
01:35:01,947 --> 01:35:03,115
I didn't want to bring
them here, Fentry,

930
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,325
but the sheriff said if I didn't

931
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:07,828
he'd find you.

932
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:11,790
I know, I've been expectin' it.

933
01:35:11,999 --> 01:35:14,918
I reckon that's why

934
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:17,838
it took me so by surprise.

935
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:21,842
I'm all right now.

936
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:43,989
We're sorry for it.

937
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,287
But he's our kin.

938
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:52,831
We want him home.

939
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:03,383
Here.

940
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:06,178
Here's some money
for your trouble.

941
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:44,049
They're gone.

942
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:02,484
The sheriff, he came with them
to the saw mill, Fentry.

943
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:06,530
He had a paper.

944
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,379
Look, Fentry,
there's two sides to the law.

945
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,578
We'll go into town,
seek Colonel Douglas.

946
01:37:13,787 --> 01:37:15,330
My pa knows him.

947
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:16,957
Look, Fentry, I'll go will ya.

948
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:19,960
I'll ask him to take care
of it for you.

949
01:37:39,146 --> 01:37:41,273
Fentry!

950
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:49,489
My search was almost over

951
01:37:49,698 --> 01:37:52,117
when I find out they
took the boy,

952
01:37:52,325 --> 01:37:53,326
left the county with him,

953
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:55,704
and raised him as a Thorpe.

954
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,374
And it seemed to me,

955
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:02,169
as if I'd never known before,

956
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:05,922
that this world isn't run

957
01:38:06,131 --> 01:38:08,049
like it ought to be run.

958
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:15,015
Fentry didn't hear
anymore of the boy

959
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:18,143
and as far as I could learn

960
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:22,272
he never mentioned
his name again.

961
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:25,108
Fentry's father died

962
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:28,612
and he worked the place alone.

963
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:31,031
And then one day

964
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:33,366
a young man named Buck Thorpe

965
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:38,205
appeared in Frenchman's Bend.

966
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,081
When Thorpe tried to run away

967
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:43,043
with H.T. Bookwright's daughter.

968
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:48,590
Bookwright warned him
that he would protect her.

969
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,176
And he solved that problem

970
01:38:51,384 --> 01:38:55,055
in the best of his
abilities and beliefs

971
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:58,558
asking the help of no man,

972
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:02,646
and then abode by his decision.

973
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:07,108
Buck Thorpe had been
in a lot of trouble.

974
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:08,677
There was talk
of his killin' a man

975
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:10,695
himself in Memphis.

976
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:15,158
We know he was a brawler.

977
01:39:17,577 --> 01:39:21,331
He was a drinker
and a cattle thief.

978
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:29,464
Buck Thorpe deserved
what he got.

979
01:39:29,673 --> 01:39:31,508
I would've shot him
if it had been my kid.

980
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:32,634
I tell ya,
I wouldn't have waited

981
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:34,135
as long as Bookwright did.

982
01:39:34,344 --> 01:39:36,680
He was not only no good,
but dangerous.

983
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:39,015
Yes, sir.

984
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:41,226
Then what do you want?

985
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:42,978
What do you want?

986
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,399
I can't help it.

987
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:50,527
I ain't gonna vote
Bookwright free.

988
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:54,447
I declare a mistrial.

989
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:10,005
Of course Fentry wasn't
gonna vote Bookwright free

990
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:14,050
because somewhere
in Buck Thorpe the adult,

991
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:17,012
the man that Bookwright slew,

992
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,015
there still remained
at least a memory

993
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:21,016
of that little boy,

994
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:24,519
that Jackson and Longstreet.

995
01:40:28,732 --> 01:40:31,276
I could have never have guessed.

996
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:37,032
Fentry's capacity for love.

997
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,035
I suppose I had figured that
comin' from where he came from

998
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:43,747
that even the comprehension
of love had been

999
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:47,500
lost out of him
back down the generations

1000
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:51,212
where the first Fentry had
to take his final choice

1001
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:55,300
between the pursuit of love

1002
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:58,803
and the pursuit
of keepin' on breathin'.

1003
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:05,727
The lowly and the invincible

1004
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:11,650
of the Earth to endure...

1005
01:41:11,858 --> 01:41:15,111
and endure...

1006
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,698
and then endure...

1007
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:22,327
tomorrow...

1008
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:26,206
and tomorrow...

1009
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:28,541
and tomorrow.
