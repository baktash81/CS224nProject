00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,733
THE LAST METRO

2
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,253
<i>Paris, September 1942.</i>

3
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,055
<i>Half of France is occupied
by the Germans.</i>

4
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,376
<i>The Occupied and Free zones...</i>

5
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,413
<i>are officially divided
by a borderline.</i>

6
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,339
<i>In Paris, the curfew...</i>

7
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,178
<i>is imposed at 11 p. m.</i>

8
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,258
<i>No one can afford to miss
the last metro.</i>

9
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,537
<i>Hungry Parisians queue up
to buy food...</i>

10
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,970
<i>and flock to theatres for warmth.</i>

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,297
<i>Movies are just as crowded...</i>

12
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,218
<i>playing to full houses.</i>

13
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,609
<i>At the Montmartre Theatre,
rehearsals are under way...</i>

14
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,370
<i>though its director,
Lucas Steiner, has fled France:</i>

15
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,299
<i>He didn´t have much choice!</i>

16
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,531
Excuse me, Mlle.
I noticed you... I wonder...

17
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,333
What time it is? It´s 6:40.

18
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,894
No, I´ve got a watch.

19
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,533
What else? Are you lost?

20
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,378
No, I live around here.

21
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,809
In that case... so long!

22
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,979
Wait... I don´t want you
to think I´m on the make...

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,810
I mean it.

24
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,852
Why would I think that?

25
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,938
I was in the café...
making a call...

26
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,496
I noticed you...
I mean it was your eyes...

27
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,216
and your expression.

28
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,252
So I figured...

29
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,370
What?

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,254
Well, this is my lucky day,
so I thought...

31
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,770
we might have a drink and talk.

32
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,733
I´m not thirsty and not interested.
Let me be!

33
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,218
You´ve got me all wrong.
D´you think I do this every day?

34
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,735
No, only every other day!

35
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,291
Stop pestering me.

36
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,698
Okay, have it your way...
No, wait... let me explain:

37
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,814
do you know what it means
to be attracted to someone?

38
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,012
Please, believe me...

39
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,298
I haven´t accosted
a strange woman in... 4 years.

40
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,811
What an honor...

41
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,135
Look, that´s enough!

42
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,217
D´you want a public scandal?

43
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,850
Think about it.
Let me have something: a name...

44
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,372
an address, a phone number.
I´m Bernard.

45
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,293
You want my number?

46
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,411
Great! Let me write it down.

47
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,336
Odeon 84-00.

48
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,771
Odeon 84-00...
Hey, who´re you kidding?

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,688
That´s the Talking Clock number!

50
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,059
Who´s that boy?

51
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,659
He´s the concierge´s son.

52
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,976
She works at the theatre.

53
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,413
What did he do to you?

54
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,258
He patted my head.

55
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,895
Let´s go and wash your hair out!

56
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,530
Come back here at once!

57
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,775
Is the theatre closed?

58
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,528
No. Go in through the stage door.

59
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,217
I´ve got an appointment.

60
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,296
Mr Granger?

61
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,137
Yes.

62
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,298
Mrs Steiner is expecting you.
Follow me.

63
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,899
Beautiful theatre!

64
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,170
It beats the Grand Guignol, right?

65
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,178
It´s twice as big...

66
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,973
I´ve been here before...

67
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,774
I saw Mrs Steiner
in "The Cherry Orchard".

68
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,730
Any news of Lucas Steiner?

69
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,295
The boss? He was lucky...

70
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,491
One day,
they came looking for him...

71
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,213
Here? The Germans?

72
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,492
No, the French.
They were buzzing all around...

73
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,135
but he had already
skipped out of Paris.

74
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,292
I hear he´s in America...

75
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,013
South America...

76
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,497
or around there.
I hope he can work.

77
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,611
The offices are upstairs.

78
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,735
Bernard Granger... Mr Merlin.

79
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,248
I recognized you.

80
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,571
Merlin´s our business manager.
He handles the finances.

81
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,099
Wait here.

82
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,570
A few minutes.

83
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,849
Okay, thanks.

84
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,333
Marion, I know Rosen´s
Aryan Certificate is a fake...

85
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,336
but they won´t check it
with a magnifying glass.

86
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,019
He´s got no work permit.

87
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,530
He´ll claim he lost it.

88
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,731
We could use our contacts.

89
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,578
No, we may need them.

90
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,330
With the papers he´s got,
he manages to work...

91
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,611
at the film studios.

92
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,375
He´s lucky they´re so careless...

93
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,448
but here, we stick to the rules:
no permit, no work!

94
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,977
What can I tell Rosen?

95
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,218
The truth: no Jews
in Marion Steiner´s theatre!

96
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,296
Rosen, come this way...

97
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,056
I didn´t know you were here!
I´ll be right back.

98
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,571
I´ll go get Marion.

99
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,697
Did you explain my case
to Mrs Steiner?

100
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,572
What did she say?

101
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,533
Sorry Rosen,
she won´t hire a Jew...

102
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,291
I just can´t believe it.

103
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,056
Anywhere else, I´d expect this...

104
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,138
but in Lucas Steiner´s
own theatre...

105
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,172
it´s truly an outrage!

106
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,696
Come in.

107
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,891
Hold it! I want to understand.

108
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,817
What?

109
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,491
I considered myself lucky to play
here but if I must lower my pants...

110
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,011
to prove I´m not a Jew...
thanks, but no thanks!

111
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,135
Besides, I refuse to take
anyone´s job away from him.

112
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,809
You´ve got it all wrong...

113
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,536
That actor was not slated
for the role of the tutor...

114
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,452
but for a walk-on in the third act.

115
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,333
Believe me!

116
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,817
Believe me, Granger...

117
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,376
You were my first choice
as Marion´s leading man.

118
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,610
You must realize our position...

119
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,970
We need an okay for the play.

120
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,013
We´re still waiting
for the Censor´s visa.

121
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,416
This is Bernard Granger.

122
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,531
I´ve heard great things about you...

123
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,130
from friends who saw you
at the Grand Guignol.

124
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,772
And I trust Jean-Loup.

125
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,177
At first, l was doubtful
about the Grand Guignol...

126
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,293
but finally, I enjoyed
playing "The Skeleton".

127
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,969
I never saw it
because I work at night.

128
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,770
In the past...

129
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,130
my husband managed everything.

130
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,010
I knew nothing
about administration...

131
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,619
and business details.

132
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,139
I had to learn quickly.

133
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,011
Let´s discuss your contract.

134
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,094
Right now?

135
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,098
Let´s get it over with.

136
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,416
What did you earn
at Grand Guignol?

137
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,330
I was looking for you.

138
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,772
Here´s the script. It´s wholesome
reading. Memorize it, child!

139
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,693
This one?

140
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,856
Yes, thanks.

141
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,973
I couldn´t find it
at the theatre bookshop.

142
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,171
It hasn´t been published.

143
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,212
I´ve never heard of it.

144
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,537
It´s a Norwegian play,
by a Norwegian playwright...

145
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,459
Karen Bergen,
a genuinely Norwegian name.

146
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,254
Lucas discovered it
and had it translated.

147
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,893
Do you speak Norwegian?

148
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,093
Neither do I. But I bet the critics
will pan the translation!

149
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,379
D´you know Granger?

150
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,410
Is he here?

151
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,849
In my office.

152
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,539
I don´t know him...

153
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,095
but we almost met.

154
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,096
Hello!

155
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,452
We expected you at Lucien´s
house-warming party.

156
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,130
I couldn´t make it.
We´ll meet again.

157
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,413
<i>"I hereby declare
I am not Jewish...</i>

158
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,531
<i>and to the best
of my knowledge...</i>

159
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,539
<i>my parents or grandparents
are not Jewish."</i>

160
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,655
How did it go?

161
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,497
Okay!

162
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,293
Great. I´ll see you around.

163
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,249
You never really wanted
to be an actress.

164
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,059
I enjoyed the job I had.

165
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,298
I know.
If Lucas hadn´t kidnapped you...

166
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,889
you´d still be in fashion.

167
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,491
Right, and that´s not all:

168
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,898
he said that if I refused,
he´d ask Coco Chanel to fire me!

169
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,898
It sounds just like him.

170
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,898
Can I turn the lights off?

171
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,771
Yes.

172
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,173
I´m waiting for you.

173
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,575
Right.

174
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,339
Oh hell! Daxiat!

175
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,531
I forgot we had a dinner date.

176
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,219
I´ll see you later.

177
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,615
Goodnight.

178
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,538
Don´t let him see you...

179
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,538
I forgot to tell you...

180
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,050
that I´m having dinner
with Daxiat.

181
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,252
He can help us
get the Censor´s visa...

182
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,929
I sort of promised
you might come.

183
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,289
You shouldn´t have.

184
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,094
I don´t see how
you can associate with him.

185
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,893
I don´t have much choice.

186
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,216
Remember why he panned
"Britannicus"?

187
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,139
Yes, he claimed it was
an effeminate play.

188
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,489
Even so, we need his help
for the visa...

189
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,499
All I ask is for you to say hello...

190
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,896
and also shake his hand.

191
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,776
I´ll shake his hand...

192
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,972
but no dinner. Figure out
some excuse. I´m going home.

193
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,458
Raymond, cut the lights.

194
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,016
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."

195
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,096
"Fine, Eric. Go to bed now."

196
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,369
Eric hesitates...

197
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,458
then turns back to his mother.

198
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,731
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"

199
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,738
"l don´t know.
What do you think?"

200
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,369
"He will return."

201
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,139
As Helena´s embroidery...

202
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,648
drops from her hands...

203
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,977
Carl hears a sound
and turns around.

204
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,976
"Who´s there?"

205
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,329
He sees Helena.

206
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,848
"Why are you hiding?"

207
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,813
"Leave this house.
Your presence here is harmful."

208
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,409
"Before I go,
you must hear me out."

209
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,976
"When Dr Sanders
hired me last Spring..."

210
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,293
Wait... let´s reverse that...

211
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,572
I think it´s best
to start with "Last Spring..."

212
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,052
"You must hear me out."

213
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,375
Hello, darling.

214
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,015
"Last Spring,
when Dr Sanders hired me..."

215
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,018
Come over here.

216
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,690
Arlette Guillaume,
our set and costume designer.

217
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,813
Bernard Granger...
he´ll play Carl.

218
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,613
You must have seen his act.

219
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,889
I don´t think so...

220
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,578
Wait... yes, I have seen it.

221
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,812
At the Grand Guignol?

222
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,414
No, in a very banal role:
Just a man...

223
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,735
on the prowl.

224
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,455
You can´t judge me by that part...

225
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,014
I was improvising.

226
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,370
You seemed to know it by heart!

227
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,458
The rehearsal´s over...

228
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,253
but I want to say something.

229
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,216
I´m going to stage the play.

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,889
Like all of you,
I´d have preferred...

231
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,570
that "Disappearance"
be directed by Lucas himself.

232
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,011
Fortunately,
he left us explicit notes...

233
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,291
as to the staging.

234
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,969
It goes without saying that...

235
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,050
we´ll be guided by his notes.

236
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,093
I´ll do my best to help you all.

237
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,139
That´s it!

238
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,174
May I leave now?

239
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,575
Run along.

240
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,334
What about Daxiat,
the drama critic?

241
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,896
Can´t he help us...

242
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,695
He got us the Censor´s visa,
so let´s not make waves.

243
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,172
Can you help me fix my bracelet?

244
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,492
The clasp is stuck.

245
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,329
You read palms?

246
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,175
What do you see?

247
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,132
There are two women in you.

248
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,217
That´s true. Go on!

249
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,818
Raymond, come quickly!
I´m scared...

250
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,250
I hear noises in the theatre.

251
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,490
Don´t worry, Germaine.
I´ll take a look.

252
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,928
Anybody here?

253
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,019
Anybody here?

254
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,778
How did you get in?

255
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,854
I watched the rehearsal.
It looks great.

256
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,937
I told you to wait outside, Martine!

257
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,209
Calm down.

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,899
Look what I´ve got.

259
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,779
Still interested?

260
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,494
I had no money.
I´ve got to pay for it tonight.

261
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,337
How much?

262
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,253
4 200 francs.

263
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,609
It´s 14 lbs!

264
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,299
I´ll go ask Mrs Steiner.

265
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,333
The Grand Guignol
has 100 orchestra seats...

266
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,532
200 with the balcony.
You average half a house?

267
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,294
Just about.
A little more on Sundays...

268
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,650
but they average half a house.

269
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,249
The seats range
from 20 to 40 francs...

270
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,815
A daily gross of 6 000.
How many players?

271
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,850
Mrs Steiner?

272
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,890
Excuse me.

273
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,130
The ham?

274
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,535
Oh, yes.

275
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,296
How many?

276
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,652
Four actors.
Tree of us play two roles each.

277
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,815
With the costs,
they barely break even.

278
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,250
It´s a losing proposition.

279
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,132
I´m ready. Shall we go?

280
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,170
Goodnight, Mrs Steiner.

281
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,372
Goodnight, Marion.

282
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,455
Come in.

283
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,773
I´ve got your ham. It´s 4 200 frs.

284
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,015
4 200 frs?

285
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,576
If it´s too expensive,
I can give it back.

286
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,579
No. It´ll last me the whole winter.

287
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,251
4 200?

288
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,097
Right!

289
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,252
Thanks. Here´s the cello.

290
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,212
What do I want with a cello?

291
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,858
Here´s the animal.

292
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,056
Look...

293
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,132
14 pounds!

294
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,898
You can´t walk around
with a ham in your arms, can you?

295
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,614
No, I can´t.
Good thinking! Thanks.

296
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,494
I´m off. Don´t forget
the lights and shutters.

297
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,453
The air-raid warden
is a real bastard!

298
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,458
I´ll remember.

299
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,094
Sir?

300
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,689
Valentin.

301
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,699
Oh, forgive me.
I´m so absent-minded these days.

302
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,414
No, please don´t apologize...

303
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,611
I know I´ve aged a lot.

304
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,176
I left a script
at the desk for you...

305
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,973
a screenplay.

306
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,615
Read it and tell me what you think.

307
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,130
I won´t detain you.
Goodbye Marion.

308
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,008
This is for you.

309
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,130
I know.

310
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,089
Your keys?

311
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,733
D´you have a minute?

312
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,537
I keep on getting mail
for Mr Steiner...

313
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,937
Probably from people
who don´t know he´s gone.

314
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,096
It´s embarrassing.

315
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,612
Should I return it to the senders,
or give it to you?

316
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,573
It´s probably theatre business mail.

317
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,498
I´ll take it.

318
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,611
D´you want all his mail?

319
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,969
- Yes.
- Fine.

320
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,773
- Thanks.
- You´re most welcome.

321
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,169
Room service?

322
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,416
No, I ate at the theatre.

323
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,094
Did the reporter
from "Paris Echos" call you ?

324
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,529
No. Why?

325
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,697
This morning, he was in the hallway
with a camera.

326
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,011
I told him you weren´t in.
He said:

327
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,939
"I just want to take
a picture of her room."

328
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,099
He said it was for a reportage
on "The Stars at Home".

329
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,817
I told him to call you.
Didn´t he call?

330
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,170
No.

331
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,813
Was I wrong?

332
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,217
No, you were right.
I hate those snoopers.

333
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,616
Are you watering your flowers?

334
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,015
It´s not flowers.

335
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,016
Vegetables?

336
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,210
No.

337
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,729
It´s for a pipe...

338
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,170
with a match, it smokes.

339
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,098
You´ll wind up in jail!

340
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,539
Where the hell is she?

341
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,652
For Christ´s sake!

342
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,138
Do we rehearse, or not?

343
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,816
We´re waiting for Nadine.
I´ll give her an earful!

344
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,658
You know what time it is?

345
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,295
You joy-ride with the Boches
and I get hell!

346
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,970
I was dubbing. We worked late,
so they drove me here.

347
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,377
You´re not squeamish! I bet
you´d accept a role in "Jew Süss"!

348
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,094
And how! But they didn´t have
a role for me!

349
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,891
Excuse me. I´m sorry.

350
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,136
Take your time!
You´re only an hour late.

351
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,888
What´s your excuse today?
Your alarm clock?

352
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,499
No, I was dubbing.

353
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,259
Must you grab every offer?

354
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,612
Can´t you leave the dubbing jobs
to those who need work?

355
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,776
She needs it.

356
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,209
She´s a pain in the ass!

357
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,091
No, I can´t...

358
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,810
I take every offer I get.

359
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,978
I do radio in the morning
and dubbing at noon.

360
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,898
At night, I do walk-ons.

361
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,774
On Thursday, I play Moliére
for school kids...

362
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,449
and if it´s a bit part
in a movie, I say yes!

363
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,130
The only way to succeed
is to accept everything...

364
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,897
to get maximum exposure
and make new contacts.

365
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,092
If you want to fire me, say so...

366
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,497
Sacha Guitry is casting.
I can run right over.

367
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,892
Have you anyone in mind?

368
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,740
Yes, I´ve got two men:

369
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,253
Raoul Coquet and Fernand Coustal.
Remember them?

370
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,048
Coquet sounds good.
I´ll call him.

371
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,537
I´m not so sure of Coustal.

372
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,449
I´ll put a question mark
on his name.

373
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,049
Is that her?

374
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,891
Yes...

375
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,976
That´s her.

376
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,136
Still a beauty!

377
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,011
Why "still"?

378
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,416
"The Sin" dates back
to my Communion.

379
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,133
You saw the film? How come?

380
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,775
I didn´t see it,
but I swiped all the stills...

381
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,170
including the famous one!

382
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,853
She really is beautiful...

383
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,979
but she´s strange...
I can´t figure her out.

384
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,618
Let´s make the phone call!

385
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,015
Lucas, I´ve got bad news for you.

386
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,218
The Germans banned the play?

387
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,410
No...

388
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,658
You can´t leave next week.

389
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,735
The escape route fell through.

390
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,011
You said it was a sure thing.

391
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,699
It´s never sure.

392
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,689
The passer who guides people
through Nevers was arrested.

393
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,258
I´ve got another lead,
but it´s risky.

394
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,895
You´re afraid he´ll get caught too?

395
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,738
No, worse than that...

396
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,732
Some passers...
so-called passers...

397
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,614
after taking your money...

398
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,255
drive you straight
up to the Kommandantur.

399
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,659
So they get paid off
on both ends...

400
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,612
You´re a special case:

401
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,972
some people may recognize you,
or spot your accent.

402
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,655
Let´s stay put for a while.

403
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,495
Will you be able to hold out?

404
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,850
Of course I will... I must!

405
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,173
But l hate to feel so useless...
so trapped.

406
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,893
Did you talk to Jean-Loup?
Will he help us?

407
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,530
Frankly, I´d rather
keep him out of it...

408
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,290
He knows too many people.
He gossips, he fools around...

409
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,899
it´s too dangerous!

410
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,331
D´you know how many letters about
Jews are mailed to the police?

411
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,171
Guess!

412
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,535
I don´t know... 300?

413
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,050
1 500! 1 500 letters daily!

414
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,093
"My boss is Jewish,...
my neighbour is a Jew..."

415
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,655
No. They all think you´re gone...

416
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,659
Let´s keep it that way.
I´ll take care of you.

417
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,654
Did you think I was being polite?

418
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,818
Well, you´re wrong:
I want to look at your legs!

419
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,812
Wait, let me breathe in
the smell of the stage.

420
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,733
From the cellar,
I follow all that goes on:

421
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,774
when the lights are dimmed in the
morning, I know it´s rehearsal time.

422
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,053
When they go on again,
it´s lunch time.

423
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,810
When all the lights go out
at night, it means...

424
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,170
you´re on your way down.

425
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,176
It reminds me of a play
I saw in London 3 years ago:

426
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,576
at night,
the husband would pretend...

427
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,011
to go out, but as soon
as the gaslight grew dim...

428
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,134
we knew it meant he´d come back
and was up in the attic.

429
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,615
Do you remember that play?

430
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,936
I almost acquired the rights.

431
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,010
He liked the Grand Guignol...

432
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,370
but he´s very happy to be with us.

433
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,778
He´s a little like Jean Gabin in
"The Human Beast": very physical...

434
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,573
and yet quite gentle.

435
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,054
He says it´s because of you
that he´s an actor.

436
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,650
No, I´ll do it myself.

437
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,135
Tell me how rehearsals are going.

438
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,578
Jean-Loup is doing well.

439
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,690
l was delighted today
when he blew his top!

440
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,218
Yes, just a minute.

441
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,930
Jean-Loup, it´s Daxiat.

442
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,255
What does he want?

443
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,529
I don´t know.

444
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,851
Hello, Daxiat. What´s up?

445
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,855
I heard it yesterday,
in the last metro.

446
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,654
They may stop rehearsals
of "The Dead Queen".

447
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,135
Why? Is Montherlant a Jew?

448
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,819
You´re pretty warm...

449
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,770
Daxiat wants to expose the Jews

450
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,851
who still work
at the Comédie Française.

451
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,739
He claims Jean Yonnel
is a Rumanian Jew.

452
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,616
I don´t know if Yonnel is Jewish,
or half-Jewish...

453
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,097
but I know
he should have run away...

454
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,735
far away from these maniacs.

455
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,534
They´re really crazy...
all madmen.

456
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,537
Not only in Germany, but here:
Daxiat and the others...

457
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:26,971
Madmen!

458
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,137
You wanted to know
what Bernard Granger looked like.

459
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,691
He´s just perfect.

460
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,258
At least we don´t have to worry:
he looks like a real goy!

461
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,576
What have you got against goyim?

462
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,088
Nothing against...

463
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,814
those with short skirts
and long hair.

464
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,250
You dirty racist!

465
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,577
My mother warned me
I´d never be happy with a Jew.

466
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,699
"You know, Carl...

467
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,091
if you wish to remain
in this house...

468
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,656
you must never pronounce
the name of Charles-Henri.

469
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,453
Everyone noticed
my new dress last night...

470
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,571
except for you..."

471
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,816
That´s very good, Nadine...

472
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,819
but I want you
to move over to Bernard.

473
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,250
We´ll give you a lamp.

474
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,690
You´ll put it on the table...
it will help...

475
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,459
Raymond, stop fooling around...

476
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,139
Go get us a lamp.

477
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,299
Let´s go on.

478
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,452
"Don´t tell me it´s your work."

479
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,214
"I know you work...

480
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,455
more than I do...

481
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,093
but some people in this house...

482
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,655
should keep...

483
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,090
their own duties in mind."

484
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,331
"Why do you say that?"

485
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,698
Because... it´s in the script!

486
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,128
Yes, it´s Daxiat.
Go over and say hello.

487
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,289
Be friendly. Remember he helped us
get the Censor´s visa.

488
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,298
Don´t worry. I´ll thank him.

489
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,972
Alright, kids. Let´s take a break.

490
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,889
Who´s he?

491
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,138
Don´t you know him:
he´s the lnspector-General...

492
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,491
Daxiat, the drama critic.

493
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,294
Is that Daxiat? I had no idea...

494
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,498
I´d love to meet him...

495
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,530
You´re not fussy!

496
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,095
He practically runs
the Comédie Française.

497
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,690
This may sound strange,
coming from me...

498
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,415
but I think your husband...

499
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,134
was wrong to leave France.

500
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,736
The new anti-Israelite laws...

501
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,215
apply to theatre speculators
and profiteers.

502
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,936
But your husband was a rare pearl:

503
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,568
the only Israelite
theatre director...

504
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,213
You can say Jewish!

505
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,457
He was at once
a brilliant executive...

506
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,652
a talented stage director
and an artist.

507
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,376
You see, the Germans
are deeply attached to culture.

508
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,697
They don´t want talented artists
to leave France.

509
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,813
But there´s no need
to worry about your play.

510
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,853
I´m certain Cottins
can handle the job.

511
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,020
Still, one wonders
why this play was chosen...

512
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,416
Even Pitoeff turned it down!

513
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,809
D´you know Mrs Fabre?
She wants to ask you for a favor.

514
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,977
Yes, of course. I know Madame.

515
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,216
It´s about my son, Pierre.

516
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,979
What´s he doing here?

517
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,138
He likes to sniff around
at rehearsals...

518
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,456
when he´s interested in a play.

519
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,014
Will he write about us?

520
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,097
He will, or he won´t.

521
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,416
I wish he´d forget us.

522
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,259
Just stay here.

523
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,570
Look...

524
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,328
We´re all Catholics in our family...

525
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,573
Here´s the proof...

526
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,420
Fine... I´ll do my best...

527
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,970
Come and meet our little circle.

528
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,295
Nadine Marsac, the top student
of the Simon drama course...

529
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,136
Well?

530
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,092
He´s going to help me.

531
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,051
Bernard Granger...

532
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,250
our leading man...

533
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,172
straight out of the Grand Guignol,
as you see.

534
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,939
He plays Carl?

535
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,777
Yes...

536
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,858
Strange... he´d be ideal as
"The Hairy Ape".

537
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,255
Raymond will show you the way out.

538
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,773
He doesn´t go for girls, does he?

539
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,299
Is it okay to ask you a question?

540
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,658
Look at this.

541
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,410
What do you call it?

542
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,416
A fishing rod.

543
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,452
But we also call it a gaulle.

544
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,652
Now, if we add a second one to it...

545
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,370
we get "Deux Gaulle"!

546
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,139
Bravo, Raymond...

547
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,731
You´re very witty!

548
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,897
I speak to you from the plant
of a journal...

549
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,738
that proclaims the truth!

550
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,012
I say the French theatre
must drive its Jews out...

551
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,417
from the rafters
to the prompter´s box!

552
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,168
For a Jewish prompter
at the "Menilmontant"...

553
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,850
will worm his way
to the high command of the Opera!

554
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,656
We must oust the Jew
from the stage and the wings...

555
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,453
and keep him out!

556
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,733
No Jew should be allowed
in a key position in theatre...

557
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,491
for his sordid practices
are bound to corrupt it!

558
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,649
<i>Let these "gentlemen" be warned...</i>

559
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,613
<i>that France is off-limits to Jews.</i>

560
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,735
<i>Only in this way can true Frenchmen
safeguard their nation!</i>

561
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,133
Here´s the money you asked for,
Mrs Steiner.

562
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,059
But I can´t raise
this amount every month.

563
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,012
Of course not.
This is exceptional.

564
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,177
In that case, there´s no problem.

565
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,371
Hello, Mr Merlin... Come in.

566
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,050
Marion, this is Rosette.

567
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,531
Put your samples on the desk
and run along home.

568
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,018
How old are you?

569
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,495
I´ll be fourteen in 3 months.

570
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,089
You´re working...
don´t you go to school?

571
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,211
No, I don´t want to anymore.

572
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,819
D´you like the theatre?

573
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,249
Yes.

574
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,293
Come see our play.

575
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,778
She can´t come to the theatre:
the kid can´t go out at night!

576
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,652
Yes, I can!

577
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,933
3 months ago, I went to hear
Edith Piaf at the ABC Theatre.

578
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,738
I wore my scarf down to here...

579
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,295
so nobody could see it.
There was no trouble.

580
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,414
We´ll talk about it some other time.
Go home. It´s late.

581
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,171
I´m surprised at you, Marion!

582
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,017
Now, that child will insist
on seeing the play...

583
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,895
Her parents hate to deny her
anything, but they´ll blame me.

584
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,139
Forgive me, I´m sorry.

585
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,138
I was sympathetic because...

586
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,648
Are they French?

587
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,090
The girl is,
but her parents are Polish.

588
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,450
The father´s a tailor.
He works at home...

589
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,419
in an attic.

590
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,930
He can´t go out in the street...

591
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,450
on account of his thick accent.

592
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,089
Like Lucas?

593
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,938
His is much worse...

594
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,529
Besides, he hardly speaks French...

595
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,536
lf a German asks him for directions,
he´d be trapped!

596
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,377
So he hides in his attic
and his wife manages for him.

597
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,096
Isn´t he scared of a denunciation?

598
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,177
Can´t they go to the Free zone?

599
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,052
They´d love to go...

600
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,934
but it costs a fortune
and they´re poor.

601
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,533
Got a date tonight?

602
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,617
Not really... I´m going home.

603
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,454
Let´s have dinner.

604
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,809
I´m sorry, I can´t.

605
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,739
You can´t spend every night
by yourself.

606
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,772
I´ve got to go home.

607
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,019
I´ve read them all,
Mrs Director.

608
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,371
Nothing of interest.

609
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,218
You can return them...

610
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,572
but first, make sure to burn
the reader´s notes...

611
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,498
they´re in my handwriting.

612
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,657
I´ll take care of it.

613
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,737
Let me explain
about the money:

614
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,896
I divided it in three wads.

615
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,451
The first is for the conveyor
who´ll take you to Vierzon.

616
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,059
They call them conveyors?

617
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,375
Yes, conveyors.

618
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,696
He´s to be paid
before he drives off.

619
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,972
You´ll be comfortable.
It´s a furniture moving van.

620
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,808
I´ll sit in an armchair,
like a minister!

621
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,295
Listen, Lucas. This is serious.

622
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,131
This wad is for the farmer who´ll
take you across the borderline.

623
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,730
His property is so big
that it extends over both zones.

624
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,693
At the furthest end,
you´re in the Free zone.

625
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,370
Let me guess:
the third wad is for Spain.

626
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,890
For Spain and for the rest.

627
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,252
And in case you need more,
I brought this.

628
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,449
No Mrs! Not the jewelry.
Not  the  jewelry!

629
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,129
You may need it.

630
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,412
So will you. Bring it along
when you join me...

631
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,374
I want you to join me...

632
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,017
as soon as possible.

633
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,136
To be safe, I´ve got to play
the first 100 performances.

634
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,092
Good God! What confidence!

635
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,413
D´you think it will run till then?

636
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,413
That´s 6 months...

637
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,776
No, I want you to leave
after the 50th... no later!

638
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,777
I´ll tell them I´ve got a spot
on my lungs...

639
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,732
and to find another actress.

640
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,536
I´ll turn the management over
to Jean-Loup...

641
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,533
and pretend I´m going to
a sanitarium. Then, I´ll join you...

642
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,250
And we´ll start from scratch.

643
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,808
I´m not a barber... stop fidgeting.

644
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,579
Don´t. It´s horrible!

645
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,376
I´m trying to feel Jewish.

646
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,417
It´s very hard to portray a Jew.

647
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,975
If you underplay, they´re skeptical.

648
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,491
If you overplay, they say:
"He doesn´t look Jewish."

649
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,255
What does it mean
"to look Jewish"?

650
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,895
Why ask me?

651
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,132
Don´t move around.

652
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,528
Listen, Marion...

653
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,299
I love that song.

654
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,617
<i>How could I resist his romancing...</i>

655
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,892
<i>or forget his manly embrace?</i>

656
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,250
<i>My heart still believes...</i>

657
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,893
<i>all the sweet lies...</i>

658
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,252
<i>and the tender look in his eyes.</i>

659
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,770
<i>I, who loved him so...</i>

660
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,973
<i>the most wonderful man
of St. Jean.</i>

661
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,974
<i>He broke my heart...</i>

662
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,339
<i>didn´t say goodbye...
or tell me why.</i>

663
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,254
<i>He broke my heart...</i>

664
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:42,213
<i>didn´t say goodbye...
or tell me why.</i>

665
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,092
- How´s the garden?
- Okay.

666
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,176
- Growing?
- Yeah.

667
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,337
Then, we can smoke!

668
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,931
Jacquot, come here.

669
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,173
Listen.

670
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,609
Can you recite?

671
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,935
- Sure.
- Ready?

672
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,810
Try to say: "´Mother,
do you think Mr Carl will return?"

673
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,489
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl
will return?"

674
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,974
Very good.

675
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,535
Now say:
"I like to study with him."

676
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,333
"I like to study with him."

677
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,093
That´s fine!

678
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,530
Hello!

679
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,970
"Mother, do you think Mr Carl
will return?"

680
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,534
What are you talking about?

681
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,094
"I like to study with him."

682
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,859
- What is this?
- It´s him.

683
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,453
- Who?
- Him!

684
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,051
- It´s OK now!
- Good.

685
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,494
Nadine, are you ready?

686
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,219
You can come in.

687
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,575
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"

688
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,738
"Please do. Don´t forget the salve
for his hand."

689
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,018
"I´m through, Mother."

690
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,130
"Fine. Go to bed now."

691
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,260
Now, you walk to the stairway...

692
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,610
You stop on the second step.

693
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,095
Don´t fall! Now you say your line.

694
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,336
"Mother, will Mr Carl return?"

695
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,372
"What do you think, son?"

696
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,379
"He´ll come back.
I like to study with him."

697
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,294
That´s fine, Jacquot. Bravo!

698
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,811
At least, we´ve got one good actor
in our play.

699
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,170
That´s nice. Thanks a lot!

700
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,529
See you tomorrow.

701
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,219
Do I get a kiss too?

702
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,058
You get a handshake!

703
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,649
Since you insist...
please, allow me...

704
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,692
I´ll read your palm:

705
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,978
there are two women in you...

706
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,338
Sorry, but neither one wants
to sleep with you!

707
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,169
So long!

708
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,890
It´s my own fault...

709
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,014
I was too obvious... too aggressive.
Now, she enjoys needling me!

710
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,814
When her job´s over,
she´ll just vanish.

711
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,058
I´ve got to score with her
before opening night!

712
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,579
D´you have my size in tan?

713
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,899
D´you have my size in tan?

714
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,535
What´s this?
Stop bothering Mrs Steiner!

715
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,732
She´s no bother, Raymond.
It´s alright.

716
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,495
I´ll get you a size 7.

717
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,099
Don´t you need stockings?

718
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,018
Sure, but I can´t afford them.

719
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,574
Are you kidding?

720
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,656
Not at all...

721
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,214
I use make-up.

722
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,899
So do I.

723
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,410
You even drew the seams.

724
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,655
How chic!

725
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,091
To do it right,
one needs a helping hand.

726
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,257
GERMAN TROOPS
INVADE FREE ZONE

727
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,059
Is that today´s paper?

728
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,978
Did you know about it?

729
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,295
I heard it on the radio.

730
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,496
People from the Free zone
will be happy...

731
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,732
They invaded the Free zone?
So what?

732
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,138
I´ll have to sneak across
all of France instead of just half.

733
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,138
No, the Germans are everywhere.

734
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,059
They search all the trucks.

735
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,854
The passer refuses to risk it...

736
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,335
It´s much too dangerous now.

737
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,180
What am I supposed to do?

738
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,611
Wait till things simmer down.

739
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,494
I can´t stay here. I´ll go crazy!

740
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,372
This is no life.

741
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,890
D´you know
how I kill time all day?

742
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,375
I read... I read a lot...

743
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,494
I listen to lies on the radio.

744
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,294
Then I read lies in the press.

745
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,299
To keep from losing my mind...

746
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,855
I do crossword puzzles.

747
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,176
You want to see them?

748
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,688
Just listen:

749
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,333
across, in 5 letters...
symbol of infamy: "kikes".

750
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,813
Down, in 8 letters...

751
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,898
stinking vultures: "sheenies".

752
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,896
These are for the kiddies:

753
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,369
"You can never trust one"...
in 3 letters:

754
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,537
the first letter is a J...

755
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,813
So l give up, I listen to
the sounds in the theatre...

756
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,092
I wait for your footsteps
on the stairs.

757
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,816
I wait and wait.
I can´t wait anymore!

758
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,619
How many years can a man live?

759
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,331
I can´t take it anymore...

760
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,851
Please, Lucas...

761
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,094
I´m going!

762
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,529
Where?

763
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,618
Away from here.
I´ll speak to them!

764
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,571
To whom?

765
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,090
The authorities... the police...
I´ll regularize...

766
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,655
my status. I´ll register.

767
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,532
Are you crazy?

768
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,617
Stay here! What do you want?

769
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,299
A concentration camp?

770
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,171
Let me go!

771
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,654
You´re not leaving...

772
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,452
I won´t let you!

773
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,577
Here, it´s real cognac...
from the black market.

774
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,897
You´re shaking...
You´d better take a drink.

775
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,496
I just realized something awful:

776
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,577
I could kill a man...

777
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,098
We´ll fix up the cellar.
We´ll get a real bed...

778
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,213
a comfortable armchair
and some rugs.

779
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,016
I need a desk.

780
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,048
You´ll have a real apartment.

781
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,457
I hope you won´t forget
the wallpaper.

782
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,691
Mrs Steiner wants a rifle
for the gamewarden.

783
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,337
We need an official permit
for a prop rifle...

784
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,134
It´s not so easy!

785
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,135
It´s what she wants.

786
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,890
I can´t go out that way.
They´re here.

787
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,658
We should have gotten up earlier.

788
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,612
- Use the back yard.
- Right.

789
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,173
- Marion...
- Yes?

790
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,451
Don´t forget to lock the door.

791
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,215
They sent him to another stalag...

792
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,297
but he can´t tell me where it is...

793
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,339
I mail them separately;
one of them might reach him.

794
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,293
They fit me. I´m the same size
as your husband.

795
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,333
He wasn´t my husband,
he was my number two.

796
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,217
I got them
at the Colonial Exposition...

797
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,058
for cash, of course.

798
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,098
At times, he was fun...

799
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,052
but what a bastard!

800
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,488
Hello, Bernard.

801
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,178
I bet you slept out:
you haven´t shaved.

802
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,734
Yes, I spent the night out:

803
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,929
I ran into a raid for
"Voluntary Labor in Germany".

804
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,336
Two guys were checking everybody.

805
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,576
So l turn this way and that way...

806
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,613
Each guy thought the other
had checked me out!

807
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,220
It´s nothing to brag about:

808
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,219
that´s why our prisoners
can´t come home.

809
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,613
How come you´re dressing up here?

810
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,256
Don´t broadcast it.
Yes, I spent the night out.

811
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,535
I hate for a man to touch me.

812
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,095
Can´t you do this instead of him?

813
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,655
You want to know
how I feel about it?

814
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,528
Maybe I can´t stand
touching a man!

815
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,496
Don´t forget my other costume.

816
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,658
What other costume?

817
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,453
It´s written in the script:

818
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,300
Act 2:
"Carl enters, wearing a frown."

819
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,332
I´d suggest something sober!

820
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,934
You know Granger?

821
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,209
The new actor?

822
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,695
Yes. Tell him I couldn´t wait.

823
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,331
Say Christian left this.

824
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,099
I´ll give it to him.

825
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,334
<i>Marion... are you there?</i>

826
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,689
Where are you?

827
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,495
<i>Go over to the bed
and say something.</i>

828
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,534
Say what? I´m by the bed.

829
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,009
<i>I can´t hear.</i>

830
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,291
Same here. I hardly hear you.

831
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,812
<i>Go over to the radio.</i>

832
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,054
Where is the radio?
I don´t see it.

833
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,060
<i>It´s next to the boiler.</i>

834
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,019
The boiler?

835
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,778
Here I am.

836
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,853
Is it this hole?

837
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,416
<i>Yes. I hear you as if you were
by my side.</i>

838
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,010
<i>Turn the sound on loud
and come up to the stage.</i>

839
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,577
This is very dangerous.

840
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,451
It´s not...

841
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,695
It´s great!

842
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,337
I rigged up the old heating vent.
With this set-up...

843
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,329
I can hear all the rehearsals
from the cellar.

844
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,853
At night, I can give you suggestions
to pass on to Jean-Loup...

845
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:55,530
Now, "Disappearance" is sure to be
a hit... it could run for a year!

846
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,017
I´m back in business:
I´m directing again...

847
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,980
but strictly incognito!

848
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,378
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies...

849
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,378
lies and contradictions."

850
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,015
"They´re not lies, but blanks.

851
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,691
They´re not lies, but blanks.

852
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,017
For years,
I tried to find out the truth.

853
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,250
It´s dreadful not to know
who one is... what one has done.

854
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,699
Even worse is the fear
it may occur again.

855
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,293
At times, I feel as if
I don´t really exist."

856
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,216
"Why won´t Dr Sanders allow you
to consult a doctor?"

857
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,535
<i>"He knows more than any doctor.
Without him, I´d be dead.</i>

858
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,129
<i>I´ll be eternally grateful to him."</i>

859
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,457
<i>"A prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer...</i>

860
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,095
<i>and Dr Sanders
has imprisoned you.</i>

861
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,178
<i>But if a man
tells you he loves you...</i>

862
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,291
why won´t you listen ?"

863
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,933
No... wait a minute.

864
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,417
Is it really necessary to shout
all these lines?

865
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,818
I don´t know...
it sounds all wrong to me.

866
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,773
Lucas´ notes are explicit:

867
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,858
this scene is to be played
like a duel.

868
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,179
Like a duel!

869
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,011
Alright, but it seems absurd to me.

870
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,731
"A prisoner owes no gratitude
to her jailer...

871
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,136
and Dr Sanders
has imprisoned you.

872
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,298
But if a man
tells you he loves you...

873
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,298
why won´t you listen?"

874
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,697
"I have no right to love...
no right to love, or be loved."

875
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,177
You are simply voicing
Dr Sander´s words.

876
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,858
"I will tell you something
about Dr Sanders."

877
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:46,891
There...

878
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,495
You told me to shout, so I did.
But I´m not happy about it.

879
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,977
I´m not happy either.
You see, we´re not happy.

880
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,256
Granger´s right.
The scene should not be shouted.

881
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,731
But that´s what you asked for!

882
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,419
So I made a mistake...

883
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,772
Jean-Loup shouldn´t take my notes
so literally.

884
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,331
What´s that?

885
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,611
An electricity failure.

886
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,335
Get a candle.

887
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,575
A candle...

888
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,453
It´s on again.

889
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,937
It shouldn´t be played as a duel,
but as a conspiracy.

890
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,616
Am I boring you?

891
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:34,980
Sorry, I´m simply exhausted.

892
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,411
Then sleep here...

893
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,377
No, I want to sleep at the hotel...

894
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,735
I´ll go home.

895
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,012
So, you´re deserting
the conjugal cave?

896
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,730
Goodnight.

897
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,929
Wait... wait.

898
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,695
I´m waiting.

899
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,295
I´ll see you tomorrow morning.

900
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:10,976
Raymond!

901
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,296
Raymond!

902
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,169
Did you see him?

903
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,017
No.

904
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,092
Are you the electrician?

905
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,213
No, not the electrician:
the engineer.

906
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,091
Here he is!

907
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,612
I know l´m late. While I stood
in line at the hardware store...

908
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,336
someone swipes my bike.
So I take the subway...

909
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,498
It breaks down:
we´re stuck between two stations...

910
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,089
As always.

911
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,371
Why not take a bike-cab?
We´d have paid for it.

912
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,457
For his size, they charge double!

913
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,370
That´s why I don´t take them!
I´ve got my self-respect!

914
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,888
I was just kidding.

915
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,013
Can you see me spread out
like a pasha...

916
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,768
being hauled around
by a poor bastard on his bike?

917
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,056
Sure, I know: fat men are funny...
good-natured clowns.

918
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,769
Well, I´m not a nice fat man...

919
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,891
I´m a nasty one... Go to hell!

920
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,539
Listen, last year they stole
my bike too...

921
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,572
so I kissed it off.

922
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:31,614
But 3 days later,
in another street... unbelievable!

923
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,653
What do I see?
My very own bike...

924
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,010
No. 813-HK-45.

925
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,256
So I figure I´ll take it back.

926
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,334
Just then, a creep walks up...
real cool...

927
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,658
I let him unfasten the lock.
Then I say:

928
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,898
"Look man, this is my bicycle!"

929
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,412
The creep acts indignant.
We swap insults...

930
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,215
People gather
around to watch the fight.

931
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,536
You know what he pulls?

932
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,651
He calls me a fairy.
No offense, Jean-Loup.

933
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,010
He claims I´m molesting him...

934
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,417
making indecent proposals...
the works!

935
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,491
The people give me dirty looks.
They all side with the crook!

936
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,055
<i>A real lynch mob! So I beat it fast
and never looked back!</i>

937
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,298
There are the Boches, the Heinies...

938
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:26,052
the Krauts, the Jerries...
I don´t remember the other one...

939
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,217
You forgot the buzzards...

940
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,819
That´s right... the buzzards.

941
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,617
Say, that´s my record-player!

942
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,779
It´s not yours, it´s Marion´s.
She lent it to me for a party.

943
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,692
They swipe all my props:

944
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,209
when it´s not an armchair,
it´s a record-player.

945
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,049
A gentleman is waiting for you.

946
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,456
I wonder who it is.

947
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,097
I don´t know his name.
He writes in "Je Suis Partout".

948
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,096
Daxiat?

949
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:21,972
Yes, it´s Mr Daxiat.

950
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,771
May I speak with you?

951
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,530
I wanted to meet you
outside the theatre...

952
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,017
because it´s a confidential matter.

953
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,611
I know you don´t like me...

954
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,368
but I daresay
it´s perhaps because...

955
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,809
you don´t know me.

956
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,499
I´m not judging you...

957
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,852
but your articles
have often hurt friends...

958
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,858
whose work I admire.

959
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,051
Others say you love the theatre.

960
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,409
I just don´t know.

961
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,176
Indeed, I am a paradox:

962
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,178
I adore the theatre,
I live for it and yet,

963
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,576
I´m hated by most theatre people.

964
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,451
It requires strength of character
to cope with such hostility.

965
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,810
I daresay I´ve got that strength.

966
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,768
I´ve always admired Lucas Steiner...

967
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:18,498
If he was here, I would tell him
our real struggle is socialistic...

968
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,571
anti-capitalistic... that we too,
are men of the Left...

969
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,179
but we go further:
we want revolution!

970
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,654
You know, Lucas...

971
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,932
read newspapers,
but only the theatre section.

972
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,733
I do the same. But politics...

973
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,011
You´re wrong:
everything is political!

974
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,688
But that´s not what I´m here for...

975
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,618
Lucas Steiner is still in France.

976
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,294
We´re sorry...

977
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,777
It´s stupid, but obligatory:
everybody down to the shelter!

978
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,892
That identity card was found
on a passer who was arrested.

979
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,137
Your husband must be
hiding out in some village...

980
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,730
but at some point,
he´s bound to contact you.

981
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,811
Would you give him a message:

982
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:35,610
if he comes back, I won´t write
anything against him.

983
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,970
It´s a matter of honor.

984
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,615
But if he returns,
you´ll be compromised.

985
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,092
And what about your theatre?

986
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,134
The name of Steiner
can only harm you.

987
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,854
You ought to get a divorce.

988
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:54,571
Do you remember, Marion?

989
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,213
Remember what?

990
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,369
The elevator
of that department store.

991
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,252
Yes, I remember...

992
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,813
I felt they all knew
what we were doing...

993
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,613
I was terrified...

994
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,972
Only terrified?

995
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,418
No, not only terrified...

996
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,814
But the night of that premiere...
There, you were scared...

997
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,852
No, I enjoyed it...

998
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,500
Go on... go home...

999
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,931
Go back to the hotel.
I´d rather you left right now.

1000
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,297
What if I stay here tonight?

1001
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,130
All night? Till tomorrow?

1002
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,610
All night. Till tomorrow!

1003
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,889
You mean it?

1004
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,012
I´ll put out the light
to consider your proposition.

1005
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,736
"But if I tell you I love you...

1006
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:52,136
Why won´t you listen?"

1007
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,059
I know it´s in the script,

1008
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:58,332
but l´d rather
you refrained during rehearsals.

1009
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,053
Save it for the perfomance!

1010
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,056
Let´s go on.

1011
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,935
"I have no right to love...
no right to love, or be loved."

1012
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:09,089
"But if I tell you I love you...

1013
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,818
why won´t you listen?"

1014
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,852
Bernard, you´re supposed to...

1015
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,778
caress her face just then.

1016
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,933
Marion told him not to touch her.

1017
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,935
<i>A large crowd is gathered here,</i>

1018
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:30,257
<i>I´m trying
to make my way through...</i>

1019
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,768
<i>What was that?</i>

1020
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,929
<i>I´m told that blast is due to...</i>

1021
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,053
<i>an explosive device
in a record-player!</i>

1022
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,339
<i>Admiral Froelich
has been seriously injured.</i>

1023
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,978
<i>They tell me he was killed!</i>

1024
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,698
<i>The ambush was set up
by some terrorists...</i>

1025
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,857
<i>A record-player exploded.</i>

1026
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,973
Excuse me, Mrs Steiner.

1027
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,693
I´m busy, Mr Merlin.

1028
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,129
Please: this is important.

1029
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,778
I know who he is...

1030
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,130
You shouldn´t sell your jewelry.

1031
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,059
Let me take it to a pawn shop.

1032
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,497
If the play´s a hit,
you can get it back.

1033
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,819
It makes sense.

1034
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,653
Thank you, Mr Merlin.

1035
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,092
I´m sorry, but I need some time...

1036
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,493
to think it over.

1037
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,133
As you wish.

1038
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,849
Would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room?

1039
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,934
The kind of help you want
can be picked up in a brothel.

1040
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,052
I can rehearse you.

1041
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,570
Never mind. I´ll manage.

1042
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:06,330
"Carl, if you wish to remain
in this house...

1043
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,498
you must never mention the name
of Charles-Henri."

1044
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:14,172
It´s at the perfume counter of
the Galeries. Ask for Miss Yolande.

1045
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:18,289
She´ll let you have
"Gone With the Wind" for 80 Frs.

1046
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,459
I wouldn´t spend that much
on a black market book...

1047
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,016
but if Marion wants it...

1048
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,335
Yes, she does.

1049
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,848
Then, I´ll get it.

1050
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:32,778
Would you help me rehearse
in my dressing room?

1051
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,812
I´ve never done it.

1052
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,853
It´s simple:
you just read the text.

1053
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,732
I say a line
and you answer me.

1054
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,975
Alright.

1055
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:45,813
It´s a nice room!

1056
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:47,328
Yes, it is.

1057
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,250
<i>Essentially, they´re profiteers.
Very few come here to work.</i>

1058
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:57,296
<i>The problem is that there´s no way
for most Frenchmen...</i>

1059
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,696
<i>to recognize a Jew.</i>

1060
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,938
<i>Ilf we could spot them,
we could protect ourselves.</i>

1061
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:06,735
<i>Some have typical racial features,
but not all of them!</i>

1062
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,580
<i>If only all Jews had blue skin,
but as it is...</i>

1063
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,170
<i>we need a foolproof way
to detect them...</i>

1064
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,139
They say: "It´s better
to hear that than to be deaf,"

1065
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,692
but at times,
I´d rather be stone-deaf!

1066
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,179
How was our rehearsal?

1067
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,691
Great...
I mean it was much better...

1068
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,854
The whispering improves the scene...

1069
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:36,416
but you could add to the intimacy
by dimming the lights.

1070
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,534
The faces could be illuminated
from the rear... as silhouettes.

1071
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,289
Don´t move...
Remember, you´re silhouettes!

1072
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,536
Raymond... if you don´t mind!

1073
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,173
You´re a genius, Jean-Loup.

1074
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,770
I´ll shift the backdrop
to sharpen the silhouettes.

1075
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:54,733
What the hell, Raymond?
We´re in the dark!

1076
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:57,375
l know!
The whole area´s in the dark!

1077
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,013
A light failure.

1078
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,052
Perfect for a shadow play!

1079
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,013
The whole neighbourhood´s
blacked out.

1080
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,450
You´d think they´d warn us.

1081
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,378
Marc, let´s get some lamps.

1082
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:12,130
I know where we can get candles...
for cash, of course!

1083
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,130
Nadine, we´re waiting for you.

1084
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,614
Let me explain.

1085
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:36,776
No need to.

1086
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:38,129
Don´t judge me.

1087
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,375
I´m not judging you...

1088
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,493
but try to keep your love life
outside the theatre.

1089
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,092
Marion´s heartless.

1090
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,770
She´s too tough...

1091
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,372
She´s not interested in anyone.

1092
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,738
She has no sympathy for anyone.

1093
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,250
She doesn´t know I´m alive.

1094
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,650
She´s worse since Lucas´ gone.
I can´t stand it!

1095
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,530
Calm down, child... calm down...

1096
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,730
It´s not the end of the world.

1097
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,217
She opened a door
that should have been locked.

1098
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,491
You see it as a tragedy, but...

1099
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,419
in two weeks,
it will have been forgotten.

1100
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:26,096
I hope you´re right.

1101
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:29,372
I want to go home.

1102
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,779
Run along.

1103
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:43,282
Can I help?

1104
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:46,037
No, drop it.
You´re the last thing she needs.

1105
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:47,762
She´ll be alright.

1106
01:09:48,049 --> 01:09:50,279
I hate to see her so upset.

1107
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:55,118
Christ! I really was
on the wrong track with her.

1108
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:57,161
That´s for sure!

1109
01:09:57,449 --> 01:10:00,600
She´s no playmate for you...
she´s more like a competitor.

1110
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:03,604
Were you really stuck on her?

1111
01:10:06,889 --> 01:10:08,845
I just wanted to sleep with her...

1112
01:10:09,129 --> 01:10:12,166
it was like a craving
for a warm croissant!

1113
01:10:12,529 --> 01:10:15,282
I wanted to warn you to drop her,
but I figured...

1114
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:17,446
it was none of my business.

1115
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:23,398
You´re all going to the Joconde
tonight? lt´s a cabaret.

1116
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:27,406
You know what the BBC says?
They say all those...

1117
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:31,204
who go to night clubs will be held
to account after the war.

1118
01:10:33,049 --> 01:10:35,688
Jean-Loup
wants to boost our morale.

1119
01:10:39,329 --> 01:10:41,968
You...
you had the right to be moody...

1120
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:45,287
to throw a party, or be by yourself.

1121
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:50,439
Why am I expected to be charming
and smiling at all time?

1122
01:10:52,329 --> 01:10:54,001
Even Jean-Loup picks on me.

1123
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:57,725
He´s right.
And he doesn´t know half of it!

1124
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:01,605
I don´t mind that you neglect me...

1125
01:11:02,529 --> 01:11:06,078
but for the others,
the play comes first.

1126
01:11:06,369 --> 01:11:09,679
You must pay
more attention to them.

1127
01:11:11,569 --> 01:11:13,207
Why don´t you answer?

1128
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,441
I´d rather not.

1129
01:11:16,969 --> 01:11:19,483
The coffee´s ready.
I´ve got to run.

1130
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:24,197
Marion!

1131
01:11:24,729 --> 01:11:25,525
Yes?

1132
01:11:25,809 --> 01:11:29,643
I heard you and Bernard
rehearsing the love scene.

1133
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:31,962
So what?

1134
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:35,049
It seems to me... I feel...

1135
01:11:35,329 --> 01:11:36,967
it might be improved.

1136
01:11:37,649 --> 01:11:38,923
What do you mean?

1137
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:42,800
It´s the only love scene
in the play. Try to be...

1138
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:45,567
more sincere...

1139
01:12:33,169 --> 01:12:35,319
No, this seat´s for Bernard.

1140
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:40,128
I can´t stay. I´ve got to meet
the producer of "Angels of Mercy".

1141
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,123
I´m not sure... it´s between me
and two other girls.

1142
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,799
I hope you get the role.

1143
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:50,203
We´ll pray for you.

1144
01:12:50,929 --> 01:12:51,759
I´m off.

1145
01:13:07,609 --> 01:13:08,564
She´ll be good...

1146
01:13:08,849 --> 01:13:11,283
but they may feel she´s too young.

1147
01:13:11,569 --> 01:13:12,558
She´d be better

1148
01:13:12,849 --> 01:13:14,407
in "School for Wives".

1149
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:16,680
Nadine in the role of Agnés?

1150
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:20,241
When she announces:
"The little kitten is dead..."

1151
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:23,965
the whole audience will think:
"She´s the one who killed it!"

1152
01:13:27,209 --> 01:13:29,040
Enjoying yourselves?

1153
01:13:30,049 --> 01:13:31,038
Sit here!

1154
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:35,083
Well, I´m not alone.
I brought a friend. Simone...

1155
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:36,927
Sit down.

1156
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:39,769
Take care of her
while I check our things.

1157
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:46,445
Arlette, sit next to me.

1158
01:13:53,009 --> 01:13:54,681
Just a minute.

1159
01:14:02,649 --> 01:14:06,278
Give those back.
I´ve changed my mind.

1160
01:14:16,489 --> 01:14:19,003
Sorry, Mrs Steiner. I can´t stay.

1161
01:14:21,009 --> 01:14:22,328
Come on, let´s go.

1162
01:14:22,609 --> 01:14:24,088
I forgot... I´ve got a date.

1163
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:25,688
You´re free. We´re all free.

1164
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:28,403
I apologize. I´ll see you tomorrow.

1165
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:52,284
That man´s staring at us.
Don´t look. He´s coming over.

1166
01:14:52,929 --> 01:14:54,248
Hello, Cottins.

1167
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:57,677
Still in show business...
a real trooper!

1168
01:14:58,289 --> 01:14:59,847
Introduce me.

1169
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,482
I forget your name.

1170
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:02,878
René Bernardini.

1171
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:06,320
Bernardini... Arlette Guillaume...
Marion Steiner.

1172
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,602
I´ll be right back.

1173
01:15:12,089 --> 01:15:13,238
You promise!

1174
01:15:32,169 --> 01:15:35,525
This joint is tacky.
Let´s go to the Monseigneur.

1175
01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:37,879
No, Marion´s exhausted.

1176
01:15:38,169 --> 01:15:41,684
Speak for yourself.
I feel like going there!

1177
01:15:42,449 --> 01:15:44,246
Wait for Arlette.

1178
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:46,087
No, you two are kill-joys.

1179
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:48,519
I´m not sleepy.
It´s sinister here. Let´s go.

1180
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:54,764
What´s up?

1181
01:15:55,049 --> 01:15:57,199
Tonight, I´m on my own.

1182
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:05,438
What´s going on?

1183
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:06,878
That´s Marion:

1184
01:16:07,169 --> 01:16:10,081
the party fizzles, so she opts
for an all-night disaster.

1185
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:27,199
I see Daxiat has two seats...

1186
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:27,359
I see Daxiat has two seats...

1187
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:29,207
in the 7th row.

1188
01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:31,957
Remember: 20 seats
for the Propagandastaffel!

1189
01:16:32,929 --> 01:16:36,399
Why look at me that way?
It´s mandatory:

1190
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:38,805
20 seats every night.
It´s a rule.

1191
01:16:39,089 --> 01:16:42,320
At the Odeon, they put them
in the side boxes.

1192
01:16:42,689 --> 01:16:43,838
We´ll do the same!

1193
01:16:57,849 --> 01:16:59,282
It´s too much!

1194
01:16:59,569 --> 01:17:02,322
We give good seats
to those who pan us...

1195
01:17:02,609 --> 01:17:05,123
and we turn down genuine fans.

1196
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:08,879
Lucas would say: "We give
our best seats to our enemies."

1197
01:17:09,769 --> 01:17:13,045
My purse was in my dressing room.
It´s missing.

1198
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:15,728
Oh, great!

1199
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:25,367
What a mess!
Somebody searched this room.

1200
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:26,486
Well?

1201
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:28,282
They took my travel clock.

1202
01:17:28,569 --> 01:17:30,799
I think that´s all they swiped.

1203
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:33,318
And you?

1204
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:35,884
They left my wallet,
but it´s empty.

1205
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:38,403
It´s worse for you.

1206
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:42,523
I don´t mind the money,
but my ration cards, my I. D. card,

1207
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:45,198
my work permit
and my pass were in my purse.

1208
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:49,123
I´m glad
I locked your door, Marion.

1209
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:51,802
I´ll get the police.

1210
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:53,886
No, we´ll do the searching.

1211
01:17:54,809 --> 01:17:56,481
Just like at Radio-Paris:

1212
01:17:56,769 --> 01:18:00,887
some "moving men" came for
the piano. They never returned it.

1213
01:18:01,169 --> 01:18:03,046
They were moving men like I am!

1214
01:18:03,329 --> 01:18:07,288
That´s fine, but I need my papers.
I wonder who did it.

1215
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:10,999
Well, I know who did it...
I´m almost sure of it.

1216
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:15,044
Raymond, you know who I mean.
I guess you don´t agree...

1217
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:18,521
Yes, I do! It could only be her.

1218
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:19,924
I guessed it at once...

1219
01:18:20,769 --> 01:18:21,485
Martine...

1220
01:18:21,769 --> 01:18:25,079
Raymond, you know where she lives.
Run over there...

1221
01:18:25,809 --> 01:18:27,561
No, I don´t know!

1222
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:29,441
Come on, she´s your sweetie!

1223
01:18:29,729 --> 01:18:31,640
She´s not: she turned me down.

1224
01:18:31,929 --> 01:18:35,842
She peddles her black market stuff
around theatres. That´s how we met.

1225
01:18:36,089 --> 01:18:40,241
I took her out once. That´s all.
I don´t even know her address.

1226
01:18:40,809 --> 01:18:42,925
I´ve never been to her place...

1227
01:18:44,169 --> 01:18:46,080
but she´s a looker...

1228
01:18:46,369 --> 01:18:48,883
I let people think
we slept together.

1229
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,401
Let´s call the police.

1230
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:56,284
I don´t want the police
to seet foot in this theatre.

1231
01:18:56,569 --> 01:18:58,002
This way, please...

1232
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:58,482
This way, please...

1233
01:18:58,849 --> 01:19:00,885
Clear the aisle. Thank you.

1234
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:03,121
Any seats tonight?

1235
01:19:03,409 --> 01:19:05,718
No, it´s opening night.

1236
01:19:11,409 --> 01:19:13,320
That´s Marion Steiner.

1237
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:20,002
Where is Mrs Steiner´s office?

1238
01:19:20,289 --> 01:19:22,200
It´s on the landing.

1239
01:19:24,889 --> 01:19:27,005
Her dressing room is there.

1240
01:19:27,289 --> 01:19:29,723
No. Leave the flowers here.

1241
01:19:30,009 --> 01:19:32,842
They´ll poison the air in there.

1242
01:19:47,809 --> 01:19:49,561
I hear them, Marion.

1243
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:03,284
I don´t see how you can eat.
I couldn´t.

1244
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:04,763
Sure you can. Here.

1245
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:07,085
No, I swear I can´t.

1246
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:10,167
What if tonight´s a disaster?

1247
01:20:10,809 --> 01:20:12,083
We´ll do a new play.

1248
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:14,007
With what money?

1249
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:16,723
Have you seen our accounts?
I have.

1250
01:20:17,009 --> 01:20:19,239
If it´s a flop,
we lose the theatre.

1251
01:20:19,529 --> 01:20:23,124
I´m terrified.
How can you be so calm?

1252
01:20:23,649 --> 01:20:26,800
Lucas, you picked the play,
you staged it...

1253
01:20:27,089 --> 01:20:28,681
we followed your advice.

1254
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:31,927
It´s your creation.
If it doesn´t work...

1255
01:20:32,209 --> 01:20:33,927
if it doesn´t work...

1256
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:37,003
I´m to blame, it´s my fault...
my own fault...

1257
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:40,083
but we´ll all be up shit creek!

1258
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:41,199
Have a drink.

1259
01:20:41,489 --> 01:20:44,083
I don´t know how you do it...

1260
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:46,246
I feel faint...

1261
01:20:46,529 --> 01:20:48,247
I´m sick to my stomach.

1262
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:50,087
Just relax...

1263
01:20:51,049 --> 01:20:54,041
Wait, put this over your stomach...
sit down.

1264
01:20:58,729 --> 01:20:59,684
Thanks.

1265
01:21:02,409 --> 01:21:03,808
I must go now.

1266
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:06,008
We´ll talk later.

1267
01:21:06,289 --> 01:21:07,165
Sure.

1268
01:21:07,889 --> 01:21:08,958
So long.

1269
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:11,844
I should be reassuring you.

1270
01:21:12,129 --> 01:21:14,882
There´s no need to.
I feel gay as a lark.

1271
01:22:05,489 --> 01:22:07,241
"Isn´t Eric here?"

1272
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,599
"He was restless this morning.

1273
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:13,518
He´s probably at the gate,
watching the road."

1274
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:16,966
"Dr Sanders wouldn´t allow him
to go to the station."

1275
01:22:17,249 --> 01:22:18,967
"My godfather knows best.

1276
01:22:19,249 --> 01:22:22,844
I suppose he wanted to speak
to the new tutor in private.

1277
01:22:24,049 --> 01:22:26,722
But if I´d been consulted,
I´d say...

1278
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:28,647
Eric has no need for a tutor.

1279
01:22:29,329 --> 01:22:33,208
<i>He´s too young and I enjoy
teaching him the little I know."</i>

1280
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:35,281
"You are right, Mrs...

1281
01:22:35,569 --> 01:22:38,800
but this big house
is too quiet for Eric.

1282
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:43,159
My mother says
that when she worked here...

1283
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:45,644
she often served 20 dinner guests."

1284
01:22:46,769 --> 01:22:50,079
There are 25 of us in Paris:
we´re "public utilities".

1285
01:22:50,369 --> 01:22:51,802
"On my birthday...

1286
01:22:52,089 --> 01:22:55,445
when Dr Sanders told me
I could eat with the grown-ups...

1287
01:22:55,729 --> 01:22:56,718
I cried."

1288
01:22:57,969 --> 01:22:59,925
How come she´s going in?

1289
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:02,359
My son is acting in this play!

1290
01:23:03,169 --> 01:23:05,399
"Shall I prepare Eric´s room now?"

1291
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:07,079
You alright?

1292
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:11,203
As the boss used to say:
"When you gotta go, you gotta go!"

1293
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:14,208
"Tell Eric to finish his homework."

1294
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,687
"This is Mr Carl, our new tutor.

1295
01:23:24,289 --> 01:23:25,722
I should have warned you...

1296
01:23:26,009 --> 01:23:28,125
The resemblance is striking...

1297
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:29,637
It´s truly amazing!"

1298
01:23:29,929 --> 01:23:31,681
"l don´t know what you mean.

1299
01:23:32,409 --> 01:23:34,969
But I expected an older man."

1300
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:37,558
"I´m an experienced teacher."

1301
01:23:37,849 --> 01:23:39,168
"I don´t doubt it.

1302
01:23:39,449 --> 01:23:42,486
But so far, my son
has been raised solely by us.

1303
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:46,557
I had hoped he might
be guided by someone who...

1304
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:49,647
Still,
since my godfather trusts you...

1305
01:23:51,369 --> 01:23:53,803
Eric, meet your new tutor."

1306
01:23:55,129 --> 01:23:58,599
"Helena, be wary
of your faulty memory.

1307
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:01,566
Here are his credentials.

1308
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:05,048
I showed them to you
a month ago."

1309
01:24:06,169 --> 01:24:07,568
What a bastard!

1310
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,285
"You´re surely right,
I was confused..."

1311
01:24:11,569 --> 01:24:13,048
"Certainly
by the resemblance."

1312
01:24:13,329 --> 01:24:15,320
"Every new face upsets me...

1313
01:24:15,689 --> 01:24:17,884
But I´ll get used to him. Besides...

1314
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:19,158
Eric seems happy."

1315
01:24:19,449 --> 01:24:21,883
"Can I take Mr Carl
around the estate?"

1316
01:24:22,169 --> 01:24:23,397
"Of course, child."

1317
01:24:26,849 --> 01:24:28,487
<i>"Listen, Gregory."</i>

1318
01:24:28,769 --> 01:24:31,681
<i>"When will you learn to trust me?</i>

1319
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:35,242
<i>Don´t you realize
how I cherish you?</i>

1320
01:24:35,729 --> 01:24:36,764
<i>Besides..."</i>

1321
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:42,447
<i>"l don´t want to lose you."</i>

1322
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:48,687
Hurry up!

1323
01:24:50,369 --> 01:24:53,679
Germaine,
we´ve only got five minutes!

1324
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,482
Don´t turn around!

1325
01:24:55,769 --> 01:24:57,407
How did it go?

1326
01:24:57,689 --> 01:24:59,327
We´ll know when it´s over.

1327
01:25:03,089 --> 01:25:05,683
Watch it...

1328
01:25:06,249 --> 01:25:07,967
Easy...

1329
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,643
What´s going on?

1330
01:25:21,929 --> 01:25:23,408
We´re 5 minutes late.

1331
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:25,645
Can´t we go in quietly?

1332
01:25:25,929 --> 01:25:28,079
"I must tell you about Dr Sanders."

1333
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:29,638
"You´ve no right!"

1334
01:25:29,929 --> 01:25:31,647
"I must tell you, Helena:

1335
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:35,086
Dr Sanders didn´t come back
after Charles-Henri´s death,

1336
01:25:35,289 --> 01:25:36,688
but before it."

1337
01:25:46,449 --> 01:25:49,839
"Since I came here,
I´ve heard nothing but lies...

1338
01:25:50,129 --> 01:25:52,404
lies and contradictions."

1339
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:55,124
"They weren´t lies, but blanks.

1340
01:25:55,849 --> 01:25:58,409
I´ve spent years trying
to learn the truth.

1341
01:25:59,009 --> 01:26:02,399
It´s terrifying not to know
who I am, or what I did.

1342
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:05,767
Worse yet, is the fear
that it may occur again.

1343
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:08,877
At times, I feel I don´t really exist."

1344
01:26:09,809 --> 01:26:13,358
"But when I told you I love you...

1345
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:16,645
Why didn´t you listen?"

1346
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:19,483
I had no right to love,
don´t you see?

1347
01:26:19,769 --> 01:26:22,283
No right to love, or be loved."

1348
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:29,048
"And now?"

1349
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:33,125
"Now, I´m coming to love
and it hurts.

1350
01:26:34,009 --> 01:26:36,045
ls love painful?"

1351
01:26:37,049 --> 01:26:38,926
"Yes, love is painful.

1352
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:45,519
Like a bird of prey,
it hovers over us...

1353
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:49,124
as if to threaten us.

1354
01:26:50,769 --> 01:26:54,045
But it is also
a promise of happiness.

1355
01:26:55,649 --> 01:26:57,207
You´re lovely, Helena...

1356
01:26:58,369 --> 01:27:01,281
so lovely that it´s painful
to look at you."

1357
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:03,639
"Yesterday, you said it was a joy."

1358
01:27:03,929 --> 01:27:07,046
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1359
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:25,643
We won!

1360
01:28:02,289 --> 01:28:05,759
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.

1361
01:28:02,529 --> 01:28:05,999
I´m sorry, but Marion´s exhausted.

1362
01:28:06,289 --> 01:28:08,644
You understand...
She´s got to rest.

1363
01:28:08,929 --> 01:28:10,840
You can come in.

1364
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:14,406
Send her a note.
She´ll appreciate it.

1365
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:17,362
I didn´t know you were here.
Come in.

1366
01:28:17,649 --> 01:28:19,401
My husband´s with me.

1367
01:28:19,689 --> 01:28:20,963
So he is!

1368
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:28,717
Put them there.

1369
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:35,002
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks.

1370
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:38,967
I knew the torn dress
would be effective.

1371
01:28:42,369 --> 01:28:44,519
Sorry, but they insist on it.

1372
01:28:45,889 --> 01:28:48,608
Captain Wiedekind and his wife.

1373
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:52,839
My husband doesn´t speak French.

1374
01:28:55,889 --> 01:28:59,086
Cheer up! You look grim.

1375
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:01,724
I´m not. Here´s to you.

1376
01:29:16,169 --> 01:29:18,080
It went smoothly.

1377
01:29:18,369 --> 01:29:20,007
Except for that louse, Daxiat.

1378
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:24,320
What are you brooding about?

1379
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:27,521
I´m not. I was thinking
about the play.

1380
01:29:27,809 --> 01:29:31,165
I enjoyed playing with you.
I was really moved.

1381
01:29:32,049 --> 01:29:34,688
You gave a great performance.

1382
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:37,563
I´ll do better in a few days.

1383
01:29:38,089 --> 01:29:39,966
See that man over there?

1384
01:29:41,249 --> 01:29:43,558
The one who´s by himself?

1385
01:29:43,849 --> 01:29:45,965
Yes. Please get him out of here.

1386
01:29:46,249 --> 01:29:47,682
Leave it to me.

1387
01:29:54,769 --> 01:29:55,918
Remember me?

1388
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:58,439
Yes. You can´t stay here...

1389
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:01,846
This is a private gathering...
A working session.

1390
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:03,448
She´s expecting me.

1391
01:30:03,729 --> 01:30:06,721
She´s not expecting anyone.
She´s exhausted...

1392
01:30:07,009 --> 01:30:08,283
That way out!

1393
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:09,888
Did she get my flowers?

1394
01:30:10,169 --> 01:30:11,807
Were those your roses?

1395
01:30:12,089 --> 01:30:15,047
They were so full of thorns
her hands were all bloody!

1396
01:30:16,289 --> 01:30:18,519
If I were you,
I´d go home real fast!

1397
01:30:20,809 --> 01:30:21,639
So long!

1398
01:30:31,769 --> 01:30:33,646
Thank you very much.

1399
01:30:34,769 --> 01:30:37,442
You were excellent!

1400
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:41,485
Bravo, you were great!

1401
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,646
I was? Thanks.

1402
01:30:49,489 --> 01:30:51,207
Looking for someone?

1403
01:30:51,489 --> 01:30:52,604
No, never mind.

1404
01:30:53,929 --> 01:30:55,203
Are you pleased?

1405
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:57,684
I´m happy for Marion.

1406
01:30:58,209 --> 01:31:02,248
I don´t understand you.
You heard the applause! It´s a hit!

1407
01:31:02,529 --> 01:31:04,201
A hit... a hit...

1408
01:31:04,489 --> 01:31:06,605
Maybe so, but it´s far from perfect.

1409
01:31:06,889 --> 01:31:10,120
From down here,
you can tell all the weak spots.

1410
01:31:10,409 --> 01:31:13,242
I made notes.
I´ll read them to you.

1411
01:31:13,529 --> 01:31:15,042
Sit down.

1412
01:31:16,369 --> 01:31:18,883
In the first place...

1413
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:22,642
Are you crazy?
We can´t do that now.

1414
01:31:23,049 --> 01:31:25,688
They´re waiting for me.
I can´t stay.

1415
01:31:25,969 --> 01:31:27,687
Come back later on.

1416
01:31:27,969 --> 01:31:29,243
How can I?

1417
01:31:29,529 --> 01:31:33,408
We´re all together up there.
You know what it´s like...

1418
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:35,486
Then, spend the night here.

1419
01:31:35,769 --> 01:31:38,329
That´s impossible. Be sensible.

1420
01:31:38,609 --> 01:31:40,679
I´ll come down tomorrow morning.

1421
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:43,563
Then take my notes. Study them.

1422
01:31:43,849 --> 01:31:44,884
Alright.

1423
01:31:46,249 --> 01:31:48,285
Wait... look at me!

1424
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:51,879
Where can I put them?
Keep them till tomorrow.

1425
01:31:54,329 --> 01:31:55,523
Kiss me...

1426
01:31:58,169 --> 01:31:59,397
Goodbye.

1427
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:20,885
<i>Daxiat liked it.
He´ll give us a rave...</i>

1428
01:32:23,129 --> 01:32:25,245
<i>Here´s Marion!</i>

1429
01:32:26,009 --> 01:32:27,886
<i>Where were you?</i>

1430
01:32:28,649 --> 01:32:30,367
<i>Some champagne for Marion...</i>

1431
01:32:33,969 --> 01:32:35,925
I want the "Petit Parisien"...

1432
01:32:36,209 --> 01:32:38,598
"Aujourd´hui", "La Gerbe"...

1433
01:32:39,249 --> 01:32:41,888
´´Comedia´´ and ´´Je Suis Partout.´´

1434
01:32:43,649 --> 01:32:45,241
Listen to Daxiat:

1435
01:32:45,529 --> 01:32:47,520
"The Montmartre Theatre
has changed its management,

1436
01:32:47,809 --> 01:32:50,528
but not its spirit.
Its new play is a hazy vignette."

1437
01:32:50,809 --> 01:32:54,484
"Hazy!" Sure...
he missed the beginning.

1438
01:32:55,809 --> 01:32:56,559
"Colorless...

1439
01:32:56,849 --> 01:33:00,239
and apolitical, it deliberately
ignores our real problems."

1440
01:33:01,169 --> 01:33:02,124
Naturally!

1441
01:33:02,809 --> 01:33:04,242
"Mrs Steiner maintains...

1442
01:33:04,529 --> 01:33:07,202
the tradition of Jewish nihilism...

1443
01:33:07,689 --> 01:33:10,567
which has always polluted
that theatre.

1444
01:33:10,849 --> 01:33:15,161
The play says nothing about Jews.
Yet, it reeks of Jewishness.

1445
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:20,325
As to the staging
by Jean-Loup Cottins...

1446
01:33:21,089 --> 01:33:24,764
it is merely an effeminate version
of Lucas Steiner´s style."

1447
01:33:25,209 --> 01:33:26,437
Hear, hear!

1448
01:33:29,049 --> 01:33:32,007
"What can I say
about Marion Steiner´s performance?

1449
01:33:32,289 --> 01:33:35,042
It´s all-pathos,
but unfit for the stage.

1450
01:33:36,129 --> 01:33:37,642
Back to the movies, Mrs!"

1451
01:33:37,849 --> 01:33:38,440
See?

1452
01:33:41,129 --> 01:33:44,599
"The only revelation
is Bernard Granger..."

1453
01:33:45,929 --> 01:33:48,887
"He creates a totally
convincing character.

1454
01:33:49,169 --> 01:33:50,648
A star is born."

1455
01:33:50,929 --> 01:33:51,918
At last!

1456
01:33:53,249 --> 01:33:54,443
It´s not funny.

1457
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:58,608
No, but the other reviews are good.

1458
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:01,801
With the booking we´ve got,
the play´s a winner.

1459
01:34:02,849 --> 01:34:04,441
Thanks to you, Marion.

1460
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:09,245
Your film fans come to see you
in the play.

1461
01:34:10,249 --> 01:34:13,605
"...the Jewish nihilism
which polluted that theatre."

1462
01:34:14,009 --> 01:34:17,160
He signed it, but it reads like
an anonymous letter!

1463
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:18,758
You´re right.

1464
01:34:19,649 --> 01:34:22,925
Daxiat and company
have the same poisonous motives.

1465
01:34:23,809 --> 01:34:25,800
Before, they were nobodies...

1466
01:34:26,089 --> 01:34:28,887
Now, they rule the country,
but for how long?

1467
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:32,559
Look at this passage...

1468
01:34:33,449 --> 01:34:34,802
It´s about you.

1469
01:34:35,089 --> 01:34:35,760
Me?

1470
01:34:36,049 --> 01:34:36,720
Yes...

1471
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:39,802
Look here...

1472
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:46,959
"Not content to monopolize
our stage and screen...

1473
01:34:47,249 --> 01:34:50,286
the Jews steal
our most beautiful women."

1474
01:35:01,089 --> 01:35:03,205
They sound cheerful.

1475
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:05,525
It´s a private party.

1476
01:35:31,129 --> 01:35:34,360
The director of the "Hebertot"
wants to meet you.

1477
01:36:00,969 --> 01:36:02,243
Miss Bataille...

1478
01:36:03,129 --> 01:36:04,198
Mr Daxiat...

1479
01:36:04,689 --> 01:36:07,840
Bravo! Congratulations.
You were fantastic!

1480
01:36:08,129 --> 01:36:10,484
Your article was outrageous!

1481
01:36:11,049 --> 01:36:13,199
Apologize to Mrs Steiner!

1482
01:36:13,489 --> 01:36:14,478
Certainly not!

1483
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:18,284
You´ll apologize
to the whole cast!

1484
01:36:18,569 --> 01:36:19,763
I won´t fight.

1485
01:36:19,969 --> 01:36:21,243
Let´s go outside.

1486
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:23,440
You´re insane!

1487
01:36:28,529 --> 01:36:30,838
This is absurd!

1488
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,961
You´re ridiculous!

1489
01:36:34,009 --> 01:36:36,318
Apologize to Mrs Steiner.

1490
01:36:39,089 --> 01:36:40,158
Apologize!

1491
01:36:40,449 --> 01:36:42,201
I won´t apologize for doing my job!

1492
01:36:48,449 --> 01:36:49,723
I won´t fight!

1493
01:36:50,009 --> 01:36:51,442
Yes, you will!

1494
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:54,004
I refuse to fight!

1495
01:36:57,009 --> 01:36:59,364
I´m not a prize-fighter:
I´m a journalist!

1496
01:37:16,449 --> 01:37:19,680
You´re irresponsible!
How could you do this to us?

1497
01:37:19,969 --> 01:37:21,641
What about my theatre?

1498
01:37:21,929 --> 01:37:24,363
What about our play?

1499
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:28,205
All you care about is your theatre!

1500
01:37:28,889 --> 01:37:30,447
"How are the bookings?"

1501
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:32,685
"Will we do a matinee at Xmas?"

1502
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:35,244
Yes, the theatres are full now,
but so are the jails!

1503
01:37:35,529 --> 01:37:38,646
Listen, we´ll go on
playing together.

1504
01:37:38,849 --> 01:37:41,044
But offstage,
don´t you dare speak to me!

1505
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:54,608
<i>"You´re lovely...</i>

1506
01:37:54,889 --> 01:37:57,608
so lovely
it´s painful to look at you."

1507
01:37:58,209 --> 01:37:59,642
"You said it was a joy."

1508
01:37:59,929 --> 01:38:01,328
"lt is a joy...

1509
01:38:02,249 --> 01:38:04,080
yet it´s painful."

1510
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:27,127
Look at this...

1511
01:38:28,209 --> 01:38:29,358
lt´s crazy!

1512
01:38:31,809 --> 01:38:34,004
Now that the play´s working out...

1513
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:35,678
you can relax.

1514
01:38:37,489 --> 01:38:39,559
Why look at me that way...

1515
01:38:40,449 --> 01:38:42,519
At times, I feel you hate me.

1516
01:38:43,489 --> 01:38:44,922
Not at all...

1517
01:38:45,689 --> 01:38:47,964
I´d be crazy to hate you!

1518
01:38:48,409 --> 01:38:52,368
You are a little crazy!
I know you by heart.

1519
01:38:52,649 --> 01:38:54,002
I know you too.

1520
01:38:55,809 --> 01:38:58,369
For me,
that play belongs to the past.

1521
01:38:58,649 --> 01:39:00,287
I´ve got a new project:

1522
01:39:00,889 --> 01:39:02,720
"The Magic Mountain"...

1523
01:39:05,289 --> 01:39:08,167
with a great role for you.
Are you listening?

1524
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:09,325
Yes.

1525
01:39:09,609 --> 01:39:11,201
It´s about a cruel woman...

1526
01:39:11,769 --> 01:39:12,724
Me... cruel?

1527
01:39:13,089 --> 01:39:14,807
No, the character!

1528
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:18,766
She´s gentle, tender,
in love, and yet...

1529
01:39:19,049 --> 01:39:21,438
she´s cruel.
She doesn´t mean to be...

1530
01:39:21,729 --> 01:39:23,003
She´s cruel despite herself.

1531
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:24,324
Cruel!

1532
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:26,247
It´ll be wonderful!

1533
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:29,282
No literature!
We´ll use everyday language.

1534
01:39:29,569 --> 01:39:31,719
I´ll use your own words, you see?

1535
01:39:33,209 --> 01:39:37,805
I see that from now on, everything
I say may be held against me.

1536
01:39:53,289 --> 01:39:54,324
Mr Daxiat?

1537
01:39:54,609 --> 01:39:55,883
Over there.

1538
01:40:15,129 --> 01:40:19,008
I was reluctant to come,
but with you, one doesn´t know...

1539
01:40:19,289 --> 01:40:21,803
whether it´s an appointment,
or a summons.

1540
01:40:22,089 --> 01:40:24,842
Apparently,
you misread my review...

1541
01:40:25,129 --> 01:40:26,801
Was that a review?

1542
01:40:27,209 --> 01:40:29,359
I´d say it was a vicious attack.

1543
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:34,120
Assuming it was, it wasn´t
aimed at you. On the contrary...

1544
01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:47,199
Across all the columns...

1545
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:49,998
And don´t forget
the exclamation mark.

1546
01:40:56,449 --> 01:40:59,964
I went to the theatre
expecting to see a play...

1547
01:41:00,249 --> 01:41:02,843
directed by Jean-Loup Cottins.

1548
01:41:03,569 --> 01:41:07,721
Instead, I saw a nondescript show...

1549
01:41:08,009 --> 01:41:09,078
with no style.

1550
01:41:09,369 --> 01:41:12,998
I felt you were merely a front...
and worse yet...

1551
01:41:13,289 --> 01:41:15,484
a mouth-piece for a fugitive.

1552
01:41:16,169 --> 01:41:19,241
Normally, I´d answer in kind.

1553
01:41:19,529 --> 01:41:20,723
But as it is, I´ll just go.

1554
01:41:20,929 --> 01:41:24,365
Wait...
I´ve got a proposition for you.

1555
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:26,605
Whatever it is, my answer is no!

1556
01:41:26,889 --> 01:41:29,449
I want you to help me save
the "Montmartre".

1557
01:41:32,009 --> 01:41:36,366
Steiner turned it over to his wife
before running away...

1558
01:41:36,649 --> 01:41:39,209
I found out
the transaction is illegal...

1559
01:41:39,489 --> 01:41:41,957
because the transfer
was ante-dated.

1560
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:46,963
This kind of transaction is labelled
a "fictitious aryanization".

1561
01:41:47,689 --> 01:41:49,441
Meaning what?

1562
01:41:50,009 --> 01:41:54,287
It means that legally, the theatre
doesn´t belong to anyone...

1563
01:41:54,569 --> 01:41:58,244
and the Germans can requisition it.
Unless...

1564
01:41:58,929 --> 01:42:00,123
Unless what?

1565
01:42:01,049 --> 01:42:05,327
Unless it is taken over
by someone they approve of.

1566
01:42:06,609 --> 01:42:08,964
Daxiat didn´t beat about the bush.

1567
01:42:09,249 --> 01:42:11,922
He proposed that they share
the management...

1568
01:42:12,729 --> 01:42:15,562
He´d select the plays.
Jean-Loup would direct.

1569
01:42:15,849 --> 01:42:17,999
I assume Jean-Loup refused.

1570
01:42:18,289 --> 01:42:20,166
No, he didn´t. He couldn´t.

1571
01:42:20,449 --> 01:42:22,838
All he could do
was to stall for time.

1572
01:42:23,849 --> 01:42:27,205
The only way to fight Daxiat
is to appeal to a higher-up

1573
01:42:27,409 --> 01:42:29,718
like Dr Dietrich.

1574
01:42:30,009 --> 01:42:32,239
But Jean-Loup refuses to do it.

1575
01:42:34,169 --> 01:42:35,841
Dr Dietrich, please.

1576
01:42:36,129 --> 01:42:38,484
On the first floor.

1577
01:42:46,249 --> 01:42:48,444
You´ll have to wait.

1578
01:43:21,809 --> 01:43:23,401
Dr Dietrich, please.

1579
01:43:23,689 --> 01:43:24,963
That´s impossible.

1580
01:43:25,249 --> 01:43:26,921
I called him.
He´s expecting me.

1581
01:43:27,209 --> 01:43:28,437
What´s your name?

1582
01:43:28,809 --> 01:43:30,162
Marion Steiner.

1583
01:43:30,649 --> 01:43:33,641
I see you´ve got a 5 p. m.
appointment...

1584
01:43:33,929 --> 01:43:35,408
but it´s impossible.

1585
01:43:35,689 --> 01:43:37,088
I don´t mind waiting.

1586
01:43:37,369 --> 01:43:39,485
I´m sorry.
It´s useless to wait:

1587
01:43:39,769 --> 01:43:42,237
Dr Dietrich left
for the Eastern front.

1588
01:43:42,529 --> 01:43:45,168
He was recalled for active duty.

1589
01:43:45,449 --> 01:43:46,882
Then, that´s that.

1590
01:43:52,529 --> 01:43:55,202
Mrs Steiner,
I´d like a word with you.

1591
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:06,798
I´m an admirer of yours...

1592
01:44:07,289 --> 01:44:09,166
I am Lieutenant Berger.

1593
01:44:10,449 --> 01:44:12,246
About Dr Dietrich...

1594
01:44:14,489 --> 01:44:19,358
He´s not on the Eastern front:
he shot himself last night.

1595
01:44:22,129 --> 01:44:23,244
It´s tragic...

1596
01:44:23,809 --> 01:44:25,925
He admired you enormously...

1597
01:44:26,409 --> 01:44:28,161
and so do I.

1598
01:44:29,209 --> 01:44:31,564
It´s an honor to shake your hand.

1599
01:47:20,129 --> 01:47:21,881
I must speak to you.

1600
01:47:22,169 --> 01:47:24,888
I´m sorry,
but it´s absolutely necessary.

1601
01:47:26,249 --> 01:47:27,887
I´m leaving the theatre.

1602
01:47:28,169 --> 01:47:31,081
But I´ll give you time to find
another actor.

1603
01:47:32,049 --> 01:47:34,279
I should have expected this.

1604
01:47:34,569 --> 01:47:37,163
No, it´s not what you think...

1605
01:47:39,049 --> 01:47:41,438
You can´t forgive my row
with Daxiat...

1606
01:47:41,729 --> 01:47:43,879
and I understand your reaction.

1607
01:47:46,049 --> 01:47:48,768
But even if you won´t speak to me,

1608
01:47:50,089 --> 01:47:52,000
we are a good acting-team.

1609
01:47:52,289 --> 01:47:56,441
I love the play and I love my role.
So it´s not that.

1610
01:47:56,729 --> 01:47:58,845
There´s no need to justify yourself.

1611
01:48:00,009 --> 01:48:02,728
I´m not even sure
we´ll replace you...

1612
01:48:03,009 --> 01:48:05,807
The theatre
may soon be shut down.

1613
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:09,761
I suppose you got a better offer
from Hebertot.

1614
01:48:10,049 --> 01:48:13,439
No, it´s not for Hebertot
or any other theatre.

1615
01:48:13,729 --> 01:48:16,926
I´m temporarily giving up acting...

1616
01:48:17,209 --> 01:48:20,007
to join the Resistance.

1617
01:48:24,569 --> 01:48:27,606
"Helena, I wish to speak to Mr Carl
in private."

1618
01:48:27,889 --> 01:48:29,607
"If it´s about my son...

1619
01:48:30,849 --> 01:48:33,124
I have the right to listen."

1620
01:48:34,809 --> 01:48:35,764
Civil Defense!

1621
01:48:36,049 --> 01:48:37,528
Cellar inspection!

1622
01:48:37,969 --> 01:48:39,527
"Mr Carl, isn´t it unfair?

1623
01:48:39,809 --> 01:48:42,369
As Eric´s mother,
I have the right to know."

1624
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:44,685
"Frankly, Dr Sanders...

1625
01:48:44,969 --> 01:48:46,482
this is embarrassing."

1626
01:48:47,209 --> 01:48:48,961
"Never mind, Mr Carl.

1627
01:48:49,249 --> 01:48:51,558
Helena, please do as I say."

1628
01:48:52,329 --> 01:48:55,162
"Since you insist, I´ll leave."

1629
01:48:56,529 --> 01:48:58,042
"This is what happened:

1630
01:48:58,769 --> 01:49:02,523
last October, she went for a walk...

1631
01:49:02,809 --> 01:49:04,401
and simply disappeared."

1632
01:49:04,689 --> 01:49:05,963
It´s for the cellar.

1633
01:49:06,249 --> 01:49:07,602
- The cellar?
- Yes.

1634
01:49:07,889 --> 01:49:09,004
Out of the question!

1635
01:49:09,289 --> 01:49:11,644
"When she came back,
she was unable...

1636
01:49:11,929 --> 01:49:13,442
to tell us where she´d been."

1637
01:49:14,329 --> 01:49:15,842
"Was she amnesic?"

1638
01:49:16,129 --> 01:49:17,278
"I suppose so."

1639
01:49:19,449 --> 01:49:21,440
Put them in a side box.

1640
01:49:23,609 --> 01:49:25,281
Follow me.

1641
01:49:26,169 --> 01:49:27,488
"You´re right...

1642
01:49:27,769 --> 01:49:31,887
Helena´s dependency on me
may seem peculiar.

1643
01:49:32,289 --> 01:49:35,486
She behaves like a child.

1644
01:49:36,249 --> 01:49:38,888
Her gratitude is excessive."

1645
01:49:40,689 --> 01:49:42,884
"At times, she seems too humble."

1646
01:49:43,169 --> 01:49:46,366
"Why she feels guilty,
I don´t know.

1647
01:49:47,289 --> 01:49:50,087
But whatever it is, it leads her...

1648
01:49:50,369 --> 01:49:53,088
to seek the affection
of her inferiors:

1649
01:49:53,369 --> 01:49:56,566
Charles-Henri
was bewildered by it.

1650
01:49:56,849 --> 01:49:58,680
And then the tragedy occured."

1651
01:49:59,809 --> 01:50:01,208
"What tragedy?"

1652
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:11,401
"I know Dr Sanders...

1653
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:14,806
came back before
Charles-Henri´s death!"

1654
01:50:23,169 --> 01:50:24,363
D´you know them?

1655
01:50:24,649 --> 01:50:25,604
Civil Defense.

1656
01:50:25,889 --> 01:50:28,608
No, they´re Gestapo men.
I know one of them.

1657
01:50:29,049 --> 01:50:30,118
Gestapo?

1658
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:32,121
- Will you help me?
- Yes.

1659
01:50:32,409 --> 01:50:33,637
But no questions!

1660
01:50:35,089 --> 01:50:36,488
"Love is painful.

1661
01:50:36,769 --> 01:50:39,283
Like a bird of prey,
it hovers over us...

1662
01:50:39,569 --> 01:50:41,082
as if to threaten us.

1663
01:50:41,369 --> 01:50:44,008
But it is also a promise
of happiness.

1664
01:50:45,729 --> 01:50:47,640
You´re so lovely, Helena...

1665
01:50:48,409 --> 01:50:50,798
that it´s painful to look at you."

1666
01:50:52,089 --> 01:50:53,363
"You said it was a joy."

1667
01:50:53,649 --> 01:50:55,924
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1668
01:51:04,649 --> 01:51:06,401
No curtain calls tonight.

1669
01:51:08,649 --> 01:51:09,764
What´s up?

1670
01:51:10,049 --> 01:51:12,643
It´s Civil Defense...
to inspect the cellar.

1671
01:51:31,969 --> 01:51:34,005
This is Bernard Granger.

1672
01:51:34,289 --> 01:51:36,007
Bernard... my husband.

1673
01:51:47,809 --> 01:51:51,438
Don´t just stand there! You´ve got
to conceal all this and hide!

1674
01:51:58,049 --> 01:52:00,040
Take us to the cellar!

1675
01:52:00,329 --> 01:52:03,207
No... wait for Mrs Steiner.

1676
01:52:05,489 --> 01:52:06,444
I´m going in.

1677
01:52:06,729 --> 01:52:08,321
No, she´s not dressed.

1678
01:52:08,609 --> 01:52:10,645
Let´s be gentlemanly.

1679
01:52:12,369 --> 01:52:13,927
So I made a mistake!

1680
01:52:14,769 --> 01:52:16,282
Be patient.

1681
01:52:16,569 --> 01:52:18,048
I´ll be right out.

1682
01:52:27,569 --> 01:52:30,641
I never go down there.
It´s probably full of rats.

1683
01:52:30,849 --> 01:52:32,328
Have you got the key?

1684
01:52:33,729 --> 01:52:35,606
Watch your heads!

1685
01:52:50,329 --> 01:52:53,878
Seems to me it´s not deep enough
for a shelter.

1686
01:52:54,169 --> 01:52:57,127
There´s about 8"
between the ceiling and the yard.

1687
01:53:01,889 --> 01:53:02,719
What´s this?

1688
01:53:03,009 --> 01:53:05,125
We used it in "The Cherry Orchard".

1689
01:53:06,569 --> 01:53:08,924
There´s only room for 40 people.

1690
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:12,839
In any case,
it´s been condemned since 39.

1691
01:53:14,489 --> 01:53:17,003
During air-raids,
we use the subway.

1692
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:20,042
The local station is open all night.

1693
01:53:22,689 --> 01:53:26,568
Can we use that staircase
for firewood?

1694
01:53:36,289 --> 01:53:38,325
There are so many air-raids now...

1695
01:53:38,609 --> 01:53:40,804
nobody bothers to go down.

1696
01:53:44,209 --> 01:53:47,440
Well, they cleared out...
till the next time.

1697
01:53:48,969 --> 01:53:51,085
This is a hell of a life!

1698
01:53:51,369 --> 01:53:53,200
It´s a life... it´s my life.

1699
01:53:54,289 --> 01:53:56,723
Can´t you find
a better hiding place?

1700
01:53:57,609 --> 01:54:00,407
I don´t want one.
This is my place...

1701
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:05,239
and this is where I stay!

1702
01:54:06,689 --> 01:54:09,203
My wife is beautiful,
isn´t she?

1703
01:54:11,769 --> 01:54:13,646
Let me ask you a question:

1704
01:54:14,369 --> 01:54:18,044
she´s in love with you,
but do you love her?

1705
01:54:24,529 --> 01:54:26,838
"I´m coming to love and it hurts.

1706
01:54:24,889 --> 01:54:27,198
I´m coming to love and it hurts.

1707
01:54:28,929 --> 01:54:30,157
Is love painful?"

1708
01:54:30,449 --> 01:54:32,087
"Yes, love is painful.

1709
01:54:32,369 --> 01:54:34,883
Like birds of prey,
it hovers over us...

1710
01:54:35,169 --> 01:54:37,239
as if to threaten us.

1711
01:54:37,529 --> 01:54:39,724
But it is a promise of happiness.

1712
01:54:44,729 --> 01:54:46,208
You´re so lovely...

1713
01:54:46,769 --> 01:54:49,442
that it´s painful to look at you."

1714
01:54:50,249 --> 01:54:51,967
"You said it was a joy."

1715
01:54:52,249 --> 01:54:54,763
"It is a joy and it´s painful."

1716
01:55:04,489 --> 01:55:07,162
Bernard, may I ask you something?

1717
01:55:08,409 --> 01:55:11,287
Were you going to leave
without saying goodbye?

1718
01:55:11,569 --> 01:55:12,922
Of course not...

1719
01:55:14,249 --> 01:55:16,888
I was waiting
for the rehearsal to end.

1720
01:55:17,169 --> 01:55:19,558
Well, it´s over now. It was sad...

1721
01:55:20,529 --> 01:55:21,962
I watched it.

1722
01:55:22,449 --> 01:55:23,120
Well?

1723
01:55:23,409 --> 01:55:24,603
He was good.

1724
01:55:25,169 --> 01:55:28,161
It´s a lesson in humility:
we´re all expendable.

1725
01:55:32,769 --> 01:55:35,363
Well, goodbye Bernard...

1726
01:55:56,529 --> 01:55:59,646
I felt you were interested
in all women...

1727
01:55:59,929 --> 01:56:01,442
except for me.

1728
01:56:01,729 --> 01:56:03,481
First, it´s not all women...

1729
01:56:04,809 --> 01:56:06,606
and you intimidated me.

1730
01:56:06,889 --> 01:56:09,244
You seemed to disapprove of me.

1731
01:56:09,529 --> 01:56:12,248
At times,
you were downright hostile.

1732
01:56:12,689 --> 01:56:14,088
Hostile?

1733
01:56:14,369 --> 01:56:16,564
Yes, I felt you were judging me.

1734
01:56:16,849 --> 01:56:17,998
It´s just the opposite!

1735
01:56:18,929 --> 01:56:21,727
I was so attracted to you...

1736
01:56:23,369 --> 01:56:27,442
that I covered up
so nobody would notice...

1737
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:30,560
and I made you hate me.

1738
01:56:30,849 --> 01:56:33,317
That´s not true.
I never hated you.

1739
01:56:35,369 --> 01:56:38,805
But why did you act so distant
after you´d kissed me?

1740
01:56:39,369 --> 01:56:41,166
All actors kiss each other.

1741
01:56:41,449 --> 01:56:43,087
But not on the mouth!

1742
01:56:43,849 --> 01:56:45,919
I kissed you on the mouth?

1743
01:56:46,329 --> 01:56:47,159
Yes...

1744
01:56:48,129 --> 01:56:51,519
on opening night.

1745
01:56:52,289 --> 01:56:54,086
I couldn´t have!

1746
01:56:54,369 --> 01:56:56,837
You kissed me on the mouth!

1747
01:56:59,649 --> 01:57:01,879
I know: you see two women in me.

1748
01:57:03,009 --> 01:57:03,919
I do:

1749
01:57:06,809 --> 01:57:08,083
I see two women in you:

1750
01:57:09,049 --> 01:57:10,482
one who no longer
loves her husband...

1751
01:57:10,769 --> 01:57:11,884
No, don´t...

1752
01:57:14,409 --> 01:57:16,604
You wouldn´t understand.

1753
01:57:27,569 --> 01:57:29,321
Don´t forget your make-up.

1754
01:57:29,729 --> 01:57:31,048
I won´t need it.

1755
01:57:32,569 --> 01:57:34,400
I´ll leave it for my successor.

1756
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:38,440
I won´t be using any make-up.

1757
01:57:39,409 --> 01:57:41,684
But you may need a disguise.

1758
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:44,117
Forgive me...

1759
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:23,963
<i>And so, Lucien Ballard
took over the part of Carl.</i>

1760
01:58:29,809 --> 01:58:31,367
<i>Nadine Marsac, now famous,</i>

1761
01:58:31,569 --> 01:58:34,163
<i>rushes off
right after her final lines.</i>

1762
01:58:34,369 --> 01:58:37,327
<i>A chauffeur drives her
to the studios...</i>

1763
01:58:37,609 --> 01:58:40,601
<i>where they´re shooting
"Angels of Mercy" at night.</i>

1764
01:58:41,329 --> 01:58:44,685
<i>Arlette Guillaume
is the art director of the film.</i>

1765
01:58:46,649 --> 01:58:49,322
<i>In June 1944,
the Allies land in Normandy.</i>

1766
01:58:49,609 --> 01:58:51,839
<i>Despite the daily hardships...</i>

1767
01:58:52,129 --> 01:58:55,405
<i>Parisians keep on crowding
the theatres.</i>

1768
01:59:00,089 --> 01:59:00,965
<i>One night...</i>

1769
01:59:01,249 --> 01:59:02,807
<i>ignoring the sirens...</i>

1770
01:59:03,089 --> 01:59:05,045
<i>the audience stood outside...</i>

1771
01:59:05,329 --> 01:59:08,366
<i>to watch the ballet
of the RAF planes in the sky.</i>

1772
01:59:18,809 --> 01:59:21,767
<i>Many theatres are shut down
for lack of electricity.</i>

1773
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:26,323
<i>Thanks to Raymond´s ingenuity,
the "Montmartre" remains open.</i>

1774
01:59:27,569 --> 01:59:31,244
<i>He´s replaced the footlights
by auto headlights</i>

1775
01:59:38,129 --> 01:59:40,245
<i>Germany´s defeat
is now inevitable.</i>

1776
01:59:40,529 --> 01:59:43,601
<i>After 813 days and nights
in his dark cellar...</i>

1777
01:59:43,889 --> 01:59:46,039
<i>Lucas Steiner is impatient
to see daylight.</i>

1778
01:59:47,249 --> 01:59:48,443
<i>The street...</i>

1779
01:59:48,769 --> 01:59:52,284
<i>is a scene of confusion
and sporadic shooting.</i>

1780
02:00:00,849 --> 02:00:01,440
No...

1781
02:00:01,729 --> 02:00:03,048
Not there!

1782
02:00:16,329 --> 02:00:18,604
<i>It´s a hectic period for Jean-Loup.</i>

1783
02:00:18,889 --> 02:00:20,447
<i>Arrested by the F.F.I.,</i>

1784
02:00:20,729 --> 02:00:23,801
<i>he is released
thanks to his connections...</i>

1785
02:00:24,089 --> 02:00:27,286
<i>but re-arrested the next day
because of his connections.</i>

1786
02:00:29,809 --> 02:00:32,642
<i>As for Daxiat,
he is a man on the run.</i>

1787
02:00:34,409 --> 02:00:37,128
<i>The one-time press lord
is now a pariah.</i>

1788
02:00:37,409 --> 02:00:39,877
<i>He´s survived the bombing
of Hamburg.</i>

1789
02:00:40,169 --> 02:00:42,364
<i>After following Petain to Germany...</i>

1790
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:45,561
<i>he reaches Spain
via a series of monasteries.</i>

1791
02:00:45,849 --> 02:00:47,282
<i>Sentenced to death in absentia,</i>

1792
02:00:47,489 --> 02:00:50,208
<i>he will die of a cancer
in the ´60´s.</i>

1793
02:00:51,609 --> 02:00:54,077
<i>But let us go back
to the summer of 1944...</i>

1794
02:00:54,369 --> 02:00:56,200
<i>and to our story.</i>

1795
02:01:42,689 --> 02:01:44,839
I tried to forget you. I couldn´t.

1796
02:01:45,129 --> 02:01:48,007
If not for your pride,
I´d have come sooner.

1797
02:01:48,289 --> 02:01:51,759
You´d have had to make up
a lie each time you came.

1798
02:01:52,049 --> 02:01:54,802
Why should I lie? And to whom?
He´s dead now.

1799
02:01:55,569 --> 02:01:57,287
But you´ve got your career...

1800
02:01:57,569 --> 02:02:01,482
No. I realized I didn´t care
about it anymore...

1801
02:02:01,849 --> 02:02:03,521
I gave it all up.

1802
02:02:04,449 --> 02:02:07,009
The only thing that matters to me...

1803
02:02:07,289 --> 02:02:10,326
is to be with you,
to get you out of here.

1804
02:02:10,609 --> 02:02:12,440
We can start all over again.

1805
02:02:12,729 --> 02:02:14,128
No we can´t.

1806
02:02:14,569 --> 02:02:17,402
There was never anything...

1807
02:02:17,769 --> 02:02:18,918
anything real...

1808
02:02:19,209 --> 02:02:20,244
between us.

1809
02:02:20,529 --> 02:02:21,598
I toyed with the idea...

1810
02:02:21,889 --> 02:02:24,164
but I never really loved you.

1811
02:02:25,449 --> 02:02:27,838
It was an abstract notion.

1812
02:02:28,649 --> 02:02:31,880
You believed in it
because I believed it myself.

1813
02:02:32,409 --> 02:02:36,038
I never stopped thinking of you...
not even for a day.

1814
02:02:36,409 --> 02:02:37,967
I thought of you too...

1815
02:02:38,249 --> 02:02:39,921
but less and less often.

1816
02:02:40,129 --> 02:02:42,438
And now, I don´t know
what you´re doing here.

1817
02:02:42,649 --> 02:02:45,766
I´ve almost forgotten your name...

1818
02:02:47,169 --> 02:02:51,367
I barely remember
the way you look.

1819
02:02:51,889 --> 02:02:53,083
Go away!

1820
02:02:57,129 --> 02:02:59,438
Listen to me.
Listen carefully.

1821
02:02:59,729 --> 02:03:01,481
It takes two to love...

1822
02:03:01,849 --> 02:03:05,159
as it takes two to hate.
And I´ll go on loving you.

1823
02:03:05,969 --> 02:03:09,598
You make my heart beat faster.
Nothing else matters to me.

1824
02:03:11,289 --> 02:03:12,483
Goodbye.

1825
02:03:53,849 --> 02:03:55,123
There´s Steiner!

1826
02:03:58,009 --> 02:03:58,885
He´s back!

1827
02:06:04,489 --> 02:06:06,684
