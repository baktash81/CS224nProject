1
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,259
<i>This, it was given me to know:</i>

2
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,458
<i>That many worlds have been enslaved</i>
<i>by the Beast and his army, the Slayers.</i>

3
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,209
<i>And this, too, was given me to know:</i>

4
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,172
<i>That the Beast would come to our world,</i>
<i>the world of Krull...</i>

5
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,890
<i>... and his Black Fortress would be seen</i>
<i>in the land...</i>

6
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,693
<i>... that the smoke of burning villages</i>
<i>would darken the sky...</i>

7
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,377
<i>... and the cries of the dying echo</i>
<i>through deserted valleys.</i>

8
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,694
<i>But one thing I cannot know:</i>

9
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,249
<i>Whether the prophecy be true...</i>

10
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,290
<i>... that a girl of ancient name</i>
<i>shall become queen...</i>

11
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,298
<i>... that she shall choose a king, and that</i>
<i>together they shall rule our world...</i>

12
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>... and that their son shall rule the galaxy.</i>

13
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,649
Father!

14
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,890
Colwyn should have been here by now.

15
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,649
<i>He may be forced to travel</i>
<i>through the forests and the stone country.</i>

16
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,698
<i>All the passes and the roads</i>
<i>are held by the Slayers.</i>

17
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,898
<i>Colwyn may not get through.</i>

18
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,779
<i>That would please you?</i>

19
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,259
<i>I sent men to help.</i>

20
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,216
<i>But I see no reason for an alliance</i>
<i>with our ancient enemies.</i>

21
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,374
<i>Father, the invaders</i>
<i>are destroying our world.</i>

22
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,492
<i>We must have the alliance.</i>

23
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,652
<i>Only if we're united,</i>
<i>do we stand a chance against them.</i>

24
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,534
<i>Then, I'll make a treaty with King Turold.</i>

25
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,739
<i>It's not necessary for you to marry his son.</i>

26
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,574
<i>It's the only way to guarantee the alliance.</i>

27
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,691
<i>The marriage is my choice.</i>

28
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,979
If it were anyone but Turold's son.

29
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,258
Colwyn is a great fighter.

30
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,611
Good fighters make bad husbands.

31
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,735
Perhaps.

32
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,938
Horsemen approaching!

33
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,293
Open the gate!

34
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,816
We sent to you for help. None came.

35
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,898
Twenty men were despatched to you.

36
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,016
We've lost 300 getting here.

37
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,369
I didn't choose this marriage, Turold.

38
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,133
Nor did I, Eirig.

39
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,492
I chose it! Your daughter chose it.
It'll be done.

40
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,376
And you'll lead this army with mine
against the Slayers?

41
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,048
Whatever army I have,
I'll lead against them...

42
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,938
...until I've won or I'm dead.

43
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,378
I have chosen well.

44
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,649
So have I.

45
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,498
Your journey was hard?

46
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,894
But necessary.

47
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,977
- It may already be too late.
- It's not too late.

48
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,129
Is this where the ceremony will be?

49
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,019
Tonight at moonrise.

50
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,250
My father says that good fighters
make bad husbands.

51
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,016
- That depends.
- On what?

52
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,177
On whether you expect a husband
to follow you around...

53
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,211
...jump every time you clap your hands.

54
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,972
Wouldn't you jump for me?

55
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,256
No, of course not. You're a warrior.

56
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,893
From this day, my kingdom is no more.

57
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,416
Nor mine.

58
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,572
A single kingdom under our children.

59
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,049
Agreed.

60
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,333
I give fire to water.

61
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,652
It will not return, except from the hand
of the woman I choose as my wife.

62
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,851
I take fire from water.

63
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,932
I give it only to the man
whom I choose as my husband.

64
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,536
Take the fire from my hand.

65
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,212
Call the roll, guards!

66
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,733
- Slayers!
- Arm yourselves!

67
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,778
- We'll fight together.
- No. Is there a safe way out?

68
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,249
- An underground passage.
- Come on!

69
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,379
My place is with you.

70
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,731
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

71
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,809
Then go.

72
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,616
Colwyn, hurry back to me.

73
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,849
Everyone in the centre of the room,
get back!

74
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,369
Take it!

75
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,735
Here!

76
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,409
Colwyn!

77
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,569
Lyssa!

78
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,969
Colwyn!

79
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,095
Colwyn!

80
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,290
Father!

81
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,416
Lyssa!

82
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,649
She's alive.

83
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,015
Where?

84
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,369
Stay still!

85
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,935
Where?

86
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,216
For now, beyond your reach.

87
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,249
Who are you?

88
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,015
I am Ynyr.

89
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,209
The old one.

90
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,291
Well, not as old as all that.

91
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,056
You've come down
from the Granite Mountains.

92
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,017
Yes. I am needed now.

93
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,049
Father!

94
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,491
There's no time now for grief.

95
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,939
You haven't lost a father
and a bride on the same day.

96
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,620
Nor have I become king on that day.

97
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,178
I have no kingdom.

98
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,414
Your kingdom may be greater
than you know.

99
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,259
I give it to you, old man,
and welcome to it.

100
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,738
I came to find a king...

101
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,250
...and I find a boy instead.

102
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,050
Lyssa?

103
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,974
They will hold her in the Black Fortress.

104
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,538
Can you lead me to it?

105
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,379
You must have help.

106
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,332
I'll find men on the way.

107
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,936
In the Fortress,
you will face more than the Slayers.

108
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,572
You will face the Beast,
who is their leader.

109
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,259
He can be killed.

110
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,175
Perhaps.

111
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,815
But no man has ever seen him and lived.

112
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,373
You will need more than men and swords.

113
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,938
You will need the power of the Glaive.

114
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,129
The Glaive is nothing
but an ancient symbol.

115
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,858
It doesn't really exist.

116
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,019
It exists, up there.

117
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,251
In a cave on the highest peak.

118
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,377
Without the Glaive,
you will never be able to reach Lyssa.

119
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,295
I need weapons, not symbols.

120
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,454
Once, the Glaive was
a very powerful weapon.

121
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,338
It can be so again.

122
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,729
But only in the hands of the right man.

123
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,052
For only the right man
can retrieve the Glaive.

124
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,889
Am I that man?

125
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,253
I wish I knew.

126
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,733
I cannot go with you.

127
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,412
Don't worry. If it's there,
I'll come back with it.

128
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,650
If you do not come back with it...

129
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,696
...you'll not come back at all.

130
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,172
<i>You have been brought here for a marriage.</i>

131
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,255
<i>I am the king you will choose.</i>

132
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,889
Do not use it until you need it.

133
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,568
- How will I know when?
- You'll know.

134
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,338
If you lead me to the Black Fortress,
I'll use it soon enough.

135
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,138
That will not be so easy.

136
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,610
At each sunrise, the Black Fortress moves.

137
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,612
Sometimes it is in the mountains,
sometimes in the desert...

138
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,213
...sometimes in the sea.

139
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,212
Never the same place twice.

140
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,814
But you told me you knew where to find it!

141
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,333
There are kingly virtues other than bravery.

142
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,858
Courtesy is one of them.

143
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,533
I'm sorry.

144
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,771
It's the thought of Lyssa there.

145
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,811
I, too, was young...

146
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,169
...once.

147
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,050
I, too, loved as you do.

148
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,658
But your love will be...

149
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,333
...luckier than mine.

150
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,937
What I told you is that I knew
how to find the Fortress...

151
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,093
...and that is by seeking the vision
of the blind Emerald Seer.

152
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,818
But his place isn't known either.

153
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,097
It is known to me.
It is a day's journey from here. Come.

154
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,975
Help!

155
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,253
Help! I'm drowning!

156
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,254
This might have been quicksand!

157
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,814
I might have been sucked to my death
while you stood there gawking!

158
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,059
Where is this place?

159
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,935
The forest near the Granite Mountains.

160
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,451
Blast! 1,000 miles off course.

161
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,334
I was rushed.

162
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,930
There was a difference of opinion
concerning a gooseberry pie.

163
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,377
The man left it sitting on his windowsill.

164
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,810
- What did he expect?
- Perhaps he expected to eat it.

165
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,968
For that rudeness, lout,
I think I'll turn you into a bat.

166
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,929
Might teach you some manners
to hang upside down for an hour or two.

167
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,248
The Hill People lack the power to do harm.

168
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,930
We shall see about that, old man.
We'll see about that!

169
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,336
No, that's a recipe for hot fudge sauce.

170
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,056
It'll have to be a goose.

171
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,936
Fat and ugly.

172
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,812
Very fat. Very ugly.

173
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,130
From that, you see what I could've done
to you if I were a vengeful man.

174
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,537
You may leave me now.

175
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,971
Dear, dear. Let me see now<i>...</i>

176
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,219
The forest is not safe.
You'd best travel with us!

177
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,452
Me, travel with you?
Do you know who I am?

178
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,770
No.

179
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,651
I am Ergo the Magnificent.
Short in stature, tall in power...

180
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,573
...narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

181
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,369
And I do not travel with peasants
and beggars. Goodbye.

182
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,699
Wait! Wait for me!

183
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,810
I've just remembered
I have urgent business in this direction.

184
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,128
What business?

185
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,493
Staying alive.

186
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,412
<i>I will allow you to go</i>
<i>wherever you please within these walls.</i>

187
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,453
<i>For this is the palace from which you</i>
<i>will rule this world and countless others.</i>

188
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,852
<i>You cannot escape me.</i>
<i>You will be my queen.</i>

189
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,372
You're no great chooser of roads, old man.

190
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,248
This way will save us half a day's travel.

191
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,335
Robbers.

192
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,894
They're men, we don't know yet
whether they're robbers.

193
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,858
Faces that ugly
could only belong to robbers.

194
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,488
Don't worry. I'll turn them all into pigs.

195
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,455
You're surrounded by 100 men!

196
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,298
100 is not enough!

197
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,177
What have we here? A fighter!

198
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,131
Besides, you're short about 90 men.

199
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,450
Let's just kill them and be done with it.

200
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,499
Soft, Rhun! I don't kill men
without good reason.

201
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,529
Nor do I. And be thankful for it.

202
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,699
You're escaped prisoners.

203
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,695
Every one. Slaves, bandits,
fighters and brawlers.

204
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,389
Desperate men.

205
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,153
- As desperate as you'll ever see.
- Good.

206
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,190
Those are the kind of men I need.

207
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,709
You need?

208
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,110
Well, see, these men
follow no man but me...

209
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,472
...and I follow no man at all.

210
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,270
- Would you follow a king?
- A king?

211
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,479
There are many lunatics wandering
through the country claiming to be kings.

212
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,913
Would you follow a king
to the Black Fortress?

213
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,031
Now I know you're a lunatic.

214
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,588
I wouldn't follow my own father
to the Black Fortress.

215
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,638
- Lf he could find it!
- He wouldn't be so foolish.

216
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,269
Is it foolish to defend your world?
To fight for your homes and families?

217
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,238
If the invaders conquer,
you'll be slaves with the rest of us.

218
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,959
Noble sentiments, but we fight for profit.

219
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,749
- You know what I mean?
- The profit's freedom. And fame.

220
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,951
Freedom? But we have it.

221
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,798
And fame, it's an empty purse.

222
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,351
Count it, go broke...

223
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,030
...eat it, go hungry...

224
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,038
...seek it and go mad.

225
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,919
That is true.

226
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,229
But this fame and this freedom
you could leave to your sons.

227
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,958
How did you know I had sons?

228
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,999
If the Slayers conquer Krull,
your sons will be enslaved forever.

229
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,434
I have no sons, but I will go with you.

230
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,191
The boy shames you all.

231
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,269
Only the king and the lord marshal
have the keys to these manacles.

232
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,519
- You don't look like a lord marshal.
- No.

233
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,639
You look about the right age
to be Turold's son.

234
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,433
The exact age.

235
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,912
Torquil, you're growing old.
Your brain's softening.

236
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,870
Nine men like you are worth an army.

237
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,668
If we succeed, unlock them.
Otherwise, I'll die with them.

238
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,432
Well, you heard him! We're now an army!

239
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,839
An unpaid army.

240
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,433
You got a problem, Rhun?

241
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,671
Can't a man even talk to himself
without being interrupted?

242
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,916
Let's go!

243
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,037
- Come along!
- Nennog! Move!

244
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,519
Gooseberries!

245
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,875
Ergo!

246
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,314
Ynyr, help!

247
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,356
Horrible! There was
a terrible creature over there.

248
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,313
And over there,
a creature with only one eye.

249
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,391
- One eye?
- A Cyclops.

250
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,750
He was aiming a spear straight at me.

251
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,154
Had it been so, you would now be dead.
He was aiming at a Slayer...

252
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,152
...for they have ancient hatred
between them.

253
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,469
Long ago, his ancestors lived
in a world far from Krull.

254
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,154
And had...

255
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,554
...two eyes like other men.

256
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,594
Then they made a bargain with the Beast
who is the leader of the Slayers.

257
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,116
They gave up one of their eyes
in exchange for the power...

258
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,037
...to see into the future.
But they were cheated.

259
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,398
For the only future
they are permitted to see...

260
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,078
...is the time of their own death.

261
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,676
They're sad, solitary creatures,
born to know...

262
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,272
...the day they will die.

263
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,072
Today would have been my day,
if it hadn't been for him.

264
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,916
Up you go.

265
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,079
We three will go on.
The rest will remain here.

266
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,159
We four will go on. I'm not staying behind
with these criminals!

267
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,958
We four will go.

268
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,308
He marches us
towards a solid face of rock.

269
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,035
The man has raisins in his braincase.

270
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,710
I recognise an old friend.

271
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,594
Mad. They're all mad!

272
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,116
We seek the Black Fortress.

273
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,869
Such a vision will be opposed.
Who seeks it?

274
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,639
The new king.

275
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,118
With an old voice?

276
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,478
You know the voice?

277
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,759
Yes, my friend.

278
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,915
We're trying to find the...

279
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,708
I will seek the Fortress for you.

280
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,796
- Got any sugarballs?
- No.

281
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,188
- Gumdrops?
- No.

282
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,238
What kind of boy are you?
Boys always have candy.

283
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,552
I have a cinnamon bar.

284
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,192
Share and share alike.

285
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,075
I am Ergo the Magnificent.

286
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,036
Short in stature, tall in power,
narrow of purpose and wide of vision.

287
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,038
That is very impressive.

288
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,788
I should hope so.

289
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,949
I'm Titch.

290
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,840
That's not impressive, but adequate.

291
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,078
The Black Fortress.

292
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,559
Where is it?

293
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,839
Are you all right?

294
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,589
Yes.

295
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,158
The Beast does not like
curious Seers poking into his affairs.

296
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,918
His power is too great
for you to overcome?

297
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,433
Yes. Here. But there is one place
where his power cannot reach.

298
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,634
The Emerald Temple.

299
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,951
Yes. In that place,
he cannot oppose my vision.

300
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,551
Will you travel there with us?

301
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,752
It is in the Great Swamp:
A treacherous place.

302
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,958
Our need is great.

303
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,353
The Temple is at the centre of the Swamp,
where three trees grow as one.

304
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,119
How can anything grow in that place?
It smells of death.

305
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,555
Death and power are close cousins.

306
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,474
Don't think I like your relatives, old man.

307
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,988
Have a look.

308
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,032
The profit of this journey.

309
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,718
They're worth a fortune.

310
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,749
Maybe. To someone
who's very nearsighted.

311
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:58,995
What?

312
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,798
But they were emeralds.

313
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,752
Hey, Rhun, emeralds.

314
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,031
I swear it! They were emeralds!

315
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,597
Rocks in our pockets and gravestones
above our heads is all we'll get from this.

316
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,594
Slayers!

317
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,957
- From the lake!
- Take cover!

318
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,036
- Over here!
- Get down.

319
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,839
Get down there!

320
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,438
Quick, over there!

321
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,549
Colwyn!

322
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,788
Over here!

323
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,152
That's the second time
you've saved my life.

324
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,074
- I am Ergo.
- The Magnificent.

325
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,393
Hasn't he got a name?

326
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,159
His name is Rell.

327
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,756
He visits the Seer sometimes.
He doesn't speak much.

328
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,913
So I've noticed. Except to be sarcastic
to people who wish to be friends.

329
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,357
Or jest with those
who already are his friends.

330
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,960
My name is no jest, beanpole. It's nice
to have a short name if you're 20 feet tall...

331
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,231
...but small people need large names
to give them weight.

332
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,032
Your actions give you weight, my friend.
I saw you save the boy from a spear.

333
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,152
That's what friends are supposed
to do for each other.

334
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,549
Quite so.

335
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,949
You've been with us for a long way now.

336
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,959
Since the beginning. When I learned
that the Old One had come down...

337
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,190
...I knew that the time had come.

338
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,152
Join us, then. All men need company.

339
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,949
Yes.

340
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,354
All men.

341
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,269
That way.

342
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,274
If I had my wish,
I'd be out of this gloomy place right away.

343
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,271
If I really had my wish,
I'd be sitting on top of a gooseberry pie...

344
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,271
...as big as a mountain.

345
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,876
No, that's a bit greedy.
I'll settle for one as big as a house.

346
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,518
I'd wish for a puppy.

347
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:13,474
Only one puppy? If you're wishing,
why not wish for 100?

348
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,749
I only want one.

349
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,992
That's a foolish wish.
And you, Rell, what would you wish for?

350
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,429
Ignorance.

351
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,796
No!

352
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,828
- Nennog!
- Help!

353
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,035
Help him!

354
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,792
The ground. It's sinking!

355
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,075
It is the power of the Beast.

356
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,511
- Link up! Make a chain!
- Help! Get me out!

357
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,158
Rhun, get hold of him!

358
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,468
Hurry!

359
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,828
- Hang on!
- Pull!

360
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,038
Give me the axe!

361
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,836
Here!

362
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,629
Pull!

363
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,155
Pull!

364
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,199
I'm slipping!

365
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,795
Pull it!

366
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,315
Menno!

367
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,029
Help me!

368
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,713
Get me out! Help me!

369
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,478
Menno! Keep still! Don't struggle!

370
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,069
Hold on!

371
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,355
Reach!

372
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,592
Keep still, Menno!

373
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,159
Don't struggle!

374
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,995
Pull!

375
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,829
Menno!

376
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,838
Is that you, Titch?

377
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,469
- How far to the Temple?
- Not far now.

378
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,595
Stay here, make sure
we're not being followed.

379
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,910
- I will stay.
- Be careful.

380
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,548
Thank you.

381
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,280
I'll lead the Seer. Titch, you go ahead.

382
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,478
Thank you, brother.

383
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,915
I'll lead the Seer. You go ahead with Titch.

384
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,913
- This way?
- No.

385
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,109
You sure?

386
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,558
I recognise this tree.

387
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,836
I recognise the place now.

388
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,916
We're in sight of the trees, brother.

389
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,072
He who seeks the knowledge
must lead me.

390
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,791
No one else may approach.

391
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,400
Here is the knowledge you seek.

392
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,193
The Beast has many weapons.
This was one of them.

393
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,159
The Changeling.

394
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,319
How did you know?

395
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,074
I found the Seer's body in the quicksand.

396
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,198
He gave his life for us.

397
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,878
He was my only family.

398
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,438
We're your family now.

399
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,024
Now we have no way
to find the Black Fortress.

400
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,706
There is one who might help.

401
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:37,859
Who?

402
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,263
The Widow of the Web.

403
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,986
That creature helps no one.
And none who go there return.

404
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:47,068
- She has great powers.
- Yeah, to kill.

405
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:52,421
She may not kill me, for I know her name.

406
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,429
Her name is Death.

407
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:01,106
She had another name once.
An ancient and powerful name.

408
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,506
We all risk our lives on this journey.
My risk is no greater than yours.

409
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,664
I must try.

410
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,989
Where are my papers?

411
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:59,865
Blast, I really must get organised
one of these days.

412
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,229
Puppy!

413
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,263
Where's Ergo?

414
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,343
He'll be back soon.

415
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,620
From here, I go on alone.

416
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,027
- I'm going with you.
- No.

417
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:43,066
If two approach,
she would certainly kill both.

418
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,788
Alone, I may have a chance.

419
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,906
Each to his fate, Colwyn.

420
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:49,580
Yeah.

421
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:54,509
Yes, each to his fate.

422
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:06,703
If I'm not back by morning...

423
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:09,549
...you'll know mine.

424
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,669
We stay here.

425
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,184
I still say it was a foolish wish.

426
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:45,140
We have no food,
and the men are too tired to hunt.

427
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,143
- Hey, Kegan.
- Hello.

428
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,302
Doesn't one of your wives
live in a village near here?

429
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,987
Lona. No, she moved down to the river.

430
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,545
How many wives does he have?

431
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,104
About seven or eight, at the last count.

432
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:07,546
He's a travelling man, you see.

433
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,868
He covers a lot of ground.

434
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:11,499
Merith.

435
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:16,509
She lives in a village
at the edge of the giant trees.

436
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,579
Can she cook?

437
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,548
It's not her strongest point,
but hear, I tell you.

438
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:25,701
Just have her bring provisions.
Magnificence there reckons he can cook.

439
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,303
We'll soon see.

440
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:00,465
Plenty more if you're still hungry.

441
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:02,620
Out of my way. Let me get at it.

442
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,786
- Well?
- Well, what?

443
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,108
Who's the girl then?

444
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,700
Her village was burned.
She'd nowhere to go, so I took her in.

445
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,384
Look at her one more time,
and I'll throw her out!

446
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:31,064
Merith! Oh, my sweet.

447
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,945
She doesn't hold a candle to you.

448
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,066
- She's not even pretty.
- Yeah?

449
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:39,626
Now, look, petal,
'<i>'</i>faithful'<i>'</i> is my middle name.

450
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:46,788
You must eat something.

451
01:04:48,070 --> 01:04:49,549
I'm not hungry.

452
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:52,350
Please, for me.

453
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,098
Thank you.

454
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:06,828
What troubles you?

455
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,949
<i>You have chosen a paltry kingdom</i>
<i>on an insignificant planet.</i>

456
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:13,499
And love.

457
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,143
<i>Love is fleeting.</i>

458
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:16,903
<i>Power is eternal.</i>

459
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,822
<i>Such is my power.</i>

460
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,588
<i>It can be yours.</i>

461
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,100
I don't want your power.

462
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,069
<i>Do not let my form frighten you.</i>

463
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:42,225
Lyssa.

464
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:50,384
I can assume any form I wish.
Any form you wish.

465
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:54,659
There's no love in that form.

466
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:02,662
And you think there's love
in your boy king?

467
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,223
<i>I've not held a man in my arms</i>
<i>since my lover left.</i>

468
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:10,504
This is a lie!

469
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,058
<i>I know how painful it is</i>
<i>to be far from your lover.</i>

470
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:14,503
He will betray you.

471
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:16,342
<i>Comfort me for one night.</i>

472
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:17,705
He will not.

473
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,428
<i>I can't betray my bride.</i>

474
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,103
Then he will die.

475
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,623
Let me comfort you.

476
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,983
I can't accept comfort when she has none.

477
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,229
You will not then?

478
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,819
I cannot.

479
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,145
<i>My master said:</i>
<i>"Make him betray her. If not, kill him."</i>

480
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:46,580
Yes, he is my master. These talons
were a heartbeat away from your throat.

481
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,385
I could have killed you in an instant.

482
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:53,146
<i>But, in the hour I knew you, I loved you.</i>

483
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:55,781
It is you who are betrayed.

484
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,865
Power is fleeting. Love is eternal.

485
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,069
<i>Remember me.</i>

486
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:12,260
<i>Consider this power.</i>
<i>If you consent to be my queen...</i>

487
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:15,584
<i>... I will halt the attacks of the Slayers.</i>

488
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,506
<i>It is in your power</i>
<i>to stop the killing and burning.</i>

489
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:24,304
<i>Each hour you delay,</i>
<i>more innocent people will be killed.</i>

490
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:26,984
<i>Think on it.</i>

491
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,069
Hurry, Colwyn.

492
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,341
I seek the Widow!

493
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,299
Enter here and die.

494
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,058
Lyssa!

495
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,338
Lyssa!

496
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,862
Who speaks that name?

497
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,941
It is I, Ynyr!

498
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:11,068
I give you this time.

499
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:35,145
Lyssa.

500
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,542
I was young when I last heard that name.

501
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:44,023
I was young when I last spoke it to you.

502
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:50,025
And my face was as beautiful as my name.

503
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:55,066
And I loved you, Lyssa, with all my heart.

504
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,706
But you would not stay with me.

505
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:02,186
- There were responsibilities, duty<i>...</i>
- Ambition.

506
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,266
You had a son.

507
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,540
We had a son.

508
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,381
But you said nothing.

509
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:20,459
Where is he?

510
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,538
I killed him when he was born.

511
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,904
And this is my punishment.

512
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:30,859
My son?

513
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:38,738
Since I could not kill you,
my rage needed a victim.

514
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,741
I know you can never forgive me.

515
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:53,624
I cannot forgive myself.
I have already forgiven you.

516
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:58,025
You can never forgive a woman
who has killed your son.

517
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,501
If I had not...

518
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:06,180
...could I see you now as I saw you then?

519
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,547
And allow me to see through your eyes.

520
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:32,070
How could I have left you?

521
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:34,946
Your vision is your gift to me.

522
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:41,624
And your vision could be your gift to me.

523
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:46,505
- What can I see for you?
- The Black Fortress, where does it rise?

524
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:51,144
Tomorrow...

525
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,902
...in the Iron Desert.

526
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:57,864
But the knowledge is useless,
for you can't leave here.

527
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,906
No man has ever escaped the Web.

528
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,824
There is a young girl being held
in the Fortress.

529
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,866
A young girl with your name.

530
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,870
A young man seeks her.

531
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,788
The age I was when...

532
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:13,749
...you and I met.

533
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:18,347
When you and I loved.

534
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:23,861
What you ask is beyond my power.

535
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,907
It can be turned only once.

536
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:34,790
That is the Law of the Web.

537
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:40,699
Then the second Lyssa will share your fate.
She will die, grow old and lonely.

538
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:46,783
She will die in a place of darkness.
This world will be a place of darkness.

539
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:56,388
These are the sands of my life.

540
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:03,146
Accept them and the spider
will have no power to harm you.

541
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,382
But your own life runs out with the sand.

542
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,347
What about your life?

543
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,783
I give it to the girl who bears my name.

544
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,263
I cannot stop the sand.

545
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:28,547
You cannot stop time.

546
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:34,423
Go now.

547
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,223
Save the other Lyssa.

548
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,379
At sunrise<i>...</i>

549
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,946
At sunrise...

550
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,860
...the Black Fortress will appear...

551
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,468
...in the Iron Desert.

552
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:54,586
It will remain there until sunrise
of the following day.

553
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,265
You must<i>...</i>

554
01:20:08,110 --> 01:20:09,862
You must reach it.

555
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:13,470
We'll reach it. You'll be with us.

556
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,620
No.

557
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:19,864
No, my...

558
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:25,740
...race is run.

559
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,859
Use your power wisely.

560
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,425
Do not squander it.

561
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:40,622
I learned the power from you.
I won't forget.

562
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,663
We'll bury him here.

563
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:08,029
The Iron Desert's 1,000 leagues from here.

564
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:09,624
Fire mares.

565
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,788
Fire mares can travel
1,000 leagues in a day.

566
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:17,270
There's time if we move quickly.

567
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:16,421
That's it. Drive them back!

568
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,348
The grey is the leader!

569
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,024
Hold him!

570
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,749
Come on! Come on!

571
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,543
I've got you.

572
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,149
Gentle as a baby!

573
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,540
- Saddle the others, quickly!
- Right!

574
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:48,387
Come on. Hold still!
Stand still, you beast!

575
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:02,067
Take good care of him.

576
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:06,063
- Why doesn't he come?
- It's his time to die.

577
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:09,301
If he's going to die anyway,
why doesn't he come with us?

578
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,382
No. He must stay here and accept his fate.

579
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:16,300
If he opposes it,
he'll bring great pain on himself.

580
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:22,105
Steady! I must remain here.

581
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:24,104
Is it time?

582
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,350
You've done enough, Rell. Stay here.

583
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,982
Each to his fate.

584
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:37,702
Each to his fate.

585
01:25:38,470 --> 01:25:40,665
Rell, I'll ride with you.

586
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:43,141
I have to stay here, my friend.

587
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,669
We had no time.

588
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:31,385
Hold on!

589
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,659
There it is!

590
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:40,100
Yes, and only madmen would want
to get this close to it.

591
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:42,581
We're going to get a lot closer.

592
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:44,626
And quickly. It's almost dawn.

593
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:47,430
We must get inside
before the twin suns rise.

594
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:38,829
Rhun, get back!

595
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:53,258
I was wrong.

596
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:55,982
The journey was worthwhile.

597
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:58,423
Finish it...

598
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:18,306
- We'll have to rush them.
- No, wait!

599
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:21,146
We'll be picked off as soon as we move.

600
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:29,426
Colwyn, look.

601
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,619
Follow him!

602
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:48,339
Come on!

603
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:55,862
Kegan! Mind the boy!

604
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:03,743
Get your axe in the opening!

605
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:05,149
It's no use.

606
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:11,704
This is my time.

607
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:15,665
Keep moving!

608
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:40,818
Which way?

609
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:44,099
Look out!

610
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:58,666
- My travelling days are over, my friend.
- We'll get you out of here.

611
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,823
Here's where I stay.

612
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:19,785
Lead on.

613
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:47,463
I can't hold him!

614
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:53,509
Throw us a rope!

615
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:02,899
Slayers!

616
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,538
I'm going down.

617
01:36:08,390 --> 01:36:09,379
Go!

618
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,665
Get back!

619
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:14,627
- Come out!
- No, wait!

620
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:16,940
There is nothing we can do. Get out!

621
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,501
From here, I must go on alone.

622
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:16,303
Go where? There's no way in.

623
01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:20,222
There is one way.

624
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:14,105
We must find the others, Ergo.

625
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:21,624
They've stopped.

626
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,908
Bardolph, let it go!

627
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,185
Look out!

628
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:20,143
- Lyssa!
- Colwyn!

629
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:31,780
Not here, Colwyn. He's too powerful.

630
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:34,859
You must fight him away from the centre.

631
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:44,269
The Glaive is gone.
I have no way to fight him.

632
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:52,263
Colwyn, it's not the Glaive, it's you.

633
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:56,423
No, Lyssa, it's us.

634
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:58,822
It's us he can't defeat.

635
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:02,579
It won't return to me except from the hand
of the woman I choose as my wife.

636
01:45:02,670 --> 01:45:05,343
I give it only to the man
whom I choose as my husband.

637
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:09,662
Take the fire from my hand.

638
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:45,460
We have to find the others. Come on!

639
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:08,108
I won't leave you, Ergo.

640
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:24,145
- Bardolph?
- Look, over here!

641
01:47:28,990 --> 01:47:31,424
That's Ergo. He may still be alive.

642
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:37,978
Let's get out of here.

643
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:39,742
He risked his life to save us.

644
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:43,106
We can't leave him here
if there's even a chance he's alive.

645
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:11,304
Come on, let's get you out of here.

646
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:32,864
Stand back!

647
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:06,709
Help them down!

648
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:50,583
He'll be all right.

649
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:54,101
- You are his queen?
- Yes.

650
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:56,228
- Then we've won.
- Yes.

651
01:51:57,030 --> 01:52:00,102
Oh, boy! I should have stuck to puppies!

652
01:52:03,070 --> 01:52:04,139
I think...

653
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:07,939
...it's time we unlocked those manacles.

654
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:18,227
I thought I'd keep them
as a memento of our journey.

655
01:52:19,790 --> 01:52:21,109
The key's yours.

656
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:24,268
Only the king and his lord marshal
carry this key.

657
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:26,059
That's right.

658
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:37,623
<i>A girl of ancient name shall become queen.</i>

659
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:42,581
<i>She shall choose a king,</i>
<i>and together they shall rule our world...</i>

660
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:46,021
<i>... and their son shall rule the galaxy.</i>

661
