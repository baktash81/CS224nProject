1
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:19,832
Starkfield!

2
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,267
This stop is Starkfield!

3
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,605
This is Starkfield.

4
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:33,876
W-what is?

5
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,906
Reverend Smith!

6
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:10,440
Mr. Smith!

7
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,543
You're the only one who got off,

8
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:15,877
so it must be you.

9
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,380
Hale... ned hale.
I'm the sexton.

10
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,282
The snow...
it's so bright.

11
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,417
I'm sorry.
How do you do?

12
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,219
Yes.

13
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:34,792
No boots?

14
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:35,959
No.

15
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:56,945
Must be a relief getting out of the city.

16
00:03:56,947 --> 00:04:00,615
I been to the city myself once,

17
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,617
and it sure was a relief getting out.

18
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,785
Was it?

19
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,387
I was there for nearly three days...

20
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,756
three and nearly the half the next day.

21
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:13,726
I figured two was more than enough.
Shouldn't we give him a ride?

22
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:16,661
Him? Nah,
he wouldn't take it.

23
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:20,831
Hello.

24
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,532
Good day!

25
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,618
The new minister.

26
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,252
Good day to you.

27
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,997
Did you see what he did to me?!

28
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,274
Wait.

29
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,276
Good.

30
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,044
Let's go.

31
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,649
The... the... the...
the poverty...

32
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:26,619
you would not believe your eyes in Boston

33
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,354
that... that people...

34
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:31,657
well, that we could allow
such degradation...

35
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:32,858
Reverend, if I could...

36
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,526
especially amongst the Irish.

37
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,995
May I introduce the reverend Smith?

38
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,496
Mr. and Mrs. howe.

39
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,563
How do you do?

40
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:40,897
How do you do, sir?

41
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,365
Reverend.

42
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,601
And their daughter, Sarah Anne.

43
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,336
It's a pleasure.
Hello.

44
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:48,904
Let me get you some tea.

45
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,640
Isn't this a beautiful dress, reverend?

46
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:55,376
It's, yeah, beautiful.

47
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:58,545
We never have so many visitors.

48
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:00,547
I was talking about Boston.

49
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:03,082
Would you like some more tea, reverend?

50
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:04,483
Perhaps. Yes.

51
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:07,952
Thank you.

52
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:10,087
Boston...

53
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:12,456
h-h-have any of you
ever been to Boston?

54
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:21,096
It's... Boston.

55
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:24,566
It's... To the east.

56
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,043
Good morning, reverend.

57
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:42,881
Morning.

58
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,728
Maybe, maybe, but I think
before I have any opinion,

59
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,363
I-I've only been here
a week, Mr. gow.

60
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:03,998
A week's enough for
anyone to know Starkfield.

61
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,469
If you spend too much time in Starkfield,

62
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,003
you begin to look like harmon.

63
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:12,372
Just the dumb ones are left, reverend Smith.

64
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:13,573
The smart ones get away.

65
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:15,374
But the importance of a church.

66
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:17,609
Surely is not the state of the building

67
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:21,079
but in the spiritual comfort it can offer.

68
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,533
Smith...
your new preacher.

69
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,971
Frome.

70
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:04,717
And everyone...

71
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,421
everyone... they just... it was
like the parting of the red sea.

72
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,123
Now, I-I-I don't want to
be too quick to judge,

73
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,592
but if we are to foster
a Christian community,

74
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,493
then everyone must play their part.

75
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,128
No one can be left in the cold.

76
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,999
I mean, if the man had a disease...
I wouldn't.

77
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:27,535
You wouldn't what?

78
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:29,603
You wouldn't try to talk to him?

79
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:31,805
You wouldn't try to ease his burden?

80
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,207
Wh... where...
where does he live?

81
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,009
Over the hill towards the flats,

82
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:38,777
on the back road.

83
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,478
It's a long way.

84
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,514
I-I'd like to see him.

85
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,148
Would you take me there?

86
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,617
We leave the fromes alone, reverend.

87
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,886
It's what's best.

88
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:06,533
Mother is here!
Mother is here!

89
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:53,942
Remember me?

90
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,677
We met the other day
at the post office window.

91
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,111
The new minister.

92
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:01,081
I-I-I was passing by.

93
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:06,052
I'm trying to visit all my parishioners...

94
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,653
In time.

95
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:18,061
I hadn't realized that you were
quite this far out of town.

96
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:22,865
I-I would have driven
had... had someone...

97
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,100
so, I-I guess
it's no wonder that...

98
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:28,103
I was told that you're not,

99
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,840
regular church on Sundays.

100
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,174
We met the other day?

101
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:35,242
That's right, at the...
what you want?

102
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:41,047
I-I'm... I'm
in need of a driver,

103
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:43,115
as you can see.

104
00:10:43,117 --> 00:10:45,851
I can pay 50 cents a week.

105
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,119
Here.
I-I-I've got the...

106
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:51,789
I've got the first week's right here.

107
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,257
We can start tomorrow if you're free.

108
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:07,127
Goodbye. I-I hope
to see you on Sunday.

109
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,842
Wait!

110
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,055
Push.

111
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:50,396
It's not moving.

112
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:08,145
Easy.

113
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:59,888
I hate... Putting you out,

114
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,991
but you're...
you're very kind.

115
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:05,393
What other choice was there?

116
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,865
Mrs. hale is going to wonder
where I am.

117
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:16,369
Thank you.

118
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,412
This one is still warm.

119
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:35,885
This morning...

120
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,353
The sky was so clear,

121
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:40,155
you never would have imagined.

122
00:14:41,992 --> 00:14:43,958
Is that your wife?

123
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,026
Please, I-I don't want her
to feel...

124
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:49,429
you can sleep in here.

125
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,064
It's warm till the fire's out.

126
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:14,318
The allens this afternoon...

127
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,187
good people.

128
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:18,354
Yep.

129
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:24,293
You could have come in with me.

130
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:28,930
I heard their whole life story.

131
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:33,167
People don't have anyone to talk to.

132
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:37,504
I think you can be too much on your own,

133
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,072
left alone.

134
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:41,374
Maybe that's how they like it.

135
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:43,642
Maybe.

136
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:46,511
That's how they've been treated for so long,

137
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,379
that's all they're used to.

138
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:53,041
"Let us now remind ourselves

139
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:58,045
"that charity never faileth.

140
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,514
"But whether there be prophecies,

141
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:02,115
"they shall fail.

142
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:05,551
"Whether there be tongues,

143
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:08,186
"they shall cease.

144
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:10,254
"Whether there be knowledge,

145
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:14,358
"it shall vanish away.

146
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,993
"For we know in part,

147
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,729
"and we prophesy in part,

148
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:23,733
"but when that which is perfect is come

149
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:29,104
"then that which is in part
shall be done away.

150
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:34,175
"When I was a child, I spake as a child.

151
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:37,311
"I understood as a child.

152
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:39,046
"I thought as a child.

153
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:44,183
But when I became a man,
I put away childish things."

154
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,155
"For now we see through a glass, darkly,

155
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:54,558
"but then, face to face.

156
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,329
"Now I know in part,

157
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:04,399
"but then shall I know,
even as also I am known.

158
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:06,334
"And now abideth

159
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:11,371
"faith, hope, and charity,

160
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:15,241
"these three.

161
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:19,144
"But the greatest of these...

162
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:21,179
Is charity."

163
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:33,057
It's not what you think,
Mr. Smith.

164
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,626
There isn't one of those men

165
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,128
who hasn't wrestled with his soul

166
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,629
about what was or wasn't

167
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,465
the right thing to do about Ethan frome.

168
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:46,836
What Mr. frome needs... who knows what Mr.
Frome needs, Mr. Smith?

169
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,338
Who can presume to know a thing like that?

170
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,175
In Boston, it is not
presumptuous to be charitable.

171
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:58,546
So perhaps it is in Boston
that I truly belong.

172
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:00,781
Someone should have just told you.

173
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:03,750
That's what we've done wrong.

174
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:06,519
Someone should just tell you.

175
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:09,488
We're going to lose you if someone doesn't.

176
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,356
I can see that.

177
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,691
And you're a good one.

178
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,592
Tell me what?

179
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:26,634
What do you know about Ethan, about zeena?

180
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,402
Who is zeena?

181
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:31,304
Ethan's wife, Mr. Smith.

182
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:33,239
You... you said you stayed there.
You didn't meet...

183
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,840
I stayed the night in the kitchen.

184
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,108
It was warmest there, Ethan said.

185
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,311
The door to the rest of the
house he kept closed, so...

186
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,781
then you don't know anything, reverend.

187
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,882
You can't.

188
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:51,754
I try to go out there once or twice a year.

189
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:55,424
Maybe the time's come 'round again.

190
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,826
Maybe we should go together.

191
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:09,534
Zeena and Ethan are distant cousins.

192
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:13,271
She grew up in a town...

193
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:14,805
I forget which one.

194
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,774
It's... it's a good ways
from here.

195
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,475
And she was sent for

196
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:23,178
to take care of Ethan's mother.

197
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,847
And then, after some time,

198
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,783
his mother died.

199
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:43,429
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

200
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:44,730
dust to dust,

201
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,932
in sure and certain hope

202
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:50,335
of the resurrection unto eternal life

203
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:53,538
through our lord Jesus Christ.

204
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:18,860
What were you, studying at, Hartford, Ethan?

205
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,495
Engineering.

206
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:25,265
I didn't get that far yet
in my studies, but,

207
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,667
people have said already they can
see I've got the feel for it.

208
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:30,903
But, I only just started,

209
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:34,373
and now mother...
she got ill and I come home,

210
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,943
but everyone says it's...
it's there waiting for me.

211
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:40,545
Wish I could have helped you more, zeena,

212
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:42,747
but you seem to be doing just fine.

213
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:45,750
I'm sure Ethan would want
to say how grateful he is

214
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:46,951
that you could come.

215
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:49,219
His mama would have been grateful, too.

216
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:50,853
Let me.

217
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:54,590
Then you're gonna sell the farm, Ethan?

218
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:58,994
Yep, I'm gonna sell the farm.

219
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:03,498
I plan to move out west.
Or Florida, maybe.

220
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,347
You don't have to leave yet.

221
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,815
You can stay for...

222
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,516
I came to take care of your mother, Ethan.

223
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,784
That's all my family expected.

224
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:29,485
My work is finished.

225
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:38,926
Would you like something?

226
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:41,528
I'll bet you didn't have
anything to eat yourself.

227
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,563
I'll make your supper in a minute, Ethan.

228
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:46,899
I w... I wasn't saying...
I'm not hungry.

229
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,734
I can't see how you could be

230
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:51,269
after all the pie I saw you eating.

231
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:58,041
Sit down if you'd like.

232
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,644
Make me nervous, darting around like that.

233
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:05,080
You can sit on the bed.
Move some things over.

234
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:11,052
Careful.

235
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:13,120
I'll do it.
You just sit there.

236
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:34,971
Let me do that.

237
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,174
You should have asked me.
You could have hurt yourself.

238
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,820
It's stuck.

239
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,022
Well, don't hurt yourself.

240
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:00,960
<i>I think zeena Pierce
had been noticing Ethan frome</i>

241
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:04,129
<i>for more than just that one afternoon.</i>

242
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:05,997
<i>He was a big, strong man,</i>

243
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:09,100
<i>and he was going to need someone sometime</i>

244
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:12,069
<i>to do the work his mama had been doing.</i>

245
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:16,139
<i>And if there's one thing every
woman looks for in a man...</i>

246
00:24:17,842 --> 00:24:19,441
<i>it's to be needed.</i>

247
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:23,578
Your breakfast will get cold.

248
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,480
I'll...
I'll bring it down later.

249
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:34,020
<i>She never did leave.</i>

250
00:24:34,022 --> 00:24:36,856
<i>Maybe they shouldn't have stayed together.</i>

251
00:24:36,858 --> 00:24:40,559
<i>Maybe if it had been spring,
it might have been different.</i>

252
00:24:40,561 --> 00:24:44,129
<i>But it was winter.</i>

253
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:46,131
Watch the ice!
<i>So they married.</i>

254
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,967
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

255
00:24:56,642 --> 00:25:00,243
The big tree there on this hill
where they're coasting...

256
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:04,046
right after, they wanted to cut it down,

257
00:25:04,048 --> 00:25:07,082
but they never did.

258
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,184
That's where it happened.

259
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:11,219
What happened?

260
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:24,228
I hate showing you this.

261
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:29,232
<i>After five winters had passed,</i>

262
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:33,703
<i>Ethan found himself with a wife
who'd become quite sickly.</i>

263
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:38,240
<i>Folks said about zeena that she'd caught
every illness she'd ever heard of,</i>

264
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:40,542
<i>and leaving Starkfield</i>

265
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:42,577
<i>was no longer even something to talk about,</i>

266
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:45,112
<i>to dream about.</i>

267
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:47,047
I don't see why we need someone.

268
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:49,983
Well, she don't cost anything
'cause she's a relative.

269
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:52,118
She's got nowheres else to go.

270
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,753
She might be someone to talk to.

271
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,588
Where is she going to stay?

272
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,957
Where I stayed when I came to help your ma.

273
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,291
In my old room?

274
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:02,293
Should she sleep in the kitchen?

275
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,529
But that's my room, zeena.
That's where I keep my books...

276
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:33,020
I made you a good breakfast, Ethan.

277
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,855
Just knowing I'm going to get some help

278
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,256
has made me feel a lot better.

279
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:39,125
Isn't that strange?

280
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:18,693
This is Starkfield, miss.

281
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:38,144
<i>Mattie silver was the daughter
of zeena's cousin,</i>

282
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:41,313
<i>and she'd had her share of hardship...</i>

283
00:27:41,315 --> 00:27:43,014
<i>her father's death,</i>

284
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:45,916
<i>the disclosure of his many debts,</i>

285
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:47,784
<i>her mother's death.</i>

286
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:51,621
<i>She was left with $50</i>

287
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:55,725
<i>to make her way
from the sale of her old piano,</i>

288
00:27:55,727 --> 00:28:01,363
<i>all of which made her kind
of... Fragile and shaken</i>

289
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:04,065
<i>and hardly the best choice
to take over the chores</i>

290
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:06,834
<i>zeena was too sickly to attend to.</i>

291
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:13,240
<i>But Mattie silver needed somewhere to live,</i>

292
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:16,643
<i>and zeena needed someone to help.</i>

293
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:20,313
<i>And so these three were brought together.</i>

294
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,250
How was the trip, dear?

295
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:25,851
Cousin zeena.

296
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:31,890
Never been so tired in all my life.

297
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:34,092
Ethan will get you a cup of tea.

298
00:28:34,094 --> 00:28:36,961
You're looking as tall as aunt Clara.

299
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:38,429
Must run in the family.

300
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:55,710
Is she asleep?

301
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:02,749
You see how she looked?

302
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:04,450
The child is ill herself.

303
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,752
You didn't tell me she was sickly.

304
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:09,688
It's a long ways from stamford. She's tired.

305
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,857
I know when someone is ill.

306
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:15,125
How is she going to get better in the cold?

307
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,360
We need someone to help, zeena.
That's what you said.

308
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:19,995
We need a strong girl.
A healthy girl.

309
00:29:22,332 --> 00:29:25,466
What are we going to do?

310
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,150
<i>I guess a year went by.</i>

311
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:48,286
<i>Mattie never did get the feel
for housekeeping,</i>

312
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:52,023
<i>but she was worried
zeena would send her away,</i>

313
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:53,891
<i>so she kept trying.</i>

314
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,098
<i>And Mattie got better.</i>

315
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,900
<i>Spring came, then summer.</i>

316
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:09,736
<i>And instead of getting sicker...</i>

317
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,871
<i>She got better.</i>

318
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,374
Mattie, he asked me.

319
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,377
<i>And by the next winter,</i>

320
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:03,514
<i>everyone began to notice
that this pale, fragile girl</i>

321
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:07,317
<i>had become a healthy, youthful,</i>

322
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,952
<i>and very alive young woman.</i>

323
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:15,824
<i>The whole village had noticed
the change in her.</i>

324
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:19,093
<i>Even me.</i>

325
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,098
Want to go down the steep slope?

326
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,199
If you want.

327
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,205
Come on!

328
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:41,845
Come on.

329
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:03,070
Are you hurt?

330
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:04,337
No.

331
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,641
I didn't know you were such a dancer.

332
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:12,643
What happened? What? Ruth?

333
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:14,378
What?

334
00:34:15,647 --> 00:34:18,047
Ruth!

335
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:19,681
I ain't hurt.
It's just a bruise.

336
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,616
We jumped off just in time.

337
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,253
My foot got stuck.
I couldn't steer.

338
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,520
I was scared,

339
00:34:27,522 --> 00:34:29,588
and I thought he was trying to tickle me!

340
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:32,724
Thanks, Ethan.

341
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:35,059
I'll see her the rest of the way home, ned.

342
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,061
All right.

343
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:39,730
Bye-bye, grandpa.

344
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:41,832
I'll just be a minute.

345
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,472
Good night!

346
00:34:52,742 --> 00:34:54,742
How are you getting home?

347
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,577
I got my dad's sleigh.

348
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:58,779
I even got the roan Colt hitched to it,

349
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,680
so we'd be there in no time.

350
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,615
I'll see you back at home, Mattie.

351
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,849
Wait, Ethan.

352
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,685
Denis here can give us both a ride

353
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,420
if he's driving out.

354
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,822
It's a... Two-seater,
Mattie.

355
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:16,493
Good night!

356
00:35:16,495 --> 00:35:18,495
You should have taken the ride.

357
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:19,829
It's cold.

358
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:22,198
Maybe I will another night.

359
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,099
Tonight I feel like walking.

360
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:26,634
You should've come a little earlier.

361
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:28,636
Everybody was dancing.

362
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:31,372
I said I was coming to fetch you.

363
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:34,174
Did you think I'd forget?

364
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:39,412
Zeena don't like you walking home alone.

365
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:42,214
I don't either.

366
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:47,752
That was something
with Ruth and ned, wasn't it?

367
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,822
Ned doesn't know how to steer. No.

368
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:54,457
I should take you coasting sometime.

369
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:55,591
Yes!

370
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:57,359
Ethan, I love coasting!

371
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,361
Ruth and I are always saying...

372
00:35:59,363 --> 00:36:00,762
always saying what?

373
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:03,598
That we both love coasting and we never go.

374
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,300
Denis eady must have asked you.

375
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:08,902
Well, why would I go anywhere with him?

376
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,516
Didn't see you.

377
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,758
Isn't that Orion yonder?

378
00:36:39,495 --> 00:36:42,429
And the big fellow
to the right is aldebaran.

379
00:36:43,865 --> 00:36:46,298
And the bunch of little ones,
like bees swarming,

380
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,565
they're the pleiades.

381
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:50,667
Doesn't looking at it

382
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:53,403
make you feel like it's all a picture?

383
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:56,873
It's so pretty.

384
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:59,742
Makes me happy just watching it.

385
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:06,615
I can see the moon in your eyes.

386
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:22,362
The key ain't here.
Maybe zeena forgot.

387
00:37:22,364 --> 00:37:24,697
Zeena wouldn't forget something like that.

388
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:26,699
It must've fallen.

389
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,701
But it's so late, Ethan.

390
00:37:31,571 --> 00:37:33,537
We should have been home an hour ago.

391
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:34,804
We'll find it.

392
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:41,475
It's open.

393
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:46,913
You forget about us, zeena?

394
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:50,983
No, I felt so mean tonight,
I didn't go to bed yet.

395
00:38:20,745 --> 00:38:22,010
Fox here again?

396
00:38:22,012 --> 00:38:23,544
Yep.

397
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:02,667
I'm so sorry!
I...

398
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,001
can't you be careful?

399
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:05,502
I'll clean it, zeena.

400
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:06,903
I'll do it!

401
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,671
I will have to do it.

402
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,043
You going somewhere, zeena?

403
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,878
Is something burning?

404
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,379
God!

405
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,690
Zeena's going to aunt Martha's

406
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:07,591
in bettsbridge for the night.

407
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,133
For the night?

408
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,869
There's a new doctor there.

409
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:23,871
I got such shooting pains now.

410
00:41:23,873 --> 00:41:26,406
They're clear way down to my ankles.

411
00:41:26,408 --> 00:41:28,875
I can't go on much more like this, Ethan!

412
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,877
I ain't never felt this mean before.

413
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,681
What you got to do you got to do.

414
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:39,651
I'm praying this new doctor
will have something for me.

415
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:46,056
You must be hurting.

416
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:49,192
You ain't never stayed away
the night before.

417
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:57,766
I'd go with you myself,
but there's the work to do.

418
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:00,935
Well, for one day, Ethan, I can...

419
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:02,636
can't do what I got to do.

420
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:09,075
Got to
haul them logs to Mr. hale.

421
00:42:09,077 --> 00:42:10,943
We ain't finished loading them yet, Ethan.

422
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,811
I'll take what we've loaded.

423
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:17,515
Mr. hale, he told me he was
in a hurry for any logs.

424
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:20,918
He's building that new house
for ned and Ruth varnum.

425
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,553
I promised him.

426
00:42:23,555 --> 00:42:25,221
You didn't tell me...

427
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:27,756
and he said he's going to
pay me a $30 advance.

428
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,023
He did?

429
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:30,224
$30?

430
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,626
Well, I won't be feeling so bad

431
00:42:33,628 --> 00:42:35,628
spending money on this new doctor.

432
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:41,533
Of course, I'll take you over
to the flats for the train.

433
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,001
Jotham can take me.

434
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:45,103
You have to go see Mr. hale.

435
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,538
You'll take me, jotham.

436
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,040
I sure hope this doctor can help, zeena.

437
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:53,476
If you can get the taste out,
that'll do for pickles.

438
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:24,200
$30?

439
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,536
Come on.

440
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,771
Let's go, boy.

441
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:06,270
Good morning, Ethan.

442
00:44:16,148 --> 00:44:19,349
You treat them horses
like they were pets, Ethan.

443
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:21,384
Your father would be proud.

444
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:27,322
That ain't a full load
you got out there, is it?

445
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:29,390
I was going into town anyway,

446
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:32,959
so... I thought...

447
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,896
I was, wondering

448
00:44:36,898 --> 00:44:39,098
if you could give me
an advance on the lumber.

449
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,235
Ethan, business is
downright slack to begin with.

450
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:46,137
You know I'm fixing up a
little house for ned and Ruth.

451
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:49,907
I'm glad to do it for them...
For the cost.

452
00:44:56,048 --> 00:44:58,915
Ethan...

453
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:02,084
You ain't needing money, are you, Ethan?

454
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:03,452
No.

455
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:05,787
I just...
just wasn't thinking.

456
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,088
'Cause if you are...

457
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,390
I just wasn't thinking,
Mr. hale.

458
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:18,430
Just the man I wanted to see.

459
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:21,165
Here.

460
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:25,102
Take this and tell Mattie
that I forgive her.

461
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:26,703
Forgive her?

462
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:28,738
Yeah.
For not riding with me.

463
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:33,876
And say, "to my favorite
dance partner."

464
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:28,858
Now, you watch where you're walking.

465
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,860
I nearly stepped on you, puss.

466
00:46:40,836 --> 00:46:43,369
She's keeping zeena's place warm.

467
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:54,011
Looks as if there'll be more snow coming.

468
00:46:54,013 --> 00:46:56,046
You think so?

469
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:04,554
Do you suppose it'll interfere
with zeena's getting back?

470
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:07,123
I don't suppose she could be home

471
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,325
much before tomorrow evening.

472
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,161
There's only the one train.

473
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:15,430
And I expect she's told
jotham to meet her then.

474
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:22,202
That's supposing jotham
remembers what he's been told,

475
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:25,004
which ain't always the case,
is it, with jotham?

476
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,006
I'll get you more.

477
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,109
I ain't making fun.

478
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:34,878
I ain't saying nothing
I ain't said to jotham, Mattie.

479
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,379
Ethan, I wasn't thinking you were.

480
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:37,847
It ain't his fault.

481
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:39,481
Once his aunt died, poor man,

482
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,483
well, he...
he's got distractions.

483
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:45,019
And he's fortunate to have somebody like you

484
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:47,420
to...

485
00:47:50,091 --> 00:47:51,957
That's what zeena says.

486
00:47:54,027 --> 00:47:56,227
And zeena's right.

487
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,973
It ain't being especially hungry.

488
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,507
I'm always especially hungry.

489
00:48:13,843 --> 00:48:15,375
It's the cooking.

490
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:22,014
What?

491
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:46,302
Jotham's got a little shed now
behind the gows'.

492
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,304
They give it to him.

493
00:48:50,574 --> 00:48:53,941
I'm very pleased you like the cooking.

494
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:56,109
I do.

495
00:49:00,915 --> 00:49:03,448
It's been...

496
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,550
I don't know...
more than a year

497
00:49:05,552 --> 00:49:09,554
since I think I was
complimented for anything.

498
00:49:09,556 --> 00:49:11,122
I'm sorry.

499
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:15,192
I can't believe that.

500
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:18,128
Maybe not for cooking, but...

501
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,562
For dancing?

502
00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:22,497
Well, I ain't heard none.

503
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:25,600
I'll bet denis eady.

504
00:49:25,602 --> 00:49:27,335
Then you mustn't have been listening.

505
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:29,070
Well, if it was denis, he did speak,

506
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:30,471
and I probably wasn't.

507
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:44,382
My hands... cold as ice.

508
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:53,689
Though it don't seem right my saying it,

509
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,024
the last compliment I think I remember

510
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,525
was from my piano playing,

511
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,393
and that was...

512
00:49:59,395 --> 00:50:01,495
what piano playing?
You never do.

513
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,965
You don't have a piano, so how could you?

514
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,366
Sometime, maybe.

515
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:10,969
Who has...

516
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:12,637
my piano playing and for my singing...

517
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,538
that's what I was complimented for.

518
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,337
Mattie...

519
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:36,440
I'd like some more.
I would.

520
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:38,708
Well, you haven't finished what you got.

521
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:53,453
I said I'd like some more.

522
00:51:56,758 --> 00:51:58,524
While I'm waiting

523
00:51:58,526 --> 00:52:00,459
I'll try one of these
good-looking things.

524
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:05,596
Hello, there.

525
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:09,466
You want a bite?

526
00:52:09,468 --> 00:52:11,367
Yeah?

527
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,169
We don't eat like this every day, do we?

528
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,741
I'm always asking zeena to let me.

529
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:21,209
I know.

530
00:52:21,211 --> 00:52:23,444
Ethan, I didn't mean anything against...

531
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:24,446
don't.

532
00:52:26,215 --> 00:52:28,348
Let's just the two of us sit here and eat,

533
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,083
like we were...

534
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,387
Sit here and eat like we were...

535
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,122
What?

536
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,632
It's broken!

537
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,100
No! It's broken!

538
00:52:51,102 --> 00:52:52,634
It wasn't your fault.

539
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,937
You don't understand!
The cat...

540
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,738
it wasn't meant to be used! I shouldn't
have given her some doughnut.

541
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,473
She kept it in the good parlor.

542
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,875
She kept it there, and now
she'll want to know why!

543
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,210
Zeena doesn't have to know anything.

544
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:04,611
I'll get another one.

545
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:06,479
I'll go to shadd's falls if I have to.

546
00:53:06,481 --> 00:53:07,746
You'll never get one there!

547
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:09,914
It was a wedding present from a cousin.

548
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:12,316
Let me do that.
You're cutting yourself.

549
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:14,651
What are we going to do?

550
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:15,852
I'll set it back.

551
00:53:15,854 --> 00:53:17,653
I'll get some glue tomorrow.

552
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:19,821
She never looks at the thing anyway.

553
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:27,312
Nearly forgot... got you
something in town today.

554
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:30,715
Why would you get me something?

555
00:54:34,953 --> 00:54:37,720
They're sweets.

556
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:47,428
It's beautiful!

557
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:54,533
It's lovely!
It's so lovely, Ethan.

558
00:54:54,535 --> 00:54:57,402
Denis eady asked me to give that to you.

559
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:09,343
Sweets!

560
00:55:10,612 --> 00:55:12,478
I love sweets.

561
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,612
They're good ones.

562
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:14,879
I can see that.

563
00:55:17,016 --> 00:55:18,482
Take one.

564
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:20,016
You try one.

565
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:26,588
Very good.

566
00:56:01,586 --> 00:56:02,985
What you s-sewing?

567
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:25,873
Ethan...

568
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,341
I c...

569
00:56:52,765 --> 00:56:56,566
Cooking...

570
00:56:56,568 --> 00:57:00,369
Piano playing...
Singing...

571
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:03,705
There's a lot I didn't know.

572
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:07,909
And I used to be the best
reciter in my school.

573
00:57:10,046 --> 00:57:13,580
Nothing scared me.

574
00:57:13,582 --> 00:57:17,116
I could stand in front of everyone.

575
00:57:17,118 --> 00:57:20,953
I'd close my eyes...

576
00:57:20,955 --> 00:57:24,990
"Solemnly, mournfully, dealing its dole

577
00:57:24,992 --> 00:57:28,093
"the curfew bell is beginning to toll.

578
00:57:28,095 --> 00:57:32,864
"Cover the embers and put out the light

579
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:37,034
toil... Comes
with morning and..."

580
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,603
"And the rest
with the night."

581
00:57:47,912 --> 00:57:50,412
I can't remember the rest.

582
00:57:50,414 --> 00:57:52,881
You're cold.

583
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,518
Good night.

584
00:57:58,621 --> 00:58:00,487
Good night.

585
00:59:41,513 --> 00:59:45,615
Mattie silver...
what a wonderful surprise.

586
00:59:45,617 --> 00:59:47,783
We'll be needing some glue, denis.

587
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,684
Glue?

588
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,520
Glue for the lady.

589
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,522
Let's see...

590
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,725
I thought it was...

591
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:01,828
Ethan.

592
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,563
Rose.

593
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,666
Well, I don't know where
my father keeps the glue.

594
01:00:07,668 --> 01:00:10,969
Maybe... Here.

595
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:13,604
Well, if you don't have it,
maybe Mrs. homan does.

596
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:15,939
If we ain't got it,
Mrs. homan sure won't.

597
01:00:17,309 --> 01:00:19,842
Hey, Mattie...

598
01:00:19,844 --> 01:00:22,244
What do you think about my present?

599
01:00:22,246 --> 01:00:24,713
What present was that, denis eady?

600
01:00:24,715 --> 01:00:26,748
Ethan, didn't you give Mattie the...

601
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,649
That.

602
01:00:28,651 --> 01:00:30,817
It was lovely.
Thank you.

603
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:55,171
5 cents.

604
01:00:57,808 --> 01:00:59,574
3... 4... 5.

605
01:01:01,644 --> 01:01:04,144
Thank you.

606
01:01:04,146 --> 01:01:07,113
I hope zeena ain't broke
nothing she set store by.

607
01:01:16,155 --> 01:01:17,854
Come on, boy.

608
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:24,125
Boy.

609
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:31,598
For the first week, they treat me

610
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,067
like I'm some country idiot
who don't read or write.

611
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,768
I don't say anything...

612
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:38,137
the less someone knows about
you... my father said this.

613
01:01:38,139 --> 01:01:41,039
But then, Mattie, I hear them
talking about bettsbridge.

614
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,607
That's where they're from.

615
01:01:42,609 --> 01:01:44,208
<i>Our</i> bettsbridge?

616
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,311
Here we are in Florida on
the other side of the country,

617
01:01:47,313 --> 01:01:50,380
and they're from bettsbridge,
and I'm from Starkfield.

618
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:53,316
Florida is a place you got to see, Mattie.

619
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:55,117
It's...

620
01:01:58,922 --> 01:02:01,656
Can I come in for dinner?

621
01:02:01,658 --> 01:02:03,357
We just got back, jotham.

622
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,192
I ain't had time.

623
01:02:05,194 --> 01:02:07,994
Zeena's been back long enough.
Ain't she fixed it yet?

624
01:02:09,097 --> 01:02:12,297
Z-zeena's back?

625
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:16,801
When did she...

626
01:02:16,803 --> 01:02:18,836
Mr. gow brought her.
Didn't you see them?

627
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:20,904
I thought that you would have passed them.

628
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:24,407
They... they weren't here
much after you left.

629
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,780
Mattie's going to make dinner.

630
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:06,381
Should she set you a plate?

631
01:03:06,383 --> 01:03:10,852
Mnh-mnh. Don't feel
I could touch a morsel.

632
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:17,391
You must be tired, after the long trip.

633
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:21,194
That was a good thing
getting a ride with gow.

634
01:03:21,196 --> 01:03:25,330
I guess, what, he was picking
something up at the station?

635
01:03:28,968 --> 01:03:32,202
What train did you take?
I didn't know there was a...

636
01:03:32,204 --> 01:03:33,937
I didn't take the train.

637
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:36,839
Mr. gow happened to be
in bettsbridge, so...

638
01:03:36,841 --> 01:03:41,343
That was good of him.

639
01:03:41,345 --> 01:03:44,012
I'm a great deal sicker than you think.

640
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:46,347
I've got complications.

641
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:49,583
Is that what the new doctor told you?

642
01:03:49,585 --> 01:03:53,018
What I should have is an operation.

643
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:59,490
You've never been told that before.

644
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:01,391
What do you know about
this new doctor anyway?

645
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:04,227
I didn't need to have anybody
tell me I was getting worse.

646
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:08,197
Every day, everybody...
Could see it.

647
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,367
Everybody in bettsbridge
knows about Dr. buck.

648
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:13,968
He has his office in worcester,

649
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:15,469
and he comes over once a fortnight

650
01:04:15,471 --> 01:04:17,103
to shadd's falls and bettsbridge.

651
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:19,271
Eliza Spears was wasting
away with kidney trouble

652
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:21,106
before she went to him,

653
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:24,142
and now she's up and around
and singing in the choir.

654
01:04:25,578 --> 01:04:27,244
I'm glad of that.

655
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:31,480
You just do what he tells you, then.

656
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:32,581
I mean to.

657
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:42,022
He says...

658
01:04:42,024 --> 01:04:44,858
That I should have a hired girl.

659
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,393
And that I oughtn't
to have to do a single...

660
01:04:47,395 --> 01:04:49,128
a hired girl?

661
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:51,363
And aunt Martha found me one right off.

662
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:54,265
Everybody in bettsbridge
says that I was real lucky

663
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:56,400
to get a girl to come way out here.

664
01:04:56,402 --> 01:04:59,536
And I agreed to give her
a dollar extra to make sure.

665
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:01,304
She'll be over tomorrow afternoon.

666
01:05:01,306 --> 01:05:02,938
If you meant to engage a girl,

667
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,073
you ought to have told me
before you started.

668
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:06,974
How could I tell you before I started?

669
01:05:06,976 --> 01:05:08,909
How did I know
what Dr. buck would say?

670
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:11,011
And did Dr. buck tell you
how I was to pay her wages?

671
01:05:11,013 --> 01:05:13,446
No, he didn't. For I'd
been ashamed to tell him

672
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:15,514
that you grudged me the money
to get back my health

673
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:17,415
when I lost it nursing your mother!

674
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:20,050
You lost your health... and
my folks told me at the time

675
01:05:20,052 --> 01:05:23,586
that you couldn't do no less
than marry me after...

676
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:41,035
You'll have to send her back.

677
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,936
The doctor doesn't understand

678
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:45,271
how I've stood it so long,
slaving the way I've had to.

679
01:05:45,273 --> 01:05:48,073
You don't have to lift a finger.
I'll do everything!

680
01:05:48,075 --> 01:05:51,009
You've neglected the farm enough already!

681
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:53,911
Better send me over to
the almshouse and done with it.

682
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:56,580
I guess there's been fromes
there before now.

683
01:06:01,452 --> 01:06:05,220
I thought you were getting $30
from Andrew hale for that lumber.

684
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:08,590
Hale never pays under three months.

685
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:10,291
You told me yesterday

686
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:12,593
that you fixed it with him to pay cash down.

687
01:06:12,595 --> 01:06:15,662
You said that was why you couldn't come
with... it was a misunderstanding.

688
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,598
You ain't got the money?

689
01:06:21,568 --> 01:06:24,468
And you ain't going to get it?

690
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:27,504
Well, how could I know that
when I engaged the girl?!

691
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:29,205
You know it now!

692
01:06:29,207 --> 01:06:31,540
You're a poor man's wife!
I do the best I can!

693
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:34,142
Of course you do.

694
01:06:41,683 --> 01:06:43,349
We'll manage...

695
01:06:43,351 --> 01:06:45,284
you, me, and Mattie.

696
01:06:45,286 --> 01:06:47,953
No, there'll be Mattie's board less, anyhow.

697
01:06:51,325 --> 01:06:52,991
Mattie's...

698
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:57,361
You didn't think I was going to
keep two girls, did you?

699
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:03,299
Well, no wonder you're
scared at the expense.

700
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:06,001
Mattie's not a hired girl.
She's your relation.

701
01:07:06,003 --> 01:07:07,469
And we've kept her for a whole year.

702
01:07:07,471 --> 01:07:10,438
Now it's another relative's turn.

703
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,339
I never bargained to take her for life.

704
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:14,107
You can't put her out like a thief.

705
01:07:14,109 --> 01:07:15,508
What's she going to do?

706
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,309
What do you think folks
are going to say about you?

707
01:07:17,311 --> 01:07:19,311
I know well enough what they say of me

708
01:07:19,313 --> 01:07:20,979
having kept her here as long as I have.

709
01:07:28,554 --> 01:07:31,555
The girl will be over
from bettsbridge tomorrow.

710
01:07:31,557 --> 01:07:33,723
She'll need someplace to sleep.

711
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,481
Felt a mite better.

712
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:36,584
Dr. buck says that I ought to
eat all I can

713
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:39,219
to keep my strength up, even
if I ain't got any appetite.

714
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:55,732
Jotham's going back to work.

715
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,771
Aunt Martha's troubles are about the same.

716
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:06,840
Even Dr. buck says that he ain't
never seen a man or woman

717
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:10,343
with worse intestines than she's got.

718
01:09:21,754 --> 01:09:26,523
That pie of yours, Mattie,
always sits a mite heavy.

719
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:29,726
I got those stomach powders
last year in Springfield.

720
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:31,260
I ain't tried them for a while.

721
01:09:31,262 --> 01:09:32,394
Maybe they'll help with heartburn.

722
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:34,229
Let me get them for you.
No.

723
01:09:34,231 --> 01:09:38,399
They're in a place you don't know about.

724
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,175
Who did this?!

725
01:09:54,447 --> 01:09:56,547
Who did this?!

726
01:10:02,488 --> 01:10:04,387
I went to get those powders

727
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:07,123
I had put in father's spectacle case

728
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:09,692
up there where I keep special things.

729
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:13,295
Cousin maple's pickle dish...

730
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,697
it's been up there on purpose

731
01:10:15,699 --> 01:10:17,432
since we was married.

732
01:10:17,434 --> 01:10:19,700
It ain't never been down
since except for cleaning,

733
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:21,835
and then I always lifted it
with my own hands.

734
01:10:21,837 --> 01:10:24,637
The cat did it, zeena.
The cat?

735
01:10:24,639 --> 01:10:27,339
That's what I said. Well, how'd
the cat get into my China closet?

736
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:29,174
It was chasing mice.

737
01:10:29,176 --> 01:10:31,209
Well, I knew she was
a smart cat, but I didn't know

738
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:32,710
she was smart enough to pick up the pieces

739
01:10:32,712 --> 01:10:33,877
and try and set them back together!

740
01:10:33,879 --> 01:10:35,245
I did it.

741
01:10:35,247 --> 01:10:36,613
It's my fault.
Mattie...

742
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:38,314
The cat did break the dish,

743
01:10:38,316 --> 01:10:40,482
but I got it down from the China closet.

744
01:10:44,788 --> 01:10:48,322
And why did you do that?

745
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:51,858
I wanted to make the supper table...

746
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,392
Pretty.

747
01:10:55,529 --> 01:10:59,364
Not even when the minister came to dinner

748
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:02,800
did I bring that dish out.

749
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:05,602
You're a bad person, Mattie silver.

750
01:11:05,604 --> 01:11:08,204
I should have listened
to folks. They warned me.

751
01:11:08,206 --> 01:11:10,940
Zeena! It's the way your father begun.

752
01:11:10,942 --> 01:11:14,810
You waited till my back was turned...

753
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,846
And took the one thing
that I set most store by

754
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:19,614
of anything that I've got.

755
01:11:19,616 --> 01:11:21,749
It'll be good when you're gone!

756
01:11:30,325 --> 01:11:32,191
Get away! Get away!

757
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:34,927
Get away!

758
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:22,369
I want to see what you're taking
before that gets closed up.

759
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:37,607
No.
She'll hear you.

760
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:49,583
I need you.

761
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:48,291
So that's what woke me up last night.

762
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,027
I heard something funny last night.

763
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:55,564
That's what woke me up...
that stupid fox dying.

764
01:15:55,566 --> 01:15:58,700
What time did you say Daniel
byrne would be around, jotham?

765
01:15:58,702 --> 01:16:01,102
Daniel byrne?
About noon.

766
01:16:01,104 --> 01:16:04,004
That trunk of Mattie's...
it's too heavy for the sleigh.

767
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:06,973
And Daniel byrne will be around
to take it over to the flats.

768
01:16:06,975 --> 01:16:08,641
What she has in it...

769
01:16:08,643 --> 01:16:10,876
No more than what she came with.

770
01:16:10,878 --> 01:16:12,210
That's all?

771
01:16:14,747 --> 01:16:16,813
The hired girl's coming
on the 4:00.

772
01:16:16,815 --> 01:16:18,948
Jotham can pick her up,
and while he's doing that,

773
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,150
he can take Mattie to wait
for the 5:00 to stamford.

774
01:16:21,152 --> 01:16:23,084
More coffee, jotham?

775
01:16:26,222 --> 01:16:28,055
A huckaback towel is missing.

776
01:16:28,057 --> 01:16:31,625
I went through her trunk, but...

777
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:35,060
I'm sure I lent her one
when she was sick last spring.

778
01:16:41,568 --> 01:16:43,167
Feeling a bit better.

779
01:16:43,169 --> 01:16:45,869
The appetite's back for now.

780
01:16:49,207 --> 01:16:51,840
It's just Mattie getting down her trunk.

781
01:16:51,842 --> 01:16:54,108
Alone?

782
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:05,950
The stove in Mattie's room

783
01:17:05,952 --> 01:17:08,319
ain't been drawing right for nine month now.

784
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:11,088
I want you to fix it up
before the girl gets here!

785
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,056
If it was good enough for Mattie,

786
01:17:13,058 --> 01:17:15,058
it's good enough for a hired girl!

787
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,594
Thank you, zeena.

788
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:33,972
That's good, Daniel.

789
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:56,992
Mattie! No!

790
01:17:57,995 --> 01:17:59,661
No! No!

791
01:17:59,663 --> 01:18:02,730
Aaagh!
No!

792
01:18:05,868 --> 01:18:07,133
Let me do it!

793
01:18:07,135 --> 01:18:08,834
No.

794
01:18:08,836 --> 01:18:10,402
No!

795
01:18:22,715 --> 01:18:25,382
Mattie...

796
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:28,752
Mattie, please.

797
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:35,391
I'll drive Mattie to the train.

798
01:18:35,393 --> 01:18:39,328
Jotham said he'd...
I said I'm driving her.

799
01:18:58,913 --> 01:19:01,113
Give our regards to your aunts.

800
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:03,014
They are often in my thoughts.

801
01:19:03,016 --> 01:19:04,915
This is for the train.

802
01:19:04,917 --> 01:19:08,018
It plus what you've shown me
you've saved is exactly enough.

803
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:41,347
Hyah!

804
01:19:42,817 --> 01:19:44,349
Hyah!

805
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:46,084
Come on!

806
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:48,186
Come on!

807
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:51,155
Come on, hyah!

808
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:29,189
I heard about this man.

809
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:32,125
He's about my age.

810
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:36,129
He comes from over the Mountain.

811
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:39,165
He went west with this girl.

812
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:45,504
He left his wife,
a-and they went west.

813
01:20:45,506 --> 01:20:49,040
But he came back...
<i>they</i> did...

814
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:52,309
to visit relatives.

815
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:54,377
I saw them, Matt.

816
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:56,178
They were pointed out to me

817
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,980
a couple of summers ago at shadd's falls.

818
01:21:01,217 --> 01:21:03,283
They... they had a baby
with them...

819
01:21:03,285 --> 01:21:05,451
a beautiful girl baby.

820
01:21:05,453 --> 01:21:09,855
But what's interesting is
the wife, who he left,

821
01:21:09,857 --> 01:21:12,190
s-she didn't do
so badly either.

822
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:14,892
He'd given her the farm, and she'd sold it.

823
01:21:14,894 --> 01:21:16,894
And with that and the alimony,

824
01:21:16,896 --> 01:21:19,329
she'd started a lunch room in bettsbridge.

825
01:21:19,331 --> 01:21:21,297
And...

826
01:21:21,299 --> 01:21:23,832
It's a... it's
a good lunch room.

827
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:27,035
I know the one you mean, Ethan.

828
01:21:27,037 --> 01:21:31,172
For $50, Matt, we could
take the train out west...

829
01:21:31,174 --> 01:21:32,173
Or Florida.

830
01:21:32,175 --> 01:21:35,376
I've been to Florida.

831
01:21:35,378 --> 01:21:40,547
$50.
I'm going to save it up.

832
01:21:44,052 --> 01:21:45,918
And we'd send her money, Matt.

833
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,319
I owe her that much.

834
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:54,024
I... I couldn't just...

835
01:21:54,026 --> 01:21:56,926
No.

836
01:22:23,450 --> 01:22:25,049
Giddyup!

837
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:44,865
Why are you stopping, Ethan?

838
01:22:44,867 --> 01:22:46,433
The hired girl will be waiting.

839
01:22:46,435 --> 01:22:48,935
Well, let her wait.
You'd have to if she didn't.

840
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:56,508
I'm going to buy you
something. Come on.

841
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,643
Ethan...
Come on.

842
01:23:10,455 --> 01:23:13,521
Show me what you want.

843
01:23:16,893 --> 01:23:19,659
I'm going to buy you something.

844
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:26,099
Hello, Matt.

845
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,301
Ethan.

846
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,003
Denis.

847
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:35,740
Ruth.

848
01:23:35,742 --> 01:23:36,774
Mattie.

849
01:23:36,776 --> 01:23:38,509
Mrs. varnum.

850
01:23:38,511 --> 01:23:42,279
We don't often see you
in town during the day.

851
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:44,447
No.

852
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:57,624
Let's leave, Ethan.

853
01:23:57,626 --> 01:23:59,726
What about this?
I'll buy this.

854
01:23:59,728 --> 01:24:01,327
You shouldn't be spending...

855
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,162
I want to buy you something, Mattie.

856
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:05,731
I told you that.

857
01:24:05,733 --> 01:24:07,632
I didn't know it was your birthday, Matt.

858
01:24:07,634 --> 01:24:09,166
Well, you didn't tell nobody.

859
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:11,034
It's not my birthday.

860
01:24:11,036 --> 01:24:13,302
I'll take this, denis.

861
01:24:18,342 --> 01:24:20,709
I asked ned for something
just like it for Christmas.

862
01:24:20,711 --> 01:24:22,744
But with the wedding so soon and...

863
01:24:22,746 --> 01:24:25,046
and getting the house...

864
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:30,317
I... I heard about
zeena going over to bettsbridge

865
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,621
to see that
new Dr. buck, Ethan.

866
01:24:34,623 --> 01:24:38,591
I'm real sorry zeena's feeling so bad again.

867
01:24:38,593 --> 01:24:41,493
I hope he thinks he can do
something for her.

868
01:24:41,495 --> 01:24:43,461
Thank you for thinking about her.

869
01:24:43,463 --> 01:24:45,329
I don't know anybody around here

870
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,331
who's had more sickness than zeena.

871
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,099
No.

872
01:24:49,101 --> 01:24:51,434
And after all the help
she's given other people...

873
01:24:51,436 --> 01:24:52,635
nursing people...

874
01:24:52,637 --> 01:24:53,702
I know that.

875
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:59,240
If your ma hadn't had her
to look after her...

876
01:25:02,278 --> 01:25:03,777
Mattie...

877
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:06,246
Let's go to the station, Ethan. Put it on.

878
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:08,448
I don't care who knows it's from me.

879
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:27,799
We said we were going coasting, Matt.

880
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:30,267
We said we were going, and we ain't.

881
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:51,219
You want to do the big run?

882
01:25:54,657 --> 01:25:55,822
Come on.

883
01:26:20,778 --> 01:26:23,145
How high are we going to go?

884
01:26:23,147 --> 01:26:25,780
You want... you want
speed, don't you?

885
01:26:25,782 --> 01:26:27,414
Come on.

886
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:31,551
That's it.

887
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:44,427
Here.

888
01:26:44,429 --> 01:26:47,830
I hope you steer better than ned hale.

889
01:26:47,832 --> 01:26:50,232
I'll hold you.
Don't worry.

890
01:26:58,339 --> 01:27:00,706
Aaaah!

891
01:27:32,469 --> 01:27:34,202
Again?
Yeah.

892
01:27:34,204 --> 01:27:35,570
Okay.

893
01:28:28,383 --> 01:28:29,782
You were scared.

894
01:28:29,784 --> 01:28:32,417
No, I wasn't.

895
01:28:34,788 --> 01:28:36,287
Are you tired?

896
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:38,656
No.

897
01:28:49,932 --> 01:28:53,800
If I miss my train, where will I go?

898
01:28:53,802 --> 01:28:57,403
Where you going if you catch it?

899
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:22,557
I want you...
To take me down again.

900
01:29:25,028 --> 01:29:28,396
I never want to leave this hill.

901
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,687
Wait.

902
01:29:55,689 --> 01:29:56,954
Why, Ethan?

903
01:29:56,956 --> 01:29:58,588
I want to go in front.

904
01:30:01,893 --> 01:30:03,893
I want to feel you hold me, Matt.

905
01:30:23,947 --> 01:30:25,947
Push off.

906
01:30:25,949 --> 01:30:28,382
Push! Push!

907
01:31:49,864 --> 01:31:52,965
My mother and I were
the first to reach them.

908
01:31:52,967 --> 01:31:56,001
We were walking home.

909
01:31:56,003 --> 01:31:59,471
They laid Mattie in our house, upstairs,

910
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:02,607
in my room.

911
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:04,742
We were great friends.

912
01:32:04,744 --> 01:32:09,012
She was going to have been my bridesmaid.

913
01:32:12,017 --> 01:32:16,452
I haven't ever heard before or since...

914
01:32:16,454 --> 01:32:20,788
Any human being moan

915
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:22,589
like Mattie did.

916
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:27,993
May God have pity on them.

917
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:38,769
Come on.
We can walk the rest.

918
01:32:44,509 --> 01:32:45,741
Morning, Ethan.

919
01:32:45,743 --> 01:32:47,909
Ruth.

920
01:32:47,911 --> 01:32:52,112
You know the new reverend, I gather.

921
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:54,647
Mr. Smith.

922
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:56,048
Ethan.

923
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,751
We were just going by.

924
01:32:59,753 --> 01:33:03,054
Where's zeena?

925
01:33:03,056 --> 01:33:06,157
If she knew I was near and didn't stop in...

926
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:47,797
Ruth.

927
01:33:47,799 --> 01:33:49,198
Please.

928
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,066
Please.

929
01:33:51,068 --> 01:33:53,001
You'll be wanting some tea.

930
01:33:57,639 --> 01:33:59,572
Have you...

931
01:33:59,574 --> 01:34:01,674
Have you met the reverend Smith?

932
01:34:01,676 --> 01:34:04,810
It is a pleasure,
Mrs. frome.

933
01:34:04,812 --> 01:34:08,613
<i>This</i> is my wife,
Mr. Smith.

934
01:34:16,588 --> 01:34:21,123
And this is miss Mattie silver.

935
01:34:28,098 --> 01:34:31,599
Let me get the tea.

936
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:50,850
Would you like me to open up the...

937
01:34:57,257 --> 01:34:59,257
We like it dark,
Mr. Smith.

938
01:35:28,954 --> 01:35:31,721
Don't say anything...

939
01:35:31,723 --> 01:35:34,156
Not yet.

940
01:35:37,394 --> 01:35:39,393
Spring's coming.

941
01:35:42,364 --> 01:35:44,364
Snow won't last much longer.
