1
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,777
(man) The first time I saw this country,

2
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:55,827
it had buffalo grass
and bluejoint up to the stirrups.

3
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,956
By the second year we had
8,000 Texas half-bred cattle

4
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:05,248
and over 3,500 volumes of
English literature in my library.

5
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:09,253
(man #2) We just cut out
the unbranded stock

6
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,425
and divided 'em up between the outfits.

7
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:16,770
There was no arguin'
over mavericks like today.

8
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,221
(man #3) You got it good today.

9
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:23,651
(man #1) Two per cent annual loss then.
Now it's seven from rustling alone,

10
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:29,650
not to mention winterkill, calving loss,
miring down in the spring.

11
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,871
How many are you?

12
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:46,460
Mr Braxton, did you see they sew old boot
tops on the saddle to hold ammunition?

13
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:49,712
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't wanna be pestered.

14
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:53,713
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

15
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,385
Well... it's beautiful country.

16
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,937
Yes, sir. It sure is.

17
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,565
You especially feel that now?

18
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,192
Yeah.

19
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:27,211
(singing "Oh, Susannah")

20
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,448
Sh, sh, sh.

21
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,580
(child cries)

22
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:15,178
I sure hope them sportin' ladies
don't get sunburned.

23
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:19,011
I like 'em white as pastry.

24
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,684
Ladies.

25
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:37,781
Are we all set here?

26
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,367
All set, Pete.

27
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,922
Shall we start the horse... or will you?

28
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,305
I will, sir.

29
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,430
(man) Well, that's one of them.

30
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:45,010
His name was Sandy Chase and he came
here from Rhode Island with the army.

31
00:06:45,146 --> 00:06:47,388
He was 24 years old.

32
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:56,279
We lost seven per cent of stock between
spring and fall last year, to rustlers.

33
00:06:56,407 --> 00:07:00,357
You always mention the percentage.
I wonder why you do that.

34
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:03,698
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

35
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:06,666
I was in the California gold fields
before I was 18.

36
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:10,660
I was at the rush at Alder Gulch
and I went to South America.

37
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:14,746
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

38
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:17,505
Barbers from Minneapolis,

39
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:23,011
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,
wolfers and woodcutters,

40
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:27,140
dishonest apprentices,
raftsmen, poisoners.

41
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:31,645
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

42
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:43,029
You're astonished at my arrogance,
at not even having a trial, aren't you?

43
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,827
Then why don't you get over it?

44
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:50,583
Our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

45
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:55,089
Honey, pull down Tristram Shandy again
for me, would you?

46
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,646
Daddy.

47
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,486
Excuse me.

48
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,458
Come on! Giddap! Yah!

49
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,661
Got the gate.

50
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,509
How'd she go, Tom?

51
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,092
Everybody else been back a day.

52
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:34,806
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

53
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,063
Yeah.

54
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,190
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,357
How was Wyoming?

56
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:46,698
It was fine.

57
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:52,782
Spent a couple of days in KC trying to
keep from associating with criminals.

58
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:56,997
Why, they've hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

59
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,794
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

60
00:10:00,925 --> 00:10:03,213
They got two Pinkerton in KC

61
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:08,171
and I do believe one of 'em
was the legendary Charlie Siringo.

62
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,801
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

63
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:16,187
Can't remember.
Said he could talk Mexican.

64
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,355
Yeah, that's him.

65
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:22,184
How'd you know it was a detective?

66
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:27,030
Rancher's wife wanting to go to bed
with him. He kept givin' her a "no".

67
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,697
Damned if I can understand that.

68
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,865
- Well, I took care of her, Cal.
- You did that, huh?

69
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,498
You're damn sure.
Had a good time too, thank you.

70
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:38,121
Did you?

71
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:43,295
Spent the night in Martinsdale.
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

72
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:47,672
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

73
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:50,260
Yeah... How was she?

74
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,190
About like a Swiss clock. Same exact
movement over and over again.

75
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,648
Yeah.

76
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:23,442
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.

77
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,778
Yeah.

78
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:30,582
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

79
00:11:30,707 --> 00:11:35,416
David Braxton's foreman...
What's his name, Cary?

80
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,751
- Pete Marker.
- Pete Marker.

81
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:40,550
...caught him and they hung him.

82
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:44,084
Goddamn it.

83
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,554
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

84
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,680
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

85
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,144
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

86
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,487
They hung him up on a cottonwood,
though, and he sort of...

87
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,071
He sort of what?

88
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,079
Sort of strangled for a while.

89
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:20,130
Braxton was there dressed in a suit.

90
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:23,091
- Lookin' like God.
- Hah!

91
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:29,013
Goddamn.

92
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,260
I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy...

93
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:34,600
Listen at this, now.

94
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:38,098
The first time I met Sandy,
he was rustling on his own.

95
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:42,277
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

96
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:47,401
As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut
the brand off and feed it to the dog.

97
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,989
He said to get enough
evidence to convict him

98
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:53,037
they'd have to pick through
the dog's shit for a week

99
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:56,035
before they could find the brand.

100
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:09,759
My aunt ran a laundry in St Paul.

101
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:14,599
Got strangled by a Chinaman
while she's washing her dog.

102
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,681
It's easy to die. Easy!

103
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,309
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

104
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:26,655
He was the only comedian in this outfit.
Every outfit oughta have a comedian.

105
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:29,901
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

106
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:32,952
I know I've been saying that.
But you can't.

107
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,702
What do we do, Tom? Open up a stand
and sell stolen horses over the counter?

108
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:42,453
No. We gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across

109
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,044
so as we got somewheres
to relay 'em at.

110
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:49,552
- That's right.
- That's just really great.

111
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,718
Only we ain't got a ranch.

112
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:55,513
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there.

113
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:59,059
We can't move them across the breaks
without everybody knowing.

114
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:02,023
Let's just stick up the NP Railroad
and buy a ranch.

115
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,023
Hell, let's rob a bank.

116
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:08,101
If we're gonna get hung for rustlin' horses,
we oughta be robbin' trains.

117
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:11,193
Why don't you boys join
that Hole-in-the-Wall bunch

118
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:14,741
and you'll be around people
that think like that?

119
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:26,089
Boy, a couple of years ago they'd have
put Sandy in Red Lodge penitentiary,

120
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,255
weavin' bridles.

121
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:34,675
Seems like there's
something new in the air.

122
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,396
I bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

123
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:47,439
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

124
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,322
He will leave Sandy in the trees.

125
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:56,943
When we was fightin' in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

126
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,831
We relayed a cousin of mine

127
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:03,457
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

128
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,495
He beat the telegraph.

129
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,126
Took the detectives two years to cover
the same ground he'd covered in a week.

130
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:14,471
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the Chama.

131
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:19,342
Why was you havin' to move
this cousin around so much?

132
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:22,146
He did card tricks.

133
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:24,311
I get it.

134
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,311
He done a trick for this nigger on
the Chama. The nigger throttled him.

135
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,903
Mm-hm. I see.

136
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,652
Say, Cal...

137
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,372
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

138
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:48,502
Yeah.

139
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:54,007
It beats sendin' three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

140
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:57,422
The law there is pretty effective now.

141
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:05,726
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we oughta rob a train.

142
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:13,193
No...

143
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:16,523
I'm tired, Cal.

144
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:22,117
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

145
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,210
Too bad about Sandy.

146
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,742
(train whistle)

147
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:50,665
(cocks gun)

148
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:56,206
All right, move over there. Move, move!

149
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:59,259
I want you to uncouple that car. Hurry up!

150
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:02,921
I can't do it. I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

151
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:05,180
Just get down there and pull the pin out.

152
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,805
- I'm a clerk. I'm not mechanical.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

153
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,910
Whoo-hoo!

154
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:42,049
- Get the money out. What's your name?
- Nelson.

155
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,089
Nelson, you do this right,

156
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:49,134
you can say you've seen Jesse James
and lived to tell the story.

157
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,939
You're not Jesse James.

158
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,480
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

159
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,987
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Gimme the goddamn money.

160
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,358
Whoa!

161
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,705
Gee!

162
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:23,756
- Don't start blamin' me.
- I am blamin' you.

163
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:26,675
This is it on trains. This is it.

164
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:28,088
God Almighty.

165
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:31,262
This is it. No more trains, Tod.

166
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,598
- I just don't wanna get blamed.
- Sh...

167
00:19:34,732 --> 00:19:37,021
We got it! It's all over the place.

168
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,859
Yahoo!

169
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,311
(Little Tod laughs) We got it.

170
00:19:43,991 --> 00:19:48,819
- You need some help?
- Just pick up the money, goddamn it.

171
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,781
Agh!

172
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:57,371
But they're all ones.
Tom, they're all ones.

173
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,925
- Where am I gonna put 'em all?
- I don't wanna hear that now. Just...

174
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,347
Ain't it just terrible?

175
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:13,017
The next time you mention trains,
it's gonna get worse.

176
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:18,015
You boys new at this?

177
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,613
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

178
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,816
(laughing)

179
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:29,363
Yahoo!

180
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,821
Let's get every goddamn one up.

181
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:35,911
Hey, look! There's tens in the water.

182
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:38,878
Get in there, Tod.
Get in the water. Get those tens.

183
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,412
Yahoo!

184
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:46,427
(train whistle)

185
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,220
Little Tod...

186
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:55,887
Get out of my way.

187
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,067
Come on. Let's get outta here
with what we got.

188
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,049
Mornin', my little darlin'.

189
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:29,759
Hey, Si. We'll see 'em in church.

190
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,640
I think all of you working men and women

191
00:21:37,772 --> 00:21:40,975
have had time now to consider
this case before us.

192
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:44,228
- There's Braxton.
- I have reviewed its details,

193
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:48,027
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

194
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:51,526
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

195
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,116
(man) Make him confess first.

196
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,532
I think the kindest thing
we can do to this bird

197
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,418
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

198
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:05,290
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

199
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,801
- I see no direct call to hang him.
- Don't he look like God?

200
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,345
Who's got an opinion about
how long we might send him up?

201
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:16,558
- (man) Life is indicated.
- (woman) He'll take anything.

202
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,892
How would 10 to 20 sound to you?

203
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:23,149
Sounds about right to me.
How soon would I be eligible for parole?

204
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,146
- In about two weeks.
- (laughter)

205
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:32,652
Anything you'd like to say
before we send you to your just deserts?

206
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,276
And if I may speak for the court,

207
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:38,248
we would prefer
that it be something colourful,

208
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:41,540
life on the frontier being what it is.

209
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:44,417
Just that...

210
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:52,338
it may seem to you boys
like a hard way to make the papers,

211
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,006
but I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

212
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:02,511
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks, or
for my careless devil-may-care gunplay.

213
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,308
(laughter)

214
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:08,439
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either,

215
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:11,690
because I'm that kind of guy.

216
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:15,109
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

217
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:18,944
I would like you all
to refer to me from now on

218
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,654
as "The Lonesome Kid".

219
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,959
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

220
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:33,044
That's enough of that! Let's all go up
to the bar and make fools of ourselves.

221
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,218
(music starts)

222
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,775
Yahoo!

223
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:56,568
(Braxton) Whoo! I haven't danced like that
since Chicago.

224
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,410
I'm Tom Logan.

225
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:05,038
I'd like to congratulate you, sir,
on your treatment of that impostor.

226
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,838
Oh... My daughter, Jane.

227
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,339
Hello.

228
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:12,466
People have told me
I should talk to you, Mr Braxton.

229
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:15,878
I just sold a family implement business
in the Shonkin range

230
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:19,512
and I'm thinkin' of buying a small ranch.

231
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:26,180
You done so well I'd like
a piece out by you for good luck.

232
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:32,027
Well... the Cannon Ranch is for sale.

233
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,525
Isn't much. Four sections and a cabin.
Pole corrals around it.

234
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,360
But it's well watered,
and pretty fair shelter.

235
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:46,412
The owner's living in town now.
Has a cooperage at the end of Main,

236
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:48,583
past the livery.

237
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,875
I understand you had
some rustlin' problems.

238
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,843
Seven per cent losses per annum.

239
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:02,768
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

240
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:04,802
Mm...

241
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:08,981
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

242
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:12,232
I did that.

243
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,360
Oh, that's tough.

244
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:20,066
What was this?
Some kind of a desperado?

245
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:21,577
No.

246
00:25:21,704 --> 00:25:26,496
He was a thief, with probably a million
good reasons for being on hard times.

247
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:30,208
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

248
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:36,998
Don't you believe
in hangin' thieves, miss?

249
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,175
No, sir, I don't. Do you?

250
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:44,216
I surely do. How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

251
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,599
Well, what do you know?

252
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:52,977
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch,
get started in the cattle business.

253
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,186
With your attitude toward human life,

254
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,736
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie,

255
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:03,492
and have your picture on page one,
or page three, of the Chicago papers.

256
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,615
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

257
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:12,333
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

258
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:16,255
You sound bitter, lady.

259
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:19,254
You should have seen
that young man's face.

260
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:22,138
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

261
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:25,300
I don't think you can really picture
the man's face.

262
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:28,601
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

263
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,608
Thank you for your information,
Mr Braxton.

264
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:38,072
I'll go over to the cooperage and ask
Mr Cannon about them four sections.

265
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,866
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

266
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:59,916
Welcome to town, now.

267
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,385
Damn, I feel better now.

268
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:05,553
- Damned if I don't.
- Me too.

269
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:07,722
(thunder)

270
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:17,313
Oh, God! You didn't cut him down yet.

271
00:27:17,444 --> 00:27:19,484
We did! That's...

272
00:27:21,198 --> 00:27:23,025
Whoa!

273
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,826
- Oh...
- Oh, Pete.

274
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:30,742
My God. They've killed my man.

275
00:27:35,963 --> 00:27:40,589
- Si, are we gonna go to that whorehouse?
- Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

276
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:44,086
File that. We got it.
Let's go for a ride.

277
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:47,138
I wanna go to a whorehouse,
play cards, get drunk.

278
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:52,011
We can go to the whorehouse later.
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

279
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:55,597
I buy you a brand-new ranch.
Do you wanna ride out and look at it?

280
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:58,817
Hell, we own it, we can go anytime.
Let's go for a drink.

281
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:02,194
- Let's play cards...
- Let's go to the whorehouse.

282
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:06,783
You're gonna have to pick and choose
on that cos the money's about all gone.

283
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,911
- The money can't be gone.
- Well, it is and I'm glad.

284
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:11,746
- I'm glad too.
- Why?

285
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:13,700
Because robbin' trains is...

286
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:18,377
We start a pattern of robbin' trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

287
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:21,839
From then, you can back
the calendar down till they hang us.

288
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,006
That's why.

289
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:33,640
I still think we should rob a bank.
Rob trains, rob a bank.

290
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:37,222
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Mm-mm.

291
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,858
You here for a party?

292
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,407
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?

293
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:01,584
(sniggering)

294
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:03,755
Well...

295
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,381
You got any girls?

296
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:20,772
Go on, Si.

297
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:34,037
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

298
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:37,288
I like them ribbons.

299
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:40,789
Anybody want anything to eat?

300
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:47,713
Well, is he the one that I want.
You just come right on up here with me.

301
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,009
Where are the chubby ones?
I want a chub...

302
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:56,182
Oh, yeah.

303
00:29:57,354 --> 00:30:00,521
Ain't that a match-up?
Ain't that a match-up?

304
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:03,270
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

305
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,704
- That one got away!
- You'll pay for that.

306
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:23,671
In my home town,
I'm considered a dangerous person.

307
00:30:23,797 --> 00:30:29,633
Yeah? In your home town a man can get
a bad reputation for smokin' corn silk.

308
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,633
Cary'll stay at the breaks,
but somebody must tend this place.

309
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:38,634
I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

310
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,395
Agh!

311
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:48,317
I got you! Told you I was gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

312
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,486
Here! How about this?

313
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,083
I like this place, Cal.

314
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,296
- Yeah.
- I like it quiet.

315
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:11,840
(clattering)

316
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,299
Cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

317
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:21,809
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these goddamn things,

318
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:24,264
workin' for my uncle that raised me.

319
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,937
I worked myself cross-eyed too.

320
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:33,023
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

321
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,491
I'd had the dog since it was ten years old.

322
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,499
And he shot it...

323
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:46,167
for stickin' its tongue on a pat of butter.

324
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:49,580
So I stayed one more night.

325
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:55,468
And I killed his seed bull,
I rustled every damn horse he had

326
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:59,642
including a racer that I sold as
a cow pony to an Indian rancher,

327
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:02,093
and I took the whole damn remuda.

328
00:32:02,229 --> 00:32:05,562
I come within a hair's breadth
of sendin' him to kingdom come.

329
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,732
I was that close to shootin'
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

330
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:18,067
I never did have that kind of background.

331
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:22,366
Never had nothin' neither.
My folks always wanted a place.

332
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:25,749
They was good people,
so I always saw it with their eyes.

333
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,119
I can see that.

334
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:34,258
But when you think about it, you wouldn't
want the weight of a damn place like this.

335
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:40,343
Do you do alterations too, ma'am?

336
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:45,518
Nope.

337
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:51,899
And I don't do
your wire-ripped shirts neither.

338
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,404
There you go.

339
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:02,580
Si, you're beginnin' to sound
like a real old lady.

340
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:05,576
What do you say
we just jump this pissant seamstress?

341
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:09,789
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

342
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,792
- Yahoo!
- Whoa! Watch it!

343
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,584
Come on! I'll kill ya.

344
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:18,087
Everybody's so scared of the Mounties
that nobody even tries.

345
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:20,048
The horses are hardly guarded.

346
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:25,768
- You talkin' to me about Canada again?
- You're goddamn right I am.

347
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,972
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.

348
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,605
Hell, they scare everybody.
That's why it'll be so easy.

349
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,941
The Indians won't touch them horses.

350
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,941
We can take all 60 of them ponies
at a walk.

351
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:42,985
All Canadian government brand?

352
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:49,076
Until we can get 'em to the breaks for
modification, and then down here to relay.

353
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:52,295
That doesn't quite
settle it though, does it?

354
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,878
No, it don't.

355
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,129
Someone's gonna have to stay here.

356
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:02,133
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

357
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:06,558
It's gotta be one of the two of us,
and I'll tell you one thing.

358
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:10,470
You had all the fun on that train
while I baby-sat these savages.

359
00:34:10,607 --> 00:34:15,020
I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. That's it.

360
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,665
(sighs)

361
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:36,212
I gotta stay on this
goddamn piece of ground.

362
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,425
Goddamn! I can't even believe this!

363
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:46,802
That is pitiful.
You assholes will just get lost.

364
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:52,522
- He was the best foreman.
- He was the only foreman I ever had.

365
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:56,599
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- He surely was, David.

366
00:34:56,736 --> 00:35:01,778
He could break a horse better than
the bronc fighters. He could do every job.

367
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,482
He was a great ramrod.

368
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,411
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

369
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,996
- Sure did.
- Excuse me.

370
00:36:04,054 --> 00:36:06,723
- Lee Clayton.
- Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.

371
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:11,391
- All I could see was your horse.
- That was all you were meant to see.

372
00:36:12,395 --> 00:36:15,562
Is the owner about?

373
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,395
Who may I say is calling?

374
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:21,895
Lee Clayton. I just said that.

375
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:25,859
I have a short memory.

376
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,699
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here,

377
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,536
and then I can get back
to what I was doing before.

378
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:40,540
Tell him Lee Clayton from Medicine Hat,
Wyoming. Here on business.

379
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:42,915
- You got it?
- Yes.

380
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,653
- Come in. I've been expecting you.
- Oh, sir.

381
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:10,401
I don't know why it would not
have tired me more than it did,

382
00:37:10,537 --> 00:37:16,077
to have travelled all this distance
without more than a catnap.

383
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:19,792
You've a wonderful set of books here, sir.

384
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:22,127
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.

385
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:24,463
I don't spend the time with them I should.

386
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:31,840
I'm of the opinion... I would only claim
books that was about right from wrong.

387
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:36,637
Otherwise how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

388
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:38,811
True. Please.

389
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:44,984
Oh, sir. I'm sorry for your trouble.
I wasn't aware.

390
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:48,696
Gentlemen, Robert E Lee Clayton.

391
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:55,904
I understand that you hung a thief

392
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,283
and neglected to find out where they were
caching the stock. How was that?

393
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:03,663
He didn't wanna talk. He was about to die.

394
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:07,713
Oh, I see. Then you pampered him.

395
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:10,880
- No, sir!
- We hung that man.

396
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:14,465
Well, you pampered the man...
you pampered the man,

397
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:19,559
and the result of that
is the loss of this poor man's life!

398
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:23,347
- Please, this is outrageous.
- You, you, you...

399
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:27,019
- (woman screams)
- Take your hands off!

400
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:33,656
Realise the fact that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life.

401
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:39,706
If you'd invited me into the neighbourhood
before, it wouldn't have happened.

402
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,835
You've got to give me some thoughts.

403
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,966
I'm gonna turn my horse out.
Then I'll wash my body.

404
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:54,801
And, miss...
the only thing not on my diet

405
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:59,310
would be the green top of the beet
and okra.

406
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:05,524
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

407
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:08,487
Sir. Miss.

408
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:17,948
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?

409
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:22,493
I got recommendations for this man from
all the Wyoming outfits he's worked for.

410
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:25,913
- I'm assured that he's a top regulator.
- Regulator?

411
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:30,294
- You mean you asked him up here?
- You're damn right I did.

412
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:33,677
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

413
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,296
I always wondered
what Lee Clayton looked like.

414
00:39:36,432 --> 00:39:39,303
And smelled like.

415
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:41,724
I always figured him to be a little fella.

416
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:45,473
He's supposed to have a Creedmore rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

417
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:47,850
Supposed to be able
to hit out to 500 yards.

418
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,773
- Oh, Mr Rate. 500 yards...
- I mean it.

419
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:54,072
He never carries a side arm,
so you know he's a dry-gulcher.

420
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,901
But he smells like a wet-gulcher
and he dresses like a clown.

421
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:01,489
He don't have no wife,
but he sure keeps himself spruced up.

422
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:07,164
Many a rustler has said his prayers when
he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts.

423
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:10,582
(chattering and laughter continues)

424
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:17,844
- Daddy, I wanna know how...
- Not now. Shh!

425
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:21,177
- Vern, scat. Out of here.
- You betcha. I will.

426
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:25,974
- Adios, buddies.
- Send you a postal card from Canada.

427
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:28,563
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?

428
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,362
You gotta tend to the cabin
in the breaks, Cary.

429
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:36,529
You don't hear Tom complainin'.
See you in a few weeks, Tom.

430
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:41,118
(horse neighs)

431
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:46,411
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

432
00:40:56,596 --> 00:41:00,179
Well, by gosh. Good mornin' to you, miss.

433
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:04,471
Good morning to you, Mr Logan.
You bought this place already, huh?

434
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,146
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:10,733
I guess that kinda
makes us neighbours, doesn't it?

436
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:15,983
- Where are you headed?
- Oh, I'm gonna go over on the table.

437
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:18,487
Well, may I accompany you?

438
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:20,657
No.

439
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:24,915
- Why not?
- No good reason. I don't want company.

440
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,077
Come on. Give me a chance.

441
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:31,959
Give you a chance.
Give you a chance for what?

442
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:37,511
Miss, I'm gonna take this opportunity
to be just a little damn bit offended.

443
00:41:37,637 --> 00:41:40,175
Cos if there's anybody in this district

444
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:44,802
who's got a right to think of themselves
as wholesome companionship,

445
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:47,605
why, it's yours truly.

446
00:41:52,193 --> 00:41:57,353
If you're such a wholesome companion,
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

447
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,530
Who in the world told you that?

448
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:02,826
Mary O'Connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

449
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,160
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

450
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,456
She told me everything.
We're starved for news out here.

451
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:12,831
- All I ever hear about is grass.
- What's the matter with grass?

452
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:16,499
Samuel Johnson said
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass."

453
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:21,296
- "Tell me about a human being."
- I don't understand that.

454
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:25,678
It just means that Samuel Johnson
was as bored as I am with nature.

455
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,645
We had a famous painter
out here last year.

456
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:33,184
That man must have painted ten square
miles of canvas, not one human face.

457
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:38,478
I wish he'd painted that boy Sandy hangin'
up so decoratively against the mountains.

458
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:40,987
Because his pink tongue and white face

459
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,822
would have set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

460
00:42:43,953 --> 00:42:48,948
I mean, it would have made the
damnedest bank calendar you ever saw.

461
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:54,040
Well, you succeeded. This is where
I was coming to and you're still with me.

462
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:56,627
The persistence
of the young rancher, huh?

463
00:42:56,758 --> 00:43:01,752
- Well, I know what I want is all.
- What do you want?

464
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:04,972
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

465
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:08,551
- Oh, come on!
- "Oh, come on" what?

466
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:13,431
- Why don't you just say what you mean?
- This is what I mean.

467
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:17,646
- Do you want me?
- What does that mean?

468
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:20,982
I mean you're followin' me around.
What you got in mind?

469
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:24,235
- Me?
- Sexual intercourse?

470
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,076
- Oh, my...
- Well, all right.

471
00:43:28,748 --> 00:43:30,456
All right.

472
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,786
Come on. Get down off your horse.

473
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,712
I'm not gonna have any hesitation from
you. Not from a frequenter of whores.

474
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:41,546
All right, all right. Just back off.

475
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:44,631
I'm gonna step down at my own speed.

476
00:43:46,974 --> 00:43:49,014
All right.

477
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:56,180
I'm going to lose it right here,
in all these blades of grass.

478
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,690
Do I have to come to you? All right.

479
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:01,943
- Hold it.
- What?

480
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,943
Who asked you to do all this?

481
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,077
- Well, your entire behaviour...
- Never mind that.

482
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:11,324
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

483
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:13,995
- Well, do you?
- No.

484
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:18,076
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- Keep the dang thing. I don't want it.

485
00:44:18,214 --> 00:44:22,923
- I forgot. You do have your whores.
- Sure do. Like 'em too.

486
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:25,543
I'll tell you something. If you want them...

487
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,306
I keep tellin' ya. I want them a lot.
I don't want you at all.

488
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,593
Why are you bein' so mean to me?

489
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:36,643
People have neglected to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are,

490
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,348
and I'm makin' up for their negligence.

491
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:42,688
I just seem mean.
I'm only being thorough.

492
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:54,829
If you're gonna start that, I'm gonna go
home and shovel manure on the pansies.

493
00:44:56,544 --> 00:45:00,328
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

494
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,383
You gonna talk nice?

495
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,719
I will do my best.

496
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:11,471
You bastard.

497
00:45:12,602 --> 00:45:16,599
- Can I have a kiss?
- No. I hardly know you.

498
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:22,603
Why don't we take a walk and talk about
the Wild West and how to get out of it?

499
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:28,319
Well... all right. I can talk about that.

500
00:45:29,577 --> 00:45:32,412
Cal, I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

501
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:35,658
- A squaw hitch is all you need.
- You'll be gone two weeks?

502
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:40,288
Give or take a few days. Cary, you're
gonna move some stock to make way.

503
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,497
- No more than two...
- Or three at a time.

504
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:46,843
- I've been doin' this for a while.
- I reckon you have. Let's go.

505
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:52,090
Keep low, boy.

506
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:58,809
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

507
00:46:00,983 --> 00:46:03,023
(yelling)

508
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,987
- Stay with your horse.
- Get a hold.

509
00:46:08,491 --> 00:46:11,160
Si, stay with your horse! Si!

510
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:14,868
Goddamn it, he knows what he's doing.

511
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:19,288
Si let go of the rope.

512
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,458
Oh, Jesus.

513
00:46:21,587 --> 00:46:23,959
- Help!
- You're gonna drown!

514
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,331
Help! Get me in.

515
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:35,263
We did it. We crossed
that son of a bitch, didn't we?

516
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:39,307
I couldn't swim,
but I was swimmin', right?

517
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:43,100
I can! I did it!

518
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:45,807
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

519
00:46:45,945 --> 00:46:49,610
We crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit.

520
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,533
Supposin' if the catfish
in that son of a bitch could eat a pig.

521
00:46:54,662 --> 00:46:57,117
Or a chicken.

522
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,456
Get out.

523
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,209
- Easy, now.
- Tom!

524
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,965
Hey, Tom!

525
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:13,179
Huh?

526
00:47:13,306 --> 00:47:16,721
You're the only rancher
who hasn't met the new regulator.

527
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:19,472
Tom Logan, Robert E Lee Clayton.

528
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:24,016
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

529
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,901
Damn near... sucked my boot off.

530
00:47:28,654 --> 00:47:30,777
Pleasure to meet you.

531
00:47:30,906 --> 00:47:34,322
Regulator - ain't that like a dry-gulcher?

532
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:38,155
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

533
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:42,037
Well, a regulator...
Correct me if I'm wrong.

534
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:45,040
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

535
00:47:45,171 --> 00:47:48,290
that shoots people
and don't never get near 'em?

536
00:47:48,424 --> 00:47:50,167
That's it.

537
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:57,306
Well, what about the binoculars?
What are they for?

538
00:47:58,184 --> 00:48:02,312
Well, I've taken to watchin'
funny-lookin' birds.

539
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:05,397
I see.

540
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:07,600
Well, hell, I don't know.

541
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:12,231
I suppose if you didn't get a way off,
a mile or so to do the job,

542
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:14,441
you'd just get messy like I done here.

543
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:17,446
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

544
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:21,907
I've just heard this from all the other
dreamers tryin' to ranch around here.

545
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:28,755
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off
while he was carryin' a pail of water?

546
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:31,550
A mile, well...

547
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,213
But I don't remember the pail.

548
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:36,964
No, sir.

549
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:42,393
When you hang a man,
usually he has a chance to talk,

550
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,770
or say goodbye, write a letter...

551
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,644
Besides, a Creedmore...

552
00:48:51,153 --> 00:48:55,483
- It's a Creedmore, isn't it?
- It is a Creedmore, and a beautiful one.

553
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:58,534
Must make a pretty good
mess of a human.

554
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:02,243
You hit a guy from 500 yards out, say,

555
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:07,580
why, the suddenness of it, he don't have a
few seconds to make his act of contrition.

556
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,333
And you never have to look him in the eye.

557
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:13,086
Right there, that makes all the difference.

558
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:17,297
I would disagree, sir. The thing that
makes all the difference in the world

559
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:21,759
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

560
00:49:22,935 --> 00:49:25,177
This old boy in Wyoming...

561
00:49:25,312 --> 00:49:27,104
Whoa.

562
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:32,893
This old boy in Wyoming, he sat down
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers,

563
00:49:33,028 --> 00:49:37,441
and his skull suddenly flew into pieces
about the size of your thumbnail.

564
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:42,320
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator".

565
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:45,954
- That was the first time.
- First time.

566
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,707
What would be your line of work, sir?

567
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,089
I was in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

568
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:58,586
but I started back in the ranch
south of here.

569
00:49:59,638 --> 00:50:03,138
You started back in? You was before...?

570
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:07,680
My family used to have a place,
but when they lost it I hired out.

571
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:09,889
Oh, I see.

572
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:14,152
I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr Logan.

573
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:16,769
The times are hard on a small operator.

574
00:50:16,906 --> 00:50:18,779
Heyah!

575
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:23,779
I hope the damn horse thieves
leave you something.

576
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:27,198
- I hope so too.
- Good day to you, sir.

577
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,621
Bye-bye now.

578
00:50:29,752 --> 00:50:33,500
This colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

579
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:35,670
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.

580
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,797
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

581
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:43,713
- See you later, Tom. Thanks.
- All right, Mr Braxton.

582
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:46,519
Damn those hands of mine.

583
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:49,809
Good luck, Old Sloppy.

584
00:51:02,785 --> 00:51:04,991
Must have smelled something.

585
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,948
The closer you get towards Canada,
the more things eat your horses.

586
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:14,587
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

587
00:51:14,713 --> 00:51:17,418
Either one would go ahead
and eat your horse...

588
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:19,589
Whoa...

589
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:28,803
Damn! I don't know why they had
to put Canada way the hell up here.

590
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:41,735
Well, hello, Jane.

591
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:44,906
Hello, Tom.

592
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:48,368
I didn't think I'd find you here.

593
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:52,577
- Why'd you think that?
- Cos I haven't seen you.

594
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:57,621
You thought I was gonna
come courtin', didn't ya?

595
00:51:57,756 --> 00:52:00,164
Maybe so. Mm-hm.

596
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:04,797
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

597
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:14,187
That sure is some garden you've started
here. Have you had one before?

598
00:52:14,315 --> 00:52:18,182
No. My aunt had one
and I kinda took it over.

599
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,941
I ain't half bad at it though.

600
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,112
(chuckles) No.

601
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,411
Why don't you get down off your horse?

602
00:52:30,539 --> 00:52:32,579
I will, thank you.

603
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:40,631
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

604
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:47,467
Well, you didn't come courtin' me
like I figured you would, and...

605
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,840
I'm...

606
00:52:49,975 --> 00:52:52,217
You're what?

607
00:52:52,353 --> 00:52:55,603
I'm tryin' to revive your interest.

608
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:58,400
Oh, yeah?

609
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:03,271
Well... come here a minute
and I'll show you something.

610
00:53:08,744 --> 00:53:10,783
All right.

611
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:13,745
Now lift that up.

612
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,959
(water starts flowing)

613
00:53:25,386 --> 00:53:27,425
(Jane laughs)

614
00:53:29,598 --> 00:53:32,765
Close her down. Garden's watered.

615
00:53:36,105 --> 00:53:38,975
I admire you.

616
00:53:39,108 --> 00:53:43,651
Come in the house.
I'll make you a cup of chinee tea.

617
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,818
Chinese tea?

618
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,378
Northern Pacific Railroad.
Where did you get these?

619
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:02,543
Just souvenirs.

620
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,387
Mm...

621
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,221
How long does the tea take?

622
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,595
Five or ten minutes.

623
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,816
Can I come over there?

624
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:32,868
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

625
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,534
Let's go over there.

626
00:54:48,677 --> 00:54:51,002
You sure about that?

627
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:56,139
That's right.

628
00:54:58,312 --> 00:55:01,182
How do you know you're sure about that?

629
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:04,558
Well, why do you think?

630
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:11,441
Cos that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

631
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:15,325
That's right.

632
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,120
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

633
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,666
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

634
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,346
Let's write your father a letter.

635
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:39,218
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the chinee tea slavers.

636
00:56:13,428 --> 00:56:16,299
Would you like to do this?

637
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:22,226
Yeah... I would like to.

638
00:56:23,438 --> 00:56:25,976
That's what I would like to do.

639
00:56:35,909 --> 00:56:37,949
Sorry.

640
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,652
(bird calls)

641
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:17,822
God.

642
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:20,360
God, God.

643
00:57:20,495 --> 00:57:22,535
(shrill bird calls)

644
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:30,835
(mumbles)

645
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,126
Sniper, sniper, sniper.

646
00:57:58,492 --> 00:58:00,817
(whistles imitating bird)

647
00:58:01,995 --> 00:58:04,451
(bugle call)

648
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:25,010
Goddamn. They're pretty.

649
00:58:25,143 --> 00:58:28,975
Yeah. They're neat
little bastards, ain't they?

650
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:33,267
(Cal) Oh, boy. There's more of 'em
than I expected.

651
00:58:33,402 --> 00:58:37,150
(Little Tod) Yeah. Do you suppose
them catfish ever look up?

652
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,151
- Piss on them.
- From up here?

653
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:44,951
Sh!

654
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:50,324
Supposed to be
the best police in the world.

655
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,375
- They don't scare me.
- Me neither.

656
00:58:54,506 --> 00:58:59,002
Let's take these horses to the home
of the brave and the land of the free.

657
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,334
- Not today.
- What?

658
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,796
Not today!

659
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:04,971
Goddamn.

660
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:14,730
I'm gonna have an awful lot of
explaining to do when I get home.

661
00:59:14,863 --> 00:59:18,481
But I'm not gonna lie my way
out of this one.

662
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:20,858
Yes, I am.

663
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:24,363
- Which one?
- I'm gonna lie my way out of it.

664
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,662
- Where'd she go?
- Who?

665
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:31,664
- Your ma.
- Oh...

666
00:59:31,796 --> 00:59:36,505
Well, she listened very carefully
to my father for about three years,

667
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:38,212
weighed every word,

668
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:44,513
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find.

669
00:59:44,642 --> 00:59:50,478
Wait a minute. Stop. This is a nice way
to ride, but I know a much better way.

670
00:59:51,649 --> 00:59:54,105
Where are you goin'?

671
01:00:00,408 --> 01:00:02,448
Ooh!

672
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:07,113
- Well, that is clever.
- Yeah.

673
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:10,083
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?

674
01:00:11,044 --> 01:00:13,286
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

675
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:18,966
My father has a library full of law books,
cos he believes in the law.

676
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:22,676
He says that we haven't got
any law up here yet.

677
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:26,590
What brings that to your mind?

678
01:00:26,726 --> 01:00:32,515
Because in one of those law books of his,
there's a whole section on lewd conduct.

679
01:00:32,649 --> 01:00:36,563
- What about it?
- It's against the law.

680
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:46,406
Are you an outlaw?

681
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:56,338
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow and
100 square foot of root vegetables. Why?

682
01:00:56,464 --> 01:01:00,758
- Why do you have so many guns?
- Because I'm a sportsman.

683
01:01:02,512 --> 01:01:05,382
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?

684
01:01:06,391 --> 01:01:09,890
Well, because I'm a sawed-off sportsman.

685
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:12,012
(chuckles)

686
01:01:12,147 --> 01:01:15,397
Well, something has sure
started in my thinking,

687
01:01:15,525 --> 01:01:20,981
and I don't know why we should go on
if you're just gonna end up dead.

688
01:01:22,323 --> 01:01:24,612
Whoa.

689
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:29,535
Can we get down here
for a while and talk?

690
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:34,711
- Yeah. OK.
- You can make it?

691
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,450

Damn.

706
01:04:57,372 --> 01:05:01,155
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.

707
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:04,542
Well, I'm not the crawlin' kind.

708
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:09,498
I was just passin' by and I thought
I'd ask you a question or two.

709
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:14,011
There was a family of Logans
out of Kaycee, Wyoming.

710
01:05:14,138 --> 01:05:17,507
There was four brothers.
The youngest was a kid named Lonnie.

711
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:19,800
They was all pretty quick,

712
01:05:19,936 --> 01:05:22,640
except for Lonnie -
he was a fiddle player, and...

713
01:05:22,772 --> 01:05:25,227
They killed him off right quick.

714
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:29,023
Some of the ranchers had found him
thievin' or something like that.

715
01:05:29,153 --> 01:05:33,815
Anyway, I was wonderin'...
would they be kin to ya?

716
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,823
No. No.

717
01:05:35,952 --> 01:05:40,412
Well, I didn't think so
because you don't carry a gun.

718
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,579
No, I never carry a gun.

719
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:47,329
I never wear a gun neither.

720
01:05:47,463 --> 01:05:52,090
Oh, once in a while I carry
this little darlin' around.

721
01:05:52,218 --> 01:05:56,679
She's almost like a poem.
You know, it's all hand-done.

722
01:05:56,806 --> 01:05:59,131
Etched, you know, scratched in silver.

723
01:05:59,267 --> 01:06:02,351
Oh, she's a beauty.
Made for the president of Mexico.

724
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:04,886
I diverted it for a hundred-dollar bill.

725
01:06:05,022 --> 01:06:07,893
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.

726
01:06:09,777 --> 01:06:15,364
Some damn fool came along
and filed off the top of the front sight.

727
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:21,202
And you have to sort of play with it.

728
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,666
It isn't easy.

729
01:06:27,795 --> 01:06:30,120
Have a look at the rope.

730
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,969
Not bad.

731
01:06:36,095 --> 01:06:38,135
There's one left.

732
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:48,603
I doubt it.

733
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:09,124
You're smart.

734
01:07:11,422 --> 01:07:13,462
Farmers ain't smart.

735
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:17,126
I don't know exactly where you came
from or what you were doing,

736
01:07:17,261 --> 01:07:23,346
but I think you ought to go back to it,
because you can't farm worth spit.

737
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:30,978
Unless... unless you lost your nerve.

738
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:36,730
In that case, cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered.

739
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:47,246
Is your nerve gone?

740
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:49,830
(sings) Is your nerve gone?

741
01:07:53,422 --> 01:07:55,462
Yah!

742
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:00,050
Easy, easy!

743
01:08:04,392 --> 01:08:08,092
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.

744
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:10,898
How we gonna get 'em
to swim across the Mighty Mo?

745
01:08:11,023 --> 01:08:13,941
If you can get one or two to go,
they'll all go.

746
01:08:14,068 --> 01:08:17,152
Here's the breaks. Come on!

747
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,031
Back in the USA! What a relief.

748
01:08:24,328 --> 01:08:25,573
Hey!

749
01:08:26,205 --> 01:08:28,245
Slow, boys.

750
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:32,584
(gunshot)

751
01:08:32,712 --> 01:08:34,170
Mounties!

752
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:38,795
Come on. Let's get outta here.

753
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:40,800
Get down.

754
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,054
Let's get outta here.

755
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:48,890
Come on! Yah! Yah!

756
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:54,896
(gunshot)

757
01:08:56,986 --> 01:08:58,646
Agh!

758
01:09:04,952 --> 01:09:06,992
Let's go! Let's go!

759
01:09:39,945 --> 01:09:43,528
Wonder where Little Tod
got himself off to.

760
01:09:45,076 --> 01:09:47,115
I don't know.

761
01:09:48,412 --> 01:09:51,532
I don't know where my finger is either.

762
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:58,079
Them Mounties... followed us
right into the United States of America,

763
01:09:58,214 --> 01:10:00,253
got their horses back.

764
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:03,875
It's not even legal!

765
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:11,383
Tie that hand up and let's move. Maybe
we'll meet Little Tod at the Snake's Cross.

766
01:10:13,312 --> 01:10:15,186
(yells)

767
01:10:33,124 --> 01:10:35,163
(squawks)

768
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:38,352
Come on.

769
01:11:38,481 --> 01:11:40,520
Come on. Go! Go!

770
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,207
Whoa, there.

771
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:43,328
(laughs)

772
01:12:47,049 --> 01:12:50,133
Do you always get off
your horse that way?

773
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:55,050
I'm not chasin' you.

774
01:12:55,182 --> 01:12:59,595
- Who did you think was after you?
- This is the haunt of thieves and killers.

775
01:12:59,728 --> 01:13:01,970
Oh, shit. Here.

776
01:13:02,773 --> 01:13:08,858
This ain't the haunt of nothin' but
diamondbacks and old farts like me.

777
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:13,570
- Who are ya?
- My name's Jim Ferguson.

778
01:13:14,577 --> 01:13:17,198
I'm pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

779
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:19,286
Tod La Frambois.

01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:21,454
La Frambois.

781
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:26,453
- What's your trade, Mr La Frambois?
- Trade?

782
01:13:26,589 --> 01:13:30,966
Well, I been in the...
farm implement business.

783
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:36,432
Now I'm lookin' to get on with the ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.

784
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:39,596
That'd be over that way.

785
01:13:45,482 --> 01:13:49,895
I tell you what. I got a nice hare
on a stick over here.

786
01:13:52,031 --> 01:13:54,070
Let's go have a bite to eat.

787
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:56,869

All I know, Jim, is that...

life is not like anything I ever seen before.

802
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:26,788

It's really strange runnin' into a preacher
out here, in this hellhole.

804
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:39,385
I believe that life is
like a mountain railway,

01:15:39,513 --> 01:15:42,964
but not for the reasons in the song.

806
01:15:43,809 --> 01:15:46,217
I think life is like a mountain railway

807
01:15:46,353 --> 01:15:51,858
cos you don't have no idea what sleazy
son of a bitch got his hand on the throttle.

808
01:15:51,984 --> 01:15:55,816
That's a real strange attitude
for a preacher.

809
01:16:00,075 --> 01:16:02,566
Yep.

810
01:16:02,703 --> 01:16:05,158
I ain't no preacher.

811
01:16:11,003 --> 01:16:12,794
What do you do?

812
01:16:12,921 --> 01:16:16,836
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.

813
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:20,418
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.

814
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:23,306
Not doin' too good at it neither.

815
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:26,801
Otherwise I wouldn't be eatin' hare.

816
01:16:26,935 --> 01:16:29,391
I'd be in Dodge City,

817
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:33,353
playin' with them big asses,
drinkin' champagne.

818

819
01:16:36,028 --> 01:16:39,563
What about yourself there, Tod?

820
01:16:39,698 --> 01:16:41,691
What do you do?

821
01:16:41,825 --> 01:16:47,864
Well, there's really nothin' to say.
I'm a single man. Implement business.

822
01:16:50,334 --> 01:16:54,201
- Where you got this implement business?
- It's in Big Sandy.

823
01:16:54,338 --> 01:16:56,911
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.

824
01:16:57,049 --> 01:16:59,800
- No, I mean Big Sandy. Big...
- (laughs)

825
01:17:03,055 --> 01:17:05,890
I was raised up in Big Sandy.

826
01:17:06,016 --> 01:17:10,345
There ain't a teeny-weeny
implement business in Big Sandy,

827
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:13,148
and not in Shonkin Sag neither.

828
01:17:15,484 --> 01:17:20,561
Mr Ferguson, I'm really grateful to you
for your hospitality and everything,

829
01:17:20,697 --> 01:17:23,817
but my line of work is
none of your damn business.

830
01:17:23,951 --> 01:17:28,529
I'm sorry, Tod. I didn't mean
to get you all riled up like that.

831
01:17:28,664 --> 01:17:31,036
I'll tell you what.

832
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:36,077
Maybe one of these days, I'll get
a chance to cook your supper for you.

833
01:17:36,213 --> 01:17:39,796
Hah! Hooray for a free dang meal.

834
01:17:41,969 --> 01:17:43,249
Good.

835
01:17:43,387 --> 01:17:45,426
Thank God.

836
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:53,724
I hope you keep my business
to yourself too.

837
01:17:53,856 --> 01:17:56,144
Hey. You got my word.

838
01:17:57,150 --> 01:17:59,688
That's good enough. (hums)

839
01:18:27,097 --> 01:18:29,635
(snoring)

840
01:18:45,616 --> 01:18:48,985
What the hell's goin' on here?

841
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:52,868
Goddamn. What the hell's
the matter with you?

842
01:18:52,998 --> 01:18:56,331
Something... I don't know...

843
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:59,247
Tryin' to get some sleep here.

844
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:14,510
I want you to cinch up good
on the knot there.

845
01:19:14,645 --> 01:19:17,681
- Yeah, I did.
- All right, now don't have fear.

846
01:19:17,814 --> 01:19:20,685
This is the way my daddy taught me, now.

847
01:19:23,153 --> 01:19:26,189
Easy aces, now. Come on.

848
01:19:26,323 --> 01:19:28,565
Come on.

849
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:35,118
- This is the part I hate. I can't swim a lick.
- Come on.

850
01:19:35,249 --> 01:19:37,288
- What do I do?
- Now slide off.

851
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:41,118
Slide off. Let her go.
Let the horse go. Don't hold on.

852
01:19:41,255 --> 01:19:44,090
- That's it. Now we're doin' it.
- Whoo-hoo!

853
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:46,885
I got you now.

854
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:49,050
Damn!

855
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:53,632
- Hell, this is easy.
- Up on that beast now.

856
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:57,469
You're halfway to the barn now, laddie.

857
01:19:57,604 --> 01:20:00,142
- Halfway.
- Yee-hah!

858
01:20:00,274 --> 01:20:03,642
Come on! We've cut that son of a bitch.

859
01:20:05,862 --> 01:20:08,947
We cut that goddamn thing
slicker than butter.

860
01:20:09,074 --> 01:20:12,443
Listen, you go on ahead now.

861
01:20:12,577 --> 01:20:15,531
You go on over there
and I'll secure the rope here.

862
01:20:15,664 --> 01:20:17,953
- You got a good hold on that?
- Yeah.

863
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:23,587
You get goin' now, and then you pull me
in case something happens to me.

864
01:20:23,714 --> 01:20:25,753
Yah!

865
01:20:26,591 --> 01:20:28,549
Let her go now.

866
01:20:29,052 --> 01:20:31,092
I don't know about this.

867
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,131
That's it. Go ahead.

868
01:20:36,268 --> 01:20:37,347
In you go.

869
01:20:37,477 --> 01:20:40,099
Damn horse won't swim. Come on.

870
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:43,017
- Dig your heels in now.
- This isn't bad at all.

871
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,264
Yah!

872
01:20:45,152 --> 01:20:47,144
I can't swim. Bring me in.

873
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,196
Now, you dirt turkey,
are you gonna talk to me?

874
01:20:50,324 --> 01:20:53,111
You gonna tell me somethin' now?

875
01:20:53,243 --> 01:20:58,071
Listen, son, you got two choices now.
Drink this muddy son of a bitch,

876
01:20:58,206 --> 01:21:01,160
or tell me about Tom Logan
and your goddamn rustlin'.

877
01:21:01,293 --> 01:21:03,700
You... You son...

878
01:21:03,837 --> 01:21:07,206
- I'm gonna give you one...
- I'm not gonna say anything.

879
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:09,796
Mr La Frambois, one.

880
01:21:12,512 --> 01:21:13,675
Agh!

881
01:21:24,232 --> 01:21:26,474
Adios, amigo.

882
01:22:02,145 --> 01:22:04,185
(neighs)

883
01:22:05,273 --> 01:22:07,349
That's Little Tod's horse.

884
01:22:07,484 --> 01:22:09,726
Damned if it ain't.

885
01:22:14,616 --> 01:22:17,819
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?

886
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:20,660
- I don't know.
- Cal?

887
01:22:24,334 --> 01:22:27,501
- What is it?
- What the hell's goin' on?

888
01:22:27,629 --> 01:22:29,835
Let's get inside.

889
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:37,424
- What's happening?
- Lee Clayton. Lee Clayton!

890
01:22:41,059 --> 01:22:45,472
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're goin' to a picnic.

891
01:22:48,567 --> 01:22:50,606
(Clayton whistling)

892
01:22:52,863 --> 01:22:54,654
He never will close that gate.

893
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:58,364
It wasn't near as gloomy around here
when we only had rustlers.

894
01:22:58,493 --> 01:23:02,657
Never seen nothin' like him. Come on.

895
01:23:02,789 --> 01:23:06,787
Never thought Mr Braxton
would call in a man like that.

896
01:23:11,923 --> 01:23:13,963
(laughs)

897
01:23:16,803 --> 01:23:20,053
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.

898
01:23:20,182 --> 01:23:21,925
Mm...

899
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:26,637
Well, what kind of trip did you have?

900
01:23:29,774 --> 01:23:32,312
What did you learn?

901
01:23:32,444 --> 01:23:38,280
Lower your voice. I feel an attack of gas
and that could be perilous to both of us.

902
01:23:38,408 --> 01:23:40,650
(farts) That's good.

903
01:23:44,873 --> 01:23:47,364
What did you learn?

904
01:23:50,086 --> 01:23:54,832
The one man that could have told me
something didn't tell me nothing,

905
01:23:54,966 --> 01:23:58,798
and then he upped and drowned himself
in the Missouri River.

906
01:24:00,597 --> 01:24:03,088
You've got no further
than we did without you.

907
01:24:03,225 --> 01:24:07,174
Oh, I can track a bluebottle fly
right up your nose.

908
01:24:07,312 --> 01:24:11,179
And I've taken to trackin'
what people are thinkin'.

909
01:24:11,316 --> 01:24:13,641
Where's your wife?

910
01:24:13,777 --> 01:24:16,446
What has that got to... Damn it!

911
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:19,944
I detest your impertinence.

912
01:24:20,075 --> 01:24:24,701
You stay out of my private life,
you lilac-smellin' son of a bitch.

913
01:24:26,623 --> 01:24:30,241
You ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.

914
01:24:30,377 --> 01:24:33,911
I've met ranchers, outlaws,
stock detectives

915
01:24:34,047 --> 01:24:37,914
who thought they was
mental wizards like yourself.

916
01:24:38,051 --> 01:24:42,262
There was one thing I could
never understand and that was...

917
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:45,674
"Why can't they hang on to their women?"

918
01:24:45,809 --> 01:24:49,641
You're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.

919
01:24:49,771 --> 01:24:51,847
So you're gonna stop.

920
01:24:51,982 --> 01:24:54,936
You're gonna stop spying on me
and on my family.

921
01:24:55,068 --> 01:24:57,357
You were never hired to do that.

922
01:24:57,487 --> 01:24:59,895
I do not, and Jane does not,

923
01:25:00,031 --> 01:25:03,863
and the dozen dolts who work for me
do not steal horses.

924
01:25:05,996 --> 01:25:09,032
But somebody does, don't he?

925
01:25:22,095 --> 01:25:24,135
(hoof beats)

926
01:25:31,438 --> 01:25:34,889
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

927
01:25:35,984 --> 01:25:37,893
- Cal!
- Long time, Logan.

928
01:25:38,028 --> 01:25:42,108
Cal, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine. Jane Braxton.

929
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,526
- How do?
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

930
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,994
She was born and bred here, Cal,
and ready for city lights.

931
01:25:49,122 --> 01:25:52,456
Pretty ladies should have what they want.

932
01:25:52,584 --> 01:25:55,869
- How's the ranch comin', Tom?
- You want a tour?

933
01:25:57,422 --> 01:25:59,913
Sure do.

934
01:26:00,050 --> 01:26:02,505
I'll see you later. Bye.

935
01:26:13,146 --> 01:26:16,764
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.

936
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,600
This little bastard was
in sorry shape before I got to it.

937
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:25,482
These trees wouldn't have turned out
a peck of apples apiece.

938
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:30,195
No wonder that guy's makin' barrels in
town. He wasn't running this place right.

939
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:33,247
This tree was all full of scale and blight.

940
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:39,744
These limbs I dug out of here had borers
in 'em and insect eggs all over everything.

941
01:26:39,881 --> 01:26:41,708
It was...

942
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:46,888
Little Tod didn't come home.

943
01:26:54,771 --> 01:26:56,894
What the hell are you doin'?

944
01:26:57,023 --> 01:27:03,108
What difference does it make whether
blight or borers eat up this whole ranch?

945
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:08,159
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.

946
01:27:10,412 --> 01:27:13,697
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.

947
01:27:25,885 --> 01:27:28,341
Poor Little Tod.

948
01:27:46,072 --> 01:27:48,907
Gimme that cartridge.

949
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:57,291
That girl's old man
hired Lee Clayton, didn't he?

950
01:27:59,461 --> 01:28:02,248
Yeah. He did.

951
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:05,915
What about her? Where's her husband at?

952
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:09,550
She don't have a husband.
She don't need one.

953
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,431
She don't need one.

954
01:28:12,557 --> 01:28:16,092
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't ya?

955
01:28:16,227 --> 01:28:21,601
- It's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?
- I wouldn't know.

956
01:28:21,733 --> 01:28:25,481
Not since that dog of mine
put his tongue on the butter.

957
01:28:47,258 --> 01:28:49,298
Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?

958
01:28:49,427 --> 01:28:53,756
You betcha. Moved right in.
Made himself at home. Boy!

959
01:28:56,768 --> 01:28:58,807
Robert Lee?

960
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:15,156
(Clayton singing)

961
01:29:23,461 --> 01:29:25,703
Robert Lee.

962
01:29:30,301 --> 01:29:35,426
You know, the old man built this tub
for the old lady, and she ran out on him.

963
01:29:35,557 --> 01:29:38,723
Wasn't that you callin' me out there?

964
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:41,389
Yes, son. That was me.

965
01:29:41,521 --> 01:29:44,308
There's no way you can win, you know.

966
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,472
What?

967
01:29:45,608 --> 01:29:47,435
- There's no way you can win.
- Win?

968
01:29:47,569 --> 01:29:51,269
It's kin of mine is all
that calls me Robert Lee.

969
01:29:51,406 --> 01:29:53,731
I'm going to bust your fat ass.

970
01:29:55,618 --> 01:29:59,996
How am I to get my nourishment
spending my dinner hour here with you?

971
01:30:00,123 --> 01:30:05,164
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.

972
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:13,011
It just ain't in the cards, angel.

973
01:30:13,136 --> 01:30:16,635
Can't you see that the list
is as long as my arm?

974
01:30:16,764 --> 01:30:19,255
You're under the headin'
of what I do for a livin'.

975
01:30:19,392 --> 01:30:23,686
Now step outside, because
my stomach has commenced to growl.

976
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,479
Are you scared?

977
01:30:29,527 --> 01:30:31,769
Shakin' all over.

978
01:30:31,905 --> 01:30:35,190
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.

979
01:30:36,242 --> 01:30:38,780
But I can't lose this appetite.
What ails me?

980
01:30:38,912 --> 01:30:43,704
You're floatin' there in your confirmation
dress waitin' for God to save ya.

981
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:47,878
Did it ever bother you, sittin' up there
in that cabin drinkin' coffee,

982
01:30:48,004 --> 01:30:52,547
while that fiddler's wife
was screamin' in the Sandwash?

983
01:30:54,427 --> 01:30:58,507
Well, first off... I don't drink coffee.

984
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,640
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.

985
01:31:01,768 --> 01:31:05,018
Where's your Creedmore at, Robert Lee?

986
01:31:05,146 --> 01:31:09,274
Where's your cabbage-shootin' Mexican
pistola with flowers on the handle?

987
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,235
Why don't you go get it?

988
01:31:13,321 --> 01:31:15,859
That settles it.

989
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:17,864
I'm not that hungry

990
01:31:17,992 --> 01:31:22,903
and I'll stay here till someone fetches me
who cares about my welfare.

991
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,657
- I deplore...
- Get up, you dry-gulchin' piece of slime.

992
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:28,916
A little bathe in the tub here...

993
01:31:29,045 --> 01:31:30,669
Get up!

994
01:31:31,172 --> 01:31:33,081
Get up!

995
01:31:33,216 --> 01:31:37,427
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.

996
01:31:43,393 --> 01:31:44,970
Well?

997
01:31:59,826 --> 01:32:00,821
(gunshot)

998
01:32:00,952 --> 01:32:03,573
(water dripping)

999
01:32:10,503 --> 01:32:12,875
My God. You ain't even there.

1000
01:32:39,407 --> 01:32:41,446
Did you kill him?

1001
01:32:41,576 --> 01:32:47,946
No, I just emptied his tub. Somebody's
gonna have to do something about that.

1002
01:33:06,517 --> 01:33:08,557
What's become of Tom?

1003
01:33:10,396 --> 01:33:13,433
- Isn't he on his place?
- No, he's not.

1004
01:33:13,566 --> 01:33:18,192
Well, that's not what I call ranching.
I know what you're driving at.

1005
01:33:18,321 --> 01:33:22,318
All I can tell you is that things have
been nearly as bad as they could be.

1006
01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:26,495
If those two men have reason to look
for one another, I'm not interfering.

1007
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:29,112
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him.

1008
01:33:29,248 --> 01:33:30,826
No.

1009
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:33,449
You can't.

1010
01:33:33,586 --> 01:33:35,543
I won't.

1011
01:33:36,339 --> 01:33:39,459
I hope that you choke on that.

1012
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:45,055
You don't mean that, darling.

1013
01:33:46,224 --> 01:33:48,465
- Vern, scat.
- You betcha.

1014
01:33:49,852 --> 01:33:53,055
I wouldn't have hired Lee
if the rustlers hadn't killed Pete.

1015
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:56,309
This has nothing to do with Pete,
law, or stealing horses.

1016
01:33:56,442 --> 01:33:59,562
- Then what does it have to do with?
- Tom Logan.

1017
01:33:59,695 --> 01:34:02,021
Tom Logan.

1018
01:34:03,157 --> 01:34:08,115
- I never even think about him.
- You can't bear me being with him.

1019
01:34:08,246 --> 01:34:13,786
Now, Daddy, goddamn it.
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

1020
01:34:13,918 --> 01:34:18,496
You think I couldn't bear living here alone,
don't you? Start me thinking.

1021
01:34:18,631 --> 01:34:20,671
No... No.

1022
01:34:22,051 --> 01:34:24,672
No, I won't. I won't.

1023
01:34:28,349 --> 01:34:31,516
- (horse snorts)
- (Logan) Whoa, Buck.

1024
01:34:31,644 --> 01:34:34,349
- Oh...
- What the hell are you doin'?

1025
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:39,854
- Cal's got me lookin' out for Lee Clayton.
- Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.

1026
01:34:39,986 --> 01:34:44,197
Gimme a hand. Goddamn it.
Easy, Buck. Come on now.

1027
01:34:45,032 --> 01:34:49,077
Only goddamn intelligent horse.
Easy, boy.

1028
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,619
I had him.

1029
01:34:58,296 --> 01:35:04,001
You think anybody could do it?
I mean... an ordinary fella?

1030
01:35:07,889 --> 01:35:09,928
I don't know.

1031
01:35:12,185 --> 01:35:17,143
Seems like somebody oughta
be able to get the job done.

1032
01:35:17,273 --> 01:35:19,728
Just watch it is all.

1033
01:35:22,737 --> 01:35:25,488
I'll tell you one thing, though.

1034
01:35:26,574 --> 01:35:28,613
Don't start talkin' to him.

1035
01:35:28,743 --> 01:35:32,112
I don't care what the plan is,
as long as you get us outta here.

1036
01:35:32,246 --> 01:35:36,955
That's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.

1037
01:35:37,084 --> 01:35:39,836
We're gonna hit Braxton.

1038
01:35:39,962 --> 01:35:44,340
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock an' all.

1039
01:35:44,467 --> 01:35:48,085
- That's the least we can do.
- And maybe flush us a regulator.

1040
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:51,138
I would love to include the old man.

1041
01:35:51,265 --> 01:35:53,970
A .44-40 in the brain
would be my sentence for him.

1042
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:56,936
I don't know why you don't want
to go along with that.

1043
01:35:57,063 --> 01:35:58,473
I'd just sooner we didn't.

1044
01:35:58,606 --> 01:36:02,224
I wanna know on what grounds
you don't wanna shoot Braxton!

1045
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,859
We ain't gonna do it
because I said we ain't gonna do it!

1046
01:36:07,823 --> 01:36:10,030
Am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?

1047
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,828
Goddamn it, let's not start that stuff.

1048
01:36:12,954 --> 01:36:16,572
Really, Tom, it's only
gonna wreck the whole job.

1049
01:36:16,707 --> 01:36:18,747
Cal?

1050
01:36:31,681 --> 01:36:35,215
Hey, Woodruff.
Braxton got you nighthawking.

1051
01:36:35,351 --> 01:36:37,806
Mr Logan, what you doin'
out of bed at this hour?

1052
01:36:37,937 --> 01:36:42,563
Lookin' for a better life, Woodruff. What
do you know that's new and exciting?

1053
01:36:42,692 --> 01:36:46,820
- Same old thing.
- What do you got in here?

1054
01:36:46,946 --> 01:36:49,271
Oh...

1055
01:36:49,407 --> 01:36:50,569
37.

1056
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:53,784
And I got the walkin' horse, but...

1057
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:57,990
You're gonna take 'em.

1058
01:36:58,124 --> 01:37:01,493
You bet. You wanna get down now?

1059
01:37:01,627 --> 01:37:06,752
And reach me over that bird's head Colt
you got stuck in your shirt there.

1060
01:37:06,882 --> 01:37:10,049
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.

1061
01:37:28,779 --> 01:37:34,153
- You think you're smart, don't you?
- Well, I ain't dumb and I ain't tied up.

1062
01:37:35,244 --> 01:37:37,450
You just lay on that soft spot.

1063
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:41,280
- You're slicker than snot on a door knob.
- Thank you, Cary.

1064
01:37:46,422 --> 01:37:48,461
I tell you one goddamn thing.

1065
01:37:48,591 --> 01:37:54,463
Old Braxton's gonna be one
surprised-assed son of a bitch, ain't he?

1066
01:37:55,931 --> 01:38:01,436
I regret Pete Marker wasn't here
to get the news, that sorry bag of shit.

1067
01:38:01,562 --> 01:38:05,097
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch.

1068
01:38:05,232 --> 01:38:09,444
Shut up, Si, or you'll push these horses
all the way down to Kansas without us.

1069
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:13,153
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.

1070
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:38,674
That relay ranch is dead.
Anybody got a preferred district?

1071
01:38:38,808 --> 01:38:41,049
- Hellsgate for me.
- Big Hole.

1072
01:38:41,185 --> 01:38:44,139
Big Hole. I'll meet you there. Cal?

1073
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:47,762
Dodge Pole. Shit, that's all that's left.

1074
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,936
- We'll meet back at the old cabin. Cary?
- All right.

1075
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:55,483
Remember, I wanna get $20 a head
for these or we're doing this job...

1076
01:39:10,089 --> 01:39:14,550
I could have picked off one or two of them
maybe, but we'd have lost the rest.

1077
01:39:14,677 --> 01:39:20,382
Supposin' you had a barn full of nasty
old bats. You wanted to get rid of them.

1078
01:39:20,516 --> 01:39:25,392
The worst thing you could do is just
get your gun and start shootin' around.

1079
01:39:25,521 --> 01:39:27,727
What good would it do you?

1080
01:39:27,857 --> 01:39:31,060
They'd leave and they'd be back
by 7.30 in the morning.

1081
01:39:31,193 --> 01:39:35,405
If you want to get rid of a whole lot
of evil bats, there's only one way.

1082
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:39,529
And the way is this.
You wait till the dawn comes.

1083
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:43,243
About 4.30 and you're waitin'
outside by the barrels.

1084
01:39:43,372 --> 01:39:48,034
Then you close the door real quick
and all the bats are inside.

1085
01:39:48,169 --> 01:39:51,787
Then while they're sleepin',
the lovely little sweethearts,

1086
01:39:51,922 --> 01:39:55,374
you have every one of the dirty
little buggers at your mercy.

1087
01:39:55,509 --> 01:40:00,255
- That's the only way you can do it.
- That's all very informative.

1088
01:40:00,389 --> 01:40:02,845
But every horse I own is gone.

1089
01:40:02,975 --> 01:40:06,640
The only way you're going
to get paid is if I get them back.

1090
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:09,261
(laughs) Golly.

1091
01:40:09,398 --> 01:40:12,019
I don't care a damn about that. Come on.

1092
01:40:12,151 --> 01:40:14,190
Always finish the work.

1093
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:19,112
And... I don't give a damn
whether or not I get paid.

1094
01:40:19,241 --> 01:40:25,326
And, uh... talkin' about horses, I think
I know the horse you're worrying about.

1095
01:40:25,456 --> 01:40:28,457
- He wears a black hat, he's two-legged...
- Shut up.

1096
01:40:28,584 --> 01:40:30,992
..and I think I know
where he stands at stud.

1097
01:40:31,128 --> 01:40:33,880
Shut up! You're out of control.
You're through.

1098
01:40:34,006 --> 01:40:36,331
I want you off the place. Now get!

1099
01:40:36,467 --> 01:40:39,468
Well, it is your place, sir.

1100
01:40:39,595 --> 01:40:44,304
But the work is mine
and I'll have the say about that.

1101
01:40:44,433 --> 01:40:45,678
(sings)

1102
01:40:45,809 --> 01:40:48,431
Come on, Jess.
We know when we're not wanted.

1103
01:40:48,562 --> 01:40:51,729
Let's go out to the bat hunt now.

1104
01:40:51,857 --> 01:40:57,397
You lazy no-good bastards, get back
to work or I'll fire every one of you!

1105
01:41:06,372 --> 01:41:08,411
(bird call)

1106
01:41:14,922 --> 01:41:17,876
They call this country Hellsgate.

1107
01:41:19,969 --> 01:41:25,046
When my dad came in here, it was
nothing but a bunch of savage Indians...

1108
01:41:25,182 --> 01:41:27,222
and Jesuits.

1109
01:41:29,478 --> 01:41:35,398
Old Thomas Jefferson said that he was
a warrior so his son could be a farmer,

1110
01:41:35,526 --> 01:41:38,195
so his son could be a poet.

1111
01:41:41,657 --> 01:41:45,785
I raise cattle
so my son can be a merchant,

1112
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:48,912
so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island, buy a sailboat

1113
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:55,243
and never see one of these bastard-assed
son-of-a-bitchin' mountains again.

1114
01:41:58,299 --> 01:42:00,754
Who was Thomas Jefferson?

1115
01:42:03,887 --> 01:42:06,557
Guy back east.

1116
01:42:09,935 --> 01:42:13,102
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.

1117
01:42:13,230 --> 01:42:15,057
That's true.

1118
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:17,728
Mother, you wanna show
our boy the bunkhouse?

1119
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:21,644
Surely. I'll bring him a blanket.

1120
01:42:23,407 --> 01:42:26,159
I'll see you before
you start out in the morning.

1121
01:42:26,285 --> 01:42:28,491
Fine.

1122
01:42:28,621 --> 01:42:31,705
Let me thank you again
for selling me those horses.

1123
01:42:31,832 --> 01:42:33,872
It's my pleasure.

1124
01:42:34,918 --> 01:42:38,453
My compliments to the artist
that changed those brands.

1125
01:42:38,589 --> 01:42:40,878
Was it you?

1126
01:42:42,509 --> 01:42:46,887
I learned it from a nice boy from
Newport, Rhode Island, with no sailboat.

1127
01:42:47,014 --> 01:42:52,470
They hung him in a cottonwood south of
the Shonkin Sag, by the neck, until dead.

1128
01:43:03,864 --> 01:43:06,735
- You've got five minutes.
- OK. Sh.

1129
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:12,987
Wait. It would help if you got
out of your drawers altogether.

1130
01:43:13,123 --> 01:43:15,032
- No.
- Sh.

1131
01:43:15,167 --> 01:43:19,876
- What good is it keepin' them on one leg?
- Why don't you shut up?

1132
01:43:20,964 --> 01:43:24,547
You've only got four of your minutes left.

1133
01:43:27,304 --> 01:43:30,590
Besides, I'm beginning to chafe.

1134
01:43:32,976 --> 01:43:34,803
Agh!

1135
01:43:35,646 --> 01:43:37,888
(screams)

1136
01:43:39,733 --> 01:43:43,601
- Hon? Honey?
- (continues screaming)

1137
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,080
(distant explosion)

1138
01:44:17,438 --> 01:44:20,011
Kid. Hey, kid.

1139
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:23,185
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey
and the rest is yours.

1140
01:44:23,318 --> 01:44:26,853
- Good stuff. Go on. Hurry up.
- (distant explosion)

1141
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,157
Hurry up.

1142
01:44:36,665 --> 01:44:39,073
Thanks.

1143
01:45:03,692 --> 01:45:05,732
Hold these, junior.

1144
01:45:07,738 --> 01:45:11,107
I won't be but a minute,
then we'll go get something to eat.

1145
01:45:21,251 --> 01:45:23,291
Hey!

1146
01:45:26,882 --> 01:45:29,836
Hey! Hey!

1147
01:45:34,598 --> 01:45:36,222
Hey!

1148
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,477
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:45:54,827 --> 01:45:57,697
I ain't got but $54, mister.

1150
01:45:57,829 --> 01:46:01,115
But I want all three horses or nothing.

1151
01:46:03,126 --> 01:46:05,368
What you got to trade?

1152
01:46:07,172 --> 01:46:09,212
A clarinet. (laughs)

1153
01:46:15,347 --> 01:46:18,182
All right, I'll take it.

1154
01:47:05,689 --> 01:47:07,728
(puffing)

1155
01:47:08,734 --> 01:47:10,773
(squeaky notes)

1156
01:47:37,888 --> 01:47:40,758
I can't use it. It looks too tight.

1157
01:47:45,646 --> 01:47:48,812
Here. Let me try it on.

1158
01:47:50,317 --> 01:47:53,900
Put your arm in. You can't tell till it's on.

1159
01:47:54,029 --> 01:47:56,567
Oh, it fits...

1160
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,868
I don't want the goddamn thing.

1161
01:48:44,496 --> 01:48:46,821
(neighing)

1162
01:48:48,333 --> 01:48:50,456
(laughs)

1163
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:05,930
Smoked meat!

1164
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:19,770
(groans)

1165
01:49:25,203 --> 01:49:27,825
Old smoked meat.

1166
01:49:35,255 --> 01:49:37,711
Where's Tom Logan?

1167
01:49:45,807 --> 01:49:48,974
I couldn't get him to come out.

1168
01:49:49,102 --> 01:49:51,142
God!

1169
01:49:54,858 --> 01:49:57,645
Too proud, huh?

1170
01:49:58,612 --> 01:50:00,651
I reckon.

1171
01:50:06,703 --> 01:50:08,577
(crashing)

1172
01:50:10,707 --> 01:50:14,325
I'd like about anything
but getting burned up.

1173
01:50:28,475 --> 01:50:32,686
Well, you're about
the last of your kind, old man.

1174
01:50:35,065 --> 01:50:38,350
If I was a better businessman
than I am a manhunter,

1175
01:50:38,485 --> 01:50:41,154
I'd put you in the circus.

1176
01:50:51,081 --> 01:50:56,371
You know, about this time of year -
Indian summer - gettin' there...

1177
01:50:56,503 --> 01:50:59,753
they say you can see
the Star of Bethlehem,

1178
01:50:59,881 --> 01:51:02,586
if you look real good.

1179
01:51:02,717 --> 01:51:08,471
I seen it once or twice. But you gotta look
away and then you gotta look at it, see?

1180
01:51:08,598 --> 01:51:12,430
You gotta look at it
just a minute, like that, see?

1181
01:51:14,896 --> 01:51:17,387
See what I mean?

1182
01:51:40,922 --> 01:51:45,252
Well, old Granny's gettin' tired now.

1183
01:51:54,352 --> 01:51:56,392
(Clayton singing)

1184
01:52:46,529 --> 01:52:48,072
(neighing)

1185
01:52:53,203 --> 01:52:55,242
Cal?

1186
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,999
Si?

1187
01:53:16,309 --> 01:53:19,061
Oh... Oh...

1188
01:53:21,606 --> 01:53:23,978
Oh, my God.

1189
01:54:19,664 --> 01:54:20,779
(kisses)

1190
01:54:20,915 --> 01:54:22,955
No. Kiss first.

1191
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:26,208
Kiss first.

1192
01:54:31,384 --> 01:54:34,136
You have the lips of Salome,

1193
01:54:34,262 --> 01:54:36,718
and the eyes of Cleopatra.

1194
01:54:41,936 --> 01:54:43,976
(humming)

1195
01:54:46,066 --> 01:54:47,892
(plays harmonica)

1196
01:54:49,444 --> 01:54:54,402
I dedicate this song
to the only woman I ever loved.

1197
01:54:57,786 --> 01:55:01,830
I'm too shy to turn around
and say it to your face,

1198
01:55:01,956 --> 01:55:05,041
but I mean it from my heart.

1199
01:55:05,168 --> 01:55:07,457
I don't love you, you harlot.

1200
01:55:07,587 --> 01:55:11,501
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?

1201
01:55:14,636 --> 01:55:17,341
Come on. Would you?

1202
01:55:19,682 --> 01:55:24,309
That for you, and your disloyalty
and your treachery.

1203
01:55:25,688 --> 01:55:27,728
Dear heart.

1204
01:55:32,946 --> 01:55:34,985
(mumbles)

1205
01:55:42,288 --> 01:55:45,622
Grandma... Grandma.

1206
01:55:49,504 --> 01:55:52,789
Say good night to Granny.

1207
01:55:52,924 --> 01:55:55,676
I'll play you a tune.

1208
01:56:03,143 --> 01:56:05,182
(horse urinates)

1209
01:56:12,819 --> 01:56:16,437
Well, that's a fine thing.

1210
01:56:16,573 --> 01:56:21,069
You've pissed right in the middle
of my love song.

1211
01:56:21,202 --> 01:56:22,198
(laughs)

1212
01:56:22,328 --> 01:56:24,950
God! Pissin' over my song.

1213
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:45,639
Well...

1214
01:57:12,503 --> 01:57:15,339
(gasps)

1215
01:57:15,465 --> 01:57:18,335
(Logan) You know what woke you up?

1216
01:57:20,428 --> 01:57:23,595
Lee, you just had your throat cut.

1217
01:57:54,587 --> 01:57:57,125
(footsteps)

1218
01:58:02,637 --> 01:58:04,926
Where is he?

1219
01:58:23,366 --> 01:58:26,237
He's in there.

1220
01:58:39,465 --> 01:58:43,510
All the rest of the hands left
a couple of days ago except for Vern.

1221
01:58:43,636 --> 01:58:47,883
- I'm stayin'. You betcha.
- It's all right, Vern.

1222
01:58:51,311 --> 01:58:57,645
I told him I was leaving last night
and he... sort of came unravelled.

1223
01:58:57,775 --> 01:59:00,942
He's just lost himself.

1224
01:59:02,947 --> 01:59:05,984
Well, all I can say is
he'd better leave the room,

1225
01:59:06,117 --> 01:59:09,034
cos I'm gonna do it regardless.

1226
01:59:09,162 --> 01:59:12,447
Get out of the way, Vern.
You recognise this?

1227
01:59:14,167 --> 01:59:17,915
- You recognise it?
- (Vern) No. No.

1228
01:59:18,046 --> 01:59:20,584
Please, don't shoot him.

1229
01:59:20,715 --> 01:59:23,632
What are you caterwauling about, Vern?

1230
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,966
Get out of the way
before I put one into you.

1231
01:59:26,095 --> 01:59:29,262
You might as well. He's all I got. No...

1232
01:59:30,433 --> 01:59:33,517
He's all I have. He's all I have.

1233
01:59:33,644 --> 01:59:36,432
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shoot me.

1234
01:59:38,066 --> 01:59:40,521
(Vern) Shoot me. Yes, shoot me.

1235
01:59:42,737 --> 01:59:45,821
- Praise the Lord.
- Get out! Get that son of a bitch away.

1236
01:59:45,948 --> 01:59:50,077
- Vern, will you get away?
- I will. You betcha.

1237
01:59:52,497 --> 01:59:54,738
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- What for?

1238
01:59:55,792 --> 01:59:58,461
For everything.

1239
02:00:01,297 --> 02:00:03,539
Your friends, are they...

1240
02:00:06,427 --> 02:00:08,467
Yeah.

1241
02:00:15,269 --> 02:00:17,309
If...

1242
02:00:20,775 --> 02:00:23,776
What were you gonna do? Just take off?

1243
02:00:23,903 --> 02:00:25,066
Yes.

1244
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:30,825
What'd you expect?

1245
02:00:30,952 --> 02:00:33,075
To see you, for one thing.

1246
02:00:37,667 --> 02:00:40,703
- Did you think I'd be above ground?
- Well, of course.

1247
02:00:40,837 --> 02:00:45,380
- Why "of course"?
- Because I just can't imagine you dead.

1248
02:00:46,426 --> 02:00:49,629
My God, are you gonna make me say it?

1249
02:00:52,932 --> 02:00:54,047
Tom!

1250
02:01:09,157 --> 02:01:11,861
(Vern moaning)

1251
02:01:44,525 --> 02:01:46,981
(buggy approaches)

1252
02:01:59,207 --> 02:02:01,876
You've just about done it, huh?

1253
02:02:03,127 --> 02:02:05,167
Yeah.

1254
02:02:07,548 --> 02:02:10,964
Well, I think I've found
a buyer for the ranch.

1255
02:02:11,093 --> 02:02:16,883
I'm going into Absaroka now
to see about it and find a place for Vern.

1256
02:02:18,601 --> 02:02:20,225
Well...

1257
02:02:21,395 --> 02:02:23,435
I'm glad.

1258
02:02:25,399 --> 02:02:30,441
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
tryin' to get back at somebody.

1259
02:02:31,572 --> 02:02:33,612
Why'd you say that?

1260
02:02:35,284 --> 02:02:37,954
No reason.

1261
02:02:43,709 --> 02:02:46,331
Well, hell, neither do I.

1262
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:57,965
Where do you think you'll be...
in about six months?

1263
02:03:00,017 --> 02:03:04,928
Well, if I was to guess,
I'd say north of the breaks.

1264
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:08,063
There's the Little Rockies up there.

1265
02:03:08,192 --> 02:03:13,435
A lot of little valleys are supposed
to have water year round.

1266
02:03:15,658 --> 02:03:18,612
Sounds like a real good guess.
