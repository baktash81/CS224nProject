1
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,968
- Target four. Wanna take the other truck?
- Roger.

2
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,234
- move by the truck.

3
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,138
Move in right there.

4
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,045
Roger. He's wounded. Hit him.
Start hitting the truck.

5
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,241
Get the truck and him.
Go forward of it and hit him.

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,683
Roger.

7
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,256
Go ahead and store that.

8
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,949
Another guy moving right through.

9
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:34,117
Good. Fire. Hit him.

10
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,050
Get down on the floor.

11
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,278
I said, down. Down.

12
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,118
You. Down. Now.

13
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,423
Let me see your hands.

14
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,958
Let me see your hands.

15
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,401
Get the hands over your head.
Over your head!

16
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,096
Get down.

17
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,141
On your knees.

18
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,939
There. Stay there.

19
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,983
Get your hands up.
Get your hands up.

20
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,517
Get down.

21
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,321
Shit, there's a kid in there.

22
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,454
That's not our problem.

23
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:42,926
None of this is our problem.

24
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,758
Get your hands in the air.

25
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:48,993
Hey.

26
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,174
How's it going, little man?

27
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,875
You all right?

28
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:11,717
I was 27 years old the first time I died.

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,685
I remember there was white everywhere.

30
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:19,356
There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.

31
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,803
- So how old?
- Twenty-seven.

32
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,966
Here he is. Starks, Jack.

33
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,668
Born in Vermont.
Hasn't got a family listed.

34
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:33,245
Naval hospital will take care of it.

35
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,181
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:43,551
- This soldier's alive. This man just blinked.
- Been tagged already.

37
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,420
- Worry about the others.
- No, no, look at this.

38
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:51,760
Oh, shit. Code blue, code blue.
We need a doctor.

39
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,595
Get a doctor over here now.

40
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,939
Sergeant Starks was very lucky.

41
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,575
A little more to the right,
it wouldn't have come out.

42
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,439
He has retrograde amnesia,
acute psychological suppression.

43
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:06,910
We couldn't find any family...

44
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,512
...in the States, sergeant.

45
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,481
- I'm sure you have friends.
- I want the paperwork this afternoon.

46
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,644
- Get him on the next flight out of here.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,589
He's recommended you for
the Bronze Star, sergeant.

48
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,092
- There is help for you, sergeant.
- Of course there is.

49
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,431
Of course there is.

50
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,074
You guys all right?

51
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,308
- Our car won't start.
- That's your mom?

52
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,110
- Yeah.
- What's your mom's name?

53
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,809
Jean.

54
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,783
Hey, Jean.

55
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,258
Can you hear me?

56
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,194
Can you wake up?

57
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,925
I need you to try and stay awake.

58
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:03,700
- Oh, God.
- Your mom taking anything?

59
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:16,747
- What's your name?
- Jackie.

60
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,050
Nice to meet you, Jackie.

61
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,088
Tell you what. Why don't you do this.

62
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,418
Wrap it around yourself...

63
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:29,154
...and you try and keep your mom awake,
and I'll go work on your car.

64
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,321
- All right?
- Okay.

65
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,807
Oh, God.

66
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,781
No. Oh, no...

67
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:03,328
What do you think of all this snow?

68
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,198
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

69
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,502
What are these?

70
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,539
Those are dog tags. See, they got the name
and the date of birth on them.

71
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,647
- What for?
- In case I get lost...

72
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,746
...or can't remember who I am.
- Can I have them?

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,353
- Yeah, you can have them.
- Thanks.

74
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,888
You think you can reach the ignition?

75
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,394
Go ahead and give it a shot.

76
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,358
Just keep turning, all right?

77
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,874
Keep going.

78
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,009
It works.

79
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:04,658
Hey, get your fucking hands off...

80
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:10,092
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.

81
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:15,361
- Mom, he fixed our car.
- Jackie, get in that car. Now.

82
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:18,903
- Mom. He fixed the car.
- Get in the goddamn car!

83
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,779
- How's it going?
- Pretty good, man.

84
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:09,047
- Where you headed?
- On up in Canada.

85
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,384
- I can take you to the border.
- That'd be great.

86
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,323
- All right, bud, jump on in.
- It's freezing.

87
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,828
- Hey, man.
- Hey. Thanks.

88
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,829
Jump on in here. Hey, no problem.

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,968
My God, it's cold.

90
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,128
- Must've been freezing out there, boy.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:30,642
It's colder than a witch's titty with
a brass bra on doing pushups in the snow.

92
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,045
- So you drive?
- Yeah, sure.

93
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,411
All right, man, great.
We'll switch up in a bit.

94
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,013
You ever been to jail?

95
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:48,284
- No, I've never been to jail.
- I'll tell you what, buddy...

96
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,521
...it's a whole lot
goddamn worse than war.

97
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,825
It's probably worse
than anywhere you been.

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,695
I doubt that.

99
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,461
Are you kidding me?

100
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,369
What's he pulling us over for?

101
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,971
Recreation.

102
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:14,587
Jackie and Jean are the only things
you know for certain about that day?

103
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,120
Yes.

104
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,695
Are you aware that we have no last name,
no place of residence...

105
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:29,198
...and no record of any physical
presence for these friends of yours?

106
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:37,506
I'm afraid I might have to actually
hear that answer, Mr. Starks.

107
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,909
Yes.

108
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,081
Officer Harrison
had been shot three times.

109
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,754
He was long dead
by the time we got there.

110
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,891
Jack Starks could be
blocking the incident.

111
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,653
It would explain his well-conceived plan
about the little girl and her mother.

112
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,955
- Objection.
- I have heard of Gulf War syndrome.

113
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:00,897
War is just a CNN special. Half the shit
that went on in Operation Desert Storm...

114
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,094
...can't be tidied into
a top-of-the-hour headline.

115
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:07,766
Couldn't be said neatly,
so couldn't be said at all.

116
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,705
- There was someone else.
- War's ugly.

117
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,870
- And they don't put ugly on TV.
- My client thinks he already died once.

118
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:18,348
- I don't really remember all of it...
- He doesn't know what's going on.

119
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,844
...but there was someone else.

120
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,414
I think that's what happened.

121
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:28,460
If Starks did kill that officer...

122
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,359
...can't hold a man responsible
for a damaged mind.

123
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:36,731
We, the jury, find the defendant
not guilty by reason of insanity.

124
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:41,774
Jack Starks, I hereby sentence you
to be committed...

125
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,604
...to an institution
for the criminally insane...

126
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:48,714
...where I hope the doctors
and proper treatment can help you.

127
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,543
Come on, bud.

128
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,892
Come on.

129
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,065
What are you doing?

130
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,282
Get him up.

131
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,431
Please believe...

132
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,769
What are you doing? I don't belong here.

133
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:07,744
- I don't belong here.
- No, I don't think you do either.

134
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,611
But neither of us
can do anything about that now.

135
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,151
Please. Please.

136
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,922
Let me out of here.

137
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,963
Let me out of here. Please.

138
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,211
- How much did you give him?
- Fifty cc's.

139
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,855
- And he's been in for the full three hours?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,184
Okay, get him out.

141
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,394
Jack, can you hear me?

142
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,831
Jack, blink for me if you can.

143
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:24,743
- He didn't lose consciousness.
- Do you wanna put him back in?

144
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,647
No, take him out of it.

145
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,755
Take him upstairs
and check his vitals every hour.

146
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:57,445
Now that's, I think, the context
in which to view what's going on.

147
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:08,392
Perhaps you may have seen a lead story
in The New York Times.

148
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:19,234
Good morning, Dr. Lorenson.

149
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,243
You're the cop killer, right?

150
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,247
- That obvious, huh?
- TV, you know?

151
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,389
Helps soothe an active mind.

152
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,919
I'm Rudy Mackenzie. Welcome.

153
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,256
Listen, I...

154
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,691
- I don't really feel like talking.
- You know, that's a shame.

155
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,961
I don't believe
in disposable language either.

156
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,799
You know, small talk, little talk,
chitchat. Useless.

157
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:55,601
The game.
The game's something else, though.

158
00:17:55,776 --> 00:18:01,942
This here is our court.
I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.

159
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,448
All right.

160
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,447
What are you in here for?

161
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,624
- I tried to kill my wife.
- Don't you go to jail for that?

162
00:18:15,796 --> 00:18:20,460
Yeah, well, I tried, like, 30 times.
I never planned on doing it, you know?

163
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:23,194
It was always
in the heat of the moment.

164
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,864
And she kept threatening
to have me put away until finally...

165
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,270
...she did.

166
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:35,612
- Thirty times might make you seem crazy.
- Yeah, or just... Or just plain stupid.

167
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:40,344
Because you'd think by the 20th time,
I would've found an alternative method...

168
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,617
...or maybe a more effective one.
- Morning, gentlemen. How you doing today?

169
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,057
For me that is a really
difficult question, Dr. Lorenson...

170
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:53,290
...because the world around me is shrinking,
and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse...

171
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,493
...are coming to see me today,
and they're not bringing flowers...

172
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,969
...which just makes it really difficult
to get organized.

173
00:19:02,943 --> 00:19:04,911
And you, Mr. Starks?

174
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,876
- I'm fine.
- So you're okay?

175
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,914
You tell me, doc.

176
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,152
You think there's
something wrong with me?

177
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,917
You're a little underweight.

178
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,591
Maybe I'm working it off in my dreams.

179
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,194
Done with the small talk?

180
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,267
Hey, it's okay.

181
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,980
Mr. Starks, glad to see
you're cooperating this time.

182
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:55,651
We're here to help, Jack.
We're only doing what's best for you.

183
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:03,299
Hold him while I get the tranquilizer.

184
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,495
- Get him down. Fuck the tranquilizer.
- No.

185
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,365
No, that's not necessary. Get him up.

186
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,913
Nurse, get the jacket.

187
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,914
The only thing
your mind's missing's a conscience.

188
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,187
Wait. Dr. Becker, how long
do you want us to leave him in for?

189
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,755
Just strap him in for now.

190
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,903
Help. Help, please.

191
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,670
Motherfucker.

192
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,477
Let me out of here.

193
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,711
Let me out of here.

194
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,856
Let me out of here.

195
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,585
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

196
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,930
- Listen, I hate to bother you.
- Then don't.

197
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,969
But what about Starks?

198
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,238
What about Starks?

199
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,143
Should we be just...?

200
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:22,008
Should we be trying to help him
any way we can?

201
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,707
- Yes.
- Should we be leaving him in there like that?

202
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:28,377
The medication I've given him
is intended to adjust...

203
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:34,653
...maybe even reset, his violent proclivities.
Peel away some layers of hate.

204
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,456
The apparatus is merely
a safe place for that to happen.

205
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:42,534
The grounds and the halls, where I can't
monitor side effects I can't predict, aren't.

206
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:45,671
But how can you be monitoring
the effects while he's in there?

207
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,605
I consider the time he's spent
in there part of the treatment.

208
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:56,576
You can't break something
that's already broken.

209
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:22,373
I don't belong here.

210
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,439
I can't breathe in here.

211
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,446
I can't breathe in here.

212
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:32,882
I can't...

213
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:40,951
I can't breathe in here.

214
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,958
I'm gonna blow your head off.

215
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:08,203
In case you hadn't figured,
it's Christmas Eve.

216
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:10,713
You're never gonna get a cab here.

217
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,778
Thanks.

218
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,454
You got somewhere
you need to go?

219
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,455
I'm not sure.

220
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,187
Well, let me ask you that again.

221
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:25,354
This time, look around
and consider your options.

222
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,826
Have you got somewhere
you need to go?

223
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,238
Yeah, I do.

224
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,673
Well, great. Get in.

225
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,846
So where can I take you?

226
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,682
I don't know.

227
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:51,346
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

228
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,021
Okay.

229
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:05,428
Well, there must be
another shelter I can call.

230
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:11,933
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
Merry Christmas to you too.

231
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,773
Great.

232
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,438
That was our last option.

233
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,610
What am I gonna do with you?

234
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:23,883
Nothing.

235
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,687
I'll...

236
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:32,326
- Listen, thanks for bringing me this far.
- Where are you going?

237
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,232
You'll freeze out there.
You don't even have a coat.

238
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:39,598
- I'll manage.
- No, you won't.

239
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:44,169
You'll die of cold,
and then I'll have to feel guilty.

240
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:47,336
And I've already got more guilt
than I know what to do with.

241
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,505
You want a drink?

242
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,513
No, I'm okay.

243
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,219
Shit.

244
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:20,773
Hey.

245
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:22,906
You okay?

246
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,385
Yeah. I'm fine.

247
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,563
You know what?

248
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:43,832
It's Christmas Eve and...

249
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:51,043
And I have a couch,
so you can stay on it.

250
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:52,808
I'm gonna go take a bath.

251
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,746
Fix yourself something to eat
if you're hungry or anything.

252
00:26:56,916 --> 00:27:00,249
There's nothing to steal, but don't be
a jerk and take something anyway.

253
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,650
No. I wouldn't.

254
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,517
- My name is Jack.
- No.

255
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,424
Let's not do the name thing,
because it's...

256
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,097
I don't wanna meet you.

257
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:17,327
I may wanna help you tonight,
but I don't wanna know you, really.

258
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,235
Okay.

259
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,443
What's this?

260
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:39,978
Best I could do
with what was in the fridge.

261
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:50,189
Thanks.

262
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,429
No problem.

263
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:03,165
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

264
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,095
It was pretty good, considering.

265
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:41,336
Your fridge has quite an array of things.

266
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:44,573
Not a lot of food, but...

267
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,878
- Freezer has a rock in it.
- What rock?

268
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:51,251
There was a stone in it. It said "petal."

269
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,453
That's snooping.

270
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,797
It was my mom's senseless idea
of a nickname.

271
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,332
It's...

272
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:13,400
So you're a waitress. I mean...

273
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,910
I don't know what I mean.

274
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,011
Okay.

275
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,137
I hate Christmas.

276
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:43,723
Hey.

277
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:45,955
Hey, wake up. Jackie.

278
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,261
- No.
- Who are these people?

279
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:51,926
- What?
- Who are the people in this picture?

280
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,435
That's my mom and me.

281
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,841
- What do you mean, your mom and...?
- No, wait a minute.

282
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,001
- Where's your mother now?
- My mom is dead.

283
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:04,513
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- I mean, she's dead. Dead. Gone.

284
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:08,780
She passed out with a cigarette and
burned to death a long time ago, all right?

285
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,952
No, no, no...

286
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:13,992
Listen, I'm sorry. Listen.

287
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,795
I don't know how...

288
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:21,028
- What's the date today?
- What?

289
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:23,234
I know this sounds crazy.

290
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,165
What year is this?

291
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,301
2007.

292
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:32,038
What? What?

293
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:35,678
Who the hell are you?

294
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,282
I'm Jack Starks.

295
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:43,186
Get the fuck out of my house.

296
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,884
- What'd you do, snoop all over the place?
- No.

297
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:49,858
God, you had no right.
You had no right to go through anything.

298
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,928
Look at me.

299
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:56,034
I know this doesn't make any sense,
because it doesn't make sense to me either.

300
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:59,296
Oh, my God. If you don't get out now,
I'm gonna call the cops.

301
00:33:59,472 --> 00:34:03,568
No, please. Please, wait.
I won't hurt you. Just talk to me, please.

302
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:08,612
l... Your mom was passed out
on the side of the road when I met you.

303
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:11,716
She was wasted.
Jean, her name was Jean.

304
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:16,412
- Just stop it!
- Look, I gave this kid those dog tags.

305
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:20,457
No, no. No, you didn't.

306
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,494
Jack Starks did,
and Jack Starks is dead.

307
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,028
What?

308
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,064
What do you mean, he's...?

309
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:30,827
He's dead.

310
00:34:31,003 --> 00:34:37,033
His body was found New Year's Day, 1993,
Alpine Grove.

311
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,699
He's dead.

312
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:43,374
- It can't be.
- Well, it is.

313
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:49,283
Listen, listen. I don't care who
or where you think you are...

314
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:50,979
...you're not Jack Starks.

315
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:55,719
So whoever you are, I did a nice thing...
I did a really nice thing, and you've really...

316
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:59,763
God, you've really made me regret it,
so please, please, would you...?

317
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,729
Would you just leave? Okay?

318
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,726
Don't you remember me?

319
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:06,030
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me.

320
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:10,767
I'll leave, okay, I'll leave, but look at me.
I'm not lying to you.

321
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:17,314
I met you. I met you and your mother,
and there was no one around for miles.

322
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:22,045
I couldn't have known that from a pair
of dog tags you had lying around.

323
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:27,215
You put those down, and you get out.

324
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:31,792
Don't you remember me?

325
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:36,799
- Don't you know? I'm...
- You get out!

326
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,499
I'm...

327
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:42,607
Okay?

328
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,308
Please.

329
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:54,647
Please get out.

330
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,702
I'm gonna blow your head off!

331
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:24,184
Jackie.

332
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:26,749
Oh, God.

333
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,550
I can't believe you left him in all night.

334
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,491
You didn't say anything when I asked...

335
00:36:35,664 --> 00:36:39,430
I expected some common sense
on your part. Open the drawer.

336
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:50,472
Is he dead?

337
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:56,749
No. Get him upstairs immediately.
He's dehydrated.

338
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,045
I want him on an IV
by the time I get up there.

339
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,586
I tried to tell you
when I came to your office...

340
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:04,088
I expected you to take him out.

341
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:09,219
You're a physician. I shouldn't have
to spell everything out for you.

342
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:20,940
Jack?

343
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,473
Jack?

344
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,552
Tom.

345
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,157
Tom, can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

346
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:44,261
- What have you done with Jack Starks?
- What do you mean?

347
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:47,629
- He's unconscious.
- He's recovering from Loxadol and Ativan.

348
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:50,965
Loxadol? He didn't need neuroleptics.

349
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:54,506
You know that from what, a couple
of two-minute stares across the room?

350
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:57,474
He didn't need antipsychotics,
if that's all you gave him.

351
00:37:57,645 --> 00:38:01,012
After he attacked me,
I figured he'd need a little placating.

352
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:03,173
You sure he wasn't provoked?

353
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:05,842
Are you sure you wanna make
an accusation like that?

354
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:10,990
I'm not making any accusations.
He's bruised up.

355
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,423
Happens sometimes
when you gotta restrain them.

356
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:16,189
Listen to me.
He is not gonna end up like Ted Casey.

357
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:19,333
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but he's not a lab animal.

358
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:22,265
You can't reprogram them,
no matter what cocktail of drugs...

359
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:26,168
You really don't let up, do you?
Just because you failed Ted Casey...

360
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,968
...doesn't mean the rest of us did.

361
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:32,639
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's Christmas, remember?

362
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,323
Hi, how are you? Sorry I'm late.

363
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,830
- Hi, Babak.
- That's a nice wave.

364
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,338
- Hey, Jamile.
- Hey.

365
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,806
Okay, that's great. That was the truck.
Now point to the ball.

366
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,418
Very good.

367
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:19,617
Wanna hold it? Feels nice. Strong.

368
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,597
I need you to stay with me
for just a little while more, okay?

369
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:40,838
We'll get there.

370
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:44,250
Could I have some water?

371
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,682
Could I have some water?
I have some water?

372
00:39:48,857 --> 00:39:50,984
Here you go.

373
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:02,101
What the hell kind of drugs
are you people giving me?

374
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,795
Just something to keep you calm.

375
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:09,035
Did you just say something?

376
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:13,238
I said, the drugs are to keep you calm.

377
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:16,146
Did you sleep well?

378
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:23,048
- I wasn't asleep, was I?
- You were asleep for nearly a whole day.

379
00:40:23,224 --> 00:40:27,285
It's December 26th, Jack.
How are you feeling?

380
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:29,760
- December 26th?
- That's right.

381
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:32,092
- 1992?
- Yes.

382
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:35,100
And that's the sun, and you're on Earth.

383
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,535
And I know you know better, Jack.

384
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:42,975
Who the hell are you?
My mom is dead. 2007.

385
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:45,611
Jack Starks is dead.

386
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:48,141
Get out of here, get out!

387
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:50,682
- You left me in there.
- In where?

388
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:55,255
You left me in that thing. In the drawer.
And then...

389
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:57,254
...you put me in a straitjacket.

390
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:01,023
We were forced to use restraints,
if that's what you're referring to.

391
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:05,757
- It wasn't a fucking restraint.
- That's exactly what our equipment is.

392
00:41:06,935 --> 00:41:08,334
Relax.

393
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:14,166
Don't act like I don't know what's real.

394
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:18,639
You're suffering from delusions
as part of your condition.

395
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:20,337
No, I know what's real, I know.

396
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:24,246
You strapped me into something
and stuffed me in a fucking drawer.

397
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:27,955
It wasn't a dream.

398
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,886
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I wasn't...

399
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,289
I have to say...

400
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:37,761
...this is the most resilient I've seen
a patient undergoing this treatment.

401
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:41,561
I had a patient a few years ago.
His name was Ted Casey.

402
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:46,205
Ted sodomized a 7-year-old girl.

403
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:51,301
His lawyers asked me to have a look at him
because after his deeds were done...

404
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:54,937
...he climbed into the trees
of the forest where he killed her...

405
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:56,515
...and howled like a dog.

406
00:41:56,684 --> 00:42:02,384
Ted never went to prison because everyone,
including me, believed he was sick.

407
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:07,585
So he came here. Then one day a little girl
came with her mother to visit her relative...

408
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,697
...and I caught Ted stealing looks at her.

409
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:15,191
The kind you really have to steal,
if you know what I mean.

410
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:18,098
I asked Ted then...

411
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:24,438
...if he could remember what the little girl
who he'd slain was wearing.

412
00:42:24,612 --> 00:42:28,446
"Oh, yes," he said. "I remember it.

413
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,948
I remember it well."

414
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:35,278
Those were actually his last words.

415
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:40,619
What happened to your face?

416
00:42:41,763 --> 00:42:46,393
I was careless. It won't happen again.

417
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:49,468
I'll say a prayer for you, Jack.

418
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:53,295
Maybe God will pick up
where the medicine leaves off.

419
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:56,568
You sure you know where to find him?

420
00:44:15,189 --> 00:44:16,816
Jack.

421
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:18,822
What are you doing, Jack?

422
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:20,290
What are you gonna do to me?

423
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:23,919
I thought I'd just ask you
to come inside with me.

424
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:29,126
- What if I didn't want to come?
- Well, I'd probably ask you why.

425
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:31,271
Because I'm not crazy.

426
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:35,398
You suffer from a delusional disorder.
It doesn't mean you're crazy.

427
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:37,635
It just means you're confused.

428
00:44:37,812 --> 00:44:40,212
You're here instead of jail because
your condition...

429
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:44,909
...played a role in your crime.
- I didn't kill that cop, but I don't remember.

430
00:44:45,086 --> 00:44:48,852
Your mind's ability to distinguish
between your fantasies...

431
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,888
...and the real events that happened...

432
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:56,655
The real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up, not my mind.

433
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:01,329
Jack.

434
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:05,404
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.

435
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,741
Since when do people around here
start asking for things?

436
00:45:09,744 --> 00:45:13,236
- Okay. Smoke?
- That's what you wanna ask?

437
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,349
No.

438
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:21,911
I wanted...

439
00:45:22,456 --> 00:45:26,552
I wanted to ask you how your treatments
with Dr. Becker are progressing.

440
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:29,954
Fine. Fine.

441
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:33,094
I hope you'd tell me
if that wasn't the case.

442
00:45:33,668 --> 00:45:38,401
Why? Why, what would you do?
What would you do?

443
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,639
I would try to make it stop.

444
00:45:43,778 --> 00:45:47,646
- I'm not sure I want him to stop.
- So it's helping?

445
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:53,743
They're making me feel like
a different person.

446
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,473
You coming?

447
00:46:18,346 --> 00:46:21,975
We're gonna freeze out here, you and I.

448
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:31,254
Could get hurt if they catch you
trying to leave again.

449
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:45,171
What do you know about the shit
they do to us in the basement?

450
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:47,897
What shit?

451
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:50,373
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

452
00:46:51,379 --> 00:46:54,507
Yeah, you do. That jacket.

453
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:03,016
- What jacket?
- The fucking drawer.

454
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,125
Now, stop playing games,
you know what I'm talking about.

455
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:14,429
I know that they take you down there.
I know that they put you in it.

456
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:16,500
The rest of it, it's...

457
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:21,506
It's a trip, you know,
it's like a serious vacation.

458
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:23,604
I found out I'm gonna die.

459
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:27,077
Well, mortality is actually
a great thing to be familiar with.

460
00:47:27,248 --> 00:47:28,647
I'm gonna die in four days.

461
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:33,512
That's what I found out.
They find my body in four days.

462
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:37,583
What are you two yapping about?

463
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:43,759
We're talking about our ability
to go forward in time...

464
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:45,558
...to go into the future.

465
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:51,594
I mean, that's what
we're talking about, right?

466
00:47:56,544 --> 00:47:58,569
Yeah, that's right.

467
00:48:05,553 --> 00:48:09,045
If you need to find something out
when you're in there, just calm down.

468
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:12,750
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

469
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:17,421
Yeah, but all this shit from before
just comes tumbling...

470
00:48:17,598 --> 00:48:20,362
Yeah, but that shit is in the past.

471
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:23,560
Focus on what you need to get now.

472
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:27,368
- I gotta get back in there.
- That could be a problem.

473
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:30,305
- Why?
- Lorenson's got her claws into it now.

474
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:36,883
When she started getting suspicious of me
was when they stopped putting me in there.

475
00:48:37,051 --> 00:48:39,178
Women.

476
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,078
What do you think I should do?

477
00:48:43,057 --> 00:48:45,582
You could still give Becker an itch.

478
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,391
You might get killed
when he goes to scratch it...

479
00:48:48,562 --> 00:48:51,656
...but seems to me, you're saying
that's about to happen anyway...

480
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,898
Oh, man.

481
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,331
Please continue, Mr. Mackenzie.

482
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:03,004
Okay.

483
00:49:07,915 --> 00:49:12,249
Well, I've been approached
by the Federal Trade Organization.

484
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:17,589
And what have they approached you about,
Mr. Mackenzie?

485
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:21,117
And this is nuts, but...

486
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:25,425
...they have asked me to head up...

487
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,534
...the Organization for the Organized.

488
00:49:30,938 --> 00:49:35,068
- The Organization for the Organized?
- Yeah, you've heard of them?

489
00:49:35,242 --> 00:49:37,608
No, Mr. Mackenzie, I have not.

490
00:49:37,778 --> 00:49:41,145
That's because there is
no such organization, you idiot.

491
00:49:41,515 --> 00:49:44,109
That is categorically not true.

492
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,583
That is blatantly and manifestly not true.

493
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:49,689
They have asked me to lead them.

494
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:53,349
And if you'd heard of them, then they
wouldn't be hush-hush, would they?

495
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:56,354
What do the rest of you think?

496
00:50:04,705 --> 00:50:06,696
Well...

497
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:11,075
...I know they exist.
- And how is that?

498
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:16,343
When I was in the Gulf,
the Organization...

499
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:18,576
...was recruiting the Organized.

500
00:50:18,752 --> 00:50:21,653
- Is that a fact, Mr. Starks?
- It is a fact.

501
00:50:21,822 --> 00:50:25,087
Because if it's not,
it doesn't help Mr. Mackenzie.

502
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:28,251
It is a fact. Bona fide and classified.

503
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:31,658
I knew it. I knew it.

504
00:50:31,832 --> 00:50:35,097
You know, those little fuckers
are everywhere.

505
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:37,533
They only recruit the best, Mackenzie.

506
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:41,240
- Calm down, Mr. Starks.
- Stay calm, see, stay calm.

507
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:44,536
Always ordering us to stay calm, be calm.

508
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:48,375
Be calm. Be calm.
They order you to order me to be calm.

509
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,915
How are we supposed
to be calm? Look at this place.

510
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:54,384
So, people, wake up, okay?
Orders come from the top only.

511
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,285
Don't let them order you around.
Long live the Organization.

512
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:59,926
Long live the Organization
for the Organized.

513
00:51:00,094 --> 00:51:02,756
- Sit down, Mr. Starks.
- No, no, no, you've gotta listen...

514
00:51:03,197 --> 00:51:06,132
Long live the Organization
for the Organized.

515
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,894
Join the Organization.
The Organization needs you.

516
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:10,934
- Fight the good fight.
- You listen to him.

517
00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:12,697
- You don't listen to me?
- Sit down.

518
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:14,773
You gotta listen to him.

519
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:17,308
- Long live the Organization.
- Sit down.

520
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:19,207
Join the Organization.

521
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,779
You gotta listen to him.

522
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:39,565
Oh, Starks...

523
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:42,668
...you are real stubborn.

524
00:51:42,836 --> 00:51:44,428
But there's ways of fixing that.

525
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:51,209
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

526
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:53,571
Stay calm.

527
00:51:57,918 --> 00:51:59,783
Criminally insane.

528
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:03,214
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car...

529
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:07,019
...with your hands in the air, please.
- What seems to be the problem, officer?

530
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:11,588
Problem is you're moving too slow. Step out
of the car with your hands in the air.

531
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,161
Can I open the door here?

532
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,315
Hey, soldier boy, you awake?

533
00:52:37,057 --> 00:52:38,752
Didn't think so.

534
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,561
Yeah.

535
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,476
It's okay. You're okay.

536
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,499
Hey, Jack, grab the ball.

537
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,542
Show Mom, honey.

538
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:18,658
Will you give me one sec?

539
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:33,367
You got nerve showing up like this.

540
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,770
You mind?

541
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,446
Okay, here goes.

542
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:52,851
Jack Starks died from a wound
to the head, January 1 st, 1993.

543
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,955
How? I mean, how do I die?

544
00:54:57,097 --> 00:54:58,962
It didn't say.

545
00:55:00,334 --> 00:55:01,892
Does that mean you believe me?

546
00:55:02,836 --> 00:55:05,100
I don't know what I believe.

547
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:09,904
- What else you find out?
- Whole bunch of stuff.

548
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:12,170
There was a doctor. Becker.

549
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:15,577
He was using some kind of behavior
modification on his patients...

550
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:17,182
...that was banned in the '70s.

551
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:19,979
And there was another doctor too,
a Dr. Lorenson.

552
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:24,386
And something about a kid
she was treating. Babak.

553
00:55:24,558 --> 00:55:26,287
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't know...

554
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,486
...but the whole thing
was a major scandal.

555
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:33,895
Becker claimed he was trying to create
a womb-like environment for his patients.

556
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:36,035
Fucking womb.

557
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:42,268
It wasn't a fucking womb.

558
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:46,571
Look, I have to find out how I die.

559
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,749
Well, Alpine Grove still exists.

560
00:55:51,718 --> 00:55:55,654
We could go see if there's anyone around
who might know what really happened.

561
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,121
We could.

562
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:21,511
Thanks for doing this.

563
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:25,952
Well, I must be the crazy one, right?

564
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:39,689
I'm sorry I can't tell you more
about your uncle's death.

565
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:41,767
They used the hospital medical examiner...

566
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:45,393
- "Blunt trauma" doesn't tell me anything.
- I'm sorry, that's all it says.

567
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:49,406
I mean, weren't there doctors?
What about Dr. Becker or Dr. Lorenson...?

568
00:56:49,977 --> 00:56:54,277
Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital.
She was here the same time as your uncle.

569
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:56,848
I'm sure she could be
of more help to you.

570
00:56:57,017 --> 00:57:01,647
- And what about Becker and Hopkins?
- Dr. Hopkins died.

571
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:04,382
And I'm not familiar with a Dr. Becker.

572
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:08,255
Well, can you see if there'd be any kind
of forwarding address for Dr. Becker?

573
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,919
Is there some particular reason
for these questions?

574
00:57:13,233 --> 00:57:15,599
He's the only family I remember.

575
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:26,941
What does this guy keep smiling about?

576
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,479
Hi. Beth Lorenson.

577
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,143
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

578
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,116
- Hi. Beth Lorenson.
- Jackie Price.

579
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,188
Sit down, sit down.

580
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:45,431
I'm sorry. You look exactly like him.

581
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:49,196
Did you know him well?

582
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:51,462
Your uncle was my most
memorable patient.

583
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,230
- Why is that?
- In the end...

584
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,433
...he made me change my mind
about a lot of things.

585
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:00,671
- He actually helped me with a case of mine.
- Really? What case?

586
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:05,374
- I was working with a little boy.
- Babak Yazdi?

587
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,850
- Yes.
- Who was he?

588
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:10,148
A friend's son.
How do you know about him?

589
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:14,055
We saw it when we were looking up
information about his uncle.

590
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:18,558
How did he help?

591
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:26,005
Well, it's complicated, but in the end
he let me know how...

592
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:29,540
...I could get through to him.
- How?

593
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:33,741
It's complicated.

594
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:38,242
And it was a really long time ago.

595
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:44,013
Let me ask you something.
Do you know how my uncle died?

596
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:50,223
Yeah, I think it was from...

597
00:58:50,397 --> 00:58:51,887
...a head trauma.

598
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:55,193
Yes, but how? How did he get it?

599
00:58:56,403 --> 00:58:58,428
I don't know.

600
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,538
You don't?

601
00:59:10,183 --> 00:59:13,914
Think Dr. Becker might have
a better idea?

602
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,229
Yes, Dr. Becker would know more.

603
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,730
- I don't believe a word she just said.
- Me neither.

604
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,463
Come on. There's one last thing.

605
00:59:30,637 --> 00:59:36,166
- to remind you of the staff softball game
at 4 p.m., so don't be late.

606
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,349
Jack, what is this?

607
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,559
This is the room.

608
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:05,229
They used to hang it over there.

609
01:00:10,343 --> 01:00:13,608
I'm actually in this drawer right now.

610
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:35,833
You know what?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

611
01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:38,527
You folks ain't supposed
to be down here.

612
01:00:38,705 --> 01:00:40,036
We were just leaving.

613
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:47,046
Do I know you from somewhere?

614
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:50,649
I don't know, do you?

615
01:00:51,518 --> 01:00:55,784
I don't know, you probably
know my uncle, Jack Starks?

616
01:00:57,224 --> 01:00:59,988
Goddamn, that's right.

617
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:03,462
- You're his spitting image.
- Yeah, I know.

618
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,656
- You could be his ghost.
- Could be.

619
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,326
- You remember him?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

620
01:01:10,904 --> 01:01:12,394
He was a great guy.

621
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:17,772
You wouldn't happen to know
how he died, now, would you?

622
01:01:18,745 --> 01:01:21,908
I just remember them finding his body.

623
01:01:24,117 --> 01:01:26,642
Is that all you remember, Damon?

624
01:01:30,924 --> 01:01:32,915
How do you know my name?

625
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,153
- I know all about you, Damon.
- Oh, yeah?

626
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:37,557
Oh, yeah.

627
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:41,493
- I know you're a piece of shit.
- I don't like you getting in my face...

628
01:01:41,668 --> 01:01:43,829
- Was it you?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

629
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:47,804
- He was hit in the head. Sounds like you.
- I never touched him, man, I swear.

630
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,209
What's going on?

631
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:56,182
- See you, pal.
- This is a restricted area.

632
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:59,546
Damon. Damon, Damon, they're gone.

633
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,186
It's time for your medication.

634
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:07,591
I'll see if I can track Becker down.

635
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:10,690
How long do we have?

636
01:02:12,265 --> 01:02:14,165
I don't know.

637
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,602
I don't think we have
that much time. Come on.

638
01:02:20,807 --> 01:02:22,502
Well...

639
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,540
...then you get yourself to me tomorrow.

640
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:32,978
You don't...

641
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:36,017
...and I'll take it personally.

642
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:41,092
Oh, yeah?

643
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:11,390
Do you want a drink?

644
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:44,389
I'm running out of time.

645
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:48,924
I don't care. You have to come back.

646
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:52,923
I didn't ask for you, but now...

647
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,497
...you just have to come back.

648
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:59,503
It's not like that.
I don't have control over it.

649
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:01,265
Well...

650
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:03,733
...get control.

651
01:04:40,246 --> 01:04:42,009
Come back to me, Jack.

652
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:30,625
I can't help you unless you let me.

653
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:37,460
- That thing is my only chance in this place.
- What thing?

654
01:05:37,637 --> 01:05:39,662
You don't understand.

655
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,740
Well, try and help me understand.

656
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,412
I've...

657
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:59,186
I've seen a time that's not this time.

658
01:06:01,027 --> 01:06:04,087
And I'm only able to see it
when I'm in there.

659
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:10,461
What time is that?

660
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:15,436
2007.

661
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:21,571
What year do you think it is now?

662
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:26,685
- I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992.
- Okay.

663
01:06:26,853 --> 01:06:29,549
So tell me about 2007.
What does it look like?

664
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:35,555
- Doesn't look that different.
- The future doesn't look different?

665
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:39,228
No.

666
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:41,094
Not to people like me.

667
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:42,928
You think you're traveling in time?

668
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:44,331
- Is that it?
- Listen.

669
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:47,371
- Not everyone in this place is crazy.
- Like who?

670
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:50,298
Like Mackenzie, maybe?

671
01:06:51,578 --> 01:06:54,012
Did he tell you
he tried to kill his wife?

672
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:57,542
Mackenzie locked himself up
in his house for two months...

673
01:06:57,717 --> 01:07:00,413
...and nearly starved himself
before he was brought here.

674
01:07:00,587 --> 01:07:03,954
All because his wife left him
for another man.

675
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:08,350
I don't care. Look, I don't have time
for this. I gotta get out of here.

676
01:07:08,528 --> 01:07:10,519
These are all facets of your delusions.

677
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:15,891
Oh, yeah?

678
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:23,241
What about Babak? Is that a facet?

679
01:07:26,112 --> 01:07:27,602
How do you know about him?

680
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:30,114
You told me.

681
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:34,816
I saw you.

682
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:39,052
You thought I knew something about him,
so you told me.

683
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:41,521
How do you know about him, Jack?

684
01:07:41,828 --> 01:07:45,457
Because you told me. You told me.

685
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:54,170
I know somewhere inside of you...

686
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:57,104
...you have to believe
that what I'm saying is true.

687
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:00,607
You have to.

688
01:08:06,653 --> 01:08:08,883
I don't know how you know
about Babak...

689
01:08:11,424 --> 01:08:14,188
...but these ideas are
part of your delusions.

690
01:08:15,728 --> 01:08:17,127
No.

691
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:22,566
No.

692
01:08:32,612 --> 01:08:34,102
Hey.

693
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:36,446
I brought you some smokes.

694
01:08:40,587 --> 01:08:43,852
Lorenson said that your wife...

695
01:08:44,023 --> 01:08:47,390
...left you for another man,
so you lost it.

696
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:53,330
How's that for a thank-you?

697
01:08:56,769 --> 01:08:58,327
Well?

698
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:01,035
I didn't want to see it. You know?

699
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:03,671
I'm in here because...

700
01:09:03,843 --> 01:09:07,779
...they say I have a nervous condition.

701
01:09:08,748 --> 01:09:10,978
Well, well, here's my question:

702
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:15,516
Who wouldn't be nervous if they
really, really looked at their lives?

703
01:09:15,688 --> 01:09:18,714
I mean, whose life is that good?

704
01:09:24,964 --> 01:09:27,023
Rise and shine, Harold.

705
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,692
Jamile? Have you told anybody about
my sessions with Babak?

706
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,168
- Of course not.
- Has anyone been asking about him?

707
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:35,899
No. I would have told you.

708
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:43,779
Well, hello there.
How you doing today?

709
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:46,983
You ready to work?

710
01:09:51,724 --> 01:09:53,316
Okay.

711
01:10:15,782 --> 01:10:17,249
Jackie.

712
01:10:18,217 --> 01:10:19,912
Jackie.

713
01:10:37,403 --> 01:10:38,870
Hey.

714
01:10:39,272 --> 01:10:42,935
- Okay, this is really freaking me out.
- Tell me about it.

715
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:49,812
- Oh, God. You want this?
- I want this.

716
01:10:51,517 --> 01:10:54,042
- Hey.
- Hey.

717
01:10:54,954 --> 01:10:57,149
God, I should get the heat going.

718
01:10:59,225 --> 01:11:01,455
- Oh, I found out about the little boy.
- Yeah?

719
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:05,495
Babak? Lorenson used a mild form
of electroshock therapy...

720
01:11:05,665 --> 01:11:07,633
...which disrupted his seizures.

721
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,325
She didn't even know that's what
he was having before.

722
01:11:10,503 --> 01:11:12,733
That's what you have to tell her about.

723
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:16,739
I think Becker's house is around here
somewhere. I marked it on the map.

724
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:19,241
- I think this is it.
- You sure?

725
01:11:19,412 --> 01:11:23,644
Yeah. I called the number yesterday
to make sure.

726
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:29,015
All right, let's go.

727
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:44,196
Hi there.

728
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,928
You looking for Dr. Becker?

729
01:12:17,003 --> 01:12:18,732
There he is.

730
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:46,095
How's that work, huh?
God doesn't remember?

731
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:47,857
Is that it?

732
01:12:50,002 --> 01:12:53,904
- Can I help you?
- I don't know, can you?

733
01:12:56,175 --> 01:12:59,838
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

734
01:13:01,013 --> 01:13:04,414
- You're his son?
- Nope.

735
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,612
Not his son.

736
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:12,453
What's the matter, doc?

737
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:14,991
You look like you've seen a ghost.

738
01:13:16,662 --> 01:13:19,392
But how can you be...?

739
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:24,594
- He died years ago in the hospital.
- Yeah, you killed him. Didn't you?

740
01:13:25,338 --> 01:13:29,434
No, I didn't kill him. The treatment
might've pushed him to kill himself...

741
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:32,373
No, I didn't kill myself.
I died from a blow to the head.

742
01:13:34,747 --> 01:13:36,647
How did that happen?

743
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:43,550
All I can remember from the last time
we put him in there...

744
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:48,993
...he... You came out and
said their names to me.

745
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:50,753
What names?

746
01:13:51,297 --> 01:13:52,889
People I tried to help.

747
01:13:56,068 --> 01:13:57,695
Who were they?

748
01:13:59,071 --> 01:14:00,368
Nathan Piechowski...

749
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,839
...Jackson MacGregor...

750
01:14:04,477 --> 01:14:05,808
...Ted Casey.

751
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,178
I didn't ask for them, any of you.

752
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:15,049
- You were criminals sent to me.
- We were patients.

753
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:17,519
We were patients.

754
01:14:17,924 --> 01:14:18,948
You were criminals...

755
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:24,153
Hold on a second. So you said I came out
of that thing, and I told you those names?

756
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:27,832
Well, who do you think
told me about them?

757
01:14:30,436 --> 01:14:32,097
You did.

758
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:37,704
I'm in that drawer right now.

759
01:14:39,645 --> 01:14:41,670
I don't understand.

760
01:14:42,114 --> 01:14:44,514
You're haunting yourself, old man.

761
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,378
- I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
- No.

762
01:14:47,553 --> 01:14:50,454
You pumped me full of drugs...

763
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:52,887
...and you stuffed me
in a morgue drawer.

764
01:14:53,059 --> 01:14:55,493
With every intention of helping you.

765
01:14:58,097 --> 01:15:00,327
And that justifies it?

766
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:13,408
We're all dead, Jack.

767
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:25,381
What is it?

768
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,854
- I have to sit down.
- Is everything okay?

769
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:32,361
- I have to sit down.
- Jack, what is it? Jack?

770
01:15:33,766 --> 01:15:35,859
He's taking me out of there.

771
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,408
- He said it was the last time.
- What?

772
01:15:43,576 --> 01:15:48,013
- Jackie, he said it was the last time. Go.
- Oh, my God.

773
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:50,045
- What was your address?
- What?

774
01:15:50,216 --> 01:15:52,741
When you were a kid, when we met...

775
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:54,909
...what was your address?

776
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:57,817
2140 Waldemere Way.

777
01:16:03,796 --> 01:16:07,596
2140... 2140...

778
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:20,638
- Jackie.
- Jack. Jack, stay with me.

779
01:16:20,813 --> 01:16:23,941
It's the last time. The last time.

780
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:33,119
Jack.

781
01:16:45,471 --> 01:16:47,462
I saw you.

782
01:16:48,107 --> 01:16:52,544
I know what you did to your patients.

783
01:16:52,778 --> 01:16:54,575
Years from now, I saw you.

784
01:16:55,014 --> 01:16:57,209
You told me about Piechowski...

785
01:16:57,383 --> 01:17:00,181
...and Jackson MacGregor...

786
01:17:00,352 --> 01:17:03,947
...and Ted Casey. You told me.

787
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,652
All those guys stay with you.

788
01:17:09,829 --> 01:17:12,855
All of us. We all stay with you.

789
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:16,527
We haunt you, haunt you.

790
01:17:21,073 --> 01:17:23,166
All of us.

791
01:17:25,044 --> 01:17:27,808
We haunt you.

792
01:17:36,756 --> 01:17:38,280
We haunt you.

793
01:18:20,432 --> 01:18:23,560
Could l...? Could I have some paper?

794
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:27,001
Paper and a pen.
Need to write something.

795
01:18:28,374 --> 01:18:31,036
Listen, your patient, Babak...

796
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:33,201
...is having seizures.

797
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:35,540
That's why he hasn't learned
to speak properly.

798
01:18:35,714 --> 01:18:36,942
Who told you this?

799
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:41,576
Just telling you something you already
know. You just haven't figured it out yet.

800
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:45,820
He's not slow, he's having seizures.

801
01:18:46,525 --> 01:18:49,085
Electro...

802
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:52,355
Electroconvulsion therapy.

803
01:18:52,531 --> 01:18:54,590
You used it on him.

804
01:18:55,668 --> 01:18:57,135
That's how you reset him.

805
01:18:57,303 --> 01:19:00,636
No one would ever use ECT on a child.

806
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,974
I don't know that he is having seizures.
If he is, that could send him into status.

807
01:19:05,144 --> 01:19:07,635
It's a permanent state of seizure.

808
01:19:17,022 --> 01:19:18,250
No, no.

809
01:19:18,424 --> 01:19:22,417
Babak is my friend's son.
I would never risk that.

810
01:19:24,897 --> 01:19:26,728
You will.

811
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:33,670
Can you just grab the end of that for me?

812
01:19:36,408 --> 01:19:39,172
I've... I've given him a sedative.

813
01:19:43,449 --> 01:19:44,848
Okay.

814
01:19:56,295 --> 01:19:58,490
I'm only gonna do it once.

815
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:12,339
The settings are very, very low.

816
01:20:13,212 --> 01:20:15,680
- Are you gonna stay in the room?
- Yeah.

817
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:20,248
Okay, great. If you could just
apply some pressure.

818
01:20:21,387 --> 01:20:22,911
Good.

819
01:20:23,923 --> 01:20:25,618
I'm just gonna press this button.

820
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,952
I'm just gonna set it a little bit lower.

821
01:20:28,127 --> 01:20:32,791
Okay, now I'm at the lowest possible.

822
01:20:39,204 --> 01:20:40,671
Okay.

823
01:21:00,059 --> 01:21:01,321
Here we go.

824
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:15,663
Okay. We're done, that's it.

825
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:18,207
We're done. Okay, it's over.

826
01:21:18,811 --> 01:21:21,006
All right. He's all right. He's all right.

827
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,842
Okay. Okay.

828
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:27,112
Babak?

829
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:32,947
Babak...

830
01:21:34,727 --> 01:21:36,388
...how are you doing?

831
01:21:36,862 --> 01:21:38,193
Can you say hi, Babak?

832
01:21:40,332 --> 01:21:42,095
Hi, Babak.

833
01:21:51,043 --> 01:21:53,511
You're okay, you're okay.

834
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,601
What do you need me to do?

835
01:22:27,146 --> 01:22:29,205
I need to take this to someone.

836
01:22:29,381 --> 01:22:32,111
This is a secure unit.
There's no way I can do that.

837
01:22:32,284 --> 01:22:35,151
You have to. Please.

838
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,551
- How long do you need?
- Just a couple hours.

839
01:22:38,891 --> 01:22:40,950
I'm gonna die tonight.

840
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,651
It's been decided.

841
01:22:51,503 --> 01:22:53,528
You want me to come in with you?

842
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,934
I'll be okay.

843
01:23:29,842 --> 01:23:31,275
Hey.

844
01:23:33,278 --> 01:23:34,540
Hey.

845
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,948
I remember you.

846
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:39,408
I remember you too.

847
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:43,487
- Come in, it's cold out there.
- Yeah.

848
01:23:55,767 --> 01:23:59,032
God. How've you been, Jackie?

849
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:03,271
- Okay.
- Yeah? How's your mom?

850
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:08,102
Well, okay.

851
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,146
Do you think I could talk to her?

852
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:15,379
Hey, Mom. Mom?

853
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:24,151
- Hey, Jean.
- Hey.

854
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:29,995
Do I know you?

855
01:24:30,169 --> 01:24:32,797
Mom, this is the guy that fixed the car.

856
01:24:33,739 --> 01:24:35,263
The guy you yelled at.

857
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:37,072
Okay.

858
01:24:42,247 --> 01:24:43,714
There something you need?

859
01:24:44,816 --> 01:24:46,613
It's something you need.

860
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:55,726
Jackie, go play in the snow.

861
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:58,053
- Why?
- Just do it.

862
01:25:07,472 --> 01:25:08,905
Okay.

863
01:25:14,012 --> 01:25:16,105
I don't know how to make this
not sound crazy.

864
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:22,043
I know it's not gonna make
a lot of sense right now...

865
01:25:23,455 --> 01:25:25,252
...but...

866
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:32,991
Look. Everything that I want
to tell you is in this letter.

867
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:36,133
And it's really...

868
01:25:36,301 --> 01:25:39,828
It's very important
that you believe it, because...

869
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:45,942
Because it just would be a shame
if you didn't, you know?

870
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,948
Okay, I'll read it.

871
01:25:58,690 --> 01:25:59,918
That it?

872
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:02,423
Yeah, that's it.

873
01:26:17,009 --> 01:26:18,442
Hey.

874
01:26:20,445 --> 01:26:22,379
Petal...

875
01:26:22,547 --> 01:26:23,980
...it's nice.

876
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:26,480
Don't stop calling her that.

877
01:26:27,953 --> 01:26:30,046
I think she likes it.

878
01:26:44,336 --> 01:26:45,701
Hey.

879
01:26:52,911 --> 01:26:54,572
Hey, wait.

880
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:05,319
You be good, all right, Jackie?

881
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:09,756
- Okay.
- Okay.

882
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:21,089
Jack? Jack?

883
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,427
You okay?

884
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:25,696
Stay with me.

885
01:28:27,773 --> 01:28:29,536
Put me in the jacket.

886
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,073
What do you mean?

887
01:28:31,243 --> 01:28:36,146
You have to put me in the jacket,
it's the only way. I gotta get in there.

888
01:28:43,088 --> 01:28:45,522
Jack? Jack, come on.

889
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:48,022
I need you to help me get you inside.

890
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,418
Okay.

891
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:52,362
You ready?

892
01:28:53,732 --> 01:28:56,530
- All right, you got it?
- I got it.

893
01:29:11,049 --> 01:29:13,176
- That was it.
- Justin!

894
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:15,182
Put me in the jacket.

895
01:29:15,754 --> 01:29:18,348
- What happened?
- He slipped. He slipped on the ice.

896
01:29:18,523 --> 01:29:21,083
- Let's get him up. Watch his head.
- the jacket.

897
01:29:21,426 --> 01:29:23,257
What are you talking about?

898
01:29:24,196 --> 01:29:26,892
He said we have to get him
into the jacket.

899
01:29:27,332 --> 01:29:29,596
I know the procedure,
but we can't do this to him.

900
01:29:29,768 --> 01:29:31,326
Do whatever you did with Becker.

901
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:34,700
I was 27 years old the first time I died.

902
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:38,733
I remember there was white everywhere.

903
01:29:39,244 --> 01:29:42,236
There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.

904
01:29:46,718 --> 01:29:48,709
Sometimes I think
we live through things...

905
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:52,254
...only to be able to say that it happened.

906
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:55,689
That it wasn't to someone else,
it was to me.

907
01:29:57,195 --> 01:30:00,631
Sometimes we live to beat the odds.

908
01:30:04,069 --> 01:30:05,764
I'm not crazy...

909
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:08,365
...even though they thought I was.

910
01:30:09,541 --> 01:30:11,509
I live in the same world as everyone else.

911
01:30:11,676 --> 01:30:15,476
I just saw more of it,
as I'm sure you have.

912
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,608
They'll find my body tomorrow.

913
01:30:21,419 --> 01:30:24,081
You can check it out
if you don't believe me.

914
01:30:26,091 --> 01:30:28,616
I've seen life after my death...

915
01:30:30,929 --> 01:30:33,898
...and I'm telling you this
because it's the only way...

916
01:30:34,065 --> 01:30:37,557
...to help you and your daughter
have a better life of your own.

917
01:30:48,413 --> 01:30:50,074
Jean...

918
01:30:50,515 --> 01:30:53,973
...you're gonna pass out one day
smoking a cigarette...

919
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:56,017
...and burn to death.

920
01:30:57,355 --> 01:31:01,815
Your daughter grows up living
the same sad life you're living right now.

921
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:05,824
And she misses you so much.

922
01:31:22,347 --> 01:31:27,182
Sometimes life can only really begin
with the knowledge of death.

923
01:31:28,486 --> 01:31:32,445
That it can all end,
even when you least want it to.

924
01:31:44,636 --> 01:31:47,833
The important thing in life is to believe...

925
01:31:48,006 --> 01:31:50,167
...that while you're alive,
it's never too late.

926
01:31:51,142 --> 01:31:53,542
I promise you, Jean,
no matter how bad things look...

927
01:31:53,712 --> 01:31:56,681
...they look better awake
than they do asleep.

928
01:31:57,515 --> 01:32:00,678
When you die, there's only one thing
you want to happen.

929
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:03,378
You wanna come back.

930
01:32:03,555 --> 01:32:06,956
Mommy, Daddy, is it time to get up?

931
01:32:07,192 --> 01:32:10,184
He can't find four of us here.
Come on, go in the kitchen.

932
01:32:14,332 --> 01:32:16,357
Oh, boy.

933
01:33:50,061 --> 01:33:52,359
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm fine.

934
01:33:53,031 --> 01:33:54,794
You have a nasty cut there.

935
01:33:55,033 --> 01:33:56,762
Yeah, yeah.

936
01:33:57,135 --> 01:33:59,603
I slipped, but I'm alive.

937
01:34:04,309 --> 01:34:07,301
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Could I give you a ride?

938
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:10,577
Yeah, I'd love that.

939
01:34:12,383 --> 01:34:15,614
Okay. Get in.

940
01:34:16,254 --> 01:34:19,087
All right. Thanks.

941
01:34:53,992 --> 01:34:56,187
I'm sorry, one sec.

942
01:34:58,263 --> 01:34:59,730
Hey.

943
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:04,095
That's sweet. Have a good time, okay?

944
01:35:04,769 --> 01:35:08,170
Yeah, yeah. Listen, Mom,
now's not actually a great time to talk.

945
01:35:08,339 --> 01:35:12,241
I'm on my way to work.
Yeah, I'll call you later.

946
01:35:13,678 --> 01:35:16,169
All right. Happy New Year.

947
01:35:19,751 --> 01:35:22,914
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

948
01:35:23,822 --> 01:35:25,813
No problem there.

949
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,584
How you doing?

950
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,757
Better now.

951
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:44,870
How much time do we have?

952
01:43:01,312 --> 01:43:03,303
