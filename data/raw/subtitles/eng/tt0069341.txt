"Use it wisely."

00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:51,059

00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,865
- "deplore."

<i>- We could pay all our debts.</i>

Your dog seems to be getting hungry,
Major Rogers.

689
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:08,915
Feed him, please.
Please, feed him.

690
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,117
All in good time.

691
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:15,492
Yes, but you must feed him.
He- He'll be dangerous. He'll go wild, berserk!

692
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,861
I know, Major Rogers, sir.

please. Please!

I haven't had anything to eat or drink
for over two days. Please, please!

699

Well, at least feed my dog, please!
