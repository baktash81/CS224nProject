1
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,365
"And the Raven,
never flitting, still is sitting,

2
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,828
still is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas
just above my chamber door.

3
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:20,458
And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming.

4
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:24,462
And the lamplight o'er him streaming
throws his shadow on the floor.

5
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:29,633
And my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor

6
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,178
shall be lifted never more."

7
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:40,895
Pretty good, huh? OK. I want you to
read the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow".

8
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:42,104
You're gonna like it.

9
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,524
It's about a schoolteacher who
gets chased by a headless demon.

10
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,659
Hi.

11
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:01,624
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing in the hallway?

12
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,126
- They get fired.
- Thank God it's Friday!

13
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:07,588
You sound like one of my students.
Why don't you carry my books?

14
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:12,051
I hope you haven't made
any plans for this afternoon.

15
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:13,219
Ooh! Where are we going?

16
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,595
It's a surprise.

17
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,049
You OK?

18
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,138
What's wrong?

19
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:01,016
I don't know.
Didn't use to bother me.

20
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,227
Enjoy the ride folks?

21
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,866
That's it, take it away.

22
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,029
- Do you want to come in?
- Better not.

23
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,743
- Are you alright?
- I'm OK.

24
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,668
I had a wonderful time.

25
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:21,847
Are you sure you don't want to come
in? You could spend the night here.

26
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,061
Better not.

27
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,357
Some things
are worth waiting for.

28
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,446
My books!

29
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,704
Johnny, wait!

30
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,298
I'm so crazy about you.

31
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,926
I'm going to marry you, you know?

32
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,053
You'd better.

33
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,609
- Drive carefully.
- I will.

34
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,933
Where's intensive care?

35
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:42,715
Johnny.
Johnny don't leave me please.

36
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,804
Johnny you're going to get better.
I know you are.

37
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,685
Can you hear me?

38
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:00,441
We're gonna get married,
Johnny don't leave me.

39
00:10:55,413 --> 00:11:02,503
Hello John. My name's Weizak.
I'm Dr Sam Weizak.

40
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:09,092
I'm the director of this clinic.
You've been our guest here for a while.

41
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:16,975
Guest? Funny way of putting it.

42
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,187
How do you feel?

43
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,234
My throat hurts.

44
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,157
Try a bit of water. Come.

45
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:41,041
Hey, slow down.
Not so fast, slow down.

46
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:55,722
You've been involved in a terrible
traffic accident. Do you remember?

47
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,686
Am I OK?

48
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,734
Well... You've been
smashed up pretty badly.

49
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,533
What is it?

50
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,274
No bandages.

51
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:33,788
How come?

52
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:39,641
Your parents are here.
They're right next door.

53
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:43,645
I'm going to bring them in now.
Is that OK?

54
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,189
Sure.

55
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,864
Do come in.

56
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,288
- Hi, Mom. Dad.
- John.

57
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:08,962
Johnny, Johnny...

58
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,051
It's a miracle, John.

59
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,931
I know.

60
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:21,060
I was lucky. Look.

61
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,105
Not a scratch.

62
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:30,233
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.

63
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,195
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs Smith, please.

64
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,491
What's she talking about?

65
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:44,539
You've been in a coma,
Johnny, not a trance.

66
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:49,878
Coma? For how long?

67
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:52,881
We're just glad to have you back, son.
That's all that matters.

68
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:57,427
How long? Dad, how long?

69
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:07,104
Five years.
Five long years John.

70
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:14,653
Lost for five years.
Now reborn unto me.

71
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,117
Five... years?

72
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:23,954
What about Sarah?

73
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:33,171
Just put her from your thoughts John.
She's turned her back on you.

74
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,551
She cleaves now onto another man,
her husband.

75
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:42,639
Husband!

76
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,259
Amy!

77
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:13,355
Amy! Amy!

78
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,774
Amy is my daughter's name.

79
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,319
Your daughter's screaming.
The house is burning.

80
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,655
Your daughter's in the house.

81
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:27,661
It's not too late. Amy. Amy!

82
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:46,555
Your daughter's screaming!
Amy's screaming. It's not too late.

83
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,266
Your daughter's screaming. Hurry up!

84
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,457
The first order of business is
getting your body back into shape.

85
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:18,378
Although you've been
exercised regularly, the, uh--

86
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,590
ligaments have shortened
a little during the coma.

87
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,800
Am I going to have
to live in a wheelchair?

88
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:28,597
Not permanently. And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.

89
00:17:29,932 --> 00:17:33,518
I, uh--
I won't deceive you John.

90
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:39,941
Your therapy will be long
and painful. But you will walk.

91
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,447
Thank you.

92
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,135
The wolf is loose.

93
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:10,263
John, John. Are you alright?

94
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,395
No match for them.

95
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:28,657
Horses, fire.

96
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,696
The boy is safe.

97
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,583
The boy is safe.

98
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:24,661
John!
John!

99
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:27,463
Are you alright? Hmm?

100
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,220
Tell me...
what about the boy?

101
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:37,183
You keep saying the boy is safe.
The boy is safe. What boy?

102
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:39,436
You. You're the boy.

103
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:41,938
I... am the boy?

104
00:19:42,606 --> 00:19:44,941
She saved you. She's alive Sam.

105
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:46,693
Who?

106
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,653
Your mother.

107
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:53,366
No, that's not possible, John.

108
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,659
She survived.

109
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,412
John, my mother is dead.

110
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:02,042
She's alive. I know her name.
I know where she lives.

111
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,590
But that is not possible John.
How could you know that? How?

112
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:16,264
I'm scared Sam.
What's happening to me?

113
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:34,908
Hello.

114
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,952
Hello! May I speak to?

115
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,330
Yes.

116
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:42,290
Is Johanna there please?

117
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,542
One moment.

118
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,385
Hello! Hello, who is it please?

119
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:10,485
Well, you are either in possession
of a very new human ability...

120
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,239
...or a very old one.

121
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,743
Yes. Oh, over here will be fine.

122
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:20,870
Thank you.

123
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:29,712
Try to get you back
on your feet in a day or two.

124
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:33,049
That should help you get some
of your strength back.

125
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,683
What's on your mind, Sam?

126
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:48,773
You were right John,
about my mother.

127
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:54,070
I got the number
from information.

128
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,074
There it was,
right in the phone book.

129
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,659
Did you talk to her?

130
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,873
No, I didn't. I um--

131
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,837
She came to the phone,
but I just couldn't talk to her.

132
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,047
I hung up.

133
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:15,175
Why?

134
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:21,931
Why?
Because it wasn't meant to be.

135
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,602
It wasn't meant to be.

136
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,312
Chug, chug, chug!

137
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:30,565
Come on easy now. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.

138
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:34,569
Weight down, knees up. Keep it
moving. Keep it moving. Chug. Chug.

139
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,197
That's it.

140
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:44,204
That's it? After all I've done.
That's what I get. Eight lousy steps?

141
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,538
I counted ten.

142
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,751
I'd really like to see you
do some serious chugging.

143
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:53,421
I'm gonna take a run around
the building. You stay here?

144
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,047
OK.

145
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:55,590
- Keep chugging?
- OK.

146
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,425
See you when I get back.

147
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,056
Johnny.

148
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,270
They told me you were outside.

149
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,231
I am.

150
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:15,068
I didn't know
if I should come or not.

151
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:17,529
It's alright.

152
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:28,998
You got your hair cut.

153
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:34,462
Oh, yeah, a long time ago.
You lost weight.

154
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:39,634
Call it coma diet.
Lose weight while you sleep.

155
00:23:43,806 --> 00:23:45,807
I guess you know I got married.

156
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:47,433
I heard that.

157
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,271
I think you'd like him.

158
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:54,023
You still teach?

159
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:56,901
Mmm. Mmm.
Mothering's a full time job.

160
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:00,071
Kids too. I didn't know that.

161
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:04,617
I'm sorry. Thought your father
would have told you.

162
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,250
He's a wonderful little boy.
His name is Denny.

163
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,252
How old is he?

164
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:15,712
Ten months.

165
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,638
Glad for you.

166
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:41,446
Please don't look at me like that.

167
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:46,117
What am I gonna do? For you,
five years have come and gone.

168
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:52,498
For me, it's just about the next day.
My feelings haven't changed yet.

169
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:59,339
Oh, Johnny!
Why did it have to happen like this?

170
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,257
Bad luck.

171
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,891
I never should have
let you go that night.

172
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:14,729
It was my idea, remember?
Jerk!

173
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,658
Everybody's talking about you.
You're the talk of the town.

174
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:31,871
'Cos I got my head bashed in.
And I'm still here to talk about it?

175
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:37,168
Because you have the power
of second sight. Is it true Johnny?

176
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,838
The papers won't let up about it.

177
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,760
I keep thinking about a line from a book.
It's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".

178
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,681
The last thing I gave my class to read
before the accident.

179
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,728
Ichabod Crane disappears.
The line goes

180
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:59,941
"As he was a bachelor
and in nobody's debt,

181
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,902
nobody troubled their head
about him, anymore".

182
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:05,613
Is that what you're afraid of?

183
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,657
That's what I want.

184
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:44,777
I don't approve.

185
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:52,326
The press has been hounding me since
I woke up. I wanna get it over with.

186
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,912
Once you set something
like this in motion,

187
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:58,416
it seems to me
you'll never know where it'll lead.

188
00:27:00,627 --> 00:27:03,546
It's already in motion.
Just wanna stop it.

189
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:08,676
They went over there and put it out.
And that's all there is.

190
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:14,766
Clement Dardis WJGE-TV.
What happened to the little girl?

191
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:16,893
I understand she's fine.

192
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,607
Well... Would you call this
a psychic experience?

193
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,067
No. I would not.

194
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,487
Ever had one of these
experiences before?

195
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:28,654
No.

196
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:32,408
How about a demonstration, John?

197
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:34,160
A what?

198
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,914
A demonstration.
Um, got any predictions?

199
00:27:38,332 --> 00:27:42,210
You think Greg Stillson's
gonna unseat Senator Proctor?

200
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:44,545
Who?

201
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:46,047
Greg Stillson.

202
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,469
Er, thank you sir. No more.

203
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:57,725
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How
about it John? How about the election?

204
00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:00,770
I don't even know
who you're talking about?

205
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,023
Why, you didn't know
anything about this nurse?

206
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:05,775
That was different...

207
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:14,033
Well I...
I touched her hand.

208
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,120
Oh, right! Oh, right!

209
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:21,958
Touch my hand.

210
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:27,213
Hey John, touch my hand.
So is my house on fire, John?

211
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,132
Do you want me to stop this?

212
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,846
Tell you about your house.
What do you want to know?

213
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,556
Do you wanna know the future?

214
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:39,851
Do you wanna know if you're gonna'
die? Is that it? You're gonna die.

215
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:42,144
I'm gonna die. You wanna know
if you're gonna die tomorrow?

216
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:48,067
Is that right? You wanna know
why your sister killed herself?

217
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:51,571
Right, we're done, let go.

218
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:52,405
It's not alright.

219
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,197
It's OK.

220
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:54,407
It's not OK.

221
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,576
OK.

222
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:57,994
I could tell you now.

223
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,163
I'm not gonna talk about that.
Let go of me, you fucking freak.

224
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,957
Stop it. Please stop it.

225
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,166
It's real important.

226
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:05,918
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

227
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,339
You heard him.

228
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,896
Dr Danvers, call 1522.
Dr Danvers, call 1522.

229
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:28,900
Oh, yes nurse.
Notify Dr Morton that I'm out here.

230
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,193
She knows you're coming.

231
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,617
- Doctor, thanks for bringing the boy.
- That's alright.

232
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,885
Hello.

233
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:56,844
It's Johnny, mom.

234
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:01,474
Oh! Johnny.

235
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,564
Leave your boots
outside the door, dear.

236
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,651
Don't go tracking snow
all over the house.

237
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,364
I won't.

238
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:18,741
You're a good boy.

239
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,708
You're wasting your time here, sheriff.
You know that. Don't you?

240
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:15,339
Well, you never know Frank.
Worth a try.

241
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:26,267
Mr Smith?

242
00:31:26,435 --> 00:31:28,352
Yeah, yeah. I'm Herb Smith.

243
00:31:28,478 --> 00:31:32,148
George Bannerman. How do you do?
Castle Rock. May I come in?

244
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:34,275
Yeah, yeah. Sure, come in.

245
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:38,112
It's a little nippy out there.

246
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:44,452
- That's a nice tree you got there.
- Thanks.

247
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:47,329
May I do something for you, sheriff?

248
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:52,752
Well actually, if this is your son,
I came to see him. Are you John?

249
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:54,587
Sheriff Bannerman.

250
00:31:58,592 --> 00:31:59,467
Castle Rock.

251
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,306
Well, I guess I've come to you
with what you'd call a proposal, John.

252
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:09,268
It has to do with these murders we've
been having. The Castle Rock killer.

253
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,271
- I'm sure you've heard of him.
- Sure.

254
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:19,653
I don't know whether
it's true or not, John,

255
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,657
about these
psychic powers of yours.

256
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,711
But if it is true, John.
I could use your help.

257
00:32:36,546 --> 00:32:39,131
John, maybe
you should give him a...

258
00:32:41,134 --> 00:32:45,012
Take a minute to think about it.
But bear in mind,

259
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:48,557
some decent young women
from homes like this,

260
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:54,313
met with terrible deaths.
Now, I'm at my wits' end.

261
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:59,401
I've exhausted about all conventional
methods of approach to this situation.

262
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:04,490
I've come up with nothing.
I feel you can help me, John.

263
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:10,996
You made a mistake.

264
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:13,541
Mmm...

265
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,174
I was sorry to hear about your
mother's death, John. Mr. Smith.

266
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:25,845
I understand she was
a good woman. Christian woman.

267
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:33,227
I'm not a religious man myself,
I'm sorry to say. But I will say this.

268
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:40,151
If God has seen fit to bless you
with this gift, you should use it.

269
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:48,117
Bless me?
You know what God did for me?

270
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,245
He threw an
eighteen-wheel truck at me.

271
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:54,165
Bounced me into nowhere
for five years.

272
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:58,794
When I woke up my girl was gone.
My job was gone.

273
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,839
My legs are just about useless.
Bless me?

274
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,551
God's been a real sport to me.

275
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:22,067
Alright John. If you change your mind,
you know where I am...

276
00:34:27,657 --> 00:34:29,241
Merry Christmas to you.

277
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:45,883
Well?

278
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,220
Well what?

279
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:52,389
See. What did I tell you?

280
00:35:07,864 --> 00:35:11,742
That murder she was talking about.
God-awful things.

281
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:15,329
Went on all during the time
you were in a coma.

282
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:20,334
Just don't have the knack for tinsel.

283
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,755
It was your mother who always
kept the tree looking good...

284
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:33,764
I wish to God she were here now, so
she could talk to you about this thing.

285
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:37,518
I'm not much help to you, am I?

286
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:38,769
Sure you are.

287
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:47,486
You, uh, want to talk about it?

288
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:50,322
Not that much to say.

289
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:55,050
It don't bring you much happiness,
does it, son?

290
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:57,189
When it happens...

291
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:01,784
when the spells come,

292
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,423
it feels like--
I don't know.

293
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:09,526
It feels like
I'm dying... inside.

294
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:23,605
No snow.
It should snow for Christmas.

295
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:15,032
Hi. I brought you a visitor.

296
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,326
I didn't know you were coming.

297
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,413
I wasn't sure myself.

298
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:26,919
I'm glad. If I'd known you were
coming, I'd have cleaned up.

299
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:33,133
You look wonderful.
You lost the crutches I see.

300
00:37:34,135 --> 00:37:37,304
Yeah. I still got the limp.

301
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,433
Is your father home?

302
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:47,856
No. He won't be back till later.
Is that who I think it is?

303
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:49,274
His Majesty.

304
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,193
Danny.

305
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,363
Denny. Say Hi.

306
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:56,115
Denny.

307
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,620
It's cold. Come on in.

308
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:27,271
He's asleep.

309
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:40,492
Last time we were alone together,
you said some things

310
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:48,125
were worth waiting for.
Well, haven't we waited long enough?

311
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:25,037
Dad's been carrying on
with Charlene McKenzie.

312
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,164
Ever since her husband died,
she's got him over there

313
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:30,125
building one thing or another.
But if you ask me it's the company

314
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:32,002
she wants
more than the bookcases.

315
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:33,086
I heard that.

316
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:38,759
Hup. Hup.

317
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:42,137
That's a boy.

318
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:47,935
There you are young fella'.

319
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:51,438
I made that for John,
the night he was born.

320
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:53,023
It's an excellent chair.

321
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,901
So what have you two
been up to all day?

322
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,279
Making bookcases.

323
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,244
Sit down, dinner's ready.

324
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,883
Boy, that smells good. I'm starved.

325
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,969
I hope you like it.

326
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:25,138
I bet he will. He's fed up
with my cuisine.

327
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,938
For what we are about to receive may
the Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.

328
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:47,244
You know it feels good to have
a family around this table again.

329
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,430
Am I going to see you again?

330
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:13,145
Not like today.
Go inside you're freezing.

331
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,939
It, it doesn't have to.

332
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,859
Don't say it. Don't say it Johnny.

333
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,365
I'll just say goodnight.

334
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:06,239
...Joan of Arc.
But his wife said before today...

335
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,701
Well, guess I'll hit the hay.

336
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,870
I'm gonna watch some TV.

337
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:14,414
The Castle Rock killer's
in the news again.

338
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,582
Good night, son.

339
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,794
Despite the continuing
efforts on the part of police,

340
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,422
the killer is still at large and is likely
to remain so for some time.

341
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:24,508
We spoke to Sheriff George
Bannerman outside

342
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:26,968
the Castle County courthouse
earlier today.

343
00:42:28,388 --> 00:42:33,433
We have no new leads at this time.
However, there is always the hope

344
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:37,062
that some citizen,
perhaps in the audience right now,

345
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,440
might have some information
that would be very helpful.

346
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,067
My line is always open.

347
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:45,862
And I would welcome any help
we can possibly get.

348
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,782
That's really all I have to say
at this time. Thank you.

349
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:50,659
Thus far, nine separate murders

350
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,869
have been attributed
to the Castle Rock killer,

351
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:55,539
dating back almost
three and a half years.

352
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:59,126
The most recent victim of this
shocking wave of rape murders

353
00:42:59,293 --> 00:43:01,461
was 15 year old Debbie Lindeman.

354
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:04,131
A sophomore
at Castle Rock high school.

355
00:43:04,257 --> 00:43:07,634
Her partially clad body was
found just one month ago today

356
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,138
in the rock lane boat yard.
As in the other Castle Rock killings,

357
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:13,765
cause of death was determined
by the coroner's office

358
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:18,645
to be multiple stab wounds.
Next on News Eight,

359
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:22,774
sports and weather with Ron.
After this important message.

360
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:27,738
I'm gonna help him.

361
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:30,949
What did you say, son?

362
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:35,000
The sheriff that came here...

363
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,447
Bannerman.

364
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm going to help him.

365
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:47,674
We think the killer hid
around the corner,

366
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:50,635
just out the end of the tunnel there.

367
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:55,140
And when the poor girl came through,
the bastard was waiting for her.

368
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:58,351
Tell the kids
not to come through here. Dammit.

369
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:02,189
You know they like to use this
as a short cut to school.

370
00:44:07,528 --> 00:44:08,779
He stood right here.

371
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:15,494
Found a lot of cigarette butts, same
brand. Eight or nine butts here.

372
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:17,496
This help you any?

373
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:23,335
I don't know. Have you got something
he might have touched or worn?

374
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:26,755
Frank, give me that package.

375
00:44:31,594 --> 00:44:34,387
It's the only real evidence we have.

376
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:37,557
Found it in one
of the bushes back there.

377
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:43,438
Same brand as the butts
we found in the ground. Here.

378
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:35,407
Nothing.

379
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,914
I thought I might
have felt something. But I...

380
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,625
It's OK. It's OK.
Can't say we didn't try. Huh?

381
00:45:46,294 --> 00:45:48,211
Dispatch to Sheriff Bannerman.

382
00:45:49,297 --> 00:45:51,840
Yeah, this is Bannerman.

383
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:54,968
We got another body here, sheriff.

384
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:59,431
Oh. Dammit!

385
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,809
What's the word George?

386
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,103
What's the word on the stabbings.
Sheriff?

387
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:08,273
What's the word on
the Castle Rock Killer?

388
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,650
That's that psychic Smith,
isn't it?

389
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:16,281
Stand back please. Give us a break.
We're trying to do a job.

390
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:31,880
Anyone know who she is? Dodd?

391
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:51,358
Yeah I know this girl.
Her name is Alma Frechette.

392
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,986
She works at the Coffee Pot café
across the way there.

393
00:46:56,364 --> 00:46:59,240
Your idea George
to have a psychic with qualifications?

394
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:00,909
Dodd, get these people out of here.

395
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:04,746
Move 'em back. Move the
people back. Knock it off -

396
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:08,124
those cameras now.
No more cameras. No more.

397
00:47:08,918 --> 00:47:10,794
- Dodd!
- Yeah.

398
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,756
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, sheriff.

399
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:26,559
You wanna try?

400
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,104
Hey Alma. Hi.

401
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,149
Hi. What are you doing up there?

402
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:17,110
Waiting for you.
How about a little smile?

403
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:18,611
She knows him.

404
00:48:28,247 --> 00:48:29,581
She knows him.

405
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,386
Why should
I waste a smile on you?

406
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:46,306
You want to see something.
It's the God damndest thing.

407
00:48:46,474 --> 00:48:47,265
What?

408
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,309
Come up here to the gazebo.

409
00:48:57,026 --> 00:49:04,741
She knows him. Not scared.
She knows him.

410
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:10,163
Alright.

411
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:23,968
Well, what did you want to show me?

412
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:33,645
Gazebo! You like that word, Alma?
Come here, look at this.

413
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:40,110
Jesus. Will you let go of me?
Is this your idea of a joke?

414
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:41,111
No joke!

415
00:49:58,462 --> 00:49:59,379
Wait!

416
00:50:01,757 --> 00:50:04,843
You alright? Dodd give me a hand.

417
00:50:05,553 --> 00:50:10,557
I saw him. I was there. I saw him.
I stood there. I saw his face.

418
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:11,641
Who?

419
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:15,228
I stood there and
watched him kill that girl. Dodd!

420
00:50:15,771 --> 00:50:17,021
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

421
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:21,568
I did nothing. I stood there
and watched him kill that girl.

422
00:50:21,694 --> 00:50:23,361
Who are you talking about?

423
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:29,617
Dodd.
I stood there, I did nothing.

424
00:50:32,246 --> 00:50:36,583
Dodd! Dodd get up here.

425
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,379
He just took off in your car sheriff.

426
00:50:45,384 --> 00:50:48,720
I saw his face. I saw his face.

427
00:51:06,447 --> 00:51:08,323
I want you to stay there.

428
00:51:32,765 --> 00:51:33,765
Sheriff.

429
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:38,019
I thought
I told you to stay by the car.

430
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,146
Who's there?

431
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,234
It's Sheriff Bannerman.
Wanna talk to your son, Mrs Dodd.

432
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:46,402
He isn't here.

433
00:51:47,446 --> 00:51:49,322
Well, his patrol car's out here.

434
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:51,866
Well his car's here. But he isn't.

435
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,203
He's here. I saw him in the window.

436
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:04,712
I'm tellin you he isn't home.

437
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,631
- I'm coming in, Mrs Dodd.
- No!

438
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:19,727
You leave my boy alone.

439
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,837
You knew.

440
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:30,642
Didn't you?

441
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:33,500
You knew.

442
00:52:33,973 --> 00:52:36,579
You...

443
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:41,519
You're a devil...

444
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,526
sent from hell!

445
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:35,405
Frank.

446
00:56:45,452 --> 00:56:46,577
Hello, John.

447
00:56:49,748 --> 00:56:50,873
May I come in?

448
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:12,019
How did you find me? My father?

449
00:57:13,438 --> 00:57:17,858
Stopped off to see him. And he
told me you moved to a new town.

450
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:21,737
He's worried about you. And so am I.

451
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:27,410
There's nothing to worry about. I'm
taking care of myself. It's about time.

452
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:31,622
I'm still your doctor John.
You're still under my care.

453
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:35,084
We have to stay in touch.

454
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:41,757
How's the, uh--
All healed up?

455
00:57:44,386 --> 00:57:48,973
The bullet went right through me.
It's nothing.

456
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:55,229
Good. Nice place you have here.

457
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:01,944
It's home.

458
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,495
Those headaches are getting worse.
Aren't they?

459
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:14,540
Three or four times a day sometimes.

460
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,128
I brought you some new medication.

461
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,047
No. No more pills.

462
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:25,926
Takes time to recover. The healing
process is slow. I told you many times.

463
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:32,808
I'm not getting better.
I'm getting worse. Isn't that right?

464
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,019
Alright.

465
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:50,526
Now listen. In the last few
months I've done some research

466
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,412
into the area
of psychic phenomena.

467
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:57,792
Several cases such as yours
have been documented -

468
00:58:57,918 --> 00:58:59,960
I was surprised to discover.

469
00:59:00,253 --> 00:59:03,172
And the pattern is always the same.

470
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:09,053
As the spells, the visions grow stronger
and more powerful,

471
00:59:09,262 --> 00:59:11,263
so the body weakens.

472
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:16,519
But I don't need any research
or documentation

473
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:21,273
to see that this thing is sucking
the life out of you.

474
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:24,151
One look at you can tell me that.

475
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:28,906
You mean I'm gonna die? How long?

476
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:34,870
I think we can arrest the process.
Reverse it even.

477
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,580
How do you do that?

478
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:37,748
Come back with me.

479
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:38,791
Where?

480
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:40,042
To the clinic of course.

481
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:42,878
No. Absolutely no.

482
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,755
John please! You must.

483
00:59:45,507 --> 00:59:47,258
Why? So you can study me.

484
00:59:47,426 --> 00:59:54,932
No. So I can protect you. You need to
be in a controlled environment, John.

485
00:59:56,977 --> 01:00:01,272
I wanna show you something.
Come with me.

486
01:00:04,985 --> 01:00:07,486
The cards and letters
just keep pouring in.

487
01:00:09,656 --> 01:00:10,906
What is all this?

488
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:14,660
It's people. Lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.

489
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:17,830
You haven't opened them.

490
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:23,127
I don't have to. They all want the same
thing. Reassurance. Help. Love.

491
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:29,467
Things I can't give them. My father
sends this stuff onto me. I let it pile up.

492
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:32,052
Why? Why do you keep it?

493
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:36,098
This is why
I can't go on. Live my life.

494
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:40,478
Why I have to stay
locked up here in the house.

495
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:43,647
I'm already living in a controlled
environment, Sam.

496
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:48,510
Nothing can touch me here.

497
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:52,439
I'm alone.

498
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:55,716
I'm safe.

499
01:00:57,509 --> 01:01:01,013
"But instead of dying,

500
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,028
she shall only fall into...

501
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,530
a profound sleep

502
01:01:08,587 --> 01:01:12,968
which shall last a hundred years."

503
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:17,348
That's my mom.

504
01:01:20,393 --> 01:01:21,352
OK.

505
01:01:24,105 --> 01:01:25,231
- Bye.
- Bye.

506
01:01:25,398 --> 01:01:26,649
John Smith?

507
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:35,950
Hi. I'm Roger Stuart.
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

508
01:01:45,627 --> 01:01:46,585
Sit down.

509
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:55,168
What can I do for you?

510
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:58,500
Um... it's, uh--

511
01:01:59,237 --> 01:02:02,184
it's my boy,
my son, Chris.

512
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,000
He needs help.

513
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:09,483
I've enquired around.
You come highly recommended.

514
01:02:11,903 --> 01:02:13,487
What's the matter with him?

515
01:02:14,573 --> 01:02:20,786
I wish I knew. He's bright, I know he is.
But he won't take part in school.

516
01:02:20,912 --> 01:02:26,292
He won't join in. He won't learn.
And, God, he's so shy.

517
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,590
You think you could help him?

518
01:02:33,466 --> 01:02:36,051
I wouldn't know that unless I met him.

519
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:40,306
Well he's not in the car. He wouldn't
come with me today.

520
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:42,433
You have
to come out to the house.

521
01:02:43,018 --> 01:02:48,480
No that's out of the question.
It's just not the way I do it.

522
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:51,233
It won't work otherwise.

523
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:57,281
Please, if you come out to the house
he'll get to know you.

524
01:02:57,365 --> 01:03:01,827
Then you can bring him back here
for the lessons. Please.

525
01:03:04,497 --> 01:03:05,664
OK.

526
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:10,419
Great. Tomorrow morning's Saturday.
I'll send a car over to pick you up.

527
01:03:13,882 --> 01:03:15,007
Thank you.

528
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:15,567
That reminds me of my first campaign,
when I ran for a seat in the Senate.

529
01:04:15,694 --> 01:04:18,529
Upstate in my hometown,
my opponent went down to the ghetto,

530
01:04:18,613 --> 01:04:22,366
he was handing out dollar bills to them
black people, trying to buy votes.

531
01:04:22,534 --> 01:04:26,537
I went down there. I said

532
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:29,456
Then go back and get some more
'cos times is rough.

533
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:31,500
But once
in the voting booth, I want you

534
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:33,752
to vote for whomever
you damn well please."

535
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,130
Well, we won that election by-
what Sonny?

536
01:04:36,256 --> 01:04:36,839
Twenty-nine.

537
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:39,383
Twenty-nine percentage point.
We've been winning ever since.

538
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,136
And those people spent that money
with a clear conscience.

539
01:04:44,973 --> 01:04:47,933
Hi John! Good morning.
Nice to see you.

540
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:50,769
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
my son's tutor. John Smith.

541
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:53,814
- John this is Greg Stillson.
- How are you John?

542
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:56,233
Of course,
this gentlemen is Averill Grant?

543
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:57,234
Elliman. Sonny Elliman.

544
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,738
Sonny Elliman, right here.
Well Greg, you got some good ideas.

545
01:05:00,822 --> 01:05:02,614
You gotta let me think about 'em.

546
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:06,827
Listen Roger, we've got a good
thing going and it's going strong.

547
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:10,581
And I want you to be a part of it. I need
your support. I need your expertise.

548
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:14,918
I need your input. And most
importantly I need your money.

549
01:05:16,463 --> 01:05:17,421
God bless Roger.

550
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:18,422
I'll be seeing you.

551
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:19,757
Thanks for dropping by Greg.

552
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:22,092
- I'll see you. Bye, bye.
- I'll see you Sonny.

553
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:23,969
My God, what a glorious day.

554
01:05:26,097 --> 01:05:26,847
Amen.

555
01:05:32,645 --> 01:05:36,607
Sorry about that.
Well, let's go and see Chris.

556
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:37,608
Sure.

557
01:05:40,653 --> 01:05:45,532
Chris, this is Johnny. Remember
I told you he was coming this morning.

558
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:51,872
I'll leave you two alone
to get acquainted.

559
01:06:20,485 --> 01:06:22,402
Your father says there's
something wrong with you.

560
01:06:22,529 --> 01:06:27,241
He wants me to bring you out of your
shell; I don't know what to do.

561
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:35,332
You don't have to do anything. It's my
dad that lives in a shell. Not me.

562
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:21,753
Chris has really taken
to you John. I'm impressed.

563
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,881
Made a lot of progress for one day.

564
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:25,215
Just had a talk.

565
01:07:25,592 --> 01:07:29,720
Well, with Chris that's a real
achievement. You want a drink?

566
01:07:30,597 --> 01:07:31,138
No.

567
01:07:31,306 --> 01:07:32,347
Don't want a beer?

568
01:07:32,807 --> 01:07:33,515
OK.

569
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:35,642
Brian, get him a beer.

570
01:07:46,654 --> 01:07:48,155
Here let's listen to this.

571
01:07:49,157 --> 01:07:51,617
Ninety-nine.
One hundred.

572
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:59,208
How are ya' doin'? I'm Greg Stillson.
Just thought I'd drop by here on my way

573
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,292
to the US Senate.

574
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:03,420
Greg Stillson. You remember
you met him in the hall this morning.

575
01:08:03,588 --> 01:08:05,589
Thanks for coming out all of you.

576
01:08:05,673 --> 01:08:08,300
Boy you gotta be in good shape
to go the full distance

577
01:08:08,426 --> 01:08:10,385
for those big boys
down in Washington.

578
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,471
You gotta stay in shape
all the time for those boys.

579
01:08:12,597 --> 01:08:14,765
You can't turn your back on 'em.

580
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,600
Just stay in better shape
than this country.

581
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:17,935
What the hell is happening
to this country?

582
01:08:18,144 --> 01:08:20,479
Can anybody tell me
what the hell is going on?

583
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:23,607
I read in one of your local papers...

584
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:28,028
Can you believe this guy?
He's just getting warmed up.

585
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,573
Are you going
to vote for him, John?

586
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:34,826
I'm not even registered.

587
01:08:35,036 --> 01:08:37,621
- You're not registered?
- No.

588
01:08:38,206 --> 01:08:42,793
Well, get registered, pal, and vote
against this turkey. He's dangerous.

589
01:08:43,878 --> 01:08:46,046
And I see all around me
so many unemployed.

590
01:08:46,172 --> 01:08:48,006
What are you people doing here
in the middle of the day?

591
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:52,094
You're standing out in the cold.
Look at each other.

592
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:56,223
How do you feel about each other?
Are you proud of your communities?

593
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:59,101
Would you send the guy
next to you to the US Senate? Uh?

594
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,979
A real man of the people.

595
01:09:02,522 --> 01:09:04,856
Jesus, what an act.

596
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,859
Can't they see through this guy?

597
01:09:08,027 --> 01:09:11,154
I'm mixed up. You both acted like
you were friends this morning.

598
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:16,994
Guys like Stillson, you gotta walk the
thin line. You can't get too close,

599
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:19,538
'cos if they lose,
they'll drag you down with them.

600
01:09:19,706 --> 01:09:24,293
On the other hand if he wins
- and this turkey just might -

601
01:09:24,419 --> 01:09:27,254
you gotta make sure
he thought he was a good friend.

602
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,339
Know what I mean John?

603
01:09:29,549 --> 01:09:31,383
They're not working there's
unemployment everywhere.

604
01:09:31,509 --> 01:09:34,636
I've come down here today
with a job for every one of you.

605
01:09:34,762 --> 01:09:37,556
I've come here today
with a challenge for all of you.

606
01:09:37,724 --> 01:09:40,851
I'm challenging you right
here and now to join me.

607
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:45,605
Join a growing army of volunteer
workers on my campaign.

608
01:09:45,857 --> 01:09:51,278
Let's send Greg Stillson to the US
Senate and mediocrity to hell.

609
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:21,016
What can I do for you boys?

610
01:10:22,393 --> 01:10:25,062
You work late, Mr Brenner.
That's very admirable.

611
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:27,814
I'm Greg Stillson.

612
01:10:29,484 --> 01:10:31,818
I know who you are, Mr Stillson.

613
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:35,989
Now take your paid gorilla
and get out of my office.

614
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,452
My friend Sonny doesn't
want to see anybody hurt.

615
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,287
But we got a little problem here.

616
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:44,539
Get to the point Mr Stillson.

617
01:10:45,249 --> 01:10:48,210
You know I'm damn well even
in the polls. See, I'm catchin' on.

618
01:10:48,336 --> 01:10:49,961
The people gotta a need for me.

619
01:10:50,129 --> 01:10:53,090
I'm gonna win big
and I'll tell you something else.

620
01:10:53,257 --> 01:10:55,759
I've had a vision
that I'm gonna be

621
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:58,762
President of the United States,
someday.

622
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:03,016
And I have accepted that responsibility.
And nobody, I mean nobody,

623
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:05,852
is gonna stop me.

624
01:11:09,607 --> 01:11:13,985
Now, you can just imagine how I felt
when one of my loyal staff people

625
01:11:14,153 --> 01:11:17,531
brought me your editorial that's
gonna hit the streets tomorrow.

626
01:11:18,324 --> 01:11:21,868
You don't seem to like me,
Brenner. But that's OK.

627
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:24,121
Because I don't like you either.

628
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:26,832
How did you get that?

629
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:31,128
Well, like you, Brenner,
I'm not at liberty to reveal my sources.

630
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:35,090
Well, it doesn't make any difference.

631
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:36,383
Because you're right,

632
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:39,261
that editorial is gonna'
hit the streets tomorrow morning.

633
01:11:39,512 --> 01:11:41,138
Not if we can make a deal.

634
01:11:41,848 --> 01:11:43,640
What the hell
are your talking about?

635
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:48,395
I'm talkin' about you stayin' out
of the campaign business

636
01:11:48,563 --> 01:11:51,231
and me stayin' out
of the publishing business.

637
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:53,775
Show him what we've got
to publish, Sonny.

638
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,200
That's your best shot.

639
01:12:04,036 --> 01:12:07,247
I've got lots of loyal people
on my side, Brenner.

640
01:12:07,373 --> 01:12:11,168
That young lady in the photographs
with you is one of them.

641
01:12:11,335 --> 01:12:16,006
Now I've never met Mrs Brenner,
but I'm damn near sure that ain't her.

642
01:12:16,257 --> 01:12:17,674
What do think, Sonny?

643
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:27,517
Is this Mrs Brenner?

644
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:36,735
It doesn't look like her.

645
01:12:36,861 --> 01:12:39,029
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.

646
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:40,363
Who are you calling
a son of a bitch?

647
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:45,535
No, it's alright, Sonny. Let's give
Mr Brenner a chance to think about

648
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:49,122
his wife and kids.
And his position in the community.

649
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:03,136
What if I don't make a deal, Stillson?

650
01:13:03,387 --> 01:13:06,890
Oh, you'll make a deal.
Otherwise I'll have my friend Sonny

651
01:13:06,974 --> 01:13:08,975
take your godamn head off.

652
01:13:12,438 --> 01:13:13,313
Good idea.

653
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,569
You see Sonny, I told you
he was a reasonable man.

654
01:13:19,737 --> 01:13:23,240
Yeah. He's a nice man. I like him.
I like the wife too.

655
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:34,751
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil"
prophet still, if bird or devil!

656
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,337
By that Heaven
that bends above us

657
01:13:37,463 --> 01:13:39,756
by that God we both adore

658
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:44,594
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
if, within the distant Aidenn,

659
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:49,057
It shall clasp a sainted maiden
whom the angels named Lenore."

660
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:54,271
Chris, skip to the part where he talks
about "will I ever see her again".

661
01:13:57,024 --> 01:14:01,319
"Eagerly I wished the morrow
Vainly I had sought to borrow

662
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:05,240
from my books surcease of sorrow.
Sorrow for the lost Lenore.

663
01:14:05,366 --> 01:14:07,242
For the rare and radiant maiden

664
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:12,038
Whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore".

665
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:16,585
Stop, I'll be right back.

666
01:14:27,179 --> 01:14:29,139
Good afternoon, sir. We're out
in your neighbourhood today,

667
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:30,807
talking about Greg Stillson.

668
01:14:31,183 --> 01:14:33,226
You're familiar with our candidate,
aren't you?

669
01:14:33,352 --> 01:14:34,477
What do you think?

670
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:42,402
Yeah, right. But are you aware
of what Greg Stillson stands for?

671
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:47,365
Greg Stillson's mounting the most
successful third party movement

672
01:14:47,491 --> 01:14:48,992
this state has ever seen.

673
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,038
Stillson represents both the poor
and the well-off, the young and the old.

674
01:14:53,164 --> 01:14:55,874
Could you come back?
I have a student.

675
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,668
Oh, sure. I know you're busy. Can I
leave you some literature, though?

676
01:14:58,794 --> 01:14:59,502
Sure.

677
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:02,047
Honey! Could you bring
some of those brochures?

678
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:20,857
Hello, Johnny.

679
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:26,863
Hi.

680
01:15:29,575 --> 01:15:31,493
Is this where you're living now?

681
01:15:31,577 --> 01:15:34,204
Yeah. I'm...
I'm back to teaching.

682
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:37,082
This is my husband, Walt.

683
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:43,254
Nice to meet you finally, John. I've
heard Sarah talk about you so often.

684
01:15:47,218 --> 01:15:50,637
Hey. Come back, Johnny.
It's no fun reading by myself.

685
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:53,723
Chris. Walt and Sarah.

686
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:55,892
Hi.

687
01:15:57,603 --> 01:16:00,438
We'll let you get back to work. We've
got a lot of ground to cover ourselves.

688
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:01,398
Don't we honey?

689
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,402
Nice to meet you.

690
01:16:05,653 --> 01:16:06,111
Bye.

691
01:16:06,237 --> 01:16:08,738
Don't forget who to vote for
on Election Day.

692
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,205
Bye.

693
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:27,298
Who was that?

694
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:34,806
Hey. You OK?

695
01:16:40,771 --> 01:16:46,860
Why are you crying, Johnny?
Johnny!

696
01:17:26,025 --> 01:17:27,525
What's the matter?

697
01:17:28,486 --> 01:17:29,903
Nothing.

698
01:17:30,988 --> 01:17:32,197
My ride's here.

699
01:17:32,656 --> 01:17:34,157
I'm going with you.

700
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:45,168
I gotta talk to you.

701
01:17:45,336 --> 01:17:46,294
Hi, Johnny.

702
01:17:47,713 --> 01:17:49,214
What is this? What are you doing?

703
01:17:49,381 --> 01:17:52,175
Pretty good stuff, huh?
I organised a hockey team for Chris

704
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:53,343
and some of his friends.

705
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:56,137
We have our
first practice this afternoon.

706
01:17:56,263 --> 01:17:57,764
You are looking at the coach.

707
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:58,598
Call it off.

708
01:17:58,766 --> 01:18:00,183
Take that stuff in the garage, OK?

709
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:01,768
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.

710
01:18:01,936 --> 01:18:06,272
Call it off? What for? Chris has been
looking forward to this all week, huh?

711
01:18:07,733 --> 01:18:09,692
He's really coming out of his shell,
John.

712
01:18:09,777 --> 01:18:12,237
Wait. I gotta talk to you.

713
01:18:15,616 --> 01:18:18,284
We'll have a little nourishment
and then we'll hit the ice.

714
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:21,913
No. Listen to me. There's gonna'
be an accident. Call it off.

715
01:18:22,081 --> 01:18:24,415
Don't be ridiculous. We always skate
on that pond until March.

716
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:26,251
What the hell is the matter with you?

717
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:28,002
You wanna kill your own son?

718
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:29,587
I'm scared, dad.

719
01:18:30,256 --> 01:18:34,217
For Christ's sake, John. Don't be
scared. Just go and eat your cookies.

720
01:18:34,593 --> 01:18:36,594
Don't you know who I am?

721
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:41,349
Course I know who you are. You think
I'd have you come into my son's life,

722
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:44,519
without checking you out. But I hired
you for your abilities as a teacher.

723
01:18:44,603 --> 01:18:48,022
Not a fortune teller.
Don't give me any argument.

724
01:18:50,568 --> 01:18:52,861
The ice is gonna break.

725
01:18:54,905 --> 01:18:59,284
I want you outta here. I don't want you
in my boy's life, anymore.

726
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:02,078
And I don't want any argument
from you. I want you to do exactly

727
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:03,621
what I'm telling you now.

728
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:08,918
No Dad.
You don't know. It's not safe.

729
01:19:10,754 --> 01:19:13,798
Alright to hell with it. To hell
with the whole thing. Forget it all.

730
01:19:13,966 --> 01:19:17,594
Forget the hockey team, forget the
practice. But I want you outta here.

731
01:19:18,178 --> 01:19:20,930
Whatever you say.
I'm sorry about the...

732
01:19:21,307 --> 01:19:23,933
I'll see
that you'll get your final cheque.

733
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:30,940
I'm not crazy, you know. Don't let the
boy think I am. I'm right about this.

734
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:35,194
But we'll never know, will we?

735
01:19:38,449 --> 01:19:39,824
Give me your hand.

736
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:52,295
Nothing to worry about now.

737
01:19:52,504 --> 01:19:54,881
My driver will take you home.

738
01:19:57,343 --> 01:19:58,384
You were right.

739
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:22,992
Chris! Hey, what's going on?
You're not even dressed.

740
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:31,876
You called it off.
I thought you called it off.

741
01:20:32,044 --> 01:20:37,090
Why, that was just to get rid of him.
So! Are we going, or not?

742
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:42,345
Are you going to sit here and
pout like a baby in your room?

743
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:45,598
Or are you coming outside
to play hockey with your friends?

744
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:51,938
Right.

745
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:07,055
Hello. Who is it? Johnny!

746
01:23:19,837 --> 01:23:21,254
Sarah.
See you down there, honey.

747
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,213
OK.

748
01:25:46,525 --> 01:25:47,650
Do it, Jim.

749
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,986
For God's sake. I won't.

750
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:52,905
Do it! Put your hand
on the scanning screen

751
01:25:53,031 --> 01:25:55,157
and you'll go down in history with me.

752
01:25:55,242 --> 01:25:58,369
As what? The world's
greatest mass murderers.

753
01:25:58,704 --> 01:26:01,831
You cowardly bastard.
You're not the voice of the people.

754
01:26:01,915 --> 01:26:03,499
I am the voice of the people.

755
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:07,586
The people speak through me not you.
It came to me while I slept, Sonny.

756
01:26:07,713 --> 01:26:11,257
My destiny. In the middle of the night,
it came to me. I must get up now.

757
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:15,511
Right now. And fulfil my destiny.
Now you put your goddamn hand

758
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:20,558
on that scanning screen, or I'll hack
it off and put it on for you. Do it!

759
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:34,822
May God forgive me.

760
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:47,251
Congratulations, General.

761
01:26:50,088 --> 01:26:52,048
Complete the sequence,
Mr President.

762
01:27:12,277 --> 01:27:12,985
My destiny.

763
01:27:21,912 --> 01:27:22,953
Thank you Sonny.

764
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:33,506
Let them come up.

765
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:39,261
This is not necessary, Mr President.
We have a diplomatic solution.

766
01:27:39,346 --> 01:27:45,101
Mr Vice President. Mr Secretary.
The missiles are flying. Hallelujah!

767
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:47,395
Hallelujah!

768
01:28:18,718 --> 01:28:24,765
If you could go back in time. Germany,
say before Hitler came to power.

769
01:28:25,308 --> 01:28:29,979
Knowing what you know now. What
would you do? Would you kill him?

770
01:28:31,815 --> 01:28:36,610
Is that why you sent for me, John?
To ask me this question.

771
01:28:41,658 --> 01:28:47,329
I have to talk to you, Sam.
Because I've had another episode.

772
01:28:48,915 --> 01:28:51,667
Ah, yes. Go on.

773
01:28:53,503 --> 01:28:54,920
I've been tutoring this boy.

774
01:28:55,046 --> 01:28:58,757
His name is Stuart
and in the vision, I saw him drown.

775
01:28:58,884 --> 01:29:01,886
I saw him die, Sam.
But that's not the point.

776
01:29:03,054 --> 01:29:06,015
In the vision, there was something
missing. Something I couldn't see.

777
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,601
How do you mean?

778
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:13,814
I don't know. It was like
a blank spot... A dead zone.

779
01:29:20,197 --> 01:29:26,035
Er, first of all tell me. Did the boy in fact
drown? You say you saw him drown.

780
01:29:26,203 --> 01:29:29,705
No, no. His father wanted to take him to
play hockey. I talked him out of it.

781
01:29:29,873 --> 01:29:31,165
The boy's alive.

782
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:39,507
Ah. Yes, don't you see?
Don't you see how clear it all is?

783
01:29:40,592 --> 01:29:43,260
Not only can you see the future...

784
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,763
- You can...
- I can change it.

785
01:29:46,056 --> 01:29:50,684
You can change it.
Exactly. Ha, here.

786
01:29:53,980 --> 01:29:57,441
Yes John, that is your dead zone.

787
01:29:58,235 --> 01:30:04,073
The possibility of altering
the outcome of your premonitions.

788
01:30:05,659 --> 01:30:07,826
It's fascinating.
Let me make a note.

789
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:12,081
What about my question, Sam?

790
01:30:12,415 --> 01:30:17,419
Huh? Oh, you mean
the one about Hitler.

791
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,464
What would you do?

792
01:30:21,216 --> 01:30:25,010
I don't like the sound of this, John.
What are your getting at?

793
01:30:25,262 --> 01:30:28,138
What would you do?
Would you kill him?

794
01:30:32,018 --> 01:30:35,729
Alright. Alright.
I'll give you an answer.

795
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:39,942
I'm a man of medicine.

796
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:43,696
I'm expected to save lives
and ease suffering.

797
01:30:44,155 --> 01:30:51,412
And I love people. Therefore, I'd have
no choice but to kill the son of a bitch.

798
01:30:59,379 --> 01:31:01,005
You'd never get away alive.

799
01:31:01,631 --> 01:31:06,385
It doesn't matter. I would kill him.
Nosdrovia. Skol.

800
01:32:31,971 --> 01:32:33,972
Dear Sarah,

801
01:32:34,099 --> 01:32:39,186
this is a hard letter to write.
So I'll try and make it short.

802
01:32:40,522 --> 01:32:44,692
I can't go on hiding anymore.
That's what I've been doing.

803
01:32:45,443 --> 01:32:50,030
Running and hiding. You know
I've had this figured out all wrong.

804
01:32:50,782 --> 01:32:53,742
I always thought this power
of mine was a curse.

805
01:32:53,952 --> 01:33:00,290
Now I can see it's a gift. Anyway,
by the time you get this letter,

806
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:05,754
it'll all be over. You never will
understand why, Sarah.

807
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,464
Guess nobody ever will.

808
01:33:07,632 --> 01:33:11,802
But I know what I'm doing.
And I know I'm right.

809
01:33:12,846 --> 01:33:18,475
Just remember there's never
been anyone for me except you.

810
01:33:20,645 --> 01:33:23,480
Just wasn't in the cards
for us I guess.

811
01:33:24,983 --> 01:33:28,652
I'll always love you,
Sarah. Johnny.

812
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:55,007
Thanks very much.
What's your name?

813
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:56,008
Michael.

814
01:35:58,219 --> 01:36:00,929
Hello, Walt. How are you?
This is your baby?

815
01:36:01,014 --> 01:36:01,763
Yeah.

816
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,474
Ah. Bring him up on stage.

817
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:18,340
I wanna thank all of you
from the bottom of my heart

818
01:37:18,466 --> 01:37:20,801
for the tremendous support
you've given this campaign.

819
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:24,888
You've made this campaign the most
talked about, the most exciting,

820
01:37:25,056 --> 01:37:29,142
the most important campaign
in the history of this great state.

821
01:37:29,268 --> 01:37:31,853
And I've come here personally
to thank you for that.

822
01:37:42,865 --> 01:37:43,865
Johnny!

823
01:37:49,622 --> 01:37:53,375
- Give me him!
- Don't! No!

824
01:37:53,793 --> 01:37:55,877
Sonny someone's trying to kill me.

825
01:38:38,713 --> 01:38:41,882
Who are you? You son of a bitch.
Who sent you?

826
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,493
It's over.

827
01:39:13,998 --> 01:39:15,457
You're finished.

828
01:39:19,295 --> 01:39:22,422
Who was that kid with
the camera taking pictures?

829
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,757
I didn't see him.

830
01:39:23,883 --> 01:39:24,716
You ass-hole.

831
01:39:35,478 --> 01:39:37,354
It's OK. It's alright.

832
01:39:52,703 --> 01:39:56,039
Oh Johnny. Why? Why?

833
01:40:03,506 --> 01:40:04,840
Goodbye.

834
01:40:09,178 --> 01:40:10,887
I love you.
