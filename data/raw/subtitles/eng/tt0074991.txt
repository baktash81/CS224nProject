1
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,736
Ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:28,578
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,915
I would like to propose a toast...

4
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:35,616
to Michael and Elizabeth Courtland...

5
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:39,127
this world's last romantics.

6
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,788
Happy tenth anniversary!

7
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,798
Happy anniversary!

8
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:51,864
And if you'll allow me,
a special toast to this man...

9
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,200
a man of endless energy
and ambition...

10
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,008
the cream of the new South...

11
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,676
my dear friend
and new senior partner...

12
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:06,710
in what will soon be the finest real
estate development in New Orleans...

13
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,053
the new Pontchartrain Estates!

14
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,027
Thank you, Bob.

15
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:17,555
Bob has very generously
referred to me...

16
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,067
as part of the cream
of the new South.

17
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:24,231
I think that might be
a little bit genteel for me.

18
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:28,640
I would be more inclined
to consider myself more of...

19
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,407
oh, skim milk of the Middle West
or something.

20
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,249
Energy...

21
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:37,818
ambition.

22
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,115
I would hope...

23
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,090
that we could direct
those qualities...

24
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,126
to try and retain...

25
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:47,424
for the new South...

26
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,091
some of the graceful values
of the old South.

27
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,949
- Daddy.
- What?

28
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,290
- Will you dance with me?
- Will I dance with you?

29
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,796
What will you do
if I dance with you?

30
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,634
I'll dance with you.

31
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,140
Let's bring Mommy in, okay?

32
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,783
- Good night.
- Good night, John.

33
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:19,912
Bob, thanks again.

34
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:23,685
Thank you, Bob.
Good night, Debbie.

35
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,192
Good night.

36
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,825
Thank you.
It was nice having you.

37
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,831
Good night, Carl.

38
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:00,449
Mommy! Mommy!

39
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,638
Honey?

40
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,517
Turn it on.

41
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,520
Come on, kid. Talk, damn it!

42
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,216
Tell your daddy how much
you want him to bring that money!

43
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,556
Daddy, please bring the money,
please!

44
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:16,688
- That's real good.
- Please come get me and Mommy, please!

45
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,996
That's good. That's real good.

46
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,386
Yes?

47
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,898
I'm supposed to bring this
to Mr. Courtland.

48
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,399
Come in.

49
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,409
- What is it, son?
- Mr. Courtland?

50
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,977
The man said you'd give me a tip.

51
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,929
Five dollars! Gee, thanks.

52
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,128
- What did he look like?
- Who?

53
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,603
The man who gave you the bag.

54
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,105
Just a man.

55
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,108
Let's start at the beginning.
Slow down.

56
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,902
Come on, kid! Talk, damn it!

57
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,165
Tell your daddy how much
you want him to bring that money!

58
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:07,731
Daddy, please bring the money,
please!

59
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:12,712
Please come get me and Mommy,
please!

60
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,715
Call the police.

61
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:30,629
I guess I'll have to take my money
out of the Pontchartrain project.

62
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,997
I know, Court.

63
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,502
Just thinkin' about it
makes me sick.

64
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:40,938
You know, I'm not gonna
take advantage of this.

65
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,443
We're gonna develop the land
just as you planned.

66
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:46,002
We'll build your park.

67
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,015
Hell, I like trees.

68
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,752
If you pick up the option,
you're not obligated to do my plan.

69
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:56,484
You can do anything you want with it.
You know that.

70
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:59,083
I want to do this thing for you.

71
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,592
Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that.

72
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,205
Of course, there's still
a week on the option.

73
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,504
If the police can get your money back,
it'll be just like before.

74
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,776
Well, I guess somebody
oughta get to the bank.

75
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,851
I'll go there myself.

76
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:36,793
Inspector Brie is here.
He'd like to see you right now.

77
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:39,333
- Would you send him in?
- Okay.

78
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,733
Hello, Inspector.
Thank you for coming out. Sit down.

79
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,073
Thank you.

80
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,875
Would you like a cup of coffee?

81
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,881
No, thank you, Mr. Courtland.

82
00:12:56,785 --> 00:13:01,119
It's an excruciating situation.

83
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,123
I guess I don't have to
tell you that.

84
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:07,719
Preparing for the worst
and hoping for the best.

85
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,856
I've seen many cases
very similar to this.

86
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:15,369
They all ended up with the successful
return of the hostages...

87
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:17,803
and the apprehension
of the kidnappers.

88
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:23,537
It's just a matter of intelligence
and calm nerves.

89
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,505
Just try to leave this as much
as possible to us, Mr. Courtland.

90
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,575
There's nothing you can really do.

91
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:34,622
I'm willing to pay the money.
The money isn't important.

92
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,658
That's the hell of it, Mr. Courtland.

93
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:39,751
These men are professionals.

94
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,592
If they're caught without the loot,
they give up.

95
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:46,998
If they got the money in hand,
we may have a very dangerous fight.

96
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:48,626
Are you sure?

97
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,838
Absolutely.

98
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:54,974
It is, of course,
finally your decision.

99
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,274
What would you do?

100
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:03,518
Something the lab has developed.

101
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:06,043
Something the lab has developed.

102
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:09,113
We go through the drop
as instructed.

103
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,250
False money
and a small radio transmitter...

104
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,488
in a locked briefcase.

105
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,054
We track the pickup man
by radio truck.

106
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,499
He leads us to the hostages.

107
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,728
Foolproof.

108
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:27,503
At no point will the lives
of your wife and daughter be in danger.

109
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,509
Just leave it to us.

110
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,524
Give me an estimation.

111
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,858
I got it, I got it!

112
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,028
You oughta be happy, little girl.
Your daddy come through with the money.

113
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,164
Everything's gonna be all right.

114
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,902
Mommy, Mommy!
Daddy brought the money!

115
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,703
What the hell is that?

116
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,571
Transmitter.

117
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,109
Son of a bitch!

118
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,877
Look at this. This is what
your old man thinks you're worth!

119
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,474
- Nothin'!
- Mommy!

120
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,542
This is Detective Brie.

121
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,851
This is Detective Brie
of the New Orleans police force.

122
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:37,390
The house is surrounded.

123
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,087
Come out with your hands raised
and you will not be harmed.

124
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,323
- What do we do?
- Be calm. Get the knife.

125
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:45,332
Don't panic.

126
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,732
Cut those ropes
and let's get outta here.

127
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:49,030
Break that window open.

128
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,472
Mommy! Mommy!

129
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,079
Don't shoot unless you
want the kid to get it!

130
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:01,411
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

131
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:34,141
Peterson, this is Brie.

132
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,207
We're on the Broussard Road
approaching the bridge.

133
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,651
Are your roadblocks in place?

134
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,655
All set on your side, Inspector.

135
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,089
I'm helping an oil truck
off the road over here.

136
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:47,992
Get it out of there!
We're on the bridge now!

137
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,324
The wife and daughter of New Orleans
businessman Michael Courtland...

138
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:20,189
were killed yesterday...

139
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,389
when a kidnap-rescue effort
sadly backfired.

140
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:27,161
Over here is Inspector August Brie,
who's in charge of this case.

141
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:30,261
Inspector, can you tell us
exactly what happened here?

142
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm sorry.

143
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:34,869
I can't divulge any information
at this time.

144
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,775
It's just been too tragic,
that's all.

145
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,143
The police did all they could.

146
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,944
The search for the bodies
remains fruitless...

147
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:45,212
hampered by the explosion
of the automobile...

148
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,050
and the currents of the Mississippi.

149
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,862
Here are your tickets.

150
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,429
Now, remember, you leave
at 12:30 tomorrow.

151
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:22,874
You arrive in Rome at 9:10
and you take the Rapido to Florence.

152
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,435
- Do you have your passport?
- Yeah.

153
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:27,504
I'll put these in your briefcase.

154
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:30,846
You about ready, Michael?
I won't be a second.

155
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:32,886
What's that Italian's name,
D'Annunzio?

156
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,819
He's a bit of a bore,
I'm afraid.

157
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,519
A rich one, though.

158
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:39,525
I hope his English
is better than my Italian.

159
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:43,791
You let me take care of him.
He's very susceptible to flattery.

160
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:46,731
He's gonna love it when I tell him
he's as wise as Caesar...

161
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,065
and as honest as the pope.

162
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,402
You know, I'm gonna like
this trip, Bob.

163
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,136
Really, I'm lookin' forward to it.

164
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,306
I can find out what you were doing on
the Florentine junkets all these years.

165
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,247
Food, money...

166
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,310
and above all art, my man.

167
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,356
I'm a lover of fine art.

168
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:13,416
- It's my only vice.
- You're just a Renaissance man, Robert.

169
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,127
He said 8:00.

170
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,469
Oh, thanks, Bob.
You know, I think you're right.

171
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,815
I should have come back
to Italy years ago.

172
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:11,716
I told you, old boy.
It's the birthplace of western art.

173
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,412
One thing that puzzles me.

174
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:18,049
How do these old guys
get such young wives?

175
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,854
- I'll ask them.
- Don't.

176
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:32,663
I think so too. Would you like
to see a picture of my wife?

177
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,139
Picture of your wife?

178
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,676
Go ahead, show him a picture.

179
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:41,040
As Americans say, "Such a jewel."

180
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:42,639
Wonderful woman.

181
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:44,843
And cook... such a cook.

182
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:47,445
She's lovely.

183
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:52,659
This is Maria.
Such a wonderful woman.

184
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:55,385
- And I have six children.
- She's lovely.

185
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:57,158
Lovely lady.

186
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:59,165
Aren't you glad you asked?

187
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,394
A fantastico woman.

188
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:03,835
That's why I have to make
so much money.

189
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,532
She loves money,
and she deserves it.

190
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,700
- Everybody likes money.
- And women.

191
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,176
Oh, not everybody likes money, signor.

192
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,014
You take my partner here,
Michael.

193
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,016
He and I own, in New Orleans...

194
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:21,350
one of the biggest, best plots of land
in the suburban city.

195
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,356
For 15, 16 years...

196
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:26,222
he has refused to build anything
on that land.

197
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,692
Nothing but a tomb.

198
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,726
If you gentlemen will excuse me,
it's a little late.

199
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:38,636
Late? He thinks it's late.

200
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:40,970
Hell, I haven't even danced yet.

201
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:58,316
You should have stayed with us
last night, Court.

202
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:00,417
We aren't getting any younger.

203
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,428
Found that out, did you?

204
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,765
You're not upset
about last night, are you?

205
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,670
So what are we gonna do today?

206
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:15,197
I don't know. I thought we might
just do a little sightseeing...

207
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:18,336
absorb a little culture
and a little less wine.

208
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,046
That sounds great.

209
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,432
Isn't this the church
where you and Elizabeth met?

210
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,435
I'll be right back.

211
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,660
Well, how was it, Court?

212
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:05,571
The same.

213
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:41,377
Well, you about ready to go back
to the old U.S. Of A., Court?

214
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,595
I thought I'd like to stay around
a few more days.

215
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,096
Oh?

216
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,732
I'd like to go back
to that church again.

217
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,067
Why do you wanna do that?

218
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,741
Will you come with me?

219
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:07,075
Well, okay, if it'd
make you feel better.

220
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,657
Oh, my God.

221
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,198
- You sure you're gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

222
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:09,242
- I just need a few days.
- All right.

223
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,944
You take real good care
of yourself now.

224
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,980
Thanks, Bob.

225
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:13,101
Oh, that's all right.
I speak English.

226
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:14,401
You are American?

227
00:37:17,144 --> 00:37:18,577
You like the Madonna?

228
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,274
It was painted in 1328...

229
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:27,183
by Bernardo Daddi.

230
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:29,222
That's early Renaissance.

231
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,749
- You a student?
- No.

232
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:35,590
I used to be...
what do you call it?

233
00:37:35,662 --> 00:37:37,596
Bilingual secretary.

234
00:37:39,032 --> 00:37:42,126
Then one day I read
about the restoration project...

235
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:46,502
and I said, "Sandra,
the Madonna needs you."

236
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,064
So I quit my dull job,
and here I am...

237
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:51,076
an art historian.

238
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,375
I can't think of anything
more important.

239
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,585
Well, at least they don't
holler and scream at you...

240
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,918
when you talk to strange men.

241
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,183
What do you do?

242
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,788
I'm in land development,
real estate.

243
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:12,423
Ah. Well, that sounds important.

244
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:16,935
It's not.

245
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:28,740
My name is Courtland.

246
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,043
Michael Courtland.

247
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:35,451
Happy to meet you.
I'm Sandra.

248
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,921
Sandra Portinari.

249
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,926
You've been doing this work
a long time?

250
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,867
Oh, I'm not doing the restoration.

251
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,870
I'm just a workman.

252
00:38:51,938 --> 00:38:54,532
But I prepare everything
for the specialist.

253
00:38:54,608 --> 00:38:57,805
You see, several years ago...

254
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,539
long after the floods...

255
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:03,549
moisture seeped into a portion
of the altarpiece...

256
00:39:03,617 --> 00:39:05,847
and it began to peel...

257
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:09,320
revealing an older painting
underneath.

258
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,654
Then the art scholars
had to decide what to do.

259
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:17,220
Should they remove and destroy
a great painting by Daddi...

260
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:21,324
to uncover what appears to be
a crude first draft underneath it?

261
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,167
Or should they restore
the original...

262
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:29,140
but never know for sure
what lies beneath it?

263
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,439
What would you do?

264
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,445
Hold on to it.

265
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,012
Beauty should be protected.

266
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,516
Good. That is what
the scholars decided to do.

267
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,184
Now you have a free lecture,
and you don't have to read the brochure.

268
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,512
I wondered if I might...

269
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:14,519
repay you for your lecture...

270
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:16,987
and ask you to dinner somewhere.

271
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,727
You don't understand.

272
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,859
Dinner can be
a pretty serious affair here.

273
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:29,663
Lunch. I know a place nearby.

274
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:35,173
Signor, I thought it was the Italian men
who picked up the American women.

275
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:45,077
All right. Lunch.

276
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,018
But I have to work another
hour and a half before I go.

277
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,081
I'll wait.

278
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:13,602
So you were in Florence before?

279
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:16,840
A long time ago.

280
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:19,441
I was stationed near here
after the war.

281
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,454
I wasn't even born,
but my mother often told me...

282
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,184
how hard times were then.

283
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:27,192
You live with your mother?

284
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,991
Not anymore. I have an apartment
near Ponte Vecchio.

285
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:34,192
But I was raised by my mother.

286
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:37,065
My father deserted us
a long time ago.

287
00:41:37,137 --> 00:41:38,570
That's sad.

288
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,968
What was Florence like
during the Occupation?

289
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:47,308
Confused.

290
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,316
I'm really not an expert
on the Occupation.

291
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:52,749
My mind is elsewhere.

292
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,812
I met my wife there.

293
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,085
Oh, the plot thickens.

294
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,821
Let us sit and tell sad tales...

295
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:05,490
about deserted daughters
and lonely husbands.

296
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,329
I thought you had a familiar
melancholy look...

297
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:11,234
when you came into the church.

298
00:42:11,304 --> 00:42:14,501
That wasn't...
She died a long time ago.

299
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,836
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

300
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,506
It's just that a single girl...

301
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,845
meets a lot of men,
mostly Americans...

302
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,408
who want to tell her
about their wives.

303
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:28,181
It's not very flattering.

304
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:30,988
What was she like?

305
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:34,185
Elizabeth...

306
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,531
She was very much like you.

307
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,863
Like me?

308
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,197
She was Italian?

309
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,204
No, she looked very much like you.

310
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,875
Do you have a picture of her?

311
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,142
I really have to go now.

312
00:42:58,218 --> 00:43:00,709
May I see you again sometime?

313
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,812
Sure.

314
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:05,483
We could have
a nonserious dinner.

315
00:43:05,558 --> 00:43:07,583
- Seriously.
- When?

316
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:10,822
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

317
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,831
Is that all right?

318
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,896
That's only five hours from now.

319
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,530
Plenty of time to change.

320
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:25,667
All right, but I have to go see
my mother at the hospital after work.

321
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:27,940
I'll meet you there.

322
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,842
Oh, it's the San Giovanni.

323
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:32,350
I know.

324
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:34,977
All right.

325
00:43:35,054 --> 00:43:36,988
See you. Ciao.

326
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,919
Ciao.

327
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,662
You're very fond
of that restaurant, aren't you?

328
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:51,169
Yeah.

329
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:55,632
That's where you met Elizabeth.

330
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,768
No, we met in the church
where you're working.

331
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,439
We used to eat
in the restaurant though.

332
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,017
Tell me about her.

333
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,554
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

334
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,853
Well, as I said before,
she's very much like you.

335
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,361
I mean,
she looked very much like you.

336
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,555
She had brown hair...

337
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:23,033
and wore it longer,
kind of different, you know.

338
00:44:23,102 --> 00:44:25,798
And she wore pink lipstick.

339
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,238
And she never wore rouge.

340
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,643
Oh, her walk...

341
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,537
Her walk was 180 degrees
different than yours.

342
00:44:36,616 --> 00:44:39,050
- Different?
- Yeah.

343
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:42,349
- She had a very Bryn Mawr walk.
- Bryn Mawr?

344
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:44,390
Yeah, very Bryn Mawr.

345
00:44:44,457 --> 00:44:46,391
What do you mean, "Bryn Mawr"?

346
00:44:46,459 --> 00:44:48,654
Bryn Mawr?
That's kind of a walk.

347
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,458
It's... Well, it's...

348
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,226
It's... I don't...

349
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:59,430
Just walk, and I'll...
Just go ahead and walk upstairs.

350
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,713
No, that's an Italian walk.

351
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:16,311
What do you expect?

352
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:19,688
It's a good walk, but it's
just not a Bryn Mawr walk.

353
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:24,224
A Bryn Mawr walk
is a kind of a glide, you know?

354
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:28,861
Those girls used to wear long polo coats
in those old days, long raincoats.

355
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,960
They kind of glide,
like they're late for class.

356
00:45:31,037 --> 00:45:33,528
They move fast
and just kinda glide.

357
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,006
This time now, just glide.
I'll talk you through it, okay?

358
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:39,044
- All right.
- Don't sashay so much. Just glide.

359
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,340
- All right.
- Go ahead.

360
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:43,147
Just glide.

361
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:47,277
No, not like a model.
Just glide.

362
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:49,514
That's it. That's it.

363
00:45:53,593 --> 00:45:55,527
She called me Mike.

364
00:45:58,598 --> 00:46:00,031
Mike?

365
00:46:09,876 --> 00:46:13,312
Listen, I am a good Catholic girl.

366
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,006
I obey everything the pope says.

367
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:16,742
You know?

368
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,841
What would the pope say
if I saw you tomorrow?

369
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:21,682
You forget I have a job to do.

370
00:46:22,522 --> 00:46:24,251
Tomorrow night.

371
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:27,487
Let's wait a couple of days,
all right?

372
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,028
Saturday.
I'm free all day Saturday.

373
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:34,894
- What time?
- Oh, 11:00?

374
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:37,435
I'll be here.

375
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,936
All right.

376
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:44,909
Good night.

377
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,370
Move to your right.

378
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:23,748
All right, come closer now.
Come closer.

379
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:29,418
A little closer.

380
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:00,250
What is that, a love sonnet
from an Italian boyfriend?

381
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,480
No, it isn't. Jealous.

382
00:48:02,555 --> 00:48:04,648
That's Dante.

383
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:06,214
"While life endures...

384
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:10,228
you should not ever
be inconstant to your lady...

385
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:12,730
who in death doth lie.

386
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,168
So speaks my heart
and afterwards doth sigh."

387
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:21,171
You know, as a child...

388
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,174
I used to go to the church...

389
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:26,473
where Dante came
to watch Beatrice.

390
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:30,983
Beatrice, la bella donna,
would sit here...

391
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,984
with her father...

392
00:48:33,052 --> 00:48:34,986
and there...

393
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:36,214
Come here.

394
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,223
- Over there.
- I'm her father.

395
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,057
The young Dante, 23 years old...

396
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,223
would stand and watch Beatrice.

397
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:48,799
And here...

398
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,831
in between...

399
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:53,838
sat the Lady of the Screen...

400
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:56,598
a lady Dante pretended to love...

401
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:59,577
so that Beatrice
would not be embarrassed...

402
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,546
by his continual gaze.

403
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:14,082
You still love Elizabeth,
don't you?

404
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,254
That's why you want me.

405
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:27,537
How did she die?

406
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,810
I killed her.

407
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:06,976
I'm sorry, but I must go
to the hospital right away.

408
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,980
- My mother's very ill.
- I'll go with you.

409
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,573
- It's not your problem. I go alone.
- Please.

410
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:13,983
All right.
Well, let's hurry then.

411
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,612
Mama.

412
00:50:57,496 --> 00:50:58,827
Come closer.

413
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:02,333
I can't see you.

414
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,233
You love my Sandra?

415
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:09,569
Oh, Mama.

416
00:51:09,642 --> 00:51:11,576
I must know now.

417
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,047
Good.

418
00:51:19,018 --> 00:51:20,144
You love him?

419
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,084
I don't know.

420
00:51:24,256 --> 00:51:26,019
He marry you.

421
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:30,851
You'll have to forgive my mother.
She's always been a matchmaker.

422
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,257
You rich?

423
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:38,931
You gangster?

424
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,867
You marry him.

425
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:47,242
Mama, we hardly know each other.

426
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,339
You get to know him...

427
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:52,350
after you're married.

428
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,953
No matter how many times I read it,
it still says the same thing.

429
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:10,052
Look at that.

430
00:53:10,129 --> 00:53:12,825
"Hold St. Louis Cathedral for May 2.

431
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,833
Break out the champagne.

432
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,997
I'm returning Tuesday the 19th
for a church weddin'.

433
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,040
Love, Michael."

434
00:53:22,108 --> 00:53:24,042
Poor Court.

435
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,408
He's a goner now.

436
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:28,640
I tell you, Jane.

437
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:32,343
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't have believed it.

438
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,411
It was like Elizabeth
had stepped out of her tomb.

439
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,886
Yeah, well, you'll see
soon enough for yourself.

440
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,428
- Do you think she's a gold digger?
- I don't know what to think.

441
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:45,760
Maybe we should call Dr. Ellman.

442
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,197
- What good would he do?
- He's been treating Court for years.

443
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:52,203
But Ellman lives in 1975.

444
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,705
Michael lives in 1959.

445
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:44,680
- Mr. Michael!
- Judy.

446
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,877
Good to see you too.

447
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:48,943
I want you to meet Sandra.

448
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:53,384
Sandra, this is Judy,
a lifelong member of this house.

449
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:55,552
Hello, Miss Sandra.

450
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:57,892
Mr. Michael wrote me about you.

451
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,067
- Let me help you with this.
- Thank you.

452
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:37,194
It's beautiful here.

453
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:11,199
Now, this D'Annunzio-Florence deal
is lookin' awful good, Court.

454
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:15,070
Looks like the old goat is finally
gonna invest some big money with us.

455
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,768
Now, I've got a preliminary
breakdown here...

456
00:57:17,843 --> 00:57:20,505
of the basic estimated
development cost and cash flow...

457
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:23,047
for the joint venture proposal.

458
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:25,675
I'd like you to look those over
if you would.

459
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,551
You wouldn't file
an in personam suit against me...

460
00:57:32,624 --> 00:57:35,491
if I asked you to table all this
for a while, would ya?

461
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:38,530
I mean, with the wedding plans
and everything, I'm just not up to it.

462
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:41,361
- Would you mind, for a while?
- Can do, Court.

463
00:57:41,433 --> 00:57:43,993
Can do. That's what
a partner's for, I guess.

464
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:48,435
Well, our friends are certainly
looking forward to meetin' Sandra.

465
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,168
They'll all meet her
on the big day.

466
00:57:51,243 --> 00:57:53,939
Big day of the big wedding.

467
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:56,607
Big day of my new life.

468
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,207
How do you say in Italian?

469
00:57:59,284 --> 00:58:01,946
"La vita nuova."

470
00:58:06,558 --> 00:58:08,253
Look, Court...

471
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:10,261
I know this is
none of my business...

472
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:13,492
but don't you think maybe
this is all a little hasty?

473
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:15,499
A little premature?

474
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:20,864
You're right.
It's none of your business.

475
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,683
Yes, Miss Sandra?

476
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,921
There's a locked room upstairs.

477
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,089
What is it?

478
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,697
It was the master bedroom.

479
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:30,394
Why is it locked?

480
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:34,972
I don't know, Miss Sandra.
I don't clean it anymore.

481
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:39,871
I want to see it.
Can you open it for me?

482
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:44,341
I don't have the key.
Mr. Michael keeps it.

483
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,849
Where?

484
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,215
Well, I guess it's all right.
He keeps it in his desk.

485
01:02:02,828 --> 01:02:05,922
"February 14, 1952.

486
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:09,627
I think the days in Florence...

487
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:13,034
will be the happiest
I will ever have.

488
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,369
New Orleans is a nice town...

489
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,034
and Mike is very good to me...

490
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:21,102
but it is all so different now.

491
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:23,773
He is busy at work all day...

492
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:29,549
and sometimes I wonder if Mike loves me
as much as his business."

493
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:46,994
There it is, darling.

494
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,465
Isn't it beautiful?

495
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,626
And on the 19th...

496
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,970
it'll be all ours.

497
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,973
It's so big.

498
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:01,737
And Mike, 200 guests.
That's a lot of people.

499
01:04:02,814 --> 01:04:04,941
Just a small ceremony
would be fine.

500
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:09,013
No, it's more than a ceremony.

501
01:04:09,087 --> 01:04:11,146
It's a celebration...

502
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,657
and there should be thousands...

503
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,785
and everything's got to be...

504
01:04:16,862 --> 01:04:18,454
very special.

505
01:04:21,266 --> 01:04:23,666
Yes. If you say so.

506
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:35,807
Good morning, Robert.

507
01:04:35,881 --> 01:04:39,146
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good morning, Jane, Shirley.

508
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,159
What are you doing here, Doc?

509
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:52,219
This was the only way I had
to get in touch with you.

510
01:04:52,297 --> 01:04:55,494
You're a hard man to get a hold of.

511
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,194
What can I do for you?

512
01:04:57,269 --> 01:05:00,727
I thought we might just sit down
for a while and have a personal talk.

513
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:02,740
Purely a social visit.

514
01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:07,444
Why is it psychiatrists
are such lousy liars?

515
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,186
Would you come in here, please?

516
01:05:25,864 --> 01:05:28,230
Did you all ask Dr. Ellman up here?

517
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,961
He called to find out how you were.

518
01:05:30,035 --> 01:05:33,562
We thought you might wanna
be talkin' to somebody.

519
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,572
That's fine. Thank you.

520
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:42,369
Michael, why don't you
talk to Charlie?

521
01:05:42,447 --> 01:05:44,711
- That's fine.
- It's for your own good.

522
01:05:50,922 --> 01:05:55,086
I went by and saw Sandra yesterday.
I didn't think you'd mind.

523
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,424
You didn't think I'd mind?

524
01:05:59,064 --> 01:06:01,999
You invade my privacy
and you ask if I'd mind?

525
01:06:02,067 --> 01:06:05,161
Will you listen to yourself?
Stop and listen to what you're saying.

526
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:08,638
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- I know exactly what I'm doing.

527
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,443
I don't want anybody
interfering with my private life.

528
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,914
You're talking with somebody
who already knows you...

529
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:27,720
knows you better probably
than anybody else.

530
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,192
Sandra and I talked about
a lot of things yesterday.

531
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:36,757
I don't think
you're being fair with her.

532
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:38,894
You shouldn't marry out
of a sense of guilt...

533
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:43,339
or out of some morbid preoccupation
with Elizabeth.

534
01:06:43,408 --> 01:06:46,377
And now Sandra is obsessed
with the idea of Elizabeth.

535
01:06:46,444 --> 01:06:49,436
That's all she wanted
to know about yesterday.

536
01:06:49,514 --> 01:06:52,506
She's caught up in your fantasy.
You must know what's happening.

537
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:55,115
Give yourself some time.

538
01:06:55,186 --> 01:06:58,644
Let your relationship
with Sandra grow first.

539
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:02,557
And I want you back in therapy.
If not with me, with some other doctor.

540
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:06,353
But give yourself some time.

541
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,363
Right.

542
01:07:11,503 --> 01:07:13,437
Except you got it wrong.

543
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:16,773
We'll talk about it...

544
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:19,201
after lunch.

545
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:22,576
Good.
We'll work everything out.

546
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:25,878
Just come on down to my office and...

547
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:29,910
I just don't want you to do anything
impulsively that you'll regret.

548
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:33,890
Bye-bye.

549
01:10:06,611 --> 01:10:08,203
What's happening?

550
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:19,785
- Why are you home?
- Because you're here.

551
01:10:19,858 --> 01:10:21,849
Because my heart's here.

552
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,087
Because I never want to leave.

553
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:38,766
Where are you?
We've been so worried.

554
01:10:40,678 --> 01:10:43,545
Look, we're both
really sorry about that.

555
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:46,140
We didn't mean it.
We only thought you...

556
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:50,220
Okay, he's here.
Just a minute.

557
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,279
It's Michael.

558
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:54,416
Michael, old boy, where are ya?

559
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,164
Well, now, don't you think it's...

560
01:11:03,001 --> 01:11:05,196
Now, don't be hasty.

561
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:09,771
Okay, if that's what you want.

562
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,572
He wants us to put his share
of the company into a trust fund.

563
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:18,707
- He's already sent the papers.
- Where is he?

564
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,375
Who knows?

565
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,585
- Tomorrow.
- What?

566
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:33,290
Let's get married tomorrow.

567
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:36,697
We can have the justice of the peace
perform the ceremony right here.

568
01:11:36,768 --> 01:11:39,259
- Why tomorrow?
- I don't wanna wait.

569
01:11:41,072 --> 01:11:44,564
What about St. Louis Cathedral
and all your friends?

570
01:11:44,642 --> 01:11:48,669
We can have it cancelled.
Besides, I don't have any friends.

571
01:11:48,746 --> 01:11:51,681
I found that out today.
Would you be disappointed?

572
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:55,778
Well, no, not at all.

573
01:12:07,131 --> 01:12:09,793
And now, in accordance with
the powers invested in me...

574
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:12,200
by the state of Louisiana...

575
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,535
I now pronounce you man and wife.

576
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:37,487
I've waited so long.

577
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:08,885
Now...

578
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:11,748
I am your wife.

579
01:14:16,194 --> 01:14:18,219
I am Elizabeth.

580
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,896
I came back for one reason, Mike.

581
01:14:27,538 --> 01:14:29,369
I came...

582
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,932
to give you a second chance
to prove your love.

583
01:14:35,546 --> 01:14:37,912
I've always loved you.

584
01:14:38,449 --> 01:14:41,009
Never leave me alone.

585
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:44,452
I want to be with you always.

586
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:50,089
Always.

587
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,964
I am happy now.

588
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:03,458
Now I am your wife.

589
01:16:03,534 --> 01:16:05,468
I am Elizabeth.

590
01:16:09,407 --> 01:16:12,205
I came to give you a second chance.

591
01:17:20,311 --> 01:17:23,303
I'm sorry to call you so early.
Something's come up.

592
01:17:23,381 --> 01:17:27,078
You've gotta go to the bank with me now.
We've gotta get $500,000.

593
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:29,085
- Don't ask me...
- What are you talking about?

594
01:17:29,153 --> 01:17:32,247
- I'll tell you part in the car.
- What's this money gonna be used for?

595
01:17:32,323 --> 01:17:34,917
What's your collateral? Am I loaning,
investing or just giving it to you?

596
01:17:34,992 --> 01:17:37,790
It's a second chance for me.
You don't understand, but...

597
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,956
- You wanna come inside?
- No, I don't!

598
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:43,125
- You're under incredible strain.
- I know I am!

599
01:17:43,201 --> 01:17:46,500
- You should talk to Dr. Ellman.
- The hell with Dr. Ellman! Please hurry.

600
01:17:46,571 --> 01:17:49,699
- Why do you want to go to the bank?
- I wanna get $500,000.

601
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:52,299
- You don't have that kind of cash.
- I've got some money.

602
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,936
- Have you seen our books lately?
- We've got land.

603
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:57,344
We've got the Pontchartrain property.
We've got other property.

604
01:17:57,415 --> 01:17:59,349
- And you wanna give me half?
- I'll give you anything!

605
01:17:59,417 --> 01:18:02,079
It's only for a short while.
Please come.

606
01:18:02,153 --> 01:18:05,213
If that's what you want, I'll do it.
We'll get the papers, and you sign.

607
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:07,780
- You can act crazy, I don't have to.
- Anything!

608
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:11,123
I'll take that land to protect it from
you. I gotta look after the company.

609
01:18:11,195 --> 01:18:14,255
- All right! I'll wait in the car.
- I'll just get dressed.

610
01:18:22,506 --> 01:18:24,997
You're gonna have to sign
these papers.

611
01:18:35,386 --> 01:18:36,819
Right there.

612
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,007
Old Court.

613
01:20:40,244 --> 01:20:43,407
Just can't come up
with the money...

614
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:45,949
not for Elizabeth
and not for you.

615
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,665
Mommy.

616
01:21:15,012 --> 01:21:17,879
Look at this. This is what
your old man thinks you're worth.

617
01:21:17,948 --> 01:21:20,314
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

618
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,716
Mommy! Mommy!

619
01:21:22,787 --> 01:21:26,086
Cut those ropes and let's leave.
Break that window open!

620
01:21:39,537 --> 01:21:42,665
Don't shoot unless
you want the kid to get it!

621
01:21:54,852 --> 01:21:58,618
It looks like your daddy
doesn't think you're worth a dime.

622
01:21:58,689 --> 01:22:00,987
I'm sure your Uncle Bob will.

623
01:23:05,489 --> 01:23:05,656
I don't want this.
I don't want any part of it.

624
01:23:05,656 --> 01:23:07,954
I don't want this.
I don't want any part of it.

625
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:11,392
$50,000 is a lot of money
to turn down, darling.

626
01:23:11,462 --> 01:23:14,488
- You keep it. You earned it.
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.

627
01:23:14,565 --> 01:23:18,194
It was a dirty business from the start
and you knew it.

628
01:23:18,269 --> 01:23:20,203
I told you Court would either
give up the land...

629
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:22,364
or be declared mentally incompetent
to manage it.

630
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:27,206
And you agreed. So don't start getting
an attack of conscience now.

631
01:23:27,278 --> 01:23:29,439
At least you kept him out of bed.
Look at it that way.

632
01:23:29,513 --> 01:23:32,676
Do you realize what I've done?

633
01:23:34,318 --> 01:23:37,344
I wanna go back to him.
I wanna confess everything.

634
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:39,355
I wanna beg him to forgive me.

635
01:23:39,423 --> 01:23:42,290
Look. You hold on.

636
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,827
Just keep your head a minute.

637
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:48,228
We just swindled a man
out of millions.

638
01:23:48,299 --> 01:23:50,324
Now, the law isn't exactly gonna
look lightly on that...

639
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:52,631
if you go back to Michael
and confess.

640
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:58,508
You made a dirty deal with me
and you executed it flawlessly.

641
01:23:58,576 --> 01:24:01,511
You're the best investment
I ever made.

642
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:06,312
Old Court fell for your Elizabeth act
hook, line and sinker.

643
01:24:06,383 --> 01:24:09,045
So now I think you're entitled
to the due wages of sin.

644
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:11,053
You don't understand!

645
01:24:15,225 --> 01:24:17,159
What am I gonna do now?

646
01:24:18,329 --> 01:24:20,797
It's a little late for
existential questions, darling.

647
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,458
You just take the money. Believe you me,
it'll help you to forget.

648
01:24:23,534 --> 01:24:25,468
What am I gonna do?

649
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:27,867
- I can't take it.
- Come on!

650
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,043
Look! Move!

651
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:41,308
Hurry up!

652
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:47,048
Have you got the money?

653
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:55,362
- This isn't enough.
- It's all for you.

654
01:24:55,432 --> 01:24:57,161
What about the others?

655
01:24:57,234 --> 01:24:59,828
- They're all dead.
- Christ!

656
01:25:00,871 --> 01:25:03,431
Smart business deal
this turned out to be.

657
01:25:03,507 --> 01:25:05,907
Courtland surprised all of us!

658
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:07,910
So just take the money
and get out of here!

659
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:09,377
Uncle Bob.

660
01:25:10,514 --> 01:25:12,004
Where's Mommy?

661
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:19,148
She's dead, honey.

662
01:25:21,525 --> 01:25:24,119
Your daddy didn't pay the men...

663
01:25:24,194 --> 01:25:26,059
and they killed her.

664
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,031
You see. I gave the man the money.

665
01:25:30,067 --> 01:25:32,365
I'm taking care of you now.

666
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,662
Now, you're gonna go with him...

667
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:39,539
on the plane to a faraway place where
I've got friends you can live with.

668
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:43,376
Now, I'll be there in about a week
to see if everything's okay.

669
01:25:44,715 --> 01:25:45,909
But where's Daddy?

670
01:25:47,384 --> 01:25:49,784
He don't want you anymore, honey.

671
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,116
Now you go with the man.

672
01:25:53,123 --> 01:25:54,613
- Go on!
- No!

673
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:56,626
- Go with him!
- Uncle Bob, no!

674
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,286
Go with the man!

675
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:01,921
Uncle Bob!

676
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,109
Father, I do not ask forgiveness.

677
01:26:53,183 --> 01:26:55,947
I know there can be none.

678
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:58,817
I was never killed with Mother.

679
01:26:58,889 --> 01:27:02,086
I was ransomed by La Salle
and brought to Florence...

680
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,855
where I lived with Mrs. Portinari.

681
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:08,557
I was raised believing
you killed Mother.

682
01:27:08,632 --> 01:27:12,728
I hated you. I lived for the day
when I could revenge her.

683
01:27:13,337 --> 01:27:16,534
Then La Salle came to me with his plan
to swindle the land from you...

684
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,541
and I got my chance.

685
01:27:27,217 --> 01:27:29,981
But you were not like he said.

686
01:27:30,053 --> 01:27:31,987
I never thought I would...

687
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,621
Iove you.

688
01:28:42,893 --> 01:28:45,760
Ladies and gentlemen, we are sorry
to disturb you at this time...

689
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:48,889
but we have just encountered
some unexpected turbulence.

690
01:28:48,966 --> 01:28:52,595
Would you please return to your seats
immediately and...

691
01:28:58,842 --> 01:28:59,934
Excuse me.

692
01:29:07,517 --> 01:29:10,611
It wasn't there.
The money wasn't there.

693
01:29:10,687 --> 01:29:12,416
It wasn't there.

694
01:29:13,257 --> 01:29:15,418
You got me out of bed...

695
01:29:15,492 --> 01:29:19,326
forced me to give you $500,000.

696
01:29:19,396 --> 01:29:21,330
You were actin' crazy.

697
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:25,927
Of course the money wasn't there.
I had to protect it from you.

698
01:29:28,038 --> 01:29:29,972
I have the real money.

699
01:29:31,775 --> 01:29:33,436
I was only lookin' after
your own good.

700
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,113
It's all yours now.

701
01:29:38,181 --> 01:29:40,945
And this will surely keep you
from throwin' it away.

702
01:29:50,527 --> 01:29:52,119
I killed her.

703
01:29:55,299 --> 01:29:58,735
She came back a second time...

704
01:29:58,802 --> 01:30:01,202
to let me prove I loved her...

705
01:30:05,742 --> 01:30:07,334
and I killed her.

706
01:30:15,485 --> 01:30:16,918
Now she's gone.

707
01:30:19,556 --> 01:30:22,320
You just can't seem
to keep a woman, can you?

708
01:30:24,227 --> 01:30:27,253
You self-righteous son of a bitch!

709
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,599
What did you think
you were anyway?

710
01:30:31,668 --> 01:30:33,761
Steppin' on anybody you wanted to...

711
01:30:34,738 --> 01:30:38,504
tellin' people what to do
and when to do it.

712
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:42,077
Sittin' on your ass...

713
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:44,875
while a fortune slipped
through our fingers!

714
01:30:45,949 --> 01:30:48,213
Do you know how rich
we could have been?

715
01:30:51,221 --> 01:30:53,155
But you don't care
about money, do ya?

716
01:30:53,223 --> 01:30:54,451
You never did.

717
01:30:55,359 --> 01:30:59,318
You just threw away millions this
mornin' for that lyin' little bitch.

718
01:31:06,236 --> 01:31:07,828
Go ahead and kill me!

719
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:11,530
You gonna kill her too?

720
01:31:11,608 --> 01:31:14,577
She was in it with me, you fool!

721
01:31:15,712 --> 01:31:17,976
She was in it from the start.

722
01:31:37,434 --> 01:31:38,958
She's goin' to Rome...

723
01:31:43,807 --> 01:31:46,742
with $50,000 of yours.

724
01:31:57,988 --> 01:32:00,718
You didn't just throw away
a fortune.

725
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,660
You just threw away
your whole life.

726
01:33:20,704 --> 01:33:23,264
TWA flight 702 to London...

727
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,638
scheduled for departure at 10:30.

728
01:33:25,709 --> 01:33:28,269
Passengers now boarding at gate 16.

729
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:33,578
When's the next flight to Rome?

730
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:37,108
Rome... Tomorrow evening, 8:00 p.m.

731
01:33:37,187 --> 01:33:39,121
You wanna make a reservation?

732
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:43,957
Would that be first class
or coach, sir?

733
01:33:45,262 --> 01:33:46,889
First class.

734
01:33:46,963 --> 01:33:48,294
Excuse me a minute.

735
01:33:59,976 --> 01:34:01,409
All right.

736
01:34:02,812 --> 01:34:04,780
Sir, you are in luck.

737
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:07,715
Our 8:00 flight from Rome
has just returned...

738
01:34:07,784 --> 01:34:09,718
to check out an engine malfunction.

739
01:34:09,786 --> 01:34:11,845
Now, the problem appears
to be cleared up...

740
01:34:11,922 --> 01:34:16,985
and the flight is rescheduled
to take off at 11:00 p.m. From gate 36.

741
01:34:18,061 --> 01:34:19,995
If you want me to fix this for you...

742
01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:38,163
Daddy!

743
01:36:38,234 --> 01:36:40,395
You came with the money!

744
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:41,903
Daddy!

745
01:36:49,779 --> 01:36:51,212
Amy?

746
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:03,725
Daddy.
