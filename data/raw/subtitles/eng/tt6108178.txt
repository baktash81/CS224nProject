RAV: In the beginning,

2
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,396
Hashem made
three types of creatures,

3
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,189
the angels,

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,155
the beasts,

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,476
and the human beings.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,596
The angels, He made
from His pure word.

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
The angels have
no will to do evil.

8
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,079
They cannot deviate for one
moment from His purpose.

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,432
The beasts have only their
instincts to guide them.

10
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,349
They, too,
follow the commands of their maker.

11
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,995
The Torah states

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,080
that Hashem spent almost
six whole days of creation

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,992
fashioning these creatures.

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,312
Then, just before sunset,

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,156
He took a small
quantity of earth

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,793
and from it He fashioned
man and woman.

17
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,560
An afterthought?

18
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,036
Or His crowning achievement?

19
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,954
So, what is this thing?

20
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,190
Man?

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,190
Woman?

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,037
It is a being with
the power to disobey.

of the angels

27
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,878
and the desires
of the beasts.

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,990
Hashem gave us choice,
which is both a privilege and a burden.

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,151

at her presence.

Ronit is grieving.

742
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,913
And we will make her
very welcome at the Hesped.

743

say something?
