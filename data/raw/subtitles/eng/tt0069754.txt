1
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,113
(Whistling)

2
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,594
- Hi, there.
- Hi. Is this the Wadsworth House?

3
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,194
- Mm-hm.
- Thank you.

4
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,593
(Doorbell)

5
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,674
Can I help you?

6
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,359
Mrs. Wadsworth?

7
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,511
Oh, you're from Welfare?

8
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,397
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

9
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,397
- What you say your name was?
- Mrs. Gentry, Ann.

10
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,113
- Go right in.
- Thank you.

11
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,636
It was nice of you to call first.
Most of you workers just pop in.

12
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,109
Please sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

13
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,113
This is just a routine visit,
Mrs. Wadsworth.

14
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,389
But I'm sure you're an old hand
at this sort of thing.

15
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,080
You might say so, after all these years.

16
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,150
Let's see... When was the last time
you saw a worker'?

17
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,798
Oh, about six months ago.

18
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,709
We usually see one of you county people
about twice a year.

19
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,353
Well, you know, er...

20
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,150
a worker will be glad to come more often,
if there's a need for it.

21
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,590
We're a very self-sufficient family.

22
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,432
Are you going to be Baby's new worker?

23
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,471
I don't mind telling you, Mrs. Wadsworth,

24
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,718
I... I made a special effort
to get this assignment.

25
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,550
You did? Now, why is that?

26
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,871
Well, I heard about the case
from one of the other workers,

27
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,954
and it was impossible
not to be interested.

28
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,279
I see.

29
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,792
What is the composition
of the family now?

30
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,150
Same as before.
No changes to speak of.

31
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,636
In other words -
you, your two daughters and your son?

32
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,870
Baby, mm-hm. We've been living
in this house ever since he was born.

33
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,469
I notice you call him Baby,

34
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,194
and the case history
doesn't show any other name-.

35
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,751
- What is his real name?
- (Woman) Just Baby.

36
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,720
- I'm Germaine.
- My daughter. This is Mrs. Gentry, honey.

37
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,558
She's going to be Baby's new worker.

38
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,034
Nice to meet you.

39
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,556
- Now, what about the family income?
- Just what the county gives us for Baby.

40
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,235
Your daughters, are they employed?

41
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,115
Uh, my daughters?

42
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,835
No. They help out the best they can,
but it doesn't come to too much.

43
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,918
Alba gives tennis lessons
in the afternoon, and Germaine...

44
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,475
Once in a while, I do a TV commercial.

45
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,796
Sometimes, I don't know
how we make ends meet,

46
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,399
but we always seem to manage.

47
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,273
Isn't there any money
from your husband's pension?

48
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,279
- Or his Social Security?
- Well, how could there be?

49
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,835
(Giggles) She thinks he's dead.

50
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,955
(Laughing heartily) That man didn't die!

51
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,071
No such luck!

52
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,476
It happened just before Baby was born.

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,114
When I needed him most,
he ran off and left us.

54
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,756
- But then, all that's in the record.
- Oh, I'm sure it is.

55
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,313
My husband was a very weak man,
Mrs. Gentry.

56
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,319
- No character.
- None at all.

57
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,430
And you've had no contact with him
since he left?

58
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,074
As far as I'm concerned,
he might as well be dead.

59
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,714
I understand how you feel,
Mrs. Wadsworth.

60
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,037
Well, like all things,
some good came out of it.

61
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,751
We got used to being without a man.

62
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,760
- I'd like to see Baby before I leave.
- (Germaine) Do you have to?

63
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,593
Well, yes. I see all my clients.

64
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,472
Why? ls there any reason I shouldn't?

65
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,719
No, of course not.

66
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
It's just that Baby's taking
his afternoon nap.

67
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,039
Unless you think ifs important.

68
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,390
(Ann) Oh, I'll be careful not to wake him.

69
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,311
Besides, I'm sure you know

70
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,593
that it's one of the basic requirements
of my job that I see everyone.

71
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,155
Of course. As his new worker,
you should see him.

72
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,719
Don't you think so, Germaine?

73
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,310
Nursery is this way.

74
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,793
(Mrs. Wadsworth) He gets the best care
in all the world. We all see to that.

75
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,911
(Germaine talking sweetly to Baby)

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,792
Mm, chocolate!

77
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,837
(Kicking table)

78
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,999
Mind if I feed him?

79
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,434
(Baby grizzles)

80
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,960
Hi, Baby. Are you hungry?

81
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
Now, open up. Whoopsie!

82
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,437
Are you hungry?

83
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,473
Are you hungry? Yes! Come on...

84
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,950
(Ann) You do this everyday,
Mrs. Wadsworth?

85
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,072
Have to, or the muscles will go bad.

86
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,955
His legs seem perfectly normal.
I'm surprised he doesn't walk.

87
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,153
You must have, er, quite a few clients,
Mrs. Gentry.

88
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,199
Seems like Baby's one of your favorites.

89
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,118
What gives you that idea?

90
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,750
Well, this is your third time here
in a week.

91
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,551
I guess you're right.

92
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,876
He is of special interest to me.

93
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,870
But then, he's a pretty special baby.

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,230
(Phone rings)

95
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,397
(Typewriters clattering)

96
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,352
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Foley?
- Yes, I did.

97
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,869
- Oh, please sit down, Ann.
- Thank you.

98
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,876
Oh, I see you've been reading
my Baby file.

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,310
Under the circumstances,
I thought it would be best.

100
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,590
What circumstances?

101
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,553
Ann, I've been going through your reports
for the past few weeks.

102
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,672
You're not spending nearly enough time
with your emergency cases.

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,873
You've been devoting yourself almost
exclusively to this Wadsworth baby.

104
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,236
Well, maybe I have,
but with very good reason.

105
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,877
Ann, I'm not telling you to drop it.
Just ease off.

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,513
Compromise.

107
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,395
Mr. Foley,
this case is full of compromise.

108
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,233
And indifference.

109
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,192
And criminal negligence.

110
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,789
And we're responsible!

111
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,593
Ann, you exaggerate.

112
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,711
Other workers have put time in
on this case,

113
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,354
and they've come up
with no significant results.

114
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,474
None of those other workers spent enough
time on the case to accomplish anything.

115
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,591
- <i>That's not</i> true! <i>One did...</i>
- <i>Yes, one did.</i>

116
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,714
And just when she was beginning
to make progress, she disappeared.

117
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,753
- People drop out of sight. It happens.
- Not very often.

118
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,434
Well, the police looked into it.
They were satisfied.

119
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,792
But I'm not.

120
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,190
- (Ann laughing)
- (Germaine) Don't let him go too high.

121
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,518
- He might fall out and get hurt.
- You're having a ball, aren't you?

122
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,029
- (Baby laughing)
- Yeah! Well, I am, too.

123
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,073
You know, he seems so intelligent,
Germaine, so alert.

124
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,400
Maybe, but when you've been
around him some more,

125
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,875
you'll realize how limited he is.

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,559
You think so?

127
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,836
- I ought to know.
- Ooh!

128
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,520
I have to clean up after him.

129
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,995
Hey! That was fun, wasn't it?

130
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,909
Let's play another game. I know what.
Let's play with the ball.

131
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,838
Let's play with the ball, yeah.

132
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,271
The ball, yeah! That'll be fun!
Uh-huh? OK.

133
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,357
Get ready. Get ready.

134
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,120
Get ready to catch it.
I'm gonna throw it!

135
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,117
There it goes!

136
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,277
Well, that's a good job!

137
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,313
That's good! That was good! Good boy!

138
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,471
You caught it, didn't you?

139
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,558
Hey, let's try something else. OK?

140
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,830
I'm going to roll the ball...

141
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,837
and I want you to gel it!

142
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,954
That's the way!
He's a good Baby! He knows!

143
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,918
Now bring it back to Ann!

144
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,589
He's so smart.
Come on, bring it back to Ann. Please?

145
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,509
Go on! Bring it to me, please! Please.

146
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,994
Bring it to Ann!

147
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,316
Oh, yes! That's a good Baby!

148
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,590
He's such a sweet baby!

149
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,956
Oh...

150
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,594
- Oh, he's a smart baby.
- What's going on?

151
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,032
Oh, I've just been playing
with your brother.

152
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,710
You know, some of his responses
are really surprising.

153
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,990
Any kid a couple of years old can do that,
but he can't do any more.

154
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,997
Well, I'm not so sure.

155
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,033
Alba, isn't it time for Baby's nap?

156
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,271
Mm-hm. I'd better take him inside.

157
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,311
- Come on, you.
- (Baby protests)

158
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,556
(He grizzles)

159
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,075
- He likes you.
- Well, sure.

160
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,520
I like <i>him.</i>

161
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,075
I know somebody
who's not going to like it, not any of it.

162
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,271
Now, come on, let's get inside.

163
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,835
I'm getting sick
of this moth-eaten old thing!

164
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,349
- Come on!
- (Baby crying)

165
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,274
Does she mean your mother?

166
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,311
Pay no attention to Alba.

167
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,393
She's always saying dumb things like that.

168
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,032
Now, I'm sure you have other clients to see.
I'll walk you to your car.

169
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,034
Thank you.

170
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,080
You dress so beautifully, Ann.

171
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,350
How do you do it
on a social worker's salary?

172
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Easy. By spending my whole salary!

173
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,999
Of course, you have a husband
lo pay all the other bills.

174
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,157
Your husband, tell me, what does he do?

175
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,477
Uh... Roger was an architect.

176
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,599
He, uh... He created some
of the finest buildings in the city.

177
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,154
Did you say "was"?

178
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,798
Ann?

179
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,229
Uh... When was the last time
Baby, uh, had an examination?

180
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,394
Why do we have to talk about Baby
all the time?

181
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,352
<i>We dam.</i>

182
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,756
I'd like to find out more about you.

183
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,992
Well, there's really
not much to find out. I, er...

184
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,951
I lead a pretty conventional life.

185
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,469
Let's see, I live in a nice house

186
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,116
with a marvelous husband,

187
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,551
an understanding mother-in-law.
That's about it.

188
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,751
Do you like physical exercise?

189
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,389
Sometimes.

190
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,354
I love to go hiking up in the mountains.
Do you ever do anything like that?

191
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,920
Unfortunately,
I don't have much free time.

192
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,873
Well, maybe on a Saturday
when you're not working.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,231
Oh, I usually spend Saturdays with Roger.

194
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,560
Besides, I don't think
it would be much fun for you.

195
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,433
I mean, you'd probably wind up
having to carry me!

196
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,920
You never know what you're missing
until you try it.

197
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,670
Well, maybe, but I'm a Scorpio -
we're very cautious.

198
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,834
Bye-bye.

199
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,989
Oh, when was the last time
Baby was examined by a psychologist?

200
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,557
A psychological test to determine
his mental range and physical reactions?

201
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,756
We had all those tests when he was a baby.

202
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,190
But he must have had more tests
since then.

203
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,950
No. There didn't seem to be
any reason for it.

204
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,110
Why?

205
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,552
Oh, nothing in particular.
ll was just a thought.

206
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,675
You know, Scorpios really aren't cautious.

207
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,074
Just dangerous.

208
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,630
- Bye-bye.
- (Engine starts)

209
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,069
It's late, Ann.
Don't you think you should go to bed?

210
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,556
Not yet. I want to finish these.

211
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,311
He was so beautiful!

212
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,715
We were so beautiful together.

213
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,869
Why did it have to happen?

214
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,831
I just cannot accept it.

215
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,394
Ann!

216
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,591
I won't let it be this way!

217
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,798
<i>Your son...</i>

218
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,909
Your son was everything to me.

219
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,357
I know.

220
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,478
(Ann) It should have been me.

221
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,069
It should have been! It was my fault.

222
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,070
(Woman) No, Billy, you can't come over.
You know about the freak.

223
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,073
They don't like outsiders coming by.
I'd only get in trouble, and you know it.

224
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,394
Is that all you guys ever think about?

225
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,160
A girl likes to feel
like she's something special.

226
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,918
(Baby crying)

227
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,112
What kind of a question is that?
Of course I'm wearing panties.

228
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,117
Don't I always?

229
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,834
- Oh, cut it out!
- (Baby crying)

230
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,271
Well, I should be off around midnight.

231
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,313
I suppose I could drop by your place
on the way home.

232
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,917
- (Baby screaming)
- Listen, I have to go see about the baby.

233
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,033
Oh, he's not so bad,
once you get used to him.

234
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,312
Yeah, alright!
Just for you, I'll make sure they're off.

235
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,470
Alright! I'm coming!

236
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,796
(Baby wailing)

237
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,116
What's the matter, sweetheart?

238
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,158
Did you have a bad dream? You OK?

239
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,560
Oh, well, you got a wet diaper. No wonder.

240
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,315
OK. We'll feel so much better
in a minute. Yes, we will.

241
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,874
OK.

242
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,395
Let's get rid of this nasty old diaper.

243
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,155
- (Baby gurgling)
- OK? Put some powder on it.

244
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,953
Oh, that'll be so nice.

245
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
OK? There we go.

246
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,356
That feels so much better, doesn't it?
Isn't that nice?

247
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,278
(Gurgles)

248
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,678
Isn't that wonderful?
We like that, don't we?

249
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,795
There.

250
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,639
OK. Goodnight, sweetheart.

251
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,159
Goodnight.

252
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,714
No, no, no, no, Baby. No, no.

253
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,830
Oh, Baby!

254
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,315
No, no, no, no.
It's time to go to sleep.

255
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,954
Come on. Come on, now.
Lay down here.

256
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,350
- Lay down! Come on, now.
- (Baby crying)

257
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,313
What is the matter? What do you want?

258
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,351
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't get out.

259
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,471
Come on, Baby. Alright...

260
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,349
Alright. Alright.
Just for a little while, though, OK?

261
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,630
OK. Come on. Here we go.

262
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,752
OK. That a boy. There we go.

263
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,155
OK.

264
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,992
Baby! No, no, no.

265
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,430
Baby, what are you doing? No.

266
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,029
No, sweetheart.
Come on, let's go play with Teddy.

267
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,992
Come on.
Come on, Baby. Over here.

268
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,793
That's it, Baby.

269
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,718
Right over here, come on.

270
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,471
Oh, Teddy feels so much better!
Isn't he fun?

271
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,353
Oh, I know! Go get him!

272
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,709
Come on.

273
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,072
(Laughing) Go get the Teddy!

274
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,520
(Bang)

275
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,313
(Baby cries)

276
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,750
Oh, sweetie. Let me see!

277
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,793
(Baby sobbing)

278
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,035
Let me see it. Let me see it. Oh!

279
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,714
Oh, sweetheart. Let me kiss it.
We'll make it all better.

280
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,672
Yes, we will.

281
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,838
Are you hungry? Let me get you a bottle.

282
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,030
OK?

283
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,833
No! No, Baby. No.

284
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,758
Baby, no! Don't.

285
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,110
Baby, let me get you a bottle.

286
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,356
Baby! Baby?

287
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,357
Don't, Baby.

288
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,836
(Gently) Baby, don't. Don't. Baby.

289
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,909
Baby. Baby.

290
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,238
(Laughter)

291
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,920
Oh, that's funny!

292
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,875
Oh, why does that babysitter
always have to leave this damn TV on?

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,389
Mama, I ate too many egg rolls!

294
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,797
You're always making
a little piglet out of yourself.

295
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,390
- Where is she?
- Probably upstairs with Baby.

296
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,115
Hey, we came back just in time
not to pay her extra!

297
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,078
What the hell do you think you're doing?

298
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,397
We were just fooling around.
Nothing really happened, honest.

299
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,596
Nothing happened?

300
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,997
With your damn tit in his mouth
and you call that nothing?

301
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,680
- You lying bitch!
- You have to believe me!

302
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,757
We never did anything.

303
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,036
You lying bitch!

304
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,594
(Baby screaming)

305
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,836
You bitch!

306
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,079
Get away from me!

307
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,279
He's a baby
and you had to put your hands on him.

308
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,231
You want kicks?
Well, I'll give you kicks!

309
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
(Babysitter screaming)

310
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,030
Please!

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,278
(Sobbing)

312
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,276
(Baby sobbing)

313
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,470
OK, Mama. Baby's watching this.

314
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,398
Let her go.

315
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,512
Get her out of here before I kill her!

316
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,597
(Babysitter crying)

317
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,950
If you tell anybody about this
we'll press charges.

318
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,634
You were abusing a mental case
and it's a criminal offense.

319
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,592
Do you understand?

320
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,553
(Baby sobbing)

321
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,398
Baby, Baby. Don't cry.

322
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,353
(I Jazz playing on radio)

323
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,793
Hello, Alba.

324
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,351
Is your mother inside?

325
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,279
Off playing bridge again?

326
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,799
Every Tuesday and Thursday,
but I think you know that by now.

327
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,479
(Radio clicks off)

328
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,318
Do you mind if wait for her?

329
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,158
Suit yourself.

330
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,592
Hi! Hi, how are you?

331
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,074
Hey!

332
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,555
Look what I got. See?

333
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,758
It's a tiger. Yeah.

334
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,349
It's a tiger! Yeah!

335
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,039
You like it?

336
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,152
Yeah, yeah, you like it, don't you?

337
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,112
Yeah! (Chuckles)

338
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,269
I don't think you like me very much.

339
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,631
- I don't know you.
- Well, you could get to know me.

340
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,593
Actually, I'm a very easy person to know.

341
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,276
I'd like to be your friend, Alba.

342
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,560
In a way, lhere's more to it than that.

343
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,830
I really need your friendship.

344
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,359
Why?

345
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,430
You know how much
I want to help your brother.

346
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,959
So?

347
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,949
I can't do it without the cooperation
and support of the whole family.

348
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,640
Has anyone been giving you any trouble?

349
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,114
No!

350
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,874
But that's not the same as having
your complete trust and confidence.

351
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,709
Baby was born backwards.
He's been that way all his life.

352
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,310
- That's all there is to it.
- (Baby crying)

353
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,960
Stop that, Baby,
or I'll have to punish you!

354
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,958
- How do you punish him?
- When he's bad, he gets a spanking.

355
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,154
I think he's just hungry.

356
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,032
I know he's hungry.
How dumb do you think I am?

357
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,720
But I have to wait for Mama to get back.

358
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,480
Why don't you get him a bottle?
I'll keep an eye on him.

359
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,479
I'm sure you would,
but I'm not supposed to leave him alone.

360
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,114
Well, he wouldn't be alone. I'd be here.

361
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,593
You did say your mother
was coming home soon.

362
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,518
Mm-hm. You'd better wait.

363
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,792
Mama wants to see you
as much as you want to see her.

364
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,797
(Phone rings)

365
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,354
(Continues ringing)

366
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,799
Aren't you going to answer it?

367
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,839
Guess I'll have to.

368
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
He)', Baby. Hey.

369
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,916
Yes, it must get lonely in there
all by yourself.

370
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,195
I bet you'd like playmate, wouldn't you?
Yes, you would.

371
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,558
Let me be your playmate.

372
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,078
Yes, thank you. Yes!

373
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,759
Let's try something
more grown-up today, OK?

374
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,078
You're a bright fella, anybody can see that.
You wanna try to stand up?

375
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,033
Yeah! Wanna stand up?

376
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,834
Want to try? Give me your hands.

377
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,874
Give me your hands. That's my boy!
That's my boy!

378
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,718
UP We go!

379
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,399
OK, hold on.

380
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,989
Come on. Let's try it. Up.

381
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,149
That's right! That's right!

382
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,357
O0p3!

383
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,996
But that was good! Yeah!
It was fun, wasn't it? Yeah!

384
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,637
Let's try it again.
Let's try it.

385
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,797
You just trust me.
I won't let you fall-.

386
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,196
Let's go. Up! Good!

387
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,631
- That's right. Hold onto me.
- Mrs. Gentry!

388
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,751
Just what do you think you're doing?

389
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,400
Just trying to test his balance
and coordination.

390
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,434
Yeah, well you shouldn't be trying
anything with him. He's much too delicate.

391
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,349
And you had no business
leaving him alone!

392
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,034
Phone rang,
and I thought it might be important.

393
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,632
Nothing's that important.

394
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,709
I didn't mean any harm, Mrs. Wadsworth.

395
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,079
I just want to help Baby
reach his full potential.

396
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,353
Are you sure that's all you want,
Mrs. Gentry?

397
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,993
What more could there be?

398
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,118
(Alba) Baby's happyjust like he is.
He loves being a baby.

399
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,356
Nobody's asking for your opinion,
young lady.

400
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,869
Give me the bottle
and get back in the house.

401
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,672
Let's you and I have a little talk,
woman to woman.

402
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,278
- Do you have any children, Mrs. Gentry?
- No, unfortunately.

403
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,676
Well, I've raised three children,

404
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,758
and believe me, I ought to know
what is best for my own child.

405
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,314
Oh, I'm sure you do.

406
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,439
Mrs. Wadsworth,

407
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,191
if I could convince you that Baby
is capable of growth and development,

408
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,231
you wouldn't stand in his way, would you?

409
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
Of course not. What mother would?

410
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,117
Well, then, I think you should consider

411
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,232
putting Baby into a special clinic
for the retarded.

412
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,592
A clinic? You mean like a hospital?

413
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,149
Oh, no. Not like a hospital.
It's a day clinic.

414
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,160
More like a school, where Baby could be
with other young people like himself.

415
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,354
It's really the best way.

416
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,510
Maybe the only way.

417
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,554
Well, I never thought about it,
but I don't think it would work.

418
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,195
Why not?

419
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,957
A lot of reasons.

420
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,913
It'd put a real hardship on the family.

421
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,680
Besides, I don't drive a car.

422
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,634
But that's no problem!
I could take Baby to the clinic for you.

423
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,635
You mean take him there by yourself?

424
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,912
I'd be happy to. It's part of my job.

425
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,350
<i>No.</i>

426
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,360
Nobody takes my Baby anywhere
without me.

427
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,753
I only thought...

428
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,269
Well, maybe you think too much.

429
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,353
When it comes to Baby,
I do all the thinking.

430
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,160
I see.

431
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,029
Besides, we...

432
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,154
we could never afford
anything like a... a clinic.

433
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,556
But you could, Mrs. Wadsworth.

434
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,469
For someone like yourself,
these places are cost-free.

435
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,513
What about the cost to us
in heartache and disappointment

436
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,119
when it all comes to nothing?

437
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,800
But we still have to try!

438
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,709
Just give your son a chance,
and I know he won't disappoint you.

439
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,515
- Are you that sure of yourself?
- Yes.

440
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,154
Well, I'm willing to keep an open mind.

441
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,750
Show me! Show me why you think
Baby has a chance.

442
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,678
But I'm no therapist.

443
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,475
Well, I'll make allowances for that.
Show me.

444
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,590
Alright.

445
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,433
Baby! Baby!

446
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,599
- Come on. That's a boy. Come on.
- (Baby grizzles)

447
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,109
Yeah, come on!
What do you do with the ball?

448
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,753
You remember the ball!

449
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,878
Now, come on out.
Come on out. That's a boy!

450
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,991
That's a good boy!

451
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,272
<i>Qkey flake. (Some on.
Come an up here.</i>

452
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,313
Yeah! We're gonna play with the ball!
We're gonna play with the ball!

453
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,398
Look at the ball.
I'm gonna throw the ball!

454
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,269
See the ball'? It's fun.
There it goes!

455
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,593
Now, get the ball, Baby.

456
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,356
Go on, you remember!

457
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,030
You remember! It's fun!
It's fun! It's fun!

458
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,390
Get the ball! Get the ball!

459
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,359
That's the way.
Get the ball and bring it back.

460
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,432
Get the ball and bring it back, Baby.

461
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,110
That's the way!
Get the ball and bring it back, Baby.

462
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,958
Baby, bring the ball back!

463
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,113
Bring it back! Baby?

464
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,190
Bring it back! Baby?

465
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,277
You call that progress?

466
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,516
Even a dog can do a trick like that.

467
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,472
That's my failure.

468
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,638
Mrs. Wadsworth, don't make him pay
for my inadequacy.

469
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,189
Well, I'm not making any promises.

470
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,992
But I will think about what you said.

471
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,437
You won't be sorry.

472
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,591
- Bye.
- I'll call you.

473
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,678
Mama!

474
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,473
Damn you!

475
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,959
Get inside!

476
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,640
(Electric jolt, Baby screams)

477
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,149
- Baby doesn't walk!
- (Electric jolt)

478
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,998
And Baby doesn't talk!

479
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,111
And Baby doesn't stand!

480
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,560
Baby doesn't walk!

481
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,593
- (Electric jolt, Baby screams)
- And Baby doesn't talk to strangers!

482
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,236
Alba! You've punished him enough!
If you use this thing on him, you'll cripple him!

483
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,954
- It's better than using a belt, Germaine!
- I ain't used it in two months!

484
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,879
He has to be disciplined or else he'll
do things he shouldn't and hurt himself!

485
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,990
You'll end up killing him.

486
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,350
When he's naughty,
it's the best way to teach him obedience.

487
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,840
Don't kill him!

488
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,510
You know Mama doesn't want him to
stand up and he shouldn't trust strangers!

489
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,393
Baby doesn't stand
and that's what keeps baby safe!

490
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,797
Stop it! He's your brother, not an animal!

491
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,069
Arch!

492
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,629
Maybe that'll teach you some discipline.

493
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,513
Now, just get him in the closet.

494
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,392
Get him in the closet!

495
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,272
Yes, Mama.

496
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,277
(Baby sobbing gently)

497
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,110
(Sobs) Mama!

498
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,996
(Children chattering)

499
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,990
(Children chattering)

500
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,034
(Ann) I hope you had a chance
to look over Baby's file.

501
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,514
(Man) Yes, I have.

502
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,233
(Ann) Ralph, what do you see?

503
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,193
I know you'll agree
with my recommendation.

504
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,470
What's your special interest in this case?

505
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,313
Can you think of anything more horrible
than being buried alive'?

506
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,954
Well, that's what happened
to this client.

507
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,919
He's been imprisoned
by a kind of sick love.

508
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,160
There's a normal, full-grown man -
trapped, with no way out.

509
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,435
There's something here I don't understand.

510
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,631
If he isn't seriously retarded,

511
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,549
then how do you account for the fact
that he can't walk or talk?

512
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,432
Negative reinforcement.

513
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,440
Some kind of consistent punishment
to discourage him from normal learning.

514
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,272
That's a pretty serious charge.

515
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,518
Well, they're a pretty strange family -
especially the mother.

516
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,155
Each child is by a different man,
and all of them abandoned her.

517
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,159
Now, the last one she was married to,
Baby's father,

518
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,238
and I think when he left,
she just never got over it.

519
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,990
So shes taking revenge
on the only male member of the family.

520
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,391
Well, that might be a partial answer,

521
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,478
but there's probably more to it
of a pathological nature.

522
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,915
Ann, if you're convinced
Mrs. Wadsworth is an unfit mother,

523
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,680
you should turn the case over
to the Public Guardian.

524
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,236
I thought of doing that,
but I'm hoping I won't have to.

525
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,839
Suppose it's necessary?

526
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,400
Well, I know enough about them,
more than enough,

527
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,878
but to prove it with solid evidence,
no chance.

528
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,669
I just don't understand it!

529
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,394
They should have been here
over half an hour ago.

530
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,909
- Maybe they misunderstood you?
- No!

531
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,071
I was very precise about the time
and the place.

532
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,231
- May I?
- Of course.

533
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,436
(Phone rings)

534
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,235
Hello?

535
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,718
(Ann) 'Germaine? This is Ann Gentry.
I'm here at the clinic with Dr. Sutton.

536
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,276
- 'Is Baby on the way over?'
- We're not going there today.

537
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,198
Why not?'

538
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,958
Mama changed her mind.

539
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,117
She changed her mind.

540
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,390
Germaine, I'd like to speak
with your mother, please.

541
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,599
She doesn't want to speak to you.

542
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,149
'Have you talked
to your supervisor today?'

543
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,271
No. Why?

544
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,038
Maybe you should.

545
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,638
(Phone cuts off)

546
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,153
Without their cooperation,
there isn't much you can do.

547
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,912
We'll just see about that.

548
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,352
- Mr. Foley, extension 360, please.
- Ann.

549
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,599
I think you should forget this case.

550
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,234
What about Baby?
What's going to happen to him?

551
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,670
- Ann...
- Mr. Foley, this is Ann Gentry.

552
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,599
Germaine Wadsworth suggested
that I call you.

553
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,109
(Muffled voice)

554
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,752
What kind of complaint?

555
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,351
Surely, you don't believe
all that garbage'?

556
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,393
Yes, but...

557
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,315
But...

558
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,793
But Mr. Foley,
can't we at least talk about this?

559
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,072
- 'I'm telling you to drop it.'
- Alright, Mr. Foley.

560
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,637
Ann, I'm beginning to worry about you.

561
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,512
That damn woman!

562
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,758
- That whole damn family!
- Ann, I'd like to know what's happening.

563
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,397
So would I.

564
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,319
(Door shuts)

565
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,632
(Mrs. Wadsworth) Well, what the hell
brings you back here again?

566
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,115
I can understand your surprise,
Mrs. Wadsworth.

567
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,595
After going behind my back
and telling ridiculous lies,

568
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,994
you were expecting someone else-.

569
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,589
You're damn right!
You're not our worker anymore.

570
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,430
I just wanted to face you one more time
to tell you that you're sick.

571
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,870
You're the one who needs help, not Baby.

572
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,356
OK, you said it.
Now, get off my property.

573
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,319
- She causing trouble again, Mama?
- You keep quiet.

574
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,040
Now you, get away from here,

575
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,720
or I'll call the oops
and have them take you away.

576
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,631
I'm going to fight you, Mrs. Wadsworth,
with the only weapon I have - the law,

577
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,876
for the legal custody of Baby.

578
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,516
Now, you just go ahead and try, honey.

579
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,200
There's an agency
that works to protect people.

580
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,473
It's called the Public Guardian Office,
and you will be hearing from them.

581
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,197
- They can't do anything to us.
- They can investigate everything.

582
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,273
Mrs. Wadsworth, do you think your
treatment of Baby can stand up to that?

583
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,596
That's just so much horse shit.

584
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,758
You want him for yourself.

585
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,396
Well, agency or no agency,
you ain't gonna get him.

586
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,075
Cos Baby belongs to us.
No, to me.

587
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,671
He belongs to himself! He's not
the sub-human thing you've made him.

588
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,350
And once I report what I know,
it's just a matter of time

589
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,996
before Baby is taken away
from all of you.

590
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,996
You damn bitch!

591
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,151
I'll be seeing you, Mrs. Wadsworth -
in court.

592
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,717
Judith? I'm home!

593
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,835
- Judith?
- You're late today.

594
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,079
I know.

595
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,792
- Everything go alright here?
- As usual.

596
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,875
Did you have a hard day, dear?

597
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,875
Oh, my feet hurt!

598
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,518
Among other things.

599
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,519
Did the men do much work here today?

600
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,352
The contractor swore you'd have
the water in by the weekend.

601
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,675
Good.

602
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,712
The sooner the better.

603
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,239
Thank you.

604
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,079
Ann, Mrs. Wadsworth called.

605
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,230
- What did she say?
- You're to call back.

606
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,319
Anything else?

607
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,593
<i>No.</i>

608
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,712
I'll call her right now.

609
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,037
- I'll take it on the extension.
- Good.

610
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,360
(Phone rings)

611
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,869
Hello?

612
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,271
'This is Ann Gentry.
My mother-in-law said that you called.'

613
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,639
Well, I just wanted to apologize
for all that happened today.

614
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,037
There's really no excuse
for the way we acted.

615
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,192
We're willing to cooperate with you,
if you just give us another chance.

616
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,793
OK. Uh...

617
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,672
'Let's forget about what happened'

618
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,916
and make a fresh start.

619
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,034
Right. So there's no reason
to bring in the Public Guardian.

620
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,071
Maybe not.
We'll have to see about that.

621
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,436
<i>'Suppose we...'</i>

622
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,757
meet tomorrow sometime at my office?

623
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,871
Well, I have an idea.

624
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,635
Baby's having a birthday party tomorrow.
Come then.

625
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,631
Well, I appreciate the invitation,
Mrs. Wadsworth,

626
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,156
'but a party usually
isn't the best time to...'

627
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,194
Well, that way, you can also see Baby
in a real family situation.

628
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,391
It might give you some more ideas
on how to help him.

629
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,389
Alright.

630
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,119
'L'd be happy to come.'

631
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,753
Goodbye, Mrs. Wadsworth.

632
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,351
Goodbye, Mrs. Gentry.

633
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,153
(Phone cuts off)

634
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,476
When you do something, Mama,
you sure don't screw around.

635
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,996
- (I Upbeat jazz playing)
- (Mrs. Wadsworth) Isn't that beautiful?

636
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,232
Oh, isn't that lovely?
Look at that!

637
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,590
Isn't that beautiful?

638
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,234
Oh, everybody gather round now.

639
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,715
Oh, here we go.

640
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,431
Baby's gonna make a wish
and help Mama blow out all the candles.

641
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,349
Come on. One, two, three - blow!

642
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,276
Hooray!

643
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,874
Now, the rest of you
just fend for yourselves.

644
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,759
Go on! Eat up! Have a good time!

645
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,710
Hi. I'd like to pay you
a sincere compliment.

646
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,439
You've got beautiful skin.

647
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,117
Don't tell me you're a dermatologist.

648
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,754
No, just a skin freak!

649
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,231
I'm Dennis.

650
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,954
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I'm alone.

651
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,113
<i>I'm sum, 'm.</i>

652
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,550
Would you like to go for a ride?

653
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,116
No, thanks. I'm married.

654
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,919
Well, don'! let that depress you.

655
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,350
I've got just the cure.

656
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,437
I'm happily married.

657
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,110
Shh! Don't let happiness hear you!

658
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,589
How come your old man
ain't here with you?

659
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,517
He was hurt in an accident.

660
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,429
I see. I see.
And he's still out of action, right?

661
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,516
Are you trying to say something?

662
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,754
Lady, there's only one thing I see
in those big, beautiful cat eyes - hunger.

663
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,033
Buzz off, creep! There's a difference
between hunger and starvation.

664
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,710
Wow! You must be president
of the women's lib.

665
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,275
Next time I'll wear my iron jock.

666
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,392
- One of my sister's many beaus.
- Dennis the Menace.

667
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,790
(Germaine) You need something
to get you in a pany mood.

668
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,799
- No thanks. I'm not drinking tonight.
- Why not?

669
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,679
Well, I'd like to be sober
when I talk to your mother.

670
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,711
Maybe you two should get loaded together-
instant communication!

671
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,712
Come on, big sister.

672
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,838
(I Upbeat jazz)

673
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,751
Happy birthday, Baby! And many more!

674
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,520
Hey, you must have really liked your cake!

675
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,199
Yeah!

676
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,757
That's better!

677
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,117
Come on. Give me your hand.
That's a boy.

678
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,913
Having a good time?

679
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,077
We could have that talk now,
Mrs. Wadsworth.

680
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,838
Later. Look!

681
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,316
- This will help you get with it.
- Oh, no, I'm not drinking, thanks.

682
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,556
I would like to talk to you about Baby
before it gets too late.

683
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,512
There's plenty of time for that.

684
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,439
Why don't you just hang loose
and have a good time?

685
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,829
Elliot, let's work out.

686
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,191
- You don't mind, do you?
- Lead the way!

687
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,719
Yes!

688
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,354
Here. I've had it.

689
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,716
- Wanna play?
- Sure.

690
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,796
- Can I play?
- No, Dennis.

691
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,355
You can sit down here
and hold the prize.

692
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,353
You really play to win.

693
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,958
When you're a winner, Alba,
the possibility of losing doesn't even exist.

694
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,318
- (Laughing) I think you're getting old!
- I know, I know I am.

695
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,034
Oh, Baby!

696
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,798
Hi, Baby.

697
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,959
Baby loves Mama
more than anyone else in the whole world.

698
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,789
- Mama, you're one hell of a woman.
- I'm a mother.

699
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,040
A special kind of mother,
to sacrifice yourself all these years.

700
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,429
Most people think it's pretty sad
having a child like Baby.

701
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,397
And maybe it is.

702
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,676
But it can be a blessing.

703
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,599
(Woman)
Mama, you mean it, don't you?

704
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,837
Gives me something to live for.

705
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,472
No, not something.

706
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,799
Everything.

707
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,116
Anybody can gel lucky and win for a while.

708
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,595
I believe in making my own luck.

709
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,269
You know, most children grow up
and they go off on their own.

710
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,113
Well, that's life and it's only natural.

711
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,872
But I find real comfort and joy in knowing

712
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,518
my Baby will never have to face
all that hurt and ugliness out there.

713
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,359
Here, his life is perfect.

714
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,879
Happy-

715
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,516
Are you sure this prize is worth it?

716
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,951
It depends on how badly you want it.

717
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,751
<i>Formidable!</i>

718
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,118
Congratulations.

719
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,434
(Chuckles) It never happens
when you stay with grass.

720
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,517
Why don't we get her to bed?
She can sleep it off.

721
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,637
(Dennis) I know just how to help.

722
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,155
I'll be right back.

723
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,351
That's enough, Dennis.
We can handle this.

724
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,519
Wait for me at the bar.
I'll make it worth your while-.

725
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,154
(Ann) What are you doing?

726
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,631
No. You can't get away with this!

727
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,512
People know I came here.

728
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,632
And people saw you drunk,
and on your way home

729
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,433
you had an accident.

730
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,676
Tie her up and gag her!

731
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,751
(Rattles doorknob)

732
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,077
Alba, sweetheart!
Come on out of there!

733
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,839
Go away, Dennis.

734
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,236
After you make it worth my while!

735
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,717
(Dennis) Come on out of there
and dance with me.

736
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,832
Alba, will you go up there
and shut that idiot up?

737
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,353
- What were you doing down there?
- Do you want to dance or talk?

738
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,800
(Chuckles)

739
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,157
(Muffled) Help me!

740
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,874
(Muffled cries)

741
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,358
Baby!

742
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,474
(Muffled cries)

743
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,392
Help me!

744
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,750
Help! Help me get loose!

745
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,110
Help!

746
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,439
U' Mellow jazz playing)

747
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,711
- (Dennis) Baby!
- (Alba) Oh, baby. How bad do you want me?

748
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,434
Oh, I want you a lot!

749
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,631
Will you do it the way I like it?

750
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,994
- Oh! Does a cannibal eat raw meat?
- OK, cannibal.

751
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,953
(Laughing) Let's test your appetite.

752
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,237
Will you beg for it?

753
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,873
Crawl for it?

754
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,389
Cry like a little puppy dog in bed?

755
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,550
I've got a better idea!
Give me your lighter.

756
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,399
- What the hell for'?
- Just give it to me, OK?

757
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,318
Put your hand in the flame.

758
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,552
You gotta be kidding!

759
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:05,233
Just one finger-
for one little old minute?

760
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,556
- Alba'?
- Uh-huh?

761
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,071
I'll do anything to get to paradise,

762
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,760
but does it have to be in an ambulance?

763
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,111
Just think - what a trip!

764
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,753
(Crash)

765
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,759
_ (Baby be ' 9'"S to _ cry)

766
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,119
Baby, it's OK. It's OK. It's alright.
Just be quiet.

767
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,119
(Stops crying)

768
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,713
(Dennis) Done it!

769
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,353
I did it!

770
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,110
Only for a few seconds, lover.
Nowhere near a minute.

771
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,990
You little bitch!

772
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,720
- Call me tomorrow.
- (He moans)

773
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,911
Maybe I'll have some free time.

774
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,395
Yeah, bye! Goodnight, Al!

775
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,354
Come on, Baby. Here we go.

776
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,230
(Mrs. Wadsworth) Alba, we're waiting.

777
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,278
Come on, Baby.

778
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,753
Come on. Let's go.

779
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,951
- (Grizzling)
- Baby, let's go!

780
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,593
What are you doing?

781
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,557
Now, come on! We have to go.

782
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,398
Come on!

783
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:19,476
Now, be a good little cannibal and just go
find yourself another midnight snack.

784
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,195
Alba, one of these days you're going
to turn me into a vegetarian.

785
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,834
Uh-huh. Well, bye-bye.

786
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,314
Now...

787
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,197
OK, let's get it over with.

788
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,959
(Car door shuts)

789
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,030
(Car door shuts, engine starts)

790
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,790
(Mrs. Wadsworth) My God! Baby!
She took him!

791
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,273
- (Brakes screech)
- What the hell? Alba, take a look!

792
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,713
- That tricky bitch!
- She punctured it.

793
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,438
She thinks of everything.

794
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,190
- It's been almost two hours.
- How much longer do we have to wait?

795
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,311
No phone calls. No police.
Nothing's happening.

796
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,071
I'm beginning to understand that girl.

797
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,157
Why wouldn't she go to the police?

798
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,554
Why should she?
She's got what she wants.

799
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,953
- She means to keep him?
- What for?

800
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,840
- (Baby) Bubbles!
- (Ann laughs)

801
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,480
- You like the bubbles, don't you?
- Yeah.

802
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,275
Nice to get all clean.

803
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,353
Oh, thank you!
You're a sweetheart, aren't you?

804
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,238
You sure are.

805
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,193
Baby? I have a surprise for you.

806
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,276
Not bad.
I think this will do just fine.

807
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,875
Your first pair of long pants,
and it's about time.

808
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,156
Oh, don't worry, honey.
You'll get used to it.

809
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,436
Oh, yes. Poor Baby.

810
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,950
Mama?

811
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,599
Mama?

812
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,393
- Mama.
- What is it?

813
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,397
Well, your bridge group's
on the phone.

814
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,591
They want to know
if you're available.

815
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,791
No, tell them when I'm feeling better.

816
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,755
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

817
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,639
Mama?

818
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,718
It isn't worth it.

819
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,796
We should have let them take him.

820
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,792
Alba, you're not talking about
that circus?

821
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,950
Mm-hm.

822
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,311
They wanted to put him in a side show.
We should've said yes.

823
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,716
Are you calling your brother a freak?

824
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,354
No, Mama.
I just thought it'd be better that way.

825
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,679
She didn't mean it, Mama.

826
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,833
Never!

827
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,230
Never let me hear you say that again.

828
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,354
I'm sorry, Mama.

829
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,991
(Baby gurgling)

830
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,075
They're almost finished.
The men are ready to use the gunite.

831
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,594
Tell them to hold off for a few days.

832
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,552
We'll call them when we're ready.

833
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,234
Ann, darling, are you sure
you want to go through with this?

834
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,995
- There's no other way.
- You're not having second thoughts?

835
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,758
Not anymore.

836
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,838
You're not afraid afterwards
that we'll be just like them?

837
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,430
Judith, we could never be like them.

838
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,514
OK.

839
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,679
OK, Baby.
We're going to take your picture now.

840
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,473
You're going to like that.

841
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,069
This is going to be
a very special picture.

842
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,636
But you have to stand up
straight and tall like a big man.

843
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,353
That's it, give me your hand.

844
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,036
Up YOU go!

845
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,117
That's a good boy!

846
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,992
You just stand there.

847
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,395
OK, Baby. OK.
Come on, give me a little smile.

848
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,716
Go on! Smile for the camera.

849
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,559
Come on, please?

850
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,433
That's good.
Come on, just a big smile!

851
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,119
(Camera shutter clicks)

852
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,591
Just look at that!

853
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,037
It doesn't even look like him.

854
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,117
"Wadsworth family-.

855
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,553
"I am in the process
of making Baby into a grown man.

856
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,039
"As I have always suspected,

857
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:39,040
"his responses are those
of a sensitive and intelligent person.

858
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,676
"His progress, so far,
proves that beyond a doubt.

859
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:51,236
"In a short time, the Baby you once knew
will no longer exist.

860
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:58,591
"Even if circumstances beyond my control
force him to return... home...

861
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,713
"...it will be too late
to reverse his transformation.

862
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,713
"Your Baby is lost to you forever."

863
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,873
Good Samaritan!

864
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,559
What a lie!

865
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,031
We've got to get him back
before ifs loo late.

866
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:20,834
Just tell us what you want, Mama.
We'll do it.

867
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,674
First, we have to find her.

868
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,397
(Germaine) That's her car.

869
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,110
Look around, girls.

870
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,955
If you see any signs of Baby,
don't go in there.

871
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,316
Suppose we know he's in there for sure?

872
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,436
Then we'll all go in together.

873
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,029
I expect you back in five minutes.

874
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,436
Both of you.

875
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,511
(Baby crying)

876
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,469
- (Ann) Quiet, Baby.
- (Baby crying)

877
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,830
Alright. You asked for it.

878
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,758
(Thud)

879
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,156
(Baby crying)

880
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,157
(Dog barking)

881
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,597
(Baby crying)

882
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,671
(Whispers) Germaine?

883
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,238
<i>Germans'?</i>

884
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,913
<i>Germans'?</i>

885
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,150
(Clock chimes)

886
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,832
(Whispers) Germaine?

887
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,679
Alba?

888
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,759
<i>Germans'?</i>

889
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,433
Alba?

890
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,478
Germaine!

891
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,917
9h, my baby!

892
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,033
Germaine!

893
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,919
Germaine!

894
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,395
- Mama?
- Alba.

895
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,679
Mama.

896
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,794
Alba!

897
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,712
Oh, my God!

898
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,439
Alba!

899
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,189
(Sobbing) Alba!

900
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,754
(Footsteps)

901
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,552
(Groans)

902
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,073
on, my legs!

903
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,837
Oh, they're broken. I can't move!

904
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,559
- (Ann) We've got her now.
- (Mrs. Wadsworth moaning)

905
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,632
(Ann) No, wait!

906
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,713
It's better this way.

907
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,273
Get some rope to tie her hands.

908
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,869
You killed my daughters.

909
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,318
You killed them.

910
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,875
(Baby crying)

911
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,558
My Baby!

912
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,196
What have you done to my Baby?

913
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,516
Why do you want my Baby?

914
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,790
Why do you want him?

915
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:10,160
Now what's going to happen to my Baby?
What's going to happen to him?

916
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,871
You won't harm him?

917
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,640
Tell me, I have to know!

918
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,798
- What's going to happen to my Baby?
- Nothing!

919
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,560
You won't harm him.
You want to have him.

920
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,355
We'll love, cherish and protect him.

921
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,194
(Gasps)

922
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,632
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

923
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,793
You bitch! You murdering bitch!

924
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,837
Bitch!

925
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,314
Oh, my girls!

926
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,714
Oh, my girls!

927
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,196
(Cries out)

928
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,593
Alright, Baby. Had enough?

929
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,194
Gonna be good?

930
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,158
OK. Come on.

931
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:50,790
- How do you feel?
- Fine. I'll make some coffee.

932
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,399
Good.

933
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,074
Come on.

934
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,393
Where's my best worker?

935
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,396
There he is!

936
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,716
Are you putting up a new building?

937
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:16,077
Hi! Were you lonely all by yourself
last night, sweetheart?

938
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,433
I know. Wifey loves
her big baby husband, yes.

939
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,035
Hey. Look who's here. Look!
It's your playmate. He's come back!

940
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,754
And now he can stay with you always.

941
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,919
Come on. Come on, Baby.
Say hello to Roger. Yes!

942
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,792
You two like each other, don'! you?

01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,036
Oh, my two big men!

945
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,793
Wait just a minute.
We'll save some for later.

946
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,238
Surprise!

947
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,078
Look what I've got!

948
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,830
One for Baby, and one for Roger!

949
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,111
These are great fun!

950
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,629
These are for our brand new pool!

951
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,390
And just as soon as it's filled,
we're all going to go in it...

952
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,598
(indistinct)
