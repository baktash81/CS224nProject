1
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,567
I'm gonna play it again.

2
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,559
You play that thing one more time and
I'm gonna melt it down into hair spray.

3
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,168
Let me play that side then.

4
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,969
No, Rayette, it's not
a question of sides.

5
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,967
It's a question of musical integrity.

6
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,081
Then let me sing one for you.

7
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,479
-When there's a fire...
-Hold it.

8
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,602
Bobby!

9
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,798
You quit that now!

10
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,079
You said you're gonna
help me pick a song.

11
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,564
I'm gonna cut off
your damn water, Bobby. I swear.

12
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,367
Selfish.

13
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,077
You play on the piano...

14
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:48,964
...and your whole family can play
on some type of musical instrument.

15
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,957
All I'm asking is for you
to help me improve my musical talent.

16
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,160
You would think you would.

17
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,968
Why don't you take
that sign off your tit...

18
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,764
...and let's you and me go out
and have some real good time?

19
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:05,567
Where are we going?

20
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,163
I don't know. I'll holler up
to Elton and Stoney.

21
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,761
Bobby, now listen a minute.

22
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,403
You know, I'll go out with you...

23
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,561
...or I'll stay in with you...

24
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:27,358
...or I'll do anything
that you'd like for me to do...

25
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,363
...if you would tell me
that you love me.

26
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,365
You can sing the song.

27
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:45,363
You are never satisfied.

28
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:48,968
That's right.

29
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:55,679
-Honey, I'm sorry.
-lt's okay.

30
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,763
All right. Here it is.

31
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,565
They were all set up right for you.

32
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:17,805
Get it right in there, Dipesto.

33
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,889
All you gotta do, just relax, honey.

34
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,886
Keep that left foot forward.

35
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,562
Set her down!

36
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:33,279
Not too much of a match, is it, EI?

37
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,963
Don't lead out with your right foot.

38
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,638
-ln the gutter. Isn't that wonderf ul?
-lt's just heavy for me.

39
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,238
The pins, you know. I can't see them.

40
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,848
Just squint. I squint.

41
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:50,200
There they are right down there.
All these little boards.

42
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,724
You notice them leading down?
Just spot...

43
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:53,805
But there's so many.

44
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:54,998
What's that for?

45
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:56,364
That's for luck.

46
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:58,600
-Get on out there.
-Great, he slobbered on me.

47
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:01,044
Yeah, ain't the first time.

48
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,162
Watch this.

49
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,964
There she is. She's doing a little
variation on "The Apache Shift"!

50
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,562
I taught her that.

51
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,997
-Are you mad at me?
-No, I'm not mad at you.

52
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,121
-lt'll be all right.
-Tell me you're not mad at me.

53
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:19,160
I'm not mad at you.

54
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,405
Go on, beat it.

55
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:27,482
-I'll show you how it's done.
-Don't talk about it. Do it!

56
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,599
Isn't he pretty?

57
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,767
Good one!

58
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:43,162
Show me a little something now.
Give me spirit!

59
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,802
It's just the thing
just goes off cocky-wobbly.

60
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,607
Just do what I tell you.

61
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,367
I did, didn't l, EI?

62
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:57,565
You got another ball coming.

63
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,161
-Come on, Rayette!
-Just relax.

64
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:09,161
That's a boy, Ray!

65
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:12,806
That was real good, wasn't it?

66
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,562
I finally did it.

67
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,960
Great! You throw
the big Z's for 19 f rames...

68
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,878
...and then you throw a strike
on the last ball of the losing game.

69
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,405
Wonderf ul, just wonderf ul.
Wasn't that wonderf ul, ladies?

70
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,968
Are you talking to us?

71
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:28,568
Wonderf ul.

72
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,160
I guess I'll go wait in the car.

73
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:34,759
Why don't you go
wait in the car, Rayette?

74
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,364
I will. I'll wait there right now.

75
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,560
One minute, honey,
and I'll go with you.

76
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,559
Me and Stoney got to get on home.
Relieve the sitter.

77
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:52,767
Why don't you and Ray
just come on by the place?

78
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:55,200
All right, why don't you go on?

79
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,885
Here. I'll take care of the beers.

80
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,404
And would you walk Rayette
along with you?

81
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,560
-Sure.
-Thanks, EI.

82
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,484
What do we owe you?

83
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,162
Four dollars, sir.

84
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:29,323
Ex cuse me.

85
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:32,760
Here's a five. Thanks very much.

86
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:39,205
We've been wanting to ask you...

87
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:42,168
...you're on the TV, aren't you?

88
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,158
Am I?

89
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:47,406
She says you're the guy
that sells all the cars...

90
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,368
...on TV.

91
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,280
I might've sold a few cars.

92
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:55,808
I told you!

93
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,167
My name's Shirley, but they
call me Betty. And her name's Twinky.

94
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,365
-Twinky?
-Yeah, because she's so "twinky"!

95
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:05,803
Boy, oh, boy!

96
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:10,361
Well, Betty and Twinky,
it sure is nice talking to you girls.

97
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,565
I wish I had some more time.

98
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,925
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?

99
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,404
I told her that you're wearing a wig...

100
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,005
...because on the TV
you're mostly all...

101
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,961
...bald up there.

102
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:26,689
Hey, your little f riend's real sharp.

103
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,362
I don't...

104
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,965
I don't wear the wig on TV.
If you're gonna be out there...

105
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,599
...in f ront of 2 million people,
you got to be sincere.

106
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:39,398
I like to wear it in bowling alleys
and slipping around.

107
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,209
It gives me a little class.
What do you think?

108
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:45,799
Yeah, but I can see
a little bitty of a net up there.

109
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,761
That's what gave it away.

110
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:49,568
A little net?

111
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:51,805
Well, I...

112
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,359
I wish I had more time
to talk to you girls, but...

113
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,724
I have to... I'll...

114
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,369
Come on, Ray.
We're gonna go over to Elton's.

115
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,167
I'm not.

116
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:16,760
You're just gonna sit here?

117
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,403
Yes.

118
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,162
Okay, I hope no one hits on you.

119
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,766
I hope they do.

120
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:30,601
See you later.

121
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:59,161
No one would want to hit on you.
You look too pathetic.

122
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:04,365
Come on, Dipesto,
we can still have a good time.

123
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,568
You're the pathetic one. Not me.

124
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,358
I'm going over to Elton's.

125
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,562
I am not a piece of crap.

126
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,767
I'm sorry.

127
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,599
You treat me like I was.

128
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,561
Go slip around,
right before my face...

129
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,560
...and in f ront of Elton
and Stoney that way.

130
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,159
What do you imagine they think
of somebody you treat like that?

131
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,166
Now, now, Ray.

132
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:54,807
Now, sweetheart, Elton and Stoney
know that I love you.

133
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:58,678
They're just gonna think that
I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not...

134
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,764
...and that you're a hell of a good person
for putting up with me, that's all.

135
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:07,369
You'll just find me dead one time.

136
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,966
You'll just kill me.

137
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,558
Come on, be a good girl.

138
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,403
If you ever really
get up and leave me...

139
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,799
...you'll read about it
in the newsprint.

140
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,961
I'm not gonna get up and leave you.

141
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,762
Now come on.

142
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,160
Let's go over to Elton's
and have a good time.

143
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,765
You love me, Bobby?

144
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,767
What do you think?

145
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,969
You got banana on your face.

146
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,403
I do?

147
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,965
I still ain't figured out how
you got me working back out here.

148
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,088
I got you to come out here?

149
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,958
I ain't figured out how you let me
get you to work on these rigs.

150
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:46,798
I never worked on these things before.
You worked on them before.

151
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,967
I can't figure out how
you let me get us out here.

152
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,564
Somebody had to look out for you.

153
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:55,759
You're a mess.

154
00:13:58,689 --> 00:13:59,599
You're crazy.

155
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,083
-I'm gonna bet $2 right off.
-I'm in.

156
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,041
You're bullshitting me now.

157
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,604
-I have to see it.
-I got a pair of nine.

158
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:24,605
Can you beat two pair?

159
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:27,881
-There's three aces, right there.
-Piss on you.

160
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,162
I got me a hand there!

161
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,367
It's time for me to go home.
See you in the morning, boys.

162
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,519
See you, Glen.

163
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,846
I don't know if I'm going
out there tomorrow at all, man.

164
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:43,004
I got a lot of money tied up,
and everything I got telling me to...

165
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,481
I don't want no chains
going around, and all this.

166
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:50,881
I prefer card playing. Where is it?
What the hell is going on in this game?

167
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,643
People talking...
We got money here, or what?

168
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,761
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

169
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:59,529
To Banbury Cross we go

170
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,647
When I was 4, just 4 years old...

171
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,600
...I went to my mother and I said,
"What's this hole?"

172
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:11,966
I saw this dimple in my chin.
I didn't know what it was.

173
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,801
And my mother says:

174
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:17,240
"When you're born, you go
on an assembly line past God.

175
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:21,118
If He likes you, He says, 'You cute
little thing, ' and you get dimples.

176
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:24,366
And if He doesn't like you,
He goes, 'Go away."'

177
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,608
So about six months later
my mother found me saying my prayers.

178
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,204
And I was going,
" Now I lay me down to sleep."

179
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,407
She says, "What're you
covering up your chin for?"

180
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:37,681
And I said,
" Because if I cover up the hole...

181
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:39,681
...maybe He'll listen to me."

182
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,728
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

183
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:48,598
To Banbury Cross we go

184
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:01,567
Do you wanna buy a ticket
To a raffle of a dog

185
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:05,803
That comes a runnin' licking
When you whistle, holler, "Claude"

186
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,924
A big brown dog just as sound as a ring

187
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,281
He'll be 8 years old
If he lives to the spring

188
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,999
Unfit! Do I look unfit to you, Elton?

189
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:19,364
I'm fit! I'm fit!

190
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,406
If you haven't got your ticket yet

191
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,480
Well, you better order it

192
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,286
He'll wet your carpet
And he'll fertilize your grass

193
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,688
And he's got three white feet
And a hole in his ass

194
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,643
Don't you know no songs
about women or nothing?

195
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,126
Yeah, but I'm just too loaded
to think of them now.

196
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:42,049
Watch out for all this traffic.

197
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,402
Watch out for all this traffic.

198
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:46,163
-God!
-I ain't in no hurry.

199
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:50,368
Can you believe starting off your day
like this, going to work?

200
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:53,768
Unbelievable.
Let me have a drink, will you?

201
00:16:54,969 --> 00:16:56,368
Thanks, Elton.

202
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,359
Boy! That's tough in the morning.

203
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,360
What the hell are
these people doing here?

204
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,763
Isn't this some goddamn thing, Elton?

205
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:14,364
Jesus Christ!

206
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,567
What does he want? What I can't stand
is sitting on this goddamn f reeway.

207
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,724
Why don't you flash your lights so as we
can see what else you got for Christmas?

208
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,164
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

209
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,443
Where are you going?

210
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:48,280
Why don't we all line up
like a goddamn bunch of ants...

211
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,965
...in the most beautif ul
part of the day and gas ourselves?

212
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:04,761
Hey, get off my car!

213
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,245
Hey, Bobby!

214
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:36,287
Shit! What's he doing?

215
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,362
Play it!

216
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,558
Bob, quit fooling around! Come on!

217
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,164
Bobby!

218
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:18,161
He's turning!

219
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:03,408
I was with Elton last night, Ray.

220
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,402
It's the truth.

221
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,483
Rayette?

222
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:32,605
Son of a bitch!

223
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,404
Now reach for it.
Come on, reach for it!

224
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:04,002
Come on!

225
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:07,044
Good boy!
Come on, let's go see Bob.

226
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:09,001
I can't see!

227
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:19,204
Isn't he sweet?

228
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:21,127
Can't see the set well.

229
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:23,200
You take him for a while now.

230
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:24,838
Go ahead now.

231
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:26,522
How you doing?

232
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,009
You ought to get yourself
one of them, Bob.

233
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:40,919
That's it. Just crush that one too,
then I won't get any.

234
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:44,479
Well, bless my soul,
it's a new harmonica!

235
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:46,839
That's for your birthday.

236
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,563
Well, how do you know
when my birthday is?

237
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,043
Bye, Stoney.

238
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,807
Bye, Stoney.

239
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:57,403
Kitchen's on fire, Stoney.

240
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,605
Your mother just died, Stoney.

241
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:03,401
Bye-bye.

242
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:06,719
See you out in the field, Bob.

243
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,607
Okay, thanks a lot.

244
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:15,006
Honey, you just love
that little baby, don't you?

245
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:18,565
Well? What if she was, Bob?

246
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:21,408
I can't see nothing so bad in that.

247
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:25,526
What if I let you in
on a little secret, that she is?

248
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:27,878
That's right.

249
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:29,602
She told me.

250
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,122
She's all torn up about it too,
which I hate to see.

251
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,167
Isn't it something
you just have to face up to?

252
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:41,044
Somewhere along the line,
you even get to liking the whole idea.

253
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:44,406
When Stoney first gave me the news,
I could've shit!

254
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:51,405
Well, isn't that nice?

255
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:55,638
It's ridiculous! I'm here,
listening to some cracker asshole...

256
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:59,199
...lives in a trailer park,
compare his life to mine!

257
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,844
Keep on telling me about the good life,
because it makes me puke.

258
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,402
If you think you're something better
than what I am, that's something else.

259
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:16,564
I can't say much of someone who could
leave a woman in a situation like this.

260
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,448
That's all I have to say.

261
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:23,439
I'm glad that's all, because I'm
as tired of your mouth as I am...

262
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:26,203
...working on this goddamn job!

263
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:32,082
Shit-ass!

264
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:47,887
Hey! Longcipher!

265
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:53,207
Hey! Longcipher!

266
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm quitting!

267
00:24:56,249 --> 00:24:58,240
Do you hear me? I said I'm quitting.

268
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:00,525
I don't give a damn what you do.

269
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,806
I'm glad to get rid
of the both of you dumb guys.

270
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:20,204
Hey!

271
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:22,599
What's going on?

272
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:32,284
What's going on?

273
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,284
Don't do that, Bob!
Don't mix in!

274
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:42,408
They got the right, Bob! It's the law!

275
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:43,479
It's the law!

276
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:04,044
Don't you think you could
just leave him?

277
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:07,759
If he'd have known who you were,
he wouldn't have done that. Bob?

278
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:10,002
What the hell's going on?

279
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:11,843
All right, let him go.

280
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:15,448
What's going on, Elton?

281
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:20,240
I got accused of robbing
the filling station. Didn't I tell you?

282
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:22,917
I just got wild and jumped my bail.

283
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:27,162
And here they come running at me a whole
year later. Isn't that something?

284
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:31,524
Hey, tell Stoney for me, you hear?

285
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:45,038
Hi.

286
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,438
Miss Dupea?

287
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:49,601
Upstairs.
It's upstairs and to the right.

288
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:38,202
There she goes again.

289
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:42,287
My 1 -year-old can
carry a tune better than that.

290
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:49,965
Miss Dupea?

291
00:28:57,449 --> 00:29:02,204
I'd like to remind you again that this
is not an opera or a musical comedy.

292
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,998
I'm sorry. Was I singing again?

293
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,401
If you wanna call it that.

294
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:12,800
You have simply to tell me.
That's all.

295
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:15,240
That's exactly what I am doing again.

296
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,401
You let me get 2l3 of the way through
the movement... This is tiring me.

297
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,599
I have another suggestion.
Why don't we take a break?

298
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:25,878
For pity's sake!

299
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,317
Is she gonna cry again?

300
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:29,167
I don't want to take a break.

301
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,404
Some coffee?

302
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:33,402
What would you like
in your coffee, Miss Dupea?

303
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,004
-Tea.
-One tea.

304
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,528
Tell her Bobby's here.

305
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,407
Bobby's here.

306
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:45,005
Oh, my goodness!

307
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:50,005
Robert Eroica.

308
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:02,199
I can't look at you.

309
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,606
Well, don't, then.

310
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:11,004
You always do this to me.

311
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:13,922
I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.

312
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:15,244
Thank you.

313
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,006
-Don't put it there.
-Why? What's wrong?

314
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:23,322
This is a very special CB-275.

315
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,002
No kidding?

316
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:30,601
It has absolutely
no objectionable idiosyncrasies.

317
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,646
Robert, I have to talk seriously to you.

318
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:43,608
Everybody still living up on the island?

319
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:49,640
At the moment, there's really
just Daddy, Carl and myself...

320
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,117
...and Van Oost.

321
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:52,921
-Who's Van Oost?
-Catherine.

322
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:55,802
She's a pianist.
She's working with Carl.

323
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:58,649
Carl's a fiddler.
What's he doing coaching piano?

324
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,926
Well, 11 months ago...

325
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:05,526
...he was on his bicycle on his way
to the post office in the village.

326
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,808
And he ran straight into a Jeep
and sprained his neck.

327
00:31:10,009 --> 00:31:12,398
Strained his neck?

328
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:15,687
That's not f unny.
He permanently sprained his neck.

329
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:20,724
And since then it's been extremely
painf ul for him to tuck the violin.

330
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:24,006
Crashes into a Jeep
and totals his neck!

331
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:28,808
Robert?

332
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,203
I have...
I have to tell you.

333
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:37,001
Daddy's very ill.

334
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:43,883
What's...

335
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:48,401
-What?
-He's had two strokes.

336
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:55,843
He's not...

337
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,803
They feel he...
He might not recover f rom it.

338
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,000
Don't tell me about this.

339
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:12,959
But don't you think it's right
that you should see him at least once?

340
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:15,845
-Miss Dupea?
-Just a minute, please!

341
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,404
Don't you think it's right
you should see him?

342
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:20,321
Yeah, I guess so.

343
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:23,208
I'm going back tonight.
Will you come with me?

344
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:24,963
No.

345
00:32:25,689 --> 00:32:28,203
I'd rather drive up.

346
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:31,202
Maybe I'll go into Canada after.

347
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,921
I'm not gonna stay long, Tita.
One week at the most.

348
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:37,363
I know.

349
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:42,483
Well...

350
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:47,242
Come on, I'll walk you out.

351
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,448
I'll be back in two minutes.

352
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,645
We've had our break, Miss Dupea.

353
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:54,447
They hate me, I feel.

354
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,805
Maybe you better stay.

355
00:32:58,489 --> 00:33:02,038
I want to talk to you
about so many things.

356
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,803
I'll be seeing you in a couple of days.

357
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,607
I'm so glad.

358
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:09,602
Me too.

359
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,283
Bye.

360
00:34:51,769 --> 00:34:52,963
Hello?

361
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:01,406
You got the day off?

362
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,401
Are you sick?

363
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,805
I guess you heard about Elton.

364
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:29,318
I got your point.

365
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:33,608
I hope you didn't strain yourself
getting in here before I hit the door.

366
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,200
I have to go home.

367
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:43,880
My father's sick.

368
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,603
I'll be gone for two or three weeks.

369
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:56,084
You'll be gone, period.

370
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:14,203
I'll try and call you f rom up there.

371
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,407
Come on, Dipesto.

372
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:31,806
I never told you that
it would work out to anything.

373
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:34,403
Did I?

374
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:42,207
I'll send you some money.
That's all I can do.

375
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,203
I'll try and call you f rom up there.

376
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,002
Bye, Ray.

377
00:37:41,249 --> 00:37:43,001
You wanna go with me?

378
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:36,322
There's been hot spells and cold spells
Ever since we met

379
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:41,120
I've seen your big fires, small fires
But I won't give up yet

380
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:46,047
Oh, someday you'll yearn
Because your heart's gonna burn

381
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:49,918
For that old familiar glow

382
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:52,198
You'll be burnt...

383
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:55,199
-Like it?
-I love it.

384
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:59,043
You'll be burnt out or smoked out

385
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,046
And come back to me

386
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,119
I know

387
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,125
-What the hell are they doing?
-ls that...

388
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:07,405
Is that an accident?

389
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:11,804
Who was driving?

390
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:14,204
Who was driving? You were driving!

391
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:16,440
Hey, what the hell's going on?

392
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:17,883
Rotate, mac!

393
00:39:20,489 --> 00:39:22,241
Look at my car! Look at my car!

394
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,481
I just bought it brand-new
f rom the used-car lot!

395
00:39:25,689 --> 00:39:27,008
You're lucky nobody was hurt.

396
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:28,198
Give us a lift?

397
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,643
Terry, we got a ride!

398
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,403
You gonna give those people a lift?

399
00:39:32,649 --> 00:39:36,881
-I can't just leave them here.
-I'd like to punch that son of a bitch!

400
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:39,603
Jesus! What a rude person!

401
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:44,043
What's your name?

402
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,007
Palm Apodaca.

403
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:48,724
What's your name?

404
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,448
Terry Grouse.

405
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,163
What?

406
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,800
How far are you going to?

407
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,602
Washington.

408
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:01,606
We'll get off in Washington.
We'll hook a ride.

409
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,607
Where are you going?

410
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,083
Alaska.

411
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:06,718
Alaska?

412
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:08,448
What are you? On vacation?

413
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:11,408
She wants to live there
because it's cleaner.

414
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:12,645
Cleaner?

415
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:14,607
Cleaner than what?

416
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:20,405
Don't tell everybody. Soon they'll all
go there, and it won't be so clean.

417
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:23,404
What makes you think it's cleaner?

418
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,600
I saw a picture of it.

419
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:30,201
Alaska's very clean.
It appeared to look very white to me.

420
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:32,201
Don't you think?

421
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:36,006
Yep. That was before the big thaw.

422
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:38,117
Before the what?

423
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,445
I had to leave because
I got depressed seeing all the crap.

424
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,439
And they're making more crap,
you know?

425
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:04,209
They got so many stores
f ull of crap...

426
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:05,723
...I can't believe it.

427
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:06,799
Who?

428
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,004
Who?

429
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:09,801
Man, that's who.

430
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:13,198
Pretty soon,
there won't be any room for man.

431
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:19,604
They're selling more crap that people
go and buy than you can imagine. Crap!

432
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:24,720
Everybody should have a big hole
where they burn the stuff.

433
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:27,807
They'd never find
a hole big enough. Never.

434
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:29,408
Now, take me. Look at me.

435
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:33,244
When I was just one person,
before I was with Bobby...

436
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:36,447
...I was collecting onto me
more garbage every day...

437
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:39,840
...till I was thinking
that I should get a disposal.

438
00:41:40,049 --> 00:41:41,243
Disposal?

439
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:44,720
What's that but more crap!
I've never seen such crap!

440
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:46,521
Mass production does it.

441
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,805
To be honest,
you're not clean either.

442
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,438
I'm not that neat maybe,
but I am clean.

443
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:53,008
Well, you're not that bad.

444
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:55,006
But some people.

445
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:58,447
People's homes. Just filth!
I've been in homes...

446
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:01,806
I think that more people
are neat than are clean.

447
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:06,964
In my personal thing, I don't see that.
I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth.

448
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:10,440
What they need to do every day
is a cockroach thing...

449
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:12,805
...where they spray the homes...

450
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:16,359
Can you imagine if their doors were
a pretty colour, with a pot outside?

451
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:18,725
-Could be adorable.
-And they picked up!

452
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:21,807
It wouldn't be filthy
without Coke bottles and whiskey...

453
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:25,246
...and those signs everywhere.
They should be erased!

454
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:28,003
All those signs
selling you crap and more crap!

455
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:31,804
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't even want to talk about it.

456
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,485
It's just filthy! People are filthy!

457
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:37,368
That's the biggest thing
that's wrong with people!

458
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:41,801
I think if they were clean
they wouldn't have anybody to pick on.

459
00:42:42,649 --> 00:42:44,002
Dirt!

460
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:48,322
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad.
It's filth! Filth is bad.

461
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,129
That's what starts maggots and riots.

462
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,847
Follow that truck.
They know the best places to stop.

463
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,205
That's an old maid's tale.

464
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:58,285
Bullshit!

465
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:01,445
Truck drivers know the best places.

466
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:05,477
Salesmen and cops know. If you'd
ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.

467
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:06,724
Don't call me " honey, " mac.

468
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:09,523
Don't call me "mac, " honey!

469
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:14,688
I wouldn't be a waitress.
They're f ull of crap.

470
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:17,319
You just hold on to your tongue!

471
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:19,002
Hold on to this.

472
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:21,847
If you think you can...

473
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,198
Shut up!

474
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:24,808
All of you!

475
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:33,605
I'd like a plain omelette,
no potatoes, tomatoes instead...

476
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,004
...a cup of coffee and wheat toast.

477
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:37,318
No substitutions.

478
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:40,366
You don't have any tomatoes?

479
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:42,002
Only what's on the menu.

480
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:46,083
You can have a plain omelette.
Comes with cottage f ries and rolls.

481
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:49,201
I know what it comes with,
but it's not what I want.

482
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:51,280
I'll come back
when you make up your mind.

483
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:52,717
I have made up my mind.

484
00:43:53,249 --> 00:43:56,321
I'd like a plain omelette,
no potatoes on the plate.

485
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:58,997
A cup of coffee
and a side order of wheat toast.

486
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,484
We don't have any side orders of toast.

487
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,919
I'll give you a muffin
or a coffee roll.

488
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:08,247
You don't make side orders of toast?
You make sandwiches, don't you?

489
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,887
Wanna talk to the manager?

490
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:12,044
Hey, mac!

491
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:13,608
Shut up!

492
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,761
You've got bread
and a toaster of some kind?

493
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:18,322
I don't make the rules.

494
00:44:18,529 --> 00:44:21,248
Okay, I'll make it
as easy for you as I can.

495
00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:26,199
I'd like an omelette, plain, and
a chicken-salad sandwich on wheat toast.

496
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:29,998
No mayonnaise, no butter,
no lettuce and a cup of coffee.

497
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:32,444
A number two, chicken-salad sand.

498
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:36,807
Hold the butter, the lettuce
and the mayonnaise, and a cup of coffee.

499
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:37,959
Anything else?

500
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:41,605
Yeah, now hold the chicken,
bring me the toast...

501
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:45,643
...give me a check for the sandwich,
and you haven't broken any rules.

502
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,885
You want me to hold the chicken, huh?

503
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:51,406
I want you to hold it
between your knees.

504
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:53,928
You see that sign, sir?

505
00:44:54,689 --> 00:44:58,841
You all have to leave. I'm not taking
any more of your smartness and sarcasm!

506
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:01,000
You see this sign?

507
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:05,528
Fantastic that you could
figure that all out...

508
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:08,846
...so that you could come up
with a way to get your toast!

509
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:10,402
I didn't get it, did I?

510
00:45:10,649 --> 00:45:14,722
No, but it was very clever.
I would've just punched her out.

511
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,399
People! Shit!

512
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:23,600
Animals are not like that.

513
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:29,128
They're always cleaning themselves.
Do you ever see pigeons?

514
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,763
He's always picking
on himself and his f riends.

515
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:36,085
Always picking bugs out of their hair.

516
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:40,726
Monkeys too. Ex cept they do something
out in the open that I don't go for.

517
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:49,608
You know, I read where they
invented this car that runs on...

518
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,722
...that runs on...

519
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:53,163
When you boil water?

520
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,079
Steam.

521
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:58,962
A car that you could ride in
and not cause a stink.

522
00:45:59,169 --> 00:46:02,400
But do you know they
will not even let us have it?

523
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:04,201
Can you believe it?

524
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:05,398
Why?

525
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:06,644
Man!

526
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,766
He likes to create a stink!

527
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,961
I mean, I've seen filth
that you wouldn't believe.

528
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,602
What a stink!

529
00:46:14,449 --> 00:46:16,201
I don't even wanna talk about it.

530
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:14,204
You depressed about your daddy, hon?

531
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:16,083
No.

532
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:20,008
I imagine it's me then, isn't it?

533
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:22,407
Is what you?

534
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,199
Are you depressed I come along?

535
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:29,799
Who says I'm depressed?

536
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:33,398
Is that a happy face I see?

537
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:40,998
Because if it is,
I'll just catch a Greyhound back.

538
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:46,808
Oh, you're not gonna kill yourself
this time. I wish I'd known.

539
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:02,883
Well...

540
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,001
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to get to sleep.

541
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:09,401
Hint, hint.

542
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:17,807
Guess I'll have to count the sheep.

543
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:19,598
One...

544
00:48:19,849 --> 00:48:21,043
...two...

545
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,608
...three...

546
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:24,243
...four...

547
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:25,883
...five...

548
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:27,443
...six...

549
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:29,763
...seven...

550
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:35,848
Look at this old cold shoulder.

551
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:40,601
What am I going to do about it?

552
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:50,607
You know, if you wouldn't open your
mouth, everything would be just fine.

553
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:55,808
Take a look.

554
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:10,046
Why can't I come out with you
to your family's house?

555
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:12,405
I have to see what's going on first.

556
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:17,245
My father's sick. They wouldn't be
prepared for my bringing anyone.

557
00:49:17,449 --> 00:49:19,838
How long do I have to sit in that place?

558
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:22,085
If you can't do what I'm asking you...

559
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:25,844
...why don't you take the money
and go on back south with it?

560
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,961
Don't talk like that.

561
00:49:28,169 --> 00:49:31,639
Try to understand
this is not something that I wanna do.

562
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:34,608
Jesus Christ, you ought to
know me well enough for that!

563
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:36,998
All right, honey.

564
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:41,407
It'll be all right.
I mean, there's stuff for me to do.

565
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:44,169
They got magazines in there
and TV, right?

566
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:48,407
I'll try and call you
in a couple of days.

567
00:49:50,009 --> 00:49:51,044
All right.

568
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:53,283
Bye.

569
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,202
He doesn't even know who the hell I am.

570
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:51,598
-Remember, mother used to say, " Bobby..."
-Ex cuse me.

571
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:53,601
-Go ahead.
-Ex cuse me.

572
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:57,518
I was going to ask Robert how long
it had been since he'd been away.

573
00:53:57,769 --> 00:53:59,441
Three years.

574
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:01,839
No, it's more like two years, isn't it?

575
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:03,681
It's been more than that.

576
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:07,245
Tita, you have no sense of timing
away f rom the piano, dear.

577
00:54:07,689 --> 00:54:09,088
I don't think that's true.

578
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:10,563
It's true.

579
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,327
What have you been doing?

580
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:16,245
Odd jobs. I work here and there.
Nothing too interesting.

581
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:18,442
You no longer play at all?

582
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:20,362
Before my misfortune...

583
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:23,037
I'm not sure
you're aware of my accident.

584
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:24,927
Tita was telling me about it.

585
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,084
It's difficult...

586
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:28,007
...for me to turn my neck.

587
00:54:28,249 --> 00:54:30,638
This way especially.
If I look at Catherine...

588
00:54:30,889 --> 00:54:33,801
...I shift the whole base
of my body around this way.

589
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:36,404
I was real sorry to hear about it, Carl.

590
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:39,408
I said, I was real sorry
to hear about it.

591
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,678
Anyways...

592
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,605
Catherine, what was I saying?

593
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:55,045
Yes, just after I'd come off tour
with the Betenthaller Quartet.

594
00:54:55,249 --> 00:54:57,763
Father, Herbert and I
had a summit conference.

595
00:54:57,969 --> 00:54:59,243
A summit conference?

596
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:01,923
Where was I?
Polishing silver behind the coal bin?

597
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:04,927
Well, I don't know where you were,
penis envy.

598
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:06,528
I hope I didn't hear that.

599
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:11,887
They wanted a detective to ferret
you out, and I talked them out of it.

600
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:14,603
Whatever you were doing,
you had a right to do...

601
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:19,644
...no matter how nonsensical your
ventures may be. It was that simple.

602
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,288
I really appreciate it, Carl.

603
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:25,402
I don't think you ought to imply
that Daddy was wrong in f ront of Daddy.

604
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,561
Don't force him that way.

605
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:30,762
How long have you been here?

606
00:55:31,689 --> 00:55:33,122
Only two months.

607
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:38,000
Well, satiety is my father and mother!

608
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:41,403
Carl?

609
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:45,638
If you're finished,
I think I'd like to go do some work.

610
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:47,038
Certainly, dear.

611
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:49,599
Ex cuse me. See you later.

612
00:55:50,569 --> 00:55:52,400
I hope you feel right at home.

613
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:54,201
I feel fine.

614
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:28,208
He has ways of communicating, Robert.

615
00:56:28,409 --> 00:56:33,199
I can tell when he's expressing approval
or disapproval. Just f rom his eyes.

616
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:35,047
Yeah.

617
00:56:35,249 --> 00:56:36,602
Some range.

618
00:56:37,889 --> 00:56:41,802
I can't take much more of seeing him
sitting there like a stone.

619
00:56:42,249 --> 00:56:43,204
It's not that bad.

620
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:44,923
Yes, it is.

621
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:47,800
Will you stay a while?

622
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:53,802
I don't know.

623
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:27,283
Breathe!

624
00:57:28,089 --> 00:57:29,408
All right!

625
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:33,606
Now once more, once more...

626
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:47,719
Hello.

627
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:50,961
Hi. I've been
looking all over for you.

628
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:52,807
You have? I went riding.

629
00:57:53,009 --> 00:57:53,919
Riding?

630
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:56,000
That's dangerous, you know.

631
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:57,808
Riding?

632
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:01,928
Play the piano all day and then
jump on a horse, you can get cramps.

633
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,121
Well, I like to ride.

634
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:09,208
Rain or shine, I do it any chance
I can get. It's very invigorating.

635
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:11,405
-ls it?
-Yes.

636
00:58:11,849 --> 00:58:15,239
Well, I don't like to get
too invigorated, myself.

637
00:58:15,489 --> 00:58:16,808
You don't?

638
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:18,807
What else do you do?

639
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:22,042
Well, there's fishing, boating.

640
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:25,801
There's concerts on the mainland.

641
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:29,243
I feel silly telling you this.
This is your home.

642
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:31,440
You know what there is to do.

643
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:32,843
Nothing.

644
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:35,605
Nothing?

645
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,168
Nothing.

646
00:58:38,409 --> 00:58:40,400
It must be very boring for you here.

647
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:42,207
That's right.

648
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:45,325
I find that hard to comprehend.

649
00:58:45,529 --> 00:58:47,520
I don't think I've ever been bored.

650
00:58:47,729 --> 00:58:49,208
Ex cuse me.

651
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:56,607
What're you doing right now?

652
00:58:56,809 --> 00:59:00,802
Right now, I plan to take a hot tub
and soak myself.

653
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:02,807
Then after that?

654
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:04,442
After that...

655
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:07,402
...I plan to read some music
and rest for a while.

656
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:09,401
Tomorrow, then?

657
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:13,322
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow's a f ull practice day.

658
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:15,918
But the day after tomorrow
I will be f ree.

659
00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:19,008
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.

660
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:20,648
The day after tomorrow?

661
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:22,038
Will you be f ree?

662
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:24,804
Yeah, I'll probably be f ree.

663
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:46,884
One thing I find...

664
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:49,045
...very difficult to imagine...

665
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:53,204
...is that one could have this
incredible background in music...

666
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:55,843
...and walk away f rom it
without a second thought.

667
00:59:56,089 --> 00:59:57,408
I gave it a second thought.

668
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:04,162
I mean, how could you no longer play
at all? I think that's very strange.

669
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:06,360
I played a little bit here and there.

670
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:10,403
As a matter of fact,
once I was a rehearsal pianist.

671
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:12,048
For ballet? An opera?

672
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:14,799
Las Vegas musical revue.

673
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:17,927
-You don't call that music!
-Oh, yes, I do.

674
01:00:18,169 --> 01:00:20,399
It's music, you know.

675
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:28,399
Bring on the girls
I'm singing you a song

676
01:00:44,889 --> 01:00:46,208
Are you feeling better?

677
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,400
I feel great.

678
01:00:58,609 --> 01:01:00,201
More gingerbread?

679
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:02,408
No, thank you.

680
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:07,008
Applesauce?

681
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:14,608
You know what I suggest, Ray?

682
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:16,805
Well, that's what I suggest...

683
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:20,200
...because I don't know
how long it's gonna be.

684
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:24,607
I have to go now.

685
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,198
I have to get off now, Ray.

686
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:37,647
Yeah, well...

687
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:40,642
I'll try and call you
in a couple of days.

688
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:43,198
If you're gone, you're gone.

689
01:02:43,449 --> 01:02:44,643
Bye.

690
01:02:47,489 --> 01:02:50,799
Robert, my playing put father to sleep.

691
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:53,000
Would you help me with this, please?

692
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:56,602
That's it.

693
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:05,209
You sure you should be playing, Carl?

694
01:03:05,569 --> 01:03:08,686
What do you mean?
I'm in superb shape, ex cept for my neck.

695
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:12,006
There's something f unny
about the way you move.

696
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:15,443
Well, I'm not aware of...
What do you mean?

697
01:03:15,649 --> 01:03:16,638
Two-eighteen.

698
01:03:19,689 --> 01:03:23,079
I'd hate to see you walk
across a concert stage like that.

699
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:26,325
Two-nineteen.

700
01:03:28,769 --> 01:03:32,239
I'd get somebody to coach you
on how to walk, if I was you.

701
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,480
I think it's a substantial problem.

702
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:37,808
Damn it!

703
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:40,808
Look at that.

704
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,642
Why are you being so mean?

705
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:44,168
Mean? I'm not being mean.

706
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:47,008
He does walk f unny. Don't you see that?

707
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:53,049
I don't think I'd notice.
I'm so used to Carl.

708
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:54,244
Yeah, well...

709
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:55,643
Bobby?

710
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:59,279
Do you think Spicer is attractive?

711
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:04,999
I think he's got a terrific personality.

712
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:07,561
Spicer was formerly a sailor.

713
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:09,202
Look. Don't you see that?

714
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,400
Look at that. The guy is...

715
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:14,364
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

716
01:04:14,569 --> 01:04:18,198
You see, there's nothing wrong
with my walk. Now, where were we?

717
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:20,201
At game, Carl.

718
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:31,044
Well, that's three games to Z, Carl.

719
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:33,841
What do you say about a rematch?

720
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:37,639
I thought you're going to the mainland.
You'll miss the ferry.

721
01:04:38,129 --> 01:04:42,407
Just when I was hitting my stride. Say
goodbye to Catherine for me, will you?

722
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:46,208
Can I play now?

723
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:49,646
Tell her I'll be back sometime
tomorrow probably, will you?

724
01:04:51,089 --> 01:04:52,841
Where is she, anyway?

725
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,283
Who?

726
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:57,203
Shopping in the village.
My turn!

727
01:04:57,609 --> 01:05:00,203
Why don't you and Spicer play?

728
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:06,677
Spicer?

729
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:27,002
What's the matter?

730
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,008
Nothing.

731
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:32,208
Robert...

732
01:05:35,169 --> 01:05:37,000
...would you do something for me?

733
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:40,522
Would you play for me?

734
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:43,599
Catherine, your game!

735
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:52,043
Catherine?

736
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:55,605
Will you?

737
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:24,480
That was beautif ul. I'm surprised.

738
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:26,604
Thank you.

739
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:28,806
I was really very moved, but...

740
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:32,325
What's wrong?

741
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:37,205
Nothing. It's just I picked the easiest
piece that I could think of...

742
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:41,886
...and I first played it when I was 8
years old, and I played it better then.

743
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:45,645
Can't you understand it was the feeling
I was affected by?

744
01:08:45,849 --> 01:08:46,838
I didn't have any.

745
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:49,161
You had no inner feeling?

746
01:08:49,369 --> 01:08:50,563
None.

747
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:53,838
Well, then, I must
have been supplying it.

748
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:57,837
Maybe if you supply a little more,
it might rub off on me. Who knows?

749
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:00,402
I doubt it.

750
01:09:01,209 --> 01:09:02,801
I could get interested.

751
01:09:03,449 --> 01:09:05,007
Well, I couldn't.

752
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:24,002
What does it have to be with you?
Grim and serious?

753
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:27,123
Look, you played.

754
01:09:27,369 --> 01:09:29,803
I honestly responded.

755
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:33,804
And you made me feel embarrassed
for having responded to you.

756
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:37,557
It wasn't necessary.

757
01:09:37,769 --> 01:09:41,398
Yeah, it was. I faked a little Chopin,
you faked a big response.

758
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:43,327
I don't think that's accurate.

759
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:47,568
All I've been getting f rom you is
meaningf ul looks at the dinner table...

760
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:50,283
...and vague suggestions about the day...

761
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:53,208
I am not conscious
of having given you any looks.

762
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:56,719
As for the day after tomorrow,
this is the day after tomorrow!

763
01:09:56,969 --> 01:09:59,437
And I am, unfortunately, seeing you.

764
01:09:59,649 --> 01:10:02,083
If you'll ex cuse me,
I'd like to take a bath.

765
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:04,598
-What do you want anyway?
-Some bath oil.

766
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:05,605
Some bath oil?

767
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,606
How about some avocado? Or this?

768
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:09,845
Or some of this jasmine?
How about this?

769
01:10:10,049 --> 01:10:11,118
What are you doing?

770
01:10:11,369 --> 01:10:14,600
What are you doing screwing around
with all this crap?

771
01:10:16,849 --> 01:10:20,000
I do not find your language
very charming.

772
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:22,604
It isn't. It's direct.

773
01:10:22,889 --> 01:10:24,447
I'd like you to leave...

774
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:26,600
...so that I can take a bath.

775
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,208
Is that direct?

776
01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:36,483
Serious?

777
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:39,318
Is that what's important to you?
Serious?

778
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:40,524
Yes.

779
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:42,048
Let's be serious. Sit down!

780
01:10:42,249 --> 01:10:44,001
-Don't do that!
-Shut up!

781
01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:46,646
No inner feeling?

782
01:11:14,009 --> 01:11:16,204
I told him the truth, finally.

783
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:20,401
He was my husband
and I loved him very much.

784
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:25,564
But, it wasn't working any better
the second time than it did the first.

785
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:27,847
He was a cellist.

786
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:29,522
And there was I...

787
01:11:29,769 --> 01:11:32,806
...no longer 17, looking up at him.

788
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:34,721
And I said to him:

789
01:11:34,929 --> 01:11:38,444
"Joseph, you're f ull of beans!"
And I left him.

790
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:40,600
Is that what you said to him?

791
01:11:40,849 --> 01:11:42,601
Something like that.

792
01:11:43,129 --> 01:11:47,008
As a matter of fact, Joseph introduced
me to Carl right around then.

793
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:49,677
How are you?

794
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:52,207
Incredible.

795
01:11:55,289 --> 01:11:58,565
Carl restored me. He really did.

796
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:02,444
He's much more substantial
than you give him credit for being.

797
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:07,720
Do you think you could discreetly
move across the hall now?

798
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:13,006
Yes, I think I could discreetly
move across the hall now.

799
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:25,558
Robert?

800
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:31,880
I have some f ree time tomorrow morning
before Carl gets back, if you'd like.

801
01:12:32,569 --> 01:12:34,207
Of course I'd like it.

802
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:42,605
Bananas! Bananas!

803
01:12:59,769 --> 01:13:03,808
You certainly do have a beautif ul piece
of real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.

804
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:07,848
Can he hear me?

805
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:09,920
He's not hard of hearing.

806
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,046
That's a blessing at least.

807
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:18,001
This certainly is an improvement
on the motel and the coffee shop.

808
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:21,049
How could you ever leave
such a beautif ul place?

809
01:13:21,249 --> 01:13:22,602
I don't know.

810
01:13:24,329 --> 01:13:26,638
You've been staying
in a motel all this time?

811
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:30,558
For two weeks there wasn't hardly
nobody there to talk to, but me.

812
01:13:31,209 --> 01:13:34,918
But why did you stay at the motel?
There's plenty of room here.

813
01:13:35,129 --> 01:13:36,687
Well, I was going to...

814
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:40,165
...but Bobby had to come up here
and feel it up here first.

815
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:42,248
But then it took so long.

816
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:43,848
I run flat out of money.

817
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:46,603
You didn't leave me
any number or anything, honey.

818
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:51,848
And I had to, you know,
get in a taxi and come on out here...

819
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:54,882
...in the hopes that I would not
be intruding myself.

820
01:13:55,649 --> 01:13:59,483
No, not at all.
You're perfectly welcome to stay here.

821
01:14:00,049 --> 01:14:01,801
Well, thank you.

822
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,123
That's a very nice thing for you to say.

823
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:06,958
Not at all.

824
01:14:09,289 --> 01:14:11,439
You have a beautif ul head of hair.

825
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:13,403
Thank you.

826
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:15,842
Is it natural?

827
01:14:16,089 --> 01:14:18,000
-Rayette?
-What?

828
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:20,602
Just finish eating.

829
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:22,488
Am I holding up dessert?

830
01:14:22,689 --> 01:14:25,283
No, not at all.
Take all the time you want.

831
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:27,998
I do eat slow as a bird...

832
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:31,361
...whereas Bobby can pack it away
like a speed swing.

833
01:14:33,889 --> 01:14:35,402
Is there any ketchup around?

834
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:36,684
For God's sake!

835
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,561
Please, let's not be rude.

836
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:42,800
That's okay.
He didn't mean anything by that.

837
01:14:43,009 --> 01:14:44,408
I don't, huh?

838
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:53,804
Bobby's just about the moodiest man
I've ever been with.

839
01:16:29,649 --> 01:16:30,923
Are you all right?

840
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,005
Where are you going?

841
01:16:32,249 --> 01:16:34,444
To pick up some f riends
of Carl's and mine.

842
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:35,718
I wanna talk to you.

843
01:16:35,969 --> 01:16:36,845
I'll be back later.

844
01:16:37,049 --> 01:16:39,040
I wanna talk right now.
I wanna explain...

845
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:42,440
-No, it isn't necessary!
-Yes, it is!

846
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:44,207
Come on! Move it!

847
01:16:44,409 --> 01:16:45,285
Will you shut up?

848
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:46,285
Come on!

849
01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:48,400
This is impossible. I have to go!

850
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:50,367
Will you just wait one minute?

851
01:16:52,449 --> 01:16:54,804
I haven't been being fair to Carl.

852
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:57,199
I have to tell you that.

853
01:16:58,769 --> 01:17:00,441
What? I can't hear you!

854
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:05,207
I'm sorry everything's
been so conf using.

855
01:17:05,409 --> 01:17:07,798
I'll see you later this evening.

856
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:18,685
You see, man is born into the world with
his existent adversary f rom the first.

857
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:21,357
It is his historic, mythic inheritance.

858
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:24,208
Is this startling?
Aggression is prehistoric.

859
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:26,400
An organism behaves
according to its nature...

860
01:17:26,649 --> 01:17:29,766
...which derives f rom the circumstances
of its inheritance.

861
01:17:29,969 --> 01:17:33,803
Fact remains that primitive man took
delight in tearing his adversary apart.

862
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:37,564
That is where, I think,
the core of the problem resides.

863
01:17:37,769 --> 01:17:39,566
Doesn't that seem apocalyptic?

864
01:17:40,409 --> 01:17:42,001
I do not make poetry.

865
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,166
Is there a TV in the house?

866
01:17:46,889 --> 01:17:48,117
I remarked to John...

867
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:51,878
...that rationality is not
a device to alter facts.

868
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:55,161
I think of it
as an extraneous tool, a gadget...

869
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:58,088
...somewhat like the television.

870
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,928
To look at it any other way
is ridiculous.

871
01:18:01,129 --> 01:18:03,006
There's some good things on it.

872
01:18:04,249 --> 01:18:05,159
I beg your pardon?

873
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:08,167
The TV. There's some
good things on it sometimes.

874
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:12,521
I have strong doubts.
Nevertheless, I am not discussing media.

875
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:14,128
But there is always hope.

876
01:18:14,329 --> 01:18:16,320
-For the few.
-What about love?

877
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,359
What about it?

878
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:22,365
Wouldn't you say that more ill has been
done f rom love than f rom abomination?

879
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:24,487
No. No, I wouldn't.

880
01:18:24,769 --> 01:18:28,045
Well, you are a romantic, Catherine.

881
01:18:28,289 --> 01:18:30,245
And once more about to be married.

882
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:31,802
So you can be ex cused...

883
01:18:32,049 --> 01:18:34,483
...f rom objective discussions.
But ask Carl.

884
01:18:34,689 --> 01:18:38,568
Ask him if even the institution
of marriage is completely f ree f rom it.

885
01:18:38,769 --> 01:18:39,918
Ask him.

886
01:18:40,169 --> 01:18:45,004
I think these cold,
objective discussions are aggressive.

887
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:46,119
Ex cuse me.

888
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:47,284
That's reactive!

889
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:51,319
If I may say, without dampening
the spirit of your adventure...

890
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:53,485
You haven't dampened my spirit.

891
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:55,281
-Ex cuse me.
-I should hope not.

892
01:18:55,489 --> 01:18:59,641
But it's still open to some dispute that
there seems to be less aggression...

893
01:18:59,889 --> 01:19:01,607
...or violence, if you like...

894
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:04,044
I'm sorry, I don't speak French.

895
01:19:04,249 --> 01:19:05,648
...and loftier natures...

896
01:19:05,889 --> 01:19:07,845
What kind of doggy is this?

897
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:09,562
This is a Border collie.

898
01:19:09,769 --> 01:19:13,205
I had a pussycat once.
It was a little fluffy thing.

899
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,600
Bobby gave it to me. Remember, Bobby?

900
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:19,404
The little pussycat you gave me?

901
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:20,804
Yeah.

902
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,598
Had two little white f ront paws.

903
01:19:23,849 --> 01:19:26,317
And I was crazy after her.

904
01:19:26,569 --> 01:19:28,446
We left it at some f riends' house...

905
01:19:28,689 --> 01:19:32,318
...and she got squashed flat
as a tortilla outside their mobile home.

906
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:34,520
There! Do you see what I mean?

907
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:39,441
The choice of words juxtaposed
with the image of a fluffy kitten!

908
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:43,682
The enchantment of words,
"squashed, " "flat, " etcetera...

909
01:19:43,889 --> 01:19:45,686
Well, she was.

910
01:19:45,889 --> 01:19:48,767
Perhaps. But it was just
what I was trying to point out.

911
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:50,448
Don't sit there pointing at her.

912
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:52,159
I beg your pardon?

913
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:54,439
I said, don't point at her, you creep!

914
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:55,684
But I was just...

915
01:19:55,889 --> 01:20:00,519
Where do you get the ass to tell anybody
about class or what she typifies?

916
01:20:00,769 --> 01:20:03,237
You shouldn't even be
in the same room with her!

917
01:20:03,489 --> 01:20:04,717
This is really too much.

918
01:20:04,929 --> 01:20:07,159
-Just calm down!
-You're f ull of shit!

919
01:20:08,609 --> 01:20:10,440
You're all f ull of shit!

920
01:20:14,169 --> 01:20:15,363
Catherine!

921
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:23,923
Catherine?

922
01:20:35,129 --> 01:20:37,689
I can't talk to you.
Leave me alone.

923
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:42,927
What the hell's going on?

924
01:20:43,169 --> 01:20:45,000
-What're you doing?
-What's...

925
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:47,240
Hey, where...
Where's Catherine?

926
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:49,679
I don't know where Catherine is!

927
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,368
I'm talking to you, Tita!

928
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:55,800
I told you just to take
your hands off my sister, nurse!

929
01:20:56,009 --> 01:20:57,283
Move out!

930
01:20:57,529 --> 01:20:58,484
Stop it!

931
01:20:59,249 --> 01:21:00,921
Stop it! Stop it!

932
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:02,488
Hold it, will you?

933
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:04,884
Hold it! Take it easy!

934
01:21:05,689 --> 01:21:07,008
Take it easy, will you?

935
01:21:07,249 --> 01:21:09,479
Stop it! Let him go!

936
01:21:10,089 --> 01:21:11,886
You give up?

937
01:21:16,129 --> 01:21:17,687
Do you give up? Do you?

938
01:21:17,929 --> 01:21:19,521
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

939
01:21:19,769 --> 01:21:20,997
-Give up?
-Stop!

940
01:21:21,249 --> 01:21:23,479
Give up! Give up! Give up!

941
01:21:28,129 --> 01:21:29,323
Bobby!

942
01:21:38,169 --> 01:21:40,285
I just wanted to talk to you.

943
01:21:44,969 --> 01:21:46,482
It's useless.

944
01:21:48,369 --> 01:21:50,485
Look, give me a chance.

945
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:53,004
I'm trying to be delicate with you...

946
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:55,683
...but you just won't understand.

947
01:21:56,169 --> 01:22:00,401
I couldn't go with you. Not because
of Carl, but because of you.

948
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:07,282
You're a strange person, Robert.

949
01:22:09,369 --> 01:22:11,280
I mean, what would it come to?

950
01:22:12,769 --> 01:22:16,728
A person who has no love for himself,
no respect for himself...

951
01:22:16,969 --> 01:22:21,087
...no love of his f riends,
family, work, something.

952
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:23,883
How can he ask for love in return?

953
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:25,682
Why should he ask for it?

954
01:22:28,969 --> 01:22:32,848
Living here in this rest-home asylum,
that's what you want?

955
01:22:33,169 --> 01:22:34,284
Yes.

956
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:36,485
That'll make you happy?

957
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:39,600
I hope it will. Yes.

958
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:46,687
I'm sorry.

959
01:23:16,369 --> 01:23:17,563
Okay.

960
01:23:36,289 --> 01:23:37,688
Are you cold?

961
01:23:56,689 --> 01:23:58,520
I don't know if you'd be...

962
01:23:58,769 --> 01:24:02,284
...particularly interested
in hearing anything about me.

963
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:06,560
My life, I mean.
Most of it doesn't add up to much...

964
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:11,001
...that I could relate as a way
of life that you'd approve of.

965
01:24:12,769 --> 01:24:14,885
I move around a lot.

966
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:20,078
Not because I'm looking
for anything, really...

967
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:25,727
...but because I'm getting away
f rom things that get bad...

968
01:24:25,969 --> 01:24:27,687
...if I stay.

969
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:32,243
Auspicious beginnings,
you know what I mean?

970
01:24:47,289 --> 01:24:49,484
I'm trying to imagine you're...

971
01:24:49,929 --> 01:24:52,489
...you're half of this conversation.

972
01:24:55,369 --> 01:24:57,678
My feeling is, I don't know...

973
01:24:58,769 --> 01:25:02,682
...that if you could talk,
we wouldn't be talking.

974
01:25:05,089 --> 01:25:08,684
It's pretty much the way
that it got to be before I left.

975
01:25:12,569 --> 01:25:13,479
Are you all right?

976
01:25:17,569 --> 01:25:19,685
I don't know what to say.

977
01:25:25,889 --> 01:25:28,005
Tita suggested that we try to...

978
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:29,398
I don't know.

979
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:31,685
I think that she feels...

980
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:34,609
I think that she feels that we've got...

981
01:25:34,849 --> 01:25:37,488
...some understanding to reach.

982
01:25:40,809 --> 01:25:42,447
She totally denies the fact...

983
01:25:42,649 --> 01:25:46,881
...that we were never that comfortable
with one another to begin with.

984
01:25:58,609 --> 01:26:01,282
The best that I can do is apologize.

985
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:08,878
We both know that I was never
really that good at it anyway.

986
01:26:17,569 --> 01:26:19,685
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

987
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:27,723
Bobby!

988
01:26:29,169 --> 01:26:30,682
You're leaving?

989
01:26:31,049 --> 01:26:34,280
Yeah. I said a week.
I think I overstayed myself.

990
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,049
You were going without
saying goodbye to me.

991
01:26:37,569 --> 01:26:39,878
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.

992
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,487
But what about me?

993
01:26:43,729 --> 01:26:46,084
I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.

994
01:26:47,049 --> 01:26:48,528
Oh, Robert!

995
01:26:50,769 --> 01:26:52,168
Watch the birdie!

996
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:57,763
Bye.

997
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:01,045
Come on, Ray.

998
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:04,207
I want to take a picture
of us in f ront of the place.

999
01:27:04,449 --> 01:27:05,643
Not now, Ray.

1000
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:10,319
Listen, I never got to
thank you all for your hospitality.

1001
01:27:10,569 --> 01:27:15,484
Tell Carl if any of you wanna come to
our place, you'll be more than welcome.

1002
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:18,882
Bye, now.

1003
01:27:37,129 --> 01:27:41,122
Your kiss is like a drink

1004
01:27:42,129 --> 01:27:44,927
When I am thirsty

1005
01:27:46,569 --> 01:27:51,484
Oh, and I'm thirsty for you

1006
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:55,249
With all my heart

1007
01:27:57,969 --> 01:28:01,166
But don't love me then pretend

1008
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:05,045
As though we've never kissed

1009
01:28:06,969 --> 01:28:08,880
Don't touch me

1010
01:28:16,569 --> 01:28:18,480
Don't touch me

1011
01:28:28,849 --> 01:28:30,282
Cut it out!

1012
01:28:30,969 --> 01:28:32,880
Son of a bitch, Bobby!

1013
01:28:33,089 --> 01:28:35,319
You quit pushing me away like that!

1014
01:28:35,569 --> 01:28:38,879
I've had enough of that
to last me an entire lifetime!

1015
01:28:39,489 --> 01:28:42,287
Why don't you just
be good to me for a change?

1016
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:53,284
There isn't anybody gonna look
after you and love you as good as I do.

1017
01:28:59,569 --> 01:29:01,287
Did you hear me?

1018
01:29:01,489 --> 01:29:02,683
Baby?

1019
01:29:25,769 --> 01:29:28,681
I'm going to that café for some coffee.

1020
01:29:29,169 --> 01:29:30,887
You want anything?

1021
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,484
No.

1022
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:37,281
You got any change?

1023
01:29:45,849 --> 01:29:47,680
You don't have any change?

1024
01:29:59,289 --> 01:30:01,678
Sure you don't want anything?

1025
01:30:03,089 --> 01:30:04,488
Fill it up, will you?

1026
01:31:43,849 --> 01:31:44,884
Hey, wait!

1027
01:32:07,169 --> 01:32:09,478
Don't you got a jacket
or anything with you?

1028
01:32:09,889 --> 01:32:11,083
No.

1029
01:32:11,369 --> 01:32:12,563
Jesus!

1030
01:32:12,969 --> 01:32:14,288
Got burned up.

1031
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:17,686
Everything in the car
got the shit burned out of it.

1032
01:32:18,089 --> 01:32:18,919
Everything.

1033
01:32:19,169 --> 01:32:21,125
All I got is what I got on.

1034
01:32:21,329 --> 01:32:23,559
I got one behind the seat
if you want it.

1035
01:32:23,769 --> 01:32:25,282
No, it's okay.

1036
01:32:26,129 --> 01:32:27,084
Suit yourself.

1037
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:28,688
Tell you one thing.

1038
01:32:28,889 --> 01:32:31,608
Where we're going
it's gonna get colder than hell.

1039
01:32:31,849 --> 01:32:33,043
That's okay.

1040
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:35,523
I'm fine.

1041
01:32:36,929 --> 01:32:38,123
