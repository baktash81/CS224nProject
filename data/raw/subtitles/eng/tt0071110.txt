1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,380
Hey there.

3
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,135
- How was Europe?
- Oh, it's still there.

4
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,722
Except for France.
She's not sore at us any more.

5
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,809
I hoped you'd have a couple of hours.
I'd like to talk about something.

6
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,937
Honey, in a couple of hours
I'll be halfway to LA.

7
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,440
The directors can't wait for these reports.

8
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:14,569
But, uh... I can do wonders in 30 minutes.

9
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,947
Well, I can't.

10
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,368
We'll have to wait till tonight.
What flight are you on?

11
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,661
The red-eye special.

12
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,248
Alan, why don't you wait and fly with me?

13
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,543
I'll have my work all finished
by the time you get there.

14
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,463
I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk now.

15
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:40,679
It didn't feel to me like you were
interested in talking just now.

16
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,518
Are you back on that same old kick about us?

17
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,687
If that's what you wanna call it.

18
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,565
- Come on. What's all the rush?
- Rush?

19
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,320
I've been on this particular kick
for six years now.

20
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,240
Maybe I'm tired of one-night stands.

21
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:07,205
Baby, I've only got half an hour.
Can't we talk it out when you get to LA?

22
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:12,002
Don't miss your flight, Murdock. You wouldn't
wanna keep that boss of yours waiting.

23
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,254
But...

24
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,654
- Will you be returning?
- I can't tell. My life is a surprise.

25
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,698
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

26
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:29,162
Imagine getting gussied up like this
to watch a lot of Supreme Court judges chew.

27
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,499
Miss Swanson,
what is the secret of your eternal youth?

28
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,418
I take natural food.
I will not have poisoned food.

29
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,004
It's not good for anybody.

30
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,006
Just one more question.

31
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,677
{Y:i}Northwest passenger Janet Satterly...

32
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,723
- Who is she? Do you recognise her?
- One of those Hollywood persons.

33
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,269
- Oh. You mean an actress?
- Or worse.

34
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:07,701
{Y:i} Mr Kelly, line six, please.
Mr Kelly, line six.

35
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,788
{Y:i}Columbia Airlines Flight 10
for Albuquerque and Denver...

36
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,375
{Y:i}- Kelly here.
- Dr Weiner. Jefferson Memorial Hospital.

37
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,419
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

38
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,922
We have a patient on the way out there,
Janice Abbott.

39
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:25,468
{Y:i}- She's booked on Flight 409 for LA.
- Oh, yes. Everything's been set for her.

40
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,848
I wanted to let you know
that the ambulance was late in getting away.

41
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,893
No need to worry about that.
If we have to delay departure, we will.

42
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:39,107
Thank you. She's scheduled
for a transplant and the kidney's in LA.

43
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,860
She can't be off the dialysis machine too long.

44
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,486
{Y:i}Yes, Doctor...

45
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,281
I want you to understand the urgency.

46
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,868
{Y:i}- We'll take good care of her, Doctor.
- Thank you.

47
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,081
{Y:i}-  Yes, sir?
- Check Columbia maintenance.

48
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,752
Make sure the arrangements
for the kidney patient on 409 are set.

49
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,420
{Y:i}Yes, sir.

50
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,965
You really want to sail a 35-footer
all the way to Hawaii?

51
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,635
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing, if you have an all-girl crew.

52
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,679
My first mate wouldn't dig that.

53
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,433
- What's his problem?
- Hers. The first mate's my wife.

54
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,685
Well, I can dig it.

55
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,648
Oh, that's nice. Nice, nice, nice.

56
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:25,236
Conserve your energy, Urias.
I hear we can expect a bumpy ride tonight.

57
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,906
I knew a stewardess
who thought that was sexy.

58
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,450
You're weird. You know that?

59
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,540
- How do you get rid of this jet lag?
- You just do.

60
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,460
- Why, are you still tired in the morning?
- Uh-huh.

61
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,921
Give it a couple of months.

62
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,050
- Hey, do we have a sexy crew tonight?
- I don't check any more.

63
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,763
- It'll be a change from Ogallala, Kansas.
- Isn't everything?

64
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,307
There. See why I love my job so much?

65
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,895
- They sure have all the right equipment.
- But it would be wrong.

66
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,023
How are your, uh... kids and your wife, Julio?

67
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,651
Watch out for that one, Gary.
She's got seniority.

68
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,655
- What about the teenager?
- It's Ms Teenager, please.

69
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,033
I'm emancipated and highly skilled in kung fu.

70
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,411
Whatever happened to womanhood?

71
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,957
Hey, that's enough. The convention's over.
I want you to taper off. No more.

72
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,875
You should have stuck to Blue Nun.

73
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,212
- We got a plane to catch, Sammy boy.
- We got a plane.

74
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:29,009
- Bartender, another one. All around.
- Hey, no more, Arnie. We got a...

75
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,928
{Y:i}# California, here I come

76
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,763
{Y:i}# Right back where...

77
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,933
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Excuse me. I meant...

78
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:41,104
- Sammy.
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.

79
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,565
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Can I make amends?

80
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:48,028
- We'd like to buy you a drink.
- I'd like to buy you a drink.

81
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,364
- Maybe a little bourbon on the rocks.
- You got it.

82
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,242
Nurse, bourbon on the rocks
for the lady, please.

83
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,163
- With a small beer chaser.
- Jesus Christ, a boiler maker.

84
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,957
- Where's the flight log?
- Here, sir.

85
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,710
It's clean.

86
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,130
- No deferred items?
- Not a thing.

87
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,966
Crew chief was worried about number three.

88
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,595
- It's all taken care of, Papa.
- Well, ain't that thoughtful?

89
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,316
...contains a concert hall, an opera house...

90
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,235
Hello, Mrs Patroni. What are you doing here?

91
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,488
We saw a play at the Kennedy Center.

92
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,949
- Nice to see you again, Joseph.
- Thank you, sir.

93
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,494
The decor includes flags of all nations...

94
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,663
This thing'll never get off the ground,
never fly.

95
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,500
Young man, you think this thing won't fly?

96
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:48,213
In 1917 I was flying
in something wilder than this.

97
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,383
- You know who the pilot was?
- Wiley Post?

98
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,968
No. Cecil B De Mille.

99
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,139
We flew from Hollywood
non-stop to Pasadena.

100
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,934
On the way home we did loop-the-loops

101
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,728
so that I could see the moon upside down.

102
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,694
{Y:i} We need emergency assistance
at main artery.

103
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,614
{Y:i}Ambulance trying
to get to Columbia Airlines Flight 409.

104
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,622
You don't mind turning off
that music, do you? Thanks.

105
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,666
Get us clearance.

106
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,212
Dulles Tower, Columbia 409.
We're taxiing in five minutes.

107
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:34,050
{Y:i}- Request ATC clearance.
-  Honour request.

108
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,203
- Oh. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

109
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,290
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

110
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,501
- We got him. It's all right.
- I'm OK. I'm all right.

111
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,254
OK, yeah, right back through there.

112
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,967
- Hey, is that Spanish one really married?
- His wife thinks he is.

113
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,471
Oh, well, the other one's just as neat.

114
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,349
Eight years ago, I thought they were all neat.

115
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,809
Thank you. How are you?

116
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,107
{Y:i}- Yes?
-  Hey, mama.

117
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,569
{Y:i}Got a patch on the company wire from LA.
Some guy named Al.

118
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,739
I'll be right up. Thanks, Julio.

119
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,327
- Arlene, could you help Bette here?
- OK.

120
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,166
Hello there, Mrs Patroni. Hi.

121
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,086
Your seats are right over in there.

122
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,504
Evening.

123
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,425
- You better use code.
- Neat.

124
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,850
- Hello, Alan.
- Hey, honey.

125
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,937
{Y:i}- I'm not getting you in trouble?
- I don't think so.

126
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,774
That's what I've been trying to do for years,
but you're too smart.

127
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,278
- Alan, what is it?
- I didn't like the way we said goodbye.

128
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,323
I don't remember anybody saying goodbye.

129
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,992
Come on, damn it, you know what I mean.

130
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:26,121
Then why don't you tell me what you mean?

131
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,333
I guess I haven't been
too good at that, have I?

132
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,753
{Y:i}- You've had your moments.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,381
Look, that talk you mentioned.

134
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,719
We'll have that as soon as you get here.
I promise, huh?

135
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,387
OK.

136
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,598
{Y:i}- Have a good flight.
- Thanks.

137
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,643
Hey, I love you. Nancy?

138
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,732
- Hey, you don't look happy, baby.
- I don't know what you mean.

139
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,279
{Y:i}- We're seven minutes behind schedule.
-  I'm aware of it.

140
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,657
- What is the word?
- The ambulance should be close.

141
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:03,992
I sure hope so.

142
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,537
I got special clearance through gate four.
Keep an eye open.

143
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:11,041
OK, we'll give them a hand. Won't you, Julio?

144
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,876
Yes, sir.

145
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,378
Hold this. I'll take care of Miss Swanson.

146
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,007
- Good evening. Right this way, please.
- Thank you.

147
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,259
Hello. How are you?

148
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,346
- Good evening, Miss Swanson.
- You mean good morning.

149
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,806
Right here, Miss Swanson.

150
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,686
Yes, put it under my feet.
Thank you very much.

151
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:36,524
Pleasure to have you with us.
If there's anything I can do, let me know.

152
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,738
- Never mind her. Put your ticket away.
- Yes, Sister.

153
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,210
Sammy, will you sit down? Sammy. Sit down.

154
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,213
- I'm twisted!
- Sit down.

155
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:05,053
You're a tiny bit nervous, aren't you?

156
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,888
I know.

157
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:11,643
I've flown thousands of miles
and under very difficult circumstances.

158
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,938
I assure you
there's nothing to be worried about.

159
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,695
Oh. May I?

160
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:32,414
He's probably got something on his mind.
Probably getting it off his chest right now.

161
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,878
- Look, Sister. An ambulance.
- Oh, I hope it's not serious.

162
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,991
Clear the aisle, please.

163
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,329
Oh, how blessed I am.

164
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:18,376
Three children, seven grandchildren,
and all healthy, thank God.

165
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,965
- Put your chair in...
- Julio, this is fine.

166
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,508
Careful.

167
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,678
It's a young girl.

168
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,348
Let me take that, sweetheart.

169
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,230
- Let me take your coat.
- Oh, thank you.

170
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,827
There.

171
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,082
- You want this?
- Please. Thank you so much.

172
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,544
- Happy to have you aboard, Janice.
- Thank you.

173
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,930
Yeah, come on...

174
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,558
Gonna be a lot of laughs,
I can see that right now.

175
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,894
- Here we go, boys.
- Right around there.

176
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:22,148
- Here we go.
- The bar's closed till we get to cruising altitude.

177
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,235
- Closed?
- We're not at cruising altitude?

178
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,155
No, not yet.
Lookit, didn't I see you guys over in coach?

179
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:34,661
Yeah. Why don't we go back there
and you can fasten your seat belts?

180
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:40,083
I want a dry vodka Martini on the rocks
with a twist of lemon.

181
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:49,676
Please, Janice, remember what
the doctor said. You must lie very, very still.

182
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,721
I know, Mother, but it's so exciting.

183
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,099
The people are so interesting.

184
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,310
You'll have to turn your seat forward
for the take-off.

185
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,646
Oh. Uh... thank you.

186
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,442
- You just hold tight to that guitar.
- OK.

187
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,363
{Y:i} Columbia 409, clear for take-off.

188
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,287
We're rolling.

189
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,043
This is it. Count your beads, folks.

190
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:31,718
- I, uh... I hear Rosie Grier does that.
- Yes, he does.

191
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,253
{Y:i} Here in Gallup and surrounding areas,

192
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:11,341
{Y:i}we can expect a massive cold front
moving in from the north.

193
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,595
{Y:i}Heavy turbulence is predicted
above 15,000 feet.

194
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,391
{Y:i}Storm warnings are posted
over most of northern Utah...

195
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,353
Did you hear that, Scotty?
Looks like you're stuck here.

196
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,272
Come back to town with us
and try it tomorrow.

197
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,567
I wish I could stay.
I've enjoyed being with you fellas.

198
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,363
What's so goddamn important in Boise?

199
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:38,993
If I miss that meeting, I'll lose
about half next year's sales commissions.

200
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,414
The weather's not gonna change.
What are you gonna do?

201
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,084
Well, I know I can make it to Elko
for refuelling.

202
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,628
Maybe the weather will thin out up there.

203
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,798
OK, if you wanna break up this glamorous trío.

204
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,176
Come on. We'll help you untie.

205
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,179
{Y:i}...a massive cold front
is moving in from the north.

206
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,473
{Y:i}Heavy turbulence is predicted...

207
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,060
You look a little off-colour, Scotty.
You feeling all right?

208
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,396
Oh, I'm fine.

209
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,824
Good luck, now.

210
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:03,370
Departure, Columbia 409 out of 2,000 feet
for flight level 240.

211
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,081
{Y:i} Roger, Columbia 409. Radar contact.

212
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,960
{Y:i}Turn right to 300 degrees.
Report out at 7,000.

213
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,882
Columbia 409. Turning right to 300 degrees.
Will check out at 7,000.

214
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,929
- Landing gear.
- The light's off.

215
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,390
- Flaps.
- Up. Lights off.

216
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,975
- Engine ignition.
- Off.

217
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,061
- No-smoking sign.
- Off.

218
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,524
Departure, 409 checking out at 7,000.

219
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,778
{Y:i}Roger, 409.
Contact Washington Centre. 128.2.

220
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,448
Roger. 409. Washington Centre 128.2.

221
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,701
So long, pal.

222
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,505
Well, we've done it again, Papa.

223
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:59,676
Once again skill and daring
have overcome fear and anxiety.

224
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:05,223
Study this chapter
and don't move anything till I get back.

225
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,020
Nancy, got a couple of aspirin?

226
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,023
What's the matter? You got a headache?

227
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,483
Did you ever take a tour of Washington

228
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,903
with a ten-year-old kid
who wants to see everything?

229
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,197
Everything.

230
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,909
You sure you don't want a drink instead?

231
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,579
I'll give these ten minutes.

232
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,913
- Which one takes the sugar again?
- The neat one.

233
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,165
Oh, Julio.

234
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,961
- I'll take you into the lions' den.
- Who's afraid of that? I'm Jewish.

235
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,756
Jewish? From Ogallala?

236
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:25,553
You've got to see Gloria Swanson.
She looks terrific. Oh, hi, Nancy.

237
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:29,974
- Bette, we've missed you.
- It has been a long time, hasn't it?

238
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,227
- Thank you.
- Nobody misses me any more.

239
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,270
Well, you're onto us, baby.

240
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,524
- And I'm not?
- You're too young to know what I mean.

241
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:40,402
- I know.
- Yeah, but you're a dirty old man.

242
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,612
We need love too.

243
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:47,117
- How do you put up with them?
- I've been here so long, I don't hear it.

244
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,202
No wonder you're so good
at dodging passes.

245
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,955
She won't rise above her principles.

246
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,500
The trouble with Nancy
is she's a one-man girl. Right, baby?

247
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,628
- Right, baby.
- What a waste of talent.

248
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:02,924
- Hey! There's no sugar in this.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

249
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:05,176
- I'll just...
- This is it.

250
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:09,806
- Sorry.
- I like my coffee sweet, Mommy.

251
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,559
- See you later.
- Mm? Huh?

252
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,729
{Y:i}Ay, chicol

253
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,782
Mrs Devaney? Mrs Devaney?

254
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:31,745
There are two empty seats.
Would you like to go there?

255
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,581
- Oh, that would be nice.
- Fine.

256
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,256
Plug it in right here.

257
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,970
- Down in front, sir.
- Yes, I... I'll be down.

258
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,476
- I'm, uh... I'm in this picture.
- You're in this picture?

259
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:59,314
It's a small part, but the producer said
the next picture I'll have a bigger part.

260
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,108
Good.

261
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:08,073
- Sister Beatrice.
- It's coming up now.

262
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,785
I'm going to see if I can talk to that young girl.

263
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,163
- Pardon me, Sister?
- Yes?

264
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,291
- Don't you like the picture?
- Oh, I wasn't watching.

265
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,293
Oh.

266
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,129
Here it comes.

267
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:40,021
The picture broke. The picture broke?

268
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,192
The only reason I took the flight
was because of the picture.

269
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:48,238
It's all right. I've seen this movie.

270
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,949
- Oh, you have? How did I come out?
- Fine.

271
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,284
- I did?
- Just fine.

272
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,870
Oh, thank you.

273
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,832
- Is this a double?
- That's a double.

274
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,584
- Keep 'em coming, will you?
- Hi.

275
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,754
Excuse me. Could I say hello to the little girl?

276
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:09,175
- Um... I'm not sure... I guess so. Go ahead.
- OK.

277
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,844
- Hi.
- Hi.

278
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,096
- I'm Sister Ruth.
- I'm Janice.

279
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,432
- That's a nice guitar.
- Thank you.

280
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,602
- Do you play?
- Just a little bit.

281
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,855
What kind of music do you like?

282
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:26,693
Oh, I like, uh... I like rock music
and, uh... folk music. All kinds.

283
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,362
Me too. Would you like to try?

284
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,742
OK.

285
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,245
- Is it all right if I sit here?
- Sure.

286
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:52,344
{Y:i}# Would you take better care of yourself

287
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:59,017
{Y:i}# Would you be kinder to yourself

288
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:07,192
{Y:i}# Would you be more forgiving
of your human imperfections

289
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,030
{Y:i}# If you realised your best friend
was yourself?

290
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,453
{Y:i}# Who is always with you everywhere?

291
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:26,044
{Y:i}# Who is on your side
when others are unfair?

292
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:30,507
{Y:i}# And tell me, who will never let you down

293
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,635
{Y:i}# In any situation?

294
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:38,098
{Y:i}# Who will always see you get your share?

295
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:44,896
{Y:i}# And that's why I am a best friend to myself

296
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:51,111
{Y:i}# And I take me out whenever I feel low

297
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,366
{Y:i}# And I make my life as happy

298
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,285
{Y:i}# As a best friend would

299
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:05,041
{Y:i}# I'm as nice to me as anyone I know

300
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,296
{Y:i}# Mm-mm-mm, mm

301
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:16,219
{Y:i}# Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm #

302
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,147
Oh. Your... your book editor has a query.

303
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:31,818
In, uh... chapter two, you tell how the studios
could tell the contract stars

304
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,070
what to do and what not to do.

305
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:37,407
You had two friends
who didn't cave under studio pressure.

306
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,659
They want the names.

307
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:44,247
That's easy.
Carole Lombard and Grace Moore.

308
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:47,417
I was a rebel too.

309
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,337
Miss Swanson,
can I get you something from the bar?

310
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,465
No, thank you. I have my own. Tea.

311
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,551
- Miss Griffith?
- Yes. A Martini, please.

312
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,138
I don't believe it.

313
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,141
- Did it again.
- Who's winning?

314
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,228
You know my son, Diamond Jim.
Wins at everything, just like his father.

315
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:09,647
How long have you been
playing that game?

316
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,816
Ever since we took off.

317
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,527
Better keep him away from Vegas.

318
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,828
Hello, Mr Patroni.

319
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,085
Hi, Mr Patroni.

320
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,512
Hi.

321
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,889
What the heck are you doing down here?

322
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:46,768
What's wrong with your fancy office?
New job doesn't keep you busy, huh?

323
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,730
You know how it is.
Just like to keep my hand in.

324
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,524
I just got this crew broke in,

325
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,820
so don't go screwing 'em up
with your old-fashioned ways.

326
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,947
Whoops.

327
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,241
Oopsy.

328
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:09,165
He dropped his old-fashioned wrench.

329
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,758
Miss.

330
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:24,764
- Do you need something?
- I feel a little queasy. The altitude.

331
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,350
I'll have a bourbon.

332
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,894
With a beer chaser.

333
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:36,860
Mrs Devaney,
do you know what you just ordered?

334
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:40,071
- They call those boiler makers.
- I know.

335
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:45,535
Bourbon with a beer chaser.

336
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,872
Operator, I'd like to place a credit-card call.

337
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,377
My number is 644011537F.

338
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:58,381
Calling Mrs Scott Freeman,
same number, Boise, Idaho.

339
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,218
Area code 208.

340
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,938
{Y:i}- Hello?
-  Hello?

341
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:17,317
- Where are you?
- Elko.

342
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,361
I've been having weather problems.

343
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,364
Really, now, Scotty, don't take any chances.

344
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,158
Don't worry. How is the weather there?

345
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,911
The moon's out, but there are clouds around.

346
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,830
Well, there's a squall line going through here.

347
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,500
I'll wait it out and then come on home.

348
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:37,212
Look, can't you just cancel
that meeting tomorrow?

349
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,007
No way.
Those guys only come out once a year.

350
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,177
I'll find a hole in this weather
and be there soon.

351
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,262
OK. I'll wait up.

352
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,850
That'll be worth coming through
anything for. I love you, darling.

353
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,895
I love you.

354
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,509
- What's wrong, Junior?
- A vibration.

355
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,928
- In number three, huh?
- Yeah.

356
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:33,476
When we get to Los Ángeles,
you're gonna see Fifi. Give me a little kiss.

357
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,104
That's good. Now...

358
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:40,442
I guess everybody had given up hope,
including the doctors.

359
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,278
Nobody expected me to live.

360
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:47,615
But, then, I've never done anything
I was expected to do.

361
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,836
- Is everything OK?
- Yes. Fine, thank you.

362
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:32,535
I once went with a girl
who was half-French and half-Chinese.

363
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,246
I came home late, she ate my laundry.

364
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:44,798
I want you to be sure and tell
everyone how you irrigate those flowers.

365
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,384
Would you pour my drink?

366
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:56,017
Who do you think is gonna make it
to the Super Bowl?

367
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,479
- Well...
- Greenwood probably has an inside shot.

368
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,398
Real funny.

369
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,045
Los Ángeles Centre, Columbia 409
over Bryce Canyon at flight level 350.

370
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:28,341
{Y:i} Roger, Columbia 409.
Stand by for radar identification.

371
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:33,471
{Y:i}- We've got to sort you out. Identify.
- Sort us out or deal us out?

372
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,059
Deal us out, I hope. Sounds like
they've got more traffic than the freeway.

373
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,478
{Y:i}Columbia 409, Centre.

374
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:44,649
{Y:i}- 409. Go ahead.
- LAX reporting zero, zero.

375
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:48,570
{Y:i}The whole coastline's socked in
from San Diego to San Francisco.

376
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:54,534
Oh, well. Thank you.
We'll proceed to our alternate, Salt Lake City.

377
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:59,080
{Y:i}- Do you have their current weather?
- Yes, scattered clouds at 15,000.

378
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,751
{Y:i}For radar vector, turn right to 340 degrees.

379
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,170
Roger. 340.

380
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,697
I hope you two won't be lonesome tonight.

381
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,867
Julio, will we be lonely tonight?

382
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,541
That's it. Fly on.

383
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,896
Boise Approach, this is Barron 232 Zulu.
Do you read me?

384
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,900
{Y:i} Boise Approach. Go ahead, 232 Zulu.

385
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:13,196
232 Zulu, 40 miles south-east at 10,000.

386
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,741
VFR on top. Request landing information.

387
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:22,330
{Y:i}232 Zulu, we're fogged in here solid.
Salt Lake City is open.

388
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:27,168
Roger, Boise. Will you give me
a vector direct to Salt Lake?

389
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:30,171
{Y:i}140 degrees, turn right.

390
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,741
This is Captain Stacy speaking.
May I have your attention, please?

391
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:01,911
{Y:i}Due to extremely heavy fog
up and down the California coast,

392
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,415
{Y:i}- we're going to land at Salt Lake City.
-

393
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:09,294
{Y:i}Our estimated time of arrival
is approximately 20 minutes from now.

394
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,172
We apologise for the inconvenience.

395
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,884
We'll try and make your delay
as pleasant as possible. Thank you.

396
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:20,930
- What do you do in Salt Lake City?
- I went there once. It was closed.

397
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:24,559
- Mrs Devaney? Mrs Devaney?
- Yes?

398
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,979
Salt Lake City may be very good for you.

399
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:32,067
- It's dry there, you know.
- Dry?

400
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:37,113
Do you know that my first trip to California
took five days?

401
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,950
So if we have to spend a weekend
in Salt Lake, I'm still ahead.

402
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,996
- But we have to get to Los Ángeles.
- We'll make it all right.

403
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:49,334
Wait till I ask Dad
if this is any way to run an airline.

404
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,128
I suppose you'll wanna see
the Mormon temple.

405
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:54,839
Hey, that'd be neat.

406
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,883
You don't understand.

407
00:36:57,092 --> 00:37:01,805
She can't stay off that kidney machine
too long. She's a very sick girl.

408
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,641
We'll make it. I know we will.

409
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,895
Salt Lake Centre from Columbia 409.

410
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:11,398
{Y:i} Salt Lake Centre.
Go ahead, Columbia 409.

411
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:15,860
We're descending for a landing in your
fair city. Please alert Brigham Young.

412
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:19,239
{Y:i}Roger, 409. We have you in radar contact.

413
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:21,074
Checklist.

415
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:28,498
- We're safe from all kinds of birdies.

416
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:31,501
You're a disgrace to your race.
Do you know that?

417
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,672
{Y:i}Bueno, mi madre me quiere.

418
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,801
- What did you say?
- I said my mother loves me.

419
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,025

- Helen?
- No, thank you.

429
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:34,356
Sorry to bother you, but we're landing.
Could you put your seat back upright?

430
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:38,401
- Oh.
- And fasten your seat belts. OK, Joseph?

431
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:45,033
Excuse me.
Could you put your seat back upright?

432
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,285
- Sure, you bet.
- I'll take that.

433
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,537
Thank you.

434
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,254

439
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:23,571

00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,991

00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:37,168
{Y:i}Upon intercepting the ILS,
you're clear for approach.

444
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:50,515
Uh... pardon me.
Don't your hands ever get tired?

445
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:53,351
Idle hands...

446
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,855
By the time we land,
you'll probably have a rug.

447
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:58,940
A rug?

448
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:11,494
Salt Lake, this is 232 Zulu.
What's the big delay?

449
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,873

00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:19,979
{Y:i}Columbia 409, the Barron is at 12,030.

455
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,586
Sister Ruth!

Joseph.

460
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:09,988

- I don't know.

461
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,699
Bette, come here. Handle him.

463
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,755
Oh, my God!

465
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:54,032
- Still flying?

00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,788
Autopilot.

467
00:43:05,126 --> 00:43:07,379
- It's in "on".
- Good.

468
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,010
Altitude. Hold.

469
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,936
Get help. Radio.

470
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:27,023
I will.

{Y:i} Columbia 409, this is
Salt Lake Approach. Do you read me?

472
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:46,543
{Y:i}Do you read me? Columbia 409.

473
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:57,762
Salt Lake.

474
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,308
Salt Lake, this is Columbia 409.

475
00:44:02,517 --> 00:44:08,106
{Y:i}It's...Nancy Pryor, stewardess.
Something hit us.

476
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,317
All the flight crew is...

477
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:16,156
either dead or... or badly injured.

478
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,452
There's no one left to fly the plane.

479
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,287
{Y:i}Help usl

480
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:24,706
We read you, Nancy. Stand by.

481
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:27,542
Oh, my God! Help us!

482
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:31,629
409, this is Salt Lake.
Stay on this frequency, Nancy.

483
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,049
{Y:i}Are you flying level?

484
00:44:39,888 --> 00:44:41,514
I think so, yes.

485
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:43,767
{Y:i}- Is your autopilot on?
- The what?

486
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:45,769
Your autopilot. Is it on?

487
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:47,896
Yes.

488
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:51,024
Good. Describe the damage
to the aircraft. Over.

489
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:59,991
There's a hole ripped through the plane
on the right.

490
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,577
Just above the copilot's seat.

491
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:10,752
{Y:i}A lot of the gauges
over the engineer's...panel are broken.

492
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,047
{Y:i}The front controls seem to be all right.

493
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,592
We have you in radar contact
and you look good.

494
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,969
We'll do all we can to help you.

495
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:22,806
{Y:i}Stay on this frequency, Nancy.

496
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:28,895
I'm going down to the IFR room.

497
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,209
{Y:i} Don't panic. Stay seated,
everybody, please. Remain calm.

498
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,354
Sit down. We'll be all right.

499
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:24,993
Bette... Bette.

500
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:31,166
Now, I want you to get hold of yourself.

501
00:46:31,374 --> 00:46:36,087
We're going to have to go down there
and calm everybody else.

502
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:40,300
- What is gonna happen?
- They're gonna land the plane.

503
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:42,552
How?

504
00:46:43,553 --> 00:46:48,308
I don't know, but I want you to go down there

505
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:51,394
and tell everyone
everything is going to be all right.

506
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:54,814
We have to give them something to hope for.

507
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:08,536
I just got off the horn with the boss.
I'll handle things here! Keep this line open.

508
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:13,583
They're gonna have to make
a course correction or hit the mountains.

509
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:16,753
I want Al Murdock on this. Try his apartment.

510
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:22,342
Listen. How much time do you estimate
before a course correction is needed?

511
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,178
Ouch. All right, hang on.

512
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:29,599
Have them get Exec One ready.
We'll take the Lear to Salt Lake.

513
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,560
I understand.
We're getting Al Murdock on this.

514
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:36,106
He was our chief instructor pilot on 747 s
for four years.

515
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:38,358
I'll get back to you.

516
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:41,236
- Bill.
- It's ringing.

517
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:44,948
Look, you're gonna have to handle
the news people on this.

518
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:49,202
When the story breaks,
there's gonna be relatives and friends.

519
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:51,663
Won't the directors want you to handle that?

520
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,874
My wife and son are in that plane.
I'm going to Salt Lake City.

521
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:58,378
I'm sorry, Joe.
How the hell are we gonna get that aircraft?

522
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:01,214
I don't know.
That plane can do almost anything.

523
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:04,384
Murdock knows more about it than anybody.
Where is he?

524
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:07,387
- No answer.
- Wait. He was going out to meet 409.

525
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:09,723
- Try the VIP lounge.
- Yeah.

526
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,893
- How's it flying now?
- Autopilot.

527
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:16,646
- How much damage was there?
- Not a great deal.

528
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:20,608
There's just a big hole in it
where the pilots usually sit.

529
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:24,446
-
- Yeah? Right.

530
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,991
- Exec One is ready when you are.
- All right.

531
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:31,661
- They're paging Murdock.
- Tell him to get his ass to Exec One.

532
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:37,000
{Y:i}Al Murdock, emergency call. Al Murdock.

533
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,006
- Alan Murdock.
- Al, it's Bill.

534
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:45,800
What's up? They said it was an emergency.

535
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,052
It is.

536
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:55,769
My God. Yeah... Are you sure it's 409?

537
00:48:57,228 --> 00:49:00,732
Yeah, I... I understand. I'm on my way.

538
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,695
I'm frightened. What has happened?
Why won't you tell us?

539
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:09,824
We'll let you know as soon as
we know ourselves. There's nothing...

540
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,868
- Miss...
- What's the matter?

541
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,871
- Where are the oxygen masks?
- We're below 14,000 feet.

542
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,123
You don't need them. Everything'll be fine.

543
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:20,001
We're flying into the mountains.

544
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,630
Everything will be just fine.
Sit back and relax. We'll be OK.

545
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,174
Can I help?

546
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:42,857
Mother? Mother?

547
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,235
It'll be OK.

548
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:18,768
Darling, I'm going to see if I can help,
but I want you to stay in your seat.

549
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:21,104
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.

550
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:25,608
Oh, and Mom? Remember
the 747's the best aircraft ever made.

551
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:29,320
It can almost fly by itself.
Dad calls it the big pussy-cat.

552
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,573
I remember.

553
00:50:38,621 --> 00:50:42,834
Nancy, this is Al, honey.
We're in Exec One on the way to Salt Lake.

554
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:46,212
We've cleared this frequency.
Do you read me?

555
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:48,381
{Y:i}Yes, I read you.

556
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,717
Fine. Now, we don't have too much time.

557
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:54,888
Sit in the pilot's seat
and do exactly what I tell you.

558
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,183
O... OK.

559
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,193
Ready.

560
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:13,406
Now, look at the instrument panel.
The altimeter is marked ALT.

561
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:18,119
{Y:i}- I know that.
- What does it read, honey?

562
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,246
12,000 feet.

563
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:23,667
{Y:i}All right. The airspeed indicator is to the left.

564
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:29,005
I know that too. It's 192.

565
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:34,010
OK, honey. Take it easy.
Now I want you to find the autopilot.

566
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:38,890
Look to your right. At the top of the panel,
just below the windshield.

567
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:43,895
{Y:i}There's a switch marked autopilot.
It says command, manual and off.

568
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,022
{Y:i}- I see it.
- Don't touch it.

569
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:50,276
- Is it in manual?
- It's on manual.

570
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:51,736
It's on.

571
00:51:53,905 --> 00:51:56,032
I don't hear you, honey.

572
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,326
Nancy, press your mike button.

573
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:01,913
Yes.

574
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:06,001
Fine. Now, we don't have
anything to worry about.

575
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:09,337
We're just gonna help the autopilot
make a turn.

576
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:11,381
Do exactly what I tell you.

577
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:14,592
{Y:i}Put your hand to the right of the console.

578
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:18,555
{Y:i}- The what?
- The flat panel just below the throttles.

579
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:22,517
{Y:i}There's a grey knob
about the size of a milk-bottle top.

580
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:23,768
I see it.

581
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:27,897
OK. Now slowly turn it to the right.

582
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:43,371
Nothing's happening.

583
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:50,295
OK, honey. Try it to the left. Slowly.

584
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:03,308
It's not working. There's nothing happening.
It... it's not turning the plane.

585
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:07,729
Jesus, it's not working for turns.

586
00:53:07,937 --> 00:53:10,106
Can't you tell us what's happening?

587
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:14,944
They want us to change course,
just like I told you. It's a very simple thing.

588
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:20,950
There is a pilot on the radio telling her
what to do, telling her exactly how to do it.

589
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,040
Pardon me. What her?

590
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:29,876
The first stewardess is at the controls,

591
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:33,421
but she... she is in constant touch
with the tower.

592
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,465
The stewardess is flying the plane?

593
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:39,219
- Could you keep your voice down?
- Sure.

594
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:42,555
The stewardess is flying the plane?

595
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:45,558
Thank you, but I don't drink.

596
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,894
What difference does it make now?

597
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,980
You're right.

598
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,694
No difference.

599
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,324
Alan.

600
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:07,038
- I'm scared.
- You're doing just fine, honey.

601
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,290
There's a problem with the autopilot.

602
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:11,543
It'll keep you straight and level

603
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:14,546
but I'm gonna help you
make the turns yourself.

604
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:19,175
{Y:i}- I'm gonna turn the plane?
- No sweat.

605
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,511
Put both hands on the wheel.

606
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,432
There's a button under your left thumb.
Press it.

607
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,101
What's that?

608
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,980
{Y:i}Don't worry. That's just an alarm.
Press it again.

609
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:34,441
OK.

610
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:40,113
All right, honey. You've got the airplane.
Just hold it steady until I tell you.

611
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:44,909
{Y:i}I want you to find the artificial horizon
on the instrument panel.

612
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:49,122
{Y:i}It's the little airplane
with a horizontal line through it.

613
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,798
Alan.

614
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:01,885
I can't do this.

615
00:55:02,093 --> 00:55:05,680
{Y:i}Why not? You can do it, Nancy.

616
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:08,433
{Y:i}Nancy, come in.

617
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,687
God damn it, answer!

618
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:18,151
OK. OK, I'm gonna try it.

619
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:26,326
- You scared the hell out of me, honey.
- What do you think I am?

620
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:30,330
OK. What does your altimeter read, Nancy?

621
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,501
11,500 feet.

622
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:39,089
{Y:i}That's good. All right, now, turn to the right.

623
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:44,052
{Y:i}Turn the wheel to the right, slow and easy.

624
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,849
Turning.

625
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:53,186
{Y:i}Good. Read me your airspeed.

626
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:56,439
It's going down. It's only, uh... 184.

627
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:59,818
{Y:i}That's still all right. Just keep turning.

628
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:04,114
183. 182.

629
00:56:04,322 --> 00:56:07,283
She's climbing.
Get her nose down or she'll stall.

630
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,536
Not till she finishes the turn.

631
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:14,290
{Y:i}- What's your airspeed now?
- 180. It's on 180.

632
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:20,171
{Y:i}All right. Now turn the wheel to the left again
till it comes level.

633
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:26,678
{Y:i}Now ease the wheel forward, just a little.

634
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:29,431
{Y:i}Watch the little airplane in the instrument.

635
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:34,269
{Y:i}Don't let it fall below the line.
Wings on the horizontal line.

636
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:38,898
All right.

637
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:43,153
OK. Let the autopilot take it back now.

638
00:56:43,361 --> 00:56:46,197
Turn the switch in the top panel
back to manual.

639
00:56:51,536 --> 00:56:53,913
{Y:i}Take your hands off the wheel.

640
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:56,499
{Y:i}Is the airplane level?

641
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:59,419
{Y:i}- Yes.
- Good job, honey.

642
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:04,466
You take a rest now.
We're almost to Salt Lake.

643
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:11,973
We got a big problem. Look here.

644
00:57:12,182 --> 00:57:16,436
There's Salt Lake City and there's 409.
Look at the terrain in between.

645
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:20,774
There is no way we can talk Nancy
through those mountains to a safe landing.

646
00:57:20,982 --> 00:57:23,026
It's just too much for her.

647
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:27,530
- The only way is to put a pilot into 409.
- You mean a mid-air transfer?

648
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:31,117
A jet helicopter can keep up.
We can put a man out on a tether.

649
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:35,497
- You know what it would be to do that?
- There isn't any other way!

650
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:39,334
I think he's right. The only question is, who?

651
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,586
- Me.
- No, Al, you're too damn big.

652
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:44,297
- You gonna go shopping for somebody?
- Right.

653
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:47,217
I'll call Hill Air Force Base.
They're the experts.

654
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:52,472
You mean you're gonna try
to transfer a pilot into a 747 in flight?

655
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:56,518
Yes. We need your cooperation
and the fastest helicopter you've got.

656
00:57:56,726 --> 00:58:00,605
Now, wait a minute. You intend
to put one of our men on an umbilical?

657
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:03,358
{Y:i}- That's it.
- How's he gonna get inside?

658
00:58:03,566 --> 00:58:07,862
The way the stewardess described the hole
in the flight deck, it's big enough.

659
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:11,324
If you'll excuse me, sir,
I think it's a stupid idea.

660
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,786
That's all we've got!
What have you got to help us?

661
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:18,415
There's only one man
who's ever done anything like this.

662
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:22,252
Major John Alexander in Air Rescue.
I could try to contact him.

663
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,754
Who is your commanding officer?

664
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:30,010
- Uh... Colonel Moss, sir.
- Thank you. This is Exec One out.

665
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:36,975
Now the question is, can we get there in time?

666
00:59:14,095 --> 00:59:16,931
{Y:i} Columbia 409, Salt Lake Approach.

667
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,893
{Y:i}We need another instrument reading, Nancy.

668
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:22,520
{Y:i}Come in, Columbia 409.

669
00:59:22,729 --> 00:59:26,524
{Y:i}Nancy, come in, please. Come in, Nancy.

670
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:50,340
Salt Lake Approach, Air Force T37
Sage 14 approaching Columbia 747.

671
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:52,676
The aircraft is in level flight.

672
00:59:52,884 --> 00:59:57,305
The flaps are about ten degrees since
the collision occurred during descent.

673
00:59:58,348 --> 01:00:01,893
Look, Mom, there's another airplane out there.

674
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:05,146
- Where?
- Right out there.

675
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:11,611
- Oh... my God, there is.
- An air-force jet.

676
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:19,035
Jesus Christ, you can't believe this.
There's a big hole in the flight deck.

677
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:21,788
Doesn't look like there's any other damage.

678
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:24,124
All four engines seem to be running.

679
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:28,378
Hard to tell instrument damage.
Most of it's near the engineer's panel.

680
01:00:28,586 --> 01:00:30,213
Front part looks OK.

681
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:33,133
He's probably checking the damage.

682
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:35,677
- I'll bet he's gonna help us.
- He is.

683
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:40,432
Can you see the fighter now, Nancy?
It should be on your right.

684
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:46,021
{Y:i}- Yes, I see it.
- He'll look you over and report the damage.

685
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:54,446
Nancy, the executive plane is landing here
now. We'll have help up to you real soon.

686
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:58,950
Good.

687
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:09,252
Do you really think they can do anything?

688
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:12,380
They'll do everything that can be done.

689
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:14,632
You betcha. My dad runs the airlines.

690
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,552
Well, almost.

691
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,889
What does he mean
about running this airline?

692
01:01:21,097 --> 01:01:24,351
My husband is vice-president of operations.

693
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:27,645
Some operations!

694
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:39,949
Uh-oh. There's a crease
on the inboard section of the starboard wing.

695
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:42,744
I see some fuel coming off the trailing edge.

696
01:01:42,952 --> 01:01:45,872
If this had happened at 20,000 feet, forget it.

697
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:52,337
Plot a rendezvous point.
Have the '47 make a 180 and bring her back.

698
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:56,257
- We gotta make sure she holds altitude.
- Colonel Moss is on his way.

699
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:59,344
- What's the fuel situation?
- We have a complication.

700
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:03,223
The air-force fighter says
there's a fuel leak in the right wing.

701
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:06,726
- Oh, damn!
- That Nancy's some woman.

702
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,146
- She'd better be.
- How much can we ask of her?

703
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:14,275
- There's a call for you, Mr Patroni.
- Everything, I guess.

704
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,278
Yeah.

705
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:22,367
Your information is correct, but we're
clearing everything out of our LA office.

706
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:25,745
Our concern is for the safety
of those people. Excuse me.

707
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:27,997
- Who's that?
- A guy named Purcell.

708
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,750
Owns a TV station.
He's sending a remote unit.

709
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,128
What? We don't have any bodies yet.

710
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:36,548
Take it easy.
We'll need all the good press we can get.

711
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:40,885
Let's go find that colonel
and get that rendezvous course plotted.

712
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:44,431
Oh. My jewel case.

713
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,143
It's bomb-proofed.
The insurance people insisted upon it.

714
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:52,188
Oh... My idea of heaven
is never to have to pack or unpack.

715
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:55,400
Why didn't I think of that before? Here.

716
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:59,279
Here. You know what?

717
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,991
To hell with the jewellery.
Let's put my book in here.

718
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,162
Thank you.

719
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,959
Here you are, my darlings. It's all yours.

720
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:17,881
I never wanted to have the damn thing
published while I was alive anyway.

721
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:30,810
Colonel, will this thing work?

722
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,772
It'll be like putting a raw egg
back in its shell.

723
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,275
Your pilot confirmed
the hole looks like it's big enough.

724
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,778
It's a hell of a risk, a long shot.

725
01:03:39,986 --> 01:03:42,489
How long before that helicopter gets here?

726
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:45,408
About ten minutes.
I gotta clear with Washington.

727
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:46,618
Make it fast.

728
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:57,671
Do we have any morphine in the first-aid kit?

729
01:03:57,879 --> 01:04:00,882
No. I'm sure we have some sedatives.

730
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:04,344
No. Help.

731
01:04:05,136 --> 01:04:08,556
- Yes, we'll help you.
- It will put you to sleep.

732
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,809
No.

733
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:18,483
Maybe... help.

734
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,822
I understand. He wants to stay conscious
in case he can help us later on.

735
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:34,749
{Y:i}Salt Lake Approach.
Do you read me, Nancy?

736
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,459
This is Nancy. Go ahead.

737
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:40,839
In a while we'll take you
through a 180-degree turn like we did before.

738
01:04:41,047 --> 01:04:44,384
Captain Murdock will talk you through it.
No sweat. OK?

739
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:51,349
{Y:i}- I'm not looking forward to it.
- Hang in there, Nancy. You'll do fine.

740
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,767
You're doing great.

741
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:56,104
{Y:i}We want you to look
at the flight engineer's panel,

742
01:04:56,312 --> 01:04:59,190
{Y:i}in the centre, just above the deck.

743
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:03,486
{Y:i}Tell us what the third
fuel-used gauge reads. Over.

744
01:05:18,043 --> 01:05:22,797
Uh... 22,500 pounds.
Why, is something wrong?

745
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:26,593
{Y:i}No, we just want to keep track
of the rate of fuel flow.

746
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:29,679
{Y:i}- We're not running low, are we?
- No chance.

747
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,640
There's always an extra amount just in case.

748
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:37,520
And the captain always adds a few
thousand pounds for his wife and kids.

749
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:39,856
{Y:i}Even his mother-in-law.

750
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,486
Nancy. Come in, Nancy.

751
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:55,080
Hello, this is Nancy. Can you hear me?

752
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,751
Come in, 409. Nancy, do you read me?

753
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:17,018
Flight 409 calling Salt Lake.

754
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:20,230
Nancy! Come in, 409.

755
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:25,819
This is Flight 409 calling Salt Lake. Come in.

756
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:35,495
-
- Columbia 409 calling Salt Lake.

757
01:06:35,704 --> 01:06:37,789
- It just went out.
- I'll try it.

758
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,583
Columbia 409. Do you read, Nancy?

759
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,919
Come in. Come in.

760
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:49,592
This is Flight 409 calling Salt Lake. Come in.

761
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,219
- Got her.
- Frequency?

762
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:53,263
125.4.

763
01:06:54,472 --> 01:06:57,934
This is Salt Lake. 409, come in.
Can you read me?

764
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:00,228
Yes, thank God.

765
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,063
What happened?

766
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:05,316
A piece of wreckage fell into the radio panel.

767
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:10,155
{Y:i}Don't change anything. Just stand by.

768
01:07:10,363 --> 01:07:14,784
Standing... Standing by.

769
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:19,539
Nancy?

770
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:26,338
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

771
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,593
- How is it down there?
- It's better.

772
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:37,891
The sight of another plane
kind of perked everybody up.

773
01:07:53,281 --> 01:07:54,824
Look.

774
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:57,410
- What is it?
- I don't know.

775
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:03,541
Looks like it's cracked.

776
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:07,587
- What's the matter?
- Some fluid's coming out of the wing.

777
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:09,923
There's gas coming out of the wing.

778
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:14,386
- I don't wanna hear that.
- He doesn't wanna hear it.

779
01:08:26,606 --> 01:08:29,359
- What the hell is that?
- That'll be Mr Purcell.

780
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:35,865
TV has arrived. He knows everybody in town.
He'll get clearance to come up here.

781
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:41,496
Leave her alone!

782
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:46,584
What are your plans?

783
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:52,048
You just sit here. I'll be back in a minute,
Mrs Freeman. And don't worry.

784
01:08:58,263 --> 01:09:00,515
- Mr Patroni?
- Yeah.

785
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:03,435
Glen Purcell, KSL-TV.

786
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:05,228
I know how busy you must be,

787
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:08,690
but we're going on
a special nationwide network hook-up.

788
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:10,108
Sorry, I'm busy.

789
01:09:10,316 --> 01:09:13,486
Sir, this happens to be a very big story.

790
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:16,573
We have Mrs Freeman downstairs
and I thought you...

791
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:18,616
Who's Mrs Freeman?

792
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:22,203
You know. The private pilot that went down.
She is his wife.

793
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,456
What the hell's she doing here?

794
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:27,584
Trying to locate her husband.
Have they found him yet?

795
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:31,838
We don't know. The highway patrol
was alerted at the time of the collision.

796
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:35,800
- Why don't you go talk to them?
- You haven't bothered to find out?

797
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,429
No. We're too busy
trying to save the 120 that are up there.

798
01:09:39,637 --> 01:09:42,849
Why don't you just let us get on with our job?

799
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:46,478
I think it would be good public relations
to talk with her.

800
01:09:46,686 --> 01:09:48,730
It was your plane that killed him.

801
01:09:48,938 --> 01:09:51,483
Listen, you son of a bitch.

802
01:09:51,691 --> 01:09:54,152
Take it easy. Joe!

803
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:56,738
Take it easy, you said. Right?

804
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:04,788
Al, sometimes the public's right to know
gives me a huge pain in the ass.

805
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:14,464
- We've got a problem, Mr Patroni.
- Yeah?

806
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:18,051
We may lose radio contact.
We can barely read her.

807
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,095
She's having the same trouble.

808
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:23,515
- What about another frequency?
- I'm afraid to let her try.

809
01:10:23,723 --> 01:10:25,558
We might lose what we have.

810
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:28,561
We gotta get started, Joe. Now.

811
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:33,149
409. 409, this is Joe Patroni.
How do you read me, Nancy?

812
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:35,443
Not very well, Mr Patroni.

813
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:43,410
- How about now?
- I can barely read you, Mr Patroni.

814
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:46,871
- Nancy, is that my husband?
- Yes.

815
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,207
Let me talk to him.

816
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:57,132
Joe? Joe, this... this is Helen.
Can you hear me?

817
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:04,097
Yeah. You're all doing a great job, honey, uh...
We're proud of you.

818
01:11:04,305 --> 01:11:09,310
{Y:i}We're, uh...we're doing everything
that we can here and we're almost ready.

819
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:12,272
We... we have faith in you.

820
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:16,776
- Uh... how is the captain?
- In pain.

821
01:11:16,985 --> 01:11:19,029
Well, he's a good man.

822
01:11:19,237 --> 01:11:21,281
How...

823
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:24,617
How's Joe Junior?

824
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,580
He's fine.

825
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,667
We love you.

826
01:11:44,846 --> 01:11:48,641
Ladies and gentlemen,
tension is thick here at Salt Lake City airport.

827
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,311
Just arriving is the air-force helicopter.

828
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:54,189
Major John Alexander
will make a dramatic attempt

829
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:58,109
to rescue 120 persons
trapped aboard the giant jet liner

830
01:11:58,318 --> 01:12:00,362
without pilot and without crew.

831
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,657
And tragedy within tragedy,
one of them a young girl dying

832
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:09,954
unless she's delivered to LA soon
for a kidney transplant operation.

833
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:15,418
Major Alexander has volunteered
to make this daring attempt.

834
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:18,755
He will be lowered on a line
from the air-force helicopter

835
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:24,219
and will crawl through the hole
torn into the body of the jumbo jet liner.

836
01:12:25,136 --> 01:12:27,180
Here they are now.

837
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:38,274
What a moment this is.

838
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,971
All right, we're ready here, Nancy.

839
01:13:08,179 --> 01:13:12,851
Remember, I'll tell you everything
you have to do. You can do it.

840
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:15,645
I can't hear you very well.

841
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:17,689
{Y:i}Take it easy, honey.

842
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:20,316
{Y:i}Very slow. Are you ready?

843
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,030
- Ready.
- All right.

844
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:27,866
We're gonna turn you around
to a new heading.

845
01:13:28,074 --> 01:13:31,369
260 degrees.

846
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:35,999
We don't want you to lose altitude,
so we'll do it very slow and easy.

847
01:13:36,207 --> 01:13:40,420
{Y:i}Now, first you have to turn off the autopilot.

848
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:42,672
{Y:i}Put both hands on the wheel.

849
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:45,800
{Y:i}There's a button under your left thumb.

850
01:13:47,802 --> 01:13:49,012
{Y:i}Press it.

851
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,641
There, now, honey. You've got the airplane.

852
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:57,687
{Y:i}Now, read me your compass heading.

853
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:02,734
Compass? OK. The arrow is on the S.

854
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:06,029
OK. Look at the numbers.

855
01:14:06,237 --> 01:14:10,992
We're gonna turn until it reads 260 degrees.

856
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:13,244
{Y:i}Are you ready?

857
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:18,166
{Y:i}- Ready.
- Turn the wheel to the right.

858
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:21,753
{Y:i}Easy, now. Not too much.

859
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:29,928
{Y:i}You're doing fine, honey.
Just watch the little plane on the horizon.

860
01:14:30,136 --> 01:14:31,554
I'm watching.

861
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,852
Now, read me the altimeter.

862
01:14:40,146 --> 01:14:42,524
8,000 feet. Eight.

863
01:14:42,732 --> 01:14:46,194
{Y:i}Read it again, honey. Read it as it changes.

864
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:50,365
Seven-nine, seven-eight...

865
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:54,703
She's gotta get that altitude back.
She's only got 1,500 feet.

866
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:59,457
Keep turning just the way you're doing, honey,

867
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:02,252
but at the same time ease the wheel back

868
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,089
{Y:i}till you see the little plane lift up a bit.

869
01:15:08,633 --> 01:15:11,344
Nancy, have you done that?

870
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,054
Yes, I think so.

871
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:16,433
What's your airspeed?

872
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:23,773
18... 188.

873
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:25,817
188. Do you read me?

874
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:28,319
I read you fine, honey.

875
01:15:28,528 --> 01:15:31,364
Now, what's your heading?
Your compass heading.

876
01:15:33,074 --> 01:15:35,869
240. 240.

877
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:41,207
There's a 13,000-foot mountain
right in front of her.

878
01:15:46,546 --> 01:15:48,757
Read me that again, Nancy.

879
01:15:50,258 --> 01:15:54,012
{Y:i}That's 255. 255.

880
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:59,642
All right. Ease the wheel
to the left now, Nancy. To the left a little.

881
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:02,520
{Y:i}Nice and slow, not too much.

882
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:12,322
Tell me what's happening, Nancy.

883
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:15,450
Press your mike button, honey.

884
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:22,082
We're turning back. The little airplane
is tilting to the left. I mean back.

885
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:28,463
{Y:i}All right, that's fine. Now, bring it back
to level. Watch the little airplane.

886
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,507
All right, level now.

887
01:16:30,715 --> 01:16:35,387
What's the airspeed now?
The airspeed. Read it to me.

888
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:38,139
180.

889
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:42,727
- Now the altimeter.
- It's just over 10,000 feet.

890
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:44,979
She's still too low.

891
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:47,440
Let George take it back now, Nancy.

892
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:50,360
{Y:i}Put it back on autopilot.

893
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,989
{Y:i}You're doing just great, honey.

894
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:57,450
That helicopter's ready, gentlemen.

895
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:03,373
The helicopter's ready. We're taking off now.
We'll be with you in a little while.

896
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:06,668
She's gonna
take the tops off those mountains.

897
01:17:06,876 --> 01:17:09,963
- It's gonna be tight.
- You want to take it, Joe?

898
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:14,342
- I'm going with you, Al.
- I can do it.

899
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:20,724
Her altitude's critical. For God's sake, watch it.

900
01:17:20,932 --> 01:17:23,810
We've been damn lucky so far.
Let's not push it.

901
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,062
Try not to rattle her.

902
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:32,485
{Y:i}All right, now, Nancy,
we're gonna watch your altitude.

903
01:17:43,955 --> 01:17:48,793
Drama. And all of you across the nation
are seeing it as it happens.

904
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,172
The rescue team is going to the helicopter.

905
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,592
Gentlemen?
Gentlemen, may I have a few words?

906
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,595
How do you propose to slow the jet down?

907
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:01,639
How...?

908
01:18:57,987 --> 01:19:00,031
Nancy.

909
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:03,868
I'm scared.

910
01:19:04,786 --> 01:19:06,830
I am too.

911
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:13,378
Nancy, look!

912
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:15,338
Nancy?

913
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:18,425
Are you all right? Nancy, what happened?

914
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:35,066
Salt Lake, this is Columbia 409.

915
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:38,194
Come in.

916
01:19:39,362 --> 01:19:42,449
Salt Lake, this is Columbia 409. Come in.

917
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:46,578
409, this is Salt Lake. Do you read me?

918
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:51,332
Come in, 409. This is Salt Lake. Do you read?

919
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,711
- 409, come in, please.
- What's wrong?

920
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:59,174
I don't hear anybody.

921
01:20:01,634 --> 01:20:03,053
The frequencies.

922
01:20:04,804 --> 01:20:06,639
Salt Lake, come in.

923
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:09,559
Salt Lake, come in.

924
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:12,270
Salt Lake, come in.

925
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,023
Nancy, come in. Do you read me?

926
01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:20,820
Salt Lake, come in, please.

927
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:23,198
We've lost her.

928
01:20:23,406 --> 01:20:26,868
Why don't we have that air-force jet
try his frequency again?

929
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:31,331
There's a chance she can hear us.
I'm gonna talk her through a climb.

930
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:33,583
409, do you read?

931
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,045
They found the small plane.
It exploded on impact.

932
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:45,553
The radio's dead.

933
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:58,108
We're all alone now, Bette.

934
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:23,174
The winch will hold your position, OK?

935
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:25,427
- Got it, sir?
- Got it.

936
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:28,930
You'll find you can control
lateral movement somewhat.

937
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:31,683
Using the wind pressure against my body.

938
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:35,812
You'll have to signal us
for in and out movement.

939
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:39,399
I must have made 20 drops in Nam, sir.

940
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:43,361
But what you're gonna do
scares the hell out of me.

941
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,405
Me too.

942
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:04,632
- Nancy?
- Oh, my God!

943
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,846
Bette, we're too low.

944
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:16,144
What are you supposed to do?

945
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:21,149
I don't know. Uh...

946
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:26,321
I know they're worried about airspeed.

947
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:31,701
Now, if we climb,

948
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:35,663
the airspeed drops.

949
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:38,083
I could stall us out.

950
01:22:43,213 --> 01:22:46,633
The captain. He said he could help us.

951
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:55,684
Do you understand me, Captain?

952
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,230
Thrust levers.

953
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,110
The thrust levers. What about them?

954
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:12,075
Forward... an inch.

955
01:23:13,743 --> 01:23:16,121
A... all right. Anything else?

956
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,000
190... hold.

957
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:26,631
One... nine... zero...

958
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,801
...airspeed.

959
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:55,285
I've done a few screwy things in this outfit,
but this'll be a first.

960
01:23:55,493 --> 01:23:58,997
She'll handle a lot like that 707 tanker
you're used to flying.

961
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:03,501
Once you get her on the ground,
you're still three storeys in the air.

962
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:08,089
I'll let you know if it's true
about not making a bad landing in a 747.

963
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:11,343
Control reports 409's lost radio contact.

964
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,471
- What about the altitude?
- Had they made correction?

965
01:24:14,679 --> 01:24:15,847
Negative.

966
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:18,933
- What's our ETA at rendezvous?
- A few minutes.

967
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:21,644
They haven't got a few minutes.

968
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:53,593
- We should see her soon.
- Probably be below us. Be harder to see.

969
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:57,847
- Two minutes to ETA.
- She's gotta be out there somewhere.

970
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:28,586
There she is.

971
01:25:31,798 --> 01:25:34,551
She's flying it. She's flying it herself.

972
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:39,097
Climb, baby. Climb.

973
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,936
Look at the mountains. We're so close.

974
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:41,302
Ready, sir?

975
01:27:48,518 --> 01:27:53,023
- I'll see you in Salt Lake.
- Lower away.

976
01:28:36,941 --> 01:28:40,528
Ease him down. Just a little. Steady.

977
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:12,037
- Oh, dear God, he fell!
- God Almighty.

978
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:23,965
- Oh, God.
- Get me one of those suits.

979
01:30:24,174 --> 01:30:25,675
- But, sir...
- Get the suit!

980
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:27,218
You're not gonna do it.

981
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:30,138
- Who's gonna stop me?
- I am!

982
01:30:30,347 --> 01:30:34,017
You got anybody else up here
knows how to fly that bloody plane?

983
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:36,269
This is just plain suicide, sir.

984
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:40,148
We can't let you wear a chute.
It might pull you up into the blades.

985
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:46,529
- She's falling off.
- Tell the chopper.

986
01:30:48,823 --> 01:30:51,242
- This the tether release?
- Yes, sir.

987
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,495
She's losing altitude.

988
01:30:53,703 --> 01:30:56,664
Get me out of here before I change my mind.

989
01:32:25,503 --> 01:32:27,964
Yeah! Yeah.

990
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:42,270
He made it. The pilot's on the plane.

991
01:32:44,522 --> 01:32:48,401
Salt Lake Approach,
the pilot is now aboard Columbia 747.

992
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,445
Flying straight and level.

993
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:54,157
Your hand. I'll get you something.

994
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:56,534
- Damn, that's all we need.
- What is it?

995
01:32:56,743 --> 01:32:59,621
Number three engine's awful hot.
I'll shut it down.

996
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:02,582
Tell the passengers it's just a precaution.

997
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:04,959
- OK.
- Tell 'em, baby.

998
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:33,029
Please may I have your attention?

999
01:33:33,905 --> 01:33:38,535
Captain Murdock is now aboard
and is flying this plane.

1000
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:51,006
Please. He wants me to tell you
that everything is under control.

1001
01:33:53,383 --> 01:33:58,388
However, he will also have to shut down
one of the engines,

1002
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:02,434
- which seems to be running a little roughly.
- We're gonna die.

1003
01:34:02,642 --> 01:34:05,937
But there is nothing to be alarmed about.

1004
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:09,566
Nothing.

1005
01:34:35,675 --> 01:34:38,386
Where are you going, Arnie? Arnie?

1006
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:41,431
Come back here. Leave them alone up there.

1007
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:43,975
Look, uh... is everything all right?

1008
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:47,562
- There is a pilot on board, right?
- Yes, sir, there is.

1009
01:34:47,771 --> 01:34:50,899
I must tell him something.
I saw something out the window.

1010
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:53,193
Please, sir, you're not allowed up there.

1011
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:56,946
Please, sir, don't go up there.
I don't want you to go...

1012
01:34:57,155 --> 01:35:01,117
- What's going on?
- The gas is leaking out of the wing.

1013
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:05,538
We've got plenty of fuel in the other tanks.
Go back and sit down.

1014
01:35:05,747 --> 01:35:09,626
- What about fire? It might explode.
- There's no danger.

1015
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:12,462
- My God!
- Get him the hell out of here!

1016
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:16,549
Please, sir, we know about the fuel.
Now, it's being handled.

1017
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:19,302
It's all right. We're handling it, OK?

1018
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:23,056
Go and sit down and relax.
It's fine. I'll get you a drink.

1019
01:35:48,873 --> 01:35:52,085
Look at this. The collision wiped out
so many instruments,

1020
01:35:52,293 --> 01:35:55,171
I can't tell what's working and what isn't.

1021
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,966
We are gonna be able to land, aren't we?

1022
01:35:58,174 --> 01:36:01,803
You tell me. I don't know
if I can get the landing gear down,

1023
01:36:02,012 --> 01:36:04,889
and I can't tell if it's locked into position.

1024
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:07,308
There's nothing I can do about it.

1025
01:36:07,517 --> 01:36:09,561
How's Stacy?

1026
01:36:09,769 --> 01:36:13,106
- Not good.
- The radio too?

1027
01:36:13,314 --> 01:36:15,817
The radio's dead.
I've tried every channel.

1028
01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:19,029
Well, here we go.

1029
01:36:19,237 --> 01:36:24,409
Let's see if you can land one of these things
by the seat of your pants.

1030
01:36:45,805 --> 01:36:49,309
- How long before we land?
- Two minutes.

1031
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:55,565
Salt Lake, this is Patroni.
We're on our way down.

1032
01:36:55,774 --> 01:36:59,110
We're gonna need ambulances for the girl
and the injured crew.

1033
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:01,363
Hit the red button. Clear the field.

1034
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:14,417
Go have the passengers
fasten their seat belts.

1035
01:37:14,626 --> 01:37:16,670
Tell the giris to hang on.

1036
01:37:16,878 --> 01:37:18,922
Go do your thing, baby.

1037
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:27,889
- Are we OK? Have you heard anything?
- Nothing.

1038
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:33,770
Let's get back to work.

1039
01:37:33,978 --> 01:37:37,649
Prepare for landing. Remember
the intercom systems aren't working.

1040
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:43,029
Honey, we'll have to stow this for landing.

1041
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:45,281
I'll take good care of it.

1042
01:39:10,241 --> 01:39:12,494
Buckle yourself in.

1043
01:39:35,058 --> 01:39:38,228
They went down, baby.
Just hope they're locked.

1044
01:39:47,696 --> 01:39:50,031
Almost home.

1045
01:39:52,283 --> 01:39:55,245
- Are we landing?
- Yes, Janice.

1046
01:39:55,453 --> 01:39:57,288
I knew we'd be all right.

1047
01:40:07,757 --> 01:40:10,677
- Nancy?
- Yes?

1048
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:13,388
I love you.

1049
01:40:19,644 --> 01:40:22,105
Over the fence.

1050
01:40:55,722 --> 01:40:57,766
- Damn!
- What's the matter?

1051
01:40:57,974 --> 01:41:02,103
Brake pressure's dropping. I don't
know if we've got enough left to stop.

1052
01:41:05,607 --> 01:41:08,902
Jesus!
This mother's got ten back-up systems too.

1053
01:41:18,745 --> 01:41:20,330
He can't stop her!

1054
01:42:16,636 --> 01:42:19,931
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for flying Columbia Airlines.

1055
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,183
Unfasten seat belts. Let's go. Quick.

1056
01:42:38,992 --> 01:42:40,577
Are we here already?

1057
01:42:40,785 --> 01:42:43,413
Are we here already?
No, we've gone to Washington.

1058
01:42:43,621 --> 01:42:45,832
- Are we here already?
- What's going on?

1059
01:43:04,267 --> 01:43:08,480
The ambulance will take you to the hospital.
They're ready for the transplant.

1060
01:43:08,688 --> 01:43:11,024
All right, get in there.

1061
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,916
No, Miss Swanson.
You can't take that with you.

1062
01:43:28,124 --> 01:43:30,460
I'll... You'll get it later. Jump!

1063
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:36,341
Let's go. Get out of here.

1064
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:43,556
I really was in that picture.

1065
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:48,978
Remember when the kids walked into...
ran into the, uh... hamburger shop?

1066
01:43:49,187 --> 01:43:51,815
- I was the short-order cook.
- I don't remember.

1067
01:43:52,023 --> 01:43:54,359
One of the hamburgers hit me on the head.

1068
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:56,403
- I've got a scar.
- I believe you.

1069
01:43:56,611 --> 01:43:58,947
That's a big pussy-cat, Dad.

1070
01:44:00,615 --> 01:44:03,326
No, it's a tomcat.

1071
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:16,965
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1072
01:44:17,173 --> 01:44:21,136
Every morning is beautiful.
You're just too young to know.
