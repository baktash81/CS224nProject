with authority and nobility.

373

Above all,
he must remain impartial.

375

must make very quick decisions

please settle down.

380

Such behavior is not worthy
of a future King.

381
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:49,756
When your father was your age
he was much more serious.

382
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,505
As a matter of fact,
he would often come to my study

383
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,045

questions about history,

384
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,958
geography, grammar, mathematics.

385
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:58,942

of the kingdom,

What kind of person is this
Isabelle, whose birthday party

we're going to?

1384

will attend the party?

a feathered hat.

What chance do I have of being
noticed by the Prince?

1401

Why don't you simply ask
Cinderella

1402
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:08,478
to change the decoration
for you?

1403
00:59:08,513 --> 00:59:09,973

by now.

1404
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,888
She should be quick.

1405
00:59:11,922 --> 00:59:13,627
These feathers
are definitely wrong.

1406

There are dozens of girls
wearing feathers like these.

how the other girls

1408

every day and send them

1672
