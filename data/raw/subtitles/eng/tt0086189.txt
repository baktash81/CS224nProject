00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,848
{\an8}- [Charles] This is Charles Blackman,

00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:17,184
{\an8}flashing to you
{\an8}"News On The March."

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,395
{\an8}Hidden cameras recorded
{\an8}this sensational scene

7
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,147
{\an8}of bootleggers in action.

8
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:25,818
{\an8}The mystery bigshot racketeer
{\an8}is in for a big surprise.

9
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:27,862
{\an8}Watch these mobsters
{\an8}closely, folks,

10
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,698
{\an8}because in a second the
{\an8}mighty hand of justice

11
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:33,534
{\an8}is going to deal them a
{\an8}blow they'll never forget.

12
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,706
(bricks thudding)
(suspenseful music)

13
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,207
(group yelling)

14
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:45,004
Yes, it's him, Captain
Invincible, the Man of Magnet.

15
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,214
The game's up for these bozos.

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,426
The Captain, knowing our
cameras would be there,

17
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:53,262
gave us these exclusive
shots of himself in action.

18
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,306
Thanks, Cap.

19
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:58,976
With you around, we know
gangsters are living in fear.

20
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,270
No one is immune from prosecution

21
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,107
when the Legend in
Leotards decides to strike.

22
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,943
(water splashing)

23
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,535
It's history,
it's "News On The March."

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,663
Captain Invincible,
the hero of our day.

25
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,502
- [Reporter] The Air Force
released this sensational film

26
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:27,213
of Captain Invincible in flight,

27
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,423
on the way to an aerial encounter

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,218
that Hitler and Germany
will never forget.

29
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,429
While Grand Fuhrer Hitler

30
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,099
and an industrialist crony
watch a rally,

31
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,143
his planes are on blitzkrieg war path.

32
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,938
(plane engine roaring)

33
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:48,359
These Luftwaffe Nazis
are killers in the sky.

34
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,946
The following scenes, some
of the most amazing footage

35
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,906
filmed in the war so far,

36
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,450
have been censored for
security reasons.

37
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,620
But one thing is for sure:

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,997
the krauts will never forget the day

39
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,251
the Man of Magnet read them
the funnies.

40
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,420
Give 'em hell, Cap.

41
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,257
(suspenseful music)

42
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:14,385
- [Pilot] Mein Gott!
What is that?

43
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,471
(speaking in German)

44
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,935
- [Reporter] This Stuka
is in for his last dive.

45
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:26,939
These demons of destruction
can terrify no more.

46
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,943
And it's one more wall
prize for the Captain.

47
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,777
(artillery fires)

48
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,780
(pilot speaking in German)

49
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,282

50
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,869
(pilot speaking in German)

51
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,333
(pilot speaking in German)

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,298
From the Atlantic to the Pacific,

53
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:55,843
no Axis plane is safe from Invincible.

54
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,138
See you later, Captain.

55
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,557
We're glad you're on our side.

56
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:05,186
It's auf Wiedersehen for Fritz!

57
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:08,564
(upbeat music)

58
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,775
"News On The March" cameras
recorded Captain Invincible's

59
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,528
recent visit to Camp Eisenhower.

60
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,948
These pint-sized heroes are about

61
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,743
to learn a few old tricks from their idol.

62
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,744
- Let's see you do it.

63
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,537
Rub as fast as you can.

64
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,872
(wood rattling)

65
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:27,208
(laughs) Watch this, now.

66
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,210
I'll show you some speed.

67
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,377
Get it in the hole.

68
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,420
(wood rubbing)

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,340
(group chattering)

70
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,429
(fire crackling)
(group cheering)

71
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,807
(group clapping)

72
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,976
Who's got the marshmallows, huh?

73
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,810
So long, folks.

74
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,562
- [Reporter] The Captain had some words

75
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,482
of wisdom for kids everywhere.

76
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,108
- What are you gonna be
when you grow up, son?

77
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,903
- I wanna be just like you, Captain.

78
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,030
- Well, that just might not be possible.

79
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,490
- Oh, well, I'll just have

80
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,991
to be President of the United States.

81
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,534
- A very fine ambition, lad.

82
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,744
When you do get to be President,

83
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,205
you can feel free to call
on me anytime you like.

84
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,418
Yessir, folks, as long as we keep

85
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,254
on taking care of this country,

86
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,464
this country will keep
on taking care of us.

87
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,716
(flesh hissing)

88
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,093
- Hallelujah.

89
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,761
- You can wave, now.

90
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,888
- [Reporter] Keep up the good work, Cap.

91
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,475
- [Michael] The country was stunned

92
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,769
last week when Captain Invincible

93
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,398
had to face accusations of disloyalty.

94
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:34,316
The Captain showed his anger

95
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,819
but millions asked themselves,

96
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,947
what was this hearing really about?

97
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,533
- [Senator] All we want
is a simple answer.

98
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,202
What were you, a presumably
patriotic American,

99
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,122
doing inside communist Russia
on the date in question?

100
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,627
- I'll be happy to tell you, Senator.

101
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,088
I was wiping out the
3rd Panzer Division

102
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,882
and two Waffen-SS units
single-handedly.

103
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,967
That's what I was doing.

104
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,176
- [Senator] Very impressive.

105
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,678
Just what motivated you to go

106
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,888
and fight Stalin's battles for him?

107
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:05,848
- What? What?

108
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,518
- Senator, I object to your
implication that my client was--

109
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,562
- [Senator] Captain Invincible,
you admit

110
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,397
that you're a premature anti-fascist.

111
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
I think you're more than that.

112
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,402
I notice you wear a red cape.

113
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,321
What made you pick that particular color?

114
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,239
- It might surprise you to know,
Senator,

115
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,366
that red, white, and blue
are the colors of the flag

116
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,951
of the United States of America,

117
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,412
a country that you and I should
both be proud to live in.

118
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,289
- [Senator] Don't hide
behind the flag, Captain.

119
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,832
Answer the question.

120
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,000
And while you're at it,

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,919
why don't you tell us where
you got that title Captain?

122
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,839
According to my records, you
never served a single day

123
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,924
in the armed forces of this great nation.

124
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,552
In just whose service
are you captain, Captain?

125
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:48,265
- Mr. Chairman, in view of
the testimony of the effect

126
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,934
that you receive no money whatsoever,

127
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,270
I'd like to request that the
committee now take action

128
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,855
and ask the Justice Department

129
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,774
to return an indictment for perjury.

130
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,026
This will serve a double purpose.

131
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,738
It'll also notify all future witnesses

132
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,114
that they must tell the truth,

133
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,115
and that we are serious.

134
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,992
We've had too much experience with,

135
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:10,120
met witnesses with very,
very faulty memory.

136
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,248
- [Michael] But the Captain
walks out in disgust.

137
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,543
(dramatic music)

138
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,378
(group chattering)

139
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,338
- What's your reaction to the charges?

140
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,923
(camera clicks)

141
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,466
- These charges are part

142
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,969
of a government conspiracy
against my client.

143
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,388
- Conspiracy?
- That's, that's what I said.

144
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,766
For example, impersonating
a military officer;

145
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,060
flying without a pilot's license;

146
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,478
wearing underwear in public.

147
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,982
This whole thing is a, a tissue of lies

148
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,778
designed to intimidate
and demoralize my client.

149
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,822
- Have they?
(group chattering)

150
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:45,697
- I'm sorry, what was that?

151
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,157
- [Reporter] Is he demoralized?

152
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,576
Is that why he wasn't at
this morning's hearing?

153
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,205
- No further questions.

154
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,417
(dramatic music)

155
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,794
- [Michael] America
was astonished last week

156
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,838
when Captain Invincible, under

157
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,466
a cloud of allegations
and charges, vanished.

158
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,093
Where is the Captain?

159
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,847
The familiar figure of
the Legend in Leotards

160
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,933
flying over Manhattan is no more,

161
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,437
and this little kid
isn't too happy about it.

162
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,108
- Hello, America.

163
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,319
This is Michael Lang
reporting from Australia,

164
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,156
where the wayward American
Skylab Space Station

165
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,741
has come to a fiery end.

166
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,120
With me now is one of the locals.

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,789
Sir, did you see Skylab when it fell?

168
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,623
- Yes, I did.

169
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,333
- You did.

170
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,168
Would you mind just--
- I was flying

171
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,337
through the air, and
this en-enormous object

172
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,466
come hur-hur-hurling at me
at great speed.

173
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,342
- Thank you very much.
- I attempted to catch it.

174
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,177
- Catch it, yes, good work, sir.

175
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,846
- But it was going with such great speed.

176
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,680
- Yes, sir, thank you.

177
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,806
- That it threw me violently-

178
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,724
- Thank.

All targeted neighborhoods

222
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,381
We shall therefore proceed

223
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:17,302

At 1000 hours,

239
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,134
that's a little more
than two hours from now,

240
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,345
the president arrives with
the top defense chiefs,

241
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,974
and, over my objections, the
Australian prime minister,

242
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,768
for a limited inspection tour.

00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,480
Washington wants to cut our
secret development budget.

244
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,526
So we will demonstrate the hypno-ray.

245
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,487
I don't like this, but
it's that or our jobs.

246
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,656
We have to impress the top brass.

247
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,367
You all have your schedules,

248
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,537
so nothing can possibly go wrong.

(gun banging)
(siren wailing)

252
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,221
- Follow me, Mr. Prime Minister.

253
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,681
- Are you sure, are you
sure you want me to come?

254
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,683
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure,
come on, come on.

255
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,059
- As, as prime minister of Australia,

256
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,145
I should get back to the caravan.

257
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,939
- The generals are already
in there, goddammit,

258
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,107
so let's go.

259
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,818
I wanna know what the
hell's been happening here!

260
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,652
- I concur.

261
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,197
I wanna know what the, what
the hell's been happening here.

262
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,158
- Well, certainly not
your routine robbery,

263
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,451
but I still don't see

264
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,245
why it poses a threat
to national security.

265
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,707
- It was used to, uh,
to, uh, steal the, uh.

266
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,292
- Not the hypno-ray.

267
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,419
- I'm afraid so, Mr. President.

268
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,547
- How effective is the hypno-ray?

269
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,342
- The hypno-ray, as its name implies,

270
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,302
is a device which reverses

271
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,347
the normal relationship of brain to eye.

272
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,057
By affecting the eye of the victim,

273
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,435
his or her brain can be compelled to want

274
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,814
or even desire any physical object.

275
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,736
- Could they pull it to
pieces and, and study it?

276
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:43,114
I mean, uh, could they
build another hypno-ray?

277
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,157
- They could.

278
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,951
- I concur.

279
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,161
- I'll, I'll, uh, concur, uh, too,

280
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:48,995
if you want me to.
- Well, that means

281
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,121
that we could have-
- Uh, I concur, I-

282
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,124
- A dozen hypno-rays, 50 hypno-rays.

283
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:53,959
Oh, good Lord,

284
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,127
whoever has that device
could strike anywhere.

285
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,337
- Nuke them.

286
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,463
- Nuke who, dummy?

287
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,257
We don't know who has the goddamn thing.

288
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,592
- Cruise missile seek and pinpoint.

289
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,927
- Pinpoint what?

290
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:04,845
Pinpoint who?

291
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,848
- This is obviously a Soviet mission.

292
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,100
They have acquired the hypno-ray

293
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,105
to turn all our agents around
and use them against us.

294
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,356
- Exactly.

295
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,190
- I concur.

296
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,233
- So do I, dammit.

297
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,901
- I'll, I'll concur if you-

298
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,528
- We're wasting time here.

299
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,446
Whatever they stole the damn thing for,

300
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,823
we've got to get it back.

301
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,867
- Let's nuke the ruskie sons of bitches.

302
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:27,701
- Yeah.

303
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,452
- Blast 'em all to hell and gone.

304
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,704
- Submarine missile attack-
- Yes.

305
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,538

306
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:36,042

- [Connie] Excuse me, officer.

365
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:04,649
- [Patty] Yes, Connie.

366
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,067
- [Connie] Oh, he's back again.

367
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,445
- Same as last week, huh?

368
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,196
- Yeah, and the week before that.

369
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,450
- Thank you.

370
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,784
- [Connie] That he's a bloody nuisance.

371
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,077
- Why?
- He's been sitting

372
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,996
in that doorway, carries on,

373
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,372
and says the most dreadful things.

374
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,375
(Connie chattering)

375
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,671
- Okay, let's go, colonel.

376
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,423
You're blocking the traffic.

377
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,925
- I am not a colonel, I'm a captain.

378
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,385
- Sorry, I forgot.

379
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,303
Which service?

380
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,304
- Don't ask me that!

381
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,515
I refuse to answer on the
grounds of the (mumbling).

382
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,439

383
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,941
(air blowing)

384
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,153
Into the red.

385
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,410
- Son, this is not the way.

386
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,203
If you need--

387
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,954
- Listen, forget the sermon, sambo,

388
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,039
just give us your wallet.

389
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,873
- Police officer!

390
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:02,707
Drop it!

391
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,461

Get out of the way!

(Captain Invincible burps)

403
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,617
- A car flew through the air, did it?

404
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,161
- Appeared to fly through
the air, sergeant.

405
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:43,581

406

416

- [Mr. Kirby] These orders are crazy.

425
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,564
We're putting the fate of the free world

426
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,317
in the hands of washed-up
drunk and a green rookie.

427
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,735
- You got it wrong, Mr. Kirby.

428
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,112
The green rookie is for
the time being at least

a proud possessor of the

430
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,076
And she deserves it. After
all, she found your man.

431
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,370
- In the case of American
personnel, dammit,

432
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,123
the head of the FBI at least

433
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:07,999
should be marching in there

434
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,709
to give the son of a bitch his orders.

435
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,295
- After all he's been through,
no one should give him orders.

436
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,255
No one can give him orders,

437
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,424
but a friend can ask for his help.

438
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,259
- That's you, right?

439
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,136
You're his friend.

440
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,763

00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,902
- I told you welfare
broads a hundred times,

444
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,820
I don't need any saving.

445
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,030
- No, no, I'm a policewoman.

446
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,074
Remember from this morning?

447
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,617
- This morning was a long time ago.

448
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,910
What do you want?

449
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,412
- You, Captain Invincible, just you.

450
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:48,581
- You got the wrong party.

451
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,751
- Also known as The Caped
Contender, Legend in Leotards,

452
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,420
and, last but not least,
Man of Magnet.

453
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,172
- I don't what you're talking about.

454
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,298
- Oh, really? Is that a fact?

455
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,633
(needle thudding)

456
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,760
(electricity crackles)

457
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,137
- (sighs) Okay, what do you want?

458
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:03,972
- Well, it's like this.

459
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,765
The American government
needs you to come and help.

460
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,642
- Oh, let me tell you.

461
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,228
"The world is in great
danger, every moment counts.

462
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,188
Only you, Captain Invincible,
can prevent

463
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,482
this terrible catastrophe," right?

464
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,525
- Right, how did you know?

465
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,026
- Because that's what
they always used to say

466
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,486
to get the old horse out of the barn,

467
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,488
and it used to work but not anymore.

468
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,906
So you can tell whoever sent you here

469
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,867
that I gave up the hero
business a long time ago.

470
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,202
- Well, you saved my life this morning.

471
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,288
That looked pretty heroic to me.

472
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,455
- Everybody makes mistakes.

473
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,000
- [Patty] There are a lot
of people who need you now.

474
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,626
- What about 'em?

475
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,878
I didn't see anybody putting
themselves on the line

476
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,548

It's quite all right.

529

I guess I haven't got any right

530
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,361
to ask you for anything,
Captain Invincible.

531
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:51,282
But I will ask you to keep an old promise.

532
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:03,836
You remember?

533

- Yes, I do, sir.

00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:07,924
Yes, I do.

535
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,217
A very worthy ambition.

536
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,510

537

00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:13,888
- There's something else.

539
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:18,643
All those years ago when
you signed that portrait,

540
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:23,189
you touched me on the shoulder.

541
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,900
(flesh hissing)

542
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,278
And every since there's been a mark there.

543
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,574
Sometimes it, it smarts a little.

544
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,701
Here, see.

545
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:37,578
Let me show it to you,

546
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,250
just so you know I'm, I'm
not kidding, all right?

547
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,294
Now wait until I'll get these buttons.

548
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,712
There.

549
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,339
And maybe you could give me a hand

550
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,342
to get that hook off the back, right?

551
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,973
That's it.

552
00:25:56,973 --> 00:26:00,268
- Oh, the mystic mark.

553
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,102
- Yeah.

554
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,020
- The sacred bond that
can never be broken.

555
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,609
- We need you badly, Captain Invincible.

556
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,114
We need you now real badly.

557
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,915
(Captain Invincible sighs)

558
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,128
(triumphant music)

559
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,509
- Ah, stop!

560
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,095
I gotta get down!

561
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,472
(chain clanging)

562
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,807
Give me the bag!

563
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,063
(Captain Invincible retching)

564
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:51,360
(Captain Invincible retching)

565
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,862
- Are you all right?

566
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,657
- I'm dying and you're shopping.

567
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,082
(Captain Invincible coughs)

568
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,334
- Don't you recognize it?

569
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,462
Have you any idea what a dry cleaner

570
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,130
charges for years of storage?

571
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,633
- Wonder if it still fits.

572
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,761
What's that?
- Yours.

573
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,805
I spent the morning at some
of your favorite pawn shops.

574
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,351
- My old wrist radio.

575
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,437
Good old American engineering.

576
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,356
You can't beat the double vacuum tube.

577
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,108
(gentle music)

578
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,026
Look there.

579
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,406
(radio chattering)

580
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,324
(gentle music)

581
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,950
Uh, she's not on.

582
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,951
- Sure it does.

583
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,411
I bought you some new batteries.

584
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,829
- [Captain Invincible]
Uh, you don't understand.

585
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,997
She's not on.

586
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,959
- [Patty] What does this unlock?

587
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,630
- Too many memories.

588
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,506
(key thudding)

589
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,132
(whistle blowing)

590
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,176
- Okay, let's try it without the harness.

591
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,137
- All right, and I gotta have a couple-

592
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,098
- Captain, it's only a
few feet off the ground.

593
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,057
- Okay, all right, okay.

594
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:11,899
Give me the Dramamine.

595
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,568
(whistle blows)

596
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,745
What do I say?

597
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:26,789
- "Magnet on."

598
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,666
"Magnet on!"

599
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,126
- Twice, I say it twice?

600
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:33,671
- Uh, excuse me, sir,
that's not right.

601
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,339
He's says, uh, "magnet on"
when he wants

602
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,299
to use his magnetic ability.

603
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,926
To fly he says, "Begin program."

604
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,219
- As I understand that--

605
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,053
- No, he doesn't.

606
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,972
He says, "Begin program," when he wants

607
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,182
to use his amazing computer brain.

608
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,435
- Right, we've got it straight at last.

609
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,269
"Magnet on."

610
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,145
Are you listening, Captain?

611
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,104
- Yeah.

612
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:50,938
- Good.

613
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,149
"Magnet on" is for the magnetic ability.

614
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,235
"Begin program" is for...

615
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,195
- The, the, the amazing computer brain.

616
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,947
- Right, you've got it.

617
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:01,365
And to fly you yell out...?

618
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:03,951
"Into the blue!"

619
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:04,785
- Blue, blue.

620
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,370
"Into the blue," stupid!

621
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,621
- Good.

622
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,706
Let's give it a go.

623
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,040
- Okay.

624
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,958
Here we go.

625
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,420
Into the blue!

626
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:18,883
(Captain Invincible grunts)

627
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,968
- This is not gonna work.

628
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,764
- Up!

629
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,935
(Captain Invincible grunts)

630
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,607
(Captain Invincible grunting)

631
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,068
(Captain Invincible grunting)

632
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,987
Into the blue!

633
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,781
(computer humming)
(computer beeping)

634
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:43,949
(metal clanging)
(button pops)

635
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,660
(metal clanging)

636
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,621
(metal thuds)
(metal clanging)

637
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,873
(metal thudding)

638
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:55,878
(metal rustling)
(metal clanging)

639
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,588
(metal scraping)

640
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:58,714
(metal whooshes)
(metal rustling)

641
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,841
(metal squeaking)

642
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,552
(metal clanging)

643
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,013
(metal clangs)

644
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,015
(metal squeaking)

645
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,016
(metal clangs)

646
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,226
- Mayday.

647
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,685
Mayday!

648
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,562
(plastic thuds)

649
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,396
- Tupper.

650
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,277
I think we oughta just call it a day.

651
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:25,866
(horn blowing)
(birds chirping)

652
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,785
- Number 19 calling Number One.

653
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:29,912
19 calling Number One.

654
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,413
(static hissing)

655
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,332
- [Mr. Midnight] Number One standing by.

656
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,376
- [19] 19 calling Number One.

657
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:39,755
- I repeat, Number 19,
Number One standing by.

658
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,966
Having you anything new to report?

659
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:43,926
- Uh, yes, there have
been unusual supplies

660
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,928
delivered to the opera house this morning.

661
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,639
- What do you mean unusual supplies?

662
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,099
- A truck load of gym equipment,

663
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,434
portable sauna, two wrestling mats,

664
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,727
and a case of Dramamine.

665
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,521
Since then every top cop in Sydney,

666
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,981
both commonwealth and local,

667
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,149
and U.S. military men have been in there.

668
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,235
And that lady cop I was telling you about?

669
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,319
She's with that slob

670
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,488
that's been getting all the VIP treatment.

671
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:05,364
- Would you be good enough

672
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,158
to elaborate on the slob, Number 19?

673
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,577
- [19] He looks familiar.

674
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,329
He's probably one of those
old has-been prize fighters.

675
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,749
- And old fighter.

676
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,254
(ominous music)

677
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,088
I wonder.

678
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,802
- So I'm supposed to
call you a police person

679
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,012
instead of a policewoman?

680
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:28,888
- Yeah, that's right, it's neutral.

681
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:29,972
- You mean neutered.

682
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,225
Then the word becomes horsepersonship?

683
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,184
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

684
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,853
- That sort of joke's
pretty tired these days.

685
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:36,687
- Yeah?

686
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:38,856
- I hope you're feeling hungry

687
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,900
because I'm paying for dinner.

688
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,235
- Okay, how about steak at Jack Dempsey's?

689
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,069
- Where?

690
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,906
- Or Lindy's or...

691
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,115
Listen, this is a stupid question

692
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:48,949
but where the hell are we?

693
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,326
Uh, uh, is this Wall Street?

694
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,619
Where is this?

695
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,829
- [Patty] Sydney.

696
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:54,955
Sydney, Australia.

697
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,586
- Australia?

698
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,046
That's where I've been all these years?

699
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,965
No wonder the rats look so
big, they were kangaroos.

700
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,426
Ah.

701
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:11,221
- Keep track of them, Number 19,

702
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:14,183
and alert all operatives in the area.

703
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,312
All good things must come to an end.

704
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,065
Tea time for Jeremy.

705
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:28,822
(teeth crunching)
(door clicks)

706
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,745
- Oh, what a great place.

707
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,289
Makes me feel right at home.

708
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,417
Where'd you get all this stuff?

709
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,835
- [Patty] Oh, you know,
flea markets,

710
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:44,046
garage sales, junk shops.

711
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,965
- (chuckles) No wonder I feel at home.

712
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,676
- [Patty] How do you want your steak?

713
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,427
- Uh, rare.

714
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,345
- What do you want with it?

715
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,429
Bean curd, sprouts?

716
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,556
- [Captain Invincible] What's that?

717
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,766
- It's too difficult to explain.

718
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,809
How about french fries?

719
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,643
- Perfect.

720
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,108
What is this?

721
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,693
Is this some kind of phonograph?

722
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:07,361
- [Patty] Stereo.

723
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,195

She's not on.

728
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,084
- What?

729
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:22,918
- Never mind.

730
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,387
- Place is all yours.

731
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,638
Almost all yours.

732
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,472
- I was just looking.

733
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,557
Just looking.

Listen, I've got to apologize
for acting so feisty.

765
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,848
I just haven't felt this good in years.

766
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:43,976
I feel alive and alert and vital and--

767
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:46,395
- Sober.
- Sober, that's the word.

768
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,606
To the good guys, wherever they may be.

769
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:50,816
- [Patty] The good guys.

770
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,200
- You paid $1.49 for seltzer?

771
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,618
- (laughs) That's not seltzer.

772
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:02,536
- It isn't?

773
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:06,456
Boy, they saw you coming. (laughing)

774
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,919

I'm sorry, that's, that's
my magnetic ability.

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,680
It's, it's out of whack.

781

- Think nothing of it, it's
just my entire kitchen.

782
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,685
How did you get like this?

783
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,020
- Drinking.

784
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,272
- No, no, before you
were Captain Invincible.

785
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,692
- Oh.
(whimsical music)

786
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,568
Long story.

(laser crackling)

796
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,859
- [Mr. Surling] How do you feel?

797
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,404
- Out of this world.

798
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,577

(babies crying)

801
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:37,256
- Ah, Mr. Surling,
congratulations, it's a boy.

802
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,509
A big boy.

803
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,887
Come on, come in. (chuckles)

804
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:44,680
Come on.

805
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,563
- Where's the baby, Doc?

806
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,606
- [Baby] Into the blue.

807
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,444
(suspenseful music)

808
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,828
- And the less said
about the end the better.

809
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,081
- So you stumble a little.
That's allowed.

810
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,583
- Well, I was kind of pushed.

811
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,591
- What's wrong?

812
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,303
- Oh, I, I just don't know if
I can trust myself anymore.

813
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,554
It's been so long.

814
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,557
Well, you saw what
happened this afternoon.

815
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,894
- You'll learn to control
your powers again.

816
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,146
It's like riding a bike, comes back.

817
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,315
- I never had to ride a bike.

818
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:37,149

(electricity hissing)

821
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,531
- You're ready to throw
in the towel, aren't you?

822
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,742
- [Captain Invincible]
I haven't got a towel.

823
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,826
- [Patty] Well, you can't give up.

824
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,036
- [Captain Invincible] Why?

825
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,078
- [Patty] For the one person who never

826
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,039
got a fair deal from Captain Invincible.

827
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:53,248
- Who?
- You.

828
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:02,090
To begin with, he's going to
use his amazing computer brain

829
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,761
to find our missing suspects,
since all others have failed.

830
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,636
Are you ready, Captain?

831
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:07,596

832
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:08,430
Thank you very much.

833
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,015
Do you have all the materials
that we've talked about?

834
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,351
- Right here, Captain.
- Very good.

Their operators are standing by

843

with lists of recently released felons.

844
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,539
Are you ready, Captain?

Ah, the glasses.

848
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,346
Where are the goddamn glasses?

849
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,098
- [Patty] Right here.

850
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:56,853

a central part of which
is clustered with theaters

879
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:12,304
which have made the streets

when its central location

884
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,065
drove a fashionable

should discover in the public felicity

00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,959
(suspenseful music)
(papers rustling)

905
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:28,964
(door clicks)
(bell ringing)

906
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:35,303
(bell ringing)
(door bangs)

907
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:46,356
- That guy.

908
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,190
That outfit.

909
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:49,192
It can't be.

910
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,819
- But it is.

911
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,864
After all these years,
it is.

912
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,702
I knew that Captain Invincible

913
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:02,080
was beaten, broken, a drunken clown,

914
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,958
and content with the pleasure
that that knowledge gave me

915
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:07,377
I foolishly stayed my hand.

916
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,462
- All I know is that they're
getting too close for comfort.

917
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,338
- Calm yourself.

918
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:14,092
The only thing that they're
getting close to is the grave.

919
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,761
(ominous music)

920
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,232
(snake hisses)
(teeth crunching)

921
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,735
(vacuum whirring)

922
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:34,738
(suspenseful music)

923
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,330
(plastic clanging)

924
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,341
(plastic thudding)

925
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,551
(Patty groans)

926
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:57,969
- What the heck?

927
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:58,970
(hoses honking)

928
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,138
We're locked in, Patty!

929
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,349
Go see if there's a backdoor!

930
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:03,767
- [Patty] Oh, Captain!

931
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:04,934
- What?
- Cap!

932
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,769
(Patty yells)

933
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,103
- I'll try the window.

934
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,230
(Patty yells)

935
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,106
(suspenseful music)

936
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:10,940
(electricity popping)

937
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,858
(Patty groaning)

938
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,568
(electricity pops)
(Captain Invincible groaning)

939
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,905
(Patty grunting)

940
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:17,781
(Patty yells)

941
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:18,615
Hang on!

942
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:21,660
(electricity pops)

943
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,539
(Patty groaning)

944
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,627
(Captain Invincible grunting)

945
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:32,504
(Captain Invincible grunts)

946
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:35,840
(Patty grunts)

947
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,841
Hang on!

948
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,343
(hoses hissing)

949
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,886
(Patty yells)

950
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,473
(Captain Invincible yells)

951
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,851
(gun bangs)
(vacuum whirring)

952
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:47,686
- [Patty] Hey!

953
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:48,520
- Ah.

954
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,399
This really sucks.

955
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,233
Patty.

956
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:55,110
(gun bags)

957
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,862
(plastic thudding)

958
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:59,739
- I can't breathe!

959
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,616
- I know, they're sucking
up all the air in here.

960
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,493
- Well, use your magnetic power.

961
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:04,869
- I can't, I don't know if I can use that

962
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,955
any better than my amazing computer brain.

963
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:09,249
- If you don't hurry up
we won't have any choice.

964
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:11,084
- Yeah, all right.

965
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:11,918
Magnet on!

966
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:14,295
(dramatic music)

967
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,463
Magnet on.

968
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,174
(electricity pops)

969
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,008
- Don't fly.

970
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,969
Use your magnetic power.

971
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:24,806
(body thudding)

972
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,057
Come down.

973
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:27,642
- Shit, shit, shit!

974
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,061
- Come down.

975
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,479
- Please.

976
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:32,313
(electricity humming)

977
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,857
- What are you doing?

978
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:35,191
- The electrical system.

979
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,235
I'm reversing the polarity
so that the vacuums

980
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,028
blow the air back out of the room.

981
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,032
That's a fine thing to do now.

982
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,952
(air hissing)

983
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,036
Patty!

984
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,621
(air hissing)

985
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:49,456
(button pops)

986
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:50,582
Patty!

987
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:51,958
(air hissing)

988
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:52,959
(button pops)

989
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,335
(Captain Invincible grunts)

990
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,545
(electricity popping)

991
00:45:55,545 --> 00:45:57,297
(woman screaming)

992
00:45:57,297 --> 00:46:00,300
(explosion booming)

993
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,220
Whoo-hoo, ah!

994
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,930
(triumphant music)

995
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,308
(vacuum cranking)

996
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:11,895
(Captain Invincible yells)

997
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,689
(Captain Invincible grunts)

998
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,523
(vacuums cranking)
(suspenseful music)

999
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,026
(air hissing)

1000
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,582
(air hissing)

1001
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:38,505
(Patty screaming)

1002
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,844
(air pops)
(Captain Invincible grunts)

1003
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,263
No wonder nature abhors a vacuum.

1004
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:51,142
I'll say one thing for
you, Patty, you got moxie.

1005
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,018
- [Patty] What's moxie?

1006
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,186
- Never mind.

1007
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,813
Come on.
- Where to?

1008
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,481
- Headquarters.
- What for?

1009
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,399
- To find the traitor.

1010
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:00,902
(door clicks)
(air blowing)

1011
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,488
(bell ringing)

1012
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,202
(upbeat music)
(group chattering)

1013
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,455
- [Tony] 35 years I've been in New York.

1014
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,874
35 years but enough's enough.

1015
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,087
- [Wife] Tony, relax.

1016
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,797
Your ulcer.

1017
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:21,631
- Relax?

1018
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,717
How can I relax?

1019
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,387
- All our residents
have the same complaint:

1020
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:31,224
the city, she's turning into a nightmare.

1021
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,519
But here at Sicily Acres-- look,

1022
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,396
she's heaven on a stick.

1023
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:39,357
- It's beautiful, but
the price is got to be-

1024
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,651
- Uh, don't worry about the price.

1025
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,738
For you, for you, we are paesanos,

1026
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,198
I will take of you.

1027
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,660
(hand thuds)
(ominous music)

1028
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,246
(gun humming)

1029
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,915
(laser humming)

1030
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:03,256
Now, why don't you take
another look at our homes.

1031
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:06,009
- I got to live here.

1032
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,053
- A down payment, (speaks in
foreign language) no problem.

1033
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:12,557
You are going to live here.

1034
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,643
- We are going to live here.

1035
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:19,105
(upbeat drum music)
(group chanting)

1036
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,443
- And we're going to go
home and pack.

1037
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,154
- Reports from the housing developments

1038
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,488
are excellent, chief.

1039
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:30,283
All the sales figures have
topped our expectations.

1040
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,745
Everything's going great!
Except for...

1041
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,371
- Except for Captain Invincible.

1042
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,040
Exactly.

1043
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:42,128
I must say that his survival
was rather surprising.

1044
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:43,963
Seems that his abilities have returned

1045
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,465
rather sooner than I expected.

1046
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:49,469
However, I can assure you
that he will not escape

1047
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:51,512
the new trap that I have laid for him.

1048
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:56,017
I shall destroy Captain Invincible
for the second time.

1049
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:57,685
(group laughing)

1050
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,979
- I don't understand
why you're so certain.

1051
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:01,981
Oh, my God.

1052
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,861
- This is madness.

1053
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:07,695
Madness!

1054
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,160
We were meant to walk into this, Patty,

1055
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,870
which can only mean one thing:

1056
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,664
there's a traitor in your department.

1057
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,250
What is it?

1058
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,753
- Jane Fonda reading "Walden Pond."

1059
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,837
- God almighty.

1060
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,798
- They didn't stand a chance.

1061
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:27,632
And how could this of happened?

1062
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,466
Where are the security guards?

1063
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,300
How come?

1064
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,844
- [Dispatcher] Federal authorities
have cordoned off areas.

1065
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:32,887
Wanted for questioning.

1066
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,682
Repeat, be on the lookout
for Captain Invincible

1067
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:38,893
and female companion
wanted for questioning.

1068
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,603
Wanted for questioning.
- We've been set up, Patty.

1069
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,771
We've been framed!

1070
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,148
- Captain, I don't know how
to explain all this yet,

1071
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,735
but I think you're
being a little paranoid.

1072
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:50,113
- Paranoid, eh?

1073
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,447
- Hold it right there.

1074
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,865
- Come on, Patty!

1075
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,827
(wall thudding)

1076
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,036
(guns firing)

1077
00:49:57,036 --> 00:50:00,331
(laughs) Faster than a
speeding jet!

1078
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,291
They've found no way to stop him yet!

1079
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:04,669
- [Patty] There's only one thing, Captain.

1080
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:05,503
- What?

1081
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,755
- We're going straight into the water.

1082
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,549
- Into the blue!

1083
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,884
Into the blue, for Christ's sake!

1084
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,721
- May I make a suggestion?

1085
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:18,933
- Number One.
Uh, calling Number One.

1086
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,145
- I trust for your sake that
you have a favorable report.

1087
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,146
- It's fantastic.

1088
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:24,939
Because of the hypno-ray

1089
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:29,944
the occupancy rate of
Sicily Heights is 98%.

1090
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,696
- Most impressive.

1091
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,619
(Mr. Midnight laughing)

1092
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:39,787
- Thanks to the hypno-ray

1093
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:44,792
we have achieved a 99%
occupancy rate in Polish Palms.

1094
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,795
- Excellent! (laughs)

1095
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,047
(fingers snap)

1096
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,590
- Thanks to the hypno-ray

1097
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:55,595
we have achieved 100%
occupancy rate in Afro Acres.

1098
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,263
- Excellent.

1099
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:01,225
(Mr. Midnight chuckles)

1100
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,060
- Do you know what you've done?

1101
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,935
Have you any idea?

1102
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,271
You've thrown my whole career
out the window along with me.

1103
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,273
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

1104
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:08,983
They would have believed my story.

1105
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,818
I'm not a washed-up drunk
who pleaded the fifth

1106
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,321
in front of a-- I'm sorry,
I didn't mean that.

1107
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:18,117
(sighs) It's just that my
career was just beginning.

1108
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,702
Had a policewoman of the month badge

1109
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,162
and three special commendations

1110
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,872
in the commissioner's own handwriting.

1111
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,916
- Well, I'm sure you deserved
the commendations, kid,

1112
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,125
but I don't know if
you would have deserved

1113
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,585
the ventilation hose you would have had

1114
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:28,503
all throughout your body

1115
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:29,754
if I didn't drag you out of there.

1116
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,255
- How can you be so sure?

1117
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,924
- Because I know who's behind this now.

1118
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:33,633
- Who?

1119
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:35,009
- Mr. Midnight.

1120
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,595
He's the only one who's smart
enough to have engineered...

1121
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,101
(whistle blowing)

1122
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,730
He's the only person who could
have engineered this thing.

1123
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,108
Stolen the hypno-ray, getting
the whole world against me,

1124
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,234
it all makes sense now.

1125
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,070
- Mr. Midnight.
- Yeah.

1126
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:54,904
My arch-enemy.

1127
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,698

1221
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:35,453

1222
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:38,706

1223
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:41,750

choiced by yourself, sir.

1224
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,127
- What?

1225
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:44,587
- We don't like Invincible.

1226
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:45,838
He's a juice head.

1227
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,339
A complete burnout.

1228
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:54,388
- Gentlemen, I have absolute
faith in Captain Invincible.

1229
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:59,226
Your criticisms are
premature and unwarranted.

1230
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,978
That is all.

1231
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,856
- Close down the sample
home by noon tomorrow

1232
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:06,317
and have all the other
villages do the same.

1233
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:09,945
You will then converge at
the underground yacht basin

1234
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,906
and await the signal.

1235
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,742
Open wider, you silly boy.

1236
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:16,952
There.

1237
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,830
- The statue is 302 feet tall

1238
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:22,082
and a gift from the people of France.

1239
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,751
On its base are the famous words

1240
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:26,879
by the American Jewish poet Emma Lazarus.

1241
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,590
"Give me your tired, your poor,

1242
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,967
your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free."

1243
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,552
- Can we go up in the head?

1244
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,929
- Uh, no.

1245
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:36,764
You see, that observation platform

1246
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:39,350
was closed over 30 years
ago by the government.

1247
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,853
Now we're coming up to
Ellis Island soon where...

1248
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:48,150
(playful ominous music)

1249
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,402
- I can't wait much longer, Mr. President.

1250
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,489
- There is danger ahead.

1251
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,658
- What?
- We cannot escape danger

1252
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,410
or the fear of it

1253
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:02,456
by crawling into bed and pulling
the covers over our heads.

1254
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,543
- I won't let you down, Mr. President.

1255
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,795
I can't wait any longer, Mr. President.

1256
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:08,879
- Wake up, Vince.

1257
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,259
- Uh.

1258
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,179
Sorry about the mess, Patty.

1259
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:20,266
Truman used to send a girl in on Tuesdays,

1260
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,851
but you know how things are.

1261
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,144
- It's not that bad.

1262
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,776
- Sorry, did you say something?

1263
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:31,694
- No.

1264
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,364
- Okay.

1265
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,783
(hands clap)

1266
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,538
(computer beeping)

1267
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,998
- What are you doing?

1268
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,374
- I'm gonna find Midnight.

1269
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,335
Got a battery of long
range sensing devices

1270
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,504
hooked up to terminals
all over the country.

1271
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,089
Ike gave them to me.

1272
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,592
And when I plug myself in,
I can literally feel

1273
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:57,845
what's going on from the
mountains to the prairies.

1274
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,768
(button clicks)

1275
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:09,648
No, she's still not on.

1276
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,403
- The American Eagle Network.

1277
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:15,821
Captain, I hate to tell you this

1278
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,364
but that's not around anymore.

1279
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,699
- Don't say it, Patty.

1280
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:20,451
I don't want you to bury
any more dreams of mine

1281
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,036
so just don't say it!

1282
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:23,287
- I'm sorry, but I have to tell you

1283
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:25,247
the truth about things that have changed.

1284
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,499
- Things haven't changed,
Patty, people have changed.

1285
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,543
People and the whole damn country.

1286
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,628
It's lost something.

1287
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:31,629
It's lost something vital,

1288
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:35,591
like, like, like, like
honesty and pride, integrity,

1289
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,593
and a sense of the future.

1290
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:39,053
I tell you, when that happens
to a country,

1291
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,721
country goes right into the gutter.

1292
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,306
- [Patty] Well, you came back from there.

1293
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,265
Well, you did.

1294
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,518
- I'll tell you when this thing is over

1295
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,729
I'm gonna sit in that chair
and just wait.

1296
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:49,563
- Wait for what?

1297
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,273
That radio to start working again?

1298
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,191
- Why not?

1299
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,278
See that?

1300
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,863
That's Albert Einstein.

1301
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,074
He was a close personal
friend of mine, Patty.

1302
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,659
And he said to me once, he said.

1303
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:07,873
(Captain Invincible speaking
in foreign language)

1304
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,879
Which means that the universe, Patty,

1305
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:17,383
and time it, it goes on, goes on forever

1306
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:18,967
all the way through to eternity,

1307
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:22,221
and, and folds in on
itself in a kind of vortex,

1308
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,847
and then comes all the way back.

1309
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,266
Well, fine, I'm just
gonna sit here and wait.

1310
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:34,441
Just gonna sit up here in Ms. Liberty

1311
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,986
and wait for 1950 to come around again.

1312
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:41,448
And with it Jack Dempsey,
the Polo Grounds,

1313
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:44,576
the NBC Blue Network,
Harry God Bless Him Truman,

1314
01:01:44,576 --> 01:01:45,869
and maybe when hell freezes over

1315
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,080
some good old fashioned
pride in this country.

1316
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:51,542
Okay, state of the union check.

1317
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:54,294
I'm gonna start west and work my way east.

1318
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:57,131
(machine humming)

1319
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,926
(computer beeping)

1320
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,389
(electricity crackling)

1321
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:08,559
(electricity popping)

1322
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,898
(machine whirring)

1323
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,316
(metal creaks)

1324
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,151
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1325
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:18,736
- Did you find out where Midnight is?

1326
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:19,570
- I think so.

1327
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,082
(phone chiming)

1328
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:35,669
- Janice, I said no calls.

1329
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:37,796
Who?

1330
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:42,634
Well, my God, yes.

1331
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,094
Why didn't you tell me?

1332
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,221
Put him on.

1333
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,598
- Good morning, sir.

1334
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:50,184
- Oh, Captain Invincible.

1335
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,979
Well, it's great to hear your voice.

1336
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,189
- Thank you very much.

1337
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,399
Sir, I have information
about the hypno-ray.

1338
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,400
- You do?

1339
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,234
- Midnight's got it,

1340
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,527
and I think I know where to find him.

1341
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,904
- You do?

1342
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:02,738
- Yeah.

1343
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,616
- Captain, now you're sure
about this Mr. Midnight?

1344
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,075
- Mr. Midnight, yes.

1345
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:10,162
Right.

1346
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,080
Good.

1347
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:15,000
Terrific.

1348
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,127
Thank you, sir.

1349
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,880
(phone thuds)

1350
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,298
He doesn't believe me.

1351
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,801
I'm gonna get sold down the
river just like last time.

1352
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:25,719
- He can't, he's your friend.

1353
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:26,929
- Maybe and maybe not.

1354
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:30,557
- I'm going to give him 24 hours.

1355
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,893
- Come on, Patty, we've got work to do.

1356
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,689
- A veritable feast of Thanksgiving

1357
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:42,069
on this the eve of a glorious new order.

1358
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,154
When the pure genetic Americans discover

1359
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,824
what I have done to clean
up that rotting cesspool

1360
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,367
that they call New York,

1361
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,410
their gratitude to me will be boundless.

1362
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,245
They will carry me

1363
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:53,372
into the White House upon their shoulders.

1364
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:57,251
And our plan will spread
throughout the entire land.

1365
01:03:57,376 --> 01:04:02,381
Gentlemen, I give you a
toast to Operation Ivory.

1366
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:12,349
In 24 hours, New York will be 100% pure.

1367
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:21,859
Alas, poor Schultz.

1368
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:23,235
I knew him well, Julius.

1369
01:04:26,822 --> 01:04:29,157
(traffic humming)

1370
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:34,162
(horn honking)
(group chattering)

1371
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,423
- Recognize that sign?

1372
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:50,888
They had one exactly like it
outside the vacuum repair shop.

1373
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:52,973
- Coincidence?

1374
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,059
- Where Midnight is concerned,
there is no coincidence.

1375
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,480
(group chattering)

1376
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:03,942
(silverware clanging)

1377
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,904
Hello.

1378
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:09,531
(silverware clanging)

1379
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,366
(group chattering)

1380
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,119
- That's right, Mrs.
Newsbloom, Israeli Acres.

1381
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,496
But don't take my word for it,
check it out for yourself.

1382
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,665
But hurry, I hear they're almost all sold.

1383
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:19,541
- Yes, I will.

1384
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,543
Thank you, thank you.
- Mention my name!

1385
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,003
Can I help you?

1386
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,715
- Yeah, I'd like a pastrami
and a corned beef, please.

1387
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:27,966
- Right.
- Both on rye.

1388
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,511
And uh, oh, anything else, honey?

1389
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,181
- A pint of Cole slaw and
a half a pound of Nova.

1390
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:39,227
- And some matjes herring,
and a little halva,

1391
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:42,147
and some information about Mr. Midnight.

1392
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,440
- Mister who?

1393
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,192
- You heard me.
- Captain.

1394
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,527
- Listen to me, buddy, I've
been in this shop 20 years,

1395
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,571
I ain't never heard of Mr. Midnight,

1396
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,949
or, or moonlight, or whatever.

1397
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,033
- Yes?

1398
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,036
Then why are you putting
mayonnaise on a corned beef sandwich?

1399
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,539
- Be with you in a minute.

1400
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,249
- Duck!

1401
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,376
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

1402
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:05,212
(group screaming)

1403
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:12,678
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

1404
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,308
You don't know Midnight, eh?

1405
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:24,982
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

1406
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,442
(gun firing)

1407
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:34,157
(gun firing)

1408
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,409
There's no need for the gun, Patty,

1409
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:36,493
my powers are coming back.

1410
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,286
I can feel 'em surging through my body.

1411
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:41,456
I'll repel their bullets
with my magnetic ability.

1412
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:42,666
Magnet on!

1413
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,750
(magnet humming)

1414
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,085
(knives clanging)

1415
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:45,919
(knives whooshing)
(knives thudding)

1416
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,588
Repel, attract, I'll get
it right in a minute.

1417
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:49,631
(gun firing)

1418
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,551
(glass shattering)

1419
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:54,761
Magnet on!

1420
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,972
(explosion booming)

1421
01:06:56,972 --> 01:06:59,099
(machine whirring)
(blade boinging)

1422
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:04,104
(gun firing)
(deli owner laughing)

1423
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:11,278
(glass shattering)
(liquid splattering)

1424
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,239
(suspenseful music)

1425
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,033
(Captain Invincible grunts)
(triumphant music)

1426
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:16,867
(pie whooshing)

1427
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:17,701
(pie thudding)

1428
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:18,785
(Captain Invincible grunts)
(pie thudding)

1429
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,829
(food splattering)

1430
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:23,665

1446
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:10,170
- Oh, good God, this one's
been sliced to death.

1447
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,130
- Not a very pleasant way to go, Patty.

1448
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,176
- He's not old.

1449
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,010
- Huh.

1450
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,890
And he's not Jewish either.

Attention.

1471
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:30,083
Captain Invincible will be
within our grasp at any moment.

1472
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,502
I want him totally destroyed.

1473

- Your cockamamie story
checks out, Patracia.

1477
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,477
But we can't get that shaft open.

1478
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:50,729
If it is a shaft.

1479
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,314
- Uh, you gotta do something.

1480
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:57,319
- Well, we're only human,
unlike your friend. (laughs)

1481
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:00,739
Come on, you've got an
appointment at headquarters.

1482
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,490
- I thought I was cleared.

1483

1484
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,577
But if you wanna keep your badge,

1485
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:08,288
you better file a report
that keeps my department

1486
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,332
out of this entire fiasco.

1487
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:12,167
- And what about Captain Invincible?

1488
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,293

1490

(Gustav speaking in foreign language)

1513
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,035
- Ah, just, just a moment, Gustav, please.

1514
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,161
Now, would you mind repeating that

1515
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,746
but a little more slowly.

1516
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:15,957
(Gustav speaking in foreign language)

1517
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:20,920
I see, so our gallant captain
has finally arrived. And then?

1518
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,591
(Gustav speaking in foreign language)

1519
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,801
Into the deli, down the chute,

1520
01:12:26,801 --> 01:12:28,595
and into the garbage.
Very appropriate.

1521
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:29,346
Go on.

1522
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:33,892
(Gustav speaking in foreign language)

1523
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,690
Unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected.

1524
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:41,608
Thank you, Gustav.

1525
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:42,442
You may go.

1526
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:45,820
Oh, of course.

1527
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:51,326

- You didn't think I'd make, did you?

1532
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,176
- Frankly, I didn't
think that you'd make it

1533
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:10,095
into this century, my dear fellow.

1534
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,473
You're a walking anachronism, Captain.

1535
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:17,060
A paltry, puffed-up notion
of a day long passed.

1536
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,898
An entity whose tickets to
oblivion is about to be punched.

1537

(pit thudding)

1548
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:16,536
- Well, that was really the pits.

1549
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:18,538
- Congratulations, Captain.

1550
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,082
It seems that some of your old skills

1551
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:22,584
have not entirely deserted you.

1552
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,461
- I don't need any compliments
from you, Midnight.

1553
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,588
I want the hypno-ray and I want it now.

1554
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:29,132
- Same old dreary demands.

1555
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,177
Self-righteous, messianic, moralistic,

1556
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:34,429
and increasingly tedious.

1557
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:37,390
- Fine talk from a sociopath
paranoid schizophrenic

1558
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:38,933
with delusions of grandeur.

1559
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:40,059
- Thank you.

1560
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,561
- You'll never change.

1561
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,813
- And you will never win.

1562
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:49,486

1563

Now let's see, during our long association

1564
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,662
you have, uh, changed brands
quite a few times haven't you?

1565
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:03,082
To begin with, it was retsina,
as I recall

1566
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,709
with just a little dash of hemlock.

1567
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,921
And then your long flirtation with cognac,

1568
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,882
during which you did
rather overdo with Napoleon.

1569
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:15,762
And most recently, a fine Kentucky bourbon.

plugging myself into them,

1624
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,465
I can literally feel what's
going on in this land of ours,

1625
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:42,301
from the mountains to the prairies.

1626

Here I am again.

01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:33,264
What's on the program now?

1655
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:34,765
A little water polo?

1656
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:37,602
- What's on is 30 years of
research and development

1657
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:40,021

1658
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:41,314
- [Computer] Hello, Captain.

1659
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:44,650
Pardon me for a moment, I have
some business to attend to.

1660
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:48,279
Attention, submarine fleet.

1661
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:50,948
Assume attack formation
and prepare to fire.

1662
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,743
Midnight One, your targets

1663
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,912
are Polish Palms and Israeli Acres.

1664
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:57,580
Midnight Two, you take out Sicily Heights

1665
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,248
and San Juan Sands.

1666
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:03,210
What you will shortly see
in that terrarium miniature,

1667
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:06,047
you will also shortly see in reality.

1668
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,508

attack, and have a nice day.

(group screaming)

1689
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,447
- I've sent back the repellent, repulsive,

1690
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:16,951
genetically inferior,
racially impure monstrosities,

1691

back to the very just fate

1692
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:22,123
that has awaited them all
since the very dawn of man!

1693
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:26,460
Congratulations, Midnight,
you really are a genius.

1698
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:36,303
You fumbled a big one
on the one yard line.

1699
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,307
Today New York, tomorrow the world!

1700
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:43,436

- Michael Lang with a special news break.

1720
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,136
Moments ago, sections

1721
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,597
of the New York State
coastline broke away.

1722
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:04,058
The ethnic populations trapped
on the floating sections

1723
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:05,518
were rescued by--
- Into the blue!

1724
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:08,312
Captain Invincible from a
submarine attack masterminded

1725
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,064
by arch criminal Mr. Midnight.

1726
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:11,690
Although this has not been confirmed.

1727
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:12,608
(air blowing)

1728
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,568
Invincible vanished decades ago,

1729
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:16,112
and his astonishing reappearance

1730
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,988
stunned millions of New Yorkers.

1731
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:21,158
Stayed tuned for further
developments, film at 11.

1732
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:23,327
- Patty, that was one terrific broadcast.

1733
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,161
- Nothing to it.

1734
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:25,704
Vince, all I had to do was
get on your wavelength.

1735
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:26,622
- Well, you're on it.

1736
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:29,166
- We knew you'd come through for us.

1737
01:25:30,084 --> 01:25:31,836
And don't be a stranger now.

1738
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:33,629
Let's have lunch together sometime.

1739
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:34,755
- Right, right, we'll keep in touch.

1740
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:35,589
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1741
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:38,717
(President chuckles)
(camera clicking)

1742
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:41,679

(group chattering)

1744

(group cheering)
(group clapping)

1745
01:25:52,982 --> 01:25:56,986
I'm not a public speaker,
or an expert, or anything,

1746
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:59,113
but there's something
that I'd like to say.

1747
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:02,867
We've been through a great deal together.

1748
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:08,539
Now it isn't all your
fault but some of it was.

1749
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:12,710
That's because a lot of us, including me,

1750
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,921
have been thinking we're
all alone in the world,

1751
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:20,050
alone or part of some
helpless little group.

1752
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:24,346
And that what's makes us
such easy marks for the bad guys.

1753
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:28,684
But together we're not
alone, we're not helpless.

1754
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:33,647
Together we're part of the
roughest, toughest, biggest,

1755
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:38,027
kindest, fairest, best damn
gang in the whole world.

1756
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,865
