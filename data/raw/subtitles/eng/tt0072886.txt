1
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:48,757
This is...

2
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,382
This is Doc's
Fortress of Solitude

3
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,801
in the arctic circle,

4
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,427
where he retreats every so often

5
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,846
from the grueling
pressure of routine

6
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:21,643
to concentrate and further
develop his wide knowledge.

7
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,145
To study astronomy...

8
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,981
The planets...

9
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:29,442
The stars...

10
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,487
The universe.

11
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,785
Or work to invent something

12
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,286
that one day

13
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,664
might be useful to mankind.

14
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,884
When Doc is in action,

15
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,595
his brain trust,
the fabulous five,

16
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,139
are never far behind.

17
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,182
One of these
intrepid men is Ham,

18
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,809
a legal genius,

19
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,770
graduate magna
cum laude of Harvard.

20
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,022
Not only justice for the rich,

21
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,691
but justice for the poor.

22
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,943
Another member
of the group is Monk,

23
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:13,778
the world's greatest chemist,

24
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:15,738
winner of the Blanding prize,

25
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,658
discoverer of the
fraxoning formula.

26
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:21,452
He named his pet Habeas Corpus.

27
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:27,542
The third member is Renny,

28
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,210
globe-hopping engineer--

29
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,506
builder of great bridges,
dams, and skyscrapers.

30
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:34,966
Next is Johnny,

31
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:37,510
erudite geologist
and archeologist.

32
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,804
Famed for deciphering
the hieroglyphics

33
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:41,389
of the teutonic stone,

34
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,224
as well as for his
monumental studies

35
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,728
of prehistoric man
in central Africa.

36
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,647
Completing the
quintet is Long Tom,

37
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,399
an electrical wizard.

38
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,986
Hi, Doc.

39
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,494
Something's wrong.

40
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,705
What is it?

41
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:11,765
But how did you know?

42
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,708
I sensed it.

43
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,916
I picked up your thought waves,

44
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,712
came as fast as I could.

45
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,257
Doc, it's in regard
to your father.

46
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:26,763
Last week he passed
away down in South America

47
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,475
in a little place
called Hidalgo.

48
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:34,979
Apparently, he contracted
some rare tropical disease.

49
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:39,275
We're sorry, Doc.

50
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:43,029
We all know how close
you and your father were.

51
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:07,595
This morning a large
Manila envelope arrived.

52
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:09,097
It was from your father.

53
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:10,723
As far as we could determine,

54
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,476
he mailed it on the
very day he died.

55
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:14,620
Where is it?

56
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:15,937
He wrote on the envelope

57
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,940
that its contents were
for your eyes alone,

58
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,109
so I locked it in your safe.

59
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:01,149
Shut up. You want
to get yourself killed?

60
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,901
750 grains.

61
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,987
577 caliber, nitro express.

62
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,363
An elephant rifle.

63
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,907
Right.

64
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,166
I don't see a thing.

65
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,877
An absolute absence
of ambulation.

66
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,665
Registering heat
from a gun barrel...

67
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:41,873
From the top of that building

68
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,292
right over there.

69
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,628
That's the old Eastman
Cranmoor building.

70
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,463
Renny, we'll take the whizzer.

71
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:48,649
Go get it warmed up.

72
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:49,673
Check.

73
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,799
Monk...

74
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,593
You and the rest take the Cord,

75
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,930
get over there as
fast as you can.

76
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,432
To the garage.

77
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,476
To the garage!

78
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,488
It's a good thing

79
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,699
Doc had those refractive
glass windows installed.

80
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,907
Saved his life.

81
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,243
Indubitably.

82
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,953
From the outside
everything appears to be

83
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,163
5 inches to the left
of where it actually is.

84
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,583
A most fragmistatic invention.

85
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,960
That tower, Renny.

86
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,546
Up there!

87
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,556
Watch what you're doing, stupid!

88
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,103
Watch out, Doc.

89
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,113
The back door, let's
try the back door.

90
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:15,713
Invidiously obstructed.

91
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,132
This one's locked, too.

92
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,676
Here, hold him for me.

93
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,136
How many times
do I have to tell you?

94
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,472
Get that revolting
beast away from me.

95
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,266
Look here, you 5th
Avenue fashion plate--

96
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,475
I'll take him.

97
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,894
OK.

98
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:33,105
Out of my way, shyster.

99
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,981
It doesn't work.
There's no juice!

100
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,484
The stairs, let's
take the stairs!

101
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,028
Hey, hey, wait a minute, fellas.

102
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:23,280
Hey, fellas, I can
fix this in a minute.

103
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,657
Hey, hey, fellas!

104
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,576
Hey, I got the elevator working.

105
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:09,784
Come on.

106
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:41,942
Aah!

107
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,209
Look!

108
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,020
One thing for sure--

109
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,521
he ain't no native New Yorker.

110
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,981
The word is isn't.

111
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,816
Isn't, ain't, what's
the difference?

112
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,985
Fingers look like they've
been dipped in blood.

113
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,905
Somebody help me turn him over.

114
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:39,458
Well, I'll be superamalgamated.

115
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,336
I thought I knew the markings
of every tribe on earth,

116
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,964
but I've never seen
anything like this before.

117
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,423
What do you make of it, Doc?

118
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,803
There's someone
in the penthouse.

119
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,513
Johnny, you stay with the body.

120
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,721
Come on.

121
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,062
Johnny, you going
to be all right?

122
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,522
Ah...

123
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,856
Go.

124
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,327
Do a Barney Oldfield, Long Tom.

125
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,271
Long Tom, get the lights.

126
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,066
Stand by, Monk.

127
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,279
We'll use the
extinguisher globes.

128
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,335
What is it, Doc?

129
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,111
We know that sound by now.

130
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,238
It means you figured
out something.

131
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:37,576
My father did not die
of a tropical disease.

132
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:39,994
He was murdered.

133
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,966
What happened to you?

134
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:55,302
I'm... quite copacetic.

135
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:56,511
Doc?

136
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,764
Holy cow, what happened here?

137
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,307
Oh, nothing.

138
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,768
Just some vipers snuck
in, blew up the safe,

139
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,144
and burnt the papers.

140
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,854
Yikes.

141
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,149
Thank you.

142
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:10,484
I...

143
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,279
I was examining the strange
markings on the dead man...

144
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:17,282
When a wall of
bricks fell on me.

145
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,826
At least, that's
what it felt like.

146
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:22,538
When I woke up...

147
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,832
The body was gone.

148
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,626
But I did find one thing.

149
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,467
Solid gold.

150
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,971
Think it has something to
do with your father's death?

151
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,640
I intend to find out.

152
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,980
I'm leaving for
Hidalgo in the morning.

153
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,869
If you're going, I'm going, too.

154
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,495
So am I. Me, too.

155
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,747
That's why we all
came in the first place--

156
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,416
in case you needed us.

157
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,750
I wish I could join you.

158
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,711
My company just
started a new turnpike.

159
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,504
I'm in the middle of a trial.

160
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,923
That's just what I expect from
you, you pompous peacock.

161
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:16,633
Now, hold on, Monk.

162
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,804
None of you are
obligated to go with me.

163
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,514
This is my problem.

164
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,017
But, Doc, remember
when we were all buddies

165
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,476
fighting in the trenches?

166
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:27,685
Remember what we agreed?

167
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,646
I, for one, recall it perfectly.

168
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,857
If we ever got out alive,

169
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:36,570
we'd help each other in
peace as we did in war.

170
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,867
Look, I appreciate your
support, believe me,

171
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,494
but now each of
you has a career.

172
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,706
You've all risen to World-Wide
eminence in your chosen fields.

173
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,541
I can't expect you to put aside

174
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,126
what you worked so
hard for all these years.

175
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,878
That's precisely the point.

176
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,339
Here's an
indefectable opportunity

177
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,799
to use our skills for
something more important

178
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,052
than just our own selfish gain.

179
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,679
Yeah. Count us in.

180
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,766
Thank you, Monk.

181
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,309
Well...

182
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,229
I'll see you in the
morning, chief.

183
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,563
All right, Johnny.

184
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,692
Oh, Johnny...

185
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:16,901
You sure you're all right?

186
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,821
Oh... supercradofolous...

187
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,492
Except for this goose egg
on the top of my noggin.

188
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,287
I'll bring Johnny with me.

189
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,496
OK, Long Tom.

190
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,831
Right.

191
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,793
I wish I could go with you, Doc.

192
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:33,978
Good luck.

193
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,002
Thank you.

194
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:37,506
Yes. Good luck to you all.

195
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,968
Anyway, you won't need a
lawyer down there, will you?

196
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,428
No, I wouldn't think so, Ham.

197
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,974
Uh, we'll, uh...

198
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,684
We'll look after the store.

199
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,936
Thanks.

200
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:25,345
A glorious good
morning, gentlemen.

201
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,554
Hi, guys.

202
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:27,722
Sure gave me a scare.

203
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,182
Almost dropped this box.

204
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,643
Well, I didn't expect
you, but welcome.

205
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,521
Thinking it over, I
came to the conclusion

206
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,356
you might need
a lawyer after all.

207
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:37,691
And an engineer, too.

208
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,901
What about that
trial of yours, Ham?

209
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,653
Oh, the heck with the trial.

210
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,780
I'll let my partner
worry about it.

211
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,701
To heck with the
turnpike, too, okay?

212
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:48,909
Okay.

213
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:49,971
Let's go.

214
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,955
After you, gentlemen.

215
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,291
Let me take that.

216
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,636
It worked, Doc!

217
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,929
It worked!

218
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,478
Well, that's that.

219
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,021
Sure was an expensive way

220
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,773
to throw those
mugs off our tail.

221
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,024
Oh, not really, Monk.

222
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,359
Actually, that robot airplane

223
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,945
was only made of
fabric and plywood.

224
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,239
The dummies...

225
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:51,283
Simply dummies.

226
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:55,454
Besides, we've wanted to test this
remote control system for some time,

227
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,662
right, Tom?

228
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,373
And we sure did.

229
00:24:58,582 --> 00:24:59,624
Well, gentlemen,

230
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,334
let's be on our way.

231
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:05,505
Yeah. I want to see what
that Hidalgo place looks like.

232
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,012
Before we go...

233
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,390
Let us remember our code--

234
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,518
let us strive every
moment of our lives

235
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:22,772
to make ourselves better and
better to the best of our ability

236
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,775
so that all may profit by it.

237
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,861
Let us think of the right

238
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,740
and lend our assistance
to all who may need it,

239
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:34,659
with no regard for
anything but justice.

240
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:38,371
Let us take what
comes with a smile

241
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,624
without loss of courage.

242
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:44,377
Let us be considerate
of our country,

243
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:47,088
our fellow citizens,

244
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:51,718
and our associates in
everything we say and do.

245
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:55,347
Let us do right to all...

246
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,057
And wrong no man.

247
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,529
Good evening.

248
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,537
Ah, to your health,
Captain Seas.

249
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,745
Everything worked out

250
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,081
just the way you planned it.

251
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,625
I wish I could
believe you, Borden.

252
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,419
I didn't think Doc Savage

253
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,337
would be that easy to eliminate.

254
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,881
I tell you he's dead,
and his gang are dead.

255
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,594
I blasted them out of
the sky into a million bits.

256
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:18,597
You saw no
parachutes, no survivors?

257
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:19,973
Aye. Not a one.

258
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,142
Believe me, the
papers are burned,

259
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,769
and Savage and his
crummy five are finished.

260
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,481
And, uh, Molo's body?

261
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,774
Ah, me and Cheelok,

262
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,651
we snatched him
from where he fell

263
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,320
and dumped him
into the East River.

264
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,528
Oh,

265
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,823
have a drink, captain.

266
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:40,660
To poor, departed souls.

267
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,747
May they rest in pieces.

268
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:45,790
Heh. Ha ha ha ha...

269
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,334
He is telling the truth?

270
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:49,461
Absolutely.

271
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:53,965
And perhaps now we will
share a bit of the wealth,

272
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,800
won't we, sir?

273
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,677
You bet your life, Kulkan.

274
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,012
Both of you.

275
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:10,357
You like money, eh?

276
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,484
Oh, sure, poopsie.

277
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,110
Well, you listen to me.

278
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,404
I started out in a sideshow,

279
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,824
got into the swing of
things, and made millions,

280
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,534
but it's nothing,

281
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,912
nothing compared
to what's ahead.

282
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,872
Oh, ha ha ha...

283
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,381
Yes, I knew your father,

284
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,757
Professor Savage, senior,

285
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:18,966
very well.

286
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,052
He was a good man.

287
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,139
We were very close friends,

288
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,765
and his death

289
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,225
was a personal tragedy for me.

290
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:31,938
I'm told he died of a
rare tropical disease.

291
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:33,857
Yeah. The professor
contracted it

292
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:35,525
during his last trip

293
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,694
into the jungles
of the interior.

294
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:40,280
By the time he
returned to Hidalgo,

295
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,699
red and green blotches

296
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,118
had broken out on his skin.

297
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,162
Do you know of anyone

298
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,623
who might have had reason to...

299
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,459
Murder my father?

300
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:53,960
On the contrary,

301
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,087
the professor was
loved and respected

302
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:57,797
by the people of Hidalgo.

303
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,674
He set up a hospital

304
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,301
here in the capital city,

305
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,595
established schools

306
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:04,971
in rural villages,

307
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,974
and even taught
first aid and sanitation

308
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,101
to remote tribes.

309
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,644
In fact,

310
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:14,522
one of the tribes,
out of gratitude,

311
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,357
gave him several kilometers

312
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,193
of their hereditary land.

313
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,111
Undoubtedly,

314
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,406
the land is mosquito and
snake infested jungle--

315
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:24,657
worthless.

316
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,577
But it was a sincere gesture.

317
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,746
May I ask a question, Doc,

318
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,247
if you don't mind?

319
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,166
Why, of course, Ham. Go ahead.

320
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,959
Thanks.

321
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,087
Mr. President...

322
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,716
Was the grant to
Professor Savage

323
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,510
officially recorded?

324
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:44,803
The transfer was registered

325
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,263
with the land recorder's office.

326
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,599
I remember directing him there.

327
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,268
May we, then, see the deed?

328
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:53,078
Of course.

329
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,479
Colonel Ramirez,

330
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:58,274
see that the deed is
brought over here at once.

331
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,423
Señorita Flores.

332
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:54,080
This is the way my secretary
found it, Señor Presidente--

333
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,540
empty.

334
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,501
The documents are gone.

335
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,963
Perhaps it will show up.

336
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,424
No, it will not.

337
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,678
I'm not surprised
the deed is missing.

338
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,892
In fact, I rather expected it.

339
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,436
But we will not turn around

340
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,063
and fly back to New York.

341
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,482
We are going to visit that tribe

342
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:24,903
who so graciously gave
that land to my father.

343
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,698
Now, if someone
will be kind enough

344
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,700
to explain how we get there...

345
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,118
Oh, well, uh...

346
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,661
Well, unfortunately, señor,

347
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,289
we do not know the
name of the tribe.

348
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,708
Uh, it could be any
one of hundreds of tribes

349
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,877
isolated in the jungle.

350
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,837
Of course...

351
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,506
I could try to locate a guide.

352
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,010
Uh, maybe a native who
traveled with your father.

353
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,763
I think Don Rubio
has a good idea.

354
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:53,306
Let him find a guide.

355
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,016
It, uh,

356
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,769
it may take a few days.

357
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,020
We'll wait.

358
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,647
Ah.

359
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,650
In that case, I invite you all

360
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,652
to stay at the
government's residence

361
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,154
as our most honored guests.

362
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,173
Thank you.

363
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:11,032
We appreciate your generosity.

364
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,993
This way, please.

365
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,549
Oh, there's just one more thing.

366
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,970
May I respectfully request

367
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:34,430
an autopsy be performed
upon my father?

368
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,516
Of course. If you wish.

369
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,811
Gracias, Señor Presidente.

370
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,938
No hay de qué, Caballero.

371
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,027
Yes, I am positive.

372
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,697
Doc Savage and
his men are alive.

373
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,032
I was with them
less than an hour ago

374
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,701
in the office of El Presidente.

375
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,537
No, I am not dreaming!

376
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,707
Their photograph will be
in the newspaper tomorrow.

377
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:03,167
Yes, but fortunat--

378
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,669
yes, but for--

379
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,422
fortunately, I think quickly!

380
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,965
Will you listen to me?

381
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:11,634
They are not leaving
Hidalgo for a few days,

382
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,177
understand?

383
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:15,887
Yes, sir.

384
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,641
Yes, sir. Yeah.

385
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,685
I guarantee it.

386
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,186
Yes, sir.

387
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:24,188
Yes, sir.

388
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,773
Yes, sir.

389
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:27,191
Yes, sir.

390
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,028
Yes, sir.

391
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:38,703
Ah!

392
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,538
What's the matter, honey?

393
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:41,998
That...

394
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,085
That no-good pilot Borden.

395
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,810
Ahh.

396
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:23,705
Ahh.

397
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,422
Eh...

398
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,549
Aah!

399
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,343
Ouch!

400
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,683
Ah!

401
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,234
Aah!

402
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,047
Ooh!

403
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,891
Come on! Come--

404
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:30,689
No!

405
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,985
Oh. Oh!

406
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,570
Aah!

407
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:44,537
Ow!

408
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,997
Ooh!

409
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:48,874
Oh.

410
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,127
Ohh.

411
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,335
Ohhh.

412
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,483
Ay, que guapo

413
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:15,669
¿te Mira?

414
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:16,693
Sí, bien.

415
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:19,779
Oye, que estan mi--

416
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,324
oye!

417
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:40,635
Aye-yiii....

418
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:41,844
Que chulo.

419
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:55,191
Old Doc gets the
girls every time.

420
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,168
Yeah.

421
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,693
That is one good reason

422
00:37:57,902 --> 00:37:59,987
not to neglect daily
exercise, my friends.

423
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:01,530
Singularly remarkable.

424
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:02,739
No matter where he is,

425
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:03,823
no matter what he's doing,

426
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,327
two hours of exercise every day.

427
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,287
Now, if you'd follow
Doc's good example,

428
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,623
you might lose
some of that ugly fat

429
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,083
and start to resemble
a human being

430
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,585
instead of a clumsy baboon.

431
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,801
Stop where you are, you swine,

432
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,636
or you'll be crisp bacon

433
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,471
for breakfast tomorrow morning.

434
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,640
You touch one
hair on that piglet,

435
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,475
and I'll crisp your bacon!

436
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:30,684
Hold him!

437
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,981
Monk. Huh?

438
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,983
You know Ham
wouldn't hurt a fly.

439
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:39,485
His sword will only put
you to sleep for awhile.

440
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:43,697
Come on.

441
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:26,823
May I?

442
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:27,992
Oh.

443
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:30,494
Thank you.

444
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,663
Juan Lopez Morales is my name.

445
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,623
I am the coroner of Hidalgo.

446
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:35,875
Oh, I see.

447
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,668
Let me get a towel.

448
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:44,550
Well?

449
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,218
Hey, fellas, look.

450
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,181
Could be trouble.

451
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:57,897
And the autopsy disclosed

452
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,232
a residue of some
strange substance.

453
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,528
Ah, Mr. Mayfair.

454
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,906
I recognize you from the
picture in time magazine.

455
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,616
Very happy to meet you--

456
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:10,076
such a famous authority

457
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:12,536
in the field of
analytic chemistry.

458
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:13,745
Everything all right?

459
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,373
Certainly.

460
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,957
Señor Morales here

461
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,668
is the coroner of Hidalgo.

462
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:21,045
Oh.

463
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,839
So, you liked my picture, huh?

464
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,674
He didn't say he liked it.

465
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,676
He said he saw it.

466
00:40:27,885 --> 00:40:29,804
Señor Morales was just giving me

467
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:31,430
the report on the autopsy.

468
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,016
Yes, I was saying
that in the skin tissue

469
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:35,684
of Professor Savage's
hands and face

470
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,479
a residue of some foreign
substance was detected.

471
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:41,857
And I must confess, I have
not been able to identify it.

472
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,484
Did you bring the slides?

473
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:44,693
Indeed.

474
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:46,237
I anticipated you and Mr. Savage

475
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,739
might want to study
them yourselves.

476
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,950
Gustavo.

477
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,279
Doc, what's going on?

478
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,281
Don't come in here.
Stay where you are.

479
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,457
Shh. Doc's inside.

480
00:42:28,547 --> 00:42:29,673
I thought I heard--

481
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:30,925
shh. We all did.

482
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:56,909
Hey, Doc.

483
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,117
Doc.

484
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:02,206
Everything OK, Doc?

485
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,667
Hey, Doc!

486
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,210
Is anything wrong, Doc?

487
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,964
Doc! Doc?

488
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:12,967
We'll come in, Doc, all right?

489
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:16,780
Doc, is everything all right?

490
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:17,572
Yeah.

491
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:18,448
I heard a shot.

492
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,266
What happened, Doc?

493
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,977
I don't know.

494
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,980
I really don't know.

495
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,343
Hello.

496
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,808
How do you do, Mr. Savage?

497
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:03,910
Oh, I'm not Doc.

498
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,561
My name's Monk.

499
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:09,523
Uh, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew
Blodgett Mayfair at your service.

500
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,193
I'm one of Doc
Savage's assistants.

501
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,779
Is there anything I can
do to help, miss, uh...

502
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:17,031
Karen.

503
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:19,617
I'm Karen and she's Adriana.

504
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:21,160
Well, lovely ladies,

505
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:22,620
what can I do to help you?

506
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,997
We're friends of Captain Seas.

507
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,082
He read in the newspapers

508
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,001
about Mr. Savage and his friends

509
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,586
staying in Hidalgo
for a few days.

510
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,505
So, he asked us to personally
invite all of you to dinner

511
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:34,965
on his yacht.

512
00:44:35,174 --> 00:44:36,216
Oh.

513
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,677
That's very nice.

514
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:40,596
But who's Captain Seas?

515
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,765
He's a very rich man.

516
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:45,601
He owns that big yacht
just outside the bay.

517
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,854
Boy. Wait till you see it.

518
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:52,191
The captain would
be extremely honored.

519
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:55,736
He's most anxious to meet the famous
Doc Savage and his amazing men.

520
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,237
Well, I'm sorry.

521
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:58,489
I'm very sorry,

522
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,950
but Doc ain't got no
free time at the moment.

523
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:05,412
Why don't you come
back in a week or so, okay?

524
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,374
Captain Seas will
be so disappointed.

525
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:09,667
Ah, I'm sorry.

526
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,127
Maybe then-- in a couple weeks.

527
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,672
Please tell Captain Seas

528
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,880
we'd be delighted.

529
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,091
Ohh.

530
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,676
I presume you lovely ladies

531
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,386
will be present also.

532
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:22,471
Oh, swell.

533
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:42,782
Welcome, Savage.

534
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,702
Proud to have you aboard.

535
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,704
Good evening, Captain Seas.

536
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:47,912
Good evening, ladies.

537
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:49,707
Hello, Mr. Savage.

538
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:50,999
Hello, Colonel Mayfair.

539
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,919
So nice to see both of you.

540
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:57,381
Oh. So many of you...

541
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:59,007
And all so handsome.

542
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:00,718
Hot sarsaparilla.

543
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:01,927
Savage...

544
00:46:02,136 --> 00:46:03,595
This way, please.

545
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:04,804
Thank you.

546
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,147
I've heard a great
deal about you.

547
00:46:13,355 --> 00:46:14,332
Scientist,

548
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:15,333
explorer,

549
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,084
inventor,

550
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:17,276
criminologist.

551
00:46:17,484 --> 00:46:19,945
Some people even
say you're a magician--

552
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:21,947
at least when it comes

553
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:24,158
to remarkable escapes.

554
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,659
Holy cow.

555
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:28,787
What a plum-dingy yacht this is.

556
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:29,996
A necessity...

557
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:31,248
Uh, not a luxury.

558
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:32,666
Oh.

559
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,959
Oh, please, make
yourself comfortable.

560
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:35,461
Sit down, gentlemen.

561
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:36,669
Thank you.

562
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,967
It serves as my permanent home

563
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:44,970
as well as my
business headquarters.

564
00:46:45,179 --> 00:46:47,473
Just what is your business,

565
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:48,807
Captain Seas?

566
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:51,518
It changes from day to day...

567
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:52,811
But basically,

568
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,314
what I do is
recognize opportunities

569
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:57,775
and seize them.

570
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:59,902
That why they call
you Captain Seas?

571
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,320
Ha ha ha ha.

572
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:04,156
Very good. Very good.

573
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,365
Ha ha ha ha.

574
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:06,574
No.

575
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:08,911
I've made so many voyages

576
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,537
to all corners of the world,

577
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:13,207
that I adopted the name seas.

578
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:14,392
S...

579
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:15,393
E...

580
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,394
A...

581
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,418
S.

582
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,712
My real name

583
00:47:18,921 --> 00:47:20,506
is absolutely unpronounceable.

584
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:25,177
Champagne?

585
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:26,678
No, thank you.

586
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,639
Perhaps something
a bit more potent--

587
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,766
scotch, vodka, bourbon?

588
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:32,643
I'll have a coke, please.

589
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,728
And, uh, you gentlemen?

590
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:36,772
Same for me.

591
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,649
I think I'd prefer a lemonade.

592
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,692
Yeah, me, too.

593
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,361
Yeah, make mine a...

594
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,570
Root beer.

595
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,492
Uh, if it's not too
exiguous a request...

596
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,537
Could I have a glass of milk?

597
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:53,080
Ew.

598
00:47:58,377 --> 00:47:59,628
Tell me, Savage,

599
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:01,463
what brings you and your friends

600
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:03,382
to the republic of Hidalgo?

601
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,593
Very few people even
know of its existence.

602
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:09,096
My father passed
away in Hidalgo.

603
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:12,683
We came to pay
our last respects.

604
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,018
I'm truly sorry.

605
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:17,729
My deepest sympathies.

606
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:21,024
Chow!

607
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:22,233
I mean...

608
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:23,401
Dinner is served.

609
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,596
What a meal.

610
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:52,931
You mind if I loosen my belt?

611
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:55,976
You'll have to
forgive my friend.

612
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:58,896
As a child, he was so
busy studying chemistry,

613
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:01,398
he never learned any manners.

614
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:06,069
Please, please. I'm sure my
chef would take it as a compliment.

615
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:07,278
Uh, cigar?

616
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:08,864
No, thank you.

617
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,283
Cigarette?

618
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:12,534
Thank you, no.

619
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,286
Oh, I should've guessed.

620
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,873
You and your friends
don't smoke either.

621
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,833
I'll have one, if I may.

622
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,544
Why, yes, of course.

623
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:24,421
Thank you.

624
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,756
Uh, light?

625
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,966
Oh, no thanks. I...

626
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:29,635
I have one of my own.

627
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,722
Uh, Karen...

628
00:49:33,931 --> 00:49:35,265
Adriana.

629
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:39,186
If you'll excuse us, gentlemen.

630
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:44,149
So nice to have made
your acquaintance.

631
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:45,651
Oh. You men--

632
00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:47,653
always talking business.

633
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,495
Toodle-oo.

634
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:57,788
Toodle-oo.

635
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:05,337
To tell the truth...

636
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:08,507
I didn't think we'd ever meet.

637
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:10,509
I rather assumed we would.

638
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,010
Ha ha ha.

639
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:15,472
You are indeed a
most unusual man.

640
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:17,140
You know...

641
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:18,684
Under different circumstances,

642
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:20,644
we possibly could've
become friends,

643
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,646
since we're both adventurers--

644
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:25,232
each in our own way.

645
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,527
But circumstances
are not different.

646
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:32,364
Anyway,

647
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,533
I'm glad you
enjoyed your dinner.

648
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:38,620
Because it was your last.

649
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,708
And you, sir.

650
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:44,960
Enjoy your last cigarette.

651
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,627
Ooh!

652
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:28,836
Aah!

653
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:48,732
Come on!

654
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,108
Come on!

655
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:40,200
Let's get out.

656
00:52:44,621 --> 00:52:45,997
Aah!

657
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,169
Come on. This way.

658
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,642
Holy cow. Into the drink!

659
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,390
Searchlights!

660
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:39,945
Hold your fire!

661
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:50,247
What happened to them?

662
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,626
Move out the ship.

663
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,774
I am sorry, Señor Savage,

664
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:19,025
but there is no yacht

665
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,528
such as the one
you have described.

666
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:24,656
You, yourself, heard what
the harbor master said.

667
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,158
My patrol boats, too,
searched the bay--

668
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:28,660
the whole area--

669
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:29,995
for hours...

670
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:32,205
And found nothing.

671
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,000
But we don't give up.

672
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,669
Our men are still out there...

673
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:39,170
Looking.

674
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:40,672
To the residence.

675
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,007
Can't we have lunch first

676
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:44,009
in a nice little cantina?

677
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:46,011
Do what you like, Monk.

678
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:49,180
Take me to the land
recorder's office, if you will.

679
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:50,389
But señor...

680
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:52,391
Yes, señor.

681
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,685
Vamanos!

682
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:54,870
No, no.

683
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:55,871
If you behave like a pig,

684
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:57,647
no lunch.

685
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:09,701
May I help you?

686
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:11,202
Why, I believe so.

687
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:13,163
My name is Clark Savage junior,

688
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,181
and I was hoping--

689
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,124
yes, I recognize you.

690
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,501
You are the son of
Professor Savage.

691
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,794
That's right.

692
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:21,379
I am sorry.

693
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,173
He was a very fine man.

694
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,424
Thank you.

695
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:29,012
Um, is Señor Gorro in?

696
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,972
No, he is out for lunch,

697
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:32,724
but he will be back soon

698
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:35,226
if you would like to wait.

699
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:41,691
Uh, señorita, may I
ask you a question?

700
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Yes, of course.

701
00:56:43,026 --> 00:56:44,861
Well, now, would
you have any idea

702
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,781
of what might have
happened to the, uh,

703
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:51,659
deed my father
registered at this office?

704
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:53,203
It's a complete mystery, señor.

705
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,914
I met your father
when he came here

706
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:58,041
with the deed and a map.

707
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,793
We made copies
of these documents,

708
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:01,753
and we sent them
to you in New York.

709
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,588
Didn't you receive them?

710
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:05,090
There was a fire.

711
00:57:05,298 --> 00:57:08,176
They were destroyed before
I had a chance to read them.

712
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:11,054
But if there are no
records, that is terrible.

713
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:14,182
Well, now, you
handled the documents.

714
00:57:14,391 --> 00:57:15,391
Yes.

715
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:18,061
Is there anything you can
remember about them?

716
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,437
Oh, yes.

717
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:25,151
It is very strange, señor.

718
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,861
The deed was signed by the chief

719
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,030
of the Quetzamal tribe,

720
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:31,116
but there is no Quetzamal tribe.

721
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:33,618
According to the history books,

722
00:57:33,827 --> 00:57:36,121
it became extinct 500 years ago,

723
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:39,124
disappearing into the
jungle without a trace.

724
00:57:39,332 --> 00:57:40,625
But the deed is a trace.

725
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:42,043
The map is a trace.

726
00:57:42,252 --> 00:57:45,004
I said according to
the history books.

727
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:49,801
When I was a child, I
lived in a small village

728
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,344
far away in the mountains.

729
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,012
The old people there

730
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:55,974
used to tell strange
stories of the Quetzamals.

731
00:57:56,182 --> 00:58:00,145
They said they still
existed not very far away,

732
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,814
but we could never
go to their place

733
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:06,317
because it was over
the edge of the world.

734
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,861
Can you believe this?

735
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:11,405
Yes.

736
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,118
Yes, I think I can.

737
00:58:19,456 --> 00:58:21,166
My father got there.

738
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:24,294
Somehow, I must get there, too.

739
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:27,172
You know, I was
planning on returning

740
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,341
to my village in a few months...

741
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,304
But perhaps I can leave
now and guide you there.

742
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,431
Do you mean that?

743
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,641
Yes, absolutely.

744
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,603
When would you like to go?

745
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:45,315
Well, do you think you
could be ready to leave...

746
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:46,500
In the morning?

747
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:47,460
Yes.

748
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:48,484
Miss, uh...

749
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,612
My name is Mona Flores.

750
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,155
You may call me Mona.

751
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:55,158
You may call me Doc.

752
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,369
Yes.

753
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:17,138
Uh, Señor Savage.

754
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:18,848
Señor Gorro.

755
00:59:19,057 --> 00:59:22,393
Uh, are you all right?

756
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:23,686
Shouldn't I be?

757
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:26,898
Yes, uh, of--of
course, of course.

758
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,274
It's just that I heard

759
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,485
there was some kind
of problem last night.

760
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:31,693
No.

761
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:34,447
No problem whatsoever.

762
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:37,659
Adios, Don Rubio.

763
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:44,373
Flores!

764
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:26,392
I've taken care of everything...

765
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:27,644
Personally.

766
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:28,852
Good.

767
01:01:28,895 --> 01:01:30,772
I can't understand it.

768
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,065
You had 'em right in your hands,

769
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,524
and you let 'em escape.

770
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:34,710
I mean, I thought you said

771
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:35,544
you had everything taken--

772
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:36,462
Shut up!

773
01:01:36,486 --> 01:01:37,486
Ye-yes, sir.

774
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:41,949
They--they'll never
find the place.

775
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:45,995
Only those two know the way.

776
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:47,914
That dirty little
tramp in my office,

777
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,707
she could never lead
them to Quetzamal.

778
01:01:49,916 --> 01:01:51,542
That's what I'm counting on.

779
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:53,670
Lots of money is at stake.

780
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:56,547
Uh, talking about lots of money,

781
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:59,467
I could use a little money.

782
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:02,720
Maybe a small advance
on my share, por favor?

783
01:02:02,929 --> 01:02:03,929
Don't bother me now.

784
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:05,056
Uh, but sir,

785
01:02:05,264 --> 01:02:07,517
don't I deserve a
little consideration?

786
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,727
I mean, after all
now, I was the one

787
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:13,189
who brought the deed and
the map to your attention.

788
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:15,692
Uh, we are partners, are we not?

789
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,195
When Savage is out of the way,

790
01:02:19,404 --> 01:02:21,656
that's when we'll
settle accounts.

791
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,616
Any objections?

792
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:28,121
No, sir.

793
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,339
Little touch there.

794
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:39,632
Little stir.

795
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:40,883
No two ways about it,

796
01:02:41,092 --> 01:02:42,069
I am a great cook.

797
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,678
Super chef.

798
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,347
Here we go.

799
01:02:48,683 --> 01:02:50,309
Boy, I'm hungry as a bear.

800
01:02:50,518 --> 01:02:51,602
You mean ape,

801
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:54,480
hungry as an ape.

802
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:55,898
One of these days,

803
01:02:56,107 --> 01:02:57,525
that two-bit clotheshorse

804
01:02:57,734 --> 01:02:59,610
is gonna go too far.

805
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:01,154
Mm-mmm.

806
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,742
Needs a little agua, I think.

807
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:06,950
Would you, uh...

808
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:08,786
I will get it.

809
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:10,037
Okay.

810
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:41,652
It's all right. It's all right.

811
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,654
Renny!

812
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:46,616
Take her.

813
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:52,789
Monk, bring me a vial.

814
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,957
Right away, Doc.

815
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,669
Jumping jellybeans.

816
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:00,797
That snake is the spitting image

817
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:03,216
of the one painted
on the native's chest

818
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,301
at the Eastern
Cranmoor building.

819
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:33,973
Doc, don't worry.

820
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:36,517
My village is just
around the bend.

821
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,612
I'm gonna get some more water.

822
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,629
Muchas gracias, señorita.

823
01:06:04,837 --> 01:06:07,089
Moocho Garcia, me, too.

824
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,637
Delicious, delicious.

825
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:13,845
No, no, no.

826
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,640
It is only a story,

827
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:17,391
a legend.

828
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,977
There is no such a
place as Quetzamal.

829
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:22,980
But Don Jose, my grandfather

830
01:06:23,189 --> 01:06:25,524
once told me that you
and he made a trip there

831
01:06:25,733 --> 01:06:27,526
when you were very young boys.

832
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,820
I never been to Quetzamal,

833
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,323
only to the edge of the world.

834
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:33,950
Don Jose...

835
01:06:35,785 --> 01:06:39,038
Do you think you
could lead us there?

836
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,665
It's very important.

837
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:42,959
Por favor. Please.

838
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,755
Very well,

839
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:50,257
but only as a favor to Mona

840
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:51,466
because I know her

841
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,553
since she was
such a little señorita.

842
01:06:54,762 --> 01:06:55,972
Ah, thank you.

843
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:01,352
Come back here tomorrow at dawn.

844
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,603
Gracias, señor.

845
01:07:02,812 --> 01:07:04,480
Gracias.

846
01:07:04,689 --> 01:07:06,065
Adios.

847
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:07,441
Adios.

848
01:07:10,695 --> 01:07:11,862
We need more horses,

849
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,073
and we must have
food from the village.

850
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,075
That's all been taken care of.

851
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:18,661
But it may take
days to get there.

852
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,496
You've brought
us this far, Mona,

853
01:07:20,705 --> 01:07:21,705
and I thank you,

854
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,541
but it would be
wrong to expose you

855
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,626
to any more danger
on our account.

856
01:07:27,003 --> 01:07:28,963
But I want to go with you.

857
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,798
I'm not afraid, Doc.

858
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:32,883
Well, I know you're not...

859
01:07:33,926 --> 01:07:35,261
But for your own safety,

860
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,805
I think it's best
you remain here,

861
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:40,016
this village with
your own people.

862
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,100
No.

863
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:47,481
I love you.

864
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:57,742
Ah, there's no room in
my life for love, Mona.

865
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,119
But why, Doc?

866
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,917
There was a girl once.

867
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,335
We were to be married.

868
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:09,544
She was kidnapped

869
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,172
by the men I had been pursuing.

870
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:14,258
They threatened to kill
her if I didn't drop the chase.

871
01:08:14,467 --> 01:08:17,053
I gave in. I had to.

872
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:21,432
Later, when she was
returned safely to me,

873
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,685
I realized there could
never be a future for us.

874
01:08:24,894 --> 01:08:27,063
I realized if I were to do

875
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:29,607
what I had chosen with my life,

876
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,108
there could never be a loved one

877
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:33,986
who could be used against me...

878
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:37,156
Or harmed because of me.

879
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,367
Do you understand?

880
01:08:42,078 --> 01:08:43,913
I suppose so.

881
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:51,795
Mona...

882
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:54,590
You're a brick.

883
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:38,545
I'm gonna watch the horses.

884
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:41,548
Yeah. Okay.

885
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,432
Here it is,

886
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:51,684
the edge of the world.

887
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,061
Below in the valley
of the vanished,

888
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:55,646
live the Quetzamals.

889
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,482
There is no way down.

890
01:11:58,691 --> 01:12:00,526
And now adios, amigos.

891
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:01,734
I must return.

892
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,507
Vaya con dios!

893
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:25,301
Remember me to Mona!

894
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:27,468
I will!

895
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:31,724
There must be a way down.

896
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,976
My father found it.

897
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,603
Well, let's look for it.

898
01:12:58,751 --> 01:13:00,669
Doc!

899
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:02,129
These rocks.

900
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:05,299
Unordinary divarication.

901
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:12,389
Right.

902
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:26,070
What is it, Doc?

903
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:29,198
It's a message...

904
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:32,534
From my father.

905
01:13:32,743 --> 01:13:34,745
"La-too-ah...

906
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:36,497
Spin-oh-sa."

907
01:13:36,705 --> 01:13:37,705
La-too-ah-spin-oh-sa.

908
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,124
Who's he?

909
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,543
He ain't a he. It's
an it, Harvard man,

910
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:44,213
a rare semi-tropical bush, see?

911
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:45,421
Neh!

912
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:12,574
Gentlemen, my father was right.

913
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:14,284
Bring the horses.

914
01:14:39,935 --> 01:14:41,437
Whoa!

915
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:43,730
You all right, Monk?

916
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:45,649
Yeah, I'm OK.

917
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:13,153
Johnny?

918
01:16:21,328 --> 01:16:25,249
Jupiter, what a phenomenosity!

919
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:26,833
It's gold.

920
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:29,962
A pool of gold.

921
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:41,348
Gentlemen, I think
I'll go scout around.

922
01:16:41,557 --> 01:16:42,849
You remain here.

923
01:16:43,058 --> 01:16:44,351
Sure thing, Doc.

924
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,537
Take care.

925
01:16:45,561 --> 01:16:46,562
Don't worry.

926
01:16:52,359 --> 01:16:53,819
Gee...

927
01:16:54,027 --> 01:16:55,821
Those are Captain Seas' men

928
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:57,364
storing gold in that hut.

929
01:17:16,508 --> 01:17:18,302
Get in there. Keep quiet.

930
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:19,510
Put your hands up!

931
01:17:21,388 --> 01:17:23,181
Up! Up!

932
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,683
Get moving!

933
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:26,685
I say! It's deplorable!

934
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,103
Hurry up.

935
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:31,106
I'm a lawyer. I'll
sue you for this.

936
01:17:31,315 --> 01:17:33,317
Simply deplorable. Horrible.

937
01:17:38,864 --> 01:17:40,699
I followed you.

938
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:43,535
I wanted to be with...

939
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:44,744
I'm sorry.

940
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,413
Get moving.

941
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:06,058
My compliments, gentlemen.

942
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:09,061
You have eluded
me at every turn.

943
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:12,564
You have even managed
to find the pool of gold,

944
01:18:12,773 --> 01:18:16,318
but this time,
there is no escape.

945
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:17,986
Mr. Seas...

946
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:21,114
As the representative
of Clark Savage Jr.,

947
01:18:21,323 --> 01:18:24,701
I must vehemently
protest in his absence

948
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:27,120
and warn you that your actions

949
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:30,624
are contradictory to the
existing laws of the United States,

950
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,834
as well as the
republic of Hidalgo.

951
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:35,045
Heh heh heh! You don't say?

952
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:36,755
You are not only trespassing

953
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:39,091
on my client's legal property,

954
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:43,428
duly registered with the land
recorder's office of Hidalgo,

955
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:48,183
but you are also unlawfully
exploiting his inheritance,

956
01:18:48,392 --> 01:18:52,604
as well as the labor of
the natives of this tribe.

957
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:55,691
This is the law
here, Harvard man.

958
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:58,151
The law of the jungle.

959
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,569
You dirty skunk!

960
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:00,778
Hyah!

961
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:02,322
Yes! Get him!

962
01:19:11,415 --> 01:19:12,791
You!

963
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:15,210
Get rid of them right now!

964
01:19:18,714 --> 01:19:20,465
Get rid of them, I said!

965
01:19:25,137 --> 01:19:26,555
I will prepare the potion.

966
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:27,973
No, Kulkan.

967
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:31,143
The green death is a
heritage from our ancestors,

968
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:34,062
only to defend ourselves
against our enemies.

969
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:37,607
It has not been used
for hundreds of years.

970
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:39,109
You do not understand.

971
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:41,695
Captain seas is our friend.

972
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:43,739
His enemies are our enemies.

973
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:46,700
You are deserting
your own people.

974
01:19:46,908 --> 01:19:48,702
You are joining with strangers

975
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,662
who have taken away our freedom.

976
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:52,122
Shut up, you old fool.

977
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:55,417
I told you I'd make
you rich, didn't I?

978
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,295
Wealth means nothing to us.

979
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,380
Put him with the others.

980
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,607
Take them away!

981
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:23,779
Now get Savage.

982
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:25,614
He can't be far away.

983
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:53,350
Arankanalla!

984
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:55,185
Arankanalla!

985
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:03,235
Areeabooboo!

986
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:04,486
Areeabooboo!

987
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:24,214
That was truly noble of
you, Monk, what you did.

988
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:27,592
I want you to know
that I appreciate it.

989
01:21:27,801 --> 01:21:28,802
That's okay.

990
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,262
Anytime.

991
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,514
You could have
been killed, you know.

992
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:38,603
Oh, uh, well,
anything for a pal.

993
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:43,024
Say, chief, how come you
speak such good English?

994
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:45,735
Professor Savage saw to that.

995
01:21:45,944 --> 01:21:47,153
Mmm!

996
01:21:51,449 --> 01:21:53,618
What happens now?

997
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:56,746
We're all doomed to die...

998
01:21:56,955 --> 01:21:58,331
A horrible death.

999
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:47,964
This place gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

1000
01:22:48,173 --> 01:22:50,050
We got to bust out of here.

1001
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:53,053
An unconfuted veracity,
but how, may I ask,

1002
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:54,679
with our hands tied
behind our backs

1003
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:55,889
and locked in this--

1004
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:57,097
that's it!

1005
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:58,391
That's it! Untie me.

1006
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,144
If only they hadn't taken
my sword cane away.

1007
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:03,021
If I had my thingamajig...

1008
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:06,566
An unravelable
configuration of knots.

1009
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:07,775
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

1010
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:08,817
I got a idea!

1011
01:23:08,902 --> 01:23:10,153
Habeas Corpus!

1012
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:13,406
Sorry, Ham. I know
you don't like that name.

1013
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:14,741
Oh, that's all right...

1014
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:15,950
Pal.

1015
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:19,579
H.C., you still in my pocket?

1016
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:24,501
Well, get out and do
that trick I taught you.

1017
01:23:47,399 --> 01:23:48,733
Good boy, Habeas!

1018
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:49,919
Well done!

1019
01:23:49,943 --> 01:23:51,027
Well, come on, Monk.

1020
01:23:51,236 --> 01:23:53,405
Hurry up and untie me.

1021
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:16,761
Come on, fellas.

1022
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,555
Let's move that rock
and fight our way out.

1023
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,557
Yeah. Fight our way out!

1024
01:24:20,765 --> 01:24:22,392
Whoa!

1025
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:52,255
Aah!

1026
01:24:53,882 --> 01:24:54,882
Heh heh heh!

1027
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:57,260
Perfect, Kulkan. Perfect.

1028
01:24:57,469 --> 01:24:58,404
They're finished,

1029
01:24:58,428 --> 01:24:59,804
just like that old professor

1030
01:25:00,013 --> 01:25:01,765
and that liar of a pilot.

1031
01:25:01,973 --> 01:25:05,351
Heh heh heh heh!

1032
01:25:09,773 --> 01:25:11,191
Aah!

1033
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:13,068
Aah!

1034
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:24,996
And we have the papers,
the deed, and the pool of gold.

1035
01:25:25,205 --> 01:25:28,249
Right. Now only Savage remains.

1036
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,960
Uhh!

1037
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:33,588
Tell your men to stand
back, drop their guns.

1038
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:38,009
Have no fear!

1039
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:42,972
Doc Savage is here!

1040
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:45,141
Now tell your men
to open this cave.

1041
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:48,686
Tell them to open the cave,

1042
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:51,231
or you're a dead
man in five seconds.

1043
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:53,274
Open the cave!

1044
01:25:54,442 --> 01:25:55,944
Arankanalla!

1045
01:26:02,951 --> 01:26:05,078
Hypodermic. Antidote.

1046
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:08,206
Inject yourself, then
inject the others.

1047
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:10,875
Hyah! Uhh!

1048
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:20,301
The--the green death!

1049
01:26:33,857 --> 01:26:35,984
Aah!

1050
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:41,489
Oh! Uhh! Aah!

1051
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:44,200
Aah!

1052
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:49,455
Aah!

1053
01:27:09,893 --> 01:27:11,728
Rahhr!

1054
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:13,980
Rahhr!

1055
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:19,068
Rahhr!

1056
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:47,387
Ah!

1057
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,057
Hyah!

1058
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,088
Aah!

1059
01:28:42,443 --> 01:28:43,611
Heh heh heh heh!

1060
01:29:30,366 --> 01:29:32,243
Ah! Ah! Ow!

1061
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:33,494
Ow! Ow!

1062
01:29:33,703 --> 01:29:35,288
Ooh!

1063
01:29:35,496 --> 01:29:37,332
No! Stop!

1064
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,540
Stop!

1065
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:39,709
Thieves!

1066
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:42,003
You won't get away with this!

1067
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:45,214
It belongs to me
and the captain!

1068
01:29:59,604 --> 01:30:01,147
It's my gold!

1069
01:30:01,356 --> 01:30:02,398
It's mine!

1070
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,027
Come back, I say!

1071
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:14,243
Hy...

1072
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:17,330
Aaah!

1073
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:22,043
You won't get away with this!

1074
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:36,182
Come back!

1075
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:37,159
Come back!

1076
01:30:37,183 --> 01:30:38,476
Come back, you!

1077
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,208
Ooh!

1078
01:31:16,556 --> 01:31:17,890
Everyone all right?

1079
01:31:18,099 --> 01:31:20,643
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1080
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:24,647
It's my gold!

1081
01:31:24,856 --> 01:31:26,816
The gold is mine!

1082
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:29,152
What the devil's going on?

1083
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,738
That dynamite must
have triggered an eruption.

1084
01:31:32,947 --> 01:31:36,242
Mother nature aroused,
seeking revenge.

1085
01:31:36,451 --> 01:31:39,036
Come back!

1086
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:47,879
Sure you're okay?

1087
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:49,881
Yes, I'm fine, Doc, but--

1088
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:51,757
Marks on your
face are going away.

1089
01:31:51,966 --> 01:31:54,302
How do you feel?

1090
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:56,970
I feel better.

1091
01:31:57,138 --> 01:31:58,139
Thanks, Monk.

1092
01:31:58,347 --> 01:31:59,116
Yes.

1093
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,033
How about you?

1094
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:01,642
Fine.

1095
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:04,020
The epicenter is quite near.

1096
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:06,481
There should be one
more brief disturbance

1097
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,024
about...

1098
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:09,232
Now.

1099
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:10,485
Whoa!

1100
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:13,839
Habeas! Come back here!

1101
01:33:14,048 --> 01:33:16,217
Habeas Corpus, come back here!

1102
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:17,425
You son of a pig!

1103
01:33:17,468 --> 01:33:19,011
Come back, I tell ya!

1104
01:33:24,475 --> 01:33:25,475
Good boy.

1105
01:33:34,443 --> 01:33:35,443
Good piggy.

1106
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:36,612
Nice piggy.

1107
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:38,155
May I?

1108
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:41,367
Cute piggie.

1109
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:44,161
Help!

1110
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:52,378
Help?

1111
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:57,550
Strange how
history repeats itself.

1112
01:33:57,758 --> 01:34:00,386
First, your father saved
us against the plague.

1113
01:34:00,595 --> 01:34:04,932
Then you came, my son,
to save us from slavery.

1114
01:34:05,141 --> 01:34:07,852
We gave him, as an
expression of gratitude,

1115
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:09,645
the pool of gold.

1116
01:34:09,854 --> 01:34:12,023
Now the land and the gold

1117
01:34:12,231 --> 01:34:15,443
belong to you, Doc Savage.

1118
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:17,695
Thank you, Chief Chaac.

1119
01:34:17,903 --> 01:34:21,282
I promise to continue
my father's work...

1120
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,034
His ideals.

1121
01:34:23,242 --> 01:34:25,703
With this limitless
wealth at my disposal,

1122
01:34:25,911 --> 01:34:27,580
I shall be able
to devote my life

1123
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:29,165
to the cause of justice.

1124
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:32,001
Goodbye.

1125
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:36,505
Goodbye, Doc.

1126
01:34:36,714 --> 01:34:38,215
I will stay here,

1127
01:34:38,424 --> 01:34:42,553
and then I will return to my
village to help my people.

1128
01:34:42,762 --> 01:34:43,763
Will you come back...

1129
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:44,971
Someday?

1130
01:34:45,014 --> 01:34:46,432
I'm sure I will...

1131
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:48,059
Someday.

1132
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:30,768
Are you going to kill me now?

1133
01:35:30,976 --> 01:35:32,728
No. Doc don't
believe in killing,

1134
01:35:32,937 --> 01:35:34,522
not even crooks like you.

1135
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,816
He's got his own methods
of dealing with them.

1136
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:38,025
What methods?

1137
01:35:38,234 --> 01:35:40,027
Well, first we're
going to take you

1138
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:41,987
to a place in upper
New York state,

1139
01:35:42,196 --> 01:35:45,950
where Doc has his own
rehabilitation center.

1140
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,162
There, Doc will perform a
special kind of acupuncture surgery

1141
01:35:50,371 --> 01:35:51,371
on your brain,

1142
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:54,750
which will help rid
you of your evil nature.

1143
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:56,752
He learned about
this kind of stuff

1144
01:35:56,961 --> 01:35:58,045
in a remote monastery

1145
01:35:58,254 --> 01:36:00,172
on his last trip to
China, you see.

1146
01:36:00,381 --> 01:36:04,176
You're also going to be
taught good citizenship

1147
01:36:04,385 --> 01:36:05,928
and an honest trade,

1148
01:36:06,137 --> 01:36:09,974
then one day, you'll leave
the center completely well

1149
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:14,228
and become a respectable
member of society.

1150
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,175
Thanks.

1151
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,326
Thank you, young man.

1152
01:36:38,878 --> 01:36:40,963
Merry Christmas to you!

1153
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:52,056
God bless you, madam.

1154
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,003
This is Clark Savage, Jr.

1155
01:37:21,212 --> 01:37:23,506
I am not currently available.

1156
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:26,008
However, if you wish
to leave a message,

1157
01:37:26,217 --> 01:37:28,010
it will be recorded.

1158
01:37:28,219 --> 01:37:29,678
You may speak now.

1159
01:37:29,887 --> 01:37:31,972
Doc, hey, Doc, listen.

1160
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:33,682
This is an emergency.

1161
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:36,227
I'm at the Warfield drugstore.

1162
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:06,966
Doc, hey, Doc, listen.

1163
01:38:07,174 --> 01:38:08,676
This is an emergency.

1164
01:38:08,884 --> 01:38:10,970
I'm at the Warfield drugstore.

1165
01:38:11,178 --> 01:38:13,764
I just learned something,
something terrible.

1166
01:38:13,973 --> 01:38:15,975
Millions of people
are going to get killed.

1167
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:18,185
You're the only one who--

1168
01:38:18,394 --> 01:38:19,371
ah!

1169
01:38:19,395 --> 01:38:20,372
Argh! Ugh!

1170
01:38:20,396 --> 01:38:21,689
Uhh!

1171
01:40:00,996 --> 01:40:02,039
Savage!
