1
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,392
Most holy lord, almighty father...

2
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,163
Who has permitted on earth
the use of the sword

3
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,132
to oppress the malice of the wicked

4
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,103
and defend justice,

5
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,773
who, for the protection of your people,

6
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,443
thought it fit to institute
the order of chivalry...

7
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,749
Cause your servant here before you,

8
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:38,419
by disposing his heart to goodness,

9
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,923
never to use this sword or another

10
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,360
to injure anyone unjustly,

11
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,596
but let him use it always

12
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,400
to defend the just and the righteous.

13
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,962
I claim the right...

14
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:34,435
To serve Simon Nerra, count of Brittany.

15
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,708
That right belongs to you.

16
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,514
I see your brother has taken to the cross.

17
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,182
I am joining the crusade
of Richard the Lionheart.

18
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,784
He'll be in Paris soon.

19
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,387
You pledged your faith
to the house of Nerra.

20
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,889
I must first be faithful
to myself, Simon.

21
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,258
This english king has promised you

22
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,660
something I cannot.

23
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,229
The greatest knights
of England, Normandy,

24
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,897
and Brittany are with him.

25
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,233
Father.

26
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,836
I am getting old, Simon.

27
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,540
My sword grows heavier
in my hand every day.

28
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,975
Grant me the right
to atone for my sins

29
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,309
before it is too late.

30
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,311
You propose to pay for your sins

31
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,614
by joining a foreign lord in a foreign land

32
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,483
in a battle that isn't your own?

33
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,351
Why fight your countrymen

34
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,654
when a common enemy exists
in the holy land?

35
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,691
First, a knight must be
faithful to his lord.

36
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,193
Has not the house of Nerra
gathered enough land?

37
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,664
The house of Nerra
will have gathered enough land

38
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,501
when the whole of France lies at its feet!

39
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:50,544
Simon, I ask your blessing.

40
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,313
I won't have it, Charles.

41
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,915
Father...

42
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,528
As you wish.

43
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,806
Uncle...

44
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,113
Drink with me, Charles?

45
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,105
Let that blow remind you of your vows.

46
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:57,444
Robert Nerra, you are now lord of bain,

47
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:01,715
and you shall bow to no one but me

48
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:05,018
and god almighty himself!

49
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:34,447
You have earned your spurs.

50
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,552
Now you are one of us.

51
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,501
Bye, my love!

52
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:57,771
Goodbye, my lord.

53
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:58,939
Simon!

54
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,944
Bring my son back alive.

55
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,844
Your father is a proud man today.

56
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,180
We are all proud.

57
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,682
So long ago it seems

58
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,450
since god rode with us into battle.

59
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,187
Now he has given us a new purpose,

60
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:25,058
and yet so many live by the same old rules.

61
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,560
You want no part in this battle.

62
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,663
Why are you with us?

63
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,966
I am a man of loyalty, Robert.

64
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,904
I never claimed to be a man of strength.

65
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,091
En masse!

66
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,763
Hah!

67
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,836
Yah!

68
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,995
Aaah!

69
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,567
Ugh!

70
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,161
Robert!!

71
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,076
Ugh!

72
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,327
No!!

73
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,200
Robert!

74
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,937
Robert!!

75
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,872
Ah!
Oh! Oh!

76
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,105
Ah!
Oh! Oh!

77
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:29,056
Ah!
Oh! Oh!

78
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,496
Oh! Here, you!

79
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,101
Stop! Thief!

80
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,303
Ugh! Ugh!

81
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,608
Here!

82
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,550
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

83
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,092
Ugh!

84
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,928
My ankle!

85
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,338
No, Michael!

86
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,762
Please... I have to stop.

87
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,554
This is our chance
to get back to Paris...

88
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,055
Back home.

89
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,525
What home?

90
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,661
This time I'll...

91
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,464
We'll start our own circus.

92
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,366
We'll gather the finest acts...

93
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,602
We left to get away
from that awful place.

94
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,573
Besides, the roads aren't safe...

95
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,975
Full of evil.

96
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,346
We'll be sold as slaves.

97
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,749
Handsome pay will pave the way.

98
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,451
Paris...

99
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:50,457
You know, maybe everything
that happened tonight

100
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,460
happened for a reason.

101
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,296
Maybe it's an omen, Blanche.

102
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,931
What do you think?

103
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,796
We had nothing to do with it...

104
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,732
I swear we didn't.

105
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:07,734
Excuse me?

106
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,901
Uh...

107
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,103
Didn't the village send you?

108
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,105
What village?

109
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,007
Hmm...

110
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,410
Well, then.
There we have it.

111
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,553
You're going to Paris

112
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,921
to join Richard the Lionheart?

113
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,290
I've seen his banner.

114
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,261
Ugh!

115
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,863
Ugh.

116
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,538
Tell me more.

117
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:11,664
We're traveling alone,
my brother and I.

118
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,203
We're going to Paris.

119
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,539
You won't get far on this foot.

120
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,308
Michael's going to start a circus.

121
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,743
It's a dangerous road.

122
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,714
Right...
Full of evil, slave traders.

123
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,485
And Paris...
What a colorful place.

124
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:37,256
We should travel together.

125
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,626
We know the way.

126
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,465
Alright, then.

127
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,602
My lord, can I help?

128
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,374
I am nobody's lord.

129
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,679
Shhh.

130
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,267
We need shelter.

131
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,203
O-of course, my lord.

132
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,082
Come.

133
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,836
Come along.

134
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,174
Hurry. Hurry.

135
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,719
This way.

136
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,813
Odo will share his room with you.

137
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,348
Now, it's a violent night.

138
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,152
You're to stay in your beds till
morning, no matter what.

139
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,722
Is it the storm?
Is that why you're so...

140
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,390
So nervous?

141
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,525
Something more.

142
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,895
On nights such as these,

143
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:39,198
the devil himself
has been known to call.

144
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,839
What did he mean,
"the devil himself"?

145
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,908
I've heard people tell of a man...

146
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:52,812
The black prince...
A tortured soul,

147
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,916
with eyes as fiery
as the devil himself.

148
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:59,752
No child who's crossed his path

149
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:02,588
has ever been seen again.

150
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:05,758
They just... disappear.

151
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,717
Robert.

152
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,926
A page.

153
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,329
I've always wanted to be a page.

154
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,802
There's nothing to be afraid of.

155
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:53,005
It represents the death of the past...

156
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,808
The birth of a new era...

157
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,944
Our friendship.

158
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,086
The future.

159
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,501
Slavery...

160
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:24,636
Release from slavery...

161
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,073
Throwing off chains.

162
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,475
Our homes...

163
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,578
We've all left our homes.

164
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,980
That's it.

165
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,916
That must be it.

166
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:40,106
But I cannot forgive you for that.

167
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,174
Ugh!

168
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,530
I know.
I saw him.

169
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,377
Abbot!

170
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,017
Sir...

171
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,020
Are you there?

172
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,228
Aah! Aah!

173
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,403
Madelaine...

174
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,041
Madelaine...

175
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:58,010
My brother is dead,

176
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,812
and my son is gone.

177
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,782
Our son will return.

178
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:07,786
When I again have a son,

179
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,389
you shall again have a wife.

180
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:34,213
Someone's coming.

181
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,091
Come on.

182
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,293
Come on!

183
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,460
Ugh!

184
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,474
I missed.

185
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,876
Rah! Yah!

186
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,812
Hah! Hah!

187
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:22,154
Aah! Ugh! Ohhh!

188
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,801
Michael, are you alright?

189
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,469
I think so.

190
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,181
Come on... now!

191
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:11,970
What about us?

192
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,539
Hold on.

193
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,784
Ugh!

194
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,985
Ow! Aah!

195
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,421
Aaah! Oh!

196
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,223
Aaah!

197
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:13,665
They're lost and alone in the forest.

198
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,203
Sooner or later...

199
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,273
I always find the lost.

200
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,485
Hold still.

201
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,695
I missed.

202
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,164
I still can't believe that I missed.

203
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,134
Michael, you've been trained to miss.

204
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,202
They'll find us, you know.

205
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,138
It won't be long.

206
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,473
I hear he never sleeps.

207
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,180
Strike never rests
in a place of danger.

208
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,483
Neither do I.

209
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:18,564
He's never done that...
Not even for king Richard.

210
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,732
This bird belongs to king Richard?

211
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,369
Commanded, of course,
by his personal falconer...

212
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,070
Yours truly, Hugo.

213
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,672
Until I was cap...

214
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,940
Then strike will lead us to your king.

215
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,609
With time.

216
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:31,877
Has he reached Paris?

217
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,244
Soon.

218
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,013
He's going south, you know.

219
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,215
I'm going to join him.

220
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,384
I'll go with you.

221
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,751
I'll go, too.

222
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:40,586
We'll all go!

223
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,788
Hold on, hold on.

224
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:43,989
We?

225
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,024
Let's not be hasty here.

226
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,193
I want no part of this crusade.

227
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,296
I just want a simple circus.
That's all.

228
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,164
As soon as we get to Paris,

229
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,000
Blanche and I are on our way.

230
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,369
You'd rather spend your life
entertaining peasants

231
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,304
for a dish of stew?

232
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,139
Or be paid in jewels and gold,

233
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,708
performing for the court of a king?

234
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,310
Well, I'd rather be alive in Paris than...

235
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,512
Than god knows what

236
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:11,417
in search of a man we may never find!

237
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,619
We'll be lucky to get to Paris.

238
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,889
Two hours I was separated from king Richard

239
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:21,159
before I was thrown into chains...

240
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,694
Just two hours.

241
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,931
Paris isn't so far.
Is it, Robert?

242
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,198
No, Odo...

243
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,969
Not far at all.

244
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,971
We'll be safe in Paris.

245
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,214
My master sends you
with his greetings this Bible.

246
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,450
He found it clutched in the hands

247
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:21,252
of a dead crusader
after the battle of Damascus.

248
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,690
It's quite rare and
very precious.

249
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:35,033
Thank your master for me.

250
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:49,981
His ships have sailed
for the harbor of marseilles.

251
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,983
And you?

252
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,854
Tell him I shall deliver
all the children he can use.

253
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,156
He would expect nothing less.

254
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,597
With your permission, my prince,

255
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,998
I shall take leave.

256
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:10,669
You have many preparations to make.

257
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:14,439
Before you go...

258
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:17,208
I too have a gift.

259
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:35,060
I found it clutched
in the hands of a dead moslem

260
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:38,764
during my crusade.

261
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,233
There is nothing precious about it.

262
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,204
Send your master my greetings.

263
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:06,024
I used to pray to you.

264
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,664
Now it is too late.

265
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:13,524
What do you see, David?

266
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,828
I see a young knight on a white horse...

267
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:20,098
And the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen!

268
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:12,017
Michael!

269
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,753
Hey!

270
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,324
Where you going?

271
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,463
In here!

272
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:01,733
Wait here.

273
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,012
Come on.

274
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,838
Aaaah!

275
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,506
Aah!
Aah! Aah!

276
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:20,045
Aah! Aah!

277
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,865
For the homeless in Paris,
heaven is below,

278
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,635
and hell is above.

279
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,408
No one may enter here
unless they are like us.

280
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:08,646
You have discovered
the secret city of orphans...

281
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,617
...so you must die.

282
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:17,222
I came only to reclaim my spur.

283
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,190
Not the spur of an orphan.

284
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:21,392
Your secret is safe with us.

285
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,361
So you say.

286
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:28,233
But you'll return to the hell
above, and then as we sleep,

287
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:32,137
you'll slip into our chambers
and awaken us in chains.

288
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:35,106
These children have
no heart for slavery.

289
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:37,408
I swear to you...

290
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:40,311
I'm looking for Richard,
the english king.

291
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:43,781
Then you have no business in Paris.

292
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:46,584
He's come and gone.

293
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,555
My children depend on me.
They have no one else.

294
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:53,858
And I have no time
to search your souls.

295
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,461
Bertram, take them away.

296
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:04,102
Forgive me, sir, for being so bold,

297
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,304
but you seem like
the sort of gentleman

298
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,573
who enjoys a good wager.

299
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,049
What is the wager?

300
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,650
Our lives.

301
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:29,560
Why not?

302
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:58,656
Sir, you have the eyes of a hawk.

303
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,458
Make it two for three.

304
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:03,761
After all, it is our lives.

305
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,434
Very well.

306
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,518
I think, young sir,

307
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,688
you have the fastest hands in France.

308
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:35,092
Only an unfortunate would
develop such skills to survive.

309
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:38,163
Join me for supper.

310
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,546
Let me have some of that.

311
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,182
Thank you.

312
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,795
Orphans can't cry, remember?

313
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:14,465
Because once they start,
they would never stop.

314
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:26,110
You'll find such paradise
to the south...

315
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:28,579
The sun radiates such warmth,

316
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,517
and the earth gives birth
to such beauty.

317
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:36,086
The climate would do them well.

318
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,323
Take them with you.

319
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,359
But this is their home.

320
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:48,366
This... dark, damp paradise
exacts a heavy price.

321
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:52,169
Sooner or later,
the cough sets in.

322
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:55,673
No one grows old
in the city of orphans.

323
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:00,177
It's already too late
for me, but...

324
00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:03,314
...There is still time for them.

325
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,916
There are slavers on that road!

326
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:11,522
Our secret was safe until today.

327
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,326
You have led the eyes
of the black prince here.

328
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,528
Soon, he will follow.

329
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,065
You know him?

330
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,434
I knew him once.

331
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,871
We rode in a crusade...

332
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,241
Wanting nothing from life
but to serve god,

333
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:32,843
to recapture his holy land.

334
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:37,848
He was pure...

335
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,950
Too pure.

336
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:42,753
There were no victories.

337
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,190
There was no glory...

338
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:51,662
Only the scorching sands,
the blistering sun,

339
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:55,132
and the massacres.

340
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,802
Then god abandoned us.

341
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,407
He turned his back on god,

342
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:05,676
and now he challenges him.

343
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,912
But his challenge is never met.

344
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,981
God has no time for him.

345
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,384
He will come here.

346
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,722
Take my children.

347
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:22,593
Defend the just and the righteous.

348
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:39,410
God help me.

349
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,070
Come back here!

350
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,772
Come back!

351
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:15,045
What is it, David?
What do you see?

352
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,714
The young knight...

353
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:20,618
He's leading a lot
of children from the city...

354
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:23,120
And he's waving for us to go with him!

355
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:24,355
Us?

356
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:25,856
Yes, Louis.

357
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:29,827
We are going with him.
He's leading us to paradise.

358
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,563
Yes... yes!

359
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:55,620
Strike, lead us to king Richard.

360
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,408
Yah!

361
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,477
Before I leave,

362
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:55,412
is my master to expect a prize, finally?

363
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,014
He will have his children.

364
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:01,151
Not, it seems, if they
should join with the Lionheart.

365
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:04,354
Richard the Lionheart
is a shadow of a man,

366
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,958
driven only by vanity.

367
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:15,065
This young knight
with his glorious ideals...

368
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:18,435
He will lead these children,
but they will find nothing...

369
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:20,638
No salvation.

370
00:57:20,705 --> 00:57:23,140
They will find only me.

371
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,713
I will show this boy

372
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:33,551
that there is only one lord of the lost.

373
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:36,453
I shall make him auction off
his own orphans

374
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:39,023
to the highest bidder,

375
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:41,492
and then I shall sell him

376
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,695
to the vilest eunuch in Arabia.

377
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,500
I see you have found
your true calling

378
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:25,603
in this wicked world...

379
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,505
Gathering children to worship you.

380
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:31,942
But I shall take care of them now...

381
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,178
Brother.

382
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,381
They're gone from here...

383
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,483
Away from you,

384
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,419
away from your touch of death.

385
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:46,156
They are worthless to me dead,

386
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:49,326
but I shall watch them

387
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,629
and let them have hope.

388
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:59,469
By the time they reach the coast,

389
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,507
they will have turned into an army...

390
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,342
An army of slaves

391
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:09,313
that I can pluck like a ripe fruit.

392
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:21,792
Do you see yourself in your young knight?

393
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:30,701
God will leave him as he left us.

394
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:33,403
You are a tortured soul.

395
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,040
I feel no torture.

396
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:38,776
I feel nothing.

397
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:41,445
Where is your god now?

398
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,581
He is with me.

399
00:59:44,649 --> 00:59:46,884
He gives me peace.

400
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,320
Ohh!!

401
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:57,862
This... is peace.

402
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:02,566
Peace you will never find.

403
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,301
I forgive you.

404
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,871
No. No.

405
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,673
No. No!!

406
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,510
Alright.

407
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,879
That's enough!

408
01:00:48,946 --> 01:00:51,315
Let's have a little order here.

409
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,382
Come on.

410
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:09,033
Michael, kneel before me.

411
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,540
You are now lord...

412
01:01:16,606 --> 01:01:20,244
Lord of the circus...

413
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:28,085
...and you will bow to no one but me.

414
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,063
Let that blow remind you of your vows.

415
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:46,470
Hugo, strike...
Official scouts.

416
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,739
Baptista, foraging...

417
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:52,843
And thieving, if required.

418
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,214
Never again will we see each other

419
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:00,450
as noble or peasant, as rich or poor,

420
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:03,420
but only as what we are.

421
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:06,323
Remind us of that, Louis.

422
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:12,863
Blanche will attend to our destiny

423
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:16,200
and keep our hearts strong.

424
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:23,808
Well, then, there we have it.

425
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:29,446
And we mustn't forget
the most important job...

426
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:32,983
That of my personal page.

427
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:37,287
This man's devotion
would be second to none.

428
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:40,524
I'm at your bidding.

429
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,465
None of this bowing.
Understand?

430
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:56,306
Off the road! Move!

431
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:59,309
Move! Move!

432
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,007
Leave it! Leave it!

433
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,827
We are on a crusade of our own...

434
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:27,264
Not to seek glory or wealth,

435
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:31,201
but, instead, to protect the meek,

436
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:35,139
the lost, and the innocent.

437
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:40,210
Children, who are we?

438
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:42,612
I'll tell you who we are.

439
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:45,582
We are the children of god.

440
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:47,284
Who are we?

441
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:49,586
We are the children of god.

442
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:52,089
Who are we?

443
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:54,959
We are the children of god.

444
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:07,831
Hey, you!

445
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,034
Come back here!

446
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,004
Terribly sorry.

447
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:16,673
Let go.
Let go!

448
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:24,414
Here, Louis.

449
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:43,433
How is this?

450
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:53,410
How much do you want for this?

451
01:06:53,477 --> 01:06:55,679
Ah.

452
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:59,449
I shall accept nothing less
than 10 gold pieces.

453
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,586
Forgive me, sir, for being so bold,

454
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,888
but you seem like the sort of gentleman

455
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:07,724
who enjoys a good wager once in a while.

456
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,769
Remember, if you are downed, you stay down.

457
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:22,172
That is your penalty.

458
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,571
Aah!

459
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:56,240
Ugh!

460
01:07:58,508 --> 01:07:59,743
Aah!

461
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,686
Ya-a-a-h!

462
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:12,122
Aaah!

463
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,067
I yield!
I yield!

464
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:09,979
Rarely have I seen such valor.

465
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:12,449
Please, sir, identify yourself.

466
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:20,190
Mathilda!

467
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,226
Mathilda, this time
you've gone too far!

468
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:23,427
But, father...

469
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,829
You're a disgrace to the family!

470
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,199
These knights are a disgrace to our family.

471
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:30,634
At least I bring you honor.

472
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,469
I don't want you to bring honor.

473
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:34,504
I want you to bring me a son-in-law...

474
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,540
Not easy now that you've
managed to incapacitate

475
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:37,974
every suitor in the province.

476
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:41,245
How can I love a man
that can't stand up to me?

477
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:44,848
You'll learn, dear.
I find it quite agreeable.

478
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,917
You give me no choice.

479
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:50,954
I'm going to send you
to the nuns of St. Mary.

480
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,256
They'll teach you humility.

481
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:54,458
Never. I won't go.

482
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,893
Your father has spoken!

483
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,863
I have no father.

484
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,539
We could use a girl like that.

485
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:12,642
She doesn't seem
very approachable.

486
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,912
That's because you
don't speak her language.

487
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,608
Good day to you, milady.

488
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:51,114
We are traveling south to join
king Richard the Lionheart.

489
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,582
But the roads are dangerous,

490
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,984
and we could certainly use another sword.

491
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:56,252
Please, join us.

492
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,188
I travel alone.

493
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,291
I beg you to reconsider.

494
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:03,893
You see, we are a very touchy group

495
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,563
and easily insulted.

496
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,832
You are obviously some vagabond knight

497
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:10,867
in need of a lesson.

498
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:31,721
Yah!

499
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:32,822
Yah!

500
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:42,466
Yah!

501
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,339
Ooh!

502
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:08,425
Ohh!

503
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:21,805
Ugh!

504
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,255
Oh! Uh!

505
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:43,527
Ugh! Ohh!

506
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,342
Do you want to call it a draw?

507
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:01,344
Only if you'll travel with us.

508
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:03,413
It's a draw!
It's a draw!

509
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,781
Yes.

510
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:08,485
I would love to travel with you.

511
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:22,025
Don't let him break your heart.

512
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,093
He's a knight.

513
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,597
You're only a circus girl.

514
01:14:27,664 --> 01:14:31,400
Something terrible is going to happen...

515
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,638
Something unspeakable.

516
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,987
It's alright.

517
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:53,122
It's alright.

518
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,222
Go away.

519
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:27,591
You're sick.

520
01:15:27,657 --> 01:15:30,293
We're not.
Please.

521
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,562
Your village is diseased.

522
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:35,164
Stay away.

523
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,615
The plague... ahead.

524
01:15:53,783 --> 01:15:54,984
Quiet.

525
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,219
Quiet down!

526
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,622
I'll go find another road.

527
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:51,775
Hold on, Louis.

528
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:25,975
Come on, Louis.
Come on.

529
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:28,778
At last.

530
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,016
Eat up. Come on.

531
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:44,520
An english king's
no more than a hope.

532
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:48,124
What if we don't find him?

533
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:54,463
All these weeks of traveling...
It's been so hard on them.

534
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,600
We'll survive.
We all do.

535
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,936
We can't go on forever.

536
01:19:00,003 --> 01:19:03,606
How long can we keep this dream alive?

537
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:05,541
Dreams never die, Robert.

538
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:08,311
The black prince is no dream.

539
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:12,181
Sir... I've seen him...

540
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,984
A man in black.

541
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,921
There was no plague in our village.

542
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:20,023
He killed our families.

543
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,191
We hid.

544
01:19:22,258 --> 01:19:24,760
He didn't want anyone
to use our road.

545
01:19:24,828 --> 01:19:26,930
He wanted them to use the other...

546
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:28,865
The one you took.

547
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,036
I have no sores.

548
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,503
You see?

549
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:39,242
Are you the young knight?

550
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:05,401
There are slavers behind us.

551
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:09,072
Take the little ones. Get them
moving. Half of you go with her.

552
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:11,374
The rest of us...
I have a plan.

553
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,093
Ugh!

554
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,229
Push!

555
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:08,331
Push!

556
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:12,401
Yah! Yah!

557
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:20,910
Yah!

558
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,583
Ohh!

559
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:40,263
Ohh!

560
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:43,232
Aah!

561
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:57,446
Hurry.

562
01:22:14,397 --> 01:22:15,398
Oh!

563
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:17,166
Ooh!

564
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,360
Damn!

565
01:22:44,427 --> 01:22:48,497
Aaaaaah!

566
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:12,921
Go!

567
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,223
Go!

568
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:18,761
Come on!

569
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,729
Hurry!

570
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:26,535
Go!

571
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:46,289
Ugh!

572
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:27,363
Robert!

573
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:32,468
Robert!

574
01:24:32,535 --> 01:24:34,103
Here.

575
01:24:51,053 --> 01:24:53,456
Are we there, David?

576
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:54,790
Yes.

577
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,094
It's beautiful...

578
01:24:59,162 --> 01:25:03,232
Green hills stretching for miles...

579
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:06,735
Flowers and trees...

580
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:12,741
...a rainbow stretching
like an archway to heaven.

581
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:15,644
Can you see it, Louis?

582
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:20,048
Can you see it?

583
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,884
Yes.

584
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,653
Yes. I see.

585
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:27,456
And the cool breeze...

586
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:30,226
I feel it.

587
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,828
It's wonderful.

588
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,840
You found paradise, Louis.

589
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:49,945
You found paradise.

590
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:54,617
You'll live there forever...

591
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:56,819
...forever.

592
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:19,775
Position yourselves
along that ridge.

593
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,310
Watch the woods.

594
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:22,578
♪ La-la la-la la-la la ♪

595
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:24,213
♪ La-la la-la la-la la ♪

596
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,549
Odo, go with Bertram.

597
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:30,819
You'll be his messenger.
Understand?

598
01:26:30,886 --> 01:26:33,021
No sign of king Richard.

599
01:26:33,088 --> 01:26:35,824
I'll ride south in the morning.

600
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:35,050
I'm scared now.

601
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:37,252
I'm losing you.

602
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,388
You're not.

603
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:42,691
Your future isn't with me.

604
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,927
What?

605
01:27:46,862 --> 01:27:51,567
Robert, very soon your exile will be over.

606
01:27:51,634 --> 01:27:54,470
There'll be another crusade.

607
01:27:54,537 --> 01:27:58,807
Blanche, a long time ago,
you told us not to be afraid...

608
01:27:58,874 --> 01:28:02,144
That you had seen into the future

609
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:05,414
and knew what it held for us.

610
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:08,183
I can't see into the future,

611
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:12,521
but I know there is none without you.

612
01:29:23,826 --> 01:29:25,761
King Richard.

613
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:40,609
I have found king Richard!

614
01:29:42,978 --> 01:29:45,047
I've found king Richard!

615
01:30:41,504 --> 01:30:44,072
Come on. Come on!

616
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,311
Robert...

617
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,785
The black prince.

618
01:32:57,205 --> 01:32:58,607
Michael...

619
01:33:57,032 --> 01:33:59,802
There is no honor in death.

620
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:32,167
Ha!

621
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,321
Aah!

622
01:35:06,468 --> 01:35:07,602
Aah!

623
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:09,437
Ugh!

624
01:35:41,303 --> 01:35:43,138
Aah!

625
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:04,893
Aaaah!

626
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:11,967
Aah!

627
01:36:36,558 --> 01:36:39,127
Aah!

628
01:36:39,194 --> 01:36:40,328
Aah!

629
01:36:46,668 --> 01:36:48,136
Aah!

630
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:54,309
Ugh!

631
01:37:49,797 --> 01:37:52,834
It's strike!
It's strike!

632
01:38:24,499 --> 01:38:26,401
Not bad...

633
01:38:26,468 --> 01:38:28,136
For a vagabond.

634
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,585
God, I love that girl.

635
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,582
Aaaah!

636
01:39:25,493 --> 01:39:27,695
Aaaaah!

637
01:39:27,762 --> 01:39:29,497
Ohh!

638
01:39:57,959 --> 01:40:01,729
Your grace...

639
01:40:03,565 --> 01:40:06,534
I am Richard, king of England.

640
01:40:12,607 --> 01:40:16,278
I am Robert Nerra, lord of Bain.

641
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:21,249
And you shall bow to no one but me

642
01:40:21,316 --> 01:40:24,152
and god almighty himself.

643
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:28,890
Forgive me.

644
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:30,725
Forgive me.

645
01:40:35,663 --> 01:40:38,400
I could use a knight
like you, Robert Nerra.

646
01:40:43,071 --> 01:40:45,473
Thank you, sir.

647
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:49,177
But my crusade is here with these children.

648
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:51,646
They have seen enough bloodshed.

649
01:40:51,713 --> 01:40:54,082
My heart is with them.

650
01:41:31,586 --> 01:41:33,888
Well, then...

651
01:41:33,955 --> 01:41:36,224
There we have it.

652
01:41:36,291 --> 01:41:38,025
Strike...

653
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,595
Lead us all to our destinies.
