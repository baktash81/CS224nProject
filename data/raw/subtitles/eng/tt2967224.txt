1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,567
All right, baby girl, you ready
for your first day at work with Daddy?

2
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,971
- Daddy, go fast!
- Huh. Okay!

3
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,163
- Happy Halloween!
- Happy Halloween to you, too, Officer Cooper.

4
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,967
Yes!

5
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,842
Where'd that scumbag come from?

6
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,804
We're gonna have to move quick.

7
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,361
- 10-24: bomb threat.
- 10-24: bomb threat.

8
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,126
- 10-71: shooting.
- 10-71: shooting.

9
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,328
He doesn't smell like Santa.

10
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,603
You're so pretty.

11
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,167
Oh, thanks, baby, you are too.

12
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,641
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Have fun.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,290
Uh, I'll have her back by 10:00.

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,288
8:30? 8:00.

15
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,126
I'll have her back by 8:00.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,250
All units respond to a 10-15.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,363
Copy that. Noise disturbance.

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,400
Freeze! Police!

19
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,807
Oh, my God!

20
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,487
Police officer coming through!
Get out of the way! Move your vehicle!

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,966
Get back in your car, sir!
Get back in your vehicle.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,490
Oh.

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,566
- What do you think you're doing?
- Aah! I can explain.

24
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,481
- I know it's not cool to leave in the middle...
- Date. It was a first date.

25
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,889
And, honestly, I expected more
out of a guy I met on Christian Mingle.

26
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,488
It's just that... Don't take this
the wrong way. You're kind of intense.

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,330
Intense? Intense how?

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,882
When I said I had to leave early,
you pulled your gun out on the table.

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,208
No, no. I was doing a thing like:

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,449
"Don't you walk away
until I get a second date."

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,847
- It was supposed to be funny.
- It really wasn't.

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,646
I was just chasing you
because you forgot your wallet.

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,887
Okay. Thanks.

34
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,890
- I'm gonna walk back to my car now.
- All right.

35
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,127
- Bye!
- Bye.

36
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,521
Hey. You forgot to pay your bill.

37
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,767
Dang it!

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,362
I really thought this one
was gonna work out.

39
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,643
News out of Texas: A huge break...

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,320
in the case against notorious
cartel leader Vicente Cortez.

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,284
Sources say a cartel insider...

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,609
is prepared to testify
against the violent crime lord.

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,882
I will be out in a few hours.

44
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,248
I will never miss
my daughter's birthday.

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,731
Cortez is suspected of more than 100 murders
while dominating the U.S. drug trade.

46
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,931
Law enforcement officials
have called him "untouchable" until now.

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,043
Since when is it illegal
to dance naked...

48
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,730
- on my own street?
- Shut up!

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,331
- Hey, Coop.
- Oh, no. Hold on.

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
- I don't have time for this.
- Wait a second. Slow down.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,730
My legs are shorter than yours.

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,722
Detective Hauser, come back.
You know protocol.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,845
All evidence has to be submitted
in a proper-size Nolan envelope.

54
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,003
This is dangerous
and could hurt someone.

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,208
You encounter a lot
of danger here, Coop?

56
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,609
As a matter of fact, I do.
The other day they brought in a duffle bag.

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,646
I opened it, there was a live raccoon
in there. It could've had rabies.

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,080
Or it could've had worse.

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,328
Raccoon herpes.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,567
That's real contagious.

61
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,807
How does it feel?

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,169
I imagine a burning sensation
in the little guy's genital region.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,803
Officer Cooper,
report to Captain Emmett's office.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,607
Sorry, boys. I'd like to keep talking
with y'all, but the captain needs me.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,769
Watch your head, detective.

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,926
I was gonna say, "How does it feel
being a glorified secretary?"

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,889
Cooper, this is Deputy U.S.
Marshal Jackson, in from Dallas.

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,727
All due respect, Captain Emmett,
I know exactly who Deputy Marshal Jackson is.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,888
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.
- Thank you.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,929
What I'm about to say
cannot leave this room.

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you know who Felipe Riva is?

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,120
Yes. He is the top lieutenant
in the Cortez cartel.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,326
Since 1989, he's responsible for all
their "finances," a.k.a., money laundering.

75
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,364
He is known as The Bank of Bogotá,
The Tender Tender...

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,723
The Lender Lender, The Money Launderer,
El Chapo, The Pork Chop, La Chalupa...

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,245
Okay. Okay, okay.

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,046
Riva and his wife
are gonna testify against Cortez.

79
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,888
But Cortez has killed
every potential witness we've had.

80
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,242
Which is why only the three of us
can know this.

81
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,249
He has people on his payroll everywhere.

82
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,081
Now, tomorrow morning, Deputy Jackson
is gonna escort Riva to Dallas...

83
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,523
so he can testify
the following morning at 8:00 a.m.

84
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,006
And you...

85
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,771
- are gonna go with him.
- Me?

86
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,165
You want me to go to Dallas?

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,647
The law requires a female escort
for Mrs. Riva.

88
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,161
Oh, yes, of course. Section 290.

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,407
The Richards Rule.

90
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,961
I know you've been wanting
to get off the bench.

91
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,606
- Yes, sir.
- And ever since the shotgun incident...

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,882
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Hold up.

93
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,725
You're the Cooper?

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,291
As in, "He just pulled a Cooper"?
As in, "Don't Cooper that shit"?

95
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,810
I was following protocol, sir.

96
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,929
I found the source
of the noise complaint.

97
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,083
- Who's got the keys?
- Hey, I got shotgun!

98
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,762
Drop your weapon!

99
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,567
Oh, my gosh!

100
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,489
- Why would you do that?
- Why?

101
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,728
He just wanted to sit in the front seat!

102
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,930
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

103
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,884
Oh, God.

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,965
I'm so sor...

105
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,243
I'm sor... Actually, I thought
you were an urban myth.

106
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,490
You'd never heard someone
calling "shotgun" to sit in the front?

107
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,809
That's a negative, sir.
I've never heard that term used that way.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,004
Look, all you have to do
is take care of Riva's wife.

109
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,287
- Yes.
- Okay?

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,166
Keep her calm, take her to the little
girls' room if she has any lady business.

111
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,648
Yes. Captain, do we have any idea
if Miss Riva is menopausal?

112
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,450
Yes, because I've been tracking her cycle
and cross-referencing it to the lunar calendar.

113
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,204
- Really? Can I get the chart?
- No!

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,050
Get out of here. Go. Just go. Go.

115
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,287
Thank you, deputy.

116
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,489
- Captain Emmett?
- Yes, Cooper.

117
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,806
Not that I'm not grateful
for the opportunity, sir...

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,369
but this seems like a very important detail
for my first day back in the field.

119
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,207
Cooper.

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,609
You're cut from the same cloth
as the best cop there ever was.

121
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,167
Thank you, sir.

122
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,323
It's time to make your father proud.

123
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,811
Just try not to get
all in your head about it, okay?

124
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,362
- Captain Emmett, I will not let you down.
- I know you won't, Cooper.

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,087
Deputy Jackson, Captain Emmett said
that this transport was at 11 a.m.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,284
At the rate we're going,
we'll get there more than an hour early.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,404
Riva's a flight risk. Showing up early
might keep him from running.

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,331
Okay, but we're going
over 30 miles over the speed limit...

129
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,047
- which is illegal. And also...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cooper, Cooper, Cooper.

130
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,366
You are chatty.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,644
Look, the thing is,
today is your lucky day.

132
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,887
Why is that?

133
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,801
You get a chance to get out of the doghouse,
and you with me, sweetie. Mm?

134
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,881
All right, so just put your head down...

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,525
turn off the walkie...

136
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,087
and keep your Taser in your pants.
Okay, chief?

137
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,970
- Copy that.
- Okay.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,770
Try not to fall in love with me.

139
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,485
Okay. Copy that.

140
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,250
Oh, wait, that was a joke.

141
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,090
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Okay.

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,567
You are cute. You are cute.

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,525
Mrs. Riva.

144
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,202
This is Deputy U.S. Marshal Jackson.
I'm here for you and your husband.

145
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,725
You're early.

146
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,208
- Who's this?
- Mr. Riva, I'm Officer Cooper...

147
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,562
Don't worry about her.
Nobody knows we're here.

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,650
She has to be here for your wife.
She ready to go?

149
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,885
I'm not so sure
about this Witness Protection anymore.

150
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,246
And why is that?

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,241
Ay, perdona. My wife is a come mierda.

152
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,680
How you say in English?

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,967
Shit mouth?

154
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,006
The U.S. Government
has you trafficking on tape.

155
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,645
So you only got two choices:

156
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,441
Either come to Dallas, testify against
Cortez before the grand jury...

157
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,682
or go to jail for the rest of your life.

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,565
- Let me ask about Witness Protection.
- Okay.

159
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,491
If I go to Ohio, can my wife go to...

160
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,762
What is the furthest place from Ohio?

161
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,086
San Diego.

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,884
- Definitely San Diego.
- San Diego.

163
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,445
Cooper, go get his wife.

164
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,405
10-80 the witness. Copy that.

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,371
Mrs. Riva?

166
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,648
I am announcing my entrance
into your private domicile.

167
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,003
I'm Officer Cooper. I'm here
to escort you to Dallas. Aah!

168
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,480
You must of not seen me.

169
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,768
Oh, I saw you.

170
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,491
- Mrs. Riva, I am a police officer.
- Ay, please.

171
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,321
Look at you. You're teeny-tiny. You're
like a little dog I can put in my purse.

172
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,561
I can assure you...

173
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,525
I meet the minimum height requirement
of an adult female my weight.

174
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,721
Move!

175
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,531
We have got to get going.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,804
Protocol states that you only need
to pack the essentials, ma'am.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,843
You are not gonna need all these shoes.

178
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,929
These are clumsy and impractical.

179
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,482
What shoes are you wearing, huh?

180
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,685
I'm wearing black shoes.

181
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,765
Standard-issue black shoes.

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,002
No. Those are men's shoes.

183
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,009
My husband has the same kind.

184
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,842
Congratulation, Officer Lesbian,
you wear the shoes of a coward that I hate.

185
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,407
I realize this might be difficult
for someone like you.

186
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,971
What the hell does that mean?

187
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,524
Just someone who likes a lot of stuff.

188
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,768
Oh, so I only care about stuff.

189
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,644
No, Mrs. Riva, I did not mean that.

190
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,171
What I was trying to s...

191
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,450
For example, that's probably something
you could leave at home.

192
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,369
What? This?

193
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,924
I was Miss Plantain, 2004.

194
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,484
My cousin Rosa lost two fingers
trying to snatch this from my head.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,129
I am not going anywhere without this.

196
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,050
You do know the point of Witness Protection
is that you'll have a different identity.

197
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,480
What's taking so long?

198
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,170
Don't make me come up there!

199
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,407
Ay, no.

200
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,988
What are you going to do,
testify me to death?

201
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,208
Would you like me
to neutralize this situation?

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,885
Stay here.

203
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,447
You know what to do.

204
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,325
10-30. Damn it!

205
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,326
Hey, get down!

206
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,089
Oh, God, this is happening.

207
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,725
Don't Cooper this, Cooper.

208
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,646
Where are you going?

209
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,567
I'm trying to save you.

210
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,325
I try to save me too!

211
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,848
- Who the hell are you?
- Who the hell are you?

212
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,280
Is this a joke?

213
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,045
Does this look like a joke?

214
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,810
- Who sent you?
- Who sent you?

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,764
Oh, my God!

216
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,800
Cooper!

217
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,964
Get to the car, radio for backup.

218
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,322
- I got your back. Go!
- Okay.

219
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,127
Hurry, let's go!

220
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,368
- Where is she?
- We'll take care of her later.

221
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,803
They're getting away! Come on, let's go!

222
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,887
Watch out! Take the shot!

223
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,281
Get down!

224
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,284
- Your left!
- They're getting away!

225
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,521
Oh, no.

226
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,085
Mrs. Riva.

227
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,290
Let's spread out! Search the house!

228
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,407
Mrs. Riva!

229
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,761
Mrs. Riva.

230
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,851
Oh, my God. Mrs. Riva. Are you wounded?

231
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,890
No, you stupid idiot. I'm hiding.

232
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,289
- Get out of here, gringa!
- I'm gonna commandeer your personal vehicle.

233
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,002
- What?
- You're in danger, ma'am.

234
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,603
In accordance with Texas State Penal Code,
section 38, I'm commandeering your vehicle.

235
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,041
- Buckle up. This is gonna get fast.
- What?

236
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,725
- Hold on!
- No, no!

237
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,446
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'm gonna get you to safety.

238
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,806
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

239
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,085
You need to calm down, ma'am.

240
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,725
Shut up! Go!

241
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,371
Damn it!

242
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,891
What's going on?

243
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,367
Calm down, ma'am.
Everything's gonna be fine.

244
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,886
What about my husband?

245
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,161
Everything but your husband's
gonna be fine.

246
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,408
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but...

247
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,647
he's dead.

248
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,882
- Why?
- Okay.

249
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,771
Try to stay calm.

250
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,928
Why?

251
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,289
Why?

252
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,562
- Why?
- Ma'am!

253
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,967
You're gonna have to put your body
back in the vehicle!

254
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,891
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,647
Oh, my God.

256
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,848
Where are you in my time of need?

257
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,125
It's normal to seek comfort in your time,
and to look to God or to Jesus...

258
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,926
but you're gonna need
to take your hands off my body!

259
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,645
I am a widow!

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,286
Listen to me!

261
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,760
Listen!

262
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,602
I have lost my radio,
so you're gonna have to call 911.

263
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,929
And you're gonna have to report
a 10-12 and two 10-60s.

264
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,525
You're requesting a detective.

265
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,121
It's not letting me in.
I think it needs a password.

266
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,924
- Don't do that!
- Right. Right.

267
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,568
Dial 1139.

268
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,364
Then 911.

269
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,686
Then two 10-2...

270
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,160
No! Scratch that!

271
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,125
One 10-12 and two 10-60s.

272
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,601
Get a move on. Come on.

273
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,888
Something bad happened to the phone.

274
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,889
What? What?

275
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,166
Oh, no.

276
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,086
Okay.

277
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,444
I gotta find us a phone.

278
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,567
Okay.

279
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,127
Mrs. Riva!

280
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,687
You have to remain in your vehicle
and stay calm.

281
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,407
Me? What kind of pendejo cop are you?

282
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,648
You have to take me home!

283
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,246
You're writing me a ticket?

284
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,966
Oh, I am protected by a meter maid.

285
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,162
No, I am recording
all pertinent details...

286
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,647
in my incident report log
before they slip my mind.

287
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,649
Jue madre, this is your first day?

288
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,126
Take me home!

289
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,649
Do not touch my I.R.L.

290
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,525
Now, protocol states
I have to contact my precinct.

291
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,529
Do you have a telephone on you?

292
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,041
Yes!

293
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,566
I packed it...

294
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,569
with my computer...

295
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,171
with my floppy disk...

296
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,249
while running for my life.

297
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,005
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting the hell out of here...

298
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,522
before Cortez finds me
and sews my face into a soccer ball.

299
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,285
You are in a state of shock
and you're not thinking clearly.

300
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,369
My husband just got murdered...

301
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,562
and now they're coming to get me.

302
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,362
You have to stay here
until backup arrives!

303
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,722
I am a sitting goose out here!

304
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,769
Mrs. Riva! Come back!

305
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,086
I am warning you!

306
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,606
I did not wanna have to do this.

307
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,087
But you're forcing me
to take extreme measures.

308
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,810
It is my mission to protect you.

309
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,921
It is my mission to get you to Dallas
by 8:00 a.m.

310
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,049
And I am gonna complete my mission.

311
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,090
You're small but freaking intense!

312
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,968
I have got to contact my precinct.

313
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,201
Please.

314
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,567
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,370
There were two sets of gunmen.

316
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,006
Each seemed surprised to see each other.
One set Latino, possible cartel.

317
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,248
The other set Caucasian...

318
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,641
in masks.

319
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,571
You have an officer down
and four unidentified suspects.

320
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,410
- Got it.
- No. Hold that.

321
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,570
There was one identifying mark
on one of the Caucasian men.

322
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,967
He had it on his left wrist.

323
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,123
And I drew a picture of it in my I.R.L.

324
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,163
Notebook. That's a notebook.

325
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,761
And that's my car
not a personal vehicle.

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,968
"Remain in your personal vehicle."

327
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,646
- I am on the phone with dispatch.
- It's a car. Say, "Car."

328
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,486
- Pipe down.
- It drives me crazy, the way you talk.

329
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,251
It seems to be a Buddha,
sitting on a wave.

330
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,410
Or a bottle of barbecue sauce
guarded by two snakes.

331
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,444
Or a snowman, melting in the rain.

332
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,444
Possibly a peanut in a puddle.

333
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,727
It's a cow.

334
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,206
I am talking on the phone.

335
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,640
It's a longhorn.

336
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,842
They considered making it
a state animal...

337
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,441
but they went for the armadillo instead.

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,526
What? The brown lady cannot read a book?

339
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,807
Scratch that.

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,650
It seems to be a longhorn.

341
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,080
The tattoo was a longhorn.

342
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,090
Okay, we'll dispatch officers
to bring you in immediately.

343
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,645
Yes, ma'am. We'll sit tight.

344
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,527
Nice. Nice police work,
Mr. Cherlocks Holmes.

345
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,609
Nice. Heh.

346
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
Oh, thank God. Here come the cavalry.

347
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,446
Damn, Coop.

348
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,969
You done got thrown in the fire today.

349
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,891
Detective Hauser.
I'm so glad y'all are here.

350
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,286
It was a mess in there.

351
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,091
But I have recorded all the details,
and tried to follow protocol.

352
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,089
He, hey. Coop, we got this.

353
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,687
You're just lucky to be alive.
The good news is...

354
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,963
local police got shell casings and DNA
back at the compound.

355
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,810
You saved this old lady's life.

356
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,804
"Old lady"? Su madre.

357
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,731
I'm gonna go and assume that means,
"Thanks for saving my life."

358
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,405
And you are welcome, Mrs. Riva.

359
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,047
Why don't y'all hop in the back?
We'll all ride together.

360
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,287
Yes, sir.

361
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,529
Pretty good for a secretary.

362
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,646
Don't worry, Miss Riva.

363
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,401
We'll have you in Dallas in three hours.

364
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,961
It's Hauser.

365
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,530
I called dispatch 20 minutes ago.
If they were leaving from the precinct...

366
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,724
they must've been driving 180 miles
per hour to get here that fast.

367
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,845
Who are you talking to?

368
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,202
They got three quarters a tank of gas.

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,325
At a max of 90 miles per hour...

370
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,524
that means they were 30 miles away,
which means they probably came...

371
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,605
Hauser!

372
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,366
Okay, I gotta go.

373
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,045
Yeah.

374
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,365
Fist bump. For all that good
police work, good buddy.

375
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,362
We have to get out now.
They're gonna kill us both.

376
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,686
- Dixon, let's go.
- What?

377
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,564
They're the gunmen.
The guys in the masks.

378
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,728
- Who?
- Just trust me. Follow my lead.

379
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,244
No, ma'am, I do not have
any feminine toiletries on me.

380
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,771
Feminine what?

381
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,527
What's the problem?

382
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,685
Uh, Mrs. Riva is having some problems
with some lady business.

383
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,800
Of the tampon variety.

384
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,766
- Seriously?
- Yeah. My comadre is here.

385
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,121
Her comadre is here.

386
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,851
Can't you just hold it?

387
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,251
No, it does not work that way, detective.
It does not.

388
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,087
No, you see, once a month,
my uterus sheds its lining.

389
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,560
It sheds. Once a month.

390
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,683
- So that the eggs...
- And the eggs.

391
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,245
...descend into the puss.

392
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,442
- Oh, my God.
- The puss put...

393
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,766
- No, there are fluids...
- God.

394
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,486
- Other fluids go in there.
- Whoa. What is she talking about?

395
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,490
So please take me
to a bathroom right now...

396
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,650
or the back of this car
is gonna be the second crime scene...

397
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,928
that you guys
are gonna be cleaning today.

398
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,964
- You don't need to paint a picture.
- You're used to that, no? Heh.

399
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,605
Please, please. Stop.

400
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,131
- Okay, Coop, I'll let you out.
- All right. Let's go.

401
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,769
There's a lining in there?

402
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,204
- We'll be right back.
- Yeah.

403
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,049
Hey, mamacita, where you going?

404
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,487
- Mamacita?
- We have our periods!

405
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,761
You don't wanna know.

406
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,330
There's a window. I'll go first.

407
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,686
You go, go, go.

408
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,203
- Oh. Okay, I can't do it.
- Push there with the legs!

409
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,528
- With the legs! With the legs!
- I can't!

410
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,324
Why is your body like that?

411
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,241
- I gotta get a toehold.
- Where's the toehold? I can't find the toehold.

412
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,764
I just need some upper-body strength.

413
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,610
- Push!
- Okay, hold on.

414
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,565
I'm gonna pull my body up,
and push it out the window.

415
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,841
Go, go, go!

416
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,684
Go, go, go! I'm gonna help you.

417
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,921
Go, go, go.

418
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,891
- Put me down.
- No, no!

419
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,287
- What?
- Dixon's out there.

420
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,245
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- I'm not gonna shoot an officer!

421
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,805
They'll be happy to shoot us.

422
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,486
- That gives me an idea.
- What?

423
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,051
- This is gonna be loud.
- What?

424
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,449
Go, go, go! You help us.

425
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,130
Help her! Get her up!

426
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,885
- What was that?
- Dixon, let's go!

427
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,127
Lift me up on two!

428
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,089
- What? On one?
- One! Two! Go!

429
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,322
- No, wait, I mean go on one then two...
- Now?

430
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,965
Shut up! Go up!

431
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,247
I'm going up.

432
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,569
- Okay, do me, do me.
- All right.

433
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,761
Do me!

434
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,124
Get up! Help me!

435
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,721
- Do it! Get up and help me.
- Okay.

436
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,967
Out of my way, man.

437
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,128
- Hold up, hold up!
- Get back, Goldilocks!

438
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,401
- Hurry!
- Pull me!

439
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,211
- Come on!
- I'm trying! I have the body of a woman!

440
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,051
Just fall on me like a sack of potatoes!

441
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,605
Hey, out of the way.

442
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,729
Okay. You take the far one.

443
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,160
One, two.

444
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,447
Dixon!

445
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,050
- What are you thinking?
- Legs!

446
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,765
I got it!

447
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,326
- Freeze, Cooper!
- Aah!

448
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,568
You don't... No! No!

449
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,764
What are you doing? Come on!

450
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,240
No! My bag!

451
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,130
- I've been attacked.
- Let's go! Get up!

452
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,367
I've been attacked.

453
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,323
- Wait!
- Come on!

454
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,086
Come on!

455
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,246
Hurry up.

456
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,928
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

457
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,203
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Drive! Stop talking and drive!

458
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,126
Watch it, mister!

459
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,805
I gotta calm down.

460
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,161
How could they?

461
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,687
Why would they?

462
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,486
Oh, my God. I just don't understand.

463
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,410
10-30: officer in trouble.

464
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,250
10-31: shooting in progress.

465
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,521
10-32...

466
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,451
- What are you doing now?
- It's a relaxation technique.

467
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,961
Oh, it's working wonderful.

468
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,609
I just don't understand.
I just feel like it doesn't make any sense.

469
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,002
Like, there has to be
some sort of explanation.

470
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,441
Yeah, the explanation
is that they're bad cops.

471
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,841
What is that?

472
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,482
- Ay, no. No.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

473
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,767
Oh, no.

474
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,046
Dang it!

475
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,483
Ay, yeah, this is the one
that is always overheating.

476
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,524
It looks like we just need some water
and we'll be good to go.

477
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,931
Do you hear that?

478
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,971
No. What?

479
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,367
Mrs. Riva...

480
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,723
are you concealing a communication device
in your chestal area?

481
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,285
My chestal what?

482
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,369
My boobs? No.

483
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,326
And I am so tired
of those racist accusations.

484
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,640
You have had a cell phone
this entire time!

485
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,081
Unacceptable. Now hand it over!

486
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,644
Fine, I'm gonna come and get it.

487
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,201
I didn't give it to you...

488
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,886
because everything that you see
you commandeer.

489
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,206
See?

490
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,727
There's a website.
It tracks police scanners.

491
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,447
I just have to hear what Dixon and Hauser
hear so we can get ahead of them.

492
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,404
4921 North Jefferson Road.

493
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,888
Daniella Riva, a Hispanic female,
approximately 40 years old.

494
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,127
Forty!

495
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,767
She was last seen fleeing the scene
in a red 1968 Cadillac convertible.

496
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,883
They think I'm traveling
with a fugitive.

497
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,402
The officer is considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

498
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,244
"Officer"? Two officers.

499
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,808
Officer Cooper is described
as 5' tall with blond hair.

500
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,047
What, me?

501
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,164
They think I am traveling
with a fugitive.

502
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,483
She killed a U.S. Marshal.
Prepare to shoot on sight.

503
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,568
That is the number one way
we track runners.

504
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,525
- I gotta think. What do I do?
- Good luck cleaning your name.

505
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,881
I am going to be in Mexico...

506
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,964
They think I committed a crime?
I gotta get to Dallas and clear this up.

507
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,050
- ...with a cocktail and a fake passport.
- I don't know what to do.

508
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,211
Mrs. Riva. Listen to me, Miss Riva.

509
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,165
Our smartest move now
is to change clothes, lose this car...

510
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,681
and commandeer a new vehicle
to get to Dallas.

511
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,168
Everybody in the state
is looking for you.

512
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,408
You're gonna be dead before sundown.

513
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,930
You don't have to like me, but I'm
the best chance you have at surviving.

514
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,365
What the heck is that?

515
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,483
Felipe must have put
baking powder in the car.

516
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,327
How much baking powder?

517
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,721
I don't know. Maybe like 42 kilos.

518
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,689
What? I told you it wasn't mine!
I told you not to steal something!

519
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,402
Oh, God! Would you just shut up
for one cotton-picking minute!

520
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,086
Hey, are y'all okay?

521
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,248
I took that turn way too fast.

522
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,442
What the heck is this white stuff?

523
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,045
- Baking powder.
- Baking powder.

524
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,890
We're bakers. Toast, muffin, cakes.

525
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,684
- Muffin.
- Toast.

526
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,241
- Toast, cake, muffins.
- I should call the police.

527
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,847
No! I am the mother-effing police!
Don't you see?

528
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,611
There's no major damage here.
You're free to go.

529
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,645
But I destroyed your car.

530
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,171
I said you're free to go!

531
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,170
Except I need you to drop us off
at the nearest establishment...

532
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,408
where we can buy clothing
at a reasonable price...

533
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,443
but, more importantly,
at a reasonable price.

534
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,251
I said that before, didn't I?
This accident's got me all jacked up.

535
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,321
- If you don't mind riding in an old truck.
- Let's go!

536
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,441
Clean your nose!

537
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,971
Out of the way!

538
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,043
When I was 5, my favorite color was blue.
When I was 6, my favorite color was plaid.

539
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,680
I was 7, I saw squirrels kissing.
I watched it for a long time.

540
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,411
A long time, Wayne. I still feel
weird about it. This is our stop!

541
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,528
Wayne, you're the best friend
I ever had.

542
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,929
Wayne's a snake in the grass.
You think he heard me? I think he did.

543
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,010
Okay, okay, Officer Scarface,
just keep it together.

544
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,248
Police officer coming through.

545
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,568
I'm so thirsty.
It's like my body's a desert.

546
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,603
This could be perfect.
We have to change.

547
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,326
These hangers are slippery.
Like they have some special coating.

548
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,329
My hands are really sweaty,
which is weird.

549
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,171
Is it hot in here?
It feels like the surface of the sun.

550
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,486
You're more fun like this...

551
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,921
- but calm down.
- I was in a fight-or-flight situation.

552
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,521
I'm filled with adrenaline.
Look how high I can jump.

553
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,966
I can't do this normally.

554
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,286
See that?

555
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,643
- Yes!
- No.

556
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,245
We're gonna need this and this.

557
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,284
- Control yourself. We don't need that!
- And these! And those! And these!

558
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,524
Aah! I know this is impractical
but we might have to catch our own food.

559
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,848
Or make a lightning rod! A hat!

560
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,410
- Please. Focus. We need to get clothes!
- Yes!

561
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,083
Okay, how about you try something
completely different...

562
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,651
of what you are.

563
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,887
How about...

564
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,522
- a woman?
- Perfect! And you can be a cowboy.

565
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,687
It's tight in here.

566
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,049
- Cowboy?
- This is a good plan. This is gonna work!

567
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,049
I'll be a woman, and you'll be a cowboy.

568
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,402
No one's gonna see that coming.
I should learn to knit.

569
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,490
I could knit a sweater or a sleeping bag
or a whole house. Need curtains?

570
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,485
Looks like night in here,
but I know it's day.

571
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,770
It's day, right? It's like Vegas.

572
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,166
Whoo! It's hot!

573
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,886
What is that white thing?

574
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,206
Oh, that's my underwear.

575
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,602
That's no underwear, that's a diaper!

576
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,290
I like a lot of coverage.

577
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,962
Come on, man. We're running out of time.

578
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,440
I feel like the cheese
fell off my cracker.

579
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,051
Why do you look like that?
You're supposed to be incognito.

580
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,369
Not look exactly like that picture
of you on TV. Oh, my God.

581
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,484
All of Texas law enforcement
is looking for these two.

582
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,166
Officer Cooper knows
the right thing to do...

583
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,408
and we are confident
that she'll come in.

584
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,644
At this hour, police are still
looking for the two suspects.

585
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,327
- Officer Cooper, who stands at 4' 11".
- Oh, come on.

586
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,729
- The other suspect, a 45-year-old Latina...
- Forty-five?

587
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,489
We have to get out of here.

588
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,331
If I could get to that cell phone,
I could call Captain Emmett.

589
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,767
You can't do that. He'll recognize us.

590
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,566
How are we supposed to pay
without him seeing our faces?

591
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,841
Let me handle it.

592
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,687
Here you go.

593
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,931
My God. We have to get out of here.

594
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,610
- Why?
- Right now. Come on.

595
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,805
Come on. Over here.

596
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,922
- Hey.
- Come on. Get in.

597
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,002
- What was that?
- Cortez's men.

598
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,287
What?

599
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,883
Don't worry. They didn't see us.

600
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,286
Okay.

601
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,209
We're gonna wait till he pulls over...

602
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,681
and then we're gonna commandeer
the vehicle.

603
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,282
Come here, boy! Hey!
Come here. Come here.

604
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,005
Aw. Look at you there.

605
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,844
You go out first, and then
I want you to go around and then wait.

606
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,449
So you're driving a car?

607
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,450
And looking for a cow to milk,
while putting on makeup.

608
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,406
But it doesn't look good, so you're
turning a tiny little radio on... What?

609
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,364
Oh, never mind. Come on!

610
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,561
And leave that!

611
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,246
No! I'm not going anywhere
without my suitcase!

612
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,245
What's in there, anyway?

613
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,006
- No, niña!
- Another kilo of baking powder?

614
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,645
You are not taking these!

615
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,451
Then I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,725
Shoes. You're gonna get us killed
over some shoes?

617
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,810
They're not just shoes.

618
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,401
These are gifts from my brother in Colombia.
These are the only things I have left from him.

619
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,291
He got in trouble with the wrong people.

620
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,960
He went to the police for help...

621
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,209
and he ended up dead.

622
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,562
So you wanted to know why I hate cops.
That's the reason.

623
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,724
So if you want to take me
to Dallas to die, fine.

624
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,605
But you're gonna take me
with my suitcase.

625
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,971
I'm sorry.

626
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,611
I didn't know.

627
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,884
But I'm not like those other cops.
You can trust me.

628
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,890
You have to stop treating me
like I'm a stupid rookie cop...

629
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,809
who doesn't know what she's doing.

630
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,522
Then you have to stop treating me
like I am a criminal.

631
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,646
Fine.

632
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,801
Fine.

633
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,401
Follow me.

634
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,251
Bingo! I got them!
All right, Mrs. Riva, we're gonna...

635
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,201
Who the hell are you,
and what are you doing in my truck?

636
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,925
Get away from it, lady.

637
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,531
Okay! Okay.

638
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,041
- My name is, um...
- Uh-huh.

639
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,325
My name is Nancy...

640
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,609
- Reagan.
- Mm-hm.

641
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,801
Right.

642
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,243
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it's what my parents named me.

643
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,441
Let me explain.

644
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,291
My friend and I are veterinarians
and we were in the neighborhood...

645
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,044
Shut your trap. I'm holding the gun.

646
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,370
I'm sorry. I know you don't like me.
But I'm sure you don't want me to get killed!

647
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,050
You should've thought about that.

648
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,206
I know you're mad, but can we
just talk about this reasonably?

649
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,606
Honey bunny!

650
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,929
There you are!

651
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,131
Sweetie pie.

652
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,687
I've been looking all over for you.

653
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,441
Who is that?

654
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,166
Hi. I am Dr. Shannon.

655
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,485
- I am her lover.
- What?

656
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,685
We had a little fight
but I'm sure you know whose fault it was.

657
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,681
It was not my fault.

658
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,407
You never accept that it's your fault.

659
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,921
You never talk about your feelings.

660
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,489
It's like being in love
with some tiny little brick wall.

661
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,490
How the hell you understand her?

662
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,324
- I don't know. It's really hard.
- I don't.

663
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,887
I usually don't even know
what she's talking about.

664
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,242
But we use body language.

665
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,649
That's bullshit. I'm calling the cops.

666
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,366
- Don't do that.
- No! This is outrageous.

667
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,686
No, no, no.

668
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,888
This is Rachel profiling.

669
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,762
- What?
- I can't be a doctor because I am Colombian?

670
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,965
Uh-huh. And I can't be a lesbian
because she's so unattractive...

671
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,762
and she has a mustache
and talks like some tiny little robot?

672
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,686
Well, let me tell you something:
She's my tiny little weird robot.

673
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,523
- And I love her.
- What are you doing?

674
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,205
Wait, what are you doing?

675
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,007
Trying to show him I love you.
I'm distracting him so he won't call the cops!

676
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,361
- Mm.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

677
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,120
- Kiss me. Kiss me. Men love this.
- Okay.

678
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,763
Yeah, I need to report
two suspicious women on my property.

679
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,371
- It's not working!
- Act sexy!

680
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,971
- Okay! Sexy.
- Come, come.

681
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,401
Oh, yeah! Pull my hair.
I like that! Yeah!

682
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,251
Yeah, I love it
when you pull my hair like that.

683
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,851
I feel so sexy.

684
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,762
My finger! Oh, God!

685
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,726
I did not just Cooper this.

686
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,729
You Cooper... You Cooper what?

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,480
Where is it?
It's gotta be here somewhere.

688
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,286
I can't believe this happened again!

689
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,807
- I gotta find that finger!
- We have to get out of here!

690
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,009
Bad doggy. What did you do?

691
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,565
- Oh, no.
- Hannibal!

692
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,285
I'm getting sick now.

693
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,403
- Hannibal.
- I just fed you!

694
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,001
I'm gonna give you
the Heimlich, all right?

695
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,089
This is where I go down!

696
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,601
This is my banjo hand!

697
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,805
The dog doesn't have the finger.

698
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,287
What?

699
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,127
The dog...

700
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,731
doesn't have the finger!

701
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,769
It's in my hair!

702
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,969
Okay! You have two choices:
You can stay here and mess with us...

703
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,046
or take this to the hospital,
have it reattached and shake with a full set.

704
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,127
Hey, come on!

705
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,926
Slow down!

706
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,644
- Hold on, you're going too fast.
- You would be able to keep up...

707
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,047
if you hadn't bought another pair
of stripper shoes.

708
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,085
And do not think that I forgot
you tried to escape.

709
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,363
I can't believe I bought that stupid
shoe story about your brother.

710
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,608
He's probably
an investment banker in Miami.

711
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,561
That I tried to escape
doesn't mean that the story's not true.

712
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,047
And I came back to save you...

713
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,571
so you're welcome!

714
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,683
I am not saying thank you!

715
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,681
I don't think...

716
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,723
I don't think I can make it.

717
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,325
Oh, you are gonna make it.

718
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,761
I woke up this morning
and my partner was killed.

719
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,645
I have been set up, shot at,
and hunted down.

720
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,684
Some guy shot off his finger,
and I tried to Heimlich his dog.

721
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,723
I let you get to second base with me...

722
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,366
or maybe third.
I've never been clear about that.

723
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,891
We're nowhere near Dallas...

724
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,801
and the police are gonna arrest us
any minute. Now move your ass.

725
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,371
Keys. I got keys.

726
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,571
Thank God.

727
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,968
Desnalgada, you're going to kill us!

728
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,447
Open the window or put some music.

729
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,687
- Okay.
- Yee.

730
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,121
The two female fugitives are still
on the lam. Police are...

731
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,961
I never promised you a rose garden

732
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,722
Along with the sunshine

733
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,322
There's gotta be a little rain sometimes

734
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,202
Hey. I was named after that song.

735
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,164
Oh, so your name is "Bad Song"?

736
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,771
That's just rude.

737
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,525
You know what is your problem?

738
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,327
Here we go.
I have a tendency to be hyper-focused...

739
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,522
so it's difficult to relate to people...

740
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,281
- when there's a task at hand.
- Exactly. That there is your problem.

741
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,211
- "10-520: I am boring!"
- Please do not make fun of me.

742
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,846
"10-45: I'm right and you're wrong."

743
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,010
- It relaxes me to do my numbers.
- Obviously doesn't work...

744
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,009
that's why you don't have a ring.

745
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,443
- You do not know anything about me.
- I have kissed you.

746
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,324
I have seen your underwear.

747
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,682
I know everything I need to know.

748
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,601
It's none of your business, but I happen
to have had a date the other night.

749
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,966
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

750
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,247
How did it go?

751
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,604
Well, it went the way that things go
when a man goes out with a woman...

752
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,041
and they have attraction
towards each other.

753
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,607
I don't know why I'd want advice
from you, anyway.

754
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,801
Did you...?

755
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,730
- What?
- Heh, heh.

756
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,963
- Does that mean what I think?
- Did you play with his chicken and eggs?

757
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,844
Oh, my God. I can't.

758
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,441
Ha-ha-ha. Did you give him a pirate key?

759
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,920
What is a pirate key?

760
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,441
I don't even know what that is.
That's horrifying.

761
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,291
Well, it depends on who the pirate is.

762
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,043
- It didn't work out on the date.
- Mm.

763
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,571
It never does.

764
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,406
I have a tendency to attract men
who run away from me.

765
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,647
Don't really know why.

766
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,290
- What was that?
- I don't know!

767
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,641
What is that?

768
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,650
Oh, God. It's a person.

769
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,762
- Help me get him out.
- It's a hot man-person.

770
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,362
Is he dead? He smells dead.

771
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,562
No, I think he's just drunk.

772
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,206
Oh, what, it's police procedure
to touch all his man parts?

773
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,246
He has an ankle monitor.

774
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,444
That means they can track us.
We're gonna have to cut it off.

775
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,809
No. I have a better idea.

776
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,765
I'm going to cut his foot off.

777
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,121
How's that a better idea?

778
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,167
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing? Aah.

779
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,762
- Nothing. We're doing nothing.
- We're just gonna cut your foot off.

780
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,480
- What?
- Relax.

781
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,200
I know what I did wrong
with my cousin, Eugenio.

782
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,606
Okay, he did bleed to death
two days later...

783
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,802
but, listen, he did it on his own terms:

784
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,209
With a drink in his hand
and as a free man.

785
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,763
- Let's do it.
- No. Ain't nobody cutting nobody's foot off.

786
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,724
Now, you just settle down and tell me:

787
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,607
Where the hell am I
and who the hell are you?

788
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,481
I am a police officer. She's a federal
witness in my protective custody.

789
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,041
I know she looks
like she can't protect nothing...

790
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,004
because she looks like My Little Pony...

791
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,650
- but it's true.
- Shh.

792
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,569
Who are you? What are you doing?

793
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,807
I'm Randy.

794
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,685
And you stole my truck.

795
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,440
Oh.

796
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,567
Hold on.

797
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,681
I know who you are.

798
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,970
I saw you on TV.

799
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,605
Yeah. You all are wanted.

800
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,962
- I have to use the rock!
- Hold on!

801
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,487
- That stuff they're saying on TV isn't true.
- Okay.

802
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,411
- We just have to get to Dallas and sort it out.
- Good.

803
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,965
- "Sort it out"?
- Yes.

804
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,243
You're gonna get your job back?
And I am going to get dead!

805
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,442
- You're not gonna get dead.
- They're waiting for us!

806
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,564
- The U.S. government will protect you.
- She wants me to go and testify!

807
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,600
- She never stops talking.
- But to do that, you have to have a head!

808
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,881
She is not wrong. If we get there too early,
we will be sitting ducks.

809
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,562
So we need a couple hours to lay low.
Now, can you help us with that?

810
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,604
Yeah, I can, but you gotta stop pointing
that thing at me.

811
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,606
Thank you.

812
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,367
What?

813
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,686
The Indian casino.

814
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,322
Under tribal law,
police ain't got jurisdiction.

815
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,522
You know this. I could drive you.

816
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,047
I could get you a room.
I know people there.

817
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,045
- I bet you do.
- She's always this judgmental.

818
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,401
He's a criminal.

819
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,446
You kidnapped me. You broke my parole.
What you gonna do, just leave me out here?

820
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,126
Yeah, why not?

821
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,563
They're looking for two ladies, right?
Well, this is three people.

822
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,644
So why don't you let me drive
and you can get in the back.

823
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,241
Look, I can help you. Just let me.

824
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,764
- Why should I trust you?
- Because I know what it feels like...

825
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,042
when no one
wants to hear your side of the story.

826
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,410
Plus, you know...

827
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,371
I kind of like your smile.

828
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,126
I'm not smiling.

829
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,482
Well, then, I got something
to look forward to.

830
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,441
You have a bottle opener?

831
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,440
Now we're talking.

832
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,365
Oh, cut it out.

833
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:26,163
Used correctly, bottle openers
can jack tires and pick door locks.

834
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,488
And then you throw it
in the river, and...

835
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,369
- Done.
- She has the worst arms ever.

836
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,050
- So skinny.
- Dang it!

837
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,811
Like I said, "Throw it in the river!

838
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,247
And...

839
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,602
Done." Let's go.

840
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,767
- Evening.
- Sir.

841
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,442
A female suspect and hostage are in the area.
You seen anything suspicious?

842
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,610
- Sir, I ain't seen anything.
- You sure? We think they're nearby.

843
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,926
Real sure.

844
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,240
All right.

845
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,924
Be on the lookout for two female
fugitives last seen heading north.

846
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,211
Come on. Keep it moving.

847
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,765
Let me see your ID.

848
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,042
Move forward to the double cones.

849
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,682
You're kidding me,
you lit a kid on fire?

850
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,690
No. I lit the mayor's kid on fire.

851
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,651
- It's not funny.
- Are you kidding me? It's super funny.

852
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,887
Okay.

853
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,242
I guess it is a little bit funny.

854
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,569
And I wouldn't care so much,
but my father was a very respected man.

855
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,888
And I turned his name into a joke.

856
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,525
He died a few years ago.

857
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,410
In the line of duty.

858
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,923
I'm so sorry for your loss.

859
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,482
I will say a prayer for him.

860
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,886
Thank you.

861
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,001
Just that all I ever...

862
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,487
- Oh, right now?
- Shh. Mm.

863
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,084
- All I ever wanted was...
- Mm.

864
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,245
Amen.

865
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,527
Go on.

866
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,601
I was just saying, all I ever wanted
was to be just like him.

867
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,644
So that's why you always act
like a little man.

868
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,729
You're pretending to be someone
that you're not.

869
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,446
You have to be who you are. Own it.

870
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,722
But I have to be tough to be a cop.

871
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,121
I gotta get my name back.

872
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,849
You can't wait for them to give it to you.
You have to take it.

873
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,564
I'm just saying that I wouldn't let the fact
that you have a little cuca...

874
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,008
get in the way of your dream!

875
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,202
Checkpoint. You better figure
something out.

876
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,162
- We have to get through. We gotta hide.
- Let's hide underneath this blanket.

877
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,131
- This is a deer skin!
- Calm down. He's probably a hunter.

878
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,288
- Let's go.
- Move forward to the double cones.

879
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,488
Looking for two female fugitives.

880
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,051
I'm gonna check the back.

881
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,481
Go ahead.

882
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,161
Move along.

883
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,364
It smells in here.

884
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,604
It does not smell.
It is not a real deer. It's a decoy.

885
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,848
Okay, this probably wasn't my best idea.

886
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,769
We need to make some deer noises.

887
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,200
What is a deer noise?

888
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,727
Deer noises, like,
you know, like the dogs says:

889
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,641
Shh. Be quiet! What does a deer say?

890
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,961
That is not what a deer says.
If it says anything, it sounds like this:

891
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,929
Are you kidding me? It's not a horse.

892
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,451
It is from the horse family.

893
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,404
Just make the noise.

894
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,324
Hey, I think I hear something over here.

895
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,726
Keep doing the sounds.

896
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,724
Oh, my God. I think it's working!

897
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,323
I can't believe I'm saying this.
I'm actually having fun with you.

898
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,806
- You are?
- No, of course not.

899
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,049
I'm underneath a deer
and with my head up your ass.

900
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,408
Shut up. We gotta go find Randy.

901
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,681
That bellhop looked at me funny.

902
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,805
Y'all all right?

903
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,571
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

904
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,841
Okay.

905
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,491
We have to keep a low profile.
You can rest for a bit...

906
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,404
but we have to leave by sunrise...

907
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,120
- to get you to the courthouse.
- I know, by 8:00 a.m.

908
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,721
Just in time to get my head blown off.

909
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,684
What are you doing? They charge
an arm and a leg for that stuff.

910
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,042
I would think
that you would love the minibar.

911
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,170
The things inside must feel so normal
in your little hands.

912
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,283
Why don't you go and commandeer some food
from your cowboy boyfriend?

913
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,411
I am not going to dignify that statement
with a response.

914
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,809
I am, however, responsible for you...

915
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,203
so I am gonna go next door
to get some food.

916
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,962
And, unfortunately, I have to do this.

917
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,250
Because, as you know,
you are a flight risk.

918
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,163
- Be right back.
- Come here.

919
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,240
Come here.

920
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,604
- Thank you.
- Okay.

921
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,529
Thank you for protecting me.

922
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,084
All right. Well, that's my job.

923
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,765
Thank you very much.

924
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,401
Okay.

925
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,650
I'll turn on the TV for you.

926
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,126
They tried to seduce me
with some lesbian stuff...

927
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,971
but I'm a Christian,
so I wasn't interested in that.

928
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,046
Well, there was two of them. One was
a real tall gal with a nice figure...

929
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,527
and she had a little blond boy with her.

930
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,487
Officer Cooper is 4' 9".

931
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,807
I am 5' 2".

932
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,209
- She's traveling with a 50-year-old suspect.
- Fifty!

933
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,605
Here, read a book.

934
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,609
I already know the ending.

935
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,526
Suit yourself.

936
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,923
Hello? Randy?

937
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,687
- Oh, hey. Um...
- Aah!

938
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,006
Penis! Oh, my God.

939
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,327
- Penis!
- Uh...

940
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,761
- I'm gonna get a towel.
- What? I'm sorry. Please.

941
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,248
I was gonna say that.
That's what I was gonna say. Um...

942
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,807
The reason I came was as follows:

943
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,402
I'm in a very difficult
work situation...

944
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,968
my blood sugar is getting dangerously low,
and I need food.

945
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,003
And I need you to get it for me.

946
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,007
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

947
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,402
Yes, I will have dinner with you.

948
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,087
Oh, no, I didn't say that.

949
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,204
I don't have meals
with convicted felons.

950
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,086
Heh. I don't have dinner with dirty cops,
so I guess that makes us even.

951
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,282
Plus, you know,
I'm the good kind of felon.

952
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,163
- There is no such thing.
- Sure is.

953
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,847
My sister was getting knocked around
by her boyfriend, so I beat him up.

954
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,851
Oh. Well, then that shouldn't be a f...

955
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,168
With a baseball bat, so...

956
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,001
Oh, a 10-41 Apple. Copy that.

957
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,806
And my other sister,
she dated a similar piece of shit.

958
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,407
Maybe call it my hot-button issue,
if you like.

959
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,969
I hope you don't have a third sister.

960
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,130
Three felony assaults,
plus a history of established behavior...

961
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,085
will definitely end you up
in more than an ankle monitor.

962
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,928
More like a jumpsuit. Heh.

963
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,201
An orange one.

964
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,764
In prison. That's a...

965
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,371
Why are you smiling at me?

966
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,771
You're kind of intense.

967
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,406
Oh. Yeah, I've heard that before.

968
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,841
I dig it.

969
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,087
You do?

970
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,640
Yeah, I do.

971
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,760
There it is.

972
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,769
It was worth the wait.

973
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,448
Hey, you know what?
I gotta see something.

974
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,450
Aah! Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

975
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,201
No! I'm on duty, and that is
a very difficult work situation in there...

976
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,529
and this is gonna have to wait
because time waits for no man.

977
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,650
Except this is the opposite,
time is waiting for every man.

978
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,564
But no man's gonna do this.

979
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,961
That's not what I meant.

980
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,164
What I meant was, section 428
of the Texas State Penal Code...

981
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,724
forbids fraternization between
a officer... Never mind.

982
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,170
Why does that feel so good?

983
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,882
Now go get me food before I pass out.

984
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,046
You got it.

985
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,962
- Something very bizarre just happened in there.
- You're going to be mad.

986
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,446
How'd you get my gun?

987
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,008
I took it during that pathetic excuse
of a hug that you gave me.

988
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,770
Now give me the key, I'm leaving.

989
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,691
This is not funny.
That's my gun and it's police property.

990
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,086
I'm not going to Dallas.

991
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,930
I was never going to testify.

992
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,727
I was just going to get away from Felipe
and start alone on my own.

993
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,366
- So you have been lying to me this whole time?
- No.

994
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,490
Yes and no.

995
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,924
Mostly yes.

996
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,407
But that's not
what is important right now.

997
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,648
This is what is insane.

998
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,729
You were not supposed to read that.

999
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,208
Heh, heh. "Mrs. Riva's constant use
of her physical assets...

1000
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,290
rather than her somewhat limited
mental capacity...

1001
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,166
suggests that she might not know
as much as the prosecution would hope."

1002
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,563
I was saying you are not a criminal.

1003
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,287
No, you were saying
that I was too dumb to be a criminal.

1004
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,046
This is what happens...

1005
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,244
when you underestimate a book
because of its cover.

1006
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,921
I did not underestimate you.
I overestimated you.

1007
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,169
It turns out you're exactly who
I thought you were when I met you.

1008
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,648
Shut up and untie this cheap bracelet.

1009
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,170
Move it. Move.

1010
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,841
- I'm moving.
- Move.

1011
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,161
You're gonna need this!

1012
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,126
- Gun! I gotta get the gun!
- No, you don't!

1013
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,881
- I can't believe I trusted you.
- It's not my fault you let your guard down!

1014
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,844
- Yes, it is!
- No!

1015
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,881
- I refuse to have a catfight.
- Too bad!

1016
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,763
- What was your skill for Miss Plantain? Lying?
- Get off, hillbilly.

1017
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,008
That is so dirty and disgusting!

1018
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,248
Dirty? I'm gonna show you
dirty, Miss Piggy.

1019
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,527
Is that the remote?

1020
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,769
That thing is covered in germs.
It's like a toilet seat.

1021
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,326
I got stuck!

1022
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,046
Give it!

1023
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,650
Tell me why that bag's so heavy.

1024
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,811
- What?
- How many pairs of shoes are in there?

1025
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,611
Twelve.

1026
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,166
- Eighteen. 18.
- Show me.

1027
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,527
Open the bag!

1028
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,007
Hurry up.

1029
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,167
You would never understand...

1030
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,887
but I needed the sparkly
stilettos to go out...

1031
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,084
and I need the sparkly stilettos
when I stay in...

1032
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,962
- and I need the corky wedges, and I need...
- I have been in evidence for over three years.

1033
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,441
Average pair of women's shoes
weighs about a half a pound.

1034
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,530
You'd need over 80 pairs
in there for it to weigh that much.

1035
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,767
Give me one of those.

1036
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,050
What's this made of? Platinum?

1037
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,487
No.

1038
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,324
It's white gold and diamonds.

1039
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,171
That's how my husband
smuggled money into this country...

1040
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,160
as presents for his vain,
dumb trophy wife.

1041
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,046
How much is that bag worth?

1042
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,484
- I don't know, I have limited mental capacit...
- How much is it worth?

1043
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,126
About $4 million.

1044
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,486
- What?
- I know.

1045
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,570
It depends on how the commodities
are trading at the moment.

1046
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,805
I'm putting all of that in evidence.

1047
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,048
Just gonna need a lot of bags,
a huge label maker...

1048
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,040
- but I'll make it happen.
- Hola, housekeeping!

1049
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,008
- Turndown service.
- That's Dixon and Hauser.

1050
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,121
We've gotta go!

1051
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,161
Hurry!

1052
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,925
Open up!

1053
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,880
Goddamn it.

1054
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,686
Dang it! Bring the bag!

1055
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,601
Dixon. Dixon!

1056
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,965
Goddamn. All right, you go that way.
I'll go the other way.

1057
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,647
Get down.

1058
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,962
I'm trying. It's more far for me.

1059
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,045
Got you.

1060
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,764
Hey, Chiquita, get back.

1061
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,611
Hauser, you don't wanna do this. You've
already killed one fellow officer today.

1062
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,201
Yeah, but they say
it only hurts the first time.

1063
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,570
Hey, I was just coming...

1064
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,641
I told you you should've stayed
behind a desk, Coop.

1065
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,171
Son of a...

1066
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,408
- I'll call you.
- How you gonna find me?

1067
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,647
I'll run your plates!

1068
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,046
I'd like that.

1069
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,688
Did you see that?
This is what we gotta do.

1070
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,161
We gotta get a taxi or a shuttle
or something.

1071
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,169
Okay, last call.

1072
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,769
I need a taxi. Sorry, this is important.

1073
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,970
Hi, I want to get in this bus.

1074
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,526
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

1075
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,643
Okay, welcome aboard.

1076
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,009
I'm gonna need a taxi to Dallas.

1077
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,768
Hey! Hey!

1078
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,130
Come back here!

1079
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,566
Hey! Get out of the way.

1080
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,323
- I gotta get up there!
- Close the door!

1081
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,808
- She looks like that dirty cop in the news.
- No! I'm a big fan of, um...

1082
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,367
Cowboy Noiz.

1083
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,121
I'm the biggest fan they have,
I wanna get up close and personal with them.

1084
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,482
- I'm sorry but this is...
- Well, you let her on!

1085
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,960
Did she promise you favors?

1086
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,209
Because I can promise you
a good time too. I'm a lady...

1087
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,687
- I'm a lady looking for action.
- Okay...

1088
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,131
Some sex-type action.
Giving and receiving of sex.

1089
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,722
Now, I'm just gonna bang
everybody's brains out in there...

1090
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,287
and lots of dirty, dirty sex stuff.

1091
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,605
Like cracking the eggs...

1092
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,770
and doing the pirate hunt
in the general area of the heinie.

1093
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,203
That's supposed to be a key.
I think this goes into the patootie.

1094
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,402
- Okay.
- Okay.

1095
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,411
- Morning.
- How are you, ma'am?

1096
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,890
That was really sexy.

1097
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,527
I don't wanna hear it out of you.
I don't wanna hear anything out of you.

1098
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,683
From here to Dallas, we ride in silence.

1099
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,051
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to begin our audio tour.

1100
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,846
Please make sure your headphones
are plugged in...

1101
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,691
- I can't wait to hear this!
- Yeah, to get bored to death.

1102
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,965
Did you even have a brother?

1103
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,447
You don't deserve
to know anything about him.

1104
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,963
Did your husband kill your brother?

1105
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,486
You don't even understand.

1106
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,810
Why don't you go back to your tiny
little desk and your tiny little life?

1107
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,850
I have a job to do,
except now it's different.

1108
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,242
Instead of being my witness,
you're my prisoner.

1109
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,001
If we get to Dallas and you don't wanna
testify, you can go straight to jail.

1110
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,442
Don't ever talk about my father
like that again.

1111
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,889
What the hell? You speak Spanish.

1112
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,970
What, the white girl can't take
a Spanish class in high school?

1113
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,844
I know everything you said about me.

1114
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,930
And no, I'm not an idiot,
and no, I don't have a flat ass.

1115
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,167
Oh, man.

1116
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,250
Do not pull over. That's an order.

1117
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,646
- Aah!
- Get out of the way!

1118
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,968
Oh, my God! Aah!

1119
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,565
Oh, no!

1120
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,006
Is that our bus driver?

1121
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,487
Okay! Uh...

1122
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,409
I can't reach the pedals.

1123
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,847
- I can't reach the pedals!
- Get up! Get up!

1124
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,129
- Sit in my lap! I'll drive! Get on top of me!
- Okay.

1125
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have commandeered the vehicle.

1126
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,602
Keep your teeth in your mouth,
butts in your seats.

1127
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,290
Speed up! Speed up!

1128
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,242
Oh, no, here they come!
I gotta get my gun!

1129
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,124
- Come on.
- Cooper's driving. Whoa, whoa.

1130
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,129
Stop flipping your ponytail
in my face! I can't see!

1131
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,004
She's such a good driver.

1132
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,248
There, I got it. Okay! Okay!

1133
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,164
Move your ponytail! I can't see!

1134
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,887
Let's do it like that.

1135
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,570
No, no! Your hand's in my face.

1136
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,683
- Take the shot!
- How if you don't keep it steady?

1137
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,006
I'm trying! She's moving!

1138
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,366
I gotta get a better shot.

1139
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,483
Hurry up! Give me, give me the wheel!

1140
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,009
I can't see!

1141
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,041
Oh!

1142
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,401
Okay. I think I got him.

1143
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,045
- Shoot him again.
- Move.

1144
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,405
Dang it! My gun.

1145
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,926
Scoot over, I'm gonna drive!

1146
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,531
- I'll drive!
- No, let me drive.

1147
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,728
Wait, he's coming back! Here he comes!

1148
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,570
- What do I do?
- I don't know!

1149
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,566
We're gonna bump him, okay?

1150
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,762
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three. Go!

1151
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,888
- Dang it.
- We did it.

1152
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,489
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1153
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,206
Oh, my God.

1154
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,724
- My feet got stuck.
- What?

1155
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,048
- My feet got stuck! I can't pull it out!
- Pull it out!

1156
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,526
Hit the brake!

1157
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,123
- Stop!
- Get out of the way!

1158
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,526
- Look out for the truck!
- Watch it!

1159
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,889
- Aah!
- Aah! Step on the brake!

1160
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,330
- Again. Again.
- We did it.

1161
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,646
We did it!

1162
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,404
Move! Move!

1163
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,045
Is everybody okay back there?

1164
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,401
Yeah.

1165
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,046
It's kind of hard to tell
with some of y'all!

1166
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,287
We did it.

1167
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,811
Oh!

1168
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,445
Is that part of the tour?

1169
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,246
Is she breathing?

1170
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,044
Do you think she has any snacks?

1171
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,924
Why would you ask that?

1172
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,326
Well, I don't know.

1173
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,089
So you had your husband killed?

1174
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,006
Why don't write this
in your little diary:

1175
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,204
I didn't kill Felipe.

1176
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,724
They were supposed to go in to kidnap me,
take me out of there.

1177
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,570
Oh, my God.

1178
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,088
Cortez killed your brother,
and now you're gonna try and kill him.

1179
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,610
You don't have to do this, you know.
We can put Cortez in jail.

1180
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,922
Jail is not good enough for that animal.

1181
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,290
You saved my life...

1182
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,643
so I'm not gonna let them shoot you.

1183
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,645
This is the last time
I'm gonna do you any favors.

1184
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,526
- I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
- This is the way it's gonna go.

1185
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,640
You're not going to try to stop me.

1186
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,483
I would hate to see you dead.

1187
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,124
We made a good team.

1188
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,928
Mrs. Riva, you don't have to do this.

1189
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,686
Damn it.

1190
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,448
Breaking news
in the Vicente Cortez story:

1191
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,086
Following the slaying
of lead witness, Felipe Riva...

1192
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,442
and the disappearance
of his wife, Daniella Riva...

1193
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,086
we are now learning that,
without any witnesses...

1194
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,931
authorities have had no choice
but to release Cortez.

1195
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:26,250
Sources say Cortez's daughter, Teresa,
is likely to be celebrating her quinceañera...

1196
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,762
at the opulent Royal Colfax Hotel.

1197
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,725
Meanwhile, law enforcement officials
are forced to stand and watch...

1198
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,082
Come on.
At least we got Dixon and Hauser.

1199
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,967
I failed.

1200
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,731
No, you didn't. You kept her alive.

1201
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,365
Not for long.

1202
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,007
She's gonna kill Cortez
at his daughter's quinceañera.

1203
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,361
Mrs. Riva?

1204
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,210
She's a criminal mastermind now?

1205
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,640
She's gonna kill Cortez?

1206
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,282
I know it seems hard to believe, but
there's more to her than you think.

1207
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,448
We have to do something
about it, captain.

1208
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,762
Look, you're now clear of all charges.

1209
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,450
Your father would be very proud.

1210
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,688
It's time for you to go home
and get some sleep.

1211
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,081
I can't sleep knowing she might
kill somebody or...

1212
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,244
This isn't our jurisdiction.
It's the DEA's problem now.

1213
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,726
And even if you're right...

1214
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,526
maybe this is the universe's way
of cleaning this up.

1215
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,486
- If I could just go there...
- That's impossible. Security'll be too tight.

1216
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,010
You know what you should be
thinking about? Your next beat.

1217
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,721
You're out of the evidence room.
Congratulations.

1218
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,601
Now turn in your I.R.L.
Take your promotion.

1219
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,126
Go home.

1220
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,886
Turn around.

1221
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,531
She's clear.

1222
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,046
Daniella, what happened?

1223
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,446
I've been worried sick.

1224
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,246
Vicente, I never wanted to testify.

1225
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,321
I begged Felipe not to betray you,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

1226
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,170
Now I'm all alone.

1227
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,442
I'm here for you, cariño.

1228
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,049
Meet me in the next room...

1229
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,844
so we can speak privately.

1230
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,731
I want to thank you for your loyalty.

1231
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,170
Okay?

1232
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,645
Chica. Psst.

1233
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,484
Why do you look like José Bieber?

1234
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:26,886
How did you get in here?

1235
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,810
- Nothing here.
- Yup, nothing there.

1236
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,286
- Nothing there.
- Nothing.

1237
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,686
- He's clear.
- What?

1238
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,248
- You're the one who told me I look like a boy.
- That's not what I meant.

1239
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,128
- But I'm totally crushing it as a dude.
- That fake mustache you put on is perfect.

1240
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,651
I don't have a fake mustache.

1241
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,689
- Let me touch it. Let me touch it.
- Come.

1242
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,800
This is a suicide mission.

1243
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,331
- I don't care.
- I do care.

1244
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,888
You're kind of mean, and I only understand
about 30 percent of what you're saying...

1245
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:58,129
but somewhere, around there,
there is a heart.

1246
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,685
Don't try and kill Cortez.
I have a better idea.

1247
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,405
It's here in my tighty whities.

1248
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,291
It's stuck.

1249
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,569
You want me to wear a wire?

1250
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,604
Yes, but I'm not exactly sure
where we're gonna put it.

1251
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,928
I told you to stay away from me.

1252
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,207
This is too dangerous.

1253
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,402
Wait a second.
We're gonna do this together.

1254
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,491
I'll create a distraction and you'll get
Cortez to confess to killing your brother.

1255
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:24,682
We can put him away for good.

1256
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,921
Okay.

1257
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,446
It works best if you put it
in the upper thigh.

1258
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:38,251
Or the chestal area.

1259
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,247
Are you doing it?

1260
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,527
Yes! That's it.

1261
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,802
So you're just gonna squish it
way down there.

1262
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,890
No! Shove it all the way in!
Do it like I showed you.

1263
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,129
Just pull them apart
and then shove it back in. Let me see it.

1264
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,407
You pervert.

1265
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,647
Get out of here!

1266
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,764
You and your perverted little mustache.
Get out!

1267
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,088
Come on.
Didn't your mother teach you manners?

1268
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,248
Aah! Dang it!

1269
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,087
Look at this photo.

1270
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,328
Oh, my gosh! He totally photobombed you.

1271
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,567
I didn't even see that.

1272
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,484
Oh, he's cute.

1273
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,486
Well, actually, heh,
maybe I'll introduce you.

1274
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,645
- We should go back.
- No way. Oh, man.

1275
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,406
Excuse me, coming through.

1276
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,001
- Pick up your feet.
- These shoes are a safety hazard.

1277
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,480
Keep it moving.

1278
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,441
Wanna dance?

1279
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,051
Captain Emmett.

1280
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,121
- Cooper, what are you doing here?
- I'm glad you're here.

1281
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,766
- I knew you would believe me.
- I told you to go home.

1282
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,367
No, you're not gonna need
your weapon right now.

1283
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,606
What are you doing?

1284
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,205
You don't follow orders, do you?

1285
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,286
Well, maybe you will now.
Outside, quickly and quietly.

1286
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,927
- I don't believe this.
- Just relax.

1287
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,451
I trusted you.

1288
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,889
My father trusted you.

1289
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,964
We're just going outside
to find someplace to talk.

1290
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,088
Don't make me use this.

1291
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,401
Ladies and gentleman,
Miss Teresa Cortez!

1292
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,604
- Come on.
- Aah!

1293
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,250
First of all, I want to thank
everyone for coming.

1294
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,086
Second, Elsa Muñez,
I hope you're watching on YouTube...

1295
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,291
because you weren't invited. And you
won't be until you apologize to Patricia.

1296
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,321
All right, party people.
Now it's time for the surprise dance.

1297
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,765
Let's go. Let's go.

1298
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,886
Teresa!

1299
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,923
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

1300
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,447
Are we alone?

1301
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,125
Where are your men?

1302
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:33,361
Enjoying the party.

1303
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,800
Out of the way!

1304
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,126
- Aah!
- Shouldn't have been this hard.

1305
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,129
You were supposed to go to Riva's...

1306
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,687
write in your little notebook,
and leave.

1307
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,490
But you just had to show up early.

1308
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,331
You're working for a drug lord.
You're killing people.

1309
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,726
See, that's your problem.

1310
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,769
You're too by-the-book.

1311
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,531
There are cops that understand
the gray area...

1312
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,603
and cops who have to be eliminated.

1313
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,325
And not everybody wants to die...

1314
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,166
a poor, happy Boy Scout
like your father.

1315
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,841
- That make you feel better?
- No, but this does!

1316
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,403
You just got Coopered, bitch!

1317
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,408
What do you think that you're...?

1318
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,085
Get out of the way!

1319
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,041
Come on. Relax, cariño.

1320
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,209
You could be anywhere
in the world right now.

1321
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,810
Why did you come back?

1322
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,526
Well...

1323
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,965
like you said:

1324
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,649
"Family is everything."

1325
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,569
And you took mine away from me.

1326
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,125
You killed my brother...

1327
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,448
Well, the good news is
you're about to see him again.

1328
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,007
Drop your weapon!

1329
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,281
Your brother was a coward...

1330
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,808
crying like a baby.

1331
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,722
He begged for his life.

1332
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,129
Now you will do the same.

1333
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,486
Never.

1334
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,041
Vicente Cortez, you're under arrest...

1335
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,371
for murder and attempted murder,
and I'll figure out the rest later.

1336
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,246
Miss Riva.

1337
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,761
Put the gun down.

1338
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,968
If you pull that trigger,
you'll go to jail for the rest of your life.

1339
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,170
Think about what you're doing.

1340
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,529
He killed my brother.

1341
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,128
He killed the only family I had.

1342
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,644
I can't let him live.

1343
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,843
And I can't let you kill him.

1344
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,084
Don't make me stop you.

1345
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,928
I'm asking you for the last time.

1346
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,569
Put the gun down.

1347
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,164
You won't regret this. I promise.

1348
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,127
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

1349
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,807
You made me not kill him
so that you get to kill him?

1350
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,570
I get to kill him?

1351
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,966
I just saved your life!

1352
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,970
I have been waiting for six years
for this moment...

1353
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,003
and you come at the last second
and ruin it?

1354
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,810
I just took a bullet for you!

1355
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,890
You took a bullet for me?
It went right through you and hit me!

1356
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,203
Because your stupid little skinny arms
cannot even stop a bullet!

1357
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,447
- Wait a second.
- What?

1358
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,005
I got shot?

1359
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,163
- I got shot.
- Yeah, you little cucaracha.

1360
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,203
Oh, my God. I didn't even feel it.

1361
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,129
- You need to sit down.
- Okay.

1362
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,561
It's gonna be okay. Just sit down.

1363
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:10,486
- Come here, Cooper.
- Ugh. Ow.

1364
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,691
It's not that bad, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine, Cooper.

1365
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:16,961
Rose.

1366
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,366
What?

1367
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,604
My name is Rose.

1368
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,611
Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

1369
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,404
Just hold it there.

1370
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,970
Officer Cooper here for a Bravo 6971.

1371
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,288
You're Cooper? The Cooper?

1372
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,605
Yes, but let me explain.

1373
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,845
That civilian came out of nowhere
and said, "Shotgun," and I did not know...

1374
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,644
You took down Vicente Cortez!

1375
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,121
Oh, yes, that is me.

1376
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,367
So nice to meet you.

1377
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,201
Nice to meet you too.

1378
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,680
I heard you took a bullet.

1379
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,644
She did not take a bullet.

1380
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,042
She just slowed it down.

1381
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,561
Hello, Miss Riva.

1382
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,921
You gotta be kidding me.

1383
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:10,521
You look like a sexy traffic cone.

1384
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,246
I do not believe
they'll let you leave in that outfit.

1385
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,206
Oh, no? What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna call a 10-545?

1386
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,368
Or, a 75-49?

1387
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,607
Okay, all right.

1388
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,490
One for the road, honey.

1389
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,411
Ay, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda.

1390
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,770
I'm going to miss you.

1391
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,088
Don't forget everything I taught you.

1392
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,408
First is the toner and then...

1393
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,921
- the sunscreen.
- The sunscreen. I remember!

1394
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,970
- Ciao, Jimmy!
- Ciao, ciao.

1395
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,844
God, I'm gonna miss her.

1396
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,442
Get your ass back in that cell!

1397
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,246
Thank you.

1398
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,251
Well, seems like you did
very well for yourself.

1399
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,843
Well, I am the lady who knows the lady
who took down Vicente Cortez.

1400
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,123
I had a bird, I had the Time Warner...

1401
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,482
Actually, I'm kind of, like, annoyed...

1402
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,048
that they only gave me three months
for obstructing your justice.

1403
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,242
Maybe now you'll be
on the straight and narrow.

1404
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,647
Please, I'm always going to have
some curves.

1405
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:12,126
Well, there's one thing
you're gonna need either way:

1406
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,961
- The right pair of shoes.
- Aah!

1407
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,085
How did you...?

1408
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,248
Must have gotten lost in evidence.

1409
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,722
I can't believe that you broke
your little book of rules for me.

1410
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,046
All right, keep it down.

1411
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,841
Exactly how many times
did you broke the rules?

1412
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,008
I mean, exactly how many pairs of times?

1413
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,005
Well, I got you the sparkly stilettos
to go out...

1414
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,004
the sparkly stilettos to stay in...

1415
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,924
and, of course, the corky wedges.

1416
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:40,842
I mean, I could kiss you right now.

1417
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,242
But I remember that was not
your strong suit.

1418
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,647
Please don't.

1419
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,721
You know, you seem different now.

1420
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,644
I do? How?

1421
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,327
Taller.

1422
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,321
Oh, look at you. You're such
a badass now, breaking all the rules.

1423
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,291
I'll have you know, too,
I've also broken some other rules.

1424
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,409
I'm breaking a 10-66 right now.

1425
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,568
Oh, harboring a fugitive?

1426
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,203
- Can't just tap the brake, can you?
- Sorry, honey.

1427
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,684
Oh!

1428
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,927
What is he doing here?

1429
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,488
We're keeping our relationship
a bit under the radar.

1430
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,889
- We're not ready to go public yet.
- Hola, cowboy.

1431
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,841
All right, all right. And technically
he is not a fugitive. I helped him get off.

1432
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,644
Oh, I'm sure you did.

1433
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,211
That's disgusting.

1434
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,847
Somebody's getting Coopered.

1435
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,201
All right, cut it out.

1436
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,763
Okay, I might've Coopered him a little.

1437
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,481
Clap it.

1438
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,650
Now tell me why that bag's so heavy!

1439
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,683
Hold on, Reese.
We're checking something.

1440
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,082
God, I was giving
the performance of a lifetime.

1441
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,200
Or, I could drive you.

1442
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,407
Sorry! Sorry! Okay.

1443
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,080
Oh, yeah. It's there.
He left. I think he left.

1444
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,284
I'll get you... Seriously, motherf...

1445
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,602
- Shoot! Shoot!
- I'm shooting at him!

1446
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,808
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

1447
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,925
So if you want to take me
to Dallas to die, take me.

1448
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,521
But you're taking me with my...

1449
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,006
big bag.

1450
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,680
What is my word?

1451
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,882
- We need to find something of clothes.
- Yes.

1452
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,327
- No, that's not the line.
- Still rolling!

1453
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:54,207
You see, once a month
my uterus shreds...

1454
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,050
Yep, her uterus.

1455
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,361
It shreds, huh?

1456
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,690
- It must hurt. Does that hurt?
- I'm just saying...

1457
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:05,566
I wouldn't let the fact that I have
a little cuca get in the way of my dream.

1458
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,285
That means "a dream." One second.

1459
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,090
- Of your DVD?
- I forgot.

1460
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:11,291
Here's a blanket.

1461
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,727
Oh, my God!

1462
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,003
What, a hot girl can't read the whole...

1463
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,121
I had a stroke.

1464
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,569
Now you're mouthing the words.

1465
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,127
No, that doesn't make any sense.

1466
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,129
Why do you look like you're in Menudo?

1467
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,129
Well, why do you look like Bruno Mars?

1468
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,209
Why do you look like Marc Anthony?

1469
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,487
Let me do it again.

1470
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,886
Here.

1471
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,527
You...

1472
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,125
I have a better idea.

1473
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,201
Your hair.

1474
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,768
Every time you come up,
your hair is different.

1475
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:09,405
Who are you talking to?

1476
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:14,762
I can't remember my next line.

1477
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,761
What's my next line?

1478
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,331
Oh, yeah, right.
