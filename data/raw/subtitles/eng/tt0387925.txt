1
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,548
GIRL: Okay, now, sit.

2
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,483
Stay. Good.

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,988
Shake your paw.

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,649
- Good girl.
- (second girl laughs)

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,192
Okay, now, lie down.

6
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,931
Now, sit. Sit.

7
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,489
Good girl.

8
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,125
Good. Now, stay.

9
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,192
Come!

10
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,099
Aw, yuck! Gross!

11
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,609
- (tire bursts)
- Ray, quick, duck!

12
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,045
PASSENGER:
I knew it! We got a flat.

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,055
DRIVER: There's a can of that
quick tire fix in the back.

14
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,293
PASSENGER:
Okay. Tire fix.

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,885
DRIVER: Kosh,
come on, come on, come on.

16
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,396
(driver laughing)

17
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,401
Kosh, we made a great haul
this time!

18
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,869
This one painting alone

19
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,203
is gonna bring me in at least
a quarter of a mill...

20
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,764
(gasps)

21
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,367
(whimpers)

22
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,634
Kosh!

23
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,907
Yeah?

24
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,410
There's a dog in the truck!

25
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,349
Oh, you mean puppy.

26
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,410
- Puppy?
- Shh!

27
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,581
DRIVER:
Well, whatever it is...

28
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,494
...what is it doing
in the truck?

29
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,893
KOSH: Well, he seemed cute.
I snagged him at the last hit.

30
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,625
Thought we could use
some company.

31
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,291
DRIVER: Get rid of him!
KOSH: What?

32
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,356
DRIVER: Now!

33
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,936
Go on. Get. Get.

34
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,169
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,905
GIRL: Oh, no!

36
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,584
(truck horn blares)

37
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,793
Sal, look out!

38
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,963
Sal, you saved him.

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,337
(Puppy whimpers)

40
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,377
(bell tolls)

41
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,936
SAL: Come on or we'll be late.
Let's take the shortcut.

42
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,006
RAY: We're not allowed, Sal.
If Mother Agnes finds out...

43
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,311
She can't see us
all the way out here.

44
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,716
We've got to this time.

45
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,481
Wait up!

46
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,820
(bell tolling)

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,151
RAY: But what about
Mother Agnes?

48
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,594
The puppy?

49
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,224
We're not gonna leave him here,
and we're not gonna tell her.

50
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,535
NUN: God bless you.

51
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,737
Do you think we'll ever
get 'dopted, Sal?

52
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,439
Probably not.

53
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,982
Mostly people just want little kids.

54
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,312
Bye, Chelsea.

55
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,419
Okay, now, run!

56
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,157
NUN: Ahem!
Excuse me!

57
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,169
You two young ladies
are very late for afternoon meal.

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,205
Now, you'd better get up
to the dining hall right away.

59
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,365
Yes, Mother Agnes.

60
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,872
(girls laughing and talking)

61
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,745
Eww.

62
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,414
MOTHER AGNES:
Good day, sisters.

63
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,425
NUN: Mother Agnes!
(chuckles)

64
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,120
(low bark)

65
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,594
(gasps)

66
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,858
- Sal, you got a puppy!
- Shh!

67
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,593
(puppy barks softly)

68
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,558
You might like to salt that.

69
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,594
(gasps)

70
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,105
Oh, no! Ray!

71
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,765
What?

72
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,707
Aah! Mouse!

73
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,245
- (girls screaming)
- (puppy barking)

74
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,207
- Girls!
- Aah! Mouse!

75
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,648
Eww! Eww, mouse!

76
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,711
- (puppy barks)
- RAY: Come on.

77
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,423
Girls!

78
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,959
(puppy barks)

79
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,062
(Ray chuckles)

80
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:02,597
(girls screaming)

81
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,763
GIRLS: Mouse! Mouse!

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,070
Sister Helen, go and see
what those two are up to

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,304
while we deal with this chaos.

84
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,470
Yes, Mother Agnes.

85
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,945
Girls! Girls!

86
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,581
Where the dickens? Ohh!

87
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,678
SISTER HELEN:
Girls? Girls!

88
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,955
(panting for breath)

89
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,421
Quick, the drawer!

90
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,590
(panting for breath)

91
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,867
Mom!

92
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,097
I thought I'd lost it.

93
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,606
Oh! Ohh!

94
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,971
Ray, hurry!

95
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,669
SISTER HELEN:
Excuse me,

96
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,304
but did anyone give you
permission to leave?

97
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,348
We're scared of mice.

98
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:50,848
Oh, well, you'll be happy to know
there aren't any, then.

99
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,442
And you can just trot yourselves
right back down there

100
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,453
and wait to be excused
like everyone else.

101
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,285
- Yes, sister.
- Yes, sister.

102
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,891
Hmph. Hmph.

103
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,395
Ptooh!

104
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,695
- (puppy whimpers)
- (Sister Helen gasps)

105
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,697
Huh.

106
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,465
(puppy barks softly)

107
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,335
(Sister Helen gasps)

108
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,075
(muttering)

109
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,812
- (puppy yaps)
- Ohh!

110
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,913
(muttering)

111
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,856
SAL: Janey, you have to promise
not to tattle.

112
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,592
ALL: Ohh! It's so cute!

113
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,393
Oh, it's true!
You do have a puppy!

114
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,866
JANEY:
What about Mother Agnes?

115
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,096
Sarah, you'd better
go watch the door.

116
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,039
Sal, you've been waiting your whole life
to get a puppy, haven't you?

117
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,236
I'm naming him Chestnut
'cause he's brown and little.

118
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,573
GIRL: He's so cute!

119
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,635
Where'd you get him?

120
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,942
He was in the bushes!

121
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,711
Sister Helen said
if we prayed and prayed...

122
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,447
She's coming!
Sister Helen's coming!

123
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,887
SISTER HELEN: Girls!
Girls, it's 8:00!

124
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,753
It's past your bedtime!

125
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,350
You don't want me to have to
get Mother Agnes up here, do you?

126
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,417
ALL: No.

127
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,621
SISTER HELEN:
That's what I thought.

128
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,254
Let's say a prayer for Chelsea.

129
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,031
Close your eyes.

130
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,930
Both of them.

131
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,573
Dear Lord,

132
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,577
our Chelsea has left
the orphanage today,

133
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,411
and we pray that she may find
great happiness in her new home.

134
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,608
Amen.

135
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,480
- GIRLS: Amen.
- RAY: Amen.

136
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,780
SISTER HELEN:
Good night, girls.

137
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,787
GIRLS: Good night,
Sister Helen.

138
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,288
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

139
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,149
Sal...

140
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,455
why does she always
have to say that?

141
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,722
I think she thinks it's funny.

142
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,589
(puppy yelps)

143
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,427
- Hello?
- (gasps)

144
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,765
(mimicking barking)

145
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,328
Woof! Woof!

146
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,670
(girls mimic barking)

147
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,538
Oh, now, hush.

148
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,636
Precious, aren't they, Lord?

149
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,292
Sal...

150
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,562
do you think God knew?

151
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,470
Sister Helen says
he hears everything.

152
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,235
Shh.

153
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,435
Sal...

154
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,536
it's dark tonight.

155
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,340
Sal?

156
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,046
Yes, you can get in my bed.

157
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,899
(dog whimpers softly)

158
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,230
What now, Ray?

159
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,402
I can't believe you finally got a dog.

160
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,380
I know. Me neither.

161
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:11,916
Sal...

162
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,975
Yes, Ray?

163
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,543
Good night.

164
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,645
Good night.

165
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,595
SAL: (giggling)
Ches!

166
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,604
(puppy yelps)

167
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,435
Okay, now, sit.

168
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,168
(yaps)

169
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,405
See? You're a smart little fellow.

170
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,572
I think maybe I can
teach you a few things.

171
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,912
Okay, now, lie down.

172
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,753
(giggling)
Ah, you silly fellow!

173
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,381
(bell tolling)

174
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,086
(bell tolling)

175
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,155
(Ray sobbing)

176
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,038
Sal, where did you go?

177
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,075
I took Chestnut out to the field.

178
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,610
Don't do that, Sal.

179
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,908
Don't go without me.

180
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,972
I didn't know where you were.

181
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,985
Don't worry. I'll never leave
without you, okay?

182
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,543
Okay?

183
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,660
(girls talking)

184
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,922
GIRLS: Uh-oh.

185
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,090
(quietly)
Mother Agnes?

186
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,258
She never comes to breakfast.

187
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,394
Sally Ann and Ray,
please stand up.

188
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,569
My office, now.

189
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,475
GIRL: What'd they do?
GIRL #2: I don't know.

190
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,513
Janey?

191
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,684
I didn't!
I didn't tell!

192
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,457
Pinky swear.

193
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,461
Now, I've brought
you both here because...

194
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,371
something very out of the ordinary
has happened here.

195
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,501
We know... but it's not Sal's fault.

196
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,340
I've been praying every night,

197
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,007
except for some nights
when I'm really tired,

198
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,550
for Sal to get a d...
Oww!

199
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,277
(Chestnut yapping softly)

200
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,325
(barks)

201
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,057
I'll get to the point.

202
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,865
You... two... sisters...

203
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,337
have been adopted.

204
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,474
You mean...

205
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,478
you found our mother?

206
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,672
Ray...

207
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,409
she means they found us
a home.

208
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,378
(yapping)

209
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,695
(barking softly)

210
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,699
The Tomleys,
who you've met several times,

211
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,201
have decided to adopt you both,

212
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,396
and you'll be moving to
their home in New York City.

213
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,100
A mom and a dad?

214
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,233
We never had both before.

215
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,938
MOTHER AGNES:
Well, you are two very lucky girls, then.

216
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,445
SAL: Mother Agnes?

217
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,845
MOTHER AGNES:
Yes, what is it?

218
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,110
SAL: I was wondering...

219
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,175
do people in New York City
have dogs?

220
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,550
Frogs?

221
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,452
Oh, my goodness gracious...

222
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,184
No, dogs.

223
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,352
D-O-G-S.

224
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,123
MOTHER AGNES:
Girls, have I not made it clear?

225
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,391
You are both going to a family.

226
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,026
That means there is a mother
and a father who have decided...

227
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,127
- Faint.
- What?

228
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,035
Pretend to faint.

229
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,472
What on earth does this
have to do with dogs?

230
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,607
Ohh!

231
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,571
Mother Agnes, Ray's fainted.
I'll get water.

232
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,774
Oh, my word! Ohh!

233
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,319
Ray? Oh, wake up, sweetie.

234
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,722
Wow. Thank you, Mother Agnes.
I feel much more better now.

235
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,625
Hmm.

236
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,596
- (splash)
- Oh!

237
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,496
Ugh! Ohh!

238
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,668
WOMAN: And Mrs. Bartlett,
this will be the girls' room.

239
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,464
They like to dance?

240
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,834
Oh, you know,
I-I don't really know.

241
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,814
I just know that I did
as a girl.

242
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,509
Says here they like animals.

243
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,849
Yes. I was thinking about
taking them to a pet store.

244
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,913
But we're going to buy them
each a fish.

245
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,355
Hmm?

246
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,690
My husband's allergic to animals...
cats... dogs...

247
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,956
Ones with hair?

248
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,657
Yeah.

249
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,303
Keep this in a secure spot.

250
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,532
It's the final piece
of documentation you need

251
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,370
for the adoption to become complete.

252
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,071
And remember to call me
when concerns come up.

253
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,445
Sometimes adjustment can be
very hard for orphans at this age.

254
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,848
Okay. Thank you.

255
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,408
Congratulations.

256
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,544
Thanks.

257
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,681
But you can't leave.

258
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,055
We'll miss you.

259
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,991
When you're adopted,
you have to go.

260
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,427
It's the law...

261
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,327
but you can come to visit.

262
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,025
What about Chestnut?

263
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,829
Are you gonna take him?

264
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,460
I'll figure out a way.

265
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,837
WOMAN:
Here's to Laura and her new life...

266
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,069
motherhood!

267
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,132
Whoo!

268
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,705
(heavy accent)
Motherhood! Motherhood!

269
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,908
Everybody, this is Rosamaria.

270
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,544
I just hired her to help me
with the apartment and with the girls,

271
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,884
and she's gonna go full time
when I come back after the New Year.

272
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,014
Wow. Welcome, Rosamaria.

273
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,319
She doesn't really speak English, so...

274
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,552
Oh, uh...

275
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,219
ROSAMARIA: Salud!
ALL: Salud!

276
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,024
MAN: See?
She understands me!

277
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,531
So, come on, tell us...
when's the big day?

278
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,067
Well, the social worker just gave us
our final documents,

279
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,035
and the girls are going
to come tomorrow!

280
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,196
ALL: Ohh!

281
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,103
Girls! Manana! Girls!

282
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,265
Girls!

283
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,535
(all laughing)

284
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,177
Sal...

285
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,422
Shh. He's sleeping again.

286
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,856
Sal, are you scared?

287
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,155
No.

288
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:44,635
Sal... what do
a mom and dad do, really?

289
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,771
Take kids to school...

290
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,747
make 'em food
and stuff like that.

291
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,216
That's it?

292
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,121
Will they kiss us?

293
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,089
(snickers)
No.

294
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,422
Janey said they will.

295
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,758
That's 'cause she's just
trying to scare you.

296
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,627
Sal...

297
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,658
Ray, it's time to go
to sleep now, okay?

298
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,829
Sal?

299
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,806
Yes?

300
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,775
We're going to be a family now.

301
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,399
TV ANNOUNCER: To Jamie Simons
with tonight's top story.

302
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,368
SIMONS: Last night's break-in
brings the total to

303
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,405
15 West Side apartments
that have been burglarized

304
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,906
in the last three months.

305
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,239
Mr. Trundle, owner of Trundle Properties,
is here with us now.

306
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,745
Mr. Trundle, what are your thoughts
on these burglars?

307
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,678
They've hit quite a few
of your buildings.

308
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,513
Well, I imagine it's
only natural for them to, uh,

309
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,780
target the finest buildings
in New York.

310
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,515
Honey?

311
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:04,988
Which one?

312
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,083
Oh, um... well, you know, honey,
I think either one will be fine.

313
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,525
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

314
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,496
No, you know, I think the blue one is
friendlier, you know? What do you think?

315
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,532
Wh-what do you think?

316
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,795
Yeah, I think you're right.
I think the blue one's friendlier. Thanks.

317
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,367
SIMONS: They appear to be
highly skilled thieves.

318
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,239
The media has nicknamed these criminals
the Central Park Robbers

319
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,742
because they seem to be targeting

320
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,177
exclusive apartment buildings
around the park,

321
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,579
and then using the park
as an escape route.

322
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,014
Mm-hmm.
They certainly do.

323
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,415
Make no mistake about it.

324
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,045
These criminals are
the lowest scum of society.

325
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,215
Hey, Uncle Wes, come here.

326
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,623
Who is this guy?
I mean, he doesn't like us.

327
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,490
They will be apprehended soon.

328
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,826
That is Thomas Trundle.

329
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,594
I've decided to offer
a $50,000 reward

330
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,068
for any information leading to
the capturing of these thugs.

331
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,503
Mr. Trundle is offering
a $50,000 reward...

332
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,565
Oh, no. Nobody puts
a bounty on my head.

333
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,874
No, we're gonna have to give him
a real reason not to like us.

334
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,107
Oh, yeah!
You show 'em, Uncle Wes!

335
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,448
From now on,
we only hit Trundle buildings.

336
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,681
Honey.

337
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,419
Maybe this is better
than the blue?

338
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,859
Oh, honey, that... that is...
that's the one.

339
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,397
You look...
you look stunning.

340
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,695
I have never been so nervous
in all my life.

341
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,927
What if they don't like us?

342
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,060
- Sweetheart...
- Ohh.

343
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,300
Relax. You're gonna be...
a wonderful mother.

344
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,928
Come on, girls!
Chop chop!

345
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,087
The Tomleys are here.

346
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,402
Don't forget to write us.

347
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,441
But we don't got stamps.

348
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,739
Come on, now.
Step lively, girls.

349
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,608
Hi.

350
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,708
Hey, Ray.

351
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,116
Hi, Sal.

352
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,087
Hi, Mrs. Tomley.

353
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,855
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Tomley.

354
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,189
(chuckles)

355
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,657
(laughs)
Oh, Matt.

356
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,030
(chuckles)

357
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,796
(whispers)
She kissed me!

358
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,098
Come here.

359
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,872
(laughing)

360
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,102
I knew I couldn't do this
without tears.

361
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,638
Well... well, thank you
very much, Mother Agnes.

362
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,773
You're welcome.

363
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,875
Yeah, so, you girls
ready to go?

364
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,044
All right.

365
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,520
Let me help you with these.
Thanks.

366
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,318
(Chestnut yelps softly)

367
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,019
And... and you'll hold on
to that one.

368
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,617
- Come on.
- Goodbye, girls.

369
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,185
- GIRLS: Bye!
- MOTHER AGNES: Goodbye, girls.

370
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,202
MOTHER AGNES:
Bye-bye, girls.

371
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,003
GIRLS: Bye, Sal!
Bye, Ray!

372
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,737
MATT: Thank you!

373
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,369
GIRL: Bye, Ray.
We'll miss you.

374
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,355
NO SECRETS:
(music) Nah-nah (music)

375
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,619
(music) Nah-nah (music)

376
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,788
(music) Nah-nah nah-nah
nah-nah (music)

377
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,957
(music) Nah-nah nah-nah (music)

378
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:39,231
(music) Here I am, here I am,
here I am (music)

379
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,671
(music) Isn't it crazy? (music)

380
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,038
(music) Isn't it wild? (music)

381
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,339
(music) Here I am (music)

382
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,242
Oh, Sal, look.

383
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,151
Can we show them?

384
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,779
- Show them what?
- Ches.

385
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,015
They have to get to know us first.

386
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,457
Ah-choo!

387
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,120
Matt, you've been sneezing
the whole way home.

388
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,959
Matt has allergies.

389
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,932
Actually,
he's allergic to animals,

390
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,265
but the worst ones of all
are cats and dogs.

391
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,203
(Laura chuckles)

392
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,763
It's the dander, I think.

393
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,903
MAN: Hey, have a little
respect, here! Take it easy!

394
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,038
Not today, fellas.

395
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,707
Ah-choo!

396
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,148
MATT: Man!

397
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,584
Is that the President?

398
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,088
No, sweetie, that's Mr. Trundle.
He owns the building.

399
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,215
Yeah, and lots of buildings
in downtown New York,

400
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,384
including the tallest building.

401
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,448
Ah-choo!

402
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,922
And that's Marty.

403
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,258
- Hello, Mrs. T.
- Hey, Marty.

404
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,324
Hey.

405
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,764
Hey, there!

406
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,601
MATT: Ah-choo!

407
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,905
LAURA: Marty, this is Ray and Sal,
our girls we were telling you about.

408
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,343
Hey! Welcome
to the Big Apple, girls.

409
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,608
Can I take your bags for you,
little one?

410
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,843
BOTH: No, thanks.

411
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,975
Okay.

412
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,485
Sorry about the commotion,
Mr. Tomley.

413
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,113
There was another robbery
at one of Trundle's buildings last night.

414
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,816
They wanted to interview him again.

415
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,156
No dogs allowed?

416
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,989
LAURA: Thanks.

417
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,466
RAY: Ohh!

418
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,839
(soft yelp)

419
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,436
RAY: Sal, look at this place!

420
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,855
LAURA: Ooh!
It's okay. Come in.

421
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,462
Ah-choo!

422
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,675
LAURA:
Welcome to your new home.

423
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,841
It's "gi-normous"!

424
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,011
Ah-choo!

425
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,147
Where's he gonna go?

426
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,776
- Ah-choo!
- Oh, honey.

427
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:08,911
I know.

428
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:13,048
Well, um... why don't I
show you your room?

429
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,392
(gasps)

430
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,171
So... what do you think?

431
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,681
This is our room?

432
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,045
Mm-hmm.

433
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,584
We can change the color,
if you'd like.

434
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,052
(music box plays)

435
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,419
No. This color's nice.

436
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,389
Oh! I forgot!

437
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,590
The best feature
of the whole apartment...

438
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,926
your very own balcony.

439
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,162
Whoa!

440
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,910
Sal! A place to poop!

441
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,914
Yeah!
(laughs)

442
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,278
Um...

443
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,718
no, your bathroom is over here.

444
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,919
(gasps)

445
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,662
(gasps)

446
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,224
(Ray giggles)

447
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,791
Your bathroom.

448
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,734
Oh. One last thing.

449
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,896
Follow me.

450
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,510
And this is your closet.

451
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,913
A room just for clothes?

452
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,075
Mm-hmm.

453
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,176
But we don't have
that many clothes.

454
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,515
One drawer each is enough.

455
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,853
Oh, no, I went out, I bought you
some clothes and some pajamas

456
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,416
that you could wear
until we have time to go shopping.

457
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,028
So...

458
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,869
What's our schedule?

459
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,097
Schedule?

460
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,663
For dishes, laundry, and stuff.

461
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,301
Oh, no, no.
You don't have a schedule.

462
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,436
This is your home now,

463
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,105
so, um, I'll do the laundry,

464
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,877
and we can just do
the dishes together, okay?

465
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,939
Oh.

466
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,285
Well, uh, you girls
have had a long day,

467
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,515
so... ahem... why don 't you
get settled,

468
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,149
and, uh... we'll be outside
if you need anything.

469
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,624
Okay?

470
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:30,783
All right, then.

471
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,865
(Chestnut whimpers)

472
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,809
Sal, we've gotta stay.

473
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,438
I know it's nice, but...

474
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,004
we can't stay.

475
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,344
There's no dogs allowed.

476
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,409
Sal, please can we stay?

477
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,025
(girls giggling)

478
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,757
- They sound so happy.
- (Matt chuckles)

479
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,353
That's a lot of soap, Sal.

480
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,367
Well, if we're gonna stay,
he has to be clean.

481
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,370
It's the dander that makes
Mr. Tomley sneeze.

482
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:17,534
Really? You mean it, Sal?
We can stay?

483
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,203
Yeah. I think he likes it here.

484
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,419
I hope this fits.

485
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,080
Well, you know, don't worry.
I'm sure she'll grow into it.

486
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,683
So, hows your design coming?

487
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,024
Oh, it's good. I've just...
I've got to get these plans done

488
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,030
so the model can get started.

489
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,793
(girls giggling)

490
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,096
Oh! He has a mustache, Sal!

491
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,104
Ooh, he smells good.

492
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,701
That's where Trundle lives.

493
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,440
In the penthouse, of course.

494
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:58,948
Let's hit it tonight, huh, Uncle Wes?
Come on, let's hit it. Can we hit it?

495
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,882
Kosh, patience! Caution!

496
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,921
Nah. The penthouse is gonna
require a little bit of planning.

497
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,549
It'll have high-tech security systems,
private entrance.

498
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,718
Nah, we're gonna have to do
our homework on this one.

499
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,125
- Right.
- We'll get to it...

500
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,221
but not till we're good and ready.

501
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,735
(girls giggling)

502
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,132
(girls giggling)

503
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,107
- Maybe I should go tuck 'em in.
- I think you should.

504
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,862
Who is it?

505
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,766
L-it's Laura.

506
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,498
Laura who?

507
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,439
The Mrs. Tomley Laura.

508
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,302
Oh!

509
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,777
Uh, come in.

510
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,842
Hi.

511
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,650
Just... just making sure
everything's okay in here.

512
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,123
Yeah. Everything's fine.

513
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,887
I sure am tired.

514
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,730
Well, um, you just come wake us
if you need anything.

515
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,358
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

516
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,997
Okay, girls.
Good night.

517
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,371
(sighs heavily)

518
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,845
- (Chestnut whimpers softly)
- (door opens)

519
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,077
- (Sal gasps)
- The light.

520
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,412
Good night.

521
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,751
(Chestnut whimpers softly)

522
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,381
(relieved sigh)

523
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,452
SAL: Ow.

524
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,263
Ray, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

525
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,862
It's the same as the day,
just... darker.

526
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,873
Well, I don't know that yet, Sal.

527
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,334
Okay. Good night.

528
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,039
RAY: Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

529
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,442
WOMAN: How are ya?

530
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,776
LAURA: Girls!

531
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:17,844
SAL: Coming!

532
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,721
Okay, Chestnut, you be good.

533
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,954
You stay here
until we get back, okay?

534
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,724
RAY: And maybe
we'll bring you a treat. Bye.

535
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,028
(girls giggling)

536
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,538
LAURA: Mrs. Bartlett said
that they're gonna want

537
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,479
to create their own space.

538
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,450
She said it was part of
their acclimatization period.

539
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,646
Yeah, see, I don't think
it's a problem.

540
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,485
I think we just give them
what they need.

541
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,923
(girls giggling)

542
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,600
(footsteps resounding)

543
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:10,300
Hellooooo!

544
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,501
BOTH: Helloooo!

545
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,605
(laughing)

546
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,461
Sal, my boot!

547
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,524
Don't worry, I'll get it.

548
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,220
Oh, no!

549
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,992
Don't worry.
We'll get you another pair.

550
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,226
But, Sal...!

551
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,495
Mom didn't just wear boots, Ray.

552
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,003
She only wore them when
she worked with the horses.

553
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:16,762
RAY: Eww.

554
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,859
That was delicious.
May I have another?

555
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,591
Uh, well, sure.
Sure you can.

556
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,758
One more, please.

557
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,901
I don't see him, Sal!

558
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,374
I think he's gone.

559
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,778
SAL: (laughing)
Oh, Chestnut!

560
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,839
You are here.

561
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:03,749
- (knock at door)
- LAURA: Girls!

562
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,621
RAY: Uh... um...

563
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,719
Just a minute!

564
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,392
Um, you can come in now.

565
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,131
Oh, hey, girls.
Um, I was thinking tomorrow...

566
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,266
Wow! Looks like you girls
have a lot of laundry you need done.

567
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,107
- Why don't I take that...
- No! No, no, no, no!

568
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,340
SAL: We like to do
our own laundry.

569
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,973
Yes, we'll do it.

570
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,075
No, that's okay.
I don't mind.

571
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,949
No! No, no, no, no!

572
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,647
SAL: It's fine, really.

573
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,121
We love to do our own laundry.

574
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,249
We love. We love. Mm-hmm.

575
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,590
Oh. Okay.

576
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,789
Um, tomorrow, um,
I was thinking

577
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,129
that I could introduce you girls
to New York.

578
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,797
Great.

579
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,472
(whimpers softly)

580
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,179
KOSH: It's hot! It's hot!

581
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,721
- KOSH: Hey, hey, hey!
- DRIVER: Watch it, there, buddy!

582
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,314
WOMAN: Last night,
the Central Park Robbers struck again,

583
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:18,294
and police believe they may have used
this very path where I stand now.

584
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,921
The girls already eat?

585
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,263
Well, they came and took
a box of Cheerios,

586
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,996
but I guess they wanted
to eat them in their room alone.

587
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,300
Ah-choo! Man!

588
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,637
Wow! Your allergies
have really come back.

589
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,869
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go see
Dr. Martin later.

590
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,343
(laughs)

591
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,150
Okay.
(chuckles)

592
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,548
(Sal giggles)

593
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,322
Girls, are you ready?

594
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,368
SAL: Chestnut, we'll be back.
You be good.

595
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,426
(giggling)

596
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:11,876
LAURA: Okay! Ready?

597
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,643
Las ninas!

598
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,483
LAURA: Rosamaria!

599
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,820
Girls, this is Rosamaria,
the lady I was telling you about.

600
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,486
Rosamaria,
this is Ray and this is Sal.

601
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,550
Okay!

602
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,618
Let's go, girls.

603
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,561
New York City awaits us.

604
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,621
Bye!

605
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,832
(blows whistle)

606
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,610
Unh-unh!

607
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,592
(humming softly)

608
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,105
Ah-ah-ah-choo!

609
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,231
Aw, gee, I'm sorry.

610
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,298
Whoa!

611
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,313
(indistinct chatter)

612
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,619
SAL: Hi! Hi, everybody!

613
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,317
Girls!

614
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,757
(growling)

615
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,463
Ohh!

616
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,641
Ratas!

617
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,167
LAURA: Hello?

618
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,941
Oh, you are such a cutie!

619
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,247
(excited chattering)

620
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,522
(sniffing)

621
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,687
Hmm!

622
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,263
Ohh! Rats!

623
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,166
(snap)

624
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,303
(gasp)

625
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:30,345
Ay!

626
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,752
Welcome home, ladies.
Long day?

627
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:37,816
Oh, yes.

628
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,229
Rosamaria, hi!

629
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,668
Ay!

630
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:51,731
(speaking Spanish)

631
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,539
Rat! Rat! Ay!

632
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,137
(speaking Spanish)

633
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,910
Rats?

634
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,072
Rats?

635
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,223
I don't know about you girls,
but I'm tired.

636
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,420
SAL: Oh, no.

637
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,087
What's the matter, sweetie?

638
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,654
I have to use the toilet.

639
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,827
Me too.

640
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:24,964
'Kay.

641
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,072
(Chestnut yaps softly)

642
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,133
SAL: Ches!

643
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,017
(barks softly)

644
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,736
(growls)

645
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,598
(barks)

646
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,573
(yaps)

647
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,819
Hmm?

648
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,452
Sal!

649
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,859
Where's Ches?

650
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,501
(snoring)

651
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,985
(mumbling)
What was that?

652
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,729
Sal... what are you doing?

653
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,137
Um... uh...

654
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,809
Hmm.

655
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,072
Well...

656
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,419
Well, I guess this is also part of
the acclimatization period

657
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,047
Mrs. Bartlett was talking about.

658
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,352
Ah-choo!

659
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,897
He's gonna have to
stay out here now.

660
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,865
RAY: Okay.

661
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,367
(barks)

662
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,371
Exercise'll help, too.

663
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,738
I heard about the cockroach
in your kitchen.

664
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,276
What's up with that?
A cockroach in New York?

665
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,609
MARTY: Listen,
I'll take care of it, I promise.

666
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,182
SAL: The coast is clear.

667
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,912
NIKKI CLEARY:
(music) Once upon a time (music)

668
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:31,121
(music) Two, two hearts
felt the same way (music)

669
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:34,926
(music) But three, three,
three nights ago (music)

670
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,765
(music) You told me
you don't know which way (music)

671
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,770
(music) Which way you're gonna go (music)

672
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,739
(music) Oh, truth ain't easy (music)

673
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,299
(music) But please, please, please me (music)

674
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,177
(music) It's time you made up your mind (music)

675
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,408
Sal and Ray wrote us!
They wrote us!

676
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:55,850
(music) One, two, three (music)

677
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,945
(music) You're falling in love with me (music)

678
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,389
(music) I'm falling into your life (music)

679
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,654
- (music) Faster than the speed of light (music)
- Ah-choo!

680
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,627
(music) Then one, two, three (music)

681
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,823
- Ah-choo!
- (music) You don't want to hear from me (music)

682
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,958
(music) But if we can't be like before (music)

683
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,559
- (music) Tell me, then, what... (music)
- Honey?

684
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,400
(music)... love is for (music)

685
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,806
(music) One, two, three (music)

686
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,864
Trick or treat!

687
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,433
Well, hello!

688
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,446
(music) But if we can't be like before (music)

689
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:27,507
(music) Tell me what,
oh, what love is for (music)

690
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,842
Ahh!

691
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,287
(music) Tell me, can we keep
this love alive? (music)

692
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,917
(music) Will we ever? (music)

693
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,757
SAL and RAY:
9-Mississippi, 10-Mississippi.

694
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,026
Ready or not, here we come!

695
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,532

(music) One, two, three (music)

700
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,538
(music) You don't wanna hear from me (music)

701
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,047
(music) No, no, baby (music)

702
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,640
He's getting pretty big, Sal.

703
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,879
(music) Tell me what love is for (music)

704
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,386
RAY: Oh, wow!

705
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,185
(music) You're falling in love with me (music)

706
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,455

LAURA: Bye, Rosamaria!

709
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,364
We'll be back soon!

710
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,604
Hmm?
(speaking Spanish)

711
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,728
Hmm.

712
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:29,966
Hmm.

713
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,076
- (Chestnut barks)
- Aah! No! No!

714
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,946
No! No!
Please! Please!

715
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,579
Aah! No! No!

716
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,759
MARTY: Ohh!

717
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:56,925
Is there anything left?

718
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,265
RAY: Not if you were planning
to get dresses.

719
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,894
LAURA: School uniforms.

720
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,461
MARTY: You girls
are startin' school.

721
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,166
'Fraid so.
The time has come.

722
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,265
Thanks, Marty.

723
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:09,903
Hi, Rosamaria!

724
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,277
Missy!

725
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,747
LAURA: Hi, we're back!

726
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,013
Listen, girls, I have to go
to work for a little while,

727
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,646
so Rosamaria's
going to give you dinner, okay?

728
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,952
So, I'll be back later.
Have fun. Bye!

729
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,014
Aah!

730
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,923
Ay, ninas!

731
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,983
Help!

732
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,689
- RAY: Oh, no!
- Ninas, help!

733
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,959
- Rosa?
- Ches?

734
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,596
SAL: Ray, turn it off.

735
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,499
- RAY: Uh-oh.
- SAL: Wrong way!

736
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,469
Ninas!

737
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,976
No!

738
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,681
Ches!

739
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,049
Oh, it's all right, Rosamaria.

740
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,610
He's very friendly.

741
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,156
Yeah, he doesn't bite.

742
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,690
His name's Chestnut.

743
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,322
(Spanish accent)
Cheese-newt?

744
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,066
Rosamaria, we...

745
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,231
go to school.

746
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,901
Ah, escuela.

747
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,377
And he... needs to go...

748
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,881
to the park.

749
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,143
Park?

750
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,582
To poop!

751
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,983
Oh, poop!

752
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,681
Yeah. Poop in the park.

753
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,246
Oh, poop!

754
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,723
But... nooooo...

755
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,030
dogs... allowed.

756
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,560
RAY: (playing)
Hey, let me out!

757
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,969
Ohh!

758
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,069
I have one thing to say.

759
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,305
Air holes!

760
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,213
You see,
we couldn't leave him behind.

761
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:57,742
Mother Agnes would never let him
stay at the orphanage,

762
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,450
and Sal has been waiting
her whole entire life to get a puppy.

763
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,193
ROSAMARIA:
Shh shh shh.

764
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,863
Hello, missy!

765
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,373
I'm gonna be there around two.
I'm in here!

766
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,806
- Hello, missy.
- Hi.

767
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,282
(speaking Spanish)

768
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,319
Can you hold on one second?

769
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,116
(speaking Spanish excitedly)

770
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,816
You went to Central Park!

771
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,758
Um, yeah.
We went to the park today,

772
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,921
and, um, we all played chase.

773
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,160
Rosa's fast, and we couldn't
catch up to her.

774
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,564
Ay, si, senora.

775
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,331
(speaking Spanish)

776
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,639
...woof woof!

777
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,073
(quietly)
Woof woof?

778
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,611
How you see, uh,
Cheese-newt?

779
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,647
SAL: She's trying to
tell you that, um...

780
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,813
we saw so many dogs...
that's 'woof woof'...

781
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,511
at the park today,

782
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,646
and on the way back,
um, she bought us some chestnuts.

783
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,451
Si, missy.
Chestnuts.

784
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,650
SAL: Some chestnuts.

785
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,252
Ay, ay!
Late, late, late, late!

786
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,853
Bye-bye! Bye!

787
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,330
Bye!

788
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,198
Mmm!

789
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,965
(Ray giggles)

790
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,269
NO SECRETS:
(music) You ask me why (music)

791
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,641
(music) I changed the color of my hair (music)

792
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,805
(music) Yeah (music)

793
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:36,546

00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,850

795
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,014
Ah-choo!

797
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,127
(music) It's just a chick thing (music)

798
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,561

800
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,861
RAY: Ches!
SAL: Chestnut, no!

801
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,459
SAL: Chestnut, stop!
RAY: Ches!

802
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,734
(music) That's what girls do (music)

803
00:47:56,807 --> 00:48:00,299
(music) Gotta keep you guessing
the whole day through (music)

804
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,777

805
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:06,145

00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,538
(music) Why should I change? (music)

814
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,099
RAY:
(music) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (music)

815
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,270
NO SECRETS:
(music) I'm having too much fun (music)

816
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,405
(music) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (music)

817
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:40,074
(music) To you, it's confusing (music)

818
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,916

(barking)

826
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,234
Good!

827
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,579
(laughing)

828
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,642
SAL: Ches!

829
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,120
I think we're feeding him too much.

830
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,499
(garbage can crashes)

831
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:33,558

832
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,626
WES: Shh! Shh!

833
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,707
WES: Okay, give me
the grappling gun.

834
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,109
Stand back.

835
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,186
KOSH: Bingo.
Hey, it's fun.

836
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,588
It's like that spider guy.

837
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,524
(low growl)

838
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,766
WES: Get your knee off my leg,
you klutz!

839
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,598
- Get off of me!
- Ohh!

840
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,829
Okay.

841
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,534
Ohh! Shh... shh!

842
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,305
(drafting table squeaks)

843
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,779
KOSH:
I got it, I got it.

844
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,940
Stop it!

845
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,782

00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,384
- WES: Nice doggie.
- KOSH: Just us, pup!

849
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,123
We don't want to hurt you.

850
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,391
Aah!

851
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,625
Wes, I'm sorry!

852
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:39,128
- SAL: Ches?
- WES: Get me outta here!

853
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:46,708
Uh...! Uh...!
Easy, easy!

854
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,404
(loud crash)

855
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,208
(gasps)
The girls!

856
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,146
- (Chestnut growls)
- KOSH: Aah!

857
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,741
Ohh! Oh!

858
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,979
Let... go!

859
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:07,226
WES and KOSH: Whoooaaa!

860
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,060
Ches!

861
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,667
MATT: Sal! Ray!

862
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,836
Oh, no.

863
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,072
MATT: Ray.

864
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,286
Oh, no.

865
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:38,384
It wasn't Ray that did this.

866
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,589
See, we have this...

867
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:41,653
No!

868
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,131
It was me.

869
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,691
I did do it, Ray.

870
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,464
I did, Sal.

871
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,438
I was trying to get a pencil,
and I felled.

872
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,240
Oh, sweetie, why?
What's wrong?

873
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,943
MATT: Ah-choo!

874
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,284
- (Wes coughing)
- (alley cat yowls)

875
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:07,255
WES: What happened?
What happened?

876
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,292
KOSH:
There was a dog!

877
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,261
I will, thank you.
Thanks for your help.

878
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,922
Okay. Bye.

879
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,257
Hey, how are they?

880
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:18,926
They're finally sleeping.

881
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:20,060
Was that Mrs. Bartlett?

882
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,129
Yeah. Her take on it
is to just give them time.

883
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,266
She thinks it's good
we're starting them in school.

884
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,935
She thinks the regime will help.

885
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,603
Yeah, well,
she's probably right.

886
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,112
It's gonna be fine.

887
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,953
Oh, Cheese-newt,
I love you!

888
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,623
(barking)

889
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,134
(music) Why did I wait for so long (music)

890
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,362
GIRLS: Chestnut!

891
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,063
(music) To change my mind? (music)

892
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,196
GIRLS: Chestnut, stop!

893
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:01,267
(music) I was afraid to move you (music)

894
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,336
(giggling)

895
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:08,009
(music) So much more than I deserve (music)

896
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:12,953
(music) Is everything you've given me (music)

897
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:17,460
- (music) You will never let me go (music)
- ROSAMARIA: Girls! Girls!

898
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,825
Hmm? Hmm?!

899
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,864
SAL: Wait! No! Ches, stop!

900
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,366
I'm getting mad at you, Ches!

901
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,868
Stooooooop!

902
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,063
No, no, no!

903
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,972
How many doctors does it take?

904
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,509
One... two...

905
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,977
- Come on, Ches!
- Girls, play!

906
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,172
RAY: Ches!

907
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,807
ROSAMARIA:
Oh, Cheese-newt, you so funny.

908
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,419
(music) You are forever the same (music)

909
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,752
(music) You will never change (music)

910
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,019
Cheese-newt!

911
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,822
Yo comiste mi helado!

912
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,522
(girls laugh)

913
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,292
Ohh! Ohh!

914
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,267
(music) Where would I be
without you? (music)

915
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,861
(music) What would I do? (music)

916
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,571
(music) My life was so... (music)

917
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,008
- (Sal laughing)
- RAY: Whoa, Ches!

918
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,443
(music) I found you (music)

919
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:10,911
(both chuckling)

920
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:15,008
(music) So much more than I deserve (music)

921
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,450
Ches!

922
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,545
(music) Everything you did for me (music)

923
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:24,253
(music) You will never let me go (music)

924
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,454
Cinderella,

925
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,429
dressed in yellow...

926
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,093
(Rosamaria laughs)

927
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,434
Now I know we're
feeding him too much.

928
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,367
Do we have to tell 'em, Sal?

929
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,275
It's time.

930
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,177
- Tonight at dinner.
- Okay.

931
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,148
Hey, girls!

932
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,052
Mom, look at what I made you!

933
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,112
Wow!

934
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,786
I mean... um... Mrs...

935
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,557
No, no, no.
That's okay.

936
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,429
You can call me Mom.
In fact, I would feel honored.

937
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,559
Let's see.
Let's put it on.

938
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,401
Perfect.

939
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,065
Ohh!

940
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,406
Thank you!
All right, let's go home.

941
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,573
- WOMAN: Place for the town car.
- MAN: Oh, no. Move it.

942
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,681
MARTY: Most of the guests have
arrived, sir, including the mayor.

943
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,345
They await you inside.

944
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,946
Thank you.

945
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,354
Madame.

946
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,359
(whispering) All right, now,
once all the guests have settled in,

947
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,361
we sneak up
to Trundle's penthouse.

948
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,865
He'll be busy at the wedding,
and we'll own the place.

949
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,422
Literally.
Here he comes.

950
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,531
- Mr. Trundle!
- (mutters angrily)

951
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,866
What?

952
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,874
WES: (whispering)
All right, he's in. Let's go.

953
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,444
SAL:
Do you like surprises?

954
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,105
LAURA:
Yeah, I love surprises.

955
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,446
RAY: Really big surprises?

956
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,075
LAURA:
Yeah, absolutely.

957
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,383
SAL: Good, 'cause we have
a surprise for you after dinner.

958
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,890
- (Chestnut growls softly)
- Shh, Cheese-newt.

959
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,448
Shh!

960
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,824
Ohh! Party?

961
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,522
MARTY:
Yes, Rosamaria.

962
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,122
Mr. Trundle's one and only niece
got married today.

963
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,226
We're hosting the reception for her
here at the Maverick.

964
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,635
Oh, look, girls,
it's Rosamaria!

965
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,696
And she has your Halloween costume.

966
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:18,866
Shh! Ches!

967
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,842
(barks)

968
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,377
Surprise!
Oh, no!

969
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:23,605
WES: Come on, Kosh!
Move it!

970
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,307
Oh, no!

971
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,680
(guests chattering)

972
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,584
Whoa! Look out!

973
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,644
- Huh?
- Ohh!

974
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,087
GIRLS: Ches, stop!

975
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,159
SAL: Wait! Ches!

976
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,533
RAY: Oh, I'm sorry!

977
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,231
- LAURA: Oh, no!
- RAY: Ches!

978
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,865
(Chestnut barking)

979
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,909
- No!
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

980
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,239
Ay!

981
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:56,573
Aah!

982
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,079
MAN:
For Pete's sakes!

983
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,044
- MAN: Aah!
- KOSH: Sorry!

984
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,087
WES: Look out! Look out!
Go, go, go, go, go!

985
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,419
- (barking)
- MAN: Stop that dog!

986
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,388
GIRLS: Ches, come back here!
Ches! Come on!

987
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,959
- SAL: Ches, no!
- WES: Come on!

988
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,296
Ohh, my cake!

989
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,361
- Ohh!
- RAY: Sorry!

990
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,272
Marty, grab that dog!

991
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,372
MARTY: Got him!

992
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,810
GIRLS: Sorry!

993
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,073
- SAL: Chestnut!
- RAY: Ches!

994
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:33,638
WES: Hurry up!

995
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,047
Let's go!

996
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,779
Marty, what's
the meaning of this?

997
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:37,877
W-well, I...

998
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,252
Get this dog out of here now!

999
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,315
(bride weeping)

1000
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,658
Ohh, my wedding!

1001
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,393
(weeping)

1002
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:55,097
ROSAMARIA: (crying)
Ohh!

1003
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:59,301
"Huge-mongous" mess!

1004
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,603
Hey.

1005
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,701
Ah-choo!

1006
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,805
Ah-choo!

1007
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,414
Yeah.

1008
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,717
WES: That was close.
Dumb mutt almost ruined it for us!

1009
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,779
Dumb mutt!

1010
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,223
All right. We give it another day,

1011
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,194
we come back tomorrow night
after Trundle's gone to sleep.

1012
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,231
So, um...

1013
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,232
let me...
let me get this straight.

1014
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,791
This... this dog...

1015
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,328
has been living here since...
since you girls arrived?

1016
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,110
Yeah.

1017
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,844
Ah-choo!
Excuse me.

1018
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:43,545
Look, Mr. Tomley,
dogs are definitely not permitted,

1019
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,180
in this or any of my buildings,
for that matter.

1020
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:49,657
Either this... this beast is out of here
by tomorrow morning,

1021
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,320
or all of you had better find
another place to live.

1022
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,454
- Am I clear?
- Mr. Trundle.

1023
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,657
No exceptions.

1024
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,394
It's the dog or you, Mr. Tomley.

1025
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,195
Ah-choo!

1026
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,719
(girls crying)

1027
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,721
I'm sure that we can find someone

1028
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:22,656
who would be very kind
and very loving towards Ches.

1029
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,431
But this is Sal's dog.

1030
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:32,400
He's not supposed to live
with somebody else.

1031
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,559
LAURA: Sweetie...

1032
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,406
I don't know what to say.

1033
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,152
(door closes)

1034
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,031
(chuckles)

1035
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,339
Laura, we have to find
a different solution.

1036
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,782
Like it or not,
he's part of the family now,

1037
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,446
and we have to, uh,
we have to stick together.

1038
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,216
He's gotta...
he's gotta stay.

1039
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,314
Oh, Matt.

1040
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,325
But, hey, look,
keeping those girls happy

1041
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,486
is more important
than keeping this apartment, right?

1042
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:35,463
I mean, besides,
there's always other apartments.

1043
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,795
- What about your allergies?
- Oh, it's not the end of the world.

1044
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,028
I'm sure there's...
there's something I can take.

1045
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,468
At least now we know what it is.

1046
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,562
(laughing)

1047
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,902
Okay. We'll tell them
in the morning.

1048
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,464
MATT: Okay.

1049
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,171
That is the biggest dog
I have ever seen!

1050
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,858
(quietly)
Come on, Ches, come on.

1051
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,195
Sal?

1052
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,699
She's gone!
She's gone without me!

1053
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,865
Sal?

1054
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,581
We don't know when she left.

1055
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,850
Our doorman Marty
said he didn't see her,

1056
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,085
and he started work around 7:30.

1057
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,320
Don't worry, Mrs. Tomley.
We'll find her.

1058
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,561
Thank you, Detective Benneson.
I'll... I'll see you out.

1059
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,397
Excuse me, have you
seen this little girl?

1060
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,010
I'm talkin' to everyone that walks by,
spreadin' the word.

1061
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,012
- We'll find her.
- Thank you, Marty.

1062
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:37,116
- LAURA: Sal! Sal!
- RAY: Ches! Chestnut!

1063
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:39,950
ROSAMARIA: Cheese-newt!

1064
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,368
ALL: Sal!

1065
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,137
RAY: Chestnut!

1066
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,377
ROSAMARIA:
Cheese-newt!

1067
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,943
MATT: Sal?

1068
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,513
Sal?

1069
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,086
Sal, it's okay.

1070
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,321
Sal?

1071
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:27,658
Sal!

1072
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,471
All right.

1073
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,405
Focus on the south end
of the park.

1074
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,238
All right. Okay.
Call me back.

1075
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,300
Thanks.

1076
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:41,309
Another robbery?

1077
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,113
Not this time.

1078
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,620
The dog and the little girl
run away this morning.

1079
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,280
I hope they've learnt their lesson.

1080
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,213
Here.

1081
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,691
No, thank you.

1082
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:54,618
Mr. Trundle.

1083
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:55,959
Hmm?

1084
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:58,466
After 22 years of service,

1085
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,799
tonight will be my last night
working at the Maverick.

1086
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,339
Look, if you need a raise,
Marty, let's discuss that tomorrow.

1087
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:07,001
Mr. Trundle, this is about
much more than a raise.

1088
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,208
Have a good evening.

1089
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,907
Right.

1090
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,610
(door sticks)

1091
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:26,018
JULIE THIEL:
(music) Don't see any rainbow (music)

1092
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:31,431
(music) All I see is raindrops fallin' (music)

1093
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,233
(music) Don't see any moonlight (music)

1094
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:40,401
(music) All I see is darkness fallin' (music)

1095
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:44,537
(music) I don't wanna be here (music)

1096
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:51,315
(music) And I don't want a lifetime
here without you (music)

1097
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:05,232
(music) Don't hear any children (music)

1098
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:09,397
(music) All I hear is mothers callin' (music)

1099
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:12,908
(music) Suddenly, there's silence (music)

1100
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,636
LAURA: No, it's been...
it's been all day.

1101
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,476
(music) Everything is slowly fallin' (music)

1102
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:22,244
(music) I don't wanna be here (music)

1103
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:29,224
(music) And I don't want a lifetime
here without you (music)

1104
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:34,594
(music) I can't sit and watch you go (music)

1105
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:39,761
(music) Isn't there a prayer
we all know? (music)

1106
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,099
(music) I can't bear to look (music)

1107
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:46,437
(music) Into your eyes (music)

1108
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,943
(music) Now (music)

1109
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:54,942
(music) I don't wanna lose you (music)

1110
01:05:55,017 --> 01:06:01,388
(music) And I don't want to
lose you now (music)

1111
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:06,724
(music) I can't sit and watch you go (music)

1112
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:11,256
(music) Isn't there a prayer
we all know (music)

1113
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,825
(music) I can't bear to look (music)

1114
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:17,566
(music) Into your eyes (music)

1115
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,631
(music) Now (music)

1116
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,441
(horse hoof beats approach)

1117
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,720
(quietly)
It's just darkness.

1118
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,783
It's just darkness.

1119
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,134
(voice resounds)
Sal!

1120
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,744
Sal?

1121
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,253
It's... it's me.
It's me, Ray.

1122
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:46,087
Sal!

1123
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,223
They said we could keep him!

1124
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,326
They said we could keep Ches.

1125
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,103
Sal...

1126
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,006
I'm wearing the shoes.

1127
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,936
Real shoes.

1128
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,881
(Ray cries)

1129
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:13,080
Sal, you can't go without me!

1130
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:15,646
You're my sister!

1131
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,331
(horse whinnies)

1132
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,628
(Sal gasps)

1133
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,074
Hello?

1134
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:10,671
Oh, no!

1135
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,773
Ches, they found us!

1136
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,414
Ches, you've gotta run.

1137
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,186
Chestnut, run.

1138
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,122
You gotta get out of here!

1139
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,460
You... you want it?

1140
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,022
Wanna play?

1141
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,298
Go get it.
Go get it, boy.

1142
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:42,605
Sal?

1143
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,044
Sal Tomley, is that you?

1144
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,439
Well, I'll be.

1145
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,883
I know some people who will be
very happy to see you.

1146
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,330
Now, let's get you home.

1147
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,681
Don't forget the flashlight.

1148
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,739
Got it.

1149
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:23,807
Mnh.

1150
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:30,058
Kosh, my boy,
this plan is foolproof.

1151
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,758
Sal, you're back!

1152
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,820
LAURA: Oh, sweetie.

1153
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,160
Are you okay?

1154
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,202
But where's Ches?

1155
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,364
They said we could keep him!

1156
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,431
I told him to go.

1157
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:49,636
I thought they were gonna
take him away.

1158
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,701
He's gone.

1159
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,542
They'll find him, Sal.
They'll find him.

1160
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,242
I have to go look, too.

1161
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:56,216
It's really, really late.
It's gonna be okay.

1162
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:59,584
You need to stay home
and rest, okay?

1163
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,589
Come on, sweetie.

1164
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,146
They'll find him.

1165
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,663
(whimpers)

1166
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,327
Amen.

1167
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,109
Will he come home, Sal?

1168
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:44,665
KOSH: Slow down.

1169
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,928
WES: Will you
pick your feet up?

1170
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,935
(growls)

1171
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:55,636
I tell ya, Kosh, this could be
the biggest night of my career.

1172
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:59,670
Whoa! And I get to be right here
with you, hey, Uncle Wes?

1173
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,148
That's not very comforting, Kosh.

1174
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,151
(low whimper)

1175
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:11,259
- (laughing)
- KOSH: So good!

1176
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:14,057
- (cat yowls)
- WES: Kosh, get out of there!

1177
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,790
The camera's on a cycle.

1178
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,764
- KOSH: All right.
- WES: Now!

1179
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,207
- (dog growls)
- WES: Come on!

1180
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,301
(growling continues)

1181
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:33,338
- All right, screwdriver.
- Driver.

1182
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,517
All right. Snips.

1183
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,509
Snips.

1184
01:12:41,123 --> 01:12:42,454
Wrong way.

1185
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:43,616
Red.

1186
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,717
- Okay, alarm's off.
- All right, alarm's off.

1187
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,317
WES: Pick.

1188
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,023
- KOSH: Right. Gotta unlock it.
- WES: Stupid.

1189
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:50,565
- WES: Lock pick.
- KOSH: Yeah.

1190
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,429
- KOSH: Okay.
- WES: All right, we're in.

1191
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:09,050
All right. This'll work.

1192
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,380
I just get the code and...

1193
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,716
(beeping)

1194
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,019
- Voila! Huh?
- (elevator bell dings)

1195
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:25,665
- (snoring)
- (elevator door opening)

1196
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,032
WES: Come on, come on.
Get over here.

1197
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:33,504
All right. Okay.

1198
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,469
Will you just...!

1199
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,077
(bell dings)

1200
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:52,090
Den is that way.

1201
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,664
Ohh!

1202
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,664
Whoa!

1203
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,910
Oh, yeah!

1204
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:18,412
(laughs)

1205
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,453
Hmm!

1206
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,649
There's nothin' here, boss.

1207
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,284
Check for secret compartments.

1208
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,349
Right. Secret compartments.

1209
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:30,698
(snoring)

1210
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,105
Ah!

1211
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,706
Ooh, jackpot, boss!

1212
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,368
(chuckles)

1213
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,548
Oh!

1214
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,886
(barks loudly)

1215
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:33,857
Kosh, did you hear something?

1216
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:36,924
No.

1217
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,024
Go check it out.

1218
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,035
What? Ya know, I think
it would be better

1219
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:42,331
if you went
and checked it out, boss.

1220
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:45,669
Kosh, I said check it out,
and I mean you!

1221
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,208
Mmm! Fine!

1222
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,005
Okay.

1223
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,281
(low growling)

1224
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:57,818
Uncle Wes, is that you?

1225
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,415
(barks)

1226
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,478
(growling)

1227
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,354
It's that darn dog again.

1228
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,555
(barks)

1229
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:17,700
KOSH: Oh, my head!

1230
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:25,413
Yes, this is an emergency.

1231
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:38,455
(coughing and sputtering)

1232
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:44,492
(low growling)

1233
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,172
This oughta take care of you!

1234
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:00,307
Trundle!

1235
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,940
That's it. I'm outta here.

1236
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:03,314
No!!

1237
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,847
Oh, hey, officer,
I was just... no, wait!

1238
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,260
Are you okay, Mr. Trundle?

1239
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,353
Yes, I am. I...

1240
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:20,490
(gasps)

1241
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:21,797
(whimpering)

1242
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,338
That dog just saved my life.

1243
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,704
(whimpering)

1244
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:32,509
(sirens blaring)

1245
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:37,982
(knocking on door)

1246
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:42,912
Chestnut's been hurt.

1247
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,322
(gasps)

1248
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,692
(sniffles)

1249
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,629
He is the best vet
in New York City.

1250
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,981
He's lost a lot of blood.

1251
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,712
Oh, dear.

1252
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,523
I have to see him.

1253
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,859
Please wake up Ray.

1254
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:23,193
She needs to say good-bye, too.

1255
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,066
Ray.

1256
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,539
Ray.

1257
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:42,209
Come here, sweetie.

1258
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,754
Are you okay?

1259
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:04,563
Sal, is he gonna be okay?

1260
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,039
Is he gonna see Mommy
in heaven?

1261
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,241
Yeah.

1262
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,187
Is she gonna take care of him?

1263
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,691
Yeah.

1264
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,151
She'll take very good care of him.

1265
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,493
Just like she's took care of us.

1266
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,325
Ches!

1267
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:04,658
Ches!

1268
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:07,725
Mom, Dad, he's okay!

1269
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:11,102
He licked Sal.
He's gonna be okay!

1270
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,207
(all talking at once)

1271
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,750
I think I owe you all
an apology.

1272
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,254
(laughing)

1273
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,880
The press awaits you, sir.

1274
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,427
Ah-choo!

1275
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,622
Ah!

1276
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,597
It is with the utmost of pleasure
that I'm here to announce

1277
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,660
that New York City
has been saved from

1278
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:46,798
the Central Park robbers
by a most unlikely hero...

1279
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,740
Chestnut, the Great Dane.

1280
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,108
(applause and cheering)

1281
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,148
I only wish that he could
be here in person

1282
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,843
for my very special announcement,

1283
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,612
but he's upstairs recovering,

1284
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,847
having saved my life this evening.

1285
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:05,223
Now, I've had a very strict rule
in all my buildings for a very long time

1286
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,888
but a lot changed for me tonight.

1287
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,865
So I hereby declare
that from this minute forward,

1288
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:14,333
dogs will be permitted
to live in this building

1289
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:17,337
and any other Trundle buildings
in New York City.

1290
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,966
REPORTER: Mr. Trundle,
what about the reward you offered?

1291
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:24,239
On Chestnut's behalf,
Sally Ann and Ray Tomley

1292
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,371
have, um, they decided
to donate the money

1293
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:30,748
to the Lattimer Catholic
Orphanage for Girls.

1294
01:21:40,662 --> 01:21:42,630
- Hey, kids!
