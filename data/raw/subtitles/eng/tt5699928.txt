00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:01,911

(whirring)

12
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,597
- (chuckles)
- Man: Toby?

13
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:05,700
I could use your help
in the garage.

14
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:07,903
(sighs)

15
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,707
- Come on, for old time's sake.
- Dad, Dad, I'm busy.

16
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:18,014
When you're done,
come out, okay?

17
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:20,682
Toby:
Yup.

18
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,713
(chuckles)

19
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,085
(clears throat)

20
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:06,895
(shouting and grunting)

21
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,631
(clanking)

22
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,168
(grunting)

23
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:17,206
No, no, no, no, no.

24
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,122
(tires screeching)

25
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:50,138
- (breathing rapidly)
- (distant sirens wailing)

26
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,606
Toby:
Dad!

27
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:52,807
Woman (muffled):
Toby.

28
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:54,977
Toby:
Mom!

29
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:55,978
Woman:
Toby.

30
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,014
Toby, are you with me?

31
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,023
The lost and found
program will...

32
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,924
allow you a chance

33
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:13,763
to... clear your mind
of these things.

34
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:17,699
To think.

35
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:23,805
You are going to have
such a wonderful time.

36
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,242
Yeah.

37
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,746
(coughing)

38
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:34,850
Cameron:
Watch out!

39
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,721
Man overboard!

40
00:05:40,154 --> 00:05:41,790
(Toby gasping)

41
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:44,959
(coughing)

42
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:47,128
- (thunder rumbling)
- (Toby shouting)

43
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:56,872
Kay:
Okay, everybody, listen up.

44
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:59,807
Today was a superb day
of sailing.

45
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,911
You all did great.

46
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:05,747
Even you, Toby.

47
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:08,817
Yeah, Toby.
We've all had our moments.

48
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,985
That's exactly the point
of being out here.

49
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:13,689
I hope you've learned
a little bit about yourselves

50
00:06:13,755 --> 00:06:15,356
and about working
as a team.

51
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:18,293
Which is what brought us
to this uninhabited island chain

52
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,895
of Pulau Aibai

53
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:22,098
and the final stage
of this course.

54
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,334
Now, you're each gonna camp

55
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,103
on a different island
by yourself

56
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,471
for three days
and three nights.

57
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:32,240
There are more than
a hundred uninhabited islands

58
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:33,375
around Malaysia,

59
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:34,610
so I honestly can't tell you

60
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:37,446
too much about what
to expect from yours.

61
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:40,248
You have a sleeping bag,
a tarp...

62
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,951
torch light.

63
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,487
You also have a parachute flare

64
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:47,622
if there is an emergency

65
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,093
and you need to signal
passing boats.

66
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,361
Got it?

67
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:54,329
What are we supposed
to do for three days?

68
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,064
Sit.

69
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:59,401
Think. Explore.

70
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,337
It's entirely up to you.

71
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,874
The point of a solo
is introspection.

72
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,875
It's a chance to think
about why you're here

73
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:09,277
in the first place...

74
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,050
and the kind of person
you decide to be

75
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:16,185
in the future.

76
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,956
(ominous music playing)

77
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:23,759
Kay:
You may not think so,

78
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:24,826
but you're a different guy

79
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,829
from the one I met
two weeks ago.

80
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:33,034
(ominous music playing)

81
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,174
You got dropped off first,
so I'll pick you up first.

82
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,509
Meet me here at the crack
of dawn in three days

83
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:42,978
with your stuff packed.

84
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,382
Hey, man, look around you.

85
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,252
People spend a fortune
to be in a place like this.

86
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,389
It's your own slice
of paradise.

87
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,029
(motor starts)

88
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:21,884
(waves lapping)

89
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:25,220
(sighs)

90
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,287
Fuck.

91
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:34,295
(flies buzzing)

92
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:38,300
(sighs)

93
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,437
All right, Robinson Crusoe.

94
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,072
Let's see what you got.

95
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,312
Hey.

96
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,613
Did you know that
there was clear-cut signs

97
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,181
that Robin Crusoe was gay?

98
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:55,616
Really?

99
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:56,451
Oh, yeah.

100
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:58,086
It's laden with innuendos.

101
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,922
No kidding.

102
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,257
It's really progressive
for the time

103
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,526
for Western society's
strength and imperialism.

104
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:06,562
Like the, uh, systematic raping

105
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,165
of indigenous cultures
and resources?

106
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,235
Wow.

107
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,339
Really no wonder
you can't make any new friends.

108
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:20,074
Build a nice tent though.

109
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,211
High five.

110
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:40,196
(bird calling in distance)

111
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:42,931
Right here.

112
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:45,000
(leaves rustling)

113
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:53,975
(animal yipping in distance)

114
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,115
(mumbling)

115
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,418
Oh. Coconuts

116
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:06,020
Wonder if they're organic.

117
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,023
Let's see.

118
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,491
(screams, gasps)

119
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:12,060
Oh, shit. Oh!

120
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,004
(monkeys screeching)

121
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,349
Hey. Hey!

122
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,018
Hey. No. Get out!

123
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,588
- (screeching)
- (panting)

124
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,024
God damn it.

125
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,592
(flies buzzing)

126
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:49,365
(groans)
Yeah. Uninhabited, my ass.

127
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,652
(screams, groans)

128
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,254
Shit!

129
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,667
Yeah, a great moment
in survival instincts, Toby.

130
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,168
Genius.

131
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,246
Ow!
(grunting)

132
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,122
Clams.

133
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,205
(retching, coughing)

134
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:40,341
Oh, shit.

135
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,770
Where are they?

136
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:16,345
(groans)

137
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:34,430
(groaning)

138
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,205
What?

139
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:45,807
Hello?

140
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,767
(screams)
Shit! Oh!

141
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,571
(coughing)

142
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,275
Where is it?

143
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:48,803
Dad.

144
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,582
(groaning)

145
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,768
Shit.

146
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:00,708
Oh!

147
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:04,879
Oh.

148
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,486
Oh.

149
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:55,923
(animal squealing)

150
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,058
(Toby screams)

151
00:18:01,996 --> 00:18:03,663
(animal squealing)

152
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,832
Toby: Hey.

153
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:05,833
Wait.

154
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,735
Ah.

155
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,947
(animal crying in pain)

156
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:23,785
(girl grunts)

157
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:28,055
(girl breathing heavily)

158
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,832
Can't stay here.

159
00:18:38,066 --> 00:18:39,034
Need to go.

160
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:42,604
Okay.

161
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,052
Hey.

162
00:18:59,019 --> 00:18:59,954
So, uh...

163
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:02,923
(grunts)
So, do you live here?

164
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,566
Is there...

165
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,535
Is there a town close by?

166
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,771
I could really use
something to eat.

167
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:21,076
Oh.

168
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,682
I'm part of this, uh,
lost and found program.

169
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:30,786
You heard of it?

170
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,088
It-It's like this program for...

171
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,692
kids who mess up,
I guess. I...

172
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,695
Teach you how to get
in touch with your feelings,

173
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:45,031
something about
personal growth and...

174
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:47,234
and then throw...
throw you out into an island

175
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:48,969
and you have
to survive in nature.

176
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:51,973
On purpose?

177
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:56,744
Yeah.

178
00:19:58,145 --> 00:19:59,980
It's pretty stupid I guess.

179
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:22,003
Mm. It's...

180
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,172
Oh, it's actually
really delicious.

181
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:26,740
Hmm.

182
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:29,543
Hey, um...

183
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,546
who built this dam?
It's really cool.

184
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:32,881
Girl:
The missionaries.

185
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:35,750
Oh. Hey, wh...

186
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,918
where're you going?

187
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:38,854
Home.

188
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:41,122
Toby:
Oh, okay. Uh...

189
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,090
Should I go back
to my camp or...

190
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,961
Girl:
No. It's dangerous.

191
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,596
Uh, wait. I'm sorry, wha...

192
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,230
What, what's dangerous?

193
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:51,633
Uh...

194
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,769
Hey, okay.

195
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,970
Wha...

196
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:58,940
How... how far is the beach
from here? Hey.

197
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,976
Can you at least
tell me your name.

198
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,110
Hey! Oh, shit!

199
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,985
Stay close to the fire.

200
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:12,854
The snakes don't like fire.

201
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,693
My name is Madeleine.

202
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:34,741
Toby:
Alright.

203
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,076
Stay close to the fire.

204
00:21:36,877 --> 00:21:38,279
Staying close
to the fire.

205
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:40,949
(exhales forcefully)

206
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,980
Fuck.

207
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,221
(screams)

208
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:25,727
(breathing heavily)

209
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,272
(groans softly)

210
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,353
(squeaking)

211
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,003
(debris rattling)

212
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,907
Madeleine?

213
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,053
(rattling, tinkling)

214
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:07,028
(leaves rustle)

215
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:36,857
(flies buzzing)

216
00:24:43,263 --> 00:24:44,365
(groans)

217
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,434
(yawns)

218
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,242
Are those eggs?

219
00:24:58,346 --> 00:24:59,314
Chicken eggs?

220
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:01,282
You're funny.

221
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,151
Ah!

222
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:07,855
Madeleine:
That looks bad.

223
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:09,089
It's, uh...

224
00:25:10,357 --> 00:25:11,291
I'm sure it's fine.

225
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,396
Let's eat first, then I'll get
you some medicine later,

226
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:16,431
- okay?
- All right.

227
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:22,269
Hey, are there any, um...

228
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:25,139
like, horned animals,

229
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,442
like these big goats,
on this island?

230
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,178
Why? Have you seen any?

231
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:32,046
Toby:
I don't know what I saw.

232
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,182
So, how long have you
been here for?

233
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:37,985
Madeleine:
Since I was little.

234
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,123
Yeah? Were, were there
other people here too?

235
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:46,060
Madeleine:
Some people. Friends.

236
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:49,629
My mother. My daddy.

237
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:51,331
Are they, are they still here?

238
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,269
Madeleine:
Just my mother.

239
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:57,071
My daddy died a long time ago.

240
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:00,974
I'm sorry. I...

241
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:06,014
I... My dad died too.

242
00:26:15,455 --> 00:26:16,490
I'm sorry.

243
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,961
It's all right.

244
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:32,306
- Toby: Here?
- Madeleine: Here.

245
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,508
Oh, okay.

246
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:45,552
What are they?

247
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:49,490
They're special.

248
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:53,493
You don't eat them until
we're ready to fall asleep.

249
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:55,529
What do they do?

250
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:00,433
Madeleine:
Here.

251
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,237
Wait, I...

252
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:05,605
Oh, my god,
they're, like, numb.

253
00:27:05,673 --> 00:27:06,941
(giggles)

254
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:08,375
Wha...

255
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:09,611
Hey, wait, I...

256
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:13,346
(grunting)

257
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:14,949
Great.

258
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,185
Hey, where are we going? I...

259
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,630
(inaudible)

260
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:26,420
Toby: Infinite connection
of computers.

261
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:27,321
Uh...

262
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:28,422
Madeleine:
Computers?

263
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:31,125
Toby: Th-That's what
you use, like...

264
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:33,361
Never mind. Um...

265
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,563
Hey, um, I need to talk
to you about tomorrow.

266
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,632
It's getting dark.

267
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:45,371
What... what is all this?

268
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,208
Just keep this with you, okay?

269
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,678
Why, is that horned thing
gonna come out of here?

270
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:52,713
My mother good.

271
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:55,282
Okay.
(laughs)

272
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:58,318
She'll kill you
if she finds you.

273
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:01,689
Good night, Toby.

274
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,357
- What?
- I have to go.

275
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:05,526
What are you talking about?

276
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:07,394
You can't ever go
through here, okay?

277
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,396
You'll die if you do.

278
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:12,266
Hey, look, what are you,
no, talking about?

279
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,834
I'll see you tomorrow.

280
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:15,169
Toby: No, no, tomorrow.
I leave tomorrow.

281
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:17,337
Kay is picking me up
first thing in the morning.

282
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:18,338
What?

283
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:20,774
You were just gonna leave
without telling me?

284
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,242
No, that's what I was trying
to tell. I...

285
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,179
Look. Don't go back there
if it's not safe.

286
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,182
If you wanna leave,
then just leave.

287
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:30,418
Madeleine, stop! I, I...

288
00:29:40,426 --> 00:29:41,260
Madeleine!

289
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:42,763
(voice echoing)
Madeleine!

290
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,519
Toby!

291
00:30:05,853 --> 00:30:06,788
Hello!

292
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:10,291
(insects chirping)

293
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:18,398
Hello!

294
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,238
Toby!

295
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:26,273
It's Kay.

296
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:30,745
Are you all right?

297
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,380
I heard screaming from the boat.

298
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:41,489
- (leaves crunching)
- (Kay gasps)

299
00:30:44,692 --> 00:30:47,295
I swear to God,
if you're messing with me...

300
00:30:48,895 --> 00:30:51,697
(grunts, groans)

301
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:52,733
Damn it.

302
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,837
(footsteps)

303
00:30:57,904 --> 00:30:59,373
Who is that?

304
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,782
Toby?

305
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,393
Toby?

306
00:31:20,928 --> 00:31:21,863
Toby?

307
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:24,764
Stop screwing around!

308
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:27,301
You are seriously jeopardizing
the other pick-ups.

309
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:28,835
I don't have time
for all this...

310
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:30,337
(gasps)

311
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:35,542
(ominous music playing)

312
00:31:38,545 --> 00:31:39,580
(gasps)

313
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:43,718
Toby, God damn it.
Is that you?

314
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:49,823
(gasps)

315
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:54,662
(shaky breathing)

316
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:09,442
(growling)

317
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:17,817
(screaming)

318
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:32,799
Oh, shit.

319
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,944
Shit.

320
00:32:48,414 --> 00:32:50,585
It's gotta be here
at least. I...

321
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,857
(panting)

322
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,829
(ominous music playing)

323
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,891
(gasping, panting)

324
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:41,929
Kay!

325
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,028
(gasps)

326
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:25,005
(metallic creaking)

327
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:10,150
(screams)

328
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:14,021
(creaking continues)

329
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,909
(gasping)

330
00:37:12,278 --> 00:37:13,713
God, Kay.

331
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,114
(hissing)

332
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,293
(rattling, tinkling)

333
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,131
(eerie music playing)

334
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:41,161
(squeaking)

335
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,201
(growling)

336
00:40:25,137 --> 00:40:26,239
(growling)

337
00:40:45,057 --> 00:40:46,425
- (bat squeaks)
- (Toby gasps)

338
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:47,527
(flashlight clatters)

339
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:48,961
Toby: Shit.

340
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:52,231
No, no, no, no, no.
No. No, no, no, come on.

341
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:58,138
(rattling)

342
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:01,375
(tapping)

343
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:08,248
(breathing heavily)

344
00:41:11,384 --> 00:41:14,987
(eerie music playing)

345
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:09,443
(ominous music playing)

346
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:22,188
(bleating)

347
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:33,200
(shrieking)

348
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:37,070
(weak bleating)

349
00:42:43,342 --> 00:42:44,478
(bleating stops)

350
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:50,409
(creaking)

351
00:44:35,054 --> 00:44:36,455
(unzips)

352
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:42,229
Shit.

353
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,247
Yes.

354
00:45:35,114 --> 00:45:36,181
Yes. Yes.

355
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:39,584
(static crackling, hissing)

356
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:41,186
Uh...

357
00:45:41,253 --> 00:45:42,355
Mayday. Mayday.

358
00:45:42,422 --> 00:45:43,722
This is The Seaker.
Does anyone copy?

359
00:45:43,789 --> 00:45:45,425
(static hissing)

360
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:49,095
Uh, mayday. This is The Seaker.
Do you copy?

361
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:50,429
(static hissing)

362
00:45:50,496 --> 00:45:51,697
Man (on radio):
<i>Who is this?</i>

363
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:54,100
<i>Who is this?</i>

364
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:57,603
Yes, y-yes.
Copy, copy. Um...

365
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,739
Listen, the boat has sunk.

366
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:01,840
My name is, uh, Toby Burns.

367
00:46:01,907 --> 00:46:03,476
I'm part of a lost
and found program.

368
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:05,378
I'm stranded
on a deserted island.

369
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:08,247
Please, uh, someone is dead.

370
00:46:08,313 --> 00:46:11,149
I-I'm in the Pulau Aibai
island chain.

371
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:13,786
(static hissing)

372
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,255
Please, please,
does, does anyone copy?

373
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:18,090
(static hissing)

374
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,092
Hello?

375
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:21,727
(static hissing)

376
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:23,628
You left the door open again.

377
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:26,498
That's how animals keep getting
into the food.

378
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:28,201
Yes, I know.

379
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:29,802
You've told me a hundred times.

380
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,771
Woman:
And you still don't listen.

381
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:33,339
You don't ever listen to me.

382
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:35,307
Woman:
That's not true, Madeleine.

383
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:39,646
I'm done talking about this.

384
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:42,716
You're not ready
to go out there.

385
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:47,521
Go fetch some water
before dinner.

386
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,460
From now on,
you stay around the house.

387
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:55,595
Madeleine:
Why?

388
00:46:56,528 --> 00:46:58,498
Woman:
Because you can't be trusted.

389
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,600
Is that clear?

390
00:47:15,882 --> 00:47:16,849
Madeleine.

391
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:18,384
If you see anyone,

392
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,487
you tell me right away.

393
00:47:28,494 --> 00:47:29,929
(shushing)

394
00:47:29,996 --> 00:47:31,498
Woman:
Is that clear?

395
00:47:32,764 --> 00:47:34,199
- (whispering) Answer her.
- Woman: Madeleine?

396
00:47:34,266 --> 00:47:35,634
Fine. Sorry.

397
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:38,371
You should go down
to the beach.

398
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,606
You can't be here, okay.

399
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:42,574
Madeleine.

400
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:45,243
Go east to the rock beach.
I'll meet you there.

401
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:47,547
- Go. Go.
- Woman: Madeleine.

402
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,481
- Madeleine: Yes.
- Woman: Fetch some water.

403
00:47:49,548 --> 00:47:51,349
And bring in some wood too.

404
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,652
- Fine.
- Woman: Hey.

405
00:47:54,019 --> 00:47:55,422
You're 16.

406
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:57,923
You have to trust me.

407
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,391
I'm your mother.

408
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:19,813
(sighs)

409
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:25,317
(dramatic music playing)

410
00:48:42,335 --> 00:48:43,737
(grunts)

411
00:48:44,971 --> 00:48:48,340
(straining)

412
00:48:50,342 --> 00:48:52,711
(dramatic music continues)

413
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:00,586
(rattling, tinkling)

414
00:50:32,978 --> 00:50:33,913
(gasps)

415
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:37,516
I'm so glad you're okay.

416
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:38,684
After you left,
Mother disappeared,

417
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:40,487
and I was so worried about you.

418
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:44,891
I thought you were leaving.

419
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,798
Madeleine, that...

420
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:55,835
person that was supposed
to pick me up...

421
00:50:58,871 --> 00:50:59,637
she's dead.

422
00:51:01,574 --> 00:51:03,509
I found her boat shipwrecked.

423
00:51:03,576 --> 00:51:05,878
And I found her body.

424
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:07,380
And...

425
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:09,448
I saw your mother.

426
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:11,050
She was swimming away
from the boat.

427
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:15,789
I think she killed her.

428
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:18,991
I think she killed Kay.

429
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:29,836
Madeleine, what...

430
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:33,873
What happened here?

431
00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:38,744
I just remember some things.

432
00:51:40,146 --> 00:51:41,081
Like...

433
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:45,418
We used to build

434
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:46,553
and fish...

435
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:50,757
and play hide-and-go-peek
in the trees.

436
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:54,693
We used to be happy.

437
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:01,100
Then something happened.

438
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:05,771
I just remember...

439
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:08,974
crying alone in the corner...

440
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:13,846
and Mother covered in blood
telling me not to look.

441
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,186
And now I just,

442
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:22,655
I see these things at night.

443
00:52:23,789 --> 00:52:25,892
These terrible things at night.

444
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:29,762
Like there's...

445
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:33,133
some monster
always around me.

446
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:40,673
I think she killed them all.

447
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:44,242
She isn't safe.

448
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:46,144
We need to get you
out of here.

449
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:47,313
Where would we go?

450
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,648
She could find us
anywhere on this island.

451
00:52:48,713 --> 00:52:49,981
Oh, I-I found Kay's radio
in your mother's hut.

452
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:54,686
I'm sure there's a boat
searching for me and the others.

453
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:57,256
I could send a signal.
We can get out of here.

454
00:52:57,322 --> 00:52:59,023
Come with me.

455
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,092
Please.

456
00:53:02,862 --> 00:53:03,829
Okay.

457
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:06,800
Okay, I'll be back here
tomorrow.

458
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:10,068
Don't leave without me.

459
00:53:10,135 --> 00:53:11,570
I won't.

460
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:14,673
Be safe.

461
00:53:38,664 --> 00:53:43,135
(airplane droning)

462
00:53:43,202 --> 00:53:44,604
Shit.

463
00:53:49,275 --> 00:53:51,610
Shit. Uh, hey!

464
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:54,046
No.

465
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:56,048
Hey! Hey!

466
00:53:57,617 --> 00:53:59,084
Hey! No! Over here!

467
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:02,788
(airplane passes overhead)

468
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:42,128
(door rumbling, creaking)

469
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:02,949
(wood creaking)

470
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:19,699
(grunting)

471
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:41,119
(clanking)

472
00:55:57,402 --> 00:55:58,837
(straining)

473
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:04,210
(grunts)

474
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:22,894
(sniffs)

475
00:56:24,362 --> 00:56:25,831
You wanna top it off?

476
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,302
<i>Okay, hot rod.</i>

477
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:31,704
(keys jingling)

478
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:32,872
She's all yours.

479
00:56:34,405 --> 00:56:35,974
Square key.

480
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,043
Teeth down.

481
00:56:44,282 --> 00:56:46,885
(engine roaring)

482
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:00,233
Gas.

483
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,139
Shit.

484
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:10,208
(Toby panting)

485
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:12,811
Damn it.

486
00:57:23,956 --> 00:57:27,160
Oh! Shit! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

487
00:57:28,494 --> 00:57:30,295
- Cameron. Oh, shit, man.
- Toby!

488
00:57:30,362 --> 00:57:31,797
What, w-what are you doing here?

489
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,197
(panting)
I...

490
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:35,000
Kay never showed up.

491
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:37,335
I found a rowboat. I...

492
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:39,070
What the hell's going on, man?

493
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:39,838
Oh, shit.

494
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:41,240
Come here. Look at me.

495
00:57:41,306 --> 00:57:42,407
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

496
00:57:42,474 --> 00:57:44,376
Look, look at me.
It's okay. Hey. Hey!

497
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,157
That lighthouse is
a hundred years old.

498
00:58:00,092 --> 00:58:01,994
Even if we could
get it to work...

499
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:04,962
I know no boats
come around here.

500
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:05,998
I mean, why would they?

501
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:09,567
I think we get back
to my island.

502
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:11,137
It's definitely empty.

503
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:14,940
I'm not leaving without her.

504
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:18,710
Are you serious?

505
00:58:18,777 --> 00:58:21,947
Dude, we're not staying here
with crazy murderers.

506
00:58:22,014 --> 00:58:23,883
You don't even know
if they're alone.

507
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:28,153
I've been on both sides
of the island. They are.

508
00:58:29,153 --> 00:58:31,088
You've obviously
never seen "Deliverance."

509
00:58:31,155 --> 00:58:32,123
(slurping)

510
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:33,992
And we do not belong
out here.

511
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:35,394
She's stuck here.

512
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,298
Just like us.

513
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:43,001
I have to help her.

514
00:58:43,902 --> 00:58:45,170
All right, well...

515
00:58:46,237 --> 00:58:48,239
first, we get across
the channel

516
00:58:48,306 --> 00:58:50,442
and then come back for her
once we get rescued.

517
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:53,879
You've been here what,
six days,

518
00:58:53,945 --> 00:58:55,380
and now you're like Rambo
or something.

519
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:59,116
Where are you going?

520
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:00,319
Her house.

521
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:01,487
Dude.

522
00:59:01,554 --> 00:59:03,121
Those clams must've gotten
into your brain.

523
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:05,057
This is a survival course.

524
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:07,425
Remember? Survival.

525
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:10,061
Let's just get out of here
while we still can.

526
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,199
Are you gonna let some
crazy bitch torture you?

527
00:59:14,266 --> 00:59:16,068
Hey!

528
00:59:24,943 --> 00:59:26,244
I'm sorry.

529
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:31,483
I can't leave her
on this island.

530
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:35,387
I have to help her.

531
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:23,669
(whispering)
Madeleine.

532
01:00:23,735 --> 01:00:25,403
Hey.

533
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,606
Hey. Hey, it's me.

534
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:42,387
- (Toby grunting)
- Woman: Let it go.

535
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:44,156
Let it go.

536
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:49,161
Wha... What...

537
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,695
Wha-What have you done
with her?

538
01:00:50,762 --> 01:00:54,032
Oh, I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

539
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:56,634
Look, I-I-I don't know
where she is.

540
01:00:56,702 --> 01:00:58,437
Okay? Just...

541
01:00:59,605 --> 01:01:01,005
Please let me go, Okay? I...

542
01:01:01,072 --> 01:01:02,375
You need to listen to me.

543
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:06,545
Madeleine is in trouble.
She shouldn't be...

544
01:01:06,612 --> 01:01:08,079
- Hey!
- Toby: Shit.

545
01:01:08,146 --> 01:01:11,049
(dramatic music playing)

546
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:44,548
(screams)

547
01:01:44,615 --> 01:01:47,219
(groaning, crying)

548
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,221
(screams)

549
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,224
(breathing heavily)

550
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:02,701
(coughs)

551
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,371
You have no idea...

552
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,374
what you're doing.

553
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,042
I know enough.

554
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,411
I know that you killed Kay.

555
01:02:13,512 --> 01:02:15,448
You probably killed
your own husband.

556
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,050
- No.
- You keep your daughter prisoner

557
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:20,285
on this island by feeding her
made-up bullshit.

558
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:23,621
I was only trying
to keep people away.

559
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:26,557
I didn't kill them.

560
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,126
Then who killed Kay?

561
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:30,327
Huh?

562
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:32,364
- (groans)
- Toby: Who killed her?

563
01:02:35,134 --> 01:02:36,469
She killed them.

564
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,409
She killed them all.

565
01:02:45,376 --> 01:02:46,277
No.

566
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:47,678
No, you're insane.

567
01:02:47,746 --> 01:02:50,483
(woman breathing heavily)

568
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:57,655
He tried to warn us.

569
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:11,604
Woman: <i>Something...
was always here.</i>

570
01:03:13,371 --> 01:03:15,373
<i>Appeased with sacrifices.</i>

571
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:18,710
We didn't understand.

572
01:03:19,844 --> 01:03:23,248
(muffled indistinct dialogue)

573
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,186
Woman: <i>All it wanted
was the right host.</i>

574
01:03:28,853 --> 01:03:30,789
She was just a little girl.

575
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:46,405
(growling softly)

576
01:03:50,976 --> 01:03:53,211
(inaudible dialogue)

577
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:00,786

01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:08,594
(screams)

580
01:04:09,994 --> 01:04:12,364
Woman:
<i>She spared none.</i>

581
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:20,773
<i>None, but me.</i>

582
01:04:31,882 --> 01:04:32,851
(groans)

583
01:04:37,255 --> 01:04:38,423
Take these...

584
01:04:39,257 --> 01:04:40,525
to subdue it.

585
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:45,664
And it doesn't like the light.

586
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:54,273
You cannot let her leave
this island.

587
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:19,664
(rattling, tinkling)

588
01:05:26,972 --> 01:05:28,374
Toby?

589
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:35,446
(twig snaps)

590
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:39,718
Toby?

591
01:05:43,989 --> 01:05:45,456
Toby, is that you?

592
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:55,768
Who is it?

593
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,362
Toby, come on, man.

594
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,916
- (growling)
- (Cameron screaming)

595
01:06:46,818 --> 01:06:49,722

(growling softly)

598
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:54,920
What did you do?

599
01:07:58,123 --> 01:07:59,458
I-I...

600
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:05,797
Madeleine, I...

601
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:11,903
I did it for us.

602
01:08:31,222 --> 01:08:32,890
We can finally leave together.

603
01:08:59,184 --> 01:09:01,753
(growling)

604
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:06,724
What's wrong?

605
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:07,960
Nothing.

606
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:17,002
- (growling)
- (Toby grunting)

607
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,957

609
01:11:13,784 --> 01:11:15,353
Dad:
<i>Okay, hot rod.</i>

610
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,154
She's all yours.

611
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:27,798
(straining)

612
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:29,935
Really give it a crank.

613

(straining)

614
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:40,144

Hey!

648

Man: What was the name
of the boat?

649
01:20:29,907 --> 01:20:31,708
Was there anyone else
on this island?

650
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:36,514
Relax. You're safe now.
