1
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,867
Can't you sleep?

2
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,832
It's past 1:00 in the morning, Dorothy.

3
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,136
- Aunt Em?
- What, precious?

4
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:39,256
I wish I could put my head on my paws
and go to sleep like Toto.

5
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,343
Soon you will.

6
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,222
I just can't see payin' out money
for this doctor when we don't have any.

7
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,558
Garnet said she'd loan it to us.

8
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,810
Garnet. That's charity, Em.

9
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,387
She's my sister.
It's family, not charity.

10
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,692
It's been six months since the tornado,

11
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,861
and Dorothy hasn't been herself since.

12
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm takin' her to Cottonwood Falls
tomorrow and see if she can be helped.

13
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,492
All she ever talks about
is someplace that just doesn't exist.

14
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,737
Talkin' tin men, walkin' scarecrows,
ruby slippers.

15
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,133
A shooting star, Toto.

16
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,460
A shooting star.

17
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,193
Toto, no! No, Toto!

18
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,751
Did you lay an egg
this morning, Billina?

19
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,326
Let's go see.

20
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,502
Where's your egg, Billina?

21
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:49,062
Billina, if you don't start
laying again,

22
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,315
Aunt Em says she's gonna
stew you up for supper.

23
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,448
It's a key, Toto.

24
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,842
"O... Z."

25
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,388
Oz.

26
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,559
Aunt Em!

27
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:45,150
Aunt Em, look! A key from Oz!

28
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,831
It's just a key to the old house
before the tornado.

29
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,042
- I must've turned it a thousand times.
- No, look, Aunt Em.

30
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,077
It's proof. "O-Z." Oz.

31
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:00,415
- Dorothy...
- My friends sent it on a shooting star.

32
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,209
Remember how we spoke?

33
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,713
Not to talk about Oz?

34
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,508
Why?

35
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,762
'Cause it's just my imagination.

36
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,484
I know you don't want
to go to the doctor's.

37
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,363
But you just haven't slept the night
right through since the tornado.

38
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:24,940
And then, you're no help
to me in the morning.

39
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:30,246
Aunt Em, my friends are in trouble.

40
00:05:30,346 --> 00:05:32,948
- I know it!
- We are in trouble, Dorothy.

41
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,700
Lost the old house in the tornado.

42
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,746
Never before had to have a mortgage,
now we may have to have two.

43
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:43,959
Winter's comin' on.
New house isn't finished.

44
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,258
He broke his leg, Aunt Em.

45
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,774
Dorothy, that leg's mended. It's mended.

46
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:01,810
Hurry up and get yourself ready.
We're going to be late.

47
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,246
Bye, Uncle Henry!

48
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:14,749
Y'all get yourselves back here by dark!

49
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,116
We will!

50
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,995
Come on, giddap! There you go.

51
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,518
Go home, Toto.

52
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:45,854
Toto, go home!

53
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:51,318
Go home!

54
00:06:52,887 --> 00:06:54,946
Aunt Em, will he be all right?

55
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,698
He will.

56
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,993
Go home!

57
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,734
Giddap.

58
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:42,243
I've never been past Franklin before.

59
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:12,533
The tin woodsman used to be made
of flesh, like everybody else,

60
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,442
but then he cut off his leg.

61
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,028
He had a tin leg made,

62
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,707
but then a witch enchanted his ax,

63
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:25,213
and he kept on cutting off the other parts
of his body, until he was all made of tin.

64
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:28,716
- Even his head was...
- That's all right, Dorothy.

65
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:31,626
You mentioned something about a tiger.

66
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,764
A lion. A cowardly lion.

67
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:39,300
And he could talk too,
like the scarecrow and the tin man?

68
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,470
Yes, all the animals in Oz could talk.

69
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,400
Just how did you get back from Oz?

70
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,393
With my ruby slippers.

71
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,979
And exactly...

72
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,981
how did that work?

73
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,944
You put them on
and you click the heels three times,

74
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:01,489
and then you said,
"There's no place like home."

75
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,244
Dorothy, where are those slippers now?

76
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:10,957
Dorothy?

77
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:14,961
I lost them.

78
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,674
They fell off on the way back.

79
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:28,442
Well, I think I know just the thing

80
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,144
to cheer Dorothy up.

81
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:40,162
This electrical marvel will make
it possible for you to sleep again.

82
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:46,002
And it will also get rid of
all those bad waking dreams

83
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,953
that you've been telling me about.

84
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,633
Now, this fellow here has a face.

85
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,177
Do you see it?

86
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:58,671
Here are his eyes,
and this must be his nose,

87
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,883
and this must be his mouth.

88
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,053
But what's this? Dorothy?

89
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:12,143
Why, it's his tongue!

90
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,030
Isn't it?

91
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,399
- Will it hurt?
- No, no!

92
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:22,204
It just manages electrical current.

93
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:26,709
Now, your aunt already knows
that we are at the dawn of a new age.

94
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:30,546
In just two months,
it will be the year 1900.

95
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:35,083
A new century. The 20th century.

96
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,545
A century of electricity.

97
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,508
The brain itself is an electrical machine.
It's nothing but a machine.

98
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:48,346
When it malfunctions,
a blow to the head, for example,

99
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:51,901
then the brain produces
useless excess currents.

100
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:57,522
These excess currents
are our dreams and delusions.

101
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:04,779
And we have found out that
sometimes the brain malfunctions.

102
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:08,074
Just like the dreams
that you have, Dorothy.

103
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:13,881
Now we have the means
to control these excess currents.

104
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,206
Yes.

105
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,626
Fine.

106
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,939
I must get back to Henry
before nightfall.

107
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,806
You understand, don't you?

108
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,071
Here's your lunch pail. I was thinking
we'd only stay a short time.

109
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:40,607
That won't be necessary.
We have excellent meals here.

110
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,821
Now, be a good girl,

111
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,242
and do everything the doctor
and the head nurse tell you,

112
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,796
and I'll be back tomorrow

113
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,331
and we'll go home!

114
00:11:57,691 --> 00:12:01,053
I've never left her
out of my sight among strangers.

115
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,755
She's in good hands.

116
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,560
Will you bring Toto
when you come to get me?

117
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,764
I will. Yes, of course I will.

118
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,001
You won't need that!

119
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:00,321
You stay here until
we come and get you.

120
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:04,732
You may have a nap if you wish.

121
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,834
Come on, giddap!

122
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,411
Come on!

123
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,215
Aunt Em.

124
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,180
This is for you.

125
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,101
Thank you.

126
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,526
- It's Halloween soon.
- I know.

127
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,780
Why did they bring you here, Dorothy?

128
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:58,286
Because I can't sleep.

129
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:04,917
And I talk about a place that I've been to,
but nobody believes it exists.

130
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,770
I have to go. I'll come back later.

131
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:51,816
Would you like to go
for a ride, Dorothy?

132
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,723
- Lie down.
- I'd like to sit up if I may.

133
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:18,843
- What did your aunt tell you?
- To do what you told me, Miss Wilson.

134
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,388
Then lie down.

135
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:30,572
Why do you have to tie me down?

136
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:32,908
So that you don't fall off.

137
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:37,403
I came all the way from the farm
in the buggy and didn't fall off.

138
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:49,624
- Did I hear somebody screaming there?
- No.

139
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,117
Hello, Dorothy. How are you?

140
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,453
I wish I wasn't tied down.

141
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,737
Nothing to worry about.

142
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,791
What are those?

143
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:24,043
Oh.

144
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,378
We'll just put them over your ears.

145
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:31,967
Pretty soon they'll draw all those
unpleasant dreams out of your head.

146
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:36,504
Then, when you wake up,
you'll never be bothered by them again.

147
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,063
Testing. On.

148
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,267
Off.

149
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:07,159
Well, I think we're almost ready.

150
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,218
- Ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

151
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,650
Oh, dear.

152
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,789
I'll see to that.
You check the generator.

153
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,193
- Who's there?
- Quick! We have to get you out of here.

154
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,748
What's that screaming?

155
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:29,668
Patients who have been damaged,
locked in the cellar.

156
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,285
Quick!

157
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,968
Get back!

158
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,554
In here, quick!

159
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:08,322
So!

160
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,658
Run, Dorothy, run!

161
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,955
Come on!

162
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,339
Faster, Dorothy! Faster!

163
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,692
Stop!

164
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,319
Stop!

165
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:55,661
- Dorothy!
- Here, grab my hand!

166
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,375
Dorothy!

167
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,711
Jump!

168
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,219
Stop!

169
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,809
Here, Dorothy, here!

170
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,563
Hold on!

171
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,080
What's that?

172
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,595
I was just tryin' to lay
my egg, that's all.

173
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,318
Billina?

174
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:54,414
Who else?

175
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:57,709
What are you doing here?
Have you been here all night too?

176
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:02,297
I've never been so wet in my whole life.

177
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,595
How big is this pond anyway?

178
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:11,130
I don't think it's a pond, Billina.

179
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,515
- I guess it is a pond.
- Told you so.

180
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:27,114
Where did all the rest of the water go?

181
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:29,815
Where did Kansas go?

182
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,596
This is some place for a chicken coop.

183
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:57,009
When did you learn to talk? I thought
hens could only cluck and cackle.

184
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:00,846
Strange, ain't it? How's my grammar?

185
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:05,527
If we were in the Land of Oz,
your talking wouldn't be strange at all.

186
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:08,520
There goes the water.

187
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,818
High and dry.

188
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:19,490
Oz.

189
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:29,468
- Maybe this is Oz!
- Oz?

190
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,890
Well, I think I'll have a look around and
see if I can find myself some breakfast.

191
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,590
Wait!

192
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:42,930
If this is the Land of Oz,
then this is the Deadly Desert.

193
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,433
Deadly Desert?

194
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:53,074
It surrounds Oz. Last time
I flew over it in the old house.

195
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:57,412
Anything living that touches it
turns to sand.

196
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,738
Just my luck.

197
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,618
If we stay on these stones,
we'll be all right.

198
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:09,915
Careful.

199
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,130
Careful.

200
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:24,138
One, two, three!

201
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,932
There.

202
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:32,239
- Now, let's find something for breakfast.
- It's about time.

203
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:37,118
Then we can go on to the Emerald City
and see my friend the Scarecrow.

204
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:40,487
- Scarecrow?
- He's the King of Oz, Billina.

205
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:51,758
Look, Billina. It's a lunch pail tree.

206
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:54,460
What happened to breakfast?

207
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,797
Now I know we're in Oz.

208
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,511
Now, make sure
you don't pick a green one.

209
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,348
There's some ripe ones.

210
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:16,607
This one for now,
and this other one for later.

211
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,955
Come share my lunch with me, Billina.

212
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:24,823
Just a minute.
Nice couple of worms here.

213
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:28,035
I wonder what's inside.

214
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:42,017
And a ham sandwich?

215
00:26:42,117 --> 00:26:44,436
I'm glad it's not fried chicken.

216
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,105
Oh, Billina, we're back in Oz!

217
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:52,059
Now I can show you all the people
and things that nobody would believe in.

218
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,234
Your Majesty, she has returned to Oz.

219
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:04,696
Good. Keep an eye on her.

220
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:09,961
What's the matter? What is it?

221
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,006
She has a chicken with her!

222
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:15,332
A chicken!

223
00:27:18,153 --> 00:27:21,723
Where are all your friends?
Where is everybody?

224
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:26,186
I don't know, Billina. Oz is pretty big.

225
00:27:26,286 --> 00:27:29,096
I don't like it. Makes me nervous.

226
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,958
Billina, this is our old house!

227
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:01,096
The one the tornado blew away!

228
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:05,924
- This is how I got to Oz the first time.
- Looks like it was a rough trip.

229
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,446
Billina, this used to be my bedroom.

230
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,148
And in there was the kitchen.

231
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,114
That's where we landed on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

232
00:28:30,183 --> 00:28:34,421
- Wicked Witch?
- But where are all the Munchkins?

233
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:37,497
What are you on about, my dear?

234
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:42,169
Oh, no.

235
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,817
- Oh, no!
- It's just a yellow brick.

236
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:58,945
No, Billina, you don't understand.

237
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:02,490
This was the Yellow Brick Road.

238
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,692
It leads to the Emerald City!

239
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,446
Dorothy!

240
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,785
Wait for me!

241
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:20,675
Oh, no! What's happened?

242
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,649
Your Majesty,

243
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,195
they have discovered
the Yellow Brick Road

244
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:43,907
and are on their way
to the Emerald City.

245
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:48,276
Good. They won't get past Mombi.

246
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,512
Well, Billina,
that was the Emerald City.

247
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:44,875
- Not moving very fast, are they?
- They've all been turned to stone.

248
00:30:45,526 --> 00:30:48,670
All this way to see a bunch of stiffs.

249
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:58,930
- What's a Wheeler?
- I don't remember them.

250
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:27,427
Look, these ones have lost their heads.

251
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:31,922
That's what I call
just plain carelessness.

252
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:38,720
Billina!

253
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:43,475
Dorothy, look out!

254
00:31:44,127 --> 00:31:45,602
It's the Tin Woodsman.

255
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,188
Oh, Tin Woodsman, what happened to you?

256
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:51,983
What's happened to everybody?

257
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,073
Oh, Cowardly Lion!

258
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,328
Oh, Cowardly Lion,

259
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:06,174
what's happened to you?

260
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:12,963
Come here, chicken!

261
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,590
A Wheeler!

262
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:22,681
Billina! Billina!

263
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:29,104
Over here, Dorothy!

264
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,988
Quick! That way!

265
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,092
We've got you. You're trapped!

266
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,267
Chicken!

267
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,488
The key!

268
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,207
Get her!

269
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,560
You have to come out sooner or later.

270
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,646
When you do,
we'll tear you into little pieces

271
00:33:43,746 --> 00:33:45,722
and throw you in the Deadly Desert!

272
00:33:46,332 --> 00:33:48,443
I haven't done anything to you!

273
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:51,895
Isn't that a stolen lunch pail
in your hand?

274
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:55,742
Isn't that a chicken in there with you?

275
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,243
Chicken!

276
00:33:57,343 --> 00:34:02,123
The Nome King doesn't allow chickens
anywhere in Oz!

277
00:34:02,223 --> 00:34:05,700
- Who's the Nome King?
- "Who is the Nome King?"

278
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,465
"Who is the Nome King?"

279
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,422
Well, what are we going
to do now, Dorothy?

280
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:25,595
What is it?

281
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:30,558
I don't know.

282
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:48,211
"The Royal Army of Oz."

283
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:51,881
Army? It's just a bunch of old junk,

284
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:55,250
like the copper kettle
in the yard back home.

285
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:03,133
Look! Billina, some directions.

286
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:18,356
"For thinking,
wind number one under left arm.

287
00:35:20,426 --> 00:35:23,236
"For speaking,
wind number two under right arm.

288
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:29,377
"For walking and action,
wind number three, middle of back.

289
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:35,540
"Guaranteed to work perfectly
for 1,000 years."

290
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:37,584
You don't believe that, do you?

291
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:40,920
I don't know.
I'll wind him up and we'll see.

292
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:44,299
I'll wind up his thinking first.

293
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,312
I wonder what he's thinkin' about.

294
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,567
I'll wind up his speech,
and maybe he can tell us.

295
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:11,085
Maybe he can tell us
what happened to the Emerald City.

296
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:18,291
- Good morning, little girl.
- Good morning, sir.

297
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:22,420
Are you Dorothy Gale?

298
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:25,183
- Yes, sir.
- Pleased to meet you.

299
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,477
I am Tik-Tok, the Royal Army of Oz.

300
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:32,815
His Majesty, the Scarecrow, locked me
in here and told me to wait for you.

301
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:36,110
What happened to the Emerald City?
Where is the Scarecrow?

302
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,948
I do not know. Suddenly everything
living began to turn to stone.

303
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:45,870
When you did not arrive,
I called for help until my voice ran down.

304
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,624
Then I paced back and forth
until my action ran down.

305
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:53,461
Then I stood and thought
until my thought ran down.

306
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:59,300
After that, I remember nothing
until you wound me up. Thank you.

307
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,137
You're welcome.
It was Billina who found the key.

308
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:06,464
- Billina?
- Over here.

309
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:11,103
Good morning, Mrs. Hen. Where
did you find the key for this place?

310
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:14,649
- Over near the hog trough.
- Hog trough?

311
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,860
- In Kansas.
- Kansas?

312
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,988
The Scarecrow must have
sent it to you somehow.

313
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:25,743
If you don't mind, Mr. Tok,
I'll wind up your action.

314
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:31,749
That would please me very much.
And you may call me Tik-Tok.

315
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,086
Why weren't you turned to stone
just like everybody else?

316
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:39,465
Because I am not alive
and never will be, thank goodness.

317
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:45,179
Well, Tik-Tok, the first thing we have
to do is to escape from the Wheelers.

318
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:49,558
They're outside, and said they're going
to throw us into the Deadly Desert.

319
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:53,428
From now on, I will be
your obedient servant.

320
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:57,566
If you keep me wound up.

321
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:03,229
Make sure my think-works are
extra tight, and I will formulate a plan.

322
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:21,623
Lunch pail.

323
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:26,252
These Wheelers can be tricky customers.

324
00:38:57,518 --> 00:39:00,537
Oh, my goodness.

325
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,890
You run up the stairs.
I will take care of them.

326
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,493
Come here!

327
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:51,421
You'll be sorry for treating me like this!
I'm a terrible person!

328
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:58,229
I am only a machine, so I cannot be sorry
or happy, no matter what happens.

329
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,316
Where's the Scarecrow?
What's happened to the Emerald City?

330
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:04,819
Answer her!

331
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:08,614
- Answer her!
- The Nome King!

332
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:11,742
He conquered the Emerald City.
He took all the emeralds.

333
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,653
- He turned everyone to stone.
- What about the Scarecrow?

334
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:23,546
There's only one person
that knows where the Scarecrow is.

335
00:40:23,646 --> 00:40:28,666
And that's Princess M... M... Mom...

336
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,263
- Princess Mombi!
- Princess Mombi?

337
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,891
- I don't remember her.
- Take us to Mombi.

338
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:39,177
No! No! No!

339
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:46,694
Please, let me go.
Please! Please let me go.

340
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:50,030
Please let me go! Let me go!

341
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,242
- All right, Tik-Tok. Let him go.
- Behave yourself, now.

342
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:56,569
I will behave. I'll behave!

343
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:00,541
Behave!

344
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,039
I'll be...

345
00:41:11,443 --> 00:41:13,628
You behave!

346
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,384
Hello?

347
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,433
What a mess!

348
00:41:29,378 --> 00:41:31,562
Come on, Tik-Tok.

349
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,823
This Mombi is some housekeeper.

350
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:53,543
I think it is up these stairs, Dorothy.

351
00:42:44,536 --> 00:42:49,223
Excuse me, miss,
but are you Princess Mombi?

352
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:53,478
Help me to rise.

353
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:10,244
I think I'll put on
something more appropriate.

354
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:14,665
Come with me.
Your friends can stay here.

355
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,878
We're really looking for the Scarecrow.

356
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:56,249
I think number four will do
for this afternoon.

357
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,500
What do you think?

358
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,369
I think you're very beautiful.

359
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:36,090
I should hope so.

360
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,719
And just who might you be?
What are you doing here?

361
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:43,087
I'm Dorothy Gale.

362
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,225
Dorothy Gale?

363
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:48,811
What's happened to the Scarecrow?

364
00:44:48,911 --> 00:44:50,887
Come nearer to me.

365
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:59,279
The Nome King took the Scarecrow and
all the emeralds back to his mountain.

366
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:01,814
And turned everyone else to stone.

367
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:08,414
You will be rather attractive one day.

368
00:45:08,514 --> 00:45:10,999
Not at all beautiful, you understand,

369
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,961
but you have a certain prettiness.

370
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:17,496
Different from my other heads.

371
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:22,845
I believe I'll lock you in the tower
for a few years till your head is ready.

372
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:26,422
- And then I'll take it.
- I believe you will not!

373
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:28,883
Tik-Tok!

374
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,354
Billina!

375
00:45:32,454 --> 00:45:34,722
I am coming, Dorothy.

376
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:38,902
Do not worry. I will save you.

377
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,188
You, I'll have fried for breakfast!

378
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,358
- Tik-Tok, help me!
- Stop!

379
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:51,614
Oh, dear. My action has run down.

380
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:54,835
This is too bad.

381
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:58,756
My fight with the Wheelers
made me run down faster than usual.

382
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,083
It can't be helped, Tik-Tok.

383
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,096
What will you do with Tik-Tok?

384
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,631
People will think I have a new statue.

385
00:46:20,168 --> 00:46:21,310
Ha.

386
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,731
The Nome King's mountain.

387
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:03,144
If this is Oz, Dorothy, I'd rather
take my chances back in Kansas.

388
00:47:05,547 --> 00:47:08,742
- Billina...
- What?

389
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:14,697
- If only we could just fly away, like you.
- Only in my younger days, my dear.

390
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,315
Mom?

391
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,193
Mom?

392
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,572
Mom, is that you?

393
00:47:59,768 --> 00:48:02,296
No.

394
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,673
- I'm Dorothy Gale.
- Oh.

395
00:48:04,773 --> 00:48:08,802
For a second there,
I thought my mom had come back.

396
00:48:08,902 --> 00:48:12,306
What is this, a man or a melon?

397
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:15,976
A pumpkin, if you please.
My name's Jack.

398
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:18,979
Jack Pumpkinhead.

399
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,315
May I ask a favor of you, Dorothy?

400
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:24,850
Would you please check my head
for signs of spoiling?

401
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:33,192
Any soft spots?

402
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,375
- How does it feel?
- Very nice, sir.

403
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:43,837
Thank you.
I've been alive such a short while,

404
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:47,925
and I'm afraid of spoiling
before I've seen anything of the world.

405
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,877
Could you put some of the rest of me
together again?

406
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:55,849
If you can just tie that arm on.

407
00:48:55,949 --> 00:49:00,052
And then, my other leg
has fallen off too.

408
00:49:04,624 --> 00:49:06,693
Are you sure you're not my mom?

409
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:09,061
I'm sure, Jack.

410
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:14,618
Well, my mother built me to scare
that awful witch, Mombi.

411
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:19,572
She stood me in a place where
Mombi would meet me, face-to-face.

412
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,742
And along she came.
Sure enough, she was scared.

413
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:28,256
But then, she was angry.
She has a terrible temper.

414
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,550
I know.

415
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,137
Where did she get
all those different heads?

416
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:37,339
Did you see the headless
dancing girls outside?

417
00:49:38,624 --> 00:49:40,727
Well, that's where she got them.

418
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:44,731
Anyway, Mombi was about
to destroy me with her stick.

419
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:49,935
But she decided to test some powder
of life she'd just bought from a magician.

420
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,074
She did.

421
00:49:54,174 --> 00:49:56,952
It worked.

422
00:49:57,052 --> 00:49:59,278
Here I am!

423
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:03,083
Powder of life?

424
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:07,671
You sprinkle it on something
and the thing comes to life.

425
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,840
Does Mombi have any more of it?

426
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,044
If she does, it's in cabinet 31,
with her original head.

427
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:19,516
What happened to your mother?

428
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,352
She vanished. Mombi enchanted her.

429
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,439
After that, she threw me in this corner

430
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:27,941
and said she was gonna make
a pie out of me.

431
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:30,318
But she was wearing head 22 at the time

432
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:31,987
and must not have worn it since,

433
00:50:32,087 --> 00:50:33,947
because she hasn't remembered
I'm up here.

434
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:36,398
Jack, Billina, listen!

435
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:38,400
Here's what we have to do.

436
00:50:53,108 --> 00:50:54,917
Oh!

437
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,679
Is that Tik-Tok?

438
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:23,529
Dorothy?

439
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:25,281
Sh.

440
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,199
Oh.

441
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:32,371
Dorothy, may I call you Mom,
even if it isn't so?

442
00:51:34,608 --> 00:51:36,009
Oh!

443
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:37,876
Thank you.

444
00:51:42,282 --> 00:51:45,852
Tik-Tok, are you listening?

445
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:48,355
Don't say anything.

446
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,472
This is Jack.

447
00:51:58,632 --> 00:52:00,534
After I'm finished winding you up,

448
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:04,871
go upstairs with him
and we'll explain what you have to do.

449
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:15,331
- Did you understand all that, Tik-Tok?
- I understand it better than you do.

450
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:51,550
- Good. Go and get the head, Jack.
- Yes, sir!

451
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,952
Billina, where's that cord?

452
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,613
Over here, Billina.

453
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,138
That's it.

454
00:53:04,576 --> 00:53:05,765
What's that?

455
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:08,467
The head of a Gump.

456
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:48,850
Here's a broom, Tik-Tok.

457
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,853
It'll make a great tail.

458
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:54,856
Excellent. Now we must Gump the head
in the front

459
00:53:54,956 --> 00:53:56,983
and tie Jack's feet together.

460
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:00,352
Right. Tie my feet together.

461
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:03,730
Bring that mantelpiece to the desk,
and anoint the palms!

462
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,775
Right. Anoint the palm!

463
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,330
That is right, Jack. Left, right, wrong.

464
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:12,207
What are you talking about?

465
00:54:12,307 --> 00:54:16,002
Little girls, pumpkinheads
make chicken fly the coop.

466
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:17,244
Coop?

467
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,932
Dorothy Gale!

468
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,104
Dorothy Gale!

469
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,195
Dorothy Gale!

470
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:07,271
Where's my powder of life?

471
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:15,237
- Mombi's awake!
- Oh, no!

472
00:56:15,763 --> 00:56:18,824
- It's not finished!
- Tik-Tok went berserk!

473
00:56:19,017 --> 00:56:22,536
- Tickle, tickle me!
- His brain's ran down.

474
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:26,248
If his brain's ran down,
how could he talk?

475
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:28,968
It happens to people all the time, Jack.

476
00:56:29,068 --> 00:56:32,389
Tie the palm leaves to the sofa, quick!
Billina, help him!

477
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:35,350
- We need another cord!
- Well, hurry!

478
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:38,103
Thank goodness, Dorothy.
I am all right now.

479
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:40,313
Go to the door and look out for Mombi.

480
00:56:40,413 --> 00:56:42,431
All right, Dorothy.

481
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:49,605
Make sure you do the head,
so it can see where it's going.

482
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:01,376
- It's not working!
- There must've been some magic words.

483
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:04,421
- What were they? Think!
- Think?

484
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:05,547
You've got to remember!

485
00:57:05,647 --> 00:57:08,675
I wasn't alive then.
How can I remember?

486
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:12,044
Read the directions, Dorothy!

487
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:15,265
- I don't know these words!
- Read them anyway.

488
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,549
"Weaugh, teaugh,

489
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,593
"peaugh."

490
00:57:19,994 --> 00:57:22,220
- Peaugh?
- That's it!

491
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:26,224
Hurry!

492
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,320
I'll stop you!

493
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,614
She is coming!

494
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,200
Jack, go help Tik-Tok get aboard.
Billina, get in!

495
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,952
- Wait for me!
- A chicken?

496
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,289
- Can you flap your wings?
- I don't have any wings.

497
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,375
- Now you do!
- I guess you're right, I do!

498
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:45,378
- Jump up, Tik-Tok!
- Help me up, Dorothy!

499
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:50,082
- Easy, is it?
- Dorothy Gale!

500
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,927
So!

501
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:55,796
- Fly, fly!
- Wait for me.

502
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,049
Jack! Jack!

503
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,551
Stop!

504
00:58:09,043 --> 00:58:11,353
Fly! Fly!

505
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,027
We did it!

506
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:31,206
- Help me!
- Hold on, Jack!

507
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:34,469
Here, Jack, give me your hand.

508
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:36,586
Tik-Tok, will you help me pull?

509
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:40,725
Wake up! Wake up, all of you! Get up!

510
00:58:40,825 --> 00:58:43,895
Get up! Wake up! Look!

511
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:46,898
Dorothy Gale is escaping!

512
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:49,526
Go and get them back for me! Hurry up!

513
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,237
All of you! Go on!

514
00:58:52,337 --> 00:58:55,856
And make sure
you bring back that chicken!

515
00:58:57,216 --> 00:59:00,527
Don't come back without them!

516
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:08,628
The last thing I remember
is walking through the forest

517
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:11,204
and hearing a loud noise.

518
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:15,843
And now, here I am,
flying through the air.

519
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:18,638
What am I anyway?

520
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:21,432
You're just a thing

521
00:59:21,532 --> 00:59:23,434
with a Gump's head on it.

522
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,645
We built you and brought you to life

523
00:59:25,745 --> 00:59:29,315
so that you could take us to
the Nome King to rescue the Scarecrow.

524
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:33,736
I may not last very long.
I don't feel too well put together.

525
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,863
Oh, don't say that.

526
00:59:35,963 --> 00:59:40,410
How do we know where to land?
It's awful dark down there.

527
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,195
The Nome King's mountain
was straight ahead.

528
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:46,364
I think.

529
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:50,878
The best thing to do is
to keep flying until dawn.

530
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:54,048
Then maybe we can find
a safe place to land.

531
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:56,050
Good idea, Tik-Tok.

532
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,662
Mr. Gump? Can you just
keep flying straight ahead?

533
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,380
I don't think
I could turn if I wanted to.

534
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:07,385
Why don't we just fly back to Kansas?

535
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,058
Whatever happens,

536
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,020
I'm awfully sleepy right now.

537
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,943
And I'm just glad I have
my own head to be sleepy with.

538
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:30,116
Good night, Mom.

539
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:35,206
Good night, Jack.

540
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:56,685
Ozma.

541
01:00:57,795 --> 01:01:00,657
Nobody's going to help you.

542
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,275
Nobody knows where you are.

543
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,447
There's nobody left
who even knows who you are.

544
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,634
- What are they?
- Wheelers.

545
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:36,859
Mr. Gump, can't you fly any faster?

546
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,728
Not unless one of you wants to jump off.

547
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:41,146
Oh.

548
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:44,649
Tik-Tok, you're the heaviest.

549
01:01:44,842 --> 01:01:45,910
Hmph!

550
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,685
Deadly Desert.

551
01:02:10,785 --> 01:02:12,928
Deadly Desert!

552
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:23,313
We are over the Deadly Desert, Jack.

553
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:53,352
Mom! Wake up!

554
01:02:53,452 --> 01:02:55,354
What's happening?

555
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:58,733
- The ropes are breaking.
- Oh, no!

556
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,810
I knew it! We're gonna fall apart.

557
01:03:03,254 --> 01:03:05,865
Are we gonna land now, Mom?

558
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:08,900
Other side. The rope on the other side.

559
01:03:11,552 --> 01:03:13,164
I'll get it!

560
01:03:13,264 --> 01:03:15,198
Help!

561
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:19,879
- Help me, Mom!
- Oh, Jack!

562
01:03:19,979 --> 01:03:21,579
Hurry!

563
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,760
Fly down.
Jack's lost his head over the side.

564
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,679
- We'll save you, Jack!
- I wasn't made to make turns.

565
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:31,140
- Try! You've got to try!
- Well, all right.

566
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,592
Hold on, I'm not sure
I know how to do this.

567
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:44,269
- Hold on, Tik-Tok!
- I am, Dorothy.

568
01:03:46,601 --> 01:03:48,115
Hold on, Dorothy.

569
01:03:56,724 --> 01:03:58,334
Can you hear me, Jack?

570
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,837
I feel

571
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:04,205
awfully dizzy!

572
01:04:06,067 --> 01:04:09,919
- Thanks, Mom.
- Somebody help me!

573
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,380
I'll save you.

574
01:04:17,578 --> 01:04:19,095
Abandon ship!

575
01:04:19,246 --> 01:04:22,682
If I had a stomach, I know I'd be sick.

576
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:35,288
I'm sorry, Mom!

577
01:04:35,388 --> 01:04:37,331
It's all right, Jack!

578
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:39,532
It can't be helped now!

579
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:58,436
That was a novel experience, wasn't it?

580
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:00,938
- Pick me up!
- Tik-Tok!

581
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:04,233
Pick me up. Pick me up.

582
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,737
Pick me up. Pick me up.

583
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,156
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

584
01:05:10,256 --> 01:05:12,158
Jack, are you all right?

585
01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:16,120
Why are all of you
standing on your heads?

586
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,071
Where are we, anyway?

587
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,099
The Nome King's mountain.

588
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,008
The Nome King.

589
01:05:44,457 --> 01:05:46,683
Oh, thank you, Dorothy.

590
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:52,689
Tik-Tok, you've got to be more careful.

591
01:05:57,928 --> 01:06:01,832
Yes, Your Majesty? You called?

592
01:06:01,932 --> 01:06:05,118
What is that noise going on up there?

593
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:11,509
I don't know, Your Majesty.

594
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:14,002
Well, find out!

595
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,473
What about the Gump? He's all in pieces.

596
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,475
And good riddance.

597
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,218
I'm much happier just being a head.

598
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:27,441
We should tie him back on the sofa.
Then, at least, he could walk.

599
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,434
Oh, no!

600
01:06:30,002 --> 01:06:33,781
Every head must have a body
if it expects to get around.

601
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:37,326
Doesn't look like there's much
of anyplace to get around to.

602
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:42,665
She escaped from Mombi somehow
and crossed the Deadly Desert.

603
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:47,869
Now she is on our mountain
with a small army.

604
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:51,465
She is more powerful than I thought.

605
01:06:51,565 --> 01:06:53,666
What about the chicken?

606
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:59,088
There's no sign of the chicken.

607
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:04,645
This is terrible.
Suppose I meet another Gump.

608
01:07:04,745 --> 01:07:08,149
I'd die a second time, of embarrassment.

609
01:07:08,249 --> 01:07:12,602
I don't think you'll have to worry about
meeting any other Gumps up here.

610
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:16,323
Tell me who you are,

611
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:20,786
and why you have come
all the way to my kingdom

612
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:23,205
and what I can do to make you happy.

613
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,751
- It must be the Nome King.
- Where is he? I don't see anybody.

614
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:30,212
My name is Dorothy Gale, Your Majesty.

615
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:34,383
And these are my friends,
Tik-Tok, Jack and the Gump.

616
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:40,255
Not the Dorothy Gale from Kansas?

617
01:07:40,865 --> 01:07:42,767
Yes, Your Majesty.

618
01:07:42,867 --> 01:07:47,396
We've come to ask you to release the
Scarecrow and restore the Emerald City.

619
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:51,192
You believe that I have
stolen something, Dorothy,

620
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:53,393
and you want me to give it back?

621
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,937
Yes, Your Majesty.

622
01:07:56,422 --> 01:08:01,442
If someone steals something,
you think they should give it back?

623
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:04,789
Yes, Your Majesty.

624
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:08,283
And what if they don't
want to give it back?

625
01:08:09,894 --> 01:08:11,452
Well,

626
01:08:14,773 --> 01:08:18,552
then we are here
with our army to conquer you

627
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:20,920
and force you to give it back.

628
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:24,340
Army?

629
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:32,399
Mom, why is he laughing?

630
01:08:43,434 --> 01:08:44,902
Army!

631
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,209
An army!

632
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:53,244
- Look out!
- I am! I am!

633
01:08:56,718 --> 01:09:00,251
- Dorothy!
- Mom!

634
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:05,933
All the precious stones in the world

635
01:09:06,033 --> 01:09:08,686
are made here

636
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:13,598
in my underground dominions.

637
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,736
All made for me

638
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:20,855
by my Nomes.

639
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:24,785
So, imagine how we feel

640
01:09:24,885 --> 01:09:27,705
when someone from the world above

641
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:32,075
digs down and steals my treasures.

642
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:36,547
All those emeralds in the Emerald City

643
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:40,208
really belong to me.

644
01:09:40,985 --> 01:09:46,631
I was just taking back
what was mine to begin with.

645
01:09:46,907 --> 01:09:49,977
- You have so much!
- Beg your pardon?

646
01:09:50,077 --> 01:09:52,188
You have so much!

647
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,639
That is not the point.

648
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,487
I am not the thief.

649
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:02,489
- Dorothy!
- Scarecrow!

650
01:10:05,259 --> 01:10:08,111
Your friend is the thief.

651
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,835
What's happened to the Scarecrow?

652
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:19,590
Oh, I transformed him into an ornament.

653
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:25,221
Into an amusing and beautiful ornament
for my palace.

654
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,183
I had been planning
to do it for some time,

655
01:10:29,283 --> 01:10:32,051
and your coming here

656
01:10:32,411 --> 01:10:34,637
reminded me.

657
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,640
Thank you.

658
01:10:41,503 --> 01:10:45,064
He never stole anything!
They were there when he came!

659
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:03,916
He never stole the emeralds.
They were there when he came.

660
01:11:08,519 --> 01:11:10,006
He...

661
01:11:12,117 --> 01:11:16,837
The emeralds... He never stole.

662
01:11:24,838 --> 01:11:28,983
No, no. Don't cry.

663
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:34,530
Poor, poor Dorothy Gale from Kansas.

664
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:39,545
I didn't realize
he meant so much to you.

665
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:43,507
He didn't steal the emeralds. They
were there when he became king.

666
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:47,553
All's not lost, Dorothy.

667
01:11:47,653 --> 01:11:51,307
I know just the thing to cheer you up.

668
01:11:56,286 --> 01:11:59,722
You and your friends
can play a little game,

669
01:11:59,957 --> 01:12:03,736
and I bet that you get
the Scarecrow back after all.

670
01:12:03,836 --> 01:12:09,106
You'd risk something for that,
wouldn't you?

671
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,920
All right, then, where's Dorothy?
Where's the chicken?

672
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:26,592
- They escaped.
- They went that way.

673
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:29,178
She went into the Nome King's mountain!

674
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:31,555
We have to warn him about that chicken!

675
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:34,590
Take me to the Nome King,
you stupid idiots.

676
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:40,522
You can go and inspect
my ornament collection.

677
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,776
Each of you has three chances

678
01:12:43,876 --> 01:12:47,780
to guess which one is the Scarecrow.

679
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,115
If you touch the right object

680
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:55,037
and say the word "Oz" at the same time,

681
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,414
the Scarecrow will be restored

682
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:01,075
and you may leave the palace.

683
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:04,954
Sound fair enough?

684
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:11,887
What else can we do?
He's a very powerful magician.

685
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,505
We're lucky
he hasn't turned us to stone.

686
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:24,983
All right, we accept.

687
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:27,268
Oh, good!

688
01:13:41,058 --> 01:13:43,669
Why doesn't the sofa go first?

689
01:13:43,769 --> 01:13:45,921
But I don't have anything to touch with.

690
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,173
You can use your antlers.

691
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:53,044
I should've quit when I was ahead.

692
01:13:58,283 --> 01:14:00,301
Good luck, Mr. Gump.

693
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:10,320
Shall we have some refreshment

694
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:13,189
while we wait?

695
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:27,578
- How is it?
- Good.

696
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:32,968
What is it?

697
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,087
Limestone pie

698
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,256
and hot melted silver.

699
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:42,259
Melted silver?

700
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,741
The King mentioned a risk.

701
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:58,325
What is it that we are risking?

702
01:15:09,021 --> 01:15:11,288
What was that?

703
01:15:12,024 --> 01:15:14,458
Next.

704
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:18,430
- Pick me up.
- I'm coming, Tik-Tok.

705
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,632
Pick me up. Pick me up.

706
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:25,219
- Thank you.
- Where's the Gump?

707
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:28,565
- He's turned into an ornament.
- What do you mean?

708
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:30,891
An ornament. A knickknack.

709
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:34,863
He failed to guess correctly,

710
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:38,450
and so now he's become
part of my collection.

711
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,318
- Oh, no!
- But that's not fair!

712
01:15:43,388 --> 01:15:46,291
You said you were willing
to take a risk.

713
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:49,127
It sounds fair to me,

714
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:52,297
and what I think is all that matters.

715
01:15:52,397 --> 01:15:54,466
But you didn't tell us about it.

716
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,593
Well, you didn't ask.

717
01:15:56,693 --> 01:16:00,296
Perhaps you'd like to visit
my fiery furnace!

718
01:16:05,744 --> 01:16:07,470
Next!

719
01:16:08,246 --> 01:16:10,306
- Pumpkinhead.
- Me?

720
01:16:23,095 --> 01:16:26,623
Being an ornament will probably be
hardest on you, Dorothy,

721
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:31,003
since you're used to eating and
sleeping and other such activities.

722
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:35,090
Since I never eat or sleep,
I won't miss them.

723
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:39,136
Don't talk that way, Jack.
We won't become ornaments.

724
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:41,346
Tik-Tok's not even alive.

725
01:16:41,446 --> 01:16:44,340
I have always valued my lifelessness.

726
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:51,347
Be careful, Jack.

727
01:17:00,257 --> 01:17:02,826
You too, Billina.

728
01:17:03,326 --> 01:17:05,937
We're a long way from Kansas, Dorothy.

729
01:17:11,143 --> 01:17:14,912
Faster! Faster!

730
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,799
Faster! Faster, faster!

731
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,385
You hear me? Faster! Faster!

732
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:23,555
You miserable, slow wretches!

733
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:27,059
I do not hold out much hope for Jack.

734
01:17:27,159 --> 01:17:29,561
He has many excellent qualities,

735
01:17:29,661 --> 01:17:32,648
but thinking is not one of them.

736
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:35,850
Maybe he'll be lucky.

737
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:43,357
Two guesses left.

738
01:17:46,511 --> 01:17:50,865
- You need winding?
- My think-works could be tighter.

739
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,172
It's too bad they didn't make you

740
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:00,040
so you could wind yourself up.

741
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:04,721
Half the trouble you get into
comes from winding down.

742
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:10,301
Faster! Faster!

743
01:18:12,537 --> 01:18:14,597
Faster!

744
01:18:23,548 --> 01:18:27,401
Next, the Army of Oz!

745
01:18:30,514 --> 01:18:35,326
Do not worry, Dorothy.
I am going to guess correctly.

746
01:18:57,249 --> 01:18:59,308
Why did you come here?

747
01:19:01,044 --> 01:19:03,145
I told you why.

748
01:19:04,422 --> 01:19:08,025
You came all this way for a scarecrow?

749
01:19:16,268 --> 01:19:21,256
Are you sure you didn't
come back for these?

750
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,675
- My ruby slippers!
- No. No.

751
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:28,138
No. My ruby slippers.

752
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,516
They just fell out of the sky one day.

753
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:34,718
You were so anxious to get home.

754
01:19:37,789 --> 01:19:40,057
They're very powerful.

755
01:19:41,751 --> 01:19:45,729
They made it possible for me
to conquer the Emerald City.

756
01:19:51,636 --> 01:19:54,071
Thank you.

757
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,877
The Army of Oz has stopped guessing

758
01:19:58,977 --> 01:20:02,214
and is standing perfectly still
in the middle of the room.

759
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,552
Your army

760
01:20:07,652 --> 01:20:11,556
has stopped guessing
and is standing perfectly still

761
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:13,882
in the middle of the room.

762
01:20:16,328 --> 01:20:18,846
His action must have run down.

763
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,516
I wound up his thought,

764
01:20:23,168 --> 01:20:26,687
but I forgot to do his action.

765
01:20:27,297 --> 01:20:31,525
Why don't you go in and wind him up?

766
01:20:32,344 --> 01:20:34,778
Then you can stay in

767
01:20:35,013 --> 01:20:37,406
and guess for yourself.

768
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:05,309
Dorothy.

769
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:08,228
You don't have to go down there.

770
01:21:09,214 --> 01:21:12,775
I can use the ruby slippers

771
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:15,903
and send you home.

772
01:21:16,012 --> 01:21:18,540
And when you get back,

773
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,117
you will never think of Oz again.

774
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,462
What about my friends?

775
01:21:24,562 --> 01:21:28,165
Forget about them.
You can't help them now.

776
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:33,921
There's no place like home.

777
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:16,505
Tik-Tok!

778
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:40,070
Tik-Tok? Tik-Tok!

779
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,674
Tik-Tok, you're all wound up.

780
01:22:50,774 --> 01:22:52,801
What's the matter? Why did you stop?

781
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,887
It was my way of getting you in here.

782
01:22:55,987 --> 01:22:58,306
Pretend that you are
winding me up anyway.

783
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,924
I have an idea that may save us.

784
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:03,687
I have one guess left,

785
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:05,814
and if I guess incorrectly,

786
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:08,692
you can watch and see
what I am changed into.

787
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:11,027
That may give you a clue.

788
01:23:11,127 --> 01:23:13,697
What a good idea!

789
01:23:13,797 --> 01:23:17,033
My steel brains must be damaged

790
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:19,411
because I am having difficulty guessing.

791
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,111
Tik-Tok.

792
01:23:31,981 --> 01:23:33,707
Don't cry.

793
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:02,152
Ready?

794
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:09,905
Oz.

795
01:24:14,566 --> 01:24:16,959
Tik-Tok.

796
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:28,762
Tik-Tok?

797
01:24:30,248 --> 01:24:33,767
Dorothy Gale, you're all that's left.

798
01:24:36,379 --> 01:24:38,355
Stop!

799
01:24:45,555 --> 01:24:48,532
Open up! Tell him it's important!

800
01:25:05,575 --> 01:25:07,519
Oz.

801
01:25:17,295 --> 01:25:19,396
Kneel.

802
01:25:22,634 --> 01:25:24,901
Lower.

803
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:32,844
Lower!

804
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,721
Oz.

805
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,264
One guess left.

806
01:25:54,457 --> 01:25:56,693
Dorothy Gale has come back.

807
01:25:56,793 --> 01:26:00,405
Yes, I know. You were supposed
to bring her to me.

808
01:26:00,505 --> 01:26:02,907
She stole my ruby key, my powder of life

809
01:26:03,007 --> 01:26:06,744
and valuable antiques which
she made into a flying sofa,

810
01:26:06,844 --> 01:26:09,446
and she's headed this way.

811
01:26:15,186 --> 01:26:17,255
You know.

812
01:26:17,355 --> 01:26:19,215
I know everything.

813
01:26:19,315 --> 01:26:24,127
She's already here,
but not for much longer.

814
01:26:39,335 --> 01:26:42,280
Why didn't you just
transform them all right away?

815
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,815
It's more fun this way.

816
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,581
But if she guesses right
and finds out about Ozma...

817
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:53,583
Ozma?

818
01:26:53,683 --> 01:26:55,627
You haven't let her escape as well?

819
01:26:55,727 --> 01:26:57,786
No. No.

820
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:02,290
Then there's nothing to worry about.

821
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:15,647
Soon there'll be no one left

822
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:18,566
who remembers Oz,

823
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:22,811
and I will be completely human.

824
01:27:32,722 --> 01:27:33,998
Oz.

825
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:35,600
Dorothy!

826
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,335
Smudge and blazes!

827
01:27:37,435 --> 01:27:40,370
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy.

828
01:27:40,938 --> 01:27:42,632
- You were green.
- What?

829
01:27:42,732 --> 01:27:46,001
- You were a green ornament.
- I was?

830
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:49,138
Maybe people from Oz
turn into green ornaments.

831
01:27:49,238 --> 01:27:52,549
Fumes and furnaces!

832
01:27:54,118 --> 01:27:57,137
Green. Green, green, green.

833
01:28:02,085 --> 01:28:03,810
Green. It's green!

834
01:28:04,462 --> 01:28:08,315
You let her escape!

835
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:11,985
It's green, Dorothy. Green.

836
01:28:14,972 --> 01:28:16,323
Oz!

837
01:28:16,808 --> 01:28:18,626
Oh, it's you! The Gump!

838
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:22,037
Petrified polymorphs!

839
01:28:22,146 --> 01:28:24,215
Look for green ornaments, quick.

840
01:28:24,315 --> 01:28:27,918
We've still got Tik-Tok, Jack
and Billina to find.

841
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:32,557
You had her and you let her escape!

842
01:28:32,657 --> 01:28:36,352
It wasn't my fault!
If you'd given me a real army...

843
01:28:36,452 --> 01:28:40,388
I'll take care of you later!

844
01:28:50,466 --> 01:28:52,776
What? Oh, no!

845
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:55,747
Oh, Wheelers. Help me!

846
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,119
Dorothy!

847
01:29:06,357 --> 01:29:10,460
- What's happening?
- I was gonna ask you the same thing.

848
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:12,546
Whoa!

849
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:15,423
- Scarecrow!
- Dorothy!

850
01:29:19,203 --> 01:29:20,855
Hang on, Dorothy.

851
01:29:49,358 --> 01:29:50,959
Stop!

852
01:29:51,569 --> 01:29:54,254
Dorothy! Dorothy!

853
01:29:54,405 --> 01:29:55,973
It's green!

854
01:29:56,073 --> 01:29:58,267
- Stop!
- Oz!

855
01:29:58,367 --> 01:30:02,304
- Jack!
- Oh, Mom! Where am I?

856
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,441
What's happening? Who's that?

857
01:30:05,541 --> 01:30:07,485
Stop!

858
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:10,154
We haven't finished guessing yet.

859
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:14,992
- You promised if we guessed correctly...
- I'm tired of games.

860
01:30:15,092 --> 01:30:18,695
I'm tired of all of you!

861
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:25,035
Why doesn't the sofa go first?

862
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:29,966
No! No! No!

863
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:36,013
Come on! Pull!

864
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:47,859
Next, Pumpkinhead!

865
01:30:47,959 --> 01:30:49,893
- No!
- Run!

866
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,021
Run! Hurry!

867
01:30:53,589 --> 01:30:55,032
Faster!

868
01:30:55,132 --> 01:30:57,233
Nomes!

869
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,545
Back! Go back!

870
01:31:07,645 --> 01:31:09,996
This way!

871
01:31:13,651 --> 01:31:16,002
Quick, run away!

872
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,840
Come on! Scarecrow!

873
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:36,439
Mom!

874
01:31:45,516 --> 01:31:47,242
No!

875
01:31:51,981 --> 01:31:53,549
No!

876
01:31:55,026 --> 01:31:56,751
Oh, dear!

877
01:31:57,486 --> 01:31:58,513
Billina.

878
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:02,366
Oh, no! Oh, dear!

879
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:18,982
Mom!

880
01:32:21,677 --> 01:32:23,903
An egg?

881
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:30,753
- Poison.
- Poison.

882
01:32:30,853 --> 01:32:33,089
- Poison.
- Poison.

883
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:35,591
- Poison.
- Poison.

884
01:32:35,691 --> 01:32:38,469
Oh, put me down.

885
01:32:38,769 --> 01:32:41,481
Oh, Mom!

886
01:32:41,581 --> 01:32:44,841
Mom! Look out! Look out!

887
01:32:47,203 --> 01:32:49,230
I finally laid my egg!

888
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,441
Oh, my head!

889
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:59,115
Don't you know

890
01:32:59,215 --> 01:33:02,326
that eggs are poison?

891
01:33:02,426 --> 01:33:04,579
Poison, indeed!

892
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:07,353
Poison.

893
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:11,826
Poison to Nomes!

894
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,082
- Hurry, Dorothy!
- I am! I am!

895
01:34:02,653 --> 01:34:04,379
What are we gonna do now?

896
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:07,006
I wish all of us from Oz

897
01:34:07,116 --> 01:34:09,393
to return there safely,

898
01:34:09,493 --> 01:34:14,597
and for the Emerald City and all
the people in it to be restored to life!

899
01:34:38,314 --> 01:34:42,292
I must say, this life is stranger
than my last one.

900
01:35:03,047 --> 01:35:04,981
Where's Tik-Tok?

901
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:07,233
We never found him.

902
01:35:07,384 --> 01:35:10,153
- Oh, no.
- Where'd you get that?

903
01:35:10,346 --> 01:35:13,457
There's a medal on your antler.

904
01:35:13,557 --> 01:35:16,659
That must've come
from the ornament collection.

905
01:35:22,858 --> 01:35:25,960
Go on. Touch it, Dorothy.

906
01:35:27,404 --> 01:35:28,499
Oz!

907
01:35:31,909 --> 01:35:36,313
Oh, Dorothy. My thinking
must have completely run down.

908
01:35:36,413 --> 01:35:38,765
I do not remember
leaving the Nome Kingdom.

909
01:35:41,919 --> 01:35:44,655
Everything's all right now.

910
01:36:25,254 --> 01:36:27,355
Hi. Hi.

911
01:36:54,783 --> 01:36:56,977
Be the Queen of Oz, Dorothy.

912
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:59,522
Be the Queen of Oz!

913
01:36:59,622 --> 01:37:01,982
- Be the Queen of Oz!
- The Queen of Oz!

914
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:03,567
The Queen of Oz!

915
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:10,857
Be the Queen of Oz!

916
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:17,613
You're the best friends
anyone's ever had.

917
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,117
I've got to go back.

918
01:37:27,858 --> 01:37:30,793
We understand, Dorothy.

919
01:37:32,029 --> 01:37:34,047
Do you?

920
01:37:37,034 --> 01:37:41,105
I wish I could be in both places
at the same time.

921
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:44,599
Look! Behind you, in the mirror!

922
01:38:13,904 --> 01:38:16,005
It's you.

923
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:18,758
I was afraid you had drowned.

924
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:22,595
Help me step through
the glass, Dorothy.

925
01:38:46,937 --> 01:38:49,205
You're so beautiful.

926
01:38:50,441 --> 01:38:52,635
- What's your name?
- Ozma.

927
01:38:52,735 --> 01:38:56,379
Mom! My real mom.

928
01:38:58,073 --> 01:39:03,344
She is Ozma,
Queen and rightful ruler of Oz!

929
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:09,109
Her father was King of Oz
before the Wizard came.

930
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:11,727
Ozma grew up as Mombi's slave.

931
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,115
When the Nome King promised Mombi
30 beautiful heads

932
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:16,816
if she kept Ozma a secret,

933
01:39:16,967 --> 01:39:19,703
she enchanted her into the mirror.

934
01:39:19,803 --> 01:39:21,872
I forgive Mombi.

935
01:39:21,972 --> 01:39:25,501
Dorothy has punished her
by removing her magical powers,

936
01:39:25,601 --> 01:39:29,546
and a witch with no magic
is a miserable creature indeed.

937
01:39:29,646 --> 01:39:31,747
And that's a fact.

938
01:39:37,488 --> 01:39:41,225
Now, please, wish me back to Kansas.

939
01:39:41,325 --> 01:39:43,394
On one condition.

940
01:39:43,494 --> 01:39:45,761
I will look in on you from time to time,

941
01:39:45,954 --> 01:39:48,732
and if you ever wish to return to Oz,

942
01:39:48,832 --> 01:39:50,901
I will make it so.

943
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:53,070
Goodbye, Dorothy.

944
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,322
You're not coming back, Billina?

945
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:59,775
No. Not to that stupid,
humdrum world again.

946
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:03,706
Goodbye, Dorothy.

947
01:40:03,806 --> 01:40:07,584
Oh, no. I mean, I didn't
expect to go so soon.

948
01:40:07,684 --> 01:40:11,005
I haven't really said goodbye yet.

949
01:40:11,781 --> 01:40:13,382
Goodbye, Cowardly Lion.

950
01:40:13,482 --> 01:40:16,593
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- Tik-Tok.

951
01:40:16,693 --> 01:40:18,846
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

952
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:20,431
I'll never forget any of you.

953
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:22,548
Give my love to all the chickens.

954
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:27,187
- Dorothy...
- I love you so much.

955
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:29,732
- Farewell!
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

956
01:40:29,832 --> 01:40:31,608
Farewell, Dorothy!

957
01:40:31,708 --> 01:40:34,028
- It's so bright.
- Goodbye, Dorothy.

958
01:40:34,128 --> 01:40:38,240
- Goodbye, Dorothy.
- I love you all! Goodbye!

959
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:41,243
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Dorothy.

960
01:40:50,394 --> 01:40:53,380
Goodbye! Goodbye!

961
01:41:19,715 --> 01:41:23,192
Goodbye. Bye.

962
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:30,157
Goodbye.

963
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:57,476
Toto?

964
01:42:00,631 --> 01:42:02,732
Toto!

965
01:42:04,152 --> 01:42:05,484
Toto!

966
01:42:07,796 --> 01:42:10,679
Toto! Toto!

967
01:42:16,605 --> 01:42:18,205
Dorothy?

968
01:42:18,649 --> 01:42:20,300
Dorothy?

969
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,343
Dorothy!

970
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:27,224
Oh, are you all right?

971
01:42:27,324 --> 01:42:29,550
Toto found me.

972
01:42:30,482 --> 01:42:33,596
I'd almost given up hope.

973
01:42:42,005 --> 01:42:44,357
Up you go, sweetheart.

974
01:42:45,801 --> 01:42:47,777
It's Dorothy!

975
01:42:48,804 --> 01:42:53,333
The clinic was hit by lightning
and it burned to the ground.

976
01:42:53,433 --> 01:42:56,086
Everybody was rescued
except Dr. Worley.

977
01:42:56,186 --> 01:42:59,038
He ran in to rescue his machines.

978
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:06,462
Mornin', all.

979
01:43:32,014 --> 01:43:33,489
Hi, hon.

980
01:43:56,747 --> 01:43:58,180
Ozma.

981
01:44:05,472 --> 01:44:07,189
Aunt Em, come and look!

982
01:44:07,749 --> 01:44:10,242
What is it, darling? I'm busy.

983
01:44:12,095 --> 01:44:14,613
Nothing. Just a reflection.

984
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,878
What is it, Dorothy?

985
01:44:36,745 --> 01:44:39,555
It's nice to have a room
of your own, isn't it?

986
01:44:40,957 --> 01:44:43,184
Put the mirror straight, sweetheart.

987
01:44:57,808 --> 01:45:00,034
Come on, you two.

988
01:45:00,936 --> 01:45:03,996
It's too nice a day to stay inside.

989
01:45:04,314 --> 01:45:05,442
Come on, Toto.

990
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:29,156
Toto, come on!

991
01:45:35,637 --> 01:45:37,780
Good dog!
