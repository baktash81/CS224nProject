1
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,119
Awful soft dirt in here.
Make sure you shore it up good.

2
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:28,500
It's like working inside a cow down here.

3
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:34,298
Una vaca plata
that is going to pay off my ranch.

4
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:37,060
Your ranch.

5
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:40,476
It's like a woman.
It's all you ever talk about.

6
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,647
Meanwhile, she's taking all your money.

7
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:47,232
And you, you spend
all of your money on whiskey.

8
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:50,144
But you're going to miss me soon.

9
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:57,159
Victor?

10
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:10,256
Victor?

11
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,929
Jefe. Jefe.

12
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:24,429
Jefe, Victor is gone.

13
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:28,355
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- We were working the face.

14
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,935
I know he couldn't have got past me.

15
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:34,234
But now he's just gone.

16
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:36,484
Jefe! Jefe!

17
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,826
Aaaaargh!

18
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,786
Dammit.

19
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:50,996
Juan! Where are ya?

20
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,093
So many people leaving.

21
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,468
Is everyone rejecting us?

22
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:30,476
No, Fu Yien. They are leaving
because the mine is closed.

23
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:35,558
Maybe we need a different name.

24
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:41,819
- Perhaps it was not the best choice, huh?
- Maybe not.

25
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,949
Son...

26
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:05,633
Juan Pedilla, you've been looking at
that hat for a month. Buy it or don't buy it.

27
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,847
No, no. I can't afford it.

28
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:10,094
You take it on credit. Pay us later.

29
00:05:10,188 --> 00:05:12,061
No credit!

30
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:15,065
Stan Kelton is leaving.
Loading up his wagon.

31
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:19,445
Stan too? Now we're a town
without a blacksmith.

32
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:23,399
It'll end up as a ghost town
if that mine doesn't reopen.

33
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:26,198
If everybody leaves,
who will buy our things?

34
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:29,573
No one.
And we'll go back to China.

35
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:33,996
Only way you going back to China
is if you learn how to swim.

36
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,584
What does I Ching say?

37
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:43,424
"Expect arrival of great conqueror."

38
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:59,272
The mine will not stay closed. That ore is
turning out a hundred ounces to the ton.

39
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,446
- Two hundred, my friend.
- Two hundred?

40
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:06,399
Well, nobody's walking away
from riches like that.

41
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:08,285
Nobody.

42
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:12,499
Well, if you saw what I saw,
you might walk away.

43
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:15,501
You never really told us what you saw.

44
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,745
I saw nothing.

45
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,753
But the nothing, it was worse
than anything I have ever seen.

46
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:24,678
You're not thinking of pulling out too?

47
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:26,920
No, I cannot do that.

48
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:30,430
- I would lose everything, like you.
- Like all of us.

49
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:33,269
Listen. It's about the mine.

50
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:37,683
The owner of the mine is coming.
All the way from Philadelphia.

51
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:41,143
He say "Low profit
from mine unacceptable."

52
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:43,609
"Proceeding with all dispatch."

53
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:48,075
"Will take matters into hand personally.
Signed, Hiram Gummer."

54
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,733
That's a real two-dollar name.

55
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,785
I'll wager he gets this thing solved faster
than a bee with a horse on its tail. Betcha.

56
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:26,356
The stage is coming! It's coming!

57
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:35,236
Tecopa! Miss Christine!
The stage, it's coming!

58
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,606
- What do you think he looks like?
- He's probably fat.

59
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,856
Rich people are always fat.

60
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,407
Oh, my word.

61
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:16,614
- Anybody in there?
- It's full of luggage.

62
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,664
- It's about time.
- Indeed it is.

63
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,047
- Let me in.
- Can't wait to leave this place.

64
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,511
No one got out.

65
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,734
Mr. Hiram Gummer?

66
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:59,872
I am he.

67
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,541
I am Tsang Pyong Lien.
Pyong Chang.

68
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,416
This is my market.

69
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:08,879
- You're not very fat.
- Quiet!

70
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,247
Whooee.

71
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:14,673
You must have enough money
to burn a wet mule, huh?

72
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,632
Mr. Gummer, I'm Christine Lord.
Proprietress of the local hotel.

73
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,015
You're lovelier than Fifth Avenue in spring.

74
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:24,021
- Welcome to Rejection.
- Aptly named, it would seem.

75
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:29,730
I'm here to see Andrew Beckwith. I've sent
him three communiquå»¥, all unanswered.

76
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:33,521
- I want to speak to him forthwith.
- That might prove difficult.

77
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:37,448
- Why? Where is he?
- On that. The last stage out of here.

78
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:39,410
Wh?

79
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:45,450
- That's just dandy. The last?
- Too few passengers.

80
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:49,756
The mine closed several weeks ago.
That is why you're here, isn't it?

81
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:56,092
Closed? The mine closed? I feel I've not
been privy to most needful information.

82
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,670
You don't know
what happens at the mine?

83
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:03,178
17 miners were killed in one day.
The workers abandoned it.

84
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,895
17? What on earth happened?

85
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,472
- No one knows.
- Must you speak in riddles?

86
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:11,779
- The only one who knows is Juan Pedilla.
- Then I must see him straightaway.

87
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:15,908
Well, he's out riding his land.
We expect him back shortly. Please.

88
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:19,824
You must be tired from your traveling.
Let me show you to the hotel.

89
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:24,574
Oh, very well.
Come, I'll need assistance with my kit.

90
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:32,539
This is our bank. Closed, of course.

91
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,176
Our blacksmith, also closed.

92
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,054
- And our post office.
- Closed.

93
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,555
- Of course.
- Quite the bustling metropolis.

94
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:52,024
- "Great conqueror".
- And this is my hotel. Welcome.

95
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,777
Right this way.

96
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,248
An impressive arsenal.
Are you a collector?

97
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:12,006
The miners came west to strike it rich.

98
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:17,675
When it came time to settle their bills,
many of them had only their firearms left.

99
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:23,432
- Now I collect payments daily.
- Nonsense. Just keep a running tab.

100
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:30,147
Your man is rather impudent.

101
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,435
Tecopa is not my "man". He is my friend.

102
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,406
But this is a tent.

103
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:46,987
Yes. You're observant.
Which would you like?

104
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,748
This one right here.

105
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:53,292
Dandy.
What time will luncheon be served?

106
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:57,248
Well, since the mine has closed
the supply wagons have stopped,

107
00:11:57,343 --> 00:12:01,126
so our menu's a bit limited.
I could fix you a pot of beans.

108
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:08,103
Nonsense. Surely you have flour,
molasses and ginger?

109
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:12,599
I should like a gingerbread cake.
Yes, that should do nicely.

110
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:18,027
You want me to strangle him?

111
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,604
No, we need him.

112
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:34,164
Delightful music and a passable meal.
Which I should like to end with an aperitif.

113
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,542
Wouldn't we all?

114
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:41,423
Fu Yien, would you like
that last piece of gingerbread?

115
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,460
Yes.

116
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:46,931
Then go to my small carpet bag, the blue
one, and fetch my bottle of peach brandy.

117
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,092
Yes, sir.

118
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,415
- What happened to the gingerbread?
- I ate it, of course.

119
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,416
- But you said I could...
- A word of advice, young man.

120
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:19,841
Anyone can be taken advantage of,
and if you can, do.

121
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,213
That is terrible advice to give a child.

122
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,549
The boy must learn
the ways of the world.

123
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,312
I assure you, he knows them.

124
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,396
- Juan's here. He's over at the store.
- "Juan"?

125
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,518
Juan Pedilla, the miner.

126
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,065
Oh. Yes, yes.

127
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,988
No, no, no, no.
The mine is not played out. Not at all.

128
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:50,821
There's plenty more silver in there.
It's just no one wants to go in and get it.

129
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,365
Seven more men go up since accident.
None come back.

130
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,587
My ancestors talked of spirit beasts
that live inside those mountains.

131
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,834
"Spirit beasts"?

132
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,505
Beasts from the underworld.
Blind to all but killing.

133
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,677
Have you all taken leave of your senses?

134
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:15,301
Juan, gather up the remaining miners,
hunt down whatever is doing this...

135
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:20,189
And fill 'em full of more holes
than a cabbage leaf in a hailstorm.

136
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,355
Precisely.

137
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:27,030
Seé³r Gummer, there are some miners
camped north of town. I can talk to them.

138
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:32,702
But they are not going to go back unless
you pay them. Maybe even double wages.

139
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:39,206
- Pay them? To earn their own jobs back?
- I'm just telling you, they are scared.

140
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:44,799
Very well. To ensure my resources are not
squandered by this cabal of hooligans,

141
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,134
I shall accompany you myself,
first thing in the morning.

142
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,759
Now you're talking. What kind of gun
did you bring? Betcha it's big and fancy.

143
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,224
I don't own a firearm.

144
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,396
Yes?

145
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:13,031
This is the Wild West, Mr. Gummer.
You don't read the dime novels?

146
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,908
You see a bad guy,
you gotta smoke him up.

147
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,965
Seé³r Gummer, your horse is ready.

148
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,169
Seé³r Gummer...

149
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,340
Morning.

150
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:42,555
Seé³r, it is a hard day's ride
over very rough country. Uh...

151
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,940
This is the cross-country model.
The horse can carry my kit. Off we go!

152
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,910
Deplorable road conditions.

153
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,835
Um...

154
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,926
No, no, I'd like some, uh...

155
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,347
Maybe just... Thank you.
Ah, very good.

156
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:25,979
I haven't been on a horse since I...
since my sixth birthday party.

157
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,641
No, actually, that was a camel.

158
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,909
- Mr. Gummer?
- Yes?

159
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,905
- This is for you.
- I beg your pardon?

160
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,042
This is the Wild West. Never go unarmed.

161
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,955
No, indeed, um...
Thank you, son. Thank you.

162
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,670
You really think
he is "great conqueror"?

163
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,432
Only if he rides a camel
better than he rides a horse.

164
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:01,722
Let's not judge yet, Tecopa.
He's the only chance we have.

165
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,781
Howdy, gents.

166
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:40,423
- This is our army?
- These are the only ones willing to go.

167
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:44,809
All the better.
No need to waste my money on cowards.

168
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,980
Men, this is the patré®,
Mr. Hiram Gummer.

169
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,269
These are the Walter brothers,
Brick and Stony.

170
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,196
- This is Big Horse Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson.

171
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,568
And this is Soggy.

172
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,365
Soggy?

173
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,986
Indeed.

174
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,541
Well, in you go.

175
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,335
- And what?
- And report back to me.

176
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:24,684
Oh, very well.

177
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,470
As none of you possess
sufficient leadership skills,

178
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,183
I shall supervise the endeavor myself.
Juan?

179
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,437
Vå«¥onos.

180
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:03,970
- Wait.
- That was our foreman.

181
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,343
My hat.

182
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,269
Urgh.

183
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:19,067
Here. He ain't gonna need it.

184
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:22,487
Try it on.

185
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,909
Thank you,jefe.

186
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,632
Oh, my.

187
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:58,152
This is the end of the mine,
where Victor was.

188
00:19:58,237 --> 00:20:01,985
Well, we're still alive.

189
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,238
Whatever attacked you,
it would seem to be gone.

190
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,256
Gentlemen,
I declare this mine perfectly safe.

191
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:21,128
Dang right.
Ain't nothin' in there but ghosts.

192
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:23,708
You don't need to pay them no wages.

193
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:26,508
I pray that we are correct.

194
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:36,767
Well, sun's gettin' low.
Might as well set up camp.

195
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:43,019
We can't camp here.

196
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,991
I need trees.

197
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,596
It's better for the posture.

198
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:27,488
Oh, damn.
You gonna start torturing that thing?

199
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:29,983
Helps me sleep.

200
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:36,368
- And the horses like it too.
- Well, go play it for them.

201
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:42,544
Ain't my fault you lack a musical ear.

202
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,148
How soon do you think
you can reopen the mine?

203
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:03,181
Posthaste. The sooner the better.

204
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:04,902
Good.

205
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:09,982
Because I need to keep working
if I don't want to lose my ranch.

206
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:12,531
I thought you were a miner.

207
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:19,418
Well, I am a miner, but my father always
dreamed of having a ranch for us one day.

208
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,209
And?

209
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:26,337
He was killed in a cave-in
when I was a boy.

210
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:31,586
My mother, she moved us
from mining camp to mining camp.

211
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:37,683
They always need a woman
to do the laundry and the cooking.

212
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,521
I've been without my cook for weeks.

213
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:48,312
You always had everything, didn't you?

214
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:50,943
Several of everything.

215
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:54,781
I'd just like to get one of something.

216
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,239
What on earth?

217
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:12,550
Aw, damn.
We'll be hours finding them horses.

218
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:15,212
Soggy, you sorry sack!

219
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,474
- I'm gonna pound you blue!
- Easy, everybody.

220
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:25,810
You pound 'im, Brick!
Aw, he's always fartin' around.

221
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:30,733
Where the hell are you?

222
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,573
It won't do you no good hidin'!

223
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,700
ãå«®late!

224
00:23:38,581 --> 00:23:41,368
You hear that?

225
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:43,202
Soggy!

226
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:46,912
The longer I look, the madder I get!

227
00:23:47,006 --> 00:23:48,713
Aaargh!

228
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,550
- Good Lord! What the?
- Tarnation!

229
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:57,926
Brick? You all right?

230
00:23:58,017 --> 00:24:01,136
Stony, don't you go
shooting blind out there!

231
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,809
Brick!

232
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:05,937
Well, where is he?

233
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,515
Don't know. He ain't out there.

234
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:12,854
Who's there?

235
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:18,278
Who's over there?
We've got guns over here.

236
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:39,178
Wh... wh...

237
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:41,936
What in God's name?

238
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:08,206
You gotta shoot faster! Kill them, man!

239
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,923
- We gotta get up somewhere!
- Where?

240
00:25:22,017 --> 00:25:24,342
Over on that rock!

241
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:37,399
Seé³r Gummer!
Over here on the rock! On the rock!

242
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,823
Big Horse! Over here!
You gotta get off the ground!

243
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,237
Big Horse! Here!

244
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:52,711
- No! Big Horse, you can't shoot it!
- This way, man! Quickly!

245
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:55,548
Get on the rock!

246
00:26:26,623 --> 00:26:29,113
Good heavens.

247
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:31,782
What a dreadful odor.

248
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,294
I smelled it in the mine.

249
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:39,383
It was them.

250
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:42,386
They came up through the soft dirt.

251
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:45,259
At least it can't penetrate rock.

252
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,947
It has no eyes.

253
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:06,404
How did they find us?

254
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:23,799
It's the sound. Every time
we made a sound. Even your teapot.

255
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:26,295
That's how they hunt.

256
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:34,059
We can't just stay here.

257
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:41,484
These foothills are made of rock. We can
walk on them all the way to Rejection.

258
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:45,072
- Walk?
- Well, unless you can fly.

259
00:28:16,774 --> 00:28:19,525
Tecopa, what are you doing?

260
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,645
Diggin' a spot for a flagpole.

261
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:28,076
A flagpole? Does it concern you
that Nevada hasn't yet adopted a flag?

262
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,825
We will one day. I'll be ready.

263
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:54,215
They're back! They're back!
It's Juan and Mr. Gummer! They're back!

264
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:58,427
I'd have walked twice that far to get away.

265
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:01,476
Those are the most savagerous beasts
I've ever seen.

266
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,565
Well, didn't you let loose?
Let fly? Barrels blazing?

267
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:08,739
Old Fred, you don't understand.

268
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:14,245
When they're not underground,
they're... flying. Very fast.

269
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:19,581
- Dragons. Dirt dragons.
- We never had them in China.

270
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,584
Big Horse, Juan -
they tried to shoot them but couldn't.

271
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:27,837
You'd have to be
an unparalleled shootist.

272
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:32,424
But wait, that's it. A telegram.
We must send a telegram immediately.

273
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:34,674
Let me do it. I know how.

274
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:35,847
Here.

275
00:29:35,936 --> 00:29:39,684
"Wanted - gunfighter."

276
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:44,933
"Town of Rejection, Nevada,
seeks experienced quick-draw artist,

277
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,698
calm in face of danger."

278
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:50,188
"Salary negotiable."

279
00:29:50,284 --> 00:29:55,360
Send that to the Territorial Enterprise,
the Denver Post and the Wichita Eagle.

280
00:29:55,455 --> 00:30:00,033
- You're going to hire a gunfighter?
- I think that is a good idea.

281
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:06,082
But is it wise?
A gunfighter's usually mean, wild...

282
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:09,632
Drink, shoot inside house...

283
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:14,464
- But we need someone with fortitude.
- Someone with a little fan in their craw.

284
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,808
Exactly. Someone who is
proficient with firearms who can...

285
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:20,930
Shoot the nuts off a squirrel
at a hundred paces.

286
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,809
- Thank you.
- Someone like Doc Holliday.

287
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,274
- Except one that ain't dead.
- Doc Holliday's dead?

288
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:31,901
OK, it's done.

289
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:34,481
Now we wait.

290
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:46,873
- Handsome, no?
- Oh, very.

291
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:49,419
It's me.

292
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:52,046
Very few men have statues of themselves.

293
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:54,923
A cigar-store Indian?

294
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:59,261
Oh, a salesman gave that to me
when he couldn't pay his bill.

295
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:02,686
Well, it could be me.

296
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:37,887
- Mr. Gummer, I fixed your wheel.
- Impossible, it's a complete loss.

297
00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:39,218
Nope.

298
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:50,185
Well, I... My, my, that's...

299
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:57,900
Remarkable. Um... Thank you.
Thank you very much.

300
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,829
That'll be five dollars, please.

301
00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:05,206
Now listen here. No workman
would dare ask more than two bits.

302
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:09,585
I'm the only wheel-fixer in town.
No one else till Carson City.

303
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:13,716
- But that's highway robbery.
- A word of advice, Mr. Gummer.

304
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:18,047
Anyone can be taken advantage of.
And if you can, do.

305
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,235
Fu Yien, I'm a trifle short of cash
at present. May we barter instead?

306
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:38,438
For services rendered,
you may have the bicycle.

307
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:41,534
It's yours.
I'm becoming quite the expert horseman.

308
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:44,028
Dandy, Mr. Gummer!

309
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,993
There you go.

310
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:52,461
No, um...
Oh, here, here, here, here.

311
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:54,789
I'll steady you. Get your balance.

312
00:32:54,884 --> 00:33:01,218
Now, when I push, press the pedals
and keep the front wheel straight. Ready?

313
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:03,133
Off you go.

314
00:33:10,316 --> 00:33:11,940
Not bad.

315
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:18,817
Not bad at all.

316
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:43,628
How long is this bedlam to last?

317
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:47,720
Oh, a few more days.
We're deepening our well.

318
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:52,354
We're quite proud of our engine. It's going
to run our electric lights one day.

319
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,817
- If you can abide the racket.
- The work would go faster if you'd help.

320
00:33:56,903 --> 00:34:01,066
A man of my means
doesn't engage in physical labor.

321
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:03,529
Which brings us...

322
00:34:04,452 --> 00:34:06,740
to your bill.

323
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:11,748
- You're running a tab.
- I didn't agree to that.

324
00:34:11,835 --> 00:34:18,039
Mrs. Lord, in any civilized place
my name alone is quite sufficient.

325
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:22,878
Well, out here in the rough-and-tumble
West, we tend to use cash.

326
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:26,719
That is a twenty-dollar gold piece
on your watch fob, isn't it?

327
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:29,892
And the watch itself is gold, of course?

328
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:33,809
And the cufflinks? Genuine diamonds?

329
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:38,770
Are you proposing that I barter with you
as I would a street vendor in Calcutta?

330
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:41,531
Don't be absurd.
You will run a proper tab

331
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:48,234
until this pathetic town has a proper bank
to which I can wire funds.

332
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:46,845
Here, now. What is going on?
Why aren't you riding that wheel?

333
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:51,306
No time. I'm working.

334
00:35:51,393 --> 00:35:54,310
You men will take forever.
Using a boy to do a man's work?

335
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:57,597
Very narrow down there.

336
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,604
He's the only one
small enough to widen it.

337
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:08,241
The moment it is wide enough, I expect
to see one of you down there in his place.

338
00:36:08,326 --> 00:36:11,113
And he back on that bicycle.

339
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:24,957
Mrs. Lord, I should like to apologize.

340
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,507
The truth is,

341
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:34,182
my coin, watch and cufflinks
are all I own in the world.

342
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:38,385
I beg your pardon?

343
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,223
My father, in his final demented days,

344
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:48,773
sold all his holdings and invested
everything, the entire family fortune,

345
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:51,356
in a certain silver mine.

346
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,072
I see.

347
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:58,579
I was rude earlier. I apologize.

348
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:02,082
Once I get the mine running,
I'll pay my bill in full

349
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,254
and be on the first stage out of here.

350
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,399
As Old Fred would say,
that's a real gullywasher.

351
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:29,986
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

352
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:33,692
I hope Old Fred made it
to the muling station before this hit.

353
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:37,154
Yesterday a desert, today a monsoon.

354
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:42,449
Once I reopen the mine,
the whole town will prosper.

355
00:37:42,544 --> 00:37:46,790
You'll be able to afford
whatever your hearts desire.

356
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:50,048
And what is it that your heart desires,
Mr. Gummer?

357
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,423
To return to the life I had.

358
00:37:52,513 --> 00:37:57,554
To wake up every morning and wonder
"What will I spend my money on today?"

359
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:06,558
I'd venture it matters not how you spend
your money, but how you spend your life.

360
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:10,020
- Mr. Gummer?
- Don't interrupt your elders.

361
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:12,813
Never you mind, Miss Lord.

362
00:38:12,908 --> 00:38:17,735
I'll amend my misspent life
when the Grim Reaper comes calling.

363
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:41,221
I recommend that
you keep that hog leg skinned,

364
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:46,731
unless you got a desire to be
jumpin' over hot coals in hell.

365
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:52,774
And who might you be, sir?

366
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,354
- Kelly.
- "Black Hand" Kelly?

367
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:01,996
I'm lookin' for Hiram Gummer.

368
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,498
That would be me.

369
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:10,500
- You posted yourself an advertisement?
- I did. Yes, I did.

370
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:14,587
So who do you want me to kill?
That Injun over there?

371
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,709
No, no, no, no.

372
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:20,300
It's not so much a "who" as a "what".

373
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:27,344
They spring from the ground like, uh...
like some demonic trout.

374
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,440
We call them "dirt dragons".

375
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:35,779
This stuff sure must be
a whole lot stronger than it tastes.

376
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:42,116
We're well aware that it sounds fantastic,
but we can assure you it's all quite true.

377
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:50,582
- They're ferocious and fast.
- It takes real backbone to face 'em down.

378
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:54,834
Amigo, I like to fight with rattlesnakes
just for the fun of it,

379
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,425
and I give 'em first bite to boot.

380
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:03,173
Hyperbole aside,
you are accurate with a firearm?

381
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,679
- Questioning my abilities, sir?
- As an astute businessman, I'm simply...

382
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,930
Hey, boy!

383
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:14,981
- Toss me one of them apples over here.
- See, I knew it. Shoot inside house.

384
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,739
- Throw it high?
- No, no, no.

385
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:22,991
- You throw it right straight at me.
- OK.

386
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:26,411
- You ready?
- Anytime.

387
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:41,130
- What?
- We thought you shoot apple.

388
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:44,922
Obviously we were expecting
to see a demonstration of...

389
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,487
You're hired.

390
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,948
- In China, no one shoots in wall.
- In China, no one has gun.

391
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:18,215
Before I sign up for anything, talk to me
about that "salary negotiable" part.

392
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:23,675
Do you like silver, Mr. Kelly?

393
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,471
I reckon I do.

394
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:28,760
Upon dispatching all the
aforementioned creatures,

395
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:32,351
and upon the reopening of the mine,
you'll be paid in silver.

396
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:36,650
Say, um... as much as you can carry
on a strong horse?

397
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:43,401
Well, now, I just bet that you could
charm a cow right out of her calf

398
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:45,899
with those fancy words.

399
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:51,236
But now, for myself, I sorta need
a little something up front.

400
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:55,373
We don't have any money.

401
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:00,964
Ah, well.

402
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,624
Thank you for your time.

403
00:42:12,187 --> 00:42:14,974
Double eagle.

404
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,638
A down payment.

405
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:28,691
Tell you what. You throw in
them there cufflinks and, uh...

406
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:31,704
you got yourself a deal.

407
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:59,515
This is one sorry collection
of lead pushers you got here.

408
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:02,230
I'm not running a gun store, Mr. Kelly.

409
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:08,105
Juan, you take this here big old 45-70.

410
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:13,575
Hiram, pick yourself out
something that feels right in your hand.

411
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:20,581
And you give us all these
blue whistlers that you got.

412
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:23,837
Juan.

413
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:28,923
- Take this.
- Oh, pero no. I still can't afford it.

414
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:32,512
No credit. It's a gift.

415
00:43:34,602 --> 00:43:37,519
Gracias.

416
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:39,015
What?

417
00:43:39,106 --> 00:43:42,106
No one goes without a hat in China.

418
00:43:42,193 --> 00:43:44,898
OK, boys, let's jingle some spurs.

419
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:49,151
No. No. No spurs.
In fact, no jingling of any kind.

420
00:44:25,403 --> 00:44:29,186
I tell you, these things are attracted
by the slightest noise.

421
00:44:29,282 --> 00:44:32,900
They could leap from the ground
at any moment.

422
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:38,204
Juan killed one right here.

423
00:44:59,978 --> 00:45:02,053
Shh, shh, shh.

424
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,619
Cuç®ate, seé³r.

425
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,827
There ain't nothin' here neither.

426
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:27,535
Maybe they gone deaf.

427
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:33,000
Or maybe you two boys
are playing me for the fool.

428
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:35,799
After what I paid you?

429
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:43,557
- We will just have to keep looking.
- Juan, if you please, some help.

430
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:50,273
Gummer, dag nab it,
ain't you got no pride?

431
00:45:50,362 --> 00:45:53,066
Get up on the horse by yourself!

432
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:59,110
Should I ever again require horsemanship,
I will engage a tutor.

433
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,377
Well, I'll tell you one thing. I ain't got
your book-learning, but I know this:

434
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:09,829
Being full-growed don't make you a man.

435
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:23,094
Look, look, look, look.

436
00:46:24,312 --> 00:46:26,387
Here, here.

437
00:46:34,489 --> 00:46:38,486
They appear to be... shells. Eggs.

438
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:42,578
Well, if that's what they are...

439
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:48,332
then they came out of one big chicken.

440
00:46:49,462 --> 00:46:54,752
Or maybe you two aren't as crazy
as I've been thinking.

441
00:46:55,301 --> 00:47:00,177
This is where we pipe
the hot spring from the mine.

442
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:05,507
The water cut through the dirt, you see?
And the eggs fell out.

443
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:08,688
Perhaps the warm water hatched them.

444
00:47:08,774 --> 00:47:12,308
Juan, this tells us how many there are.

445
00:47:12,861 --> 00:47:15,565
There are four. And I killed one already.

446
00:47:15,655 --> 00:47:18,655
- Three left.
- But where could they have gone?

447
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:22,739
Well, we're just gonna keep on ridin'
till we find them,

448
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:28,701
cos I'm gettin' awful anxious
to unravel me some cartridges.

449
00:47:34,924 --> 00:47:38,174
We piped that hot water out
only six months ago.

450
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:42,424
Then those creatures
grew large quite quickly.

451
00:47:50,398 --> 00:47:56,103
That's a part of one of them.
These scaly things were on their backs.

452
00:47:59,115 --> 00:48:02,281
Yeah? Well...

453
00:48:02,368 --> 00:48:06,697
Maybe one of them there "things" died.

454
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:11,664
Or maybe... maybe he shed his skin,
like a snake.

455
00:48:11,752 --> 00:48:14,539
Who is that?

456
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:22,095
It's Old Fred. At least, that's his wagon.

457
00:48:30,312 --> 00:48:32,768
Good Lord.

458
00:48:32,857 --> 00:48:35,561
This does not bode well.

459
00:48:47,121 --> 00:48:51,367
Now, that is one
catawampussly chawed-up rig.

460
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:56,251
As I keep say... saying,
these things are not to be trifled with.

461
00:48:57,465 --> 00:48:59,540
Old Fred?

462
00:49:02,553 --> 00:49:04,628
Old Fred?

463
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:09,508
Old Fred?

464
00:49:47,222 --> 00:49:49,795
Maybe we should have made it longer.

465
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:53,010
Well, I'm not totin' no more rocks.

466
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:59,271
- We should say something.
- I didn't even know the man.

467
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,932
Take off your hat.

468
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:10,449
Fred was an old man.

469
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:13,989
That is why we called him Old Fred.

470
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,995
He drove the freight.

471
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:21,870
He had bad breath.
But I don't want to say that.

472
00:50:21,966 --> 00:50:24,373
All right. All right.

473
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:30,758
"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,

474
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:34,134
Nor the furious winter's rages."

475
00:50:34,228 --> 00:50:37,561
"Thou thy worldly task hast done,

476
00:50:38,232 --> 00:50:41,102
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages."

477
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:45,691
Cymbeline. Act four, scene two.

478
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,987
We'd best get going.

479
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:51,574
- Wait. Let's make camp here.
- No, we'll go to the ridge.

480
00:50:51,661 --> 00:50:54,946
Camp on solid rock.
As we have every night.

481
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,989
Oh, no. That is three miles back there.
That's hard country.

482
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:02,288
If you think I'd risk
sleeping on the naked earth...

483
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,876
We could go down to the muling station.
Down the canyon.

484
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:08,675
- Is it safe?
- Yes.

485
00:51:08,762 --> 00:51:14,634
There are thick beams on the floor for the
wagons. The dragons can't break through.

486
00:51:33,244 --> 00:51:36,244
- Might there be someone here?
- No.

487
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,702
They stopped the supply wagons
now that...

488
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:42,456
Now that the mine is closed.
The bitter refrain of my life, it seems.

489
00:51:42,545 --> 00:51:47,089
We must secure these horses with
certainty. The last time, they got away.

490
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:51,124
You just make sure
that gate is tied up tight.

491
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:30,292
Mr. Kelly!

492
00:52:32,637 --> 00:52:38,176
You can't see the door
if you're facing this direction.

493
00:52:38,267 --> 00:52:40,971
Always be prepared.

494
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:45,906
Aaargh! ï¹å«®vame, Dios!

495
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:52,925
What in God's name?

496
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,682
- So was that them?
- No.

497
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,640
No.

498
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:11,602
Something new.

499
00:54:26,625 --> 00:54:28,950
You said to pick one
I was comfortable with.

500
00:54:29,044 --> 00:54:33,290
You're right. I did say that.

501
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:39,876
What in Sam Hill is that smell?

502
00:54:40,513 --> 00:54:44,296
It's them. That's the smell.
Remember, seé³r?

503
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:48,175
But they've changed so.
Become long and thin.

504
00:54:48,271 --> 00:54:51,271
There's six of them,

505
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:53,266
or even nine.

506
00:54:54,193 --> 00:54:56,649
We'd better bring the horses inside.

507
00:54:58,407 --> 00:54:59,949
ãhingada!

508
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:02,155
They're gone! Again!

509
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:07,655
We can't go on foot.
They'll get us for sure.

510
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:10,915
All right. All right.

511
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:14,952
That means we have to
stand our ground here.

512
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:20,089
Hiram, it's about time you learned
how to use a real piece.

513
00:55:20,178 --> 00:55:24,389
That's your job.
If I need a gun fired, I hire a gunman.

514
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:27,593
If you want to bed down
with a real pretty woman,

515
00:55:27,686 --> 00:55:30,603
I s'pose you just
hire somebody to do that too.

516
00:55:30,689 --> 00:55:33,689
Spare me your tiresome analogies.

517
00:55:33,775 --> 00:55:34,973
Hiram.

518
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:38,982
Now, I said this once,
and I'm gonna say it one more time.

519
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:45,608
There are some things a man has to do for
himself, and right now shootin' is one.

520
00:55:45,703 --> 00:55:51,408
And give me that stupid hideout piece.
It ain't gonna do you no good now.

521
00:55:55,922 --> 00:56:01,212
OK, Juan, you keep your eye peeled
for them there snake things.

522
00:56:01,302 --> 00:56:06,259
Pay attention, Hiram.
Now, this is a single-action Colt Army.

523
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:09,682
This is the finest wheel gun ever made.

524
00:56:11,479 --> 00:56:15,097
Don't be holdin' it like it's some skunk.

525
00:56:15,191 --> 00:56:20,861
Now, it's an extension of your hand, OK?
It's part of you.

526
00:56:20,946 --> 00:56:24,231
- And take a stance, like you mean it.
- Mean what?

527
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:28,702
Like you mean that every last lead plum
that comes out of that barrel

528
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:31,360
is gonna kill whatever you aim at.

529
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:36,001
OK. OK. Take yourself a shot
at that can over there by the window.

530
00:56:36,087 --> 00:56:39,420
You line up this blade with this notch

531
00:56:39,507 --> 00:56:44,168
then you just squeeze the trigger.
You don't jerk it.

532
00:56:55,606 --> 00:57:00,563
It's all right. They cannot
break through the floor beams.

533
00:57:00,653 --> 00:57:07,616
Now, you just relax, you just let your eyes,
your brain, your hand, your trigger finger,

534
00:57:07,702 --> 00:57:10,371
all becomes one.

535
00:57:18,504 --> 00:57:21,173
It's all right.
You got consistency now.

536
00:57:21,257 --> 00:57:25,206
- This is a waste of time!
- What do you expect?

537
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:28,967
You wanna learn in 20 minutes
what took me 20 years?

538
00:57:58,835 --> 00:58:03,164
They cannot break through the floor,
so they are tearing it apart.

539
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:05,711
How could a snake be so strong?

540
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,969
- Look at that. They decoyed us.
- Good Lord. How smart are they?

541
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:20,521
Estï¿½ malo. We're gonna have
nothing left to stand on.

542
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,193
- Telegraph?
- It is no good for us.

543
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,404
- We don't know the clicking code.
- Click anything. Someone will hear us.

544
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,500
I don't know what it is.
It's not Morse.

545
00:58:50,595 --> 00:58:53,382
It's been going on
for more than an hour?

546
00:58:53,473 --> 00:58:57,684
Maybe a tree is touching the wire.
That happened before.

547
00:58:57,769 --> 00:58:59,311
This is different.

548
00:58:59,396 --> 00:59:05,765
The telegrapher at Carson City wouldn't
allow foolishness with his equipment.

549
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,272
- Maybe not Carson City.
- Not Carson City? Where else?

550
00:59:19,165 --> 00:59:22,284
This is from Carson City.

551
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,336
Where's that one from?

552
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:39,554
This is from the muling station. It must be
Mr. Gummer. He's the only one out there.

553
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:43,095
- When will Tecopa and Pyong be back?
- One, two days.

554
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:45,645
Gone upcountry. Getting firewood.

555
00:59:45,734 --> 00:59:48,853
All right then. I'll go myself.

556
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:55,743
Must you tap so loudly?

557
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:11,207
Let your lead fly, man!

558
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:51,248
What the hell are we up against?

559
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,913
They... they grew.

560
01:00:55,010 --> 01:01:01,048
Those snakes are not snakes.
They are tongues. Three tongues!

561
01:01:01,141 --> 01:01:05,849
- Each creature has three tongues.
- And we saw nine before.

562
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:12,683
- So there's still only three animals.
- That's supposed to make me feel better?

563
01:01:12,778 --> 01:01:16,727
Good God, man, those things are
the size of eight-mule freight wagons!

564
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:22,328
- Well, shoot them, like you're hired to do!
- You got to know your enemy, Hiram!

565
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:28,241
I oughta be totin' some eight-bore
firin' solid shot.

566
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:32,713
Or some damn punt gun.
Not these weapons I got.

567
01:01:38,137 --> 01:01:41,054
All right. All right.

568
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:44,508
I tell ya what we're gonna do.
We're gonna... we're gonna...

569
01:01:44,602 --> 01:01:47,389
We're gonna hold our fire
till they come after us.

570
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:53,150
And then... and then we're gonna go
toe to toe, point blank, full bore,

571
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:55,607
throw all the lead we got at 'em.

572
01:01:55,696 --> 01:02:00,274
And then maybe we'll get a... a lucky hit.

573
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,774
A brain shot or something.

574
01:02:24,182 --> 01:02:29,721
- There is not much floor left.
- They'll be makin' their move anytime.

575
01:02:35,777 --> 01:02:38,065
Get ready.

576
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:41,071
This may be it.

577
01:02:58,717 --> 01:03:02,251
Now what are they up to?

578
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:11,349
Oh, no!

579
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:13,062
Mr. Kelly!

580
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:19,148
Eat this!

581
01:03:59,944 --> 01:04:01,319
I'm out! I'm out!

582
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:05,109
Christine is coming, Seé³r Gummer!

583
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:06,858
Christine! Over here!

584
01:04:20,715 --> 01:04:22,754
Just drive the wagon!

585
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:27,302
- Where's Mr. Kelly?
- Dead. Go on! Go on! Go!

586
01:04:32,142 --> 01:04:35,511
Well done, Mrs. Lord!
Are they following us?

587
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,229
I can't tell.

588
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,569
Yes, they are following us.

589
01:04:46,741 --> 01:04:47,855
Faster!

590
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:53,119
- They're at their limit. Hyah! Come on!
- We shall see.

591
01:05:21,859 --> 01:05:24,396
They're enormous. Ravenous.

592
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:30,276
"Spirit demons from dark places,
eating souls that live in the light."

593
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,735
Part of our legend.

594
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:38,495
We put bullet after bullet into them.
It didn't even slow them down.

595
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:42,871
Will they come here? To our town?

596
01:05:42,963 --> 01:05:47,007
They'd have to get through the pass.
Lots of rocks. Maybe they cannot do it.

597
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:51,421
It hardly matters.
The mine will remain unapproachable.

598
01:05:53,098 --> 01:05:55,767
So what is your intention?

599
01:05:55,851 --> 01:06:00,512
My intention is to leave this godforsaken
place, as should all of you.

600
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:02,229
But the mine...

601
01:06:02,315 --> 01:06:06,775
Are you listening?
The mine is lost. Forget the mine.

602
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:12,901
Go on with your lives as if it never existed.
Start your lives over, just as I will have to.

603
01:06:12,994 --> 01:06:16,327
No stupid animal
is going to make me leave my land.

604
01:06:16,414 --> 01:06:19,498
I'll go to Carson City,
get some blasting powder.

605
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:22,156
Juan, we were lucky. Dumb lucky.

606
01:06:22,253 --> 01:06:27,958
If a man like Black Hand Kelly is no match
for them, what chance do we have?

607
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:33,257
Pyong, why would you stay? Take
Fu Yien and the missis back to China.

608
01:06:34,264 --> 01:06:36,552
Lu Wan forgets.

609
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:42,227
China not perfect. No place perfect.

610
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:47,060
We will not leave our new home.

611
01:07:00,165 --> 01:07:06,748
I'll send for my belongings, and see that
the horse and equipment are returned.

612
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:09,838
That won't be necessary.
You can keep the horse,

613
01:07:09,924 --> 01:07:13,838
and the saddle and the rifle
and the knife.

614
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:17,047
In trade for ownership of the mine.

615
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:21,268
- You can't be serious.
- It's the best offer you're gonna get.

616
01:07:22,395 --> 01:07:26,724
When I reach Philadelphia, I intend
to sell that mine for at least $50,000.

617
01:07:26,816 --> 01:07:29,603
You will be preceded by a telegram
to the newspapers

618
01:07:29,694 --> 01:07:35,862
describing in detail the creatures plaguing
the mine, and why it is unworkable.

619
01:07:36,826 --> 01:07:39,577
That's blackmail.
You wouldn't betray me like that.

620
01:07:39,662 --> 01:07:42,034
We voted.

621
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:44,495
Four to one in favor
of doing exactly that.

622
01:07:44,584 --> 01:07:47,918
At least one of you
has some sense of ethics.

623
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:50,840
I voted to drop you off a cliff.

624
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:54,798
Stay with us, Hiram. Stay and fight.

625
01:07:56,346 --> 01:07:59,097
You're wasting your lives.

626
01:08:05,063 --> 01:08:07,980
You can have the cursed mine.

627
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:18,867
Whoa. Whoa.

628
01:08:19,786 --> 01:08:23,451
Mr. Gummer, please don't leave us.

629
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:30,458
Fu...

630
01:08:30,546 --> 01:08:33,215
Fu Yien, I can't help you.

631
01:10:22,157 --> 01:10:25,360
ï¹adre de Dios. Hyah! Hyah!

632
01:10:54,814 --> 01:10:57,140
We were wrong. They're coming.

633
01:10:58,986 --> 01:11:02,817
The dirt dragons, they got through
the upper valley pass.

634
01:11:02,906 --> 01:11:05,942
I don't know when,
but they are definitely coming.

635
01:11:06,035 --> 01:11:08,323
Maybe they not find us, keep going south.

636
01:11:08,412 --> 01:11:10,902
No, no, no, no. They hunt by sound.

637
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:14,829
We are the only thing making noise
between here and Carson City.

638
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:17,455
What do the sticks say?

639
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:22,666
"Expect a ferocious arrival."

640
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,588
Well, this is it, then.

641
01:11:30,392 --> 01:11:33,096
The end of Rejection.

642
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:56,657
One ticket for your next train
to Philadelphia. Sleeping car.

643
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:59,787
- One way.
- Yes, sir.

644
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:09,338
Fools.

645
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:13,012
- I beg your pardon?
- The people up in Rejection.

646
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:17,892
Funnier than a dancing bear, eh?
Here's one they sent yesterday.

647
01:12:17,980 --> 01:12:21,230
"Giant worms have left upper valley."

648
01:12:21,317 --> 01:12:23,724
- "May find town."
- May I?

649
01:12:23,819 --> 01:12:28,776
"Need immediate help."
"Giant worms."

650
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:33,736
One ticket.

651
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:35,454
Sir? Your ticket?

652
01:13:18,249 --> 01:13:24,002
I was thinkin' I could make a sled for it.
We could pull it behind the last wagon.

653
01:13:24,088 --> 01:13:26,163
There's no room.

654
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:29,580
Time to let it go.

655
01:13:40,938 --> 01:13:42,811
Juan, where will you go?

656
01:13:42,898 --> 01:13:49,481
There is a new strike down near Tonopah.
I'm thinking of heading that way.

657
01:13:49,571 --> 01:13:52,275
Where will we go?

658
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:57,111
- We are going to San Francisco.
- And then back to China.

659
01:13:58,163 --> 01:14:02,207
All our money is put in the store,
and now it's all gone.

660
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:07,748
And you are not going to work on
the railroad like momma and poppa.

661
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:13,000
They're coming!

662
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:22,513
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

663
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:26,685
They will come from the north,
not from the south.

664
01:14:26,775 --> 01:14:30,393
That is something else... or someone.

665
01:14:50,048 --> 01:14:52,752
What poor soul
would be coming here now?

666
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:02,678
It's Mr. Gummer!

667
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:08,896
Come on! Whoa!

668
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:14,564
"A ferocious arrival"?

669
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:29,705
Well, now, maybe I'll
let you keep him after all.

670
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:35,382
Stop! Whoa, curse you! Whoa! Whoa!

671
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:38,672
Whoa, you intransigent beasts!

672
01:15:38,763 --> 01:15:42,594
- Delighted to see you're all well.
- Hiram, they could be here any minute!

673
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:44,722
- I know.
- Whatever are you thinking?

674
01:15:44,811 --> 01:15:50,647
That this idyllic Western retreat shall not
fall prey to these mindless predators.

675
01:15:50,734 --> 01:15:57,566
I have a cache of weapons that would
impress even the late Black Hand Kelly.

676
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:01,737
One Sharps.52-calibre buffalo rifle.

677
01:16:02,662 --> 01:16:07,869
One Remington 45-120 Rolling Block.

678
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:14,922
One Henry repeating rifle. Smaller caliber,
but impressive rate of fire.

679
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:18,925
One eight-gauge Remington... um...

680
01:16:20,054 --> 01:16:21,252
derringer.

681
01:16:21,347 --> 01:16:27,136
One LC Smith ten-gauge
stub twist coach gun.

682
01:16:27,228 --> 01:16:30,063
And this.

683
01:16:30,148 --> 01:16:33,896
A two-inch-bore punt gun.

684
01:16:37,113 --> 01:16:41,490
Hiram, how did you get all of these
things? You don't have any money.

685
01:16:47,373 --> 01:16:51,501
A wise friend once told me it's not
important how you spend your money,

686
01:16:51,585 --> 01:16:54,585
but how you spend your life.

687
01:16:55,423 --> 01:17:00,001
Hiram Gummer, what is it
you think we are going to do? Hm?

688
01:17:00,094 --> 01:17:06,760
Madam, I intend we throw our visitors
a little corpse-and-cartridge occasion.

689
01:17:08,018 --> 01:17:13,225
That we stand our ground and
fight these despicable beasts to the death!

690
01:17:19,696 --> 01:17:22,401
We will fight!

691
01:17:22,492 --> 01:17:24,034
Right.

692
01:17:26,788 --> 01:17:33,668
It takes me two years to make you
leave China. You think I want to go back?

693
01:17:33,753 --> 01:17:35,911
- We do it.
- We'll stomp 'em like snakes.

694
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:38,495
- We will burn them down.
- We'll smoke 'em up!

695
01:17:39,509 --> 01:17:44,170
Ah, Juan. Knowing you,
you'll need a spare.

696
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:48,549
Gracias, amigo.

697
01:17:54,148 --> 01:17:57,766
They'll probably be coming
from the north or the northeast.

698
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,066
Then we go out there and shoot them.

699
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:03,238
Too dangerous.
They can come up anywhere.

700
01:18:03,324 --> 01:18:05,399
We dare not face them on their terms.

701
01:18:05,492 --> 01:18:09,157
- Stake a horse. When they go for it...
- Tecopa, that's cruel.

702
01:18:09,246 --> 01:18:12,496
Well, these are cruel times.

703
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:16,034
Can't we make noise
with something else?

704
01:18:16,128 --> 01:18:20,540
That is a good idea, Fuito.
Any noise works.

705
01:18:20,632 --> 01:18:25,009
It doesn't have to be a horse. We could
make noise on something like this.

706
01:18:25,095 --> 01:18:27,764
Then when they come up, we shoot them.

707
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:31,715
Yes, an ambush. We will
lead them into our very gun muzzles.

708
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:36,021
We will make Rejection our last bastion,
our last line of defense.

709
01:18:36,106 --> 01:18:40,352
- Our Alamo.
- Juan, we were the losers at the Alamo.

710
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:43,360
Speak for yourself, gringo.

711
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:55,115
More cans. I need more cans.

712
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:58,660
I'm eating as fast as I can.

713
01:18:59,922 --> 01:19:02,543
What is all this?

714
01:19:02,633 --> 01:19:07,010
When they come, how do we know
they come? We cannot see them.

715
01:19:07,096 --> 01:19:11,639
- Well, that is a concern.
- When the ground shakes...

716
01:19:11,725 --> 01:19:14,429
we know they are here.

717
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:16,510
Dandy.

718
01:19:24,905 --> 01:19:26,897
What is a punt gun?

719
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:31,236
Something to do with shooting ducks.
A great many ducks.

720
01:19:31,328 --> 01:19:35,111
"Pour in one pound of shot or balls.
Ram it down tight..."

721
01:19:35,207 --> 01:19:37,282
Yup! Hyah!

722
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:52,214
Won't we need the horses?
I mean, if we lose the fight?

723
01:19:52,307 --> 01:19:56,684
Can't have them making
unnecessary noise. Might spoil our trap.

724
01:19:56,769 --> 01:19:59,390
And we're not going to lose, Fuito.

725
01:20:41,773 --> 01:20:44,346
Shall we begin?

726
01:22:08,942 --> 01:22:11,315
Maybe we should try again tomorrow.

727
01:22:11,404 --> 01:22:16,528
Perhaps Pyong was right. Perhaps
they've bypassed us for Carson City.

728
01:22:16,617 --> 01:22:18,408
I don't know.

729
01:22:18,494 --> 01:22:22,740
The ridge at the south end of the valley
is all rock, like a big wall.

730
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:27,375
- I don't think they can get past it.
- They gotta be somewhere.

731
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:42,510
No! Fu, get inside!

732
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:46,468
- But I want to fight too!
- Fu, Fu.

733
01:22:46,563 --> 01:22:52,268
The store is our fort.
We can't ever leave the fort unguarded.

734
01:22:52,361 --> 01:22:56,144
You stay inside and keep guard.

735
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:22,336
You missed! With a cannon!

736
01:23:31,357 --> 01:23:35,224
- Where did it go?
- Maybe the noise scared him away.

737
01:23:44,328 --> 01:23:47,329
Mr. Gummer, it's coming!
It's coming back!

738
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:50,409
Hiram, quick!

739
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:24,986
Yeah!

740
01:24:38,424 --> 01:24:40,463
It worked!

741
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:41,630
Ugh!

742
01:24:41,719 --> 01:24:43,094
It stinks!

743
01:24:46,098 --> 01:24:49,051
- There!
- Two more to go! Take your positions!

744
01:24:49,143 --> 01:24:51,052
Fu Yien, back inside!

745
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:10,196
Juan!

746
01:25:18,339 --> 01:25:21,590
Did it do that on purpose?

747
01:25:21,676 --> 01:25:23,419
Juan, look out!

748
01:25:52,999 --> 01:25:55,205
Cannot shoot through dirt.

749
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:19,438
Hyah! Hah!

750
01:26:20,692 --> 01:26:24,274
Come on, you son of a bitch!

751
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:50,753
ï¼y, caramba!

752
01:26:50,847 --> 01:26:53,468
Tecopa, gracias.

753
01:26:54,768 --> 01:26:56,226
Aston...

754
01:26:56,311 --> 01:27:01,057
Astonishingly clever,
my man.

755
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:05,527
- It take your gun. Did it know?
- I fear they are very intelligent.

756
01:27:05,613 --> 01:27:08,282
- But not as smart as us.
- No.

757
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:11,615
Not as smart as us.
And there's only one left.

758
01:27:11,702 --> 01:27:15,782
Where the hell is it?
Let it show itself!

759
01:27:27,634 --> 01:27:29,709
Tecopa...

760
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,220
- Is it leaving?
- No.

761
01:28:15,306 --> 01:28:20,263
No, it's circling. Listening for prey.

762
01:28:24,941 --> 01:28:27,182
What do we do?

763
01:28:27,276 --> 01:28:30,193
It seems our rifles
aren't strong enough to kill it.

764
01:28:30,279 --> 01:28:33,398
Without the punt gun, I fear we're lost.

765
01:28:33,491 --> 01:28:37,703
So we just stop the fight, then? Give up?

766
01:28:37,788 --> 01:28:40,278
Maybe we take traction engine.
Try to get away.

767
01:28:40,373 --> 01:28:43,824
- It moves so slowly.
- And you would leave our town?

768
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:47,750
You have ideas for killing it?

769
01:28:47,839 --> 01:28:50,923
A man must learn to sail in all winds.

770
01:28:51,468 --> 01:28:55,002
We must do what we can
with what we have.

771
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,435
Well said.

772
01:29:01,519 --> 01:29:06,643
You have black powder.
Maybe we could blow it up somehow.

773
01:29:06,733 --> 01:29:10,730
Sure. We make big firecracker.
I know how.

774
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:15,647
Excellent - but quietly.
Move very, very slowly.

775
01:29:16,409 --> 01:29:19,777
Fu Yien, you go inside
and get twine for fuse.

776
01:29:19,871 --> 01:29:21,744
OK.

777
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:39,758
- What are you doing?
- Powder for the fuse must be very fine.

778
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:50,054
Almost there. Just another few minutes.

779
01:29:54,905 --> 01:29:56,731
Fu...

780
01:30:12,131 --> 01:30:13,541
Fu!

781
01:30:17,637 --> 01:30:21,052
- I can't see the door.
- Fu, stay very quiet.

782
01:30:26,604 --> 01:30:28,762
Make noise!

783
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:32,141
Out here! Hey!

784
01:30:44,204 --> 01:30:47,407
Why doesn't it come for us?
For the noise?

785
01:30:47,499 --> 01:30:50,618
I don't know.
They keep learning our every trick.

786
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,284
He's over here.

787
01:30:55,549 --> 01:30:56,793
Fu!

788
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:58,342
Good boy. Good boy.

789
01:31:04,683 --> 01:31:07,304
Hurry up. The wagon! In the wagon!

790
01:31:07,394 --> 01:31:09,801
Get on.

791
01:31:14,109 --> 01:31:16,599
- Oh, good Lord!
- Let's get the rifles.

792
01:31:19,364 --> 01:31:21,439
The bomb!

793
01:31:36,339 --> 01:31:39,458
- Pyong, you must finish the bomb.
- I need more time!

794
01:31:46,016 --> 01:31:48,471
We'll never have time to finish that!

795
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:52,261
I have an idea.

796
01:32:05,952 --> 01:32:07,944
ï¼ijo de puta!

797
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:14,365
Pyong, that big belt.

798
01:32:16,588 --> 01:32:20,537
Excellent, excellent.
Tecopa! Help us here!

799
01:32:22,385 --> 01:32:26,216
- What we need is some kind of hook.
- I know where.

800
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:28,097
Over here, Juan!

801
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,117
Go.

802
01:33:04,218 --> 01:33:05,380
Go!

803
01:33:26,783 --> 01:33:28,277
Watch out!

804
01:33:34,207 --> 01:33:35,701
Yes!

805
01:34:03,277 --> 01:34:06,527
- Mrs. Lord, are you well?
- Yes. Are you all right?

806
01:34:06,614 --> 01:34:08,191
Yes, I am.

807
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:21,876
Gracias, amiguito.

808
01:34:23,672 --> 01:34:26,672
- You got 'em, Mr. Gummer.
- Yes, Hiram. You got 'em.

809
01:34:26,759 --> 01:34:28,965
No, no.

810
01:34:29,052 --> 01:34:30,510
We got 'em.

811
01:34:32,306 --> 01:34:34,464
Well done, well done.

812
01:34:49,364 --> 01:34:50,644
Hiram!

813
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:55,900
The bank has approved your loan. You
can hire new workers, reopen the mine.

814
01:34:55,996 --> 01:34:59,828
Well, if I recall,
it no longer belongs to me.

815
01:35:02,253 --> 01:35:05,419
It's yours, Hiram. It's your mine.

816
01:35:05,506 --> 01:35:07,794
We couldn't cheat you that way.

817
01:35:07,883 --> 01:35:10,420
You need it worse than we do.

818
01:35:10,511 --> 01:35:14,211
That's very kind. But I'll only
assume ownership under two conditions.

819
01:35:15,766 --> 01:35:17,557
"Conditions"?

820
01:35:17,643 --> 01:35:22,518
We agree never to tell anyone
about the dirt dragons.

821
01:35:22,606 --> 01:35:26,520
If word of them ever got out,
no one would ever settle here.

822
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:29,646
And the second condition?

823
01:35:29,738 --> 01:35:32,193
That the first proceeds of the mine
are used

824
01:35:32,282 --> 01:35:37,027
to build a hotel
and a market with real walls,

825
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,120
to pay off Juan's land, and, uh...

826
01:35:40,832 --> 01:35:43,405
Tecopa, what do you want?

827
01:35:47,255 --> 01:35:49,247
A new statue.

828
01:35:49,341 --> 01:35:51,463
One that looks like me.

829
01:35:51,551 --> 01:35:54,884
And to commission a statue for Tecopa.

830
01:35:54,971 --> 01:35:57,426
Does everyone agree to this?

831
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:33,628
I am fearfully outclassed.

832
01:36:33,718 --> 01:36:36,007
It's good you've decided to stay.

833
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:40,473
I shall personally supervise the mine - I
mean, as soon as I learn how it all works.

834
01:36:40,559 --> 01:36:43,725
And I've selected
an excellent location for my home.

835
01:36:43,812 --> 01:36:48,189
On high ground. Readily defended.
It will even have a basement.

836
01:36:48,275 --> 01:36:50,350
That's a lot of room for one person.

837
01:36:50,443 --> 01:36:54,571
Ideally, it... won't be for just one.

838
01:37:01,413 --> 01:37:06,787
- Oh, I really am hopeless.
- You'll get better with a little practice.

839
01:37:06,876 --> 01:37:12,415
In the meantime I bought something that
