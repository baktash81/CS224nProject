00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,112
[snorting]

175
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,153
Oh, Julia.

176
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,230
-[pedestrian 1]
Did you hear about Mr. Malcolm?
-[pedestrian 2] No.

177
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,999
[pedestrian 1 gasps]
Well, he turned away
Miss Thistlewaite.

178
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,401
Come inside!

179
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,902
Quickly!

180
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,404
[chattering]

181
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:46,440
Never been inside here before.
It's cozy.

182
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,808
[grunts]

183
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,845
Is this all of them?

184
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,882
All the ones for sale.
[pedestrian 3]
They're here in the window.

185
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,418
I don't understand.
[pedestrian 4]
Miss Thistlewaite.

186
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,787
-How embarrassing.
-Oh, my!

187
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,955
[gasps]

188
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,991
[pedestrians laughing]

189
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,292
Do you have a pencil?

190
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,294
[pedestrian 3]
How mortifying.

191
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,898
[grunts]
Her reputation must be
in tatters.

192
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,169
Cassie, please discover
what I did to incur
this humiliation.

193
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,374
Take this to my cousin.
You will find him
at his club.

194
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,909
The Lord of Limbs.

195
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,545
[Julia]
Immediately!

196
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,779
[chattering]

197
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,252
I am ruined.

198
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,090
[pedestrian 3]
She'll never find a husband,
I think.

199
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,458
[chattering continues]

200
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,527
-[coach driver] Steady.
-[horse neighs]

201
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,033
[pants, groans]

202
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:49,336
[sighs]

203
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,439
Refreshment, sir?

204
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,046
Thank you.

205
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,282
Good evening, sir.

206
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:06,086
[people chattering]

207
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,490
Goodness.
I shall come here more often.

208
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,928
Good evening.
Good to see you.

209
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,231
[chattering]

210
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,602
Did you hear...
[croupier] Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

211
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,169
[player]
Final bet, Cassidy?

212
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,104
[Cassidy]
Yes. Final or nothing.

213
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,205
Your turn, madam.

214
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,510
[player laughs]
[Cassidy groans]

215
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:31,879
Good sport
as always, milord.
You, you're a cheat.

216
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,014
Absolute cheat.
Cheers.

217
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,352
Ooh, that's strong.
[clears throat]

218
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,953
[John clears throat]

219
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,562
Oh, God.

220
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,333
Who else has seen this?

221
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,438
[Cassidy] Tell Miss Thistlewaite
I will handle the matter.

222
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:58,606
Mr. Malcolm.

223
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,608
Excuse me.

224
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:04,378
My dance card at
the Millers' ball next week
has a free space,

225
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,647
if you would be
so inclined.

226
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,348
You will have
to forgive me.

227
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,983
A riding ailment
does not permit me,
Miss...

228
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,553
Lady Gwyneth Amberton.

229
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,020
Lady Amberton.

230
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,955
Daughter of Earl
and Countess Amberton.

231
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,056
Of course.

232
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,891
How strange.

233
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,427
I do wonder how
one encourages sentiment
without dancing.

234
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,364
Malcolm.
Lord Cassidy,
Lady Amberton.

235
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:26,133
Hello. How do you do?
How do you do?
Now, excuse us.

236
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:32,607
Uh, Malcolm,
you are acquiring
quite the reputation.

237
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,309
Is that so?
Yes, indeed.

238
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,911
They are calling you
a trifler...
[laughs]

239
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:42,015
...a breaker of hearts,
a destroyer
of young ladies' dreams.

240
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,018
You're joking.
No.

241
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,120
What nonsense.

242
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,356
Well, perhaps
the gossips are correct.

243
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:56,029
You paid
very particular attention
to my cousin Julia

244
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,632
and now
have not been to call.

245
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:02,202
I escorted your cousin
to the opera once.

246
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,706
I did not pay her
"very particular
attentions."

247
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,674
What actually occurred
is besides the point.

248
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,344
It's what people say
that matters.

249
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:14,114
And everyone is saying
that there must be
something wrong with Julia.

250
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:16,618
I'm sorry that your cousin
has become the target
of gossips,

251
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:20,020
but I do not plan to marry
a woman merely because
I took her to the opera.

252
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,355
No, no one said
you had to.

253
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,956
That is what they want,
isn't it?

254
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:27,161
What are those dreams
I am accused of destroying?

255
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,997
Dreams of marrying
the "catch of the season"
purely for my fortune.

256
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,432
I will not have it.

257
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:33,568
[croupier] Place your bets.
Do you want in?

258
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,136
No, no. I have spent
all my money.

259
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:40,608
[croupier]
Oh, excellent.

260
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:42,342
Why not just choose
some girl

261
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,311
and just make
an end of it?

262
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,581
You know,
propagation of the species
and all that.

263
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,583
Why do you think
I am here tonight?

264
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,452
I am very anxious
to find a suitable bride.

265
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,989
Then why not Julia?

266
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:58,058
She's generally acknowledged
as a handsome woman.

267
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,761
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.

268
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:02,630
She's handsome enough,
but she's not the one for me.

269
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,365
No.
[croupier]
Place your bets.

270
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,768
Why not?

271
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,168
I don't know.
She--

272
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:12,707
She flutters her eyelashes
far too much.

273
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,176
Malcolm,
that's blinking.

274
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,346
That--
That is your reason?

275
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,583
No, that's
a pretty paltry reason.

276
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,518
It was very distracting.

277
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,352
Numerous times
throughout the evening,

278
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,221
I thought she was going
to fall asleep.

279
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,490
Don't look at me
like that.
Place your bets.

280
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:32,594
It was not the only thing
that turned me off
Miss Thistlewaite.

281
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:33,661
Here.

282
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:35,329
Item four.

283
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,532
"Converses in
a sensible fashion."

284
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:40,602
My tailor's conversation
is far more scintillating
than your cousin's.

285
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:44,171
I tried to engage her
in a discussion
about the Corn Laws,

286
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,708
and she thought
it was a diet regimen.
It's your turn, sir.

287
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:49,577
What is this?
Is this a list?
[croupier] Place your bets.

288
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:50,545
Yes, it is.

289
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:55,517
You have some sort of
list of qualifications
for a bride?

290
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,417
Yes, I do. So?

291
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,387
[croupier] Chance, sir.
You may roll again.
[scoffs]

292
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,190
That is
damned arrogant of you.

293
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:05,092
No wonder you cannot
settle upon anyone.

294
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,628
You want them to meet
some catalog of requirements,

295
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:08,630
like a...
Very well done, sir.

296
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:11,298
...like a tandem horse
you're purchasing
for your curricle.

297
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,300
Exactly.
Exactly that!

298
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,570
I have specific requirements
when filling my stable.

299
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:18,573
Why not even more
stringent requirements
when choosing a bride?

300
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,440
A companion
I will see morning...
Shall we roll again, sir?

301
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,476
...noon and night.

302
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,178
Next thing you know,
you'll be putting her
through her paces

303
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,748
or checking her teeth.

304
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:29,316
-Disaster.
-I'll add that to the list.

305
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,685
[croupier]
Bad luck, sir.

306
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,319
One more?
No, I'm not drinking.

307
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,387
One more.

308
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,723
[chirping]

309
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,663
She does not bite,
you know. [laughs]
[exclaims]

310
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:45,232
You have the manners
of a Billingsgate fishwife!

311
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,234
I would not know,

312
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,437
as I do not keep
the low society
you do, Cousin.

313
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,611
[sighs]
From my friend Selina.

314
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:02,316
Evidently, the news
has reached Sussex.

315
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,318
Tomorrow
the whole of England
will know.

316
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,622
Did you...

317
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,592
speak to Mr. Malcolm?

318
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:12,660
I did.

319
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:16,396
What did he say about me?

320
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,834
Well, he agreed

321
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:22,737
that you are
a handsome woman.

322
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,272
Did he?
That is good news.

323
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,142
But he has this list,
you see, and, um...

324
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:33,881
Well, unfortunately,
you did not meet
the fourth qualification.

325
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:36,751
I would have failed it myself
as I have no interest
in politics

326
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:38,720
and have always found
the Corn Laws
particularly confusing.

327
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:39,854
He has a list...

328
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:43,691
of requirements

329
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,293
for a bride?

330
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,328
Yes.

331
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:52,800
And I must say that
I did not care for the idea
at first myself,

332
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:57,270
but then when
he explained it to me,
I could see his point.

333
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,473
What if the girl has
some odd kick in her gallop?

334
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,609
Charming!
Well, his brother,
the Viscount,

335
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:04,579
was lured into a terrible match
and left miserable
as a consequence.

336
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:06,814
I don't believe it.

337
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,483
The arrogance!

338
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,753
I would like to see
what is on this list.

339
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:14,689
Cassie.

340
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,325
Did you see it?

341
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,359
No.

342
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:22,864
-Yes.
-[groans]

343
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:25,499
But it would do you no good.
No good at all.

344
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,735
No one can live up
to these expectations.

345
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:30,237
I mean, even if you'd passed
the Corn Laws test,

346
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,874
your eyelashes,
they irritated him to no end.

347
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,543
My eyelashes?

348
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:40,247
Is the man deranged?
No, of course not.

349
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,483
You just can't fool him
with those tricks you pull.

350
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,819
He despises
flirtatious games.

351
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:48,488
The unmitigated gall.

352
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:50,892
What conceit!

353
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,327
Is it rather warm
in here?

354
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:00,267
Somehow I will see to it

355
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,503
that the Honorable Mr. Malcolm

356
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,373
receives exactly
what he deserves.

357
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,611
He won't get away with this.

358
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,213
Right.

359
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,951
Right.
Well, I'd best be off.

360
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,486
And you're
going to help me.

361
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,489
No.

362
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,225
Julia, absolutely not.

363
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:26,928
Julia, no.

364
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:31,866
Julia,
what are you doing?
[sighs]

365
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,637
Julia, stop.

366
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,711
My dearest Selina...

367
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:44,444
[scoffs]

368
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,716
<i>...thank you</i>
<i>for your kind correspondence</i>

369
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,753
<i>in regards to</i>
<i>that vile caricature.</i>

370
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,622
<i>I've been thinking that it would</i>
<i>cheer me up no end</i>

371
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,959
<i>to see you after all this time.</i>

372
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,962
<i>Will you come visit me in London</i>
<i>for what is left of the season?</i>

373
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,533
<i>I promise you will be</i>
<i>well entertained.</i>

374
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,071
Apparently,
she's from the country.

375
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,774
Would you just be quiet
for once, John?

376
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:13,741
Posture.

377
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:16,043
[clears throat]

378
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,013
[coach driver]
Steady.

379
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:20,581
Whoa!

380
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,026
Well.

381
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,327
Selina!

382
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,997
Julia!
[laughing]

383
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,100
You made it!
I did!

384
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:42,837
How long has it been?
My dear,
how you've blossomed!

385
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,673
You look well yourself!
I'm so glad
you're here.

386
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:49,944
You must be parched.
Come inside.
Yes.

387
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:53,080
John, put Selina's bags
in her room immediately.

388
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:56,551
My dear cousin,
Lord Cassidy,
is dying to meet you.

389
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:03,124
So, tell us more
about how you've been
occupying your time

390
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,392
in the charming countryside.

391
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,528
It's such a different life
from here in town.

392
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:10,097
Yes.
Well, as I mentioned
in my letters,

393
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:13,935
I had been in Bath
serving as a companion
to the elderly Lady Ossory

394
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,036
in her final years.

395
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,004
Yes, Lady Ossory.

396
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,606
How dreary for you.

397
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:21,108
No, no. It was not
at all unpleasant,

398
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:24,411
though I did long
for some companions
my own age.

399
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:27,815
Bath has become
quite the destination
for septuagenarians.

400
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,952
Oh, my dear,
I understand completely.

401
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:33,921
I find foreigners
very tedious as well.

402
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,458
Well, your letter came
in the nick of time

403
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,061
as I've yet to find
another position.

404
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,832
My dear Selina,

405
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:47,702
if it is a position
that you're looking for,

406
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,071
I may have
the very thing.

407
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,839
[giggles]

408
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:55,810
Well, "position"
may not be quite
the right word.

409
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,848
It's more of
a project, a lark.

410
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,619
You see,

411
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:07,855
there is a gentleman,
a Mr. Malcolm,

412
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,490
who is widely known
for his arrogance.

413
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:12,827
Is he the one
in that awful caricature?

414
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,394
The very same.

415
00:23:15,663 --> 00:23:18,532
[sighs]
As you may know,

416
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:21,769
he paid me very public,
very pointed attentions

417
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:24,572
and then humiliated me
by withdrawing his suit.

418
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,874
Julia,
how dreadful for you.
Mmm.

419
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:28,676
Uh, I--
I am so sorry.

420
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,545
It was very unpleasant,

421
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,114
especially when
I found out

422
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:35,983
that he had
a list that
he judged me against

423
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,652
and found me wanting.

424
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,220
What sort of list?

425
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:41,055
It is a list
of the qualifications

426
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,690
he is looking for
in a bride.

427
00:23:42,723 --> 00:23:44,692
But he believes himself
to be so superior

428
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,794
that his qualifications
are quite unreachable.

429
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:51,032
I would love
for Mr. Malcolm

430
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,768
to receive the comeuppance
he deserves,

431
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:57,171
but I need
your assistance.

432
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:59,974
My assistance?
Hmm?

433
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:08,082
If we were
to present you

434
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:11,218
as the perfect woman
that he is looking for,

435
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:15,923
and then allow him
to discover that
you have a list,

436
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:19,660
and he does not meet
the requirements
on your list,

437
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:25,232
well, that would be
a perfect sort of
poetic justice.

438
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:34,474
I don't know. It's--
It sounds rather...

439
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:36,677
Mm-mmm.

440
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:37,778
...devious.

441
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:40,681
[scoffs] My dear Selina!

442
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:43,718
Do not be
such a namby-pamby!

443
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:46,153
I will not allow that man
to ruin one more reputation.

444
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:49,557
But if he is as arrogant
and fastidious as you say,

445
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,826
then how am I
to attract his attention?

446
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,095
If Mr. Malcolm
was not captivated by you,

447
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:56,897
then surely he will not
even look in my direction.

448
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,833
Oh, Selina.

449
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,603
What an astute observation.

450
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,541
However,
even though your look

451
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:10,011
is not fashionable
in the classical sense,

452
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:14,315
you are more informed than I
or any other young lady
before you.

453
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,551
You know
about the list.

454
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:20,888
And with some tutelage
from my cousin and me...

455
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:24,158
Mmm.
...you have a very good chance
of meeting the requirements.

456
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,226
[chews, grunts]

457
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:29,764
Your-- Your cousin
is going to instruct me

458
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:33,200
on how to attract
a sophisticated gentleman
of particular tastes?

459
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:34,301
Mmm.

460
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:38,139
[chews, gags]

461
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:40,007
Apparen-- Apparently, yes.

462
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:43,611
I-I-I don't think I...

463
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:45,312
My dear Selina.

464
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:50,985
I do hope you'll agree
to help me.

465
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:54,121
After all,
we've always looked out
for each other, have we not?

466
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,291
Plus, it could be
rather fun.

467
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:06,067
What is it exactly
that you want me to do?

468
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,601
Oh!

469
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:11,105
Thank you.

470
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:13,841
[clears throat]

471
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,609
Item number one:

472
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:18,179
"Handsome of countenance
and figure."

473
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,919
[humming]

474
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:29,957
Oh.
That's lovely, Molly.

475
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,125
Lower across
the bodice.

476
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:32,993
Julia!

477
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:36,831
[Julia] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>"Graceful and well mannered."</i>

478
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:39,800
Look at me.
Back arched
just a little, Selina.

479
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,702
We are having
the gown cut low.

480
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,270
We don't want him
to miss the effect.

481
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:45,172
Julia,
that's outrageous!

482
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:47,007
And we are...

483
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,709
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

484
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,211
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

485
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:53,781
Don't stop now.
You will trip Cassie.

486
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:57,785
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
And fly like a bird!

487
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:58,919
Spin out.
Pirouette.

488
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,354
[Julia] <i>Number three:</i>

489
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:03,257
<i>"Educates herself</i>
<i>by extensive reading."</i>

490
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,795
[sighs]
Becoming a suitable bride
is quite burdensome.

491
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:10,798
I almost feel as if
I'm being trained up
to become a wife.

492
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,298
I know.

493
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:16,704
God forbid someone decided
to enter a marriage
based on love.

494
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,105
What a wonderful thing to say.

495
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:23,377
You must exude
an elegance of mind,

496
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,746
a knowledge
of the world,

497
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:29,984
while still
retaining the naïveté
that men find so charming.

498
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:32,753
-Do you know anything
about the Corn Laws?
-Of course I do.

499
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,388
It's very important
that you do.

500
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,423
I've brought you some tracts
on the subject.

501
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:40,427
Do not waste too much time
on those tracts, Selina.

502
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:44,231
A gentleman doesn't
like a lady to be more
intelligent than he is.

503
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:48,002
A wife with a mind,
God forbid.

504
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:51,772
And thinking too deeply
causes forehead furrows.

505
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:54,975
It might be a good idea
if you meditated
on the ocean.

506
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,011
I find when I think
of the sea...

507
00:27:58,513 --> 00:28:00,748
I'm less apt
to wrinkle my brow.

508
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:03,951
Oh! I almost forgot.
No blinking.

509
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:05,386
I beg your pardon?

510
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,122
Malcolm doesn't like
flirtatious tricks.

511
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,357
Well, Cassie,

512
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:12,793
if you were paying
the least bit of attention,

513
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:15,829
you would have realized
I already explained
to Selina

514
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:18,899
that there should be
no artificiality
in her behavior

515
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:22,136
when she pretends
an attraction
to Mr. Malcolm.

516
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,072
That doesn't sound
anything at all
like what I said.

517
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:29,343
Well, excuse me
for not using words
of fewer syllables.

518
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,111
Oh.

519
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:33,747
Well, if you're
so bloody smart,
Miss Hoity-Toity,

520
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,183
how come you couldn't pass
Malcolm's little test?

521
00:28:36,217 --> 00:28:38,152
What is this now,
your fourth season?

522
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:39,486
Maybe if you'd
warned me!

523
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,322
I didn't want anything
to do with this.

524
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,057
I don't want anything
to do with you!

525
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,325
That's not--
Enough!

526
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:50,164
I believe I have an idea
of what Mr. Malcolm
is looking for.

527
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,202
Now, what plan do you have
for us to meet?

528
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,907
[Julia]
Selina, you are blending in.

529
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,976
[guests chattering]

530
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,277
Now you must hide.

531
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:08,249
A job masterfully done,
I'd say.

532
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,984
Julia,
I'm a little nervous.

533
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:12,119
Do not worry.
Wait in here.

534
00:29:13,454 --> 00:29:14,522
Hmm?

535
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,191
I shall return.

536
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:27,434
[guests chattering]
[music playing]

537
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,078
I should have stayed
in Sussex after all.

538
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:44,018
I beg your pardon?

539
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:49,156
Uh, I'm-- I am sorry
to disturb you, sir.

540
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,225
I thought this room
to be unoccupied.

541
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:55,462
'Tis no matter.

542
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:59,033
Um, hiding from
the dancing?

543
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:03,270
Uh, something like that.
I was, um...

544
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,275
reflecting on
the futility of a dream.

545
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,881
Is any dream futile?

546
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,554
It gives us hope,
and hope is a good thing.

547
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:20,789
In your opinion.

548
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:24,559
Others of us may believe,
as the poet said,

549
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:27,361
"'Tis hope is the most
hopeless thing of all."

550
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,365
What a sad conviction.

551
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:36,538
I prefer to believe,
as Johnson did,

552
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:40,608
that hope is
a "chief happiness
which this world affords."

553
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:43,545
But, perhaps,

554
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:46,280
you hope for
something unworthy,

555
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,616
in which case
you deserve to hope
in vain.

556
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,385
Confess, sir.

557
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:54,488
You were hoping to win
at the gaming tables
and have lost,

558
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,491
and are now indulging
in a fit of pique.

559
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,960
I would not confess
to such childish conduct.

560
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:06,300
Though had I played,
I would have hoped to win.

561
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,638
So you contend you hope
for something worthy?

562
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,172
I do, indeed.

563
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,175
Then it is my hope
that you obtain it.

564
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,176
I am honored.

565
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:21,382
Perhaps I am mistaken
in thinking hope
a useless thing.

566
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:28,523
[chuckles]

567
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,660
I-- I'm...
Excuse me.

568
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:36,096
I'm sorry.
I disturbed you. I...

569
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,031
I should go.
No.

570
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:41,468
No. I should be
the one to leave.

571
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:44,405
I have spent enough time
in solitary reflection.

572
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,250
I would be honored,
once you return
to the ballroom,

573
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:57,685
to be properly introduced.

574
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,436
Anyway,
as my mother always said,

575
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:18,205
I am a natural-born dancer.
I really am.

576
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:19,973
I mean, dancing runs
in my fam--
Cassidy.

577
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,543
Excuse me.

578
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:24,244
Where have you been?
I have a likely prospect
for you.

579
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,280
Young filly,
deep-chested, long legs.

580
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:28,182
I very much regret using
this horse analogy.

581
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,717
No, I think
you'll like this one.

582
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,285
She has quite
the air of mystery
about her.

583
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:33,120
That sounds alarming.

584
00:32:33,153 --> 00:32:35,523
I tend to
keep my distance from
mysterious young ladies.

585
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:40,160
Besides,
I think I just found
a likely prospect of my own.

586
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,362
I just wonder
how long she'll stay
in the orangery.

587
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:46,266
Sorry?
Sorry, what's that?

588
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,336
Did you meet--
Did you say you just
met someone in the orangery?

589
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:53,273
Yes. Though she's
probably married
or equally ineligible.

590
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,447
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

591
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,216
[guest] Lord Cassidy.
Sorry.

592
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:05,352
Oh.
Where is he off to?
[Cassidy] Excuse me!

593
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:17,498
Selina, did you--
did you just meet
a gentleman in here?

594
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:19,266
Yes.
He was delightful.

595
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,668
Excellent!
[guest laughs]

596
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:22,537
I do not see
what's excellent about it.

597
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,304
Julia says
I'm not to leave this room.

598
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,439
She says
she has to create an--

599
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:27,709
an "aura of mystery"
about me.

600
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:31,478
Forget what Julia told you.
We're returning
to the ballroom immediately.

601
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,413
Why? Do you know
the gentleman?

602
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,450
I rather think I do.
Come on.

603
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,621
Quickly.
Quickly.

604
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:45,192
My dear girl,
where have you been?

605
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:47,629
I see your dance card
is empty.

606
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:50,698
Do not be so judicious.
Hmm?

607
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:52,099
Do you want
a drink?
No.

608
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,133
Julia.

609
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:59,306
What are you doing here?

610
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:03,210
The beau monde
is fascinated by
the mysterious incognita.

611
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:05,780
There has been
an interesting
development.

612
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:07,481
Mr. Malcolm!

613
00:34:07,515 --> 00:34:10,552
There's someone
I want to
introduce you to.

614
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:14,421
M-Mr. Malcolm?

615
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:15,790
That is correct.

616
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:20,528
[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
Mr. Malcolm,
how lovely to see you,

617
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:22,496
and how well you look.

618
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:28,503
Mrs. Thistlewaite.
Miss Thistlewaite.

619
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:32,239
Mr. Malcolm.

620
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:35,510
I, however, have yet
to learn your name.

621
00:34:35,543 --> 00:34:40,882
Mr. Jeremy Malcolm,
may I present
Miss Selina Dalton?

622
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,684
Miss Dalton,

623
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:46,721
I am very pleased
to make your acquaintance,
properly.

624
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:51,224
-[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
Now, tell me, Mr. Malcolm.
-Hmm?

625
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,829
Will your delightful mother,
Her Ladyship,
be joining us this season?

626
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,731
"Properly"?

627
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:59,366
They stumbled upon
each other moments ago
in the orangery.

628
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,669
How unpredictable!
It's wonderful.

629
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:05,873
I was hoping, Miss Dalton,
perhaps you might join me

630
00:35:05,907 --> 00:35:08,342
for a tour of
the Dulwich Picture Gallery
tomorrow.

631
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:14,649
Thank you.
That would be nice.

632
00:35:14,682 --> 00:35:15,817
Tomorrow, then.

633
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:19,721
Lord Cassidy.

634
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:21,589
Y-Yes.

635
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,457
Well done.

636
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,594
[gasps]

637
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,501
[chattering]

638
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,505
Mr. Malcolm courting
yet another one.

639
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,807
Shh! I think
he might hear you.

640
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:47,180
Well, you most certainly
have a reputation.

641
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:48,650
As?

642
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:50,685
A trifler?

643
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:53,688
Well, yes.

644
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:55,890
Breaker
of hearts?

645
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:59,326
I suppose
one could say that.

646
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:03,531
A destroyer
of young ladies' dreams?

647
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,336
That is
an absurd exaggeration,

648
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:12,540
but I have heard
rumors along those lines.

649
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:15,810
And you?

650
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:19,614
Do you believe
this description of me?

651
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:26,954
I am not ready
to pass judgment.

652
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:29,891
Well, I am glad
to hear you say that,
Miss Dalton,

653
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:34,562
for I do not believe
I deserve this reputation
I have acquired.

654
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,764
Particularly in the case
of Miss Thistlewaite,

655
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:38,633
I find myself blameless.

656
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:42,837
She told me you paid her
very marked attentions.

657
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,238
I escorted her
to the opera once.

658
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:48,442
I see. Was it
an amusing opera?

659
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,815
No.
No, it wasn't.

660
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:56,017
The soprano missed
most of her notes,

661
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,253
and Miss Thistlewaite
wore this feather which
brushed against my nose

662
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:01,889
so frequently
over the course
of the evening,

663
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:03,658
I found myself
wanting to sneeze.

664
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:07,895
Well,
you and Miss Thistlewaite
are the victims

665
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,997
of a most egregious
set of circumstances.

666
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,633
Feathers
and screeching sopranos

667
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,301
are not conducive
to romance.

668
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:22,510
So you acquit me

669
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,746
of trifling with
Miss Thistlewaite's affections?

670
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,619
I am-- I am afraid
I cannot.

671
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:35,422
You were
too easily put off.

672
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:40,027
A sincere gentleman
would have tried
a second time

673
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:43,497
before casting a woman aside
in the public eye.

674
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:46,701
Invited her to
a musical concert, perhaps.

675
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:49,302
But I knew
I was not interested
in Miss Thistlewaite

676
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,571
after the opera.

677
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:52,405
Had I continued
to pursue her,

678
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,609
I would have deserved
the reputation
I have acquired.

679
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:59,981
So what would
you have me do
in such circumstances?

680
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:02,650
Jeremy?
[laughs]

681
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:03,551
Excuse me.

682
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,520
Jeremy Malcolm.

683
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:08,656
Henry Ossory,
as I live and breathe!
What are you doing here?

684
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,858
I thought you were
stationed with your regiment
in the north.

685
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:14,629
I'm just in town
for the memorial
of Lieutenant Colonel Donoghue.

686
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,664
But I am thinking
of selling out

687
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:19,667
and joining the ranks
of you idle gentlemen wastrels.

688
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,968
Are you sure
you're up to it?

689
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:23,004
It can be
quite exhausting.
Well...

690
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:27,909
Excuse me, Miss Dalton.
May I present
Captain Henry Ossory?

691
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,677
Miss Dalton?

692
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,512
Captain Ossory?

693
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,480
[laughs]
Miss Selina Dalton?

694
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,049
Yes.

695
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,752
I take it the two of you
are familiar
with each other.

696
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:40,621
Yes. Miss Dalton was
an excellent friend
of my uncle's widow.

697
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:43,057
I wanted to thank you
for your kindness to my aunt.

698
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,491
I see.

699
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,928
But what
a fortunate coincidence

700
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,361
to come upon you
so unexpectedly.

701
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:49,664
How opportune.

702
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,566
I am very pleased
to meet you, Captain.

703
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,801
I esteemed your aunt
very highly

704
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:55,837
and have long wished
to express my condolences.

705
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,805
Why, thank you.

706
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,075
I served as a companion
to Captain Ossory's aunt
in Bath

707
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:02,577
during her final years.

708
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,978
How very kind.

709
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:10,852
Well, I should let you
resume your tour
with Mr. Malcolm.

710
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:13,521
But I would be pleased
to call on you,

711
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:15,488
if you would give me
your direction.

712
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:17,758
I am staying
at the Thistlewaites'
in Berkeley Square.

713
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,728
Well, Mr. Malcolm.

714
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:21,662
Ossory.

715
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:23,463
Miss Dalton.

716
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:32,506
Oh. Uh, do make sure
you see the <i>Venus and Adonis.</i>
Quite exquisite.

717
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:34,876
Goodbye.

718
00:39:35,977 --> 00:39:37,745
What a fortuitous meeting.

719
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:39,814
Quite.

720
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,448
Look at Mr. Malcolm.

721
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:45,019
Doesn't look pleased,
does he?
[snores]

722
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:50,490
[humming]

723
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:52,026
[Julia] Good evening, Molly.
Do not mind us!

724
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,095
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

725
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:56,931
[Julia] Selina must be
absolutely famished.
Good evening, Molly.

726
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:58,833
[Julia]
Just a little something.

727
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,101
It's beautiful.

728
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:01,836
[humming]

729
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:04,872
So...

730
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:07,808
what did he say about me?

731
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:11,646
Um, merely
that he escorted you
to the opera.

732
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,950
I must admit, Julia,
that does not seem
such a heinous crime.

733
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:18,552
Did he tell you
about my eyelashes?

734
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:19,553
Your eyelashes?

735
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,589
[scoffs]

736
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:25,092
Just wait until he starts
to weigh you up against
that list of his.

737
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:28,095
Then you'll see
how unpleasant he can be.

738
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:29,764
Oh, Selina.

739
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,565
[sighs]

740
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:36,537
I need you to help me.

741
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,806
There's no way
I can touch him.

742
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,542
He holds all
of London society
in his palm.

743
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:45,546
But I'm just not sure
he is the villain
you paint him to be.

744
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:50,084
I want him humiliated,
as I was.

745
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:56,557
More than anything, I--
I want my reputation restored.

746
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,994
And my--

747
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:03,531
my prospects are dwindling.

748
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:07,068
I truly understand,
but maybe...

749
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:11,238
I have known you
nearly all my life.

750
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:16,210
And you have known
Malcolm for, what,
less than a day?

751
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:19,113
Ugh. He has this effect
on all women.

752
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,683
It's like he exercises
some kind of power over them.

753
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:26,754
He did not exercise
any power over me.

754
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,591
Are you sure?

755
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:35,262
You did not find something
mesmerizing about him?

756
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:43,537
I cannot deny that
I see a certain...

757
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:45,906
[clears throat]
attraction.

758
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,841
I knew it.

759
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:53,047
You're being blinded
by his intelligent conversation

760
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,817
and devastatingly handsome
good looks.

761
00:41:56,851 --> 00:42:00,187
Well, take it from me,
it leads to nowhere.

762
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,568
Are you feeling well today,
Julia?

763
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:16,937
Yes, quite well.

764
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,005
[door opens]

765
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:20,107
Captain Ossory.

766
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:24,912
Oh. I'm not acquainted
with a Captain Ossory.

767
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,180
Are you, Julia?

768
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:28,315
Captain Ossory is
an acquaintance of mine.

769
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,119
Oh. Send him in at once.

770
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:43,898
May I present
Captain Ossory to you,
ma'am?

771
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:47,101
Captain Ossory,
Mrs. Thistlewaite
and Miss Thistlewaite.

772
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:50,738
Your servant, Mrs. Thistlewaite,
Miss Thistlewaite.

773
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:53,007
Please be seated,
Captain.

774
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,776
Thank you, ma'am,
but actually
I came to request

775
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,179
the pleasure of a promenade
with Miss Dalton.

776
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:00,614
Another one!

777
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,950
That would be lovely.

778
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:05,219
Please excuse me
while I collect my things.

779
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,353
[Ossory] Of course.

780
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,998
[sighs, chuckles]

781
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:19,767
[clears throat]

782
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,370
So, Captain Ossory?

783
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,605
Yes.

784
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:29,944
I was not aware
that Selina had
an acquaintance in town.

785
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:32,813
Yes, Miss Dalton was
a dear friend of my aunt's.

786
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:37,751
It's very strange.
She's never mentioned you.

787
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:38,953
Pity.

788
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:44,425
Are you situated in town
or is this a flying visit?

789
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:48,762
Newly situated, yes.
I hope you don't mind
the intrusion.

790
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:53,100
A friend of Selina's
is surely a friend
of mine-- Ours.

791
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,271
Thank you both.
How kind.

792
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:00,774
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

793
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:04,278
Mrs. Thistlewaite,
Miss Thistlewaite,

794
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,013
lovely to meet you both.

795
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:08,782
Indeed.

796
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:15,356
[door closes]

797
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:18,826
What?

798
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:20,427
[children laughing]

799
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:22,930
[Ossory] I'm not sure
if you are aware, Miss Dalton,

800
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,966
but my aunt
mentioned you many times
in her correspondence with me.

801
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,836
Your aunt spoke of you
quite often, as well.

802
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:31,972
I am very pleased
to have this opportunity
to make your acquaintance.

803
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,241
Yes,
I feel likewise.

804
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:37,912
I must admit, however,
to yet another motive
for seeking you out.

805
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:41,081
I came to London
to meet you

806
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:44,952
because it's my belief
that my aunt desired us
to make a match.

807
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:47,922
[stammers, laughs]

808
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:50,424
What gave you
that impression?
[laughs]

809
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:52,927
Well,
her letter to me
before her death,

810
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,297
in it she wrote,
"It is my desire that you
and Miss Dalton make a match."

811
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:00,434
I see. Then it appears
you interpreted
her meaning correctly.

812
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:01,802
Yes, yes.

813
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,837
Her words were
rather plain.

814
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,207
Unless, of course,
she could have been
speaking of cribbage.

815
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,475
She could have meant
we should engage
in a cribbage match.

816
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,445
Or chess.
Could she not have been
speaking of chess?

817
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:15,049
I am afraid not.
She knew me to be a very,
very poor chess player.

818
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:20,487
Ah. Um, good day, Henry.
Miss Dalton.

819
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:22,856
Jeremy.
Good day, Mr. Malcolm.

820
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,160
It appears
I have interrupted
a humorous discussion.

821
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,295
Well...
It was nothing
of consequence.

822
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:32,967
We were discussing a letter
Captain Ossory received
from his aunt.

823
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,301
Lovely.
[chuckles]

824
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:36,504
Good.

825
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:39,373
Well, I wondered if
you were to attend

826
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,408
Lady Hartley's ball
week after next.

827
00:45:41,442 --> 00:45:44,178
-I believe I am.
-Excellent.

828
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:48,550
As it happens,
I too am to attend
Lady Hartley's ball.

829
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,884
Perhaps I might be
favored with a dance?

830
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:53,787
Certainly.
[chuckles]
Excellent.

831
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:56,123
Well, shall we?
Mm-hmm.

832
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:57,424
After you.

833
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,404
Good day,
sir.

834
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:16,143
[gossiper 1]
I've heard
she's from Sussex!

835
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:18,479
I must say,
whatever is the matter,
dear Selina?

836
00:46:18,513 --> 00:46:20,281
[gossiper 2]
Where is Sussex?

837
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:24,451
I, um--
I received correspondence
from my mother.

838
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:27,821
She's asked me to call on
my cousin's widow,
Mrs. Covington,

839
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,323
while I'm in town.

840
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:30,791
Whatever is wrong
with her?

841
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:33,427
When I met her last,

842
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,864
she would not
accept me at my word
that I had no beau.

843
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,099
She quizzed me
on the subject
for 20 minutes

844
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:41,536
before offering
to find me a husband.

845
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:43,237
I hate to think
how she'll react

846
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,939
when she finds out
I'm still unwed.

847
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:49,476
She was married,
widowed and married again
by our age.

848
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:50,512
How vulgar.

849
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,214
Selina,
whatever you do,

850
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:56,116
do not mention
to Mr. Malcolm

851
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,053
that you have
such a vulgar cousin.

852
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,922
One of the requirements
on his list is:

853
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:04,958
"Has genteel relations
from good society."

854
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:09,363
[Selina]
I wouldn't call the Daltons
"from good society."

855
00:47:09,396 --> 00:47:13,434
But, Selina,
you're the daughter
of a clergyman.

856
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:17,505
That's at least
fourth-class society,
possibly even third.

857
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,073
At best.

858
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:22,176
Oh, and while
we're speaking of it,

859
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:24,411
at the dinner party,
you will need to play
the pianoforte.

860
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,413
What?

861
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:29,651
Musical talent
is another requirement
on Malcolm's list.

862
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:32,086
Malcolm,
he loves music.

863
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,988
But I don't play
the pianoforte.

864
00:47:35,022 --> 00:47:37,491
I am surprised
Mr. Malcolm desires a wife

865
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:41,195
when he could
just as easily hire
a performing bear.

866
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:45,399
Do not worry,
dear Selina.
I have a plan.

867
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:50,505
[Julia] Mr. Banbury,
how's your wife?

868
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:53,474
[Julia]
<i>So, tell me, Captain Ossory,</i>

869
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:56,544
how are you finding
society life so far?

870
00:47:56,578 --> 00:47:59,480
I seem to be
constantly thwarted
in my endeavors.

871
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:03,083
Hmm. What endeavors
are those, may I ask?

872
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,285
The art of courtship.

873
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,355
[Cassidy] Well, ladies?

874
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,190
What do we think?

875
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:13,293
Tolerable enough?
Handsome enough to tempt?
[Malcolm laughs]

876
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:18,399
I find courting
to be less an art
than an avocation.

877
00:48:18,432 --> 00:48:20,702
[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
You served in
the Peninsular,

878
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,570
did you not,
Captain Ossory?

879
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:25,507
Yes, in the 18th Regiment
of Light Dragoons.

880
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,108
Did you see any action,
Captain?

881
00:48:28,142 --> 00:48:30,144
Yes, at Waterloo.

882
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:33,681
I saw more death
than a man should,
but a great victory all round.

883
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:35,249
How brave.

884
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:36,584
[chuckles]

885
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:39,353
Swapping a battlefield
for a ballroom.

886
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:41,455
How ironic.

887
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:43,190
Perhaps.

888
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:45,359
However,
I still find myself
surrounded by

889
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:48,328
a multitude of sweaty men
desperate for female company.

890
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,998
[all laugh]

891
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:54,034
Miss Dalton, tell me,
how do you know
Miss Thistlewaite?

892
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:56,403
-You met at school,
I believe?
-Yes, we attended--

893
00:48:56,437 --> 00:49:01,041
We, uh, both attended
Mrs. Finch's
Ladies Academy as girls.

894
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:04,178
I attended on the
kindness of a benefactor
of my father's.

895
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,182
I was bullied quite terribly,
but Julia was kind to me.

896
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:09,617
Mmm.

897
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:11,719
Miss Dalton,
I was curious,

898
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:14,254
what is your opinion
on the Church Building Act?

899
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,326
[Mrs. Thistlewaite]
What a weighty question
to ask over soup.

900
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:23,197
I believe
it is in bad taste

901
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,134
to discuss politics
before the entrée is served.

902
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,703
Perhaps you are correct.

903
00:49:28,736 --> 00:49:31,338
However, I am interested
in Miss Dalton's opinion.

904
00:49:35,342 --> 00:49:37,277
Well,

905
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:39,112
as the daughter
of a clergyman,

906
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:41,248
it is obviously
important to me

907
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:43,751
that there are
houses of worship
available to all.

908
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:45,486
However,

909
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,755
I feel that
the million pounds set aside

910
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:49,724
for this purpose
is exorbitant.

911
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:52,594
I believe our government
intends by this measure

912
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:55,095
to suppress the radicals
and keep anarchy at bay,

913
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:56,698
when they could use
some of those funds

914
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:58,198
to better
the lot of the poor,

915
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,100
thereby accomplishing
the same purpose.

916
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:02,269
They could just
pay us better.

917
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:03,370
[cutlery clatters]

918
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:07,809
Hear! Hear!
[all laugh]

919
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,409
Wonderful.

920
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:10,712
I apologize
for the lecture,

921
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:13,046
but you did ask me
for my opinion.

922
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,149
I am sure your father himself
could not preach
a more eloquent sermon.

923
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:17,552
[Ossory clears throat]
And you, Mr. Malcolm,

924
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:19,621
what's your opinion
on the matter?

925
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,557
Although I doubt
you will be able to express
your argument as well.

926
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,358
[chuckles]

927
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,426
It's very much the same,
actually.

928
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,263
[piano playing]

929
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,808
[Cassidy humming]

930
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:47,549
[playing continues]

931
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:07,100
[Ossory chuckles]

932
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:08,703
Good shot,
Miss Thistlewaite.

933
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:19,714
[chuckles]
Oh.

934
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:22,282
[laughs]
I must be nearsighted!

935
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:23,751
[Cassidy] Selina,

936
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:26,788
you're taking losing
mighty well.

937
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:29,089
How amiable
and even-tempered of you.

938
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,095
Take another shot,
my dear.

939
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,264
May I assist?

940
00:51:38,365 --> 00:51:39,366
Yes.

941
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:47,240
So, keep your shoulders
in line with the target.

942
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:51,378
Ball between your feet.
A little more.

943
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:54,114
[Malcolm] Hands steady.

944
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:00,888
Deep breath in.
[inhales]

945
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:06,159
[exclaims]
Thank you.

946
00:52:06,193 --> 00:52:07,394
Brilliant.

947
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,831
All right,
Captain Ossory.

948
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:12,667
It's your shot
for the win.

949
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,704
It's an easterly wind,
so aim a little
to the right.

950
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:18,271
[clears throat]

951
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,878
Well done.
[Cassidy] Marvelous!

952
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:27,247
[Julia] It would have been
a shame to lose
on such an easy shot.

953
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,816
[Cassidy]
Can you pass me the shawl?
Quite.

954
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,819
My legs are cold.
The wind was,
uh, westerly.

955
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:33,921
If I had listened to you,
I would have.

956
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:37,592
Oh, Captain.
I'm pretty sure
it's to the east.

957
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,827
I'm surprised you lasted
that long in the cavalry

958
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,696
with such a dreadful
sense of direction.

959
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:45,432
[laughs]
Besides,
I never lose.

960
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:47,669
Neither do I.

961
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:57,477
My lords and ladies,
may I have your attention,
please?

962
00:52:57,512 --> 00:53:00,515
Lot seven,
an eight-year-old
Irish draft mare.

963
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:02,315
All of 16 hands.

964
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:05,385
Well-schooled and hunted,
she's sporting countryside.

965
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:06,821
Have I an opening bid
of 150...

966
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,523
[Cassidy]
My mother used to always say,

967
00:53:08,556 --> 00:53:10,357
"Never, ever, ever
go near a horse--"

968
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,560
Enough about the horses!

969
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:14,696
Tell us what Malcolm
thinks of our girl.

970
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:17,565
No, please,
not this again.

971
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:21,803
He told me that he
was initially impressed

972
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:24,806
by her wit and humor,
um,

973
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,575
but was concerned
that she was not
serious enough.

974
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:30,611
But after the dinner party,
that fear was laid to rest.

975
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:32,947
"Not serious enough."

976
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,248
He certainly makes
rash judgments.

977
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:36,584
It's as I've told you,
Selina.

978
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,019
There is
no pleasing the man.

979
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:40,555
No, no. Look, I may have
quoted him incorrectly.

980
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,590
He was very,
very complimentary.

981
00:53:42,623 --> 00:53:45,927
He said you've nearly met
all of the qualifications
on his list,

982
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,794
which is a good thing.

983
00:53:46,828 --> 00:53:48,863
Oh, dear.

984
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:52,332
I know this is
hard to hear, Selina,
but it shall be over soon.

985
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:54,969
-Julia, that's not
what I'm saying.
-Selina! [gasps]

986
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:56,738
Selina Dalton!

987
00:53:56,771 --> 00:53:59,540
How rude!
As I live and breathe.

988
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:02,543
Cousin Gertie!
What a surprise!

989
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:04,411
May I introduce
my dear friend...

990
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,047
Miss Thistlewaite.

991
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,816
Miss Thistlewaite.
[laughs]

992
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,051
That's a mouthful.

993
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:12,053
Miss Thistlewaite.
[laughs]

994
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,921
Say that one 20 times.

995
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:16,824
Miss Thistlewaite.
Miss Thistlewaite. Miss--
[laughing]

996
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:20,561
Say it, try, try!
Miss Thistlewaite.
Miss-- You can't do it!

997
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:24,632
What you need, my girl,
is a husband

998
00:54:24,665 --> 00:54:28,069
so you can change
that ghastly tongue twister
of a name.

999
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:29,904
[laughing]

1000
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:33,306
Mrs. Covington,
may I introduce you
to Lord Cassidy?

1001
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,677
How do you do?
[Mrs. Covington]
Oh, Lord. [chuckles]

1002
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:38,311
Hey, Malcolm.
Malcolm!

1003
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:41,015
[Mrs. Covington] Is that
the famous Mr. Malcolm?

1004
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:43,584
Do you know him?
I saw the most
hilarious caricature of him

1005
00:54:43,618 --> 00:54:45,052
a few weeks past.

1006
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:46,754
[gasps]
I didn't know
you were here.

1007
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:49,389
Mr. Malcolm.
Captain Ossory.

1008
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:52,359
What a wonderful
surprise.

1009
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:54,595
Nice to see you again,
Miss Thistlewaite.
[clears throat]

1010
00:54:56,697 --> 00:54:58,733
Mrs. Covington,

1011
00:54:58,766 --> 00:55:03,403
may I present
the Honorable Mr. Malcolm
and Captain Henry Ossory.

1012
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:06,406
I'm delighted
to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Covington.

1013
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:07,542
Mrs. Covington.

1014
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:10,778
No, sir, it is I
who am delighted.

1015
00:55:10,812 --> 00:55:13,480
[chuckles, stammers]

1016
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:19,754
Well, I have never been
in the same room with a captain,
a lord and an honorable.

1017
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:21,823
Although, I am not
quite exactly sure

1018
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:24,424
what it means
to be an honorable.

1019
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:27,128
It's the next best thing
to a lord, am I right?

1020
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:28,796
He is the younger son
of an earl.

1021
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,363
[Mrs. Covington]
Oh, oh, oh.

1022
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:32,600
Now, that's a real pity.

1023
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:35,570
Because you've got
the look of a lord,

1024
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:39,040
much more than
this young gentleman
over here. [laughs]

1025
00:55:39,073 --> 00:55:41,742
You know, Mr. Malcolm
has a more, um...

1026
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:44,411
dignified look
about him.

1027
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:46,647
[Julia stammering]
Cassie,

1028
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:51,519
I think Mrs. Covington
would probably like
a drive home...

1029
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:52,920
by a lord.

1030
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:55,656
I'm sure His Lordship
has other plans

1031
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,456
for the rest
of the afternoon.

1032
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:00,728
No. No, he doesn't
have any plans.

1033
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:01,629
Julia, I do.
No, you don't.

1034
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:06,534
I do. No, I--
No, I don't.

1035
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:08,769
Thank you.
I would be honored.

1036
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:11,105
I am glad I dressed
so sensibly today.

1037
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:13,473
Is this hat
not ravishing on me?

1038
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:14,976
Quite.
Quite.

1039
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,845
Shall we go then?

1040
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:20,413
Of course,
of course.

1041
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:23,416
One thing I learned
in my two trips
to the altar

1042
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:28,421
is that the gentlemen
don't like to be
kept waiting.

1043
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:33,493
[cackling] Oh, yes!
They're never waiting.
Oh, yes.

1044
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:38,532
Selina,
Julia Thistlewaite--
I'll call sometime soon.

1045
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:40,601
Excuse me, sorry.
Yes!

1046
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:42,770
[muffled chuckle]

1047
00:56:42,803 --> 00:56:46,874
And how are you acquainted
with Mrs. Covington?

1048
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,643
She-- She is--

1049
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,177
My cousin.

1050
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:54,882
-Your cousin?
-Yes.

1051
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:58,019
-Right.
-Seven times removed.

1052
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:00,621
Selina, my dear,
if we're not buying,
we'd better be going.

1053
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,657
Well,
before you leave,

1054
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,160
I was wondering if
Miss Dalton would join me
for a ride tomorrow?

1055
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,965
Um, I-I--

1056
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:13,668
She would be honored
to ride with you,
Mr. Malcolm.

1057
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:16,904
Now,
that's settled.

1058
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:21,242
Us ladies should
leave you gentlemen
to your stallions.

1059
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:22,510
Good afternoon.

1060
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:24,745
[auctioneer calling]

1061
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:25,947
Ladies.

1062
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:30,217
All done.
At 84, the seller in front.

1063
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:32,219
At 84 guineas, last. Sold!

1064
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:35,589
My dear Selina,
it is working.

1065
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:38,491
And now thanks to me,
you will not fail item six.

1066
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:42,495
I thought that must be
why you claimed her.

1067
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:45,166
Couldn't imagine
you felt a sudden desire
for her kinship.

1068
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,701
Ugh.

1069
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:48,736
No.

1070
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:52,472
Just do not
reverse course on me.

1071
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:55,910
I will not, Julia.

1072
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:58,980
I promise to be everything
he desires in a woman:

1073
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:02,650
witty, humorous,
serious, genteel,

1074
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:05,619
musical, fashionable,
only the best relations

1075
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:07,722
and all at the same time.

1076
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:09,523
Excellent.

1077
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:16,630
Selina!

1078
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,935
I thought you might
like to wear this.

1079
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:26,774
Oh. It is--
It is magnificent.

1080
00:58:27,775 --> 00:58:28,809
But I cannot.

1081
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:30,011
Nonsense.

1082
00:58:35,316 --> 00:58:41,055
[sighs] I must say,
it looks ravishing on you.

1083
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:45,826
It is yours now.

1084
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:48,295
Thank you, Julia.

1085
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,297
It is nothing.

1086
00:58:51,632 --> 00:58:53,300
See you tonight.
See you tonight.

1087
00:58:57,872 --> 00:58:59,006
Mmm.

1088
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:01,942
[ducks quacking]

1089
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,021
That is a very beautiful
bonnet on you.

1090
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:16,857
You are very quiet
this afternoon.

1091
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:21,262
Please don't feel the need
to make conversation.

1092
00:59:21,295 --> 00:59:25,332
I much prefer silence
to those that rattle on
with nothing to say,

1093
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:27,201
like that Mrs. Covington.

1094
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:30,204
She's quite
the character, isn't she?

1095
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:33,040
I must say, I'm very glad
I'm not courting
Miss Thistlewaite.

1096
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:35,643
Beg your pardon?

1097
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,179
What do you mean?

1098
00:59:38,212 --> 00:59:39,780
Well, I mean...

1099
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:43,050
Well, it's obvious,
isn't it?

1100
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,019
That I would want
my future companion's relations

1101
00:59:45,052 --> 00:59:46,353
to have a modicum
of gentility.

1102
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:48,289
And if they did not?

1103
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:11,078
I'm sorry
I introduced the subject.

1104
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:12,947
'Tis a moot point,
after all.

1105
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,216
I'm not courting
Miss Thistlewaite.
I'm court--

1106
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:17,952
Well...

1107
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:23,157
I think it's quite clear
who it is I'm courting,
isn't it?

1108
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:33,134
But if you were
still courting Julia
and you had met Mrs. Covington,

1109
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:35,002
would that affect
your opinion of Julia?

1110
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:37,271
Well, it would have to,
wouldn't it?

1111
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,877
There's a saying
where my family is from.

1112
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:47,148
[speaking Yoruba]

1113
01:00:47,181 --> 01:00:50,417
A man who marries a woman
marries all her relatives.

1114
01:00:55,222 --> 01:00:57,424
I'm sorry, I...

1115
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:58,792
I've said too much.

1116
01:01:00,194 --> 01:01:02,096
I understand this is
quite overwhelming.

1117
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:09,136
And what do you find
overwhelming, Mr. Malcolm?

1118
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:15,042
The society balls.

1119
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:16,744
Gold-rimmed tea cups.

1120
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:20,314
The tying of silk cravats.
All of this is very easy.

1121
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,150
You learn the rules.
You follow the rules.

1122
01:01:23,184 --> 01:01:25,186
If there is a moment
where there is no rule,

1123
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,820
you make a rule,
you follow that.

1124
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:31,926
I find everything else
overwhelming.

1125
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:40,868
Why did you come
to London, Miss Dalton?

1126
01:01:42,803 --> 01:01:44,104
Because
I was lonely.

1127
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:47,474
I was lonely, too,
before you came.

1128
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:59,186
I... I am having
a house party
at my estate in Kent,

1129
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,422
and I would be pleased
if you would come
as my guest.

1130
01:02:03,057 --> 01:02:04,858
I am honored
by the invitation,

1131
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:06,827
but I am a guest
of the Thistlewaites.

1132
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,129
I will invite them as well.
And Cassie, of course.

1133
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,365
I'll even invite Ossory
if you'd like.

1134
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,436
My mother is coming
to act as hostess,

1135
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:19,406
and I thought perhaps
your parents might like
to come as well.

1136
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:24,078
Thank you.

1137
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:26,213
I shall write
and ask them.

1138
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:30,017
I suppose we should
be heading back.

1139
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:35,222
[rips]
[Selina gasps]

1140
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:36,490
Miss Dalton,
I am so sorry.

1141
01:02:36,524 --> 01:02:37,992
I seem to have
torn your dress.

1142
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,226
'Tis no matter,
Mr. Malcolm.

1143
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,961
It can easily be repaired.

1144
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:44,932
Please, call me Jeremy.

1145
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:48,202
Jeremy.

1146
01:03:00,981 --> 01:03:05,819
Did Mr. Malcolm mention
if Captain Ossory
has been invited?

1147
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:07,522
Yes. He told me
he's on the guest list.

1148
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:11,325
Ugh. What a bother
that man has become.

1149
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:14,495
[sighs] I shall have
to distract him, of course.

1150
01:03:14,529 --> 01:03:18,499
My dear, have you thought about
Captain Ossory for yourself?

1151
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:19,900
Mummy, no!

1152
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:26,106
He's a perfectly
good match,

1153
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,943
but far too low down
in comparison
to our own good standing.

1154
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:32,012
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:36,950
[gasps]
We're here.

1156
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:45,859
Well, that certainly
looks impressive.

1157
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:05,346
A Mrs. Thistlewaite,
Miss Thistlewaite
and Miss Dalton, my lady.

1158
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:08,349
My darling Selina.

1159
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,353
Mama!
I missed you so much!

1160
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:14,355
My little chickpea!

1161
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:16,658
[Mrs. Dalton]
You look so well!

1162
01:04:16,691 --> 01:04:18,492
[Malcolm]
Welcome to Hadley Hall.

1163
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:21,028
Thank you.
It is beautiful.

1164
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:24,031
A little smaller
in real life.

1165
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:30,672
May I present my mother
Elizabeth Malcolm,
the Countess of Kilbourne.

1166
01:04:30,705 --> 01:04:33,073
Lady Kilbourne
will do just fine.

1167
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,242
Mrs. Howard will
show you to your rooms.

1168
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:38,112
I thought you might like
to refresh yourselves
before joining us for tea.

1169
01:04:38,145 --> 01:04:39,446
That would be lovely.

1170
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:43,050
How's Kitty?

1171
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:46,186
[Mr. Dalton]
She was pining a little bit,
but she'll be fine.

1172
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:49,524
Miss Dalton...

1173
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,395
I am very happy
you're here.

1174
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:57,331
I am very happy
to be here.

1175
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,439
The stables
are in the East Wing.

1176
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:10,444
[grunts]
I could get used
to the country.

1177
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:14,281
One day, I'll buy
a house just like this.

1178
01:05:14,314 --> 01:05:16,417
[laughs]
Not on your salary.

1179
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,553
[groaning]

1180
01:05:20,522 --> 01:05:24,391
My son tells me
you were raised in Sussex,
Miss Dalton.

1181
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:25,627
Yes, my lady.

1182
01:05:26,594 --> 01:05:28,563
Which part of Sussex?

1183
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:29,597
Chailey.

1184
01:05:33,267 --> 01:05:38,071
And, Mr. Dalton,
I believe you still serve
as vicar there?

1185
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:41,208
Yes, my lady,
coming on nearly
20 years now.

1186
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:44,646
And, Mrs. Dalton,
are your people
from Sussex as well?

1187
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:48,148
My family's name
is Kingswater.

1188
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,384
Kingswater.

1189
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:57,157
I'm afraid I do not know
any Kingswaters.

1190
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:02,162
[Mr. Dalton clears throat]
[bell chimes]

1191
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:10,270
Mrs. Thistlewaite,
we cannot thank you enough

1192
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:11,972
for taking care
of our Selina.

1193
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:14,475
It's been no problem
at all.

1194
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:19,146
Selina, I forgot to ask you
how Mrs. Covington is.

1195
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:21,215
Did you call on her
as I asked?

1196
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:25,620
Mrs. Covington
is the widow of my cousin.
She lives in town.

1197
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:28,690
[coughing]

1198
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:30,692
I did run into
Mrs. Covington.

1199
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,326
[Mrs. Dalton] Good.
I'm glad to hear it.

1200
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:39,466
Her husband
was my second cousin only,
but she is a widow.

1201
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:43,470
Mrs. Dalton and myself
have always taught Selina
to show compassion

1202
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:46,173
to those in less fortunate
circumstances.

1203
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:51,478
Pray, excuse me
as I take a turn about the room.

1204
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:55,048
He fell at Waterloo.
He died a hero's death
by all accounts.

1205
01:06:55,082 --> 01:06:58,118
Cut down by cannon
while defending
Wellington's flank.

1206
01:06:59,486 --> 01:07:01,556
There was nothing left
of him to bury,

1207
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:05,527
so we were forced
to conduct his funeral
in absentia.

1208
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,761
[Lady Kilbourne]
Terribly sad.

1209
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:08,596
Miss Dalton.

1210
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:10,765
I do not care
that Mrs. Covington
is your cousin

1211
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:12,466
and I am sorry
I gave that impression.

1212
01:07:12,499 --> 01:07:14,134
It is I
who must apologize.

1213
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:16,336
I think you were concerned
for my good opinion

1214
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:19,641
and thought
if you told the truth,
you'd lose it.

1215
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:21,809
It is my fault.

1216
01:07:21,843 --> 01:07:25,345
I sounded dreadfully arrogant
and I have regretted it
many times since.

1217
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,615
I've been wanting
to tell you the truth,
but I--

1218
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:28,616
I believe you.

1219
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:33,253
Then let's forget all about
this foolish incident.

1220
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:35,523
It does neither of us
any good to harp on it.

1221
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:42,095
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Dalton,
perhaps you could write
to your cousin

1222
01:07:42,129 --> 01:07:44,431
and invite her
to join us
at next week's ball.

1223
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:47,167
That sounds like
such a fun idea.

1224
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,771
Don't you agree,
Mr. Dalton?
Yes.

1225
01:07:49,804 --> 01:07:53,608
Well, I am confident
that the behavior
that prevails

1226
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:57,579
at these occasions in town
will not permit here.

1227
01:07:57,612 --> 01:08:01,114
Mr. Malcolm seems
a very trustworthy gentleman.

1228
01:08:03,183 --> 01:08:05,553
[knocking]
[Julia] <i>Selina?</i>

1229
01:08:07,722 --> 01:08:09,089
May I come in?

1230
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:11,425
[sighs]

1231
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:14,227
Selina, I...

1232
01:08:16,163 --> 01:08:18,198
I think it is time.

1233
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:21,368
If you think
it is time for bed,
I can only agree.

1234
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,871
[chuckles]
No.

1235
01:08:23,905 --> 01:08:28,643
I think it is time
to show Mr. Malcolm
your list.

1236
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,556
Julia...

1237
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:45,760
I know Mr. Malcolm
hurt your feelings
and I am so sorry.

1238
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:47,361
What are you saying?

1239
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:49,296
I am saying

1240
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:53,200
that I do not think
Mr. Malcolm is
the man you think he is.

1241
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:54,636
I see.

1242
01:08:56,604 --> 01:09:00,508
Now that you have seen
Hadley Hall
and seen how rich he is,

1243
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,844
you think you can get him
to marry you, is that it?

1244
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:04,612
I wonder if you would
like him as much

1245
01:09:04,646 --> 01:09:08,415
if he was
a poverty-stricken curate
from Yorkshire.

1246
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:10,785
No, that is not it!

1247
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:13,788
I am not interested
in Mr. Malcolm
because of his possessions.

1248
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:15,790
[scoffs]

1249
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:18,926
He has been kind to me.

1250
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:24,398
You agreed to help me.

1251
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,300
We were in this together.

1252
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:30,437
I don't feel Mr. Malcolm
deserves such treatment.

1253
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,740
And I?

1254
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:35,275
You think I deserve
such treatment?

1255
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:40,748
I was humiliated
in front of the whole
of good society.

1256
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:42,550
Have you never
offended anyone?

1257
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:45,653
It happens.

1258
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:46,386
Frequently!

1259
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:51,291
No one wants a person
incapable of forgiveness
for a friend.

1260
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:54,428
And I don't want
a prosy preacher's daughter
for a friend.

1261
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:57,965
[exclaims]

1262
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,502
This is mine!

1263
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:08,609
[door slams]

1264
01:10:08,643 --> 01:10:10,511
[Malcolm] What was that?

1265
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,680
[Lady Kilbourne]
Probably that Miss Thistlewaite.

1266
01:10:12,714 --> 01:10:14,782
She looks the
door-slamming type
to me.

1267
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:19,252
Thank you, Reeves.

1268
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:24,859
What surprises me
is that she did not
set her cap for you.

1269
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:28,596
She did, at first.
It was short-lived.

1270
01:10:29,831 --> 01:10:30,765
What happened?

1271
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:37,505
Well, I took her
to the opera once and...

1272
01:10:37,538 --> 01:10:39,741
did not call again.

1273
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:41,441
It died a natural death.

1274
01:10:41,475 --> 01:10:44,045
Hmm.
So you think.

1275
01:10:44,078 --> 01:10:47,949
I doubt she'd forget
that kind of rejection
very quickly.

1276
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:52,653
She's not enjoying
taking second place
to your Miss Dalton.

1277
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:56,591
She's not my Miss Dalton.

1278
01:10:56,624 --> 01:10:57,859
Not yet.

1279
01:10:57,892 --> 01:10:59,727
Yes, I know.

1280
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:04,632
I do wish you would hurry
the business.

1281
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:07,769
You know how much
I detest entertaining.

1282
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:10,705
So, you approve?

1283
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:14,307
If I had
my wits about me,

1284
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:17,512
I'd persuade you
to marry some silly,
ignorant girl

1285
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:20,313
against whom
I would not suffer
in comparison.

1286
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:22,650
Someone like
your brother's wife.

1287
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:28,823
Mother, you would suffer
no matter whom I married.

1288
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:32,527
And surely
you must know by now,

1289
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,830
relations by marriage
were designed to aid us
in developing our character.

1290
01:11:37,098 --> 01:11:38,633
Selina...

1291
01:11:40,101 --> 01:11:43,604
Selina is a gift from God
in that regard.

1292
01:11:43,638 --> 01:11:46,574
And far be it for me
to question the Almighty.

1293
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:49,342
Mr. Dalton would not approve.

1294
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:51,712
Checkmate.

1295
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:53,781
Yes, Mother. I know.

1296
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:55,382
[chuckles]

1297
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,488
[bird squawks]
[gun fires]

1298
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:04,525
[dog barks]
[Selina] Well done.

1299
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:05,760
Thank you, sir.

1300
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:09,429
Selina!
Captain Ossory!

1301
01:12:09,462 --> 01:12:11,799
[Julia] I think it should be
a masquerade.
They're all the rage.

1302
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,768
[Cassidy]
Yeah, but I have to wear
a mask though.

1303
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:16,369
[Julia] It's not up to you.
It's Mr. Malcolm's home.

1304
01:12:16,403 --> 01:12:18,139
[Cassidy]
Of course it is, but...
[sighs]

1305
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:21,108
We were just discussing
next week's ball.

1306
01:12:21,142 --> 01:12:24,579
Right.
Julia wants it to be
a masquerade.

1307
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:26,113
What is your opinion?

1308
01:12:26,147 --> 01:12:29,482
Well, I've never been
to a masquerade before.

1309
01:12:29,517 --> 01:12:31,118
See, Mr. Malcolm?

1310
01:12:31,152 --> 01:12:34,487
It must be a masquerade.
Selina has never been to one.

1311
01:12:34,522 --> 01:12:35,857
Then it's decided.

1312
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,758
A masquerade it is.

1313
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:40,127
I do believe we have
some costumes
in the attic, sir.

1314
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:41,963
Excellent.
Thank you, Reeves.

1315
01:12:41,996 --> 01:12:45,032
Everyone feel free
to help yourselves.
Thank you.

1316
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:47,668
I should be able to find
what I need at the dressmakers.

1317
01:12:47,702 --> 01:12:49,704
Do you plan on
going as a lady?

1318
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:52,472
Of course not. A Greek.

1319
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,408
Any particular Greek?

1320
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:57,111
[Cassidy]
Any Greek will do.

1321
01:12:57,144 --> 01:12:59,146
-Julius Caesar.
-[laughs]

1322
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,481
Julius Caesar
was Roman.

1323
01:13:01,515 --> 01:13:03,184
Greek, Roman,
it scarcely matters.

1324
01:13:03,217 --> 01:13:04,719
I plan to wear
a white robe

1325
01:13:04,752 --> 01:13:06,721
and some leaves
over my ears.

1326
01:13:06,754 --> 01:13:09,123
I went to one
of these blasted things
as Henry VIII once.

1327
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:10,658
I almost suffocated.

1328
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:11,859
I remember.

1329
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:14,128
What are you wearing,
Selina?

1330
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:18,099
Um...
I have no idea.

1331
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:22,136
I was hoping
to get some inspiration
once I visited the attic.

1332
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:24,171
Why not go
as your namesake?

1333
01:13:24,205 --> 01:13:25,706
Who do you mean?

1334
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,175
Selene, goddess of the moon.

1335
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,780
Cassie has already taken
my costume.

1336
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:35,716
I told you,
I'm not going as a woman.

1337
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,885
I'll be one
of those, um...

1338
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:42,623
[stammers]
philosophical fellows,
like Plato or Socrates.

1339
01:13:42,657 --> 01:13:45,726
My cousin going as
one of the deepest thinkers
in history.

1340
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,561
That does quite
boggle the mind.

1341
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:48,996
[all laugh]

1342
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,166
So will you go
as Selene?

1343
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:55,536
I have no objection
masquerading as a goddess.

1344
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,640
Who is this Selene?

1345
01:13:59,674 --> 01:14:01,509
Selene was
the goddess of the moon,

1346
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,544
which she drove across
the sky every night.

1347
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:06,479
The story goes that
she fell in love
with a mere mortal

1348
01:14:06,514 --> 01:14:09,784
who was far beneath her,
both literally
and metaphorically.

1349
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,119
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

1350
01:14:12,153 --> 01:14:14,055
I had no idea
military men had such

1351
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:16,524
an intimate understanding
of mythology.

1352
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:19,627
Oh, I think there's
quite a lot you don't know
about military men.

1353
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:26,968
Selina, I would be happy
to assist you
with your costume.

1354
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:30,204
I could take some designs
to my dressmaker
when I head into town.

1355
01:14:31,605 --> 01:14:33,941
Why, thank you, Julia.
Mmm.

1356
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:38,946
Right.
Miss Thistlewaite,
let's shoot something.

1357
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,052
[sighs] If we must.

1358
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:48,289
Gentlemen.

1359
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:52,793
Now, the trick is
keep the stock tight
to your chest

1360
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:56,263
and shoot where the bird
will be rather than
where it is. All right?

1361
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:58,566
[clears throat]

1362
01:14:58,599 --> 01:14:59,700
[Ossory] Thank you, sir.

1363
01:15:02,303 --> 01:15:04,972

-[Ossory laughs]
-[dog barks]

1367
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,717
Hmm. I think I've got it.

1368
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:20,755
I've never seen
a woman do that before.

1369
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:23,224
I suppose
that's a compliment.

1370
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:24,825
It most certainly is,
yes.

1371
01:15:31,732 --> 01:15:32,900
[bird squawks]

1372
01:15:34,101 --> 01:15:36,670

01:15:43,044 --> 01:15:44,745
[chattering, laughing]

1374
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:55,790
Mr. Dalton,
is that really the best
you could have done?

1375
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:02,263
Oh, Mr. Malcolm,

1376
01:16:02,296 --> 01:16:07,168
what a pleasure
to be invited to
your very impressive home.

1377
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:10,704
You must be very thirsty,
Mrs. Covington. Allow me
to escort you to get some punch.

1378
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:13,941
How gracious, Mr. Malcolm.

1379
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:16,911
You, the host.

1380
01:16:16,944 --> 01:16:19,914
I knew what they said
about him couldn't be true.

1381
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:21,849
Shall we?
Oh, yes.

1382
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:23,050
Mother.

1383
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:25,920
[Mrs. Covington laughs]

1384
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:29,690
Oh.

1385
01:16:34,862 --> 01:16:36,730
Cassie.
Yes.

1386
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:38,232
I must speak with you.

1387
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:40,367
You know, Julia,
I must say,

1388
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:43,104
I don't know why
ladies complain about having
to wear feminine attire.

1389
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:44,405
This is quite
a bit more comfortable

1390
01:16:44,438 --> 01:16:46,207
than knee breeches,
I can tell you.

1391
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,642
When I walk,
there's the most
refreshing breeze.

1392
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:52,813
Cousin, I did not come here
to discuss the benefits
of wearing a dress.

1393
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:54,081
It's not a dress.

1394
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:59,186
I need to talk to you
about Selina and Malcolm.

1395
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:03,858
Ah. I see.

1396
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,359
You've finally caught on
to the fact

1397
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:07,161
that all your scheming
was for nothing.

1398
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:10,397
Well, I knew that
all along.

1399
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:12,766
I knew they were
perfectly suited
to each other.

1400
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:17,304
I imagine that must sting
just a little bit.

1401
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:19,740
You thought
to humiliate Malcolm,

1402
01:17:19,773 --> 01:17:22,943
and you end up presenting him
with the perfect wife
on a silver platter.

1403
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:28,816
A pirate!

1404
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:31,652
You know, Julia,
you and Malcolm...

1405
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:35,322
you're much more alike
than you've considered.

1406
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:38,826
You really shouldn't be
so damned picky,

1407
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:41,095
or you might
miss your chance.

1408
01:17:41,128 --> 01:17:42,129
Boop!

1409
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,269
I'm going to go.

1410
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:51,438
Well, I almost didn't
recognize you there,
Miss Thistlewaite.

1411
01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:53,974
Captain Ossory,
is that you?

1412
01:17:54,008 --> 01:17:55,943
Your costume is
very out of character.

1413
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:57,745
I'm not sure
how to take that remark.

1414
01:17:57,778 --> 01:18:01,315
Do you find me
dull and spiritless,

1415
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:04,985
not manly enough
for swashbuckling adventure?

1416
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:07,188
[scoffs] No.

1417
01:18:08,422 --> 01:18:10,424
No,
I find you quite manly.

1418
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:16,497
I'm not entirely sure
how we strayed onto
that topic.

1419
01:18:16,531 --> 01:18:18,399
[laughs]

1420
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:20,734
The fault
is entirely mine,

1421
01:18:20,768 --> 01:18:24,205
though I cannot regret
the unintentional compliment
you gave me.

1422
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:26,440
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare your wigs

1423
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:28,209
and hoist your dresses...

1424
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:30,911
Shall we?
...for the quadrille.

1425
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:33,347
[guests applauding]

1426
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,450
Which is quite nice.
It's just a bit
of fabric really.

1427
01:18:36,483 --> 01:18:40,421
[guest] Julia Thistlewaite
dancing with a military man?
Well, I never!

1428
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:45,159
[orchestra playing quadrille]

1429
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:54,335
By the way,
it's me, John.

1430
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:56,470
[Molly] Well, she's quite taken
by him, isn't she?

1431
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:02,510
Finally.

1432
01:19:04,278 --> 01:19:06,947
My daughter, dancing
with the captain?

1433
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:08,949
That is joyous.

1434
01:19:15,823 --> 01:19:19,460
[all exclaiming]

1435
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,462
Mother,
have you seen Selina?

1436
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:25,099
Well, it's not
the easiest of tasks
this evening, dear.

1437
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,406
[music stops]
[guests applauding]

1438
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:45,119
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, the waltz.

1439
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:49,256
May I, a mere mortal,

1440
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:51,825
beg of the goddess Selene
the honor of this dance?

1441
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,061
You may.

1442
01:20:03,304 --> 01:20:06,173
[orchestra playing waltz]

1443
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:11,879
[guest 1] Her mask,
isn't that wonderful?

1444
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:14,281
[guest 2]
That's Selina Dalton.
[guest 3] Oh, my.

1445
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:16,850
She is quite beautiful.

1446
01:20:16,884 --> 01:20:19,420
[Lucy] Mr. Malcolm is dancing.

1447
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:21,623
[Lady Margaret] Is that
Julia Thistlewaite's friend?

1448
01:20:21,656 --> 01:20:23,857
She's a complete nonentity.

1449
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:26,226
Her father is
a country vicar.

1450
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,530
Well, he told me
he couldn't dance.

1451
01:20:34,468 --> 01:20:37,204
Mr. Dalton, look.

1452
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:44,445
[chuckles]

1453
01:20:47,081 --> 01:20:49,249
[chuckles]
Oh!

1454
01:20:49,283 --> 01:20:51,185
[laughs]

1455
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:53,120
Well, hello, sir.
[giggles]

1456
01:20:54,922 --> 01:20:57,291
Well, it appears
there may be
wedding bells soon.

1457
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:08,969
Thank you for the company,
but I really must go.

1458
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:10,170
Wait, Ju--

1459
01:21:11,338 --> 01:21:12,873
Julia.

1460
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:23,645
Selina, I--

1461
01:22:23,678 --> 01:22:25,279
Miss Dalton!

1462
01:22:25,312 --> 01:22:27,014
Miss Thistlewaite
needs you immediately.

1463
01:22:27,549 --> 01:22:29,349
Come.

1464
01:22:29,383 --> 01:22:31,586
Mr. Malcolm,
please excuse me.

1465
01:22:31,619 --> 01:22:33,353
What is it?
[Molly whimpers]

1466
01:22:43,464 --> 01:22:45,299
Molly,
where are you taking me?

1467
01:22:45,332 --> 01:22:47,569
She is just
through here, Miss.

1468
01:22:51,405 --> 01:22:52,507
[door closes]

1469
01:22:56,678 --> 01:22:57,745
Molly!

1470
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,481
Molly!

1471
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,562
For Mr. Malcolm.

1472
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:16,531
[Ossory]
She's too good for you,
you know.

1473
01:23:16,564 --> 01:23:18,700
[Malcolm]
That I believe wholeheartedly.

1474
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,735
Thank you, Reeves.

1475
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:30,244
I have an appointment
in my study
with a certain lady.

1476
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:32,747
Wish me luck, old boy.

1477
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:35,048
Next time you see me,
hopefully I'll be betrothed.

1478
01:23:35,082 --> 01:23:37,819
I would wish you luck,
but I don't think
you'll need it.

1479
01:23:37,852 --> 01:23:40,588
Well, you cast your eye.
The night is young.

1480
01:23:50,832 --> 01:23:52,032
Julia!

1481
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:08,550
[door closes]

1482
01:24:13,353 --> 01:24:15,255
This reminds me
of our first meeting.

1483
01:24:16,591 --> 01:24:18,392
Do you remember
what you said to me?

1484
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:23,497
I said I thought
hope a futile thing,

1485
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:25,065
and you disagreed with me.

1486
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:32,172
Yet you said you hoped
I obtained what
I was looking for.

1487
01:24:34,274 --> 01:24:38,713
You had little idea
the thing I was looking for

1488
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,617
was you.

1489
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:46,219
I wanted to wait,
at least until the end
of the house party.

1490
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:49,423
But I do not think I could be
any more convinced

1491
01:24:49,456 --> 01:24:51,158
than I am right now.

1492
01:24:54,361 --> 01:24:55,697
Selina...

1493
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:01,335
would you do me the great honor
of becoming my wife?

1494
01:25:02,804 --> 01:25:04,237
What's this?

1495
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:08,275
"Qualifications for a husband.

1496
01:25:08,308 --> 01:25:12,346
Does not make others feel
as if they cannot live up
to an impossible standard."

1497
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:14,749
No, Selina.

1498
01:25:14,782 --> 01:25:16,416
Selina, wait!

1499
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,451
Selina!

1500
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:24,525
[door rattles, opens]

1501
01:25:24,559 --> 01:25:25,760
Julia!

1502
01:25:25,793 --> 01:25:27,729
[chattering, laughing]

1503
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:32,867
Selina, aren't you
supposed to be
in the study?

1504
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,669
What?

1505
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:36,904
With Malcolm.
He said he was
meeting you there.

1506
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:39,139
I made no appointment
with Mr. Malcolm.

1507
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,611
Please excuse me.
Uh...

1508
01:25:44,912 --> 01:25:46,714
Is everything all right?

1509
01:25:46,748 --> 01:25:47,782
I don't know.

1510
01:25:50,952 --> 01:25:52,152
Julia!

1511
01:25:57,892 --> 01:26:00,928
What-- What is
the meaning of this?

1512
01:26:00,962 --> 01:26:02,329
[Malcolm] Selina, wait!

1513
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:09,436
Wh-What's this?

1514
01:26:09,469 --> 01:26:11,873
I think you'd
best explain yourself, Julia.

1515
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:14,274
Miss Thistlewaite?

1516
01:26:15,677 --> 01:26:17,779
So it was you who refused
my offer just now.

1517
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:18,880
Offer?

1518
01:26:21,783 --> 01:26:22,784
Well?

1519
01:26:23,818 --> 01:26:25,318
It's his own fault.

1520
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:32,794
You spurned me publicly.

1521
01:26:32,827 --> 01:26:37,598
All because I didn't meet
a qualification
on that cruel list of yours.

1522
01:26:40,935 --> 01:26:43,705
So yes,
I decided to show you

1523
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:46,908
what it feels like
to be judged
and found wanting.

1524
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:51,344
Can you blame me
for enlisting Selina
in the--

1525
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,346
Selina?
[laughs]

1526
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:58,986
Don't tell me you had
a part to play in this?

1527
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,522
Julia mentioned it
to me.

1528
01:27:01,556 --> 01:27:03,558
But you cannot think I--
Please.

1529
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:05,827
The time for pretense
is over.

1530
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:08,863
I never engaged
in any pretense.

1531
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:12,299
So you did not lie to me
and tell me Mrs. Covington
was not your cousin?

1532
01:27:12,332 --> 01:27:14,535
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,
the cotillion.

1533
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:17,739
Good God,
what a fool I have been.

1534
01:27:17,772 --> 01:27:20,273
[orchestra playing cotillion]
I should have known
from then.

1535
01:27:22,977 --> 01:27:24,344
J-Jeremy.

1536
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:26,981
You will call me
Mr. Malcolm.

1537
01:27:29,050 --> 01:27:32,987
M-Mr. Malcolm,
please hear me out
before you condemn me.

1538
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,423
And how can I believe
a word you say?

1539
01:27:36,456 --> 01:27:38,760
It seems you have been
deceiving me
from the beginning.

1540
01:27:38,793 --> 01:27:40,962
Malcolm, perhaps you should
listen to what
she has to say.

1541
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:43,296
I hardly think you're
the appropriate person
to counsel me.

1542
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:45,032
It's obvious they've
beguiled you as well.

1543
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:48,636
[guests exclaiming]
[music continues playing]

1544
01:27:48,669 --> 01:27:52,439
If you will excuse me,
I am in the middle
of hosting a ball.

1545
01:27:53,608 --> 01:27:55,676
A masquerade,
ironically.

1546
01:28:01,682 --> 01:28:05,352
Do you see?
Do you see now
how arrogant he is?

1547
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,021
How could you stand there
and say nothing?

1548
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:11,759
Well, if you're wondering
whether to lock me in my room,

1549
01:28:11,793 --> 01:28:15,362
I can assure you,
I do not intend
on coming down again tonight.

1550
01:28:15,395 --> 01:28:16,764
Selina--
Don't bother.

1551
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:24,038
Are you satisfied
with your behavior, Julia?

1552
01:28:25,106 --> 01:28:26,774
Course not.

1553
01:28:28,943 --> 01:28:31,311
Oh, I feel like
I'm going to be sick.

1554
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:37,450
I think it's best
I return to the ballroom.

1555
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:49,530
[sighs, sniffs]

1556
01:28:53,534 --> 01:28:56,571
[music stops]
[guests applauding]

1557
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,976
[crying]

1558
01:29:17,424 --> 01:29:19,492
[Molly]
Your shoulders down.

1559
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:22,495
[Molly chuckles]
Stop standing on my feet.

1560
01:29:25,498 --> 01:29:27,501
[quacking]

1561
01:29:30,504 --> 01:29:32,940
[Mr. Dalton] You disappeared
early last night.

1562
01:29:32,974 --> 01:29:34,575
[Selina] Did I?

1563
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:40,514
You know, Selina,

1564
01:29:40,548 --> 01:29:43,684
though Mr. Malcolm,
from what acquaintance
I have made of him,

1565
01:29:43,718 --> 01:29:44,752
appears true of heart,

1566
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:51,659
he is nevertheless
from an altogether
different sphere.

1567
01:29:53,995 --> 01:29:58,431
This decision
I have come to believe
you are making,

1568
01:29:58,465 --> 01:30:02,169
we want you to know
that it's yours and yours alone.

1569
01:30:02,203 --> 01:30:08,843
And even if you and Mr. Malcolm
should decide not to make
a match of it,

1570
01:30:08,876 --> 01:30:13,514
well, it's been nice
to have had a little holiday.

1571
01:30:15,683 --> 01:30:16,684
Papa.

1572
01:30:25,226 --> 01:30:26,493
[sighs]

1573
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:30,898
I'll leave you
to your thoughts.

1574
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,928
Though it pains me
to admit it,

1575
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:06,534
I have to concede
that you were right,

1576
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:07,735
and I was...

1577
01:31:09,570 --> 01:31:11,138
not entirely right.

1578
01:31:12,707 --> 01:31:14,875
[Reeves] That should
do the trick, sir.

1579
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:15,876
Thank you.

1580
01:31:16,844 --> 01:31:18,646
Oh, we must do something.

1581
01:31:18,679 --> 01:31:21,882
[groans]
I think that's how
this whole debacle began.

1582
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:24,085
Captain Ossory,

1583
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:28,589
what if you were to pretend
to woo Selina?

1584
01:31:28,622 --> 01:31:32,893
I think Malcolm
was jealous of you before.
It might work again.

1585
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:36,230
I don't think so.
I prefer to let them
work out matters for themselves.

1586
01:31:36,263 --> 01:31:39,266
Well, they don't appear to be
doing a very good job of it.

1587
01:31:40,968 --> 01:31:43,637
Malcolm has all but disappeared
since last night.

1588
01:31:45,339 --> 01:31:47,274
Cassie?
Hmm?

1589
01:31:47,308 --> 01:31:49,677
Would you give us
a moment, please?

1590
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,746
Yes, of course.

1591
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:53,948
I really should check
where Malcolm is anyway.

1592
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:56,217
[groans]

1593
01:31:58,986 --> 01:32:02,923
Captain Ossory,
it's all perfectly harmless.

1594
01:32:05,026 --> 01:32:09,663
I just want to ensure
that Malcolm values Selina
as he should.

1595
01:32:09,697 --> 01:32:11,332
Hmm.

1596
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:14,735
I think there have been
enough silly schemes.

1597
01:32:14,769 --> 01:32:16,237
Don't you think,
Miss Thistlewaite?

1598
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:19,106
But you wouldn't even
have to do anything.

1599
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:22,710
Although it might be a good idea
if you did pay Selina
a little extra attention.

1600
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:24,879
I refuse to pretend
an attraction I do not feel

1601
01:32:24,912 --> 01:32:27,314
and stand by
and let you ignore
the one that I do feel.

1602
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:33,654
But you came to London
to make a match with Selina.

1603
01:32:33,687 --> 01:32:36,924
So now I'm not
even allowed to decide
to whom I'm attracted?

1604
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:43,064
Does this feel as though
I'm attracted to Miss Dalton?

1605
01:32:52,773 --> 01:32:53,542
Well?

1606
01:32:55,009 --> 01:32:58,212
I may not be a lord
or an honorable,

1607
01:32:58,245 --> 01:33:00,948
but I'm falling in love
with you, Julia.

1608
01:33:00,981 --> 01:33:02,983
And I plan on devoting
the rest of my life

1609
01:33:03,017 --> 01:33:06,754
to keeping those
nasty habits of yours
in check.

1610
01:33:06,787 --> 01:33:08,255
[both laugh]

1611
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:11,892
In fact, I positively
look forward to it.

1612
01:33:14,829 --> 01:33:16,197
Oh, Henry.

1613
01:33:41,188 --> 01:33:43,290
[neighs]
Shh.

1614
01:33:47,895 --> 01:33:50,831
Jeremy,
could we speak outside?

1615
01:33:50,865 --> 01:33:52,333
You know
I don't like horses.

1616
01:33:54,368 --> 01:33:58,139
You have some nerve,
after the trick
you all played on me.

1617
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,841
I was helping you.

1618
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,245
If only you had
the wit to see it.

1619
01:34:05,913 --> 01:34:08,449
'Tis true that Julia wanted
to humiliate you.

1620
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:10,985
I, on the other hand,
I knew Miss Dalton
was perfect for you

1621
01:34:11,018 --> 01:34:12,686
from the very beginning.

1622
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,156
Whether you thought
you were helping me or not,

1623
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,958
Miss Dalton used information
she obtained from you

1624
01:34:17,992 --> 01:34:21,295
about what I was looking for
in a wife to become that woman.

1625
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:23,998
I have absolutely no idea
who she actually is!

1626
01:34:24,031 --> 01:34:27,034
That is simply not true.

1627
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:30,938
She barely paid any attention
to anything that we said.

1628
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:34,775
[stammers] Well, except the--
the musical talent part.

1629
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:36,310
That she had to fake.

1630
01:34:36,343 --> 01:34:39,813
My point is,
if she had listened to us,

1631
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:43,217
she probably wouldn't have
attracted your notice at all.

1632
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,953
So what you're saying is
she's smarter than you
and Julia?

1633
01:34:45,986 --> 01:34:48,255
No, no, that's not
what I'm saying.

1634
01:34:48,289 --> 01:34:50,791
She is most likely smarter
than Julia or I--

1635
01:34:50,824 --> 01:34:52,259
For Christ's sake,
Cassie!

1636
01:34:52,293 --> 01:34:53,928
Dash it,
you're twisting my words.

1637
01:34:53,961 --> 01:34:57,765
What I'm trying to say,
Jeremy, is that if--

1638
01:34:57,798 --> 01:35:00,768
Selina Dalton
is the right woman for you,

1639
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:03,237
and if you ruin this,
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

1640
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:05,406
If I ruin this?

1641
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:07,808
Well, Lord Cassidy,
I appreciate your concern.

1642
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:10,044
However, nowhere on
my now-infamous list

1643
01:35:10,077 --> 01:35:12,913
does it specify deception,
lying or scheming.

1644
01:35:12,947 --> 01:35:15,015
I am no longer interested
in Miss Dalton

1645
01:35:15,049 --> 01:35:17,384
and can only regret
that I fell foul
of her little game.

1646
01:35:17,418 --> 01:35:19,320
Now,
if you will excuse me.

1647
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:25,459
[exhales]

1648
01:35:30,798 --> 01:35:32,032
[knocking]

1649
01:36:29,123 --> 01:36:31,225
I suppose I have you
to thank for this?

1650
01:36:32,359 --> 01:36:33,127
I beg your pardon?

1651
01:36:35,095 --> 01:36:39,233
If you had thought
to orchestrate
a compromising situation,

1652
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:42,836
I must admit, I had
thought you a great deal
cleverer than this.

1653
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:47,107
I received an invitation
to tour the gardens.

1654
01:36:47,141 --> 01:36:49,376
I assumed it to be
a group tour.

1655
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:52,179
I certainly did not plan
on meeting you here alone.

1656
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:54,882
I suppose it's coincidence
then that I too
received a note,

1657
01:36:54,915 --> 01:36:57,418
though mine spouted
some nonsense about

1658
01:36:57,451 --> 01:37:00,020
"a discussion that promises
great future benefit."

1659
01:37:02,489 --> 01:37:05,159
It's all very melodramatic,
now I think on it.

1660
01:37:06,427 --> 01:37:08,996
You are to be commended,
Miss Dalton.

1661
01:37:09,029 --> 01:37:13,133
I have avoided
a great number of attempts
to entrap me in matrimony,

1662
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:15,436
but never have
I met someone whose methods

1663
01:37:15,469 --> 01:37:19,273
are so obviously
contrived as you.

1664
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:27,147
You insufferable,
arrogant,

1665
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:29,283
conceited coxcomb.

1666
01:37:29,316 --> 01:37:35,022
I would never be content
to marry a man who holds
such a low opinion of me.

1667
01:37:35,055 --> 01:37:38,025
Well, this is a good thing
there has been
no such engagement.

1668
01:37:48,503 --> 01:37:52,206
I now wish I had taken
a more enthusiastic part

1669
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,542
in Julia's despicable scheme
to humble you,

1670
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,979
although I realize now
it would have never worked.

1671
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:04,586
She expected you
to fall in love with me.

1672
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:07,354
I have since learned
that you--

1673
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:10,991
that you are
incapable of love, sir.

1674
01:38:14,194 --> 01:38:16,029
Though perhaps
we're all better for it

1675
01:38:17,498 --> 01:38:19,400
because you're not
worthy of it, either.

1676
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:25,205
Goodbye, Mr. Malcolm.

1677
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:29,176
I wish you and your list
all the happiness in the world.

1678
01:38:31,078 --> 01:38:32,279
Miss Dalton!

1679
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,695
[knocking]

1680
01:38:49,263 --> 01:38:50,632
Selina.

1681
01:38:50,665 --> 01:38:51,699
Go away.

1682
01:38:56,069 --> 01:38:58,506
You have every right
to despise me.

1683
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,073
I despise myself.

1684
01:39:02,075 --> 01:39:04,978
-Good.
-I deserve that.

1685
01:39:05,012 --> 01:39:09,684
Selina, I don't know why
I went through with it.

1686
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:16,256
Initially,
I wanted revenge
on Mr. Malcolm.

1687
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:20,595
I was so angry that one man
could turn my entire life
into a farce.

1688
01:39:21,629 --> 01:39:23,731
But then I did want

1689
01:39:23,765 --> 01:39:27,000
to ruin your chances
with him as well.

1690
01:39:28,736 --> 01:39:29,970
Selina.

1691
01:39:32,607 --> 01:39:35,209
We both had the dream
of marrying for love.

1692
01:39:36,778 --> 01:39:40,247
And after all
of my failed seasons,
I...

1693
01:39:41,516 --> 01:39:43,016
I gave up hope.

1694
01:39:46,654 --> 01:39:49,524
You captured Malcolm's heart
without even trying.

1695
01:39:53,193 --> 01:39:55,496
And I was
so jealous of you.

1696
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:02,637
I couldn't bear
to see you succeeding
where I had failed.

1697
01:40:03,805 --> 01:40:05,573
It all seems
so silly now.

1698
01:40:07,107 --> 01:40:09,309
If I had just stopped,
I would have seen

1699
01:40:10,812 --> 01:40:13,413
that the only person
I was failing is you.

1700
01:40:14,816 --> 01:40:18,018
Selina, do you think
that you can forgive me?

1701
01:40:25,425 --> 01:40:26,426
[sighs]

1702
01:40:29,096 --> 01:40:30,832
Please,
please don't go.

1703
01:40:30,865 --> 01:40:33,433
We must reconcile you
with Malcolm.

1704
01:40:33,467 --> 01:40:37,204
I think you might have been
more correct in your reading
of Mr. Malcolm than I was.

1705
01:40:37,237 --> 01:40:39,641
That is very noble
of you, Selina.

1706
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:44,077
But is this
what you really want?

1707
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:54,288
I will have John
prepare my carriage for you.

1708
01:40:58,325 --> 01:40:59,393
Thank you.

1709
01:41:06,133 --> 01:41:07,769
Julia.
Yes?

1710
01:41:11,573 --> 01:41:13,808
I do want to thank you
before I leave.

1711
01:41:15,643 --> 01:41:18,746
Had it not been for your--
for your scheme,

1712
01:41:20,915 --> 01:41:24,552
I would have never experienced
what it feels like
to fall in love...

1713
01:41:26,754 --> 01:41:29,323
and that alone
makes me very content.

1714
01:41:35,195 --> 01:41:36,664
I'm happy for you.

1715
01:41:38,265 --> 01:41:39,734
What do you mean?

1716
01:41:40,835 --> 01:41:44,237
Henry.
He's a good man.

1717
01:41:45,907 --> 01:41:47,341
How did you know?

1718
01:41:48,776 --> 01:41:50,210
Cassie, of course.

1719
01:41:52,346 --> 01:41:56,116
I would have never expected
to fall in love
with someone like Henry.

1720
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,753
He's just so...

1721
01:42:02,356 --> 01:42:03,423
nice.

1722
01:42:04,926 --> 01:42:06,527
Now, Julia,

1723
01:42:07,695 --> 01:42:10,364
do not be
such a namby-pamby.

1724
01:42:47,902 --> 01:42:48,936
[John] Move on.

1725
01:42:48,970 --> 01:42:51,405
[carriage departing]

1726
01:42:59,379 --> 01:43:03,216
You do not look like
a man who has just
become happily engaged.

1727
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,853
That's because
I'm not happily engaged.

1728
01:43:05,887 --> 01:43:06,854
Miss Dalton has left.

1729
01:43:08,455 --> 01:43:11,291
You have ruined things,
haven't you?

1730
01:43:11,324 --> 01:43:13,695
And after all my efforts.

1731
01:43:16,798 --> 01:43:18,633
What--
What did you just say?

1732
01:43:18,666 --> 01:43:23,270
I am saying that I arranged
for a tour of the rose garden

1733
01:43:23,303 --> 01:43:24,605
at three o'clock.

1734
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,307
I assumed it would give
the two of you

1735
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:30,511
enough time alone together
to come to some sort
of betrothal.

1736
01:43:30,545 --> 01:43:31,411
Why did you--

1737
01:43:32,747 --> 01:43:34,749
Why did you not tell me
this earlier?

1738
01:43:34,782 --> 01:43:38,686
If I had known you were
in such a great hurry
to bungle things,

1739
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,557
you can be assured
I would not have exercised
such forbearance.

1740
01:43:43,891 --> 01:43:46,761
What did you do
to upset Miss Dalton so?

1741
01:43:46,794 --> 01:43:50,898
Nothing so serious. I merely
accused her of attempting
to entrap me in marriage.

1742
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:53,701
I must say,
Jeremiah,

1743
01:43:53,735 --> 01:43:56,637
I am quite
disappointed in you.

1744
01:43:56,671 --> 01:44:00,742
Mother--
I am well aware
that you have a list.

1745
01:44:00,775 --> 01:44:03,544
When I first learned of it,
I was concerned

1746
01:44:03,578 --> 01:44:06,748
that you had become
arrogant and judgmental.

1747
01:44:06,781 --> 01:44:12,319
But then I came to realize
your list is in the nature
of a shield.

1748
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:17,290
So many women
have pursued you
for your fortune

1749
01:44:17,324 --> 01:44:21,328
that you did not want to
give your heart to a woman
that might prove unworthy.

1750
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:27,802
But I have never met
so sincere a lady
as Miss Selina Dalton.

1751
01:44:27,835 --> 01:44:32,405
It is difficult
for you to let someone
past that guard

1752
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:35,009
that you've placed around
your heart.

1753
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:40,915
But unless you do,
you're in danger of losing
Miss Dalton's altogether.

1754
01:44:40,948 --> 01:44:44,952
Love cannot be planned
so carefully, my dear.

1755
01:44:44,986 --> 01:44:46,954
It will stir things up
a bit.

1756
01:44:48,055 --> 01:44:50,591
That is part of its charm.

1757
01:44:54,028 --> 01:44:56,063
I have to go after her.

1758
01:44:56,097 --> 01:44:59,066
There's no need
to look so apprehensive.
She will not eat you.

1759
01:45:00,601 --> 01:45:03,403
You've not seen her
in a temper.

1760
01:45:03,436 --> 01:45:04,839
She is a fearsome sight.

1761
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:08,475
And more beautiful than ever.

1762
01:45:11,478 --> 01:45:13,413
[Cassidy] It's the way
that they look at me.

1763
01:45:13,446 --> 01:45:14,982
This one reminds me
of Great Uncle Vivian.

1764
01:45:15,016 --> 01:45:16,918
Yeah, Julia,
he was killed by a horse.

1765
01:45:21,622 --> 01:45:22,723
Do you know
where she's going?

1766
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:27,728
She's gone back to Sussex.
Her parents follow tomorrow.

1767
01:45:27,762 --> 01:45:29,063
Thank you.

1768
01:45:29,096 --> 01:45:32,099
And thank you, Cassie.
You were right.

1769
01:45:32,133 --> 01:45:33,534
I was--
I was right?

1770
01:45:33,568 --> 01:45:35,570
Of course
I was right!

1771
01:45:41,676 --> 01:45:42,710
Miss Thistlewaite.

1772
01:45:43,511 --> 01:45:44,979
I am sorry.

1773
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:46,113
I'm sorry too.

1774
01:45:47,782 --> 01:45:49,650
-Let's go.
-Go, Malcolm. Go!

1775
01:45:49,684 --> 01:45:51,953
Go!
Go, Malcolm!
[laughs]

1776
01:46:30,091 --> 01:46:31,125
Hyah!

1777
01:46:49,543 --> 01:46:51,178
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

1778
01:46:59,253 --> 01:47:00,821
[exclaims]
[whinnies]

1779
01:47:04,491 --> 01:47:07,728
[panting] Are you trying
to get us both killed?

1780
01:47:07,762 --> 01:47:10,531
I realized I forgot
to give you something
before you left.

1781
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:13,668
What is it?

1782
01:47:15,703 --> 01:47:19,974
[Selina scoffs]
Do not tell me that is
your infamous list.

1783
01:47:20,007 --> 01:47:21,876
No.

1784
01:47:21,909 --> 01:47:24,645
It's a new list
that I just composed.

1785
01:47:27,081 --> 01:47:28,182
Please?

1786
01:47:36,991 --> 01:47:40,628
I would like to offer
an explanation for the
deplorable way I've treated you

1787
01:47:40,661 --> 01:47:43,664
since I found out
Miss Thistlewaite's plot

1788
01:47:43,698 --> 01:47:46,934
and then again
this afternoon
in the rose garden.

1789
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:51,672
Though it pains me
to admit,

1790
01:47:51,706 --> 01:47:54,909
I was relieved
to find an excuse
to discredit you.

1791
01:47:56,877 --> 01:47:59,046
There is
a certain feeling of...

1792
01:48:00,748 --> 01:48:01,849
insecurity

1793
01:48:03,651 --> 01:48:05,086
when you find yourself
falling in love with someone.

1794
01:48:07,688 --> 01:48:11,859
And I can only hope
that you will forgive me
for being a misguided fool.

1795
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:15,730
Miss Selina Dalton,

1796
01:48:17,164 --> 01:48:22,269
I have loved you deeply

1797
01:48:22,303 --> 01:48:25,740
from the moment
I saw you in the moonlight
of that orangery.

1798
01:48:27,108 --> 01:48:28,809
You are everything...

1799
01:48:30,211 --> 01:48:32,179
everything I could have
ever hoped for.

1800
01:48:34,048 --> 01:48:37,284
You are
the "chief happiness
this world affords,"

1801
01:48:37,318 --> 01:48:39,286
to misquote Johnson.

1802
01:48:41,622 --> 01:48:43,190
And I would count myself

1803
01:48:43,224 --> 01:48:45,760
the most fortunate
and humble of men

1804
01:48:47,294 --> 01:48:48,896
if you would
be my wife.

1805
01:49:21,095 --> 01:49:22,930
You have yet
to give me an answer.

1806
01:49:26,934 --> 01:49:28,235
Tell me, though...

1807
01:49:30,805 --> 01:49:33,140
what opinion do you hold
on the Corn Laws?

1808
01:49:34,875 --> 01:49:36,343
[laughs]

1809
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:39,313
Has every stupid thing
I've ever said or done

1810
01:49:39,346 --> 01:49:41,048
been announced
to the entire world?

1811
01:49:42,249 --> 01:49:45,152
Jeremy, of course
I will marry you.
