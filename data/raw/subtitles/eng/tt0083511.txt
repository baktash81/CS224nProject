1
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,118
Wonder what reservation
they let him off of.

2
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,709
Excuse me, sir.

3
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,546
But my truck's overheating,
and it's 30 miles to the next station.

4
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,250
Can I get some water out of your cooler,
please, sir?

5
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:35,469
Maybe you should've stole
a better truck, Tonto.

6
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,762
You got a big mouth, convict.

7
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,523
Take it easy, Chief. He's only joking.

8
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,267
Okay. Can I have the water, please, sir?

9
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:52,812
Firewater, Tonto?
Is that what you mean?

10
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:54,404
Firewater, huh?

11
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:57,074
Hey! Jesus Christ!

12
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,951
Hold it!

13
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:02,079
He's a state prisoner, you asshole!

14
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,915
Goddamn you two! Knock it off!

15
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,876
Hold it, you asshole!

16
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,716
Get out of the way!

17
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,056
Don't move, convict!

18
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:33,477
Fuck you!

19
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,696
APO 657, unit 25 to APO 478!

20
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,224
Roger, APO.

21
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,692
Escape in progress! Two officers shot!

22
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:42,995
Fugitives are driving
a blue flatbed pickup truck!

23
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,614
Two men! One of them is an Indian!

24
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:48,701
Tall! 6'4", 200 pounds.

25
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:52,538
The other one's Albert Ganz.
They're armed and dangerous.

26
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,040
God, we need help! Get it here quick!

27
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,876
Say again, 25.

28
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,378
Escape in progress! Two fugitives!

29
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,972
One Indian and prisoner Albert Ganz!

30
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:48,427
You know, if you let me come over
to your place once in a while,

31
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:51,104
you could put on a clean shirt
in the morning.

32
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:56,193
What makes you think
I got any clean shirts at my place?

33
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,368
Great morning.

34
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:15,879
Yeah. I want her young, tall, thin.

35
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:18,874
Yeah, real thin.
She's got to have nice legs.

36
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:21,009
Yeah. Legs are important.

37
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,964
No, no jeans. I don't like jeans.
Jeans are cheap.

38
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:28,058
A dress. Yeah, a nice summer dress.

39
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,219
I want her fresh, you know?

40
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,479
No, I know you don't get it.

41
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,723
Hey, what about me?

42
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:37,526
Yeah. And I need one more
for my friend.

43
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,070
Now, make her an Indian.

44
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:43,407
No, not with a turban.
You know, a squaw.

45
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,409
Yeah.

46
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,403
It'll be the Walden hotel.

47
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:49,279
That's 3rd, near Broadway.

48
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,833
And you tell them to ask for Polson.

49
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,410
G.P. Polson.

50
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,712
Yeah. P-O-L-S-O-N.

51
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,589
Just be a couple of hours.

52
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,133
Right.

53
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,311
That's a fairly crummy way
to start a morning.

54
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,147
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.

55
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,815
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

56
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,155
Maybe you don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

57
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:30,871
Jack, when you start with that attitude,
it's like I don't even know who you are.

58
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,458
What do you want to know?
And what difference does it make?

59
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,385
I make you feel good,
you make me feel good.

60
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,787
Now, what the hell more do you want
from a guy?

61
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,964
I wish you'd stop trying
to make me mad.

62
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:44,176
I don't have time for this.
I got to go to work.

63
00:08:00,234 --> 00:08:02,152
You really are hopeless.

64
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,322
That's what I always say.

65
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,566
Call me later.

66
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,068
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

67
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,570
Good. Thanks for the coffee.

68
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,670
Okay.

69
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:14,740
- Oh, hey, Jack.
- Yeah.

70
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,949
Here, take this.

71
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:18,714
It's cold as hell out these mornings,
and you know what the man said.

72
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:19,711
No.

73
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:24,132
"The coldest winter I ever spent was
a summer I spent in San Francisco."

74
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,576
No, we ain't going by the store again.

75
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:30,816
I told you a million fucking times,
we start slow, we save a little bit.

76
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,156
- We go with that way.
- But I liked that carpet we saw.

77
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:34,486
We can't afford it.

78
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:36,697
Don't remind me.
I know we can't afford it.

79
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:38,073
I'm just saying I liked it.

80
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,675
You don't have to get crabby about it.

81
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,327
What do you want me to do?
Go out and steal for the money?

82
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:45,172
I hated the color anyway.
The color sucked.

83
00:09:46,632 --> 00:09:47,632
Wait.

84
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:52,796
- Surprise, Luther.
- What do you want?

85
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:55,296
- I thought you were locked up.
- I want the money, asshole.

86
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,146
What do you think?
The money that Reggie hid.

87
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:58,802
I don't know what you're talking about.

88
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,971
Want that Indian to snap her neck?

89
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,099
Instead of worrying about Reggie,
you better start worrying about me.

90
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,143
Don't give me this. We were partners!

91
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,436
Go ahead, Billy. Break it.

92
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:09,688
No! Don't hurt her.

93
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,823
- I can get you the money.
- When?

94
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:14,401
I can't get it till Monday. Honest.

95
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:15,569
Little chickenshit...

96
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:18,049
Honest! The place we got it stashed
doesn't open till Monday.

97
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,824
I can't get it till then.
Monday morning. That's when it opens.

98
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,793
After that, I'll get the money right to you.

99
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,799
I always liked you, Luther.

100
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:33,178
You were always a lot of fun
to hang out with.

101
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:35,297
We're gonna keep her.

102
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:37,049
Come on. You can trust me.

103
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:39,142
And if you mess with us,

104
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,512
I'll put holes in her
you never even thought of.

105
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,931
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

106
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,849
Ganz, please.

107
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:47,442
Don't fuck up.

108
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:48,648
Ganz!

109
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,237
- Luther!
- Rosie!

110
00:11:17,181 --> 00:11:19,174
Hey, Algren, need any backup?

111
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:21,510
No, Jack, please.
You make me nervous.

112
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,719
You know that.

113
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:25,097
Your wife makes you nervous, not me.

114
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,182
The radio said
you guys had something on.

115
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:28,274
Not much, Jack.

116
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:30,936
A salesman named Polson
had his credit cards lifted.

117
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,605
One of Polson's cards
rented that green coupe over there.

118
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:36,366
Not much for a big guy like you, Cates.

119
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,443
Oh, it's just a laugher, huh, Van?

120
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,112
It's five-and-dime, Jack.

121
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:42,020
Polson said a kid
with a switchblade mugged him

122
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,699
and took off on a motorcycle.

123
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:46,451
Well, you guys are experts
at taking knives away from teenagers.

124
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:49,254
Yeah, we are, so keep out of it.
We don't need any big artillery.

125
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,550
Well, I'm just trying to help out, Van.
I love to watch pros work.

126
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,460
I don't need your help, Cates.

127
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,963
Hey, Jack, you want to come in,
that's fine.

128
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,590
You stake out the lobby.
How's the car running?

129
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,426
Great. How's the wife?

130
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,102
Mean as a snake.

131
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:06,896
Nice paint job.

132
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:20,902
- Hello. We're looking...
- You guys were in last week.

133
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:23,033
You better ask around.
I'm not supposed to be hassled.

134
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,197
I got friends.

135
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,004
Park your tongue for a second,
sweet pants.

136
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,245
We just want to search a room.

137
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:29,268
- Not unless you got a warrant, babyface.
- Actually...

138
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:30,597
Hey, maybe you should've been
a lawyer

139
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:33,332
instead of a dumb skirt working behind
a cash register, huh?

140
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:34,875
Come on, what the shit is this?

141
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:36,569
- Jack, don't do that.
- Don't worry about that, now.

142
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,211
We're looking for a man
by the name of Polson.

143
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:39,546
"Polson. Room 27."

144
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:41,548
Okay, big deal. Get it over with.

145
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:42,883
Is he alone?

146
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,469
A couple girls went up to visit him
about an hour ago.

147
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,561
Thank you.

148
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:47,804
You guys be careful.

149
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,890
Yeah, and like we said,
you stake out the lobby.

150
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,649
All right, Vinnie.

151
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:55,528
- I'll let you handle it, Al.
- Thank you.

152
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:34,267
Hey, this isn't exactly
my goddamn life's ambition, you know.

153
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,977
It's like a part-time thing.

154
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:38,253
I'm trying to get the money together
to send for my kid.

155
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:40,657
He's been staying with his granny.

156
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:43,910
You don't want to hear
that personal crap anyway.

157
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,037
Are you listening to me?

158
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:52,331
Hey.

159
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,838
Did you hear a goddamn word I said?

160
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,011
So...

161
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:04,764
How much money you got left?

162
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:21,072
Hi, Liz. How you doing? It's me.

163
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,699
What's going on?

164
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,611
Nothing. Just a couple of cops.
What else is new?

165
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,371
How was your date?

166
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:30,198
You're kidding.

167
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:33,084
Liz, you gotta stop sitting still
for that kind of shit.

168
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,087
Yeah. Put him in his place.

169
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:01,905
You're gonna ask who it is. All right?

170
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:07,368
Ask.

171
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,496
- Who is it?
- Police. Open up.

172
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:11,323
What do you want?

173
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:13,416
Police business. Open up right now!

174
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,168
Keep on stalling.

175
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,537
Hang on a second.
I gotta put something on.

176
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:18,880
Hold on.

177
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,771
You listen.
When I tell you to jump, you jump.

178
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:46,449
Call for help now!

179
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,879
Operator!

180
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,677
Jack. There are two of them, Jack!

181
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:00,546
Stay here. Stay down.
Check out the lobby.

182
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,526
It's an emergency!
They're fighting upstairs!

183
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:05,954
Operator, did you get through
to the police?

184
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,031
Put down that goddamn phone, lady.

185
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,774
You drop the phone!

186
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:12,110
- Drop that phone!
- Don't hurt me, please!

187
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,536
Oh, my God!

188
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,127
Please, let me go!

189
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:24,005
Please, let me go.

190
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,083
Billy, bring her out.

191
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:28,968
He ain't gonna shoot.

192
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:33,882
Come on!

193
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:35,183
No! No!

194
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,155
Shut up!

195
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:52,575
No!

196
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:54,869
Oh, my God!

197
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:08,424
No!

198
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:17,892
You! Toss me that goddamn piece,
and he won't waste him.

199
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,437
Don't do it, Jack.
Don't give him the gun.

200
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:24,941
God damn it, Jack! Don't you do it!

201
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:32,281
Don't do that for me.

202
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:56,472
Get the car.

203
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:33,092
Nice gun.

204
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:08,077
- What happened?
- Just read the fucking report!

205
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:10,705
Two cops get blown away
by a credit card booster?

206
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:12,665
- That don't figure.
- No shit.

207
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:14,250
Yeah, and those guys were good cops.

208
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,419
Hell, yes.
They were good cops who fucked up.

209
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,816
They just got careless, that's all.

210
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,110
Yeah, that's what you say, Cates.

211
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,217
- Yeah, that's what I say!
- That's what you always say.

212
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,513
The way you tell it,
we're always the ones that fuck up.

213
00:20:24,613 --> 00:20:25,929
The truth hurts, don't it, buddy?

214
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,123
- Yeah, but, Jack, it don't figure.
- It don't figure.

215
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:30,767
- Can I borrow a piece?
- Yeah, okay, I'll see what I can do.

216
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:33,410
When somebody steals your gun,
you're supposed to file a report.

217
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,938
Just don't give me a bunch of crap.

218
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,399
Well, I guess when two cops die
because you fucked up...

219
00:20:38,499 --> 00:20:40,860
Jesus! Cool down! Knock it off!
Knock it off!

220
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,871
It's not gonna bring them back!
You know better!

221
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,449
Look, Cates,
I want to see you right away.

222
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,284
We got a lot to talk about!

223
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,286
God damn it, do you read me, Cates?

224
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,288
Yeah, I hear you. Your voice carries.

225
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:53,840
Five minutes.

226
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,629
- Ruth!
- They're still wet.

227
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,881
A lot of people getting shot
with.44s lately.

228
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:04,217
Last year,
it was Saturday night specials.

229
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,844
Now it's the heavy stuff.

230
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:07,732
People must be getting madder
about something.

231
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,056
You're an accessory to Murder One,

232
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:10,777
so you're gonna have to do
a whole lot better

233
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:13,242
- than what you've got down here, honey.
- Give me a break, huh?

234
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:14,519
- Cates!
- Yeah!

235
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,384
Got a print from the hotel room, the
guy's real name is Ganz, Albert Ganz.

236
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,066
He headed from back east, but he
worked out here a few years back.

237
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,192
Armed robbery.

238
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:25,029
Broke out of prison a couple of days ago
and capped a couple of the guards.

239
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:27,031
A real animal. Wait till you see this.

240
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:28,749
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,369
Did he give you a return match?

242
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:32,537
He wasn't interested.

243
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:34,261
Maybe he didn't
like the merchandise, huh?

244
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,374
- Fuck you.
- I'll take a rain check on that, huh?

245
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:38,484
- This'll interest you, Jack.
- Yeah, what do you got?

246
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:39,711
We got something from your gun,

247
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,392
and this is from the first weapon
Ganz used.

248
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,486
Wait a minute. I don't get this.

249
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:45,425
Here. It's a perfect match from
the markings from the first gun he used.

250
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:48,386
But it's not from the Walden hotel.
Fired six hours earlier,

251
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:50,221
point blank range,
right between the eyes.

252
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,890
Found him on a park bench.

253
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,767
You know, there are some
very bad people out there in the world.

254
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,083
Yeah, look at it this way, Ruth.

255
00:21:56,183 --> 00:21:58,521
If there weren't,
what the hell would we have to do, huh?

256
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:01,149
So anyway, I got there.
He took me down.

257
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,525
He started watching television,

258
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,403
and then you sensational people
started banging on the door.

259
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:06,738
That's it.

260
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:09,198
Except that I think he's gonna
give you guys a hard time.

261
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:10,909
What makes you think so?

262
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:13,703
I just think he likes shooting cops
a lot more than getting laid.

263
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:15,622
- Jack, check it out.
- What do you got?

264
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:17,592
The stuff from his hotel.
Every last bit of it.

265
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:20,843
- The big guy's room was empty.
- All right, let's go through it.

266
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:27,759
A speedloader.
This guy's got a.44 like yours, Jack.

267
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:28,927
Jesus.

268
00:22:29,027 --> 00:22:31,095
This cat is serious about his artillery.

269
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,397
- Here's the files.
- Oh, thanks.

270
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:35,433
Billy Bear, huh?

271
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:36,913
Yeah, big Indian from the East Bay.

272
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,353
Worked with Ganz a few years back,

273
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:39,852
and he sprung him from the road gang.

274
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:41,940
- Who's this guy?
- Wong. Henry Wong.

275
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,274
He was in on the same job.

276
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:45,673
Kehoe, come here. Come here.
I want to show you something.

277
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:48,955
Come here. Look at this. Look at this.

278
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,541
Now, tell me. The same guy.

279
00:22:53,043 --> 00:22:54,369
Hey, Dick fucking Tracy.

280
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:56,562
All right, I'm gonna want to talk to
one of these guys.

281
00:22:56,662 --> 00:22:59,274
- Any of them walking around?
- One of the gang's still in the slam.

282
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,758
Good. Good.

283
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,220
- Get in here, Cates!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

284
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,059
Speedloader. Kehoe!

285
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,932
I want to be left alone on this one.
Al was killed with my gun.

286
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:19,686
Jack, there's an official
department policy about cop killings.

287
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:22,021
Now, cop killers represent
a special priority,

288
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,524
because any man crazy enough
to kill a cop

289
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,442
is a greater threat
to an unarmed civilian.

290
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:27,652
- Right.
- In other words,

291
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:30,029
we can't seem like
we're in the revenge business.

292
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:31,999
And we all know
the truth's a little different.

293
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,090
Yeah?

294
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,160
Anything's bothering you
besides losing your gun?

295
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,162
Yeah, it bothers me
when cops get killed.

296
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:39,747
I don't like that.

297
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:41,874
Then you might be
a little more of a team player

298
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:43,793
and a little less of a hot dog on this one.

299
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:46,713
Hot dogging's been
working real well so far.

300
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,047
Besides, I got a lead.

301
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:50,599
Okay. You got to do things
your own way?

302
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:51,767
Fine.

303
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:54,345
Now, you nail this guy
and make us all look good,

304
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:55,805
but you better watch your ass,

305
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,890
because everybody's watching
on this one.

306
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,444
If you screw up, I can promise you,
you're going down.

307
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:06,115
Boy, you know how to send a guy out
with a real great attitude, boss.

308
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:38,647
Those days are over

309
00:24:38,815 --> 00:24:42,610
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

310
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,653
I'm here to see Reggie Hammond.

311
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:47,899
- He's in 18. You want company?
- No, thank you.

312
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,618
You don't have to put on the red light

313
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:52,445
Those days are over

314
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:56,499
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

315
00:24:57,042 --> 00:24:58,417
Roxanne

316
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,672
You don't have to put on the red light

317
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,718
Walk the streets for money

318
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:12,139
You don't even care
if it's wrong or if it's right

319
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:13,832
Roxanne

320
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,471
You don't have to work for money...

321
00:25:18,571 --> 00:25:19,722
Is that Hammond?

322
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:22,642
You don't have to sell your body
to the night

323
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:23,734
Hammond!

324
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:25,645
Put on the red light

325
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:28,447
Roxanne, put on the red light

326
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,491
Roxanne, put on the...

327
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:31,867
Hammond!

328
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:38,449
- You got a name, cop?
- Let's try Cates.

329
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:41,794
Come on, I want to talk to you in private.

330
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:44,747
Look, Hammond, I know all about you.

331
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:47,208
You're single,
you got no fixed address, no relatives.

332
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:48,960
One previous conviction,
armed robbery.

333
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,559
Six months to go on
a three-year sentence.

334
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,588
- Is that right?
- So what, man?

335
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:55,099
- You gonna write my life story?
- Not likely, Reggie.

336
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:58,435
Maybe I just need a little help, huh?

337
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:02,735
That's Henry Wong,
an old friend of mine.

338
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:04,517
- He's looked better.
- That's right.

339
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:05,726
Yeah, well, look, man,

340
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:08,023
I've been in this goddamn cell
for two and a half years

341
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,825
and I'm getting out
in six months, all right?

342
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:11,550
I ain't gonna do nothing
to fuck myself up.

343
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,068
But if you came here
to find out something from me,

344
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,303
you come to the wrong person,

345
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:17,405
'cause I don't fuck
my old friends over, man.

346
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:18,990
That's too bad, Reggie.

347
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,458
I thought maybe you were a smart boy.

348
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:25,421
But I guess if you were real smart,
you wouldn't be a convict.

349
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:28,632
Yeah, I guess a second-rater like you
would be no help

350
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:31,335
- with a hard case like Ganz.
- Ganz?

351
00:26:31,435 --> 00:26:33,296
- Right.
- Man, Ganz is in jail.

352
00:26:33,396 --> 00:26:35,184
He's gonna be there
two years after I get out.

353
00:26:35,284 --> 00:26:37,631
Didn't work out that way, Reggie.
A big Indian busted him out.

354
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:39,677
They capped two guards
on a road gang.

355
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,270
See you later.

356
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:44,273
- Yo, Cates.
- Yeah?

357
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:47,852
I can help you get Ganz,
but you gotta get me out of here first.

358
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:49,228
You're crazy.

359
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:51,912
I'm serious. I can help you get him,
but I gotta be on the street.

360
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:53,900
What's the big deal being on the street?

361
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,910
Let's just say I got a lot to protect,
all right?

362
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,445
I want Ganz as bad as you.

363
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:59,955
- Neither one of us ain't got no time.
- Bullshit!

364
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:02,033
No, that's serious shit!

365
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,084
You want Ganz, get me out of here.

366
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,713
I'll think about it, Reggie.

367
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:09,632
Cates.

368
00:27:10,592 --> 00:27:13,344
Cates!
You gotta get me out of here, man!

369
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:15,971
Get me out of here, Cates!

370
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:18,224
Cates!

371
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:22,186
Fuck you!

372
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,156
Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

373
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,826
- You gonna use your own name?
- Shit, no.

374
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:45,368
Jack, if all this comes down,
you don't know me.

375
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:48,120
I'm not gonna burn for you.
And I'll tell you something else.

376
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,423
If it all comes down,
your ass is new-mown grass.

377
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,043
All right. You got him for 48 hours.

378
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:55,511
Sure thing.

379
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:59,006
You know, you got a big career
as a forger if you decide to go that way.

380
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:00,383
Thank you, Bob.

381
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,184
I'll ring security.

382
00:28:12,612 --> 00:28:14,780
Wouldn't talk down to you

383
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,365
Hammond.

384
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:18,776
Okay, send him through.

385
00:28:18,876 --> 00:28:21,654
- You gotta sign for him.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

386
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:23,872
- He's all yours.
- All right.

387
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,792
See how you needed me a little more
than you thought, huh, Mr. Cates?

388
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:28,590
I decided you're
as good a chance as I got.

389
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,788
That shows you how desperate I am.

390
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:32,957
This prison give out $400 suits?

391
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:35,418
$957, and I wore this shit in.

392
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:37,628
We're after a killer,
not a bunch of hookers.

393
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:38,924
Yeah, well, I got a reputation

394
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,645
for looking real nice
with the ladies, man.

395
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,259
Maybe when we get out,
I can take you to a couple of spots,

396
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,820
we can get you dressed up,
and we can go on a little pussy hunt.

397
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,063
I don't want to hear your jive.

398
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:50,349
Already got that department
taken care of.

399
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:52,268
- You got a lady, Cates?
- Yeah.

400
00:28:52,368 --> 00:28:54,686
You know, the generosity of women
never ceases to amaze me.

401
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:55,813
You know that?

402
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:59,608
Hey, don't even try this shit, man.
I don't work like this. No deal.

403
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:02,661
Listen, we ain't got no deal.
I own your ass!

404
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:05,489
Ain't no goddamn way
to start a partnership.

405
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:06,824
Now, get this.

406
00:29:06,924 --> 00:29:09,452
We ain't partners, we ain't brothers,
and we ain't friends!

407
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:11,177
I'm putting you down
and keeping you down

408
00:29:11,277 --> 00:29:12,997
until Ganz is locked up or dead.

409
00:29:13,097 --> 00:29:16,925
And if Ganz gets away,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me!

410
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:20,596
I'm already sorry.

411
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:32,850
- This your car, man?
- Yeah.

412
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,977
Look like you bought it off
one of the brothers.

413
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:37,772
All right, I did my part and I got you out,
so now you do yours.

414
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:38,864
Where we going?

415
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:40,274
We gotta go see a guy named Luther.

416
00:29:40,374 --> 00:29:41,546
Ganz will be going to see him soon.

417
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,817
We ain't got that much time, though.

418
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:45,488
- Is Luther part of the gang?
- What gang you talking about, Jack?

419
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,365
Hey, I can read a police file, shithead.

420
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:48,824
Quit calling me Jack.

421
00:29:48,924 --> 00:29:51,386
It's just an expression, all right?
I don't mean nothing by it.

422
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:53,496
I don't give a damn.
It happens to be my name.

423
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:54,893
What the hell you complaining for?

424
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:58,550
- At least nobody calling you shithead.
- I may call you worse than that.

425
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,911
Right up there, man,
and don't knock on the door.

426
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,450
He ain't expecting no company.

427
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,244
Luther ain't very stable, man.

428
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:36,092
And I don't want you getting shot
before you get a chance to help me.

429
00:30:36,192 --> 00:30:38,173
Oh, I'm helping you, huh?

430
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,968
Slow down. Right there, 232.

431
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,756
What's the chances he's packed?

432
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,214
Been a while since I worked with him.

433
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:49,093
I'd say chances are
probably about 100%.

434
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:50,857
You better leave me a gun
or something, man.

435
00:30:50,957 --> 00:30:53,647
I ain't sitting out here without no gun.

436
00:30:54,274 --> 00:30:56,066
Sure thing, asshole.

437
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,277
Now, you just hang on.

438
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,991
Hope this big move of yours
turns out to be something.

439
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:57,411
What's happening, Luther?

440
00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:59,371
I'm sorry about the door, man.
Did that hurt?

441
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:02,591
It looked real painful
when you slammed into it.

442
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:07,304
Luther, I'm talking to you.
Luther. Luther!

443
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:10,265
Hammond! Drop that goddamn gun!

444
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:12,781
Hey, man, that's a dangerous game
you're playing, man.

445
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:14,317
Don't point that gun at me, all right?

446
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:16,555
Don't point your goddamn gun at me,
all right?

447
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:18,941
Hand me that gun or you're dead.

448
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:40,329
I'm looking for Ganz. Where is he?

449
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:42,756
Ganz? Haven't seen him for years.

450
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:44,416
That's the truth.

451
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:46,335
Look, asshole,
you just took a shot at me.

452
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:48,637
I think you do know where Ganz is.

453
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,306
Who gives a fuck what you think?

454
00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:59,390
Yo, Luther, man,
you better tell this boy something.

455
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,067
He's having a ball with this car door.

456
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:08,323
Luther! Are you angry with me?

457
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:11,569
I don't know what
you're smiling at, watermelon.

458
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:14,280
Your big move just turned out to be shit.

459
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,407
All right, all right, all right!

460
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:19,410
Yeah, if I defend myself,
I'm resisting arrest, right?

461
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,787
Officer, I want to make
a citizen's arrest!

462
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:23,080
Shut up!

463
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,582
What you got here, Jack?

464
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:27,084
I got a punk here
carrying a concealed weapon...

465
00:33:27,184 --> 00:33:28,586
All you cops are faggots!

466
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:30,345
Resisting arrest.

467
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:32,931
I'll think up some more,
file a report tomorrow.

468
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,759
- I bet you will.
- Yeah, I will. Get him out of here.

469
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:37,886
Man, give me a 9:00 wake-up call.

470
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:39,054
Good-bye, Luther!

471
00:33:39,154 --> 00:33:41,098
I don't need a friend like you, Reggie!

472
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:44,143
When do I get my phone call?
Let me get my lawyer here!

473
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,270
You're gonna be in trouble!

474
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,946
Stay right here.

475
00:33:48,364 --> 00:33:51,700
- Okay?
- Get your hands off me!

476
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,873
I'm not gonna take this from you.
That's no way to treat a lady.

477
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,502
No, you're not.

478
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:07,174
Excuse me, ladies,

479
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,293
you seem to be
in some need of assistance.

480
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:10,461
We've got enough problems.

481
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:11,798
We don't need some tight-assed,

482
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:14,298
court-appointed lawyer
trying to bullshit us.

483
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:16,300
Sweetheart, I'm not here to bullshit you.

484
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,064
I don't know whether or not
you ladies know,

485
00:34:18,164 --> 00:34:19,364
but the city's coming down on people

486
00:34:19,464 --> 00:34:21,605
involved with
unlawful carnal knowledge.

487
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:24,775
Hello?

488
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:27,778
This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

489
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,606
Oh, just one.

490
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:33,025
Some lady called, says
she's a little hotheaded sometimes,

491
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,577
but she still wants
her occasional roommate.

492
00:34:35,745 --> 00:34:38,781
She says she'd like to talk it over
tonight after she gets off work,

493
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:40,082
if it's humanly possible.

494
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:41,792
Look, Elaine, I...

495
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:44,453
I've got some stuff to do tonight.

496
00:34:44,553 --> 00:34:46,933
I'm not going to be able to come by.
I don't know when I can.

497
00:34:47,033 --> 00:34:47,998
Come on, Jack.

498
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:50,167
You're making me work
too goddamn hard at this!

499
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,335
Listen, god damn it.

500
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:53,470
If you think I'm happy about it,
you're nuts!

501
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:55,184
I just got a few things to take care of.

502
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:57,284
This is not the way
people who care about each other

503
00:34:57,384 --> 00:34:59,226
are supposed to behave!

504
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:03,939
Shit!

505
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:06,558
I'm trying to say
you're both going to do a little time,

506
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:08,443
about 30 days each.

507
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:11,397
Unless, of course,
we talk some real business.

508
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:14,358
So where do you want to do it, honey?
Want to hop up on the counter?

509
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,756
No. We can go in this room over here,
next to the bathroom.

510
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,088
- Give me a break.
- I'm dead serious.

511
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:19,319
Come on, we're on the move. Let's go!

512
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:21,531
Man, you know how close I was
to getting some trim just now,

513
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:22,457
and you fucked it up?

514
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:23,951
Hey, well, my ass bleeds for you.

515
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:26,328
I didn't get you out
so you could go on a trim hunt.

516
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,705
Stop moaning.

517
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:30,162
You know, speaking of moaning,
my stomach is starting to growl.

518
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,267
- We better go get something to eat.
- We eat when I say we eat.

519
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:34,545
Hey, now, that's bullshit.
That's the last straw, all right?

520
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:35,796
I want some food now.

521
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:38,132
If you don't like it,
you take me back to the penitentiary

522
00:35:38,232 --> 00:35:39,996
and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye,
all right?

523
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,051
You took me out here,

524
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:43,203
you've been treating me like shit
since we first left,

525
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,656
and I want some food in a nice place,

526
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,724
in a nice atmosphere,
with some good people.

527
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:48,692
Okay, hold it. I'm hungry.

528
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:51,895
Let's go get something to eat.
I know a place, all right?

529
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:53,354
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

530
00:35:53,454 --> 00:35:56,032
I want some mandolins
and some violins.

531
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,326
Yeah!

532
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:01,955
There's your goddamn dinner.

533
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,498
Come on.

534
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,419
Who was that you called
back on the phone, Jack?

535
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,716
None of your goddamn business.

536
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,294
Just get in the car
and keep your mouth shut.

537
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:16,854
Come on, man, I think it was your lady.

538
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:18,332
Why don't you tell me
something about her?

539
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:19,798
What's her problem, besides you?

540
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:23,343
She got the same problem
as half the goddamn population.

541
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:25,971
Can't get a job she's trained for,
and it pisses her off.

542
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:28,891
She's bitching all the time.
What the fuck do you care?

543
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:30,601
Hey, man, I'm in jail, remember that?

544
00:36:30,701 --> 00:36:33,103
I'm surrounded by guys
wearing blue suits 24 hours a day.

545
00:36:33,203 --> 00:36:34,318
I ain't built for that shit.

546
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:37,991
Yeah? The clothes you wear,
you look like you'd love it.

547
00:36:39,368 --> 00:36:41,570
All right, where to, convict?

548
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,164
Mission District, catch us an Indian.

549
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,289
Yo, man,
tell me about this girlfriend of yours.

550
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:08,676
When was the last time
you got with her?

551
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:10,182
I don't give out details.

552
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:12,351
Come on, man.
I've been in prison for three years.

553
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:13,891
I'm tired of hearing lies about pussy.

554
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:15,553
Man, when was it, last week,
the week before?

555
00:37:15,653 --> 00:37:16,605
Last night.

556
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:17,815
- Really?
- Yeah.

557
00:37:17,915 --> 00:37:19,574
- Was it fun?
- Yeah.

558
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:24,412
Christ. Then in the morning,
we got in a fucking argument.

559
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:27,282
At least you took care of business first,
right, Jack?

560
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:28,408
Right.

561
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:31,545
Yo, man, does she have,
like, big, giant titties?

562
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:35,507
I can see this is gonna be a long
fucking night, convict.

563
00:37:46,727 --> 00:37:48,512
Okay, what's the deal?

564
00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:49,604
It's a long shot,

565
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,972
but Billy used to work at
this club over here as a bartender.

566
00:37:52,072 --> 00:37:54,017
I heard him talk about it before.

567
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:55,185
This neighborhood,

568
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:56,971
they're gonna make me for a cop
right away.

569
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:59,917
All right, you just back me up.
Pretend like you got a piece, all right?

570
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,336
What the fuck I want to do that for?

571
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:02,548
They may beat the shit out of me,

572
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,945
but I guarantee you,
they'll cut your black ass right up.

573
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:06,705
Oh, so you a bad-ass?

574
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:10,125
You know, it's amazing how far
a gun and a badge will take some guys.

575
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:12,953
Bullshit! Attitude and experience
is what gets you through.

576
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:14,296
Come on.

577
00:38:18,175 --> 00:38:20,518
I'm telling you, man,
I've been in places like this before.

578
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:22,468
When white cops came to fuck with me
and my friends,

579
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:24,243
only thing that stopped us
from kicking their ass,

580
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,223
they had guns and badges.

581
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:27,926
Takes years of experience
to handle a joint like this.

582
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:29,644
You want to bet?

583
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:30,929
I got two problems.

584
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:32,695
Number one,
I ain't playing fucking games.

585
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,983
Number two,
you ain't got nothing to bet with.

586
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:37,151
Look, if we go in there
and get a phone number

587
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:39,404
or Ganz or a dead Indian,
anything that helps us out,

588
00:38:39,572 --> 00:38:41,894
turn your back for a half-hour
and let me go get some pussy.

589
00:38:41,994 --> 00:38:42,907
What for?

590
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:46,236
Any man talks about women like you
can't get it up anyhow.

591
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:47,738
I been in prison for three years.

592
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,332
My dick gets hard if the wind blows.

593
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,792
All right. You got a bet.

594
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:56,421
But when you lose, you tell me the truth.

595
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,498
What the fuck you talking about?

596
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:00,918
Ganz didn't get out for nothing.
What's he after?

597
00:39:01,018 --> 00:39:02,703
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

598
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:05,680
- I want to nail Ganz, just like you.
- Fuck you! Bet's off.

599
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,350
All right, Cates, look.

600
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,897
If I lose, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

601
00:39:16,192 --> 00:39:18,810
All right, you got a deal.
Hell, I'm gonna enjoy this.

602
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,695
I'm gonna even give you my badge.

603
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,815
You said bullshit and experience
is all it takes, right?

604
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:24,942
Right.

605
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:28,070
Come on in and experience
some of my bullshit.

606
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,705
All right. Let's see it.

607
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,197
Not a very popular place
with the brothers.

608
00:40:12,297 --> 00:40:15,583
It's my kind of place.
I always liked country boys.

609
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:19,087
They're sure as hell gonna like you.

610
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:37,439
Howdy.

611
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,752
- How do.
- Yeah?

612
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:02,672
I'd like something to drink,
preferably some vodka.

613
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:05,800
Maybe you'd best have a Black Russian.

614
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:12,340
Black Russian! You hear what he said?
Black Russian.

615
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,217
That's a funny joke. I get it.

616
00:41:14,317 --> 00:41:16,386
I'm black. Now, that's funny!

617
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:18,346
No. I'd just rather have plain old vodka.

618
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:19,806
That'd be nice.

619
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,706
You know,
long as we're standing here talking

620
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,936
and we're all friendly,
I'm looking for a good old boy

621
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:26,313
by the name of Billy Bear.

622
00:41:26,413 --> 00:41:28,815
I was wondering if you might be able
to help me find him.

623
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:30,150
Never heard of him.

624
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,912
Never heard of him before.
Never heard of Billy Bear, huh?

625
00:41:36,415 --> 00:41:37,791
Looky here!

626
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,580
You fucking heard of him now, man?

627
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,587
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

628
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:48,594
Well, maybe you wouldn't mind if
I looked around for a little while then.

629
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:51,846
- I don't give a shit what you do!
- Good.

630
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:08,655
Never seen so many backwards-ass
country fucks in my life.

631
00:42:09,115 --> 00:42:13,034
It makes me sick just to be in here.
You boys look like regulars.

632
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,812
I'm looking for a guy named Billy Bear.

633
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:15,927
You know where I could find him?

634
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:19,032
This is our place. I don't give a shit
what the fuck your badge says, nigger.

635
00:42:19,132 --> 00:42:22,127
You're a big, tough country faggot,
ain't you?

636
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,049
You out of your fucking mind, man?
Get up against that fucking pole!

637
00:42:28,551 --> 00:42:30,627
Think I'm playing
a goddamn game, man?

638
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:32,971
You out of your fucking mind?

639
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,550
I'm gonna say it one more time, okay?

640
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,801
This is a police matter,

641
00:42:37,901 --> 00:42:40,470
and I'm looking for
an Indian named Billy Bear.

642
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,857
I know everybody in here
wants to cooperate with me.

643
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,313
Hey, that's not even necessary,
all right, man?

644
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,574
I got this situation in hand.

645
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:57,787
Some of us citizens are
behind you all the way, officer.

646
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:02,659
- What's your fucking problem?
- I'm on parole.

647
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:04,828
- That's why you're running away?
- Yeah.

648
00:43:04,928 --> 00:43:07,088
Sit your country ass down, man.

649
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:11,926
All right, listen up!

650
00:43:12,928 --> 00:43:16,097
I don't like white people!
I hate rednecks!

651
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,977
You people are rednecks.
That means I'm enjoying this shit.

652
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:26,850
You loaded here.
Where the fuck did you get this?

653
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,186
- Tax refund.
- That's bullshit.

654
00:43:29,286 --> 00:43:31,988
You're too fucking stupid to have a job.

655
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:37,152
You don't like that?
You don't like that shit?

656
00:43:37,252 --> 00:43:38,494
You hate that shit, right?

657
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:42,490
- What the hell kind of cop are you?
- You know what I am?

658
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,036
I'm your worst fucking nightmare, man.
I'm a nigger with a badge.

659
00:43:46,136 --> 00:43:49,589
That mean I got permission to kick
your fucking ass whenever I feel like it.

660
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,379
All right, listen up, man.

661
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:59,382
One of them's underage,
another one attacked a police officer,

662
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:01,559
and I still ain't found
what I'm looking for yet.

663
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:05,305
Well, look, I think you're on your way
to being out of business, all right?

664
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:06,648
Let's see

665
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:08,600
what we can fuck with next.

666
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:12,070
Hey, man! All right! Okay! Now, listen.

667
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:14,875
The Indian hangs out with a chick
who lives up the block.

668
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,457
Just head up the alley, across
the street, where Chinatown starts,

669
00:44:17,557 --> 00:44:18,940
she lives on top of the jewelry store.

670
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,647
I didn't ask you shit about his girl, man.

671
00:44:20,747 --> 00:44:22,239
Come on, give me a break, will you?

672
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:24,902
You're gonna have to settle for
her place 'cause it's all I know.

673
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:27,794
I'm telling you. I'm giving you all I know!

674
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:32,507
Well, look, hoss.

675
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,343
You start running
a respectable business,

676
00:44:35,678 --> 00:44:38,129
and I won't have to come in here
and hassle you every night.

677
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:39,847
Know what I mean?

678
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:46,388
And I want the rest of you cowboys
to know something.

679
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:48,690
There's a new sheriff in town.

680
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,363
And his name is Reggie Hammond.

681
00:44:56,031 --> 00:44:58,032
Y'all be cool. Right on!

682
00:45:19,722 --> 00:45:22,557
- Let's go, man.
- I think you got something for me.

683
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:24,976
What you talking about?

684
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:29,689
Why don't you give me
that gun you took off the redneck?

685
00:45:31,734 --> 00:45:33,735
- Oh, you saw that!
- Yeah.

686
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,446
Here you go.

687
00:45:37,406 --> 00:45:40,742
While you're at it,
why don't you give me the switchblade?

688
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,745
You saw that, too, huh?
You don't miss nothing, Jack.

689
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:47,198
It was real smooth
how I took it from him, right?

690
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:49,701
Listen, man,
you owe me a piece of ass, right?

691
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:52,754
Why don't you just give me that gun?
We'll call it even.

692
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:55,423
You did a good job, Reggie.

693
00:45:56,091 --> 00:45:59,385
I guess you deserve a reward. Here.

694
00:46:06,101 --> 00:46:07,685
Fucking bastard.

695
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:10,271
That I am.

696
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:16,194
Let's go get us an Indian down the alley.

697
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:32,960
I don't think nobody's home, man.

698
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:36,422
Let's check around back.

699
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:40,468
Shit!

700
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,466
I hope we have as much fun as we had
in that hillbilly bar back there, man.

701
00:46:46,566 --> 00:46:49,102
Don't bust your arm
patting yourself on the back, convict.

702
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:52,514
You see the way I handled those boys?
I tell you. I'm on a roll.

703
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:54,949
If we see Billy in here,
you let me take care of him, all right?

704
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,644
Why don't you get a megaphone
and announce we're coming?

705
00:46:57,744 --> 00:47:01,030
You make more goddamn noise
than a busted chain saw.

706
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:08,663
What the hell they watching?

707
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,125
I don't know.

708
00:47:13,001 --> 00:47:15,461
- Yeah, well, TV has changed.
- Yeah.

709
00:47:17,172 --> 00:47:18,631
Look at this!

710
00:47:20,008 --> 00:47:23,511
- There. That must be Billy's girlfriend.
- Yeah. Come on.

711
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:30,518
- Police! Nobody move!
- Stay where you are!

712
00:47:32,855 --> 00:47:35,765
Okay, you'd just better drop it,
or he's gonna get another one.

713
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:37,856
Man, listen to her.
The girl thinks she's Babe Ruth.

714
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,603
I said police!
Now put the goddamn gun down!

715
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:43,656
Don't give me that police shit.
You drop it.

716
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:47,034
Okay, look. Don't shoot.

717
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,037
I'm just gonna reach for my badge.

718
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:58,621
I don't like this bullshit.
I've seen fake badges before.

719
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:00,895
Hey, sweetheart,
this guy got a real itchy trigger finger,

720
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:01,916
and he's a nervous cop.

721
00:48:02,016 --> 00:48:04,145
You better listen to him,
or you'll get your brains blown out!

722
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:06,846
Shut up! I'm the calm type.

723
00:48:07,556 --> 00:48:09,799
Now, I know you don't want me
to shoot you,

724
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:11,843
and I know you don't want to shoot me.

725
00:48:11,943 --> 00:48:14,562
So come on, just hand me over the gun.

726
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:22,645
You assholes better be real.

727
00:48:22,745 --> 00:48:25,482
Hey, let's just wait a minute here.
Let's see your badge.

728
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:26,941
I ain't got no goddamn badge.

729
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,890
I ought to hit you in your head
with this thing.

730
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,446
- Hey! Will you call the cops?
- Right.

731
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,706
Put that goddamn phone down!

732
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:37,710
If you don't answer some questions,
I'm gonna haul both your asses in!

733
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:39,003
Shit.

734
00:48:39,755 --> 00:48:41,088
All right.

735
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:45,134
Which one of you sees Billy Bear?

736
00:48:45,302 --> 00:48:48,137
Hey, look,
it's none of your business, cop.

737
00:48:49,097 --> 00:48:51,674
The son of a bitch isn't here,
and he isn't coming back.

738
00:48:51,774 --> 00:48:54,010
You guys can do better than that.
How about you?

739
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,590
I haven't seen him for two weeks,
and I don't think I'm gonna.

740
00:48:56,696 --> 00:48:58,314
He owes me money.

741
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:00,775
Sounds like a real stormy romance.

742
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:02,856
I don't care much
what it sounds like to you, cop.

743
00:49:02,956 --> 00:49:05,492
All I know is that I went a couple of laps
around the track with him,

744
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,263
and I ended up
with the short end of the stick.

745
00:49:07,363 --> 00:49:09,192
- Come on.
- No, wait a minute, man.

746
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:10,944
I've been in prison for three years.

747
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:13,587
You know, if this lady's been getting
the short end of the stick,

748
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:16,699
maybe you'd like to go a couple laps
around the track with us.

749
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,042
Fuck off.

750
00:49:18,293 --> 00:49:19,544
Come on!

751
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:23,957
Say, if you find Billy,
tell him to stay out of my life.

752
00:49:24,057 --> 00:49:26,884
I don't want any more of
his macho bullshit.

753
00:49:27,636 --> 00:49:28,886
Let's go.

754
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:36,477
This sucks.

755
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,596
A maniac gets a hold of my gun

756
00:49:38,696 --> 00:49:41,391
and runs all over the streets
killing people with it.

757
00:49:41,491 --> 00:49:44,394
So instead of being where I ought to be,
home in bed with my gal

758
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:45,728
giving her the high hard one,

759
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:49,148
I'm out here doing this shit,
roaming around the streets

760
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:52,201
with an overdressed,
charcoal-colored loser like you.

761
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:54,629
Look, man, if you don't like it,
why don't you just leave?

762
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:56,573
I can take care of Ganz by myself,
all right?

763
00:49:56,673 --> 00:49:59,834
Yeah, don't make me laugh.
You can't take care of shit.

764
00:50:00,002 --> 00:50:03,496
You've been dicking me around
since we started this turd hunt.

765
00:50:03,596 --> 00:50:05,631
The only thing you're good for is games.

766
00:50:06,174 --> 00:50:08,626
So far, what I got out of you is nothing.

767
00:50:08,726 --> 00:50:10,657
Yeah, well, I'm real impressed
with you, too, man.

768
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:14,507
It took a real skilled cop to kick in the
bedroom door of a couple of dykes.

769
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:17,343
Luther knows more than he told me,
and so do you.

770
00:50:17,443 --> 00:50:19,523
Now, I want to know
what the fuck this is all about.

771
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:21,723
I gave you 48 hours
to come up with something,

772
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,932
and the clock's running.

773
00:50:23,032 --> 00:50:25,264
Yeah, well, maybe I don't like
the way you asked me, all right?

774
00:50:25,364 --> 00:50:27,320
Who gives a goddamn what you like?

775
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:29,939
You're just a crook on a weekend pass.

776
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,700
You're not even
a goddamn name anymore.

777
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:34,110
You're just a spear-chucker

778
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:37,163
with a number stenciled
on the back of his prison fatigues.

779
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,876
All right, I'm through fucking around.

780
00:50:42,502 --> 00:50:43,544
You tell me the truth,

781
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,497
or you're gonna get the living shit
beat out of you.

782
00:50:46,597 --> 00:50:49,925
Oh, you're gonna kick my ass now?
I think you've lost your mind, Cates.

783
00:50:50,052 --> 00:50:51,822
Why don't you put your gun
back in your holster

784
00:50:51,922 --> 00:50:53,171
and get in the car, and let's go?

785
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,756
I'm serious. I'm not in the mood.

786
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:56,765
And I'm just gonna end up
fucking you up out here.

787
00:50:56,865 --> 00:51:00,019
This is gonna be an embarrassment
to you and the police force.

788
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:03,939
Let me explain one thing to you, nigger.
I fight dirty.

789
00:51:45,816 --> 00:51:47,483
You little fucker.

790
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:52,279
You pushed me in the fucking garbage!

791
00:51:53,907 --> 00:51:55,658
Get the fuck off me!

792
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:35,948
All right, you two, what's going on here?

793
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:38,701
- Nothing.
- It's all right. I'm a cop.

794
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:40,995
Yeah, sure.
Get your hands above your head!

795
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:45,074
I'm too fucking tired
to put my hands above my head.

796
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:47,118
My gun and badge
are over there in the car.

797
00:52:47,218 --> 00:52:48,961
Check it out, Bill.

798
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:50,838
Get in the car!

799
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,304
Just what the hell is going on here?

800
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,257
We got a burglary call.

801
00:53:01,357 --> 00:53:04,761
Two women said a couple of hoods
broke into their place posing as cops.

802
00:53:04,861 --> 00:53:07,688
Yeah. I was following a lead.
We rousted them.

803
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,309
Why don't you guys go sweet-talk 'em,
straighten it out?

804
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:14,270
I got a better idea.
Why don't you do it yourself?

805
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:17,156
We've got better things to do
than straighten out your messes.

806
00:53:17,866 --> 00:53:19,992
I'll file a report tomorrow.

807
00:53:20,118 --> 00:53:22,069
Yeah, well, I got to file a report tonight.

808
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:24,538
Yeah? Goes with the territory.

809
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:37,895
It's a good thing your friends came
when they did, Cates.

810
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:41,088
- I was getting ready to get in your ass.
- Yeah? You want to try it again?

811
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:45,259
- You'd just call your buddies back.
- They saved your ass, convict.

812
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,970
That's what you'll tell them
down at the station house tonight.

813
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,313
Yeah. Right.

814
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,899
I'll even put it in my report that way.

815
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:53,901
Yeah. I bet you will.

816
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:00,241
- How much do I owe you?
- 10 bucks.

817
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,745
Motherfucker.

818
00:54:10,043 --> 00:54:11,252
Hammond!

819
00:54:13,296 --> 00:54:17,049
You come clean, or we're going again
right here, right now.

820
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:20,678
I want to know what's going on
between you and Ganz.

821
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,389
Look, man, I've been waiting for
some money for a long time, all right?

822
00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:32,731
How much?

823
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:34,900
Half a million dollars.

824
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:37,611
You starting to get the picture now?

825
00:54:37,946 --> 00:54:40,330
You're on the wrong side
of the law-and-order business, Jack.

826
00:54:40,430 --> 00:54:42,908
Just tell me about the goddamn money.

827
00:54:45,036 --> 00:54:48,289
Me and some my friends hit a dealer
during a sale.

828
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:52,626
It's the kind of money
nobody reports stolen.

829
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:55,705
One of the guys turned around
and dropped dime on me.

830
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:58,328
Happens to be the same guy
that's running around shooting people

831
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,758
with a certain cop's gun.

832
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,044
So he's after your money.

833
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:04,597
You know, you're a real bright cop!
You know that, Jack?

834
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:07,224
So how much you want, man?

835
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:11,604
- You want to split 50-50?
- Not likely, convict.

836
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:14,307
Oh, I can't have nothing now, right?

837
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:15,808
I believe in the merit system.

838
00:55:15,908 --> 00:55:18,193
So far you ain't built up no points, boy.

839
00:55:18,403 --> 00:55:21,063
Oh, well, then, I'll be real good
from now on, Mr. Cates.

840
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:23,490
Just tell me
where the goddamn money is.

841
00:55:27,537 --> 00:55:29,413
In the trunk of my car.

842
00:55:31,249 --> 00:55:32,791
Right, partner.

843
00:55:39,966 --> 00:55:41,626
But get this, man.

844
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:44,337
We ain't brothers, we ain't partners,
and we ain't friends.

845
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:47,388
Now, if Ganz gets away with my money,
you're gonna be sorry you ever met me.

846
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:49,058
I'm already sorry.

847
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:09,662
- All right, where's the goddamn car?
- Be cool, man. The car's parked.

848
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,206
For three years? Bullshit!

849
00:56:12,415 --> 00:56:16,043
Bullshit?
I'll let you in on a little secret, Jack.

850
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:18,003
You just passed it.

851
00:56:33,687 --> 00:56:35,229
Okay, now what?

852
00:56:35,563 --> 00:56:39,733
Now you get to play cop
and watch that building back there.

853
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,728
I'm gonna get in the back seat
and go to sleep.

854
00:56:42,828 --> 00:56:44,230
You son of a bitch!

855
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,890
You knew where the money was
all along.

856
00:56:45,998 --> 00:56:48,234
All we had to do
was come here and wait.

857
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:50,987
Christ, I almost got
my ass shot off twice for nothing!

858
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:53,948
Yeah, well, being a cop
is a hard job, Jack.

859
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:56,784
The building opens up at 7:00.
Wake me up at a quarter to.

860
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:58,494
I'll be back here asleep.

861
00:56:58,594 --> 00:56:59,594
Shit!

862
00:57:02,424 --> 00:57:03,424
Jack,

863
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,877
tell me a story.

864
00:57:06,977 --> 00:57:08,262
Fuck you!

865
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:10,806
Oh, that's one of my favorites.

866
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,476
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:59,354
I didn't want you sleeping on the job.

868
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:01,599
Yo, man,
that place opens in five minutes.

869
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:02,933
You better go look for Ganz.

870
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:05,227
You took a big chance
leaving it here all this time.

871
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:06,395
No, I didn't, man.

872
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:08,099
I knew Ganz was gonna be
away for a while,

873
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:11,525
and I knew Luther wouldn't cross me.
The boy ain't got no heart.

874
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:14,453
Guess what?
Luther just crossed the street.

875
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:19,450
That's a damned shame, man.

876
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,297
The guy took a shot at a cop
yesterday night,

877
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,103
and he's running around
on the street today.

878
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:24,914
The judicial system ain't shit.

879
00:58:25,014 --> 00:58:27,382
Must've had a primo bail bondsman.

880
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:31,136
Hey, buddy, I want to pick up my car.

881
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:34,848
- What's the name?
- Hammond. Reggie Hammond.

882
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:39,394
- This is three years old.
- Yeah. I've been busy!

883
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:44,066
Hey, Al, get a load of this.
Bring down 29-012.

884
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:46,102
It's been here three years.

885
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:47,611
How about charging the battery?

886
00:58:47,946 --> 00:58:51,448
- We take care of that every month.
- Great. Just great.

887
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,083
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

888
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,096
There he is.

889
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:49,882
Goddamn!
Look at all that dust on my car!

890
00:59:50,175 --> 00:59:52,459
Why the fuck don't he take it
to a car wash?

891
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,838
I didn't know you darker people
went in for foreign jobs.

892
00:59:55,938 --> 00:59:57,032
Yeah, well, I had no choice.

893
00:59:57,132 --> 01:00:00,767
Some white asshole bought
the last piece-of-shit sky-blue Cadillac.

894
01:00:35,595 --> 01:00:37,004
Yo, man, I hope to God

895
01:00:37,104 --> 01:00:39,217
none of my fellas see me riding around
in this car, man.

896
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:40,363
You really let this shit go bad.

897
01:00:40,463 --> 01:00:42,801
What you don't understand is,
I don't care how it looks.

898
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:45,930
- It ain't got no class, Jack.
- Class isn't something you buy.

899
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:49,266
Look at you. You got a $500 suit on,
and you're still a low-life.

900
01:00:49,366 --> 01:00:51,235
Yeah, but I look good.

901
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:17,803
That goddamn suit is yours?

902
01:01:17,929 --> 01:01:19,964
Them suits was in style
a couple years back.

903
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:21,056
Yeah, right.

904
01:01:21,156 --> 01:01:25,018
If you ever switch from armed robber
to a pimp, you're all set.

905
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:32,734
- There's the money, Jack.
- Yeah, right.

906
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:36,530
Look out, now!

907
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,201
Hold it! Hold it! Whoa! Whoa!

908
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:43,245
Whoa! Whoa!

909
01:04:12,854 --> 01:04:15,188
Hey, you! Put that down!

910
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:26,032
Luther! Luther!

911
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:37,127
I'm going after the money, Jack.

912
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:05,322
Come on!

913
01:05:06,699 --> 01:05:08,325
Stay close to me.

914
01:06:00,545 --> 01:06:01,745
Freeze!

915
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:02,871
I'm a cop!

916
01:06:02,971 --> 01:06:05,090
Drop it, or you're all done!

917
01:06:45,715 --> 01:06:48,709
Well, look, just meet me at Vroman's
and bring the shit, okay?

918
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:50,135
Thank you.

919
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:25,962
Vodka with a twist!
And I'd like to run up a tab, please.

920
01:07:26,922 --> 01:07:28,340
Yeah, right.

921
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:31,551
Hey, babe.
My name's Reggie Hammond.

922
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:33,303
Well, so what?

923
01:07:37,933 --> 01:07:41,394
- My name's Reggie Hammond.
- I'm with somebody.

924
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:48,693
How you doing?
My name's Reggie Hammond.

925
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:53,239
This ain't my night.

926
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:33,446
- You look awful.
- Yeah, well, so do you.

927
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:35,365
It's been a long day.

928
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:38,243
Long night, too, from what I heard.

929
01:08:38,703 --> 01:08:42,614
Word's going around that in addition
to losing Ganz for the second time,

930
01:08:42,714 --> 01:08:44,783
some soul brother
beat the crap out of you.

931
01:08:44,883 --> 01:08:46,827
Oh, bullshit. You heard the story wrong.

932
01:08:46,927 --> 01:08:49,705
- Doesn't look like it.
- Did anything come in yet? Any calls?

933
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:51,047
Nothing.

934
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:54,634
Kehoe.

935
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:57,011
Ordnance.

936
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:02,050
- Yeah?
- Reports are late, Cates.

937
01:09:02,150 --> 01:09:03,218
- Yeah.
- I need 'em.

938
01:09:03,318 --> 01:09:04,922
- Yeah, I'll be in tomorrow.
- 9:00 sharp.

939
01:09:05,022 --> 01:09:07,981
Yeah, for Christ's sake.
You can depend on it. Jesus!

940
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:11,309
Bullshit.

941
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:13,095
I'm heading out for a while.
How about you?

942
01:09:13,195 --> 01:09:14,813
No, I got to wait for a call.

943
01:09:14,913 --> 01:09:16,190
Okay, I'll see you in the morning.

944
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:17,850
You know,
you really ought to get some rest.

945
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:18,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

946
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,869
Hello? Yeah. He's here.

947
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,580
Cates. For you. Line 3.

948
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,659
Hey, motherfucker,
where the hell are you?

949
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,086
I'm at work, asshole! Where else?

950
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:32,297
Elaine.

951
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:35,792
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.
I thought it was somebody else.

952
01:09:35,892 --> 01:09:37,093
Police business.

953
01:09:37,303 --> 01:09:39,512
Yeah, no wonder you're so popular.

954
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:43,425
Look, I'm sorry about
the way things have been lately.

955
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:45,969
I know I have not been acting real great.

956
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:47,763
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

957
01:09:47,863 --> 01:09:48,863
Jack?

958
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,140
I almost forgot.

959
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,934
That pal of yours from the vice squad
wants you to call him.

960
01:09:53,034 --> 01:09:54,402
Jack, are you still there?

961
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,300
He said he rousted a bar with you
last night.

962
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,383
Well, why in the hell
didn't you tell me that before?

963
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:01,526
Hey, I'm not paid
to take your personal calls.

964
01:10:01,626 --> 01:10:03,528
Well, what's
the goddamn number, Kehoe?

965
01:10:03,628 --> 01:10:05,872
It's on my desk. Find it yourself.

966
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:08,536
Elaine, I got to put you on hold
for just a second.

967
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:12,045
No. No, don't put me on hold!
Jack, don't put me...

968
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:15,173
You son of a bitch.

969
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:20,094
It's under the light.

970
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:36,148
Reggie Hammond.

971
01:10:36,248 --> 01:10:38,480
Hammond, you son of a bitch.
Where the hell are you?

972
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,732
Jack! How have you been?

973
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:45,411
Yeah, I've been waiting for you to call.
Yeah. I'm at Vroman's.

974
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,289
Vroman's in the Fillmore.

975
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:50,742
Yeah, I know
you don't know about this place.

976
01:10:50,842 --> 01:10:52,285
The brothers hang out here.

977
01:10:52,385 --> 01:10:54,185
They probably wouldn't let
your tight ass in.

978
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:57,090
All right, I'll be right there.
Don't move your ass.

979
01:10:59,093 --> 01:11:00,078
- Jack.
- Yeah?

980
01:11:00,178 --> 01:11:02,804
- Elaine's on the other line.
- Oh, Jesus!

981
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:05,974
- Elaine?
- Jack?

982
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:07,433
Fuck you!

983
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:09,435
Shit.

984
01:12:58,003 --> 01:13:01,206
- Hey, listen, my name is Reggie.
- I'm Candy.

985
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:02,415
Yo, look, Candy,

986
01:13:02,515 --> 01:13:05,038
if I don't get some trim before
the night's over, I'm gonna bust.

987
01:13:05,138 --> 01:13:06,041
What?

988
01:13:06,141 --> 01:13:09,381
Some trim, some mugambo, some sex.

989
01:13:09,481 --> 01:13:12,767
Are you crazy?
You can't ask me any better than that?

990
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:16,429
Look, you don't understand. It's 10:05.

991
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:18,932
By 10: 10, I want to be
into some flesh, okay?

992
01:13:19,032 --> 01:13:21,768
Let's just go across the street over here.
Wait a second.

993
01:13:21,868 --> 01:13:24,187
I don't have no money.
Do you have any money on you?

994
01:13:24,287 --> 01:13:27,148
You mean to tell me
that you can't even pay for the room?

995
01:13:27,248 --> 01:13:29,985
- Hammond!
- Hey, Jack, what's happening?

996
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:32,195
I want you to meet my friend Candy.
This is Jack.

997
01:13:32,295 --> 01:13:34,364
- Hello.
- And goodbye.

998
01:13:34,464 --> 01:13:36,866
Well, maybe I'll see you later.

999
01:13:36,966 --> 01:13:37,993
Yeah, I hope so.

1000
01:13:38,093 --> 01:13:40,064
You know, that's some rude shit
to be pulling, man.

1001
01:13:40,164 --> 01:13:41,496
That's the second time this week.

1002
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:43,999
- Where's Luther?
- Where's Ganz?

1003
01:13:44,099 --> 01:13:45,166
We missed.

1004
01:13:45,266 --> 01:13:47,014
No, we didn't miss nothing.
You missed, man.

1005
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:49,400
Luther went and took a cab
to that hotel across the street,

1006
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,463
and he made a phone call.

1007
01:13:50,563 --> 01:13:52,215
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

1008
01:13:52,315 --> 01:13:53,592
Don't make no sense to go get him.

1009
01:13:53,692 --> 01:13:57,012
He left an 8:00 wake-up call,
put a "do not disturb" sign on his door,

1010
01:13:57,112 --> 01:13:58,104
and tomorrow morning,

1011
01:13:58,204 --> 01:13:59,922
he'll go and exchange
the money for the girl.

1012
01:14:00,022 --> 01:14:02,908
Only thing that's going to stop us
from catching Ganz is going blind, man.

1013
01:14:03,034 --> 01:14:05,111
Why didn't you just take the money
and split?

1014
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:09,357
I could've did that,
but I want Ganz just as bad as you do.

1015
01:14:09,457 --> 01:14:12,118
I'll let you in on a little secret, Jack.

1016
01:14:12,661 --> 01:14:13,661
Ta-da!

1017
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:18,332
Keep it. I'm too tired to argue about that.

1018
01:14:24,048 --> 01:14:25,798
Thanks for calling.

1019
01:14:28,969 --> 01:14:30,470
You know, I...

1020
01:14:33,891 --> 01:14:37,810
Well, "nigger" and "watermelon,"
I didn't mean that stuff.

1021
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:41,314
I was just doing my job,
keeping you down.

1022
01:14:42,483 --> 01:14:45,943
Yeah, well, doing your job
don't explain everything, Jack.

1023
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,820
Yeah, you're right.

1024
01:14:54,495 --> 01:14:56,905
Well, as long as you're feeling
like Abraham Lincoln...

1025
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:59,908
Listen, you see that girl over there
that you just made walk away?

1026
01:15:00,008 --> 01:15:01,008
Yeah.

1027
01:15:01,176 --> 01:15:03,184
She would love to take me to the hotel
across the street

1028
01:15:03,284 --> 01:15:06,798
and fuck my brains out,
but I ain't got no money for a room.

1029
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:10,384
I got...

1030
01:15:16,016 --> 01:15:19,977
- I got a 20. Yeah.
- This should be fine.

1031
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:22,806
Have fun, huh?

1032
01:15:22,906 --> 01:15:25,483
- I'm going to have sex, Jack.
- Yeah.

1033
01:15:29,822 --> 01:15:33,658
- You come here often, home?
- Yeah. This is my favorite place.

1034
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:40,698
Hey, this is my wife!
You whispering in my wife's ear?

1035
01:15:40,798 --> 01:15:43,042
I got rent money for one night!

1036
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,088
Lack of pussy make you brave, man!

1037
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:49,841
Come on, let's go.

1038
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:56,798
Excuse me, brothers. Excuse me.

1039
01:15:56,898 --> 01:15:58,842
So where do you want to go?

1040
01:15:58,942 --> 01:16:01,636
We can go right across the street
to the hotel if you want.

1041
01:16:01,736 --> 01:16:03,062
All right.

1042
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:09,185
Oh, shit. Come on.

1043
01:16:09,285 --> 01:16:11,404
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

1044
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:16,722
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1045
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:17,743
I'm sorry.

1046
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:20,496
- That was quick.
- Luther's on the move, man.

1047
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:55,448
Open your coat.

1048
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,825
Both sides.

1049
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,788
- Let her go.
- Money first.

1050
01:17:03,624 --> 01:17:05,124
Just show me!

1051
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,046
Set it there.

1052
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:13,708
- Rosalie, are you okay?
- Luther!

1053
01:17:13,808 --> 01:17:15,718
What are you talking about, huh?

1054
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,471
I said I wouldn't hurt her, didn't I?

1055
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,367
A bus! You goddamn whiskey mick cop!

1056
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:33,538
You lost a stolen bus!
I got five deaths related to Ganz!

1057
01:18:33,638 --> 01:18:36,465
And you blow it for
a lousy nigger convict!

1058
01:18:37,884 --> 01:18:40,720
That's right! I called him a nigger!
You bet I did!

1059
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:42,547
Come on.

1060
01:18:42,647 --> 01:18:44,659
Now, I saw the report
on that little piece of shit.

1061
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:48,136
If he's spent one legal day in his life,
it'll be a record!

1062
01:18:48,236 --> 01:18:49,554
And this is it for you!

1063
01:18:49,654 --> 01:18:52,398
Suspension, review board!
You've had it!

1064
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:55,606
As soon as it get round you protected
a con rather than nail a cop killer...

1065
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,737
Wait a minute, god damn it!

1066
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,532
I'm gonna tell you
something about this man.

1067
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:02,908
He's got more brains
than you'll ever know!

1068
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,787
He's got more guts
than any partner I ever had!

1069
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:11,334
Just 'cause you say it with conviction,
it don't mean shit to me!

1070
01:19:11,543 --> 01:19:13,419
Let's get out of here.

1071
01:19:16,506 --> 01:19:18,966
And where the Christ
do you think you're going?

1072
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:22,670
Don't you think
you're being kind of hard on the guy?

1073
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:25,056
You go fuck yourself, convict!

1074
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:48,329
- How'd my car get here?
- I had it impounded.

1075
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:52,283
We'll use it to take you
back to the slam.

1076
01:19:52,383 --> 01:19:54,952
Now, wait a minute.
Ganz got away with all my money,

1077
01:19:55,052 --> 01:19:57,955
and you're going to take me back to jail
in my own car?

1078
01:19:58,055 --> 01:20:00,208
Somehow this shit just don't seem right.

1079
01:20:00,308 --> 01:20:02,968
Yeah, a lot of things don't seem right.

1080
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:06,636
I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

1081
01:20:06,736 --> 01:20:09,266
I'll buy. It'll be my goodbye present.

1082
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:12,644
I feel real bad, Jack.
I feel like I let you down.

1083
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:16,148
No, you didn't let me down.
Hell, it was a long shot.

1084
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:19,360
We gave him a hell of a run, though.

1085
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:22,113
But we didn't catch him, man.

1086
01:20:57,732 --> 01:20:59,976
- Hello?
- Yeah, let me talk to Kehoe.

1087
01:21:00,076 --> 01:21:01,569
Yeah. Hold on.

1088
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:10,453
Kehoe, answer the damn phone.
It's for you.

1089
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,163
Hold on.

1090
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:14,790
- Yeah?
- Kehoe, how's it going?

1091
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:16,625
Not so good.

1092
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,337
- What about the other guys?
- They're all on the street.

1093
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:23,249
- How about the airport?
- It's clean.

1094
01:21:23,349 --> 01:21:25,801
- Train station?
- Same deal.

1095
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:29,138
They dumped the bus in Chinatown.

1096
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,308
Other than that, we got nothing.

1097
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:35,436
All right. I'll get back to you later on.

1098
01:21:42,235 --> 01:21:44,570
Nothing. No Ganz, no Indian.

1099
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:48,107
Airport's clean, bus station,
train stations, docks...

1100
01:21:48,207 --> 01:21:49,207
Shit.

1101
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:52,119
That's too bad, Jack.

1102
01:21:52,245 --> 01:21:55,281
Looks like the partnership ended
before it got a chance to start, huh?

1103
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:57,458
Yeah, some partnership, huh?

1104
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:03,255
- What's up with your lady?
- Hell, we had another fight. Why?

1105
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,604
If I was depressed and had a lady,
I'd go see her, man.

1106
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:07,676
It'd make me feel better.

1107
01:22:07,776 --> 01:22:09,553
I figure you wanted
to do the same thing.

1108
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,806
Nah. I'll make it up to her tomorrow.

1109
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:17,386
You think that big Indian
will go down to Chinatown

1110
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:19,375
- and try to patch it up with his girl?
- No, man.

1111
01:22:19,475 --> 01:22:20,639
Billy's girl don't want to see him.

1112
01:22:20,739 --> 01:22:21,991
I don't think he'll be going back there.

1113
01:22:22,091 --> 01:22:24,151
Well, they got the bus
down in Chinatown.

1114
01:22:24,277 --> 01:22:26,068
Jack, you're reaching for shit now,
all right?

1115
01:22:26,168 --> 01:22:27,376
Yeah, but you're the one that said

1116
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:29,484
when you're on the run,
you go back and visit your girl.

1117
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:32,193
Yeah, but Billy's girl don't have
no interest in his crotch, Jack.

1118
01:22:32,293 --> 01:22:33,999
She want to put some bullets
in his behind.

1119
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:36,030
Yeah, I am reaching. What the hell.

1120
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:39,708
You got important things to do,
like going back to jail.

1121
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:44,630
- Chinatown, huh?
- Yeah.

1122
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,442
There she is, Jack.

1123
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:14,660
Whatever play I make,
you just back me up.

1124
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,079
Come on.

1125
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,376
- I hear you got visitors.
- Would you guys...

1126
01:23:30,476 --> 01:23:32,420
Shut up. Don't give me any crap.

1127
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,715
Answer my questions
or I'll tear your fucking lungs out.

1128
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:39,343
You're Billy's girl, aren't you?
You've always been his girl.

1129
01:23:39,443 --> 01:23:42,263
Listen, the man can live or die.
It's up to you.

1130
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:44,682
Let us in
and he has a chance to make it.

1131
01:23:44,782 --> 01:23:46,817
Otherwise, he's a dead man.

1132
01:23:52,824 --> 01:23:54,325
He's in the first room down the hall.

1133
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:56,118
Where's Ganz?

1134
01:23:57,203 --> 01:23:59,530
He's in the back,
down the other corridor.

1135
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,290
All right. Come on.

1136
01:24:47,253 --> 01:24:49,755
Give it up, Billy. You got no chance.

1137
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:01,308
Billy, you're going to lose.

1138
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,029
Get down!

1139
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:18,117
Come on!

1140
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:24,039
Help me! Oh, God! Oh, God!

1141
01:25:30,755 --> 01:25:32,256
It's all over.

1142
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,887
Oh, God damn you!

1143
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:04,942
You ought to know, Reggie,

1144
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:08,120
if you come up against me,
you're going to lose.

1145
01:28:09,622 --> 01:28:10,698
Now, come on.

1146
01:28:10,798 --> 01:28:13,458
There's one more little thing
I got to take care of.

1147
01:28:18,965 --> 01:28:21,300
Hey, cop! Come on!

1148
01:28:21,843 --> 01:28:23,760
I got something for you!

1149
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:37,983
You're not going to make it.

1150
01:28:38,735 --> 01:28:41,896
What are you talking about?
I got your gun.

1151
01:28:41,996 --> 01:28:44,823
I got the money. I got everything.

1152
01:28:47,118 --> 01:28:49,570
Take aim, man,
and blow his fucking brains out!

1153
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:51,572
Bullshit! He ain't gonna try it.

1154
01:28:51,672 --> 01:28:53,040
Right, cop?

1155
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:59,338
Are you crazy, man? I was just bluffing!

1156
01:29:03,217 --> 01:29:04,551
I got hit.

1157
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:08,972
I don't believe it. I got shot!

1158
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:12,601
You're done. End of story.

1159
01:29:12,852 --> 01:29:14,019
You...

1160
01:29:47,637 --> 01:29:49,680
- I got to go, okay?
- Okay.

1161
01:29:53,559 --> 01:29:56,645
Look, here's a little something for you.

1162
01:29:57,105 --> 01:29:58,639
I told you I wasn't a pro.

1163
01:29:58,739 --> 01:30:00,516
Take that and buy yourself
something nice.

1164
01:30:00,616 --> 01:30:05,153
I'd do it, but I'm in a rush, okay?
I got a cop waiting for me downstairs.

1165
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:10,909
I'll be back in about six months.

1166
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:13,821
We'll get together and go out
and have a good time, all right?

1167
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:16,081
We'll go dancing or something.

1168
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:19,126
Okay. You take care of yourself.

1169
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:20,919
You, too.

1170
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:22,166
Bye.

1171
01:30:22,266 --> 01:30:23,964
I'll see you later.

1172
01:30:39,272 --> 01:30:40,389
All right. Bust my chops.

1173
01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:43,183
Tell me how great you were
with that chick in there.

1174
01:30:43,283 --> 01:30:46,403
I'm not going in for
all that macho shit, Jack.

1175
01:30:46,779 --> 01:30:48,071
I was great.

1176
01:30:48,489 --> 01:30:50,699
I should have my dick bronzed.

1177
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,165
This what you want to talk about?

1178
01:31:00,376 --> 01:31:01,816
Hey, come on, Jack. That's not fair.

1179
01:31:01,919 --> 01:31:03,996
I've been waiting for that money
for three years.

1180
01:31:04,096 --> 01:31:05,699
What happened to
all that merit system shit

1181
01:31:05,799 --> 01:31:06,798
you was talking about?

1182
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:08,792
It's your money.

1183
01:31:08,892 --> 01:31:11,261
It'll be there in six months
when you get out.

1184
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:19,061
And you don't want any of it?

1185
01:31:19,645 --> 01:31:21,104
Not my style.

1186
01:31:24,567 --> 01:31:25,726
I need a car.

1187
01:31:25,826 --> 01:31:28,570
How about loaning me
a couple thousand when you get out?

1188
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:31,656
What kind of car you want?

1189
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:33,492
Convertible.

1190
01:31:33,659 --> 01:31:35,327
I'm a rag top man.

1191
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:40,707
- Deal.
- Good.

1192
01:31:48,424 --> 01:31:50,584
But even if you do give me
the money for a car,

1193
01:31:50,684 --> 01:31:51,927
it don't mean shit.

1194
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:56,181
If I ever hear of you crossing the line,
I'll bust your ass.

1195
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:05,023
Now, Jack, the both of us know

1196
01:32:05,858 --> 01:32:08,560
that I'm gonna be an honest man
from now on, right?

1197
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,660
Good.

1198
01:32:12,698 --> 01:32:15,075
But if I did decide to be a thief,

1199
01:32:15,868 --> 01:32:18,495
what makes you think
you can catch me?

1200
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:23,667
Can I have my lighter back, Reggie?
