1
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,507
Why have I returned?

2
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,800
After eight or nine years

3
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,426
I've come back...

4
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,555
to a place that no longer exists.

5
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,268
I carry on doing things
thoughtlessly...

6
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,311
without thinking
the consequences.

7
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,689
As you used to do.

8
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,065
The laws of genetics never fail,

9
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,276
as Mom would say.

10
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,403
When I told her I was coming,
she looked at me...

11
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,004
with a clinical eye, thinking
I was sick.

12
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,825
Her professional constraint,
I suppose.

13
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,951
But she didn't ask questions.

14
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,787
She thought it was strange
that I'd return tomorrow...

15
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,082
not even staying overnight.

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,335
She didn't understand,
or maybe she understood everything...

17
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,962
With Mom you never know.

18
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,091
Why spend money
staying at hotels?

19
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,676
The bus arrives
early in the morning

20
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,343
and returns at 10 p.m

21
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,555
I'll have twelve hours going
back to Buenos Aires...

22
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,306
to think, and nearly
the whole day

23
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,184
for pedaling around for
a few kilometers...

24
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,603
to find out
why I have come here.

25
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm not a tourist

26
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,233
landscapes mean very
little to me...

27
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,320
hardly any old
acquaintances are left...

28
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,822
and not a single friend
lives here.

29
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,201
Perhaps I've just
come to have a chat...

30
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,203
with you...

31
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,872
to tell you about things
I went through,

32
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,625
and things I plan on doing.

33
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,711
It's tough at my age,

34
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,129
having to make so
many decisions,

35
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,255
and the last thing you
want to do at this age

36
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,008
is to make decisions.

37
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,913
Don't worry, I didn't come here
to find out about my father

38
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,764
or to really know you,

39
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,850
nor to expose your dark side.

40
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,852
It's something different.

41
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,145
You were always the crystal-
clear kind,

42
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,358
firm as a stonewall,
but transparent.

43
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,485
There were times when
I didn't understand you.

44
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,528
It wasn't your fault...

45
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,157
nor mine.

46
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,035
I was too small to
understand certain things.

47
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,163
When I started to understand them,

48
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,665
I realized I was...

49
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,750
no longer a child.

50
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,673
Maybe I've returned
to remember...

51
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:16,918
every detail of that winter.

52
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,011
I'd like to hear your story.

53
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,390
I only know part of it.

54
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,228
I played a part,

55
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,022
I eavesdropped and peeped.

56
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,901
Maybe I'm here because
I realized

57
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,279
old memories were fading away...

58
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,407
and it's foolish
to let this happen.

59
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,410
Certain things simply
can't be forgotten.

60
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,162
They must not be forgotten,

61
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,290
however painful.

62
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,197
Let's go Dumas!

63
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,658
Faster!

64
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,083
Faster Dumas!

65
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,320
Faster!

66
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,368
Faster Dumas!

67
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,036
Are you crazy?
If you want to kill yourself,

68
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,914
get somebody to kick your head.

69
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,791
I'm training for Racing Day.

70
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,467
Take this to the hotel.

71
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,346
Hold on.

72
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:56,976
What's your name?

73
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,311
Ernesto

74
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,439
I'm Hans... I'm going
to ask you a favor.

75
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,982
I've got some instruments here
which are destroyed by simply...

76
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,943
looking at them.

77
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,113
Try to dodge the potholes,

78
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:12,241
and if a train comes,
or an ostrich or a hare...

79
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,493
you keep your cool, okay?

80
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,745
The train comes on Saturdays,
and it's already here...

81
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,872
and there are no ostriches,

82
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,122
that leaves only the hares

83
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,500
and the potholes.

84
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,625
Yes, the potholes.

85
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,876
Don't worry...

86
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:22,878
Thanks...

87
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,090
This is for your mother, there's
less every time.

88
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,396
Where can I rent a car?

89
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,273
I've got one for you.

90
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,566
No, you shouldn't have bothered!

91
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,443
If you don't like the hotel,

92
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,904
you come over to my house.

93
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,197
No, I don't want to be a bother.

94
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,783
Maybe if it were for
a few weeks only,

95
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,076
but I'm staying much longer.
You'd end up kicking me out.

96
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,160
You? Never.

97
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,079
Leave that, it's mine!
The rocks are mine.

98
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,331
What's going on?
No, that's not mine.

99
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,958
You idiot! I told you
there were mine.

100
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,334
Hey kid, don't insult me!

101
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,795
Are you carrying rocks there?

102
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,713
Would you show me one?

103
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,966
Do you collect rocks?

104
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,677
It's beautiful

105
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,969
I also collect them.

106
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,053
What for?

107
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,055
It's my job.

108
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,101
Here. Someday you'll let me try
my luck against the train.

109
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,312
Maybe one day I'll beat it.
Is it a deal?

110
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,355
It's a deal.

111
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,506
What happened?

112
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,092
I had to go to the town.

113
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,896
I took a foreigner to the hotel!

114
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,898
A tourist? Tourists
never come here.

115
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,400
No, he's a German geologist...

116
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,986
hired by Andrada to search for oil
or something like that.

117
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,780
He's German but he speaks
like a Spaniard.

118
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,038
Is she busy?

119
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,164
Yes, she's with Elsa.

120
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,293
If you have another leak
you get straight into bed...

121
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,171
and you call me right away.

122
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,465
Don't try to be tough, OK?

123
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,467
Take half a pill a day...

124
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,844
and I'll see you in two weeks.

125
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:18,929
Thanks Ana.

126
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,971
You're welcome.

127
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,349
Patricia?

128
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,809
The medical samples arrived.

129
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,352
I guess I still have
some friends left,

130
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,853
put them in the drawer.

131
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,481
Hi...

132
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,984
All this oil story

133
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,444
sounds like a pipedream to me.

134
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,987
I'm just repeating
what people are saying.

135
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,864
Well, if our councilman
Andrada is involved...

136
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,616
it must be something dirty.

137
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,202
Maybe this man is
not even a geologist.

138
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,577
Maybe he isn't.

139
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,830
At least he has money.
He gave me a twenty dollar tip.

140
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,623
If he has money,
then he's not a geologist.

141
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,709
What are you going
to do with this money?

142
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,751
Don't you need it?

143
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,503
Keep it. Buy yourself a perfume...

144
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,256
so you can quit using mine.

145
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,035
Are you going to mass?

146
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,036
I'll be right back!

147
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,038
You keep out.

148
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,168
- Hi!
- Hi...

149
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,879
How's your little sister?

150
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,130
Getting better...

151
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,006
Aren't you coming?

152
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,048
There's no mass.

153
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,050
You can always pray...

154
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,260
I'm not Catholic...

155
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,303
Are you Jewish?

156
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,766
No, I'm not. My Mom is Jewish,
but not my Dad.

157
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,808
And what are you?

158
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,267
What do I know? Nothing I guess.

159
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,644
You have to believe in something.
Don't you believe in God?

160
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,646
No...

161
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,689
You're strange...

162
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,024
Are you staying around here?

163
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,067
I'll see you later...

164
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,824
Would you like to go in?

165
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,451
Come on, don't be scared.
Nothing is going to happen to you...

166
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,912
Cut it out, Nelda...

167
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,414
That way you can
scare your parents.

168
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,044
Father Damian has sent
his excuses;

169
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,214
He will be away until...

170
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,840
the Saints celebrations.

171
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,342
Make a list...

172
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,053
of all the children
to be baptized and...

173
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,179
for first communion.

174
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,222
Those of you who were
thinking of getting married...

175
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,849
give it another thought,

176
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,977
and anybody planning to die
will have to postpone it.

177
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,563
The Cooperative Society will
assemble in the barn.

178
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,439
Please take only what you need...

179
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,734
to replace the essential goods...

180
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,360
as we won't have money...

181
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,070
until after the shearing.

182
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,321
Things are rather complicated.

183
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,491
Mario will explain.

184
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,334
At your age, sugar is not good.

185
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,004
At my age I don't need vitamins.

186
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,756
Honey and mate don't mix well.

187
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,382
Well, your going to
take these pills...

188
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:02,967
don Gregorio, OK?

189
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,261
One per day. They'll
work wonders.

190
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,595
Are you going to take them?

191
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,223
The slickers can pressure us
but they won't show their cards.

192
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,891
That would expose their power.

193
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,144
Let's hold on a bit more.

194
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,521
If anybody has a problem,

195
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,981
we'll all help out.

196
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,857
But shearing cannot be delayed.

197
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,899
It can't!

198
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,734
Of course. I'm not saying that.
Let's go ahead but we keep the wool.

199
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,027
Andrada's offer is not bad.

200
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,362
We might lose 15%..

201
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,780
- 15%?
- I estimate 30%

202
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,407
maybe even more.

203
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,784
That maybe true, but
it's better to cash in now

204
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,037
rather than in a month.

205
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,664
Later he might refuse to buy.

206
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,916
I don't think so, but
there is a certain risk.

207
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,002
That's the price for avoiding
being pushed around.

208
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,628
Do as you like, Juan...

209
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,007
This is a Cooperative,
not a jail.

210
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,386
If you want to quit, tough luck.

211
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,055
Excuse me, Don Mario. Mr. Andrada
would like to speak with you.

212
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,182
Whenever you want,
you can stop by his ranch.

213
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,060
He'll be waiting for you.

214
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,770
Did he say what for?

215
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,190
Business, he said. It's urgent.

216
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,443
Tell him he'll have
to wait a few days...

217
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,945
twenty or thirty days...

218
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,655
until his friends announce...

219
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,324
the price for the wool.

220
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,450
Then we'll talk.

221
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,077
Okay, I'll tell him..

222
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,080
He also sent a message
for you, don Juan.

223
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,664
To go and pick up your check...

224
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,959
the sooner the better

225
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,836
I'm not going, Zamora.
Tell Andrada that...

226
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,172
I sold my wool to the Cooperative.

227
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,050
He'll have to deal
with don Mario.

228
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,095
I'll tell him.
But he won't like it.

229
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,973
Are you threatening me?

230
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,976
I'm a peaceful man, don Juan.

231
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:36,977
I mean it as a friend.

232
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,357
Thank you, Zamora, but
as far as I know,

233
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,485
you're nobody's friend, so save
your advice for somebody else.

234
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,121
Thank you, Juan... I think
everything will be OK.

235
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,498
Andrada will have
to buy, because he has...

236
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,583
to sell.

237
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,756
This is for you.

238
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,764
Why are you giving this to me?

239
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,516
"The Call of the Wild",
I have two of them.

240
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,518
Thank you.

241
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,520
It's a nice story.
It's about a dog in Alaska.

242
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,606
You'll like it. Read it
and then tell me.

243
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,651
I can't read, Ernesto.

244
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,045
You'll have to return that, Ernesto.

245
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,923
The guy made a mistake.

246
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,382
Mom said it was okay!

247
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,176
What did I say?

248
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,636
To keep the tip!

249
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,304
Mom's also mistaken.

250
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,828
The man has no idea
of money's worth.

251
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,685
And it's a tip.
Why must you take tips?

252
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,521
Just stick to your price,

253
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,397
and don't accept charity.
He's right..

254
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,108
Be strong, boy. Sometimes
you've got to lose.

255
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,029
That doesn't mean
you can use my perfume!

256
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,487
What perfume?

257
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:13,033
Perfume? Who said
anything about a perfume?

258
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,159
I don't know...

259
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,411
Okay. Fix up the table,
the food is almost ready.

260
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,873
My hearing is getting
worse everyday.

261
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,012
Excuse me...

262
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,933
Bye Ernie. Have a good rest.

263
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,021
Why don't you undress
and get into bed?

264
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,399
It's late already.
You have to sleep.

265
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:47,566
I'm not sleepy.

266
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,068
Then you walk about
in a daze all day.

267
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,321
You're hardly sleeping
four hours per night.

268
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,281
You won't feel well.

269
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,076
Good night...

270
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:09,983
The rain fell heavily...
during three days.

271
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,901
Very well... "The rain fell heavily"

272
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,237
for three days".

273
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,842
Where is the subject
in this sentence?

274
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,156
- The rain...
- Very Good...

275
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,241
"fell heavily during
three days" is the...

276
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,618
Predicate...

277
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,162
Predicate. Very good...

278
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,914
The rain... What happened
with the rain?

279
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,791
Let's see, what did the rain do?

280
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,792
Pay attention...

281
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,170
Dad...;Dad!

282
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,255
Yeah?

283
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,923
It's the geologist.

284
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,011
Come with me...

285
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,555
You finish copying.

286
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,439
- Good Morning...
- Good Morning.

287
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,565
Sorry. I didn't intend...

288
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,690
coming up to here.

289
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,941
It's all right. No problem.

290
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,193
I'm a bit lost.

291
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,695
Is this the way to Bermejo Valley?

292
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,571
Yes. The road goes
through the town.

293
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,074
I'm not going there.

294
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,784
You... what are you doing here?
You go to this school?

295
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,953
No, I live here.
I can't help it.

296
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,079
He's my son...

297
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,832
Obviously you don't let
him skip class.

298
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,960
But I'm not going to town.

299
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,087
I'm heading to the valley,
to Andrada's ranch.

300
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,463
There's a bypass...

301
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,744
some ten kilometers from town...

302
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,467
But that won't get in...

303
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,720
There's no road; You'll need
a four wheel drive

304
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,804
I'll get as far as I can

305
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,045
I can walk. I have strong legs.

306
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,102
Ernesto has something
to tell you.

307
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,980
Excuse me, I must carry on.

308
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,106
Thanks.

309
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,820
You made a mistake.
You gave me too much money.

310
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,989
You earned it.

311
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,619
But this is a tip.
I charge a fee for my work.

312
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,621
I can't accept this.

313
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,875
Sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you.

314
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,716
Come on! Come on!

315
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,012
Come on!

316
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,284
I think it's time I stuff my
Spanish pride and accept...

317
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,161
your suggestion.

318
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,288
I'll rent the horse.

319
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,039
Dumas? Dumas is not for rent.

320
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,166
We can ask don Cosme.

321
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,544
Maybe he has a good horse.

322
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,671
Only Dandy. The rest are raw
material for hotdogs.

323
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,130
Could I keep it here?

324
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,048
The hotel is nice, but it
doesn't have any stable.

325
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,758
- I'll look after it.
- Good.

326
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,927
Rent it for three
or four months...

327
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:44,928
maybe more.

328
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,639
What are you going
to do in the valley?

329
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,141
Oil. Councilman
Andrada is convinced..

330
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,018
There's oil on his land.

331
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,060
Totally bizarre.

332
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,146
Well, if there isn't any oil, I'll
pack my stuff...

333
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,441
- and return to Madrid...
- Madrid? I'm from Madrid!

334
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,067
Really? How's that?

335
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,321
We were there eight
years; Ernesto was born there.

336
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,446
Whereabouts in Madrid?

337
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,448
Cuatro Caminos...

338
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,074
I live just beside Plaza de
Castilla, in Colonia del Carmen...

339
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,827
- Hello...
- Hello!

340
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,705
Ana, my wife... this is Hans...

341
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,830
Hans Mayer...

342
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,667
Andrada's friends are not welcome...
in this house.

343
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,835
Hi...

344
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,046
I'm not his friend.
I only work for him.

345
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,297
Anyway, I was on my way out...

346
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,090
Would you lend me your pants?

347
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,091
Yes, of course..

348
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,468
If that's how it is,
you can stay.

349
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,845
I'm sorry.

350
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,179
I accept your apology...

351
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,181
but I still have to go.

352
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,975
Here...

353
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:37,189
Come on. Take it.
It's not a tip...

354
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,359
it's for saving me
from the quicksand.

355
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,612
- Goodbye...
- Goodbye!

356
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,616
Bye...

357
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,498
Did he kiss your hand?

358
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,875
No, he did like this...

359
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,876
Is that how they greet in Spain?

360
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,879
Only with princesses.
Your mother is a princess.

361
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,505
I had lost my palace...

362
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,507
and this man has discovered me!

363
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,218
And I don't know
what to do with my life!

364
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,890
Keep a loose grip.
Use your knees.

365
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,099
Fine, what else?

366
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,392
Don't pull too much
or he'll balk.

367
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,102
What he likes best is to trot.

368
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,270
So try to make him trot,
and don't be afraid.

369
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,899
If you're afraid, he'll know
and then you're screwed.

370
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,233
What did you say his name was?

371
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,401
Dandy...

372
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,653
He must like it.

373
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,279
- And to start him?
- Use your heels.

374
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,318
A privilege for the few!
High society kids...

375
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,519
always took riding lessons.

376
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,446
Good Morning!

377
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,324
The boss has gone to the city.

378
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,365
He won't be back soon.

379
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,577
But if you changed your mind

380
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,703
I can phone him.

381
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,079
No, this is not about the wool.

382
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,748
It's about your daughter.

383
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,957
Luciana?

384
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,001
What is it?

385
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,129
My son tells me that
she can't read.

386
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,214
Didn't she go to school?

387
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,383
No. When her mother
died she had to...

388
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,136
take over the house, the kids.

389
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,514
Whenever she can she joins
the women here.

390
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:19,267
Makes some extra money.
That helps.

391
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,478
She's hard working...

392
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,523
she can't go around
wasting her time.

393
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,273
Maybe we can
arrange something...

394
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,151
I would like her to
come to school...

395
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,153
It doesn't have to be every day

396
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,737
until she learns to
read and write.

397
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,155
Did she ask you?

398
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,492
No, but I don't think
she'll refuse.

399
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,161
Her opinion doesn't count.

400
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,871
I'm saying no.

401
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,790
Look Zamora, you're
a good father.

402
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,043
It's not easy for a man to
raise kids all by himself...

403
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,919
as you have done, but someday...

404
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,130
they'll have to fend
for themselves.

405
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,050
Then, they'll remember you.

406
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,677
And getting a job being illiterate...

407
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,554
Someday Luciana will be
put to run this place,

408
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,430
just like her mother.

409
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,932
She won't need to...

410
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,767
look for another job.

411
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,435
She won't find a better
place than here.

412
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,396
Because if it was good enough
for her mother...

413
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,597
than it's good enough for her.

414
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,818
Don't give her any funny ideas.

415
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,320
Stay out of my life.

416
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,703
Is it hard to teach
someone to read?

417
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,581
Not if other person
is willing to learn.

418
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,456
If you show me how,
I'll try to teach her.

419
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,333
OK, but don't let
the old man find out...

420
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,835
if Zamora catches you,

421
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:27,919
he'll kick your ass.

422
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,962
He won't know.

423
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,088
The key is to keep...

424
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,425
the student interested.

425
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,301
You can use the book
you gave her..

426
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,177
But don't just read.

427
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,220
What else, then?

428
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,723
You'll think of something.

429
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,246
BERYLLIUM...

430
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,625
It's a variation of emerald.

431
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,753
This is Galena,

432
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,755
the transistor's grandma.

433
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,257
It has crystals which are
sensitive to radio waves...

434
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,259
so you can pick up a station

435
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,012
using a needle and a
little bit of patience.

436
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,393
You never had problems?

437
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,519
Yes. Several, luckily!

438
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:28,648
Holy shit! Sorry sister,
but this pepper...

439
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:29,773
stings like hell!

440
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,609
It's a very small chili...

441
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,527
and very hot.
It's called "God dammit."

442
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,362
"God dammit"? That's
about right!

443
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,615
Luckily the priest rarely
comes by.

444
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,617
I've been warned...

445
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,993
If they wish, they can expel me.

446
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,244
She doesn't wear habits
because she's still a novice.

447
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,914
Nun's habits set a distance.
I never use one.

448
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,750
It's like telling people...

449
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,292
"I'm different."

450
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,878
That's not how I think.

451
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,003
If you're still a novice,

452
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,171
then I still have a chance.

453
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,923
I'm a downright nun.

454
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,383
She's saying that
to keep you away.

455
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,259
Although nuns can
drop their habits...

456
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,302
or lift them up.

457
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,263
Every time some attractive
guy shows up...

458
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,265
they organize a dinner
to hook me up.

459
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,017
Not because they love me.

460
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,018
They're just atheists
and anticlerical.

461
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,895
You're very pretty Nelda,

462
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,815
Seems strange that you're
only married to God.

463
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,193
He got you there, Nelda.

464
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,444
Come on, fling up your slipper!

465
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,780
What should I do? Drop
everything and go to Spain?

466
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,657
Hold it! I haven't
proposed anything yet!

467
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,450
It's a passing proposition.

468
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,077
A "quickie".

469
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,329
Hey, don't be vulgar!

470
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,454
Don't listen Ernesto.

471
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,331
Really Nelda, what made
you become a nun?

472
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,458
I can't spot any trace of...

473
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,086
hysterical mysticism in you.

474
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,964
Another heathen. I can do
what I do because I'm a nun.

475
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,841
I would've liked to have a family,

476
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,469
but instead I chose people.

477
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,724
You've never felt anything...

478
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,599
for anybody?

479
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,978
Fall in love you mean?

480
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,732
Once, I thought. But I preferred
not to find out.

481
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,484
She did find out,
but she got scared.

482
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,736
Scared of being your in-law!

483
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,738
Don't give up, Spaniard.

484
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,865
If I ever change my mind,

485
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,700
it won't be with a married man...

486
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,952
with four kids.

487
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,828
How do you know I'm married?

488
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:08,747
At your age, if you're not
married or have kids...

489
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,498
Then I must be gay
or have some mental issue?

490
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,500
Well, not really... I'm not crazy,

491
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,128
but I've been married... twice.

492
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,591
And divorced. No kids,
and that bugs me.

493
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:21,510
I would relapse with you...

494
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,888
if you guarantee...

495
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,514
a baby girl with your eyes.

496
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,641
Well, well, well.

497
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,643
- Well what?
- Don't listen Ernesto!

498
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,978
The stew is ready. Can we eat?

499
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,646
I use my surname Plaza...

500
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,149
to show that I'm not German.

501
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,649
Mayer Plaza with a "Y"?

502
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,734
Yes...

503
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,737
Mayer Plaza sounds very posh.

504
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,405
Sounds like a five star hotel.

505
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:43,532
Now, people don't ask
me if I'm German...

506
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,409
Now they call me "Hans
from the Mayer Plaza"

507
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,243
I keep repeating I have
no accommodations.

508
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:48,788
- Is Mayer Jewish?
- No, it's Nazi...

509
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:49,913
- Nazi?
- Yes, Nazi...

510
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,791
My father was in the Condor
Legion.

511
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,542
Some Republican made
a hole in his plane,

512
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,668
he bailed out...

513
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,422
but somehow his Swastika got
effaced...

514
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,673
and he landed in the hospital.

515
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,801
My mother was a nurse, and
she had to take care of him.

516
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,429
They fell in love.

517
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,932
The war was over for him,
he deserted.

518
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,642
And my mother was deserted.

519
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,560
My mother's rich family

520
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,186
turned their backs on her.

521
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,271
I came in at the wrong time,
as usual.

522
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,148
When I was born, they
didn't have anything.

523
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,191
No money.

524
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,318
Until I was about twelve...

525
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,321
we were on the ropes.

526
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,073
- Tough times...
- I got it.

527
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,575
Worse than tough. But one day
Grandpa died...

528
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,451
and apparently he forgot to

529
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,328
disinherit my mother.

530
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,038
She was an only child...

531
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,456
so we became millionaires!

532
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,834
We bought a house, two cars

533
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,086
we hired a maid...
a housekeeper.

534
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,464
But later on, the Prussian officer...

535
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,842
went after girls.
My mom started drinking,

536
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,594
My little brother
went in the army

537
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,719
and I became an anarchist.

538
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,972
I found my vocation selecting

539
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,808
rocks to throw at
Franco's police.

540
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:53,184
Did you become a deserter?

541
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,853
No, I didn't have the guts.

542
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:56,729
- "There's something else..."
- You deserted,

543
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,983
just like your father...
Same story again.

544
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,693
You deserted all
that was expected...

545
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,735
of you.

546
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,195
"Until he killed his father."

547
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,738
Only then he became a person.
Somebody with true potential.

548
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,115
My father's alive.

549
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,867
In five minutes they'll prove...

550
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,119
to you that you were wrong.

551
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,371
Homemade psychoanalysis is
more popular than soccer here.

552
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,498
Easy on the wine.

553
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,583
- I've only started.
- In a moment he'll say...

554
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,502
"There's no shrink...
like a barman".

555
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,254
There's no shrink like a barman.

556
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,218
The generating word here
is "call".

557
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,971
CHANGE, CALL, GIVE, MEASURE.
Copy up to here.

558
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,849
You're doing all right.

559
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,146
It was an old flat,
with plenty of light...

560
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,397
very beautiful.

561
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,608
Before that, we lived
a year in Paris.

562
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,401
But Madrid was the best.

563
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,280
- Buenos Aires...
- Not by a mile...

564
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,490
Objectively you can't compare them.

565
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:49,908
Now if you put in
your feelings...

566
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,159
that's something different.

567
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,994
Feelings are there.

568
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,075
But they're also in Madrid.

569
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,624
I miss Madrid more
than Buenos Aires.

570
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,168
We were very happy there.

571
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,794
I don't know why we came back...

572
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,379
We came back because
we never really left.

573
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,422
There was no other choice.

574
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,798
Were you part of the Montoneros?

575
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,799
No, just Peronists.

576
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,135
Not even that.

577
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,804
Our "comrades" sacked
Mario from the university.

578
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,807
He was a Sociology professor.

579
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,517
I was a fool, they used me.

580
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,561
Don't talk about that now.

581
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,712
Then things started getting
worse...

582
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:23,192
people began to disappear...

583
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,444
close friends.

584
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,446
One night we came home and
found the military inside.

585
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:32,785
We barely escaped.

586
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:42,211
We escaped, but
they got Ernesto.

587
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,466
Ernesto was my brother...

588
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,097
He had nothing to do with it.

589
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,849
They were after me.

590
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,606
At that moment
we were in Brazil.

591
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:07,235
We'd been hiding in Buenos Aires,

592
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,947
then crossed the
border to Brazil.

593
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,742
We never told him anything,

594
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:15,828
so he didn't have to worry.

595
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,005
It was worse. What could he say
if he knew nothing?

596
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,359
- I'll make more coffee?
- No, I'll do it.

597
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,662
Hans, when you have some time...

598
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,539
could you talk to the kids?

599
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,668
Give them a lecture
about geology.

600
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:05,753
No rush...

601
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:08,421
Yes, I can talk.

602
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:10,590
As for teaching,
I'm not patient with kids.

603
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,468
And this stuff about
rocks can't be taught...

604
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,593
like reading or math.

605
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:17,180
Sorry for the lame moment, Hans,
but it's over now.

606
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:21,601
- Lame moment?
- Lame moment, sad moment.

607
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,437
One risks falling into
a hermit's cave.

608
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,482
But it's over now.

609
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,483
I'm not worrying.

610
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,984
And you
shouldn't be apologizing.

611
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,111
The way you carry ahead,
how long have you been here?

612
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,237
Three years?

613
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,490
- Four years...
- After four years in a place like this,

614
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:36,950
I would be worse...

615
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,367
I'd be talking to the moon.

616
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,622
It's a place like any other,
neither better nor worse.

617
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:44,333
That is mysticism. But your
case is more complicated.

618
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,209
I understand that you
wanted to leave Madrid...

619
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,879
but why leave Buenos Aires?

620
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,130
You're neither hippies nor
green activists,

621
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,131
nor Franciscan monks.

622
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,884
We had to choose, Hans.

623
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,512
To live like tourists in Madrid,

624
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:59,139
or like middle class
vegetables in Buenos Aires.

625
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,519
It was Nelda's fault.

626
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:06,229
She told us what she
was doing here...

627
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,732
and that she felt lonely,
and that was it.

628
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,234
That's a big lie.
It was their own idea.

629
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,237
We had some dollars
saved up in Spain,

630
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:17,281
which we used to start
running the Cooperative.

631
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,033
We built the shed for the chapel,

632
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,661
financed the first community
purchases.

633
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,664
What we do is real,
you can see it.

634
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,250
It makes you feel good.

635
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,548
We do miss many things,
but it's bearable.

636
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,132
So between the three of you,

637
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,300
you control education,
health, faith,

638
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,553
and the economy of
Valle Bermejo,

639
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,834
and its surroundings.
Am I right?

640
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,932
Sounds dangerous when
you say it like that.

641
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,516
Please don't repeat it.

642
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,394
We're not in control,
we just help.

643
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,062
That humbleness hides
the Red Flag...

644
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,399
follow our example
world proletarians!

645
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,776
Proletarians?
They're not even farmers!

646
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,277
Some of them have to
rent the land...

647
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,821
but most of the Cooperative members
own a little piece of land.

648
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,531
I would've preferred
something else,

649
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:01,200
but at least it's something.

650
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,327
It's a good start. The farm...

651
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,664
then the town, the province,
the world!

652
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,958
May God hear you!

653
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,086
Your idealism is very touching.

654
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,920
Is that good or bad?

655
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,964
It belongs to another world.

656
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,466
Kids starving to death...

657
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,342
belong to another world?

658
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,844
You think they come
to school to learn?

659
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,555
No! They come because
here they can eat...

660
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:22,598
at least once a day!

661
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,723
You have to be realistic!

662
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,349
This is south of the Rio Grande,
comrades!

663
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,434
Friends, if you please.

664
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:30,938
When the world was distributed,
you got the worst part, friends.

665
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,108
You sound like a fascist priest:

666
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:36,862
"It's God's will,
take it and shut up."

667
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,614
Not God, the
multinational corporations.

668
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,072
Don't argue with the girls, Hans.

669
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,867
They're ferocious
and they'll beat you up.

670
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,201
He deserves it!

671
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,995
In the end, we're all
on the same side:

672
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,580
The losers...

673
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:48,957
Lose the battle but not the war?

674
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,459
No. The war is lost,

675
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,060
but at least I would like
win one battle.

676
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:56,005
Who can beat that?

677
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,633
With Mario yes... But you?
You're a male chauvinist...

678
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:01,135
A primate... The war was won
by the primates.

679
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,012
The energy of the species
against Christ,

680
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,139
Marx, against Bakunin.

681
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,391
A triumphal regression
to the Age of Darkness.

682
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:11,020
Each one up his own tree.
Liberty, Fraternity, bullshit!

683
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,731
Sounds very nice, but
it's boring.

684
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,900
We're primates, we can't change.

685
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,902
Risk, adventure, and the
struggle for life...

686
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,404
makes us feel alive.

687
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,864
We enjoy bashing our
neighbor's head,

688
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,658
and eating up his liver.

689
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,284
But always adding some garlic
and parsley,

690
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,370
to make it civilized.

691
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,544
Let's go, Dumas!

692
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,554
That son of a bitch!

693
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,065
Let's go Dumas!

694
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,675
Luciana...

695
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,095
- Luciana!
- What are you doing here?

696
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,682
Is your Dad home?

697
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,350
On Saturdays he goes
to the fields...

698
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:36,810
he won't be back until tonight.

699
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:39,980
Don't tell him I was here.

700
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,074
I'll teach you to read,
if you want.

701
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,743
I don't know...
It's hard for me.

702
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,746
I don't want you to
waste your time.

703
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,623
Let's try.

704
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,605
It's too much for me...
I told you.

705
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:25,024
No, it's because you're
left handed.

706
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,109
It's always more difficult
for left handed people.

707
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,653
Haven't you noticed everything
is made for right handed people?

708
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,905
If you were Jewish you'd be OK,

709
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:32,406
because they read backwards.

710
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,908
You write in Jewish too?

711
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,744
Only a few words.

712
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,287
- Write something.
- Not now. Some other day.

713
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,914
Now, let's carry on with that.

714
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,166
That's because you don't know.

715
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,877
Give me a paper.

716
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,193
What is it?

717
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,529
My Grandma always sings it.

718
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,035
It's a lullaby of some sort.

719
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,454
What does it mean?

720
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,829
As beautiful as the moon,

721
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,290
sparkling like the stars.

722
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,423
Come on, carry on.

723
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,229
- Here you go.
- Thank you...

724
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,358
Easy, kids, it's boiling hot.

725
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,498
Here, you carry on.

726
00:43:08,962 --> 00:43:10,754
What's this for?

727
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,382
It's a theodolite.

728
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:16,260
It's used for taking measurements.

729
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,781
But to explain, better
join me and see.

730
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,390
I can't, I'm in class.

731
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,642
- After, then.
- Would you like to be a geologist?

732
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,894
- Do you make a lot of money?
- Like any other job.

733
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,979
Some talent, lots of luck.

734
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,898
And a lot of "yes, sir".

735
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,277
If you care about money,
you'll have it.

736
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,153
You'll be a shit like me,

737
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:36,031
but with money.

738
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,795
Hans!

739
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,840
I didn't think you'd come.

740
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,846
I have something for you. Look.

741
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:46,350
An echinoderm, a fossil.
For your collection.

742
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,102
You may find more around.

743
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,229
What are these blueprints for?
Does Andrada want to...

744
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,730
build a dam?

745
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,857
No, he thought they could be
useful.

746
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,318
These are from an old project.

747
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,237
Andrada doesn't want water,
he wants oil.

748
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:00,115
He likes money, like you.
Get going...

749
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,825
I'll show you how this works.

750
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,124
You have to walk respectfully...

751
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,960
we're stepping on
the bottom of the sea.

752
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,133
Look over there.

753
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:24,263
External nucleus, outer stratum,
and cortex.

754
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:27,141
I'm sure you all find
the mountain very boring,

755
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:29,143
and to prevent that,

756
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:31,020
we'll walk on a ball of fire.

757
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:33,272
Exciting,

758
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:35,150
a great adventure.

759
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:37,526
What if I told you that
you do this every day?

760
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:39,738
Day and night you walk over a...

761
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,657
thick carpet, but in fact...

762
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:47,745
you're walking on molten fire.

763
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,247
Because, strange as it may seem,

764
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,498
nothing remains still,

765
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,293
nothing is what it seems.

766
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,172
For example, people say that
if you talk to rocks,

767
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,256
you're insane.

768
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,634
That's partly right.

769
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,137
One must not talk to them...

770
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,638
but let them do the talking.

771
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,807
First, you must understand
their language.

772
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,311
Just like with people, right?

773
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,313
This rock...

774
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,775
what is this rock saying?

775
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,651
Let's see, you...

776
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,572
and you? Does the
rock say anything to you?

777
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,950
Not a word?

778
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:29,204
I can hear it...
because I know its language.

779
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:32,582
It tells me stories of
millions of years ago,

780
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,460
of thunderstorms, of rains.

781
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,295
I can see dark skies
and lightning,

782
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,799
and animals and plants,
like this leaf...

783
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,718
driven by the storm

784
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,846
until this was formed.

785
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,851
This, which seems
like a silly rock.

786
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:56,855
Nothing is silly,
nothing is too small...

787
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,692
Ice, for instance, is the
mountain's worst enemy.

788
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:04,072
When it rains, the water
goes through the cracks,

789
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,199
and at night, it becomes ice.

790
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,370
It grows, and it
breaks the rock.

791
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,333
Slowly, it disintegrates the rock.

792
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,585
The mountain knows it,
and groans...

793
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,589
she can't defend herself,
but she groans.

794
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:26,261
A humming is heard
before a storm...

795
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,595
they call it the "bees' song".

796
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,639
Because it's like a
spluttering of sparks...

797
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,767
like a humming of bees.

798
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,272
Some people say it's the air

799
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,399
loading up electricity,
but I prefer to think...

800
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,359
it's the mounting moaning.

801
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,279
Knowledge brings us
closer to magic.

802
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,907
This is not magic,
but it's fantastic.

803
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,909
This light is called
ultraviolet light.

804
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,120
It carries us deep into caves...

805
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,841
with this we can paralyze
the cave monsters.

806
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,540
Come close everybody.

807
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,793
Listen! This light can paralyze
the cave monsters...

808
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:02,045
but it's also useful
for other things.

809
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,047
To prove it, we need
complete darkness.

810
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,175
Turn off the light, Ernesto.

811
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:10,305
Only in darkness you can
see the rocks' soul.

812
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:16,311
Look at this one.

813
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,401
Look! Do you see it?
Each one has its own soul,

814
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,030
in shape and color.

815
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,704
This one is called axinite,

816
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:37,789
a word that comes from the Greek.

817
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,208
When the Greeks
talked to this rock,

818
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,293
they would call it axinite
or something like that.

819
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,461
Here, you take it,

820
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:44,171
but be careful,

821
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,714
you can't look
straight at this light.

822
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:48,342
It doesn't work with people,

823
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:49,801
it's only for rocks.

824
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,805
For people... well,
nothing has been invented yet.

825
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:51,905
"Once and again upon observing the
brutal punishments..."

826
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:56,034
"Buck understood the lesson:."

827
00:49:56,035 --> 00:50:01,040
"A man armed with a stick..."

828
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:07,045
"was the lawmaker, a master
that had to be obeyed..."

829
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:12,300
"although not necessarily loved."

830
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,011
What happened to your face?

831
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:17,432
Where? Oh nothing,
I cut myself shaving.

832
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:21,769
Not necessarily loved.

833
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:27,066
"Buck was never guilty
of this feeling..."

834
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:32,405
"but he saw other dogs
beaten until defeated..."

835
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:37,952
"who adored the man,
wagged their tails..."

836
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,037
"and licked his hands..."

837
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,081
It's your turn now...

838
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,334
"Once and again..."

839
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:54,302
"Once... and again..."

840
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,973
- "upon observ..."
- Upon observing. Looking.

841
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,351
I know what is to look,
I'm not stupid.

842
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:03,978
OK, carry on...

843
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:11,861
"Upon observing... the bru..."

844
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:15,239
I can't. Let's quit. I can't.

845
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,492
Come on, try again.

846
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,119
I'll read it again.

847
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:22,080
No, leave me...

848
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:35,967
Some other day, then. But
do the exercises.

849
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,094
It'll help...

850
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:38,513
I can't. I don't have time.

851
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,263
Before going to sleep..

852
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,015
I can't. I fall asleep!

853
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,016
Better leave it, Ernesto.

854
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,267
Some people study by night...

855
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,770
they study very
complicated things...

856
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,395
You have to want to
learn, that's all...

857
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,856
I want to, but I can't.

858
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,109
I'm slow. I already told you!

859
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,277
Is it easy for you
to clean the bosses' shit?

860
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,654
You like that? You'll
do that for the rest of your life?

861
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,780
Somebody has to do it!

862
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:57,990
But not you!

863
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,783
Even if I can read, I'll
continue here...

864
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,535
I will never leave this place!

865
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,120
Who says that? Your Dad?
He says that,

866
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,914
because he was born a slave,
but you weren't.

867
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,666
Why not? Because you say so?

868
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,626
Leave me alone! If I read...

869
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:11,295
or clean shit it's my problem.
Nobody else should care!

870
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,171
I do! I care!

871
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,423
Why?

872
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,800
Because!

873
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,257
He's in fine shape,
congratulations.

874
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,634
Credit to my son...

875
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:23,301
You realize Vallejo?

876
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,803
They plan to beat us.

877
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,680
Make your bet, Andrada.

878
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,556
I don't like to take
from the poor, but...

879
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,184
I'll bet.

880
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,186
Let's have some wine, Juan...

881
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,187
This friend from Buenos Aires
wants to meet you.

882
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,439
Don't take bribes, Juan...

883
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,315
That would be throwing
money away.

884
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,277
Have you decided on
the wool, Dominici?

885
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,696
The offer still holds.

886
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:44,155
I thought you didn't like
to take from the poor.

887
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,325
When the official price is set,
we'll talk.

888
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,326
When the official price is set,

889
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:50,047
you'll have to stick
the wool up your asses.

890
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,333
I can't believe nobody
tries to keep something.

891
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,836
If they do and they're caught,
they're out.

892
00:54:57,837 --> 00:54:59,087
It's not worth the risk.

893
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,714
My Dad says that you're
all communists,

894
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,841
that you deceive people...

895
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,301
mess things up.

896
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,468
You believe him?

897
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,930
- Those are Andrada's words.
- He's the one cheating people.

898
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,472
Old church zealots!
What the hell...

899
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,350
Not very pious language, Sister.

900
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,813
Come on man, you can't
refuse me.

901
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:20,484
We have to celebrate.

902
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:22,736
Where are the kids, Luciana?

903
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:23,987
Have they eaten already?

904
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,489
They're playing,
I'll go and get them.

905
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,869
Wait for me at the chapel.

906
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,883
What's going on?

907
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,011
Come...

908
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:19,042
"Once again, upon ob-ser-ving..."

909
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:23,172
"the brutal punishments..."

910
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:29,428
"Buck understood the lesson:."

911
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:34,391
"A man"

912
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:38,145
"armed... with a stick..."

913
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:46,821
"was the..."

914
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:54,327
lawmaker... A master who

915
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:58,916
"had to be ob-eyed..."

916
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:09,093
Although not necessarily...
loved.

917
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,941
Thank you.

918
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,874
You read very well...

919
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,516
I understand what
you're saying, Sister...

920
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,394
But nothing justifies... your
refusal to wear a nun's habit.

921
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,271
It turns your words...

922
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:04,647
into God's words!

923
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:06,232
God's word is God's word
either way...

924
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,901
They can't hear God's words,
and not because of my clothing.

925
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:09,861
God is for humans, and
before talking about God...

926
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,113
I have to see that they live...

927
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:13,114
like human beings.

928
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,534
Please excuse me a moment,
Father.

929
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,412
What is this?

930
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,787
What were you doing?

931
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,247
We were reading.

932
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,666
Sure... when I go to the
sacristy, you beat it!

933
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,294
Don't let the Father see you.

934
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,143
Hey, Andrada! Where's Juan?

935
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,561
I saw him a moment ago...

936
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:44,646
the guy was celebrating.

937
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:45,940
Carry on betting, gentleman...

938
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:47,690
- On Jengibre...
- Jengibre.

939
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,818
10000 on Jengibre!

940
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,195
Nobody matches it?

941
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,199
There he comes.

942
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,080
Here I am... Here I am!

943
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,581
Everything is OK...

944
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,209
- Bring Dumas along...
- This is Dumas.

945
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,919
Very cunning, Andrada...

946
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,797
I didn't do anything.
He got drunk on his own.

947
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:12,841
I'm not drunk, I'm happy!

948
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,846
And even if I'm drunk,
I'll beat Zamora!

949
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,935
Careful...

950
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,108
What a way to screw things up!

951
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,943
I sold the ranch, don Mario...

952
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:35,239
I sold it to the foreigner,
I couldn't avoid celebrating.

953
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:37,615
Help me, I can...

954
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,451
No, no... Lay off, man...

955
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:41,829
The race is suspended.

956
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:43,246
Nobody else can ride?

957
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:46,207
Ernesto can race... and win.

958
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,375
Don't let him, Mario...

959
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:49,627
No, no... Of course not.
This isn't for kids.

960
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:52,506
What about Hans? He's small but
he can ride a horse.

961
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:55,383
Very funny, Sister. No, not me.

962
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:57,093
He's better than me,
better than Zamora...

963
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,345
and anybody else.

964
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,473
Well, it seems that it
has been accepted.

965
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,267
It has been accepted
that I will not race.

966
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,018
He can't race.
He's Andrada's friend...

967
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,352
He can't compete against him.

968
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,146
Employee... Just an employee.

969
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,774
Come on, courage, man.
If you win I'll fire you...

970
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,402
but don't worry, you can't win.

971
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,863
This is for the expenses...

972
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,656
I'll bet the rest on Dumas!

973
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,659
Are you crazy? That's the
Cooperative's money!

974
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,787
Count it Andrada.
See if you can match it.

975
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,415
I don't have to count it,
I'll match it.

976
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:29,918
We're still without a horseman.
Who will ride?

977
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,175
Mario...

978
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,056
What are the rules?

979
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:44,058
- Get there first...
- OK.

980
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,820
Careful. I might touch you...

981
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:58,821
with my whip.

982
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,323
Go screw yourself!

983
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,950
- Ready?
- OK...

984
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:14,963
Come on Zamora!

985
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,993
Come here you old Spaniard...
You're a natural gaucho!

986
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:49,080
I hope you're just as
lucky finding oil.

987
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,125
I'll need a couple of wells,

988
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,835
to recover what I've lost today.

989
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:58,257
Ernesto! Ernesto is the winner!

990
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,472
Ernesto, Ernesto!

991
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:45,429
- Good afternoon...
- Good afternoon.

992
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,061
Come and help me, Ernie.

993
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:46,572
Get moving! Are you asleep?

994
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,615
- Dad...
- Yeah?

995
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:48,742
Can you talk to Mom?

996
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:50,994
Of course I can. What about?

997
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:56,250
Did you screw up?

998
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,002
Luciana and I were inside the church...

999
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,629
and Nelda found us.

1000
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:02,713
So what?

1001
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:05,341
She threw us out... We were
behind the altar...

1002
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,884
She came in with the priest, and...

1003
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,845
But... What happened?
What were you doing?

1004
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,640
Nothing, just reading... But
Nelda didn't believe us.

1005
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,016
She must've told Mom.

1006
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,852
Reading?

1007
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:16,895
I promise...

1008
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,399
Okay, I'll talk to her.

1009
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,245
Anybody wants tea?

1010
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:34,663
Please...

1011
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:40,293
How's Nelda? Did she
want anything?

1012
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,796
She's fine. Just wanted to chat.

1013
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,301
She looked worried.
Anything wrong?

1014
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,512
Nothing... Women stuff...
you know...

1015
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:02,440
Coward... Nelda's no squealer.

1016
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,567
The vaccines are ready...

1017
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,278
At a hospital in San Luis.

1018
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,570
We have to go and get them.

1019
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,780
That's good news, at last.

1020
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:11,032
When are we going?

1021
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:14,285
On Saturday.
We can stay until Sunday.

1022
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:15,328
What do you think?

1023
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:16,330
Can we go to the movies?

1024
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:17,455
Of course.

1025
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:19,583
Not me. I have to
go to Las Salinas.

1026
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,959
What fascinates me about you...

1027
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,837
is your youthful enthusiasm...
that love for life.

1028
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,089
Enjoy a little bit! You can
go to Las Salinas on Friday.

1029
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,592
And on Saturday
we go to the capital.

1030
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:29,800
Doctor's orders!

1031
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,844
No arguments allowed.

1032
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,500
Dad, thieves!

1033
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:04,753
They're in the corral!

1034
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:09,007
Stay in here, don't go out!

1035
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,267
Mario!

1036
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:21,645
No, no, no!

1037
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,026
Leave them, Ernie!

1038
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,190
Nothing to worry about Ernie.

1039
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:08,692
Is it broken?

1040
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,028
No, but it was a close shave.

1041
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:13,196
You'll have to keep still
a few days.

1042
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,073
Until they beat you up again.

1043
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,075
They won't stop until
they kick us out.

1044
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,287
Let them go on!
I was sacked once...

1045
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,454
They won't do it again.

1046
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:22,956
It's against me.
You're not Jewish.

1047
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,791
I'm tired of playing...

1048
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:25,958
the anonymous hero.

1049
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,586
It's not against you. They pretend
they're Nazis just to harass...

1050
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:30,964
Andrada is doing this
to pressure us...

1051
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,465
to get the wool.

1052
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,466
What are you going to do?

1053
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:34,968
I'll break his neck.

1054
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:37,179
He'll get you in jail...

1055
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:39,222
You have no proof against him.

1056
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,850
Go to bed, Ernie.

1057
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,601
You have to be up in two hours.

1058
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:45,937
Let's do something. We
won't say anything...

1059
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,981
So the Cooperative won't know.

1060
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:51,860
You did a good job.

1061
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,987
I'll go and cover up the signs,
and skin the sheep.

1062
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:55,989
- Now?
- Before the kids get to see it!

1063
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,824
Can I help you?
I'll prepare the lime.

1064
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,826
We know how fear works...

1065
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,747
Somebody finds out, gets
scared shitless...

1066
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,499
and will want to sell.

1067
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,127
Why don't you prepare some mate.

1068
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,504
- It's all over...
- I'm tired, Mario.

1069
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,507
Go to bed.

1070
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:15,132
I'm sick and tired.

1071
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,510
All this is useless, absolutely.

1072
01:08:16,635 --> 01:08:17,635
Don't get worked up now.

1073
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:20,097
I'm with the sick people,
but my mind is somewhere else...

1074
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,474
I have to go to Las
Salinas but I don't want to.

1075
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,226
Shall I tell them they'll
get cured?

1076
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,271
I know they won't get cured.
Nothing will change.

1077
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,686
What shall I tell the drunk?

1078
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,730
"Don't kill yourselves...
alcohol is bad for you...

1079
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:31,941
life is beautiful?"

1080
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,984
Please! And they
keep on bringing...

1081
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,987
children into this awful world.

1082
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,365
Don't they realize?

1083
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:42,077
I think they do, Ana.

1084
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,205
But they also see you,
which makes them think...

1085
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:47,581
not everything is rotten...

1086
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:50,335
Come on, go to bed.

1087
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,087
This is not the
right time to talk about this.

1088
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:55,589
We'll talk during the trip.

1089
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,632
I'm not coming.

1090
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,969
I want to stay alone.
You two can go.

1091
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,762
I can't drive.

1092
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,639
I know, but please
don't force me.

1093
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,392
Let me be alone.

1094
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,462
Luciana...

1095
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,843
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

1096
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,970
We might be seen!
Why did you come today?

1097
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:25,971
We said Saturday!

1098
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,973
I'm going to the capital.
I came here...

1099
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:28,974
to tell you.

1100
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,059
You're leaving? To live?

1101
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,562
No, just a little holiday.
I'll be back on Monday.

1102
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,107
I brought you more exercises.

1103
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,734
But you do them, okay?

1104
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:41,320
Okay, but leave now
before they see you. Bye.

1105
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:44,115
I'll see you on Saturday...
the next one.

1106
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,096
- Everything ready?
- Yes, everything.

1107
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:07,472
Got enough money for the hotel?

1108
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,224
Yes.

1109
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,644
Take care... Lock up the
house at night.

1110
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,853
Don't open if you see
something strange, okay?

1111
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:16,897
Nothing will happen... They
won't try again so soon.

1112
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,025
But... just in case.

1113
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,653
Don't be scared by thunder.

1114
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,364
And if they want to rape you,
just relax and enjoy it...

1115
01:11:25,365 --> 01:11:27,408
Don't be a wise guy,
you can't scare me.

1116
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:30,369
Have a good time! Take
care of your arm!

1117
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,538
And look after Ernesto...

1118
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:34,665
Did you bring your toothbrush?

1119
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,626
Wait, I got it.

1120
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,753
All this because he's
an only child.

1121
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,171
With four kids it
would be different.

1122
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,257
Four toothbrushes?

1123
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:46,051
You're right. Jewish mothers
are worse than Italians...

1124
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,513
My mother was just like Ana.

1125
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:50,806
Why didn't you have more kids?

1126
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,683
Decision or fate?

1127
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:55,270
I didn't want to. We
wanted a second child...

1128
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:56,812
but it took too long...

1129
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,814
later on, I didn't want
to keep trying...

1130
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,400
I'm 52. With a family tendency...

1131
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,445
to die young.

1132
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:06,322
I'm scared not being there
to watch him grow up...

1133
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:07,824
to protect him...

1134
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:11,077
I'm afraid with Ernesto,

1135
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,203
imagine with a new baby.

1136
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,295
Did we forget something?
What do you have there?

1137
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,964
Clothes...

1138
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,466
I'll need them to change!

1139
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:27,719
I may be crazy, but I
still have to be clean...

1140
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,245
On Sunday 25th we'll be at...

1141
01:12:55,246 --> 01:12:57,624
Valle Bermejo chapel all day.

1142
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,377
I wanted to ask people
to come...

1143
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,712
with their kids, it's important

1144
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:06,633
to vaccinate them. We'll have
a pick-up truck,

1145
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:10,010
I mean two trucks,
because a Spanish friend...

1146
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,347
will help us to bring people...

1147
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,265
from the neighboring towns.

1148
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:19,269
Sunday 25th, vaccination
for Sabin and Triple.

1149
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,982
Valle Bermejo chapel!

1150
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:25,025
We need sneakers, old clothes...

1151
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:28,655
powdered milk, alcohol,
band-aids... Whatever you...

1152
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,865
can send, will be useful.

1153
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,158
I don't like to ask for charity, but...

1154
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,412
the situation is very bad.

1155
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:48,507
This one's okay... There's one
right here... yeah...

1156
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,885
John Wayne, he's the best!

1157
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,303
Please, he's a fascist!

1158
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:54,054
Who else can face 20 guys...

1159
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,681
armed to the teeth...

1160
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,767
and anxious to kill him,

1161
01:13:57,809 --> 01:13:59,811
and he escapes, riding his horse
in reverse?

1162
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,687
An yet, make you believe
that he was...

1163
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,397
the most dangerous guy?
He could be drunk,

1164
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:05,275
beaten up, defeated,
in love... But...

1165
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,942
he never lost his dignity!

1166
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,402
I can't believe he
likes westerns.

1167
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,029
I like them too!

1168
01:14:10,155 --> 01:14:11,573
Of course! Good!

1169
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:12,949
This boy has to be...

1170
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,659
larger than life... The best!

1171
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,035
This place is expensive...

1172
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,204
If it's good, we'll go in,
don't look at the prices...

1173
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:20,581
I'm paying!

1174
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:22,542
You've been inviting all
day, Hans. It's enough...

1175
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,838
We go in... with
one condition. I pay.

1176
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:30,717
I'm not paying. It's my
friend Andrada who pays!

1177
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:37,598
Shall we have a drink?

1178
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,224
- Another one?
- One before last!

1179
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,185
- That's right...
- This time it's on me.

1180
01:14:41,186 --> 01:14:43,687
Okay... Is the bar open?

1181
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,105
Yes sir, all night.

1182
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,607
Room 406, please...

1183
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,108
Just one drink
and I'll go upstairs!

1184
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,111
Let's go?

1185
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:22,018
Hi... do you have cigarettes?

1186
01:15:33,905 --> 01:15:35,406
Thank you...

1187
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:45,542
Do you have...?

1188
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,010
- I'll be right back...
- Where are you going?

1189
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:59,806
You plan to carry on? It's four
o'clock in the morning...

1190
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:01,808
you both need some sleep...

1191
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,934
I'll take him to his room...

1192
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,647
Oh no, I can do that myself.

1193
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:17,031
- It's higher up...
- What?

1194
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,908
You're one floor short

1195
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:19,951
I'm missing one floor...

1196
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,577
I'll go with you...

1197
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:23,203
Where? That way?

1198
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,706
Okay!

1199
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,218
I'll be right back!

1200
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:39,721
And, who'll bring you back?

1201
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:42,473
I'll bring him back.
Don't worry...

1202
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:49,313
Fuck... you two are wasted...

1203
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:52,859
Country! Country!

1204
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:59,615
You know the one about the guy
who's completely wasted...

1205
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:02,493
goes to the Puerta del Sol,
and asks somebody...

1206
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:06,247
No! It was New Year's Eve,
and they were...

1207
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,625
eating grapes, in Madrid you
eat grapes with...

1208
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:12,628
well, it doesn't matter... This guy is
completely lost, and asks somebody...

1209
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:16,591
who's also lost! And he asks him...

1210
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:20,385
"Could you please tell
me where I am?"

1211
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:23,139
The other one says
"Hell, at the...

1212
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,141
Puerta del Sol".

1213
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:29,603
"No, no... The country!
Country!"

1214
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:32,523
Country! Country!

1215
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,779
Shh! We'll be kicked out...

1216
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:40,239
Go away, please.

1217
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,115
I'll be right back.

1218
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,369
I'd prefer you don't come back.
You got drunk together...

1219
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,495
then stick together!

1220
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:47,747
I can't stand drunks!

1221
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:49,791
One moment, one moment!

1222
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:54,503
You have no right
to talk to him like that...

1223
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:59,050
This is a great guy...
He's a frontiersman...

1224
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:03,679
Drunk or defeated, a
frontiersman...

1225
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,139
never loses his dignity...

1226
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:13,940
I mean it... I may be wasted...

1227
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:15,650
but I know what
I'm talking about.

1228
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,570
He's in a special class...

1229
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,783
and so are you...

1230
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,204
You're a terrific woman...

1231
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:37,463
Don't leave him alone... He
loves you very much...

1232
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,592
and so do I...

1233
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:48,725
I love you both... very much...

1234
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,236
I'm sleepy and hungry...

1235
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,530
We're almost there... There're
some cookies in my bag.

1236
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,051
Wake up... driving
alone is very boring

1237
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,659
copilots are supposed to talk

1238
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,288
and those two are
definitely out.

1239
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,165
Did you ever get drunk?

1240
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,502
I can't. Whenever I drink
too much, I get sick,

1241
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:59,503
I throw up and then
I fall asleep.

1242
01:19:59,504 --> 01:20:01,672
I always miss all the fun.

1243
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:03,256
Why is it fun?

1244
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,635
Sometimes it is.
If you get depressed,

1245
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,177
it can be worse...

1246
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:10,056
You lose control. You say and

1247
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:12,683
do things you normally wouldn't.
Like the light in the rocks,

1248
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,937
it shows you the dark
side of people.

1249
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:18,439
It can be sickening, but

1250
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,066
it can also be wonderful.

1251
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:22,068
You'll find out by yourself.

1252
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,195
I don't like to drink.

1253
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,321
You will. You're
still too young.

1254
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,325
The laws of genetics
never fail...

1255
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,953
and that thing behind you
is your father.

1256
01:20:58,104 --> 01:20:59,980
I have to see the
doctor. It's an emergency!

1257
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,064
Anything wrong?

1258
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,107
No, what could go wrong?

1259
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:03,108
But I have to see her!

1260
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:04,192
What's going on?

1261
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:05,236
Doctor, please, can you...

1262
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:06,320
take me into the town?

1263
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:07,864
I'm busy don Gregorio...

1264
01:21:07,989 --> 01:21:09,990
When you're finished,
could you take me?

1265
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:11,616
No problem! You're
looking very handsome,

1266
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,702
are you going to a party?

1267
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:14,579
I sold the ranch, doctor!

1268
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:16,873
I have to sign the papers.

1269
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:19,583
Andrada's friend bought it.
The one from the capital.

1270
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:21,001
The one that bought Juan's...

1271
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,085
Yeah, that same guy!

1272
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,254
You'll have to wait a while.

1273
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:27,884
I sold the ranch, I'm going to
live in the capital!

1274
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,770
Forgive us, your Highness...

1275
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:41,980
for interrupting your
deep meditation...

1276
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:44,400
but we have brought the vaccines
for your loyal subjects!

1277
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:47,611
What are you doing here?
Aren't you cold?

1278
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:49,654
How did it go? Did
you get the vaccines...

1279
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:50,780
without any problems?

1280
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,242
No problems, because I
also went.

1281
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:55,619
- With Hans?
- And Mario and Ernesto...

1282
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,495
we had a great time...

1283
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,165
I can imagine.

1284
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:02,418
What a temper!
What's the matter?

1285
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:06,923
Look...

1286
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:08,799
I've been promoted.

1287
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,887
They're sending me to a course
in Rome for a full year...

1288
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,179
then to Buenos Aires...

1289
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,181
to instruct novices.

1290
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,184
Can't you refuse?

1291
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:22,188
I'm a nun, Ana... I made
a vow of obedience.

1292
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:26,150
Take the vaccines, Ernesto.

1293
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:28,653
Leave them in the sacristy!

1294
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,697
Or behind the altar...
you know where, don't you?

1295
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:33,699
Yeah...

1296
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:39,166
You know when you're leaving?
Did they tell you?

1297
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:43,417
No, I don't know.
Maybe in a month or two...

1298
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,670
when my replacement arrives.

1299
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,713
A stiff who'll wear
the habit everywhere...

1300
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:49,840
even to sleep.

1301
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:51,968
If you quit, you could stay.

1302
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:55,845
I'd love to. But I can't.

1303
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,348
You will...

1304
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,475
Leave it to me!

1305
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,478
They don't like what
I'm doing...

1306
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,729
They never did, but
the priest's report...

1307
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:08,483
was decisive. That son
of a bitch says I'm...

1308
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,988
an anarchist, an
anticlerical apostate.

1309
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,198
Except pretty, everything...

1310
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,242
Wrong, you are pretty.

1311
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:19,119
But he's right about
everything else.

1312
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,246
If you weren't a nun
it wouldn't bother you...

1313
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,748
it would be a compliment.

1314
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:33,633
Where are you going gaucho?
Are you lost?

1315
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,719
I'm coming to see Mr. Zamora,

1316
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:37,887
to tell him vaccination is on
tomorrow at the chapel

1317
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,099
I think he left early.

1318
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:43,101
I'll find somebody.
I'll leave a message.

1319
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,979
Bye!

1320
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:44,037
This time I did them all.
As you said...

1321
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:46,832
I get up and study when
they're all asleep.

1322
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:50,711
Can you check them to
see if they're correct?

1323
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:04,599
Very good... You're doing
well, Luciana

1324
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,936
I don't know why I never taught
before, but I think soon...

1325
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,436
you'll be able to read
and write...

1326
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,188
whatever you want.

1327
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:11,606
How would I know when
this happens?

1328
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,359
You'll be able to read
and write!

1329
01:25:13,484 --> 01:25:16,487
I know, you fool! I mean if
I'll see you...

1330
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,113
If you'll keep coming here.

1331
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:20,365
- If you want, yes!
- Okay.

1332
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,867
Shall I read now?

1333
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:24,870
Okay.

1334
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:40,136
"Buck learned to take off..."

1335
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:49,854
with his teeth the
ice... that... acc-u-mu-lated".

1336
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:50,895
Lu...

1337
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,355
Am I doing it wrong?

1338
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:54,358
I think I love you.

1339
01:25:57,486 --> 01:26:00,280
You better go, it's late.

1340
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:01,740
Why are you upset?

1341
01:26:01,866 --> 01:26:03,284
I'm not.

1342
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,160
Then what's wrong?

1343
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:07,496
I know you won't
come here anymore!

1344
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:11,749
Why do you say that?
I said I would.

1345
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,670
I know you said it,
but you won't

1346
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,921
you'll leave...

1347
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:17,381
Where will I go?

1348
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:20,550
I know you'll leave...
You'll go back to the capital.

1349
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:24,053
Because you don't belong here,
you're from the capital...

1350
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:27,057
and people from the capital
always go away.

1351
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:39,945
Ernesto! Stop! Leave him alone!

1352
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,574
I'll show you, you whore!

1353
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,786
No, Dad! Leave him, please!

1354
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,539
Listen, kid, you're lucky
you're not getting...

1355
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,458
your ass kicked today. You'll
leave as you came...

1356
01:26:53,459 --> 01:26:55,293
but I don't want to see you
here again!

1357
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:56,711
Understood?

1358
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,588
If you feel like fucking,
get one of...

1359
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,799
your own people, not
my daughter,

1360
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:01,926
understand?

1361
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:05,095
Now get out of here...

1362
01:27:10,059 --> 01:27:12,228
Beat it, you little shit!

1363
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,976
Ernesto, leave what you're doing...
and go with your father... hurry.

1364
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:54,728
- Where's he going?
- To speak with Andrada,

1365
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,145
don't let him get into trouble.

1366
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,273
To the ranch? But I'm
classifying...

1367
01:27:58,274 --> 01:27:59,524
my rocks!

1368
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,277
You can do that later. Hurry!

1369
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:13,622
- Hans is here!
- That's better...

1370
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:27,136
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1371
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,511
I'm coming with you!

1372
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,389
Why don't you go see Luciana?

1373
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:36,436
Hello Zamora, how are you doing?

1374
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:37,938
What do you want, professor?

1375
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:40,463
Just a little chat,
if it's possible.

1376
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,025
We have nothing to talk.

1377
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:43,819
I mean your boss.

1378
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,321
He has nothing to do with it...

1379
01:28:45,446 --> 01:28:47,448
I don't know what this
kid told you...

1380
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:49,032
but I don't want to argue
with you!

1381
01:28:49,033 --> 01:28:50,950
I meant what I said, I don't
want him around here.

1382
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:52,785
So take him away!

1383
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:54,329
You'll have to see him
for a while...

1384
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:57,583
he came with me and he's not leaving,
is that clear, Zamora?

1385
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:04,715
Unless you want to
kick us both out.

1386
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:08,802
I want to talk with your boss.
And I don't want to...

1387
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,471
argue with you either.

1388
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:19,730
Sounds like this time you
really screwed up.

1389
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:22,358
I promise I didn't
do anything. Let me explain.

1390
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,109
Not now... We'll talk at home.

1391
01:29:29,865 --> 01:29:31,491
Don't touch anything, boy...

1392
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,702
Drink it slowly, it's
prime stuff.

1393
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,996
I can't taste whisky...

1394
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:38,206
the local one would've
tasted the same to me.

1395
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,249
Before we start haggling,
let me tell you that...

1396
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,252
the price went down.
It's the market.

1397
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:45,588
Bad luck. But I didn't
come to talk about wool.

1398
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,965
What's going on with
the land, Andrada?

1399
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:50,135
You're buying everything...

1400
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,886
Old Gregorio's, Juan's,

1401
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,262
Eliseo's...

1402
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,474
They say there are more.
The land is useless.

1403
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:57,851
What do you want it for?

1404
01:29:58,268 --> 01:30:00,020
I haven't bought anything.

1405
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:01,522
Don't bullshit me, Andrada.

1406
01:30:02,523 --> 01:30:04,649
Leave us alone for a moment,
boy. Go and play.

1407
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:05,983
Stay, Ernesto.

1408
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,026
Kids talk too much.

1409
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,653
He's not a kid anymore!

1410
01:30:08,654 --> 01:30:10,655
I won't say anything
he can't hear,

1411
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:11,740
will you?

1412
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:13,908
I don't know what
you're after...

1413
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,660
or why you stick you're
nose in my business.

1414
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:17,412
I care about my people
not getting screwed!

1415
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:18,789
Nobody's screwing anybody!

1416
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,417
You lefties always think...

1417
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,043
all businessmen are crooks.

1418
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,420
Surplus value... Explain to
him the concept of...

1419
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:27,046
surplus value.

1420
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:29,298
He already knows it.
He thrives on it.

1421
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:30,699
And through buying
the worst land...

1422
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:31,801
in the province.

1423
01:30:31,802 --> 01:30:34,513
Let's talk seriously, professor.

1424
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:36,806
A client from Buenos Aires...

1425
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:38,391
wants some land to build...

1426
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:40,143
a country club, with a pool
and everything.

1427
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:42,145
Weekend tourism.
What's wrong with that?

1428
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:43,396
That I don't believe you.

1429
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:44,647
That's you're problem.

1430
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,065
This is bullshit.

1431
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:48,569
- What?
- It's bullshit!

1432
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:50,904
A hydroelectric complex, a dam.

1433
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:52,781
Remember the blueprints
I showed you?

1434
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:55,199
An old project that
was abandoned...

1435
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,909
to be built now with
Spanish capital.

1436
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,078
That's why I'm here.
Neither oil nor country club...

1437
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,455
shit!

1438
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:01,832
You won't last long here!

1439
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,958
Your contract expressly
states that...

1440
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:05,334
you can't talk about
the project!

1441
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:07,086
Oh shit! It's true, I forgot.

1442
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,547
Whatever made them put that?
To buy time...

1443
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,299
to purchase this shitty land...

1444
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,842
which will go under water?

1445
01:31:12,843 --> 01:31:14,303
You're going to far,
you fucking...

1446
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:15,846
Careful, there are
children here.

1447
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:18,223
Where's the profit? In
the expropriation?

1448
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:19,933
The government must
expropriate...

1449
01:31:20,058 --> 01:31:22,560
those lands, but they'll
pay much more...

1450
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:24,228
than what my friend has paid...

1451
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:25,480
for them.

1452
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:26,939
- Who knows...
- So you weren't...

1453
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:27,982
screwing anybody, eh?

1454
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:30,736
Nobody! Everything is
absolutely legal.

1455
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:32,862
If you don't believe me,
go and report me...

1456
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:35,239
they sell, I buy...

1457
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,493
I'm not screwing anybody!

1458
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:39,495
I'm risking money to
make a good deal...

1459
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,997
if it goes wrong, I'll lose!

1460
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:49,630
I don't know if you've
already bought everything...

1461
01:31:49,755 --> 01:31:52,215
but I'll talk to the people,

1462
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:54,718
so that you don't
risk any more money.

1463
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:56,386
Talk to them, and
see what happens...

1464
01:31:56,512 --> 01:31:58,596
tell them not to sell,
to wait for...

1465
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:01,140
the expropriation. Tell them the
project is 30 years old...

1466
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,642
and for some reason...

1467
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:04,227
it was never built.
But now it's on.

1468
01:32:04,228 --> 01:32:06,668
A decree may come out tomorrow
and everything will be stopped!

1469
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:09,273
But it's okay. Go tell
them to wait.

1470
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:11,485
Maybe the government
will pay them in bonds...

1471
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:13,486
or in installments.

1472
01:32:13,487 --> 01:32:15,655
I'll come with you. I'll
put the cash on the table...

1473
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:17,741
and we'll see who
they'll listen to!

1474
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:18,867
It'll cost you more.

1475
01:32:18,909 --> 01:32:20,869
I've got reserves, they don't.

1476
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:23,371
They're starving now! Today!

1477
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:27,041
But it's okay, go tell
them to wait.

1478
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:30,254
I'll tell them.

1479
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:33,048
You're still living in a
utopian world, professor.

1480
01:32:34,675 --> 01:32:36,051
I'll also tell them...

1481
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:38,053
what a son of a bitch you are.

1482
01:32:52,651 --> 01:32:54,569
I don't know why, but
I think we're not...

1483
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,404
going to be welcomed in
this house anymore.

1484
01:32:56,405 --> 01:32:57,656
So you knew this all along.

1485
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:58,781
You could've told me!

1486
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:00,032
What for? He would've fired me.

1487
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:02,076
I'm a geologist not
Jesus Christ.

1488
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,578
I was hired for a job and
I did it.

1489
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:04,913
The rest is none of my business.

1490
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:07,081
- Okay!
- You're not even a landowner...

1491
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,791
why should I tell you?
Andrada's right...

1492
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:09,793
you can't do anything!

1493
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:11,085
- No?
- No!

1494
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,212
This is south of the Rio Grande, don't
you understand!

1495
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:14,297
And I live in Utopia!

1496
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,590
Listen here...

1497
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:17,341
- I'm a mercenary...
- You said a geologist

1498
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:19,093
I go where they pay me.
And the multinationals pay...

1499
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,970
better than anyone.
If you behave of course!

1500
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,973
If you don't, you
better do something else!

1501
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,224
But now everything's changed.

1502
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:25,474
Nothing has changed!

1503
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,476
You opened your mouth right
in front of Andrada...

1504
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:29,062
Is that behaving well?

1505
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:31,857
Anybody can have a bad day.

1506
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,372
Everything's going to
hell, Ernie.

1507
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:16,610
Okay, run along...

1508
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,515
They're waiting to
talk with you.

1509
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:49,685
- Where?
- In the barn.

1510
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,947
Meetings are meant
for speaking out...

1511
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:05,075
Who wants to be the first one?

1512
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:11,163
Things look bad, don Mario.

1513
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:13,041
We have to sell.

1514
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:16,169
People can't hold on.
We've got nothing.

1515
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:19,214
There's little left, but
it's still something.

1516
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,049
We can last a few more days.

1517
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:23,551
We don't want to starve...

1518
01:35:23,552 --> 01:35:26,054
that's why we made
the Cooperative.

1519
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:28,472
Not only for that. Remember
when each one was on his own?

1520
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:29,974
What happened?

1521
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:33,227
"Yes, sir", "Yes, boss",
and get screwed...

1522
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,980
you bought everything at
Andrada's store...

1523
01:35:35,105 --> 01:35:36,814
paid what he said...

1524
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,066
you couldn't pay, so he
remained a creditor...

1525
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,609
and held you by your balls!

1526
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,361
Until you got together.

1527
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:44,363
What did we start with?

1528
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:46,116
We had nothing!

1529
01:35:46,241 --> 01:35:48,868
What did we do?

1530
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:51,121
Instead of each one eating
up his own,

1531
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:53,247
we distributed everything.

1532
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:55,250
It took us six months to buy...

1533
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,502
from wholesalers, but
we managed.

1534
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,128
We weren't full,

1535
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:00,338
but we weren't hungry either.

1536
01:36:01,006 --> 01:36:02,716
Why can't we do the same now?

1537
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:05,844
We can, but the situation
has changed.

1538
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,471
Now we have the wool,
and we can sell it.

1539
01:36:08,472 --> 01:36:11,766
If we get less, bad luck.

1540
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,350
We can manage anyway.

1541
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,103
I think we're about to win.

1542
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:16,520
And we shouldn't give up now!

1543
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:20,233
But that's my opinion.
Let the majority decide.

1544
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,402
Mr. Andrada says that if
we don't sell now,

1545
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:24,612
later he won't buy.

1546
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:26,280
He called and told us.

1547
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:28,240
So now you call him
"mister" again...

1548
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:30,409
You saw him?

1549
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,038
I wanted to know.
I've been asking...

1550
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:34,663
and everybody agrees,
don Mario...

1551
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,374
except you.

1552
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:38,918
Have you talked to Nelda?

1553
01:36:38,919 --> 01:36:41,671
Sister doesn't agree, but she
says she's leaving.

1554
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:44,548
We'll be staying here.

1555
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:47,302
I'm also staying, and I
don't agree...

1556
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,804
Andrada wants to
stick it to us...

1557
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:51,264
I don't agree.

1558
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:53,557
If you let him win now,
he'll always win.

1559
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:54,892
That's what I think!

1560
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:56,936
That's what you thought...

1561
01:36:56,937 --> 01:36:58,939
until a few days ago.

1562
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,819
Am I mistaken, or have you
already said yes?

1563
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,801
I think she'll give birth
any minute now...

1564
01:37:28,802 --> 01:37:30,427
her water's broken...
Don't worry Elsa...

1565
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:31,971
How often do you get the pains?

1566
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:32,972
Very often.

1567
01:37:32,973 --> 01:37:34,974
Put her in the ambulance!

1568
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:37,811
Bring my things, Ernesto,
and tell Dad to come.

1569
01:37:37,936 --> 01:37:39,061
He's at the meeting!

1570
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:40,229
Tell him it's urgent!

1571
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,230
I'll take you.

1572
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:42,440
Nelda, will you manage alone?

1573
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:44,985
Sure. Good luck.

1574
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:04,379
Dad...

1575
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:17,392
Dad!

1576
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:19,144
What are you doing here?
Go inside!

1577
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,109
Where are you going?
What happened?

1578
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:28,903
Nothing! I'll go and see if
Nelda needs help.

1579
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:30,780
You go inside! I'll be
right back!

1580
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,036
Stay there! Don't come
any closer!

1581
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:33,593
Don't be afraid, Ernie,
I'm not crazy.

1582
01:39:35,095 --> 01:39:37,180
Someday you'll understand.

1583
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:51,861
Now they'll have to start
all over again.

1584
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,506
They won't have a damn
thing to lose.

1585
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,389
- Mom, last night...
- I know...

1586
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:05,184
Nelda told me everything...
Where's your father?

1587
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:06,936
Inside, in the bedroom.

1588
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,064
And the kids? No school today?

1589
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:12,400
No, I gave them a meal
and sent them home.

1590
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,077
Thanks for everything.

1591
01:41:23,578 --> 01:41:26,206
It wasn't your fault, okay?

1592
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:43,306
What happened? Did you get
on time?

1593
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:47,685
The boy was dead at birth.
Go on with your mother...

1594
01:41:47,811 --> 01:41:49,104
don't leave her alone.

1595
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:55,670
Careful! You'll break it!

1596
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:58,298
It's fragile!

1597
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,300
Can you please hurry up?

1598
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:02,886
Be careful, it fragile!

1599
01:43:27,285 --> 01:43:31,539
VALLE BERMEJO HYDROELECTRIC
PROJECT

1600
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,114
I'll deliver certificates
to those...

1601
01:44:06,115 --> 01:44:07,742
who finished seventh grade.

1602
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:10,118
In fact, nobody deserves it...

1603
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:13,997
No, seriously. Each one
of you...

1604
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,500
tried the best you could.

1605
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,127
Whether you learned a lot or
not, it doesn't matter...

1606
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:21,381
you learned to think and
share experiences.

1607
01:44:21,506 --> 01:44:23,383
That's what counts.
Here, Esteban...

1608
01:44:24,467 --> 01:44:26,385
Don't lose your certificates,
you'll need them...

1609
01:44:26,386 --> 01:44:28,095
to get jobs at the dam.

1610
01:44:28,096 --> 01:44:29,388
They'll pay you a bit more.

1611
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:31,641
Not much more, just a little.
Here, Rita.

1612
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:36,895
Roque, congratulations.
Same to you, Jorge...

1613
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:38,898
Look after yourselves!

1614
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:42,150
Keep coming when school is over.

1615
01:44:42,151 --> 01:44:43,778
The lunchroom is open
all summer.

1616
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:44,988
Now you know.

1617
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,054
Come Ernie!

1618
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:18,938
Sit down...

1619
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,826
We were talking with Mom
about you...

1620
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:34,661
and school, and what will
happen now...

1621
01:45:34,662 --> 01:45:36,831
and all that.

1622
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:39,541
You still have a year
to go before...

1623
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:40,918
high school, but...

1624
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:43,295
it would be better if we

1625
01:45:43,296 --> 01:45:44,589
made plans now.

1626
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:47,675
You really like rocks?

1627
01:45:47,717 --> 01:45:49,969
Do you want to study geology?

1628
01:45:50,053 --> 01:45:52,346
I like it, sure...
I'd also like...

1629
01:45:52,347 --> 01:45:53,347
to be a teacher.

1630
01:45:53,348 --> 01:45:54,431
Either way,

1631
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,474
you have to study.

1632
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:56,475
That's what I don't like.

1633
01:45:56,476 --> 01:45:58,727
You don't like to be
bossed around, do you?

1634
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:00,688
The more you know, the less
orders you'll receive.

1635
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:04,733
There's a high school in San Luis
but it's too far...

1636
01:46:04,734 --> 01:46:06,361
you can't go and come
back every day...

1637
01:46:08,613 --> 01:46:11,324
and you're not staying at a hostel.
You're too young.

1638
01:46:11,366 --> 01:46:13,825
I can stay there during the week!
I'll travel every weekend.

1639
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:15,118
You'd have to live with priests.

1640
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,996
No, thanks.

1641
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:23,085
The best is for you to
go to Buenos Aires...

1642
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:26,506
finish elementary school where
you can carry on...

1643
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,590
into high school.

1644
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:31,218
So you won't have to change.

1645
01:46:31,219 --> 01:46:32,969
Am I going alone to
Buenos Aires?

1646
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:37,975
With Mom. As soon
as school is over.

1647
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:43,021
You'll stay at your
Grandma's until...

1648
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:45,899
Mom finds a job and can
rent something.

1649
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,860
Aren't you coming?

1650
01:46:52,365 --> 01:46:54,033
I can't, Ernie...

1651
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:05,795
I can't leave all this.

1652
01:47:11,426 --> 01:47:15,805
When you find your own place...
you can't leave it.

1653
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,435
We'll still see each other
often, anyway.

1654
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,562
Once a month or more often.

1655
01:47:24,313 --> 01:47:27,775
Either I travel or you
two come over.

1656
01:47:27,817 --> 01:47:29,527
You won't miss me.

1657
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:32,780
I don't want to go.

1658
01:47:37,952 --> 01:47:41,414
I know... I know.

1659
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:49,589
Come on. Go put the flag away.

1660
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,734
Zamora's daughter gave
me this for you.

1661
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:19,322
I'm sorry... Come on,
give me a hand.

1662
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:24,994
If you were older, we'd...

1663
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:27,495
go for a few drinks and
end up crying...

1664
01:50:27,496 --> 01:50:29,706
under a table for the...

1665
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:31,250
women we've lost.

1666
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:34,628
Don't worry. Someone once said that
what's important is to love...

1667
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:37,005
and not be loved. Whoever
said that is a...

1668
01:50:37,006 --> 01:50:38,632
stupid jerk!

1669
01:50:38,633 --> 01:50:40,343
What bothers me is that
there's no...

1670
01:50:40,468 --> 01:50:42,844
chance of saying "perhaps..."

1671
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:44,639
I'm mistaken"... But no,

1672
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:47,891
It's always been the same. Here,
Spain, everywhere.

1673
01:50:47,892 --> 01:50:50,978
How long will they take?

1674
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:53,522
Five years? Let's say seven.

1675
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:57,234
Seven years of good life,
good salary, new house...

1676
01:50:57,276 --> 01:51:00,529
food. And then what? Who makes
them return?

1677
01:51:00,655 --> 01:51:02,907
When the dam's finished...

1678
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:04,908
who can tell them to go back
to sheep,

1679
01:51:04,909 --> 01:51:07,285
the vegetable garden, the
harvest?

1680
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:09,914
No, they can't go back.

1681
01:51:10,039 --> 01:51:12,124
The place that was theirs
doesn't exist anymore.

1682
01:51:13,167 --> 01:51:15,043
They'll end up scraping by
in Buenos Aires...

1683
01:51:15,044 --> 01:51:16,378
living in the slums.

1684
01:51:16,379 --> 01:51:17,922
Don't complain.

1685
01:51:18,047 --> 01:51:20,423
In seven years time
there'll be...

1686
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:22,550
a lot more people ready
to fight for "the cause".

1687
01:51:22,551 --> 01:51:24,053
You're still in
Utopia, Spaniard.

1688
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:25,554
You need a solid drink.

1689
01:51:25,638 --> 01:51:27,306
No, no... I'm about
to talk bullshit.

1690
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:29,057
Nobody could tell
the difference.

1691
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:30,642
You would, because I
get horny...

1692
01:51:30,643 --> 01:51:32,019
and go after virgins.

1693
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:33,561
Thank God! I was afraid
you would...

1694
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:35,022
go after nuns.

1695
01:51:35,815 --> 01:51:38,150
When does the train
arrive, Ernesto?

1696
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:39,943
Nine thirty and it leaves at 10:00.

1697
01:51:39,944 --> 01:51:41,903
Well, don't go to the station.
You already have...

1698
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:43,656
a client. Come to the hotel
around eight.

1699
01:51:43,698 --> 01:51:45,949
- Where are we going?
- I'm going to Madrid.

1700
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:47,951
Are you leaving?
And now you tell us?

1701
01:51:47,952 --> 01:51:49,286
Did you finish your work?

1702
01:51:49,412 --> 01:51:51,162
Not yet, but they preferred to...

1703
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:52,580
pay me now and send me home...

1704
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:54,416
I was becoming a bother...

1705
01:51:54,417 --> 01:51:55,960
screwing things up.

1706
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:00,464
If the military return,
here's your home.

1707
01:52:00,548 --> 01:52:02,924
If not, it's still your home.
Come around...

1708
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,593
some time.

1709
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:07,303
I'll be near.

1710
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:08,681
Only two hours on a plane.

1711
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:10,557
A weekend with me, and...

1712
01:52:10,558 --> 01:52:12,435
your Sister Superior won't
even recognize you.

1713
01:52:13,561 --> 01:52:14,937
We'll write you.

1714
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,608
Sure, let me know how
things are going...

1715
01:52:19,734 --> 01:52:21,359
I won't promise I'll answer...

1716
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,736
I'm terrible for those things.

1717
01:52:22,737 --> 01:52:24,071
Come on Spaniard, a few lines!

1718
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:25,864
The address is easy
Mario Dominici,

1719
01:52:25,865 --> 01:52:27,992
Valle Bermejo, San Luis,
and that's it.

1720
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:33,247
Bye Spaniard, take care.

1721
01:52:33,748 --> 01:52:37,000
You too professor, and don't

1722
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:38,627
quarrel too much!

1723
01:52:38,753 --> 01:52:40,629
Oh, no, you all stay here.

1724
01:52:42,381 --> 01:52:44,884
I want to remember you
as you are...

1725
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:47,636
and not outside waving
goodbye like fools,

1726
01:52:50,014 --> 01:52:53,475
Sister, it'll be tough
but try to forget me.

1727
01:52:53,476 --> 01:52:56,896
It's been a pleasure
knowing you...

1728
01:52:57,897 --> 01:53:00,523
and I hope the next time
we see each other...

1729
01:53:00,524 --> 01:53:02,610
the pleasure will be
much greater.

1730
01:53:02,735 --> 01:53:05,653
Bye, you crazy fool. Good luck,
have a good trip.

1731
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:08,782
When we meet again,
you'll have to...

1732
01:53:08,783 --> 01:53:10,534
keep all your promises.

1733
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,411
I'll try my best.

1734
01:53:20,795 --> 01:53:23,255
Madame...

1735
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,677
with all due respect.

1736
01:53:52,326 --> 01:53:54,203
This is my Grandma's address
in Buenos Aires...

1737
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:55,538
you can write us there.

1738
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:00,709
It won't be necessary.

1739
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:31,574
Why did you give him
Grandma's address?

1740
01:54:33,117 --> 01:54:35,326
He doesn't know her.

1741
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:37,204
Aren't we going?

1742
01:54:39,248 --> 01:54:40,748
No...

1743
01:54:40,749 --> 01:54:42,501
What about my school?

1744
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:46,129
I don't know... We still have
a year to think about it.

1745
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:48,132
We might convince your father...

1746
01:54:48,257 --> 01:54:50,509
and we'll go together.

1747
01:54:53,846 --> 01:54:56,139
Anybody wants coffee?
It's still hot...

1748
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:57,766
- No, thanks...
- Not for me.

1749
01:54:58,851 --> 01:55:00,644
I think I'll take a stiff one.

1750
01:55:00,728 --> 01:55:02,771
- So will I...
- Same here.

1751
01:55:04,273 --> 01:55:06,275
Can I try?

1752
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:10,404
Just a little shot!

1753
01:55:54,073 --> 01:55:55,073
Please, sir!

1754
01:55:55,074 --> 01:55:56,700
Keep the line.
To register you have to

1755
01:55:56,784 --> 01:55:58,201
wait in line, but you're
too young...

1756
01:55:58,202 --> 01:55:59,702
I don't think they'll
give you a job.

1757
01:55:59,703 --> 01:56:01,788
I'm not looking for a job. I've
come to see Hans...

1758
01:56:01,789 --> 01:56:03,081
Mayer Plaza...

1759
01:56:03,082 --> 01:56:04,958
Room 13, to the right.

1760
01:56:04,959 --> 01:56:06,794
Thanks...

1761
01:56:16,971 --> 01:56:20,098
Ready. Am I leaving something behind?
Of course I am...

1762
01:56:20,099 --> 01:56:21,725
in every hotel,

1763
01:56:21,850 --> 01:56:23,352
I leave something.

1764
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:25,437
You're leaving the light.

1765
01:56:31,986 --> 01:56:34,696
This is for you. Take it!

1766
01:56:34,697 --> 01:56:37,699
If the battery runs out,
plug it to a 220.

1767
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:41,370
And remember, never
aim at the eyes.

1768
01:56:41,453 --> 01:56:44,707
Let's go...

1769
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:46,374
Aren't we taking the bags?

1770
01:56:46,375 --> 01:56:47,875
Let them do that. Let's go.

1771
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:49,752
- What am I taking?
- You're taking me, dammit!

1772
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:51,463
Aren't you?

1773
01:56:53,007 --> 01:56:54,008
Let's go...

1774
01:57:03,142 --> 01:57:06,020
Let's go, Dumas! Go!

1775
01:57:13,027 --> 01:57:15,529
Go Dumas!

1776
01:57:22,786 --> 01:57:25,622
- Go, Dumas!
- Go Dumas!

1777
01:57:43,766 --> 01:57:46,935
What a shit head!

1778
01:57:53,317 --> 01:57:55,569
- Go!
- Go, Dumas!

1779
01:57:58,530 --> 01:58:00,532
Go Dumas, go!

1780
01:58:26,225 --> 01:58:27,976
Give me five!

1781
01:58:55,087 --> 01:58:58,006
Faster Dumas! Go! This
is the last one!

1782
01:59:04,012 --> 01:59:06,014
One last favor. Don't wait
for the train...

1783
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:07,265
to leave, okay?

1784
01:59:07,266 --> 01:59:10,894
Okay. Thanks for the light.

1785
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:15,899
Thank you for the trip.
Goodbye, kid.

1786
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:19,153
Goodbye.

1787
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:44,428
Hans is somewhere in
the States, in Texas...

1788
01:59:44,553 --> 01:59:49,557
or he was, although he felt
like staying for good.

1789
01:59:49,558 --> 01:59:51,810
That's what he said
when he sent...

1790
01:59:51,935 --> 01:59:54,938
the last postcard, a couple
of years ago.

1791
01:59:57,774 --> 01:59:59,442
As soon as we got to
Buenos Aires, Mom...

1792
01:59:59,443 --> 02:00:01,528
found a job at a hospital.

1793
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:05,281
She overworks, and we hardly
see each other.

1794
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:07,451
It's not the money.
I also work...

1795
02:00:07,576 --> 02:00:09,578
and we manage.

1796
02:00:10,579 --> 02:00:12,289
It seems she doesn't want
to have time...

1797
02:00:12,331 --> 02:00:14,208
to think.

1798
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:17,961
She still can't believe that
you're not around.

1799
02:00:19,338 --> 02:00:21,547
She talks about you with
certain anger...

1800
02:00:21,548 --> 02:00:23,228
as if the heart attack
had been your fault.

1801
02:00:27,054 --> 02:00:28,847
I also feel angry sometimes...

1802
02:00:28,931 --> 02:00:31,850
because I can't talk to you.

1803
02:00:34,353 --> 02:00:36,313
Sometimes we really need
you a lot, old man.

1804
02:00:42,486 --> 02:00:44,570
After you passed away,
in ten days we sold...

1805
02:00:44,571 --> 02:00:47,241
what little we had left, and
moved to Buenos Aires.

1806
02:00:48,116 --> 02:00:50,201
I finished elementary at
a school that also had...

1807
02:00:50,202 --> 02:00:53,622
high school, just the
way you wanted.

1808
02:00:54,748 --> 02:00:57,251
I still keep the rocks,
but that's not...

1809
02:00:57,376 --> 02:01:00,504
what I chose. I went
for medicine.

1810
02:01:02,256 --> 02:01:04,258
I'm in my third year, and I just
won a scholarship.

1811
02:01:04,341 --> 02:01:07,635
I'm going to Spain.

1812
02:01:07,636 --> 02:01:10,096
I don't know what I'll do...

1813
02:01:10,097 --> 02:01:13,100
when the scholarship's over.
I can look for a job in Europe...

1814
02:01:13,141 --> 02:01:15,768
or return to Buenos Aires...

1815
02:01:15,769 --> 02:01:17,896
if things get better.

1816
02:01:19,231 --> 02:01:20,911
I'd like you to tell me
how can one know...

1817
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:23,610
where his place is.

1818
02:01:24,528 --> 02:01:26,238
I haven't found mine yet.

1819
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:29,240
I figure I'll realize it
when I'm...

1820
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:31,118
in a place from which I can
no longer leave.

1821
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,871
I suppose that's how it is.

1822
02:01:34,913 --> 02:01:37,040
It'll show up one day.

1823
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:40,502
I still have time to find it.
