Hey, Hula. Happy Saturday.

981
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:46,999
- Hey.
- Are your parents home?

982
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,107
Wanted to thank them
for the other night.

983
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,437
They're not home.

984
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:52,477
I am stuck babysitting the baby.

985
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,314
- Shut up.
- Hey, baby.

986
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,587
I'm kidding. Can I leave a note?

987
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:01,346
- <font color="#804040">GRACE</font>: Of course. Come in.
- Okay.

989
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:05,188
Some footage that I shot.

990

- You shot this?
- Mm-hm.

991
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,418
Wow.

992

00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:29,975
It seems very sophisticated.

996
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,449
This is a big covert operation.

997

I bet the whole
Pacific is in play.

- Come on. It's Saturday. Don't do this.

1005
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,707
I'm sorry to disturb
your Saturday.

1006
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,010
I got Troy and Melissa here. I
got a girlfriends kid, Don.

1007
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,845
Have you met a baby named Don?

1008
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,148
No, sir. Hi, Don.

1009
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:11,087
Come on. This feels more
like a Monday kind of thing.

1010
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,921
- Tell me everything you know.
- I don't know what's going on up there.

1011
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:19,032
It's not an Air Force launch. They let
me know what they want me to know.

1012
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,169
Private money's running the
whole thing. We work for them.

This is the new
military, captain.

1014
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,402
Kesha could launch a satellite.

1015
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,873
She doesn't have to tell us what's
on it either. No treaty for that.

1016
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,742
This one looks like a dual-purpose
launch vehicle that will amp up...

1017
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,781
a worldwide rush to fill
the skies with weapons.

1018
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,419
I didn't get the memo on that. We
don't know what's on this launch.

1019
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,089
If that's true, we're in worse
trouble than I thought.

1020
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:45,522
Don't resign, all right? You'd have
better luck talking to privateers.

1021
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,695
Contractors are
running everything.

1022

Global One is running the
lead on this operation.

1023
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,567
- It's Carson Welch's rocket.
- Gilcrest?

How much does
Gilcrest know, sir?

sunglasses in the actual hat...

Really?

1455
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,884
"Dear Tracy."

1456
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:33,754
You asked me to speak my mind,
so here it is. My mind.

1457
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:37,686
Do not penalize me for not being
one of those flowery people...

1458
01:27:37,886 --> 01:27:41,595
"who shoot their feelings in a spray
like a fire hydrant on a summer day."

1459
01:27:42,124 --> 01:27:44,126
- No worry about that. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1460
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:46,566
I've never seen him do that.

1461
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:50,539
"I just hated the way you changed
when Gilcrest came back to town."

1462
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:55,079
But I don't like to hate.

1463
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:58,608
It's bad for my brain.

1464
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,148
Every night...

1465
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:07,290
when I come home, I start fresh.

1466
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:11,896
I don't bring what happens
up there down here.

1467
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:19,231
I may not be the original
owner of your heart...

1468
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:24,771
"but I am the better owner and
a much healthier option too!"

1469
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,135
Exclamation point there.

1470
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,679
Mom, there's a new
Santa outside.

1471
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:32,613
- Hi.
- Hi.

1472
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:45,356
I liked him a little
better when he was silent.

1473
01:28:45,587 --> 01:28:47,589
- Ha-ha-ha. But keep going.

1474
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,167
"You have no..."

1475
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:53,771
You have no idea the
fear you calm in me...

1476
01:28:53,962 --> 01:28:57,341

through that squeaky back door.

Well, anywhere you turn,
somebody's heart breaks.

1480
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,286
Well, come on.

1481
01:29:17,986 --> 01:29:21,729
You gotta take a big bite out of
your life. Your husband wrote that.

1482
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:23,959
Are you trying to
play matchmaker now?

1483
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:27,663
I was on the fence till the door
part, but that was the final blow.

1484
01:29:27,863 --> 01:29:30,867
- Oh, really?
- I didn't even hear that squeaky door.

1485
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:32,670
I think I...

1486
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,246
I just completely lack
that romantic gene.

1487

Whew. No, I messed that up.

side of your mega mess-ups in the past.
