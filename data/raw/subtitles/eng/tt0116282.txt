1
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,864
<i>And keep your retirement</i>

2
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,536
<i>And your so-called
social security</i>

3
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:31,460
<i>Big city, turn me loose
and set me free...</i>

4
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,017
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

5
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,352
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

6
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,478
Yeah.

7
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,813
Shep Proudfoot said...

8
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,066
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

9
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,902
Shep said 8:30.

10
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,153
We've been sitting here an hour.

11
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,905
He's peed three times already.

12
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,991
I'm sure sorry.
Shep told me 8:30.

13
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,201
It was a mix-up, I guess.

14
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,578
You got the car?

15
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,913
Yeah. You bet.

16
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,582
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

17
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,168
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

18
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,086
I'm Carl Showalter.

19
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,380
This is my associate,
Gaear Grimsrud.

20
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,882
Yeah. How you doing?

21
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,426
So, we all set
on this thing, then?

22
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,261
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

23
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,763
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,181
Shep vouched for you and all.

25
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,059
I got every confidence
here in you fellas.

26
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,066
I guess that's it, then.

27
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
Here are the keys.

28
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,568
No, that's not it, Jerry.

29
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:38,694
Huh?

30
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,113
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

31
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,783
Yeah, but the deal
was the car first,

32
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,161
then the 40,000, like as
if it was the ransom.

33
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,329
I thought Shep told you.

34
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,956
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

35
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,123
Well, okay...

36
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,376
Except that you were
gonna be here at 7:30.

37
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,044
Yeah, well,
that was a mix-up, then.

38
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,629
Yeah, you already said that.

39
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,299
Yeah, but it's not a whole
pay-in-advance deal.

40
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,512
See, I give you a brand-new
vehicle in advance, and then...

41
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,138
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

42
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,223
Okay.

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,392
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate.

44
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,476
I will say this, though.

45
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,270
What Shep told us didn't
make a whole lot of sense.

46
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,399
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

47
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,026
You want your own
wife kidnapped.

48
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,194
Yeah.

49
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,239
You...

50
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,199
My point is,

51
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,119
you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

52
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,039
I mean, you give us half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

53
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,457
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

54
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,709
It doesn't make any sense.

55
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,045
Okay, see, it's not
me paying the ransom.

56
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,007
The thing is,
my wife, she's wealthy.

57
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,800
Her dad, he's real well-off.

58
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,218
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

59
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,803
What kind of trouble you in,
Jerry?

60
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,640
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

61
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,142
See, I just need the money.

62
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,352
Now, her dad,
he's real well-off.

63
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,146
So, why don't you just
ask him for the money?

64
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,605
Or your fucking wife, you know?

65
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,065
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

66
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,400
Well...

67
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,236
It's all part of this...

68
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,865
They don't know I need it, see?

69
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,201
Okay, so there's that. And even
if they did, I wouldn't get it,

70
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,786
so there's that on top, then.

71
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,079
See, these are personal matters.

72
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,205
Personal matters?

73
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,208
Yeah, personal matters
that needn't...

74
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,169
Okay, Jerry.

75
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:22,298
You're tasking us to perform
this mission, but you won't...

76
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,841
You won't...

77
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,637
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

78
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,897
Hon?

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,649
Hi, hon! Welcome back!

80
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,568
How was Fargo?

81
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,320
Yeah, real good.

82
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,030
Dad's here.

83
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,619
<i>...leads the Badgers in
goal production with five this year.</i>

84
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,787
How you doing, Wade?

85
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,996
Yeah, pretty good.

86
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,081
What you watching there?

87
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,207
Gophers.

88
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,625
Who they playing?

89
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,751
Ooh!

90
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,093
Is he staying for supper, then?

91
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,928
Yeah. I think so.

92
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,596
- Dad?
- What?

93
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,972
Are you staying for supper?

94
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,182
Yeah.

95
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,941
May I be excused?

96
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,025
You done there?

97
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,527
Uh-huh. I'm going out.

98
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,362
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

99
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,613
Just McDonald's.

100
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,365
- Back at 9:30.
- Okay.

101
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,201
He just ate. He didn't finish.

102
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,870
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

103
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,455
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

104
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,207
It's okay, McDonald's?

105
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,084
What do you think they do there?

106
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,169
They don't drink milk
shakes, I assure you.

107
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,754
It's okay, Dad.

108
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,180
Wade, have you had
a chance to think about

109
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,807
that deal I was talking about,

110
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,559
those 40 acres there,
in Wayzata?

111
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,060
You told me about it.

112
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,020
Yeah, you said you'd
have to think about it.

113
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,564
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

114
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,567
It's a heck of a lot. What did you
say you were gonna put there?

115
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,943
A lot. It's a...

116
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,486
I know it's a lot.

117
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,696
I mean a parking lot.

118
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,824
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

119
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,742
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

120
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,829
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

121
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,581
- A lot of money.
- Yeah, but the difference...

122
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,833
I thought you were gonna
show it to Stan Grossman.

123
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,169
He passes on this stuff before
it gets kicked up to me.

124
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,796
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

125
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,882
I'm asking you here, Wade.

126
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,178
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

127
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,055
Jean and Scotty
never have to worry.

128
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,822
Where is Pancakes House?

129
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,116
What?

130
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,285
We stop at Pancakes House.

131
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,080
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

132
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,790
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

133
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,417
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

134
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,961
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

135
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,968
Oh, come on, man.

136
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,305
Okay. Here's an idea.

137
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,057
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

138
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,434
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

139
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,436
I'm fucking
hungry now, you know.

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,232
Yeah, yeah, Jesus. I'm saying
we can stop, get pancakes,

141
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,734
and then we'll get laid, all right?

142
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,994
<i>Lou Diamond, line one.</i>

143
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,082
We sat right here in this room

144
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,583
and went over
this and over this.

145
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,751
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

146
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,754
I sat right here and said I
didn't want any TruCoat.

147
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,798
Yeah, but I'm saying
that TruCoat.

148
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,925
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

149
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,510
It'll cost you a heck of
a lot more than $500.

150
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,678
You're sitting there.

151
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:56,762
You're talking in circles.

152
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,722
You're talking like we
didn't go over this already.

153
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,890
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

154
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,101
We had a deal here for 19,500.

155
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,894
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

156
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,688
you'd get me this car,
these options,

157
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,648
without the sealant, for 19,500.

158
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,233
All right,
I'm not saying I didn't.

159
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,859
You called me
20 minutes ago and said

160
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,611
you had it ready
to make delivery.

161
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,363
You says, "Come on
down and get it."

162
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,575
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

163
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,537
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

164
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,664
All right.

165
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,250
I'll talk to my boss.

166
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,755
See, they install that
TruCoat at the factory.

167
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,217
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

168
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,554
These guys here. These guys.

169
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,474
It's always the same.
It's always more.

170
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,439
You going to
the Gophers on Sunday?

171
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,982
Oh, you betcha.

172
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,484
You wouldn't have
an extra ticket?

173
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,903
You kidding?

174
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,865
Well,

175
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,411
he never done this before,

176
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,247
but seeing as it's special
circumstances and all,

177
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,250
he says I can knock
$100 off that TruCoat.

178
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,378
100?

179
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,381
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

180
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,258
You're a bald-faced liar.

181
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,968
Bucky, please.

182
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,637
A fucking liar.

183
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,222
Bucky, please.

184
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,850
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

185
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,560
Let's get this over with.

186
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,188
Where is it?

187
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:08,394
<i>From Hollywood,</i>
The Tonight Show, <i>starring...</i>

188
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,815
I am talking
about your potential.

189
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,899
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,610
You're not a C student.

191
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,986
Yeah.

192
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,447
Yet you're getting C grades.

193
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,784
It's that disparity there that
concerns your dad and me.

194
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:24,868
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,287
You know what a disparity is?

196
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,414
Yeah!

197
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,624
Okay! Well, that's why we...

198
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,043
We don't want you
going out for hockey.

199
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,420
Oh, man!

200
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,422
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

201
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,298
Hold on.

202
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,633
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,801
Hello?

204
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,719
- Yeah, hiya, hon.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

205
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,887
<i>Is Jerry around?</i>

206
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,848
Yeah. Hon! Yeah, he's here.

207
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,141
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

208
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,392
- Hon!
- Yeah?

209
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,060
- It's Dad.
- Okay.

210
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,104
Look, Dad,
there's no fucking way...

211
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,147
Scotty!

212
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,607
Hey, let's watch
that language there.

213
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,817
How you doing there, Wade?

214
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,026
<i>What's going on there?</i>

215
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,446
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

216
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,614
<i>Stan Grossman
looked at your proposal.</i>

217
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,949
<i>He says it's pretty sweet.</i>

218
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,075
No kidding?

219
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,368
<i>Might be interested.</i>

220
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,789
No kidding? I'd need the
cash pretty quick there,

221
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,332
in order to close the deal.

222
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,084
<i>Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.</i>

223
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,212
<i>If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.</i>

224
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,131
<i>- Stan, you know, Grossman.</i>
- Yeah.

225
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,215
<i>2:30.</i>

226
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,383
Yeah. Okay.

227
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,066
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

228
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,027
Say, you know those two fellas

229
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,820
you put me in touch
with up there in Fargo?

230
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,530
I put you in
touch with Grimsrud.

231
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,324
Yeah, well, he had
a buddy there.

232
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,617
- He...
- Then I don't vouch for him.

233
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,784
Well, that's okay.

234
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,037
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

235
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,705
Carl something.

236
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,248
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

237
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,293
Well, that's okay. He's a buddy
of the guy you vouched for,

238
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,794
so I'm not worried. I just...

239
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,297
I was wondering, see, I got
to get in touch with him.

240
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,301
See, this deal I needed him
for, I may not need it anymore.

241
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,345
- Something's happening, see.
- Call him up.

242
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,848
Yeah, well, see, I did that, and
I haven't been able to get him,

243
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,101
so I thought maybe you'd know an
alternate number, or what have you.

244
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,186
Nope.

245
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,063
Okay. Well...

246
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,689
Real good, then.

247
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,379
Can you crack a fucking
window open, man?

248
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,218
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

249
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,303
You know, a cancer agent.

250
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,224
Hey, look at that. Twin Cities.

251
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,892
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

252
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:59,022
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

253
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,733
or John Hancock building,
whatever.

254
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,361
You ever been to Minneapolis?

255
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,529
No.

256
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,659
Would it kill you
to say something?

257
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,494
I did.

258
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,915
"No." That's the first thing you've
said in the last four hours.

259
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,750
That's a...

260
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,420
That's a fountain
of conversation, man.

261
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,171
That's a geyser.

262
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,008
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

263
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,969
Shit.

264
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,804
I'm sitting here driving.

265
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,264
I'm doing all the driving, man,

266
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,099
whole fucking way
from Brainerd, driving.

267
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,852
Just trying to chat.

268
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,563
You know, keep our spirits up,

269
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,731
fight the boredom of the road,

270
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,985
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

271
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,114
Oh, fuck it. I don't
have to talk either, man.

272
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,991
See how you like it.

273
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,788
Just total fucking silence.

274
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,249
Two could play at
that game, smart guy.

275
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,585
We'll just see how you like it.

276
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,672
Total silence.

277
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:11,303
<i>Mr. Lundegaard, this is
Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.</i>

278
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,554
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

279
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,930
Real good. How you doing?

280
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,432
<i>Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.</i>

281
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,517
<i>You're damn hard
to get on the phone.</i>

282
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,062
It's pretty darn busy here, but
that's the way we like it.

283
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,146
<i>Well, that's for sure.</i>

284
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,148
<i>Now, I just need on these last,</i>

285
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,317
<i>these financing documents
that you sent us,</i>

286
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,527
<i>I can't read the serial
numbers of the vehicles.</i>

287
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,945
Yeah, but I already got the...

288
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,447
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

289
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,282
I already got the...
What? The...

290
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,617
<i>Yeah, the 320,000.</i>

291
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,160
<i>You got the money last month.</i>

292
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,620
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

293
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,914
<i>Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,</i>

294
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,917
<i>I just can't read the serial
numbers on your application.</i>

295
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,168
<i>Maybe if you could just read...</i>

296
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,294
Yeah, but the deal's
already done.

297
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,504
I already got the money.

298
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,005
<i>Yes, but if we have
an audit here,</i>

299
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,507
<i>I just have to know
that these vehicles</i>

300
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,883
<i>you're financing
with this money,</i>

301
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,301
<i>that they really exist.</i>

302
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,595
Yeah, well,
they exist, all right.

303
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,347
<i>I'm sure they do,</i>

304
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,809
<i>but I can't read the serial numbers
here, so if you could read me...</i>

305
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,853
Yeah, but... See...

306
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,689
I don't have
them in front of me.

307
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,273
Why don't I just
fax you over a copy?

308
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,942
<i>No, well, no, fax is no good.</i>

309
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,027
<i>That's what I have, and I
can't read the darn thing.</i>

310
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,863
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

311
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,242
<i>Okay, because if I can't correlate
this note with the specific vehicles,</i>

312
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,369
<i>then I got to
call back that money.</i>

313
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,870
Yeah, how much money was that?

314
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,873
<i>320,000. I got to
correlate that money</i>

315
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>with the cars
it's being lent on.</i>

316
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,585
Yeah. Okay, no problem. I'll
just fax that right over.

317
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>No, no, no. Fax...</i>

318
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,547
I mean, send it over. I'll shoot
it right over to you, then.

319
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,715
<i>Okay, okay. Fine.</i>

320
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,675
Okay. Real good, then.

321
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,058
<i>- We're back with Katie Carlson.

00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,228

331
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,622
<i>Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us</i>

332

<i>- Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
- What?</i>

334
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,297
<i>I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.</i>

335
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,381
<i>Right.</i>

336
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,466
<i>This is an empty egg.</i>

337
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,759
<i>That's right, Dale.</i>

338
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:14,801
<i>Well, how do you get the egg...</i>

339
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,178
<i>- There was an egg in here, right?
- Yeah.</i>

340
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,097
<i>Okay, well, I don't... How do you...
I mean, you don't have</i>

341
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,100
<i>an empty chicken somewhere

342
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,226
<i>No, no.</i>

343
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,896
<i>I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...</i>

344
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:42,204
Unguent.

345
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,288
What?

346
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,081
I need unguent.

347
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,714
No.

348
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,848
No...

349
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,289
You want to do it?

350
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,582
Push.

351
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,644
How are you, Stan?
How you doing, Wade?

352
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,646
Good to see you again, Jerry.

353
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,316
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

354
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,775
Those numbers
are right, all right.

355
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,902
Believe me.

356
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,153
This is doable.

357
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,446
Congratulations, Jer.

358
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,406
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

359
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,618
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

360
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,453
Huh?

361
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,247
The financials
are pretty thorough,

362
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,208
so the only thing
we don't know is your fee.

363
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,668
My fee?

364
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,338
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

365
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,756
Stan and I are okay.

366
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,716
- Yeah.
- We're good to load in.

367
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,217
Yeah.

368
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,930
But we never talked about your
fee for bringing it to us.

369
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,349
No, but, Wade, see, I was
bringing you this deal

370
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,808
for you to loan me
the money to put in.

371
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,810
It's my deal here, see.

372
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,106
Jerry, we thought you were
bringing us an investment.

373
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,441
Yeah. Right.

374
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,360
You're saying...

375
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,070
What are you saying?

376
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,404
You're saying
we put in all the money,

377
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,906
and you collect
when it pays off.

378
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,452
No, no. See... But I'd...

379
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,163
I'd pay you back the
principal and interest.

380
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,958
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

381
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,459
We're not a bank, Jerry.

382
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,586
If I wanted bank
interest on 750,000,

383
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,631
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

384
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,091
- He's at North Star.
- He's at...

385
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,134
No, no. See, I...

386
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,013
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

387
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,641
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

388
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,142
Heck, that's not
gonna do it for me.

389
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,352
I need the principal.

390
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,689
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

391
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,232
What the heck were you thinking?

392
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,608
If I'm only
getting bank interest,

393
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,486
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

394
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,988
I don't see nothing
like that here.

395
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,614
Yeah, but I...

396
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,702
Okay. I...

397
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,537
I guarantee you your money back.

398
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,832
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

399
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,166
Jeez! What the heck are you...

400
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,918
We're not a bank, Jerry.

401
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,005
Well, look. I don't want to
cut you out of the loop,

402
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,424
but this here's a good deal.

403
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,843
I assume,
if you're not interested,

404
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:28,346
you won't mind if we move
on it independently.

405
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,575
Damn it!

406
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,024
Hon?

407
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,529
I got the groceries!

408
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:47,443
Yeah, Wade, hi. It's Jerry. I...

409
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:53,491
Wade, it's Jerry. I don't
know what to do. It's Jean.

410
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,161
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

411
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,746
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

412
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,918
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

413
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,756
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

414
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,759
It's something...
Jeez. It's terrible.

415
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,230
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

416
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,185
Shut the fuck up,

417
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,896
or I'll throw you back
into the trunk, you know.

418
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,233
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

419
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,825
Shit.

420
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,663
Oh, the tags.

421
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,420
All right, it's just the tags.

422
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,756
I never put my tags on the car.

423
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,803
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

424
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,036
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

425
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,540
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

426
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,883
Hey, I'll take care of this.

427
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,326
How can I help you, Officer?

428
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,795
This is a new car, then, sir?

429
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,882
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

430
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,427
You're required to
display temporary tags,

431
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,138
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

432
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,264
Certainly.

433
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,683
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

434
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,143
Certainly.

435
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,066
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

436
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:17,737
You know, to be in full
compliance, but it must have...

437
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,947
It must have slipped my mind.

438
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,658
So maybe the best
thing to do would be

439
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,161
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

440
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,414
What's this, sir?

441
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,292
My license and registration.

442
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,754
Yeah, I want to be
in compliance.

443
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,300
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here,

444
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,802
in Brainerd.

445
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,852
Put that back in
your pocket, please,

446
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,480
and step out of the
car, please, sir.

447
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,172
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,816
Whoa.

449
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,153
Whoa, daddy.

450
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,116
You'll take care of it.

451
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,372
You are smooth,
smooth, you know?

452
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,834
Oh, daddy.

453
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,838
Just clear him off the road.

454
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:00,882
Yeah.

455
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,122
No!

456
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,781
Oh, jeez.

457
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,163
Hi. It's Marge.

458
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,625
Oh, my. Where?

459
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,794
Yeah?

460
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,463
Oh, jeez.

461
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,551
Okay. There in a jiff.

462
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,636
Real good, then.

463
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,480
You can sleep. It's early yet.

464
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,023
Got to go?

465
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,275
Yeah.

466
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:32,069
I'll fix you some eggs.

467
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,697
It's okay, hon. I gotta run.

468
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,241
You got to eat
a breakfast, Marge.

469
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,036
I'll fix you some eggs.

470
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,998
Hon, you can sleep.

471
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,459
You gotta eat a breakfast.

472
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,839
I'll fix you some eggs.

473
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,175
Norm.

474
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,225
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

475
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,019
Love you, Margie.

476
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,353
Love you, hon.

477
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,513
Hon?

478
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,597
Yeah?

479
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,474
Prowler needs a jump.

480
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,578
Hiya, Lou.

481
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,082
What you got there?

482
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,252
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

483
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,045
Thanks a bunch.

484
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,421
So what's the deal now?

485
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,714
Gary says triple homicide?

486
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,091
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

487
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,759
Two of them are over here.

488
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,761
Where is everybody?

489
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,639
Well, it's cold, Margie.

490
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,935
Watch your step, Margie.

491
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,697
Jeez. So...

492
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,991
Jeez!

493
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,951
Here's the second one!

494
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,788
It's in the head
and the hand there.

495
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,125
I guess that's
a defensive wound.

496
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,793
Oh, yeah?

497
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,880
Where's the state trooper?

498
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,633
Back there a good piece, in the
ditch next to his prowler.

499
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,135
Okay.

500
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,597
So we got a trooper
pulls someone over.

501
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,140
We got a shooting.

502
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,600
These folks drive by.

503
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,311
There's a high-speed
pursuit, ends here,

504
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,605
and then this
execution-type deal.

505
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:13,814
Yeah.

506
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:18,319
I'd be very surprised if our
suspect was from Brainerd.

507
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,570
Yeah.

508
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,948
And I'll tell you what.

509
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:26,160
From his footprint, he
looks like a big fella.

510
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,207
You see something
down there, Chief?

511
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,085
No. I just think I'm gonna barf.

512
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,295
Jeez.

513
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,839
You okay, Margie?

514
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,507
Yeah. I'm fine.

515
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,095
It's just morning sickness.

516
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,099
Well, that passed.

517
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,267
Yeah?

518
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:51,977
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

519
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,647
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

520
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,190
Oh, yeah.

521
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:57,775
Norm made some eggs.

522
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,026
Yeah?

523
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,028
Well...

524
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,198
What now, do you think?

525
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,367
Let's go take
a look at that trooper.

526
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,288
There's different
footprints here, Lou.

527
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,414
Yeah?

528
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,125
Yeah. This guy's
smaller than his buddy.

529
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,502
Oh, yeah?

530
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,963
For Pete's sake.

531
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,464
How's it look, Marge?

532
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,550
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

533
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,470
and he looks like
a nice enough guy.

534
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,514
It's a real shame.

535
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:29,932
Yeah.

536
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,436
Didn't monkey with his
car there, did you?

537
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,604
No way.

538
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,314
Well, somebody shut his lights.

539
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,816
I guess the little guy
sat in there

540
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,234
waiting for his
buddy to come back.

541
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,902
Yeah, it would have
been cold out here.

542
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,905
Heck, yeah. You think
is Dave open yet?

543
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,115
Dave?

544
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,659
You don't think
he's mixed up in...

545
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:52,079
Oh, no, no. I just want to get
Norm some night crawlers.

546
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,792
Did you look
in his citation book?

547
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:02,089
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

548
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,383
Under plate number he put "DLR."

549
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,135
I figure they stopped him
or shot him

550
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,263
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

551
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,850
So, I got the State looking for a
Cierra with a tag starting "DLR."

552
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,019
They don't got no match yet.

553
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,063
I'm not sure that
I agree with you 100%

554
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:20,190
on your police work there, Lou.

555
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:21,608
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

556
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,446
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

557
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,281
"DLR."

558
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,617
Oh.

559
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,787
Jeez.

560
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,749
Say, Lou,

561
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:37,916
did you hear
the one about the guy

562
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,543
who couldn't afford
personalized plates,

563
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,963
so he went and changed
his name to J3L-2404?

564
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,008
Yeah. That's a good one.

565
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:57,186
Look, all's I know is, you got a
problem, you call a professional.

566
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,063
No. They said no cops.

567
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,898
They were darn
clear on that, Wade.

568
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,941
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

569
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,443
Of course they're
gonna say that.

570
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,570
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

571
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,572
If I give these sons
of bitches $1 million,

572
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,449
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

573
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,533
Well, they...

574
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,701
$1 million is a lot
of damn money.

575
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,495
- Yeah, but...
- There they are. They got my daughter.

576
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,080
Think this thing through here,
Wade.

577
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,083
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

578
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,044
You got to listen to me on this one,
Wade.

579
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,921
Heck, you don't know.

580
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,006
You're just whistling Dixie here.

581
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,092
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

582
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,426
I'm saying call a professional.

583
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,470
No. No cops.

584
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,973
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

585
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,100
Yeah.

586
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,143
Jean is my wife here.

587
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:41,105
I gotta tell you, Wade, I'm leaning
to Jerry's viewpoint here.

588
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,189
Well...

589
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,441
We got to protect Jean. These...

590
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,276
We're not holding
any cards here, Wade.

591
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,320
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

592
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,530
You're darn tooting.

593
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,697
Oh, damn it.

594
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,949
I'm telling you.

595
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,409
Well, why don't we...

596
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:58,080
Stan, I'm thinking we should
offer them a half a million.

597
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,581
Now, come on here!

598
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,625
No way, Wade. No way.

599
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,085
We're not horse-trading
here, Wade.

600
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,169
Yeah.

601
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,963
We gotta just bite the
bullet on this thing.

602
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,172
Yeah.

603
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,844
So, well, what's the
next step here, Jerry?

604
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,555
They're gonna call me up and
give me instructions for a drop.

605
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,223
I'm supposed to have the
money ready tomorrow.

606
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,474
Damn it!

607
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,770
How was everything today?

608
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,647
Yeah. Real good, now.

609
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,984
How you doing?

610
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,904
Okay. Now, we'll get
the money together.

611
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,115
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

612
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,119
Now, do you want anyone at
home with you till they call?

613
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,662
No, I... They don't...

614
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,539
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

615
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,832
- They were real clear.
- Yeah.

616
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,084
You know, they said
no one listening in.

617
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,335
They'll be watching.

618
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,379
You know, maybe it's all bull,

619
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,007
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

620
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,258
Okay.

621
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,303
Now, is Scotty
gonna be all right?

622
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,098
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

623
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,475
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

624
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,285
How you doing there, Scotty?

625
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:19,953
Dad...

626
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,664
What are they doing?

627
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,167
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

628
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,919
It's okay, Scotty.

629
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,712
They're not gonna
wanna hurt her any.

630
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,465
These men, they just want money.

631
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,301
Yeah, well, what if
something goes wrong, Dad?

632
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,971
No, no. Nothing's
going wrong here.

633
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:42,267
Granddad and I, we're, we're making
sure this gets handled right.

634
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,354
I really think we should
call the cops here.

635
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,690
No. No. No one can
know about this thing.

636
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,068
We gotta play
ball with these guys.

637
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,237
You ask Stan Grossman, he'll
tell you the same thing.

638
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,321
Yeah. But, Dad...

639
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,866
We're gonna get Mom back for
you, but we gotta play ball.

640
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,409
You know?

641
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,829
That's the deal here.

642
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,753
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

643
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,340
you just say Mom's down in
Florida, with Pearl and Marty.

644
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:19,680
That's the best we can do here.

645
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,725
No!

646
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:22,909
No!

647
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,083
Oh, God.

648
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,184
Lunchtime.

649
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,477
Thanks, Margaret.

650
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,270
Hi. Hey.

651
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,397
Willy. Carol.

652
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,067
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

653
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,193
Sure thing.

654
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,112
Hiya, hon.

655
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,947
I brought you
some lunch, Margie.

656
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,241
What are those? Night crawlers?

657
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,451
Yeah.

658
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,786
Oh, thanks, hon.

659
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,913
You bet. Thanks for lunch.

660
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,165
Yeah. Looks pretty good.

661
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,126
What do we got here, Arby's?

662
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:14,711
How's the painting going?

663
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,254
Pretty good.

664
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,716
Found out the Hautmans are
entering a painting this year.

665
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,885
Hon, you're better than them.

666
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,887
They're real good.

667
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,057
They're good, Norm, but
you're better than them.

668
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,476
You think so?

669
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,397
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

670
00:45:35,775 --> 00:45:37,859
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

671
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,486
Not too bad. You know.

672
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,862
How we doing on that vehicle?

673
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,573
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

674
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:47,077
but the night before, two men
checked into the Blue Ox,

675
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,288
registering a Cierra and
leaving the tag space blank.

676
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,540
Jeez, that's a good lead.

677
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,707
Yeah.

678
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,252
Blue Ox, that's that truckers'
joint out there on I-35?

679
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,963
Yeah. Owner was
on the desk then.

680
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,965
Said these two had company.

681
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,174
Oh, yeah?

682
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,426
Yeah.

683
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,598
Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.

684
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:10,600
I went to Normandale
for about a year and a half.

685
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:11,768
Yeah, that's where we met.

686
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:12,936
But I dropped out, though.

687
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,104
Yeah. She dropped.

688
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,188
Yeah.

689
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:16,982
So where you girls from?

690
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,942
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

691
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,153
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

692
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,529
Go Bears.

693
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,033
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

694
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,161
Well, the little guy, he
was kind of funny-looking.

695
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,287
In what way?

696
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,289
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

697
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,708
Can you be any more specific?

698
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,126
I couldn't really say.

699
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,669
He wasn't circumcised.

700
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,590
Was he funny-looking
apart from that?

701
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:42,799
Yeah.

702
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,596
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

703
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,139
Uh-huh.

704
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,266
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

705
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,186
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

706
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,313
More than most people, even.

707
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,606
What about the other fella?

708
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,815
He was a little older.

709
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,650
You know, he looked
like the Marlboro Man.

710
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,402
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

711
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,945
But maybe I'm saying
that, you know,

712
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,323
'cause he smoked
a lot of Marlboros.

713
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,241
You know, like a
subconscious type of thing.

714
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,493
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

715
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,619
Yeah.

716
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,704
Hey, they said they were
going to the Twin Cities.

717
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,289
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

718
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,832
Yeah, is that useful to you?

719
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,501
You betcha. Yeah.

720
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:18,919
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

721
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,255
Come on!

722
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,716
Goddamn it!

723
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,678
Jesus Christ.

724
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,140
Fucking shitbox.

725
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,352
Been here for days.

726
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,563
Damn it. Nothing to do.

727
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,900
Fucking TV doesn't even...

728
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,614
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

729
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,117
Goddamn it!

730
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,580
Unbelievable! Come on!

731
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,123
God...

732
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,084
Fuck!

733
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,462
Come on, plug me into
the ozone, baby! Come on!

734
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,298
Come on!

735
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,843
Fuck! Fuck!

736
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,471
Fuck! Fuck!

737
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:21,648
<i>The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest</i>

738
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,986
<i>where it will feed its young
for up to six months.</i>

739
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,950
<i>In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.</i>

740
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,326
Well...

741
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,496
I'm turning in, Norm.

742
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,331
Oh, yeah?

743
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,545
<i>Here it is, throwing
off the larval envelope.</i>

744
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,685
Hello?

745
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,770
<i>Yeah. Is this Marge?</i>

746
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,105
Yeah.

747
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,815
<i>Margie Olmstead?</i>

748
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,027
Yeah. Who's this?

749
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,321
<i>This is Mike Yanagita!</i>

750
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,032
<i>You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?</i>

751
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,952
Mike Yanagita?

752
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,454
<i>Yeah!</i>

753
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,165
Well, yeah!

754
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,459
Course I remember you.

755
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,961
How are you doing?
What time is it?

756
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:27,464
<i>Oh, jeez. It's 10:45.</i>

757
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:28,965
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

758
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,801
No. That's okay.

759
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,970
<i>Yeah, I'm down in
the Twin Cities,</i>

760
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:36,931
<i>and I was just watching on TV about
these shootings up in Brainerd.</i>

761
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:38,475
<i>And I saw you on the news there.</i>

762
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,643
Yeah.

763
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,269
<i>I thought, "Jeez, is
that Margie Olmstead?"</i>

764
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,479
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

765
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:44,898
Yeah, that's me.

766
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,317
<i>Well, how the heck are you?</i>

767
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,027
Okay. You know.

768
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:50,904
Okay.

769
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,447
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

770
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,532
How you doing?

771
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,242
<i>Pretty good.</i>

772
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,912
Well, heck.

773
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,331
It's been such
a long time, Mike.

774
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,209
It's great to hear from you.

775
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,422
Yeah, you got your...

776
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,550
This is loaded here. This
has your independent...

777
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,012
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

778
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:19,015
antilock brakes, alarm, radar,

779
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,060
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

780
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,437
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

781
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,356
Yeah, I don't need
no sealant, though.

782
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,274
Yeah. You don't need that.

783
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,110
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

784
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,821
You ought to be aware of this
GMAC plan they have now.

785
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:33,905
It's really super.

786
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,198
Got a call for you, Jerry.

787
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,616
Yeah, okay.

788
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,708
Jerry Lundegaard.

789
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,960
<i>All right, Jerry, you
got the phone to yourself?</i>

790
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,128
Well, yeah.

791
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,212
<i>You know who this is?</i>

792
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,297
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

793
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,216
How's that Cierra
working out for you?

794
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,552
<i>Circumstances
have changed, Jerry.</i>

795
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:56,803
Well...

796
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,680
What do you mean?

797
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,475
<i>Things have changed. Circumstances,
Jerry, beyond the acts of God.</i>

798
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,601
Force majeure.

799
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:04,936
What the...

800
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,396
How's Jean?

801
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,857
<i>Who's Jean?</i>

802
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,900
My wife. What the...

803
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,027
<i>She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd</i>

804
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,320
<i>who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.</i>

805
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,572
What the heck
are you talking about?

806
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,240
Let's just finish
this deal up here.

807
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,492
<i>Blood has been shed, Jerry.</i>

808
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,286
What the heck do you mean?

809
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,246
<i>Three people in Brainerd.</i>

810
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,414
Oh, jeez.

811
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,541
<i>That's right,
and we need more money.</i>

812
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,834
What the heck
are you talking about?

813
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,836
What do you fellas
got yourself mixed up in?

814
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
<i>We need more money...</i>

815
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,089
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

816
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,759
<i>Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!</i>

817
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,969
Well, I'm sorry,
but I just, I...

818
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,221
<i>I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!</i>

819
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,806
<i>We now want the entire 80,000.</i>

820
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,767
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

821
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,101
<i>Blood has been shed.</i>

822
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,436
<i>We've incurred risk, Jerry.</i>

823
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,645
<i>I'm coming into town tomorrow.</i>

824
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:48,855
<i>You have the money ready.</i>

825
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,316
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

826
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,442
<i>Is it, Jerry?</i>

827
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,736
<i>You ask those three poor souls up
in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.</i>

828
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,945
Go ahead, ask them!

829
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,071
The heck do you mean?

830
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,532
<i>"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

831
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,788
Yeah?

832
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:05,955
<i>Jerome Lundegaard?</i>

833
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,081
Yeah.

834
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:08,792
<i>This is Reilly Diefenbach
at GMAC.</i>

835
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,628
<i>Sir, I've not received those
vehicle IDs you promised.</i>

836
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,046
Yeah. I...

837
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,756
Those are in the mail.

838
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,592
<i>That very well may be. I
must inform you, however,</i>

839
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,470
<i>that absent the receipt of those
numbers by tomorrow afternoon,</i>

840
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,056
<i>I will have to refer this
matter to our legal department.</i>

841
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,140
Yeah.

842
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,975
<i>- My patience is at an end.</i>
- Yeah.

843
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,560
<i>- Good day, sir.</i>
- Yeah.

844
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,913
Hi, Norm. How you doing, Margie?

845
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,999
How's the fricassee?

846
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,542
Pretty darn good. You want some?

847
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,877
Oh, no. I got...

848
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:37,922
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

849
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,300
Yeah. After lunch.

850
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,051
What you got there?

851
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,554
The numbers you asked for.

852
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,348
Calls made from the lobby
pay phone at the Blue Ox.

853
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,475
Two to Minneapolis that night.

854
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,894
First one's a trucking company

855
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,854
and second one's
a private residence,

856
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,606
a Shep Proudfoot.

857
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:56,941
A what?

858
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,319
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

859
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:01,279
Yeah.

860
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,990
Okay. Yeah.

861
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,951
Think I'll take a drive
down there, then.

862
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:08,995
Oh, yeah? Twin Cities.

863
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,999
Oh, yeah?

864
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,099
Damn it, I want to be
a part of this thing.

865
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,393
No. Wade, they were real clear.

866
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,312
They said they'd call
tomorrow with instructions,

867
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,272
and it's gotta be
delivered by me alone.

868
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,650
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

869
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,443
What do they care?

870
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,778
Wade's got a point, there.

871
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,363
I'll handle the call
if you want, Jerry.

872
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,697
No, no. See, they...

873
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,033
No. See, they only deal with me.

874
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,870
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

875
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,623
They're very... These
guys are dangerous.

876
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,250
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

877
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,170
With all due respect, Jerry, I
don't want you mucking this up.

878
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,296
What the heck do you mean?

879
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,923
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

880
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,466
Otherwise, I'm going
to a professional.

881
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,218
- No, see...
- There's $1 million here.

882
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,344
No. See...

883
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,263
Look, Jerry, you're not
selling me a damn car!

884
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,683
It's my show here. That's that!

885
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:16,354
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

886
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,445
Hi. How you doing?

887
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,197
Real good. How are you
doing today, ma'am?

888
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,574
I'm doing really
super there. Thanks.

889
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,494
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

890
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,998
Yep. You sure do,
Mrs. Gunderson.

891
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,001
Is there a phone
down here, you think?

892
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,838
Detective Sibert?

893
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:45,425
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

894
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,720
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

895
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,805
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

896
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,473
so I thought
I'd check in with you

897
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,059
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

898
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,104
Oh, yeah?

899
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:02,150
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have...

900
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,110
No. I can find that.

901
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,279
Yeah. Well, thanks a bunch.

902
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,157
Say, say, would you
happen to know

903
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,118
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

904
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,454
The Radisson.

905
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,540
Oh, yeah? Is it reasonable?

906
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,744
Hi. How you doing?

907
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,247
Yeah. I decided
not to park here.

908
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,958
Well, what do you mean? You
decided not to park here?

909
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,877
Yeah, I just came in and I
decided not to park here, so...

910
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,630
But... Well, I'm sorry, sir...

911
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,007
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

912
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,093
You know, I'm not...

913
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,470
I decided not to take the
trip, as it turns out, so...

914
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,765
Well, I'm sorry, sir, we still
got to charge you the $4.

915
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,893
I just pulled in here.

916
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,353
I just fucking pulled in here.

917
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,521
Well, but...

918
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,107
See, there's a minimum
charge of $4.

919
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,943
Long-term parking
charges by the day.

920
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,826
I guess you think you're, you
know, like an authority figure.

921
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,203
That stupid fucking
uniform, huh, buddy?

922
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,746
King clip-on tie there.

923
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,248
Big fucking man, huh?

924
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,126
You know, these are the
limits of your life, man.

925
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,586
Ruler of your
little fucking gate here.

926
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,629
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

927
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,384
Where's Shep?

928
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,303
Talking to a cop.

929
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,554
Cop?

930
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,598
Said she was a cop.

931
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,103
So do you remember
getting a call Wednesday night?

932
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,271
Nope.

933
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:49,192
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

934
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,276
Yep.

935
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,361
Anyone else residing there?

936
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,529
No.

937
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:57,575
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

938
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:01,787
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

939
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,582
Now, I know you've
had some problems.

940
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,542
Struggling with the narcotics,

941
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:09,545
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

942
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,214
So?

943
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,715
Well, associating
with criminals,

944
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,050
if you're the one
they talked to,

945
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:17,303
that right there would be a
violation of your parole.

946
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,889
Would end you up
back in Stillwater.

947
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,266
Now, I saw some rough
stuff on your priors,

948
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,976
but nothing in the
nature of a homicide.

949
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:28,022
I know you don't want to be an
accessory to something like that.

950
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,150
So, you think you might remember

951
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,736
who those folks
were who called you?

952
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:43,871
Mr. Lundegaard?

953
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:45,122
Yeah.

954
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,083
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

955
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,001
What is it all about?

956
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,753
Do you mind if I sit down?

957
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,838
Carrying quite a load here.

958
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,924
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

959
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,385
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

960
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,262
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

961
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,514
My father-in-law,
he's the owner.

962
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,765
Uh-huh.

963
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,809
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

964
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,644
investigating some malfeasance.

965
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:09,230
And I was just wondering if
you'd had any new vehicles

966
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:12,358
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

967
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,945
Specifically
a tan Cutlass Cierra.

968
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,034
Mr. Lundegaard.

969
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:25,913
Brainerd.

970
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:27,999
Yeah, yeah.

971
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,626
Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe, the Blue Ox.

972
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,378
Babe, the Blue Ox.

973
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:39,552
Yeah, you know, we got
that big statue up there.

974
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,683
So, you haven't had any
vehicles go missing, then?

975
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,268
Nope. No, ma'am.

976
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:49,478
Okey-dokey. Thanks a bunch.

977
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,565
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

978
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:08,331
<i>- Service.</i>
- Yeah, get me Shep.

979
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:09,665
<i>He's not here right now.</i>

980
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,791
What the heck do you mean?

981
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,376
<i>He stepped out.</i>

982
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,961
- Where'd he go? It's only...
<i>- I'll get you Artie.</i>

983
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:17,214
No. I don't need
a mechanic. I need a...

984
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,262
Jeez. I gotta talk
to a friend of his,

985
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:25,348
so...

986
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,975
Have him...

987
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,394
<i>What?</i>

988
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,520
Oh, jeez.

989
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,459
Mike?

990
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:55,461
Marge?

991
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,132
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

992
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,468
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

993
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,888
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too.

994
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,556
I'm expecting now.

995
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,892
I see that. That's great.

996
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,352
What can I get you?

997
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,270
Just a Diet Coke, please.

998
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,980
Great.

999
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,024
This is a nice place.

1000
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:20,528
Yeah. You know, it's the
Radisson, so it's pretty good.

1001
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,779
Yeah.

1002
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,326
So...

1003
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,453
You're living in Edina, then?

1004
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,664
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

1005
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,457
It's actually Eden Prairie.

1006
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,126
That school district.

1007
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,170
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

1008
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,173
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

1009
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,925
Oh, yeah. Long time ago.

1010
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,635
Great, great.

1011
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,388
So, what brings you down?

1012
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,598
Are you down here
on that homicide,

1013
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,934
if you're allowed, you
know, to discuss that?

1014
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,310
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1015
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,188
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

1016
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,607
Okay.

1017
01:02:58,692 --> 01:02:59,984
Well, what about you, Mike?

1018
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,318
Are you married?

1019
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:02,486
You got kids?

1020
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:04,363
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1021
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,616
I was married.
I was married to...

1022
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,618
You mind if I sit over here?

1023
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,745
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1024
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,874
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1025
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,211
Okay.

1026
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,215
Sorry.

1027
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,051
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1028
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:28,387
Sure, sure. I understand.

1029
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:30,848
I didn't mean to...

1030
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:34,393
No, no. That's fine.

1031
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,981
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1032
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,401
So, I was married
to Linda Cooksey.

1033
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:45,279
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1034
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,822
Yeah. I think I remember her.

1035
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:49,658
Yeah! She... Oh, yeah!

1036
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,327
So, it didn't work out, huh?

1037
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,997
And then I've been working for
Honeywell for a few years now.

1038
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,248
Well, they're a good outfit.

1039
01:03:56,333 --> 01:04:00,044
Yeah, if you're an engineer,
yeah, you could do a lot worse.

1040
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,837
But it's not...

1041
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:04,089
It's nothing like
your achievement.

1042
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,176
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1043
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,844
It's not that...

1044
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:12,139
It's not that things
didn't work out. It's...

1045
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,393
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1046
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:19,313
She was... She passed away.

1047
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,773
No.

1048
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:24,360
It was tough.

1049
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,736
There you go.

1050
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,863
It was long...

1051
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,825
She fought real hard, Marge.

1052
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,119
You know...

1053
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,455
So, what can you say?

1054
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,710
Better times, huh?

1055
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,254
Better times.

1056
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:50,636
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1057
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,555
I always liked you.

1058
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:53,889
Well, I always liked you...

1059
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,683
I always liked you so much.

1060
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,690
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1061
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,108
No! I...

1062
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,072
I'm sorry. It's...

1063
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,575
You know, I shouldn't
have done this.

1064
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,702
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1065
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,329
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1066
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,789
It's okay, Mike.

1067
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:21,417
You were such a super lady.

1068
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,753
And then... I've been so lonely.

1069
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,133
It's okay, Mike.

1070
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:39,310
<i>Here's a song I dedicate to
all the ladies out here tonight.</i>

1071
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,562
<i>Goes like this.</i>

1072
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,524
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

1073
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,777
<i>Everything will be all right</i>

1074
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,114
<i>Don't hesitate now</i>

1075
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,866
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

1076
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,284
So...

1077
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,870
Are you from around here?

1078
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,539
Just in town on business.

1079
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,207
Just in and out.

1080
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,504
Just a little
of the old in-and-out.

1081
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:10,049
What do you do?

1082
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:12,384
I...

1083
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,890
You been to the
Celebrity Room before?

1084
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,892
With other clients?

1085
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,894
I don't think so.

1086
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,437
It's nice.

1087
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,981
Yeah, well,
depends on the artist.

1088
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,234
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1089
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:30,944
Waiter!

1090
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,782
What is he, deaf?

1091
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:36,909
So...

1092
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,329
How long you work
for the escort service?

1093
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,539
I don't know. A few months.

1094
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,085
Find that work
interesting, do you?

1095
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:49,254
What are you talking about?

1096
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,090
Right.

1097
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,508
Come on.

1098
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,593
I'm hearing bells. Come on.

1099
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,972
All right. Where were you?

1100
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:06,605
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1101
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:11,068
Fucking asshole. Get
the fuck out of here.

1102
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:14,154
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1103
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:15,781
Get the fuck out of here.

1104
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,867
Yo! Cut that shit out, man.

1105
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,911
Trying to get some
goddamn sleep here.

1106
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,038
Come on, brother...

1107
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:24,415
Fuck you!

1108
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,214
Fuck you.

1109
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,507
Animals!

1110
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,094
Stay away from me, man.

1111
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,263
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

1112
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:41,265
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1113
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,399
Fucking little weasel!

1114
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,192
- Fuck you, man.
- Stop it!

1115
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:56,071
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1116
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:59,825
Jesus Christ! You fucking
shitbag motherfucker!

1117
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:04,747
<i>Yeah?</i>

1118
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,081
All right, Jerry, I'm
through fucking around.

1119
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,249
<i>You got the fucking money?</i>

1120
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,376
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1121
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,128
<i>Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.</i>

1122
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:14,214
<i>I want you to put this money in the
Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,</i>

1123
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,799
<i>30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.</i>

1124
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:16,925
Okay. But...

1125
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,261
Hey, you're there in 30
minutes or I find you, Jerry,

1126
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,846
and I shoot you and I
shoot your fucking wife,

1127
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,222
and I shoot all your
little fucking children

1128
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,767
and I shoot them all in the back of
their little fucking heads. You got it?

1129
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,685
Okay, now, you stay away
from Scotty, now.

1130
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:27,770
<i>Got it?</i>

1131
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,521
Okay. Real good, then.

1132
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,756
Dad.

1133
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,800
It's okay, Scotty.

1134
01:08:57,884 --> 01:08:59,551
Where you going?

1135
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,929
I'll be back in a minute.

1136
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:06,558
If Stan calls, you just
tell him I went to Embers.

1137
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:09,937
Okay.

1138
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,606
Here's your damn money.

1139
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,400
Now, where's my daughter?

1140
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:17,194
Yeah.

1141
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,489
You goddamn punk!

1142
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,590
Who the fuck are you?

1143
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,220
Who the fuck are you?

1144
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,390
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1145
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,976
I am through fucking around!

1146
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,727
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1147
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:52,437
Where's my daughter?

1148
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,857
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry?

1149
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,234
I gave simple
fucking instructions.

1150
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,027
Where's my damn daughter?

1151
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,445
No Jean, no money.

1152
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,406
Drop that fucking money!

1153
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:04,157
No Jean, no money!

1154
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,953
Is this a fucking joke here?

1155
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,921
Oh, jeez.

1156
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,090
You happy now, asshole?

1157
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,884
What's with you people?

1158
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,802
You fucking imbeciles!

1159
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,812
You fucking shot me!

1160
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,975
May I have your ticket, please?

1161
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,810
Open the fucking gate!

1162
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:35,767
Oh, jeez.

1163
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:07,090
Dad?

1164
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,300
Yeah?

1165
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,510
Stan Grossman called.

1166
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,137
Yeah. Okay.

1167
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,263
Twice.

1168
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,389
Okay.

1169
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,101
Is everything okay?

1170
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:19,603
Yeah.

1171
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:23,148
Are you calling Stan?

1172
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:26,860
Well, I'm...

1173
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:30,280
I'm going to bed now.

1174
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,276
How you doing?

1175
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,028
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

1176
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,488
Officer Olson.

1177
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,073
Yeah. Righto.

1178
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,117
Well...

1179
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,411
So I'm tending bar down there at
Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1180
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,205
and this little guy's drinking,

1181
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,290
and he says, "Where can
a guy find some action?

1182
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,626
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

1183
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,211
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1184
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,463
And he says, "Woman action.
What do I look like?"

1185
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:30,006
And I says, "Well,
what do I look like?

1186
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,259
"I don't arrange
that kind of thing."

1187
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:34,845
And he says, "But I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1188
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,181
And I says, "Yeah, but this
ain't that kind of place."

1189
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:41,768
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1190
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:43,395
Only he don't use
the word "jerk."

1191
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,021
- I understand.
- Then he calls me a jerk,

1192
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,566
says the last guy thought
he's a jerk is dead now.

1193
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,234
So, I don't say nothing.

1194
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,194
He says, "What do you
think about that?"

1195
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,698
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

1196
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:55,824
You got that right.

1197
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,659
Yeah, he says, "Yeah,
that guy's dead,

1198
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,244
"and I don't mean of old age."

1199
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,831
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

1200
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:03,957
White Bear Lake?

1201
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,501
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1202
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:07,711
So I made that assumption.

1203
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:08,795
Sure.

1204
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,672
Anyway, he's drinking
at the bar,

1205
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,465
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1206
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:15,552
but then Mrs. Mohra, she heard
about the homicides down here

1207
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,764
and thought I should call
it in, so I called it in.

1208
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,602
End of story.

1209
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,687
Well, what'd this guy
look like, anyways?

1210
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,355
Oh, he's a...

1211
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,065
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1212
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,359
In what way?

1213
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,445
Just in a general kind of way.

1214
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,114
Okay. Well, thanks a
bunch, Mr. Mohra.

1215
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,866
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1216
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,159
but thanks for calling her in.

1217
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,493
Sure.

1218
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,163
Looks like she's gonna
turn cold tomorrow.

1219
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,540
Oh, yeah. Got a front coming in.

1220
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,918
Yeah. You got that right.

1221
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,647
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:28,745
Valerie, I'm leaving this
morning, back up to Brainerd.

1223
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,289
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

1224
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,749
But you think he's all right?

1225
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,000
I saw him last night and...

1226
01:18:34,085 --> 01:18:35,085
<i>What did he say?</i>

1227
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,878
Well, it's nothing
specific he said.

1228
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,173
It just seemed like it all hit
him really hard, his wife dying.

1229
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,175
<i>- His wife?</i>
- Linda.

1230
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,219
<i>- Who?</i>
- Linda Cooksey.

1231
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,137
<i>No. No, no. They weren't...</i>

1232
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:49,140
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

1233
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,310
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

1234
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:53,937
So...

1235
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,939
He didn't...

1236
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:57,482
He never...

1237
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,234
<i>No! No, they never married.</i>

1238
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,820
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

1239
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,279
Oh, my.

1240
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,906
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

1241
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,325
<i>He's living
with his parents now.</i>

1242
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,828
Oh, jeez.

1243
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,288
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

1244
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:13,957
Jeez. Well...

1245
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,667
Jeez.

1246
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,087
That's a surprise.

1247
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,306
Hello!

1248
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:14,267
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1249
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,395
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1250
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,981
I understand. I'll keep
it real short, then.

1251
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,901
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1252
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,152
Do you mind if I sit down?

1253
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,403
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1254
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:26,613
No, I...

1255
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:28,406
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1256
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:29,491
I was just wondering...

1257
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:32,702
Yeah, like I told you, we haven't
had any vehicles go missing.

1258
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,871
Okay. Are you sure?

1259
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,291
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1260
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,001
Because, see, the crime
I'm investigating,

1261
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,295
the perpetrators were driving
a car with dealer plates,

1262
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,630
and they called
someone who works here,

1263
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,340
so it'd be quite a
coincidence if they weren't,

1264
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,258
you know, connected.

1265
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,260
Yeah, I see.

1266
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:50,803
So, how do you...

1267
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,014
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1268
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,724
The car's not
from our lot, ma'am.

1269
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:56,893
But how do you know that for
sure without doing a...

1270
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,686
Well, I would know.

1271
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,522
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1272
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,315
Yeah, but I understand...

1273
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:03,900
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1274
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,026
I know, but...

1275
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,153
Well, how do
they establish that, sir?

1276
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:08,655
I mean,
are the cars counted daily,

1277
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,573
or what kind of a routine here?

1278
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,117
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1279
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:18,498
I'm sorry, sir?

1280
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:20,875
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1281
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:22,585
I answered the darn...

1282
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:25,964
I'm cooperating
here, and there's no...

1283
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:32,470
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1284
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,055
I'm just doing my job here.

1285
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,306
I'm...

1286
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:40,228
I'm not... I'm not arguing here.

1287
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,730
I'm cooperating,
and there's no...

1288
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:44,857
We're doing all we can.

1289
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,409
Sir, could I talk
to Mr. Gustafson?

1290
01:21:58,372 --> 01:21:59,914
Mr. Lundegaard.

1291
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:06,546
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1292
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,257
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1293
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:12,260
Okay! I'll do a damn lot count!

1294
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,428
Sir, right now?

1295
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,138
Yeah! Right now.

1296
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,557
You're darn tooting!

1297
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:21,477
If it's so damned
important to you.

1298
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,771
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1299
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:26,065
What the Christ! Jeez!

1300
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,415
<i>Bob Elcorona, line two.</i>

1301
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:12,612
For Pete's sake.

1302
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,242
For Pete's sake, he's
fleeing the interview.

1303
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,453
He's fleeing the interview!

1304
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:24,248
How do I get
an outside line here?

1305
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,335
All right.

1306
01:23:30,589 --> 01:23:32,882
Yeah. Detective Sibert, please.

1307
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,345
<i>I told you it was over, and I
thought I made myself very clear.</i>

1308
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:40,181
<i>Oh, you did. You made
yourself perfectly clear.</i>

1309
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,183
<i>But something's come up.</i>

1310
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:43,726
<i>What?</i>

1311
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,353
<i>Well, it's something
kind of small,</i>

1312
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,605
<i>but it might be a big problem.</i>

1313
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,273
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1314
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,318
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1315
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:56,739
<i>I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,</i>

1316
01:23:56,824 --> 01:24:00,368
<i>and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.</i>

1317
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,456
<i>Now, look here.
I can explain this.</i>

1318
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:09,043
<i>See, Robin was...
ls a student of mine.</i>

1319
01:24:09,962 --> 01:24:12,213
You should see the other guy.

1320
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,674
<i>No, no, no. It wasn't
anything like that.</i>

1321
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:15,883
<i>You don't understand!</i>

1322
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,719
<i>I read that letter
that she wrote.</i>

1323
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,387
<i>I think I understand all there is...</i>

1324
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,222
What happened to her?

1325
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:25,184
She started shrieking, you know.

1326
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:26,352
Jeez.

1327
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,188
Well, I got the money.

1328
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,400
All of it, all 80 grand.

1329
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,280
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1330
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,950
That's it, then.

1331
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,165
You can have my truck.

1332
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,833
I'm taking the Cierra.

1333
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,418
We split that.

1334
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,798
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

1335
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,092
With a fucking chain saw?

1336
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:01,012
One of us pays
the other for half.

1337
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,723
Hold on. No fucking way.

1338
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:06,726
Did you fucking notice this?

1339
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:09,312
I got fucking shot!

1340
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,939
I got fucking shot in the face!

1341
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:13,566
I went and got
the fucking money!

1342
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,401
I got shot
fucking picking it up!

1343
01:25:15,486 --> 01:25:18,196
I've been up
for 36 fucking hours!

1344
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,948
I'm taking that fucking car!

1345
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:24,368
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

1346
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,872
You know, I've been listening to
your fucking bullshit all week!

1347
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,540
Are we square?

1348
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:33,377
Are we square?

1349
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,340
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1350
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,302
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1351
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,888
tell him I'm gonna
nail his fucking ass.

1352
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:48,226
<i>I'll call you... Later.</i>

1353
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,157
<i>His wife. This guy says
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.</i>

1354
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:04,659
The day of our homicides.

1355
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:05,827
<i>Yeah.</i>

1356
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,245
And this guy was who?

1357
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:09,956
<i>Lundegaard's father-in-law's
accountant.</i>

1358
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,666
Gustafson's accountant.

1359
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:12,917
<i>Yeah.</i>

1360
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,669
But we still
haven't found Gustafson?

1361
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:16,462
<i>...looking...</i>

1362
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:18,256
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

1363
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,924
<i>Still missing. We're looking.</i>

1364
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,009
Copy. And Lundegaard, too?

1365
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:24,637
<i>Yeah. Where are you, Margie?</i>

1366
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:25,847
I'm almost back.

1367
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,515
I'm taking a drive
around Moose Lake.

1368
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,600
<i>Gary's loudmouth.</i>

1369
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:31,269
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1370
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:32,937
So the whole state has it, huh?

1371
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,856
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1372
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,190
<i>Yeah. It's over the wire.</i>

1373
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:37,692
<i>It's everywhere.
They'll find them.</i>

1374
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:38,901
Copy.

1375
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,486
<i>Yeah, we got a lead on this...</i>

1376
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:41,904
There's the car!
There's the car!

1377
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:43,030
<i>Whose car?</i>

1378
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,450
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1379
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:50,037
<i>Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.</i>

1380
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:44,735
Police!

1381
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:54,078
Hands up!

1382
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,579
Police!

1383
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,167
Police!

1384
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:03,355
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1385
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:11,989
And I guess that was your
accomplice in the wood chipper.

1386
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,121
And those three people
in Brainerd.

1387
01:30:24,503 --> 01:30:25,961
And for what?

1388
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:29,173
For a little bit of money.

1389
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:38,015
There's more to life than
a little money, you know?

1390
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,401
Don't you know that?

1391
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,535
And here you are.

1392
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,704
And it's a beautiful day.

1393
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:11,257
Well...

1394
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,230
I just don't understand it.

1395
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:10,024
Mr. Anderson?

1396
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,568
Who?

1397
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:16,113
Mr. Anderson, is this your
burgundy '98 out here?

1398
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:18,991
Just a sec.

1399
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,784
Could you open the door, please?

1400
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:22,786
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1401
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,622
Just a sec.

1402
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:34,173
- Dale!
- My leg!

1403
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:35,466
No!

1404
01:33:14,756 --> 01:33:16,423
They announced it.

1405
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:19,426
They announced it?

1406
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:20,636
Yeah.

1407
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:22,179
So?

1408
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:24,807
Three-cent stamp.

1409
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,017
Your mallard?

1410
01:33:27,269 --> 01:33:28,310
Yeah.

1411
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:31,021
That's terrific.

1412
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:33,023
It's just a three-cent.

1413
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:34,692
It's terrific.

1414
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:37,486
Hautman's blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

1415
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:40,239
People don't much use the three-cent.

1416
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:42,866
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1417
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:45,577
Whenever they raise the postage,

1418
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:47,538
people need the little stamps.

1419
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:49,373
Yeah?

1420
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,459
When they're stuck with a
bunch of the old ones.

1421
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:53,752
Yeah.

1422
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:55,879
I guess.

1423
01:33:57,382 --> 01:34:00,551
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1424
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:07,057
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1425
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:11,395
I love you, Margie.

1426
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,064
I love you, Norm.

1427
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:18,902
Two more months.

1428
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,074
Two more months.
