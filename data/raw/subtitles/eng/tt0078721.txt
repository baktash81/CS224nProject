1
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,868
- Ah. Come in, Mr. Webber.
- Hi, Covington. What happened?

2
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,037
I think we blew a fuse a minute ago.

3
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,539
It's as though somebody died.

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,667
- Come this way. Careful, now.
- Okay.

5
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,920
- Is Mr. Fallon here?
- Oh, yes, he's here.

6
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,006
Would you take this?
I'll check the fuse box.

7
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,216
- Yeah, sure, okay.
- Careful.

8
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,011
Hugh?

9
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,557
Hugh?

10
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,563
Surprise!

11
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,739
Is it 41 or 42?

12
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:44,747
...right in and chase the shepherds away

13
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:52,254
...right in and made my sunniest day

14
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,226
Happy birthday to you

15
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,646
Happy birthday to you

16
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,610
Happy birthday, dear George

17
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,741
Happy birthday to me

18
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,828
I go down on my knees to you.

19
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,262
How do you feel about 42?

20
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,809
- 42 what?
- Mm.

21
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,478
You know. Years.

22
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,191
It depends. How do you feel?

23
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,986
- I feel betrayed.
- Ohh.

24
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,822
Really?

25
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,282
Well...

26
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,493
You know...

27
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,829
...they say...

28
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,872
...you know who "they" are...

29
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,542
...that life begins at 40.

30
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,336
I spent the last...

31
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,880
...2 years...

32
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,219
...realizing they'd been
lying in their teeth.

33
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,517
I don't know. I think the last 2 years
have been rather good.

34
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,644
That's because you're 38.

35
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,938
- Keep your voice down.
- Ohh.

36
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,359
- Goodnight, George.
- Mm.

37
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,611
- Good night, Sam.
- Night, Sheila.

38
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,447
Night, Sheil.

39
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,327
Sam...

40
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,873
...I want you to promise me something.

41
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,584
Never!

42
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,632
Never throw me
a surprise party again.

43
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,432
- You're welcome.
- Oh, you know what I mean.

44
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,268
I'm going to fill out my night.

45
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,611
Could I have some more white wine,
Bacchus, my dear?

46
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,905
How you feeling, birthday boy?

47
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,532
Oh. Invalided.

48
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,784
You mean invalid?

49
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,496
I'm... Well, that, too...

50
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,791
...but I feel basically invalided,
like an invalid.

51
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,963
Remember what they say, George.
After 40, it's all patch, patch, patch.

52
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,590
Ugh. I'm going home.

53
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,260
- We're working here in the morning.
- Oh, goody, goody.

54
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,653
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

55
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,530
- How you doing?
- It's good to see you.

56
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,697
- How's the water?
- Great.

57
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,211
Oh. Thanks, Covington. Thanks.

58
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,801
Happily

59
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,557
Oh, baby, won't you and me

60
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,934
We had it made

61
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,647
Here, try this.

62
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,443
Put this in front of
"don't call it love."

63
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,946
- Oh, in front.
- Right. Try it.

64
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,323
If they ask you

65
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,660
You can say that
We ended happily

66
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,245
- And then have...
- Right.

67
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,747
But don't call it love

68
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,417
When you're talking to me

69
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,710
Great.

70
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,587
If they ask you

71
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,674
You can say that
We ended happily

72
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,510
But don't call it love

73
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,972
When you're talking to me

74
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,016
- Great. Yeah.
- Got it?

75
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,075
- I'm going home.
- Right.

76
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,077
How's Sam?

77
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,705
Oh. Sam's great.

78
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,749
Sam's mostly always great.

79
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,375
Can I have my jacket, please?

80
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,545
That sounds mostly intellectual,
not emotional.

81
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,213
I guess so.

82
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,092
I guess she'd be happier
if things were more emotional.

83
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,179
- I guess so would you.
- Ho-ho-ho.

84
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,640
For a man who's
never been analyzed...

85
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,392
I'd analyze you better
than that expensive shrink.

86
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,811
But you'd come out gay
and I couldn't do that to Sam.

87
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,064
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

88
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,568
- I'll give her your love.
- No. Give her yours.

89
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,434
He's no more than a man

90
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,942
Nothing special that you'd run to see

91
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,864
He's a child to be sure
At times insecure

92
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:58,078
But he pleases me

93
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,083
For when I'm in his arms

94
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:09,172
And the last little star slowly dies

95
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,509
I'm enchanted to be

96
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:17,848
The me that I see in his eyes

97
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,609
He's a man, nothing more

98
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,992
Sort of clumsy and absent of mind

99
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:43,623
Not the kind of a beau
I dreamed long ago

100
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,170
That I would find

101
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,258
He's my lover, my friend

102
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,890
What more could I ask him to be?

103
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,435
So in our little plot

104
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,024
The mystery is what he sees in me

105
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,865
Why is it I never doubt him

106
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:22,245
When I've known all along

107
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,207
Now and then

108
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:32,380
The very best of men must roam

109
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:39,888
Sure, I get lonely without him

110
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,976
But a man, right or wrong

111
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,563
The more you bind him

112
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:54,861
The less you find him home

113
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,491
He's no more than a man

114
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:07,749
Just a weaver of wishes and dreams

115
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:13,171
Very shy, insecure

116
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,423
He's a child...

117
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,761
Oh, shit!

118
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,024
- Hi.
- Hi.

119
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,901
- Are you hurt?
- No.

120
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,778
Would you mind stepping out?

121
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,619
- Do you have a license?
- Yeah.

122
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,296
Thank you.

123
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,591
Did you know
your license had expired?

124
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,885
- What?
- July 26.

125
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,803
Oh, no!

126
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,556
Yeah. Uh...

127
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,392
Do you have a registration?

128
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,478
- For the car.
- Um...

129
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,606
Yeah, sure.

130
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,849
Expired license, no registration...

131
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,269
...and reckless driving.

132
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,901
I think you'll need a lawyer to help you
with this one, Mr. Webber.

133
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,402
Yeah.

134
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,117
- See if you can get this thing started.
- Yeah. Thank you.

135
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,390
Go on, move it!

136
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,908
Marriage is a sacred commitment...

137
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,454
...designed on earth,
sanctified in heaven.

138
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,886
Consider these two rings.

139
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
Perfect circles...

140
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,099
...without beginning, without end...

141
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,602
...signifying God's eternal love
and devotion.

142
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,190
Where would we be without God's love?

143
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,278
One of the most glorious
of God's institutions...

144
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,156
...is the institution of marriage.

145
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,702
A union of two souls
swearing allegiance...

146
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:35,206
...and promising in God's name
to obey one another...

147
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,292
...until death do them part.

148
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,461
In today's world...

149
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,298
...it does well to consider
such a commitment.

150
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,302
For in the final analysis,
on the day of reckoning...

151
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,971
...we shall all be held to account.

152
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,476
The time has come
for David and Jenny...

153
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,645
...to make this commitment
to one another.

154
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,148
Do you, David, take Jennifer...

155
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,192
...as your lawful wedded wife...

156
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,235
...to have and to hold...

157
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,654
...in sickness and in health...

158
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,574
...from this day forward
till death do you part?

159
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,246
Ahh! Shit!

160
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,618
Hello!

161
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,039
Hi.

162
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,708
- Whose car?
- What?

163
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,919
- Whose car?
- It's a loaner.

164
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,922
- Jesus, George!
- Don't look.

165
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,216
What have you done
to your nose?

166
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,260
A bee flew in the car.

167
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,720
My God! You're lucky
you didn't have a wreck.

168
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,765
- I did have a wreck. I hit a police car.
- A police car?

169
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,644
Yes. And not just a police car.
A Beverly Hills police car.

170
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,398
- My God. Does it hurt?
- You bet your knickers it hurts.

171
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,567
Have you taken anything for it?

172
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,320
Four of your birth control pills.
I hope that's all right.

173
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,906
Try an antihistamine.

174
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,243
I don't like those.
They make me pregnant.

175
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,412
I'll start dinner.

176
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,247
Thank God for that.

177
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,429
Okay, what's up?

178
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,974
What do you mean?

179
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,102
I've been getting
strange vibrations.

180
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,192
Probably just a temporary...

181
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,486
...malfunction of my
biorhythms, dear.

182
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,988
Maybe you are allergic.

183
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,116
That bee sting's awfully close
to your frontal lobes.

184
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,161
Sit down. You'll just
screw things up in the kitchen.

185
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,496
- Go play the piano.
- I want to do my share.

186
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,584
- You shall, darling. Later.
- Ohh. Yeah!

187
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,007
Unbelievable.

188
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,186
Un-fucking-believable.

189
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,037
- Does that guy have a telescope too?
- Yeah.

190
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,457
- See anything interesting?
- Oh, yeah!

191
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,003
Hi, Sam!

192
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,506
Shit! She did it again.

193
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,049
The latest hike in OPEC oil...

194
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,136
That son of a bitch
has a bigger telescope than we have.

195
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,595
Not "we" have, "you" have.

196
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,558
I don't peep into somebody
else's windows to get my jollies.

197
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,727
You and your friend
are dirty old men.

198
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,186
He's not my friend.

199
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,564
He should be.
You know him intimately now.

200
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,943
I don't watch him, I watch his broads.
He's got a hell of a stable.

201
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,070
He must be good in the sack.

202
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,739
What's that got to do with it?

203
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,950
Unless he has a new
remote control screwing device...

204
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,328
...how can you keep
from watching him too?

205
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,580
I concentrate on the broads.

206
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,458
- He's around, isn't he?
- Why are you so het up?

207
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,919
You got the time or you want
to wait till after the late show?

208
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,467
First, I'm getting a little fed up...

209
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,971
...at sexually emancipated ladies
being referred to as "broads."

210
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,223
Second...

211
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,643
...I think a telescope aimed
at anything other than stars...

212
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:52,315
...is an invasion of privacy and
qualifies the voyeur as a peeping Tom.

213
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,859
And there's a very good law
against that.

214
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,112
Third, the first two
wouldn't bother me a bit...

215
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,782
...if you'd stop watching
so much television...

216
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,284
...and pay attention
to your bedroom guests.

217
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,453
This guest, in particular.

218
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,415
Now, you want to argue
or you want to make love?

219
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,794
Define "broad."

220
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,299
- Your definition or mine?
- I know yours.

221
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,135
A girl who screws around a lot.

222
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,346
- A hooker.
- A hooker's a hooker.

223
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,058
Their spreading their legs
doesn't make the terms interchangeable.

224
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,185
- What's the difference?
- A hooker sells it.

225
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,480
So does a broad.
A hooker makes the price going in.

226
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,651
Ahh. So by definition a broad
is less virtuous than a hooker.

227
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,488
As far as I'm concerned,
virtue has nothing to do with it.

228
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,826
As far as you or any man is concerned,
virtue has everything to do with it.

229
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,453
Listen, I just said "broad."

230
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,206
You applied a disparaging connotation
to the term.

231
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,542
Come on. Are you trying to tell me...

232
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,336
...that "broad" is not a term
used by men...

233
00:20:55,587 --> 00:21:00,675
- ...to describe women disparagingly?
- I'm just saying I didn't use it that way.

234
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,388
- Would you call me a broad?
- That depends.

235
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,224
On whether you watched me
through a telescope...

236
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,185
...while I fooled around
with your degenerate neighbor.

237
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,603
Okay, you define it.

238
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:17,608
First and foremost, I don't equate
the term exclusively with sex...

239
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,361
...voyeurism or, quote,
"degeneracy."

240
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,030
- You do that.
- So do you, but you won't admit it.

241
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:26,701
"Broad" to me is just another
colloquial term for "woman"!

242
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,953
Like "dame," "skirt"...

243
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,746
- "Moll."
- "Crumpet." "Moll."

244
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,958
I'm sure Dillinger never used
that word derogatorily.

245
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:38,880
For authority on female aggrandizement
consult the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List.

246
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,548
Let's look it up.

247
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,633
I want your definition, not Webster's.

248
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,636
I'm going to get
Monsieur Roget's definition.

249
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,221
You know my definition.

250
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,600
"Broad" means woman. Not good,
not bad, unless so designated.

251
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,102
You said a broad does it for money.

252
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,106
You said a hooker sells it.
I said so does a broad.

253
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,443
If a broad is a woman,
then women screw for money?

254
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,487
- Some women!
- Broads!

255
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:08,075
Some broads do it for other things,
but in a way, they sell it!

256
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,163
Here we are:
"Woman - dame, hen, petticoat."

257
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,249
"Slang or derogatory. Jane, broad."

258
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,920
Look. "Slang. Derogatory. Broad."

259
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,297
Okay? How about that, smartass?

260
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,634
You want to look up "derogatory?"

261
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,767
George...

262
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,647
Don't be a shitheel.

263
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,985
Whatever Monsieur Roget's
définition was...

264
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:47,281
...I was not using the term
in a derogatory fashion!

265
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,826
Some of my oldest and
dearest friends are broads!

266
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,828
- Including your mother.
- You bet!

267
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,163
I want a broad...

268
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:59,168
My maternal grandmother was one
of the greatest broads that ever lived.

269
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,296
They don't make "broads"
like that anymore.

270
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,550
- You know what's wrong with you?
- Male chauvinist pig.

271
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,926
Besides that.

272
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,721
You're gutless. You're afraid to admit
you blew it, and lose like a man.

273
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,140
I wouldn't mind losing
like a man...

274
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,644
...if you weren't so damned
determined to win like one!

275
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,689
Oh, Christ.

276
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,281
I've got an early call.

277
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,659
Um... Care to translate that?

278
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,579
Yup. It's getting late.
I think I'd better go.

279
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,877
From Hollywood, The Tonight Show...

280
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,546
...starring Johnny Carson.

281
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,881
This is Ed McMahon,
along with Doc Severinsen...

282
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,009
...and the NBC Orchestra,
inviting you...

283
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,137
...to join Johnny and his guest
Cloris Leachman.

284
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,849
From the Metropolitan Opera company,
Judith Blegen...

285
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,019
I thought we were
going to make love.

286
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,022
It'll cost you 50 bucks and an apology.

287
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,984
Here's Johnny!

288
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,219
Sam!

289
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,731
Oh, damn!

290
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,071
Oh, bollocks!

291
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,464
God.

292
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,237
Oh, God.

293
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,286
I give my heart

294
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,874
Just to one man

295
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,460
Loving...

296
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,462
I can't hear you, Fraser.

297
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,176
This too I swear

298
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,805
While I am there

299
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,599
- It's too soon.
- Keep going.

300
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,519
Didn't we have more tables
in San Francisco?

301
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,813
More tables, you know. Never mind.

302
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,860
I give my heart

303
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,113
I know my man

304
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,658
Hold it. You must spend
more time at the tables.

305
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,994
Did we have more tables
in San Francisco?

306
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,245
We did, but...

307
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,415
- Do you mind if I make a phone call?
- Go ahead.

308
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,375
Give everybody a 10, would you?

309
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,336
Okay. Everybody take 10, please.

310
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,010
Stage phone, please.

311
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,887
Sorry, that line's busy.

312
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,519
- Still busy.
- I'll hold.

313
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,573
Okay, over here!

314
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,373
Still busy.

315
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,960
Okay, thank you.

316
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,111
Does he do anything except
swim and jog on the beach?

317
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,738
Oh, yes.

318
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,742
He makes me happy, so I let him
swim and jog on the beach.

319
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,079
The more you do for him,
the more he rubs your nose in it.

320
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,834
Speaking of noses, why don't you keep
yours out of my personal affairs?

321
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:55,089
In return, I won't bring up that you've
acted like a spoiled child all morning.

322
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,760
I'm going to the market.
Anybody want anything?

323
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,595
No, but bring back the receipts.

324
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,764
George thinks you
take advantage of me.

325
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:08,269
Is that so?
Well, I suppose I do.

326
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,229
But then, nobody's perfect.

327
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,647
Oh, George is.

328
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
What a drag.

329
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,488
Hugh, sometimes you really are
a pain-in-the-ass fag.

330
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,368
Coming from one of the great
Anglo-Saxon heterosexual...

331
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,580
...bores of all time,
that's the ultimate compliment.

332
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,166
You've brooded and sulked
around my house all morning...

333
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:35,004
...without the good manners to explain
or apologize, and I'm fed up.

334
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,007
So you know what I'll do?
I'll call it a day.

335
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,594
I'll invite some company over
to soak up the strain.

336
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,846
Some happy, conversational...

337
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,724
...intellectually stimulating,
pleasant company.

338
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,518
The Malibu chapter
of the Sugar Plum Fairies?

339
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,731
As you don't qualify, you understand
why I don't ask you to stay.

340
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,900
I couldn't. I forgot my tutu.

341
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,069
Yeah, see you later, Butch.

342
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,422
- I won't be long.
- Don't be.

343
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,716
What does that mean?

344
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,093
It means go to the store
and come back.

345
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,888
Don't hang around
with your friends at the beach!

346
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,431
Don't get heavy with me.

347
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,725
I'll be back when I'm ready.

348
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,232
What were your thoughts
at the moment of this fixation?

349
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:43,280
That she was the most beautiful girl
I had ever seen.

350
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:47,618
Uh, on a scale from 1 to 10?

351
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,788
11.

352
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,957
You said there was
no such thing as a 10.

353
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,167
There's nothing unusual.

354
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,336
I was sitting at the stop sign.

355
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,630
I wasn't thinking anything special.

356
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,341
Suddenly there she was.
And I reacted.

357
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,844
I mean, I wasn't expecting
to see that vision.

358
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:10,182
What about the young girls
on the beach? And Larry?

359
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,017
I don't like...

360
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,147
...middle age.

361
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,985
I mean, it's not that complicated.
I'd just rather be 30.

362
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,070
Or 20, even.

363
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,408
God. If to make it, I had to
change places with Larry...

364
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,535
...and a life of faggotry...

365
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,746
...I'd sure as hell
give it consideration.

366
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,332
You don't consider that significant?

367
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,753
I'm just using an extreme example
to make a point.

368
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,382
If you could, wouldn't you
change places with Larry?

369
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,676
But I can't!

370
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,262
Didn't you ever
play games like that?

371
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,890
But not to the point
where I got all hung up with it.

372
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,437
You're becoming obsessed
with the ugliness of old age.

373
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,107
The fear of death.
The inevitability of it.

374
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,110
You'd change places
with a homosexual to put it off.

375
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,945
So what do you do?

376
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,697
You play it safe.

377
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,284
You get a fixation
on a beautiful young girl.

378
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,120
A "vision," I think
was your description.

379
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,790
And I suspect,
for your total vision...

380
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,500
...a virgin.

381
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,631
Yes?

382
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,927
Um, excuse me, reverend,
I was just driving by your church...

383
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,639
...and, uh, a thought struck me.

384
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,767
If it wouldn't be an imposition...

385
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,771
...and you could spare a few minutes,
I'd be eternally grateful.

386
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
By George!

387
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,024
Aren't you George...?

388
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,736
- Webber.
- Of course!

389
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,404
George Webber!

390
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,573
My goodness!

391
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,658
Well, come on in, George!

392
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,244
- Thank you.
- How wonderful!

393
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,164
You know, George,
I'm a songwriter too.

394
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,838
When you are near

395
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,258
Though we're under a cloud

396
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,178
Why do I hear

397
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,307
Rainbows that shine out loud

398
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,352
Why is there music

399
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,022
When I'm kissing your glove

400
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,733
Could it be

401
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,779
That I have an ear for love

402
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,825
Why, when you smile

403
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,827
Do those bells ding-a-ling

404
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,872
Turning my heart

405
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,043
Into a thumping thing

406
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,880
Glee clubs of moonbeams

407
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:51,343
Sing your name in the blue

408
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,639
When I hold you near
My love

409
00:32:56,182 --> 00:33:01,270
Look into my ear
My love

410
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:05,232
You'll see that what I say I hear

411
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,734
My love

412
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:11,572
Is true

413
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,492
Well?

414
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,120
Well...

415
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,706
Now, George, you must be
absolutely frank with me.

416
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,375
Yes. Well, frankly, I...

417
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,629
- I'm stunned.
- Do you think it's professional?

418
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,549
I think it's amazing.

419
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,260
You realize, I've loved music all my life.

420
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,596
Excuse us, Mrs. Kissel.

421
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,640
Loved it all my life.
Of course, I made a choice.

422
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,935
I'm not dissatisfied.
I took the right road.

423
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,688
- I think you did.
- But the music, you know.

424
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,774
- Always there, right?
- Oh, yes, yes.

425
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,944
Sometimes, though,
it gets to be almost too much.

426
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,781
I feel like chucking everything,
and just write, write.

427
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:59,161
Yes. Well, I think you should
stick with it, reverend.

428
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,622
You really did like it.

429
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,292
No. He that hath clean hands
and a pure heart...

430
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:08,670
...who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity...

431
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,591
Yes, yes. Quite.

432
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,770
All right,
Mrs. Kissel, we'll take care of it.

433
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,105
- She's been with me for ages.
- Yes.

434
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,068
It's all right.
You go on back to the kitchen now.

435
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,819
No damage done.

436
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,198
How old is she?

437
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:39,201
I honestly don't know.
I don't think she does.

438
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,838
Whenever Mrs. Kissel breaks wind,
we beat the dog.

439
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:57,928
I mean, the whole depersonalized lifestyle
that puts down anything traditional...

440
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,640
...and completely ignores many of our...

441
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,101
...socially most fundamental institutions.

442
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,978
Such as marriage, for instance.

443
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,939
Right on, George. Heh-heh-heh.

444
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,526
I think I'm fairly well
psychologically oriented.

445
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,862
I've talked to psychologists,
psychiatrists...

446
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,864
...welfare workers...

447
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,993
But when I drove by your church
today, I thought, "God!

448
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,494
Goodness...

449
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,248
...who better than somebody
who truly represents...

450
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,209
...the institution of marriage
and all it stands for?"

451
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,128
I'd be more than happy to help.

452
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,047
That's really marvelous.

453
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,175
Well, for instance,
compared to, say, 5 or 10...

454
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,802
You may not believe it...

455
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,555
...but just as many young people
are marrying today...

456
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,348
- ...as they were 10 years ago.
- Really?

457
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,891
Of course, there's a difference.

458
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,687
It fits right in
with this depersonalized concept.

459
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:53,400
So many don't seem able to relate
to the true meaning of the ceremony.

460
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,904
Mm. Can you be more specific?
Have you married any young people lately?

461
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:02,075
Yesterday I married
Jennifer Miles and David Hanley.

462
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,412
Perhaps you might know
the bride's father, Dr. Miles.

463
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,332
He's a very prominent
Beverly Hills dentist.

464
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,208
No. No.

465
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,401
- Theater.
- Stage phone, please.

466
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,988
All I possess is

467
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,033
Get the phone

468
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:46,828
Hello?

469
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,206
- Samantha Taylor, please.
- She's busy.

470
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,583
God, she's always busy.

471
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,837
My name is George Webber. I'm trying
to get a message to her. Can I do that?

472
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,257
- For Samantha Taylor? Who's calling?
- Right. George Webber.

473
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,052
- Webber.
- Could you spell that?

474
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,971
W-E-B-B-E-R.

475
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,641
- Got it.
- Hello? Hello?

476
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,935
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. If you could just tell her...

477
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,398
Hello? Oh, dammit!

478
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,839
Oh, God!

479
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,507
You have all the... Ohh!

480
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,023
Ahh! Shit! God!

481
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,194
Dammit. Ow!

482
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,865
Hey, I see him!

483
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,535
What's he doing?

484
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,077
Come on, George!

485
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,397
- Oh!
- Hello?

486
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,608
Hello!

487
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,616
I didn't want to bother you
but I'm leaving town tomorrow.

488
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,620
How long since you've had
your teeth checked?

489
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,915
God, I don't know. Uh...

490
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,960
My dentist is Dr. Shoup in New York.
Do you know him?

491
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,921
- No. Don't believe I do.
- Oh.

492
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,343
Open, please.

493
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,639
- Ahh!
- Shh.

494
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,269
How long since you've seen Dr. Shoup?

495
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,687
Couple of years.

496
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,439
- You've got six cavities.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

497
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,358
- Two of them are pretty bad.
- Really.

498
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,612
- Six cavities?
- This is the worst. See this shadow?

499
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,907
That's the nerve.
Lucky if we can save this tooth.

500
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,742
Oh. What?

501
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,913
- Who are my next appointments?
- Mrs. Phillips and Mr. Rodinsky.

502
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,667
Now open as wide
as you can, please. Wide. Wide.

503
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,003
See if you can cancel them.

504
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,799
And tell Janie that we may have
to work through the lunch hour.

505
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,347
You have to do them all now?
Couldn't we just do the bad ones?

506
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:39,269
Well, they're all bad. Two of them
really serious. But they're all bad.

507
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:43,815
Look, I can cancel my vacation
for a few days...

508
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,985
I'm afraid that wouldn't help very much.

509
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,822
In an emergency,
I can shift things around a bit.

510
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,992
But otherwise I'm booked solid
for the next month.

511
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,786
No, I think under the circumstances...

512
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,206
...better we just get it over with.
It won't be so bad.

513
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,502
Then you can take your vacation,
and as far as your teeth are concerned...

514
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,213
...you can relax and enjoy yourself.

515
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:13,386
- Beginning to feel the Novocaine?
- Yeah. My lips are tingling.

516
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,516
I enjoy your music.

517
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,730
The last time I was in New York,
Mrs. Miles and I saw, uh...

518
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,317
...Dream Boat!
That was your show, wasn't it?

519
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,568
- Uh.
Ha-ha-ha!

520
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,945
It was '67. '68.

521
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,864
- '68.
- '68.

522
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,242
That was a hell of a good show.

523
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,620
- That hurt?
- Not really.

524
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,086
Where are you going
on your vacation?

525
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,421
The Virgin Islands.

526
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,758
Mrs. Miles and I always go to Mexico.

527
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,219
- Oh.
- Las Hadas.

528
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,097
Lava tus dientes.

529
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,517
That's Spanish for "brush your teeth."

530
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,936
It's really terrific.

531
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,272
My daughter Jenny's there now
on her honeymoon.

532
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,795
- How are you?
- Not very well.

533
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,130
Pardon?

534
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,593
- This'll take a few minutes.
- Okay.

535
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,804
- Sir?
- Forget it.

536
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,472
Sure.

537
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,697
Hi, Mr. Webber.

538
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,953
Cup of coffee. Black coffee.

539
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,415
- Oh, coffee.
- Coffee.

540
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,418
That's all right.

541
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,941
Thank you.

542
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,172
Oh, Christ.

543
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,057
Hello?

544
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,478
- Hello?
- Who is this?

545
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,692
Is this 275-0817?

546
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,736
Yeah, yeah, it's George.

547
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,087
Hello?

548
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,121
Operator.

549
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:11,124
Operator, I'm having trouble
reaching 275-0817.

550
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,542
Could you try it, please?

551
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,599
Hello?

552
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,143
Hello?

553
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,736
- Operator.
- Would you get me the police?

554
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,665
- Josh?
- Yeah?

555
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,585
- I'm going out. I'll be back.
- Okay.

556
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,504
- Do your homework.
- I've already done it!

557
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,129
Oh, what?

558
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,071
What is this?
What's wrong? What's wrong?

559
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,991
- Pardon?
- What's wrong? What are you doing here?

560
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,785
We got a call from a Miss Taylor.

561
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,871
She spoke to this house.
A strange man answered.

562
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,917
He spoke gibberish,
made obscene sounds.

563
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,258
She was afraid Mr. Webber,
the tenant...

564
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,094
- That's me!
- ...met with foul play.

565
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,771
The prescription's for G. Webber.

566
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,816
Do you know Mr. Webber?

567
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,239
He wants to write something.

568
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,848
"My name is George Webber.

569
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,644
I just came from the dentist
where I had 6 cavities filled.

570
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,230
I have identification in the house."

571
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,857
Six?

572
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,112
You better take it easy.
Pain pills and alcohol don't mix.

573
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,864
You could've fooled me.

574
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,878
Oh, George! With the...

575
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,506
Come in. Step right in.

576
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,219
George?

577
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,015
George?

578
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,606
You go for it, George!

579
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,734
- Are you going for it?
- I'm going for it.

580
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,028
Oh, God! Anything.

581
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,420
I want to say something.

582
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,965
- I have a telescope.
- You do?

583
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,969
I look at him every day
and he looks at me.

584
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,264
I don't think I've been
so happy for years.

585
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,851
Come have a walk with me.

586
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:42,788
You miserable little son of a bitch!

587
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,811
- Yup?
- Sam?

588
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,604
Yep!

589
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,238
Oh, fuck! Uh.

590
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,468
Hello?

591
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,595
Aeromexico.

592
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,790
Damn you, George!

593
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,816
- George Webber.
- Would you please sign in?

594
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,623
Mr. Webber?

595
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,084
Buenos dias.

596
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,419
I'm Vicente, the assistant manager.

597
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,463
Welcome to Las Hadas.

598
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,180
Is that for me?

599
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,892
It's a custom here
at Las Hadas. It'll keep you cool.

600
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:41,605
- Can I drink on the way to the room?
- Of course.

601
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,948
We've got a very beautiful place here.

602
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,368
Look out!

603
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:04,837
I hope the maid has made up
the room. Good, she did.

604
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,297
Mr. Webber?

605
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,008
- Mr. Webber.
- Huh?

606
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,884
Right this way.

607
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,137
Mr. Webber, right this way.

608
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,767
- You must have had a rough flight.
- Huh?

609
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,937
- I said you must have had a rough flight.
- Nyeh.

610
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,189
These rooms are well-insulated.

611
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,525
You'll have peace and quiet.

612
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,235
And also, as I said...

613
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,072
...the view from the balcony
is magnificent.

614
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,831
Mr. Webber?

615
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,499
Mr. Webber?

616
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,071
- Hugh?
- Hm?

617
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:17,242
What is it about that miserable little
son of a bitch that makes me care?

618
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,329
- Well...
- I don't want to, you know.

619
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:24,875
He's more trouble than any man
I've ever known, including my ex-husband.

620
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:29,129
Apart from being uncommonly bright,
wonderfully witty...

621
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,216
...generous, occasionally lovable
and a genius...

622
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:34,718
...I can't think of a single thing.

623
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,138
- How about unnaturally belligerent?
- Oh, yes.

624
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,558
- Exhaustingly childish?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

625
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,228
We've nothing in common.

626
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,355
We're the original odd couple.

627
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,400
And when he really gets me going...

628
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:53,070
...I can't ask him to step outside
because he's too small.

629
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,075
I hope he's gone for good.

630
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,119
Well, he hasn't.

631
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,871
- He's going through male menopause.
- Come on.

632
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,125
All right.
Ladies have a biological edge...

633
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:10,796
...but most males over 40 make up for it
in the emotional department.

634
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,840
He's gone. I don't know where he is.

635
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,468
Nothing has happened to him.
Nothing sinister, that is.

636
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,264
It'll take him a while to find out
he's a certified imbecile.

637
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:24,643
He'll come home, tail between his legs
and settle down for good.

638
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,604
Lest ye judge harshly, remember...

639
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,649
- Nobody's perfect.
- Thank God.

640
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,655
Anyway, I'd still like to punch him
right in the mouth.

641
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,166
Buenos dias.

642
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,212
A very good evening to you.

643
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,840
Oh. I'd like strong black coffee
and some amphetamines.

644
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,510
Might I suggest the dining room?

645
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,386
And the local pusher.

646
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,722
In whatever order you
consider appropriate.

647
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,724
Yes, yes.

648
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,768
I'll settle for a brandy.

649
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,561
- Thanks.
- Certainly.

650
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,658
Cheers.

651
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,795
I think, one more time, basically.

652
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,549
If you still want coffee...

653
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,093
I've survived the crisis, thank you.

654
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,762
- Is there a phone I can use?
- Sure.

655
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,267
- Dial "9."
- Mm.

656
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,602
Thank you.

657
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,106
- Operator.
- Mm.

658
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,609
Hello, this is Mr. George Webber.

659
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,111
I'm in room...

660
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,698
I don't know what room I'm in.
Do you know?

661
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,951
- Yes. 104.
- Thank God. Thank you.

662
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:49,079
Could you do me a favor and get me...

663
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,415
...area code 213...

664
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:56,128
...655-2264?

665
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,338
Miss Samantha Taylor.

666
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,508
- Miss Samantha Taylor?
- Right. Thank you.

667
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,310
By what name are you known, sir?

668
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,812
I'm known by the name of "Donald."

669
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,232
"Don," to my friends
and paying customers.

670
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,445
In that case...

671
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,113
...another double, Don.

672
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,866
"Double Don."
That'll be hard to say...

673
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,993
...by the shank of the evening.

674
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,828
Better make that a single.

675
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,047
Hello? Yes.

676
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,591
- Sam!
- George?

677
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,094
Yes. Listen, you'll never guess
in a million years.

678
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,971
I'm in Mexico.

679
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:49,973
And I'm sitting in...

680
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,850
...the Las Hadas bar...

681
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,686
...having a brandy
with my old friend, Don.

682
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,940
- Say hello to Sam, Don.
- Hello, Sam.

683
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,485
Listen, I tried to call you
a dozen times.

684
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,863
When do you plan on coming back?

685
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,784
Hello? George?

686
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,661
Darling...

687
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,413
...I won't stay...

688
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,627
...a minute longer than I have to.

689
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,504
Just a couple of days...

690
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:24,049
...a couple of weeks.
I should have it all sorted out.

691
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,176
I love you too much...

692
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,553
...to put you through
all that rubbish.

693
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,347
I need... Ahem.

694
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,892
I need the time to be alone.

695
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,270
Okay?

696
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,440
Sam? Sam?

697
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,695
- Mm-hm?
- Say something.

698
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,364
Piss off, George!

699
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,671
They don't write music
like that anymore.

700
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,508
Well, not much anymore, anyway.

701
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,468
Is that good or bad?

702
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:10,429
What do you think?

703
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,851
I'm opposed to bartenders making
value judgments while on duty.

704
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,271
- For that matter, so is the management.
- Oh, poo-poo.

705
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,274
How old are you?

706
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,193
Thirty-seven. But I look 40.

707
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,321
No. You look 33.

708
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,283
That's because I'm really 25.

709
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:39,833
We are each of us
the product of an era.

710
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:44,087
That music is my era.

711
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,716
Beautiful melody.

712
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,262
Great lyric.

713
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,516
If you were 19...

714
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:00,437
...and 20 years from now...

715
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,400
...you were dancing with your wife...

716
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,862
...or girlfriend you knew
in high school...

717
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,990
...and you said to her, "Darling...

718
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,494
...they're playing our song"...

719
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,163
...do you know what they'd be playing?

720
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,333
"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?"

721
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,170
What the fucking hell
kind of era is that?

722
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,299
- To each his own.
- Ah. Now that's a good song.

723
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,116
What...

724
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:58,745
What is the sum total
of my indebtedness...

725
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,540
...to this establishment?

726
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,255
Name and room number.

727
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,806
I have left something
for your favorite charity.

728
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,850
- That's me.
- Why not?

729
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,144
- Good night, Don.
- Good night.

730
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,979
Mr. Webber...

731
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,274
And for what it's worth...

732
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,693
...I like your songs.

733
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:31,945
God.

734
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,949
Well...

735
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:42,664
You know something?
You suddenly don't look a day over 30.

736
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,920
Oh, Sam.

737
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,298
Come and save me, for chrissake.

738
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,854
- Hello?
- Josh.

739
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,606
- Yeah.
- Hi, it's George.

740
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:51,483
- How are you?
- Okay.

741
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,318
Let me speak to your mother.

742
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,070
She doesn't want to talk to you.

743
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,572
What do you mean?

744
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,409
Young man, go and tell her
I'm on the phone, right now!

745
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,203
Piss off, George!

746
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,816
I couldn't sleep.

747
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,193
- It's the brandy.
- Yeah.

748
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:39,197
- Let's get back to the doubles.
- How will that help you sleep?

749
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:42,367
I said I couldn't.
I didn't say I wanted to.

750
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,828
Live and learn, like I always say.

751
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,746
Oh, God.

752
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,457
What else do you always say?

753
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,418
I always say...

754
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,837
...down the hatch.

755
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,049
Up the rebels.

756
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,934
Hello.

757
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:14,858
Hello.

758
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,156
I don't mean to be rude,
but aren't you George Webber?

759
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:26,244
Yes, I am, and I don't think
you're being the teeniest bit rude.

760
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,371
Terrific.

761
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,167
I met you at Truman Capote's party.

762
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,088
- Terrific.
- My name is Mary Lewis.

763
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,925
- Congratulations, Mary Lewis.
- Thank you. Thank you.

764
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,059
Enid. Enid, darling. Have you met my wife?

765
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,479
I'm so pissed.

766
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:56,941
- She's lost her shape.
- She's going to enjoy this.

767
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,070
Nice room you have. Pretty.

768
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,074
- Oh!
- Oh, God!

769
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,658
I'm sorry.

770
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,161
Let me make it well.

771
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,709
I don't want you to be afraid.

772
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,146
George.

773
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,567
Is it me?

774
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,822
No.

775
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,323
Yes, it is.

776
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,576
Okay.

777
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,538
- Is it?
- No.

778
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,459
It is me, isn't it?

779
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,878
No.

780
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,092
This ever happen to you before?

781
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:10,473
Well, it's happened to me before.

782
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,522
Ta-da. Heh-heh-heh.

783
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,275
There was this...

784
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,279
...beautiful guy. Willis.

785
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:26,948
- Willis...
- Ackerman.

786
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,159
Willis Ackerman.

787
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:34,330
We slept together,
by actual count, 16 times.

788
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,044
No matter what we did or how,
he just couldn't manage.

789
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,380
That's terrible.

790
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:48,386
One time he got so crazy,
he just started punching the wall.

791
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,763
Hit it as hard as he could.

792
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,224
Broke the old hand in three places.

793
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,231
He swore he loved me.

794
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:04,777
He'd sit on that bed in the dark
and he would cry like a baby.

795
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,823
It never happened to him before,
he said.

796
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,495
We stopped seeing each other finally.

797
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:17,457
You know, he's got three kids now.

798
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,461
He's married
and he's got 3 kids in 4 years.

799
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,756
I think he's...

800
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,050
...worked his problem out.

801
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:32,514
Yeah, well, I was his problem
and he sure worked me right out.

802
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:42,106
So don't go punching any walls,
Georgie, huh?

803
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,776
Some of us...

804
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:48,029
...just don't bring out
the man in men.

805
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:52,909
Good night, sweet Georgie.

806
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,684
The sand is hot! Oh! Ah! Hot!

807
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,895
Oh, God.

808
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:31,614
The sand is hot.

809
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,999
God, bloody hell.

810
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,384
- Oh! Ha, ha.
- Sorry.

811
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:01,311
Ah! Ahh. Oh, God.

812
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,529
God.

813
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,058
Hello. Drink, sir?

814
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,268
Can I get you anything to drink?

815
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,604
Something cool, refreshing?

816
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,856
Can I soak my feet in it?

817
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,736
How about a Bloody Mary? You can stand
in the ocean while drinking it.

818
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,947
God, yeah.
That may be the suggestion of the week.

819
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,991
- Thank you.
- Okay.

820
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,296
Oh, God.

821
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:14,133
Think I'll go out
and get a surfboard.

822
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,765
Ow, ow! Damn! Damn!

823
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,726
Ah, fuck it!

824
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,521
- Here you go, sir.
- Oh, shit!

825
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,648
Here's your Bloody Mary.

826
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,151
- Would you like to drink it in the ocean?
- No, no.

827
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,863
- It's really warm in the ocean.
- No, no.

828
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:20,032
- I'll take you on my back. Come on.
- No.

829
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,185
- Okay here, sir?
- Yeah.

830
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,187
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

831
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,022
Enjoy yourself.

832
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:03,034
- He is a very enterprising young man.
- Mm. Yes, yes.

833
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,120
I must admit I feel a bit foolish.

834
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,166
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

835
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,673
I didn't get your name.

836
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,885
Webber. George.

837
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:24,096
- Collins. Bill.
- Hi. How are you?

838
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,891
- Switzer. Chuck.
- Hi.

839
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:31,395
Chuck refuses to be carried.

840
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,981
He used to be a Marine.

841
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,985
Oh, well. To Tripoli.

842
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,822
Semper fi.

843
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:58,256
I was in the Royal Air Force,
as a matter of fact.

844
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,635
I thought you had to be English
to be in that.

845
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:04,262
You do.

846
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:08,599
- You an English fellow, huh?
Mm-hm.

847
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,520
That's all right.

848
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:56,415
Sir. Can I get you anything else?

849
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:58,918
Yeah. Terrific.

850
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:00,586
How about a beer?

851
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:04,632
Uh. No, actually. Thanks.
I think I might go for a swim.

852
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,551
- If you need anything...
- I'll give you a shout.

853
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,153
- Surfboard?
- It's great. Can I get you one?

854
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,197
I've never really used one.

855
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:31,450
There's nothing to it. No big waves.
Just paddle around.

856
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,952
Sure it's not dangerous?

857
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,539
Absolutely. The hotel's had only
one accident since opening.

858
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:39,667
- That was because the dummy fell asleep.
- Fell asleep?

859
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,586
Yeah. He fell asleep on the board...

860
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,506
...drifted out to sea
and the currents got him.

861
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,177
The currents?

862
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,347
Past the point, there's heavy currents.
6 or 7 knots.

863
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:57,893
If you're on a surfboard or swimming,
that's it. You could end up in Peru.

864
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,773
- You mean he...
- Never found him.

865
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,317
But you don't fall asleep on a surfboard.

866
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,445
And you don't paddle out too far.

867
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:11,032
- Well, maybe tomorrow.
- What about sailing?

868
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,244
- Great sport.
- Maybe. I'll see you later.

869
01:21:15,829 --> 01:21:17,038
Adios.

870
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:09,126
Hey! Hey! Hey!

871
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:17,551
Come on!

872
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,465
Against odds
and without thought for his own safety...

873
01:24:56,716 --> 01:24:59,218
...George Webber, composer,
playwright...

874
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,637
...and winner
of four Academy Awards...

875
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:05,224
...braved treacherous waters
to save a drowning man.

876
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:08,102
David Hanley, 23,
and his bride, Jennifer...

877
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,730
...are honeymooning at
the Las Hadas Hotel in Mexico.

878
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,734
David fell asleep on his surfboard
and drifted out to sea.

879
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:16,944
I've got to call Sam!

880
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:21,073
...told me how dangerous
it is in the currents.

881
01:25:21,283 --> 01:25:22,908
I was out in the boat...

882
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,493
...and I decided...

883
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:28,330
...there wasn't time to go for help,
so I went after him.

884
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,124
Hello? Hello?

885
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:34,169
- George Webber, please.
- One moment please.

886
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,923
- To your very good health.
- Thank you, Don.

887
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:39,466
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

888
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,307
- Lounge.
- Mr. Webber, please.

889
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:47,766
Wait one moment.

890
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,311
- Are you in?
- No, no.

891
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:54,940
Listen, Kitty,
until otherwise instructed...

892
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,860
...Mr. Webber'll be incommunicado.

893
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,571
Oh, my God! Where's that?

894
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,490
About 20 miles east,
and make a left turn.

895
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,368
Okay. Thank you, Don.

896
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:10,331
Clever girl. She wanted to know
where "communicado" was.

897
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,916
Oh, it's very obvious.

898
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,377
It's a stone's throw from "cognito."

899
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,380
Sorry.

900
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,923
Sorry.

901
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,974
This is the new one, Hugh.

902
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,455
That's beautiful.

903
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:23,959
More, Georgie.

904
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,503
Play "Funny Valentine."

905
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,757
You don't remember?
I played that for you already.

906
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:32,175
You did?

907
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:35,304
At Truman Capote's party.

908
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,973
Gosh, I don't remember.

909
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,935
Are you sure?

910
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,564
I play it at every party.

911
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:55,490
Keep a light in the window.
I may be back.

912
01:30:55,658 --> 01:30:57,909
- Right, mate.
- Oh, yes.

913
01:31:16,512 --> 01:31:18,430
- Who is it?
- Uh, George Webber.

914
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,185
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were in the shower.

915
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:24,645
Oh, no, no. Come in.

916
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:27,439
I tried to call,
but you weren't in.

917
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:30,108
I'll just slip into a robe. Come in.

918
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:35,697
There's a bar if you want a drink.

919
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:37,366
There's a joint in the ashtray.

920
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:04,893
I didn't get home
from the hospital until 8:00.

921
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,436
How is your husband?

922
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,356
He's got a terrible sunburn.

923
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:11,692
He'll lie on his stomach for days.

924
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:14,319
It could have been much worse.

925
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,322
- Wouldn't you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

926
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,908
- Some grass?
- No, no, no.

927
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:23,495
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes.

928
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,418
You know my father.

929
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:31,461
- Yes.
- He says you're his patient.

930
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:34,089
- Dr. Miles, D.D.S.
- That's right.

931
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,259
Well, isn't that wild?

932
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:40,220
Yeah.

933
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:41,972
You wouldn't believe this.

934
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,891
About two weeks ago,
David and I saw you on Dinah Shore.

935
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,143
Oh, right.

936
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:50,188
To be honest, I didn't know
who you were or what you did.

937
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:54,860
But I said to David,
"There's a really attractive older man."

938
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:57,696
Oh. Well, that's nice.

939
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:01,283
And you've written all those songs.

940
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:03,660
- A few.
- Elevator music.

941
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,788
God! Elevator music.

942
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:11,001
The music in elevators.
Lots of violins.

943
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:14,171
I know what you mean.
I'm very big in elevators.

944
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:23,680
- And here you are.
- Yeah.

945
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,768
You saved my husband's life.

946
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,021
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

947
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,482
Yeah, I suppose it is.

948
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:36,651
Did you know we were
on our honeymoon?

949
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,988
- No.
- We were married Friday.

950
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:46,536
- Not much of a honeymoon.
- It doesn't matter.

951
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:50,332
We lived together two years.
We only did it for the family.

952
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:53,001
My father's just right of Attila the Hun.

953
01:33:56,881 --> 01:34:00,300
- May I ask you something, Mr. Webber?
- If you call me George.

954
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:02,969
I haven't eaten all day.

955
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:07,140
Well, in that case
let me take you out to dinner.

956
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,685
That's what I was going
to ask you, George.

957
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:07,617
Pretty song.

958
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,707
"Esta noche, la paso contigo."

959
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,085
What does that mean?

960
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:21,715
Tonight I spend with you.

961
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:37,958
Tell me something, sweet Donald.

962
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:42,504
What's fair about a man...

963
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,005
...getting older...

964
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:48,343
...and looking more distinguished
and worldly...

965
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:52,973
...and a woman getting older
and looking old?

966
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:58,436
There's nothing fair about that.

967
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:03,733
Yeah.

968
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,921
No, I'm...

969
01:37:26,298 --> 01:37:28,258
...just fine.

970
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:34,431
I wasn't expecting Prokofiev.

971
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:38,685
I saw Romeo and Juliet
at the Royal Opera House...

972
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:41,896
...when I was 16,
with Nureyev and Fonteyn.

973
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:44,315
It really wiped me out.

974
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,153
I like different music for different things.

975
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:51,698
I like to listen to rock.

976
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,658
I like to dance to jazz.

977
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,286
What do you do to Prokofiev?

978
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,040
Fuck.

979
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:07,964
And not only Prokofiev. Ravel.

980
01:38:10,634 --> 01:38:12,469
Did you ever do it to Ravel's "Bolero"?

981
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,387
No.

982
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:26,149
My uncle turned me on to it.

983
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:31,738
My stepmother's younger brother.

984
01:38:33,491 --> 01:38:36,868
I spent weekends at his house.
I was at school in England.

985
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:42,040
Uncle Fred said "Bolero" was the
most descriptive sex music ever written.

986
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:45,794
And he proved it.

987
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:19,327
George?

988
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,246
I forgot the joint.

989
01:39:21,497 --> 01:39:22,664
What, now?

990
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:31,983
Oh, God, you beautiful thing!

991
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:35,153
Better hurry or you'll have to start it again.

992
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,822
The music.
You'll have to start it again.

993
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,544
- Start it again!
- What?

994
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:55,965
It's better if you start right
at the beginning. Please?

995
01:41:00,262 --> 01:41:01,638
Hurry!

996
01:41:04,558 --> 01:41:05,683
Oh, shit.

997
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:17,612
It's all right. It's a long piece.

998
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,368
Oh, God. Oh, Jenny.

999
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:28,498
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1000
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:35,713
Ah, ah, ah! Ow, my hair!

1001
01:41:36,882 --> 01:41:38,258
Oh, I'm sorry.

1002
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:51,729
- What?
- It's better if I'm on top.

1003
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:54,065
Oh, okay.

1004
01:42:04,243 --> 01:42:05,576
- What?
- A feather!

1005
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:07,870
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1006
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:12,375
- Maybe it's better if we go the other way.
- Okay.

1007
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:28,224
- Now what?
- It's stuck!

1008
01:42:28,434 --> 01:42:30,393
It's not. Really, don't be afraid.

1009
01:42:30,602 --> 01:42:32,770
The record is stuck!

1010
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:35,481
The record!

1011
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:37,191
Oh, Christ.

1012
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:39,235
Fix it, please!

1013
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,616
Finally.

1014
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:54,417
- Oh, Jesus!
- I don't believe it!

1015
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:58,796
Hello?

1016
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:01,716
Oh, hi, baby.
How do you feel?

1017
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,010
It's David.

1018
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,305
George Webber.
We went out to dinner.

1019
01:43:07,806 --> 01:43:10,308
George Webber,
the man who saved...

1020
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:12,185
Right, right.

1021
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:15,646
Hold on. He wants to talk to you.

1022
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:20,234
He wants to thank you.

1023
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,112
Hi, David.

1024
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:27,158
Yeah. Oh, no big deal.

1025
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:29,494
No, it's my pleasure.

1026
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,871
Yeah, she's...

1027
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:33,664
We had a nice dinner.

1028
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:37,001
And we were just sitting around talking.

1029
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:42,256
I was just getting ready to leave.

1030
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:46,511
Sure will. Okay, nice talking to you.

1031
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:52,058
Hi. You sound like you're
really out of it.

1032
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:54,018
Beautiful. I envy you.

1033
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:55,645
You'd better get some sleep.

1034
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:57,855
I'll be there about 11:00.

1035
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:00,525
Okay. All right. Bye.

1036
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,986
They just gave him a shot of Demerol.
He's really out of it.

1037
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:05,863
Oh, God.

1038
01:44:18,877 --> 01:44:20,670
Oh, fuck! Ow.

1039
01:44:32,724 --> 01:44:34,142
Hold it.

1040
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:40,189
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1041
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:42,942
Why me?

1042
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:45,987
What do you mean?

1043
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:49,866
Tonight! Me. This.

1044
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,951
Why not?

1045
01:44:59,042 --> 01:45:01,419
Are you bothered
because my old man called?

1046
01:45:01,587 --> 01:45:03,212
God, aren't you?

1047
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:04,630
No.

1048
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:07,383
And what about this?

1049
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,052
- I don't understand.
- Oh, come on.

1050
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,888
This! Us!

1051
01:45:12,222 --> 01:45:13,556
What about it?

1052
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:15,725
Why the hell get married?

1053
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:19,103
I got married because I wanted to.

1054
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:25,860
A week later you have an affair with
the man who saved your husband's life!

1055
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:31,699
- Oh, wow!
- Oh, Jenny.

1056
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,409
"Oh, wow"?

1057
01:45:33,994 --> 01:45:36,078
I don't understand that thinking.

1058
01:45:36,246 --> 01:45:37,914
Well, evidently not.

1059
01:45:41,543 --> 01:45:43,711
Five minutes ago
you weren't worried about him.

1060
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,838
- Oh, boy.
- Or whether I was married.

1061
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:48,257
The hell I wasn't!

1062
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,261
How do you act
when you're not worried?

1063
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:58,726
I thought maybe you thought
I was more than just a casual lay.

1064
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:00,937
Why'd you think that?

1065
01:46:01,104 --> 01:46:03,439
Oh, great. Thank you. Terrific.

1066
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:10,029
Because I thought you were something
different. Something special!

1067
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,616
I am. As far as I'm concerned,
I'm very special.

1068
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:16,911
If I sleep with someone,
it's because I want to.

1069
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:20,289
- Mm-hm.
- I enjoy it. It pleases me.

1070
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:21,958
Jolly good!

1071
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:23,960
It's okay if your husband does it?

1072
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:26,546
If it makes him happy.

1073
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:28,923
Nothing wrong with being happy...

1074
01:46:29,132 --> 01:46:31,801
...but there's more to life than
screwing to Ravel's "Bolero."

1075
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:33,469
Sure there is.

1076
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:36,556
But what's wrong with screwing
to Ravel's "Bolero"?

1077
01:46:36,807 --> 01:46:41,269
It depends why you're doing it
and with whom you're doing it...

1078
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:42,645
...with.

1079
01:46:42,854 --> 01:46:44,981
If I thought that much, I'd be a virgin!

1080
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:46,649
Oh, look, Jenny!

1081
01:46:46,858 --> 01:46:49,318
George, are you happy?

1082
01:46:51,446 --> 01:46:53,281
Let me see...

1083
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,993
Um... No.

1084
01:46:57,703 --> 01:46:59,161
Not at this minute.

1085
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,830
Neither am I.

1086
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:05,001
But I was,
and I intend to be again soon.

1087
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:09,463
I don't know your problem
but you won't solve it by solving mine.

1088
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:13,009
- Fine.
- And I don't think I really have a problem.

1089
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:17,388
That's your problem.

1090
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:45,374
- George?
- Hmm?

1091
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:48,878
Would you turn off the record?

1092
01:48:11,818 --> 01:48:17,448
I give my heart

1093
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:24,580
Just to one man

1094
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:31,128
I give my heart

1095
01:48:31,546 --> 01:48:35,925
To one man

1096
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:40,930
Alone

1097
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,823
- They loved it.
- At $8.50 a crack, I'm lucky.

1098
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:03,285
- What's up?
- George fucking Webber!

1099
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:21,303
Hello, Mr. Webber. Come in.

1100
01:49:21,972 --> 01:49:23,639
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

1101
01:49:25,475 --> 01:49:27,226
- Is she expecting you?
- No.

1102
01:49:27,436 --> 01:49:30,104
- I'd better let her know you're here.
- Okay.

1103
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:35,818
Mrs. Taylor?

1104
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:38,821
- Yes?
- Mr. Webber's here.

1105
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,368
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

1106
01:49:53,503 --> 01:49:54,837
Your phone's out of order.

1107
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:56,797
No, it's not.

1108
01:49:57,007 --> 01:49:58,507
It's been busy all day.

1109
01:49:58,884 --> 01:50:00,384
It's Josh talking to his dad.

1110
01:50:02,763 --> 01:50:07,183
I... I got back this afternoon.
I thought I'd surprise you.

1111
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:09,143
You did.

1112
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:13,898
Uh... Maybe you'd like to go have dinner?

1113
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,568
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

1114
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:19,695
I'm having dinner with Bernie Kaufman.

1115
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:24,658
- How come?
- Because he asked me.

1116
01:50:25,327 --> 01:50:27,995
Mom? Dad wants to talk to you.

1117
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:31,415
He wants me to come
to Southampton for Easter.

1118
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:34,210
- Oh, hi, George.
- Hi, Josh.

1119
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,212
You mad at me?

1120
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:37,963
Yeah.

1121
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,174
Mom says I should apologize.

1122
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:45,888
I think you should apologize
because you want to...

1123
01:50:46,056 --> 01:50:47,556
...not because of your mother.

1124
01:50:48,099 --> 01:50:50,643
- What if I don't want to?
- Uh...

1125
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:52,228
Then don't.

1126
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,108
- Okay, I won't.
- Why the hell not?

1127
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:00,861
- Hi.
- Hi.

1128
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:03,072
I'm Bernie Kaufman.
Your mom expects me.

1129
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:04,824
She's on the phone.

1130
01:51:05,867 --> 01:51:08,577
I'll apologize to you
if you apologize to Mom.

1131
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:11,372
- Why should I do that?
- Because you've been a real shit!

1132
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:13,582
- You little...
- I'll tell her you're here.

1133
01:51:15,418 --> 01:51:17,878
- Bernie Kaufman.
- Hi. George Webber.

1134
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:20,589
Okay, I'll see you later.

1135
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:27,096
- You two know each other?
- I think we just met.

1136
01:51:27,264 --> 01:51:28,931
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hi

1137
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:31,642
- You know where the Scotch is.
- No, I don't.

1138
01:51:31,935 --> 01:51:33,018
Make yourself at home.

1139
01:51:33,186 --> 01:51:34,979
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

1140
01:51:46,074 --> 01:51:47,116
Yes?

1141
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,786
- What did you do, work all night?
- I did. Was it worth it?

1142
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:52,580
As a matter of fact, it was.

1143
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:54,373
One of your better lyrics.

1144
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:57,668
I was inspired by
one of your better melodies.

1145
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,172
You don't sound happy.

1146
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:05,301
I've always gone on
the premise that...

1147
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:07,887
...to be happy,
you have to feel happy.

1148
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:09,763
How's Larry?

1149
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,475
He's traveling abroad.

1150
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:16,270
I got a telegram saying
he might come back.

1151
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:18,314
But due to some...

1152
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:22,318
...foolish pride,
I don't think I'll take him back.

1153
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,529
Have you seen Sam?

1154
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:29,700
She's going out to dinner
with Bernie Kaufman.

1155
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,163
Don't do as I do. Do as I say.

1156
01:52:34,539 --> 01:52:36,624
Kill if you must, but don't lose her.

1157
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:39,793
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1158
01:53:00,982 --> 01:53:04,985
It's easy to say

1159
01:53:06,821 --> 01:53:08,656
It's over

1160
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,703
It's easy

1161
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:16,705
To say

1162
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:21,210
We're the best of friends

1163
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:27,508
You walk away and for a while

1164
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:32,388
You try the summer

1165
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:36,183
Of a younger smile

1166
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:42,982
But the memory never ends

1167
01:53:48,363 --> 01:53:52,574
You could lose your mind

1168
01:53:53,576 --> 01:53:56,412
But then you'll find

1169
01:53:59,582 --> 01:54:03,293
It's easy to say

1170
01:54:05,213 --> 01:54:06,547
I love you

1171
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,722
There's only one way to say

1172
01:54:15,306 --> 01:54:18,017
I love you

1173
01:54:19,769 --> 01:54:23,397
You could search the years away

1174
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:28,360
That old cliché

1175
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,280
Is the first of May

1176
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:32,781
Too old...

1177
01:54:33,575 --> 01:54:36,618
...for new love

1178
01:54:39,164 --> 01:54:42,624
It's easy to say

1179
01:54:44,919 --> 01:54:46,754
It's easy

1180
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:50,632
As A, B, C

1181
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:56,138
I love you

1182
01:54:58,808 --> 01:55:00,893
Love you

1183
01:55:04,355 --> 01:55:06,523
Love you

1184
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:13,363
That is pretty.

1185
01:55:14,365 --> 01:55:16,825
Yeah. Thank you.

1186
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:21,705
I was going to call it,
"I Love You, Samantha"...

1187
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:24,833
...but some old hack
got there before me.

1188
01:55:25,335 --> 01:55:27,503
It's the thought that counts.

1189
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,254
Yeah.

1190
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:34,676
- Sam?
- Hm?

1191
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:42,059
Do you want to get married?

1192
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:53,654
No.

1193
01:55:56,699 --> 01:55:58,242
Why not?

1194
01:55:58,409 --> 01:56:00,202
Just as a matter of interest.

1195
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:03,705
We spend too much time
arguing and not enough making love.

1196
01:56:03,915 --> 01:56:06,708
I could work on that.

1197
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:10,087
You know, just reverse that trend.

1198
01:56:10,713 --> 01:56:13,257
Make a lot of love,
and just that much arguing.

1199
01:56:13,508 --> 01:56:16,051
- As easy as that?
- You've got it.

1200
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:18,554
It would make a difference.

1201
01:56:18,721 --> 01:56:21,181
So you'll think about it?

1202
01:56:22,183 --> 01:56:24,059
- Unless you want to argue.
- Oh, no.

1203
01:56:25,895 --> 01:56:27,729
I want to make a cup of coffee.

1204
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:37,573
And think about it.

1205
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:46,748
- Any action?
- Ehh.

1206
01:56:47,208 --> 01:56:50,377
She's in the kitchen.
He's playing the piano.

1207
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:52,713
And I've had it!

1208
01:56:53,548 --> 01:56:55,215
That's it, George!

1209
01:56:55,425 --> 01:56:59,261
For one year I've been providing
X-rated entertainment...

1210
01:56:59,470 --> 01:57:02,806
...and you reciprocate with PG!

1211
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:06,059
It's an iniquitous arrangement!

1212
01:57:07,187 --> 01:57:09,980
- What's iniquitous?
- I show him mine, he don't show his!

1213
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:13,275
Come on, Rapunzel.
From now on, we do it in the dark!
