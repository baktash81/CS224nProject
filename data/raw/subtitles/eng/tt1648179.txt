1
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,563
Oh, no.

2
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,471
Let's go. Come on.

3
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:52,094
And that is how a baby
antelope comes into the world.

4
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,007
The window,
obviously, would be...

5
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,554
Oh, hey, Principal Betcher.

6
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,936
The window would
be the birth canal,

7
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,187
whereas the whole building,

8
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,514
that... That's your
mother right there.

9
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,520
You're late, again.

10
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,101
No, I was just...
I was just giving a lesson.

11
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,024
I warned you, if you
were late one more time,

12
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,446
I would dock you
a vacation day.

13
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,392
You were serious about that?

14
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,611
Oh, yeah, dead serious.

15
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,619
Come on, pal.
I was teacher of the year.

16
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,862
That was 10 years ago.

17
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,289
Feels like eight,
though, right?

18
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,033
You got bus duty today.

19
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,871
Today, I can't,
'cause I, you know,

20
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,749
I volunteer down
at the youth center.

21
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,375
Not true.

22
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,375
Okay.

23
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,630
Everybody, open up your books

24
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,553
to whatever we were
working on yesterday.

25
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,005
Yesterday was Sunday.

26
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,428
Just get to work, okay?

27
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,055
Mr. Voss?

28
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,652
Mr. Voss, our textbook

29
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,324
says that
the discovery of penicillin

30
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,818
was the most important
biological discovery

31
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,489
of the 20th century.

32
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,825
But I read online
that this actually encourages

33
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,573
more potent strains
of infection.

34
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,495
Yeah, that's some very
advanced, college-y stuff.

35
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,576
Look, if you're done
with your work,

36
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,753
just go sit down and draw
on your desk like Martinez.

37
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:05,920
But I want to know.

38
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,088
Because if
the textbook is wrong...

39
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,715
Malia, the chances
of you actually using

40
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,337
anything you learn
in this class,

41
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,464
probably zero.

42
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,837
And I don't know if you
heard Mr. Betcher or not,

43
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,172
but, technically,
this is my vacation time now.

44
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,473
So I'm going to shut
her down for a few.

45
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,328
Oh, no, no, no, not today.
Not today. Come on.

46
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,421
Oh.

47
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,718
Bonus.

48
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,383
Now, remember,
please, listen to each other.

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,676
Help each other.
Inspire me.

50
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,187
This never happened.
We clear?

51
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,482
Join in.
Be together now.

52
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,404
Here we go!

53
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,598
Second violins, don't
overpower the first violins.

54
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,763
That's why you're
called "second."

55
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,778
I hear improvement
coming in the door.

56
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,625
Nice and subtle.

57
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,962
And you're done.
Thank you.

58
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,798
Mr. Streb.

59
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,963
Oh, right,
the quote of the day.

60
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,882
I forgot the quote
of the day. All right.

61
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,800
I think I'm going to go

62
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,140
with a rock star
of philosophers,

63
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,808
Friedrich Nietzsche.

64
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,144
And he said...
Dan, drumroll, please.

65
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:36,321
"Without music,
life would be a mistake."

66
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,306
Nice.

67
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,402
Who's going to practice?
Who's going to...

68
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,205
I don't believe one of you.
Get out of here.

69
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,664
You were great today.

70
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,913
Mr. Voss.

71
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,876
And what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

72
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, the music.
I heard the music.

73
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,415
Sounds great.
Yeah.

74
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,000
They really bring the heat,
these kids, huh?

75
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,127
Listen, I have
a huge favor to ask.

76
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,429
I have bus duty, and I was...

77
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,097
Okay, hold that thought.

78
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,346
I'm expecting this.
This...

79
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,682
See, the thing is,
my Aunt Cora,

80
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,933
she threw her hip out again.

81
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,229
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it's nasty.

82
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,520
It's a nasty
hip-out thing.

83
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,776
And these pins and rods,

84
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,194
they're not even
connected to anything,

85
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,359
they're just loose. And I
wouldn't just ask anybody,

86
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,357
but I've seen how you are

87
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,702
with the whole
bus safety situation.

88
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,545
You handle it like...
I'm not going to...

89
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,489
Yeah, I'm going to
say it, you have a gift.

90
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,162
And...
Is everything all right?

91
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,461
You teach biology.

92
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,292
You know the body.

93
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,509
What are the chances of a
48-year-old woman being pregnant?

94
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,817
Well, it depends
what she looks like.

95
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,674
I'm just kidding.

96
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,635
That's more of
a fertility question.

97
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,398
My wife is pregnant.

98
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,651
No one knows.
It's still very early.

99
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,070
Please, please keep this
between you and me.

100
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,989
Are you kidding me? That...
It goes right in the vault.

101
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,941
That is locked.
Locked away. Wow.

102
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,150
Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,031
How old are you?

104
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,741
Old.

105
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,693
Oh. Congrats, right? I mean...

106
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,836
Well, yeah.

107
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,048
It's beautiful.

108
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,340
I mean, my son is 22.

109
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,508
He just finished college.

110
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,755
I thought I was
done writing checks.

111
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
Yeah.

112
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,508
I'm going to have a baby.
Yeah.

113
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,385
I'm going to have a baby.

114
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,054
Oh, you went low.

115
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,517
Okay. All right.

116
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,515
Wow. And thanks
for the bus duty, doing that.

117
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,686
I really appreciate it.

118
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,355
You want the vest on the chair

119
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,933
or just go with the... I'm
going to go with the desk.

120
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,939
I'm just going to put
it on the desk, okay?

121
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,274
Baby! We're having a baby!

122
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,609
Baby!

123
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,778
<i>Can we take our seats, people?</i>

124
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,610
<i>Come on in.
We're about to begin.</i>

125
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,908
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

126
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,120
You believe this guy?
All right, we're sitting.

127
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,623
<i>Plenty of seats.
Come on in.</i>

128
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,243
How much food do you think
is stuck in that beard?

129
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,965
I don't know, but I can
see corn from here.

130
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,964
Oh, yeah. You dip that beard
in hot water, you got ramen.

131
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,275
Hey, Bella. You know, I waited
for you for like three hours.

132
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,303
You waited? Where?

133
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,867
The bowling alley.
We had a date.

134
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,427
No, we didn't.

135
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,430
You asked me, and I said no.

136
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,637
No, it went... I said, "If
you want to go, just say no,

137
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,282
and we'll both know
it's code for yes."

138
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,505
You didn't really go, did you?

139
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,316
I did.
I waited for two hours.

140
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,517
You said three.

141
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,727
Yeah, but, you know,

142
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,232
actually, it's pretty hard
to see your watch

143
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,313
when you've been crying.

144
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,984
Okay, giving you
one last chance here.

145
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:30,237
You've already given me
15 last chances, Scott.

146
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,239
How about this?
I swing by...

147
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,494
No.

148
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,828
0 for 16.

149
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,493
<i>Hello?</i>

150
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,253
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

151
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,083
<i>As several of you already know,</i>

152
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,668
<i>Wilkinson High School
has been operating</i>

153
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,797
<i>at a budget deficit
for several years.</i>

154
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,845
<i>Assistant Principal Elkins
and I have already conferred</i>

155
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,177
<i>with your union to try
to minimize the impact</i>

156
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,224
<i>on the classrooms,
but, unfortunately,</i>

157
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,553
<i>I have to make
some serious cuts.</i>

158
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,514
<i>Starting immediately, we'll
be freezing all supplies,</i>

159
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,438
<i>and, unfortunately, we have to roll
back to last year's pay scales.</i>

160
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,603
Joke's on him. I didn't get
a raise this year anyway.

161
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,771
Me, either.

162
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,112
<i>Also, despite best efforts,</i>

163
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,695
<i>we are cutting all
extracurricular activities,</i>

164
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,322
<i>which includes the debate club,</i>

165
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,123
<i>the music program,</i>

166

<i>the annual senior
class field trip...</i>

167
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,952
Excuse me?

168
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,787
You're talking about cutting
the music program?

169
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,292
You're actually
going to cut music?

170
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,262
<i>I'm sorry. We simply
don't have the funds.</i>

171
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,089
No, wait a minute,
Mr. Betcher.

172
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,886
We're talking
about Marty's job here.

173
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,409
How about all
the money we raised

174
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,886
in the car wash or
the silent auction?

175
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:37,388
Miss Flores, after expenses,
we only netted $750.

176
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,101
It's a drop in the bucket.

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,313
<i>"Verbis defectis
musica incipit. "</i>

178
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:47,405
That's Latin for, "Music
takes us where word cannot."

179
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,399
I mean, what about
the athletic program?

180
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,990
Those football players, they
get new jerseys every year.

181
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,328
<i>Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

182
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,283
<i>Are you trying to equate your music
program with the football team?</i>

183
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,409
<i>Are you aware that
the Booster Club alone</i>

184
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,420
<i>accounts for one-third
of our charitable donations?</i>

185
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,081
<i>This is a budget question.</i>

186
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,090
And I just need
a little bit of that budget.

187
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,466
I've got 60 kids
with dented instruments.

188
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,587
<i>Marty, what's your point?</i>

189
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,676
Music helps the kids with...

190
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,470
<i>With math. The kids... The
kids don't raise money.</i>

191
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,305
<i>This is about a budget.
Well, I...</i>

192
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,019
<i>I know how important...
You don't know.</i>

193
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,183
<i>Take a seat.</i>

194
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,102
Come on. Why don't you just
take it easy on the guy?

195
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,265
<i>Excuse me?</i>

196
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,766
Let it go. Let it go.

197
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,773
Just back off him,
and let's move on already.

198
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,442
<i>Why don't you not
tell me how to do my job?</i>

199
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,485
Okay, and then why don't
you tell him the truth?

200
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,622
This is how we got
thrown out of softball.

201
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,776
<i>Oh, and what would that be?</i>

202
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,325
That you're cutting the music
program so he loses tenure.

203
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,122
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

204
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,041
<i>You are wasting
everyone's time.</i>

205
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,168
Really? You know what?
You're wasting my time.

206
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,208
<i>Okay, how does
a day without pay sound?</i>

207
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,463
Bring it.

208
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,505
Really?

209
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,366
That's how you show your power?

210
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,008
You already docked me
a vacation day.

211
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,342
<i>Oh! Oh, so... So that's
what this is all about? Hmm?</i>

212
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,176
<i>The decision's been made.</i>

213
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,053
Yeah, well, every time you make
a decision, you know what,

214
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,336
you mess with somebody's life.

215
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,314
<i>You know what? You have
just crossed the line.</i>

216
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,069
No, I'll tell you
what's crossing the line,

217
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,810
firing a man
who's having a baby.

218
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,813
They don't know that I'm
talking about you necessarily.

219
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,023
Congratulations.

220
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,817
Stop looking at me.
They know it's you now.

221
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,026
He's having a baby.

222
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,165
Scott, you're talking
about a lot of money.

223
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,910
Money the school
just doesn't have.

224
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,452
A lot of money? Really?

225
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,771
How much could
it possibly cost?

226
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,414
<i>$48, 000.</i>

227
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,419
<i>So, as I was saying,</i>

228
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,002
<i>we have no choice
but to make these cuts.</i>

229
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,754
Yeah, or raise the money.

230
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,411
<i>Oh, and who's going to do that?</i>

231
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,221
We will.

232
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,397
Thank you.

233
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,786
I couldn't sleep
a wink last night.

234
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,538
My mind was racing.

235
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,240
And I bought you a coffee.

236
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,581
Oh, and I spoke to Elkins,
and he said we have to have

237
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,626
the money in by the end
of the school year, okay?

238
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,540
But then I made some fliers,

239
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,236
and I thought
we would all meet...

240
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,386
All the teachers at
5:00 this afternoon,

241
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,379
and you can give us
your game plan.

242
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,055
Game plan?
Yeah.

243
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,055
I'm still kind of
sorting through everything.

244
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,643
That's great.

245
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,395
So, what do you think
about this?

246
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,097
I thought I would
start out talking

247
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,099
about how important
music really is,

248
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,726
and then I would
tell some stories.

249
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,528
Like, did you know that Ravel
liked to dress up like a lady?

250
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,399
Is that too risqué?

251
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,239
You know, I think we should
probably just wing it.

252
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,245
Okay, but you know what?
I have to thank you again.

253
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,747
I was driving in this morning.

254
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,042
I heard <i>I Won't Back Down</i>
by Tom Petty, and I said,

255
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,040
"Yes, that is a sign."

256
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,792
Wow, are you solid.

257
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,088
Okay.

258
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,794
Okay. Okay. 5:00.

259
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,764
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

260
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,093
Well, the meeting
doesn't start till 5:00.

261
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,470
It's 5:15.

262
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, then you're late,
like everybody else.

263
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,149
Where do you think they are?

264
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,483
- Am I at the right place?
- Yes.

265
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,859
You are, absolutely.

266
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,940
Thank you so much
for coming, Miss Flores.

267
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,610
Are you kidding me?
Of course, Marty.

268
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,812
You know what I'm going to do?

269
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,661
I think I'm going to go
round up the other teachers.

270
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,204
They got to be somewhere.

271
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,381
Maybe they thought
it was in the cafeteria.

272
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,693
I think I saw
some people there.

273
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,623
Yes. I'm going to
try the cafeteria.

274
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,999
I'm feeling good about this.

275
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,336
There's no one in
the cafeteria, is there?

276
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,384
Just that janitor
that talks to himself.

277
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,841
I guess it was unrealistic

278
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,801
to think that
anybody would show up

279
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,469
when everybody has
their own problems.

280
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,146
You showed up.

281
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,223
You shut up.

282
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,483
I said, "You showed up."

283
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,482
Oh. I guess
I'm unrealistic.

284
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,675
But I got to say,
it's really nice

285
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,152
what you're doing for Marty.

286
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,677
Well, we tried, you know. I
mean, what are you going to do?

287
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,328
What are you talking about?

288
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,031
You can't give up on him now.

289
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,074
He's so passionate
about what he does.

290
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,327
This school needs more
people like him, not less.

291
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,710
Yeah, no, no,
I know, that's what...

292
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,205
No, I'm saying
that's what we got to do.

293
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,206
We got to find a way
to make this thing work,

294
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,503
and we got to stick at it.

295
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,505
So, what exactly is the plan?

296
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,755
Well, first off,
we got to get $48,000.

297
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,013
That's a definite.

298
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,580
Then we should probably help
save Marty's job after that.

299
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,849
Wow. I can see that you put
a lot of thought into it.

300
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,722
Well, how about this?
How about we work out a plan,

301
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,690
but we do it in
a controlled area,

302
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,021
which is my apartment,

303
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,769
and we put up charts and...

304
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,413
With the graphs and
the colored pencils.

305
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,110
But we have a plan, we go, "We
got to get to here by then."

306
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,695
Not a chance.

307
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,341
Okay, you're
making me work at this.

308
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,451
I understand. I get it.

309
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,869
What if I dunk this ball
in that hoop,

310
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,246
then you have dinner with me
at my house Friday night?

311
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,577
What do you say?

312
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,254
You dunk a basketball?

313
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,539
Please.

314
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,250
Fine. Then take the bet.

315
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,008
Deal.

316
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,387
Where are you going?

317
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

318
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,550
Come on, that's cheating.

319
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,801
Oh, no, it's not.

320
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,052
That's...
No, that's not what I...

321
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,771
Your dreams are
about to come true.

322
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:12,889
Nightmares.

323
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,069
0 for 17.

324
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,372
I'll tell you,
this chili is amazing, guy.

325
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,870
It's got an incredible kick.

326
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,872
Eight alarms, guy.
Eight.

327
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,123
You made this?

328
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,913
Wait till you see what kind
of dreams you have tonight.

329
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,919
So, listen, you really
have no extra work?

330
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,175
I mean, power-washing,
painting, anything.

331
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,251
I'll take anything.

332
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,803
No, no one's hiring right now.

333
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,555
I had to lay off
two guys myself.

334
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,299
Bobby Denisi
just lost his house.

335
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,718
Eric, tell Mary Shannon

336
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,511
to get off the freaking phone!

337
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,437
Mary Shannon,
get off the freaking phone!

338
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,730
I could have done that!

339
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,931
Well, then why didn't you?

340
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,315
Man, she's so lazy.

341
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,106
Yeah. I wish I could
help you out,

342
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,194
but... Hey, buddy?

343
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,316
What are you trying
to accomplish here?

344
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,567
I got it, okay?

345
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,274
And where the heck is Peter?

346
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,442
He was supposed to be
in the tub 10 minutes ago!

347
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,403
I don't know.
Can't find him.

348
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,573
Dad, can I watch <i>The World's
Deadliest Car Chases?</i>

349
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,290
How old are you?
Five.

350
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,456
Five. I don't know.
What do you think?

351
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,454
No.
No.

352
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,712
Sorry, buddy.

353
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,914
Go upstairs, take a bath.

354
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,294
Found him!

355
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,756
<i>...425 degrees</i>

356
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,360
<i>for about an hour and 15 minutes
until it's just perfectly...</i>

357
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,096
Hey.

358
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,133
If you need me to front you a
couple hunnies, I can do that.

359
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,668
I got some money stacked away
that she don't know about.

360
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,139
Look, I appreciate it, but I
need a lot more than that.

361
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,682
You know what we could do?

362
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,968
We could bet a five-game
parlay and take those winnings

363
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,148
right to the Indian casino.

364
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,272
Mom, Dad's betting again!

365
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,323
All right, guess who's
not getting a hamster.

366
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,866
What about that

367
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,744
citizenship class you
used to teach at night?

368
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,157
Nah, that was so brutal.

369
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,740
I don't even know
if they're hiring.

370
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,200
No, no, you just relax,
you know.

371
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,871
I got all the kids, okay, Eric?

372
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,206
Good, honey.
I had a tough day.

373
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,453
All right.

374
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,667
I'm tired anyway.

375
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,798
You, middle one, upstairs now.

376
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,718
Hey, and stop putting Raisinets
up your brother's nose, okay?

377
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,336
Dad says it's funny.

378
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,542
What are you doing?

379
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,968
You're sitting there.

380
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,344
You haven't taken a shower.

381
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,008
You disgust me.

382
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,677
Mission accomplished.
Pig.

383
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,891
Ostrich.

384
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,058
<i>Now, 10-car pileup.</i>

385
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,778
Okay, question number three,
"Women such as Susan B. Anthony

386
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,363
fought for suffrage and were
finally successful in 1920."

387
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,740
What does "suffrage" mean?

388
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,217
What's that?

389
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,325
...to accept
the things I cannot change...

390
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,702
Okay, you know what? That's
the AA meeting next door.

391
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,998
You know what, let's let them

392
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,277
finish up the Serenity Prayer.

393
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,047
...accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.

394
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,757
He will make all things right
if I surrender to his will.

395
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,430
That I may be reasonably
happy in this life

396
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,727
and supremely happy
in the next.

397
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,895
Living one day at a time...

398
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,574
Right, one day at a time.
Good for them.

399
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,726
Okay, so "suffrage",
what does it mean?

400
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,107
Miguel.

401
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,896
To be in pain?

402
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,949
No. Okay, you know what,
that's "suffering."

403
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,065
"No, that's 'suffering." '
Okay, no, you know what?

404
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,530
No, we're not
repeating today, Muba.

405
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,782
Thank you.

406
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,904
Sorry.
It's fine.

407
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,271
We're just not doing it today.

408
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,360
We're just gonna do it
a couple times as a study aid.

409
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,743
Sorry.
It's okay, it's fine.

410
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,705
No, "suffrage" is
the right to do something.

411
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,424
The right to not feel pain.

412
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,716
No.

413
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,045
Okay, look, we covered this
for, like, 45 minutes.

414
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,754
You guys remember Monday?
You guys remember Monday?

415
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,264
When we went over
this for, like, 45...

416
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,008
The whole class dedicated
to this. You don't...

417
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,059
"Suffrage" has nothing
to do with pain. No pain.

418
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,435
No pain, no gain?

419
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,895
Okay, we're off track.

420
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,267
We are
definitely off track here.

421
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,936
The right to vote?

422
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,943
I'm sorry,
you got something to say?

423
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,605
Niko. But forget it.

424
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,197
I'm sure it's wrong.
Please, look, there are

425
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,524
no wrong answers here,
people. You know what?

426
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,451
I'm gonna stop right there 'cause there
are obviously a lot of wrong answers,

427
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,990
but there are a couple
wrong answers, but...

428
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,240
It's okay, there are.

429
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,074
But let's give
it a shot anyway.

430
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,250
The right to vote?

431
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:04,295
There you go. Okay?
Yes!

432
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,172
You know what, "suffrage" is
the right to elect leaders.

433
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,489
You understand, right, Miguel?

434
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,754
I do, I do.

435
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,960
Okay, good.

436
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,639
Mr. Voss! Mr. Voss.

437
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,140
Can I talk to you?

438
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,312
Sure, what's up?

439
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,021
I always try to
be a good student.

440
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,986
But when it comes
to taking tests,

441
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,189
I get all clenched
in the tight spot.

442
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,320
If I fail this
citizenship test,

443
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,056
they'll send me
back to Holland.

444
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,039
And things here are
just starting to twist.

445
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,159
I'm sorry, is that good?
I don't even...

446
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,664
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Twisting is good.

447
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,492
So, I was wondering,

448
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,703
is there any way you can
give me a little extra help?

449
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,876
Extra help?

450
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,590
Yeah, you know what,
I kind of got,

451
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,962
like, a full plate right now.

452
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,877
I can't, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

453
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,128
All right.

454
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,963
Thank you. Thank you.

455
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,681
Niko!

456
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,507
I'll move some things around and maybe we
can sit down later tonight, all right?

457
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,732
You are the best!

458
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,153
Oh, thank you!
Thank you very much!

459
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,073
All right.
You can stop that now.

460
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,947
Yeah, all right.

461
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,151
Yeah, we're good.
We're good.

462
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,378
There he is!

463
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,880
Hey! How are you?

464
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,051
Good.

465
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,796
Oh, thanks for doing this, buddy.
Sure.

466
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,464
Scott, meet Koen and Nard.

467
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,719
Koen, Nard, this is Scott.

468
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,846
Hey, guys.

469
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,968
Oh, close the door,
before the ferret gets out.

470
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,974
The ferret, the ferret.

471
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,263
Okay, okay.

472
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,392
Hang your coat right there.

473
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,897
Okay.

474
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,482
<i>He has no weaknesses.</i>

475
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,730
<i>He has incredible
knockout power...</i>

476
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,199
Wow, you used to fight, huh?

477
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,197
Yeah.
Long time ago.

478
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,570
Now I just teach
Mixed Martial Arts at my gym.

479
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,910
Should we study or...

480
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,163
Oh, yeah!
Right after we watch UFC.

481
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,334
Come on, sit down.

482
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,503
<i>Hi, again, everybody.
I'm Mike Goldberg.</i>

483
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,253
<i>Welcome once again to the
Ultimate Fighting Championship.</i>

484
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,710
<i>Since the first day
he entered the Octagon,</i>

485
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,425
<i>we knew Ken Dietrich
was something special.</i>

486
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,514
<i>My partner as always,
Joe Rogan.</i>

487
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,432
<i>Man, what
an exciting matchup this is.</i>

488
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,588
<i>Incredible matchup, you know,
for a bunch of reasons.</i>

489
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,729
You hold for bets.

490
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,154
<i>Ken Dietrich,
Brian Stann, here we go!</i>

491
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,952
<i>Straight left by Dietrich.</i>

492
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,746
<i>He's jumping all over Stann.</i>

493
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,616
He should just double-leg
him, take him down.

494
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,783
Did you ever fight?

495
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,293
No, no, I wrestled in college.

496
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,712
That guy's a wrestler.
Wrestlers make great fighters.

497
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,710
<i>And Dietrich
jumps all over him again.</i>

498
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,299
<i>- He's got the takedown!</i>
- Oh!

499
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,542
You called it!

500
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,218
Ooh, twisty!

501
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,754
Twisty! Twisty!

502
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,467
Twisty.

503
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,799
<i>And he has that
nasty shoulder-lock.</i>

504
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,924
<i>And it is all over!</i>

505
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,053
<i>Ken Dietrich, the Executioner!</i>

506
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,309
Sorry, Koen.

507
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,311
Ah! He took his 10 grand
and ran off like

508
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,816
a Shetland pony!

509
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,561
Ten grand... He made
10 grand for that fight?

510
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,612
Yep.
But he lost.

511
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,448
Yeah, if he won,
it would've been 50.

512
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,742
Okay, next fight.

513
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,409
Mixed Martial Arts?

514
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,081
Do you even know
how to do that?

515
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,579
No. No, I do not.

516
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,830
This is crazy.

517
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,495
Look, I saw this
UFC event last night,

518
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:36,173
and the guy got paid 10 grand
to fight, and he lost.

519
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,006
I was a really good wrestler in college.
I think I can do this.

520
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,169
Do what?

521
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,588
Lose.

522
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,762
You cannot do this.

523
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,932
Marty, look, we only have until
the end of the school year

524
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,759
to save your job.
Come on! Night school.

525
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,264
Oh, great, yeah,
between what I make there

526
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,641
and what you make
with your private lessons,

527
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,847
we'll save the music
program in 18 years.

528
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,978
This is the best
chance you got.

529
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,483
Okay.

530
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,946
Okay, if you're gonna lose,
then I'm gonna help you lose.

531
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,651
Deal?

532
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,199
Deal.

533
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,656
Let's do this.
Let's lose.

534
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,534
Unfortunately,
today is gonna be my last day.

535
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,168
But don't worry, next week,

536
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,329
you're gonna be in great
hands with a new teacher,

537
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,668
and he's gonna be...

538
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,715
But you are new?

539
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,046
Yes, I am new.

540
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,798
But this guy, he's even newer.
Understand?

541
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,387
So, you are not new?

542
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,723
No, I am new, okay...

543
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,717
I'm so confused.
I don't...

544
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,726
Okay, we're going
off the rails again here.

545
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,225
Okay, listen, everybody.
Here's the point.

546
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,566
Next week, lam not gonna be here.
I will be gone.

547
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,812
But I wanted to say
to you guys good luck and...

548
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,238
You know what? Welcome
to America in advance.

549
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,240
Yeah, that's how
confident I am in you.

550
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,904
Live the dream.

551
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,159
Make it happen.

552
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,738
So, thank you and good night.

553
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,909
Okay?

554
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,159
So, I'm citizen?

555
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,212
Man, I can't believe you
would quit on me like this.

556
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,917
I'm citizen.

557
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,878
You know how
important this is to me.

558
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,917
Niko, relax.
I got it all worked out.

559
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,427
But I need to
ask you something.

560
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,586
Okay!

561
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,929
Here's the thing.
I need money

562
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,848
to save a friend's job,
a lot of money.

563
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,925
Okay,
and as crazy as it sounds,

564
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,182
I want to fight Mixed Martial
Arts, but I need your help.

565
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,729
I want you to train me.

566
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,268
You're kidding?

567
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,099
No, I can do this.
You're too old!

568
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,113
And on top of that,
you have no experience.

569
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,549
But there are guys that run
marathons well into their 80s.

570
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,606
Not when they're
being punched in the face.

571
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,866
Come on, you said it yourself,
wrestlers make great fighters.

572
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,742
And you know, when I was
younger, I took judo.

573
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,112
I mean, it was only for
three and a half weeks.

574
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,674
I had to stop 'cause my sensei
got accepted into dental school.

575
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,800
But he said I had
wicked potential, man.

576
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,459
There's no way you can fight.

577
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,287
And that's the end of it.

578
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,296
Okay, great.

579
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,540
What time are we
studying tonight?

580
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,795
You just quit!

581
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,965
Look, you don't want to
train me, that's fine.

582
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,671
But we started this thing
and we're not gonna stop

583
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,051
until you're a citizen, okay?

584
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,392
Okay.
You want to be a fighter?

585
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,972
You start in the cage.

586
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,909
There's a small-time show
this weekend.

587
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,058
I'll get you in.

588
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,582
Wait a second, no.
Fight right away?

589
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,902
Shouldn't we train first?

590
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,151
No! Trial by fire, baby!

591
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,111
I'm a citizen.

592
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,784
You made my dream come true.

593
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:09,860
Miguel...

594
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,570
I'm going to name
my boy after you.

595
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,076
His name is Sergio,

596
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,407
but I'm going to switch it up.

597
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,333
That's nice, Miguel.

598
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,888
Let's slow things
down a second, okay?

599
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,662
And let's take
a little walk and talk.

600
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,497
Something wrong?
Maybe.

601
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,211
Ow!

602
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,379
Ow!

603
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,835
Come on, I got to do this.

604
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,256
I know. Okay, okay.

605
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,591
Oh!

606
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,013
Okay, hold it for a minute.

607
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,129
This is a terrible mattress.
I'm feeling everything.

608
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,850
This is ridiculous.

609
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,804
I'm not gonna learn
any of this stuff.

610
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,769
I'm telling you,
I'm just gonna wrestle.

611
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,269
I'm gonna take it
to the ground.

612
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,684
It's my world.
Your world?

613
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,352
Your world is
gonna be destroyed

614
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,437
by people who know
multiple disciplines.

615
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,651
The fight's in two days.
What am I gonna learn?

616
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,028
It is what it is.

617
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,530
I got it.

618
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,053
I know exactly
what you have to do.

619
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,696
You're gonna beat your opponent

620
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,201
before the match ever starts.

621
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,870
You're gonna learn the
ancient art of intimidation.

622
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,646
You ever actually
been in a fight?

623
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,996
No. Well, none with a boy,
anyway.

624
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,207
But I know this is gonna work.

625
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,293
Okay, so based on your limited
experience fighting girls,

626
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,048
how?

627
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,386
Music.

628
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,056
You're gonna be
inspired by music.

629
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,805
That's why all the gladiators
entered the Colosseum

630
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,720
with all that thundering music.

631
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,308
Actually,
they do that in the UFC.

632
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,563
Exactly.

633
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,562
And you're gonna
follow in the footsteps

634
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,893
of all those great warriors.

635
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,729
Every one of them had
a distinctive musical theme

636
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,822
that put fear in the hearts
of their opponents,

637
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,319
which rendered them defeated

638
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,072
even before their match began.

639
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,127
I got it. You could
enter with Pachelbel.

640
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,992
No, I know what I'm doing.
With Bach.

641
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,872
I don't need that. It's gonna be...
I have it.

642
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,908
Don't...
Mozart's <i>35th in D Major.</i>

643
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,494
Listen to me.
I'm picking the song!

644
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:42,544
Of course you are.

645
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,215
Good evening, sir.
This is Scott Voss.

646
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,546
He's fighting tonight.

647
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,761
Change behind the tarp.

648
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,769
Yeah. We were just hoping that
there would be some place private,

649
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,393
you know, where he could
have a modicum of privacy...

650
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,682
No, no, no,
I'm doing this for you.

651
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,358
I appreciate it...
It's embarrassing.

652
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,027
Yes, it is. We're gonna move.
We're gonna move.

653
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,274
Okay.
Thank you, sir.

654
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,654
Wow.

655
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,697
This place is unique.

656
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,575
Is that a chicken?

657
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,870
This looks like
a Civil War hospital.

658
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,288
Lookie, look who showed up.

659
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,846
You're not as smart
as I thought you were.

660
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,379
Look, I knew this
wasn't gonna be the UFC,

661
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,382
but I'm 80% sure I saw a chick...
I think it was a chicken.

662
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,713
Was it a chicken?
Chicken.

663
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,435
It's 100%...
That's a chicken right there.

664
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,091
Look at that,
that's a farm chicken.

665
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,809
They're filthy animal...
Is that even...

666
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,223
Is it sanctioned here?

667
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,225
Hey, this is
bottom-level MMA.

668
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,639
No, but I want to be clean.

669
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,810
You ready? You better be,
because you're next.

670
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,400
You ready to do this?

671
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,651
Yeah.

672
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,659
<i>Making his MMA debut...</i>

673
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,827
What are you doing?

674
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,161
Don't you worry about it.

675
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,834
<i>...from Hyde Park, Massachusetts,</i>

676
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,254
<i>please welcome Scott Voss!</i>

677
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,999
Watch this.

678
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,089
Intimidation!

679
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,966
Yeah!

680
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,344
Yeah!

681
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,536
Yeah!
Whoo!

682
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,789
Get in the cage, you Vike geek!

683
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,872
Whoo!

684
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,057
Come on, guys, you ready?

685
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,524
One second, okay?

686
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,575
Ready? Ready?

687
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,335
Fight!

688
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,265
I like your hair up like that.

689
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,346
Cute.

690
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,022
But I know it
could come down, too.

691
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,107
It'd be all...
I know, I'm just saying.

692
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,025
Is this the best plan
you could come up with?

693
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,774
Fighting in a cage?

694
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,946
What kind of an example are
you setting for these kids?

695
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,114
Hold this.

696
00:30:58,607 --> 00:30:59,950
As much as I enjoyed

697
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,985
teaching future Americans
for eight bucks an hour,

698
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,574
it wasn't getting the job done.

699
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:05,952
You smell really good,
by the way...

700
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,749
Gee whiz, what's with the...

701
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,867
You're like this.

702
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,076
You're like that on me.

703
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,628
Just put a Band-Aid on it.

704
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,422
Come on, Scott. You and I
both know this is crazy.

705
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,959
What would I say to Marty?

706
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,710
He'll understand.

707
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,462
He saw you get
knocked out cold.

708
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,764
I wasn't out cold, all right?

709
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,220
I was half in, half out.

710
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,300
Mmm.

711
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,810
Although I did see a unicorn.

712
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,094
I was riding it.

713
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,141
Please.
Okay.

714
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,226
I'll talk to him.

715
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,648
Kiss? Want a kiss?

716
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,066
Nothing? No.

717
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:47,994
Hi, can I help you?

718
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,617
You must be Mollie.

719
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,835
Hi, I'm Scott Voss.
I work with Marty.

720
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,162
And I didn't see him
after school,

721
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,149
and I was wondering
if he's around.

722
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,833
No, he had a private lesson.

723
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,505
But he should be home
any minute.

724
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,010
Here. Please, come in.

725
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,512
Thanks so much.
Yeah.

726
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,431
You're welcome.

727
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,928
Oh, it is such a mess.

728
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,509
I am so embarrassed.

729
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,347
Marty's instruments
are everywhere.

730
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,606
Let me pick up
a couple things here.

731
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,687
We're turning the music
room into a nursery.

732
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,608
I can't believe
I just said that.

733
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,280
I'm expecting.

734
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,698
No one knows yet.

735
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,283
Please, don't tell anyone.

736
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,614
We're really... It's
just too early right now.

737
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:30,870
Say no more.

738
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,543
Believe me, I didn't...
What baby, right?

739
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,003
I didn't even know, you know.

740
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,288
That goes right in the vault,
by the way,

741
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,044
and it's like a,
it's like a vault,

742
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,294
locked down, Fort Knox
or some sort of prison.

743
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,468
Great. Thank you.

744
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,796
Wow, does he play all these?

745
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,176
Oh, no.

746
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,640
He buys them off the Internet

747
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,807
and garage sales,
and he fixes them up

748
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,244
for students who
can't afford them.

749
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,559
Oh, man.

750
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,762
Just sucks what's happening
at school, doesn't it?

751
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,891
What do you mean? What's
happening at the school?

752
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,642
He didn't tell you?

753
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,568
No. Is there something wrong
that's going on at the school?

754
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,234
No, no, nothing bad at all.

755
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,997
Last week, they installed
a metal detector

756
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,197
in the teachers' lounge,
'cause...

757
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,415
Really?
Yeah.

758
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,500
Because a teacher had
flashed a piece, you know?

759
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,748
Oh.
Yeah.

760
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,948
So now it just takes long...

761
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,338
You know, you can't
get in and out any more.

762
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,835
What happened to your eye?

763
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,841
I cut myself shaving.

764
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,011
I was shaving my eyebrows.

765
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,179
I do. On the weekends.

766
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,847
I'm gonna get going...

767
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,176
Well, is there a message
I can give him for you?

768
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,430
You know what? No.

769
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,602
Thank you. Okay.
Great.

770
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,767
It was nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.

771
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,909
Tell Betcher not
to cut anything.

772
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,612
We're saving Marty's job.

773
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,120
That's 750.

774
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,297
That's the first
installment right there.

775
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,790
Scott?
Yeah?

776
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,789
You know I'm on your side
on this, right?

777
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,127
Yeah.

778
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,126
I played French horn
in the marching band.

779
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,633
I loved wearing that big hat,
shiny white spats,

780
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,097
the smell of the grass.

781
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,137
Those were some good times.

782
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,056
Okay.

783
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,228
Excuse me,
is there a Niko here?

784
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,403
Fourth floor.

785
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,570
And knee. And up.
And knee.

786
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,823
And up.
And knee. And up.

787
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,571
And knee. And up.

788
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,573
Grab him and head-butt.

789
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,751
Knee to the face, knee to the
face and throw him back.

790
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,998
Stomp.

791
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,579
Victory dance!

792
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,164
Oh, victory dance!

793
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,416
Run, run, run, run...

794
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,591
Hey!

795
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,507
No pain, no gain!

796
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,262
Victory dance,

797
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,577
victory dance...

798
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,098
And stop!

799
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,174
Worthy attack, everybody!

800
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,478
That's right!
Thank you!

801
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,147
Thanks for coming,
ladies and gentlemen. Scott!

802
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,686
Hey.
How you doing, buddy?

803
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,368
I thought you said
you owned an MMA gym.

804
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,689
No, no, no, no.

805
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,114
I said I taught MMA at a gym.

806
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,608
Oh. Well, that
wasn't MMA though, right?

807
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,860
No, that was
Disco Street Fighting.

808
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,492
Don't worry, with you, we're
gonna do the real stuff.

809
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,326
That's what we're gonna try.

810
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,287
Let's go. I have
a spin class in an hour.

811
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,462
Okay.

812
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,507
Let's work on some
takedown defense.

813
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,426
I wrestled, I think I know
how to stop a shot.

814
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,215
Ding, ding, boom, boom,
elbow, elbow, boom!

815
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,050
Liver shot, bang, bang, bang!

816
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,559
Oh! Knockout blow.

817
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,141
You got the point.

818
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,728
We need to keep you out
of dangerous situations.

819
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,318
Now, to escape
the Rear-Naked Choke,

820
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,987
you want to break the grip,

821
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,064
pull the arm down
and move to the side.

822
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,573
Escape.

823
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,075
No, don't squirm.

824
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,994
That just helps me
sink it in tighter.

825
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,163
Arm bar. Escape.

826
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,997
Escape!

827
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,878
Wrong way, wrong way.
Too late.

828
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,839
Okay, you're vulnerable
like a puppy.

829
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,755
Yeah, that's 'cause I
let you get into position.

830
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,514
It's easy. I could do
the same thing to you

831
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,841
if I got you in a hold.

832
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,434
Good point. Yeah.

833
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,604
I'm out.

834
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,182
I'm free.

835
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,227
I'm bored.

836
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,774
I'm late for my class.

837
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,133
We're just gonna
have to wing it.

838
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,573
All right, ladies.

839
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,867
Let's get those legs warmed up.

840
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,713
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the principals-</i>

841
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,212
<i>First, from Jamaica,
Queens, New York,</i>

842
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,305
<i>here's Ragin' Rafael Romero!</i>

843
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,225
Romero!

844
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,140
No helmet?

845
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,139
Hey, it's okay to be afraid.

846
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,982
Don't worry. Use it.

847
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,730
Try to channel it into focus.

848
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,982
That last knockout,
never happened.

849
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,276
Three migraines a week
say you're wrong.

850
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,405
Hey, you got to... You
got to stop this. Why?

851
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,156
Either dig in or call it a day.

852
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,162
No, no, I'm loosening you up.
No, you're not.

853
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,830
You're rubbing me like
you're putting on sunscreen.

854
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,324
Get off!

855
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,833
It is weird.

856
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,712
Okay. I thought I was
doing the right thing.

857
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,339
<i>And now, my friends, let's meet
his opponent here at the pier.</i>

858
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,797
<i>This young man is from
Boston, Massachusetts.</i>

859
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,341
<i>He has a record
of zero victories</i>

860
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,843
<i>and one defeat by knockout.</i>

861
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,012
<i>MMA fans, here he is.</i>

862
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,890
<i>Let's hear it for Scott Voss!</i>

863
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,308
Here we go. Here we go.
Okay, let's go.

864
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,806
Come on. Let's go.
You can do this.

865
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,610
Block those knees, Scott!

866
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,032
Block them! Block them!

867
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,359
Pull him in close!

868
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,785
Time-out! Time-out!

869
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,453
What time-out?
Time-out?

870
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,114
There's no time-outs, guy.

871
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,494
Come on, let's go.

872
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,710
Put your hands up!
Come on, defense!

873
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,712
Wait! He kicked him
in the bells!

874
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,049
Ref, take a point!

875
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,049
Would you come on?

876
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,223
Man, are you okay?

877
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,021
He just kicked my
left nut into my throat.

878
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,310
Where's my stool?

879
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,889
What stool? You're in
charge of the stool.

880
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,394
We didn't have
a stool last fight.

881
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,685
I didn't make it out
of the first round last fight.

882
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,066
I'm a little confused about
my job description.

883
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,022
I'm a music teacher.
I don't know the rules.

884
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,315
I can't do this.

885
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,410
What are you doing?
You can't lay down. Get up.

886
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,661
I'm exhausted.

887
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,580
Yeah, that's exactly the
message you're sending him.

888
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,241
Hey, you can't lay down, man.

889
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,413
Can you continue?

890
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,081
He's fine.
Hey, I'm talking to him.

891
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:50,325
All right, let's go, fella.

892
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,329
Get up, Scott.

893
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,081
It's so soft down here.

894
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,707
So soft.

895
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,252
Okay, remember...
Defense.

896
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,595
All right, I heard you already.

897
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,923
Next time, bring the stool.

898
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,177
Okay, okay.

899
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,013
All right, we're ready now?
Come on, Scott.

900
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,260
You ready?

901
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,932
Let's do it! Come on!

902
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,103
Defense!

903
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,890
Watch out!

904
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,939
Keep those hands up!

905
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,946
Put your hands up!
Hands up, man!

906
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,023
Hands up!

907
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,780
Yeah, he's not listening.
Hello!

908
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,361
I'm talking here!

909
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,740
Watch out!

910
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,459
Nice job!
Okay, there you go.

911
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,960
Pull him in close.

912
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,455
Okay, that's right,
push him away.

913
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,465
Don't look at me.
Look at him!

914
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,390
Listen to me. You're giving
him too much space.

915
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,934
To take away his power, you
have to keep it in a clinch.

916
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,644
Got it?
I'm trying.

917
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,058
Defense.

918
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,437
Stay strong, Scott.

919
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,810
One more round.

920
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,817
Okay, it's raining.
It's over.

921
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,823
No, it's not.
This isn't baseball.

922
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,658
You fight!
This is stupid.

923
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,491
Fighter, are you ready?

924
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,323
Are you ready, chief?

925
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,809
I got to be honest,
I'm really not.

926
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,425
I'm out. I'm out.
Yeah, yeah, he's ready.

927
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,123
It'll blow over.

928
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,000
All right!

929
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,756
Let's fight!

930
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,632
Perfect.

931
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,766
Jump on him!
Jump on him!

932
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,810
Use the fact that
you're slippery now!

933
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,686
Don't let him take you down.

934
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,151
Okay, get away.
Get away.

935
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,364
Oh, come on!

936
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,618
Swim! Swim away, Scott!

937
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,415
Get over there! Get over there!

938
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,842
All right,
pencils down, people.

939
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,185
Let's go. Hand them in.

940
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,558
Let's get them up.

941
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,474
Let's go.
Let's bring it in.

942
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,982
Really? Really?
You don't even...

943
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,692
That's how you do it?

944
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,072
Malia.
Yeah?

945
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,489
You missed,
like, three answers here.

946
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,488
Come on. What's going on?
You're smarter than me.

947
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,625
Hey, what's the...

948
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,998
What's the matter?

949
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,424
My father is
making me quit music.

950
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,592
What?

951
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,087
But why?

952
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,422
He said I have to
work in his restaurant.

953
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,928
I mean, he doesn't understand.

954
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,434
When I moved here,
I didn't know English.

955
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:55,935
I had to learn everything
all over again, you know?

956
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,185
So I used songs
and stuff to learn.

957
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,608
Besides Filipino,

958
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,860
the only language
I knew was music.

959
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,613
It helps me remember.

960
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,451
If that makes sense.

961
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,780
Malia, it makes perfect sense.

962
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,375
I don't want to quit it.

963
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,984
Then you got to tell him that.

964
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,044
Look, you know what you do?

965
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,880
You tell him your teacher
won't let you quit.

966
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,128
He thinks school is
just a waste of time.

967
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,633
But it's not.

968
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,545
Come on, Mr. Voss.

969
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,387
You said it yourself.

970
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,383
Learning this stuff
doesn't matter.

971
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,642
I got to go.

972
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,651
Okay, what are the
three branches of government?

973
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,406
Three branches?
All right, three branches.

974
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,734
Yeah.
I got this. Don't tell me.

975
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,659
Oh, hey, you got to eat.

976
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,320
You have an hour
before the fight.

977
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,526
Oh. Hey,
you got my oatmeal?

978
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,785
I do.

979
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,499
The thing is
that it's not here.

980
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,001
It's in my classroom
right next to my briefcase.

981
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,834
Three branches...
The legal, the...

982
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,398
No, no, no, no, no,
don't count that.

983
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,590
Wait, wait,
you forgot my oatmeal?

984
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,012
Well, I brought the stool.

985
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,089
I got to eat, man.

986
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,173
Well, we can swing back.

987
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,008
No. Hey, stop it.
We don't have time now.

988
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,264
You said branches, right?

989
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,435
Yeah, three branches
of government.

990
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,184
What am I going to do here?
I got to eat something.

991
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,598
Oh, you know what?

992
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,182
I have applesauce I made.

993
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,642
You see it back there, Niko?

994
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,519
It's on the back.
Yeah, yeah, got it.

995
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,775
Come on, three branches
of government, buddy.

996
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:27,946
Do not throw away
that Tupperware.

997
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,024
I'm not going to throw away
the Tupperware, okay?

998
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,616
Is there cinnamon in this?

999
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,787
No.

1000
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,955
Ooh! I got it.

1001
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,534
Democrat, Republican
and Libertarian.

1002
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,826
Not even close.

1003
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,290
No!

1004
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,800
Okay, last fight was better.

1005
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,377
You lost,
but you didn't get hurt.

1006
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:52,673
So, remember, the word
of the day, defense.

1007
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,182
Close the gap,
and if he shoots...

1008
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,718
Hips down.
Keep your hips down.

1009
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,851
That's right.

1010
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:58,928
All right, here we go.

1011
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,978
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

1012
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,727
They didn't come for us yet.

1013
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,983
Let me see what's going on.

1014
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,356
Hips down.

1015
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,563
- Yeah.
- Nope.

1016
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,322
This isn't you.

1017
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,650
What do you mean,
this isn't me?

1018
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,905
This is my song.

1019
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,490
This is him.
It's his song.

1020
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,238
Hey, he's got the same song.

1021
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,091
Boom!

1022
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,012
Wow. He's good.

1023
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,393
Whoo!

1024
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,102
I don't believe this.

1025
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,351
He stole my song.
I bring the boom!

1026
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,269
Well, tonight,
he's bringing the boom.

1027
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,945
Look, we both can't
have the same song.

1028
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,780
Come on,
we got to get ready, guys.

1029
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,696
No, no, you gotta
get me another song.

1030
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,821
What?
Go, please,

1031
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,068
go tell them to
play another song.

1032
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,404
Get you another song.

1033
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,288
What? I need a song.

1034
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,617
I got it.

1035
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,702
Yeah?

1036
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,787
Congress, Senate and State.

1037
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,172
Okay, again, not close.

1038
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,462
All right, can we stick
a pin in this, please?

1039
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,302
I know! I'm sorry, but we
didn't study last night.

1040
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,841
I'm falling behind.

1041
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,140
What the heck is this?

1042
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,942
Holly Holy, Neil Diamond.

1043
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,985
Went platinum in 1969.

1044
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,274
Who cares?

1045
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,697
Excuse me. I do.

1046
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,486
It got me through
a very difficult time.

1047
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,034
It sounds like a revival.

1048
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,528
Yeah. Blue-eyed gospel.

1049
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,533
Extremely intricate genre.

1050
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,205
It picks up.

1051
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,748
Come on.
Okay, we got to go.

1052
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,999
Let's go.

1053
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,425
Yeah!

1054
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,299
All right, it's Scott!

1055
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,426
It's Scott.
Oh, he's in the house!

1056
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,973
Yeah!
Scott Voss!

1057
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,345
Hey! Hey!
Whoo!

1058
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,759
Stand up!

1059
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,515
Scott, he's a killer!

1060
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:04,853
Everybody up!

1061
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,689
It's the Scott Man!

1062
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,103
Yeah. It's happening!
Yeah!

1063
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,684
He's going to kick 'em.

1064
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,227
Oh, he's fierce.

1065
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,689
Here we go! Yay!

1066
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,368
No, no! Defense!

1067
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,203
Come on, now!

1068
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,327
Come on, Scott!

1069
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,418
Don't grab the fence!

1070
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,779
I'm not even
grabbing the fence!

1071
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,887
Keep your hands up!

1072
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,505
Ow!
Tie him up!

1073
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,010
Come on, Scott!
Keep your hands up!

1074
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,143
Come on, get up!
Get up, get up, get up!

1075
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,061
Getup! Getup! Get up!

1076
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,103
Go! Defense!

1077
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,226
Now hit him!

1078
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,652
Ow!

1079
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,730
Oh.

1080
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,443
Fight it! Come on.

1081
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,658
Oh. Oh.

1082
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,573
Defense, buddy!

1083
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,908
Come on!

1084
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,285
Lock the elbows.

1085
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,953
Ten seconds, Scott.
Ten seconds.

1086
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,155
Watch the Kimura.

1087
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,416
Watch the Kimura. Watch...
That's illegal.

1088
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,213
It's legal. It's legal.
Sorry.

1089
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,631
Okay, watch it.
Get out of it.

1090
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:14,749
Fight it. Fight it.

1091
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,751
All right, that's enough.

1092
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,465
Saved by the bell.

1093
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,883
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

1094
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,266
Sit down.

1095
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,927
Just relax. Relax.

1096
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,388
Oh, my gosh. My shoulder.

1097
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,601
What are you doing?

1098
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,474
Stick to the game plan.

1099
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,983
I'm sick of
the game plan, okay?

1100
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,147
I'm sick of defense. I...

1101
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,227
Listen to me.

1102
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,359
If you get caught, you're done.

1103
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:38,564
We have a lot more fights.

1104
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,694
Oh, man.

1105
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,242
Tie this guy up.

1106
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,614
Protect yourself.

1107
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,446
Okay. Yeah.

1108
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,162
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

1109
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,161
Fight!

1110
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,159
All right, Scott,
this is your round!

1111
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,255
Oh!
Get your hands up!

1112
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,627
Tie him up, Scott!

1113
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,341
Keep your hands up!

1114
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,301
Come on, close the gap, buddy!

1115
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,882
Come on, Scott.
Tie him up!

1116
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,854
That just happened!
That just happened!

1117
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,445
Yeah! Yeah!

1118
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,160
You did it!

1119
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,451
You! You the man!

1120
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,705
Yeah!

1121
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,325
Yeah! We won!

1122
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,372
Hey, man, great fight.

1123
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:36,497
I'm so sorry.

1124
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,770
Who leaves applesauce

1125
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,644
on the rear dash,
out in the hot sun?

1126
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,859
You know, better question,

1127
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:01,694
who among us who isn't Amish
makes their own applesauce?

1128
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,821
Yes. Yes.

1129
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:06,069
Mistakes were made.

1130
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,907
But... We won.

1131
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,996
- We did it.
- Huh?

1132
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,292
We won. We won.

1133
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,870
Mmm-hmm. We did.

1134
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,583
Yeah. Yeah!
We won.

1135
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,838
We won!
We did it.

1136
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,842
It's unbelievable!

1137
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,557
Yeah!

1138
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,562
Oh, careful, Niko!

1139
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,771
I'm sore! I'm sore!

1140
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,228
Oh, my God.

1141
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,691
Oh, here he comes.
Here he comes.

1142
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,360
Okay, everybody,
just take your seats.

1143
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,036
Can you keep it down?

1144
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,700
Can you keep it down?

1145
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,369
Malia.

1146
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,079
Just come here.

1147
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,634
What's going on?

1148
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,429
You're famous.

1149
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:10,095
What?

1150
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,719
Everybody in the music
department is talking about it.

1151
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,567
Mr. Streb told us that
you were doing this for us.

1152
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:26,941
And I got to say,
you're a hero.

1153
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,155
Hero?

1154
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,796
It's not sprained.
It's just a bruise.

1155
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,098
Good, 'cause I
gotta fight tomorrow.

1156
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,639
I'm going to have to
start charging you.

1157
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,473
So,

1158
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,806
how much money
have you made so far?

1159
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,186
Three grand.

1160
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,856
I'm definitely going to
have to start charging you.

1161
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,320
Speaking of which...

1162
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,317
What's this?

1163
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,365
$72 from my bake sale.

1164
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,700
I had to do something.

1165
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,831
This is amazing. Thank you.

1166
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,163
I got to give it to you.
It's been a long time

1167
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,707
since I felt any kind
of energy in this school.

1168
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,167
Yeah?

1169
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,627
Yeah. I don't understand
how we got so far off track.

1170
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:25,879
We?

1171
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,733
It's not our fault.
It's the system.

1172
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,007
Go easy.

1173
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,505
Oh, so it's the system

1174
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,222
that's creating teachers
who just don't care.

1175
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,012
Oh, come on.
You know the deal.

1176
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,010
You can't speed up to
help the gifted kids.

1177
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,855
You can't slow down to
help the slower ones.

1178
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,101
It's about moving
cattle through, you know?

1179
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,227
It's a numbers game.

1180
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,521
That's what they want,
but what about you?

1181
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,020
Yeah, look, there was a time

1182
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,447
I couldn't wait for
the school year to start.

1183
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,700
I was like a... A freshman
decorating my dorm.

1184
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,990
You know, I'd put posters
up all over the place

1185
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,037
and I'd set up
these plastic models.

1186
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,539
No, you didn't.
I did! I would jump up

1187
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,408
on the desk just to
get the kids into it.

1188
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,502
It was so stupid.

1189
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,045
No, it's not.

1190
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,933
I think I would have liked you
better when you were that stupid.

1191
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,797
All right, well, look,
I need to repay you

1192
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,094
for all this right here,

1193
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,291
and I think this equals dinner
at my house on Friday.

1194
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,507
No, I don't think so.

1195
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:17,264
Why do you always turn me down?

1196
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,352
Do you know there's a lunch
lady who's got the hots for me?

1197
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,476
And I'm just telling you, I can
only hold her off for so long.

1198
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,353
Do you even know
that every time

1199
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,809
you've asked me out,

1200
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,690
you've done it from
a seated position?

1201
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,604
You don't even make
an effort to get up.

1202
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,981
That's because we're
so comfortable together.

1203
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,941
I think, when it's easy,
it's right, you know?

1204
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,568
Good-bye, Scott.
All right.

1205
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,787
How about a little jambalaya?

1206
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,784
What do you think? Oh, I get nothing?
All right.

1207
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,079
Okay, push now.
Blocking fast, like, lower.

1208
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,043
Here, over here.
That's good. See?

1209
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,870
There. Little lower.

1210
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,045
Just block lower, man.

1211
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,919
All right, hey.
All right, come on, man.

1212
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,007
This is still defense.

1213
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,563
I want to start working
on my offense.

1214
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,719
It's too dangerous.
I won!

1215
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,967
You landed a lucky shot.

1216
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,047
All right, look.

1217
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,508
I know you don't want me
getting hurt. I get that.

1218
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,639
But I made twice as much
money my last fight.

1219
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,930
I don't think my body
can take 30 more fights.

1220
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,268
Yeah.

1221
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,438
I'm just saying, if I could actually
win a few more, I could fight less.

1222
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:09,737
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

1223
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,944
Okay. Well, then you need
to get good at striking.

1224
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:14,984
Fast.
Yes.

1225
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,236
I know the best guy
for that, but...

1226
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,283
He probably won't take you.

1227
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,912
This isn't you
learning anything.

1228
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,621
This isn't me
teaching you anything.

1229
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,424
This is me seeing if
you're worth my time.

1230
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,544
Is it hot in here?

1231
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,042
I cranked the heat to 90.

1232
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,339
This way,
you get a nice sweat going.

1233
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,049
You good with that?
Oh, yeah, no.

1234
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:33,844
Really brings out the smell of the place.
Oh, yeah. Good.

1235
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,470
Which guy am I fighting?

1236
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,884
Both.

1237
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,204
Come on,
I can't fight two guys.

1238
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,265
That's perfect.

1239
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,139
I can't train a 42-year-old
biology teacher.

1240
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,397
Your boy is good,
but he's got no offense, man.

1241
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:50,728
You know, he's a wrestler,

1242
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,484
and he picks up fast,
and he's tough.

1243
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,613
They're all smiling.
Everybody's smiling and happy.

1244
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:10,998
Mel, time to eat.
Go have some fun.

1245
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,334
Whoa. This is going to be funny.

1246
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,462
Boom!

1247
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,885
Three? Really?

1248
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,094
Hey, am I good outside?
I'm parked outside here.

1249
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,224
Yeah, you got two hours.

1250
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,555
Yeah? All right.

1251
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,728
Yeah, those are hits.

1252
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,733
Come on, give him a break.

1253
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,328
All right, boys, that's good.

1254
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,627
I'm good, man.
Let's go.

1255
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,049
Come on.

1256
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,593
Boom, there we go.

1257
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,551
Guys.

1258
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,762
Hey, guys, guys, listen up.

1259
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,556
Listen up.
I got something to say.

1260
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,561
From Genesis 32:24.

1261
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,181
"And when he saw, he prevailed

1262
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,400
not against him."

1263
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,939
Jacob was tough, man.

1264
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,903
He wrestled all night
with God at Pentel.

1265
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,281
He was tired, he was beaten.

1266
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,066
He had a dislocated hip.

1267
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,901
But he refused to submit.

1268
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:24,447
By sunrise, he had
won the Lord's respect.

1269
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,744
Well, tonight, Scott...

1270
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:27,871
Oh, yeah.

1271
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,115
...you earned our respect.

1272
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,285
And then some.

1273
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,417
I just want you to
know I got your back.

1274
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,960
Whoop, whoop,
whoop! <i>Salud.</i>

1275
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,463
Let's eat, boys.

1276
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,803
That Superman Punch, Mel,
that was awesome.

1277
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,797
Yeah, that was crazy.

1278
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,095
What's the matter? You don't
like my wife's cooking?

1279
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,975
I can't lift my arms.

1280
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,271
Can you move it?
Not much.

1281
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,272
I can go, like, to right about there.
That's it?

1282
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,607
Yeah, that's it. Right there, yeah.
You're sure?

1283
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,968
I can't even move it past that.

1284
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,140
You dislocated your shoulder.

1285
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,524
You have to go to the hospital.

1286
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,280
Last time I went
to the hospital,

1287
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,403
it actually cost me more
than I made in the fight,

1288
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,534
so you got to help me.

1289
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,115
But I would have to reset it.

1290
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,956
Look, whatever you got to do,
then make it happen.

1291
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,083
All right. All right.

1292
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,379
Okay, you got to go
easy first. No, no, no.

1293
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,456
Okay.

1294
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,050
Foot not going there.
All right, all right.

1295
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,877
No, you're right. You're right.
I just got to find

1296
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,007
the right angle over here.

1297
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,413
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Come on.

1298
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,805
Okay, okay, you're
going to be all right.

1299
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,299
You're going to be all right.
You can't go above.

1300
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,892
Okay, okay,
that's past the level

1301
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,607
that I just said
I can't go, though, okay?

1302
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,852
Geez!

1303
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,054
I'm sorry. Don't worry.

1304
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,499
You're going to be all right.
Okay.

1305
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,812
You're going to be okay. Okay.
Okay.

1306
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,318
Now, I just got to get in here.

1307
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:37,812
Easy, okay?
I have to get in there.

1308
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,813
That hurts.
All right?

1309
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,448
You ready?
Yeah.

1310
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:42,699
Always wanted to try this.

1311
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,896
Try this? What do you mean?
You've never done this...

1312
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,280
Are you okay?

1313
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,706
Oh, my...

1314
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,575
Are you okay?
It's back in, I think.

1315
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,830
Oh!

1316
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,462
I did it! I did it!

1317
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,710
I was a little worried,
but I did it.

1318
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,674
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

1319
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,259
That was fun, no?

1320
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,461
No.

1321
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,676
A little jambalaya
for mama? No?

1322
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,389
No, get away... Get away
from me, you crazy woman.

1323
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,803
Good night, Scott.

1324
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,600
Voss.

1325
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,056
My office. Now.

1326
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,403
Come on in.

1327
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,147
Close the door.

1328
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,694
Sit down.

1329
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,111
I'd like you to meet Malia's
father, Mr. De La Cruz.

1330
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,241
How are you?

1331
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,535
Who the hell do you
think you are, Mr. Voss?

1332
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,495
Telling my daughter
to disobey me?

1333
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,541
I didn't say that.

1334
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,629
I said... I said that...

1335
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,424
And is it true
you're getting paid to fight?

1336
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,045
It's Mixed Martial Arts.

1337
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,375
What's this all about?

1338
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,550
It's about our teachers not
promoting dangerous situations.

1339
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,343
Look, it's a sport.

1340
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,516
It's no more dangerous
than boxing or auto racing.

1341
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:50,801
And believe me,
I wouldn't be doing it

1342
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,227
if you'd been doing your job.

1343
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,017
Did you really think
that you could save

1344
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,723
the music program
by doing this?

1345
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,814
I'm just trying to
make things better.

1346
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,891
You know what?

1347
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,318
You're not making
things better, Scott.

1348
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,393
You're putting on a show.

1349
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,812
You're getting beat up
in your bathing suit.

1350
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:03,442
You are embarrassing
this school.

1351
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,243
You know why I did this
in the first place?

1352
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,742
Because a wise man once said,

1353
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,202
"Without music,
life would be a mistake."

1354
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:10,824
Yeah, and do you know
who that wise man is?

1355
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,984
Marty Streb, the teacher
you're trying to get rid of.

1356
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,074
Scott...

1357
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,076
There's nothing here any more.
We're failing your daughter.

1358
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,373
We need good teachers.

1359
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,045
Yeah, well, fighting in a cage
is not going to make you

1360
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,964
a good teacher, Scott.
You know, maybe you're right.

1361
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,549
I'm not even that good
of a fighter.

1362
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,841
I'm out there
getting my ass kicked.

1363
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,419
Believe me, this wasn't Plan A,

1364
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,824
but I don't know
what else to do.

1365
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,513
Look, you're having a tough
time with your business.

1366
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,760
I get it.

1367
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,641
But you can't
take it out on Malia.

1368
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,223
Mr. De La Cruz, I'm sorry that you
had to listen to any of this.

1369
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,929
No, no, no.

1370
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,603
It's all right. What do you
suggest I do, Mr. Voss?

1371
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,937
My chef left.

1372
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,605
That means I'm in
the back cooking.

1373
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,313
Sol need my daughter up front.

1374
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,565
It sucks, okay?
Nobody's saying it doesn't.

1375
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:48,776
But it's not your
daughter's problem.

1376
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,110
It's yours.

1377
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,365
No.
You're the problem, Scott.

1378
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,413
This is none of your business.
None of your business.

1379
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,705
I've had it with you!

1380
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,828
You know what?
We should be working

1381
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,409
as hard in here as
you do out there.

1382
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,415
And I'm sorry, but we're not.

1383
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,292
And that is the problem.

1384
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:02,581
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1385
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,916
I have a class to teach.

1386
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,000
And then I got to roll around

1387
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,585
with a sweaty guy from Holland.

1388
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,646
Whoa. What's going on,
Mr. Voss?

1389
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:23,485
Biology, Derrick.

1390
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,315
Fair enough.

1391
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,074
Can someone tell me what
happens when a cell stagnates?

1392
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,074
Okay,
no one is listening to me.

1393
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,205
I will try again.

1394
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,332
Anyone know what happens
to a stagnant cell?

1395
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,628
What's he doing on the table?

1396
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,107
I don't know,
something about cells.

1397
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,508
Malia.

1398
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,552
It's not good.

1399
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,176
Did you hear that?

1400
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,847
It ain't good.

1401
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,012
People, a cell
that is not in motion

1402
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,181
is not a productive member
of the system.

1403
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,691
It ends up assuming
all the other cells

1404
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:03,809
are gonna pick up
the slack somewhere.

1405
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:04,939
But they don't.

1406
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,895
In fact,
they imitate the stray cell

1407
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:11,567
until basically the whole
organism begins to die.

1408
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:13,819
Yeah.

1409
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:14,949
But you know what?

1410
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,826
Biology is an amazing thing.

1411
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,992
And here's the good news,
all that decays

1412
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,377
can be restored.

1413
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,005
Is this hitting anybody?

1414
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:31,216
Like how a cut heals.

1415
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:32,846
Brian, my man.

1416
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,385
Look, you got one!

1417
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:36,759
And once that
cell's back on track,

1418
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,100
it creates energy
amongst the other cells.

1419
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,223
That's what happens.

1420
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,561
It starts getting
a little movement going.

1421
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,017
It gets a little rumble.

1422
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,770
Can I get a little rumble
from everybody?

1423
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,358
Everybody just rumble in
your seats right now for me.

1424
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,525
Just rumble a little bit.

1425
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,069
Okay, no rumble, that's fine.

1426
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,466
I'll be the
lone rumbler up here.

1427
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:51,065
That's what I am.
I'm a lone rumbler.

1428
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,309
But then the cell starts
banging into the other cells.

1429
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,951
And the cells push back and go,

1430
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,036
"Hey, what are you doing to me?"
They hit into another one.

1431
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:58,580
"Hey, don't do that!"
"Hey, that's my friend."

1432
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,817
"You don't even know him!"
"You don't know me either!"

1433
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:05,291
And they're
rumbling everything around.

1434
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:08,416
And once that happens,
it's like a mosh pit!

1435
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,710
They're goin' crazy...

1436
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,095
"I know you,
we work together!"

1437
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,555
Because then,
they hit a rhythm.

1438
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,303
They all hit a rhythm.

1439
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:20,268
And this is the beginning
of the restorative process.

1440
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,270
So now,
even if the entire system

1441
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,308
is close to dead, what happens?

1442
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:27,855
Martinez, come on.

1443
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,402
Give me something.

1444
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,524
Oh, no, not today.

1445
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,026
Oh, no, not in my house.

1446
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,152
No, no, no, no.

1447
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:35,275
Look out, here we come.

1448
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,803
Don't look up
my pant leg, Derrick.

1449
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,786
You're better than that.
I'm right over you.

1450
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,497
Come on, man.

1451
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:43,663
What do you say?

1452
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:48,417
If all the cells work
together, what will happen?

1453
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,639
The entire system is healed.

1454
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,430
Exactly.

1455
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,306
That is a sick dragon.

1456
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:03,683
Yeah!

1457
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:08,183
Move it! Come on,
Scott, keep working.

1458
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,232
Hey, you know what?

1459
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,655
You look as good going
as you do coming.

1460
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:16,525
And you, my friend, sat in gum.

1461
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,785
Please be gum.

1462
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:23,115
Okay, so how many years
is a term of the president?

1463
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:25,333
A president serves a term

1464
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,875
of two years?

1465
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,622
Ah, come on.

1466
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,503
I can't remember this stuff.

1467
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,592
Okay,
what's your favorite song?

1468
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,669
My favorite song?
Mmm-hmm.

1469
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,883
<i>Faithfully.</i>

1470
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,381
The Journey song?

1471
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,470
Yes.

1472
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,357
Niko. I know it.

1473
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:56,864
That's a great song.

1474
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,862
They don't make them
like that any more, right?

1475
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,368
Well, this is good.

1476
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,032
Okay, let's try this.

1477
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,633
Ah, that's beautiful.

1478
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:16,881
Thank you.

1479
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,254
And it goes with the lyrics.
I know.

1480
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,379
You try it.

1481
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,509
Yeah, right.

1482
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,386
Okay.

1483
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:29,889
Yes.

1484
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,739
Nice!
Aha!

1485
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,701
Oh, my friend!

1486
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,536
She is unbelievable!

1487
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,292
You are unbelievable.

1488
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,414
I told you.

1489
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,540
More later.

1490
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,840
Now put him down,

1491
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,418
'cause we have
a fight to go to.

1492
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,590
Let's do this.

1493
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:11,102
It wasn't a tap.
It wasn't a tap.

1494
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,767
I was just fooling around.
I was just fooling around.

1495
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:32,119
Obey my commands at all times.

1496
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,668
The corner of the ring's
broken, so I'd avoid it.

1497
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,764
The carbon dioxide molecules

1498
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,646
get excited through a collision
with the nitrogen molecules,

1499
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:56,984
and then there's a whole
bunch of excitement.

1500
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,315
Derrick?

1501
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,484
And 15, 16,

1502
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,652
17,18...

1503
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,821
Oh, nice head movement, yeah!

1504
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,373
Cover up, just cover up!

1505
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,713
I think you're
wearing him down!

1506
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,707
Watch out, watch out.

1507
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,334
Back him up, back him up!

1508
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,365
Do not lose that grip!

1509
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,677
You know what to do.

1510
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:28,391
Put your weight on him.

1511
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:29,805
Don't lose your grip!

1512
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,479
Don't lose your grip!
Don't lose your grip!

1513
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:37,525
He lost the grip.

1514
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,144
Thank you, Mr. Voss.

1515
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,695
You got it, man.

1516
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,626
Don't let him lock
your arm in place!

1517
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:56,749
Scotty, pound him!

1518
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,213
Use your elbow.
Got it!

1519
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,546
Use your elbow!
Hey!

1520
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,549
I'm giving
the instructions here.

1521
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,085
No, I'm just saying
he should use his elbow.

1522
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,210
I'm trying to help.

1523
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,882
One voice.

1524
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,256
No, you shush!

1525
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,860
The other gentleman
is using his elbow

1526
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:10,509
and it seems to be working.

1527
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,560
Can we have this argument
on the car ride home?

1528
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,687
Yeah!

1529
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:26,032
Here's what happens.

1530
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,859
Okay, you know what?
We should all...

1531
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:30,741
Use your elbow!
Use your elbow!

1532
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,958
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1533
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,084
Voss is a winner!

1534
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,252
Wow.

1535
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:48,589
All right, everybody,
let's get our story straight.

1536
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,090
Derrick did it.

1537
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:51,424
"Derrick did it"?

1538
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,306
Hi.
Hey.

1539
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,930
Inspiring your students, I see.

1540
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:58,728
Yeah, with a touch
of vandalism, yeah.

1541
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,700
Hey, listen,
in case you haven't noticed,

1542
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,612
I'm standing and I just...

1543
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,741
That offer for dinner is...
It's still out there, so...

1544
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,735
Okay.

1545
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:14,243
So if I was to let you cook for
me, and I'm not saying I am,

1546
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:16,624
what would you cook?

1547
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,077
I'll tell you what.

1548
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,833
You name it, I'm cooking it.

1549
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,417
Really?
Yeah.

1550
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,583
Hey, which one of
these should I go with?

1551
01:07:25,667 --> 01:07:28,341
Volcano or Enigma?

1552
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,134
Hey, what are you doing?

1553
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:33,134
This is <i>coq au vin</i>. The sauce
is extremely delicate.

1554
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,386
You know what, I'm just gonna go
with both, let 'em fight it out.

1555
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,141
Fight, boys!

1556
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,772
I haven't
seen you like this in years.

1557
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,224
What are you talking about?
I'm jealous.

1558
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,354
You're passionate
about something.

1559
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,647
Someone.

1560
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,520
What do you mean?

1561
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,363
You got the kids,
you got Lauren,

1562
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,823
you got your business.

1563
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,780
Yeah, I know,
but every night I come home,

1564
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,030
and at least one kid's
locked in a cabinet.

1565
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,620
Last night, Lauren says good night
to me by throwing a yogurt at me.

1566
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,494
And my business is killing me.

1567
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,831
Pepper.

1568
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,288
I thought you loved painting.

1569
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,459
Yeah.

1570
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:03,379
But when Dad died, I just kept going
with the business, you know?

1571
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,873
It wasn't my dream.

1572
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,049
Okay, we are done.

1573
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,509
It's perfect.

1574
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,220
You got to go after
your dreams, Eric.

1575
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,214
I mean,
if you don't make an effort,

1576
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,460
nothing's ever gonna change.

1577
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,508
You think?

1578
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,101
Absolutely.

1579
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,099
You got to find your passion
and then let it guide you,

1580
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,225
let it envelop...

1581
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,689
She's here. You're out of here.
Already?

1582
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,566
Oh, yeah. Just two
minutes, stir the sauce!

1583
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,187
Here you go.

1584
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,398
Wow, this is beautiful.

1585
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:34,073
You know, you picked
a very delicate dish.

1586
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:38,164
The sauce there is extremely,

1587
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,537
it's delicate.
Hope you like it.

1588
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,704
Well, let's see.

1589
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,543
How do you like it?

1590
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,421
It's incredible.

1591
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,381
You made this?

1592
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,421
Yes, I made it.
I told you I made it.

1593
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,423
I made it.
Of course I did.

1594
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,141
Okay.

1595
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,053
Where does coq
au vin come from?

1596
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,433
Coq au vin

1597
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,148
is of Turkish descent.

1598
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,270
It's from...

1599
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,560
No. It's French.

1600
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,070
No, the name is French.

1601
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,356
Coq au vin is of, obviously...
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

1602
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,907
But, no, where do you think
they get their poultry?

1603
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,182
They get it all out of Turkey.

1604
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,794
Hence the name, Turkey.
It's all fowl...

1605
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,655
No, it's all...
It's a bird country.

1606
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,578
It's honestly...
Okay.

1607
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,380
Whatever restaurant
you ordered this from,

1608
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:25,249
it's amazing, so make sure
you thank the chef.

1609
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,375
And you just did.

1610
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,580
The chef, me.

1611
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:28,711
To the chef.

1612
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,837
To the chef.
To me.

1613
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,008
Whoever it is.

1614
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,802
It's me. I did it.

1615
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,718
So, I saw one of your
fights on the Internet.

1616
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,174
Checking me out.

1617
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,884
All right. I see where
you're going with this.

1618
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,594
How'd I do?
I don't understand.

1619
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:44,522
When you are asking me out, you
are as stubborn as a badger.

1620
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,017
And then with this guy?

1621
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,609
He grabbed your
hand and you're like,

1622
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,645
"I give up,
I give up" in two seconds.

1623
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,772
Okay. First of all,

1624
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,983
it's "stubborn as a mule",
it's a mule.

1625
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,577
Second of all, he had me
in an arm bar, okay?

1626
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:58,949
Do you know what an arm bar is?

1627
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,122
If I didn't tap out,
he's gonna break my arm,

1628
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,244
so that's what you do.

1629
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,449
That's what you do

1630
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,617
when you give up.
You know what?

1631
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,918
Do me a favor, stand up.
Please, stand up.

1632
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,540
Okay? I'm gonna
put you in an arm bar.

1633
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:08,837
Here, this is a
Kimura, right here.

1634
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,207
See? Feel this?

1635
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,381
Now what would you do
if I got you here, huh?

1636
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:12,504
What would you...

1637
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,172
What are you doing?
Take it easy.

1638
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:17,012
My father told me to strike
first and to strike fast

1639
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,882
and to always be the aggressor!

1640
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,262
All right, stop it!

1641
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,638
What you gonna do now, huh?

1642
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:22,844
You're gonna quit?
You're a quitter!

1643
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:23,970
You're hitting me
with closed fists!

1644
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,556
Of course I'm hitting you with a closed fist!
This is a fight!

1645
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,686
No, it's not.

1646
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,684
It's, like,
the weirdest date ever.

1647
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,485
You know what?

1648
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,733
You're sort of right.

1649
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,359
Yeah, yeah, you are right.

1650
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,652
'Cause I don't know
what I was thinking.

1651
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,824
Hey!

1652
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,242
Okay. This is definitely
the weirdest date ever.

1653
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,245
Yeah.

1654
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,834
Good night, Scott.

1655
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,003
Yep, okay.

1656
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,507
Well, this was a nice dinner.

1657
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,336
Sorry about the lamp.

1658
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,549
I wouldn't worry about it.

1659
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,190
I wouldn't worry about it at all.
You can just leave that there.

1660
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,058
You're good. All right.

1661
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,721
By the way, a little
cologne goes a long way.

1662
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,473
Yeah, no, I know. I felt it.
My eyes were burning.

1663
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:09,808
I hear you.

1664
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,291
Give it to me!

1665
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,315
Hey.

1666
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,566
Hey. Can you get
away for an hour?

1667
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,939
I got something for you.

1668
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,656
I can't, guy.
This is a bad time.

1669
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,484
This one thought
the Ex-Lax was chocolate.

1670
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:20,944
I'm up to my eyes in it.

1671
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,779
- Lauren thinks it's my fault.
- It is!

1672
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,372
Says you!

1673
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,199
Who keeps Ex-Lax in
their back pocket?

1674
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,499
I had a situation!

1675
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,747
You're a situation!

1676
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,461
Whatever!
Where do you want to go?

1677
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,543
You got to wash
your face first.

1678
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:33,957
Okay, got you.

1679
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,424
Ow! Stop kicking me!

1680
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,088
Yeah, and change your clothes.

1681
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,508
Hey, what's up?

1682
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,385
What are you doing here?
We training today?

1683
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:42,590
Nah, nah, we're good.

1684
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,308
Look, I told you
when you joined my team

1685
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,555
I had your back, right?

1686
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,887
Yeah.

1687
01:11:47,053 --> 01:11:48,933
I just thought you should
know Joe Rogan called.

1688
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,292
They want you to
fight in the UFC.

1689
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:51,648
It's 10 grand.

1690
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,771
To lose?

1691
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:53,893
Yup.

1692
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,776
Yes! Yes!

1693
01:11:57,939 --> 01:11:59,156
Niko turned it down.

1694
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,030
He what?

1695
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,453
Relax.

1696
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,907
Om...

1697
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:11,248
Let your tailbone be heavy.

1698
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,914
Om...

1699
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,416
Hey!

1700
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,049
Relax. Relax.

1701
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,427
Back to the peaceful meadow.

1702
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,100
Hey, why would
you pass on the UFC?

1703
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,356
You're not ready
for a fight like this.

1704
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:39,279
You realize we're six grand away
and the semester's almost over?

1705
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,190
It's too dangerous.

1706
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,113
Yeah. But this
could be one and clone.

1707
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,910
Hey, the UFC's the real deal,
all right?

1708
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,283
It's big-time.

1709
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,362
There's no broken cages or
chickens running around.

1710
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,949
Okay, you know what?
I got to be honest here.

1711
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,493
I don't see what
the problem is.

1712
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,961
Oh, yeah, okay.
You know the problem?

1713
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:57,461
The problem is we're the same
age, and I can kick your ass!

1714
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,879
You know, maybe we should...

1715
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:05,469
You know what?
He's up, he's okay.

1716
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,391
You're a schoolteacher, Scott!

1717
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,394
I devoted my whole life
to fighting.

1718
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,065
And you should've
been given this shot.

1719
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,440
I was good, Scott.

1720
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,440
When I was fighting, man,
I was beating everybody.

1721
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,816
I was unstoppable.

1722
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,991
And then when I got my big
break to fight for the UFC,

1723
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,318
I thought to step it up.

1724
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:30,407
And during training,
I just destroyed my neck.

1725
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,828
That was it.

1726
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,368
Over.

1727
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,286
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know that.

1728
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,417
Look, if you don't think
I deserve this fight,

1729
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,748
you know what,
I'm not gonna take it.

1730
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,083
No, you deserve it.

1731
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,880
It's just me. It's...

1732
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,675
I'll set this up.

1733
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,051
I'm sorry, bud.

1734
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:48,266
Yeah.

1735
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:54,188
It's just...
Yoga makes me emotional.

1736
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:59,398
Mr. Voss, welcome.

1737
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:00,861
Come, this way.

1738
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,363
I want to thank you
for your help.

1739
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,570
Business has never been better.

1740
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,113
Oh, that's great.
I'm so glad.

1741
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,573
Your table.
Joe. What's up?

1742
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,695
What's up, Niko?
How are you, brother?

1743
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:10,826
Scott, nice to meet you.

1744
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:11,952
I am such a big fan.

1745
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,078
Oh, thank you.
Thanks, man.

1746
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,451
Joe Rogan, wow.

1747
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,456
I showed Dana White
some of your fights,

1748
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,500
and I was there
at the Romero fight.

1749
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,001
Great job when
you put him down.

1750
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,049
That is a tough guy.
That's a serious win.

1751
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:24,047
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks so much.
- Good evening, gentlemen.

1752
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,756
I have created some
delicious lettuce wraps,

1753
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,226
prepared with very little oil
and a hint of ginger.

1754
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:35,809
Thanks.

1755
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,859
Actually, best eaten
while hot, so...

1756
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,026
Yeah, we're gonna...

1757
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,399
Enjoy.
Yep, yeah.

1758
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,481
Get out of here.

1759
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,275
Okay.

1760
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,653
Thanks.

1761
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,237
So, here's the deal.

1762
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,290
The UFC had a fighter
fall out last minute

1763
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,871
in an undercard fight
against Ken Dietrich

1764
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,749
in Las Vegas next week.

1765
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,871
Dana's a little worried
you might throw up on him.

1766
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:02,798
No, no, that was
a one-time deal.

1767
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,714
I'm telling you, it was some bad
applesauce that got away from me.

1768
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,761
It won't happen again.
Good to hear.

1769
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:09,680
Look, my daughter got
into music in middle school.

1770
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,052
It changed her life.

1771
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:14,181
And I think what you're doing
is awesome, and the UFC agrees.

1772
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,978
We'd like to give you a shot.

1773
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,813
Now, Niko,
you had some concerns?

1774
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,563
He's ready.

1775
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,144
Okay, good.

1776
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,612
I'm gonna grab one of
these lettuce things,

1777
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,010
and I'll see you boys in Vegas.

1778
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,274
All right, Joe, thanks.
Good luck, sir.

1779
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,858
Wow. Thank you.

1780
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,280
You got yourself a fight!

1781
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,698
Fight!

1782
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,819
Okay. I can't believe
that we're doing this.

1783
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:34,868
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

1784
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,494
Oh, my God, I love you guys!

1785
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,617
I really do.
Take it easy, Marty.

1786
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,123
Oh! Listen,

1787
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,459
I have a window seat
and I pee a lot.

1788
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,211
Do you mind if I...
Okay, we're switching seats.

1789
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,958
Thank you very much.

1790
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,506
I'll be right back, honey.

1791
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:48,627
Okay.

1792
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,892
Hey, Scott. Can I talk
to you for a second?

1793
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,303
Sure.

1794
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,062
I just want to tell you
how grateful we are

1795
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,353
for everything you've been
doing for my family.

1796
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,309
It's been an honor.

1797
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,019
He's my hero.

1798
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,148
Mine, too.

1799
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:08,981
Thank you.

1800
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:12,489
All right, you gonna
wish me luck or what?

1801
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,494
Please be careful.

1802
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,953
Niko says this guy you're
fighting is really dangerous.

1803
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:20,032
Look, I'm going in there,
I'm gonna lose the fight,

1804
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,703
get my 10 grand,
and I'm getting out.

1805
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,339
I know you really want
to kiss me right now.

1806
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,170
But I think we have
something special here,

1807
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,722
and I don't want
to rush the magic.

1808
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,466
Okay, first of all, do you
know anything about magic?

1809
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,926
'Cause magic has to be rushed,

1810
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,226
otherwise you can see
how the trick is done.

1811
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:39,846
So, bring it in.

1812
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,494
Give him your best shot, Scott.

1813
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:56,741
Right here.

1814
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,085
Mmm-mmm.

1815
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,287
What is that?

1816
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:47,959
Cherry cheesecake, guy.

1817
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,832
That looks heavenly.

1818
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:50,962
Could I have one?

1819
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,426
Thank you so much.

1820
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:53,632
Give me a slice, guy.

1821
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,173
Oh, wow.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1822
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,303
Wow!

1823
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,183
Wow.

1824
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,178
Yeah. You know what,
give me a little bit...

1825
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,638
Hey!
What?

1826
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,105
What are you doing, man?
Just a little bite.

1827
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,439
No way,
you're fighting tomorrow.

1828
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,140
Come on.
I made weight today.

1829
01:18:08,141 --> 01:18:09,439
- Doesn't matter.
- Bro, you've been eating clean

1830
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:12,105
for six weeks. You eat this
crap and you'll be lethargic.

1831
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,940
I don't care if
I'm "lethargic."

1832
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,195
One bite, come on, man.

1833
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:16,613
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.
Stay strong, Scott.

1834
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,194
After the fight.

1835
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,324
Have it after the fight.

1836
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,526
Fine, just give me a smell.

1837
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:21,576
Can I get a smell of it?

1838
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,776
Can I get a sniff in there?

1839
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:23,828
Here you go.

1840
01:18:24,283 --> 01:18:25,284
Look at him.

1841
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,461
I'll take it.
I'll take it.

1842
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:28,788
Guy, he's fighting tomorrow.

1843
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:31,169
Oh, it's on, man.

1844
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,542
It's on, boom, man.

1845
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,130
It's on!
You want some?

1846
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:35,385
Boink!

1847
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,134
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1848
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,181
Come on, guys.
We're making a mess here.

1849
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:41,721
Look, we represent the UFC.

1850
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,749
Let's act like it's not our
first time to the dance, okay?

1851
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,059
I'm getting a call.
Hold on a second.

1852
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,485
No claws, no claws.

1853
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,687
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Take it easy.

1854
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,052
He's right,
we're making a mess.

1855
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,562
Let's take it down a notch.

1856
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,412
Want some of this?

1857
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,663
What are you... Oh!

1858
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,578
What you want?

1859
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:10,663
Hey, you want some?

1860
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,008
Hello?

1861
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,463
<i>Hi, it's Bella.</i>

1862
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,294
Hey. Glad you called.

1863
01:19:17,378 --> 01:19:18,675
<i>Did you hear the news?</i>

1864
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,010
<i>Elkins was arrested today.</i>

1865
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,221
What?

1866
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:24,343
Oh, it's horrible.

1867
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,930
Apparently, he's been embezzling
from the school for years.

1868
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,853
You're kidding me.

1869
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,354
He took it, Scott.

1870
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,862
<i>All the money that you raised
for the music program,</i>

1871
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,273
<i>it's gone.</i>

1872
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:38,983
It's over.

1873
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:40,363
<i>Just come back.</i>

1874
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,989
I can't. I got to do this.

1875
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,537
<i>The money is gone, Scott.</i>

1876
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,364
There's nothing
to fight for any more.

1877
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,408
<i>Nothing to fight for?</i>

1878
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,419
I mean, everyone's
quit on these kids.

1879
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:52,709
Elkins, the system,
the school, even me.

1880
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:54,214
I can't...

1881
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,000
I can't do it again.

1882
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,085
<i>I don't want you to get hurt.</i>

1883
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,507
You're a teacher.

1884
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,946
What are you teaching these kids
if you go through with it?

1885
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,221
What am I
teaching them if I don't?

1886
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,858
Can I call you later?

1887
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,025
<i>Sure.</i>

1888
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,398
<i>Bye.</i>

1889
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:16,945
Okay, bye.

1890
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:28,916
<i>Hi, again, everybody.
I'm Mike Goldberg.</i>

1891
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:31,619
<i>Welcome to UFC 176.</i>

1892
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,287
<i>We are live in Las Vegas.</i>

1893
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,631
<i>Sold-out MGM
Grand Garden Arena,</i>

1894
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,591
<i>where, later tonight,
in our main event,</i>

1895
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,133
two of the best heavyweights in
the Octagon today will collide.

1896
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,847
Joe Rogan, my partner,
that is a great fight.

1897
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,299
Fantastic matchup.

1898
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,677
Shane Carwin versus
Junior Dos Santos.

1899
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,513
Two of the best
heavyweight knockout artists

1900
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,519
in the sport collide tonight.

1901
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,813
<i>We also have a very interesting
UFC debut tonight.</i>

1902
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,063
<i>Scott Voss, a biology
teacher from Boston.</i>

1903
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,489
<i>Now, here's the good news,</i>

1904
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,700
<i>he was a Division 1
college wrestler.</i>

1905
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,654
Here's the bad news,
that was 20 years ago,

1906
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,702
and he's facing Ken "The
Executioner" Dietrich.

1907
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,824
<i>And everyone
around the world knows</i>

1908
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:14,499
<i>how vicious and dangerous
Ken Dietrich can be.</i>

1909
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,338
<i>And I think he's gonna
be looking to make</i>

1910
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,628
<i>a huge statement tonight
against the UFC newcomer.</i>

1911
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,881
Let's get UFC 176 underway.

1912
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:11,976
All right, guys.

1913
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,599
We should start heading out.

1914
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,102
Hey. I need you to
forget about Elkins.

1915
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,232
All right?

1916
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,696
No matter what happens tonight,

1917
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,115
I promise you, we are gonna
figure this thing out.

1918
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,442
Look at me.

1919
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:27,617
I need you.

1920
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,286
Okay.

1921
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:31,705
All right.

1922
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:36,294
<i>Voss and Dietrich,
what a great story.</i>

1923
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,710
<i>Biology teacher from Boston
making his UFC debut.</i>

1924
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:41,374
<i>And Dietrich is angry.</i>

1925
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:44,085
<i>He's looking for
the highlight-reel knockout.</i>

1926
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,211
<i>He was supposed to be
fighting a top-20 contender.</i>

1927
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:49,424
<i>That fell out, and he takes this
schoolteacher fight on last minute.</i>

1928
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:51,016
<i>He's trying to send a message.</i>

1929
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,559
<i>He's trying to tell
the world that Scott Voss</i>

1930
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,477
<i>does not belong in the Octagon.</i>

1931
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,430
Amen. Let's do this.

1932
01:22:56,555 --> 01:22:57,977
Amen.

1933
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,526
It sounds different.

1934
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,448
Yeah, it does sound different.

1935
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,501
Come here.

1936
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:20,087
You're not gonna believe this.

1937
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:29,804
How did they...

1938
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:34,101
You put this all together?

1939
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,678
Wasn't me.

1940
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:40,107
How did you do this?

1941
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,517
I called him.

1942
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,444
Be safe.

1943
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,904
Thank you.

1944
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,479
He looks good.

1945
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,776
He does look good.

1946
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:29,981
Got nothing on you though.

1947
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,112
My little fireplug.

1948
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:32,488
Aw.
Yeah.

1949
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,656
"Fireplug."

1950
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,827
It's a compliment.

1951
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:51,799
Okay.

1952
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:55,007
No matter what happens,
I'm so proud of you.

1953
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,316
This is great. Come on!

1954
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:06,985
All right, Scott, let's go.

1955
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,903
Get up there, baby, let's go.

1956
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,615
Getup!

1957
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:10,420
Good song, man.
Good song. It's a scary song.

1958
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,300
Don't worry about it.
It's a cool song.

1959
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:42,080
You go first.

1960
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:43,953
Hey, look at him right there.

1961
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,667
He's got no business
being in here with you.

1962
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,253
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this fight is three rounds</i>

1963
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,589
<i>in the UFC
Heavyweight Division.</i>

1964
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:54,672
<i>Introducing first, fighting
out of the red corner,</i>

1965
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:58,263
<i>out of Boston, Massachusetts,
Scott Voss!</i>

1966
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,558
Mr. Voss! Mr. Voss!

1967
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:16,277
<i>And now
introducing his opponent,</i>

1968
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:18,324
<i>fighting out of
the blue corner,</i>

1969
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,656
<i>out of Lake Forest, California,</i>

1970
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:26,500
<i>Ken "The Executioner" Dietrich!</i>

1971
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,709
Come on!

1972
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:30,500
Kill him, baby!

1973
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,215
<i>And when the action begins, our
referee in charge, Herb Dean.</i>

1974
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:40,930
All right, gentlemen.

1975
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:43,054
We've been over the rules
in the dressing room.

1976
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:44,851
Protect yourself at all times.

1977
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,808
You're gonna
follow my instructions.

1978
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,101
<i>We're gonna keep it
clean, everything above the belt.</i>

1979
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:50,690
<i>We're gonna keep
our hands closed.</i>

1980
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,268
<i>No grabbing the fence.</i>

1981
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,227
<i>We're not gonna
grab the shorts...</i>

1982
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:10,623
All right, gentlemen.

1983
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:13,372
Touch gloves,
let's make it official.

1984
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:24,762
<i>Hey, take it to the ground
as fast as possible.</i>

1985
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,476
Let me ask you guys something.

1986
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,433
How much do I get if we win?

1987
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:33,859
What are you saying?

1988
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:35,318
I know what he's saying.

1989
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:36,687
Fifty grand.

1990
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:37,945
Holy smoke.

1991
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,073
Let's win this thing.

1992
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,320
Yeah!
That's right.

1993
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:42,616
Go get him, kid.
I like it.

1994
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:46,617
<i>UFC debut for Scott
Voss, the biology teacher.</i>

1995
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,912
You ready to fight?

1996
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:54,162
You ready?

1997
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:56,922
Let's do it.

1998
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,090
Here we go!

1999
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:06,175
<i>Oh, huge Superman Punch
right out of the gate!</i>

2000
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,552
Cover up!

2001
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:11,805
Cover up, Scott! Cover up!

2002
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:16,981
<i>Big hooks to
the body and the head!</i>

2003
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,900
<i>Dietrich is swarming him!</i>

2004
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:43,466
Cover up, Scott!

2005
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,549
<i>Dietrich is lethal
on the ground.</i>

2006
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:48,224
You need to get on top, Scott!

2007
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:50,435
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up!

2008
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,437
Scott Voss is in
pure survival mode.

2009
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,037
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

2010
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,156
<i>What is
keeping this guy in there?</i>

2011
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,365
Pull down, Scott!

2012
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,372
Don't stop, Scott!
Keep scrambling, buddy!

2013
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:17,003
<i>Herb Dean
right on top of the action.</i>

2014
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,250
<i>He may stop this fight.</i>

2015
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,547
Fight back.
Protect yourself.

2016
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,343
<i>Voss is in all kinds
of trouble here, Mike!</i>

2017
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,918
<i>This is ugly!</i>

2018
01:30:24,711 --> 01:30:27,214
<i>What a great round
for Ken Dietrich.</i>

2019
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:30,267
<i>And what a terrifying
first round for Scott Voss.</i>

2020
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,053
<i>You got to give him credit, though.
The kid can take a beating.</i>

2021
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,021
<i>No question about it.</i>

2022
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,936
You all right?
He is so good.

2023
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:38,688
He's so good, man.

2024
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:41,065
He hit me flush,
so freakin' flush.

2025
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,063
Oh, God. Stitch.

2026
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:44,481
I can't believe
you're working on me, man.

2027
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:45,861
It's so awesome.

2028
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,575
I'm having a crazy month
of meeting people.

2029
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,574
Welcome to the UFC, huh?
Thank you.

2030
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:51,773
It is gonna be very hard for
him to recover from that.

2031
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,408
He took some bombs
in that round.

2032
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,501
Man, so you want
to fight in the UFC?

2033
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,037
The ground is not working.

2034
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,629
No, I know. I see that.
It's not working.

2035
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,307
He's so good there.
He knows everything.

2036
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,013
Everything you taught me,
he knows better.

2037
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:04,634
Stay on your feet.
Okay, yeah.

2038
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,048
Don't get on the ground.

2039
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,549
He knows everything.

2040
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,807
<i>And, Joe, Scott Voss has
got to do something different.</i>

2041
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,844
<i>He's got to come up
with some sort of an answer,</i>

2042
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,557
<i>but I don't know what
he's gonna be able to do.</i>

2043
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,601
Ready? Ready?

2044
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,806
Fight!

2045
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,562
<i>Round two under way.</i>

2046
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,060
<i>Voss comes out swinging.</i>

2047
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:22,811
<i>He's got heart.</i>

2048
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,028
Come on, put your hands up!

2049
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:27,653
Big counter.

2050
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,826
<i>Checks the kick.</i>

2051
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:32,654
<i>Not that one.</i>

2052
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:33,905
<i>He is taking some shots.</i>

2053
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,247
<i>Oh, caught him!</i>

2054
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:37,996
<i>Oh, he gets reversed!</i>

2055
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:40,420
Voss throws him off, though.
Very nice.

2056
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,584
<i>Oh, Showtime Kick!</i>

2057
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:48,796
Get up, Scott!

2058
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,843
Pull! Guard!

2059
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,055
Keep your hands up!
Get off your back!

2060
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:55,977
<i>If Voss has
anything left in his tank,</i>

2061
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:57,604
<i>he's got to use it now.</i>

2062
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,647
<i>The Executioner may
finish this fight right here.</i>

2063
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:00,770
Get out from under him!

2064
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,351
Come on, Scott,
pull him on you!

2065
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:03,727
Oh, this might be the end.

2066
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,812
<i>Voss is getting a beating!</i>

2067
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,147
Pull down, Scott!

2068
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:08,732
- Come on!
- Get up, Scott!

2069
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:10,362
Yes!

2070
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:12,281
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

2071
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,078
Oh! Watch out!

2072
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,401
Dietrich clearly is trying to
get him out of there early,

2073
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:25,549
<i>but I am just amazed
that Voss can take all this.</i>

2074
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:28,043
<i>They might stop this fight
in between rounds.</i>

2075
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,753
<i>This guy is hurt.</i>

2076
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,100
<i>Wrong corner, guy.</i>

2077
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:37,428
<i>No, it was a good round.</i>

2078
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,270
<i>It was a good one.
It was good.</i>

2079
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:43,687
<i>No, wrong section.</i>

2080
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:44,859
<i>Follow my voice.
Come on.</i>

2081
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,025
<i>Over here.</i>

2082
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,489
Scott, listen to me, you've
got to stay away from him.

2083
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:54,615
Okay, he's got to go
back to the ground.

2084
01:32:54,736 --> 01:32:56,488
Can I say something? The ground
was just as bad, though.

2085
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:57,851
I'd really like
to say something.

2086
01:32:57,906 --> 01:32:59,626
It's the lesser of two evils.
I know, but...

2087
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,534
Hey! I need to say something!

2088
01:33:01,701 --> 01:33:03,624
Okay. Take it easy.

2089
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:06,043
I'm sorry, buddy.

2090
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,419
I don't think I'm going
to be able to do this.

2091
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:08,591
You've already done it.

2092
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,634
To hell with my job.
Look up there.

2093
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:12,345
Look at those kids.

2094
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:15,473
I got to be honest, it's a
little blurry right now.

2095
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,300
Then let me tell you
what you would see.

2096
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,010
You would see
a bunch of our students

2097
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:21,222
witnessing complete resolve

2098
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:24,103
in the face of
an unbearable obstacle.

2099
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,025
They are invested.

2100
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,899
Scott, they're inspired.

2101
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:30,735
That's what we're supposed
to do as teachers, right?

2102
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,732
Inspire.

2103
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,572
You can quit right now,

2104
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,699
and everything
that we worked for

2105
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:38,910
will have been accomplished.

2106
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,958
You know, last night,
Mollie said to me on the phone

2107
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,411
that you thought
I was your hero.

2108
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,037
You're mine.

2109
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,347
Third and final round.

2110
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,303
<i>I'll tell you what,
the third round</i>

2111
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:58,929
<i>is going to be
very interesting,</i>

2112
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:01,227
<i>'cause I don't know what they
said to Scott Voss in the corner,</i>

2113
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:02,975
<i>but he is fired up.</i>

2114
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,933
Ready? Ready? Fight!

2115
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,894
<i>Oh, look at that.</i>

2116
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,563
<i>Voss has earned
the respect of Dietrich.</i>

2117
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,490
Voss is slipping shots now, Mike.
Look at this.

2118
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:22,115
<i>He looks really comfortable
here in round three.</i>

2119
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,440
Keep moving.
Look to set it up.

2120
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,708
Counter that jab.

2121
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:34,377
<i>Oh, Voss countered
with a big left jab!</i>

2122
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,129
<i>Oh, that hurt him.</i>

2123
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,390
<i>Flying knee by Voss!</i>

2124
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:41,385
<i>Oh! He's all over him!</i>

2125
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:44,145
<i>Dietrich reverses him here.</i>

2126
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,935
Oh, he kicks him off!

2127
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,807
<i>Voss is doing damage now.</i>

2128
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,452
Follow up!
Good job! Good job! Come on!

2129
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:54,989
<i>Oh! Big body shot!</i>

2130
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,153
Oh, he's hurt again!

2131
01:34:56,274 --> 01:34:57,321
Great combination.

2132
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,309
Boom! Boom!
Go! Pull the punch!

2133
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:00,866
Honey, honey,
should they be watching this?

2134
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:01,988
They're fine!
Finish him!

2135
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:03,114
Okay.

2136
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,411
Come on!

2137
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,876
<i>Dietrich is in trouble.</i>

2138
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,578
<i>Oh, now Voss is in trouble!</i>

2139
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:10,413
Put him out of his misery!

2140
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:19,298
Oh, they are exchanging
like Don Frye and Takayama!

2141
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,580
<i>Great work in the clinch.</i>

2142
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:21,849
Come on!

2143
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,218
Go, buddy! Go!

2144
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:25,141
Both men trying to
finish this fight.

2145
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,227
Go hard!

2146
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:29,691
Go, Scott!
Go, go, go, go, go!

2147
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,695
<i>Dietrich is hurt bad, Mike!</i>

2148
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,150
<i>He's got him up!</i>

2149
01:35:38,107 --> 01:35:39,324
<i>Voss on top.</i>

2150
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,402
<i>Voss is winning this round!</i>

2151
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,160
Go! Nice!
Go, go! Let's go!

2152
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:47,917
Dietrich is getting battered.
This is crazy!

2153
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:49,953
<i>This crowd is going nuts!</i>

2154
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:51,538
<i>It is deafening in here!</i>

2155
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,794
<i>What a great flurry.</i>

2156
01:35:53,873 --> 01:35:56,126
<i>Landing punches on Dietrich.</i>

2157
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,639
<i>Oh, no! Oh, triangle!</i>

2158
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,349
Okay, don't let go.

2159
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,392
Don't let go.
Don't lose that grip, Scott.

2160
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,262
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2161
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:08,789
<i>Oh, Voss is in
trouble here, Mike!</i>

2162
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,769
<i>This is not
good for Scott Voss.</i>

2163
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:12,816
<i>Dietrich switches to an arm bar.
Voss has got to defend.</i>

2164
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:15,111
<i>He's got to keep those hands
clasped together.</i>

2165
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,314
<i>He can't let go of that grip.</i>

2166
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:19,983
Don't lose that grip!

2167
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:24,363
Do not lose that grip!

2168
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,657
Hold on tighter!

2169
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:29,792
No!

2170
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:30,910
Stack him up!

2171
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:32,036
Oh, no, it's deep!

2172
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:33,801
Come on, stack him up!
Stack him up!

2173
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:35,499
Put that body weight on him!

2174
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:37,296
Okay, Scott,
get back to that grip!

2175
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,176
You know what to do!
I showed you this!

2176
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,846
<i>Oh, Voss is in
a lot of trouble here.</i>

2177
01:36:42,005 --> 01:36:43,632
<i>He may tap.</i>

2178
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:04,861
<i>Oh, this is crazy!
He defends!</i>

2179
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,369
<i>Oh, he's got him up!</i>

2180
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:30,219
<i>Oh, he's out!</i>

2181
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:31,972
<i>- He's out!</i>
<i>- It is all over!</i>

2182
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:34,144
Yes! Yes!

2183
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:37,102
<i>Scott Voss wins his UFC debut!</i>

2184
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:39,274
<i>Scott Voss by knockout.</i>

2185
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,359
Yeah!

2186
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:48,571
He did it!

2187
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:50,456
<i>When you think
about the dedication</i>

2188
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,784
<i>this guy has shown,
the sacrifices</i>

2189
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:55,248
<i>and the risks he made,
all for those kids,</i>

2190
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:57,456
<i>that guy is a hero.</i>

2191
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,837
We won!

2192
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,391
Good job, man.

2193
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:11,227
Good job.

2194
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:15,474
Scott! Scott!

2195
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:23,649
Scott! Scott!

2196
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:24,983
Scott!

2197
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:28,611
You were awesome. You won.

2198
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,205
Are you ready to kiss me now?
'Cause I'm ready.

2199
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:34,750
I am.

2200
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:36,244
One down.

2201
01:38:36,369 --> 01:38:38,212
Go down one, this one.

2202
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,081
No, this one. One over.

2203
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:29,759
You are powerful!

2204
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:40,567
Is there anybody better? No!

2205
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:53,913
Thank you, Scott.

2206
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:55,998
Your donation was
more than generous.

2207
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:59,540
It's going to keep our school in
the black for quite some time.

2208
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:02,539
Hey, could I get
that vacation day back?

2209
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,628
Not a chance.

2210
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:06,337
Didn't think so.
Yeah.

2211
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,627
Don't you have a class?

2212
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:09,174
I do. I do. I'm going.

2213
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:10,968
Okay. Bye-bye.

2214
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:12,761
Congratulations.

2215
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,559
You are now citizens of
the United States of America.

2216
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:17,140
Yeah!

2217
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,475
I citizen!

2218
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,728
I citizen two times!

2219
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,163
- Twisty!

2220
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:37,619
Twisty!

2221
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,037
Twisty!

2222
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:49,503
<i>Viva America!
Viva America!</i>
