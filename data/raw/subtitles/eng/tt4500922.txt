1
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,956
They're late.

2
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,430
Brenda,
we're coming up behind.

3
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,510
Keep 'em busy.

4
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,710
Hang on!

5
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,190
Call it in!

6
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,550
Transport zero-one-niner,

7
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,915
we got trouble
on the rail line.

8
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,720
<i>Mile 23, send backup!
Send backup!</i>

9
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,599
<i>Roger that. On our way.</i>

10
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,352
This is crazy, Thomas!

11
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,310
Whoa!

12
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,950
Hang on.

13
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Get me closer!

14
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,630
Come on, Vince!

15
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,630
Vince!

16
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,070
Jump!

17
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,435
Shit!

18
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,075
Let's go!

19
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,189
Hey! Berg!

20
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,958
Zero-one-niner,
be advised.

21
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,633
You've taken on boarders
at the rear.

22
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,752
We're engaging the truck now.

23
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,556
Hey, Brenda, you got company!

24
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,710
Go, go, go!

25
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,200
Open fire.

26
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,830
Watch out!

27
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,830
Holy shit!

28
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,550
Thomas, you're on your own.
Don't die.

29
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,350
Good luck!

30
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,074
We gotta move. Come on!

31
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,594
Go, go! You heard him!

32
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,519
Give me the bag!

33
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,790
Shoot!

34
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,314
Get down! Get down!

35
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,990
Vince?

36
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,677
We're set! Cover your ass!

37
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,035
Go, go, go!

38
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,350
Take cover!

39
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,756
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

40
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,117
We lost the rear five.
Stop the train!

41
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,749
Newt!

42
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,359
All right, come on,
let's go. Come on!

43
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,150
Minho!

44
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,752
Minho, can you hear me?

45
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,150
This one. This one!

46
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,950
Oh, shit!

47
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,555
It's gonna be close.

48
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,710
Hello!

49
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,594
Squirrelly bastard.

50
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,879
We got 'em! We got 'em!

51
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,352
<i>Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.</i>

52
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,310
Let's go, boys.

53
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,998
Stop right there. Don't move.

54
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,517
I said freeze, asshole!

55
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,194
<i>Whatever you say, hermano.</i>

56
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,596
Hold him back!

57
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,359
Y'all don't wanna do that now.

58
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,836
Hey, Fry.

59
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,633
Good to see you guys.
Go on, back up.

60
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,280
Uh-uh-uh!

61
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,390
Hi.

62
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,639
Newt, how you doing?

63
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,995
Don't rush me.

64
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,750
Shit!

65
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,109
Newt, get up here.

66
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,350
Almost there.

67
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,990
Newt, go!

68
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,753
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know!

69
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,559
Go! There's too many of them!

70
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,639
All right, boys, we're here!

71
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,390
Keep moving!

72
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,153
- Come on!
- Lower!

73
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,070
Cover me!

74
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,830
Go, go!

75
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,275
All right, we're clear!

76
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,755
Okay, we're going up.

77
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,037
Vince, get up here!

78
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,396
Now, Vince!

79
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,756
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

80
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,793
We're going home, baby!

81
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,516
Yeah!

82
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
All right, guys!
Good job. Whoo!

83
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,196
Yeah!

84
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,715
Aris.

85
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,917
Hey, you guys okay?

86
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,070
Yeah, we're fine.

87
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,150
Jesus.

88
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,397
There you are. Oh, God!

89
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,200
It's okay. You guys are safe.
All right? Just hang on.

90
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,390
I need
the bolt cutters.

91
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,630
Are you okay?

92
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,280
I'm fine. How are you?

93
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,676
He's not here.

94
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,876
I'll take one.

95
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,479
Come on down.
You're safe here.

96
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,039
Need medical attention,
move to your left.

97
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,316
I need first aid.

98
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,994
Right this way, guys.
Come on down here.

99
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,230
Come on in, guys!

100
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,193
Okay, guys, over here!

101
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,759
All right, listen up.

102
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,433
I know you've all
been through hell.

103
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,997
I wish I could say
our troubles are over.

104
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,960
But we're not
through this yet.

105
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,111
WICKED's still out there.
They're not giving up.

106
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,472
'Cause you got
something they want.

107
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,677
They took you
because you're immune

108
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,554
to a plague that's
wiping out the human race.

109
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,393
And they think you're worth
sacrificing to find a cure.

110
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,915
Well, I don't.

111
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,515
So in two days,

112
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,635
when we get this tub
of rust seaworthy,

113
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,280
we're getting
the hell outta here.

114
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,470
We're gonna go to a place

115
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,392
where WICKED
will never find you.

116
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,756
A place you can start over.

117
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,434
A place you can call home.

118
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,433
Are you with me?

119
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,510
Come on.

120
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,273
Come on
up here. Let's get to work.

121
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,669
Come on,
I need some volunteers.

122
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,750
Let's go.

123
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,430
Let's get to work.

124
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,511
Let's get these crates
on the boat.

125
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,479
We got two days
before we leave.

126
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,797
All right.
Give me a hand up here.

127
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,354
May I help you?

128
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,279
It looks good.

129
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,994
How you feeling?

130
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,150
Awesome.

131
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,436
I was just asking.

132
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,114
I know, I know,
you're just asking.

133
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
Everybody's just asking.

134
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,749
Don't worry.
When I Crank out,

135
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,071
you'll be the first
to know, okay?

136
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,515
Here, drink this.

137
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,319
Took you guys
long enough to rescue us.

138
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,914
It's good to see
you, too, bud.

139
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,239
So what happened?

140
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,675
I fought back.

141
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,714
Tried to, anyway.

142
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,592
You're lucky
you found us at all.

143
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,797
They had us
on the move a lot.

144
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,951
It felt like something
big was happening.

145
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,113
Any idea where
they were heading?

146
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,429
All I know is

147
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,873
they kept talking
about a city.

148
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,717
I didn't think
there were any cities left.

149
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,155
That's because
there aren't.

150
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,799
Not still standing, anyway.

151
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,230
Okay, wait. What about Minho?

152
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,834
Why wasn't he on the train?

153
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,039
I'm sorry, Thomas.

154
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,435
He was.

155
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,592
They got 40,
maybe 50 kids.

156
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,160
We're still compiling
an official count,

157
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,270
but the pilot
got a good look.

158
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,430
He thinks it was them.

159
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,034
Of course it was them.

160
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,799
What about the Berg?

161
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,030
We tracked it a few miles.

162
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,435
But someone must have
known about the locator.

163
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,636
They're totally off the grid.

164
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,950
Move it, Immunes.

165
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,870
<i>C22.</i>

166
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,630
<i>B9.</i>

167
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,316
We're searching the area,

168
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,960
but they're probably
long gone by now.

169
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,752
Oh, no, they're not
going anywhere.

170
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,352
He didn't get
what he really wanted.

171
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,514
There, that's it.

172
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,795
It's a few hundred miles.

173
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,710
Based on the railways,

174
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,790
everything that Aris
told us,

175
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,519
that's gotta be
where they're headed.

176
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,273
That's where
they're taking Minho.

177
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,037
We take everyone
who can fight.

178
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,072
Follow the roads
where we can.

179
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,152
We can make it back
within a week.

180
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,390
A week?

181
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,551
It took us six months
to get here.

182
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,160
We got over
100 kids here now.

183
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,039
We can't just hang out
here forever

184
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,793
after what we
just pulled.

185
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,394
You wanna wander off

186
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,755
to some random point
on the map.

187
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,070
You don't even know
what's there.

188
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,674
I do.

189
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,200
It's been a few years,

190
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,835
but I've been there.

191
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,115
The Last City.

192
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,674
That's what WICKED called it.

193
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,672
It was their whole
base of operations.

194
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,751
If that city
is still standing,

195
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,516
<i>that's the last place
you wanna go, hermano.</i>

196
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,913
That's the lion's den.

197
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,674
It's nothing we haven't
done before.

198
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
Yeah, with months
of planning,

199
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,199
and reliable information,
the element of surprise,

200
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,430
none of which we have now.

201
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,636
Vince, I've
thought this through.

202
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,830
Would you just
hear me out?

203
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,990
The last time we
went off half-cocked...

204
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,514
I lost everything.

205
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,915
You remember that?

206
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,589
Look, I know
it's Minho. All right?

207
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,513
But you can't ask me
to put those kids

208
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,954
on the line for one man.

209
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,513
I won't do it.

210
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,593
<i>Searching the grid now.</i>

211
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,560
<i>A is completed.</i>

212
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,712
<i>Scanning B-sector now.</i>

213
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,596
Shit. Hit the lights.

214
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,955
Let's go, let's go!

215
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,079
Jeez,
they're getting close.

216
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,670
You're right.

217
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,955
We can't stay here.

218
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,478
Where do you think
you're going then?

219
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,031
Newt...

220
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,310
Don't be a twat about it.

221
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,835
I'm already in.

222
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,360
Come on.

223
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,274
No. No, not this time.

224
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,396
Look,

225
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,470
even if we find Minho,

226
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,950
there's no guarantee
we make it back from this.

227
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,510
Well, you'll need all the help
you can get then, won't you?

228
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,109
Well, we started this
together.

229
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,795
May as well
end it that way, too.

230
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,390
Okay.

231
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,639
Let's go get him back.

232
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,236
No.

233
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,030
Hey!

234
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,590
Hey!

235
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,751
Hey! No, no, no.
Wait. Hey!

236
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,719
Hey, wait, wait!
Hey, it's okay! Hey!

237
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,314
<i>How's he doing?</i>

238
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,920
<i>Breathing levels look strong.</i>

239
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,834
Oh, shit!

240
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,274
No! No!

241
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,513
<i>It's not as effective
as the maze,</i>

242
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,671
<i>but it seems to be working.</i>

243
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,160
It's promising.

244
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,400
But we'll need a larger sample
to work with.

245
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,479
<i>All right.</i>

246
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,595
<i>Carry on.</i>

247
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,078
<i>No! No!</i>

248
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,551
You want us to go in there?

249
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,678
I don't wanna come across
as too negative,

250
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,830
but if I was a Crank,

251
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,071
that's exactly
where I would be.

252
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,396
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

253
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,078
All right. I get shotgun.

254
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,794
Well, here we go.

255
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,352
Yeah, just take it
nice and slow.

256
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,511
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

257
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,118
It's okay. It's just one,

258
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,556
so take it slow,
go around him.

259
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,274
We'll be fine.

260
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,669
Take it slow.

261
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,115
Take it slow.

262
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,156
Please.

263
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,870
Please.

264
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,589
Help me.

265
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,073
Please.

266
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,197
Please! Let me in.

267
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,158
- Okay. Fry, we gotta go.
- Please! Open the door.

268
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,439
- You need to go right now!
- Why won't you open it?

269
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,590
Just floor it, Fry!

270
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,194
- Hold on!
- Floor it! Come on!

271
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

272
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,791
- Come on, Fry, shake him!
- I'm trying!

273
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,955
Go.

274
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,556
Hang on!

275
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,430
Oh, God.

276
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
Frypan, watch out!

277
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,476
Everyone okay?

278
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,515
My hand.

279
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,796
My hand.

280
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,315
Fry, cover your eyes.

281
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,038
Oh, shit. You okay, man?

282
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,078
- Yeah. You all right?
- Shit, my hand.

283
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,032
Wait! Thomas!

284
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
Thomas, the door!

285
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,718
Can you get out?

286
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,399
Oh, shit. All right.

287
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,199
- Newt, you all right?
- Fry, go around.

288
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,234
I'm trying to get out.

289
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,276
Newt, you okay?

290
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,113
Yeah, I think so.

291
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,112
Fry, you good?

292
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,759
Oh, shit.

293
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,149
Frypan, I think
we gotta move.

294
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,230
- Now!
- Wait a minute!

295
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,560
- Right now!
- Fry, now!

296
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,313
Come on, what are you doing?
We gotta move! Come on!

297
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,312
- Come on!
- Hold on!

298
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,434
- Frypan gotta go! Come on!
- Wait!

299
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,596
Come on!

300
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,279
- Nice shot, Fry.
- Thanks.

301
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,436
Okay. We gotta go.

302
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,353
Go, go!

303
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,119
Fry, come on, let's go!

304
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,358
- Fry, let's move, let's go!
- Go! Go! Go!

305
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

306
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,635
Watch out.

307
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
- Fry, you got any left?
- Yeah!

308
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,480
Okay. This way, this way!

309
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,480
Okay, Fry.
Other way, other way!

310
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,236
I'm out!

311
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,670
Shit!

312
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,910
Hey, get in!

313
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,632
- Go, Jorge, go!
- Go!

314
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,830
Hang on!

315
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,392
I'm impressed!

316
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,233
You guys almost lasted
a whole day.

317
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,751
- You good?
- Yeah.

318
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,069
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna
bring you guys into this.

319
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,870
I think what
he's trying to say

320
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,440
is thanks for saving us.

321
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,553
You're welcome.

322
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,353
Hey,
don't get your hopes up.

323
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,510
That checkpoint back there,

324
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,960
that was the city's
last defense.

325
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,113
If that was overrun,
chances are the city is, too.

326
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,149
Yeah, unless they figured out

327
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,311
some other way
to keep the Cranks out.

328
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,590
Funny...

329
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,995
Spent three years
trapped behind walls,

330
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,070
trying to break out,

331
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,391
and now we wanna
break back in.

332
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,959
Yeah. It's hilarious.

333
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,000
Jorge, how do we get in?

334
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,674
<i>Don't look at me, hermano.</i>

335
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,797
Those walls are new.

336
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,475
I guess that's WICKED's
answer for everything.

337
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,636
Well, we ain't gonna
figure it out from up here.

338
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,035
Let's go!

339
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,952
You really think
he's in there?

340
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,873
I guess we'll find out.

341
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,991
You know she's
gonna be there, too.

342
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,036
We just have to make sure
we have the resources.

343
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,193
And I'll keep in touch.
Excuse me.

344
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,794
Are you ready?

345
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,916
It'll be fine.

346
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,469
<i>People are beginning
to lose faith, Doctor.</i>

347
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,156
When you sealed off the walls,
you assured us

348
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,313
that it would only be
a temporary precaution.

349
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,557
Why have you now
denied all entry?

350
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,037
Because things are changing.
And not for the better.

351
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,594
Infection rates were up 300%.

352
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,515
Fortunately,

353
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,195
we may be on the verge
of a breakthrough.

354
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,400
This is Subject A7.

355
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,315
He spent over three years
in the Maze Trials.

356
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,757
The antibodies
produced in response

357
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,600
have been the strongest
we've ever seen.

358
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,793
We're extracting
a new serum as we speak.

359
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,474
And with your support,

360
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,352
we'd like to begin
human trials.

361
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,195
Thank you, Doctor.
That is very impressive.

362
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,919
But we have been
down this road before.

363
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,752
Frankly, we are all beginning
to wonder if...

364
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,799
If our resources couldn't be
better spent elsewhere.

365
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,474
- Meaning?
- Safe zones.

366
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,997
Protected areas
like the one we're in.

367
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,635
We could save
as many people as possible.

368
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,120
How many?

369
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,635
A thousand?

370
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,909
Two thousand?

371
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,117
And that's assuming
your protected areas

372
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,475
stay protected,

373
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,793
which we know they won't.

374
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,672
The infected already outnumber
the healthy three-to-one.

375
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,197
All you'd be doing
is delaying the inevitable.

376
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,591
Have any of you ever lost
someone to the virus?

377
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,875
A niece.

378
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,870
Anna.

379
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,840
I'm sorry we weren't
able to help her.

380
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,236
But imagine if we were able
to live with the virus.

381
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,639
To survive it.

382
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,511
Imagine being able
to tell Anna

383
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,117
that you could give her the
chance to live a normal life.

384
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,239
We've never been
this close to a cure.

385
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,709
And we've sacrificed a lot
to get this far.

386
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,350
Please,

387
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,509
don't let those sacrifices
be for nothing.

388
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,560
Nicely done.

389
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,350
They can be a tough crowd.
You handled them perfectly.

390
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,512
"Delaying the inevitable."

391
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,353
Thomas used to say
the same about us.

392
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,192
Do you still think about him?

393
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,240
I can help you with that,
those memories.

394
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,278
There's no reason
to keep holding on to them.

395
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,880
It's a simple procedure.

396
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,713
There is a reason.

397
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,912
I want to remember.

398
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,398
If we find a cure,

399
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
that's the only way all this
was worth it.

400
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,836
I hope you're right.

401
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,114
This place has really
gone through hell.

402
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,555
We just gotta stay together.

403
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,836
<i>We are the voice</i>

404
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,910
<i>of the voiceless!</i>

405
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,475
<i>They hide
behind their walls,</i>

406
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,474
<i>thinking they can keep
the cure for themselves,</i>

407
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,271
<i>while they watch the rest
of us wither and rot!</i>

408
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,352
<i>But there are more of us</i>

409
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,669
<i>than there are of them.</i>

410
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,194
<i>And I say,</i>

411
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,033
<i>we rise up</i>

412
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,238
<i>and take back what is ours!</i>

413
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,313
<i>Let's bring back a victory!</i>

414
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,034
Get Janson.

415
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,750
Let us in!

416
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,429
That's it. That's our way in.

417
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,319
Let us in!

418
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,800
To the wall!

419
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,194
Let us in!
Let us in! Let us in!

420
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,995
Thomas!

421
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,913
This is not
what you're looking for.

422
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,514
All these people
trying to find their way in,

423
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,558
you think you're gonna
find something they can't?

424
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,791
Came this far.
I'm not turning back now.

425
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,831
What the hell
did we get ourselves into?

426
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

427
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,549
Thomas, this
doesn't feel right.

428
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,240
You were right, sir.

429
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,234
The drone sweep picked him up
outside the walls.

430
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,192
Get the guns online.

431
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,436
Hey, guys, we gotta go now.
Look.

432
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,790
Let's go, let's go!

433
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,440
- Thomas, let's go.
- We gotta get out of here!

434
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,875
Let's go! Let's go!

435
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,794
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

436
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,353
Go! Keep going!

437
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,430
Come on!

438
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,395
Move!

439
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,914
Come on! Get in! Get in!

440
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,034
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

441
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,955
Come on!

442
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,600
- No way out!
- Come on!

443
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,396
Newt! Newt!

444
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,470
Get your hands
off of me!

445
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,433
No! Brenda!

446
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,114
Brenda! Brenda!

447
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,110
Go, go, go!

448
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,634
Get off me!
Get off me!

449
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,800
Send out a patrol.

450
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,160
Tell them not to come back
until he's found.

451
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,790
Let's go!

452
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,040
Get out!

453
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,230
Where you going?

454
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,116
Where is she,
you son of a bitch?

455
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,190
Hey! Hey! Hey!

456
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,953
Shit! Hey! Wait!

457
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,349
Come on,
come on, come on.

458
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,430
I'm right here.
I'm right here!

459
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,159
Okay, okay, okay.
All right. Okay.

460
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,430
I'm right here.
I'm right here!

461
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,510
Oh, Brenda.

462
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,670
Everybody relax.

463
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,558
We're all on
the same side here.

464
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,315
What do you mean same side?
Who the hell are you?

465
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,280
Hey, Greenie.

466
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,675
Gally?

467
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,120
No way.

468
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,550
No, wait!

469
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,836
Hold!

470
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
Stop! It's all right!

471
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,632
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! Stop it!

472
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,430
Stop.

473
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,996
- He killed Chuck.
- Yeah, I know.

474
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,953
I remember.
I was there too, all right?

475
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,152
But I also remember
that he was stung

476
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,993
and half out of his mind.

477
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,150
Just calm down. All right?

478
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,430
Come on.

479
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,918
Kind of had that coming.

480
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,270
Anybody else? Fry? Newt?

481
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,035
Do you know this guy?

482
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,119
He was an old friend.

483
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,916
How?

484
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,113
How is this possible?

485
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,713
We watched you die.

486
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,872
No, you left me to die.

487
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,638
And if we hadn't found you
when we did,

488
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,790
you'd be dead right now.

489
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,074
What the hell
are you doing here?

490
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,796
Minho.

491
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,959
WICKED has him here.

492
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,871
We're looking for a way in.

493
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,354
I can help with that.

494
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,190
Follow me.

495
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,952
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

496
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,989
Suit yourself.

497
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,396
But I can get you
through those walls.

498
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,437
After the maze,
I got picked up by a group

499
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,273
headed to the city.

500
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,154
They realized I was immune,
patched me up,

501
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,516
and they brought me here
to Lawrence.

502
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,280
This group's been at war
with WICKED

503
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,750
ever since they took control
of the city.

504
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,560
But WICKED can't hide behind
those walls forever.

505
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,994
Day's gonna come,
and they're gonna pay

506
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,639
for what they've done.

507
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,830
Listen, uh,

508
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,758
he doesn't get
a lot of visitors.

509
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,913
So, let me do the talking.
All right?

510
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,798
And try not to stare.

511
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,116
Rose took my nose,
I suppose.

512
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,680
Rose took my nose, I suppose.

513
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,789
Suppose, suppose,
took my nose...

514
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,749
I suppose.

515
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,196
Gally,

516
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,799
glad to see you made it back.

517
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,792
Jasper told me what happened.

518
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,710
It was a slaughter.

519
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,391
There's nothing we could do
against those guns.

520
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,396
No,

521
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,074
but they can only poke
the hornet's nest so long

522
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,993
before they get stung.

523
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,552
Now, who are these people?

524
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,393
Why are they here?

525
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,836
We need to get into WICKED.

526
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,310
Gally said you can get us
through the walls.

527
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,679
Gally should know better
than to make promises

528
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,274
that he can't keep.

529
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,151
Besides, that wall
is only half your problem.

530
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,160
Getting inside WICKED
is impossible.

531
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,152
There might be a way now.

532
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,756
But it doesn't work
without Thomas.

533
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,673
Is that so?

534
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,313
Do you know what I am...

535
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,950
Thomas?

536
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,357
I am a businessman.

537
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,400
Which means that I don't
take unnecessary risks.

538
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,118
Why should I trust you?

539
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,473
'Cause I can help you.

540
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,829
You see, if you can get me
through those walls...

541
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,752
I can get you what you need.

542
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,552
What is it
that you think I need?

543
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,230
Time.

544
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,080
Every last drop.

545
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,233
Is that what I need?

546
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,351
WICKED has something
we both want.

547
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,394
I'll tell you what.

548
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,671
Two can go for now.

549
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,190
The rest stay down here
with me.

550
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,434
Just a little insurance
to make sure

551
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,591
you find your way back.

552
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,599
We have a deal?

553
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,431
Gally, show him the way.

554
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,480
Be careful, Thomas.

555
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,638
Gally, take care of these two.

556
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,916
Yeah.

557
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,475
This is gross.

558
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,710
Jesus.

559
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,354
Yeah, this is great.

560
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,751
Stay with me.
We got a ways to go.

561
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,193
We're ready.

562
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,595
Shai?

563
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,959
Hi, Miss Teresa.

564
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,156
Hi.

565
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,350
Hey.

566
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,194
How are you feeling?

567
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,470
Okay.

568
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,752
Is that gonna make me better?

569
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,834
I hope so.

570
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,189
Do you remember the story
you were telling me?

571
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,432
About the house
you grew up in?

572
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,789
I don't remember.

573
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,599
The one by the lake?

574
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,036
It burns.

575
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,600
I know, I know.

576
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,990
There we go. All done.

577
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,633
You're so brave.

578
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,553
Oh,
that is incredible.

579
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,675
How soon can you administer
to the infected?

580
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,229
You show a lot of compassion

581
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,915
for someone who just
opened fire on a crowd.

582
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,073
You told me to do my job.
I had a shot. I took it.

583
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,275
And missed, apparently.

584
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,272
The patrols
never found a body.

585
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,598
Thomas is still out there.

586
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,512
What about her?

587
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,955
Does she know?

588
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,670
No.

589
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,550
She can't.

590
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,838
I need her to stay focused.

591
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,198
Elevate security levels
throughout the city.

592
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,359
I'm counting on you
to handle this, Janson.

593
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,510
<i>Red zone,</i>

594
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,193
<i>departing the station
in five minutes.</i>

595
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,430
<i>Thank you.</i>

596
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,918
This is a long way
from the Glade.

597
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,720
<i>Fifteen
minutes to mandatory curfew.</i>

598
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,600
<i>Please proceed home
in an orderly fashion.</i>

599
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,639
<i>Remember,
this is for your safety.</i>

600
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,790
<i>Thank you for your compliance.</i>

601
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,360
Yeah, we better
get off these streets.

602
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,877
And I know it's hard, but act
like you've seen it before.

603
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,356
They've definitely
upped security.

604
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,480
I'm guessing you shanks have
something to do with that.

605
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,033
All right,
let's get outta here.

606
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,358
All right, Newt, you're up.

607
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,795
I got it.

608
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,435
There it is.

609
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,353
If WICKED's got Minho,

610
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,113
that's where
they'll be keeping him.

611
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,480
Lawrence has been trying
to find a way in for years.

612
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,238
Place is crawling
with soldiers.

613
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,953
They got
surveillance everywhere.

614
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,078
Scanners on every floor.

615
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,552
Sounds like a bloody fortress.

616
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,791
Yeah, I thought you said
you had a way in.

617
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,510
I might.

618
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,189
You might?

619
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,312
What the hell
do you mean "might"?

620
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,435
Take a look.

621
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,079
I said I had a way in.

622
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,156
I didn't say
you were gonna like it.

623
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,911
No. There's gotta be
another way.

624
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,474
Like what?
You've seen the building.

625
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,590
She is our only way in.

626
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,674
You really think
she's gonna help us?

627
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,593
I don't plan on
asking for her permission.

628
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,989
Am I missing something here?

629
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,590
This is the same girl
who betrayed us, correct?

630
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,830
Same dick?

631
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,394
I like her.

632
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,353
What's going on?

633
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,550
What, are you afraid
your little girlfriend's

634
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,994
gonna get hurt?

635
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,436
Hmm?

636
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,116
Because this has
obviously never been

637
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,190
just about rescuing Minho.

638
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,834
Has it?

639
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,719
Wait, what are you
talking about?

640
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,200
Teresa.

641
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,390
She's the only reason

642
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,749
that Minho's even missing
in the first place.

643
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,559
Now we finally have an
opportunity to get him back.

644
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,951
And what? You don't want to
because of her?

645
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,030
Because deep down inside

646
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,190
you still care about her,
don't you?

647
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,600
Just admit it.

648
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,319
- Newt, I...
- Don't lie to me!

649
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,356
Don't lie to me!

650
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,759
Sorry.

651
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,880
I'm sorry.

652
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,320
Sorry about that. Back there.

653
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,155
I guess I can't
hide this anymore.

654
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,639
Why didn't you tell me?

655
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,792
Didn't think it would
make any difference.

656
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,040
All I know is that WICKED
must have put me

657
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,759
in that maze for a reason.

658
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,230
Maybe it was literally

659
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,476
just so they could tell
the difference

660
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,599
between immunes like you
and people like me.

661
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,712
You know we can
still fix this, Newt.

662
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,834
Okay? We can.

663
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,633
Don't worry about me.

664
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,200
This is about Minho.

665
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,753
Now he needs us.

666
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,398
So if there is even
the slightest chance

667
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,153
that we can save him,

668
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,074
we can get him out of there,
then we have to take that.

669
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,597
No matter what the cost.

670
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,640
Okay. I hear you.

671
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,959
Let's get him up.

672
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,990
<i>Minho.</i>

673
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,240
Can you hear me?

674
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,192
There's a little girl here.

675
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,753
Her name is Shai Lun.

676
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,070
She's been infected
for three weeks now.

677
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,635
But, Minho,

678
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,472
you're going to save her.

679
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,194
And you can save
so many others.

680
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,198
Everything we're doing here,

681
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,874
it's working.

682
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,714
Do you understand?

683
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,473
That's why
this is so important.

684
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,277
I just wanted you to know.

685
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,435
Teresa.

686
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,790
Minho?

687
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,470
Minho?

688
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,556
You're a traitor!

689
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,830
We trusted you!

690
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,273
- Get off!
- Hey, let her go!

691
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,792
Get off me! Get off me!

692
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,480
I'll kill you! You traitor!

693
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,632
You killed them all!

694
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,917
Teresa, they need you
in the med lab.

695
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,514
It sounds serious.

696
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,312
I'm sorry, Teresa.

697
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,997
It's not your fault.

698
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,196
You did everything you could.

699
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,474
<i>This is an alert.
Curfew is now in effect.</i>

700
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,080
<i>Anyone caught
in violation of curfew</i>

701
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,196
<i>will be subject
to immediate deportation.</i>

702
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,476
Thomas?

703
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,710
Thomas.

704
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,269
Hey, Teresa.

705
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,033
You shouldn't be here.

706
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,475
If Janson finds out
you're here...

707
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,199
I'm not staying.

708
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,956
It's just, uh...

709
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,399
I had to see you.

710
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,872
I have to ask you something.

711
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,839
Do you regret it?

712
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,993
What you did to us?

713
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,560
Sometimes.

714
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,790
But I did
what I thought was right.

715
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,074
I'd do it again.

716
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,755
Good.

717
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,197
Taking
the edge off, I see.

718
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,519
Beautiful, isn't it?

719
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,910
Yes.

720
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,672
- It's a lovely city.
- Hmm.

721
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,475
The walls.

722
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,232
It's amazing what people
can accomplish

723
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,471
when their survival's
at stake.

724
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,517
Squeeze them hard enough,
there's nothing they can't do.

725
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,235
No line they won't cross.

726
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,876
You've had a bit of a setback.

727
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,912
It's nothing
we're not used to.

728
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,513
Not this time.

729
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,231
The virus is airborne.

730
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,039
It's inside the walls.

731
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,391
That serum
was our last chance.

732
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,237
Anyone not already infected
will be inside of a month.

733
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,714
Okay.

734
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,714
We can handle this.

735
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,999
We just need to evacuate
essential personnel,

736
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,799
set up at another safe zone
farther north.

737
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,270
We've still got 28 immunes
right inside this building.

738
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,590
We can find more.

739
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,675
You would.

740
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,479
You'd hunt every last
one of them down

741
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,552
till there was no one left.

742
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,914
In spite of everything
we've done to them,

743
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,120
everything we've put
them through.

744
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,994
At least we gave
them the tools

745
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,719
they'll need to survive.

746
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,194
Maybe they'll succeed
where we've failed.

747
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,675
Are you really telling me
that you're giving up?

748
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,633
After everything?

749
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,356
It's not about
giving up, Janson.

750
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,080
It's about knowing
when you've lost.

751
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,356
Gally?

752
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,833
Here's how this is gonna go.

753
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,077
We're gonna ask you
some questions,

754
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,640
and you're gonna tell us
exactly what we need to know.

755
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,190
We'll start off simple.
Where's Minho?

756
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,237
You guys don't
seriously think...

757
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,959
Don't look at him.

758
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,679
Why are you looking at him?

759
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,910
Look at me.

760
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,358
He's not gonna help you.

761
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,157
Now, we know you have Minho
in the building.

762
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,350
Where?

763
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,997
He's with the others
in holding.

764
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,674
Sublevel three.

765
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,113
How many others?

766
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,960
28.

767
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,719
I can make that work.

768
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,759
No.
No, you guys don't understand.

769
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,957
The whole level's restricted.

770
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,672
You can't get in
without a thumbprint ID.

771
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,559
That's why you're
gonna come with us.

772
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,920
Well, I don't know.

773
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,117
We don't necessarily need her.

774
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:49,950
Right?

775
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,994
Not all of her.

776
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,633
- We just need her finger.
- Gally, back off.

777
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,110
What,
are you squeamish?

778
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,192
I guarantee you she's done
a lot worse to Minho.

779
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,794
That's not the plan.
Back off.

780
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,950
It won't make
a difference.

781
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,034
Do whatever you want to me.

782
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,714
You still won't get through
the front door.

783
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,870
The sensors will
pick you up the...

784
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,599
We know. We're tagged.

785
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,553
Property of WICKED.

786
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,072
You're gonna help us
with that, too.

787
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,470
Try to relax.
This is gonna sting.

788
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,399
Let's just get it over with.

789
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,194
She enjoyed that.

790
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,760
You're probably right.

791
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,400
Here. See if these fit.

792
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,112
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Newt.

793
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,632
Better get going,
old man.

794
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,159
Long road ahead of you.

795
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,037
You sure I can't
talk you out of this?

796
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,520
It's your last chance.

797
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,514
You know, it's not like you
to shy away from a fight.

798
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,035
And it's not like you
to go looking for one.

799
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,157
I just can't help but think
if I walk out that door...

800
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,879
I'm never gonna see you again.

801
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,752
Since when do we go sticking
our necks out for strangers?

802
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,632
I was a stranger once, too.

803
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,037
- Just don't leave us hanging.
- No.

804
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,550
Never.

805
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,551
She's looking good.

806
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,836
Healthy.

807
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,991
How've you been
getting her serum?

808
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,274
What are you talking about?

809
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,630
Brenda.

810
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,917
I didn't think
she'd still be alive.

811
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,274
When was her last treatment?

812
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,834
At the Right Arm.

813
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,832
The last time we saw you.

814
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,512
But that was months ago.

815
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,557
Thomas, that's not possible.

816
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,913
She should have turned by now.

817
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,234
There's no way she
could possibly still...

818
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,880
All right, that's enough.

819
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,750
You don't believe me?

820
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,672
Do you really
expect me to?

821
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,393
You made your choice.

822
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,552
Everything okay over here?

823
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,270
Yeah.

824
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,480
Yeah, we're done.

825
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,080
Nice try.

826
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,118
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

827
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:20,675
I don't know.

828
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,354
Just be careful.

829
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,590
You sort of have this problem

830
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,712
where you can't
walk away from people.

831
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,440
Even when you should.

832
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,230
You can't save everyone,
Thomas.

833
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,394
I can try.

834
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,715
Don't stop.

835
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,230
Go, go, go.

836
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,069
Hold on. Hold on.

837
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,190
I can get in here.

838
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,278
Stay there.
Throw me the walkie.

839
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,952
Frypan, we're in.
How you doing?

840
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,952
Yeah, I'm getting there.

841
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,111
Tell Minho "Hi," for me.

842
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,839
<i>Hang in there, buddy.</i>

843
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,435
This'll work.

844
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,274
Brenda, what's your status?

845
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,079
Status is, I'm working on it.

846
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,277
<i>Copy. Just make sure
you're ready on your end.</i>

847
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,792
Don't worry.
You know I'm gonna be there.

848
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,359
All right, let's go.

849
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,229
We got a signal.

850
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,993
Gally did it.

851
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,276
We're in.

852
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,190
Good.

853
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,239
Give me everything.

854
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,392
I want full control.

855
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,837
That's funny.
System's glitching.

856
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,479
I'll go check it out.

857
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,638
Get back, get back! Move!

858
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,080
Come on, let's go.

859
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:15,953
Get them open.
Let's go.

860
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,393
It's okay.
You guys are okay. Come on.

861
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,995
Come on, let's go.
Newt, check the other cell.

862
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,480
Come on, you guys are okay.
Come on.

863
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,913
The vault. How do I get in?

864
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,749
You can't.

865
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,035
Come on, guys. Come on.

866
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,520
Guys,

867
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,593
this might take some time.

868
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,110
Shit.

869
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,429
He's not here.

870
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,594
Where is he?

871
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,356
This really couldn't wait
till morning?

872
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,954
You realize this could
kill him, right?

873
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,269
Taking this much,
all at once.

874
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,635
I have my orders.

875
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,753
Janson wants it all.

876
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,356
Somebody's moved him up
to the medical wing.

877
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,075
Thomas, that's on the other
side of the building.

878
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,753
Okay, take me to him.
Right now.

879
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,195
All right.
I'm coming with you.

880
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,350
Newt, no, you're not.

881
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,876
You have to stay here,
wait with Gally for the serum.

882
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,997
You can't do this on your own.

883
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,435
Minho comes first, remember?

884
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,913
Just go. We're wasting time.

885
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,958
I'll get the serum.
We'll meet you out back.

886
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,638
Okay, fine.
Let's go. Come on.

887
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,876
Hey, Greenie.

888
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,636
Good luck.

889
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,795
Keep moving.

890
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,960
Come on, come on.

891
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,430
Hold it.

892
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,834
You're working late.

893
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,595
See, that's what I like
about you, Teresa.

894
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,559
No matter how bleak
things get, you just...

895
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,120
Well, you never give up.

896
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,078
Times like this,

897
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,078
you need a friend
that you can count on.

898
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,753
I'll bear that in mind.

899
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,798
There is one thing
you should know.

900
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,594
One friend to another.

901
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,473
Thomas is here.

902
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,518
A surveillance picked him up
outside the walls.

903
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:36,909
Ava didn't want you to know,

904
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,436
but there is a chance that he
may try to contact you,

905
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,000
and if he does,

906
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,074
I'd like to think that
I'd be your first call.

907
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,354
Are you going to kill him?

908
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,519
Would that be a problem?

909
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,555
This is me.

910
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,359
Thomas, you have
to listen to me.

911
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,352
Getting that serum
won't save Newt.

912
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,079
It might buy him
some time, but...

913
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,230
Just ignore her.

914
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,356
She's trying to get
inside your head.

915
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,875
Thomas, listen. You know
what's going on out there.

916
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,993
People are dying.
The world is dying.

917
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,720
There's something about
your blood I don't understand.

918
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:45,910
Open it.

919
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,229
If you let me run
some tests...

920
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,959
I promise I can protect you.

921
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,397
Yeah?
Like you protected Minho?

922
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,590
What are you doing?

923
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,080
How many people
is it gonna take?

924
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,594
How many more people
do they have to round up,

925
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,670
torture, kill?

926
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,910
Huh? When the hell
does it stop?

927
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,594
It stops when we find a cure.

928
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,592
There is no goddamn cure!

929
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,036
Don't waste your breath,
Teresa.

930
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,678
He made his choice long ago.

931
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,830
Drop it, kid!

932
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,317
Back up.
Tell them to back off.

933
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,630
Tell them to back off!

934
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,313
Hey, Thomas, come on.

935
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,709
It's me.

936
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,673
I've known you longer
than you can remember.

937
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,599
You're not gonna shoot her.

938
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,354
You don't think so?

939
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,310
Okay.

940
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,234
Go on then.

941
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,079
Shoot her.

942
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,914
Prove me wrong.

943
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,391
Shoot her.

944
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,396
Clear! Clear!

945
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,230
Move! Move!

946
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,873
Your story better be good.

947
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,759
I just did you a favor.

948
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,151
Doors are sealed.
They can't get out.

949
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,676
Janson, I need them alive.

950
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,552
- Come on. Come on!
- All right, let's move!

951
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,717
Yes, sir!
Level three, now!

952
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,360
Okay. We need to get
outta here now.

953
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,830
You stay close to me.
Stick together.

954
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,834
You, you guard this with
your life. You understand?

955
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,709
All right.

956
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,075
Let's go.

957
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,477
Lock down the building.
Send everyone up to 20.

958
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,233
And someone shut off
those goddamn sirens!

959
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,310
Yes, sir.

960
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,310
Move! Move!

961
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,636
Stay low! Stay low!

962
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,034
Go! Go! Go!

963
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,953
Go! Stay low! Stay low!

964
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,078
Brenda, where are you?
We're here.

965
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,150
Come on, let's go.

966
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,511
All right. Let's go, let's go.
Quickly, quickly.

967
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,197
Front and back,
front and back. Let's go.

968
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,635
Wait, where's Thomas?

969
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,870
I was hoping he was with you.

970
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,030
Come on.

971
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,839
Wait! Wait!
Stay here with the kids.

972
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,789
Wait here...

973
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,040
I'll find him.

974
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,112
Just wait for us, okay?

975
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,839
We're not going anywhere.

976
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,150
Anything?

977
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,390
No sign of them yet, sir.

978
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,470
Yeah, well,
they're here somewhere.

979
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,550
They can't get out. Find them.

980
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:38,670
You two, that way.

981
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:39,750
The rest of you,
follow me. Let's go.

982
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,433
- Yes, sir!
- Affirmative.

983
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,869
<i>Code 22 in progress.</i>

984
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:51,590
<i>All R-16 personnel, report
to their assigned stations.</i>

985
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,999
Get down. Get down.

986
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,552
Move! Move! Move!

987
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,114
Stay quiet.

988
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,440
Got someone here.

989
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,878
Sorry, Thomas.

990
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,029
Hey,
someone's got the bus.

991
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,190
Hold on!

992
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,755
- Watch it!
- Stop!

993
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,189
No, no, no!

994
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,355
It's all right!

995
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,230
Load up! Load up!

996
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,993
Let's go! Move it!

997
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,480
Move! Move!

998
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,313
<i>All R-16 personnel,</i>

999
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,238
<i>report to their
assigned stations.</i>

1000
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,514
Thomas! No!

1001
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,360
Minho? Minho!

1002
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,994
- Oh, shit!
- Freeze!

1003
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,190
Minho!

1004
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:49,030
Minho, where are you?

1005
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,030
Minho!

1006
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,552
Doctor,
he's coming out of it.

1007
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:57,120
Get me another sedative.

1008
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,190
Shit!

1009
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,277
Over here!
There they are!

1010
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,560
I'll cut him off!

1011
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,190
Newt, get down!

1012
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,752
Shit! I'm almost out.

1013
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,070
Get back.

1014
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,234
Nice. All right.

1015
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,470
Let's go! Go!

1016
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,716
You two, freeze!

1017
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,233
Get down on the ground. Now!

1018
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,516
I said get your...

1019
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,990
Minho.

1020
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,030
Is this real?

1021
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,870
I got him!
I got him! Over here.

1022
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:32,996
Go! This way!

1023
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,956
Come on!

1024
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,198
You three! Stop!

1025
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,469
Come on.

1026
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,196
In here, in here.

1027
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,754
Newt, come on.

1028
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,029
Somebody get this door open.

1029
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,509
Yes, sir!

1030
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,470
Oh, shit.

1031
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,440
Any ideas?

1032
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,150
Maybe.

1033
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,557
Okay, it's doable.

1034
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,354
Just need
a little running start.

1035
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,999
Almost through.

1036
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,640
You sure about this?

1037
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:06,956
Not really.

1038
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,155
Nice pep talk.

1039
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,551
Yeah, we're all
bloody inspired.

1040
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,390
- Move it! Move it!
- Shit.

1041
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,710
Go! Go!

1042
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,795
Thomas!

1043
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,440
Oh, shit!

1044
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,674
- Minho, you okay?
- Yeah.

1045
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,551
You three, don't move.

1046
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,598
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1047
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,994
Take it easy.

1048
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,034
Uh-uh-uh!
Don't even think about it.

1049
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,072
Get on your knees
with your hands in the air.

1050
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,517
You son of a bitch.

1051
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,190
Gally?

1052
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,750
Minho.

1053
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,714
You guys are nuts.

1054
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:48,399
I'll explain later.

1055
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:54,957
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

1056
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,839
Drop the net.

1057
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,796
Declare martial law. No one
leaves until they're found.

1058
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,678
It's done, sir. We already
have eyes on the bus.

1059
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,750
Our patrols are in pursuit.

1060
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,194
What bus?

1061
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,436
Shit! Hold on!

1062
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:36,470
Shit!

1063
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,279
Get out of the vehicle.

1064
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,080
Don't move.

1065
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,234
You're doing great.

1066
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,275
Now step away
from the vehicle.

1067
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,512
I said step away
from the vehicle!

1068
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,353
Put your hands in the air.

1069
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,394
Drop the weapon!

1070
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,035
Here we go.

1071
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,998
Push in! Push in! Go! Go!

1072
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,510
- That bus does not leave!
- Move! Move in!

1073
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,319
Come on, hold on to something!

1074
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,270
Here we go.

1075
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,035
Circle up! Go! Go!
Hold fire!

1076
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:33,836
Brace yourself.

1077
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,636
Sorry.

1078
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,870
Shit.

1079
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,433
Hold on to something!

1080
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,192
Okay. Everybody off.

1081
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,080
Shut up.

1082
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,313
They're not out yet.

1083
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,514
Well, they're
definitely pissed.

1084
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,200
How far are the tunnels?

1085
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,040
Uh, maybe 12 blocks from here.

1086
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,954
We can make it.

1087
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,071
Newt, how are you feeling?

1088
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,075
Terrible.

1089
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,432
It's good to see you though.

1090
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:38,950
Hey.

1091
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,832
How long has he been
like this?

1092
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,675
He'll be okay.
We just gotta get to Brenda.

1093
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:50,038
She's got the serum.

1094
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:51,714
Come on, let's go.

1095
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,280
Hey, Newt.

1096
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,352
Come on, bud.
We gotta get you up. Let's go.

1097
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1098
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:57,994
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1099
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,390
Why you helping us, Gally?

1100
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,756
I put a spear
through your chest.

1101
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,390
Yeah.

1102
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,159
Nobody's perfect, man.

1103
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,629
Lawrence!

1104
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,752
Wait, guys.
Wait, wait, wait.

1105
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,392
Where is everyone?

1106
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,920
Wait here, guys. Wait.

1107
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,915
Thomas!

1108
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,750
Hey!

1109
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,750
Lawrence!

1110
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,239
Everything's gone.

1111
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,793
Don't be scared.

1112
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,032
I may not be pretty,

1113
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,999
but we all know who
the enemies are,

1114
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,072
cowering behind those walls!

1115
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,274
They have a name

1116
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,875
for people like us in there.

1117
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:00,111
They call us Cranks!

1118
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,670
But I say that
they are the monsters.

1119
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,597
They're the ones
who started this war,

1120
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,670
but tonight,

1121
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,319
we will finish it.

1122
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,079
Follow me.

1123
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:16,872
Follow me,
and we will show them

1124
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,553
the faces of the people

1125
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,030
that they have chosen
to forget!

1126
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:28,354
Follow me
and this city is yours!

1127
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,915
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1128
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,719
Let's move it!

1129
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,674
Let's go!

1130
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,200
<i>Control,
you seeing this?</i>

1131
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,680
<i>Please advise.</i>

1132
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,870
Holy shit.

1133
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,396
Get turrets one
and two ready to fire.

1134
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,916
Guns aren't responding.
I'm locked out.

1135
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:31,680
All right. Move forward.

1136
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,757
Open fire! Open fire!

1137
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,555
We're supposed
to take down WICKED,

1138
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:58,994
not the whole damn city.

1139
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,720
Gally, come on.

1140
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,796
<i>This is
a mandatory evacuation.</i>

1141
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,793
<i>The last transport leaves
in 38 minutes.</i>

1142
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,997
<i>Please proceed to the roof.</i>

1143
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,675
<i>I repeat, this is
a mandatory evacuation.</i>

1144
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,912
Teresa, what are you still
doing here? We have to leave.

1145
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,720
No, I can't leave.
Not without Thomas.

1146
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,400
It's too late for that.
He's gone.

1147
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,553
No. You don't understand.

1148
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,120
I need more.

1149
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:42,474
Come. Look.

1150
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,994
It's not just slowing
the virus down.

1151
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,198
It's destroying it.

1152
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,911
We need to find Thomas.

1153
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,680
Tunnels are right up ahead.

1154
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,990
Shit!

1155
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,635
Hey! Stay low! Stay low!

1156
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,109
Shit!

1157
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,353
Get ready!

1158
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:21,954
All right, move up! Move up!

1159
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,675
Frontline down!

1160
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,995
Damn it!

1161
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,235
What are they waiting for?

1162
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,880
Get down, get down!

1163
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,880
Stay down! Stay down!

1164
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,316
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1165
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:02,592
Come on.
Let's move, let's move.

1166
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,318
<i>Get him in, get him in.</i>

1167
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,793
<i>Brenda, are you there?</i>

1168
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,840
Thomas, I'm here.

1169
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,152
Shit! You okay?

1170
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:32,839
We're not gonna make it.

1171
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,398
Wait, what are you
talking about?

1172
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,074
Don't let them get away!

1173
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:40,311
Just take the others.
Get everybody out

1174
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,880
<i>while you still can.</i>

1175
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,630
No.

1176
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,149
Brenda.

1177
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:48,999
I'm not leaving you.

1178
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,796
Okay?

1179
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,319
So forget it.

1180
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,993
Even though you should?

1181
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:17,520
<i>Thomas, don't worry.
I'm coming to you.</i>

1182
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,555
What are you talking about?

1183
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,557
Our ride's here!

1184
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,992
<i>Just look for us
near the tunnels.</i>

1185
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:36,631
Let's go, guys! Move!
Our ride's here!

1186
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,074
- Careful.
- Move! Move!

1187
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,237
Watch your step. Okay?

1188
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:46,756
Vince?

1189
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,752
Hey, it's good
to see you, too.

1190
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,595
Yeah, I know.

1191
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,274
I picked up a stray.

1192
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,430
Let's get out of here,
all right?

1193
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,510
We're not done yet.

1194
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,757
Thomas is still inside.

1195
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,033
Well, let's go get him then.

1196
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:03,990
- Hell yeah.
- All right, let's go.

1197
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,594
- On board. Everybody.
- Let's go! Step up! Step up!

1198
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,359
- We gotta move, we gotta move.
- Take a seat, harness...

1199
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:18,913
All right.
Newt, we're almost there.

1200
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,679
Just leave me.

1201
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:25,710
Back! Back!

1202
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,599
Let's go! Let's go!

1203
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,316
Take 'em out!

1204
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:48,874
- Okay, that's them.
- Yeah.

1205
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,235
It's them. We gotta go.

1206
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,390
- We gotta go.
- Go without me, man.

1207
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:52,516
You should just...

1208
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:02,590
Minho.

1209
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:05,836
You gotta run ahead,
grab the serum,

1210
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,957
and get back to us
as soon as you can.

1211
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,593
Minho, go.

1212
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:15,711
He's right. I can cover.

1213
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,395
Thank you.

1214
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:24,589
Thank you, Minho.

1215
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,680
Hey, you just hang on.

1216
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,919
You hear me?

1217
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,559
Go, Minho, go!

1218
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,993
Okay, they're through.

1219
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,120
Newt? Newt?

1220
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,350
Hey! Hey! Newt! Hey!

1221
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:13,599
We're gonna try this. Okay?

1222
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:16,156
We gotta move, now.
Let's get you up, come on.

1223
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,720
- Let's go, come on.
- No. No, Thomas.

1224
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:19,633
No, Newt. Later. Later.
Really gotta go.

1225
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:20,870
- Come on.
- Look, you gotta take this.

1226
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,554
- We gotta get you up, now.
- No, just take it!

1227
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,116
Please.

1228
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,636
Please, Tommy. Please.

1229
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,229
All right.

1230
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,036
All right. I need you
to give me everything you got.

1231
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:43,839
You and me, right now.
Let's go. You ready?

1232
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,952
Come on, ready? Here we go.

1233
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,952
One, two, three.

1234
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,154
Get back, guys, get back!

1235
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,310
Oh, man.

1236
01:47:08,440 --> 01:47:10,033
It's okay, guys. We're getting
out of here soon.

1237
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:11,833
We can't stay here, Bren.

1238
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,599
Don't worry. They'll be here.

1239
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,114
Come on. Come on.

1240
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,192
We're almost there, Newt.
Stay with me, come on.

1241
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,875
Newt, no, no. Hey!

1242
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:38,676
Come on.

1243
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,635
<i>Thomas?</i>

1244
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,555
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1245
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,475
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

1246
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:07,756
I know you have
no reason to trust me,

1247
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,318
but I need you to come back.

1248
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:21,191
<i>Thomas, you can save Newt.</i>

1249
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:25,157
<i>There's still time for him.</i>

1250
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,914
There's a reason
Brenda isn't sick anymore.

1251
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,273
<i>It's your blood.</i>

1252
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,675
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1253
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,473
<i>She isn't sick,</i>

1254
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,432
<i>because you cured her.</i>

1255
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:46,950
<i>She doesn't have to be
the only one.</i>

1256
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:50,997
<i>All you have to do
is come back.</i>

1257
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,996
<i>And this will all
finally be over.</i>

1258
01:48:57,920 --> 01:48:58,956
Please.

1259
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,638
Just come back to me.

1260
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,240
<i>I know you'll do the right...</i>

1261
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:22,550
Newt?

1262
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:33,914
Newt?

1263
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,074
Newt? Newt, it's me. It's me!

1264
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,310
Brenda!

1265
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,520
Where's the serum?

1266
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:57,195
Tommy, kill me!

1267
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,150
Newt, I'm here.

1268
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:09,155
Newt, please!

1269
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,554
Please!

1270
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,515
I'm sorry, Tommy.

1271
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,238
It's okay. It's okay.

1272
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,720
No!

1273
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,840
Brenda!

1274
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,759
Thomas!

1275
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,149
Stay down, stay down!

1276
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,350
Newt.

1277
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:22,390
Tommy.

1278
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,316
No, no.

1279
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,152
No, no, no.

1280
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,550
Newt?

1281
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,315
Is it true?

1282
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,590
Newt.

1283
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,560
Could I have saved him?

1284
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:09,838
You can save us all.

1285
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:33,830
It's okay.

1286
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:39,677
Just leave the others alone.

1287
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:44,474
I promise.

1288
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:49,996
I will...

1289
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,394
Oh, Thomas.

1290
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,791
You should have run.

1291
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:58,795
<i>Thomas.</i>

1292
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,036
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1293
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,791
Do you know what
this place is, Thomas?

1294
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,478
It's a lifeboat.

1295
01:56:39,080 --> 01:56:41,072
And the whole world
might be sinking,

1296
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:45,080
but doesn't mean that
we have to go down with it.

1297
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:49,233
How much longer?

1298
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:50,994
It's almost done.

1299
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:57,590
Why don't you just kill me?

1300
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,989
Kill you?

1301
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,037
No, we don't wanna do that.

1302
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,675
We're gonna take
special care of you.

1303
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,593
We'll keep you alive.

1304
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:12,436
Just.

1305
01:57:15,320 --> 01:57:16,674
And in return,

1306
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,796
you will give life
to the rest of us.

1307
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,960
The ones we choose
to save, anyway.

1308
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,554
Of course, there's not gonna
be enough for everyone.

1309
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,871
Hard choices are gonna
have to be made.

1310
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,680
In time, the Flare virus
will burn itself out.

1311
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,513
The only question is,

1312
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:40,356
who will be the ones
left standing?

1313
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:45,878
And thanks to you,
to this,

1314
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,635
we finally get to choose.

1315
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,237
A future of our own making.

1316
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,116
To your health.

1317
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:11,952
Okay, let's get out of here.

1318
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,030
Come on.

1319
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,430
No!

1320
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,238
Get back here.

1321
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:31,556
Get back!

1322
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,836
No!

1323
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,510
Give it to me.

1324
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,516
Give it to me!

1325
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:42,436
Teresa!

1326
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:19,194
Come on.

1327
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,114
Okay.

1328
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:35,515
That's enough.

1329
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,475
Weapons ready!

1330
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:49,710
On my command.

1331
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:51,758
Charge it!

1332
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,593
Ready.

1333
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:55,156
Fire!

1334
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,115
Teresa!

1335
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,992
We need to get out of here.

1336
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,439
What's wrong?

1337
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:26,756
Thomas?

1338
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,195
Thomas!

1339
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,639
- Okay. Okay, we need to...
- Oh, shit...

1340
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:41,470
Find something.
Here. Here!

1341
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,269
Just put pressure on it.
Hold it.

1342
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,155
You gotta go.

1343
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:51,039
You gotta go.

1344
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,190
No.

1345
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,440
Not without you.

1346
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,916
I admit, Teresa,
you had me fooled.

1347
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:26,717
I thought we were friends.

1348
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,031
Maybe it's just
in your nature to betray

1349
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:37,555
the people closest to you.

1350
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:46,353
Come on.

1351
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,710
Let's not prolong this.

1352
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,880
We both know
there's no way outta here.

1353
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,599
Let's not make this
any more painful

1354
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:03,637
than it needs to be.

1355
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,030
Thomas.

1356
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,030
Teresa.

1357
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:31,118
No. No.

1358
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:37,478
I think you have
something of mine.

1359
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:48,560
Not that.

1360
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,754
Where is he?

1361
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,073
Just take it.

1362
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:56,199
Leave him alone.

1363
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,113
What is it with you two?

1364
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,469
You think he's so special?

1365
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:04,312
He's a lab rat.
He was born with a gift.

1366
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:07,718
He never had to fight for it,
he never earned it.

1367
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:09,758
He doesn't deserve it.

1368
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:11,874
Maybe.

1369
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,314
But it's his.

1370
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:18,960
What about you, Thomas?

1371
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:21,874
What do you have to say?

1372
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:25,600
Don't you have enough blood
on your hands already?

1373
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,152
You might not have been
able to shoot her.

1374
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:31,039
But I can.

1375
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,871
Okay. Fine.

1376
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:38,550
Have it your way.

1377
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,070
Janson.

1378
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,314
Missed, you little shit.

1379
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,270
Did I?

1380
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,955
Oh, shit.

1381
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:08,113
Come on. We need to go.

1382
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,510
This way. Here.

1383
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:30,949
Come on.

1384
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:56,476
Come on.

1385
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:41,440
I'm sorry.

1386
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:44,400
I tried.

1387
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:50,480
I know.

1388
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:12,272
I think I got him.

1389
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,635
Yeah, that's him.
I'll get the hatch.

1390
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:14,710
All right, I got him,
I got him.

1391
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:15,790
Let's go, let's go.

1392
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:19,034
Come on.

1393
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,789
No!

1394
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,071
I can't get any closer.

1395
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:45,910
Thomas!

1396
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:49,396
Now!

1397
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:02,160
Come on, come on, come on.

1398
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:06,031
- Come on!
- Come on, Thomas!

1399
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:08,399
Give me your hand!

1400
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,639
Get closer!

1401
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:12,596
Jump!

1402
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:15,630
Lower!

1403
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,070
No!

1404
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,120
You gotta get closer.

1405
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:37,555
Come on!

1406
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,876
Yeah!

1407
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:41,833
- Come on, reach! Come on!
- Reach!

1408
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:46,715
- Pull him up!
- Pull!

1409
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:49,556
Come on!

1410
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:51,350
Come on!

1411
02:07:57,720 --> 02:07:59,074
Teresa!

1412
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:16,600
No!

1413
02:12:00,160 --> 02:12:02,072
<i>We have come
a long way together.</i>

1414
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:06,473
So many have sacrificed
so much

1415
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:08,512
to make this place possible.

1416
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:11,360
Your friends

1417
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:13,950
and your family.

1418
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:19,240
So here's to the ones
who couldn't be here.

1419
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:21,753
Here's to the friends we lost.

1420
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:27,673
This place is for you.
It's for all of us.

1421
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:30,360
But this,

1422
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:33,073
this is for them.

1423
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:37,837
So, in your own time,
in your own way,

1424
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,159
come make your peace.

1425
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:45,557
And welcome to the safe haven.

1426
02:12:45,720 --> 02:12:47,677
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1427
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:05,270
You all want some food?

1428
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,831
This is gonna be
a good home for us.

1429
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:16,830
Yeah.

1430
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:32,990
You had this on you
while you were passed out.

1431
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,276
Figured I'd keep it
safe for ya.

1432
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,952
Thanks, Minho.

1433
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,633
See you out there.

1434
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:51,473
See ya.

1435
02:14:46,160 --> 02:14:47,799
<i>Dear Thomas...</i>

1436
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,880
<i>This is the first letter
I can remember writing.</i>

1437
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,072
<i>Obviously, I don't know if I
wrote any before the maze.</i>

1438
02:14:55,720 --> 02:15:00,192
<i>But even if it's not my first,
it's likely to be my last.</i>

1439
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,549
<i>I want you to know
that I'm not scared.</i>

1440
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:06,279
<i>Well, not of dying, anyway.</i>

1441
02:15:06,480 --> 02:15:08,711
<i>It's more forgetting.</i>

1442
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,198
<i>It's losing myself
to this virus.</i>

1443
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:13,112
<i>That's what scares me.</i>

1444
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,430
<i>So every night I've been
saying their names out loud.</i>

1445
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:20,710
<i>Alby...</i>

1446
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:23,077
<i>Winston, Chuck.</i>

1447
02:15:24,760 --> 02:15:26,479
<i>And I just repeat them
over and over,</i>

1448
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:28,319
<i>like a prayer,</i>

1449
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:31,032
<i>and it all comes
flooding back.</i>

1450
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:35,749
<i>Just the little things,
like the way</i>

1451
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:36,830
<i>the sun used to
hit the Glade</i>

1452
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,952
<i>at that perfect moment
right before</i>

1453
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,633
<i>it slipped beneath the walls.</i>

1454
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:44,632
<i>And I remember the taste
of Frypan's stew.</i>

1455
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,317
<i>I never thought
I'd miss that stuff so much.</i>

1456
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,359
<i>And I remember you.</i>

1457
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:54,917
<i>I remember the first time you
came up in the Box.</i>

1458
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:56,440
<i>Just a scared little Greenie</i>

1459
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:58,432
<i>who couldn't even remember
his own name.</i>

1460
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,439
<i>But from that moment
you ran into the maze,</i>

1461
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:03,830
<i>I knew I would
follow you anywhere.</i>

1462
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,000
<i>And I have.</i>

1463
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:10,752
<i>We all have.</i>

1464
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:16,556
<i>If I could do it
all over again, I would</i>

1465
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:21,192
<i>and I wouldn't
change a thing.</i>

1466
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:24,798
<i>And my hope for you</i>

1467
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:26,758
<i>is that when you're looking
back years from now,</i>

1468
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:28,957
<i>you'll be able
to say the same.</i>

1469
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,356
<i>The future's
in your hands now, Tommy.</i>

1470
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:38,035
<i>And I know you'll find a way
to do what's right.</i>

1471
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:41,040
<i>You always have.</i>

1472
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:44,878
<i>Take care of everyone for me.</i>

1473
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:48,319
<i>And take care of yourself.</i>

1474
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,471
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

1475
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,957
<i>Thank you for being my friend.</i>

1476
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:02,673
<i>Goodbye, mate.</i>

1477
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,036
<i>Newt.</i>
