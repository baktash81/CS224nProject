00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,450
Allora, come stai, Leone?

3
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,160
Bene.

4
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,790
OK, OK. Let's talk business.

5
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,420
This fat bastard is trying to move
in on Maurizio's business.

6
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,260
Now you know
Maurizio is a reasonable guy.

7
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,930
He just wants
a little conversation.

8
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,850
But this guy
he don't wanna hear about it.

9
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,560
Maybe he'll listen to you.

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,980
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

11
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,980
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

12
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,750
Nice to see you again, Mr. Jones.

13
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,230
Remember, neatness counts.
You have got one haIf hour.

14
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,780
Aah... one hour.

15
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,170
Yeah, what?

16
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,250
This' Tonto downstairs.

17
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,050
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

18
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,300
What's he look like?

19
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,430
Serious.

20
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,600
Tell him I'm coming up.

21
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,350
He's coming up.

22
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,610
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

23
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,490
Mickey,

24
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,950
open your eyes, we got company.

25
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,120
We got company!

26
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,090
Come on.

27
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,520
Stop! Stop men!

28
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,030
Tonto...

29
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,370
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back and hurry up!

30
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,670
Hey sweetie, what's going on?

31
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,540
Don't worry, baby. It's cool.
Take a nap.

32
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,980
Oh my God!

33
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,860
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

34
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,030
Check the terrace!

35
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,610
911 emergency.

36
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,190
I need help!
Somebody's trying to kill me!

37
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,070
All right, just stay on the line.
I'll just be off for a moment.

38
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,450
Sir, I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.

39
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,740
OK.

40
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,720
Detective Jefferson,
may I help you?

41
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,050
I'll call you back.

42
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,430
Hey, relax man.

43
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,310
I've got half of Bolivia sitting
in those suitcases over there...

44
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,860
Hasn't even been cut yet!
Go ahead, take it, it's yours!

45
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,610
Dial this number.

46
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,840
I'll talk to you later sweetie, OK?

47
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,340
Bye...

48
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,140
Hello.

49
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,560
It's Maurizio. Remember me?
I see you're back in town.

50
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,730
Yeah... No. I mean, no!
just for today...

51
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,280
So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town

52
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,110
and we'll never see your
fat fucking face again?

53
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,780
Yeah, right.

54
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,410
Let me speak to our mutual friend.

55
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,580
He wants to talk to you.

56
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

57
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,920
Make sure he understands,
then let him go.

58
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,520
Do you understand?

59
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,520
So say it.

60
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,190
I understand.

61
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,520
Good.

62
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,260
Jesus.

63
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,980
Hola, que tal, amigo!
Two milks as usual?

64
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,460
Hi.

65
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,640
Why did you hide the cigarette?

66
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,020
This building's full of rats.
I don't want my old man to find out.

67
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Got enough problems...

68
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,240
What happened?

69
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,570
I fell off my bike.

70
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,460
Hey.

71
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,920
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, OK?

72
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,660
I mean, what's my job?
I'm just a holder.

73
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,160
I hold the stuff
just like you give it to me.

74
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,830
I don't look at it. I don't touch it,
I don't even know how to cut it.

75
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,080
Try and follow me, all right?

76
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,870
In June when we gave you the dope,
it tests a 100% pure.

77
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,420
Now it's July. We pick up the dope
and it tests 90% pure.

78
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,880
Now, somewhere between June and
July 10% turned to cut.

79
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,710
I don't know, that's none of my business,
I'm just a hoIder.

80
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,050
You give me the stuff,
I hold the stuff,

81
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,340
that's all I know!

82
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,010
Hey look, you know, I'm trying
to help you out here.

83
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,850
But, you know, if you're gonna
be a hard ass about it,

84
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,810
I gotta disturb him.

85
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,600
Now let me tell ya:

86
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,940
when he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

87
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,690
I'm telling you the truth!

88
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,570
I hope so. Because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie...

89
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,160
It's scary,
it's almost like a sixth sense.

90
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,530
Now, are you gonna

91
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,620
change your tune or
do I gotta bust into his?

92
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,880
I'm telling you the truth.

93
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,010
All right...

94
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,890
Stan,

95
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,350
Stan,

96
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,190
I'm, I'm sorry, you see,
he says he didn't cut the dope.

97
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,650
Oh.

98
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Of course, he didn't.

99
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,240
Just do me a favor.
Find out who did. For tomorrow.

100
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,500
Noon.

101
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,840
Malky, hey, wait!

102
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,810
Hey, I didn't cut your shit!
Find out yourself!

103
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,060
What the hell are you doing
out here?

104
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,440
Get inside and do your homework.

105
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,150
I did it already.

106
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,980
Oh yeah? Well, you can get inside
and help your sister

107
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,530
clean up the goddamn house!
And stop smoking cigarettes!

108
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,860
Time's up, my turn now.

109
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,900
Change the channel
and I'll smash your face!

110
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,880
Sorry, sweetheart.

111
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
Good morning, sleepy.

112
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,300
Hi, honey. Hey, you two.

113
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,310
Sweetheart, turn that down,
mom has got a headache.

114
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,890
She took my turn!

115
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,140
She just wants to watch
these goddamn cartoons!

116
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,940
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass a bit.

117
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,020
I'm not the one
with the fat ass around here!

118
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,940
Can someone who is doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons

119
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,860
move her little ass
and go get some food?

120
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,870
I dare you to say that again!

121
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,330
Margie, I think I screwed up.

122
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,710
It wouldn't be the first time,

123
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,670
I mean you always come up
with something, right?

124
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,010
Yeah, but I think I went
a little too far this time.

125
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,720
I think you're going
a little too far right now.

126
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,930
I'm gonna be late for work.

127
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,390
How about working at home today?

128
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,110
She's gonna hit me! Daddy.

129
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,400
Shit, shut the goddamn door!

130
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,950
Fucking bitch!

131
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,290
Hey,
can somebody answer the phone?

132
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,800
I'm busy!

133
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,840
Hello?

134
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,060
This is Margaret McAllister,

135
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,680
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

136
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,650
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

137
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,940
Yes, this is she.

138
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,650
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer,

139
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,950
he told us she had... problems.

140
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,660
Well, as you know,

141
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,080
we pride ourselves in turning
troubled girls into healthy,

142
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,330
productive young women.

143
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,830
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

144
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,080
Now, Mathilda left school

145
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,790
without permission
nearly two weeks ago.

146
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,750
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year.

147
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,510
But if you will refer
to page 20 in the rules

148
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,340
and regulations manual we sent you,

149
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,260
you wilI see that unless
there is a valid excuse

150
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,640
for prolonged absence,
your tuition will be forfeit.

151
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,980
She's dead.

152
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,120
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

153
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,250
Always like this.

154
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,170
Keep it.

155
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,600
Hey, I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

156
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,650
One quart of two? It's two, right?

157
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,590
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

158
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,130
It reminds me of Beethoven.

159
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,810
Can you hear it?

160
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,020
It's like, when you put
your head to the grass.

161
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,900
You can hear it growing.
You can hear the insects, bzzzz...

162
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,450
Do you like Beethoven?

163
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,530
Couldn't really say.

164
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,700
I'm gonna play you some.

165
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,670
Daddy!

166
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,260
Benny, stay here!

167
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,770
Daddy! Daddy!

168
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,160
Jesus! Fuck!

169
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,640
We said noon!

170
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,770
I've got one minute past.

171
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,610
You don't like Beethoven.

172
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,070
You don't know what you're missing.

173
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,030
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

174
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,240
So powerful!

175
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,170
But after his openings,
to be honest,

176
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,460
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring...

177
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
That's why I stopped!

178
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,100
Toss the apartment.

179
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,040
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him, too.

180
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,920
I lo-o-ove Mozart!

181
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,260
He was Austrian, you know.

182
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,550
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

183
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,600
So I tend to go for
the heavier guys.

184
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,430
Cool.

185
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,480
What the fuck are you doing, huh?

186
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,150
Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.

187
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,440
Check out Brahms, he's good too.

188
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,280
What the fuck do you know
about music?

189
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,240
Yeah, knock it off!

190
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,500
Checked the mattress?

191
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,840
Nope.

192
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,650
Fuck!

193
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,030
Stan!

194
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,910
Look what you did!

195
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,580
Stan, are you all right?

196
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,500
LOOK WHAT YOU DID!

197
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,640
Hey, Stan. Stan!
What're you doing?

198
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,640
What're you doing, he's dead!

199
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,690
But he ruined my suit.

200
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,820
I know. I know, but he's dead.

201
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,110
He's a piece of meat, forget about it.
Calm down.

202
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,030
I'm calm.

203
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,910
Stay there, OK?

204
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,120
Benny!

205
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,870
Benny!

206
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,080
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

207
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,960
It's Malky and Stan!

208
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,590
Take it easy, all right?
Come on, come on.

209
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,260
Benny!

210
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,930
Come on.
Let's get a cigarette, all right?

211
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,020
Benny, we're coming out!

212
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,690
Benny, don't fire!

213
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,650
Get in!
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

214
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,820
You wear something new and...

215
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,990
Take it easy!

216
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,080
What's happening out there?

217
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,370
It's all right, Ma'am,
go in. DEA. Police.

218
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,210
Why don't you leave that
poor family alone?

219
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,620
Everything's all right.
Just calm down.

220
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,540
I'm calm. I'm calm.

221
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,380
Why don't you leave 'em alone?

222
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,130
He said: Go back inside!

223
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,890
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside, all right?

224
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,660
Benny, turn that kitchen
upside down, find that shit!

225
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,000
Willy Blood, look what you did!

226
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,130
You killed the four year old kid!
Did you really have to do that?

227
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,770
Please, open the door.

228
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,280
Please.

229
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,580
Please.

230
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,370
Benny, there's three kids here.
I think Stan killed this girl,

231
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,210
and Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

232
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,760
The third one's missing. Find her.

233
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,600
Oh, shit. Hey,
we missed the little girl, man.

234
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,560
I'm gonna try and find the fucking
super of this goddamn building.

235
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,320
Yo, I found it!

236
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,110
Bingo!

237
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,740
Stan, we found it.

238
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,280
I know...

239
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,910
Here it is.

240
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,200
There's cops outside, we better go.

241
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,540
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

242
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,130
What do you want me to tell them?

243
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,140
Tell them

244
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,310
we were doing our job.

245
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,110
What's your name?

246
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,740
Mathilda.

247
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,370
Sorry about your father.

248
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,080
If somebody didn't do it
one day or another,

249
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,670
I would've probably done it myself.

250
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,670
Your mother, she...

251
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,630
She's not my mother.

252
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,430
And my sister, she wanted to
lose some weight, anyway.

253
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,560
But she never looked better.

254
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,680
Not even my real sister.

255
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,850
Just a half-sister,
and not a good haIf at that.

256
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,950
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

257
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,490
Because they killed my brother...

258
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,500
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

259
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,420
He never used to cry. Just used to
sit next to me and cuddle...

260
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,420
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamn pig ever was!

261
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,840
Hey, don't talk like that about pigs!

262
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,390
They're usually
much nicer than people.

263
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,560
But they smell like shit.

264
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,810
Not true!

265
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,310
As a matter of fact, right now
I have one in my kitchen

266
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,530
that's very clean and smells
very nice.

267
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,490
You don't have a pig
in your kitchen!

268
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,240
Yes, I do.

269
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,660
I was just in there
and I didn't see any goddamn pig!

270
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,290
Don't move, I'll get him.

271
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,290
Piggy? Piggy? Where are you?

272
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,460
Ah, there you are!

273
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,890
Hi Mathilda.

274
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,100
Hi Piggy.

275
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:58,530
How are you today?

276
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,200
I've seen better days.

277
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,620
What's your name?

278
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,290
Leon.

279
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,090
Cute name.

280
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,810
You have anyone you can go to?
Any family, any place else?

281
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,570
I'm gonna get some more milk.

282
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,510
Holy shit!

283
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,850
Don't touch that, please.

284
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,400
Leon?
What exactly do you do for a living?

285
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,440
Cleaner.

286
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,110
You mean you're a hitman?

287
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,150
Yeah.

288
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,950
Cool.

289
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,050
Do you clean anyone?

290
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,670
No women, no kids, that's the rules.

291
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,050
How much would it cost to hire
someone to get those dirtbags

292
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,100
who killed my brother?

293
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,970
Five grand a head.

294
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,400
Wow. How about this:

295
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,230
I work for you and in exchange
you teach me how to clean.

296
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,610
What do you think?

297
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,860
I'll clean your place,
I'll do the shopping,

298
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,200
I'll even wash your clothes.

299
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,080
Is it a deal?

300
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,120
No. It's not a deal.

301
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,590
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go!

302
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,510
You've had a rough day today.

303
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,850
go to sleep
and we'lI see tomorrow, OK?

304
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,080
You've been really great with me,
Leon.

305
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,500
And it's not always like that,

306
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,870
you know?

307
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,720
Good night.

308
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,590
Sleep well?

309
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,760
Good, because after breakfast
you gotta take off.

310
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,880
Where to?

311
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,640
Not my problem.

312
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,940
Read it!

313
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,370
You don't know how to read.

314
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,580
I'm learning, but I had
a lot of work lately, so

315
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,920
I'm a little behind.
What's it say?

316
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,800
"I've decided
what to do with my life"

317
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,880
"I wanna be a cleaner".

318
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,640
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here. Take it.

319
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,100
It's a goodbye gift. Go clean.

320
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,560
But not with me.
I work alone. Understand. Alone?

321
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,140
Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

322
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,860
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
And they were the best.

323
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,150
Mathilda,
why are you doing this to me?

324
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,610
I've been nothing but nice to you!

325
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,200
I even saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

326
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,120
Right, so now
you're responsible for it.

327
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,040
If you saved my life, you must have
saved it for a good reason.

328
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,920
If you threw me out now
it's like you never opened your door.

329
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,050
Like you let me die right there
in front of it.

330
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,130
But you did open it,

331
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,640
so...

332
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,060
Mathilda...

333
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,520
If you don't help me, I'll die
tonight. I can feel it.

334
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,400
But I don't want to die tonight.

335
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,400
Mathilda,
you're just a little girl, so,

336
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,280
don't take it badly, but...
I don't think you could do it.

337
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,860
I'm sorry.

338
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,260
How's that?

339
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,790
Mathilda,

340
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:13,550
don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

341
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,050
You got that?

342
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,170
OK.

343
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,970
I don't work like that. It's not
professional. There is rules!

344
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
OK.

345
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,430
And stop saying "OK"
all the time! OK?

346
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,850
OK.

347
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,810
Good.

348
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,160
Hi!

349
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,460
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

350
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,290
Mister. I have to use it because

351
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,300
I have an audition at Julliard
next month and I have to practice.

352
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,050
OK, but not after ten, hm?

353
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,760
OK, I promise.

354
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,400
I'm gonna put you
at the end of the hall

355
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,940
so that you don't disturb anyone.

356
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,400
Could you fill those out please?

357
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,530
Daddy,

358
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,160
can I please fill them out,

359
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,120
you know how I like to
check in to hotels!

360
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,710
Thanks, pap! I'll
bring these back in a minute.

361
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,380
Fourth floor.

362
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,090
Thanks mister!

363
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,920
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things!

364
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,720
I have a kid, seventeen,
does nothing all day long.

365
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,150
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

366
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,730
Of course.

367
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,920
I'm putting the name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

368
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,260
When things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

369
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,320
There, finished.

370
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,280
How old are you?

371
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,830
Eighteen.

372
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,120
Eighteen?

373
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,330
Wanna see my license?

374
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,330
No. You just look a little...
younger.

375
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,130
Thanks.

376
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,680
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

377
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,140
I wanna be strong like you,
smart like you.

378
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:13,850
Mathilda.

379
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,400
I know I'm not strong enough yet,

380
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:20,070
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

381
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,950
What do you think?
Just the theory.

382
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,530
I need this, Leon. I need time
to get my head together.

383
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah. And I need...

384
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,170
a drink.

385
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,340
Don't move! I'll go get you one.

386
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,350
Salute.

387
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,370
You know, when you told me
to get this baby out for you,

388
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,750
I thought my hearing's going.

389
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,790
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that, except beginners".

390
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,710
I like to stay in shape.

391
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,050
Sure.

392
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,630
Always stay on top. It's like me.

393
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,300
I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

394
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,350
That's why I don't leave this place
except to go from here to there.

395
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,600
Change ain't good, Leon. You know?

396
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,070
Yeah.

397
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,280
Check it.

398
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,290
Make sure it's the right thing.

399
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,370
I trust you.

400
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,830
One thing's got
nothing to do with the other.

401
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,790
Remember that, Leon.

402
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,590
I will.

403
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,940
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use,

404
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,440
because it lets you keep
your distance from the client.

405
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,030
The closer you get to being a pro,

406
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,740
the closer you can get to the client.

407
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,740
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

408
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,580
OK?

409
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,580
OK.

410
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,210
Position.

411
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,020
No.

412
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,820
Never take it off until the
last minute, it reflects light.

413
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:12,030
They can see you coming from
a mile away.

414
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,580
And always dress down,
never brighter than the floor. OK?

415
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,620
OK.

416
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,500
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

417
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,420
Who should I hit?

418
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,420
Whoever...

419
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,850
I'll be with you in a second,
all right, give me a few minutes.

420
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,560
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

421
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,520
You guys in the suits get lost.
I don't want to see you, all right?

422
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,860
It has to look natural.

423
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,370
No women, no kids, right?

424
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:58,790
Right.

425
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,550
The jogger in the yellow and orange?

426
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,800
OK.

427
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,630
Keep calm.

428
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,140
Don't take your eyes off him.

429
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,230
Breathe easy,

430
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,980
watch his movement.

431
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,570
Pretend you're running with him.

432
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,780
Try to feel his next movement.

433
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:42,950
Take a deep breath, hold it...

434
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,720
Now.

435
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,340
I'm all right. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

436
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,850
Get down.

437
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,720
One shot! Not bad, huh?

438
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,940
Can we try with real bullets now?

439
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,780
Not today... Let's pack up.

440
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,240
Here, continue like that.
Here, after...

441
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,790
No thanks.

442
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,500
No discussion.

443
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,960
It seemed... to Socrates...

444
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,380
To So-cra-tes...

445
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,350
I'll do it.

446
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,740
Leon, all we do is work.

447
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,870
We need a break. Let's play a game.

448
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,200
What kind of game?

449
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,160
I have this great game.

450
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,370
It makes you think
and it helps your memory.

451
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,620
It's exactly what you need.

452
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,170
OK.

453
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:58,610
OK. Who is it?

454
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,320
I don't know.

455
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,840
I don't know.

456
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,930
Mustache...

457
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,230
No.

458
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,780
Gene Kelly?

459
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:49,240
Good.

460
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,410
Your turn now.

461
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,380
OK, pilgrim...

462
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,840
Clint Eastwood?

463
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,310
I don't know, I give up.

464
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,940
John Wayne.

465
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,060
I was just about to say that.

466
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,230
I swear. It's amazing,
Leon, really, brilliant.

467
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,700
Amazing.

468
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,250
You love your plant, don't you?

469
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,220
It's my best friend.

470
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,680
Always happy. No questions.

471
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,100
And it's like me,
you see? No roots.

472
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,350
If you really love it,
you should plant it

473
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,730
in the middle of a park
so that it can have roots...

474
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:08,320
I'm the one you should be
watering if you want me to grow.

475
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,490
You're right.

476
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:17,960
No.

477
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,500
Yes.

478
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:18,830
No.

479
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,460
Yes.

480
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,750
Yes!

481
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,310
They gotta be jumping out of
the plate, they gotta be alive.

482
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,660
It's been a longtime, Leon.

483
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,330
I missed you

484
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,590
and you missed some nice jobs, too.

485
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,300
I been training.

486
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,220
Training's good.
But don't overdo it, huh?

487
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,510
You know training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

488
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,850
Tony,

489
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,690
all the money I make...
that you keep for me.

490
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,150
You need some money?

491
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,730
No. Just curious.

492
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,730
Because
I've been working a longtime

493
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:30,610
and haven't done anything
with my money,

494
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,370
I thought maybe some day
I could...

495
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,660
use it.

496
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,670
You met a woman?

497
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,300
Leon,
you gotta be careful with women.

498
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:58,390
Remember when you arrived in this
country, Leon? When I took you in,

499
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,180
you were still wet behind
the fucking ears,

500
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,270
and already you were in deep shit
because of a woman...

501
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,940
Don't forget that, Leon.

502
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,110
Wish I could, sometimes.

503
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,910
You know, about my money.

504
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,370
Maybe I,
maybe I could give... little...

505
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,830
to someone.

506
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,630
You know, to help out.

507
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,050
Hey, it's your money, I mean,
I'm just holding it for you,

508
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,470
you know. Like a bank. Except that, you
know, better than a bank because,

509
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:38,680
you know, banks are always
knocked off.

510
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,060
And no one knocks off old Tony.

511
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,100
And besides, in a bank

512
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,060
there's always tons of forms
to be filled and all that shit.

513
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,320
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write -

514
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,320
it's all in his head.

515
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,490
I know how to read now.

516
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,740
That's good, Leon, good.

517
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,170
Your money is here
whenever you want it,

518
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,090
you just ask me, OK?
Here's a grand.

519
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:09,590
No, it's OK. I don't need it.

520
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:13,420
No. Come on, come on, take it.
Have some fun. Go ahead. Take it.

521
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,800
Thank you.

522
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,470
All right,

523
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,020
now let's talk business.
Don't move, I'll go get the file.

524
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,810
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here!

525
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,380
Listen Mathilda, you gotta be careful.

526
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:56,510
You can't just speak to any guy
off the street.

527
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,180
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

528
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,310
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

529
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,810
I want you to stop cursing.

530
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,350
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

531
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,320
I want you to make
an effort to talk nice.

532
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,240
OK.

533
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,490
And I want you to stop smoking.

534
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,660
OK.

535
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,830
Stay away from him,
he looks like a weirdo.

536
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,460
OK.

537
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,300
I'll be out in five minutes,
stand where I can see you.

538
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,140
OK.

539
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,360
Leon, I think I'm kind of
falling in love with you.

540
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,070
It's the first time for me,
you know?

541
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:06,120
How do you know it's love if
you've never been in love before?

542
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,950
Cause I feel it.

543
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,830
Where?

544
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,630
In my stomach...

545
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,260
It's all warm.

546
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,390
I always had a knot there...
and now it's gone.

547
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:33,810
Mathilda, I'm glad you don't have
a stomach ache anymore,

548
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:38,230
I don't think that means anything...

549
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,400
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work!

550
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,450
Hey, how's the practicing going?

551
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,570
How are we today, Miss?

552
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,820
I'm sick of practicing.

553
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,030
I understand.

554
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,410
But you're doing all right.

555
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,660
I haven't received any complaints
at all.

556
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,250
Well, I put a cloth over
the strings to lessen the noise.

557
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,120
Oh? Oh, that's very smart!

558
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,710
Not everyone loves music.

559
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:20,340
Yeah I know.

560
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,880
What exactly does your father do?

561
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,800
Well, he's a composer.

562
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,930
Ah! That's wonderful!

563
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,470
Except he's not really my father.

564
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,440
He's my lover.

565
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,450
I'm gonna go for a walk.

566
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,750
What're you doing Saturday?

567
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,630
What about dinner?

568
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,470
Hey, where you going?

569
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,090
Visiting friends at 6J.

570
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,590
OK right.

571
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:41,980
We know you're a busy man

572
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,940
and we'll try to make this
as short as possible.

573
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,070
Now if you just take us
step by step

574
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,110
through exactly what happened.

575
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,900
The guy was here,
he went for his gun.

576
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,160
Bang! We shot him.

577
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,040
Where exactly were the kids?

578
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,580
I don't know.

579
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,120
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

580
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,210
But in the statement
you said you were the first man in,

581
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,540
didn't you see any kids?

582
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,050
The door was broken,
what happened?

583
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,380
Did you follow the procedure?

584
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:14,220
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

585
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,100
Cooperation.

586
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,480
I haven't got time for this
Mickey Mouse bullshit.

587
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:27,570
You want cooperation?
Come up my office, will you? 4602.

588
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,450
Kids should be at school.

589
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,750
Hey.

590
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,290
Hey, come on, that's my ball!

591
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,880
Hey, give that back!
Come on, where you going?

592
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:53,340
Damn, where are you going, man?
That's my ball!

593
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,310
Follow the blue car!

594
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,560
And I suppose you mean to blast
the music and go through lights, eh?

595
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,310
No. Drive slowly.

596
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:10,570
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up, OK?

597
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,210
It's for you, a present.

598
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,510
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it!

599
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,850
How do you like it? Nice, eh?

600
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,650
Mr. McGuffin?

601
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,110
Can I have a word with you?

602
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,730
Here! This is for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

603
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,490
His name is Norman Stansfield
and he's in room 4602

604
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:03,280
in the DEA building,
26 Federal Plaza.

605
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,280
I'm not taking it.

606
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,790
Why not?

607
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:09,450
Too heavy.

608
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,540
Well, would you rent me your gear
for the day?

609
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:16,420
I never lend out my gear.
But you stilI have your gun. Use it.

610
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:22,340
Just do me a favor,
don't shoot out the window, OK?

611
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,720
Why are you so mean to me?

612
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:29,220
You're out there killing people
you don't give a shit about,

613
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:32,810
but you won't get the bastards
who killed my whole family.

614
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,230
Revenge is not good, Mathilda.
Believe, it's better to forget.

615
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:42,400
To forget? After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor,

616
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:46,410
you expect me to forget? I want to
kill those sons of bitches,

617
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,120
and I'll blow
their fucking heads off!

618
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:52,290
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

619
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,330
Your life is changed forever.

620
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:02,510
You'lI have to sleep with one eye
open for the rest of your life.

621
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:05,390
I don't give a shit about sleeping,
Leon!

622
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,300
I want love... or death.

623
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:12,980
That's it.

624
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:16,520
Love or death.

625
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,820
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

626
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:26,990
It's really great game, Leon.

627
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:30,160
It makes people nicer
and starts them thinking.

628
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,000
The kind of game you love.

629
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:52,430
If I win, you keep me with you.
For life.

630
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,150
And if you lose?

631
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,940
You'll go shopping alone.
Like before.

632
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,910
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

633
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,700
There's a round in the chamber,
I heard it.

634
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,200
So what?

635
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:17,080
What's it to you if I end up with
a bullet in the head, huh?

636
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,380
Nothing.

637
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,680
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

638
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:31,600
I really hope that down deep inside
there's no love in you.

639
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:37,560
Cause if there is, just a
little bit of love in you

640
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,190
I think that in a few minutes you're
gonna regret you never said anything.

641
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,960
I love you, Leon.

642
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,350
I win.

643
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,410
I took a hit, I need a hand now.

644
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,580
I know she's young but...
she learns fast.

645
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:45,170
Kids need to be shaped
into something right?

646
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,670
Yeah. I know I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

647
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:50,380
She's eighteen.

648
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,970
Oh, really?

649
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,310
How about something to drink, Tony?

650
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,640
Yeah, sure, Manolo.
A glass of milk for Leon!

651
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:05,610
Nice tattoo.

652
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,610
Manolo! Make that two!

653
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:34,590
What's that for?

654
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:36,850
Can't afford to catch cold.

655
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,390
First you find out
where the chain is.

656
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,850
You can't see it,
but you can feel it.

657
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,520
Here.
I ring and you start talking.

658
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,230
What do I say?

659
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,440
Whatever you want.

660
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:51,820
Yes?

661
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,610
Hi. It's Susan.

662
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,330
I'm sorry, you must have
the wrong door, little girl.

663
01:14:57,330 --> 01:14:59,450
I don't know any Susan.

664
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,420
Move back a little,
I can't see anything.

665
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,250
The light's out,
it's all dark out here.

666
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:14,260
Mister, I'm scared...

667
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,760
OK, OK.

668
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,310
What are you doing?

669
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,980
Open up.

670
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,820
If it leaves your mouth,
I pull the trigger, capiche?

671
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,950
Here is OK. Let it go.
I said let it go.

672
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,570
Move, move over.

673
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,410
Easy, easy.

674
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,710
Go ahead, your turn.

675
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,590
Help me, please help me.

676
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,100
Hello, sir. Sir...?

677
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:48,020
Sir, sir, it's not my dope.

678
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,190
A little left, please.

679
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,410
OK, now the security shot.

680
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:10,460
Oh, the second goes higher
on the chest.

681
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:12,840
Aim for the heart and lungs.

682
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,210
There, right there, you see?

683
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:19,340
The first shot takes him out of order
and the second finishes him off.

684
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,390
Never in the face.

685
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:24,760
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid,

686
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,310
cause you could take out anybody
and say you did the job.

687
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,310
Got it?

688
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,190
Got it. Never in the face.

689
01:17:31,190 --> 01:17:33,820
OK. Now you can put the tools away.

690
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:36,360
What the fuck is going on?

691
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,030
Hey, mister.

692
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:45,540
You see,
when you use the silencer a lot.

693
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,830
you have to put
a piece of cloth here,

694
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,830
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

695
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:53,290
A damp, black cloth is the best.

696
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,840
What are you doing?

697
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,180
We said no women, no kids.

698
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,890
Who do you think this is
gonna kill? Donkeys and monkeys?

699
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,320
Now. It's clean.

700
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,120
Let's get outta here.

701
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,480
I thought we don't have
the right to drink?

702
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,240
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first client.

703
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,040
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well done,

704
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,880
how about a kiss?
Like in the movies.

705
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,280
No.

706
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,000
Yes.

707
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,320
What are you doing?

708
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,040
I'm gonna kiss you.

709
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,560
Mathilda, stop please.

710
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,600
Come on, just a kiss.

711
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,240
Stop, everyone is watching us.
Basta, go sit down.

712
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,600
Enjoy.

713
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,680
You don't believe me, do you?

714
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,960
How's that?

715
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,240
When I say
I'm in love with you.

716
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,720
Mathilda, please, drop it.
Just change the subject, OK?

717
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,160
OK, OK, sorry.

718
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,120
So how old were you
when you made your first hit?

719
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,560
Nineteen.

720
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,880
Beat ya!

721
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,600
What are you doing?

722
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,880
Can't afford to catch cold.

723
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,160
There's no doorbell?

724
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,240
So, knock on the door.

725
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,000
Yes?

726
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,080
Hi. I'm looking for
Mr. Rubens' apartment,

727
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,880
but it's all dark out here
in the hall and I'm lost.

728
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,480
Just a second.

729
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,360
You want more?
Come on, show your fucking face!

730
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,920
Think you can get me
that easily.

731
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,960
When it tough like this, you know it's
gonna be ugly. Better make it quick,

732
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,320
or else you will be here all day
listening to his crap.

733
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,560
Asshole come on,
show me your fucking face, faggot!

734
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,840
Come on, "gum trick"!

735
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,280
Hey. What about the "ring trick"?
Do you know that one?

736
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:52,760
"Ring trick"? Come on asshole,

737
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,640
I'm waiting.
Show it to me, motherfucker.

738
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,320
That's the "ring trick".

739
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,360
Mario, go back to the barber shop,
we'll finish later.

740
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,600
Hey Leon, what's up?

741
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,440
All done, already?

742
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,840
No, no.

743
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,960
Nicer than people, eh?

744
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,680
I told you that.

745
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:50,800
You got a problem?

746
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,080
No.

747
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,320
Get the chair, sit down. Sit.

748
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,000
I was thinking...

749
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,440
If something happens to me
some day...

750
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,400
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

751
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,560
You're indestructible,
bullets slide off you,

752
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,520
you play with them.

753
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,920
Tony. I thought about my money.

754
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:30,440
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

755
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,120
Yeah.

756
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,960
Her name is... Mathilda.

757
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,280
If anything happens to me,

758
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,520
I... I'd like you to give her...

759
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,560
my money.

760
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,160
You can count on me, Leon.

761
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,640
Thank you, Tony.

762
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,960
Yeah.

763
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,200
I won't be long.

764
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,560
Did I do something wrong?

765
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,720
No, this one is too big.

766
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,680
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

767
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,280
Mathilda, since I met you,
everything's been different.

768
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,160
So, I just need some time alone.

769
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,400
And you need some time to grow up
a little.

770
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,640
I've finished growing up, Leon.
I just get oIder.

771
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,760
And for me, it's the opposite.
I'm old enough,

772
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,760
I need time to grow up.

773
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,360
Shit.

774
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,880
You're new, aren't you? Fifth floor right?
Well you can't sit here like that.

775
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,920
Really? Why not?

776
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,640
Nothing's free. Like a parking meter.
When you stop, you pay.

777
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,800
It's the law.

778
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,040
Only on TV...

779
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:45,880
What did you say?

780
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,040
Forget it,
how much is your meter?

781
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:50,120
Ten dollars... a month.

782
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,120
Got change?

783
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,880
Don't worry about it,
we'll do ten for twelve.

784
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,960
I'll pay enough for
the rest of the year, OK?

785
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,640
OK, a year.

786
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,520
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

787
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,120
Uh... no.

788
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,480
So go play somewhere else.

789
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,920
I need to think.

790
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,800
Stand up, don't you like your job?

791
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,960
Food.

792
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,480
Where are you going?

793
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,800
Special delivery. Room 4602.

794
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,880
Sign here.

795
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,120
Have a nice weekend, girls.

796
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,200
Special delivery, huh? Let me guess...

797
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,040
Chinese?

798
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:22,800
Thai, maybe?

799
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,320
I've got it. Italian food.

800
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,080
What's your name, angel?

801
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,960
Mathilda.

802
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,080
Mathilda.

803
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:17,800
Mathilda,

804
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,480
I want you to put
the sack on the floor.

805
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:29,600
Good.

806
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:33,800
And now I want you to tell me

807
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,600
everything you know about
Italian food.

808
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,880
And don't forget the name
of the chef who fixed for me!

809
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,960
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

810
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,040
So this is something personal,
is it?

811
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,520
What filthy piece of shit
did I do now?

812
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,800
You killed my brother.

813
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,560
I'm sorry.

814
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,480
And you wanna join him?

815
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,800
No.

816
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:30,400
It's always the same thing.

817
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:39,520
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death,

818
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,600
that you learn to appreciate life.

819
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,880
Do you like life, sweetheart?

820
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,720
Yes.

821
01:33:56,680 --> 01:33:58,280
That's good.

822
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,920
Because I take no pleasure

823
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,600
in taking life...

824
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,280
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

825
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,960
Stan!

826
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,480
Stan.

827
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,320
Shit, Stan. I've been looking all over
for you, man. I've checked upstairs, and...

828
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,080
What? I'm busy.

829
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,480
It's Malky, man. He's dead.

830
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,640
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinamen.

831
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,760
Yeah, but they got
nothing to do with it, man.

832
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,800
They told me, this guy
came from the outside.

833
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,360
He was a pro, he was fast.
He fucking came outta nowhere.

834
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,760
Boom. Shoots the Chinamen
dead in two seconds.

835
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,320
Easy man, I'm a cop.

836
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,520
Then turns around, says
something to Malky like...

837
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,440
No women, no kids.

838
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,520
I think it was something personal.

839
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,640
Death is... whimsical today.

840
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,160
Blood, you hear me?

841
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,040
Yeah man, I hear you Stan,
just chill out man.

842
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,200
Would you take her up
to my office?

843
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,440
All right, yeah.

844
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,480
Jesus fucking Christ!

845
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,600
"Leon, my love".

846
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,040
"I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother".

847
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,360
"Their boss is Norman Stansfield"

848
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,360
"and he is in the DEA building,
room 4602".

849
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,160
"I'm gonna do that myself.
If something goes wrong",

850
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:41,920
"I left you twenty grand on the table.
It's for a contract".

851
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,160
"Five grand a head, right?"

852
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,720
"I know I'll feel better
after I do this".

853
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,880
"I love you - Mathilda".

854
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,720
Wait for me. I won't be long.

855
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:01,560
Look, I can't park in front
like this, it's a federal building.

856
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,680
And she's gonna do the same
exact thing like I said.

857
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,360
Nine-milli,

858
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,280
bullets and another nine-milli.

859
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,760
What did you plan to do with
all these guns, huh?

860
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:24,240
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

861
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,760
Holy shit,
what've we got here? Lunch.

862
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,120
Careful Blood. Might be poisoned.

863
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,840
No man,
there's no anchovies on this.

864
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,360
Is that what you call
"I won't be long"?

865
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,320
I've been hangin' around here
for at least ten minutes!

866
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,360
I did my best. Avanti.

867
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,800
Do you like it?

868
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,440
Yes.

869
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,600
So say it.

870
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,120
I like it.

871
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,880
Not thirsty?

872
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,680
You know, a girl's first time is
very important.

873
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,840
It determines
the rest of her life sexually.

874
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:36,120
I read that once
in one of my sister's magazines.

875
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:40,040
My girlfriends told me that
they hated their first experience.

876
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,760
That's because
they don't love the guys.

877
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,600
They just did it to show off.

878
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,960
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

879
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,920
I wanna like it, the first time.

880
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,960
Mathilda, no.

881
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,040
Why not?

882
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,280
I just can't.

883
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,360
You love someone else?

884
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,040
No. I mean...

885
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:24,480
there was someone a long time ago.
Before I came to the States.

886
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,120
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

887
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:34,320
She was from
a very respectable family.

888
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,120
Mine was, you know,

889
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,960
not so respectable.

890
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,440
Her dad went nuts everytime
she'd take off to see me.

891
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:51,080
But she still snuck off to see you,
right?

892
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,240
Right.

893
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,080
You see,
nothing can stop love, Leon.

894
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,040
He killed her.
One shot to the head.

895
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:10,240
They kept him in jail for two days,
then they let him go free.

896
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,840
They said it was an accident.

897
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,280
So,

898
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,520
one night I waited for him

899
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,040
500 feet with a lens.

900
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,640
He also had an accident.
The same night I took a boat

901
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:40,560
and came here to meet up with
my father who was working for Tony.

902
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:44,600
I was nineteen.

903
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:51,440
Since then I've never left the city.
And...

904
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,440
I've never had another girlfriend.

905
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,360
You see, Mathilda.
I won't be a good lover.

906
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,640
OK.

907
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,320
Just do me one favor.

908
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,040
What?

909
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,720
I'm sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair.

910
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,920
We're gonna share the bed.

911
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,160
I don't think it's a good idea.

912
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,760
It's OK, put your legs upon the bed.
Yeah, its nice.

913
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,840
Put your head down. It's OK. Relax.

914
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,360
Good night, Leon.

915
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,960
Good night.

916
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,840
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.

917
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,560
I have a lot of respect for
your business, Tony.

918
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,080
When you've killed for us
in the past,

919
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:10,640
we've always been satisfied.
And that's exactly why today

920
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:15,360
is going to be very,
very hard for me.

921
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,760
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

922
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,400
My man was killed
right here on your turf

923
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,560
and the Chinks tell me that
the hitman was kind of the...

924
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,880
Italian type.

925
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:37,200
So we figured that Tony might
know something. Wait,

926
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,920
there's more.
You're gonna love this.

927
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,760
A few hours later,
a little twelve year old girl

928
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:51,280
comes into my office,
armed to the teeth

929
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,720
with the firm intention of
sending me straight to the morgue.

930
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:57,000
And you know who came and got
her in the middle of the afternoon,

931
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,560
right there, in my building?
The very same Italian hitman.

932
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,000
I'm dying to meet him.

933
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,960
Relax, everything's fine.

934
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,440
Sleep well?

935
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:23,560
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

936
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,280
Oh, I forgot.

937
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:30,520
You know, I never saw someone
with one eye open snore so much.

938
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,120
I snore?

939
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:33,760
Like a baby.

940
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,760
I'm gonna get some milk
for breakfast. I won't be long.

941
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,800
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

942
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,480
Two knocks, then one, and
two knocks again, right?

943
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:44,880
Right.

944
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,800
Hola senor. Ring these up
and I'll go get some milk.

945
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,520
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

946
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,160
You answer my questions
by nodding "yes"

947
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:34,920
or shaking your head "no",
you got it?

948
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,480
Is he alone?
Does he expect you?

949
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,920
Do you have keys to the apartment?

950
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:46,160
Is there a code, a way of knocking
so he knows it's you?

951
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:35,400
Alpha team,

952
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,960
final position, we're ready to go.

953
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,560
Be careful.

954
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,400
Move, move!

955
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,160
Shit.

956
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,360
Alpha team. Man down, man down.

957
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:42,800
I told you.

958
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,760
Benny,

959
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,040
bring me everyone.

960
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,040
What do you mean, "everyone"?

961
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,560
EVERYONE!

962
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,840
Take this.

963
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,840
Go take a look.

964
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:13,080
Don't move.

965
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,400
You see anything?

966
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,760
It's the guy.

967
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,520
He's here.
He's got a gun on my head.

968
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,360
OK, nobody moves.

969
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,160
Let the girl go.

970
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:29,000
Now, take it easy, man!

971
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,720
Let the girl go!

972
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,920
OK. The girl's coming out.

973
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,960
Let the girl go.

974
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,800
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there, go.

975
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,600
You're coming with us.

976
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:07,240
Christ, he shot him!

977
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,720
Bastard!

978
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,560
Move! Move! Move! Move!

979
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,400
Shut the fucking water off!

980
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:29,560
Got it.

981
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:31,720
We're in a bad way here,

982
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:34,560
send the Cats,
I repeat, send the Cats!

983
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:48,000
I don't know what happened,
I didn't see them coming, I swear.

984
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:51,040
I just went shopping

985
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,400
and I came back
and they were everywhere.

986
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,240
Stay away from the window.

987
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,840
Leon?

988
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,120
Leon...

989
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,320
Come here.

990
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:49,680
Snipers.

991
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:55,240
OK, now get this fucking asshole
outta there.

992
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,040
How we gonna get outta here now?

993
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:18,040
Leave it to me,
we're checking out.

994
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,920
But Leon,
it's not big enough for you.

995
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,280
It's barely big enough for me.

996
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,600
We said no discussion.

997
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:25,360
No! I'm not letting...
I'm not going!

998
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,560
I won't go! I won't go!

999
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,160
Listen to me... Listen to me,

1000
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,880
we have no chance together,
but if I'm alone I can do it,

1001
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:36,240
trust me.
I'm in good shape, Mathilda.

1002
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,040
And I know I've got a lot of
money with Tony, a lot.

1003
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:42,680
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us, OK? Go.

1004
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:45,440
No! You just say that
so I won't worry.

1005
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,360
I don't wanna lose you, Leon.

1006
01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:54,120
You're not going to lose me,
Mathilda.

1007
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,040
You've given me a taste for life.

1008
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:59,160
I want to be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

1009
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,320
You'll never be alone again,
Mathilda.

1010
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,240
Please, go now, baby, go!

1011
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,320
Calm down, go now. Go, go.

1012
01:55:15,240 --> 01:55:18,080
I'lI see you at Tony's.
I'm gonna clean them all.

1013
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,960
Tony's in an hour.

1014
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,520
I love you, Mathilda.

1015
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,560
I love you too, Leon.

1016
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,080
Hey, heyeyey, what the fuck is going on
up there?

1017
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:10,800
I just said take the guy out,
not the whole fucking building.

1018
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,680
Hey, we got one breathing here.

1019
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:36,480
Get the medic over here...

1020
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,280
We got a wounded man here.
Make way!

1021
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,560
Send him down by the stairs!

1022
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,640
Let him go! Let's go! Move!

1023
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,880
Get that guy up the stairs.
Lean him on the land.

1024
01:56:55,880 --> 01:56:58,160
Get your team back up there.

1025
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,800
We got two men
coming down the stairs.

1026
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:26,720
You OK?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

1027
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:29,840
Move your fucking asses.

1028
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,320
Squad number one what's the status
on the apartment?

1029
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:33,640
Can't see shit,
too much smoke in here,

1030
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:35,160
give us five minutes
to clear it up.

1031
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:36,240
OK, you got it.

1032
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:37,960
What, what, what!
You're two hundred men

1033
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:41,720
and you can't find one man and
a girl? Did you find the girl?

1034
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,360
Hi, how're you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

1035
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:59,720
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right, this one here.

1036
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,640
You from the third precinct?

1037
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,040
Yeah.

1038
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,840
All right, fine. Put it down,
put it down. This one.

1039
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:34,680
You stay there for two minutes,
I'll be right back.

1040
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:38,160
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

1041
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,120
OK, you're right. Sit tight.

1042
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,360
OK, come on, everybody out.

1043
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:53,280
Come on, let's go, let's go!
Come on, out!

1044
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:20,320
Clear the way. Clear the way,
men.

1045
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:33,600
Come on, what are you doing here.
Get out, get out. Come on.

1046
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:25,640
Stansfield?

1047
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,320
At your service.

1048
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,840
This is... from...

1049
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,240
Mathilda.

1050
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,320
Shit.

1051
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:36,200
Leon asked me to help you out if...
if something happened

1052
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,080
and...
I think something happened, right?

1053
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:42,840
He put aside a little cash
for you...

1054
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:45,520
So, what I'm suggesting is that...

1055
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:48,720
seeing as how you're still so young,

1056
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:51,800
I should hold the money for you,
you know, 'till you're oIder.

1057
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:54,600
Like a bank, you know,
except better than a bank

1058
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:57,840
Because, you know,
banks always get knocked off.

1059
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,320
No one knocks off old Tony.

1060
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:03,200
But it's your money and,
in the meantime,

1061
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:07,000
all you gotta do is come here
every once in a while

1062
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:11,280
and I'll dish it out
so that you can have a little fun, OK?

1063
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:15,840
Here's a hundred bucks to start with.

1064
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,800
Can't take any job instead?

1065
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,160
A job?

1066
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:24,800
What the hell can you do?

1067
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,480
I can clean.

1068
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:30,160
I ain't got no work
for a twelve year old kid.

1069
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:32,720
So get it outta your goddamn head!

1070
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:36,280
It's over, the game's over,
Leon's dead! You hear me?

1071
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:50,400
Come on. Come on,
you think I ain't hurting, too?

1072
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:01,120
But he's dead. And you're gonna
forget all this craziness

1073
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:05,360
and get your little ass
back to school, capiche?

1074
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:08,360
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here,

1075
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,520
and don't let me see your face
'till next month.

1076
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:14,480
'Cause something tells me I'm about
to lose my famous kind streak.

1077
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:09,640
My parents died in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1078
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,600
It was terrible.

1079
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,800
You know, we didn't have the time
to get to know one another

1080
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:26,960
when you first came here,
but I want you to know

1081
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,600
that I am not the kind of woman
who'd let down a child,

1082
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:32,680
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1083
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,800
So, I'm going to help you and do
my best to welcome you here again.

1084
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,720
But on one condition. You have to
stop lying to me, Mathilda.

1085
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,880
I want you to take a chance
and trust me.

1086
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:53,440
Now tell me what happened to you.

1087
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:57,680
OK. My family got shot down
by DEA officers

1088
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:02,640
because of a drug problem.

1089
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:06,520
I left with the greatest guy
on earth.

1090
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:10,200
He was a hitman, the best in town.
But he died this morning

1091
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:14,640
and if you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1092
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:36,280
You know her?

1093
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:37,520
No.

1094
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,480
I've never seen her.

1095
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,320
I think we'll be OK here, Leon.

1096
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:12,960
"He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect"

1097
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,320
"He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect"

1098
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:35,840
"He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance"

1099
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,720
"The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance"

1100
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:57,760
"I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier"

1101
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:03,120
"I know that the clubs
are weapons of war"

1102
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:09,000
"I know that diamonds
mean money for this art"

1103
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:13,600
"But that's not
the shape of my heart"

1104
02:08:17,680 --> 02:08:21,600
"He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades"

1105
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:32,480
"He may conceal a king in his hand
While the memory of it fades"

1106
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:43,520
"I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier"

1107
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:48,760
"I know that the clubs
are weapons of war"

1108
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:54,720
"I know that diamonds
mean money for this art"

1109
02:08:56,680 --> 02:08:59,320
"That's not
the shape of my heart"

1110
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,080
"That's not
the shape of my heart".

1111
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:41,880
"And if I told you
that I loved you"

1112
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,840
"You'd maybe think
there's something wrong"

1113
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:53,800
"I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one"

1114
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:06,080
"Those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost"

1115
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:16,440
"Like those who curse their luck
in too many places"

1116
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,600
"And those who fear are lost"

1117
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:27,840
"I know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier"

1118
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:33,200
"I know that the clubs
are weapons of war"

1119
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:39,040
"I know that diamonds
mean money for this art"

1120
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,760
"But that's not
the shape of my heart"

1121
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:49,560
"But that's not
the shape of my heart"

1122
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:55,160
"That's not
the shape of my heart"
