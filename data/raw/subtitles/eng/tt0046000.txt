1
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:28,410
Thank you, madame.

2
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,196
Good morning, monsieur.

3
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:33,391
- Some nice fresh...

4
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,978
- There it is.
- I need some onions.

5
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,673
- Delivered this morning.
Pick them out yourself.

6
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:38,723
- How are the peaches?

7
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,940
- Eh, the peaches?
Wonderful.

8
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,691
I ate one this morning,
and I never tasted...

9
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,148
- Uh, can I help you?
- Merci.

10
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:45,819
- Please, monsieur,

11
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:47,824
be careful with the peaches.
- Yes.

12
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:50,147
There are some
wonderful plums, monsieur.

13
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:53,319
If you can't use the plums, then...
- Uh..huh.

14
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:56,953
- One kilo is enough.

15
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:59,854
- A kilo and a half, monsieur.
Put it on the scale yourself.

16
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:00,790
- One kilo.

17
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,319
- Monsieur, string beans?

18
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,776
And there's some lovely carrots
fresh this morning.

19
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,862
- We need some butter.
There's a dairy down there.

20
00:02:06,897 --> 00:02:08,208
- Monsieur, my money, please.

21
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:09,445
Pay for it.

22
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,423
Uh, excuse me.

23
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,451
I'm looking for the shop
of Mr. Godet, the baker.

24
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:16,566
We just arrived in town.
Ask the woman.

25
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,141
- Fresh this morning.
Taste one.

26
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,465
Excuse me, please.
Number 26.

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,603
There, 3 doors down.

28
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:23,706
- They are sour.

29
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:26,701
- Uh, monsieur, because you're
a nice gentleman...

30
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:32,536
- here, monsieur... especially because you
are a nice gentleman...

31
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,429
Oh. Please, monsieur.

32
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,094
I'm looking for Mr. Godet, the baker.

33
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,258
Dead.
Died a month ago.

34
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:33,235
Oh.

35
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:35,490
What a pity.

36
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,472
You know him?

37
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,809
No, my father knew him.

38
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,657
Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:41,117
And Mr. Godet's wife?

40
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:44,506
Oh, she took the children
and moved to Marseilles
to her brother.

41
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,860
Tell your father
that the brother's name
is Pastin in Marseilles.

42
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,760
My...my father's dead.

43
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:53,394
Oh.

44
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:58,696
You see, my father told me
that his old friend, Mr. Godet

45
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:00,086
would someday help me,

46
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,591
So when my father was dead
and there was nobody there,

47
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,438
I wrote him a letter,
to Mr. Godet.

48
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:08,091
And I packed my things and left.

49
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:11,343
And I thought Mr. Godet would
be expecting me.

50
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:12,801
Oh.

51
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:14,949
I see.

52
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:18,129
You, uh...have no family?

53
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:21,889
Where will you go?

54
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:24,844
You have any money?

55
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,035
Well, I thought Mr. Godet
would let me work for him

56
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,276
in his bakery, perhaps.

57
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,146
I'm very strong, you know?

58
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,359
I'm a hard worker.

59
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:38,192
I can work very hard
without getting a bit tired.

60
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:38,997
Hmm.

61
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:41,774
Come in.

62
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:44,261
Come in. Come in.
Come in.

63
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:47,461
Have you eaten?

64
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:50,029
Not...not today,

65
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:51,248
Hmm.

66
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:52,825
Perhaps a little bread?

67
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,062
Oh.

68
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:56,455
Come on.

69
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,354
A little cheese, maybe, huh?

70
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,259
Thank you.

71
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:01,852
And, uh...a little wine.

72
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:02,694
Oh, thank you.

73
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:03,467
Thank you.

74
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,736
In here. In here.

75
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,971
That's it. Ha ha.

76
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:09,549
Now, perhaps you
will work for me, eh?

77
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:12,338
Of course, you understand
I can't pay you while you learn,

78
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:16,842
but you'll have a nice bed to sleep in
and a stove to cook a little supper,

79
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:23,731
and in the morning, you will open the shop
and sell a few buttons and pins and, uh...

80
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,994
be my little helper, huh?

81
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:29,110
Huh?

82
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:33,294
Hmm. I'm going in here.

83
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,049
Paul, will you get me a bottle
of pinot in the wine shop?

84
00:05:37,673 --> 00:05:40,107
[  Shopkeeper  ]
I'm not going to hurt you.

85
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:40,957
[  Lili  ]  I want to go.

86
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:43,151
- Oh, no. Come here.
- Please, I want to go.

87
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,404
- Please.
- Oh, no, no, no.

88
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,219
- I am not going to hurt you.

89
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,999
- I'm telling you, I want to go.

90
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,333
- I want to go.

91
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,598
- No, wait.

92
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,454
- Don't be afraid.

93
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:53,942
Oh. Yes, monsieur?

94
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:55,254
May I be of service, monsieur?

95
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,496
A little trouble with my helper.

96
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,762
Very difficult to find good help
these days.

97
00:05:58,797 --> 00:06:00,830
- They're lazy and stupid.
- And uncooperative.

98
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:02,560
- How much?
- 90 please, monsieur.

99
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,825
70.
I want half a dozen.

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,716
85.
What are you
standing there for?

101
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:06,326
You can get out.

102
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,406
I take her off the streets,

103
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:10,290
a girl with no references,
no family, no money,

104
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:11,522
and...colors, monsieur...

105
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:13,965
and I give her place to sleep
and food to eat

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,904
and a fine opportunity
to learn a trade.

107
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,781
And what happens?

108
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:17,624
Nothing, I hope.

109
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:18,483
75.

110
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,469
Uh, 80.

111
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,117
She breaks my pitcher
and eats my food.

112
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,348
- I didn't...

113
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,423
- I didn't eat anything.

114
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,756
- I was going to eat, but he...

115
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,755
You're through.
Good-bye.

116
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,553
What are you waiting for?

117
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,443
But my suitcase in there

118
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,298
and my hat and my purse.

119
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:36,156
Your face is dirty, little mouse.

120
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,897
There is nothing
to cry about.

121
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,775
You should be happy
to leave this place.

122
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,028
It smells.

123
00:06:43,638 --> 00:06:45,358
Does he owe you
any wages?

124
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:46,488
- Wages?
For what?

125
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,054
She should pay me
for the food she ate.

126
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:49,403
Ah?

127
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:53,419
My word of honor, monsieur,
I didn't eat a bite. Not a bite.

128
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,551
All right, all right, look...

129
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,847
Hup!
See?

130
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,424
It's right behind your ear.

131
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,753
No, this one.

132
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:01,926
See?

133
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,069
It's a trick?

134
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,438
Now, how did you know?

135
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:10,582
Everything is all right now,
hmm?

136
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:12,912
What's your name?

137
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:14,903
Marc.

138
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:16,253
Marcus.

139
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:18,842
Marcus the magnificent.

140
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:21,162
It suits you.

141
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:22,046
- Enough!

142
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:23,128
OUT!

143
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,226
Mademoiselle.

144
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:27,586
Thank you, monsieur.

145
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:28,890
Farewell, mademoiselle.

146
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,865
Be of good cheer.

147
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:32,561
You are young.

148
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,080
It's a fine day.

149
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,317
And tomorrow
will be another.

150
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,883
- Six handkerchiefs
at 80 francs.

151
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,209
75.

152
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,139
A good day to you, sir.

153
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,241
Where's Marc?

154
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:47,629
He went in there a minute.

155
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,400
Here's your wine.
Pay you tomorrow.

156
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:15,594
- What's that?

157
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:17,630
- She lost her job.

158
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,211
- No money, no family,
no place to go.

159
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:21,885
- She seems to be
going with you.

160
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,186
- Oh, no.

161
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:25,939
Where are you going?

162
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:27,314
- Uh, what, monsieur?

163
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:28,577
- Where do you live?

164
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:31,059
- Uh...uh...where do you live?

165
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:32,965
- Ha.
Where do we live?

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,732
- Everywhere.

167
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:35,258
Last week, Marseilles.

168
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:36,600
The week before, Avignon.

169
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,326
Next week, Aix-les-Bains.

170
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,753
- Huh.
You...you travel.

171
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,017
How pleasant.

172
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,971
- Who is she?
Where did you find her?

173
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:44,093
- She loves me.

174
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:45,982
- What's your name?

175
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:47,264
- Lilette Daurier.

176
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,742
But my father always
called me Lili.

177
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,635
- Let me give you
a word of advice, Lili.

178
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:53,657
Find someone else to love.

179
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,366
This Marc is dangerous.

180
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:58,648
He's got an assistant
with long, red fingernails.

181
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:00,749
Ha.
Such men are dangerous.

182
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,822
- Hey, listen,

injured in the war.

We'll have lunch in the tent.

because from now on,
there's gonna be competition.

you're talking about.

What the devil
is the matter with you?

You're in love with the girl,

with someone else.

knows how to make the man ask her.

That depends.

when you were mad about

1075
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,190
but you want to know
something, Marc?

1076
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,994
We sometimes outgrow
feelings and ideas,

1077
01:04:15,115 --> 01:04:18,312
just like a little girl
outgrows her dresses,

1078
01:04:19,154 --> 01:04:23,999
but somehow, it turns out that
there's a right time for everything...

1079
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:25,943
in the right order.

1080
01:04:26,735 --> 01:04:30,171
There's a time for going to school.

1081
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,338
A time for losing our parents,

1082
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:39,432
and a time for falling in love
with a beautiful magician.

1083
01:04:41,479 --> 01:04:43,487
But there's a time for waking up.

1084
01:04:46,618 --> 01:04:50,353
You are a wise girl...Lili.

1085
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,170
Where did you learn all this?

1086
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:54,223
We don't learn.

1087
01:04:54,886 --> 01:04:56,562
We just get older...

1088
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,292
and we know.

1089
01:05:01,653 --> 01:05:02,699
Good-bye, Marc.

1090
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:05,327
Good-bye.

1091
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:09,735
Thank you for your patience.

1092
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,688
Forgive me for having been
such a nuisance.

1093
01:05:24,563 --> 01:05:26,455
Oh, Rosalie,

1094
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,659
I'm...I'm leaving.

1095
01:05:28,694 --> 01:05:31,142
I just said good-bye
to your husband.

1096
01:05:31,424 --> 01:05:32,260
Good-bye.

1097
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:45,880
Lili?

1098
01:05:46,371 --> 01:05:48,613
Oh, Lili, please, wait a minute.

1099
01:05:49,096 --> 01:05:52,465
Are you gonna leave
without saying good-bye?

1100
01:05:53,056 --> 01:05:56,260
Please, Lili, just for a minute,
come here.

1101
01:05:57,095 --> 01:05:59,652
Please? Closer.

1102
01:06:00,969 --> 01:06:02,888
I have a favor to ask, and

1103
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:05,749
I don't want the others to hear.

1104
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:11,755
If you're leaving, Lili,
please take me with you.

1105
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:15,720
I wanna go with you,
wherever you go.

1106
01:06:16,123 --> 01:06:18,616
It won't be the same
here without you.

1107
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:22,713
You're my sweetheart, you see?

1108
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:25,260
It was love at first sight.

1109
01:06:26,106 --> 01:06:30,503
From the first moment I saw you
walking by, wearing that... awful hat,

1110
01:06:31,257 --> 01:06:33,623
and carrying that lopsided suitcase.

1111
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:37,545
- Please...oh, please don't
leave us, Lili!

1112
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:41,146
I never had a real friend
until you came along.

1113
01:06:41,396 --> 01:06:42,986
Please take me with you.

1114
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,605
If you really loved us,
you wouldn't go away.

1115
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,510
Oh, but I do.

1116
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:47,754
It's just that I...

1117
01:06:47,953 --> 01:06:48,941
I'll say it.

1118
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:50,566
You hate the boss.

1119
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:52,197
He's unreasonable.

1120
01:06:52,232 --> 01:06:53,290
He's mean.

1121
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:54,348
He's jealous.

1122
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:56,108
We'll protect you from him.

1123
01:06:56,123 --> 01:06:57,165
Oh, you always have.

1124
01:06:57,787 --> 01:06:59,871
You've always been
so kind and good...

1125
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:04,171
- and you seem to know
what's in my heart or

1126
01:07:04,206 --> 01:07:07,483
- what I'm thinking
and what I'm feeling.

1127
01:07:11,522 --> 01:07:12,297
I'll kill him!

1128
01:07:12,481 --> 01:07:16,180
I'm gonna kill the boss! Grrr!

1129
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:20,149
Well, anyway, I'll give him
a good talking to.

1130
01:07:20,398 --> 01:07:21,658
Hey, boss...

1131
01:07:21,858 --> 01:07:22,768
- Lili?

1132
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:24,538
Here.

1133
01:07:24,776 --> 01:07:26,785
It's our going-away present.

1134
01:07:27,022 --> 01:07:30,570
Oh, Reynardo...how very nice.

1135
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:32,259
It was very expensive.

1136
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:35,138
He probably stole it.
You know Reynardo.

1137
01:07:35,433 --> 01:07:37,138
How did you get it, Reynardo?

1138
01:07:37,173 --> 01:07:38,907
Well, must I tell?

1139
01:07:39,945 --> 01:07:42,631
Reynardo, you promised me
you would never steal again.

1140
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:44,588
I didn't steal it.

1141
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:48,340
If you must know, I'm paying for it
on the installment plan.

1142
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,170
What happens if you don't
keep up with the payments?

1143
01:07:50,388 --> 01:07:52,578
I know him.
He'll never keep up.

1144
01:07:52,657 --> 01:07:53,993
They'll come and
take it away from you.

1145
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,537
No, they won't.
I made a deal.

1146
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,944
What sort of a deal?

1147
01:07:59,152 --> 01:08:01,968
Well, I agreed that if I didn't
keep up with the payments,

1148
01:08:02,003 --> 01:08:04,007
I'd give the man something
else in exchange.

1149
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,601
I signed a paper.

1150
01:08:05,636 --> 01:08:07,517
Uh-oh.
He signed a paper.

1151
01:08:07,552 --> 01:08:09,589
What does the man
get in exchange?

1152
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,506
Another fox fur.

1153
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:12,941
Another?

1154
01:08:12,976 --> 01:08:13,877
Uh-huh...

1155
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:16,283
me.

1156
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:18,894
Well, you poor darling.

1157
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,546
- You traded your life

1158
01:08:20,581 --> 01:08:22,471
- to get me a present.
- Mmm.

1159
01:08:23,326 --> 01:08:24,172
Oh, Reynardo, you...

1160
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:27,987
Trust him to take advantage
of a situation like this.

1161
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:30,161
I wanna go with you, Lili.

1162
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,102
Why don't you take
us all with you?

1163
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,783
We don't want you
to forget us, Lili.

1164
01:08:35,818 --> 01:08:37,466
I never could forget you.

1165
01:08:37,796 --> 01:08:39,824
You've become so
very dear to me.

1166
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:42,788
You're the only things I love.

1167
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,495
I know you love me, too.

1168
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,588
Why, you poor darlings,
you're trembling.

1169
01:09:02,234 --> 01:09:03,629
Well, are you staying or going?

1170
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:05,760
We've had an offer
from the Folies Paris,

1171
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,304
but we can't accept it
without you.

1172
01:09:08,608 --> 01:09:12,648
I've been an idiot,
a stupid fool.

1173
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:17,171
Melting and sniveling over
Reynardo and Carrot Top.

1174
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:20,322
I must be crazy.

1175
01:09:21,734 --> 01:09:24,765
They've become
so very dear to me,

1176
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:29,687
I forget...I forget every time
that it's only you.

1177
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:31,739
Or is it you?

1178
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:33,899
Is it?

1179
01:09:34,627 --> 01:09:35,574
Wh-what are you?

1180
01:09:35,574 --> 01:09:39,289
Are you just a monster
without any feeling?

1181
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:42,376
Why can't you ever say
a kind word?

1182
01:09:43,186 --> 01:09:45,005
Why do you hide
behind those puppets?

1183
01:09:45,005 --> 01:09:46,151
I am the puppets!

1184
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:52,340
I'm Carrot Top: Confident, clever,
capable of running his life and yours

1185
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,082
and everybody else's.

1186
01:09:53,082 --> 01:09:56,369
And I'm Golo the Giant:
Cowardly, stupid,

1187
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,799
longing to be loved, clumsy, 
and in need of comforting.

1188
01:10:00,549 --> 01:10:05,733
And I'm Marguerite, too:
Vain, jealous, obsessed with self,

1189
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:07,341
looking at my face in the mirror.

1190
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:09,951
Are my teeth nice?
Is my hair growing thin?

1191
01:10:10,698 --> 01:10:14,484
And I'm Reynardo 
the thief, the opportunist, 

1192
01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:15,996
full of compromise and lies.

1193
01:10:15,996 --> 01:10:18,017
Like any other man, I have in me 
all these things,

1194
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:20,193
all of these and
as many more again.

1195
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:22,797
Must I make a new puppet
for the small part of me

1196
01:10:22,797 --> 01:10:23,794
you've managed to see?

1197
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:24,948
The monster?

1198
01:10:24,948 --> 01:10:25,832
The angry man?

1199
01:10:26,558 --> 01:10:29,320
The frustrated dancer, clumping along
with a leg anchored to the ground,

1200
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,643
and a heart anchored to...

1201
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,518
but you don't have to understand me 
or even like me.

1202
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:42,639
This is business.

1203
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,078
Not anymore.
