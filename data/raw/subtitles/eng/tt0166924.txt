1
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:58,106
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

2
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,495
Get out of the car.

3
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,303
The boys found this on the floor,
in the back of the Caddy.

4
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,098
Yeah, they showed me.

5
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:04,477
Could be unrelated.

6
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,521
Could be.

7
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:10,275
Any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings?

8
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,277
No.

9
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:16,656
Could be someone's missing, maybe.

10
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,951
That's what I'm thinking.

11
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,158
Just one more bag after that.

12
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,765
I just wanted to come here.

13
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,311
To Winkie's?

14
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:53,563
This Winkie's.

15
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:58,318
Okay. Why this Winkie's?

16
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,157
It's kind of embarrassing.

17
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:08,870
Go ahead.

18
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:13,750
- I had a dream about this place.
- Oh, boy.

19
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,752
See what I mean?

20
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:21,507
Okay, so you had a dream
about this place.

21
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,886
Tell me.

22
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:29,933
Well...

23
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:35,688
it's the second one I've had.
But they're both the same.

24
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:41,361
They start out that I'm in here but...

25
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:44,155
it's not day or night...

26
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:47,033
it's kind of half-night, you know?

27
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:50,161
But it looks just like this.

28
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,413
Except for the light.

29
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:56,834
And I'm scared like I can't
tell you.

30
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,838
Of all people...

31
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,675
you're standing right over there.

32
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,722
By that counter.

33
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:15,061
You're in both dreams
and you're scared.

34
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,733
I get even more frightened when
I see how afraid you are, and...

35
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:27,323
then I realize what it is.

36
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:33,246
There's a man...

37
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:36,249
in back of this place.

38
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,920
He's the one who's doing it.

39
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,466
I can see him through the wall.

40
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:47,885
I can see his face.

41
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:58,730
I hope that I never see that face
ever outside of the dream.

42
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,992
That's it.

43
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:15,371
So... you came to see
if he's out there.

44
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,711
To get rid of this
god-awful feeling.

45
00:14:25,006 --> 00:14:26,758
Right then.

46
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,640
It's around the back.

47
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,921
Dan! Dan, are you all right?

48
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,965
What is it, Dan? Dan?

49
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:57,533
Hello?

50
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:02,622
The girl is still missing.

51
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,813
- Talk to me.
- The same.

52
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,020
I can't believe it.

53
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:40,511
Well, it's time to say
good-bye, Betty.

54
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,098
- It's been so nice traveling with you.
- Thank you, Irene.

55
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:47,894
I was so excited and nervous. It was
sure great to have you to talk to.

56
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:52,523
- I'll watch for you on the big screen.
- Okay, Irene.

57
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:54,692
Won't that be the day?

58
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,153
Good luck, Betty dear.

59
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,532
- Take care of yourself and be careful.
- I will.

60
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:03,785
Thanks, again.

61
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:06,996
Betty, it was so nice meeting you.
All the luck in the world.

62
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,790
Thank you.

63
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:21,135
- My bags?
- Where to?

64
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,472
1612, Hayvenhurst.

65
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:28,851
Got it.

66
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:51,142
- Ten bucks says you're Betty.
- Yes, I am, Mrs. Lenoix.

67
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:55,396
- It is Mrs. Lenoix, isn't it?
- In all my living glory, baby.

68
00:20:56,189 --> 00:21:00,485
- Pleased to meet you.
- Call me Coco. Everybody else does.

69
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:04,030
- Wait there and I'll go get the key.
- Okay, Coco.

70
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,453
Wilkins!

71
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:11,704
Wilkins!

72
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:15,416
If that damn dog craps
in the courtyard one more time...

73
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:20,505
I'm just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast! You don't have any pets?

74
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,423
- No, I don't.
- They're allowed.

75
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,593
I just don't like them
in here for obvious reasons.

76
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:30,306
There was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo.

77
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:35,895
You just wouldn't believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard.

78
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:40,066
Let's go see your aunt's apartment.
It's a good one.

79
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,235
I can hardly wait.

80
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:53,663
- It's unbelievable!
- I told you.

81
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:59,127
You and your aunt probably have
an understanding, so here's the key.

82
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:01,838
And if you need anything,
just give a holler.

83
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:05,508
Everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me...

84
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:08,011
or they wouldn't be here.

85
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:11,514
If you like, later on
I'll introduce you around.

86
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,350
Well, no hard feelings if you don't.

87
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,274
I'm sorry. My aunt Ruth didn't tell
me someone was gonna be here.

88
00:23:44,482 --> 00:23:47,026
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

89
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:52,865
I'm Ruth's niece. My name is Betty.
I'm sure she told you I was coming.

90
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:57,495
There was an accident.
I came here.

91
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:00,248
I understand. I saw the dress.

92
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,293
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

93
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:06,087
What happened?

94
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,173
A car...

95
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,176
a car accident.

96
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:16,222
Are you okay?

97
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,602
I think so.

98
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:23,229
I was just...

99
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:25,523
taking a shower.

100
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:29,402
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I'll let you get back to that.

101
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,988
I'm gonna get unpacked.

102
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,785
What's your name?

103
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,460
I'm sorry, I'll get out of here.
We can talk later.

104
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,415
My name is...

105
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,542
Rita.

106
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,214
Do you work with my aunt?

107
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:35,510
- No, I...
- I'm sorry...

108
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,929
it's none of my business.

109
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:43,560
She has pretty red hair.

110
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,145
She's letting me stay here while
she's working on a movie...

111
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:51,442
that's being made in Canada,
but I guess you already know that.

112
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,987
I couldn't afford a place like this
in a million years.

113
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:58,116
Unless, of course, I'm discovered
and become a movie star.

114
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:01,327
Of course, I'd rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star...

115
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:04,747
but sometimes people
end up being both. So...

116
00:26:04,956 --> 00:26:08,334
that is, I guess you'd say,
the story of why I came here.

117
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,758
I'm sorry. I'm just
so excited to be here.

118
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:20,430
I just came here from Deep River,
Ontario, and now I'm in this...

119
00:26:21,222 --> 00:26:25,393
dream place!
Well, you can imagine how I feel.

120
00:26:33,735 --> 00:26:35,236
Sit down.

121
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:41,618
Where were you hurt?

122
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,997
- We should call a doctor.
- No.

123
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:50,835
- But this could be serious.
- No, I need to sleep.

124
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,254
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't sleep.

125
00:26:53,463 --> 00:26:55,840
I'll be okay if I sleep.

126
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,594
I just need to lie down
here and sleep.

127
00:27:56,985 --> 00:28:00,822
You see, Adam, there
are some suggestions...

128
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,949
that ought to be brought forward.

129
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:06,202
And I know you said you would
entertain suggestions.

130
00:28:06,411 --> 00:28:09,497
And that's all anybody
here is asking you to do.

131
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,460
- What are you talking about?
- An open mind.

132
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:20,049
You're in the process of recasting
your lead actress, and I'm...

133
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:25,054
we are asking you to keep
an open mind.

134
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,567
What was it the last time?

135
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:44,699
- Okay, lets try the next one.
- He's not gonna like it.

136
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,993
We'll see.

137
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:58,212
Castigliani brothers!
Let me introduce you around.

138
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:01,799
Please...

139
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:05,595
take a seat. This is Mr. Darby,
whom you know.

140
00:29:05,803 --> 00:29:09,057
And this is the director,
Adam Kesher.

141
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:12,894
And his manager, Robert Smith.

142
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:49,555
She's very pretty.

143
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:54,310
May I offer you gentlemen anything?

144
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:59,232
- Espresso.
- Nothing.

145
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:02,777
- What's the photo for?
- One espresso.

146
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,489
No, that's it.

147
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:08,992
I think you're going to enjoy
your espresso this time.

148
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:11,452
I've done quite a bit of research...

149
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,204
knowing how hard
you are to please.

150
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,456
This one comes
highly recommended.

151
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:19,836
- What's the photo for?
- It's a recommendation.

152
00:30:20,837 --> 00:30:23,673
A recommendation to you, Adam.

153
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:28,261
- It's not a recommendation.
- This is the girl.

154
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,890
What girl? For what?
What is this, Ray?

155
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:37,395
We'd be happy to put her on the
list for considerations.

156
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:42,025
You'd be pleased to know, there's
quite a bit of interest in this role.

157
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:47,405
Interest? There's six of the top
actresses that want this thing.

158
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,908
This is the girl.

159
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:53,244
- Ray, take care of this.
- Hold on, hold on, Adam.

160
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:54,746
Hold on?

161
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:57,540
There's no way!
There's no way!

162
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,599
Napkin.

163
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,227
Pardon?

164
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:18,937
Napkin.

165
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:21,397
Of course.

166
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:23,441
Excuse me.

167
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,210
Is that all, sir?

168
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:42,979
- Shit.
- Sorry. That was highly recommended.

169
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:45,773
That is considered one of the finest
espressos in the world!

170
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:49,527
What's going on here? There is
no way that girl is in my movie!

171
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:58,202
- This is the girl.
- Hey, that girl is not in my film!

172
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:03,458
It's no longer your film.

173
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,548
This is the girl.

174
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:52,548
Castigliani brothers get out
of that limo?

175
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:55,051
- The two guys in dark suits?
- Yeah.

176
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,096
- Yes.
- Leave that door open.

177
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,024
Castigliani brothers?

178
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,026
Beat it, pal.

179
00:34:56,821 --> 00:34:58,573
Good afternoon, Mr. Roque.

180
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:04,120
Her name is Camilla Rhodes.

181
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:07,540
The director doesn't want her.

182
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:13,713
Do you want him replaced?

183
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,468
I know they said...

184
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,388
Then?

185
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,641
Then...

186
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,019
that means we should...?

187
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:32,649
Yes?

188
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:38,071
Shut everything down?
Is that something that...

189
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,369
Do you want us to shut
everything down?

190
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:52,794
Then we'll shut everything down.

191
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:25,785
Oh, man, that's unheard of.

192
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:29,205
An accident like that, who could
have foreseen that, man?

193
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:34,752
- It's unreal, right?
- Yeah.

194
00:36:36,045 --> 00:36:38,172
Unbelievable, man.

195
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:47,181
So, bro? God, you look good.

196
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:50,727
- What have you been doing?
- You know, just...

197
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:52,604
doing some stuff for this guy.

198
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,732
Are you making ends meet?

199
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:57,609
Hardly.

200
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:02,947
I know, man, look at my digs.

201
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:06,826
Times are tough, bro.

202
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:11,039
Hey... man, it's not that bad.

203
00:37:12,206 --> 00:37:14,792
I hope you're not gonna
get in any trouble.

204
00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:18,004
That was just a thing, man.
That story? That made you laugh!

205
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:22,592
- That was a funny story, man.
- Fucking car accident!

206
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:28,056
Hey, so that's... that's it, huh?

207
00:37:28,264 --> 00:37:30,683
That's Ed's famous black book.

208
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:36,272
The history of the world...

209
00:37:36,773 --> 00:37:38,566
in phone numbers.

210
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,139
Oh, man!

211
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,572
Something bit me bad!

212
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:16,789
Hey, man!

213
00:39:16,998 --> 00:39:20,585
She's hurt real bad! Could you come
here and call on the phone, please?

214
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:25,173
She's hurt real bad! You gotta
come in here and call the hospital!

215
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:31,012
Come on, man! I'm serious about this!
I can't do everything by myself!

216
00:39:51,658 --> 00:39:53,034
Hey, man.

217
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,327
Oh, man!

218
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:58,182
Aunt Ruth, I'll try. I'm gonna study
those lines until I know them...

219
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,560
inside out.

220
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:03,897
Either right here on
this fabulous leather couch...

221
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,940
or I'll take them with
a coffee into the courtyard...

222
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:08,318
like a regular movie star.

223
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:11,404
I got a real shock to find your
friend Rita here.

224
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,616
She was in the shower
and I opened the door!

225
00:41:14,908 --> 00:41:16,701
Rita!

226
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:18,912
What do you mean?

227
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:22,040
She was in an accident.

228
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:25,919
Rita. Your friend.

229
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:30,089
No, Coco unlocked the door.

230
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:33,801
No, she didn't see her.

231
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,888
She's sleeping.

232
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:42,018
I'm sure there's some explanation for
this. I don't think we have to do that.

233
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,733
Please, don't worry. Aunt Ruth,
we don't need the police.

234
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:04,082
You're awake.

235
00:42:07,961 --> 00:42:09,754
I think I misunderstood.

236
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:13,424
I thought you knew my aunt
and that's why you were here.

237
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:17,053
I just talked to my aunt on the phone
and she wants me to call the police.

238
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,478
Rita?

239
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:31,150
I'm sorry, I...

240
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:33,695
What is it, Rita?

241
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:41,911
I thought when I woke up...
I thought sleep would do it.

242
00:42:42,745 --> 00:42:44,831
What's wrong?

243
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,085
I just don't know who I am.

244
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:52,797
- What do you mean? You're Rita.
- No, I'm not.

245
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:56,217
I don't know what my name is.

246
00:42:56,426 --> 00:42:58,678
I don't know who I am.

247
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:12,901
This is your purse.
Your name must be in your purse.

248
00:43:14,944 --> 00:43:17,113
You wanna know, don't you?

249
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,450
- Yes, but...
- Open it.

250
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:58,673
- Sure you don't want anything?
- Not here.

251
00:44:58,923 --> 00:45:00,758
- Thanks.
- A drink or something?

252
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:03,261
No. Thanks, though.

253
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,848
I'll take a cigarette,
if you have one.

254
00:45:09,726 --> 00:45:12,312
Yeah, just reach inside my
shirt pocket there.

255
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,944
Any new girls on the street lately?

256
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:23,114
No.

257
00:45:23,698 --> 00:45:25,992
I haven't seen any.

258
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:29,454
A brunette?

259
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:32,290
Maybe a little beat-up?

260
00:45:32,498 --> 00:45:34,000
No.

261
00:45:38,046 --> 00:45:41,633
- Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
- Sure.

262
00:45:42,675 --> 00:45:43,968
You bet you will.

263
00:45:47,013 --> 00:45:49,098
That money...

264
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:54,062
you don't know where it came from?

265
00:45:56,564 --> 00:46:00,902
When you think of them,
the money and the key...

266
00:46:02,904 --> 00:46:05,865
does it make you
remember anything?

267
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:10,745
There's something...

268
00:46:11,663 --> 00:46:13,998
something...

269
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:16,960
there.

270
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:28,596
What did you say?

271
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:32,392
- They fired everyone.
- Who fired everyone?

272
00:46:32,976 --> 00:46:37,063
Ray did!
Wait! I'm talking on the phone.

273
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,569
They closed the set. Everybody's
gone. You'd better get down here.

274
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,405
No.

275
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:48,199
You've gotta talk to Ray.
You've gotta fix this.

276
00:46:48,408 --> 00:46:49,993
I'm going home.

277
00:46:50,201 --> 00:46:51,494
Home?

278
00:46:51,703 --> 00:46:55,331
Meet me at the office, we gotta do
something. You gotta do something!

279
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:59,794
- I'm going home, Cynthia.
- Adam, this isn't like you.

280
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:02,964
Please, come to the office. There's
gotta be something we can do!

281
00:47:03,172 --> 00:47:05,133
I'm going home.

282
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:18,021
I wonder where you were going.

283
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,444
Mulholland Drive.

284
00:47:29,532 --> 00:47:31,326
Mulholland Drive?

285
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,747
That's where I was going.

286
00:47:36,456 --> 00:47:38,875
Mulholland Drive.

287
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:43,296
Maybe that's where
the accident was.

288
00:47:44,005 --> 00:47:47,216
There must be a police report.
We could call.

289
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:51,971
We could call anonymously just
to see if there was an accident.

290
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:58,353
It'll be just like in the movies!
We'll pretend to be someone else.

291
00:47:59,938 --> 00:48:01,940
I wanna walk around, anyway.

292
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:04,859
I'm in Hollywood and
I haven't even seen any of it.

293
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,279
Come on, Rita,
do you feel up to it?

294
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,497
Okay.

295
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:19,999
But just...

296
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:24,254
just to see.

297
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:28,341
Just to see if there was
an accident...

298
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:31,344
on Mulholland Drive.

299
00:49:13,803 --> 00:49:15,597
Lorraine?

300
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:19,100
You're home?

301
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,022
Lorraine?

302
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:46,002
Now you've done it!

303
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:51,674
Just forget you ever saw it.
It's better that way.

304
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,472
What the hell are you
even doing here?

305
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:11,861
What are you doing?

306
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:17,492
That's my jewelry!

307
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:39,180
- That bastard. You bastard!
- He's probably upset, Lorraine.

308
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,772
What are you doing?

309
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:51,109
Stop it!

310
00:50:51,317 --> 00:50:52,694
Stop it!

311
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:54,946
Adam, stop it!

312
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,448
Stop it!

313
00:50:57,865 --> 00:50:59,200
Stop it!

314
00:51:03,246 --> 00:51:05,832
You're hurting me! Gene!

315
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,001
You're hurting me!

316
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:14,799
That ain't no way to treat your
wife. I don't care what she's done.

317
00:51:16,217 --> 00:51:18,428
Throw him out!

318
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:20,597
Throw him out!

319
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:23,433
Damn you, Adam!

320
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:25,768
Throw him out!

321
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:33,818
Get out!

322
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,318
Let's hide it.

323
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:02,574
There's one.

324
00:53:18,548 --> 00:53:21,342
- Los Angeles Police Department.
- I'm inquiring about an accident...

325
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:25,930
...last night on Mulholland Drive.
- I'll connect you to Traffic.

326
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,477
- Sergeant Baker.
- Hi, I'm inquiring...

327
00:53:33,563 --> 00:53:37,984
I heard a sound last night that
sounded sort of like a car crash.

328
00:53:38,192 --> 00:53:41,029
I want to know if there was an
accident on Mulholland Drive.

329
00:53:41,237 --> 00:53:43,281
Yes, there was.

330
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:46,409
- Can you tell me what happened?
- No, I can't.

331
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:49,370
- Was anyone hurt?
- May I have your name, please?

332
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,379
There was an accident.

333
00:53:58,588 --> 00:54:02,258
He wouldn't tell me anything else,
but that was your accident, Rita.

334
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:06,471
Maybe there's something
about it in the papers.

335
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:08,973
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of
coffee and we can see.

336
00:54:13,228 --> 00:54:16,814
Maybe it happened so late it's
not in today's paper.

337
00:54:17,023 --> 00:54:19,234
There's nothing?

338
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:22,779
Not that I can see.

339
00:54:24,405 --> 00:54:25,823
That's okay.

340
00:54:30,536 --> 00:54:32,330
Thanks.

341
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:35,750
Diane.

342
00:54:40,338 --> 00:54:43,007
Will that be all?
Would you like your check?

343
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,843
Rita, you want something?

344
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:52,350
- No, just... just the coffee.
- We'll take our check.

345
00:54:59,691 --> 00:55:01,776
What is it, Rita?

346
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:14,205
I remember something.
I remember something!

347
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,670
- What is it?
- Diane Selwyn.

348
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:23,298
Maybe that's my name!

349
00:55:28,761 --> 00:55:31,806
"D. Selwyn." It's the only one.

350
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:34,475
I'm gonna call.

351
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:46,195
- It is strange to be calling yourself.
- Maybe it's not me.

352
00:55:55,246 --> 00:55:56,873
Hello, it's me.

353
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,167
Leave a message.

354
00:56:01,336 --> 00:56:03,421
That's not my voice.

355
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,508
But I know her!

356
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:14,599
Maybe that isn't Diane Selwyn's
voice. Maybe that's your roommate.

357
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:19,145
Or if it is Diane Selwyn,
she could tell you who you are.

358
00:56:20,438 --> 00:56:22,398
Maybe.

359
00:56:22,774 --> 00:56:24,984
Maybe, maybe...

360
00:56:59,102 --> 00:57:00,937
Adam Kesher?

361
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,026
- Adam Kesher?
- Get lost!

362
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:09,737
- This is Adam Kesher's house.
- Like hell it is! Get out now!

363
00:57:09,946 --> 00:57:11,197
Get out!

364
00:57:13,366 --> 00:57:15,076
Adam Kesher?

365
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:24,002
Get out of here!
He's never coming back! Ever!

366
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,214
- Bastard.
- I guess you don't understand English.

367
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:30,466
She said leave. Here's the door.

368
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:32,051
Gene!

369
00:57:32,552 --> 00:57:33,886
Get out!

370
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:36,097
Get out!

371
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,978
Adam Kesher?

372
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,629
- Yeah, what is it, Cookie?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kesher...

373
00:58:07,837 --> 00:58:11,341
but there seems to be some
problem with your credit cards.

374
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:14,552
What? I pay you cash, Cookie.

375
00:58:16,596 --> 00:58:20,683
Listen, two guys from
your bank came by.

376
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:23,144
My bank?

377
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:26,898
- How'd they know I was here?
- I don't know.

378
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:30,318
What'd they say?

379
00:58:30,526 --> 00:58:34,197
They said to tell you that you're
maxed out at your bank...

380
00:58:34,405 --> 00:58:37,659
and that your line of credit
has been canceled.

381
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:41,454
That's unbelievable.

382
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:44,832
Well, look...

383
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:52,215
I don't know what's going on.
That is so much baloney.

384
00:58:54,717 --> 00:59:00,515
- I got enough cash for you, Cookie.
- I know, I know. Don't worry.

385
00:59:01,307 --> 00:59:06,312
But I'm sorry, it's my duty
to inform you...

386
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:12,360
listen, man,
whoever you're hiding from...

387
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:15,238
they know where you are.

388
00:59:16,364 --> 00:59:18,157
Right.

389
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,160
I'm sorry.

390
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,810
Hello?

391
00:59:46,144 --> 00:59:49,772
- Someone maybe shut off my money.
- I know. Where are you, Adam?

392
00:59:50,106 --> 00:59:54,485
- Sorry, what do you mean you know?
- Somebody called...

393
00:59:54,694 --> 00:59:58,865
they told me you were as good as
broke. So I made a few calls.

394
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,367
- And?
- You're broke.

395
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:02,911
I'm not broke!

396
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:05,747
I know, but you're broke.
Where are you?

397
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:11,502
- I'm at Cookie's, downtown.
- Do you know somebody called...

398
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,755
"The Cowboy"?

399
01:00:14,797 --> 01:00:17,091
- "The cowboy"?
- Yeah.

400
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:21,930
"The Cowboy". This guy,
the Cowboy, wants to see you.

401
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:25,141
Jason said he thought
it would be a good idea.

402
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:29,270
Jason thought it would be a good
idea for me to go see the Cowboy.

403
01:00:29,479 --> 01:00:32,774
Should I wear my 1O-gallon hat
and my six-shooters?

404
01:00:33,191 --> 01:00:36,444
Something tells me that this guy
is connected to what's happening.

405
01:00:37,612 --> 01:00:41,032
Adam, I think you should do it, and
you should do it right away.

406
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:46,329
- What's going on, Cynthia?
- It's been a very strange day.

407
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:50,333
And getting stranger.

408
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,338
Where do I meet this Cowboy? Do you
have to ride out to the range?

409
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:00,593
Sort of, funny boy.
If I tell him the meeting's on...

410
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:06,349
you'll go to the top of the Beachwood
Canyon, there's a corral up there...

411
01:01:06,558 --> 01:01:09,936
...where he'll be.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

412
01:01:10,311 --> 01:01:12,564
Will you meet with him?

413
01:01:12,814 --> 01:01:14,023
Yeah.

414
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:18,278
Sure. This has been
that kind of a day. When?

415
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:22,365
I'll call him right away
and then I'll call you back.

416
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:27,370
You know, you could stay at
my place, if you wanted.

417
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:32,959
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.
- I was just offering a place to stay.

418
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:36,462
Yes, and I appreciate the offer,
Cynthia. I'll find a place.

419
01:01:36,671 --> 01:01:39,674
Just go on and give that cowboy
a yodel and get on back to me.

420
01:01:39,882 --> 01:01:43,428
Okay. But you don't know
what you're missing.

421
01:01:43,636 --> 01:01:46,556
Just get along, little doggie.
And call me back.

422
01:01:58,693 --> 01:02:02,780
It's right about here. Sierra Bonita.
It's not too far away.

423
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,451
What's wrong with that?

424
01:02:07,243 --> 01:02:09,621
I'm not sure about this.

425
01:02:10,997 --> 01:02:14,083
I know you're afraid of something.

426
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:17,670
We'll be careful. I promise.

427
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:21,925
Tomorrow. We'll go over there...

428
01:02:22,133 --> 01:02:24,177
and we'll find out.

429
01:02:37,398 --> 01:02:39,651
It'll be okay.

430
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:44,405
It's probably Coco.

431
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:52,413
- Yes, may I help you?
- Someone is in trouble!

432
01:02:54,165 --> 01:02:56,501
Who are you?

433
01:02:57,252 --> 01:03:00,004
What are you doing
in Ruth's apartment?

434
01:03:00,463 --> 01:03:04,842
She's letting me stay here.
I'm her niece. My name's Betty.

435
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:08,846
No, it's not!
That's not what she said.

436
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:13,351
Someone is in trouble!
Something bad is happening!

437
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,647
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who you are and...

438
01:03:17,855 --> 01:03:21,234
Louise?
What are you doing, Louise?

439
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:26,531
I've been trying to get hold of you
since 3 o'clock this afternoon.

440
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:29,993
That one is in my room and
she won't leave!

441
01:03:30,201 --> 01:03:33,246
I want you to get her out.
I want you to get her out now.

442
01:03:34,038 --> 01:03:37,208
This is Louise Bonner.
I'm sure she meant well.

443
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:40,378
Louise, this is Betty,
this is Ruth's niece.

444
01:03:40,587 --> 01:03:45,842
I was on my way over here to see
Betty. Betty is a young actress.

445
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:50,096
I was delivering some faxed pages of
a scene for a big audition tomorrow.

446
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:53,099
- Well, here they are, honey.
- Thank you.

447
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:55,727
Come along now, Louise.
I'll take you home.

448
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:57,979
I'm sorry.
It happens sometimes. Come on.

449
01:03:58,187 --> 01:04:01,316
No, she said it was someone
else who was in trouble.

450
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:05,445
Stop it, Louise!
I'm taking you home. Come on.

451
01:04:06,529 --> 01:04:08,823
- Good night, Betty.
- Good night.

452
01:04:09,866 --> 01:04:11,618
Good night.

453
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:52,659
Cowboy...

454
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:03,146
- Howdy.
- Howdy to you.

455
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:08,026
Beautiful evening.

456
01:06:11,404 --> 01:06:15,033
Thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that...

457
01:06:15,241 --> 01:06:17,285
nice hotel downtown.

458
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:21,956
No problem.
What's on your mind?

459
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:25,960
Well, now. Here's a man who
wants to get right down to it.

460
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:29,297
Kind of anxious
to get to it, are you?

461
01:06:29,505 --> 01:06:31,382
Whatever.

462
01:06:32,842 --> 01:06:35,261
A man's attitude...

463
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:40,600
a man's attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be.

464
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:43,811
Is that something
you might agree with?

465
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:46,356
Sure!

466
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:50,401
Did you answer because that's what
you thought I wanted to hear...

467
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,654
or did you think about what I said...

468
01:06:52,862 --> 01:06:57,116
and answered 'cause you
truly believe that to be right?

469
01:06:57,867 --> 01:07:01,579
I agree with what you said. Truly.

470
01:07:03,706 --> 01:07:06,417
What'd I say?

471
01:07:08,336 --> 01:07:12,257
That a man's attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be.

472
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:16,302
So since you agree...

473
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:21,558
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life.

474
01:07:21,891 --> 01:07:23,810
How's that?

475
01:07:25,353 --> 01:07:27,647
Well, stop for a little second...

476
01:07:27,897 --> 01:07:31,776
and think about it.
Can you do that for me?

477
01:07:33,987 --> 01:07:37,198
Okay. I'm thinking.

478
01:07:40,618 --> 01:07:46,249
No, you're not. You're too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking.

479
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,296
Now, I want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck.

480
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,715
Can you try that for me?

481
01:07:53,923 --> 01:07:57,594
Look, where's this going?
What do you want me to do?

482
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:03,808
There's sometimes a buggy.
How many drivers does a buggy have?

483
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:05,977
One.

484
01:08:06,686 --> 01:08:09,939
So let's just say
I'm driving this buggy.

485
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:14,819
And if you fix your attitude,
you can ride along with me.

486
01:08:17,113 --> 01:08:19,532
I want you to go back
to work tomorrow.

487
01:08:20,533 --> 01:08:26,372
You were recasting the lead actress.
Audition many girls for the part.

488
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:32,337
When you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today, you will say:

489
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:35,715
"This is the girl."

490
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:39,719
The rest of the cast can stay.
That's up to you.

491
01:08:40,637 --> 01:08:43,932
But that lead girl
is not up to you.

492
01:08:45,892 --> 01:08:50,396
Now, you will see me one more
time if you do good.

493
01:08:51,397 --> 01:08:56,444
You'll see me two more times
if you do bad.

494
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,696
Good night.

495
01:09:24,722 --> 01:09:28,518
- You're still here?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

496
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:32,814
- Nobody wants you here!
- Really?

497
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:36,067
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left!

498
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:40,321
- So? Surprise.
- I can call them. I can call my dad.

499
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:44,534
- But you won't.
- If you're trying to blackmail me...

500
01:09:45,243 --> 01:09:47,912
it's not going to work! You're
playing a dangerous game here.

501
01:09:48,121 --> 01:09:50,498
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

502
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:54,127
Get out!
Get out before I call my dad!

503
01:09:54,335 --> 01:09:57,338
He trusts you!
You're his best friend.

504
01:09:57,547 --> 01:09:59,716
This will be the
end of everything.

505
01:09:59,924 --> 01:10:02,760
What about you?
What will your dad think about you?

506
01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:06,889
Stop! Just stop it! That's what
you said from the beginning.

507
01:10:07,724 --> 01:10:10,935
If I tell what happened, they'll
arrest you and put you in jail.

508
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:13,605
Get out of here before...

509
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,775
- Before what?
- Before...

510
01:10:17,984 --> 01:10:22,572
...I kill you.
- Then they'd put you in jail.

511
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,579
Then I cry, cry, cry,
and then I say with big emotion...

512
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:32,790
"I hate you! I hate us both!"

513
01:10:35,877 --> 01:10:39,589
- Such a lame scene.
- But you are really good.

514
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:43,009
Thank you, darling.

515
01:10:57,815 --> 01:11:00,443
Hi, there. Who are you?

516
01:11:03,613 --> 01:11:05,490
Betty?

517
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:15,291
Betty, can I see you outside
for a minute?

518
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,266
What is it, Coco?

519
01:11:31,516 --> 01:11:32,976
Your aunt called.

520
01:11:34,477 --> 01:11:35,979
I was afraid of that.

521
01:11:36,187 --> 01:11:39,065
She wants to know who's
staying in her apartment.

522
01:11:40,024 --> 01:11:42,902
It's just for a night or two.
Until she finds her own place.

523
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:45,488
I tried to explain that to aunt Ruth
but the connection was bad...

524
01:11:45,697 --> 01:11:48,783
and her plane was leaving,
and she got it all mixed up.

525
01:11:48,992 --> 01:11:50,827
I kept telling her
that it was my friend Rita...

526
01:11:51,035 --> 01:11:53,329
and she kept saying
she didn't know any Ritas.

527
01:11:54,622 --> 01:11:58,668
- Look at me straight, sweetie.
- Coco, she's very nice.

528
01:11:58,876 --> 01:12:00,670
Honey, you're a good kid...

529
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,048
but what you're telling me is
a load of horse puckey.

530
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:06,968
Even though it
comes from a good place.

531
01:12:07,218 --> 01:12:09,637
I'm gonna trust you
to sort this thing out.

532
01:12:10,388 --> 01:12:13,600
- Thank you.
- Don't make me out to be a sucker.

533
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:17,770
Louise Bonner said there is trouble
in there, remember last night?

534
01:12:18,354 --> 01:12:21,983
Well, sometimes she's wrong...

535
01:12:22,191 --> 01:12:26,487
but if there is trouble,
get rid of it.

536
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,124
Is everything all right?

537
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:43,546
- Is it bad for you that I'm here?
- No, no, everything is A-Okay.

538
01:12:43,755 --> 01:12:48,968
Now, I've gotta fix that sandwich.
And my audition is in one hour!

539
01:13:08,905 --> 01:13:11,324
I hope I'm back
in a couple of hours.

540
01:13:11,741 --> 01:13:14,786
- And don't drink all the Coke.
- Good luck.

541
01:13:14,994 --> 01:13:18,873
When I get back, I'll keep the
cab waiting, so be ready to go.

542
01:13:49,195 --> 01:13:50,321
"Voilà!"

543
01:13:51,197 --> 01:13:54,033
Betty Elms, I would
like you to meet...

544
01:13:54,242 --> 01:13:56,452
Jack Tutman, my assistant.

545
01:13:57,537 --> 01:14:00,623
Woody Katz, who we have
cast in the part of Chuck...

546
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,167
and will do the scene with you.

547
01:14:03,918 --> 01:14:05,962
Bob Rooker, our director...

548
01:14:06,212 --> 01:14:08,214
and Julie Chadwick.

549
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:12,802
Now, our surprise guest,
Lynne James.

550
01:14:13,011 --> 01:14:16,055
Alas, we can't afford her to
cast our show but...

551
01:14:16,306 --> 01:14:20,435
well, as casting agents go,
she is the best.

552
01:14:21,019 --> 01:14:24,147
Why, thank you, Wally.
Hello, Betty.

553
01:14:24,606 --> 01:14:28,401
- Very pleased to meet you.
- This is my assistant, Nikki.

554
01:14:29,193 --> 01:14:34,616
And the ever lovely Martha. Martha
Johnson, whom you met out front.

555
01:14:36,993 --> 01:14:38,286
Hi.

556
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:42,582
So, shall we give it a go?

557
01:14:43,374 --> 01:14:47,086
Would you like a water,
a coffee before we begin?

558
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:49,213
No, I'm fine.

559
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:52,383
Well then,
let's everyone take a seat.

560
01:14:55,470 --> 01:15:01,601
Betty, why don't you join Woody
over there and we'll play the scene.

561
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:04,771
Bob, do you have anything
you wish to say?

562
01:15:05,521 --> 01:15:08,149
Something to Betty
before we begin?

563
01:15:08,358 --> 01:15:10,860
No. It's not a contest.

564
01:15:12,195 --> 01:15:13,947
The two of them...

565
01:15:14,864 --> 01:15:17,408
with themselves.

566
01:15:18,076 --> 01:15:21,788
So don't play it for real...

567
01:15:21,996 --> 01:15:24,916
until it gets real.

568
01:15:29,963 --> 01:15:31,714
Okay.

569
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,592
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.

570
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:35,885
What?

571
01:15:36,094 --> 01:15:39,764
I wanna play this one nice and close
like we did with that other girl...

572
01:15:40,139 --> 01:15:43,560
what's her name? With the black
hair. It felt good, what do you think?

573
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:47,939
That's good, Woody. Just don't rush
that line again. I told you...

574
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:50,942
the line where you say:
"Before what?"

575
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:57,824
Bobby, acting is reacting.
I just play off them. They all say:

576
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:01,536
"They're gonna arrest you", like
that, and: "They'll put you in jail."

577
01:16:01,744 --> 01:16:05,123
They say it the same way.
So when they say it, I just react.

578
01:16:05,331 --> 01:16:06,666
- What's your name?
- Betty.

579
01:16:06,874 --> 01:16:11,921
Betty, look. You don't rush it,
I don't rush it, okay?

580
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:17,844
Now, we're gonna play this nice and
close just like in the movies, okay?

581
01:16:20,597 --> 01:16:23,433
Dad's best friend goes to work.

582
01:16:24,601 --> 01:16:26,144
Bob?

583
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:29,981
And...

584
01:16:30,815 --> 01:16:32,525
action!

585
01:16:36,487 --> 01:16:38,406
You're still here.

586
01:16:40,033 --> 01:16:41,451
I came back.

587
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:45,163
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- Nobody wants you here.

588
01:16:45,371 --> 01:16:46,873
Really?

589
01:16:47,081 --> 01:16:51,169
My parents are right upstairs.
They think you've left.

590
01:16:51,377 --> 01:16:53,129
So, surprise!

591
01:16:53,713 --> 01:16:58,718
- I can call them, I can call my dad.
- But you won't.

592
01:17:14,776 --> 01:17:17,779
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

593
01:17:19,113 --> 01:17:21,783
If you're trying to blackmail me...

594
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:24,702
it's not gonna work.

595
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:30,541
You know what I want.
It's not that difficult.

596
01:17:33,503 --> 01:17:35,255
Get out.

597
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:39,842
Get out before I call my dad.

598
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:44,264
He trusts you. You're his...

599
01:17:45,223 --> 01:17:47,225
best friend.

600
01:17:51,145 --> 01:17:53,940
This will be the end
of everything.

601
01:17:56,276 --> 01:18:00,029
What about you? What'll
your dad think about you?

602
01:18:00,655 --> 01:18:02,574
Stop.

603
01:18:03,074 --> 01:18:05,076
Stop it.

604
01:18:06,536 --> 01:18:09,372
That's what you said from
the beginning.

605
01:18:10,748 --> 01:18:15,086
If I tell them what happened, they
will arrest you and put you in jail.

606
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,387
So get out of here...

607
01:18:24,596 --> 01:18:26,431
before...

608
01:18:29,851 --> 01:18:32,103
Before what?

609
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:52,123
Before...

610
01:18:52,749 --> 01:18:55,501
I kill you.

611
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:12,852
Well, then they'd put you in jail.

612
01:19:21,402 --> 01:19:23,821
I hate you.

613
01:19:24,822 --> 01:19:26,991
I hate us both.

614
01:19:43,132 --> 01:19:45,551
- I'm gonna take her over there.
- Yeah, big time.

615
01:19:49,597 --> 01:19:52,058
Well, there it was.

616
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:57,605
Yeah, there it was, all right. Baby,
you got a way with you. Really.

617
01:19:58,565 --> 01:19:59,774
Bob?

618
01:20:01,568 --> 01:20:04,195
Very good. Really.

619
01:20:04,737 --> 01:20:10,743
I mean, it was forced maybe,
but still humanistic.

620
01:20:12,996 --> 01:20:15,582
Very good. Really!

621
01:20:16,082 --> 01:20:17,875
Really.

622
01:20:23,256 --> 01:20:28,428
Oh, I thank you, Betty.
And I really mean that, sincerely.

623
01:20:28,636 --> 01:20:30,263
I mean, it was...

624
01:20:30,513 --> 01:20:32,390
extraordinary.

625
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:34,767
You've done your aunt proud today.

626
01:20:34,976 --> 01:20:38,730
I'm going to tell
her that first chance I get.

627
01:20:38,938 --> 01:20:43,276
Now, you and I are going
to speak again very soon.

628
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:47,280
- Thank you, Mr. Brown.
- Thank you, Wally.

629
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:51,242
I'm sure you all have a lot to talk
about. We'll walk Betty out.

630
01:20:51,492 --> 01:20:54,913
Yes, indeed.
And it was our pleasure, Lynne.

631
01:20:55,121 --> 01:20:59,542
Don't you be a stranger around here.
We'd love to have you here.

632
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:02,587
- Come on, Betty.
- Thank you again, Mr. Brown.

633
01:21:02,795 --> 01:21:06,007
And it was nice meeting
all of you.

634
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:07,800
Bye.

635
01:21:09,427 --> 01:21:11,054
Bye!

636
01:21:15,516 --> 01:21:18,436
She's a slam-dunk! Where
the hell did you find her?

637
01:21:19,062 --> 01:21:21,147
God, that was awful!

638
01:21:22,148 --> 01:21:26,527
Not you, Betty. You were stellar,
and I mean that. But poor Wally.

639
01:21:26,736 --> 01:21:31,032
He'll never get that picture made.
Wally's days were up 2O years ago.

640
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:34,327
You know Woody Katz
is only doing it for a favor.

641
01:21:34,577 --> 01:21:36,621
And the cast they have
so far is terrible.

642
01:21:36,829 --> 01:21:41,292
Oh, God, terrible!
That poor old fool Wally.

643
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:45,129
He was very nice
and he seems so sweet.

644
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:47,966
And Wally... Mr. Brown is a very
close friend of my aunt's.

645
01:21:48,174 --> 01:21:51,302
Don't get me wrong, I love Wally.

646
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:54,514
I ought to, I was married
to him for 1O years.

647
01:21:54,889 --> 01:22:00,645
And I love actors. All actors.
We just get a little catty sometimes.

648
01:22:01,437 --> 01:22:04,232
We want to take you across and
introduce you to a director...

649
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,192
who's a head above the rest.

650
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:08,695
He's got a project
you will kill for.

651
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:11,739
Knock right out of the park!

652
01:22:13,491 --> 01:22:16,286
Sixteen reasons

653
01:22:16,494 --> 01:22:22,250

01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:26,588

That's just half

Of sixteen reasons

666
01:23:08,463 --> 01:23:13,760
Why I love you

667
01:23:15,178 --> 01:23:18,514

Those are all

Of sixteen reasons

677
01:23:47,335 --> 01:23:53,007
Why I love you

678
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,553
Sixteen reasons

679
01:23:57,762 --> 01:24:02,809
Why I love you

680
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:09,524
- Cut it! Thank you very much, Carol.
- Checking the gate?

681
01:24:09,732 --> 01:24:12,277
Checking the gate! Thank you.
We'll tell you what happens next!

682
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:15,572
Thank you very much for coming in.
I know how busy you are.

683
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:18,658
Are you kidding me? I loved the script.
Just show me where to sign.

684
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:21,828
I love you, but there's no way they're
gonna let me cast this thing...

685
01:24:22,036 --> 01:24:24,414
until I've seen everyone. I'll let
you know as soon as I can.

686
01:24:24,622 --> 01:24:29,335
I know you will. Because my manager
is gonna be bugging you. And me!

687
01:24:29,586 --> 01:24:32,630
- My pleasure. Now get outta here.
- You're so cruel to me.

688
01:24:32,839 --> 01:24:35,633
- I'm the girl who's playing this part.
- I'll see you later.

689
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:39,387
Hank? Where's Hank?

690
01:24:39,887 --> 01:24:42,348
- Who's next, Hank?
- Camilla Rhodes.

691
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:46,102
- Is she ready?
- All ready.

692
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,898
- Bring her in.
- Camilla Rhodes, next.

693
01:24:56,154 --> 01:24:59,782
"Sylvia North Story".
Camilla Rhodes, take one.

694
01:25:00,366 --> 01:25:02,827
Okay, here we go.
Let's lock it up, please.

695
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:05,955
- Roll sound, please.
- That's fit.

696
01:25:06,164 --> 01:25:08,041
Playback and action.

697
01:25:21,971 --> 01:25:24,349
Why haven't I told you?

698
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:28,019
Oh, baby, I told

699
01:25:28,228 --> 01:25:30,063
Every little star

700
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:34,525
Just how sweet I think you are

701
01:25:34,734 --> 01:25:39,030
Why haven't I told you?

702
01:25:39,739 --> 01:25:43,993
- Get Jason over here.
- Cindy, Adam wants to see Jason.

703
01:25:46,287 --> 01:25:50,166
Made my heart an open book

704
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:55,463
Why haven't I told you?

705
01:25:58,383 --> 01:26:02,136
Friends ask me Am I in love

706
01:26:02,345 --> 01:26:06,182
I always answer "yes"

707
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:10,270
Might as well confess

708
01:26:10,478 --> 01:26:14,023
If the answer's yes

709
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,403
Maybe you may love me too

710
01:26:18,611 --> 01:26:22,574
Oh, my darling, if you do

711
01:26:23,032 --> 01:26:26,494
- Why haven't you told me?
- Did you want to tell something?

712
01:26:37,297 --> 01:26:39,424
This is the girl.

713
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:47,015
Excellent choice, Adam.

714
01:26:58,443 --> 01:27:00,361
Oh, my goodness.

715
01:27:09,996 --> 01:27:11,998
I have to be somewhere.

716
01:27:12,206 --> 01:27:14,500
I promised a friend.

717
01:27:15,376 --> 01:27:18,963
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- Now?

718
01:27:43,404 --> 01:27:45,448
Should be around here.

719
01:27:46,324 --> 01:27:48,701
259O. That's it.

720
01:27:49,077 --> 01:27:51,913
Up there!
Does it look familiar?

721
01:28:00,838 --> 01:28:03,341
- Don't stop!
- What is it? What do you see?

722
01:28:03,758 --> 01:28:07,136
- Those men, in front, in the car.
- Do you know them?

723
01:28:08,554 --> 01:28:11,224
Keep going.
Go around to the back.

724
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:02,692
Selwyn, number 12.

725
01:29:26,382 --> 01:29:28,760
Now you got me scared.

726
01:29:53,076 --> 01:29:54,494
You see?

727
01:29:54,702 --> 01:29:57,705
I told you there was nothing
to be afraid of.

728
01:30:59,559 --> 01:31:00,935
Betty, wait. Wait!

729
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:04,981
Don't.

730
01:31:31,466 --> 01:31:33,927
No one's home.

731
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:35,762
Yes?

732
01:31:37,138 --> 01:31:38,973
Diane?

733
01:31:40,725 --> 01:31:42,810
Number 17.

734
01:31:44,604 --> 01:31:47,148
But it said number 12.

735
01:31:48,942 --> 01:31:50,902
I switched apartments with her.

736
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:54,989
She's in 17.
It's down at the end, on the left.

737
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:02,538
But she hasn't been around
for a few days.

738
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,960
We'll leave her a note.

739
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:09,128
I'll go with you.

740
01:32:11,172 --> 01:32:13,633
She still got some of my stuff.

741
01:32:19,055 --> 01:32:21,975
You go ahead.
I gotta get that.

742
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:40,618
- Guess you're not Diane Selwyn.
- Guess I'm not.

743
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,992
There's still no one home, I guess.

744
01:33:50,396 --> 01:33:52,982
- What are you doing?
- Come on, help me in.

745
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:56,778
Come on, I'll open the front door.

746
01:33:57,570 --> 01:33:59,155
No!

747
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:05,453
Come on.

748
01:34:09,707 --> 01:34:11,626
Come on!

749
01:36:37,146 --> 01:36:39,941
I know what you're doing.

750
01:37:00,461 --> 01:37:03,381
I know what you have to do.

751
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:08,344
But let me do it.

752
01:37:16,561 --> 01:37:19,439
Let me do it.

753
01:37:41,753 --> 01:37:45,006
You look like someone else.

754
01:38:06,694 --> 01:38:08,613
Good night, Betty.

755
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:11,574
You don't have to wear
that in the house.

756
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,534
What?

757
01:38:13,743 --> 01:38:15,536
The wig!

758
01:38:15,787 --> 01:38:21,167
I was just looking at myself again.
I'll take it off to sleep.

759
01:38:21,834 --> 01:38:24,295
You don't have
to sleep on that couch.

760
01:38:24,504 --> 01:38:28,675
- No, it's okay.
- No, it's not. This is a huge bed.

761
01:38:29,008 --> 01:38:31,094
Come on, just get in
and get a good night sleep.

762
01:39:03,293 --> 01:39:06,629
It's more comfortable than
the couch, isn't it?

763
01:39:15,847 --> 01:39:18,016
Thank you, Betty.

764
01:39:18,725 --> 01:39:23,438
It's nothing. I shouldn't have let
you sleep on the couch last night.

765
01:39:23,646 --> 01:39:25,440
No, I mean...

766
01:39:26,274 --> 01:39:28,443
thank you for everything.

767
01:39:32,697 --> 01:39:34,324
You're welcome.

768
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,961
Good night, sweet Betty.

769
01:39:56,596 --> 01:39:58,723
Good night.

770
01:40:40,556 --> 01:40:43,226
Have you ever done this before?

771
01:40:44,644 --> 01:40:46,729
I don't know.

772
01:40:46,938 --> 01:40:48,523
Have you?

773
01:41:02,662 --> 01:41:05,582
I want to with you.

774
01:41:31,149 --> 01:41:34,193
I'm in love with you.

775
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:51,169
I'm in love with you.

776
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,114
Silence.

777
01:42:20,907 --> 01:42:23,284
Silence.

778
01:42:24,702 --> 01:42:27,247
Silence.

779
01:42:28,206 --> 01:42:30,875
There's no band.

780
01:42:31,834 --> 01:42:34,462
There's no band.

781
01:42:35,338 --> 01:42:38,132
There's no orchestra.

782
01:42:39,676 --> 01:42:41,803
Silence!

783
01:42:56,985 --> 01:43:00,029
- Rita?
- There's no band.

784
01:43:00,572 --> 01:43:02,949
Rita, wake up!

785
01:43:06,869 --> 01:43:08,496
It's okay. It's okay.

786
01:43:08,705 --> 01:43:10,707
No, it's not okay.

787
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:14,002
What's wrong?

788
01:43:14,752 --> 01:43:17,463
Go with me somewhere.

789
01:43:18,881 --> 01:43:22,343
It's two o'clock. It's two
o'clock in the morning.

790
01:43:25,972 --> 01:43:29,017
Go with me somewhere.

791
01:43:29,225 --> 01:43:31,227
Sure.

792
01:43:31,436 --> 01:43:32,937
Now?

793
01:43:34,689 --> 01:43:36,649
Right now.

794
01:45:10,868 --> 01:45:13,871
There's no band!

795
01:45:14,747 --> 01:45:17,834
There is no band!

796
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,799
This is all...

797
01:45:25,425 --> 01:45:27,844
a tape recording.

798
01:45:28,052 --> 01:45:31,014
There's no band, and yet...

799
01:45:31,848 --> 01:45:34,350
we hear a band.

800
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:37,979
If we want to hear
a clarinet...

801
01:45:38,521 --> 01:45:40,398
listen...

802
01:45:54,078 --> 01:45:57,248
A muted trombone.

803
01:46:11,304 --> 01:46:15,141
A muted trumpet.

804
01:46:32,784 --> 01:46:35,787
It's all recorded.

805
01:46:38,206 --> 01:46:41,167
There's no band!

806
01:46:42,502 --> 01:46:44,462
It is all...

807
01:46:45,046 --> 01:46:47,423
a tape.

808
01:46:59,852 --> 01:47:04,482
It is an illusion.

809
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:11,114
Listen!

810
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:30,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
let Club Silencio introduce to you...

811
01:48:31,069 --> 01:48:33,821
"La Llorona de Los Angeles".

812
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:37,242
Rebekah del Rio.

813
01:48:56,886 --> 01:49:00,306
I was all right

814
01:49:00,515 --> 01:49:03,601
For a while

815
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:10,316
I could smile for a while

816
01:49:10,525 --> 01:49:13,945
But I saw you last night

817
01:49:14,153 --> 01:49:18,157
You held my hand so tight

818
01:49:18,366 --> 01:49:25,290
As you stopped to say hello

819
01:49:25,707 --> 01:49:30,336
You wished me well and you

820
01:49:30,545 --> 01:49:33,840
Couldn't tell

821
01:49:34,048 --> 01:49:39,721
That I've been crying

822
01:49:39,971 --> 01:49:42,932
Over you

823
01:49:43,141 --> 01:49:46,603
Crying

824
01:49:46,811 --> 01:49:49,397
Over you

825
01:49:49,939 --> 01:49:55,820
Since you said "so long"

826
01:49:56,362 --> 01:50:02,869
I've been miserable and alone

827
01:50:03,286 --> 01:50:07,165
Lonesome and crying

828
01:50:07,707 --> 01:50:10,627
Crying

829
01:50:11,044 --> 01:50:14,380
Crying

830
01:50:14,631 --> 01:50:17,133
Crying

831
01:50:17,342 --> 01:50:24,015
It's hard to understand

832
01:50:24,265 --> 01:50:30,772
That upon seeing you again

833
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:35,235
I'd be crying

834
01:50:35,985 --> 01:50:39,113
I thought

835
01:50:39,322 --> 01:50:42,408
That I was over you

836
01:50:42,617 --> 01:50:49,582
But it's true, so true

837
01:50:49,791 --> 01:50:53,253
I love you even more

838
01:50:53,461 --> 01:50:57,006
Much more than I did before

839
01:50:57,215 --> 01:51:03,096
But darling, what can I do

840
01:51:03,304 --> 01:51:09,143
You don't love me anymore

841
01:51:09,394 --> 01:51:16,317
And I will always be

842
01:51:16,901 --> 01:51:23,491
Crying over you

843
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:29,789
Crying over you

844
01:51:29,998 --> 01:51:36,296
Your love has captured

845
01:51:36,504 --> 01:51:42,302
The whole of my heart

846
01:51:42,552 --> 01:51:46,306
That was left crying

847
01:51:46,514 --> 01:51:49,767
Crying

848
01:51:49,976 --> 01:51:53,146
Crying

849
01:51:53,354 --> 01:51:56,816
Crying

850
01:53:17,522 --> 01:53:19,607
Betty?

851
01:53:22,610 --> 01:53:24,362
Betty?

852
01:53:36,416 --> 01:53:39,252
Where are you?

853
01:56:22,373 --> 01:56:24,208
Hey, pretty girl.

854
01:56:25,168 --> 01:56:27,128
Time to wake up.

855
01:58:04,225 --> 01:58:07,312
- Where have you been?
- What do you want?

856
01:58:07,979 --> 01:58:10,899
My lamp and dishes.

857
01:58:12,734 --> 01:58:15,653
Come on, Diane,
it's been three weeks.

858
01:58:18,031 --> 01:58:21,117
I put your dishes in that box.

859
01:58:41,054 --> 01:58:44,682
- That's my ashtray.
- Take it.

860
01:58:56,486 --> 01:59:00,823
- Anytime.
- I'm just making sure, Diane.

861
01:59:10,208 --> 01:59:12,377
This is it?

862
01:59:17,966 --> 01:59:21,511
By the way, those two detectives
came by again looking for you.

863
02:00:15,481 --> 02:00:17,609
Camilla!

864
02:00:20,194 --> 02:00:22,488
You've come back.

865
02:02:03,923 --> 02:02:06,926
What was that you were saying,
beautiful?

866
02:02:07,468 --> 02:02:09,220
I said...

867
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:12,432
you drive me wild.

868
02:02:24,986 --> 02:02:27,405
We shouldn't do this anymore.

869
02:02:33,786 --> 02:02:36,164
Don't say that.

870
02:02:40,835 --> 02:02:43,755
Don't ever say that.

871
02:02:44,005 --> 02:02:45,882
Don't, Diane!

872
02:02:46,090 --> 02:02:47,550
Stop it!

873
02:02:47,759 --> 02:02:49,427
Diane, stop!

874
02:02:50,595 --> 02:02:53,306
I've tried to tell you this before.

875
02:03:01,814 --> 02:03:04,067
It's him, isn't it?

876
02:03:15,662 --> 02:03:18,957
I'm not trying to show you how
to do the scene, but just...

877
02:03:20,208 --> 02:03:23,253
watch me and I think you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

878
02:03:27,757 --> 02:03:31,052
Don't sit so rigid, just...

879
02:03:31,261 --> 02:03:32,762
just relax.

880
02:03:33,638 --> 02:03:37,767
Now, the two of you are alone
and it's real comfortable.

881
02:03:39,394 --> 02:03:42,063
Like you've known
each other forever.

882
02:03:42,272 --> 02:03:45,567
Even if you don't say anything,
it's real comfortable.

883
02:03:47,277 --> 02:03:50,738
Hank, can you just clear the set?
There's too many people around here.

884
02:03:50,947 --> 02:03:53,866
- Let's get this worked out.
- Clear the set!

885
02:03:54,075 --> 02:03:56,661
Everyone have a cup of coffee.

886
02:03:57,704 --> 02:04:00,957
- Everyone, please!
- Can Diane stay?

887
02:04:01,207 --> 02:04:04,752
Yeah, sure, Diane can stay.
Hank, let Diane stay!

888
02:04:04,961 --> 02:04:06,754
Diane!

889
02:04:12,135 --> 02:04:15,513
Now, when she starts to cry,
don't pull her towards you.

890
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:22,478
Let her fall into you.
Just let her fall.

891
02:04:26,441 --> 02:04:28,526
And when you kiss her...

892
02:04:30,069 --> 02:04:33,072
it's just a continuation
of that move.

893
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:37,535
There's no break.

894
02:05:02,477 --> 02:05:04,687
Kill the lights!

895
02:05:15,073 --> 02:05:17,825
Don't be mad.
Don't make it be like this.

896
02:05:18,034 --> 02:05:21,704
Oh, sure, you want me to make
this easy for you.

897
02:05:21,913 --> 02:05:24,749
No fucking way!
It's not gonna be!

898
02:05:25,541 --> 02:05:28,086
- It's not easy for me!
- Diane!

899
02:06:52,211 --> 02:06:55,465
Hello, it's me.
Leave a message.

900
02:06:58,176 --> 02:06:59,928
Diane?

901
02:07:04,474 --> 02:07:07,393
- Hello?
- Diane?

902
02:07:08,978 --> 02:07:10,396
Camilla.

903
02:07:10,605 --> 02:07:14,484
Diane, the car's waiting.
Are you okay?

904
02:07:15,443 --> 02:07:17,695
You coming?

905
02:07:23,159 --> 02:07:27,455
Good. It means so much to me.

906
02:07:28,164 --> 02:07:31,834
Go on. The car's right
outside your house.

907
02:07:32,252 --> 02:07:35,046
It's been waiting, okay?

908
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:41,135
Okay.

909
02:07:41,344 --> 02:07:45,306
It's 6980, Mulholland Drive.

910
02:07:46,224 --> 02:07:48,434
Mulholland Drive.

911
02:08:57,837 --> 02:09:01,215
What are you doing?
We don't stop here.

912
02:09:06,095 --> 02:09:08,139
A surprise.

913
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:32,914
Shortcut.

914
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:38,002
Come on, sweetheart.

915
02:09:43,341 --> 02:09:45,260
It's beautiful.

916
02:09:45,468 --> 02:09:47,804
A secret path.

917
02:10:55,538 --> 02:10:57,707
Perfect timing.

918
02:10:58,416 --> 02:11:00,543
Welcome, Diane.

919
02:11:06,174 --> 02:11:09,719
Well...
Here's to love.

920
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:23,107
Here's to love.

921
02:11:27,862 --> 02:11:30,031
Here she is!

922
02:11:38,581 --> 02:11:41,459
I don't believe
you met my mother.

923
02:11:42,126 --> 02:11:44,587
Hi. I'm Diane Selwyn.

924
02:11:44,796 --> 02:11:48,466
Just call me Coco, everybody
does. Pleased to meet you.

925
02:11:48,841 --> 02:11:51,761
Well, let's eat!
I'm starving!

926
02:11:58,101 --> 02:12:00,228
I'm sorry I was late.

927
02:12:20,665 --> 02:12:23,293
I'm from Deep River, Ontario.

928
02:12:23,876 --> 02:12:27,630
- A small town.
- So you rolled in here from Canada.

929
02:12:30,508 --> 02:12:33,303
I always wanted to come here.

930
02:12:34,095 --> 02:12:37,265
I won this jitterbug contest.

931
02:12:37,974 --> 02:12:41,144
That sort of led to acting.

932
02:12:41,728 --> 02:12:45,148
You know, wanting to act.

933
02:12:45,857 --> 02:12:48,318
When my aunt died...

934
02:12:49,527 --> 02:12:52,447
Anyway, she left me some money.

935
02:12:53,197 --> 02:12:55,909
- She worked here.
- In the movies?

936
02:12:57,035 --> 02:12:58,411
Yes.

937
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:02,206
How did you meet Camilla?

938
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,837
- On the "Sylvia North Story".
- Camilla was great in that.

939
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:11,007
I never went to
Casablanca with Luigi.

940
02:13:11,215 --> 02:13:13,843
- What a pity!
- Then go!

941
02:13:23,478 --> 02:13:26,397
I wanted the lead so bad.

942
02:13:27,815 --> 02:13:31,236
Anyway, Camilla got the part.

943
02:13:34,364 --> 02:13:36,282
The director...

944
02:13:36,532 --> 02:13:38,451
Bob Rooker?

945
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:40,453
Yes.

946
02:13:42,997 --> 02:13:45,792
He didn't think so much of me.

947
02:13:49,963 --> 02:13:52,840
Anyway, that's when
we became friends.

948
02:13:54,384 --> 02:13:55,969
She helped me...

949
02:13:56,469 --> 02:13:59,597
getting some parts in some
of her films.

950
02:14:01,933 --> 02:14:03,977
I see.

951
02:14:18,825 --> 02:14:22,996
So I got the pool,
and she got the pool man.

952
02:14:25,373 --> 02:14:29,294
I couldn't believe it. I wanted
to buy that judge a Rolls Royce.

953
02:14:35,925 --> 02:14:38,678
Sometimes, good things happen.

954
02:15:32,398 --> 02:15:35,109
So I guess we've saved
the best for last.

955
02:15:38,571 --> 02:15:41,991
- Do you want to tell them?
- No, you tell them.

956
02:15:45,745 --> 02:15:48,164
Camilla and I...

957
02:16:00,301 --> 02:16:02,136
are going to be...

958
02:16:14,732 --> 02:16:16,776
Sorry about that.

959
02:16:24,242 --> 02:16:26,369
No, I'm fine.

960
02:16:32,083 --> 02:16:34,669
This is the girl.

961
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:38,590
Don't show me this
fucking thing here.

962
02:16:39,299 --> 02:16:42,552
It's just an actress' photo
resume. Everybody's got one.

963
02:16:44,178 --> 02:16:46,598
You got the money?

964
02:16:46,806 --> 02:16:48,892
I sure do.

965
02:17:00,111 --> 02:17:03,823
Okay, now, once you hand that over
to me, it's a done deal.

966
02:17:07,243 --> 02:17:09,787
You sure you want this?

967
02:17:14,626 --> 02:17:17,545
More than anything in this world.

968
02:17:28,139 --> 02:17:31,184
When it's finished, you'll find
this where I told you.

969
02:17:44,989 --> 02:17:47,784
What's it open?

970
02:22:12,548 --> 02:22:15,051
Silencio.
