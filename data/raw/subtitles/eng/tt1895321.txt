1
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,695
Great work on the Wharf project, Mary.

2
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,426
The mayor said the restorations
make the whole city proud.

3
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,538
Oh, well thank you Bob. Certainly
had the best team working with me.

4
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,767
That you do, but your leadership's
what's holding it all together.

5
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,604
I just want you to know I appreciate
all the hard work you're doing.

6
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:08,043
No one in this company deserves
a week off more than you.

7
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,581
Whoa! A week? You know I
can't stay away that long.

8
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:13,117
No, I'm just going to the
mountains for the long weekend

9
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,549
but I'll be back to work on Tuesday.

10
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,450
Well, call if you
decide to take more time.

11
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,353
We can't have your battery running
out when we're so close to completion.

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,016
Okay, I will. Have a good one!

13
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,786
Thanks.

14
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,562
Hey!
- Hey!

15
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,064
Need help organizing the files?

16
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,860
All finished.
- They're all yours.

17
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:33,928
Thanks. Will I be able to
reach you if anything comes up?

18
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,906
Uh... when I'm at the lodge,
yes. When I'm hiking, no.

19
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:41,208
So... do you think that
this is THE weekend'?

20
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,406
The weekend?

21
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,247
What?

22
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,546
The weekend Kent pops the big question?

23
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:52,590
Oh, I... I don't know. I mean
we've only been dating for what,

24
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:53,622
a Year?

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,227
Well I can just picture it. Him at the
top of a mountain, down on one knee.

26
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,493
Wouldn't that be so romantic?

27
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:05,226
It would be romantic. But
honestly, proposal or not,

28
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,101
I am just looking forward to
getting to the great outdoors.

29
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,440
Party pooper.

30
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,434
You party your way, I'll party mine.

31
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,777
Have fun with those!
- Will do.

32
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,705
Good morning.
- Mary!

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,501
How good to see you darling.

34
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,611
I thought you and Kent
were in Silver Falls.

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,839
Oh, I'm just on my way to pick him up.

36
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,506
I'm amazed you can get that
boy outside the city limits.

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,485
Dad! He's a lot more
rugged than you think.

38
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,381
Where are the boys?

39
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,457
They're working their own jobs,

40
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,789
we see them every now and
then at the lumber yard.

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,828
You know, I still think they
should be working for you.

42
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,159
There's a reason it says
"and sons" on the truck.

43
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,967
I mean, you taught them
everything they know.

44
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,162
They have a right to try
to make it on their own.

45
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,865
Heck, we didn't see you and your sister
half as much before your grandpa's surgery.

46
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,033
Well' I mean, I have the Wharf project.

47
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,735
We all have something.

48
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,244
No, I just liked it when we
all spent more time together.

49
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,815
Times change, you'll get used to it.

50
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,643
I'm not sure I will.

51
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,047
How's grandpa?

52
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,850
He has his good days and his bad.

53
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,654
More bad than good lately. Listen Mary,

54
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,052
at some point we have to sit down

55
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,595
and make some hard decisions.

56
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,528
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

57
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:47,031
Kathy's up there now with him, I'm sure
they'll both be very happy to see you.

58
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,933
All rig ht. Strong coffee!

59
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,376
We can't keep pretending he's improving.

60
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,116
She knows that in her head,

61
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,380
it's just taking her heart
a little longer to catch up.

62
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,683
Well, she'd better come around soon or
we'll have to make the decision without her.

63
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,588
Well we can make that decision now.

64
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,350
Well...

65
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:14,457
Oh, I see. It's taking your heart a
little time to catch up too. Isn't it?

66
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,194
He's my dad.

67
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,283
Mary!

68
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,649
Grandpa, relax. His blood pressure
always spikes when he sees you.

69
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,383
Is that a bad thing?

70
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,119
He'd be worse off if he didn't see you.

71
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,993
We just all have to accept the fact
that you're the love of his life.

72
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:51,467
Oh... so Grandpa, how you doing today?

73
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,300
I'd be better if your sister
let me out of this room!

74
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:59,138
Now Grandpa, you know I'm not
the one keeping you in here.

75
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,246
Your doctor told you, you need to rest.

76
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,974
It takes a little bit longer to recover
from heart surgery when you're 80.

77
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,314
I'm as strong as an elk! Aren't I Mary?

78
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,185
Oh, you're stronger but you still have
to listen to your doctor and Cathy.

79
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,287
Are you headed to the mountains?

80
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:17,257
Yeah.

81
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,595
Do me a favor?
- Of course! Anything for you.

82
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,998
Take me with you.

83
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,630
Listen, once you get better we will
hike all over our favorite trails.

84
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,933
Bring me back a couple
of pinecones, will you?

85
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,270
The really big ones.

86
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,969
Oh, you know I'm gonna have to try
to pick some up from the general store

87
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,374
from the general store

88
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,209
on the way out, because they don't
let you take them out of the park.

89
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,782
And rightly so.

90
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,651
Every generation should have the
privilege of experiencing the forest

91
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,290
exactly as the good Lord meant it to be.

92
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,790
Listen, when are you
gonna play for me again?

93
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:54,229
When I get outta this room.

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,298
Well...

95
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,835
Kathy! You're gonna be late for
your shift, I'll take over now.

96
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,896
Call me if you need me.
- Okay.

97
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,199
Yeah I guess I should get going too.

98
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:08,370
Say hello to your grandmother for me.

99
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,536
Well you know what,

100
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,013
you keep listening to Cathy and
you can say hello to her yourself.

101
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,185
When will you be back?

102
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,157
Monday night. I'll swing by, okay?

103
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,420
I should really stay and help.

104
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,895
I appreciate the offer, but you
need to take care of yourself.

105
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,660
Thanks Morn.
- Bye bye.

106
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,578
Have a good time.

107
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,550
Leave everything we
talked about back here.

108
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,585
Hey guys!

109
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,779
Didn't expect to see you turncoats here.

110
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,594
Me and Pete are workin' on the same
job, we needed to borrow some tools.

111
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,264
Well, if you worked with
Dad like you're supposed to,

112
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,888
you wouldn't have to borrow anything.

113
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,898
I don't see you sitting
with him in that truck.

114
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm not a contractor anymore,

115
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,731
and if I were, you'd better
believe that I'd be with him.

116
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,572
I heard you and fancy pants
were going up the mountains.

117
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,034
Think he's gonna give you a ring?

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,575
Why is everyone trying to marry me off?

119
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,810
Can't have a spinster in the family.

120
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,585
Last time I checked you
weren't married Pete.

121
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:24,154
Hey Dad, what's the male
equivalent of a spinster?

122
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,578
Pete, I guess.

123
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:29,958
Oh! See you guys.

124
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,333
So, mega jazz festival in New York on
the fourth of July. We'll fly back there,

125
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,345
We'll fly back there, we can
book a couple luxury hotel rooms,

126
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,848
and then we'll hit the scene. You ever
been to Mama? Central Park, Little Italy,

127
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,475
ooh Chinatown... man, I know
restaurants there even locals

128
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,019
can't find with a GPS. We can... Mary?

129
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,420
Mary? Hello! Mary, you're like
in your own little world there.

130
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,458
Sorry Kent.

131
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,528
So what do you say? You up for
a jazz fest in NYC on the fourth?

132
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,659
Uh... I was actually hoping
we could get a couple tents

133
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,461
and come out here for the weekend.

134
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,100
You think you'll ever be able
to make time for the city?

135
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,697
I live in the city!

136
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, but you don't like to go out.

137
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,634
Well... you know, it's been a busy
year. Coming out here is the only thing

138
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,974
between me and total exhaustion.

139
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,515
Well, I feel the same
way about the city.

140
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:28,985
Is it a rift?

141
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:32,956
No, no of course not.

142
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,247
Perfect.

143
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,187
Here's the key to your room. Are
you ready to hit the first trail?

144
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,190
Can't we just hang here
for the first day you know,

145
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,757
limber up by the pool?

146
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,224
Kent, we didn't come here to lounge.

147
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,889
We can hereto get some
sunshine and fresh air. Right?

148
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:15,992
Come on!

149
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,260
Yes.

150
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,190
I was thinking that we could
go to San Diego for Christmas.

151
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,226
My cousin's got this
condo there that we could...

152
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,052
Hey! Whoa, hold up. Can
we, can we take a break?

153
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,699
Sorry Kent.

154
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,926
Look at you, you're like uh...

155
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,405
a mountain lion, you're
hardly breaking a sweat.

156
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,636
Well, I've been coming
out here my whole life.

157
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,576
It just take me a little longer to feel it.
- I don't get it.

158
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,774
It's raining and you're loving it. What
is it about the mountains that grabs you?

159
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,750
I don't know, you know I come out here and
it's like, every trouble just slips away.

160
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,717
Every trouble just slips away. You
know. I never... I never feel more alive.

161
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:20,160
It's not just that though, is
it? This place touches your soul.

162
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,799
One time when I was a
little girl, my grandfather,

163
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,272
he brought me to this beautiful
overlook on the trail up to the falls,

164
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,472
and you could just like,
see for miles. And he said,

165
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:38,310
"Mary, listen to me very
carefully. if you're ever troubled

166
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:42,079
and you need to see God,
this is where you find him.

167
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:47,751
His handy-work is visible on every...
every peak, every valley, every stream,

168
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,192
every meadow, more than
anywhere else in the world."

169
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,991
He said every minute spent out here is
a reminder... what a miracle life is.

170
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,698
What a miracle life is.

171
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,501
He said that he could feel God

172
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,541
and my grandmother smiling
on him, every time we hiked.

173
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,439
Can you feel them now?

174
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,042
I've been talking to them
since we left the lodge.

175
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,010
Well that explains why
I've been talking to myself.

176
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,789
So, can they fix what's troubling you?

177
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:27,058
No... but they're working on it.
My legs are itching to get hiking,

178
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,827
you ready? Come on.

179
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,693
I guess. But can we like,
slow it down a little?

180
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,701
All right'

181
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,362
It's not a race!

182
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,901
Come on. Hup two!

183
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,502
I think I wore the wrong shoes.

184
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,172
You'll be fine.

185
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,745
What's a dog doing down there?

186
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,986
Help! Help me!

187
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,683
There's your answer.

188
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,192
Hello?

189
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,557
Hi. What's your name?

190
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:03,899
Charlene.

191
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,094
Hey Charlene. Are, are you hurt?

192
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,370
Yes! It's my ankle, I twisted it.

193
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,768
Okay honey, just... just
sit tight, all right?

194
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,776
Okay!

195
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,869
Are we' are we gonna go for help?

196
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,610
No, it's too late. There's you know,
there's bears and mountain lions out here.

197
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,947
I'm pretty sure that I
can get her out of here.

198
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,384
Pretty sure or certain?

199
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,779
No, I can do it.

200
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,791
Don't we need like
a... rope or something?

201
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,852
No. I can't hike down
here but I can scramble.

202
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,195
No, look... I'll, I'll go.

203
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,464
No, hey Kent you know what?
It's, it's not the right time

204
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,596
to learn how to scramble. Okay? Hey Charlene,
just hold on I'm coming down to get you!

205
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,263
And Natty?

206
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,966
Yeah! Of course.

207
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,268
Look, if anything goes
wrong, just go back the way

208
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,142
we came and grab help, okay?

209
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,544
I don't feel good about this, Mary.

210
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,713
Kent, I wouldn't do it if I thought
it was too dangerous. All right?

211
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,087
Be careful.
- Okay.

212
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:02,958
Watch it.

213
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,152
Yeah, okay.

214
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,725
Hang on Charlene! Okay!

215
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,509
Got it.

216
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,280
Hi! I'm Mary. I'm Mary Tobin.

217
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,184
So how did you get down here?

218
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,121
Well, Natty chased a
rabbit and got stuck.

219
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,617
I came down to get him.

220
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,625
Ifs okay Natty I needed a bath anyways.

221
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:42,966
Natty!

222
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,529
Where are your parents?

223
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,295
I live with my dad over the ridge.

224
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,036
He'd kill me if he knew
I was out here all alone.

225
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,200
Yeah' he must be, he must be
worried sick about you, huh?

226
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,343
He went into town to get some nails and
stuff, he's probably not even back yet.

227
00:13:55,468 --> 00:14:00,042
He's probably not even back yet.
You're not gonna tell on me, right?

228
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:05,855
No, you know, that's uh...
that's up for you to tell him but,

229
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,891
you just remember that the truth is
always a good place to begin, okay?

230
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,052
Okay.
- Here, let me have a look at your ankle.

231
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,956
Okay, okay. That's okay. All
right, you can't walk out of here.

232
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,833
Do you think you've got enough strength
to climb onto me and I'll bring you up?

233
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:22,636
Yeah.

234
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,038
And Natty's gonna follow us,
all right? One, two, three!

235
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,145
There you go. You're doing awesome!
- Okay.

236
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,343
You're doing so good.
- Okay.

237
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,844
I want you just to hang on to me.

238
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:41,152
Okay, now three, two, one,
and just jump on. There you go.

239
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,423
All right, Kent we're coming up!

240
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,597
All right, you good?
- Yes.

241
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,757
Okay, here we go.

242
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:51,861
Natty come on!

243
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,765
Okay. You okay?

244
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,200
Yeah, how 'bout you?

245
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,041
Gettin' dirtier by the inch!

246
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,584
Okay, you're doing good.

247
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,018
Nice and slow there Mar.

248
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:10,918
Just hang on.

249
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,681
All right, we're almost
there. All right, there we go.

250
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,886
You okay?

251
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,586
All right' three, two, one.

252
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,555
There you go. Okay.

253
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,688
You're doing good. Okay, one
more here. There you go, one more.

254
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:23,767
Three, two!

255
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,599
There. One more time. Three, two...! So!

256
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,765
Give her to me, I got you, I got you!

257
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,900
Charlene, this is my boyfriend Kent.

258
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,141
Natty?

259
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,146
We need to get her to a doctor.

260
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,740
No, I think that uh... I think
we should get her home. Yeah?

261
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,874
Well where's that?

262
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:46,480
Just up over the ridge. You... do you
feel up to giving her a piggy-back?

263
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,955
Yeah, sure uh...
- Okay.

264
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,457
Okay. Okay, hang on a second.

265
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,726
Okay, climb up.

266
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,626
All right, you ready everybody?
There you go, there you go.

267
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,425
You good?

268
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,898
Yeah! You guys okay?

269
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,825
Yeah.
- All right'

270
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,764
Hang on.

271
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,102
You okay?
- Yeah.

272
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,163
Natty come here!

273
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,971
Natty!

274
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:10,676
All right'

275
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:12,948
Hang on.

276
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,786
Watch your head here.

277
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:22,785
All right'

278
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,153
Let's duck down.

279
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:25,921
Okay.

280
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,128
Oh wow, would you...would
you look at that?

281
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,601
What?

282
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,869
That's Christmas Lodge.

283
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,701
What, that old wreck?

284
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,969
Hey! That's not an old
wreck, that's my house!

285
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,442
Sorry.

286
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,312
You live at Christmas Lodge?

287
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,175
Yup.

288
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,308
Lucky you!

289
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,849
What do you know about it?

290
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,345
When I was little, this was
like our home away from home.

291
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,722
Wait a second, is your dad Jack Rand?

292
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:55,848
Well, yeah!

293
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,862
I haven't seen him since
I was half your age.

294
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,125
I can't wait to check out the lodge!

295
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,364
Is that your dad?

296
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,569
Yup. You promise you won't tell on me?

297
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,237
No, I promise to let you tell.

298
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,544
Charlene? You hurt?

299
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,712
My ankle, I twisted it.

300
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,557
Hi, who are you?

301
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,593
Sorry. Uh, this is my friend
Kent and I'm Mary Tobin.

302
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,560
We found Charlene and we thought
that we'd bring her back here.

303
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,332
I was getting the mail.

304
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,098
You were getting the mail?

305
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,234
So you twisted your ankle
somewhere between here and the road'?

306
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,933
Well...

307
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,341
You didn't go hiking alone
in the park again, did you?

308
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,004
Charlene?

309
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,507
We will talk later.

310
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,184
You said Mary Tobin?

311
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,618
That name sounds awfully familiar.

312
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,783
You're not Mike and Betty
Tobin's daughter, are you?

313
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,019
One and the same!

314
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,427
Good Lord! I haven't seen you
since, what, we were this high?

315
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,198
How's your family doing?

316
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,792
Oh, you know, they're
great! Mostly... yeah.

317
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:16,199
Please, come inside! I'll
make you something to eat.

318
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,899
We can, we can catch up.

319
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,032
Food, yes! Now we're talking.

320
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,634
Please, um... come inside.

321
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,541
Come on Natty!

322
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,752
I'm hungry.

323
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,393
Well, welcome back to Christmas Lodge.

324
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,299
It's probably not exactly
how you remember it, is it?

325
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,497
Not exactly, but I can
picture it the way it was

326
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,903
when I was a kid.

327
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,068
How was it?

328
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,844
Magical.

329
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,073
Magical! This place...

330
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,584
Please, you guys just make yourselves
at home while I tend to Charlene.

331
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,088
Daddy, it really hurts.
- I know, sweetheart.

332
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,921
I just gotta get it elevated
until I can get some ice on it.

333
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,627
Oww, Daddy.

334
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,107
This place has a rare charm.

335
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,606
It takes a special eye to see it.

336
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,147
Yeah, you can say that again.

337
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,615
Cut it out!

338
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,810
Just joking.

339
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,456
Jackson F. Huntington, right?
- Yeah, how did you know that?

340
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,959
I'm a historic preservationist.

341
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,724
I mean, I work in the city but
lire read up on all his lodges.

342
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,460
The way that the
exposed beams are fixed,

343
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,364
it has Huntington written all over it.

344
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,298
What does that mean?

345
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,734
It's like the lodge is a living
thing, you know, the structures,

346
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,842
they use gravity to support itself.

347
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,478
I bet not a single nail up there, right?

348
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,346
I am impressed! Yup, Huntington
drew up the plans in uh...

349
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:08,509
my great grandfather
built it in the 1920's.

350
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,144
How long did you and your
uh, family come up here for?

351
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,850
Up until I was probably 5 or 6.

352
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,689
My grandpa and my grandma,

353
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:18,762
they used to bring the whole
family up here for Christmas.

354
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,595
And then after she died, well grandpa,
he couldn't bear to come up here

355
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,364
so we stayed at the lodge
in the national park.

356
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,737
To keep grandpa from
getting upset we just,

357
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,776
we just stopped talking about it.

358
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,382
You know, I always wondered
what happened to Christmas Lodge.

359
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,518
Well I'm glad you found us again.

360
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,718
Why don't you guys just
make yourselves at home

361
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,450
and I'll uh, get us something to eat.

362
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,391
Jack, that meal was excellent.

363
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,903
So good! Who taught you how to cook?

364
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,872
Three generations of my family.
Heck a couple dozen guests

365
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,776
taught me a trick or two. See we uh,

366
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:12,213
I didn't know how to do
everything around here

367
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,875
just to keep this old girl up and
running. I have a little something

368
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:19,582
I think you're gonna
want to take a look at.

369
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,089
Thanks.

370
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,794
Oh, wow!

371
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,396
Who are all these people?

372
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,936
Those are our guests. See
my great grandparents started

373
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:37,065
this tradition of taking holiday photos
of every family whoever stayed here.

374
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,241
And uh, when Charlene and I finally
get this place up and running,

375
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,835
we're gonna start another album.

376
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,010
Ahh! Oh wow.
- What?

377
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,019
That's... that's us.

378
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,646
What? Which one's you?

379
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,315
Are you kidding me? Right there!

380
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,483
Oh! Nice snorkel jacket.

381
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,521
Jack, these photos are priceless!

382
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,464
So when do you think that the
uh, renovation will be complete?

383
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,498
Oh, you know that is a
question I've been asking

384
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,834
for years now.

385
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,943
What uh, what's set you back'?

386
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,508
Well my mom and dad
they had an accident.

387
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,044
A logging truck hit a patch of black
ice and crossed over the centre line.

388
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,856
So Charlene and I, we uh,
rented a place in the city

389
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:30,018
near the hospitals, hoping
they would get better.

390
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,823
But uh, sometimes the
Lord has other plans.

391
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,464
Anyway, when we were gone,
nature kind of took over up here.

392
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:42,835
Well, we've been struggling
to catch up ever since.

393
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,805
Jack, I'm so sorry to hear that.

394
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:46,073
It's all right.

395
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,573
I mean, don't you have
somebody helping you?

396
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,841
No, supplies are kind of expensive and
I can't afford to hire any extra help.

397
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,349
To hire any extra help.

398
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,052
More hands is the only way we're
gonna get ahead of nature up here.

399
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,521
Well, have you thought
of applying for funding

400
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,216
to help cover the expenses?

401
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,149
Apply to who?

402
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,025
Your lodge with its long and
illustrious history, I mean.

403
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,430
I'm sure ifs eligible
for private grant money

404
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,592
you could use to hire contractors.

405
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,865
I don't know about that.

406
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,241
Are you willing to try?

407
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:26,377
Christmas Lodge is my life.
I'll do anything to save her.

408
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,412
Great! Well I'll... I'll
research some suitable programs

409
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,579
when I get back to the city
and I'll give you a call.

410
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,079
Thank you.

411
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:37,456
Well that was some meal but I am beat,

412
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,119
I guess it's time we
should be heading back.

413
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,252
Yeah' I'll give you a lift.

414
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,128
Count me in, my dogs are
howlin' from that hike!

415
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,401
Your dogs?
- They say that.

416
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,698
No they don't.
- It was along hike.

417
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,138
Back in a little bit honey.
- Take care Charlene!

418
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,940
Bye!
- Bye!

419
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,610
All right, hey! Nice, I've got a signal.

420
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,750
Well, thank you for everything Jack.

421
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,290
Oh please, it's the least I could
do after you helped Charlene.

422
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,930
You're not going to be
too hard on her are you?

423
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,265
No, no she's a good kid.

424
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,796
I know it can't be easy living up there
with just me and Natty to play with.

425
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:24,733
Anyways,

426
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,674
I'll be in touch with you next week!

427
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,838
Okay. Oh, wait, wait, wait
I've got something for you.

428
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:43,115
Oh! Oh, Jack! I can't take these,

429
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,422
these, they belong to Christmas
Lodge. This is a part of your heritage.

430
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,759
No that is a part of our heritage.

431
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,764
See, my great grandparents
always said that anyone

432
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,132
who stays at the lodge
is family for life.

433
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,295
Sounds creepy, but it's not.

434
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,506
You know what, I'm
gonna have copies made

435
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,836
and I'll bring you back the originals.

436
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,844
Okay. I will look forward
to seeing you again.

437
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:08,615
I'll look forward to seeing you
too and Charlene, and the lodge.

438
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,617
I hope I can help you
get it back on track.

439
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,485
Thank you.

440
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,153
Okay.

441
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:18,957
Take care!

442
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,799
You all set?

443
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,360
So do you really think you can help him

444
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,371
bring that old heap back from the brink?

445
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,169
Well, I'm sure gonna try. You
know, my grandfather, he taught me

446
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,839
not to turn your back on your own
history. And Christmas Lodge is a valuable

447
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:42,077
part of my past, and I owe it to
my family to make sure it's around

448
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,245
for generations to come.

449
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,990
Well, it's a noble mission.

450
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,025
And a labor of love.

451
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,993
Because I've always wanted
to work on an old lodge.

452
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,087
Yeah?

453
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,506
Yeah. Oh, hey Dad!

454
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,373
How was your trip?

455
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,846
The best.

456
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,544
Kent propose?

457
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,781
Would you be happy if he did?

458
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,223
Yeah, that's what I thought.

459
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,893
I don't dislike the boy, Mary.
He's just a little too city for me.

460
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,295
Well, don't worry about it,
you won't have to live with him.

461
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,233
Here, look at this.

462
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:40,541
Christmas Lodge? I haven't
thought about this place in years.

463
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,135
Where'd you find this?

464
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,645
Well, Kent and I, we
rescued Jack Rand's daughter

465
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,807
and brought her back to
the lodge, and Jack...

466
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,442
he was, he was nice
enough to pass these along.

467
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:53,216
Jack Rand...you mean little Jackie?

468
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,918
Yeah, well little Jackie,
he's not so little anymore.

469
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:57,754
He's bigger than Pete.

470
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:00,955
He was a good kid, always helping
his parents around the place.

471
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:02,463
How are they?

472
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:07,328
They died because of a car
accident a few years ago.

473
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:13,466
Oh no- Oh, I'm sorry to hear
that. They were good people,

474
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,243
fine people. Jack doing a good business?

475
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:20,647
Actually, no... and
that's where you come in.

476
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:21,649
Me?

477
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,984
Yes, you. You see, the lodge it...
it went into disrepair when Jack

478
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,455
was in the city taking
care of his parents.

479
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,618
I mean, he's trying hard to
get it back on track but...

480
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,492
it's pretty obvious that
the elements are winning.

481
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:38,432
So, I told him I would see if
there's grant money available

482
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,596
to help him, but in the meantime,

483
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,536
I want you and the boys to
inspect the lodge top to bottom

484
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,006
and get an estimate of how
much it would cost to renovate.

485
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,980
I can tell you right
now, a lodge this size...

486
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,605
half a million dollars
wouldn't even cover the kitchen.

487
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,977
Seriously?

488
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,312
You coordinate restoration projects.

489
00:27:56,441 --> 00:28:00,947
You know as well as I do, an old
building can easily become a money pit.

490
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,787
No, Dad I'm used to dealing
with old city structures

491
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,020
that are very complex.

492
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,063
I mean, I didn't think that
a lodge would cost that much!

493
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:11,532
Well, it might cost more, I'm sure
the roof, the windows, electrical,

494
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,500
plumbing systems are
due for an overhaul.

495
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,364
We're talking big money,
kiddo. Big, big money.

496
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,906
So what should I do?

497
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,543
Keep the memories and let the lodge go.

498
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:23,670
That's not what Grandpa would say.

499
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,908
No, and sentimental projects like that
one cost him a lot of time and money

500
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,076
and money and still didn't
make it to completion.

501
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,221
You're taking this awful personally.

502
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,497
You know, I just...l thought it'd
be nice to get the whole family,

503
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:46,093
even Grandpa, back up there for
another old-fashioned family Christmas.

504
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:51,269
I thought it would
bring us closer together.

505
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:58,842
Look at this photo we seemed so happy.

506
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,848
We were Mary, we were.

507
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,380
No denying it, just... time marches on.

508
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:06,918
Yeah.

509
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,058
Where's Mom?
- Upstairs, tending Grandpa.

510
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,106
My body to be burned, and have not
charity. It profiteth me nothing.

511
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,234
Come in!

512
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,310
Hi.

513
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,540
You said you'd come! Here you are.

514
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,140
How was Silver Falls?

515
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:39,450
Oh, it was wonderful.
And I brought you this!

516
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,488
It's like being there.

517
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,566
Did you go to all our favorite places?

518
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,298
Yup! And I have something to show you.

519
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,334
If you can get his glasses.

520
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:11,415
Christmas Lodge! I remember
it like it was yesterday.

521
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,515
Yeah!

522
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:17,354
I remember it like it was yesterday.

523
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,659
Look at your grandmother,

524
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:25,435
she's as pretty as
the day I married her.

525
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,134
I miss her.

526
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,644
Did you tell her I said hello?

527
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,642
Of course.

528
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,339
And what did she say?

529
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,209
Well, she said to give you
that photo as a reminder

530
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,377
of how much she loves you.

531
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,515
Where did you get that?

532
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:49,524
We were hiking, Kent and I, and
we just stumbled onto the lodge.

533
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:55,189
You didn't stumble on anything!
Mavis wanted you to go there.

534
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,962
She's strong willed you know.

535
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,965
She sent you there for a reason.

536
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,238
What reason Grandpa?

537
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,573
Time will tell.

538
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,547
Betty.

539
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:17,415
Could you get that box
from out of that basket?

540
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,491
Oh, this is beautiful.

541
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,187
I made it myself.

542
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,896
The timber comes from a
beam I replaced at the lodge.

543
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,162
Can I open it?

544
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,371
Wow. Grandpa these photos are priceless,
how come you haven't shown them to me before?

545
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,915
Who's that right there?

546
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,589
That's me and your grandmother!

547
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,751
You knew Grandma when you were kids?

548
00:31:57,849 --> 00:31:59,954
I met her and her family at the lodge.

549
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,525
Really?

550
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:08,697
Our families became fast friends.
I knew she was gonna be my girl

551
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:12,139
the first time I laid eyes on her.

552
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,641
She's so beautiful.

553
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,373
That's an understatement.
Beauty's only half the story.

554
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:27,052
No one could sled, or
skate or make a snowman

555
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,886
like your grandmother.

556
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:38,458
And in the summer, she could climb the
steepest rock-face like a mountain goat.

557
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,396
And she stared down all manner
of mountain lions and bears

558
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:48,740
until they ran off
crying like little babies.

559
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:55,946
You remind me of her, always have.

560
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,988
Nothing stops either of you.

561
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,433
What is this one right here?

562
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:21,941
The Rands let me and
Mavis run the kitchen,

563
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,874
Really?
- And we had a fine time of it.

564
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:30,775
At Christmas time, we
made the biggest feast

565
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,288
this side of Kansas City.

566
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:38,822
Oh, Mavis knew exactly what to do.

567
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,855
I was her apprentice.

568
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:49,670
We worked like clockwork together and...

569
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,504
That time you and Grandma
took Cathy and I to the picnic,

570
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:55,907
I was such a brat!

571
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,818
Betty? When did you leave?
- 1963.

572
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,387
Mary, it's getting late.

573
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,389
Yeah. Okay Grandpa.

574
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:14,259
Thank you for reminding
me how joyous life can be.

575
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,832
The life that you have led
at Christmas Lodge, I...

576
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,768
What I wouldn't give for
another Christmas up there.

577
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,533
I'll be here any time
you want to open this box

578
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,168
and go back with me.

579
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,236
Promise?
- Promise.

580
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,111
Love you Grandpa.

581
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,350
Love you too kid.

582
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:49,029
Hey! You look like a woman on a mission.

583
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,259
I am. Listen, what are
you doing this weekend?

584
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,633
Oh, the usual glamour stuff, cleaning
gutters and mulching trees. Why?

585
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,105
What do you say about
a trip to the mountains?

586
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:02,075
Oh, no, no- I thought we settled
this Christmas Lodge issue.

587
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,237
Okay, we did. But Grandpa,
he just set me straight.

588
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,282
I'm not just gonna sit
around and watch it collapse.

589
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,442
There's too much of us in it,

590
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,451
and Jack...he deserves to
continue his family's legacy.

591
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,714
What about the cost?

592
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,779
Don't worry about the cost,
I will take care of the cost.

593
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,483
You just tell the boys
that we are going on a trip.

594
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,060
Oh, and if they don't wanna go?

595
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,427
Well then you remind them that you're
their father, and their boss. Okay?

596
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,796
Good night.

597
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,640
I do not know how you
manage all those people.

598
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:36,906
The carpenters, the plumbers, the
electricians, the drywall crew,

599
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:41,940
the city inspectors. The phone
rang' and rang, and rang, and rang!

600
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:45,318
Good morning! But you
kept it all in order?

601
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,152
Well, of course. But I didn't like it.

602
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,656
It gets easier with practice.

603
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,193
So, where is it?

604
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,694
Oh, no... Kent did not propose.

605
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,461
You mean I did all that
filling in for you for nothing?

606
00:35:56,588 --> 00:36:01,162
No! The trip, it was
fulfilling in an unexpected way.

607
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,002
Oh, Bob! Hi.

608
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,166
Yolanda! You did a great
job covering for Mary.

609
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,676
Everyone down at the Wharf
said you gave them everything

610
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,304
they needed to get their job done.

611
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,881
All I heard was grumbling.

612
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,884
That means they like you!
Keep up the good work.

613
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,946
Will do. I'll talk lo you later.

614
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,815
Yeah.

615
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,148
Did you recharge your batteries?

616
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,386
Oh, the mountains, they
always deliver. Listen Bob,

617
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,191
what do you know about grants
for renovating old lodges?

618
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,890
All my work's been in the
city but I would imagine

619
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,026
the basics are the same. Why?

620
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,479
Dad, can you get the phone?

621
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,183
I got it! It's been so long
since we got a call I thought

622
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,586
the phone was broken.
Hello! Christmas Lodge.

623
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,157
Jack! Hi, it's Mary. Mary Tobin.

624
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,150
Hello Mary Tobin.

625
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,389
Hey! Uh... listen, how's Charlene?

626
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,532
Uh... she's a trooper, she's um,
helping me fix a window as we speak.

627
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:10,270
Wow! She'll be a master
contractor one day.

628
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,898
Listen, I'm calling with good news.

629
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,237
Good news.

630
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,873
Wow' I haven't heard those two
words strung together in a long time.

631
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,915
Well, get ready. I told
my boss about the lodge,

632
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,282
and he is gonna ask the board
for a grant to reopen it.

633
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,082
And that's not all, my...

634
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,522
my father and my brothers,
they're licensed contractors

635
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,857
and they'd love to come by and take a
look at the lodge, and get an estimate

636
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:37,457
for the cost of your grant
application. So what do you think?

637
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,899
I... I don't know what to think.

638
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,641
Oh, you know... um, I didn't
mean to create a problem for you.

639
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:53,046
No, it's not a problem it's just that...well,
it's just that um, me and my family have always

640
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:58,782
looked after the lodge ourselves.
It's uh, it's a pretty big step for me.

641
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,083
Of course, I completely understand

642
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,123
and I want you to know that
we're here to advise you,

643
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,091
not to take over.

644
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,754
Nothing will be done
without your permission.

645
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:09,156
Thank you Mary.

646
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,825
Great! Um... I'll see you, Saturday?

647
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,130
Saturday it is.

648
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:15,636
Take care.

649
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,241
What did Mary say?

650
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:28,974
Uh, she said that she's
gonna come up with her family

651
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,587
and help fix up the lodge.

652
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:35,317
Really? You know, Grandma always said

653
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:40,259
that the Lord was looking out for
Christmas Lodge. You think she sent them?

654
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:45,167
Maybe. Maybe Charlene.

655
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,196
So um, how did, how did
Jack respond to your plan?

656
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,535
Well, mountain men,
they're pretty stubborn

657
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,702
but they are practical to
a fault, so he said yes!

658
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,841
So' when do you go back up there?

659
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,517
First thing tomorrow morning. You
know what, why don't you come along?

660
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:08,886
Kent.

661
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,860
Look Mary, you remember when I told you

662
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,488
it wasn't a rift? You like
the mountains and I like city?

663
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,626
Yeah.

664
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:23,665
I think I was wrong. I
can't go on pretending

665
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,866
I'm not cut out for that lifestyle.

666
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,034
I like to be in the middle of things

667
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,077
and you're happier as far
away from here as you can get.

668
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,306
And I don't think either one
of us should go on pretending.

669
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,843
Are you breaking up with me?

670
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:45,656
Oh, wow. I'm afraid so. Look,
I'd still like to be friends,

671
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,525
when you come back to the city.

672
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:52,034
You know what, okay... I'll um, I'll
try to spend some more time here and...

673
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:57,435
You'd, you'd be miserable and... I just
don't think that's good for either of us.

674
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,598
I should go.

675
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,872
Isn't there any way
we could work this out?

676
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,076
We're just... we're on
different trails, Mary.

677
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,752
Different trails that don't
go to the same destination.

678
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,389
But...

679
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:16,457
I'm, I'm sorry.

680
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:31,063
Because you're a smart, intelligent,
beautiful, adventurous woman

681
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,402
and you won't settle
for less in a partner.

682
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:38,207
Mom, Kent... he was, he was
smart, and he was handsome...

683
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,379
But he wasn't adventurous.

684
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:47,079
It took a lot of strength for
him to recognize the truth,

685
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,126
that you were holding each other back
from the life you were meant to lead.

686
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:55,095
But, Mom... I would... I
would've changed for him.

687
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,960
You know that pretending
to be something you're not

688
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,795
wouldn't be good for either of you.

689
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,440
So what do I do now?

690
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,342
Be truthful. Be truthful to
yourself and to the world,

691
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,970
and you'll find the
man who's right for you.

692
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,608
Okay' what if he doesn't show up?

693
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,651
Mom, cuz I'm really
tired of living alone.

694
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:21,087
Have faith! Have faith Mary,
and the Lord will provide.

695
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,457
Hey' is that Mary?

696
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,629
Go see for yourself.

697
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,002
And she brought the army.

698
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,476
Whoa, this takes me back.

699
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,443
You still remember coming here?

700
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,812
I can already see the lodge
is gonna need a lot of work

701
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,614
to bring it back to the way
I remember it. A lot of work.

702
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,780
Well, that's why we're here.

703
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,124
Mary! Mary!

704
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,290
Whoa, you are a fast healer!

705
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,560
Yeah, nothing that a little
Epsom salt couldn't fix.

706
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,330
That's what Dad always said.
He'd use it on a cracked skull.

707
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:12,468
It's true! Uh, Jack Rand, you
remember my dad Mike Tobin.

708
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,066
And this is Charlene.

709
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,075
Hi. Little Jackie.

710
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,807
Oh, I haven't been
called that in years sir.

711
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,511
It's a compliment! I remember
you as a kid, lugging suitcases

712
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,847
twice your size up those steps

713
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,355
without breaking a sweat. Big
Jackie used to say there wasn't a man

714
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,651
in these mountains that
couldn't out-haul your dad.

715
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,887
I think he just said
that to keep me moving.

716
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:35,391
Jack this is my brother Matthew.
- Hi.

717
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,424
And Charlene, Matthew. And
this is my other brother Pete.

718
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:41,561
Thanks for coming up
here. Well, here she is.

719
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,769
I was gonna fix her up myself but
uh, last couple of years the blizzards

720
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,707
have been pretty hard on her,
not even close to catching up.

721
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,542
Can't be all that
bad, let's take a look.

722
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,581
Okay, well we have good news
Matthew, the gutters are okay.

723
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,415
Okay.
- How do the windows look?

724
00:43:32,477 --> 00:43:34,150
Uh... this one's gotta go too.

725
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:35,990
Okay.

726
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:11,285
Oh my goodness. This
place is a time machine.

727
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:16,158
I can still see the family
sitting at this table,

728
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:20,861
with Grandpa here at the
head, Grandma at the other end

729
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,871
and you kids, as little as
chipmunks sitting in the middle.

730
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,105
Biggest chipmunk.

731
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,110
And Jack, man could your family cook.

732
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:31,272
And Jack is continuing on the tradition!

733
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,042
Uh, yeah... I'll never be quite as
good as my grandmother was but uh,

734
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,515
I will put my best in the dinner.

735
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,881
Oh, no don't go to any bother, son.

736
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,818
Mother packed provisions in the cooler.

737
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:43,053
Well I appreciate that sir, but
you've gotta let me make one meal,

738
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,854
that's the least I could do.

739
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,693
Do you know how to make
those sourdough biscuits

740
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,320
that your grandmother used to make?

741
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,024
You know, I might just
happen to have a batch ready

742
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:53,500
to go in the oven as we speak.

743
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,064
Well then, I think we might
have time for a bite or two!

744
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,564
I still remember these biscuits.

745
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,075
They tasted like... Christmas.

746
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,306
What does that mean?

747
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,247
Pete my boy, there are some
things that can't be explained.

748
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,009
You just have to taste
them for yourself.

749
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:33,741
Who's that?

750
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,840
That's my grandpa.

751
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,104
So, is that your grandma?

752
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,248
She's in heaven, right?

753
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:41,610
Yeah, she is.

754
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:46,282
Can you bring your
grandpa next time you come?

755
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,518
You wanna see him?

756
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:53,692
Well, ifs just that-.-
I miss my grandpa.

757
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,957
Yeah.

758
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:57,563
I'll tell you what,

759
00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:58,896
I'll see what I can do.

760
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,198
Mary.
- Yeah'?

761
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,138
Can I speak to you?
- Sure. I'll be back.

762
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,111
What's up?

763
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,474
You know, ifs not fair to
that little girl to promise

764
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,484
her something that
isn't going to happen.

765
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,112
Dad, how do you know it isn't?

766
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,453
My father is a very sick man.

767
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:27,255
Grandpa, he's the strongest
man alive. He'll rally.

768
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,920
That's about as likely as
this lodge fixing itself.

769
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,900
Time takes it's toll Mary,

770
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:34,730
we have to learn to accept it.

771
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,271
You know, Grandpa,
he taught me to fight,

772
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:38,931
and I'm not giving up on him.

773
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,441
I'm not giving up either,

774
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,771
I'm just trying to get you
to accept the inevitable.

775
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,346
No, Dad. I don't wanna talk about it.

776
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:50,151
That's okay. Just promise me

777
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,276
you won't get that
little girl's hopes up.

778
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,520
I promise.

779
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,999
Dinner is served.
- Wow, here... can I help you?

780
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,125
Yeah.

781
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,298
Before we begin sir, I'd be honored

782
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:12,102
if you would lead us in Grace.

783
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:20,878
Dear Lord, we thank you for the
blessing of your divine love,

784
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,713
and the love of family and friends.

785
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,449
And we thank you for the blessing
of this visit to Christmas Lodge.

786
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,619
May it be a place that always
feels like home to all of us. Amen.

787
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,227
Amen.

788
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:35,854
Amen.

789
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:39,126
Now, pass the biscuits boy
and take one for yourself.

790
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,896
Don't be shy, dig in!

791
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,629
Thanks Dad.

792
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,498
Am I right?

793
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,237
Yeah, like Christmas!

794
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,576
What's your secret ingredient?

795
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,546
To be honest, we've
never been quite sure.

796
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,743
It's either the um... pure
mountain water or the uh,

797
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:02,316
very well seasoned stove that's been baking
them just right for a very, very long time.

798
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,325
Take that old stove off
the replacement list!

799
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,359
I don't know, I don't think it
has anything to do with the water,

800
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,927
or the stove, I... I think that Christmas
Lodge has a heart of ifs own heart

801
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,505
and it just wants people to be happy.

802
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:19,568
I like that.

803
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,540
Me too.

804
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,111
Thank you.

805
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,611
I still can't believe
you're doing all this for us.

806
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:36,448
Well, my grandparents
and my parents taught us

807
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,355
that you don't turn your
back on people that need help.

808
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,895
And I'm sure that your
folks taught you the same.

809
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:44,363
Oh, they did. But still, it couldn't have
been easy mobilizing your whole family.

810
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,632
They love the challenge.

811
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,703
Plus, they've never
worked on a historic lodge.

812
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,240
I mean, you saw how excited they were

813
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,969
when they checked under the hood.

814
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,942
I think they found more wrong
than I ever could've guessed.

815
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,812
You know, we had an old saying
in historic preservation.

816
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,577
What is it?

817
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,156
Find the problem is the
first step in fixing it.

818
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,388
I like that saying.

819
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:17,730
So um, what did Kent think
about you coming up here?

820
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:23,164
Uh, Kent and I, we're
not dating anymore.

821
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,301
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

822
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,113
So what about you? Does
Mrs. Rand work in the city?

823
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:39,178
Uh, no. Mrs. Rand passed away
shortly after Charlene was born.

824
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,351
I'm sorry to hear that.

825
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,518
No, it's all right. I firmly
believe she's with the Lord.

826
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:51,629
You know to be honest, I'm
not sure she liked it up here.

827
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,696
This place can be
really hard on city folk.

828
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,872
You gotta really love the
outdoors to live here year round.

829
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,997
Oh, I know.

830
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,667
You still come up here in the winter?

831
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:05,808
Especially the winter! I
mean, it's so beautiful...

832
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:11,318
the snow, the quiet. You
know, I savor the quiet.

833
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,480
Sometimes I snowshoe into
the middle of the park

834
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:17,355
just to have a legal reason
not to hear a cell phone.

835
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,292
Well we're so remote you don't
even get a cell phone signal.

836
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,059
Even the landline is spotty.

837
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,895
Bliss! I'll have to tell my
dad not to fix that either.

838
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,698
I uh... got the details worked out.

839
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,807
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

840
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:39,713
Just remember, the
report is the first step.

841
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,907
And we'll help you with the rest.

842
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:42,915
Thank you.

843
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,047
So, what's, what's the damage?

844
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:56,154
Well, the good news is the major
structure is largely intact.

845
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,529
They knew what they were
doing when they used cedar

846
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:02,661
to build this place, it's stronger
than concrete in these conditions.

847
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,900
Now, with a little
patching, the uh, roof

848
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:10,035
and the walls can be brought up to
code. The trusses and the support

849
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:13,944
beams are in good shape too,
and the foundation is flawless.

850
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,745
Okay. So, we're all set then!

851
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:21,213
Uh, not quite! The uh,
electrical, plumbing

852
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,189
and healing systems are
old and beginning to fail.

853
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,420
Your kitchen is worn to
the point of posing hazard.

854
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,899
Now, an awful lot of your windows
are cracked from the storms,

855
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,566
your gutters and some of the
decorative features have dry rot

856
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,229
and some of your floorboards
will have lo be replaced.

857
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,431
Is that all?

858
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:42,066
Uh... once your repairs are
completed, you're gonna have to

859
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,645
repaint the exterior and refinish
the interior, and that has to be done

860
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,806
in a way that preserves the
historical character of the lodge.

861
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,249
So what's the bottom line?

862
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,312
In drawing up the
estimate, we try to find

863
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,424
the most cost effective solutions.

864
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:56,752
And...

865
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,985
$1.8 to $2 million.

866
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,898
Ha!!!!!! Wow. I don't
have that kinda money.

867
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:06,229
Don't worry cuz that's,
that's where I come in.

868
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,429
Now all these documents are necessary

869
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,301
to apply to my company's
board for funding.

870
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,434
Now, my boss and I, we're
gonna have to push hard

871
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,306
to get them to take on a
project outside of the city,

872
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,639
but I really feel like
they will come around

873
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,646
when they realize the
history that's gonna be saved

874
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,478
in renovating Christmas Lodge.

875
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,315
That's a lot of paper.

876
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,649
It is, but don't worry, I'll go through
it with you tomorrow page by page,

877
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:29,815
while Dad and they boys
work to stabilize the lodge.

878
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,622
So what do you say?

879
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,820
Now, if we do this, is there a chance

880
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,263
that we could be open by Christmas?

881
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,932
Well, where there's a
will there's a way, right?

882
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,870
Let's do it.
- Great!

883
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:49,774
Well, I don't know about you kids,

884
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,679
but these old bones need
a rest. Good night, Jack.

885
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,879
Good night Dad.
- Good night Jack.

886
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,881
Good night Mary.

887
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:01,616
Good night everyone.

888
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,736
So, what's the plan for today?

889
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:19,207
Well, I looked over the list of
repairs and circled the problem areas

890
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,366
that are posing an immediate threat

891
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:24,536
or any damage to the exterior
that's letting the weather in.

892
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,477
I'll make some temporary
fixes to stabilize the lodge

893
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,175
so it won't get any worse

894
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,650
by the time the contractors
you hired get up here.

895
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:31,912
I appreciate it.

896
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,081
Morning.

897
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,748
Morning!
- How'd you sleep?

898
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,257
Great!

899
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,157
She kept you up talking, didn't she?

900
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,823
Uh, that's kind of the whole point
of a slumber party, right Charlene?

901
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:44,865
Yeah.

902
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:47,897
Well, we'd better get started on the
paperwork, it's gonna take a couple hours.

903
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,494
Yup. Been warming up all morning.

904
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,730
Well we should get at it.

905
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,412
Last one!

906
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:11,526
My hand is less sore from
swinging an axe all day.

907
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,395
Not bad for $2 million.

908
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,723
No, it's not bad at all.

909
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,642
I can't tell you how great
it was having you all up here.

910
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,206
When you think you're gonna
make it back this way again?

911
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,283
Oh, you know what? I come up
camping all the time in the summer.

912
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,314
I'll be sure to swing by next time.

913
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,887
Oh, can you take me with you?

914
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:40,978
Charlene!

915
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,316
Of course. If it's okay with your dad.

916
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:49,762
Oh yeah, it's okay with her dad. With all this
work around here I don't get out on the trail

917
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:53,801
as much as I'd like to. Yeah,
Charlene probably deserves a break.

918
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,964
Well' all right then. I'll call you.

919
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,340
You don't need to, family
can drop by any time.

920
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,904
Oh, thank you. All
right, you two take care.

921
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:14,349
You like Mary, don't you?

922
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:18,119
What? Where do you
come up with this stuff?

923
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:22,492
Come on! She's likes you too.

924
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,298
What did she tell you?

925
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:33,867
No, but I can tell. I like
Mary, Dad. I like her a lot.

926
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,854
Bob, hi! So, what did the board say?

927
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:54,724
They're willing to give us half
the funding, but that's all.

928
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,695
We'll have to find the
other half somewhere else.

929
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,664
I am grateful but it's gonna take
too long to find outside funding.

930
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,227
Too long for what?

931
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,965
For Christmas Lodge, for my grandfather.
Look, time is not on their side.

932
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,806
Can I talk to the chairman?

933
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:10,538
I'm sorry Mary, but he's
ready to call it a night.

934
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,580
Bob, please.

935
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,483
Thank you.

936
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,845
Excuse me, Thomas.

937
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:21,979
What is it?

938
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,819
Mary Tobin would like to say a few words

939
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:27,691
in favor of the Christmas Lodge project.

940
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,595
We just spent a whole day on it-.

941
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,532
Please, I'm sure that Bob did a
superb job on presenting the facts

942
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:37,161
but I would like to let you know
about the faces behind those facts.

943
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:40,538
You see, Christmas Lodge is
not just a restoration project,

944
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,601
it's a labor of love. My family...

945
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,544
Mary, we all understand your family
has a long history with the lodge,

946
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,082
and we took it into consideration

947
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,684
when we granted you partial funding.

948
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,380
If we give you any more
funding we'll break the budget.

949
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,353
But half is as good as none.

950
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,754
I mean, Christmas
Lodge is disintegrating,

951
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:58,520
and it might hit the point of no return

952
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,060
if the roof gives in this winter.

953
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,889
I'm sorry Mary.

954
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,089
Mary...

955
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,767
you did your best.

956
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,795
Yeah, try telling that
to Jack and Charlene...

957
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:14,135
and my grandfather.

958
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,101
Thanks Bob.

959
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,485
I talked to the chairman,
and after all that work,

960
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,385
all the work you and the boys
did, all that paperwork...

961
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:30,948
Mary?

962
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,494
Grandpa! Hey.

963
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,897
How's the lodge coming?

964
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,640
Well it's... not as good as I had hoped.

965
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,334
What's wrong?

966
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:53,144
Oh, Grandpa I don't want to trouble you.

967
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,447
You're not troubling me! I...

968
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:01,354
I may be stuck in this bed, but
I'm still part of this world.

969
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:08,661
Well, you know, we have
enough funding for the supplies

970
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,095
but we're still praying
for money for a crew.

971
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,434
Didn't I give a construction
company to a crew

972
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,498
who could get the job
done right and on time?

973
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,641
The boys and I are
booked through New Years.

974
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:24,711
With what?

975
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,642
Odds and ends.
- Well cancel them!

976
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:30,877
We can't! We have a
responsibility to our customers.

977
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:35,346
There are plenty of crews
looking for work around here,

978
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,793
there are very few contractors
up in the mountains.

979
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:45,189
You give the odds and ends
to the city contractors

980
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:46,801
and go and help Jack Rand!

981
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:52,033
Now Dad, I wish it was that
easy. We all have bills to pay,

982
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,472
who's gonna write us a check
to go work on the lodge?

983
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:56,575
Me.

984
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,576
You?

985
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:01,581
You tell me what you need to get the
job done and I'll write the check.

986
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,743
I don't know, Dad. None
of this seems right.

987
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,021
Letting Christmas Lodge
turn to dust doesn't either.

988
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,257
Our family took a lot from
the lodge over the years,

989
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:22,863
it's time to give back. I...
I want this to be my legacy,

990
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,864
and your inheritance. What do you say?

991
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,903
I'm sorry, but no.

992
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:37,018
Let me describe it another way.

993
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:43,548
I remember a tale of a carpenter

994
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,130
that would not turn down this job
regardless of money or convenience.

995
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:50,095
Who?

996
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:57,436
He was a man from Galilee, who
saw service to those in need

997
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:06,107
as his highest calling.
Now, when you consider

998
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:10,718
helping Jack who has the
greatest need right now

999
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:17,053
with no help in sight, or
your other responsibilities,

1000
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:22,254
you might well ask yourself,

1001
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,424
what would Jesus do?

1002
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,231
With his guidance, I really believe

1003
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,135
you'll make the right decision.

1004
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,610
You know I can't argue with scripture.

1005
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:42,006
Then don't! Do the
right thing, help Jack.

1006
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,081
You always get me, don't you?

1007
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,252
It's not me.

1008
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:53,154
It's the Lord's lessons I live
by that put us on the right path.

1009
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:59,431
You tell me what you want from me
and the boys, and we'll be there.

1010
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,336
Really?

1011
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:03,502
Yeah.

1012
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,768
Thank you Dad.

1013
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,473
Oh, thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1014
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:18,712
And thank you, Grandpa.
You never let me down.

1015
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:23,316
That's because you
never let me down, kid.

1016
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,896
You know, if they keep up this
pace we might be done by Christmas.

1017
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,695
Really, you think so?

1018
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,668
It'll go even faster if we help them.

1019
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,362
How?

1020
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,140
Come on, follow Pete.

1021
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,239
All right, so you take the sand block,

1022
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,214
watch your fingers, and you wanna
work with the grain of the wood.

1023
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,375
Okay? Look.
- How?

1024
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:54,489
This way... and here.

1025
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,353
Think you can do it?

1026
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,856
All right'

1027
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:07,334
Hey, look at you go! And what
do you think you're doing?

1028
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:10,030
Well, I can't let the
boys have all the fun Dad.

1029
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,373
You haven't been on site in 10 years.

1030
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,841
Feels good to be back.

1031
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:21,048
You sure you're up for this?

1032
01:02:21,204 --> 01:02:23,206
I didn't spend my entire
life behind a desk.

1033
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:24,716
You know, my Grandpa had me on his crew

1034
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,015
when I was a little
bit older than Charlene.

1035
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:30,182
I could sink a nail faster and
cleaner than any of his men.

1036
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,019
Prove it.

1037
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,235
Hey, I thought I heard
the human nail gun.

1038
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,430
That's my girl. After all these years
you still haven't lost your touch.

1039
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,542
I haven't been this tired in...

1040
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:52,242
since as long as I can remember.

1041
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:57,147
Yeah me either. Feels good though,

1042
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:04,752
can't figure out why, but it does.
There's something about this place.

1043
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,992
My great grandparents used to say that
uh, they didn't build Christmas Lodge

1044
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,762
to have a place to live,
they built it to live.

1045
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:19,497
And I think they would be
very, very happy to know

1046
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:21,576
that the people who share a past

1047
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:24,339
are here to look after
her in her old age.

1048
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,673
That's sweet.

1049
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,179
By the time we're through,
she'll look 50 years younger.

1050
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,185
I wish we could do the same for Grandpa.

1051
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:38,091
We all do. He's climbing the ladder

1052
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:43,292
we'll all climb one day.
He's just happy knowing

1053
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:47,457
we're all together and giving
an important part of history

1054
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:50,334
a new lease on life?

1055
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,671
Has your family always been this close?

1056
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:58,304
Well, we've wandered
some here and there,

1057
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,844
but we've always found
time to meet in the kitchen.

1058
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,647
Well, I just hope that when
we're through, I can restore

1059
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,950
some of that sense of home.

1060
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,525
Speaking of kitchens, I
think I have one to clean up.

1061
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:15,857
Here, let me help you out.

1062
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:21,800
Mary, I was uh...

1063
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:25,996
What Jack?

1064
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:28,839
Wow, I am not very good at this.

1065
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:30,503
What is it?

1066
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,921
Um...We spent a lot of time together
over the last few months and uh, I guess

1067
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,184
you could say I've
taken a liking to you.

1068
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:47,386
I hope that doesn't
make you uncomfortable.

1069
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:52,190
No! I mean of course not, I'm honored.

1070
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:58,572
Well uh, I was wondering

1071
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:04,702
if maybe we could be more than friends.
If maybe we could go out together sometime.

1072
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:08,711
Oh, Jack I don't know.

1073
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,116
I really don't have a great
track record with men and it...

1074
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:16,418
it wouldn't just be us, it
would be us and Charlene,

1075
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:18,685
and I don't want her to get hurt

1076
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:23,026
if it didn't work out.

1077
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,292
You were the one that said
anything's possible, right?

1078
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,257
I did.

1079
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,233
That means something
good is possible too.

1080
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,464
I just haven't noticed
any bad points between us,

1081
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:34,371
have you?
- No... no.

1082
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:41,044
Then take a chance on
me, Mary. Let's just start

1083
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,315
by maybe going to dinner,
dancing, a movie...

1084
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,651
Something normal grown ups do
when they're going out as friends.

1085
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,116
And if it doesn't work out,
Charlene doesn't have to know

1086
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,320
that we were courting

1087
01:05:57,587 --> 01:06:02,332
and we could still be
friends. What do you think?

1088
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,644
Did I misread you? ls
it that hard to decide?

1089
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,750
No, no Jack... my
reluctance has absolutely

1090
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:23,516
nothing to do with you whatsoever,
it's just... there's so much at stake,

1091
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,455
I really um, I don't wanna mess it up.

1092
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:27,993
Okay. So the answer's no.

1093
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,029
No.

1094
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:37,763
No it's a yes. I am willing

1095
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:40,842
to take that chance with you
because I feel the same way

1096
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,534
and I'm so tired of fighting it.

1097
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:00,987
Wow, you guys are really
moving right along!

1098
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,791
Have to, the weather's not going
to stay like this much longer.

1099
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,231
When winter hits up here, it hits hard.

1100
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,891
Won't be able to see
the roof or the walls

1101
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,800
under 15 feet of snow.

1102
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:10,871
Bye you guys!

1103
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:11,995
Bye!

1104
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:15,371
I feel so bad leaving you. You know
that I wouldn't, I would stay and help

1105
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:18,708
if I wasn't in the final
days of the Wharf project.

1106
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,509
Your hands are itchin' to
pick up a hammer aren't they?

1107
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:23,810
That's my girl.

1108
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,878
Check in on your mother
and your grandfather for me,

1109
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,513
tell them I'll get down for a couple
of days when we get the place sealed up.

1110
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:32,525
I will, thanks Daddy. I love you.

1111
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,595
Mary! Wait up a sec?

1112
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:37,493
Yeah.

1113
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:40,100
I better get back to work.

1114
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,068
Hey.

1115
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:50,610
Listen uh, I was just wondering, and I
know this is short notice and all but uh,

1116
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,909
I was wondering if it would be possible for
your family to come and stay here this Christmas.

1117
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:59,250
Really? Of course. I've
just, I've always hoped

1118
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,788
to get my family back out
here for one more Christmas,

1119
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,390
especially my grandpa.

1120
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,721
Great.

1121
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:08,290
Maybe we should keep
this between us for now

1122
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,261
because there's so much work to be done

1123
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,195
and I don't want to disappoint
them if the lodge isn't ready.

1124
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,359
I understand.

1125
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:15,527
But, thank you.

1126
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:19,796
Drive safe.

1127
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:22,140
I'll talk to you soon.

1128
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:43,657
I was right. Wasn't I?

1129
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:51,768
While you were gone,
I met with the board

1130
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:55,401
and I explained the situation
to them, and they agreed

1131
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:59,003
to go to our donors to
seek funding to expand out

1132
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,671
to the rural areas.

1133
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:05,252
We already have the funding
for a project or two.

1134
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:06,812
Oh!

1135
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:11,585
So, would you be interested in
opening a branch office out there

1136
01:09:11,681 --> 01:09:14,594
to coordinate our efforts?

1137
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:16,359
Yes?

1138
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,523
Yo, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

1139
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:24,535
What's up?

1140
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,610
Bob just asked me to open
an office in the mountains.

1141
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,043
He what?

1142
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,876
Yeah, he wants to help small
towns save historic buildings.

1143
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,680
Wow. Four hours, that's along commute.

1144
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:42,655
No, no I mean, l wouldn't be
driving there, I would move there.

1145
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,658
Hmm, let me guess... to Christmas Lodge?

1146
01:09:47,617 --> 01:09:49,324
All right Mary, fess up.

1147
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:52,491
It's no coincidence that you
broke up with one perfect man

1148
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:54,535
to now agree to work
near another perfect man.

1149
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:57,629
Have you been seeing Jack Rand?
- Is it that obvious?

1150
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,197
I knew it! You've been so happy lately.

1151
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:03,037
Well maybe you'll get
that ring after all.

1152
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:04,907
Okay, let's not be ridiculous.

1153
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:06,906
I have work to do.

1154
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,245
Oh my gosh, that's
fantastic. Wait a second.

1155
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,682
Yeah?

1156
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,984
You're leaving the city
to go work in the country,

1157
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,254
who's taking your position here?

1158
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,084
Uh, you!

1159
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:23,493
No, no, no, no. This is one
Christmas gift I don't want.

1160
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:27,262
You know, I said that 10 years
ago and look where it got me.

1161
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,233
Yeah, you dropped it on me.

1162
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,338
Well, for one thing I
think that you can do it,

1163
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:34,568
and for another thing you have
been doing it, and quite well.

1164
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,734
So... Merry Christmas.

1165
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,044
God...

1166
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:39,911
Hang on a sec.

1167
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:41,071
Okay. So the answer's no.

1168
01:10:43,106 --> 01:10:44,107
Mom!

1169
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:47,514
Yeah.

1170
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,454
What?

1171
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,030
Uh, no... I'll... I'll meet you there.

1172
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:06,205
I have to go to the hospital,
my grandfather just had a stroke.

1173
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:14,977
Mom, hey. How is he? Hi Daddy.

1174
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,447
They're still evaluating him.

1175
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,041
Can we see him?
- Not yet honey.

1176
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:25,921
Hey you guys. ls uh, is
Kathy in there with him?

1177
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:30,087
Yeah, and a group of doctors.
Listen, he's in good hands.

1178
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:37,661
So I guess this means that he's going
to have to go to a home now right?

1179
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:39,670
Your mother and Cathy
did the best they could.

1180
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:44,609
Of course. Mom, I know that you
and Cathy did everything you could.

1181
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,306
Hey, hi. How is he?

1182
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,146
Stable and resting.

1183
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:53,515
Will they need to operate?

1184
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,146
No, it was a fairly mild stroke.

1185
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,953
The doctors think he's
lost some motor skills.

1186
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,460
Can we see him?

1187
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:02,824
The doctors need to
conduct additional tests,

1188
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:04,659
when they're done you can see him.

1189
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,200
Thanks Kathy, thanks for everything.

1190
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,697
I love that photo.
- I do too.

1191
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,651
Yes. You know Mom, I
had a dream that Grandpa

1192
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,518
and I would walk
together in the mountains,

1193
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:31,356
and he would point out every leaf,

1194
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,454
every bird, every tree, every ridge

1195
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:37,864
and not just tell me what it
was, but what it meant to him.

1196
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:41,131
He breathed so much
life into this world,

1197
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:46,367
I try to get it back on my own
but it's just...it's not the same.

1198
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,669
Your grandfather is a very special man.

1199
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:54,007
You were the only one who truly
listened to what he had to say,

1200
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,984
and he rewarded you with a
richer appreciation of the world.

1201
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,361
Can I tell you something even sillier?

1202
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:09,822
Of course.

1203
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:16,998
Grandpa said that the Lord and
Grandma spoke to him every time

1204
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:22,407
he went hiking. He found
such strength and peace,

1205
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:27,546
and I actually thought
that they were speaking

1206
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,742
to me the day that they put Charlene
and Christmas Lodge in my path.

1207
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,941
And they were telling me

1208
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,248
to repay Grandpa somehow
for everything he's given me.

1209
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:39,523
Maybe they were, maybe they still are.

1210
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,956
I spent many hours with
Grandpa after he got sick,

1211
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,266
and he told me many times that
his illness was for a reason,

1212
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:53,203
that God was trying to tell him
something. When I asked what, he told me

1213
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:58,302
that he didn't know for sure, but that
throughout his life from the Great Depression

1214
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:02,779
to fighting World War ll, to working
on his dangerous construction sites

1215
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:06,250
and most challenging of all,

1216
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:09,552
the passing of your grandmother,
that God let him know

1217
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:16,153
that he was there for him. He said many
times that he didn't tell him what to do,

1218
01:14:16,252 --> 01:14:20,257
but that his scriptures let him
lead the good life that he was

1219
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:24,064
intended to lead, even
when he felt like giving up.

1220
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,509
So you're saying that I should trust
in the Lord to give me strength,

1221
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,776
even if it means putting
Grandpa in a home.

1222
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,578
Your grandfather isn't
happy about this decision,

1223
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:40,645
but he did tell your
father that he knows

1224
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,450
it's best for him and the family.

1225
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:45,682
Thanks Mom.

1226
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:51,694
That helps. Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

1227
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:54,932
This is where you rescued
me and Natty, remember?

1228
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:58,870
Of course I remember. You know, that
was the most important day of my life?

1229
01:14:58,995 --> 01:14:59,837
Why?

1230
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:03,334
God and my grandmother
talked to me that day.

1231
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,173
Really? What did they say?

1232
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:09,014
They said that I need to
spend more time here with them.

1233
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:12,780
And that you were their messenger,
that you were their special gift.

1234
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,119
I was?

1235
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,553
You were, and still are.

1236
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,850
Do you still think they're gonna
be done in time for Christmas?

1237
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,486
Oh, you know only time will tell.

1238
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,464
Is your grandpa gonna be there?

1239
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,691
I don't think so Charlene.

1240
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,300
Why not?

1241
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:31,167
Well, he's you know,
he's trying to bounce back

1242
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,704
from the stroke but it's
been really hard on him.

1243
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,569
But you promised.

1244
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:38,369
Well, I didn't really promise.

1245
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:41,075
I just want a grandpa again.

1246
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:47,549
Honey I know, I understand.
Believe me, I understand.

1247
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:52,588
You know what, now we just, we just
have to pray for the best, right?

1248
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,191
Yeah.

1249
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:09,842
I have cookies! Grandpa, whoa!

1250
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,943
Hey, how you doing?

1251
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:21,085
Better than yesterday. It's almost
time for my physical therapy.

1252
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,784
Whoa, physical therapy?

1253
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,120
It's not as fun as it sounds.

1254
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:28,551
Grandpa, I'm so proud of you.

1255
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,720
You'd think I had won the Olympics.

1256
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:34,796
Well, can I come with you?

1257
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:38,633
Of course, of course
kid. The more the merrier.

1258
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:43,073
I can't imagine a better coach.

1259
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:45,468
Oh, you might regret saying that.

1260
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:52,717
Comin' through!

1261
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:05,323
You guys, it smells delicious!

1262
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:07,128
It will be!

1263
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:16,271
Oh, he's here!

1264
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,110
Who's the movie star?

1265
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:27,481
That's Jack.

1266
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,748
Your new flame?

1267
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:32,955
What is it with you two?
We go to dinner as friends,

1268
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:35,585
can't a woman have a man as a friend?

1269
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,028
No!

1270
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,698
Behave.

1271
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:42,197
Hey!

1272
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:43,828
Charlene, hi.

1273
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:46,338
This is my mom and
this is my sister Cathy.

1274
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,207
Glad to meet you again Jack, Charlene!

1275
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,207
Hi.

1276
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,936
Mary and the boys have
told us so much about you,

1277
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,105
you're already a part
of the family! Come in.

1278
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,807
Thank you for welcoming
us into your home.

1279
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:57,340
Come in, come in.

1280
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,489
Where's your grandpa?

1281
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,821
Oh, Charlene he couldn't make it.

1282
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:07,116
Why not?

1283
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,459
He's still not feeling
well, but he's working on it.

1284
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:11,363
Can we go see him?

1285
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:14,195
Oh, Charlene. Not today.

1286
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:16,632
What about Christmas?

1287
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,662
Let's talk about it later, okay?

1288
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:21,638
We must watch the costs!

1289
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:24,839
Jack, glad you could make it.
- Good to be here.

1290
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,913
Any trouble getting here?
- No, it was a nice ride.

1291
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:30,080
Okay, everybody. Turkey's on,

1292
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:33,715
come to the table!
Thank you for your help.

1293
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:35,849
Smells good, mother.

1294
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:39,818
Father, would you say Grace?

1295
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:51,698
Heavenly father, thank you for the many
blessings you have given our family.

1296
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:56,535
We are all eternally grateful for your
love, and the love of those who are here

1297
01:18:56,665 --> 01:19:01,171
and those who live with you in
heaven. I pray that you accept

1298
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,876
our thanks and prayers as
we strive to live every day

1299
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:07,351
in the way that celebrates the
many gifts you have given us.

1300
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:12,916
We also pray that you help my father,
Mike Sr., who's long sewed as a beacon

1301
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,120
of spiritual and moral
leadership to us all,

1302
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,233
get better so that he
can once again join our

1303
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:23,031
family table. Amen.

1304
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,399
Amen.

1305
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:28,568
And now, if you will pass me one of your

1306
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,573
Christmas Lodge biscuits...

1307
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:51,588
Well this is the best
Thanksgiving we've had in years.

1308
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,290
I'm so glad.

1309
01:19:55,591 --> 01:19:58,731
Does your family always take
in strays so effortlessly?

1310
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:01,938
Well, they do if they like them.

1311
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,442
Take a seat.

1312
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,646
So, I have great news.

1313
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:17,315
Your grandpa can make it for Christmas?

1314
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,788
No, that would be excellent
news, this is just great news.

1315
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:23,758
Okay, what is it?

1316
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:26,162
I found a new location for the office.

1317
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:32,963
Is it uh...a little bit
close to the lodge maybe?

1318
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:35,666
It's...10 miles away.

1319
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,672
That's great, Charlene
is gonna be thrilled.

1320
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:41,605
Now what about places to stay,
you found a place to stay yet?

1321
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,206
No, still looking.

1322
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:49,986
You know, if um...

1323
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:55,157
if we were married, you could
probably stay up at the lodge

1324
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:56,823
Probably.

1325
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,356
Jack, don't toy with me.

1326
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,166
What if I'm not toying with you?

1327
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:11,302
Look uh, I don't think that we
should be having this conversation,

1328
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,911
maybe I'm just not ready.

1329
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,844
I don't mean to upset you.

1330
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:17,711
No, you're not upsetting me. I just...
I don't think that the timing is right.

1331
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:22,755
I don't think that the
timing is right. Okay?

1332
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:25,991
It's okay.

1333
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,346
Care to do the honors?

1334
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:55,251
This is your lodge son,
your past, your future.

1335
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,357
Well none of this would've been
possible without your family's help.

1336
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:58,550
Our family.

1337
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,057
Without our family's help.

1338
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:03,254
I wouldn't say that, you're
the one who kept things going.

1339
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,558
Uh, Dad... Jack, I appreciate the
mutual fan club for each other,

1340
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,792
but there are a lot
of people waiting so...

1341
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,869
Jack, please.
- I'd better go get the door.

1342
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,463
No, no. Not until you
light this house up.

1343
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:15,633
Okay, hands. Hands!

1344
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,972
Three, two, one!

1345
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:28,278
Lamb sake's alive, would
you look at this place!

1346
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,245
Grandpa?

1347
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:33,884
Grandpa you made it! You made it.

1348
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,950
Yes.

1349
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:35,891
You're here!

1350
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:38,663
Grandpa?

1351
01:22:39,588 --> 01:22:40,566
Finally!

1352
01:22:40,656 --> 01:22:43,330
Who is this little angel?

1353
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:44,995
That is my daughter Charlene.

1354
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,233
Who are you?
- Jack Rand.

1355
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,174
Little Jackie?

1356
01:22:51,834 --> 01:22:54,576
My goodness, you are the
spitting image of your father

1357
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:59,813
and your grandfather. I know
for a fact that they'd be proud

1358
01:22:59,942 --> 01:23:03,151
of what you and my boys
have done. Christmas Lodge.

1359
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,458
Why, she looks like she did the
first Christmas that me and my Mavis

1360
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:09,189
spent up here.

1361
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,958
Well without your generosity none
of that would've been possible, Sir.

1362
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:14,328
It's a drop in the bucket.

1363
01:23:14,423 --> 01:23:16,801
Oh, come on Grandpa,
we know that's not true.

1364
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,666
Well excuse me, I have to
go check on the turkey so

1365
01:23:18,794 --> 01:23:20,671
Charlene... Excuse me, sorry.

1366
01:23:20,796 --> 01:23:22,173
He's here! He's here!

1367
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:25,937
Hey you guys! How you doing? You
wanna put the presents over there?

1368
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,349
Good to see you. How did you get here?

1369
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:35,386
Well, Dad, Morn and the rest
of us pooled our money together

1370
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:38,720
and bought a special van as a
Christmas gift for the whole family.

1371
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,688
And you just... you didn't tell me?

1372
01:23:42,618 --> 01:23:44,791
We wanted to make it a
surprise. Well, it is.

1373
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:50,861
It's really um...the
best kind of surprise.

1374
01:23:53,128 --> 01:23:54,801
Grandpa, I knew you'd make it!

1375
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,540
Dad...

1376
01:24:03,906 --> 01:24:04,884
Not now, Charlene.

1377
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:08,684
Um, I'd like to propose a toast.

1378
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,756
To my great grandparents who uh,

1379
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:18,358
who built Christmas Lodge with love
and an appreciation of the mountains

1380
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,591
God gave this blessed Earth.

1381
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:26,828
I'd like to propose a toast
to my grandparents and parents

1382
01:24:26,929 --> 01:24:31,207
who kept the lodge running through
a depression, and uh, wars and uh,

1383
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,041
biblical storms.

1384
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:41,187
And I'd also like to thank all of
you. Uh... especially Grandpa Tobin,

1385
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,753
Mai?'

1386
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:50,858
Mike, Matt, Pete... the labor and uh, for
providing us with the funds, the materials,

1387
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:58,296
the love we needed to uh,
give her the second chance

1388
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:04,378
she so richly deserves. Myself and
uh, Charlene and all of the Rands

1389
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:11,213
who came before us are eternally
indebted to you. Cheers!

1390
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,616
Cheers! Cheers!

1391
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:22,560
If you bear with me, I have
one more thing I'd like to say.

1392
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,631
Oh, Jack...

1393
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,567
Mary, your uh, father and mother
have already given their blessing

1394
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:37,166
and now I'd like to ask you.

1395
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,178
Will you take my hand in marriage?

1396
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:45,183
Will you be my wife
and Charlene's mother?

1397
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,280
Please Mary?

1398
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,285
Of course. Of course.

1399
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:01,834
Bravo!

1400
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:03,095
All right.

1401
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:04,431
Congratulations.

1402
01:26:17,706 --> 01:26:19,481
Oh, Grandpa!

1403
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,884
I promised I'd play for
you, when I got out again.

1404
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:37,728
And so when our very first
Christmas together as a family

1405
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,169
at the historic Christmas Lodge,

1406
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:43,902
more families joined us that Christmas
than I ever thought we could handle.

1407
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,036
But we did. Jack knew what to do.

1408
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,580
And my family filled into
make sure that the guests

1409
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:53,915
had the same unforgettable Christmas
that we had there decades before.

1410
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:59,353
And through it all, I felt the
presence of God, my grandmother,

1411
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:02,554
and the members of Jack's family
who were no longer with us.

1412
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:05,497
It was comforting to have
them looking out for us.

1413
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:10,326
Every day I realize that
the past never leaves us,

1414
01:27:10,492 --> 01:27:14,907
it's as present and important as it ever 
was. We just have to make an effort

1415
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:19,240
with love, strength, and commitment,
to bring it back again.

1416
01:27:19,868 --> 01:27:24,544
The spirit of Christmas Lodge is
our heritage and it is our future.

1417
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:29,079
They shut down the national park road,

1418
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:33,421
we can't get to the lodge and it's
too late to go back to the city.

1419
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:37,294
We were wondering if you
have any rooms available?

1420
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:43,134
We say yes. Please come inside
and join our Christmas party!

1421
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,259
Thank you.
