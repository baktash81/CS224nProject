1
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,698
So, we come to this...

2
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:31,198
Austrian dragons on the streets of Vienna...

3
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:35,106
with drawn swords against his own people.

4
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:39,493
Count Tafe has ordered
the police to be strict.

5
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:45,782
Fair but strict. My people must learn.

6
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,984
You have no right to arrest
me. I'm Slovenian. I'm Czech.

7
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:53,196
Here there are no Czechs,
Slovenes, Croatians or Hungarians,

8
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,491
are loyal subjects of the
Austrian Emperor. Take him to trial.

9
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,201
Next...

10
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:01,694
Documents... Name...

11
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:06,441
- Maurice Ephraïm Zeps.
- What a surprise!

12
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:08,778
Newspaper editors in a police station.

13
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:11,440
It's nothing surprising,
sir, in a police state.

14
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,522
This is not my first visit here.

15
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,985
On this occasion, how do
you explain your presence...

16
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,949
on student marches?
I was just passing by.

17
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,031
Inspector, I didn't see any disorder,

18
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:24,810
until the police and soldiers arrive.

19
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,324
If it were the other way around, these
demonstrations would not happen so much.

20
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:29,640
You're insinuating...

21
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:33,279
To a Jew that my quotation in the
New Testament would be unchristian.

22
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,857
Make yourself available to the
police for future interrogations.

23
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:40,396
Naturally. I have nothing to hide.

24
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,862
You are lucky. I wish I could say the same.

25
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:47,123
Next! Documents. - I don't have them.

26
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,693
And your name, then?

27
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:49,949
Rudolf.

28
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:57,110
- Rudolf what?
- Make your choice! Rudolf, Franz, Charles.

29
00:04:57,359 --> 00:05:01,569
No documents. You would
be successful as a comedian...

30
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:11,900
Your Royal Highness! I
wanted... Please forgive me!

31
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:19,811
I naturally forgive you, and you in return
forgive these... these friends of mine.

32
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,808
- and releases them immediately.
- Immediately, Your Royal Highness.

33
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:24,477
Thanks.

34
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,526
It's cold... cold...

35
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:34,985
I am cold...

36
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,851
Thanks.

37
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:22,434
Your Royal Highness may enter immediately.

38
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,264
Disapproved.

39
00:06:29,146 --> 00:06:35,511
After all these years the military would
use another shovel to polish the buttons.

40
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:40,685
We ruled perfectly for three
centuries, with chalk and alcohol.

41
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:44,930
This new mixture is more
effective in official use.

42
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:50,719
I would never accept change just for the
sake of changing. Disapproved. Therefore...

43
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,263
- I don't remember telling him he could sit down.
- No, sir.

44
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:07,633
When you were a child, and you
were insolent, I had you punished.

45
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:11,224
Remember the punishments I can still inflict?

46
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:16,132
Certainly. He made me dig in the
snow once, I was six years old, sir.

47
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,414
Remember?

48
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:23,446
In one thing at least, it stands firm.

49
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,054
You always let me down.

50
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:29,596
You don't ride as well as your
mother, you don't shoot as well as I do.

51
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:33,883
I wanted you to agree to
serve in the Imperial Guard,

52
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:36,261
and you chose the infantry
regiment among strangers.

53
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,504
I found a Spanish princess for you to marry,

54
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:42,720
and you preferred to choose a Belgian.

55
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:46,257
Publicly opposes my political opinions,

56
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:52,048
associates with liberals, anarchists, Jews.

57
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:55,131
And now this...

58
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:04,376
Your spy is very fast.

59
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,305
Quick enough to inform me
of the companies you keep.

60
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,415
Maurice was just passing by. - Passing...

61
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:14,590
In time to see how your hussars...

62
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,874
they advanced on young people who
rebelled against... Order! They protested...

63
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:24,414
the order! Guided by their
friends in the socialist press.

64
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:30,916
We don't see it so seldom that we
should take advantage of this opportunity.

65
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,545
Your private life... - It's mine!

66
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,381
It belongs to the people!

67
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,833
Next week there will be a public celebration
of the fifth year of your marriage.

68
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:48,706
I would prefer that until then your marital
life was something more conventional.

69
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:53,336
Conventional like your lord, the Empress...

70
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:57,252
traveling from one end
of the world to another,

71
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,713
and never staying in town
more than two weeks at a time?

72
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:06,380
It became that. What took
you away from here, father?

73
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:14,584
Your mother and I, in our
own way, love each other.

74
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:22,128
I pray that one day you will find
such happiness with Stefanie.

75
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:28,585
Is it our happiness that worries him, or
the homeland that the Habsburgs left him?

76
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:31,244
Anyway, if something happened to me,

77
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:33,666
he always has Archduke Ferdinand.

78
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:36,044
My idea is that he is
not destined for Emperor!

79
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:39,329
- I don't think you think your son is!
- Rudolf!

80
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,117
Sir?

81
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:44,159
What wall is between us?

82
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:52,871
The ties... that there were...

83
00:09:54,756 --> 00:09:57,669
you broke them, father.

84
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:07,165
How are the maneuvers?

85
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:10,959
Will you get the third army body?

86
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:14,583
Well, I'm the second in
command, General Von Lederburg...

87
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:17,832
is having problems for
not having enough horses.

88
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:22,906
People don't seem to live
to an old age in Vienna.

89
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,040
Look at my father is very close to sixty...

90
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:28,863
exercise daily,

91
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:34,030
has a simple diet of stews,
and drinks moderately.

92
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:38,948
Perhaps I will be his age when
I become Empress, my dear.

93
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:50,160
Is your dress for the big occasion pretty?

94
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,575
What jewelry will you wear? - This matters?

95
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,658
Your mother will be late, and in black,

96
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:05,785
It's a little gem, and all eyes
will be on it the moment it arrives.

97
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,616
You don't even know if
she'll come. The last night...

98
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,286
- I heard you were on the fox hunt in England.
- But she'll be here!

99
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,997
She comes back whenever she has
the chance to play the perfect mother!

100
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:20,365
Stefanie, be careful how you
talk about the Empress! He heard?

101
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:23,034
You are always on her side, against me.

102
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:27,155
In the name of Heaven, I am your son!
- And that's something you should remember!

103
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:31,073
I've seen the way he looks at her
sometimes and not the way a son...

104
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:33,367
...you should look at my mother...

105
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:37,069
I always thought I was a
smug, idiotic bourgeois,

106
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,697
but i never thought it
was this bad and so low.

107
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:42,873
Tell me these things
one more time, just once...

108
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,779
and I'll break your sick
and stupid Belgian neck!

109
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,607
Did you recognize Count Hoyos?

110
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:17,611
Do you know the girl? It's a new one for me.

111
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,362
- A gypsy. It's called Marinka.
- What does she do?

112
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,067
She dances, and... well, she dances.

113
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:36,561
It's hot in here! I need an air change.

114
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:40,231
You mean, you need a change.

115
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:45,606
- Will you be here tomorrow night?
- If someone invites me.

116
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:48,354
Someone just invited.

117
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,685
Marinka! I'll be there in a moment!

118
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:10,139
I told Hoyos to give his gypsy a bath.

119
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,353
- However, in case you're upset...
- Mizzi Kaspar, you're a...

120
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,345
His Royal Highness has the
most loyal and obedient subject.

121
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:25,305
If you are so loyal and obedient,
first you take off your clothes.

122
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,184
First everything is removed.

123
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:35,518
Second, you come quickly to bed.

124
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,893
Secondly...

125
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,762
Second is also done.

126
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:50,480
And as a third? - Third...

127
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:21,685
From what I can see, I gather
that His Highness is upset.

128
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,721
No, His Highness is very, very upset.

129
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,005
I know many men who would like to be
annoyed by the beautiful Mizzi Kaspar.

130
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,714
- They cannot afford it in this system.
- What system?

131
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:38,924
A system where we have archdukes,
princesses and women desperately available.

132
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:43,010
Last night, in the court of Baloo,

133
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,762
a brunette Polish woman,
wanted to talk to me.

134
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,882
I asked to meet with her.

135
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,173
I later found out that I had slept with her.

136
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:57,012
- Did you have to remind him?
- It took all my skin off in diplomacy.

137
00:15:57,264 --> 00:16:00,262
Even my father would be
proud of me. The dear old man!

138
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:05,178
- But the Emperor is not that old.
- The emperor was born old.

139
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,252
Old men should not be allowed to rule.

140
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,920
At our meeting tonight at
the Prater with the Hungarians,

141
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,587
if you're still bored, we
can go abroad again.

142
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:23,802
We try travel, we try
politics, cheating, drinking...

143
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:28,417
I don't like the old man,
what do we have left?

144
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:36,190
- Always stay... in the dark.
- Innocence... is too close to ignorance.

145
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:45,001
I believe His Royal Highness
should resign in my favor.

146
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,413
Was it followed? - We got rid of them.

147
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:59,208
Where are Prince Johan
and his men from Hungary?

148
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,921
It's probably harder to get
rid of the police than you are.

149
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:06,546
I haven't been to the Prater for a long
time. Read carefully as I take a walk,

150
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,416
It's my article on student unrest.

151
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,625
I hope it doesn't get
censored like the previous one.

152
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:16,754
Don't miss out on a good read. I
think there are some good things.

153
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:22,831
Bareheaded, wearing a uniform...
What do you think he wants, or not here?

154
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:27,176
Also, Taafe's spies doubt he's on Zakers.

155
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:43,042
- I need to see your father.
- King? What does my brave knight want?

156
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:46,336
To ask for your hand, my princess.

157
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:49,461
Does my lady mind having a drink with me?

158
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:51,831
Please go away. I don't know him.

159
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:54,036
Well, I thought since I was alone...

160
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,856
- You are not alone.
- Sorry, I didn't know you were with her.

161
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:59,831
Sorry, I beg your
pardon... I beg your pardon.

162
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:12,787
Your attitude was just
like his, lying, blatantly.

163
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:19,000
- Lying?
- Which was with me. How do I know him?

164
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,872
I can't see well without my glasses,

165
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,537
I dare not use them in public.

166
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:28,702
I could look the other way, and you can
see for yourself, they are totally unknown.

167
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,040
It's just as bad that I'm
talking to you and not him.

168
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:35,083
It's that bad... - Then I shouldn't.

169
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,074
Thank you anyway.

170
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:43,123
- What a horrible face! Who are you?
- I am the devil! I came for you!

171
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:48,915
- Oh, why, why?
- Because, I came to get it, I'm going to cook it in the soup.

172
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,698
Pity, pity! Please, lord devil. Pity, pity!

173
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,240
pity? Never! "Thank you", she says! Ha-ha!

174
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,743
How sad it was.

175
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:01,866
They were in love and she was punished.

176
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:03,784
Oh look!

177
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:05,123
PAUSE FIVE MINUTES

178
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,032
- Are you sure I don't know him?
- I said we never met.

179
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:23,032
Oh! Look! Aren't we adorable?

180
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,197
Bring this one, bring this one win a prize!

181
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,453
Now, it's my turn.

182
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:34,157
Ten Heller! I don't think we need them.

183
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,946
I ask him why he lacks
faith in me so much. Be alert!

184
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:44,988
Failed! What did I say?

185
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,947
Failed! This is becoming monotonous.

186
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:54,862
Failed!

187
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:58,241
I failed... - Period! Oh, period!

188
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:07,116
Hey everybody, look, the officer to
my left got a bottle of wine, for just...

189
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,451
Hey sir...

190
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:10,819
I wanted to draw attention to us.

191
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:13,827
I'm thirsty! I would like a bottle of wine.

192
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:18,401
You know the saying, "What
is the sheep to the ram."

193
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,155
Perhaps now you believe that I was thirsty.

194
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,231
Now I believe in everything.

195
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,985
My mother always tells me I
have the manners of a coachman.

196
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:37,275
- Well, have you?
- I have strange ways, but I need them.

197
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,440
I should have had them anyway,
I had seven teachers as a child.

198
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:45,568
- Seven? Must have been a terrible child.
- Well, you know how it is...

199
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:49,352
Did your parents understand you?

200
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:55,651
- Did you say something so funny?
- No... but a sad thing.

201
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:58,940
Now I understand why I have parents.

202
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:02,734
So that their children
could be misunderstood.

203
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,310
- My children will not be.
- I assume you don't have any?

204
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,188
- Not even committed?
- I'm more what you can call, lonely.

205
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:17,853
This I can understand. Has anyone
ever been successful in the chase?

206
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,980
One thinks so, but I am indifferent.

207
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:23,636
And the others are so busy
with their uniforms and horses...

208
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,564
Would you like to dance with me?

209
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,109
to ask the same.

210
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:32,060
I know young ladies
shouldn't, but coachmen can.

211
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:18,811
Heavens, you must be the best in the world!

212
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:22,562
Oh, I have to disappear! Thank
you and I'm sorry. Excuse me!

213
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:33,182
No, she would never
come to a place like this!

214
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:50,270
Johane! He almost didn't
recognize him without his beard.

215
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:51,564
I hoped not.

216
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:55,138
But with six carriage changes
between Budapest and Vienna...

217
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:58,924
By the way, dear Rudi, this is Count Karoli.

218
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,598
I'm glad to finally meet you. - Goodnight.

219
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:03,890
I look forward to hearing your news.

220
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:10,554
First of all, Karoli was elected to
lead the Hungarian uprising. Yea?

221
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,928
Let me explain. For us to be able to
overthrow the current regime in Hungary,

222
00:23:17,225 --> 00:23:20,840
we have to have with us
not students, intellectuals or...

223
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:24,176
disgruntled officers, we must also have...

224
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:28,178
the support of the common people,
among the farmers, the middle classes.

225
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,966
If I go back with Prince Johan,

226
00:23:31,226 --> 00:23:34,007
your cousin, we will carry a great weight,

227
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,102
but if I can say that you are supporting us,

228
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,552
then we will seek the support
we need from all classes.

229
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:46,471
You can tell this to
your friends in Budapest:

230
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:51,551
I support the demand for an independent
Hungary, I believe in free elections...

231
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,048
since Hungary remained unimpeded.

232
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:59,755
- I was expecting something more profound.
- I repeat.

233
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:05,589
Since to Hungary to remain non-Imperial.

234
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:11,426
And remember this, my friends,

235
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:16,385
I intend to save the
Empire, but not to divide it.

236
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,838
God be praised for granting Your Highness...

237
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:37,881
one more day to live.

238
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,670
Your schedule for today, Your Highness.

239
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:43,124
at eleven o'clock visit your mother,...

240
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:46,253
Empress Elisabeth, at Schöbrunn Palace.

241
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:51,211
At two o'clock at the train station
to meet the Prince of Wales.

242
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,178
Keep company at dinner.

243
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:58,377
Tomorrow, at eleven, a game of tennis.

244
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:01,088
The Order of the Garter was prepared for...

245
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:04,872
- show Queen Victoria that I wore it?
- Your Highness!

246
00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:07,748
You know my orders! - Orders? Whose orders?

247
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:11,290
From the Count of Taafe? Now
you've become one of your spies?

248
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:14,229
Everyone in this Palace already
conspires against me, trying to...

249
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:19,673
- Your Highness!
- This is my migraine, Loschek...

250
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:25,510
Do you know how it hurts? It's
not the pain, it's the fear of pain.

251
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,544
Your mother, the Empress, did not command me,

252
00:25:28,842 --> 00:25:32,004
she asked me to help him quit.

253
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,497
It is dangerous, Your Highness.

254
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,500
I will see you today. In
her honor, therefore...

255
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:02,748
Rudolf! God save Rudolf!

256
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,912
- Your Highness, good morning.
- My mother, where is she?

257
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,494
Her Majesty the Empress is in the greenhouse.

258
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,413
He asked for today, not
to follow the protocol...

259
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:49,274
- I don't understand...
- Don't put on that angry air. We won't.

260
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,746
In England, where they create
the most beautiful camï¿½lias.

261
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,994
- Do you know how they usually take care of them?
- No, Your Majesty.

262
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:59,325
Tea leaves. They just put the
parts together around the roots...

263
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,373
We will try the same, Your Majesty. Tea...

264
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:08,238
Well, I just have to find someone in
Vienna who drinks tea instead of coffee.

265
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:14,029
Maybe we should try the British Embassy.

266
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,786
You seems pleased to see me.

267
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,656
I'm happy to see you.

268
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,700
You should have let me
know of your early presence,

269
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:24,152
instead of giving the
impression of wanting to hide.

270
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:28,076
I even have the delicious sensation of
having your voice running through my senses.

271
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:33,284
Oh Mom, you can't believe
what a wonderful surprise it is.

272
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:36,288
the joy of thinking that you came
to my wedding anniversary party,

273
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:39,179
is confused with the memory
of these terrible five years.

274
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,711
It's so hot in here. Can we go outside?

275
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:41,831
Of course you can.

276
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:45,069
Until tomorrow morning. Otto, Fritz...

277
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:47,146
And you look tired.

278
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:50,287
This is due to the many
late nights at Sacher.

279
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:53,161
I know what you do, even in England.

280
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:57,605
And the migraine... Is it better?

281
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:02,568
If you want to know if
I'm still taking morphine,

282
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:06,109
"Yea". But, not so often.

283
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,738
And in your honor, not today.

284
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:13,533
And today I found out. Even my
mother had people spying on me.

285
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:17,199
But you also have Loschek. We both love you.

286
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:20,906
I suppose my father thinks
the same thing that he likes me too.

287
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,190
Don't imagine, no.

288
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,153
But he shows his affection for
me in the strangest possible way.

289
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:30,608
It is no stranger than
your affection for him.

290
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,656
However, I'm so glad to see you.

291
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:36,507
His love is expressed in phrases
with a certain amount of charm.

292
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:41,485
Why does it keep disappearing forever?
One day it's here, the next it's gone.

293
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,194
- Never dare to say goodbye.
- I hate the word.

294
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,484
It's so terribly final. I never
use the word "Goodbye,".

295
00:28:50,906 --> 00:28:54,570
And my granddaughter?
Oh God, I hate that word too!

296
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:59,400
It's lovely! Fortunately, it didn't
come out to any of the parents.

297
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:03,434
Perhaps not in temperament, and
there will be a generation free of insanity.

298
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:12,021
In this family this should not be regarded
as a grace! In this family, no. Never!

299
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,060
My dear Edward, how nice to see you again.

300
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:46,149
Nice to see you. - This way...

301
00:29:48,776 --> 00:29:52,224
Yours or mine? Excuse
me? The National Anthem.

302
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:55,185
I'm deaf, so I can't tell one from the other.

303
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:59,726
The Radetzky Marsch by Strauss. - Uh!

304
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,561
We are ready, Your Highness.

305
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:05,353
The Guard of Honor,
ready for your inspection.

306
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:07,479
Very presentable men.

307
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,849
- How is dear Queen Victoria?
- Amazingly healthy.

308
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,347
And your mother?

309
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:14,183
You see her more in England than I do here.

310
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,395
Great honor, congratulations.

311
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:24,309
- Buffalo Bill is still in London?
- Very fun. You left.

312
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,271
Now he's gone to Germany.

313
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:29,524
I believe the Kaiser will soon invite
you to the next Prussian Government.

314
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:33,262
William, I think we should try a
little harder to sympathize with him.

315
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,806
I can't stand it, even though
we're family and he's my cousin.

316
00:30:35,816 --> 00:30:39,145
Thank God you're not my
cousin. Almost everyone else is.

317
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:41,129
Oh! British decoration. Very good.

318
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,303
No, I'm not your cousin, but
you could be your father. My dad?

319
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:49,439
It is impossible to meet Elizabeth
and not fall in love with her.

320
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:51,851
She remains the most
beautiful woman in Europe.

321
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:56,142
I wish I could move my feet like
she rides a horse. I can never keep up.

322
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,060
Brought some foxes to
refine your flock's blood.

323
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:03,469
Long live Edward!

324
00:31:03,726 --> 00:31:05,304
Long live the Prince of Wales!

325
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:07,925
By the way, why are there always red carpets?

326
00:31:08,189 --> 00:31:10,853
The stations are ideal
places for assassinations.

327
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,425
On the red carpet you don't see the blood.

328
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,299
Angry! Very good!

329
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:40,721
- Tell me, where is she from?
- Marinka is a Hungarian Gypsy.

330
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:44,881
You know, we have all races
and colors in the British Empire...

331
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:49,598
but looking on a map, but I don't
find a single inhabitant of Hungary,

332
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:53,511
but only Hungarians can dance like she does.

333
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:56,592
When you become king, you can
change all that. Attach Hungary.

334
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:02,382
When? Forget that my mother
is 55 years old. And only 55.

335
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:05,837
The Emperor is sixty. Only sixty.

336
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:10,346
My God, here we sit,

337
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:13,474
successors to the throne awaiting a death...

338
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,168
...to discover the meaning
of life. But you know, Rudolf...

339
00:32:16,473 --> 00:32:22,385
Thank you dear Mizzi. You know,
you have to come to terms with life.

340
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,001
You have to find compensations such as... or
you end up crazy, with so many frustrations...

341
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:32,553
to proclaim himself lustful,
and libertine, above all...

342
00:32:32,845 --> 00:32:35,335
...or a terrible player,
if what they say is true,

343
00:32:35,638 --> 00:32:39,132
but I have at least shared some emotions
from the experiences with my people,

344
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:42,629
and I shall have lived, before I became king.

345
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:46,880
Why would anyone want our work?
Sometimes I ask myself... Why?

346
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:50,134
My father tells him why.

347
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,985
Man is born to be king.

348
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:58,623
- Destiny, the divine right, he has us all.
- Don't be technical, my young prince.

349
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:04,918
Your father does very well, he has all the
attributes of royalty, all the diplomatic expertise.

350
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:10,836
All the stubbornness. All resistance to
new ideas, which man can accumulate.

351
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:19,464
Students in Vienna are full of life, and
their enthusiasm and ideas spring up...

352
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,459
But for him they are dissidents
and criminals, they have to be traitors.

353
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,497
Oh, Marina!

354
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:33,008
Beautiful creature! It's not English,
unfortunately, but it's beautiful all the same!

355
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:36,458
She doesn't usually wear that dress,
but it's in honor of the Prince of Wales...

356
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:39,257
Do me a great honor.

357
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:42,754
Does she speak English? - You're a gypsy.

358
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,538
My father taught my mother something,
but I never learned the language.

359
00:33:46,796 --> 00:33:49,584
I have the feeling it's done deliberately.

360
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:53,996
I think what I mean, and
she understands, Edward.

361
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,293
- Edward, I have to leave. State Affairs.
- Do you have to go?

362
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:10,452
- For an hour or two?
- The blue door leads to a private staircase.

363
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:19,665
Come sit down, my dear! Drink some champagne!

364
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:24,659
What's the news?

365
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,416
Prince Johan and Count Karoli
managed to avoid the secret police.

366
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:31,910
- They arrived safely in Budapest.
- What about?

367
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:35,787
They want you to commit more deeply.

368
00:34:35,936 --> 00:34:39,948
Continues. - He wants you to be his king.

369
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,831
Beware Szeps, there
is a word that is betrayal!

370
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:47,123
On the contrary, he
wants to avoid bloodshed...

371
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:51,243
...the horrors of civil war.
It's dangerous, my friend.

372
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:56,124
Dangerous because of my father. He
would rather see the Empire destroyed,

373
00:34:56,376 --> 00:35:00,239
but never separate it
without having ordered it.

374
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:06,831
- Well, tell them... to be patient.
- Patients?

375
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:09,323
So what about the people?

376
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:11,788
The poor who do not have the right to vote,

377
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,827
with journalists whose articles are censored,

378
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:18,488
with young students who think they
have a vision of how the world should be,

379
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:22,030
think of political prisoners, Jews...

380
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,614
Do you have to be patient,
too? And for how long?

381
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:28,116
I said, tell them to be patient.

382
00:35:28,372 --> 00:35:32,069
Because if I have to learn to
be patient, then so must they.

383
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:35,871
They just went up. - It's fine.

384
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,947
Well done Your Highness.

385
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:52,859
I thought he would never come out.

386
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:55,820
Not now.

387
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:05,653
I think it must have been extremely busy.

388
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:10,657
At least half an hour while
the police wait outside.

389
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:15,694
In less than half an hour my
reputation will be destroyed.

390
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:23,781
Have you ever felt like you
were... being manipulated?

391
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:29,781
you? I? What question!

392
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:46,479
Bravo, Edward. Very well played.

393
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:49,861
How do I know I'm really good
if you don't compete against me?

394
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:52,319
- What nonsense!
- Thank you for the game, sir.

395
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:54,963
So it was a small revenge for
his horse's victory in the Derby...

396
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:57,154
...last year. - I hope we come back again.

397
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,819
Against my horse? It would
be monstrous imprudence!

398
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:04,696
By the way, haven't I seen
your sister and her little misses?

399
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,277
Now we're not so little, now we're
ladies. Typical, in case you haven't noticed.

400
00:37:09,572 --> 00:37:14,524
nonsense. I'm just going to freshen up,
I'd like to see them again. It's fine, sir.

401
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:19,183
Your Highness, this will help you. Thank you
darling. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.

402
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,275
- Edward, who is your friend?
- He lives in Vienna.

403
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:27,311
- His sister is Helena Vetsera.
- I never heard of him. Did you hear?

404
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,311
We met the Viva Baroness Vetsera.

405
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:33,144
It does not belong to the old nobility
and was never received in the Court.

406
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:36,402
But he is a member of the
Jockey Club. I signed up myself.

407
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:40,227
One thing you have, Edward,
when you're a friend, is real.

408
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:43,147
Come and meet them. - After the game.

409
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,835
And on the other side? - The Archduke.

410
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:05,828
Vienna is full of Archdukes.
Think of the great prince.

411
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:08,832
I don't see his wife here.

412
00:38:08,878 --> 00:38:11,874
If I hung out with him more,
maybe we'd hear less stories.

413
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:14,477
And, there you are! My Baroness face...

414
00:38:14,898 --> 00:38:21,228
And you, my girl! You are a
wonderful woman! How you grew up!

415
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:28,117
Hannah! And George...
How nice to see you again.

416
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:31,595
Your Highness, may I introduce
you to Duke Michael of Braganza?

417
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:34,227
I know your uncle very well.

418
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:37,971
I visited him in Portugal. I never
went back there unfortunately.

419
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,147
Maria, come with me a moment.

420
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,478
I thought of a little conspiracy
and I want you to participate. Yea?

421
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:50,145
I learned that my old friend Baltaci's
family was never received at Court.

422
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:53,844
We are not of the old nobility. - Nonsense!

423
00:38:54,144 --> 00:38:57,062
I think it's a personal offense.

424
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,936
As soon as I finish playing the
game, I present it to the Prince.

425
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:05,135
Your Highness, thank you,
but I've had the pleasure,

426
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,728
better said, to meet Archduke Rudolf. I
have no intention of seeing him again...

427
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:16,848
- other than to send you a simple message.
- What message?

428
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,384
Tell your Imperial Highness
that cheating is not nice.

429
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:25,518
This just proves that I was taught at school:

430
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,337
One should not believe in princes!

431
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:16,923
Who do you smile so tenderly, Helena?

432
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:20,512
ï¿½ Balatsi. Why do they call it "rattlesnake"?

433
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:24,748
They say it's so poisonous, you
never know when it's going to strike.

434
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,923
Theresa Stokau mustn't smile so much.

435
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,584
Your teeth are as false as your pearls.

436
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:34,180
And what does she think
she's wearing? Wallpaper?

437
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:37,878
It seems to me as useless as an old carriage.

438
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:46,469
That daughter, at least, is very pretty,
but stupid, almost as stupid as her father.

439
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:49,879
Who wants to be an
ambassador from what I've heard.

440
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:59,011
Even if I can fall asleep, my dear
Countess, I hope you'll wait, that your...

441
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:01,796
guest wake up.

442
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:38,037
Must have some interest in that girl.

443
00:43:58,162 --> 00:44:00,651
Very well, my dear. - What?

444
00:44:00,913 --> 00:44:03,779
Well, the way you woke me up.

445
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:16,066
Did you see that? A
ballerina. What was it for?

446
00:44:16,368 --> 00:44:18,902
Katarina Srat, sabe. - Ah, naturally.

447
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:22,447
Is it true what they say
about her and the Emperor?

448
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,780
Of course, it's your mistress. - Lizel!

449
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:28,444
- Everyone knows it!
- What's a mistress to do?

450
00:44:28,746 --> 00:44:31,658
How can I explain to you? Remember Pompadour?

451
00:44:31,994 --> 00:44:39,863
Suppose the Emperor was Louis XV, and
suppose Katarina Srat was the Pompadour.

452
00:44:43,073 --> 00:44:46,438
Oh! - Oh, hello, my dear...

453
00:44:46,698 --> 00:44:51,936
And you, beautiful young
creatures. Theresa isn't here?

454
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,566
no. She went to another
cabin to see a friend.

455
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:58,186
Well, you think you'll be
delighted when you hear my idea.

456
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:03,439
Come on, Lizel... I thought I'd
introduce you to the Empress' box. I?

457
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:07,644
- To me? Me, the Emperor?
- Come quickly, before the end of the break.

458
00:45:08,075 --> 00:45:12,813
A little color doesn't hurt. And
remember, always show your best face.

459
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:15,196
Tell me...

460
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:20,974
when can you tell the Emperor of the Pope that
you want to be ambassador in Constantinople?

461
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:26,944
Well, not right away. Maybe it's
best to introduce her to the prince first.

462
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:31,734
- And when can I ask, then?
- Well, there are times for that.

463
00:45:31,988 --> 00:45:34,987
A woman would be stupid if she should...

464
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:42,352
Maybe it's better not to say anything. Some
women are more attractive when they don't talk.

465
00:45:42,695 --> 00:45:45,894
Here we are at... Let me see you...

466
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:52,894
- Yes, but on the Balkans, Junot faced...
- Your Highness. Excuse me, Your Excellency.

467
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:58,837
My dear cousin... Thank you for
saving me from the Balkan situation.

468
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:02,587
The young Baroness Stokau. -Her highness...

469
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:09,125
Daughter of Baroness Stokau.

470
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:13,993
Champagne?

471
00:46:16,422 --> 00:46:19,290
"Giselle" was never my favorite ballet.

472
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:22,836
It is overly sentimental.

473
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,786
You can go, my dear.

474
00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:31,503
Your cabin is not far.
It's on the other side.

475
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:46,162
I do not need the consent
of a prosecutor. Not yet.

476
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:50,162
Not yet...

477
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:46,180
Please don't move. I can't
reach the chair. Just a moment...

478
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:55,384
There is Your Majesty. No need to reduce half
a centimeter. No, as long as he doesn't run.

479
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:59,678
Now Riki, look at his attitude when he trots.

480
00:51:59,973 --> 00:52:01,550
ï¿½ of course.

481
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:28,761
Good morning, mother.

482
00:52:31,266 --> 00:52:34,216
But what a pleasant surprise!

483
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:37,222
How was it? - Incredible, Your Majesty.

484
00:52:37,514 --> 00:52:40,348
- The skirt seemed to frighten him.
- Amazing too, Your Majesty.

485
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,551
Now see how important this
is, to experience this on a horse.

486
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:48,590
Admit that you are even
more beautiful when you ride.

487
00:52:49,218 --> 00:52:53,593
The only money I honestly earned,

488
00:52:53,926 --> 00:52:57,757
when I was a child your grandfather
and I used to perform at a circus,

489
00:52:58,052 --> 00:53:01,750
for some poor villagers,
people without money.

490
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:06,129
Oh, how beautiful those days
were! We were so happy...

491
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:09,883
And you, did you have a good childhood?

492
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,800
Whenever you were present. - I was sick.

493
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:17,634
I thought I was sick. I had to go outside.

494
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:21,583
But he always managed to be present
on all the important days of my life.

495
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:28,082
On my first communion, on my
twenty-first birthday, on myâ¦wedding.

496
00:53:28,424 --> 00:53:33,130
When I remember that horrible
sacrifice, I should have avoided it!

497
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:41,169
But he forgot, he was present
on another important day. When?

498
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,251
On the day you were born.

499
00:54:05,257 --> 00:54:07,414
Maria? - Yea?

500
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:12,999
Notice that it's playing the
same melody as the other day?

501
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:17,200
Here he looked her in the
eyes and took her in his arms.

502
00:54:17,506 --> 00:54:22,626
Yes, but you must be exhausted.
He played it probably 150 times.

503
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,831
Countess Larissa came to visit
Her Excellency. I must announce...

504
00:54:27,169 --> 00:54:30,085
Oh, I'm so glad to at
least find someone home.

505
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:33,371
- What a pleasant surprise!
- I was just passing by and I thought...

506
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:37,665
Oh no, Maria, please don't
stop. Plays so wonderfully...

507
00:54:37,962 --> 00:54:41,161
But what a charming look, and what
a lovely dress. Won't you sit down?

508
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:49,415
No thanks. I think it's better to walk, it calms
the nerves and avoids gaining weight. I can?

509
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:53,913
Speaking of weight, have you
seen young Diana Meternik lately?

510
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,739
She puts crimson on every cheek she finds.

511
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,909
On the run, last night.

512
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:05,250
for everyone's safety, she
should sit in the audience.

513
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:08,161
I don't think the cabins support your weight.

514
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,115
But nobody noticed her. Because
everyone was just looking at their daughter.

515
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:19,491
Mary was sensational. All
the questions were about her.

516
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:22,951
Come on, keep playing and listen to me.

517
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,491
My cousin Rudolf wants to see you.

518
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:31,825
An unexpected lucky gift has
arrived! Keep going, I follow...

519
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:41,361
Talked like about you for an
hour. No, no, no! It sounds like this!

520
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:43,362
Play louder.

521
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:49,615
He wants to see you. You want me
to accompany you. Do you want to go?

522
00:55:51,663 --> 00:55:53,951
And leave it all to me.

523
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:57,694
Ah... I'd like to keep
playing, but I have to go.

524
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:01,411
I have to try on a new
dress for Prince Philip's party.

525
00:56:01,706 --> 00:56:04,158
It will be very boring, but what can you do?

526
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:07,115
Helen, au revoir. I really have to fly.

527
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:09,528
Hanna... e Maria...

528
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,237
Oh! He knows? I just had a splendid idea.

529
00:56:14,578 --> 00:56:17,909
Why don't you come with me and
help me? It also has a refined taste.

530
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:20,773
Isn't it too late for shopping?

531
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,813
Helena, do me a favor, lend
me Maria for a few hours.

532
00:56:25,076 --> 00:56:27,996
- I hate it when I'm alone.
- Well, certainly, if you think that Maria...

533
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:30,525
Come quickly, Maria, go get dressed.

534
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:37,026
- Mom, are you sure you don't mind?
- Of course dear. But come back soon.

535
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:41,320
- Please, can I go too?
- No, you're too young.

536
00:56:41,618 --> 00:56:43,610
I need some time. If it's not too late.

537
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:46,825
Don't worry about Maria. It's in good hands.

538
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:49,984
Oh, heavens I have so much to do.

539
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:52,639
Always so busy these days!

540
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:02,740
No need to be nervous.

541
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:38,104
Let me see you! You have no foot in
your face. At least it's not enough. Ready!

542
00:57:39,905 --> 00:57:43,271
Do what you want with your
eyes. They are wonderful.

543
00:57:43,904 --> 00:57:47,731
But don't get too bored.
It doesn't feel good, is it?

544
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:54,227
- I don't think she's scared at all.
- You have a beautiful smile. Use it often.

545
00:57:54,487 --> 00:58:01,727
Rudolf doesn't like serious people.
There are many serious faces around you.

546
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:13,439
- Bratfish with its carriage.
- With Countess Larissa.

547
00:58:13,777 --> 00:58:15,352
That was a few years ago!

548
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:23,771
Welcome.

549
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:31,562
Have fun my dear. And enjoy this glorious
day well. Do you see the future you can have?

550
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:37,356
And who will know? You
might even have a nice time.

551
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:46,728
Over here, please.

552
01:00:07,977 --> 01:00:09,883
Follow me please.

553
01:00:29,307 --> 01:00:32,837
"But I don't believe in princes!"

554
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:43,797
Edward of Wales gave me your
message. I was thinking you weren't coming,

555
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:50,757
...or maybe at the last minute, I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

556
01:00:51,055 --> 01:00:57,714
I don't know! From this
dark place, or... from me.

557
01:00:58,261 --> 01:01:04,210
He knows? I think if I was there,
I wouldn't be afraid of anything.

558
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:09,541
So here is where you live. And this is yours.

559
01:01:10,593 --> 01:01:17,208
Now I'm thinking of you,
every day sitting in this big chair,

560
01:01:17,513 --> 01:01:19,999
A huge chair, I can honestly tell you.

561
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:24,342
You're writing at your office desk...

562
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:35,873
- It is the Louis IX wedding ring of France.
- Not gold, not even silver.

563
01:01:36,176 --> 01:01:40,666
As in most marriages,
it is simple metal, iron.

564
01:01:41,008 --> 01:01:44,667
His fingers were almost as thin as mine.

565
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:48,210
The wedding ring, a saint, imagine!

566
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:54,130
I don't like that. Do you always
sit with that in front of you?

567
01:01:54,424 --> 01:02:00,253
It was a gift from my cousin Ludwig.
So that he would buy me, for being alive.

568
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,957
Life is so... Ludwig, do you
mean the King, Duke of Bavaria?

569
01:02:05,215 --> 01:02:08,498
What... - Lies! These stories are all lies!

570
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:15,082
He was just... just...
different. It wasn't crazy!

571
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:19,082
Nobody knows for sure how he died.

572
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:31,085
- Don't you want to... take off your hat, and your coat?
- There are no mirrors.

573
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,623
In the next room.

574
01:02:45,669 --> 01:02:47,329
Is that the prince's bed?

575
01:02:47,712 --> 01:02:51,373
It's very good. Anyway, I don't sleep much.

576
01:02:54,002 --> 01:02:59,335
Countess Larissa is right
in my nose. I look horrible.

577
01:03:08,877 --> 01:03:10,535
Is there something wrong? - No.

578
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:17,157
- It's just different from what I thought it would be.
- Different? How?

579
01:03:18,793 --> 01:03:22,158
No, that's not true either.
I knew what you were like,

580
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:25,418
but I expected it to be different.

581
01:03:25,709 --> 01:03:29,325
- That everything was simpler, that's all.
- I don't understand.

582
01:03:29,626 --> 01:03:34,117
Many come here with Countess Larissa, who
powders their noses at the entrance to the gates.

583
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:39,862
The beginning is always the same, the end is always
the same and what happens in the middle is...

584
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:51,527
- Well, not for you, that's what I realized.
- I'm glad you understood.

585
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:55,324
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Rudolf.

586
01:03:55,581 --> 01:04:01,000
Thank you Rudolph. And
when will I see you again?

587
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:04,449
tomorrow. I will find a way.

588
01:04:15,037 --> 01:04:19,197
What a waste! Caviar, champagne...

589
01:04:19,497 --> 01:04:23,532
Make sure they don't go to
waste as soon as I turn my back.

590
01:04:23,786 --> 01:04:28,589
You were safe when you
said you didn't trust the princes.

591
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:30,113
Sim.

592
01:04:31,078 --> 01:04:34,409
You can call Bratfish. The
Baroness is on her way out.

593
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:58,022
Goodnight My Love.

594
01:04:58,493 --> 01:05:01,856
What a lovely thing to say.

595
01:05:15,614 --> 01:05:18,234
Goodnight My Love.

596
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:10,522
Well Hoyos, go ahead.

597
01:06:41,528 --> 01:06:43,735
Will it always be like this? - Not always.

598
01:06:43,772 --> 01:06:45,353
I am satisfied.

599
01:06:45,693 --> 01:06:50,395
It's nice at the moment, but after a while...

600
01:06:51,314 --> 01:06:54,729
Oh, if only I weren't a Habsburg prince!

601
01:07:48,143 --> 01:07:53,678
And yet they seem to be the people who want
the Empire to collapse. Destroy the Habsburgs.

602
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:56,883
No, Your Highness almost all of
them carry the colors of Austria.

603
01:07:57,142 --> 01:07:59,381
For them the monarchy is an institution.

604
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:02,683
Do you mean that Franz Joseph
became one of them?

605
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:06,009
These rebellious Hungarians
that Karoli spoke of...

606
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:07,968
I hope it doesn't mean violence.

607
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:10,930
No Revolution is usually
made without some bloodshed.

608
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,795
Long live the Royal Prince!

609
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:18,975
Long live the Emperor!

610
01:08:24,242 --> 01:08:25,284
Long live the Emperor!

611
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:47,802
There are disturbances
ahead, sir. He was worried.

612
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:53,045
Thank you Rudolf, I appreciate your concern,
especially in such an unexpected situation.

613
01:08:53,432 --> 01:08:59,216
I don't see why not. Today I'm on duty.
I'm sure any Habsburg would do the same.

614
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:04,508
No, today you have behaved
as I expected my son to behave.

615
01:09:29,886 --> 01:09:34,343
Oh, thank you, my dear, for
this wonderful piece by Fabergï¿½.

616
01:09:34,635 --> 01:09:37,207
You should thank Rudolf, Your Majesty.

617
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,128
You would never allow me to choose anything.

618
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:43,588
And please also thank
Erci for her delicious letter.

619
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:48,045
Obviously, I'll have to spend a lot until my next
birthday, trying to reward you, but I'm grateful.

620
01:09:53,174 --> 01:09:56,207
Rudolf, don't go yet.

621
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:09,418
I want you to know how deeply I am grateful
for your protective gesture this afternoon.

622
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:15,751
As your father, I would like
to try to get to know you better.

623
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:19,627
Your friend, the Prince of Wales,
have you benefited from your visit?

624
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:24,289
- Benefit?
- For any advice you might have given.

625
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:30,786
Sir, Count Taafe is waiting for
me at the Zahar for my private party.

626
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:36,121
Edward, your friend spoke to me
because he is sincerely worried about you.

627
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:39,351
My private life and Edward
don't give me the right to lectures.

628
01:10:39,483 --> 01:10:42,232
I don't mean your private life.

629
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:50,330
And relieve yourself because I have nothing against
your actress friend. And ease your mind, sir...

630
01:10:50,377 --> 01:10:52,952
knowing that I have nothing
against your friend the actress.

631
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,785
It's about your public life,
which I want to discuss.

632
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:00,789
My public life consists of receptions,
balls, charity galas, duties...

633
01:11:01,043 --> 01:11:03,664
obligations that any
scarecrow could participate!

634
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:06,288
I should be learning the
subjects of governance,

635
01:11:06,543 --> 01:11:08,914
I hate to be present when
you consult with your ministers.

636
01:11:09,209 --> 01:11:12,079
When you learn to moderate your
attitudes, you are welcome to join us.

637
01:11:12,377 --> 01:11:14,531
Are you not surprised at
what you sincerely believe?

638
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:20,748
Let me say it as a parent, not as a
consulting company. Don't trust people.

639
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,700
Among the people there are certain enlightened
minds but the people are a multitude,

640
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:30,451
the same herd that stormed this
palace when he was just 8 years old.

641
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:34,826
The same mob that killed
my great-aunt Marie Antoinette.

642
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:39,250
This is your people. The people you
want to allow to govern themselves.

643
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,911
Look at these countries,
the enlightened countries,

644
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,786
like America and France,

645
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:47,955
Can you imagine their unhappiness?

646
01:11:48,248 --> 01:11:50,572
The Republican States
continue to be involved in wars,

647
01:11:50,915 --> 01:11:54,659
are poor, remain poor, the rich get richer,

648
01:11:54,955 --> 01:12:02,031
cops and judges are the cheapest
money can buy. Are you listening to me?

649
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:08,527
- I'm listening, but I don't agree.
- To maintain supreme power,

650
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:13,943
- must recognize the responsibilities of power.
- Power!

651
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,907
He clings to him like a miser.

652
01:12:17,247 --> 01:12:19,819
Sitting here as heir to the
Austro-Hungarian throne,

653
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:22,739
I am no more than a political eunuch.

654
01:12:23,411 --> 01:12:28,234
Would you like to be Inspector General?

655
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:35,492
Well, where else I could collaborate would
be by being your Second Corps Commander.

656
01:12:35,787 --> 01:12:39,445
Count Taafe will work out his
promotion to the rank of General...

657
01:12:39,746 --> 01:12:45,111
with the entire commission of Inspecting
the Royal forces within the Empire.

658
01:12:45,411 --> 01:12:48,324
Well, for once, I have no words.

659
01:12:48,578 --> 01:12:52,321
You will have to travel frequently
visiting the different units.

660
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:55,023
Your first assignment will be
to represent me in Prague...

661
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:58,733
in the maneuvers of the Seventh Army.

662
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:00,823
Dad...

663
01:13:01,743 --> 01:13:05,439
You are satisfied! - Grateful.

664
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:10,738
Well, I won't keep you any longer. Everyone
is waiting for you to open the dance.

665
01:13:13,031 --> 01:13:16,564
Tell Count Taafe I want to speak with him.

666
01:13:38,571 --> 01:13:40,149
Your Majesty?

667
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:43,363
This young woman is
different from other women...

668
01:13:43,697 --> 01:13:47,257
so different that I think everything should
be done to arrange a marriage for her with...

669
01:13:47,405 --> 01:13:50,651
...the Duke Miguel de Braganza.
- Portugal is my debtor.

670
01:13:50,944 --> 01:13:53,980
I helped them in their claims in Brazil.

671
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:57,119
- And the family, that I don't know...
- I wouldn't know, Your Majesty.

672
01:13:57,406 --> 01:14:01,064
They are rich. Extremely wealthy.
Cosmopolitans. They take a lot of trips.

673
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:05,437
You have to see if you can get
something, in other words, your family...

674
01:14:05,736 --> 01:14:10,313
you can start your rich
cosmopolitan travels again.

675
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,528
Any piece looks impressive when it
fires empty cartridges make a lot of noise!

676
01:14:24,902 --> 01:14:28,312
What is your maximum elevation?

677
01:14:31,027 --> 01:14:34,273
Sorry, I don't know, sir.

678
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,396
What is the maximum elevation of this cannon?

679
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,599
We will propose the
manufacture of this cannon.

680
01:14:45,901 --> 01:14:49,350
And an important and simple
fact, we have to ask a sergeant.

681
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:53,311
It's one thing I check several times, I
think the sergeant should be promoted

682
01:14:53,606 --> 01:14:55,729
and you gentlemen should
take a course in artillery.

683
01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:16,977
These rifles should be cleaned with oil.

684
01:15:17,313 --> 01:15:20,062
Infantry should be taught how to use them.

685
01:15:29,564 --> 01:15:32,729
I've noticed that the horses
are not well taken care of.

686
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,768
I only see an advantage in providing
the army with more outdated ones.

687
01:16:15,057 --> 01:16:18,721
If they fall into the enemy's
hands, you will deceive them too.

688
01:16:18,976 --> 01:16:20,302
General!

689
01:16:20,601 --> 01:16:24,344
All maps of border areas must be reviewed,

690
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:28,801
and all officers must be
instructed in the reading of maps.

691
01:16:39,055 --> 01:16:41,507
His Imperial Highness
The Royal Prince Rudolf.

692
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:45,006
Your Highness, this is an honor.

693
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:48,047
Intrusion, I'm afraid, dear cousin.

694
01:16:48,348 --> 01:16:52,129
I need your help. I'm on
my way to the parade in Linz.

695
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:55,633
I have to see Maria. -She's out skating.

696
01:16:55,931 --> 01:17:02,755
Forgive me, leave immediately.
My train leaves in a few hours.

697
01:17:03,307 --> 01:17:08,592
Your Highness, please, I beg you, be patient.

698
01:17:08,847 --> 01:17:10,720
I don't understand.

699
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:14,792
With this girl you've never been in
love before, I should have understood.

700
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:21,584
This relationship, well I know it's a love
relationship, but it can hurt you, hurt you.

701
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:29,460
Destroy her every opportunity
to be... happy with someone else.

702
01:17:29,763 --> 01:17:34,750
Who told you to tell me
that? Was it Count Taafe?

703
01:17:38,593 --> 01:17:43,333
I thought this time I kept it very secret.

704
01:17:43,885 --> 01:17:50,464
So my father knows too.
That's why he gave me the...

705
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:59,333
And I thought I had finally
given myself a responsibility.

706
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:05,500
I was grateful. I was almost liking him.

707
01:18:05,756 --> 01:18:08,625
I remember now, because he told
me that he would have to travel often.

708
01:18:08,924 --> 01:18:13,133
Your Highness, Taafe
told me to tell you this,

709
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:17,079
but you didn't tell me why.

710
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:19,871
Of one thing he may be right.

711
01:18:20,174 --> 01:18:24,041
I mean no harm to you, my friend.

712
01:18:38,795 --> 01:18:41,499
- Looks like you weren't surprised?
- I didn't.

713
01:18:41,797 --> 01:18:45,787
Sometimes, before I fall asleep, I
know that the next day I will see you.

714
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:48,369
My last thought is of you.

715
01:18:50,252 --> 01:18:53,288
Hot chocolate. - Flavored wine for me.

716
01:18:54,671 --> 01:19:02,326
My brother George needs to watch
him. You are with your friends. It's fine.

717
01:19:02,794 --> 01:19:06,078
It's terrible, but I can see better beyond,

718
01:19:06,377 --> 01:19:09,957
I can see you here. Vanity, vanity...

719
01:19:10,254 --> 01:19:13,536
My love, you seem exhausted. - I'm thinner.

720
01:19:13,835 --> 01:19:17,284
Worried about you, far away in Vienna,
and a lot going on behind my back.

721
01:19:17,543 --> 01:19:19,415
If it makes you jealous,

722
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:21,794
I can tell you that many things
are going on. - For instance?

723
01:19:21,903 --> 01:19:26,611
Duke Michael Braganza made me
a marriage proposal, through his uncle,

724
01:19:26,622 --> 01:19:27,772
the king of Portugal.

725
01:19:29,401 --> 01:19:32,651
And Count Taafe offered my uncle
the post of Ambassador to Brazil.

726
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:37,540
I was a fool to believe
they would leave us alone.

727
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:41,365
The Emperor has the biggest ears in Europe.

728
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:44,201
And I think I have the
most horrible nose. Yes?

729
01:19:51,872 --> 01:19:53,199
Thanks.

730
01:19:54,832 --> 01:20:00,414
- How much time?
- Just a few hours. I'm just passing through.

731
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,618
Did you get my letters? - Every day.

732
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:07,571
I thought a little... - What?

733
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:12,654
I know now that they opened them
And copies are sent to Count Taafe.

734
01:20:12,955 --> 01:20:17,161
But why? We didn't hurt
anyone! Oh yes of course!

735
01:20:17,456 --> 01:20:21,285
You have a wife and a son
and you will have an Empire.

736
01:20:21,582 --> 01:20:23,984
What is Mary? What is it?

737
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:31,899
Nothing. irremediable. yes.
Uncle infinitely desperate.

738
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:36,985
It cannot be irremediable! Look at me!

739
01:20:39,953 --> 01:20:41,574
I'm looking.

740
01:20:42,744 --> 01:20:48,739
I have to go now. This boring parade in Linz.

741
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:56,535
But always remember this, it may take
time, but we will be together one day...

742
01:20:56,868 --> 01:21:00,151
and we will never be apart again.

743
01:21:10,742 --> 01:21:14,436
So now they meet openly in public places!

744
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:18,107
His Highness doesn't
seem to care who sees them,

745
01:21:18,363 --> 01:21:22,145
to worry about avoiding my men. It is
easier to make peace between two nations,

746
01:21:22,489 --> 01:21:25,855
to stop a man and a woman who
are in love. If she were a daughter...

747
01:21:26,155 --> 01:21:28,526
mine in this kind of... was
resolved by me, and my family.

748
01:21:28,823 --> 01:21:30,896
This is a description...

749
01:21:31,195 --> 01:21:34,520
for the name and reputation of the Habsburgs
throughout Europe. Making the subject of gossip...

750
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,399
for the foreign press...

751
01:21:37,657 --> 01:21:41,864
There are no actions I can
take, sir, without your orders.

752
01:21:42,156 --> 01:21:44,987
And I will do what the
Emperor wants me to do.

753
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:50,814
It's what most parents in the same situation
would do if they had the power. Or maybe...

754
01:21:51,739 --> 01:21:57,854
If I had your authority, sir, a
higher order would not be necessary.

755
01:21:58,155 --> 01:22:04,068
- There are ways and means...
- You have my approval.

756
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,642
What is this? Tell me
the truth and don't lie.

757
01:22:11,903 --> 01:22:13,981
Why did I lie?

758
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:19,101
Would you rather believe someone
who writes such a letter and doesn't sign it?

759
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:22,395
Tell me what is written here is not true.

760
01:22:22,697 --> 01:22:26,226
So it's true! Have a lover!

761
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:32,102
You've been having secret meetings! Now I
know why you have so much shopping to do,

762
01:22:32,402 --> 01:22:39,641
so many little discussions. What's
his name? Mom, it's not what you think.

763
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:43,646
He loves me. - What's his name?

764
01:22:45,608 --> 01:22:47,231
I can't tell you.

765
01:22:47,527 --> 01:22:52,181
But what a shame for a person
not to know what others know!

766
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:54,348
Answer me.

767
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:56,440
Answer me!

768
01:22:58,814 --> 01:23:05,098
- Mom, if I told you... I shouldn't! I can't!
- Very good!

769
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,681
For this indecent person,
I have some great advice.

770
01:23:09,942 --> 01:23:12,218
"It's good advice that you should send your
daughter out of the country as soon as possible."

771
01:23:12,228 --> 01:23:13,387
No! - It's what you do.

772
01:23:13,649 --> 01:23:16,481
Then tell me his name! - I said. I can't.

773
01:23:16,773 --> 01:23:21,480
You don't leave the house. From
this room until your bags are packed.

774
01:23:22,212 --> 01:23:23,448
Mother!

775
01:23:24,682 --> 01:23:25,910
Mother!

776
01:24:06,934 --> 01:24:11,924
I don't think you're enjoying the
duties of Inspector General. It's not!

777
01:24:12,852 --> 01:24:17,175
I have no authority.
I'm still a puppet prince!

778
01:24:17,475 --> 01:24:21,767
Anyway, it's not the issue. I intend
to resign as soon as I get back...

779
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:27,173
to Vienna, and please don't
ask me why. And I'm asking why!

780
01:24:28,767 --> 01:24:31,551
When he promoted me to Inspector General,

781
01:24:31,808 --> 01:24:34,261
I was happy. Pleased.

782
01:24:34,515 --> 01:24:38,888
I figured you'd given me something
important to do. It's important.

783
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:44,516
Start to see how much. Of course
I wanted, using her own words,

784
01:24:44,806 --> 01:24:51,597
"traveled a lot" could have sent me on
a mission to China or Japan. Or further.

785
01:24:51,849 --> 01:24:58,426
The only problem for sure is
that I wouldn't have traveled alone.

786
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:05,842
Praise God for granting Your
Highness one more day to live.

787
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,467
Thank you, Loschek.

788
01:25:08,764 --> 01:25:12,507
- When did you arrive last night?
- The train arrived late. Almost day.

789
01:25:12,804 --> 01:25:16,798
So I let him sleep an hour longer.

790
01:25:17,054 --> 01:25:20,050
Simple clothes, today.

791
01:25:20,342 --> 01:25:23,708
And tell Bratfisch to fetch Baroness Maria.

792
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:30,794
Sorry Your Highness, but Countess Larissa
is at the entrance. What, at this hour?

793
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,710
Send her in! To your room? Why not?

794
01:25:34,928 --> 01:25:37,877
We already spent a night together, on a trip.

795
01:25:41,677 --> 01:25:44,461
- Majesty, forgive me.
- There must be a reason.

796
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,797
Don't blame me for bringing you bad news.

797
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:50,086
For God's sake! Say what! - Maria...

798
01:25:50,388 --> 01:25:53,749
Her family sent her on a trip. - They know?

799
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:57,167
They know there is a lover.
They don't know who he is.

800
01:25:57,469 --> 01:26:02,006
Who told you? Count Taafe
arranged to let them know.

801
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:06,086
- With my father's consent?
- The Count is very intelligent to act in matters...

802
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,213
like these, without the Emperor's consent...

803
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:11,866
- Where did you send her?
- My arm... It hurt me!

804
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:15,806
Where? - The family was too scared to say.

805
01:26:15,843 --> 01:26:18,173
It all happened last night.

806
01:26:18,426 --> 01:26:21,542
There was nothing I could do... Believe me.

807
01:26:38,757 --> 01:26:42,698
- The emperor. I want to see you immediately,
- Today, it will not be possible.

808
01:26:43,005 --> 01:26:46,453
Her Majesty said she
doesn't want to see anyone,

809
01:26:46,796 --> 01:26:52,129
not even you mentioned your name. Neither
does anyone. At least for the next 24 hours.

810
01:26:54,003 --> 01:26:56,539
Your Highness!

811
01:27:16,669 --> 01:27:20,498
Can someone please bring me a glass of water?

812
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:33,117
Drink some more of this. And
put that stupid revolver away.

813
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:36,575
A little more wine makes me miss my aim.

814
01:27:42,461 --> 01:27:44,702
Francisco is dead!

815
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:51,904
Rudolf, is dead!

816
01:27:52,877 --> 01:27:54,581
Karl, he's dead!

817
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:58,074
Joseph, is dead!

818
01:28:06,164 --> 01:28:09,529
Reload this, Alex. You're a good guy.

819
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:12,686
Carry this, for Your Highness.

820
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:16,160
Your Highness, you are
tired. It's better to go home.

821
01:28:18,038 --> 01:28:22,662
I have to wait at home for
24 hours to see my father.

822
01:28:24,537 --> 01:28:28,910
Have you ever waited
this long to see your father?

823
01:28:29,206 --> 01:28:34,953
No, Your Highness. I never expected.
I never knew who my father was.

824
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:41,617
My father approved of you. I knew that?

825
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:47,243
I approve of you too, Mizzi! For
heaven's sake I approved of you!

826
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:51,786
- To show you how I approve...
- So it's more your way!

827
01:28:55,235 --> 01:28:56,492
Give me that.

828
01:28:56,868 --> 01:29:01,278
Where did you see an Inspector
General greet you? I ask him.

829
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:18,191
Gentlemen, like all good musicians,
you play with your eyes closed.

830
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:31,612
Well, now... then, go
to sleep like a good boy.

831
01:29:31,865 --> 01:29:35,397
Wake me up when my father sends for me.

832
01:29:35,656 --> 01:29:38,820
Now go to sleep. Don't worry.

833
01:29:46,573 --> 01:29:48,113
Not all of them!

834
01:29:48,364 --> 01:29:52,773
It's to Mizzi you're talking, remember?

835
01:29:55,029 --> 01:29:56,938
Forgive me...

836
01:29:58,324 --> 01:30:03,392
My behavior was terrible, horrible...

837
01:30:03,655 --> 01:30:06,687
I forgive you.

838
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:13,065
- Lie down next to me.
- I don't want to wrinkle this dress.

839
01:30:13,403 --> 01:30:18,274
- Buy another one tomorrow.
- There's no need to do that.

840
01:30:20,069 --> 01:30:23,106
All you have to do is sleep.

841
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:28,144
Forgive me...

842
01:30:42,983 --> 01:30:49,183
They sent her away...
They sent her away... Maria...

843
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:58,429
I knew that? - No. sleep.

844
01:31:13,153 --> 01:31:16,313
I'm leaving! You are restless!

845
01:31:17,315 --> 01:31:20,599
Highness! At where? Where are you going?

846
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,975
The wedding ring of St. Louis.

847
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:06,847
Read what's inside. - January 13, 1889.

848
01:32:07,384 --> 01:32:08,834
That's today!

849
01:32:10,135 --> 01:32:14,319
 U... B... L... U... D...

850
01:32:14,828 --> 01:32:18,302
"United by love... until death."

851
01:32:29,018 --> 01:32:35,513
Funny! I never thought of Venice in the rain.

852
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:39,091
From now on, I'll just remember it that way.

853
01:32:39,348 --> 01:32:45,847
- I love this weather.
- Looks like a happy child...

854
01:32:46,141 --> 01:32:52,137
Rain is not sad. It's
so light and it dances...

855
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:59,555
- Don't you cry? dance.
- I wouldn't say that.

856
01:32:59,848 --> 01:33:06,460
I know what people say about snowflakes.
They dance like a ballet. But I don't.

857
01:33:06,763 --> 01:33:13,720
I think like... sleep, a deep sleep, and the
snow... but the rain is so happy. Listening...

858
01:33:26,136 --> 01:33:32,928
Maria is love, and sleep, I
think I love you... intensely.

859
01:33:35,053 --> 01:33:43,052
Now I know I love you. You
are in my thoughts... only you...

860
01:33:46,262 --> 01:33:51,335
Remember I once told you
one night before I fell asleep,

861
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:58,082
I know that the next day I will
see you? Last night, I knew.

862
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,497
- Leave some light, please!
- I'm shy. Seriously, I'm shy.

863
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:07,291
There has to be some light.

864
01:34:08,759 --> 01:34:11,211
I'm afraid of the dark.

865
01:34:11,674 --> 01:34:17,504
My love, my love... I'll never
know what shyness is again.

866
01:34:23,801 --> 01:34:27,379
- Who gave you permission to leave?
- Nobody. I'm an adult. I have my passport.

867
01:34:27,714 --> 01:34:30,290
As Inspector General, you are
not authorized to leave the country.

868
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:34,079
- I resigned from my commission before I left.
- And I refused to accept your resignation.

869
01:34:34,382 --> 01:34:37,833
- Consequently, you risk a court-martial!
- Then present me in court-martial!

870
01:34:38,092 --> 01:34:44,284
This is it! Your letter to the
Pope requesting an annulment!

871
01:34:44,587 --> 01:34:48,084
...of a wedding that made
me laugh all over Europe!

872
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:51,203
My letter to the Holy Father is
my business and no one else's!

873
01:34:51,213 --> 01:34:55,209
For me, the Pope and the Archbishop of
Vienna are mere chaplains for the family.

874
01:34:55,503 --> 01:34:58,456
I will not tolerate either you or
anyone else interfering with our work,

875
01:34:58,793 --> 01:35:03,168
priest or not priest! And then,
your request rejected by Rome!

876
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:05,537
Can you humiliate us even more?

877
01:35:05,919 --> 01:35:08,161
- Were you told they refused?
- It wasn't necessary.

878
01:35:08,462 --> 01:35:12,457
They decided. They kept me
informed, like the head of the family.

879
01:35:12,797 --> 01:35:16,871
As for me, I will never allow your
involvement with this woman, this Vetsera.

880
01:35:17,129 --> 01:35:21,619
And never come back again
after setting foot in this Empire!

881
01:35:28,921 --> 01:35:30,910
Your Sï¿½lo?

882
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:34,788
As much as your Holy Roman Empire!

883
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:37,537
You can have your ministers
prepare the documentation.

884
01:35:37,835 --> 01:35:40,616
Before this month is over, I will
renounce my titles and leave this country...

885
01:35:40,626 --> 01:35:44,618
...once and forever.
- What if I don't accept your abdication request?

886
01:35:44,877 --> 01:35:50,456
- What about the passport, if it's taken?
- You can take it a step further.

887
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:56,956
Prisons are full, I'm sure Count
Taafe can find room for one more.

888
01:35:57,332 --> 01:36:02,787
I leave it to you, to the judgment
of your mistress... and her family...

889
01:36:03,085 --> 01:36:06,362
to whom it has only brought ruin and shame.

890
01:36:06,662 --> 01:36:11,533
And to your lover's children. Bastards! That
they will suffer humiliations wherever they go.

891
01:36:11,831 --> 01:36:14,533
With the blood of the
Habsburgs. More bastards.

892
01:36:14,787 --> 01:36:21,611
To be treated as inferiors who would only
have a superior debt. The mercy of marriage.

893
01:36:24,247 --> 01:36:28,985
I leave you to judge what I told you and what
you have now, have you forgotten what you have?

894
01:36:29,332 --> 01:36:31,407
Children with the knowledge
that their father is a

895
01:36:31,445 --> 01:36:35,280
an adulterer in his private life,
and a traitor in his public cause!

896
01:36:39,871 --> 01:36:43,814
These men out there are of all races.

897
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,864
Croats, Slovenians, Czechs, Magyars.

898
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,657
Their wages are low, they are far from home,

899
01:36:50,997 --> 01:36:57,107
but if I give the order, there isn't one
of them who doesn't give his life for me!

900
01:36:57,369 --> 01:37:03,236
Did you speak seriously with what you said before,
that Maria could not return to this country?

901
01:37:03,534 --> 01:37:08,955
I don't want to harm her or her family.

902
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:17,574
It is up to you to decide the damage
that may happen to her and her family.

903
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,320
She was willing to let him see
her, for a few days, perhaps.

904
01:37:23,577 --> 01:37:28,778
If I had known that afterwards,
they would never meet again.

905
01:37:30,407 --> 01:37:37,232
- You don't believe I love her.
- I don't believe this is important!

906
01:37:45,946 --> 01:37:51,865
Until the end of the month,
can I spend some time with her?

907
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:56,405
Neither polycias nor espines.

908
01:37:58,907 --> 01:38:01,687
If I have your word.

909
01:38:03,404 --> 01:38:05,857
You have my word.

910
01:39:25,107 --> 01:39:30,142
I have to sleep every
night. Where are we now?

911
01:39:31,315 --> 01:39:34,099
Mayerling.

912
01:39:59,813 --> 01:40:02,253
They don't have a straight
flight like in Scotland, MacAlish.

913
01:40:02,356 --> 01:40:05,106
You don't shoot right like you
do in Scotland, Your Highness.

914
01:40:05,395 --> 01:40:07,136
Filth! The light!

915
01:40:07,394 --> 01:40:10,355
It's late nights and foreign wines
instead of whiskey at reasonable hours.

916
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:12,342
fights!

917
01:40:14,495 --> 01:40:15,495
Ah!

918
01:40:15,765 --> 01:40:19,097
It's horrible! I hate this! I hate this!

919
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:22,382
Something I will never
be able to share! This kill!

920
01:40:22,724 --> 01:40:25,340
When I was little, my father thought
I was a man, because he liked...

921
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:27,636
to look at animals and study modern killing.

922
01:40:27,933 --> 01:40:31,346
Now I kill. Highness, to the right!

923
01:40:31,643 --> 01:40:33,549
On the edge of the forest...

924
01:40:34,436 --> 01:40:38,594
no! Please no! She is so cute. I shouldn't.

925
01:40:38,934 --> 01:40:44,467
- I must say, it doesn't make it easy for hunters.
- Not my intention.

926
01:40:45,269 --> 01:40:48,546
What else do you want me to do? - Anything.

927
01:40:48,891 --> 01:40:53,594
Nothing I can't do either. - Your Highness!

928
01:40:53,851 --> 01:40:57,295
Some friends of ours have
just arrived unexpectedly.

929
01:41:04,264 --> 01:41:09,217
- Johan...
- Karoli and I have just arrived from Hungary.

930
01:41:09,891 --> 01:41:12,557
Your Highness, tomorrow is
the biggest demonstration...

931
01:41:12,849 --> 01:41:15,253
that Budapest has ever seen.

932
01:41:15,559 --> 01:41:18,637
Do you know what they're painting
on the banners, and scoreboards?

933
01:41:18,892 --> 01:41:22,137
"Prince Rudolf of Austria to our King."

934
01:41:22,431 --> 01:41:25,632
Now it's time Your
Highness, you have to speak.

935
01:41:27,764 --> 01:41:32,052
Hoyos, you are Hungarian.
Tell him what that means.

936
01:41:33,805 --> 01:41:35,296
Karoli is here.

937
01:41:35,594 --> 01:41:38,924
This is the only way for
Hungary to remain in the Empire.

938
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:41,548
It's an attitude! It's an attitude, now!

939
01:41:44,218 --> 01:41:48,342
And what happens if the Emperor
sends his army to Hungary?

940
01:41:48,635 --> 01:41:52,582
Civil war! But with you there, as king,

941
01:41:52,929 --> 01:41:56,507
or viceroy, however
you want to call yourself...

942
01:41:56,761 --> 01:42:01,548
Who are those men? They
are friends. Whose friends?

943
01:42:02,342 --> 01:42:04,048
Ours.

944
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:08,588
Come and meet them. Come, and greet them.

945
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:11,883
Come and tell them you're with us.

946
01:42:12,175 --> 01:42:14,960
What are they called?

947
01:42:17,842 --> 01:42:21,672
One day, maybe, join us.

948
01:42:22,009 --> 01:42:25,584
I just hope it's not too late.

949
01:42:44,548 --> 01:42:48,081
Rudolf! Rudolf! I just killed,
which must be the biggest...

950
01:42:48,424 --> 01:42:52,794
and wildest wild boar seen
around here. Congratulations, but...

951
01:42:53,088 --> 01:42:55,578
I'm going back to Vienna to see my father.

952
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:59,044
Take Maria to my apartment
in Schönbrunn. Wait there for me.

953
01:42:59,337 --> 01:43:02,865
But there's the ball tonight, in
honor of the Prince of Wales.

954
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:07,790
- I want the Vetsera family to be invited.
- But Rudolph...

955
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,826
I think you've been complaining to your
friends about not being received in the Court.

956
01:43:13,089 --> 01:43:16,251
Well, tonight will be.

957
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:24,332
Crazy! Like all the Habsburgs?
Completely, raving and mad!

958
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:28,745
- Come... Come here, come here...
- What do you think you get with this?

959
01:43:31,212 --> 01:43:34,408
This is for the animals we adopt.

960
01:43:35,878 --> 01:43:39,323
Oh! It's so beautiful, so peaceful.

961
01:43:39,585 --> 01:43:44,917
- Remember what I told you? Snow?
- Yes, sleep soundly. I remember.

962
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:49,743
And the rain, always dancing.

963
01:43:52,754 --> 01:43:58,332
why? Why, what? your sigh. Your deep breath.

964
01:43:59,626 --> 01:44:07,626
It was the thought of Vienna. Despite
my mother's presence, I will return to Cï¿½rte.

965
01:44:11,332 --> 01:44:15,491
Am I not somehow making you unhappy?

966
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:21,909
- It's my style!
- It's good, because... I've never been so happy.

967
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:28,329
And I only wish that God twice bless me.

968
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:34,413
First have someone to love. And the
second? To be loved by the one I love.

969
01:44:48,912 --> 01:44:52,113
- Would you like some more tea?
- No, thanks, Loschek.

970
01:44:53,081 --> 01:44:57,117
Although the cookies were delicious,
they are so bad in appearance.

971
01:44:57,451 --> 01:45:03,071
Then there is nothing else that Your
Lordship desires. Just say one thing.

972
01:45:03,369 --> 01:45:06,781
- How long have you been with the Archduke?
- Since he was twelve.

973
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:12,568
- You were so lucky!
- Not when I was 12. It was unbearable.

974
01:45:12,951 --> 01:45:16,993
You are very fond of him. - Like you.

975
01:45:17,328 --> 01:45:21,238
If I may be free, Your Ladyship,
I am very fond of Your Highness.

976
01:45:22,619 --> 01:45:26,944
It was a beautiful thing to
say. Thank you, Loschek.

977
01:45:33,574 --> 01:45:36,736
Loschek! Can Your Highness announce me?

978
01:45:37,073 --> 01:45:40,773
It's impossible. Await the
Emperor, Your Majesty.

979
01:45:41,073 --> 01:45:44,652
Just tell him I dropped by unexpectedly,
so he can see how he's doing.

980
01:45:44,949 --> 01:45:48,312
Loschek, can you please
put this in the water.

981
01:45:51,323 --> 01:45:54,939
Well, since I'm here, I have
to leave you a message.

982
01:46:06,198 --> 01:46:09,195
Ah, forgive me, for bothering you.

983
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:17,144
Loschek, you should have
told me! And now leave us alone.

984
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:29,724
I wanted to know how my son was. I
see him so little. How does he look to you?

985
01:46:30,028 --> 01:46:34,271
You look a little worried,
Your Majesty. Tired out.

986
01:46:35,111 --> 01:46:40,979
Poor Rudolph. He was not the
man for this life imposed on him.

987
01:46:41,277 --> 01:46:43,981
I often wonder if anyone will be?

988
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:49,068
I never met you, mademoiselle.
I go out so little now.

989
01:46:49,406 --> 01:46:56,014
But I know my son loves her. Please sit...

990
01:46:59,983 --> 01:47:04,691
You are even more beautiful
than I was told. It's so young!

991
01:47:04,984 --> 01:47:09,225
How old are you? - I'm twenty, madam.

992
01:47:09,857 --> 01:47:15,440
Twenty! At twenty, I... was already unhappy,

993
01:47:15,734 --> 01:47:18,850
but, it was my wish not to die.

994
01:47:19,152 --> 01:47:22,480
Vienna is not for young
people. Stay away if you can.

995
01:47:22,817 --> 01:47:30,390
- I like the countryside better, Your Majesty.
- Me too, Rudolf and also his father.

996
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:34,017
Or that we are not,

997
01:47:34,313 --> 01:47:38,522
we have to be what they want us to be.

998
01:47:38,814 --> 01:47:42,308
At home the children play Kings and Queens,

999
01:47:42,604 --> 01:47:45,438
We played shepherds, sometimes even...

1000
01:47:46,731 --> 01:47:49,478
...circus performers.

1001
01:47:54,645 --> 01:48:02,644
Listen! Wait long enough to hear a door slam,

1002
01:48:03,188 --> 01:48:07,135
a servant dropped a spoon...

1003
01:48:07,438 --> 01:48:12,059
No, never, or what we decided,

1004
01:48:12,396 --> 01:48:20,396
you are never completely alone.
However, we are always very lonely.

1005
01:48:24,978 --> 01:48:28,805
You know what he told
me the day he got married?

1006
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:31,679
He said, "Mother, say a prayer for me."

1007
01:48:31,975 --> 01:48:35,673
And I said, "What prayer
should I pray for you?"

1008
01:48:35,976 --> 01:48:42,804
And he said, "Pray to
God that I never fall in love."

1009
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:46,508
Let me kiss you, my daughter.

1010
01:48:48,599 --> 01:48:51,055
You will be in my heart.

1011
01:50:20,674 --> 01:50:22,795
Good night, Helen. - Goodnight.

1012
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:26,289
- Baroness Vetsera seemed very nervous to me.
- She was never received in the Court before...

1013
01:50:26,299 --> 01:50:29,295
and suddenly she was
invited to a dance, no wonder!

1014
01:50:29,548 --> 01:50:34,171
- Will she know why?
- My mother was always the last to know.

1015
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:05,204
The grace of your presence
was a well-kept secret, Elizabeth.

1016
01:51:05,507 --> 01:51:08,373
Until the last moment,
even I myself wasn't sure.

1017
01:51:08,713 --> 01:51:13,705
You know I've been away, now that
I'm getting older I should go home...

1018
01:51:14,004 --> 01:51:17,746
Absurd! We must always
keep close to our friends.

1019
01:51:18,002 --> 01:51:21,501
Has the world ever seen
a more beautiful Empress?

1020
01:51:21,753 --> 01:51:24,206
How nice. I was no longer used to it.

1021
01:51:24,962 --> 01:51:29,869
But you can't, distract
yourself... dance a little. Taaf...

1022
01:51:30,169 --> 01:51:32,741
Yes Your Majesty? - Music, please.

1023
01:51:33,046 --> 01:51:37,997
If you are going to open the dance sir, I must
ask my mother for the second dance of the night.

1024
01:51:38,376 --> 01:51:41,126
Your father and I have to talk.

1025
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:47,823
- I'm sure you can replace your father.
- As a dancer, you can always take my place.

1026
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:54,394
- My dear, could you...
- I'm looking forward to talking to you,

1027
01:51:54,749 --> 01:51:58,115
But there are some things
we can't discuss in public.

1028
01:52:02,336 --> 01:52:07,370
Baroness Vetsera, may I ask your
permission for your daughter, Maria...

1029
01:52:07,667 --> 01:52:11,529
may you do me the honor of opening the ball.

1030
01:52:12,168 --> 01:52:15,576
Do I have your authorization?

1031
01:52:15,875 --> 01:52:19,700
If His Imperial Highness insists...

1032
01:52:41,498 --> 01:52:44,166
Your Majesty, I can't... - Keep calm!

1033
01:52:44,873 --> 01:52:48,948
Don't forget that you are
an Archducal of Austria.

1034
01:52:56,871 --> 01:53:00,781
Oh, how much longer? - Mary, look at me.

1035
01:53:01,203 --> 01:53:05,906
Maria... now smile. Smile.
I want people to see us.

1036
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:16,406
That's better. Now say something.

1037
01:53:17,619 --> 01:53:21,697
Good evening, Your
Highness. Goodnight My Love.

1038
01:53:23,996 --> 01:53:26,827
ï¿½, take me away... Please... Take me away...

1039
01:53:44,491 --> 01:53:50,937
This will not last. I give you my
word. It will not be allowed to last.

1040
01:54:12,199 --> 01:54:16,321
Your Majesty, allow me to introduce
you to Baroness Maria Vetsera,

1041
01:54:16,616 --> 01:54:21,814
whose fate has been a
matter of great interest to you.

1042
01:54:26,071 --> 01:54:30,979
You are very beautiful,
Baroness. And your youth...

1043
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:34,809
give him the rights to
expect everything from life.

1044
01:54:35,111 --> 01:54:38,478
Her Majesty is kind.

1045
01:54:39,694 --> 01:54:42,978
The Baroness and I have already met.

1046
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:47,317
I trust that our sympathy
was mutually sincere.

1047
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:50,147
Her Majesty is really kind.

1048
01:54:50,442 --> 01:54:55,778
I will return now. Maybe he'll
come visit me before you go.

1049
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:00,359
But not if it's too late. Good night.

1050
01:55:16,732 --> 01:55:22,433
I'm proud of you, Maria.
Heavens, how proud I am of you!

1051
01:55:23,483 --> 01:55:28,852
I hope one day we have children
and they can be proud of you.

1052
01:56:17,979 --> 01:56:19,519
holes!

1053
01:56:31,308 --> 01:56:33,134
Edward...

1054
01:56:39,267 --> 01:56:42,350
I need your help. You
have to let me go to England.

1055
01:56:42,685 --> 01:56:45,388
My dear friend, for a state
visit a reason is needed.

1056
01:56:45,686 --> 01:56:48,968
It's not a state visit,
it's to live there, forever.

1057
01:56:50,058 --> 01:56:54,383
When you think of England,
you see the white cliffs of Dover.

1058
01:56:54,727 --> 01:56:58,852
I see an old lady, but what problems
does she drag in her private life,

1059
01:56:59,143 --> 01:57:03,678
politically... But one day you
will be the king! And then...

1060
01:57:03,973 --> 01:57:07,552
Not even then will I be able to
receive you at my private parties,

1061
01:57:07,891 --> 01:57:10,677
to which I like to invite all those I want.

1062
01:57:10,931 --> 01:57:14,131
Where can I go? What can I do?

1063
01:57:16,684 --> 01:57:19,550
You have to do the same
thing I will do tomorrow night.

1064
01:57:19,804 --> 01:57:24,843
And what is that? - Back to my wife.

1065
01:57:28,681 --> 01:57:31,349
Bringing the relationship
openly public is crazy.

1066
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,004
- It's complete madness!
- I did it for a reason.

1067
01:57:34,306 --> 01:57:36,753
Showing the relationship openly,
and in plain sight, means that...

1068
01:57:36,763 --> 01:57:40,093
I never have to hide it under
the rug like a lazy maid again.

1069
01:57:40,429 --> 01:57:43,711
And now your father is
more determined than ever!

1070
01:57:44,013 --> 01:57:48,634
But how is it possible to resist his
eyes? That child is truly a marvel.

1071
01:57:48,930 --> 01:57:52,127
And I was counting on it,
to teach someone a lesson.

1072
01:57:52,426 --> 01:57:57,377
Especially someone with Madame Du
Barry habits. You should give him more time.

1073
01:57:57,676 --> 01:57:59,715
I'm sure I could wait for anything.

1074
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:03,090
Anything like my dad's deal
with Katarina Schratt? No thanks!

1075
01:58:03,385 --> 01:58:07,878
I want marriage, children, nothing like
a dirty romance hidden away in a corner.

1076
01:58:08,176 --> 01:58:14,672
- Marriage, and nothing else!
- I wish it only brought disaster to this life.

1077
01:58:14,927 --> 01:58:18,173
It's a night for compassion, humanity.

1078
01:58:18,468 --> 01:58:24,169
Because if I didn't want to, I wouldn't
stay in Vienna to share your bed,

1079
01:58:24,426 --> 01:58:28,420
I have no right to ask, no mind
for an unnatural life of celibacy.

1080
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:35,381
I know this marriage you want,
even a morganic marriage...

1081
01:58:35,635 --> 01:58:41,962
I will have! I will not deprive
myself. ï¿½ wedding or...

1082
01:58:42,259 --> 01:58:47,592
Or what, my son? He's a
child when he talks like that.

1083
01:58:47,923 --> 01:58:53,081
I tell you mom, if they control
me, they end up taking me too far...

1084
01:58:53,384 --> 01:58:59,792
Do you think your father doesn't know what he
does to you? What are you doing to yourself?

1085
01:59:01,462 --> 01:59:05,708
Because in your stubbornness
you are practically the same man.

1086
01:59:06,046 --> 01:59:10,204
What he thinks is wrong,
you think too, my love.

1087
01:59:10,506 --> 01:59:12,495
And get away from those
windows. You die of pneumonia.

1088
01:59:12,505 --> 01:59:15,833
Or I die.

1089
01:59:18,795 --> 01:59:21,827
Mother, I say this to
you, and to no one else.

1090
01:59:22,335 --> 01:59:26,913
There is only one last hope left for me.
Hungary. They want me for their King.

1091
01:59:27,212 --> 01:59:29,453
I could go now... I don't
want to hear anymore,

1092
01:59:30,878 --> 01:59:36,792
but hear me! Hear what I say. Get
the girl out of the country! And hurry!

1093
01:59:37,171 --> 01:59:43,283
They can send it wherever... wherever
they want to send it, and never come back.

1094
01:59:43,543 --> 01:59:49,041
You know that in this family nothing is
out of the question. Are you listening to me?

1095
01:59:49,335 --> 01:59:56,574
I heard. I have to go now.
Thanks for what you're trying to do.

1096
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:06,957
And tell the little one that I truly
love him, because she truly loves him.

1097
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:12,997
Remember that story I told
you about never falling in love?

1098
02:00:13,251 --> 02:00:18,071
And now I fell in love.
And I am a very happy man.

1099
02:00:18,375 --> 02:00:23,660
No, no, you're not that...
but you're a very good man.

1100
02:00:29,623 --> 02:00:32,408
Good night, mother. - Farewell, my son.

1101
02:00:53,246 --> 02:00:54,574
highness Your Highness...

1102
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:15,362
Excuse me for coming here, Your
Highness, but I have to leave tonight.

1103
02:01:15,705 --> 02:01:19,068
- Maybe it's already too late.
- You can't afford to be.

1104
02:01:19,368 --> 02:01:22,566
Your orders are for Karoli to delay the
uprisings in Budapest until next week,

1105
02:01:22,825 --> 02:01:24,615
until I can get there.

1106
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:28,241
And will you agree that we announce
that you will be King of Hungary?

1107
02:01:28,537 --> 02:01:32,068
It is the only way to make
Hungary remain in the Empire.

1108
02:01:32,369 --> 02:01:35,486
I suppose all men must
justify their own reason.

1109
02:01:35,742 --> 02:01:40,282
Karolj insists on his
signature on this proclamation.

1110
02:01:41,326 --> 02:01:45,450
And, as proof, that you give me your ring.

1111
02:01:48,743 --> 02:01:51,523
I suppose the pencil signature is legal.

1112
02:01:51,784 --> 02:01:55,229
- This one is just for Karoli to see.
- Don't take my word for it anymore.

1113
02:01:55,573 --> 02:02:00,561
Your Highness! I can't say I
blame him. Go as fast as possible.

1114
02:02:00,947 --> 02:02:03,352
I don't want a revolt with no one to lead.

1115
02:02:03,656 --> 02:02:09,074
Won't you change your mind? Are
you sure? This is extremely serious.

1116
02:02:09,491 --> 02:02:13,815
Someday everything will
become extremely serious.

1117
02:02:14,949 --> 02:02:17,566
Hoyos, don't waste time. See you soon.

1118
02:02:24,614 --> 02:02:26,816
To Budapest!

1119
02:02:31,488 --> 02:02:34,317
Thank God! I'm so glad
to be back in Mayerling.

1120
02:02:34,611 --> 02:02:38,652
So did I... it was a terrible night.

1121
02:02:41,697 --> 02:02:43,824
Maria. - Yea.

1122
02:02:43,861 --> 02:02:48,984
Do everything for me? - Yea. And you?

1123
02:02:51,364 --> 02:02:53,732
I just did.

1124
02:04:10,106 --> 02:04:13,054
Are you trying to kill us? Continues!

1125
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:15,677
Get out!

1126
02:04:27,145 --> 02:04:28,686
Books?

1127
02:04:30,727 --> 02:04:35,018
- You mean, are we free to go?
- Yes, they are. At the moment.

1128
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:48,051
By... by the way, Count Hoyos. I
thought I should return this to the owner!

1129
02:04:54,393 --> 02:04:57,721
So, Count Taafe let him go? - Why not?

1130
02:04:57,977 --> 02:05:01,507
The Budapest uprising is over.

1131
02:05:03,016 --> 02:05:05,388
You must know.

1132
02:05:05,932 --> 02:05:12,296
There's nothing left to do. Did
you find out what happened?

1133
02:05:12,766 --> 02:05:16,049
Count Taafe had six
battalions, ready and waiting.

1134
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:19,471
Hundreds of ammo boxes for each soldier.
And the officers were not Hungarians.

1135
02:05:19,765 --> 02:05:23,095
It wasn't just a defeat, it was a massacre.

1136
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:27,928
Prince Johan? - Nobody knows where.

1137
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:37,724
Karoli? - He committed suicide.

1138
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:46,470
Taafe returned the ring, but not
the statement that was attached.

1139
02:05:48,434 --> 02:05:50,800
He still has the papers.

1140
02:05:51,554 --> 02:05:55,877
I wonder if a pencil signature will be legal?

1141
02:05:56,177 --> 02:05:59,461
What we will never know.

1142
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,168
What did Karoli say that day?

1143
02:06:05,926 --> 02:06:10,915
"One day, maybe you'll join us."

1144
02:06:32,966 --> 02:06:38,799
- Do I have to wait then, until you come back?
- It would be a long, long time.

1145
02:06:40,093 --> 02:06:46,623
- An impossible time to wait.
- Better yet, I'll go with you.

1146
02:06:49,839 --> 02:06:56,255
What if that's impossible? Impossible
how? I followed you everywhere.

1147
02:07:01,132 --> 02:07:04,248
It's not allowed, I can't let you go.

1148
02:07:04,548 --> 02:07:06,834
Another, Bratfisch, another.

1149
02:07:07,132 --> 02:07:10,129
- Loschek, get yourself a glass.
- Your Majesty...

1150
02:07:10,465 --> 02:07:13,415
Come, I want you to drink with me.

1151
02:07:21,881 --> 02:07:25,408
Your Highness, it's not
something I should say...

1152
02:07:25,713 --> 02:07:28,961
but when you ask me to drink with you,

1153
02:07:29,255 --> 02:07:31,704
gave me the freedom
to talk to you man to man,

1154
02:07:32,004 --> 02:07:34,539
then as a prince's servant.

1155
02:07:34,961 --> 02:07:37,878
You know the many years I've been with you.

1156
02:07:38,167 --> 02:07:42,034
I've never seen him so happy as tonight.

1157
02:07:42,545 --> 02:07:49,582
With your permission, Your
Highness I drink the... the...!

1158
02:08:04,832 --> 02:08:08,411
For all these years you've
been with me, Luscheck,

1159
02:08:08,707 --> 02:08:11,990
It's the first time something has
broken. Second time, Your Highness.

1160
02:08:12,290 --> 02:08:17,164
Have you forgotten how you
shot a razor that hit the mirror?

1161
02:08:27,334 --> 02:08:30,615
Are you trying to tell me something,

1162
02:08:30,999 --> 02:08:34,032
but still not saying.

1163
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:38,241
Let me say it for you.

1164
02:08:38,955 --> 02:08:42,320
If you leave, it doesn't matter where,

1165
02:08:42,664 --> 02:08:45,531
But if it is, I'm never coming back.

1166
02:08:45,829 --> 02:08:48,613
Have you ever thought about
what will happen to me...?

1167
02:08:48,914 --> 02:08:51,828
wandering around the world? Alone?

1168
02:08:52,579 --> 02:08:59,406
A strange world, a lonely
place, because it won't be there.

1169
02:09:00,664 --> 02:09:03,494
Why can't I be.

1170
02:09:03,831 --> 02:09:09,531
They won't let me live with you,
and I won't want to live without you.

1171
02:09:09,828 --> 02:09:14,451
I understand. And I've always been
trying to make you realize that I understand.

1172
02:09:15,288 --> 02:09:22,028
My God, why can't anyone
understand how much I love you?

1173
02:09:58,990 --> 02:10:01,061
Good night my friends.

1174
02:10:02,322 --> 02:10:07,312
Until the next time we
meet, may God keep you.

1175
02:10:19,364 --> 02:10:22,399
Just the thought of the dark... Nothing more.

1176
02:11:10,570 --> 02:11:12,559
What are you doing?

1177
02:11:15,942 --> 02:11:18,477
I ended up anyway.

1178
02:11:22,275 --> 02:11:28,025
Must be the heat in the fireplace...
my eyes... can't stay open.

1179
02:11:30,442 --> 02:11:34,849
Sleep then. - I don't want to. Not yet.

1180
02:11:35,482 --> 02:11:38,400
I can't help it, you know?

1181
02:11:41,524 --> 02:11:44,143
You know, if you want to change
your mind, you still have time.

1182
02:11:44,566 --> 02:11:52,565
Never without you. would not
live. Just one thing please... Yes?

1183
02:11:56,606 --> 02:11:57,885
I don't...

1184
02:11:58,938 --> 02:12:03,845
I don't want to know... when. I'm scared.

1185
02:12:05,148 --> 02:12:08,264
Not much, but scared.

1186
02:12:10,272 --> 02:12:14,051
Me too. - You have no reason to be.

1187
02:12:14,352 --> 02:12:19,061
I am with you... always will be.

1188
02:12:19,438 --> 02:12:25,304
I shouldn't feel lonely.
much less just... in the dark.

1189
02:12:25,648 --> 02:12:28,136
That's why...

1190
02:12:35,564 --> 02:12:38,724
I am the happiest man in Austria,

1191
02:12:39,019 --> 02:12:42,267
I will adapt to be the luckiest.

1192
02:12:42,519 --> 02:12:48,433
We are both fortunate for one thing,
it's nice to be able to say to someone:

1193
02:12:49,474 --> 02:12:54,845
"I will adore you forever,"
and you know that's true.

1194
02:13:07,477 --> 02:13:09,596
Eternally...

1195
02:13:11,476 --> 02:13:16,761
I think like you. You were my first love...

1196
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:25,881
I would... sincerely like
to see you, one last time.

1197
02:13:26,265 --> 02:13:31,254
Remember what I used to tell you.
A few nights before falling asleep,

1198
02:13:31,557 --> 02:13:37,219
I know that the next day I will see you.

1199
02:13:40,098 --> 02:13:43,926
Yes... I know I will see you.

1200
02:13:47,646 --> 02:13:51,921
Till tomorrow, then - Tomorrow..

1201
02:13:55,887 --> 02:13:59,749
I think I'd like to sleep now.

1202
02:14:02,866 --> 02:14:06,378
Goodnight My Love.

1203
02:14:13,222 --> 02:14:18,753
Maria Vetsera... I love you forever.

1204
02:16:21,711 --> 02:16:23,286
Forgive me, Your Highness.

1205
02:16:23,585 --> 02:16:26,252
I thought I heard a shot.

1206
02:16:26,585 --> 02:16:33,244
I didn't shoot it, Loschek. Some...
game wardens... in the woods...

1207
02:16:33,501 --> 02:16:36,997
You are probably right,
Your Highness. Excuse me.
