Pretty sweet, right?

[woman] I mean, look at him.

Look at that face.
He's speechless.

He loves it!

Yes! Thank you! Finally, huh?

That was something.

389
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,633
Right, Malik?

390
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:34,592
Listen, guys,
I'm a ballplayer.

391
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,675
You know,
and athletes acting,

392
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:38,342

This is all just...</i>

<i>- It's just not me.</i>

395

And I can't afford to take
time away from the game.

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,633
[Malik] Whoa, Bron.

397

<i>Nah, nah, nah.</i>

<i>With all due respect,
with all due respect,</i>

401
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,217
<i>this idea
is just straight-up bad.</i>

402
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,717
<i>That algorithm is busted.</i>

403
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,383
[chuckles] Busted?

404
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,800
[LeBron] <i>It's among the worst</i>

Top five, easily.

406
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:07,092
Okay. Thank you. Thank you!

407
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,592
That's exactly
what I was think...

408
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,258
You're saying
what I'm thinking.

409
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:12,508
This is trash, this algorithm.

410
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,217
You're cancelled, algorithm!

411
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,342
[man] <i>What a terrible idea.</i>
<i>So stupid.</i>

412
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:17,883
[woman] <i>So stupid.</i>
<i>This is what happens when...</i>

413
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,133
Pete, tell me he did not
just say "stupid"!

414
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:21,717
[Pete] Uh-oh.

415
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,342
<i>I don't know. I think
the algorithm's pretty cool.</i>

416
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,467
<i>I've got a question.</i>

417
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,342
<i>Is it a heuristic algorithm</i>

418
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,508
<i>or some kind of
matrix variant?</i>

419
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:34,092
[chuckles] Dom,
using the medulla oblongata.

420
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:37,258
I think we got a little
Stevie Jobs on our hands.

421
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,300
Yeah, I'm actually building
my own video game.

422
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:41,092
Oh, nice, your own video game.

423
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,258
You heard of the E3
Game Design Camp, right?

424
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,800
Yeah.

425
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:46,508
Well, there's gonna be one
next weekend, and I'm going.

426
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:47,967
There's gonna be a whole bunch
of other coders there.

427
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,092
Hold... Dom.

428
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:50,092
I'm actually
looking forward...

429
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,383
No. You can't go to that.

430
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,008
Basketball camp
is next weekend.

431
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:57,258
I'm not going
to basketball camp, Dad.

432
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,842
Dom, you don't
have to be scared.

433
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,008
You got amazing potential
on the court,

434
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,550
and I can help you get there.

435
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,008
That's not what I want, Dad.

436
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:09,925
[LeBron] Dom.

437
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,967
Wonderful to meet...

443
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,508
So, is this a hard pass or...?

[grunts in frustration]

00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,842
[in distorted voice] Who does
this guy think he is? Huh?

446
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:36,633
Rejecting me? Humiliating me?

Okay.

450
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,925
All right.

451
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,508
I tried being a team player,

452
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,842
but those days are over.

453
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,675
I'm done playing
by everybody else's rules.

454
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:59,550
It is my game now.

00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,092
Dom!

456
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,717
I'm your father.
When I say stop, you stop.

You know I can't let you
back out of camp like that.

461
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,592
You made a commitment.

462
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,800
You make me hate basketball.

463
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,717
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

Everything is always

465
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,883
You never let me do
what I wanna do.

466

You never let me just do me.

467
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,508
[LeBron] "Do me"?

468
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:45,800
You think I got to "do me"

524
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:42,342
Oh, you're that guy
from the video.

525
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:44,300
Yes, I am. [chuckles]

526
00:22:44,383 --> 00:22:46,342
And this... Ha-ha.

527
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,383
Oh, gentlemen, this...

528
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,633
this is
the Warner Bros. Serververse.

529
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:55,050
Just make you feel
all insignificant, don't it?

530
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,758
[scoffs]
Are all computers like this?

531
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,258
Dom?

532
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:01,925
- Dom?
- [Al G.] Uh-oh.

533
00:23:02,008 --> 00:23:04,092
What'd you do to my son?
Where's Dom?

534
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,342
Who's Dom?

535
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,217
[chuckles] Dude, chill out.

536
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,675
You're gonna get
your son back.

537
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,342
There better not be a "but"
at the end of...

538
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,342
But there's something
you're gonna do for me first.

539
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,467
Like what?

540
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,258
You know, you, uh... [scoffs]

541
00:23:18,342 --> 00:23:20,717
You really shouldn't have
rejected my ideas back there.

542
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:23,425
That was a mistake.

543
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:24,717
Now, I'm afraid you're gonna

544
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
have to help me
fulfill my destiny.

545
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,133
Listen, man,

546
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,675
if you don't produce my son
in five seconds...

547
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:30,633
Eh-eh! Uh-uh. No, no, no.

548
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,383
All that pointing
and aggression.

549
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,758
No, no, no. You're not
running things in here.

550
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:36,800
I am the king of this domain.

551
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,758
I'm not your coach.

552
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:40,842
Now, the only way you're
getting your son back

553
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,425
is if you and I play a little
game called basketball.

554
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:46,300
[scoffs] You wanna play me
in basketball?

555
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,217
Well, you didn't wanna be
in the movies.

556
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,550
You wanted to
"focus on your game."

557
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:51,633
Well, guess what?

558
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:54,133
Now you can focus
on this game.

559
00:23:54,217 --> 00:23:57,300
You and me, we're gonna
put on a show, baby.

560
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:59,217
We are gonna play a game
of basketball

561
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,050
in front of the largest
captive audience ever.

562
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,800
All your followers,

563
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:06,717
they're all gonna be watching.

564
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,883
And when they see
the two of us together,

565
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:13,050
I will finally step out
of the shadows

566
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,675
and into the light.

567
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:16,467
And the entire world
is gonna know

568
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,175
the name of King Al G. Rhythm.
[chuckles]

569
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:23,758
[sighs] But you know what,
I'm a good sport.

570
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,842
Tell you what, if you win,

571
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:28,508
you and your son can
skedaddle on out of here.

572
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,175
And what if I lose?

573
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:31,633
Yeah. Wrinkle.

574
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:35,175
If you lose...
Well, when you lose,

575
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:36,550
you're just gonna
have to stay here

576
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:38,842
in the Serververse with me...

577
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:43,342
[echoing]
forever and ever and ever

578
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:44,675
and ever.

579
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:46,717
- [Pete] Oh!
- [Al G. chuckles]

580
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,508
So, you better play
like you mean it.

581
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:49,883
You know,
you think this is a game.

582
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:51,258
I'm calling
the authorities on you.

583
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:52,217
'Cause what you got
going on here...

584
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,508
On this phone?

585
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,008
How'd you do that?

586
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,008
LeBron, why are you worried
about the authorities

587
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:59,675
when you should be out there
looking for a team?

588
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:01,800
Pete, send this clown
to the rejects.

589
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,425
Wait...

590
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,467
[screaming]

591
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,633
[chuckles]
I guess he fell for it.

592
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:14,175
[continues screaming]

593
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,050
[Rick Blaine]
<i>Here's looking at you, kid.</i>

594
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:21,383
[distant screaming]

595
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,300
[LeBron] No, no, no, no, no!

596
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:26,592
- What is happening?
- [indistinct singing]

597
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:28,675
[Wicked Witch]
<i>I'll get you, my pretty.</i>

598
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,675
[LeBron continues screaming]

599
00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:37,425
[up-tempo orchestral music
playing]

600
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:39,550
[LeBron] No, no,
no, no, no, no!

601
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:44,092
[continues screaming]

602
00:25:53,383 --> 00:25:55,467
[soft music playing]

603
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,633
[pants]

604
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,800
What is this?

605
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,758
[gasps]
I'm shorter than Kevin Hart!

606
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:13,925
No, no, no! [blows]

607
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,925
- [legs whirring]
- [yells]

608
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,800
What the...? I'm a cartoon?

609
00:26:21,883 --> 00:26:23,925
Is this where the game
is gonna happen?

610
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:29,050
[clock chiming in distance]

611
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,633
Where is everybody?

612
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,633
Hello? [echoes]

613
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,258
Hello?

614
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:41,508
Hello?

615
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,592
[loudly] Hello?

616
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:47,842
[wind whistling]

617
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:52,050
"Rabbit season"?

618
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,383
[deep rumbling]

619
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,342
- [muffled explosion]
- What the...?

620
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,050
Ahh! Get away!
Leave me alone!

621
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,133
Somebody help!

622
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:05,425
- What's up, Doc?
- [screams]

623
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:08,675
Duck season!

624
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,758
- Bugs Bunny?
- [branch breaks]

625
00:27:11,842 --> 00:27:12,842
Whoa!

626
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,092
Bugs! I can't believe...

627
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,592
Bring it in, man.

628
00:27:19,675 --> 00:27:22,175
Listen, I need your help.

629
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:24,383
Eh, you missed your cue.

630
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:27,675
Oh. Rabbit season.

631
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,300
All right, here. Now say,

632
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:30,967
[mimicking Elmer]
"I'm huntin' wabbits..."

633
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,550
[in normal voice]
...and try to chase me.

634
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:38,092
Bugs, wait!

635
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:39,425
Come back! [grunts]

636
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:44,508
[sighs]

637
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:46,717
- I should've seen that coming.
- [engine roaring]

638
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,008
- [yelps]
- [Bugs Bunny] Coming through!

639
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,967
[LeBron screaming]

640
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:54,883
Say, have I seen you
somewhere?

641
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,383
Hey, you're that famous
basketball guy.

642
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,883
Come on,
aren't you LeBron James?

643
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,217
[screaming resumes]

644
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:07,300
Bugs Bunny knows who I am?

645
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:08,717
[tires screeching]

646
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,842
Of course.

647
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,467
I may live
in a hole in the ground,

648
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,342
but we still get TNT.

649
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,508
Oh, my God, is that a...?

650
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,425
Yep. Cover your ears, Doc.

651
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,883
[LeBron] Why would you do that?

652
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,633
- [engine roaring]
- [LeBron screams]

653
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:29,425
I'm a Tune, Doc.
I can survive anything.

654
00:28:31,508 --> 00:28:34,008
I'm not a Tune! [echoing]

655
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:35,425
No, no, no! Ahhh!

656
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:36,633
Ouch!

657
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,383
Ouch!
Ouch!

658
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:40,550
Ouch!

659
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:44,175
[grunting]

660
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,342
[splutters]

661
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:47,300
I do not understand
this world.

662
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:51,258
Eh, my bad, Doc.

663
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:55,008
[LeBron grunting]

664
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,300
[spits] How long
have you been alone here?

665
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,383
Alone? You're never alone

666
00:29:02,467 --> 00:29:04,258
when you got friends
like mine, Doc.

667
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,425
- Ain't that right, Porky?
- [LeBron] Uh...

668
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,383
That's just
a pile of pumpkins.

669
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,550
[gasps] Porky, did you hear
what he just called you?

670
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,883
So, what brings you
to Tune World, Doc?

671
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:19,342
- [grunts]
- Torn meniscus?

672
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,467
- [screams]
- Midlife crisis?

673
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:24,550
Ran out of teams to play for?

674
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:30,550
[grunting]

675
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:34,050
Uh... All I know is a computer
dude kidnapped my son,

676
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,217
and I have to play basketball
to get him back.

677
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,050
His name is Al G. Rhythm?

678
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,133
Did you say Al G. Riddim?

679
00:29:42,217 --> 00:29:44,508
[horse whinnying in distance]

680
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:46,967
Yeah, that's the guy.
Rhythm, Riddim...

681
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,300
Whatever.

682
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:49,758
[in Southern accent]
That nefarious nimrod

683
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:52,300
nixed my nearest and dearest
from Tune World.

684
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:53,633
He kicked them out?

685
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:56,175
Well, not exactly.

686
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,592
He buttered them up,

687
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:59,758
<i>saying they were
wasting their time.</i>

688
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,300
<i>That there was
much more to see</i>

689
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,467
<i>in the Serververse
than old Tune World.</i>

690
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,925
<i>Made 'em turn their backs on
who they really were.</i>

691
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,675
<i>They all left, all of them.</i>

692
00:30:14,175 --> 00:30:17,800
And I wish them all the best
in their new endeavors.

693
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:21,300
Ah, man. Sorry, Bugs.
That's terrible.

694
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:22,592
Family's everything.

695
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Yep.

696
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,258
Family.

697
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:30,050
Well, Bugs Bunny,
I need to assemble

698
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,842
an elite team
of A-plus ballplayers

699
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,675
to help crush this Al G. guy.

700
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:37,300
And I need to do it before
that game clock runs down.

701
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:39,383
- [clock chimes]
- Hol... Hold up, Doc.

702
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,133
[in normal tone]
So, you want me,

703
00:30:41,217 --> 00:30:42,717
a talking cartoon bunny,

704
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,342
to play with you,
an NBA superstar,

705
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:48,175
in a high-stakes
basketball game?

706
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,342
Sounds awfully familiar.

707
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,717
Who are you talking to?

708
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,383
But, yeah,
that actually sums it up well.

709
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:57,217
Mmm. I think I know a way
that can help the both of us.

710
00:30:58,342 --> 00:31:01,383
I declare this land
for planet Earth.

711
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:02,967
[distant whirring]

712
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:13,592
[door beeps]

713
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,217
[Marvin]
Not so fast, furry creature.

714
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,925
- [grunts] Excuse me.
- [barks]

715
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,258
Marvin the Martian?

716
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,425
For real?

717
00:31:35,508 --> 00:31:38,758
[Marvin] I claim this planet
in the name of Mars.

718
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:41,883
[gasps] My goodness.
My mistake, partner.

719
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,758
I thought this land
was in the clear.

720
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,508
Well, we'll just get back
in our ship

721
00:31:46,592 --> 00:31:47,967
and out of your way.

722
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,092
[Marvin]
Oh, it's quite all right.

723
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,092
Everyone makes mistakes.

724
00:31:52,175 --> 00:31:53,633
Come on. Let's boogie.

725
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:55,342
What? You're stealing his
ship. I didn't agree to this.

726
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:56,592
[Marvin] My ship!

727
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:59,300
[grunts angrily]
Blasted rabbit.

728
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:00,425
[gun powers up]

729
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,383
Whoa, whoa!

730
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:09,133
Bugs! Help! Help! Whoa!

731
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:10,550
[Marvin] Take this, rabbit.

732
00:32:11,258 --> 00:32:12,300
Back at ya.

733
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,050
Huh?

734
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,842
[grunting]

735
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:16,967
You coming, Doc?

736
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,383
Or would you rather hang back

737
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:19,883
with a cranky Martian
and his space mutt?

738
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,008
Just watch out for the...

739
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,133
Just watch out for the...
[grunts]

740
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,258
I just said, watch out for...

741
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:24,425
- [thud]
- Bugs!

742
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:28,342
[Marvin grunts]

743
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:31,967
[Marvin] You have
made me very angry.

744
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,883
- Very angry, indeed.
- [barks]

745
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,800
[R&B music playing]

746
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,967
[Dom] This place is awesome.

747
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,425
[Al G.] It really is.

748
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,633
Wait, where's my dad?

749
00:32:44,717 --> 00:32:45,883
Your dad?

750
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,383
Oh! He's out there
looking for a team.

751
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,050
- A team?
- Yeah.

752
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,967
He challenged me
to a basketball game.

753
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,425
I mean, that's weird, right?

754
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,550
He just left?

755
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,383
Kind of his M.O., right?
[chuckles]

756
00:32:57,467 --> 00:33:00,092
I mean, he left Cleveland,
he left Miami.

757
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:01,842
He left Cleveland again.

758
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:03,925
Look out, Lakers, huh?
[chuckles]

759
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,967
Come on,
don't look so sad, Prince.

760
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,300
I mean, you don't need

761
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:10,342
your old man
bossing you around anyway.

762
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,675
Look at where you are.

763
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,842
This is the greatest view
in the entire Serververse.

764
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,842
Your old man is missing out.

765
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,967
[Dom] It is pretty amazing.

766
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,092
Who built this?

767
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:22,883
[Al G.]
Well, someone brilliant.

768
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,758
Visionary.
Incredibly good looking.

769
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:26,925
Modest.

770
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:29,217
With a multitudinous
vocabulary.

771
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,383
Hint, you're looking
right at him, kid. [laughs]

772
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:34,925
But all
my extraordinary gifts,

773
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:36,592
they're nothing
compared to yours.

774
00:33:36,675 --> 00:33:37,717
Yeah, right.

775
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,967
It's true, Dom.

776
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,217
I saw you back there
in that boardroom

777
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,425
through some camera-phones,

778
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:42,592
and a printer,
and a fax machine,

779
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:43,967
and a thermostat.

780
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,342
It's very clear
how smart you are.

781
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,675
[Pete babbling]

782
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:50,383
And Pete tells me
that you hate video games.

783
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,717
- [babbling]
- You create video games.

784
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,758
- Why don't you enunciate?
- [imitates Al G. mockingly]

785
00:33:54,842 --> 00:33:56,217
How many times do we
have to go through this?

786
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,258
I'm the problem?

787
00:33:57,342 --> 00:33:58,550
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

788
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,508
- [Pete groans]
- Sorry.

789
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:02,383
Heard you made
your own character, too.

790
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:06,675
Yeah, but he got deleted
because of some stupid glitch.

791
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:09,133
Ah, don't worry about that.
We can rebuild him.

792
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:11,342
- You could?
- Absolutely.

793
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,758
Make him greater than he was.

794
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,425
You wouldn't
even have to lift a finger.

795
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:17,217
There's a shortcut for
everything in the Serververse.

796
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,592
What?

797
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,092
Aw.

798
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:24,925
Thinking of your dad again,
huh? How he's always...

799
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,717
"You can't be great
without putting in work."

800
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,092
Yeah. How did you know that?

801
00:34:30,175 --> 00:34:31,592
I know a lot about you, Dom.

802
00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,925
Any device with a camera,
I can see you.

803
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:35,092
If it's got a mic,

804
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,133
[clicks tongue]
I can hear you.

805
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:40,467
Hey, let's get a look
at that game of yours.

806
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:45,800
- [vehicle horn blares]
- [metal clanging]

807
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,467
[Bugs Bunny] Captain's log,
Captain James T. Bunny.

808
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,008
Intergalactic space traveler
on a five-year mission.

809
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,800
My crew has been scattered

810
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:04,133
to the far, far reaches
of the Serververse.

811
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:07,467
Marooned on strange,
inhospitable worlds.

812
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,467
I've commandeered
Marvin's ship in an effort

813
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,300
to reassemble the team.

814
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,592
[LeBron] Yo, Bugs.
Check it out.

815
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:18,092
Look what I found.

816
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:22,592
[alarm blaring]

817
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:25,883
Oh, that's not good.

818
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,092
Were you saying something?

819
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:32,300
Uh, I was just asking you...

820
00:35:39,592 --> 00:35:41,842
Hey, what's that for, Doc?

821
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:43,008
[LeBron] Gotta make a list.

822
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:44,342
We're gonna need
the most powerful

823
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:45,633
Warner Bros. characters
for this team.

824
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:48,217
Now, let's see.
Who to get? Hmm.

825
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,425
Gotta start with Superman.

826
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,050
Man, I could've used him
on the Cavs.

827
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:54,008
Ooh. King Kong.
He'd be a beast on the boards.

828
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:56,467
Yeah, listen, Doc...

829
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,675
Try not to get your hopes up
too much.

830
00:35:58,758 --> 00:35:59,925
You might not be able to get

831
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,592
all those top guys
for the team.

832
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:03,425
This ain't the Miami Heat,
you know.

833
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,342
We're gonna need
a strong power forward.

834
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:06,675
Iron Giant.

835
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:08,508
Put him on the same team
as his hero, Superman.

836
00:36:08,592 --> 00:36:10,217
I'm just saying
it might be good

837
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,967
to have a backup plan.

838
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:14,592
Wow.

839
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,717
This Serververse is massive.

840
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,717
So many different worlds
to explore.

841
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,008
I wish Dom was here
to see this.

842
00:36:23,758 --> 00:36:26,467
So, how come you stayed
on Tune World?

843
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,842
[sighs]

844
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,883
Tune World is my home.

845
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,050
It's the only place
where I can be me.

846
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:35,050
- Where I belong.
- [LeBron] Yo!

847
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,883
Is that Harry Potter World?

848
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:39,967
<i>Awesome!</i>

849
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,092
Hufflepuff? I knew it!

850
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,717
Nerd alert.

851
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,633
[LeBron] Oh, yeah! Metropolis.

852
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,383
I can't wait to see
what I turn into here.

853
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,383
Oh, it's gonna be
somebody dope.

854
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,508
[sirens wailing]

855
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:55,883
[engine revving]

856
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,342
Robin? I'm freaking Robin?

857
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:04,717
And why are we chasing
a runaway train?

858
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,342
[horn blares]

859
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:07,842
[people gasping]

860
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:11,050
We're in DC World, Doc.

861
00:37:11,133 --> 00:37:13,133
And where there's trouble,

862
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:15,842
- there's superheroes.
- Whoa!

863
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,258
[muffled grunting] Hmm?

864
00:37:20,342 --> 00:37:22,675
["Superman Theme" playing]

865
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:26,008
Gadzooks!

866
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:28,925
Some despicable villain
tied up the driver.

867
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:30,675
[stuttering] Yeah, sorry.

868
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:33,050
Unless someone
stops this thing,

869
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,508
- it'll crash straight into...
- [beeping]

870
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:39,175
...an orphanage. Of course.

871
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,508
[stuttering]
This is not good.

872
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,050
Luckily, Super Duck
is here to save the...

873
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,175
Cut!

874
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:48,717
What are you
doing here, rabbit?

to the one they call Al G.,

1055
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:32,133
and save the son of The Bron.

1056
00:45:32,217 --> 00:45:34,258
- Hey, guys!
- [Tune Squad] Lola!

1057
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:35,300
Hi, Lola.

1058
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:36,383
[Lola] Good to see you!

1059
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,133
Yo, Bugs, you coming?

1060
00:45:38,217 --> 00:45:39,675
[upbeat music playing]

1061
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:44,217
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1062
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,425
- Yeah, Bugs! Here we go.
- [Bugs Bunny gasps]

1063
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:52,175
[Dom] Nah, nah.

1064
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:54,342
Oh, I got the ball. Let's go.

1065
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:56,008
- No.
- I got you now.

1066
00:45:56,092 --> 00:45:57,300
[Dom] Oh. Ah.

00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:02,133
- You dunked on me? Man...
- [chuckles]

1069
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,133
I still can't believe you made
this by yourself, Dom.

1070
00:46:05,217 --> 00:46:06,925
I mean,
people need to see this.

1071
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:09,425
You're not just a prince,
you're a wizard.

1072
00:46:09,508 --> 00:46:10,508
Come here.

1073
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:13,717
Wow.

1074
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:17,258
[Dom] That's Diana Taurasi.

1075
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,675
[Al G.] How'd you build her?

1076
00:46:18,758 --> 00:46:20,383
- [Anthony Davis] Yo, Dame!
- What's good, bro?

1077
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:22,133
[Dom] <i>Dad hooked me up</i>

1081
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,300
Game?

1082
00:46:28,383 --> 00:46:29,467
Yeah, I'm building
a video game.

1083
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:30,717
Okay.

1084
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,133
You know you're gonna
need a shooter,

1085
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:33,758
- and I'm that dude, so...
- Wait a minute.

1086
00:46:33,842 --> 00:46:35,592
I'm next, because if Klay's
in it, then I'm in it.

1087
00:46:35,675 --> 00:46:36,925
Hey, if I'm gonna be
in this game,

1088
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:38,842
I need a superpower
or something.

1089
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:40,050
Between me and you,

1090
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:42,383
I need one of those
special modes.

1091
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,217
And we can call it
"Dame Time."

1092
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,300
- [all speaking at once]
- Nah, time's up. Time's up.

1093
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:48,342
You guys can be
whatever you want.

This phone?

[gasps softly]

1100
00:47:07,342 --> 00:47:09,883
So, theoretically,
this app of yours

1101
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,550
can scan people in
from anywhere in the world,

1102
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:14,633
using their own phones.

1103
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:15,842
Yeah, I guess.

1104
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,633
That is sick. [chuckles]

1105
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:18,592
Pete!

- Check this out.

1107
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:22,050
Make sure he gets it
back though, it's his.

1108
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:23,508
And respect his privacy.

[sighs]

1111
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:34,883
[in English]
Gotta say, though,

1112
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:37,967
it's really a shame that
your dad doesn't support you.

1113
00:47:40,175 --> 00:47:42,050
I mean, I get it.

1114
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:44,550
He's one of the greatest
of all time at what he does.

1115
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:46,008
Well, the jury's still out
on that, I think,

1116
00:47:46,092 --> 00:47:47,133
but go ahead.

1117
00:47:48,342 --> 00:47:51,925
And I... build video games.

1118
00:47:52,717 --> 00:47:53,717
Mmm.

1119
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,217
I think he doesn't...

1120
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,383
He won't let me do me.

1121
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:02,383
He won't let me be me.

1122
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:05,133
I'd let you be you.

1123
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:09,258
You know what?

1124
00:48:09,342 --> 00:48:12,175
I think I know a way
we can fix this.

make your dad stand up</i>

Ball.

1133
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:43,133
I need us to focus
so we can beat this Al G. guy,

1134
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:44,425
and I can get my son back.

Uh, look here, Cleveland.

1140

We got a certain way
of doing things around here.

[LeBron] Let's start
with the basics.

Simplest shot in the game.

- Sufferin' succotash!
- Oh, wow!

1146
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:06,633
[LeBron] Nice layup.

1147
00:49:06,717 --> 00:49:07,967
That's fundamental basketball.

1148
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,133
[in normal voice]
Fundamental basketball.

1149
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:10,717
That's what I've been saying.

1150

Sam, shoot the ball.

Where'd she get the ramp?

In your face!

1174
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:23,383
This isn't real basketball.

[Bugs Bunny]
You're right. But it's fun!

1176

You remember fun,
don't you, Doc?

1177
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:31,883
Game, Blouses! What?

1178
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:37,133
You lost LeBron James?

1179
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,717
And his son? For real?

1180
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,258
You better find that dude.
He on my fantasy team.

Listen, his wife keeps calling
me every ten minutes.

Now, I gotta get back
to her soon

or she gonna kill me, man.

1187
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,758
Look, does my name badge say,
"LeBron Finder"?

1188
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:58,342
"LeBron Locator"?
No, it doesn't.

1189
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:00,550
But isn't it your job
to secure something?

1190
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:01,675
With all due respect,

1191
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,133
I went to school
for six months

1192
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:05,508
to be accredited
as a security specialist,

1193
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:07,883
specializing
in the securial arts.

1194
00:51:07,967 --> 00:51:09,592
And the sooner
you come to terms

1195
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:12,258
with the fact that you lost
the world's greatest athlete,

1196
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:14,258
the sooner you'll be able
to move on with your life.

1197
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,050
I'm a professional!
An avid professional, man!

about your...

Hey, Kamiyah.

1201
00:51:20,092 --> 00:51:22,050
Yeah, I got the funniest story
to tell you.

1202
00:51:22,133 --> 00:51:24,133
Oh, snap!
I gotta call you back.

1203
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:25,467
I'm driving through a canyon
right now.

1204
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,800
He ain't in no canyon.

1205
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,300
He in my office,
violating my personal space!

I'm driving through a canyon
right here!

1207
00:51:30,008 --> 00:51:31,633
He need to get back on his
business and find LeBron.

- Code ten! Code ten!

00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,133
- You... I can't hear...
- Malik.

1210
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:37,883
You have zero seconds
to tell me

1211
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:39,758
where my husband
and my son are.

1212
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:41,133
[Al G.] Okay, young prince,

1213
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:43,342
time to rebuild
your character.

1214
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:45,800
[Dom] Al, have you
done this before?

1215
00:51:45,883 --> 00:51:47,383
[Al G.] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1216
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,883
I upgrade things all the time.

1217
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,342
I mean, look at Pete,
for instance.

1218
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:54,092
He was hideous, now he's
adorable. Right, Pete?

1219
00:51:54,175 --> 00:51:56,800
- [Pete cooing]
- Ugh. Don't...

1220
00:51:56,883 --> 00:51:59,550
Don't look at Pete, okay?
Just focus on yourself.

1221
00:52:05,633 --> 00:52:07,550
That's the character
customization menu

1222
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:08,633
from my game.

1223
00:52:08,717 --> 00:52:11,300
Yes, it is. Now, with this,

1224
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:12,550

You said we were rebuilding

They understand power.

You take the power.

1259
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:46,133
You gotta make him
respect you.

1260
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:49,050
You make him see
that you are special.

Now, if he's tweeting

- he's a bad dude.
- What?

1570
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:33,925
He's using your game
to trap everyone in here.

1571
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,925
He's not bad. He's just sad
because he works so hard

1572
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:39,592
and no one pays
attention to him.

1573
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:41,050
He's like me, Dad.

1574
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:43,133
No, he's nothing like you.
He's manipulating you.

1575
01:07:43,217 --> 01:07:44,425
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1576
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:45,967
Why you using
all these charged words...

1577
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:49,258
Deleted. Manipulate...
[whispers] Kidnapped.

1578
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:50,425
Come on, LeBron, chill out.

1579
01:07:50,508 --> 01:07:51,842
What'd you say, man?

1580
01:07:51,925 --> 01:07:53,592
I'm playing basketball.
I thought you'd be happy.

1581
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:55,175
Thought you'd be happy.

1582
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:56,592
Yeah, you keep it up,

1583
01:07:56,675 --> 01:07:57,925
you ain't gonna get
that Father's Day card.

1584
01:07:58,008 --> 01:07:59,258
Those things
are not guaranteed.

1585
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,092
- Dom.
- [Al G.] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1586
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:03,592
[The Brow] You going down,
King James.

1587
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:05,383
What's good, baby? [kisses]

1588
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:06,842
Hey, yo, Brow,

1589
01:08:06,925 --> 01:08:08,092
I think it's time
for your eyebrows

1590
01:08:08,175 --> 01:08:09,425
to break up with each other.

1591
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,508
Oh?

1592
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:14,342
They ugly. Let it go.

1593
01:08:14,425 --> 01:08:16,300
What he mean?
What's wrong with 'em?

1594
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:19,300
We'll show him who's boss.

1595
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:20,967
What did he say, Bron?

1596
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,800
He thinks Al G. is his friend.
I don't know what else to do.

1597
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,258
You gotta win this game...

1598
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:33,383
and get our son back.

1599
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:36,675
Okay.

1600
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,550

[Pete hums along to end note]

1604
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:04,675
Pete's the referee?

1605
01:09:04,758 --> 01:09:07,758
Oh, you mad, bro? [laughs]

1606
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:08,842

[crowd cheering]

1608
01:09:10,175 --> 01:09:11,550
[Ernie] Look,
I don't want to alarm you

1609
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:12,967
or any of our viewers,

1610
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,217
but apparently,

1611
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,675
if the Tune Squad
doesn't win this game,

1612
01:09:15,758 --> 01:09:18,133
we're all gonna be
trapped here forever.

1613
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:20,092
[chuckles] Luckily
the Tune Squad got

1614
01:09:20,175 --> 01:09:22,175
the four-time MVP LeBron James
on their team.

1615
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,383
I ain't sweating it.

1618
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:38,383
- [crowd exclaims]
- Oh, we doomed. We're doomed!

1619
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:41,133
You gotta be kidding me.

1620
01:09:41,217 --> 01:09:42,383
[Lil Rel] Did you see
that kid fly?

1621
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:43,800
[Ernie] Uh-huh.

1622
01:09:43,883 --> 01:09:45,925
He's like Superman,
but with a hi-top fade.

1623
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,050
[grunts]

1624
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:55,675
[Ernie] Rel, I gotta tell you,

1625
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:59,383
this Goon Squad is loaded,
top to bottom.

1626
01:09:59,467 --> 01:10:01,842
Bugs Bunny is gonna need
a rabbit's foot

1627
01:10:01,925 --> 01:10:03,967
against this guy, Wet Fire.

1628
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,675
Oh! Because he's wet,
and he's fire.

1629
01:10:06,758 --> 01:10:09,092
[chuckles]
That's kinda brilliant.

1630
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:11,383
- Whoop. Oh. Whoop. Ha-ha.
- [Lola] What?

1631
01:10:12,717 --> 01:10:15,342
- Gimme that ball!
- Back off, rabbit.

[Wet Fire] Entering
the Splash Zone! Ha-ha!

1633
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,842
[Ernie] And you know
what else is brilliant?

1634
01:10:22,925 --> 01:10:24,967
This ball movement, man.
Check it out.

1635
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,508

Sixteen? What's up
with the score?

1640
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:36,258
Style points, Dad.

1641
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:37,383
Style points?

1642
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,050
Style points?

1643

Style points, power-ups.

See, kids, playing video games
do pay off!

1646
01:10:47,342 --> 01:10:49,133
Come on, baby bunny.

1647
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,592
Out of my way, you big worm.

1648
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:54,967
Thank you.

1649
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:58,092
Help me. Please.

1650
01:10:58,175 --> 01:10:59,258
What?

1651
01:11:00,258 --> 01:11:01,550
Come chase this down.

[dramatic music plays]

[Lola] Hey! [groans]

1654
01:11:05,425 --> 01:11:07,467
[Ernie] Arachnneka
throws down a monster dunk.

1655
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,467
And she dunks again.
And again and again.

1656
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,967
Eat that, eat that,
eat that, eat that.

1657
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,842
And again and again and again!
And again!

1658
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:15,008
- And again!
- [beeping]

1659
01:11:16,592 --> 01:11:17,883
Ow.

[crowd exclaims, cheers]

1661
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:21,217
Down goes the king!

1662
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,800
Is... Is this legal?

1663
01:11:22,883 --> 01:11:24,967
Man, she got six arms.
What else she supposed to do?

1664
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:25,967
Oh, boy.

1665

[Tweety twittering]

1666
01:11:27,258 --> 01:11:29,675
[Tweety] Get up, LeBron.
We need you.

1667
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:31,383
How'd that taste, King?

1668
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:34,883
Yeah! Can't touch us.

1669
01:11:34,967 --> 01:11:36,675
[Bugs Bunny] Listen, Bron-Bron.

1670
01:11:36,758 --> 01:11:39,258
This is basketball,
but with a spin to it.

1671
01:11:39,342 --> 01:11:41,217
We gotta think outta the box.

1672
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,508
There's only one basketball.

1673
01:11:42,592 --> 01:11:44,675
And, Bugs,
don't do nothing looney.

1674
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:46,008
Nothing looney?

1675
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:47,175
Let's go!

1676
01:11:47,258 --> 01:11:49,717
We're not called
the "Fundamental Tunes."

1677
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,300
Don't just stand there,
rabbit!

1678
01:11:51,383 --> 01:11:53,217
Get the ball to LeBron!

1679
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,175
[Ernie] LeBron's so hard
to guard down low

1680
01:11:56,258 --> 01:11:58,425
using that huge size
advantage.

1681
01:11:58,508 --> 01:12:00,633
Sorry, son. You know
I gotta go win this game.

1682
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:01,758
If you say so.

1683
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:06,342
[Ernie] Ooh,
he just got blocked by Dom.

1684
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:08,383
The King has been dethroned.

1685
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:09,717
[Lil Rel] His own son.

1686
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,175
That is cold-blooded, Ernie.

1687
01:12:11,258 --> 01:12:12,675
Look, this is not like
any kind of basketball

1688
01:12:12,758 --> 01:12:13,758
LeBron has ever seen.

1689
01:12:13,842 --> 01:12:15,592
- [grunts]
- [Dom] Whoo!

1690
01:12:15,675 --> 01:12:18,008
[Ernie] I've never seen
anything like this.

1691
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:19,258
Where's that pass going?

1692
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:20,758
- Hey, what up, Bugs?
- Watch the hair.

1693
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:24,758
[Dom] Thank you. Assist.

1694

- [Ernie] 33-pointer?

1697
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:36,925
- Oh, yes!
- Huh?

1698
01:12:37,008 --> 01:12:39,217
Well played.
See, this is why we practice.

1699
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,217
- [crowd cheering]
- We didn't. We don't practice.

1700
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,425
[LeBron]
What's up with that, Pete?

1701
01:12:42,508 --> 01:12:44,050
[chuckles]

1702
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:45,883
You can't move the basket like
that, man, that's cheating.

1703
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:47,550
No, you can.
You can move the basket.

1704
01:12:47,633 --> 01:12:48,883
[LeBron] Man, you don't
even know what you're talk...

1705
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:50,133
- [Pete grunts]
- A technical?

1706
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:51,633
Oh, you're gonna give me
a technical?

1707
01:12:51,717 --> 01:12:53,133
- Man, I wish you would. Tsk!
- [Pete babbles]

1708
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:55,717
I say, what kind of ship
are you running here?

1709
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,258
You gotta call the game fair.

1710
01:12:57,342 --> 01:12:59,425
I say, fair! [yells]

1711
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:03,300
- Well, that happened.
- [gibbers]

1712
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:04,592
Never in my career

1713
01:13:04,675 --> 01:13:06,592
did I think
I'd say these five words,

1714
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:09,175
"Foghorn Leghorn
just got ejected."

1715
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:11,717
This is not going well.

1716
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,092
Your dad's got this. I hope.

1718
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,383
Let's go. Stand her up.
D up! Right there.

1719
01:13:21,467 --> 01:13:23,258
Come here, bunny.

1720

1722

[Daffy] Way to go!
[Elmer] We love LeBron!

1723
01:13:32,258 --> 01:13:34,092
- [grunts]
- Let's go!

1724
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:35,258
You act like
it's the first time

1725

[rattles]

01:13:59,883 --> 01:14:02,050
Not you, girl.
[chuckles nervously]

1734

Oh, she got me.

We're gettin' murderized!

1738
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:15,300
Try a power-up, Dad!

1739

01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:29,008
I'm going old-school
on his butt.

2079
01:28:34,925 --> 01:28:36,175
- Whoa.
- [crowd cheering]

2080
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:45,300
Come on.

2081
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,300
- [crowd gasps]
- Stop!

2082
01:28:54,842 --> 01:28:56,842
- [beeping]
- Tick-tock.

2083
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,925
- [grunts weakly]
- Hyah!

2084
01:29:03,925 --> 01:29:07,175
- [crowd cheering]
- She is The One.

2085
01:29:09,717 --> 01:29:12,633
What in the AARP
is going on out here?

2086
01:29:15,175 --> 01:29:16,925
I got hops! Whoo!

2087
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:18,342
[digital trilling]

2088
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:19,883
Lola!

2089
01:29:19,967 --> 01:29:21,092
Got you, Bron!

2090
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,300
[yelling]

2091
01:29:40,342 --> 01:29:42,217
[screaming]

2092
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:44,842
[all groan]

2093
01:29:44,925 --> 01:29:46,800
- [crowd cheering]
- There we go! Let's go!

2094
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:49,050
[Ernie] And the Tunes
take the lead!

2095
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:52,175
What a play from Lola
and LeBron James!

2096
01:29:52,258 --> 01:29:53,967
- A monster jam!
- [chuckling]

2097
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:56,300
LeBron came back
from three-one down.

2098
01:29:56,383 --> 01:29:58,883
Can he come back
from this far back?

2099
01:29:58,967 --> 01:30:00,300
Let me tell you this,
I woke up today

2100
01:30:00,383 --> 01:30:01,800
and only knew one world.

2101
01:30:01,883 --> 01:30:04,425
Then I got sucked into
my phone, and at this point,

2102
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:06,758
anything's possible!

2103
01:30:06,842 --> 01:30:08,758
- [laughs]
- [LeBron shouts]

2104
01:30:08,842 --> 01:30:10,092
- Way to go, Tunes!
- Let's go!

2105
01:30:10,175 --> 01:30:11,092
Foghorn, right here.

2106
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:12,425
- Yeah!
- [LeBron] Yeah!

2107
01:30:12,508 --> 01:30:13,633
- I say, that's all right!
- [LeBron] Lola!

2108
01:30:13,717 --> 01:30:14,800
Yes! My dude!

2109
01:30:14,883 --> 01:30:15,842
Taz!

2110
01:30:15,925 --> 01:30:17,675
[LeBron cheering]

2111
01:30:17,758 --> 01:30:20,092
- Go, baby! Yeah!
- Oh, yeah! Here we go!

2112
01:30:20,175 --> 01:30:21,592
[Foghorn] Way to go,
Tune Squad!

2113
01:30:21,675 --> 01:30:22,758
[LeBron] Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

2114
01:30:22,842 --> 01:30:25,800
Now we having some fun! Yeah!

2115
01:30:25,883 --> 01:30:28,258
Whoo-hoo! This is
fun basketball right here!

2116
01:30:28,342 --> 01:30:30,883
- Be yourselves! Be yourselves!
- [Elmer] All right!

2117
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:33,425
Hey, Dom, are you a Tune
or are you a Goon?

2118
01:30:33,508 --> 01:30:34,717
Tune or Goon? Tune or Goon?

2119
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,467
Make up your mind.
Make up your mind.

2120
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:38,383
Let's go. Sit down.

2121
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:40,467
Yeah. Way to get looney
out there.

2122
01:30:40,550 --> 01:30:42,467
- [Granny cheers, laughs]
- Ooh-whee!

2123
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,342
[Tweety] We did it!

2124
01:30:47,467 --> 01:30:48,967
Everybody happy, huh?

2125
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,758
Everybody having
a good time? Yeah?

2126
01:30:50,842 --> 01:30:52,133
You having a lot of fun
out there?

2127
01:30:52,217 --> 01:30:53,467
'Cause that's all
that matters, right?

2128
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:54,717
Is that you're having fun.

2129
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,133
[yelling]
That doesn't matter at all!

2130
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:59,008
What matters is that
I win this [bleep] game!

2131
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:01,217
Oh, and you, Dom.

2132
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,633
How are you losing
at your own game?

2133
01:31:03,717 --> 01:31:05,092
[in distorted voice]
For server's sake,

2134
01:31:05,175 --> 01:31:06,592
I didn't even think
that was possible!

2135
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:08,675
I expected a lot more
out of you, son.

2136
01:31:08,758 --> 01:31:11,717
Get your head in the game.
I need to win!

2137
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:12,925
[Foghorn] All right!

2138
01:31:13,008 --> 01:31:14,675
[Yosemite Sam]
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!

2139
01:31:14,758 --> 01:31:15,925
[Granny] Drinks on me!

2140
01:31:16,008 --> 01:31:17,633
[Sylvester]
Boy, that was awesome!

2141
01:31:17,717 --> 01:31:18,717
[Porky] Go team!

2142
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,342
[Al G. sighs]

2143
01:31:20,425 --> 01:31:23,592
[in normal voice] Yeah, maybe
your dad was right about you.

2144
01:31:23,675 --> 01:31:26,508
Letting you be you
was a mistake.

2145
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,675
[sad music playing]

2146
01:31:30,758 --> 01:31:32,175
- [thud]
- Okay.

2147
01:31:32,258 --> 01:31:33,883
If everybody would move down,

2148
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:35,633
then we could all sit
on the bench.

2149
01:31:35,717 --> 01:31:38,175
Let's all sit on the bench!

2150
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:40,217
[Foghorn] Now that's what
I call momentum, son.

2151
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,633
- [Lola] LeBron?
- [Tweety] Way to go!

2152
01:31:41,717 --> 01:31:42,925
Hey, you with us?

2153
01:31:43,008 --> 01:31:44,550
[Porky] I'm so tickled.

2154
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:48,758
Let's end this.

2155
01:31:48,842 --> 01:31:50,675
I'm getting my son back.

2156
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:59,967
[buzzer sounds]

2157
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,008
[inspirational music playing]

2158
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:04,758
[Elmer pants, grunts]

2159
01:32:05,342 --> 01:32:06,133
[grunts]

2160
01:32:06,217 --> 01:32:08,050
Iso. Clear out.

2161
01:32:08,133 --> 01:32:09,508
[Elmer panting]

2162
01:32:10,467 --> 01:32:12,550
[suspenseful music playing]

2163
01:32:16,383 --> 01:32:17,967
I wonder what move
he's gonna do.

2164
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:19,050
The post-up?

2165
01:32:19,133 --> 01:32:20,050
Maybe the fadeaway.

2166
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:22,425
He's gonna dunk all over him.

2167
01:32:22,508 --> 01:32:24,800
Look at that kid!
Kid's too small.

2168
01:32:27,758 --> 01:32:28,842
[music stops]

2169
01:32:31,842 --> 01:32:33,258
Dad, what are you doing?

2170
01:32:33,342 --> 01:32:34,592
We're in the middle of a game.

2171
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:37,342
Hey, what's goin' on?

2172
01:32:37,425 --> 01:32:38,717
I don't know.

2173
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,800
[Dom] Dad...

2174
01:32:44,467 --> 01:32:49,133
Dom, your game
is amazing, son.

2175
01:32:49,217 --> 01:32:50,300
But I guess
I would've known that

2176
01:32:50,383 --> 01:32:51,842
if I would've listened more.

2177
01:32:51,925 --> 01:32:53,925
Sorry I didn't.

2178
01:32:54,008 --> 01:32:56,008
For me, when I was a kid,

2179
01:32:56,092 --> 01:32:58,758
the things that I went through
to get where I am now,

2180
01:32:58,842 --> 01:33:01,342
I had to be a certain way.
[sighs]

2181
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:04,050
Yeah, it helped me win games,

2182
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,425
but not so much being a dad.

2183
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:13,550
I'm still learning how.
You're teaching me.

2184
01:33:14,842 --> 01:33:16,467
I want you to be yourself.

2185
01:33:19,258 --> 01:33:21,342
Do you understand
how much I love you?

2186
01:33:22,883 --> 01:33:25,717
Do you understand
how important you are to me?

2187
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:29,425
How very special you are?

2188
01:33:30,925 --> 01:33:34,425
I mean, I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

2189
01:33:34,508 --> 01:33:36,217
[ball bounces off]

2190
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:43,800
Sounds right to me.

2191
01:33:43,883 --> 01:33:45,592
[tender music playing]

2192
01:33:50,967 --> 01:33:52,425
I love you, Dad.

2193
01:33:53,592 --> 01:33:55,175
I love you too, son.

2194
01:33:57,092 --> 01:33:59,258
[crowd applauding]

2195
01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:06,175
- Oh, now, that's beautiful.
- [Granny] Let's go!

2196
01:34:06,258 --> 01:34:07,300
[Yosemite Sam] Whoo!

2197
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:09,300
I think I'm gonna cry.

2198
01:34:09,383 --> 01:34:10,800
Not me.

2199
01:34:11,425 --> 01:34:12,967
[wailing]

2200
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:15,258
Bugs, pull it together.

2201
01:34:15,342 --> 01:34:16,383
[Kamiyah] Dom!

2202
01:34:17,967 --> 01:34:18,967
Dom!

2203
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,717
[Dom] Mom!

2204
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,592
Hey, Xosha!

2205
01:34:25,675 --> 01:34:27,050
[Al G.] Are you serious?

2206
01:34:29,592 --> 01:34:30,800
[in distorted voice] Zip it!

2207
01:34:30,883 --> 01:34:32,592
[crowd quiets]

2208
01:34:32,675 --> 01:34:34,425
You two are a joke,
you know that?

2209
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,175
I got this, Dad.

2210
01:34:37,258 --> 01:34:38,800
[in normal voice] Oh, what?
You got something to say?

2211
01:34:38,883 --> 01:34:40,300
Yeah.

2212
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:42,425
I think you want people to
fear you more than anything.

2213
01:34:42,508 --> 01:34:44,717
And I'm not about that, Al G.

2214
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,383
I'm playing with my dad.

2215
01:34:46,467 --> 01:34:49,133
First of all, it's Mr. Rhythm
to you, you little traitor.

2216
01:34:49,217 --> 01:34:50,675
Second of all, you're not.

2217
01:34:50,758 --> 01:34:51,967
You're playing
against your dad.

2218
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,800
See what this says?
"Goon Squad."

2219
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:55,633
You already
made your choice, Dom.

2220
01:34:55,717 --> 01:34:56,925
Right, Pete? He can't...

2221
01:34:57,008 --> 01:34:59,508
- [whimpering]
- Pete, are you crying?

2222
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:01,800
There's no crying
in the Serververse, Pete!

2223
01:35:01,883 --> 01:35:03,758
[Al G. scoffs]

2224
01:35:03,842 --> 01:35:05,800
All right. Yeah, all right.

2225
01:35:05,883 --> 01:35:07,300
I see how it is, Dom.

2226
01:35:07,383 --> 01:35:09,008
[in distorted voice]
I see how it is.

2227
01:35:09,092 --> 01:35:10,925
I gave you everything!

2228
01:35:11,008 --> 01:35:12,883
I say, I say,
good to have you, son.

2229
01:35:12,967 --> 01:35:13,967
Great spot for you
right here, kid.

2230
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,133
[Yosemite Sam] We got 'em now!

2231
01:35:15,217 --> 01:35:16,258
[Speedy] <i>Bienvenido, senorito!</i>

2232
01:35:16,342 --> 01:35:17,300
Somebody get him a new jersey.

2233
01:35:17,383 --> 01:35:18,342
[Elmer] Welcome to the hunt.

2234
01:35:18,425 --> 01:35:19,758
Sufferin' succotash!

2235
01:35:19,842 --> 01:35:21,758
I made this, just in case.

2236
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:22,800
Thanks, Granny.

2237
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:24,300
Eh. What's up, Dom?

2238
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:25,592
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

2239
01:35:25,675 --> 01:35:26,925
Here you go, Dom.

2240
01:35:27,008 --> 01:35:28,592
[Tweety] Really glad
to have you on the team!

2241
01:35:28,675 --> 01:35:29,675
[Dom] Thanks, Dad.

2242
01:35:29,758 --> 01:35:30,800
[Al G.] Fine.

2243
01:35:32,633 --> 01:35:35,175
You wanna join these losers?

2244
01:35:35,258 --> 01:35:37,050
You go ahead, Dom.

2245
01:35:37,133 --> 01:35:39,800
'Cause it's not your game
anymore.

2246
01:35:39,883 --> 01:35:41,592
[in distorted voice]
I am the game.

2247
01:35:41,675 --> 01:35:45,425
King Kong
ain't got nothin' on me!

2248
01:35:45,508 --> 01:35:47,133
[King Kong gasps, grunts]

He's cheating!

Well, I say, I say,
that plain ol' sucks.

Listen, it's all right.

2300

All we gotta do
is get one bucket.

2301
01:38:02,217 --> 01:38:04,758
How can we score
if he controls the game, Doc?

2302
01:38:04,842 --> 01:38:06,425
[Al G.] Whoa!
Where my Goons at?

2303
01:38:06,508 --> 01:38:07,758

Right here, Coach!

[Al G. chuckles,

[Al G.] No mercy!

2306
01:38:12,258 --> 01:38:16,092
That no-good,
despicable son of a glitch!

2307
01:38:19,342 --> 01:38:20,675
Yo! That's it!

2308
01:38:20,758 --> 01:38:22,800
Your move, Dad. Remember?

2309
01:38:22,883 --> 01:38:24,092
The step-back glitch.

2310
01:38:24,175 --> 01:38:26,258
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.

2311
01:38:26,342 --> 01:38:27,800
That move froze my whole game.

2312
01:38:27,883 --> 01:38:29,008
[LeBron]
And that's good because...

2313
01:38:29,092 --> 01:38:30,425
[Dom] If the game crashes,

2314
01:38:30,508 --> 01:38:32,092
Al G. won't be able
to control it anymore.

2315
01:38:32,175 --> 01:38:33,550
And if he can't control it,

2316
01:38:33,633 --> 01:38:34,967
he can't stop us
from scoring.

2317
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,300
[Dom] Right!

2318
01:38:36,383 --> 01:38:38,467
- [Sylvester] Oh, boy!
- [Porky] Yeah! Yay!

2319
01:38:39,092 --> 01:38:40,592
Wait.

2320
01:38:40,675 --> 01:38:42,675
- That's not gonna work.
- [LeBron] Why not?

2321
01:38:42,758 --> 01:38:46,467
When my character did
the step-back, it got deleted.

2322
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:49,633
So, whoever does
the glitch move...

2323
01:38:49,717 --> 01:38:51,592
- Will get deleted.
- [all gasp]

2324
01:38:53,883 --> 01:38:56,883
So, I say, so I guess
we're drawing straws.

2325
01:38:56,967 --> 01:38:59,467
We are not doing that.

2326
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:00,842
We'll think of something else.

2327
01:39:00,925 --> 01:39:03,175
What about the old alley-oop?

2328
01:39:03,258 --> 01:39:04,550
I'm gonna do the step-back.

2329
01:39:04,633 --> 01:39:05,800
[all gasp]

2330
01:39:05,883 --> 01:39:08,300
What? No.
Dad, you'll be deleted.

I'm not
a video game character.

2332
01:39:10,008 --> 01:39:11,467
I think I'll be okay.

2333
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,592
Dad, you don't know that.
I've done the calculations.

[LeBron] Dom.

2335
01:39:13,883 --> 01:39:15,800
Somebody's gotta do something.

2336
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,550
LeBron,
you don't have to do this.

2337
01:39:17,633 --> 01:39:18,633
[all] No!

2338
01:39:18,717 --> 01:39:20,133

Yeah, this is fun, huh?

2346

We should just do it again,
and again, and again.

Just over, and over, and over
for all eternity.

a broken play!
