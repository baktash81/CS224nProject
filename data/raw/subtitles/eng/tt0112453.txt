1
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:15,997
Well, it was here... someplace.

2
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:19,005
But we've already been past here.

3
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,805
The trees have grown so big.

4
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:28,565
It's been so long
since my last visit.

5
00:01:35,407 --> 00:01:37,682
(Girl) Come on, Blaze.

6
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:41,197
Grandma, when was
the last time you were here?

7
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:43,636
(Chuckles) Years and years ago.

8
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,282
Way before you were born, sweetheart.

9
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:50,842
- (Blaze barking)
- Oh, look! Blaze found a squirrel.

10
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:55,005
Now, just a minute.
I'm trying to get my bearings.

11
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:57,766
Oh, there are so many paths here.

12
00:01:57,807 --> 00:02:01,197
So easy to get turned around.
Come on, darling.

13
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:04,557
Grandma,
we're in the middle of nowhere!

14
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,440
We're right in the middle
of New York City!

15
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:10,320
You'll make yourself tired
walking so long.

16
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:14,121
Nonsense. It hasn't been
more than a quarter of an hour.

17
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:16,606
Not much further.

18
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:18,524
Blaze is getting tired.

19
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,364
Oh, I see!

20
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:26,085
Grandma,
what are we looking for anyway?

21
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,083
Uh, a memorial.

22
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,482
- A me...- what?
- (Chuckles)

23
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:34,281
A reminder of a wonderful story...

24
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:37,399
and a place very far away from here.

25
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,403
What place is that, Grandma?

26
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,481
Nome, Alaska.

27
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:47,042
It's a small town
almost on top of the world.

28
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:48,566
Hmm.

29
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:52,043
Now, that really was
in the middle of nowhere, sweetheart.

30
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:58,162
In the cold winter of 1925,

31
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,596
it was snowing hard.

32
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:06,680
<i>Back then, the fastest and most
reliable way of getting around</i>

33
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:10,515
<i>was with teams of dogs
pulling along sleds.</i>

34
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:15,436
<i>Races were held every year
to find out the best team.</i>

35
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:20,483
<i>And the competition
was very fierce.</i>

36
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,042
(Barking)

37
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,078
(Man) Mush!

38
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,763
(Man) Gee up, boy.

39
00:03:34,807 --> 00:03:36,923
Hup! Hup! Hyah!

40
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:41,806
Giddap, Steele! Giddap, giddap!

41
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,281
Steele! Whoa! Whoa!

42
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:03,315
Steele, we're not gonna make it!

43
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,801
Hyah!

44
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:10,318
- (1st man) Easy, now! Easy!
- (2nd man) Steele, hold back!

45
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:20,047
(Dogs yelping)

46
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:22,282
(Steele panting, dogs barking)

47
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:26,643
Ohh! Steele!

48
00:04:26,687 --> 00:04:29,121
(1st man) Get in line, Steele!

49
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,885
Get in line!

50
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,759
Mush! Mush!

51
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,438
It's the three-mile marker.

52
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:44,241
(Russian accent) Balto,
get your slobbering mouth off me!

53
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:47,324
Let's go, Boris.
We'll go catch the end of the race.

54
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:51,076
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm a delicate country bird.

55
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,238
I hate going into town.

56
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:57,677
Ah, come on.
What's the worst that can happen?

57
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,797
(Boris yelling)

58
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,121
Whoa!

59
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,486
(Spluttering)

60
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,961
Please! Aah!

61
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,801
Why do I let you talk me
into these things?

62
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:15,084
Uh? Arggghhh!

63
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,245
- Gurr!
- (Man) Huh?

64
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:22,199
What the...?! Eeeh!

65
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,358
Arrrgggghhh!

66
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,157
(Boris) Whoa-ho!

67
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,119
Bring that back, you thief!

68
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:42,325
You are putting me down now?

69
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,643
- Mr Golden Retriever?
- Whatever you say, Boris.

70
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:49,157
Every time there's a race,
you run around like you're in it.

71
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,596
- Maybe one day I will be.
- Heel, boy!

72
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:54,320
Boris Goosinoff is no spring chicken.

73
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:56,358
- Hey!
- (Crashing Sounds)

74
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,715
I'm no spring penguin, either!

75
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,759
Oy, it's cold! (Teeth chattering)

76
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,563
(Man) Look! The two-mile mark.

77
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,723
Come on! Don't wanna miss the finish.

78
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,678
Oh, that would be a tragedy(!)

79
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,479
Aaah!

80
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,722
(Boris) I was being sarcastic.

81
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,926
OK, you can open your eyes now.

82
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,038
Ohh!

83
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:30,996
I love these runners!
I love this brush bow!

84
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,925
I love this sled!
Jenna, you're lead dog!

85
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,925
OK, just a minute. Come on. Mush!

86
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,958
Then you'll need... this.

87
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:42,966
A real musher's hat!
We're a real sled team now!

88
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,201
Mush!

89
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,045
Mister Johanssen,
the sled is beautiful.

90
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:49,726
- We're very grateful.
- Oh, thank you!

91
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,565
- Rosy's grateful too, huh?
- So I gather!

92
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,167
- Watch this!
- Coming, sweetheart.

93
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,119
Maybe we should've gotten her
the doll house!

94
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:00,723
It's the one-mile marker.

95
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,725
Mush, Jenna, mush!
Let's win this race!

96
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:07,043
- Whoo!
- I think she'll learn to like it!

97
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,717
Jenna. Easy, girl.

98
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,519
Whoa!

99
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:17,322
Good morning, Jenna. Oughta be
a close race, don't you think?

100
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,120
Maybe even neck and... neck.

101
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:24,763
Say something about her new collar
before she gets whiplash.

102
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:27,446
Um, Dixie, what a pretty collar.
Is it new?

103
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,239
What? This old thing?

104
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah. Do you think,
um, Steele will notice?

105
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,366
The only way Steele notices anyone
is if they're wearing a mirror.

106
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:39,477
(Man) They're comin'!

107
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,439
(Cheering, dogs barking)

108
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:49,679
- (Man) Steele!
- (Woman) You can do it!

109
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,763
(Rosy) Jenna! Stay, girl!

110
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,763
(Woman) That's some dog!

111
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,719
(Rosy) Jenna!

112
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:09,958
Hold on. Come on, Steele!

113
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,884
Oh, no!

114
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,365
(Gasps)

115
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,926
My hat!

116
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,523
- It's that stray dog!
- He's gonna ruin the race!

117
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,285
Oww!

118
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:38,442
Arrgghhh!

119
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:42,640
Hey! Outta my way, lobo.

120
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,366
Yii!

121
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,557
(Panting and snarling)

122
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:02,763
When will you learn
to stay on the sidelines?

123
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,838
(Beeping)

124
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,242
To Juneau Daily Chronicle. Stop.

125
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,120
Steele wins first race
of season. Stop.

126
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:20,240
Three-time winner keeps
Golden Collar. Stop. Nome. Stop.

127
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:23,324
That Steele is some dog, huh, Morris?

128
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,200
(Telegraph wire beeping rhythmically)

129
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,807
Congratulations there, boss, there.

130
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,361
It was a pleasure
runnin' behind youse.

131
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,318
But the view got monotonous.

132
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:36,723
You are the most amazing,
exalted, pre-eminent...

133
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,359
You won!

134
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:41,925
Hmm...

135
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:45,317
I don't know.
You think Steele's losing his edge?

136
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah, looks like just about any dog
could outrun him.

137
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:51,316
- (Growling)
- Balto!

138
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:55,883
What a crazy thing to do
just to show off to a pretty girl!

139
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:00,245
I'm sure Jenna would love
to have you on her team.

140
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,847
- Hey! Rosy! Stay away from him!
- Dad!

141
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:06,084
He might bite you, honey.
He's part wolf.

142
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,766
Now you've hurt his feelings.

143
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,480
- (Steele chuckling)
- (Dad) Come on now.

144
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,041
Congratulations, Steele.

145
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,317
- Oooh!
- (Steele) Ladies.

146
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,800
- Hi, there, Jenna. Enjoy the race?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,680
- Almost as much as you did.
- Thanks.

148
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:28,356
Jenna, let's go celebrate. I know
where all the bones are buried.

149
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:31,797
I don't know.
Suddenly, I've lost my appetite.

150
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,803
Oh!

151
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:38,682
Well, maybe your taste
runs more toward... wolf.

152
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:41,719
Jenna! Come on, girl.
We're going back home.

153
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,486
Sorry, Steele.
My girl is calling me.

154
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:46,882
On the other hand,

155
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:50,283
my girl is away
at boarding school.

156
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,363
(Steele yawns and burps)

157
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:54,841
Whoo... ohh! Oh.

158
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,079
Er... Uh... Mmm.

159
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:06,924
(Rosy) Jenna!

160
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,959
- Huh?
- Jenna!

161
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,924
Ooh!

162
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,003
(Nervous laugh)

163
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:19,198
Jenna, I, uh...

164
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:21,841
- Jenna.
- Jen! Come on!

165
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:33,401
(Dad) Jenna! Come here, girl.

166
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,199
(Sighs)

167
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:40,036
Balto, there's some things
I can't do for you.

168
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,440
Yeah.

169
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,318
I'm goose, not Cupid.

170
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:45,722
Didn't make the team... Bingo?

171
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,520
Don't listen to him or look at him.
Live a long life.

172
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,398
My name's Balto.

173
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:52,517
But you can call him "idiot"!

174
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,956
I'm sorry. Balto.
Balto the half-breed.

175
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,486
(Other dogs mocking)

176
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,802
Hey, goose,
you a half-breed too, huh?

177
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,759
- Part turkey?
- Waa-hah-hah!

178
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,525
Good wordplay there, boss.

179
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,598
You are the wittiest, the quickest.

180
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:09,401
You are the drollest,
the cleverest, the most hilarious...

181
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,199
You crack me up!

182
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:15,963
Ah-ha-ha-haaa! Whoo!

183
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,760
Steele. Just leave him out of this.

184
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:22,925
Oh, Balto, I've got a message
for your mother.

185
00:12:22,967 --> 00:12:25,401
- (Steele howls)
- (Dogs laughing)

186
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,038
- (All laughing)
- Hi, Mom!

187
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:34,602
Balto, translate this for me...
(Howls)

188
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,002
What's wolf for "Go chase your tail"?

189
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,446
Balto, stop! Whoa!

190
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:41,240
- (Growling)
- (Howling continues)

191
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,084
- Uh-oh.
- (Growling)

192
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,083
Get him.

193
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:50,003
Get out of here, wolf-dog.
Get back to your pack!

194
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,837
Maybe it's the unrelenting fear,
but I'm seeing wisdom in this advice.

195
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,718
Maybe we go now, huh? Now!

196
00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:01,602
I'm thinking Balto's friend
got his feathers ruffled!

197
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,478
Goose! Ha! I get it!

198
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,446
Half-wolf in the side pocket there.

199
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:13,321
That was the most dead centre,
on-target, down-the-middle...

200
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:15,198
Ya hit him!

201
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:19,359
(Sighs, gulps)

202
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:21,477
(Evil chuckling)

203
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:23,245
That son-of-a...

204
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:27,917
He is the most malicious, disgusting,
obnoxious, revolting, repulsive...

205
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,605
He's no lap dog.

206
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,838
(Giggles)

207
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,803
Aah! Ooh.

208
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:52,160
(Howling)

209
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,767
Hmm.

210
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:09,079
(Boris) Not a dog, not a wolf.

211
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,597
All he knows is what he is not.

212
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:15,844
If only he could see what he is.

213
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:18,355
Oy, oy.

214
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,124
(Squeaking)

215
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,998
Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!

216
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,398
(Thud, squeaking stops)

217
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,323
( Russian dance)
Hey!

218
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,766
Hey!

219
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:05,918
Hey! (Music stops)

220
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,438
(Honking)

221
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,876
Homesick, Boris?

222
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,840
- You ever think about going back?
- Don't fret, Fido.

223
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,482
I'm sticking here until I'm sure
you can stand on own four feet.

224
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:35,803
- YOU'RE taking care of ME?!
- Don't thank me.

225
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,522
I smell... herring.

226
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,764
- The herring are flying south too?
- Say!

227
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:45,526
- Must be Muk and Luk.
- Oh. Good news(!)

228
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:48,684
- Uncle Boris!
- Oh, no!

229
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:51,605
How sweet. "Uncle Boris."

230
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:53,444
No hugging, no licking!

231
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,447
- Uncle Boris!
- Aaaah!

232
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:00,001
Aaah. Ooh!

233
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,279
Whew.

234
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,601
Oh, no.

235
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:08,276
(Muk) He says he's glad to see you.

236
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:10,045
We love you, Uncle Boris.

237
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,005
Aaah! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

238
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,845
(Whimpering)

239
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,286
(Mutters)

240
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,524
(Humming)

241
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,444
Hmm?

242
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:28,160
(Continues whimpering)

243
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,360
What?! Of course he's glad to see us.

244
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:36,036
He loves us... don't you?

245
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:38,237
Oy. OK, OK.

246
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:41,802
Hey, boychicks, uh, let's play a game.

247
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,565
Yes, please, Uncle Boris.

248
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:45,802
Race you to the shore.
One, two, three, go!

249
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:47,678
(Laughing) Yeah!

250
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:49,638
- They win.
- (Splashing)

251
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,724
(Muk) Help! Help! We can't swim!

252
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:57,437
Help! Help! We're drowning!
Save us, please!

253
00:16:57,487 --> 00:16:58,806
Bears!

254
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:03,363
- Fellas! Idiot balls of fluff!
- Easy, Boris. You know how they are.

255
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:04,965
Muk! Luk!

256
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:08,238
Relax! Come on, you're OK.
You're not drowning.

257
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,925
Huh?

258
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:13,243
He has point, bears.
You are not drowning.

259
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,597
If you will pause one moment
you will observe...

260
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,524
tide is out!

261
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,523
(Whimpers)

262
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,523
He said what?

263
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,355
Oh, the shame of the polar bear
who fears the water.

264
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:32,480
No wonder we are shunned
by our fellow bear. Woe is us!

265
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:35,519
It's what he said.
Kind of pathetic, really.

266
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,923
- (Luk whimpers)
- What, more whimpering?

267
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:43,404
Between you and Balto, it's like
Dostoevsky novel here. Lighten up.

268
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:51,038
And what is so interesting?

269
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:55,080
- Jenna.
- Is love.

270
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:57,561
So go make move.

271
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:03,045
When the angels' balalaikas
strum the sweet song of love, mambo!

272
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,476
Nah. She's not my type.

273
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:08,121
And why not?
This wolf business again?

274
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,477
What's wrong with being half
and half, I'd like to know?

275
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:13,802
Sometimes I wish I was half eagle.

276
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:14,996
Why?

277
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,322
Better profile, for one thing. Hmm.

278
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,517
And no one eats you, for another.

279
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:25,802
(Coughs)

280
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:28,315
- (Jenna barking)
- Jenna?

281
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,723
- (Barking continues)
- Jenna!

282
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:34,520
Jenna! Hi, girl!

283
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:48,000
Rosy! Rosy, come on. You're gonna
catch your death out here.

284
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:51,119
- OK, Dad.
- Come on, the doctor's waiting.

285
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,836
(Rosy coughing)

286
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:33,836
Jenna?

287
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:36,447
(Clears throat, lowers voice) Jenna.

288
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,557
Balto. Hi.

289
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,598
Hi.

290
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,559
Look, uh...

291
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,644
Just a shot in the dark,
but I was wondering if...

292
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:51,761
I don't know, maybe you'd like to
go chase a few sticks by moonlight.

293
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:54,480
(Chuckles, sighs)

294
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,440
Jenna?

295
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:04,036
- Rosy's in there.
- In a hospital? Why?

296
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,925
She feels warm
and she has a terrible cough.

297
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,163
Balto, what's wrong with her?

298
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:18,281
Uh, I'm not sure,
but I know how to find out. Come on.

299
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:22,763
I have the keys to the city.

300
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:30,565
After you.

301
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:34,562
- Balto!
- (Laughs)

302
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,599
Big paws kinda run in my family.

303
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:40,320
At least, uh, one side of my family.

304
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:47,399
- Stay close.
- (Nervous laugh) No problem there.

305
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:54,320
It's so gloomy down here.

306
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,323
Not that I'm scared or anything.

307
00:20:57,647 --> 00:21:02,198
Gloomy? You kiddin'? It's the
most beautiful spot in the world.

308
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:05,398
Dogs travel for years
just to be right here.

309
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,439
Here? I can't see why.

310
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:12,605
That's cos you're looking
at the bowl half empty.

311
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,923
See this? It's the polar ice caps.

312
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,527
Balto, those are broken bottles.

313
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:21,764
And they're not half empty,
they're all empty.

314
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,361
- The sun.
- Oh, Balto...

315
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,683
And... to the north...

316
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:33,923
(Jenna) The northern lights!

317
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,561
Oh!

318
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:39,041
Oh, Balto, you're right.

319
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:41,760
It's beautiful.

320
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:45,123
Yeah.

321
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,044
Beautiful.

322
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:51,836
(Footsteps)

323
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:57,760
(Doctor) Good night, Rosy.
(Rosy) I'm so cold.

324
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:02,278
I have another blanket for you here.
Stay warm and get some rest.

325
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,562
Doctor, how is she?

326
00:22:10,607 --> 00:22:14,077
Exhausted from coughing.
Her fever's getting worse.

327
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:17,119
(Doctor) Looks like diphtheria.

328
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:20,477
She's the 18th case this week.

329
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:25,915
And I'm out of antitoxin.

330
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,685
(Jenna trembling)

331
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:29,638
Jenna. Jenna, I'm sorry.

332
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:33,157
Jenna, I...
I didn't mean to upset you.

333
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:36,836
- I shouldn't have taken you there.
- No, I'm glad you did.

334
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:38,878
(Crashing)

335
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:40,724
Steele.

336
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,361
Well, well.

337
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:47,366
What's wrong with this picture?
Jenna, join me for dinner.

338
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,319
You start at one end,
I'll start at the other.

339
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:53,359
When we get to the middle,
well... (Chuckles)

340
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,762
- You tell me.
- All right, Steele.

341
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,798
- No, Balto.
- (Barks weakly)

342
00:22:57,847 --> 00:23:00,407
(Jenna and Steele laughing)

343
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:04,958
- Gee, Steele...
- (Fire roaring)

344
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:07,999
...I have to admit your offer
is very tempting.

345
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,356
It is. (Chuckling)

346
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,883
But these days I prefer my meat...
cooked.

347
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:20,923
- (Howling)
- Come on, let's go!

348
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,877
(Man) What's all the noise?

349
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:28,476
- I think it's over here.
- (Balto) Jenna, come on.

350
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,437
Looks like Balto's found your meat.

351
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:42,196
Good thing Steele was here.
Good boy, you've earned these.

352
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:46,206
Besides, I can't use 'em after
that wild animal's touched 'em.

353
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:50,604
Go on, get out of here, you thief!
Come on, Jenna, let's go home.

354
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:57,757
(Telegraph wire beeping)

355
00:23:57,807 --> 00:24:00,560
Anchorage. Stop.

356
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,723
Repeat, urgent request.

357
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:06,442
More diphtheria antitoxin. Stop.

358
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,604
Nome in grave danger. Stop.

359
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,320
Please help. Stop.

360
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:28,637
(Telegraph operator)
<i>Nome, pack ice closing in.</i>

361
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:32,919
<i>Cannot ship antitoxin by sea.</i>

362
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,800
<i>Will try by air.</i>

363
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:45,085
<i>Nome, storm at airport.</i>

364
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:49,598
<i>Planes grounded until storm clears.</i>

365
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,803
<i>Many regrets.</i>

366
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:54,884
<i>From Juneau, Office of the Governor,</i>

367
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:59,045
<i>we are shipping antitoxin by rail.
Stop.</i>

368
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:01,601
<i>Train line ends at town of Nenana.</i>

369
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:04,161
<i>Select fastest dogs for sled team.</i>

370
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:08,405
<i>To carry antitoxin
from Nenana to Nome. Stop.</i>

371
00:25:08,447 --> 00:25:12,599
<i>God willing,
train will make it through. Stop.</i>

372
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:19,157
(Man) ...select the fastest dogs for
the sled team to fetch the antitoxin,

373
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:22,199
the race is from...
(Becomes indistinct)

374
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:30,159
Just look at him.
He's gonna save the entire town.

375
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:33,643
He's positively... magnesium!

376
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,645
It's not exactly
a one-dog show, Dixie.

377
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:39,679
They're racing
to be on the dog sled team.

378
00:25:39,727 --> 00:25:42,958
What's with you, Jenna?
Steele's a genuine hero.

379
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,237
But do you give him a sniff?

380
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:48,962
That's because Jenna
is running with Balto.

381
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:53,364
She was seen in the boiler room
the other night with Balto.

382
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:56,604
They went in together
and they left together.

383
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:59,525
I heard it all from
a very reliable source.

384
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,444
And don't bother to deny it.

385
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:03,523
Well, then I won't.

386
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,400
Oh! I'm speechless.

387
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:09,405
All mushers, get your dogs ready!

388
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,644
- The race is about to begin!
- Wait! Balto!

389
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:16,999
Racing is a spectator sport.
It requires very little preparation.

390
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,038
Aaahh! Whew!

391
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:21,681
You sit, you arrange refreshments.

392
00:26:21,727 --> 00:26:23,604
You like potato chip?

393
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,805
I'm not watching the race,
I'm running it.

394
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:33,836
- You said what?
- Look, I wanna help Rosy get better.

395
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:35,957
I can get that medicine through.

396
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:37,838
First... First...

397
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:42,722
They wouldn't put you in a sled team
if you did win, which won't happen.

398
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,725
- And if it did, it wouldn't matter.
- Boris,

399
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:49,601
did you ever think maybe you're
the reason the other geese fly south?

400
00:26:49,647 --> 00:26:52,525
If only your feet
were as fast as your mouth.

401
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:55,286
- (Man) Dogs to the line!
- They're starting.

402
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,283
- Wish me luck.
- Luck?

403
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:01,559
I don't wish you luck,
I wish you sense!

404
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,078
Good luck, kiddo.

405
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,083
Balto? What are you, nuts?

406
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,563
Steele catches you here,
he'll turn you into kibble!

407
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:14,441
Let the half-dog run. It will be fun
making him eat our snow.

408
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,398
Get set.

409
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:19,245
- Balto?
- What does he think he's doing?

410
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:22,916
(Both panting and grunting)

411
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,082
(Growls)

412
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:26,561
Oh, Balto, come on, come on!

413
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,882
Balto, go!

414
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:34,886
- Ohhh!
- (Evil laughing)

415
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:36,838
Hey! That's a foul!

416
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:40,163
Where's the referee? Is he blind?

417
00:27:43,207 --> 00:27:46,165
(Boris)
Go, Balto, go! Jump, jump, jump!

418
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,846
Hey! That's my boy!

419
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:50,798
Go, Balto!

420
00:27:53,607 --> 00:27:56,167
(Boris) Balto, where are you going?

421
00:27:56,207 --> 00:28:00,519
That's the long way...
Balto, get back in the race!

422
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,240
- Huh?
- Sorry!

423
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:12,401
Who's eating whose snow now, mutt?

424
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:14,756
(Cheering)

425
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:17,559
Time!

426
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:19,837
- What?!
- Ho-ho-ho!

427
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:23,436
Did I teach him well?.
I could kiss that crazy pooch.

428
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,477
Nikki, Kaltag, Star, move it.
We're strapping up.

429
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:35,995
Hey, now, just a second here, Steele.

430
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,117
I was the fastest dog.

431
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,603
You were the fastest... what?

432
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:45,276
Do you honestly think any musher
would put you on his team?

433
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:48,205
- You're really mixed-up!
- Steele!

434
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:52,479
It doesn't matter who's on the team
as long as the medicine gets through.

435
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,518
Stop being such a glory hound.

436
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,764
You're a hundred per cent right,
Jenna. I... I...

437
00:28:57,807 --> 00:29:00,196
I wasn't thinking about the children.

438
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:04,877
The important thing is to get the
medicine, and that's what I'll do.

439
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:08,317
And when I come back I'm gonna
fold you five ways...

440
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,801
and leave you for a cat toy.

441
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:13,236
(Man) Good dog, Steele.

442
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:16,597
Good boy! Now, let's take a look
at our winner here.

443
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:20,083
- Huh? (Growls)
- Let's take a look at our winner.

444
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:22,357
Aaah!

445
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,682
Ah, we can't trust this one.

446
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,082
- He's part wolf.
- See those teeth?

447
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:28,879
He might turn on me.

448
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:32,124
Nikki, Kaltag, Star! Let's go!

449
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:34,767
Hmph.

450
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:43,037
- Balto, I'm sorry...
- Better not talk to me, Jenna.

451
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:46,557
- I might turn on you.
- Balto, wait. Balto!

452
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:54,916
As long as there's hope
for those kids, I'll keep this lit.

453
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,798
It'll guide the team back.

454
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:59,805
Easy, easy. Back, back.

455
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:05,359
(Man) The sooner they leave,
the sooner they're back.

456
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:09,116
(Musher) Stretch out, now.
Stretch out, Star.

457
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:12,045
Steele! Hyah! Giddap! Hyah!

458
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:15,796
(Cheering and whistling)

459
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:50,598
(Whistle blows)

460
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:55,804
Easy with that.

461
00:30:56,967 --> 00:31:00,243
All right, now make sure
you lash her down tight.

462
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:02,278
Giddap, Steele! Giddap!

463
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,160
- Mush!
- Take care now, y'hear?

464
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,995
- Good luck!
- Go on, boys, go on! Move along.

465
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:16,875
(Dogs straining and grunting)

466
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,645
(Grunting) Come on.

467
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,525
Steele!

468
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:30,162
Maybe we should go back. We're lost!

469
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:33,597
I am not lost!

470
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:36,002
Lost? Heh-heh. Did I say lost?

471
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:37,844
You didn't let me finish.

472
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:40,355
- I wanted to say... Aaah!
- This way!

473
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:46,397
(Telegraph wire beeping)

474
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:55,244
(Barking)

475
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:59,041
It's terrible, my friends.
Just terrible.

476
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:02,921
Steele and his team... are lost.

477
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:05,765
- No! Steele?
- What do you mean?

478
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,401
- When?
- They missed the second checkpoint.

479
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:10,563
They're off the trail.

480
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,598
Can't they send another team?

481
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:15,480
It's too dangerous
for us and our men.

482
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:17,757
What about... them little ones?

483
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:20,924
The medicine won't be here in time.

484
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:23,441
We're going to lose them.

485
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:27,477
Rosy.

486
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:29,722
(Shivering, moaning)

487
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:35,724
Please, Doctor,
it's the only medicine we got.

488
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,917
OK.

489
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,558
Jenna?

490
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,917
(Hammering)

491
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,480
Rosy.

492
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,279
Balto, please.
Don't go crazy on me now.

493
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:00,844
This is foolishness.

494
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:04,004
You will die like a dog!
Oh, uh, no offence.

495
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:05,162
Whoa!

496
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:09,763
(Whimpers)

497
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:12,640
(Boris) You will be frozen stiff
by morning!

498
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:18,036
When you are big frozen-stiff
statue named Balto,

499
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:20,203
don't come running to me!

500
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:22,044
- Whoa!
- Hoo-hoo!

501
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:24,362
- (Muk) He says...
- "Where is he going?"

502
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:28,082
He's going into freezing coldness
to find a dog he doesn't like

503
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:31,437
to bring medicine back to a town
that doesn't like him!

504
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,240
Oh, no! I'm beginning
to understand the bear!

505
00:34:36,127 --> 00:34:38,357
Yes! Yes! Count us in!

506
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:40,278
Bears! Dogs!

507
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,040
(Muffled) Balto! Balto! Put me down!

508
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:52,207
No brains at all! Might as well
be talking to hu... mans.

509
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,124
(Shivering)

510
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:06,205
So, let's go get the medicine.

511
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,477
Wait a minute. Now you're coming?

512
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:12,202
Spending days in bitter cold,
facing wild animals,

513
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,283
risking death from exposure...

514
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:17,524
is like holiday in old country.

515
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:22,240
(Muk) Oh! Great!
We're goin' on holiday!

516
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:56,523
Balto?

517
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,517
Good, Balto!

518
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,842
You took on the roughest, toughest,

519
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:05,640
meanest tree in the forest...
and you won.

520
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:08,042
- I'm marking the trail.
- Huh?

521
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:11,159
He's marking our trail.
He's very clever.

522
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:16,083
(Boris) And here
I've been dropping bread crumbs!

523
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:21,765
(Muk) I spy with my little eye

524
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:24,640
something beginning with "S".

525
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,965
Steele.

526
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:49,476
- Ohh.
- (Boris) Hey!

527
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:51,245
Bears!

528
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:54,160
Come on.

529
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:57,562
Steele and his team passed this way.

530
00:36:57,607 --> 00:36:59,598
Boy, is he lost.

531
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,398
(Musher) Go!

532
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,558
Steele!

533
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:11,598
We're going in circles!

534
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,444
- What?
- Gaa-aaah!

535
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:18,083
Circles is a good thing. I mean,
they're, uh... They're circular.

536
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:21,563
I know what I'm doing! It's...

537
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:26,035
It's... this way! Come on!

538
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:27,918
Waa-aaah!

539
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:34,882
(Musher) Whoa! Whoa, Steele!

540
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,845
(Barking and yelping)

541
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:53,966
(Groaning and yelping)

542
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,521
Aaaah!

543
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,162
Ohh! I hit my head on somethin'.

544
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,084
Yeah. My head.

545
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:15,163
Looks like he's hurt bad, Steele.

546
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:17,767
W-What are we gonna do now, Steele?

547
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,877
(Shivering and panting)

548
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:22,600
(Wind howling)

549
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:35,965
(Muk) Whoo! Yes!

550
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:39,079
- (Luk whimpering)
- Ha ha! Whoo!

551
00:38:41,087 --> 00:38:43,999
Shh! Aah!

552
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:47,484
Brilliant! Right on the beak!
What a bull's-eye!

553
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:51,843
That did it! Who did that?

554
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,764
- (Whimpers)
- I-It was him.

555
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:59,923
(Luk whimpers)

556
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:01,798
(Faint growling)

557
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,998
Guys, I think...

558
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:12,878
(Growling)

559
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:16,802
I think we should keep moving.

560
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,959
Is that your answer to all problems?
Motion?

561
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:21,918
(Back creaks)

562
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:23,798
(Honking)

563
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,122
Yeah, yeah! It's good.

564
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,044
Come on! Let's get going.

565
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:30,885
"Come on, boys. Let's go, boys.
Faster, boys."

566
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:33,202
Easy to say for a guy with four legs!

567
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,519
OK, that's it.

568
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:41,526
Is time for goose to
kick a little bear butt.

569
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,597
Aha! Finally!

570
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:48,640
Your old Uncle Boris
is making an impression!

571
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,564
Now what?

572
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:54,485
(Growling)

573
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:08,526
Aaaah!

574
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:21,241
Help!

575
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:28,117
Aaaah!

576
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:38,878
Aaaaah!

577
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:44,437
Jenna?

578
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,965
Aaah!

579
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:26,320
Balto!

580
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:30,560
(Ice cracking)

581
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:50,686
Balto!

582
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:54,322
- Aah-aaah!
- Balto!

583
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:57,761
No!

584
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,799
- (Muk) Geronimo!
- (Luk humming Cavalry Charge)

585
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,084
Luk! Muk!

586
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,004
They cannot swim!

587
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:14,766
What? Polar bears who can't swim?

588
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:21,717
(Blubbering)

589
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:31,199
He's drowning!

590
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:33,806
No!

591
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:37,198
Well?

592
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:39,636
Yaa-oww! I don't see them.

593
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:44,398
Where are they?

594
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,797
(Rumbling)

595
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:54,604
- Balto!
- Muk! Luk!

596
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:58,402
Balto!

597
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,123
Come to life. Come to life.

598
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,078
Breathe! Come on!

599
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:14,244
Is he be OK? He's not breathing.
He doesn't look very well.

600
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,278
Stop hitting him, Uncle Boris!

601
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:21,157
Balto, I was so scared
I got people bumps.

602
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,284
Boris...

603
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:29,285
I know you think
this trip is crazy, but...

604
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:32,244
I'm glad you came.

605
00:43:32,287 --> 00:43:36,041
Who else should you bring on a wild
goose chase but a goose, hmm?

606
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:38,476
- Are you OK?
- Are you OK? Jen...

607
00:43:38,527 --> 00:43:42,884
I'm fine. A message came,
we have to take the mountain trail.

608
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:46,237
But if we take Eagle Pass,
it'll save us half a day.

609
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:50,360
It's blocked. The mountain trail
is dangerous, but we can do it.

610
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:54,036
I'm beginning to see
there isn't anything you can't do.

611
00:43:54,087 --> 00:43:56,396
I'm seeing a few things too,

612
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:58,563
and it's making the ice melt.

613
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:04,081
I hate bears!

614
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:07,756
You guys oughta learn how to swim.
You'd be very good at it.

615
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,083
(Whimpering)

616
00:44:11,127 --> 00:44:15,040
0f course we were in the water!
We were moving, we got wet...

617
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:19,883
Luk! We were swimming!

618
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,638
Ohh! Clumsy.

619
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:27,764
- No, you're not. You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

620
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:29,604
Oww!

621
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:34,162
Maybe I'm not so fine.

622
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:37,040
- You should go ahead without me.
- Jenna...

623
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:41,126
I'll be slowing everyone down.
Rosy can't hold out much longer.

624
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:47,326
Muk, you and Luk carry
Jenna back to town on this.

625
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:51,963
And this time don't take time out
for a swim!

626
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:54,043
You can make sure of that, Boris.

627
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:57,318
You're gonna lead them home.
Just follow my marks.

628
00:44:57,367 --> 00:45:00,484
- You're going alone?
- Won't be the first time.

629
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:03,997
Here.
Afraid it won't keep you very warm.

630
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:06,515
Yeah, it will.

631
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,163
(Luk crying)

632
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:14,483
Well, of course
Balto will come back.

633
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:17,041
He's Balto, isn't he?

634
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:20,079
Hey! I'm coming back
with the medicine.

635
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:21,799
I promise, Jenna.

636
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:24,042
Go ahead, guys. Take her home.

637
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:27,477
Balto, I do not like
leaving you out here alone.

638
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:30,564
Who's going to tell you
how cold you are?

639
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:32,643
Boris.

640
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:34,803
They need you even more than I do.

641
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:41,765
Let me tell you something, Balto.

642
00:45:41,807 --> 00:45:45,083
A dog cannot make this journey alone.

643
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:50,366
But maybe a wolf can.

644
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:55,205
You two balls of fluff! Let's move!

645
00:45:55,247 --> 00:45:57,363
Hey! Two, three, four!

646
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:00,046
(Telegraph wire beeping)
<i>Nome. Stop.</i>

647
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:04,319
<i>Cannot send more antitoxin. Stop.</i>

648
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:08,406
<i>Weather too severe. Stop.</i>

649
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:12,156
<i>Lost sled team only hope. Stop.</i>

650
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:15,597
<i>Our prayers are with them.</i>

651
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,036
<i>Anchorage. Stop.</i>

652
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:46,045
Steele.

653
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:56,838
Oh!

654
00:46:59,447 --> 00:47:01,119
Balto!

655
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,635
- Is that Balto?
- How did you find us?

656
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:08,477
- Is anyone hurt?
- Everyone... is... fine.

657
00:47:08,527 --> 00:47:12,566
Yeah, but our musher hit his head
and he didn't get up.

658
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:15,599
- And he's not movin'.
- All right, follow me.

659
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:17,399
I can lead you home.

660
00:47:17,447 --> 00:47:20,325
We don't need your help!

661
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,517
M-Maybe we should listen to him.

662
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,278
How would youse get us home?

663
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:29,603
Well, I marked the trail, like this.

664
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,444
- Oh! Yeah!
- Ohh!

665
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:35,366
I'll get us back.
I'm the lead dog. I'm in charge.

666
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:39,195
Then let me take back the medicine.
They're getting sicker.

667
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:46,160
Touch that box
and I'll tear you apart.

668
00:47:46,207 --> 00:47:49,085
- Two bones says Steele takes him.
- You're on.

669
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:54,444
Steele, I'm not leaving
without that medicine.

670
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:58,680
Who do you think you are?

671
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:00,877
Hey, this is gonna be good.

672
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:05,478
Since... Since when do you need
a pedigree to help someone?

673
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,042
Steele.

674
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:11,203
Let me help you.

675
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:13,124
(Nikki) Look at his eyes!

676
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,798
- He'll feel that tomorrow.
- He's feeling it now!

677
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,485
Ouch!

678
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,404
(Grunts)

679
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,563
I don't want to fight.

680
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,484
(Growling quietly)

681
00:48:34,927 --> 00:48:37,566
- Whoa! That can't be legal!
- Yeah!

682
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:41,764
(Grunting)

683
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:47,005
That stuff is fragile!

684
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:49,845
What's with Steele?
Balto wants to help.

685
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:52,117
Whoa!

686
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:53,998
(Screams)

687
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:03,244
(Laughing)

688
00:49:05,847 --> 00:49:08,202
Ah! Look!

689
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:12,318
Huh?

690
00:49:21,847 --> 00:49:24,566
Aaah!

691
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:45,318
(Musher groaning) Oh, good boy.

692
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:47,642
Ahh.

693
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:03,082
(Panting)

694
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:05,197
(Groaning)

695
00:50:05,247 --> 00:50:07,078
Mush!

696
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:13,523
Go ahead, wolf-dog!
You'll never get home!

697
00:50:14,687 --> 00:50:17,360
I'll make sure of that.

698
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,998
I'll show 'em.

699
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:24,323
Why not this way?
How about over here?

700
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:27,887
Oops! Wrong way! (Sinister chuckling)

701
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:32,285
Oh, no.

702
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,199
Which way, Balto, which way?

703
00:50:38,247 --> 00:50:41,045
- Which way?
- Uh, this way.

704
00:50:54,247 --> 00:50:55,999
Huh?

705
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:02,726
- Why are you taking us in circles?
- I'm not!

706
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:06,521
I mean, I don't know. It's Steele.

707
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:09,445
Maybe we was
better off with him there.

708
00:51:09,487 --> 00:51:11,398
No! Come on. Mush!

709
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:14,405
(Star) Whoa-ohh!

710
00:51:18,127 --> 00:51:20,846
Balto, slow down! Wait... Uhh!

711
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,645
Hey! Hey! Goin' too fast!

712
00:51:44,407 --> 00:51:45,886
Look out!

713
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:53,003
(Star) All right!

714
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:56,403
- Good catch, Balto!
- (Rumbling)

715
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,722
Aaaah!

716
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:11,966
I don't get it,

717
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:15,204
how could Balto hope to
find Steele and his team?

718
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:17,124
They were off the trail.

719
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,203
Well, he's... tracking them.

720
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:21,124
That mutt?

721
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:24,443
Tracking a championship team
in a blizzard?

722
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,683
- (Door opens)
- (All gasp)

723
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:33,720
- Balto?
- Steele!

724
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:36,486
- You're alive!
- You're back!

725
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:40,156
- Where ya been?
- Are ya OK?

726
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:42,402
Steele, w-where are the others?

727
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:47,441
- What happened to you?
- Well, one by one they... fell.

728
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,081
Frozen, barely alive.

729
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:56,286
I pulled four onto the sled.

730
00:52:56,327 --> 00:52:59,125
Three more on my back!

731
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:03,846
And, uh, I walked...

732
00:53:03,887 --> 00:53:05,764
and I walked,

733
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,640
but i-it was just...
it was too late.

734
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:10,598
- Ohh.
- They were...

735
00:53:10,647 --> 00:53:13,480
- What about the medicine?
- Yeah!

736
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,836
Well, uh, I... I went on,

737
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:18,481
d-dragging the medicine alone...

738
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:20,085
all alone...

739
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:22,083
and... and then suddenly...

740
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:26,160
that wolf-dog appeared, Balto.

741
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:29,404
H-He demanded I let him
take the medicine.

742
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:35,522
You know, he just wanted
so much to be a hero in your eyes.

743
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:38,445
And h-he grabbed the crate,

744
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:42,277
but he couldn't handle it.

745
00:53:42,327 --> 00:53:44,761
H-He couldn't see the patch of ice...

746
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:47,367
Th-The snow, the wind and...

747
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:49,762
And then the log and the cliff...

748
00:53:49,807 --> 00:53:52,446
Well, he just didn't have a ch...

749
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:53,840
He just...

750
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:56,685
(Sobbing) I'm sorry.

751
00:53:56,807 --> 00:53:58,604
And then...

752
00:54:00,927 --> 00:54:03,361
My bandana!

753
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:07,639
He... made me promise
to take care of you, Jenna.

754
00:54:07,687 --> 00:54:09,837
Ohh.

755
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:14,644
You're lying.

756
00:54:14,687 --> 00:54:17,963
- (Dogs gasping)
- Steele's lying.

757
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:19,884
Balto's alive.

758
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:22,680
And he's coming home.

759
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:28,403
Uh... Well, you know,
she needs a little time.

760
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,324
(Sighs)

761
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:09,916
The sun. Ice caps.

762
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:24,805
Balto.

763
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:38,245
Rosy.

764
00:56:12,647 --> 00:56:14,160
Hmm?

765
00:56:26,247 --> 00:56:28,556
(Boris) <i>Let me tell you something.</i>

766
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:33,044
<i>A dog cannot
make this journey alone.</i>

767
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:36,966
<i>But maybe a wolf can.</i>

768
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:17,165
(Shivering)

769
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:19,516
(Howling)

770
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:20,966
(All) Huh?

771
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:24,044
Things are not bad enough.
Now we got wolves.

772
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:26,442
(All) Wolves?

773
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:29,638
- Hey, over here!
- What is it? What?

774
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:32,884
- Balto?
- And he's got the medicine!

775
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,680
(Nikki) Come on, Balto.
Youse can make it.

776
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:42,120
That's the most amazing,
fantastic, incredible...

777
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,886
- Yeah!
- That's the most phenomenal...

778
00:57:44,927 --> 00:57:47,202
That's good! Ohh!

779
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:51,001
(Nikki) Hey, he has got the feet
of a wolf there.

780
00:57:51,087 --> 00:57:54,079
- Come on, Balto.
- Keep tryin', baby.

781
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:57,324
- Pull! Pull! You got it!
- Just keep pullin'!

782
00:57:57,367 --> 00:58:00,484
- You're almost there.
- Yeah! You got it!

783
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:03,837
- Come on, Balto!
- Come on, let's go!

784
00:58:03,887 --> 00:58:07,243
- Let's go!
- Yes! You're there!

785
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:10,404
- That's it, that's it!
- All right!

786
00:58:10,447 --> 00:58:13,280
- Yeah! All right!
- You did it!

787
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,397
Congratulations! That was great!

788
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:51,685
- (Balto) Hyah!
- (All barking)

789
00:59:06,007 --> 00:59:07,838
Yaaah!

790
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:09,445
(Cracking)

791
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:13,237
Come on! Mush!

792
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,926
(Yelping)

793
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,445
(Grunting and straining)

794
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:46,518
Eeeh... Ahh-choo!

795
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:49,764
- (Sneeze echoing)
- Gesundheit.

796
01:00:03,327 --> 01:00:05,158
(Rumbling)

797
01:00:34,087 --> 01:00:36,885
(Whining and shivering)

798
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:52,400
Huh?

799
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:56,235
(All gasping and whispering)

800
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:58,642
Heh!

801
01:00:58,687 --> 01:01:00,678
Errr!

802
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:02,604
Heh-heh!

803
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:04,524
Ohhh!

804
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:07,205
Huh?

805
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,158
(Whispering continues)

806
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,198
Shh!

807
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:16,556
Yeh... Ehh...

808
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:18,484
Yaaah...

809
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:42,361
Mush!

810
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,039
Yaah!

811
01:02:18,327 --> 01:02:20,795
(Whispering)

812
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:25,765
Oh, dear.

813
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,641
Come back to bed.

814
01:02:32,887 --> 01:02:35,196
Here, drink this.

815
01:02:35,247 --> 01:02:36,600
Oh.

816
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:39,524
Thanks.

817
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:43,198
(Sighs)

818
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:56,362
(Luk whimpering and crying)

819
01:02:56,407 --> 01:02:58,284
(Muk) Balto.

820
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:00,158
(Sniffling)

821
01:03:03,287 --> 01:03:05,278
B-B-Balto.

822
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:07,238
(Whimpering)

823
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:13,047
(Howling in the distance)

824
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:15,600
Balto.

825
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:20,323
Balto's back!

826
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,046
Jenna.

827
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:33,842
(Balto howling)

828
01:03:36,607 --> 01:03:38,484
- Ah!
- The team!

829
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,597
They made it!

830
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,204
Of course, as you know,

831
01:04:05,247 --> 01:04:07,317
I swam and I swam.

832
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,597
I was freezing cold. And then...

833
01:04:11,687 --> 01:04:14,406
Finally, I said, Steele,

834
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:17,325
you'll have to gnaw
your way to the surface.

835
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:19,642
- (Balto howling)
- So I... What?

836
01:04:19,687 --> 01:04:22,565
It's Balto. With the medicine!

837
01:04:23,607 --> 01:04:25,086
Oh.

838
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,561
Steele, you are positively...

839
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,161
disposable!

840
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,686
Huh?

841
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,357
(All growling)

842
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,045
OK, OK. I can explain.

843
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:40,964
- Tell me about it.
- Hmph!

844
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:42,884
You guys weren't there, so...

845
01:04:42,927 --> 01:04:46,203
Wait a minute, guys.
Wait just a second. Please?

846
01:04:46,247 --> 01:04:47,396
Get lost.

847
01:04:48,887 --> 01:04:51,799
(People talking excitedly)

848
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:12,396
Steady, there. Easy, now.
That's had a long journey.

849
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,403
- How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.

850
01:05:32,207 --> 01:05:34,641
Good dog, Balto.

851
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:36,086
Dear, dear Balto.

852
01:05:37,127 --> 01:05:39,402
Good boy!

853
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:42,245
Aaaah! Not dog! Not wolf!

854
01:05:42,287 --> 01:05:44,676
You're a hero!

855
01:05:44,727 --> 01:05:47,366
(Muk) Balto!

856
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:57,843
Come on, boy.
There's someone wants to see you.

857
01:05:57,927 --> 01:05:59,758
(Man) Thank you! Thank you!

858
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,640
(Applause, cheering)

859
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:15,725
Mommy?

860
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,598
Rosy, darling. Ohh!

861
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:20,207
- I fell asleep.
- Rosy.

862
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:26,117
(Mom) It's such a relief.

863
01:06:33,887 --> 01:06:35,320
Balto.

864
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:38,283
I'd be lost without you.

865
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:41,204
(Coughing)

866
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:47,879
Jenna.

867
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:05,484
(Applause, cheering)

868
01:07:08,007 --> 01:07:10,077
(Star) Way to go, Balto!

869
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:13,244
He has the most endurance,
fidelity, intelligence!

870
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:15,676
They should build a statue of him!

871
01:07:15,727 --> 01:07:18,446
- You said it!
- I did?

872
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:32,116
(Howling)

873
01:07:43,687 --> 01:07:46,485
This is it, Grandma.
Blaze found it.

874
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:49,840
Oh. Yes.

875
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:56,562
(Grandma) What does it say?

876
01:07:56,607 --> 01:08:00,566
"Dedicated to the..." Indomable?

877
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:02,484
Indomitable.

878
01:08:02,527 --> 01:08:07,282
"Indomitable spirit
of the sled dogs..."

879
01:08:07,327 --> 01:08:10,160
(Grandma)
"...that relayed antitoxin

880
01:08:10,207 --> 01:08:15,520
"600 miles from Nenana
to the relief of stricken Nome...

881
01:08:15,607 --> 01:08:18,565
"in the winter of 1925."

882
01:08:18,607 --> 01:08:22,520
(Girl)
"Endurance, fidelity, intelligence."

883
01:08:22,567 --> 01:08:25,365
Balto really did do all of that,
didn't he?

884
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:27,602
Oh, yes, sweetheart, he really did.

885
01:08:27,647 --> 01:08:30,286
And today they run
the Iditarod Dog Race

886
01:08:30,327 --> 01:08:33,205
over the very path
he and the others took.

887
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:36,876
- Can Blaze do that too, Grandma?
- Maybe.

888
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:38,963
With practice.

889
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:43,085
A lot of practice.

890
01:08:43,127 --> 01:08:45,561
Come on, Blaze. Come on! Mush!

891
01:08:52,487 --> 01:08:54,557
Thank you, Balto.

892
01:08:54,607 --> 01:08:57,485
I would've been lost without you.

893
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:02,278
Grandma Rosy!

894
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:09,083
Grandma Rosy, come on!

895
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:33,477
 Deep in the night

896
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:37,600
 The winds blow cold

897
01:09:37,647 --> 01:09:41,322
 And in a heartbeat

898
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:44,677
 The fear takes hold

899
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:49,203
 Deep in the storm

900
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:53,160
 There's a place
that's soft and still

901
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:57,280
 Where the road waits to be taken

902
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:01,161
 If you only will

903
01:10:01,207 --> 01:10:05,086
 The voices inside you

904
01:10:05,127 --> 01:10:09,006
 Can lead you so astray

905
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:12,960
 Believe in what you dream

906
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:14,725
 Don't turn away

907
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:17,122
 Don't you turn away

908
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:20,796
 Reach for the light

909
01:10:20,847 --> 01:10:24,840
 You might touch the sky

910
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:28,516
 Stand on a mountain top

911
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:32,879
 And see yourself flyin'

912
01:10:32,927 --> 01:10:36,442
 Reach for the light

913
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:40,321
 To capture a star

914
01:10:40,367 --> 01:10:44,360
 Come out of the darkness

915
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,284
 And find out

916
01:10:46,327 --> 01:10:50,366
 Who you are

917
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:59,920
 Somewhere in time

918
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:03,357
 The truth shines through

919
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:07,756
 And the spirit knows

920
01:11:07,807 --> 01:11:10,879
 What it has to do

921
01:11:12,087 --> 01:11:15,523
 Somewhere in you

922
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:19,526
 There's a power with no name

923
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:23,526
 It can rise to meet the moment

924
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:27,526
 And burn like a flame

925
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:31,480
 And you can be stronger

926
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:35,406
 Than any fear you know

927
01:11:35,447 --> 01:11:39,360
 Hold on to what you see

928
01:11:39,407 --> 01:11:41,204
 Don't let it go

929
01:11:41,247 --> 01:11:43,522
 Don't you let it go

930
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:47,196
 Reach for the light

931
01:11:47,247 --> 01:11:51,206
 You might touch the sky

932
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:55,126
 Stand on a mountain top

933
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:59,285
 And see yourself flyin'

934
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:02,842
 Reach for the light

935
01:12:02,887 --> 01:12:06,880
 To capture a star

936
01:12:06,927 --> 01:12:10,715
 Come out of the darkness

937
01:12:10,767 --> 01:12:12,598
 And find out

938
01:12:12,647 --> 01:12:16,196
 Who you are

939
01:12:16,247 --> 01:12:19,159
 There's no turning back

940
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:23,485
 And your destiny is callin'

941
01:12:23,527 --> 01:12:26,439
 Listen to the thunder roll

942
01:12:26,487 --> 01:12:28,239
 And let your heart

943
01:12:28,287 --> 01:12:30,721
 Break free

944
01:12:37,047 --> 01:12:39,277
 Whoa-ohh-ohh-ohh

945
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,838
 Reach for the light

946
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:50,005
 Reach for the light

947
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:53,039
 You might touch the sky

948
01:12:53,087 --> 01:12:57,922
 Stand on a mountain top
(Stand on a mountain top)

949
01:12:57,967 --> 01:13:02,518
 And see yourself flyin'
(See yourself flyin')

950
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:05,718
 Reach for the light

951
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:09,601
 To capture a star

952
01:13:09,647 --> 01:13:13,720
 Come out of the darkness

953
01:13:13,767 --> 01:13:17,760
 And find out who you

954
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:21,482
 Reach for the light

955
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:25,645
 You might touch the sky

956
01:13:25,687 --> 01:13:29,362
 Stand on a mountain top

957
01:13:29,407 --> 01:13:33,605
 And see yourself flyin'

958
01:13:33,647 --> 01:13:37,117
 Reach for the light

959
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:41,126
 To capture a star

960
01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:45,080
 Come out of the darkness

961
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:47,004
 And find out

962
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:51,837
 Who you are

963
01:13:56,087 --> 01:13:58,601
 Yeah-eah

964
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:02,686
 Yes, reach for the light 
