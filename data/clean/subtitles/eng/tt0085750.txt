control  this is venture one 
we re at 25 feet  headed
for the spanish galleon 
i can see you now 
hi  mike 
overman broke divers  rules
last night  out there 
went down to shackle
the sea gate alone 
if anything happened to him  the ocean
current would have washed him up here 
toward the center of the lagoon 
what about the filtration pipes 
no  it s too strong a
current moving the other way 
see  the flow s all
into the lagoon 
there s a million gallons of
fresh salt water every hour 
you think he could have gotten
trapped in the spanish galleon 
he could have gotten
caught in the superstructure 
would have kept him
from floating topside 
mike  oh  god 
for a second i thought   
yeah  yeah  i know it 
we call him oscar 
you stay here  kay  i ll go into the
galleon and take a closer look 
uh uh  mike

my guv nor s
the 16th earl of haddenfield 
shake hands with the first
calvin of sea world 
enchante  enchante  he
know french too  huh  
excuse me  gentlemen 
mr  bouchard   
wait a minute 
we re havin  dinner here 
this better be important 
it is  sir 
mike and dr  morgan
were pursued by a renegade shark
that got into our lagoon 
it is important  gentlemen 
better come with me 
believe me  calvin 
it was a great white 
it was about ten feet long  it was
exhibiting a typical feeding pattern 
on us  calvin 
the damn thing tried to feed on us 
exacfly 
now look 
where is it 
right here 
huh 
you know  cal  this
could be a stroke of luck 
if we kill this beastie
on camera 
i can guarantee you
media coverage 
lure him into a staging area 
and at the precise moment 
slit his belly wide open 
can you do that 
you try and stop him  mate 
that s how we earn our bread 
well  jack is oversimplifying
matters  as is usual 
but  yeah  i can do that 
  no 
  no 
what do you mean  no 
well  i don t know if it s
occurred to any of you all 
but there isn t a great white
alive in captivity anywhere 
now  we re unique here 
calvin  you know that 
if any facility can
maintain a white  it s us 
if we could dart him  tranquilize him 
we could get him in a holding tank   
hold it  this is crazy 
this is nuts 
white sharks are killers 
i know  em 
my father  my brother  myself 
they re murderers  no  kay 
calvin  they die magnificently 
that would really be a spectacular event 
no doubt about that  huh 
what are we doing  calvin 
planning a network special 
don t you realize that we could
be the first people on the planet
to have a great white alive 
not if my guv nor
gets it first  miss 
okay  say he kills it 
well  that s it 
it s one shot  over  gone 
but a live great white  now 
you think about that  calvin 
nightly bulletins on the
progress of the killer shark 
pictures of us nursing it
back to health
and lowering it
into a holding tank 
now  that s world news 
think of the lines at the gate 
then you miss
the sport of the kill 
now  wait up  jack 
wait up 
killing is guaranteed press 
but this other is much 
much more interesting 
okay 
this is ms 222 
this is quinaldine  but i had
to guesstimate the dosage 
kathy 
right  thanks  danny 
all right  we re ready
in control  you all set 
we re ready down here 
well  with those
tv monitors rolling 
you re gonna have more coverage
than a space launch around here 
good  just the way i like it 
right 
the color of your wet suit s
one hell of a choice 
the shark s gonna love you 
exactly 
it helps me
get the close ups 
you re the showman 
honey  you think this
suit s gonna protect you 
are you kidding 
have you felt the   
it won t bite through 
but it will yield to pressure 
so she might just get
a little squeeze 
oh  that s great news  look 
why do you have to do this 
why don t you let her majesty s
number one son take care of it  huh 
because it s my job  remember 
yeah  but i just don t
want it to be you

we have to do is pull the pin 
  what are those 
  mills bombs 
what 
mills bombs  sonny 
grenades  a chap in her majesty s
ordnance makes them up for rne 
baby claymores

strong goin  the other way 
we got a million gallons of sea water
flowing into the lagoon every hour

high pump rate  low outflow
and a pressure build up
on the inboard tunnel valve 
that s number two 
could be an obstruction 
well  that s not my department 
see if you can locate brody

tunnel sections together 
then we re gonna slap on a patch and
we re gonna weld the whole thing 
then we evacuate 
no  then we gotta put pressure
back into the tunnels 
then the watertight doors will
open up  then people go home 
hey  watch how you re cutting that thing

i have a statement to make 
was there an explosion 
what about the fire 
how many people are missing 
late this afternoon  as a
result of a minor disturbance 
there was a pressure failure in
one of the underwater tunnels
that are a major attraction
here at the park 
we estimate that 30 to 40 people
were in the process
of being evacuated
when the watertight safety doors
temporarily delayed their exit 
we re working right now
to release them
under the safest
possible circumstances 
in addition  seven visitors
were injured in our beach area 
that s all for now 
give me a break  boys 
what is this we ve heard
about a large shark

lure him back into the pipe 
close the gates and then
dispose of him at our leisure 
meanwhile  you can weld
your tunnel patch
and then calvin can
evacuate the civilians
