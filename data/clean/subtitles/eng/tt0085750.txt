to tell them apart
kay cindys a lot larger
control this is venture one
were at 25 feet headed
for the spanish galleon
i can see you now
hi mike
overman broke divers rules
last night out there
went down to shackle
the sea gate alone
if anything happened to him the ocean
current would have washed him up here
toward the center of the lagoon
what about the filtration pipes
no its too strong a
current moving the other way
see the flows all
into the lagoon
theres a million gallons of
fresh salt water every hour
you think he could have gotten
trapped in the spanish galleon
he could have gotten
caught in the superstructure
would have kept him
from floating topside
mike oh god
for a second i thought
yeah yeah i know it
we call him oscar
you stay here kay ill go into the
galleon and take a closer look
uhuh mike
im goin with you
goddamn dolphins what
the hell are they doing
i dont know theyve been
acting strange for the last two days

calvin of sea world
enchante enchante he
know french too huh
excuse me gentlemen
mr bouchard
wait a minute
were havin dinner here
this better be important
it is sir
mike and dr morgan
were pursued by a renegade shark
that got into our lagoon
it is important gentlemen
better come with me
believe me calvin
it was a great white
it was about ten feet long it was
exhibiting a typical feeding pattern
on us calvin
the damn thing tried to feed on us
exacfly
now look
where is it
right here
huh
you know cal this
could be a stroke of luck
if we kill this beastie
on camera
i can guarantee you
media coverage
lure him into a staging area
and at the precise moment
slit his belly wide open
can you do that
you try and stop him mate
thats how we earn our bread
well jack is oversimplifying
matters as is usual
but yeah i can do that
no
no
what do you mean no
well i dont know if its
occurred to any of you all
but there isnt a great white
alive in captivity anywhere
now were unique here
calvin you know that
if any facility can
maintain a white its us
if we could dart him tranquilize him
we could get him in a holding tank
hold it this is crazy
this is nuts
white sharks are killers
i know em
my father my brother myself
theyre murderers no kay
calvin they die magnificently
that would really be a spectacular event
no doubt about that huh
what are we doing calvin
planning a network special
dont you realize that we could
be the first people on the planet
to have a great white alive
not if my guvnor
gets it first miss
okay say he kills it
well thats it
its one shot over gone
but a live great white now
you think about that calvin
nightly bulletins on the
progress of the killer shark
pictures of us nursing it
back to health
and lowering it
into a holding tank
now thats world news
think of the lines at the gate
then you miss
the sport of the kill
now wait up jack
wait up
killing is guaranteed press
but this other is much
much more interesting
okay
this is ms222
this is quinaldine but i had
to guesstimate the dosage
kathy
right thanks danny
all right were ready
in control you all set
were ready down here
well with those
tv monitors rolling
youre gonna have more coverage
than a space launch around here
good just the way i like it
right
the color of your wet suits
one hell of a choice
the sharks gonna love you
exactly
it helps me
get the closeups
youre the showman
honey you think this
suits gonna protect you
are you kidding
have you felt the
it wont bite through
but it will yield to pressure
so she might just get
a little squeeze
oh thats great news look
why do you have to do this
why dont you let her majestys
number one son take care of it huh
because its my job remember
yeah but i just dont
want it to be you
look you build all the stuff i swim
around in it that was the deal right
hmm

we have to do is pull the pin
what are those
mills bombs

eardrums but they do the trick

was there an explosion
what about the fire
how many people are missing
late this afternoon as a
result of a minor disturbance
there was a pressure failure in
one of the underwater tunnels
that are a major attraction
here at the park
we estimate that 30 to 40 people
were in the process
of being evacuated
when the watertight safety doors
temporarily delayed their exit
were working right now
to release them
under the safest
possible circumstances
in addition seven visitors
were injured in our beach area
thats all for now
give me a break boys
what is this weve heard
about a large shark

lure him back into the pipe
close the gates and then
dispose of him at our leisure
