and  uh  sign some autographs 
by grabthar s hammer  by the sons
of warvan  i shall avenge you 
by grabthar s   
next 
had i moved an inch
the beast would have killed me 
but my crew was in danger 
how did you know what to do 
come on  without my crew 
i m not a commander  huh 
and we all remember
what happened on enok vll 
you ve gotta admit 
they really do love him 
almost as much as he loves himself 
excuse me  commander  hey 
i was wondering if you could help
settle a dispute my crew and i have 
um  if you remember 
uh  in  quasar dilemma    
excuse me for a minute  fellas 
what about the relevant conundrum 
in episode 15   mist of delos v 
i got the feeling that you
and the commander had a thing 
did you 
no  the commander and i
never had a thing 
well  that s her story 
excuse me 
gwen 
gwen 
gwen 
  commander 
  excuse me 
i must speak to you 
it is of supreme importance 
we are thermians
and    we    need your help 
oh  oh  oh 
is this about that gig tomorrow 
hammer it out with my agent 
and make sure there s a limo 
last time i did one of these gigs 
they shoved me in a toyota 
remember  mum s the word 
  certainly  but um   
  mum 
mum  mum  mu um 
and    beautiful 
crewman madison 
the mist of this strange planet
is filling my head
with such thoughts 
it was cute when i didn t know you 
what a freak show  man 
oh  this is hilarious 
bunch of losers  beggin 
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop 
these guys haven t had
a real acting job for 20 years 
nesmith gets off on those retards
thinking he s a space commander 
and his friends can t stand him 
did you hear them ragging on him 
he has no idea he s a laughing stock 
even to his buddies 
  he s pathetic 
  come on 
  the galaxy quest dancers are on 
  whoo  full speed ahead  lieutenant 
hey  commander  uh 
so in  the quasar dilemma 
you used the auxiliary deck b   
get this   
deck b for gamma override 
but the online
blueprints indicate   
that deck b is independent
of the guidance matrix 
so where is the error in that 
it s just a television show 
that s all  ok 
right  but    we were wondering
if the quantum flux   
there is no quantum flux  there s no
auxiliary  there s no goddam ship 
you got it 
i mean it  alex  i ve never seen him
lose it like that  not to a fan 
i mean  it was just weird 
gwen  i have said it for years 
he s mentally unstable 
i    l m worried 
it just was not like him 
 as long as there is injustice 
 whenever a targathian baby
cries out 
 wherever a distress signal
sounds among the stars 
 we ll be there 
this fine ship  this fine crew  
  never give up   
   never give up   
 never surrender  
  can i help you 
  sir  this is terrible protocol 
  you shouldn t come here  man 
  i beg you to hear our plea 
we are thermians
from the klatu nebula 
our people are being slaughtered
by sarris of fatu krey 
we have met in negotiation  however 
our efforts have been disastrous 
please  commander 
you are our last hope 
  we have secured our limousine 
  what 
oh  oh  oh  oh 
um  it s the thing
for the thing that s  um   
ha  maybe i should get some pants on 
come on in 
commander 
i must say that
standing here in your presence   
is the greatest honour we
could ever have hoped to achieve 
that s    i really appreciate that 
would you look
for another shoe like this 
sir  i am lahnk 
senior requisition officer 
please let me know
if you have any requirements 
  weapons  documents  personnel 
  um  a coca cola 
sir  i am teb 
i would like to explain
our history in greater detail 
hey  how ya doin  
in the years following the great
nebula burst  our people were one   
what s your name 
  doesn t she talk 
  her translator is broken 
okey dokey 
you know  guys  i had a late night
with a kreemorian fangor beast
so    l m gonna just
shut my eyes for a bit 
go on  you know  i m listening
to everything you say  ok 
following the great nebula burst
our people were one people 
but then came the zactor migration 
and then the melosian shift
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land 
fighting among treeb sects
and largoths    ah  the foolishness 
and it was in this time
of dissension that sarris   
  commander  commander 
  hmm 
i m sorry  sir  but your presence
is requested on the command deck 
mm 
sir  sarris has moved the deadline 
we are approaching his ship now 
he wants an answer to his proposal 
i got most of it 
sarris is the bad guy 
yes  sir  he s a very bad man indeed 
he has tortured our scientists 
captured our females
for his own demented purposes   
yeah  do you have pages
or should i just wing this 
i am not sure i understand you 
  welcome to protector two 
  hi 
  would you like your uniform 
  i ll skip that 
i got this gig in van nuys

  as you wish 
  sir  it s sarris  he s here 
general  the thermians
have appointed a new commander
to handle the negotiations 
what 
this is great  usually it s
just cardboard walls in the garage 
sir  we apologise
for operating in low power mode
but we are experiencing
a    reflective flex field 
you know what i could use 
a cup holder and a couple of advil 
approaching  sir  command to slow 
set it on screensaver two 
we  you know    gotta   
oh  i m sorry
to break up the mood here 
um  slow it down to mark two 
lieutenant 
 i see fear 
   that is expected  
  mm hm 
   ahh  they bring a new commander  
  it s good 
   here are my demands  
  scary  it looks    real 
 and if i do not hear what i like
 then there will be blood and pain
as you cannot imagine   
   first     
  ahh  backwash 
 i require the omega 13 
 second  i will require
a technician     
okey dokey  let s fire
blue particle cannons full 
red particle cannons full 
gannet magnets  left and right
and let  em run all chutes 
and while you re at it 
toss that at  em  killer 
that should
take care of lobster head 
commander  where are you going

of your historical documents
we have studied
all of your missions and strategies 
you watch the show 
  lieutenant  historical documents 
  historical documents from out here 
yes  our society
had fallen into disarray 
our goals and values were scattered 
but we have modelled every aspect
of our society from your example 
and it has saved us 
your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity 
all you see has been taken
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents 
is this a    a spaceship 
no  this is a starport for the ship 
would you guys like to see the ship 
oh  my god 
it s real 
the generator room 
the beryllium sphere  of course 
the medical quarters are to the left 
we went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system   
  jason  what have you got us into 
  wow  the floors are so clean 
we re just negotiating a surrender 
no big deal 
   and the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely 
no big deal  are you crazy 
we have to get out of here 
  come on  guys 
  we re actors  not astronauts 
you guys wanna go home  we ll go
home   pay our bills  feed our fish

alexander  this is the role
of a lifetime  you wanna leave 
we have prepared
many of your esoteric dishes 
your monte cristo sandwich

i m just jazzed
about being on the show  man

we programmed the food synthesiser
based on the menu of your birthplace 
i don t care 
it tastes great 
are your kep mok bloodticks 
dr lazarus 
just like mother used to make 
so    tell me  mathesar 
this sarris person we re meeting 
what does he want 
he heard about the device   
the omega 13 
um  what is it  what does it do 
we don t know 
we were hoping
you could enlighten us 
oh  the omega 13 device 
we found that on an alien planet 
we don t know what it does either 
why not just turn it on and see 
it has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy 
if we were mistaken  the device
would cause a chain reaction   
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe 
has sarris seen any of the   
historical records 
no  thank god  he has not 
oh  so how does he know
about the omega 13 device 
our former commander
was not    strong 
former commander 
i am sorry  you deserve to be shown 
the tape was smuggled
off of sarris  ship 
originally  one of us tried to lead 
 ls that all 
 after three days of this 
you still require    incentive   
 i have told you
all i know  please  let me die  
 when i grow weary of
the noises you make you shall    die  
guys  hold on  you can t leave 
give me time to think 
  he wants to think
  there s nothing to think about 
i m not supposed to be here 
i m expendable 
i m the guy in the episode who dies
to prove it s serious 
  commander 
  prepare the pods for my crew 
sir  we can t  sarris will detonate
any objects leaving the ship 
  sarris 
  yes  sir  he s here 
your presence is required
on the command deck 
there s nobody here 
my people are talented scientists 
but our tactical simulations
have been disastrous 
i have raised sarris
on zeta frequency 
  mathesar   
   we meet again  commander  
hello  sarris  how you doin  
 better than my lieutenant 
 he failed to activate
the neutron armour
 as quickly as i d hoped
on our last encounter  
well  i m real sorry
about what happened before 
the whole thing was just a   
a misunderstanding 
 deliver the device to me 
or i will destroy your ship   
you know  um  we d like do that 
but frankly  we don t know
what it is or even where it is 
 you have 10 seconds   
i don t    10 seconds 
you know    ok  gosh darn it 
i give up  it s yours

  turbo s only for quick boosts 
  oh  like you know

  i don t think that s a cloud 
  mathesar  what is it

  thanks  mathesar 
alex  where are you going 
to see if there s a pub 
 forward thruster shaft 
87  damage 
 aft vector guards  96  damage 
 structural breaches
in quadrants 32  33  30     
  what about the engines 
   forward thrust shaft  87  damage  
computer  what about the engines 
why don t we have power 
 the beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress  
  it s fractured 
  can it be repaired 
  computer  can it be repaired 
   damage to sphere irreparable 
   new source of beryllium needed  
  we need another one 
you broke the bloody ship 
eh  ah    ahem  computer  is there
a replacement sphere on board 
computer  is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board 
 negative  no reserve beryllium
sphere exists on board  
no  we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board 
that is really getting annoying 
look  i have one job
on this lousy ship 
it s stupid  but i m gonna do it  ok 
sure  no problem 
a thousand apologies 
we have failed you 
how have you failed us 
we have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations 
the fault must lie with us 
with the ship 
no  it is not your fault 
and it s not the ship s fault 
it it s my fault  w we screwed   
we are not
the people you think we are 
i don t understand 
didn t you make any tv shows
on your planet  any theatre  films 
the historical documents
of your culture 
yes  in fact  we have begun
to follow your example 
no  not historical documents 
they re not all historical documents 
surely you don t think
that gilligan s island is a   
those poor people 
oh  brother 
we re screwed 
is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way   
that s contrary to reality 
ahh  you are speaking of   
  deception  lies 
  deception  lies 
we have only recently
become aware of this concept
in our dealings with sarris 
often  sarris will say
one thing and do another 
promise mercy 
but deliver destruction 
it is a concept we are learning
at some great cost 
but if you are saying you could
have traits in common with sarris   
 hey  commander  listen  we found
some beryllium on a nearby planet 
 we might be able to get there
 by reconfiguring the solar matrix in
parallel for endothermic propulsion 
 what do you think   
  we ll do that 
  all right 
th that s right again 
that s    c come on  group hug 
come on 
dr lazarus  i hope
i am not breaching protocol 
but i am so very humbled
to stand in your presence 
i have studied your missions
extensively 
though i am thermian  i have
lived my life by your philosophy 
by the code of the mak tar 
  oh  good  that s very nice 
  by grabthar s hammer  dr l   
  don t  i m not kidding 
  sorry  sir  i was only   
just don t 
yes  sir 
never give up  never surrender 
dr lazarus 
here is your surface mapper 
i have programmed the co ordinates
of a beryllium sphere
of sufficient density 
good luck  sir 
thanks 
you re doing good  tommy 
i changed my mind  i wanna go back 
after the fuss you made
about getting left behind 
but i thought i was the crewman
that stays on the ship
and something up there kills me 
but what if i m the guy who s
killed by a monster when we land 
  you won t die on the planet  guy 
  i m not  then what s my last name 
it s  uh  uh    i don t know 
nobody knows  do you know why 
because my character
isn t important enough 
because i m gonna die
five minutes in

  yes 
for all you know 
i m just crewman number six 
mommy  mommy  mommy

you could do better  laredo 
stop that laredo stuff 
we re screwed 
come on 
use some self control 
that s funny from a guy
who slept with every slave girl
and moon princess on the show 
if you d
been more supportive   
wow  must be
some sort of mining facility 
where are the miners 
something bad happened here 
will you relax 
there they are 
beryllium spheres  let s go

the core implosion is   
find them 
brandon  i see five ducts in here 
which way

 commander  what i d give
to see what you re seeing  
  what 
  you re deep in the omega 13 
 oh  it must be spectacular  
it doesn t look like much to me 
there s just these few walls
and this dumb spinning fan
that s in every single   
brandon 
what does the omega 13 device do 
 many believe
that it is a matter collapser  
a bomb capable of destroying
everything in 13 seconds 
 but myself and others are convinced
that it is a matter rearranger 
 a 13 second time jump to the past  
why 13 seconds  that s really
not enough time to do anything 
  time to redeem a single mistake 
  what 
we gotta turn off that valve 
their oxygen s almost gone 
listen  i ll go in  i ll create
a distraction  i ve got this 
i might be able
to hold him long enough 
  that s suicide 
  i m a glorified extra  fred 
i m a dead man anyway 
i d rather die a hero than a coward 
guy  guy 
maybe you re the plucky comic relief 
you ever think about that 
plucky 
besides  i just had
this really interesting idea 
are you stoned

  hollister  what s the sequence 
  ok  the sequence is   
two two four two   
what is this 
there s no useful purpose for a bunch
of chompy things in a hallway 
we shouldn t have to do this 
why is it here  
  cos it s on the tv show 
  well  forget it
