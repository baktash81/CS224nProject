what happened on enok vll
youve gotta admit
they really do love him
almost as much as he loves himself
excuse me commander hey
i was wondering if you could help
settle a dispute my crew and i have
um if you remember
uh in quasar dilemma
excuse me for a minute fellas
what about the relevant conundrum
in episode 15 mist of delos v
i got the feeling that you
and the commander had a thing
did you
no the commander and i
never had a thing
well thats her story
excuse me
gwen
gwen
gwen
commander
excuse me
i must speak to you
it is of supreme importance
we are thermians
and we need your help
oh oh oh
is this about that gig tomorrow
hammer it out with my agent
and make sure theres a limo
last time i did one of these gigs
they shoved me in a toyota
remember mums the word
certainly but um
mum
mum mum muum
and beautiful
crewman madison
the mist of this strange planet
is filling my head
with such thoughts
it was cute when i didnt know you
what a freak show man
oh this is hilarious
bunch of losers beggin
for autographs at 15 bucks a pop
these guys havent had
a real acting job for 20 years
nesmith gets off on those retards
thinking hes a space commander
and his friends cant stand him
did you hear them ragging on him
he has no idea hes a laughing stock
even to his buddies
hes pathetic
come on
the galaxy quest dancers are on
whoo full speed ahead lieutenant
hey commander uh
so in the quasar dilemma
you used the auxiliary deck b
get this
deck b for gamma override
but the online
blueprints indicate
that deck b is independent
of the guidance matrix
so where is the error in that
its just a television show
thats all ok
right but we were wondering
if the quantum flux
there is no quantum flux theres no
auxiliary theres no goddam ship
you got it
i mean it alex ive never seen him
lose it like that not to a fan
i mean it was just weird
gwen i have said it for years
hes mentally unstable
i lm worried
it just was not like him
as long as there is injustice
whenever a targathian baby
cries out
wherever a distress signal
sounds among the stars
well be there
this fine ship this fine crew
never give up
never give up
never surrender
can i help you
sir this is terrible protocol
you shouldnt come here man
i beg you to hear our plea
we are thermians
from the klatu nebula
our people are being slaughtered
by sarris of fatukrey
we have met in negotiation however
our efforts have been disastrous
please commander
you are our last hope
we have secured our limousine
what
oh oh oh oh
um its the thing
for the thing thats um
ha maybe i should get some pants on
come on in
commander
i must say that
standing here in your presence
is the greatest honour we
could ever have hoped to achieve

you know guys i had a late night
with a kreemorian fangor beast
so lm gonna just
shut my eyes for a bit
go on you know im listening
to everything you say ok
following the great nebula burst
our people were one people
but then came the zactor migration
and then the melosian shift
and a dark period of discontent
spread through the land
fighting among treeb sects
and largoths ah the foolishness
and it was in this time
of dissension that sarris
commander commander
hmm
im sorry sir but your presence
is requested on the command deck
mm
sir sarris has moved the deadline
we are approaching his ship now
he wants an answer to his proposal
i got most of it
sarris is the bad guy
yes sir hes a very bad man indeed
he has tortured our scientists
captured our females
for his own demented purposes
yeah do you have pages
or should i just wing this
i am not sure i understand you
welcome to protector two
hi

have appointed a new commander
to handle the negotiations

a cup holder and a couple of advil
approaching sir command to slow
set it on screensaver two

lieutenant historical documents
historical documents from out here
yes our society
had fallen into disarray
our goals and values were scattered
but we have modelled every aspect
of our society from your example
and it has saved us
your courage and teamwork
and friendship through adversity
all you see has been taken
from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents
is this a a spaceship
no this is a starport for the ship
would you guys like to see the ship
oh my god
its real
the generator room
the beryllium sphere of course
the medical quarters are to the left
we went to some trouble duplicating
your cellular regeneration system
jason what have you got us into
wow the floors are so clean
were just negotiating a surrender
no big deal
and the organ fabrication chamber
is coming along nicely
no big deal are you crazy
we have to get out of here

dr lazarus
just like mother used to make
so tell me mathesar
this sarris person were meeting
what does he want
he heard about the device
the omega 13
um what is it what does it do
we dont know
we were hoping
you could enlighten us
oh the omega 13 device
we found that on an alien planet
we dont know what it does either
why not just turn it on and see
it has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy
if we were mistaken the device
would cause a chain reaction
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe
has sarris seen any of the
historical records
no thank god he has not
oh so how does he know
about the omega 13 device
our former commander
was not strong
former commander
i am sorry you deserve to be shown
the tape was smuggled
off of sarris ship
originally one of us tried to lead
ls that all
after three days of this
you still require incentive
i have told you
all i know please let me die
when i grow weary of
the noises you make you shall die
guys hold on you cant leave
give me time to think
he wants to think
theres nothing to think about
im not supposed to be here

im the guy in the episode who dies
to prove its serious
commander
prepare the pods for my crew
sir we cant sarris will detonate
any objects leaving the ship
sarris
yes sir hes here
your presence is required
on the command deck
theres nobody here
my people are talented scientists

have been disastrous
i have raised sarris
on zeta frequency
mathesar
we meet again commander
hello sarris how you doin
better than my lieutenant
he failed to activate
the neutron armour
as quickly as id hoped
on our last encounter
well im real sorry
about what happened before

what about the engines
forward thrust shaft 87 damage
computer what about the engines
why dont we have power
the beryllium sphere
has fractured under stress
its fractured
can it be repaired
computer can it be repaired
damage to sphere irreparable
new source of beryllium needed
we need another one
you broke the bloody ship
eh ah ahem computer is there
a replacement sphere on board
computer is there a replacement
beryllium sphere on board
negative no reserve beryllium
sphere exists on board
no we have no extra
beryllium sphere on board
that is really getting annoying
look i have one job
on this lousy ship
its stupid but im gonna do it ok
sure no problem
a thousand apologies
we have failed you
how have you failed us
we have seen you victorious
in much more desperate situations
the fault must lie with us
with the ship
no it is not your fault
and its not the ships fault
itits my fault wwe screwed
we are not
the people you think we are
i dont understand
didnt you make any tv shows
on your planet any theatre films
the historical documents
of your culture
yes in fact we have begun
to follow your example
no not historical documents
theyre not all historical documents
surely you dont think
that gilligans island is a
those poor people
oh brother
were screwed
is there no one on your planet
who behaves in a way
thats contrary to reality
ahh you are speaking of
deception lies
deception lies
we have only recently
become aware of this concept
in our dealings with sarris
often sarris will say
one thing and do another
promise mercy
but deliver destruction
it is a concept we are learning
at some great cost
but if you are saying you could
have traits in common with sarris
hey commander listen we found
some beryllium on a nearby planet
we might be able to get there
by reconfiguring the solar matrix in
parallel for endothermic propulsion
what do you think
well do that
all right
ththats right again
thats ccome on group hug
come on
dr lazarus i hope
i am not breaching protocol
but i am so very humbled
to stand in your presence
i have studied your missions
extensively
though i am thermian i have
lived my life by your philosophy
by the code of the maktar
oh good thats very nice
by grabthars hammer dr l
dont im not kidding
sorry sir i was only
just dont
yes sir
never give up never surrender
dr lazarus
here is your surface mapper
i have programmed the coordinates
of a beryllium sphere
of sufficient density
good luck sir
thanks
youre doing good tommy

dont look down
commander what id give
to see what youre seeing
what
youre deep in the omega 13
oh it must be spectacular
it doesnt look like much to me
theres just these few walls
and this dumb spinning fan
thats in every single
brandon
what does the omega 13 device do
many believe
that it is a mattercollapser
a bomb capable of destroying
everything in 13 seconds
but myself and others are convinced
that it is a matter rearranger
a 13second time jump to the past
why 13 seconds thats really
not enough time to do anything
time to redeem a single mistake
what
we gotta turn off that valve
their oxygens almost gone
listen ill go in ill create
a distraction ive got this
i might be able
to hold him long enough
thats suicide
im a glorified extra fred
im a dead man anyway
