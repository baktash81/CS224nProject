wounds ooze and flesh crawl 
thank you  thank you 
thank you very much 
hold it  we haven t given out
the prizes yet 
our first award
goes to the vampires   
for most blood drained
in a single evening 
our second and
honorable mention   
goes to the fabulous
dark lagoon leeches 
nice work  bone daddy 
yeah  i guess so 
just like last year   
and the year before that 
and the year before that 
there are few who deny
at what i do i am the best
for my talents
are renowned far and wide
when it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night
i excel without ever even trying
with the slightest little effort
of my ghost like charms
i have seen grown men
give out a shriek
with a wave of my hand
and a well placed moan
i have swept the very bravest
off their feet
yet year after year
it s the same routine
and i grow so weary
of the sound of screams
and i  jack
the pumpkin king
have grown so tired
of the same old thing
oh  somewhere deep
inside of these bones
an emptiness
began to grow
there s something out there
far from my home
a longing that
i ve never known
i m the master of fright
and a demon of light
and i ll scare you
right out of your pants
to a guy in kentucky
i m mr  unlucky
and i m known throughout
england and france
and since i am dead
i can take off my head
to recite shakespearean quotations
no animal nor man
can scream like i can
with the fury
of my recitations
but who here
would ever understand
that the pumpkin king
with the skeleton grin
would tire of his crown
if they only understood
he d give it all up
if he only could
oh  there s an empty
place in my bones
that calls out for
something unknown
the fame and praise
come year after year
does nothing for
these empty tears
jack 
i know how you feel 
sally 
you ve come back 
  i had to 
  for this 
  yes 
  shall we  then 
that s twice this month
you ve slipped deadly nightshade
into my tea and run off 
  three times 
  you re mine  you know 
i made you with my own hands 
you can make other creations 
i m restless  i can t help it 
it s a phase  my dear  it ll pass 
we need to be patient  that s all 
but i don t want to be patient 
no  zero  not now 
i m not in the mood 
all right 
here you go  boy 
mornin   gents 
jack  you home 
jack  i ve got the plans
for next halloween 
i need to go over them with you
so we can get started 
jack  please  i m only
an elected official here 
i can t make decisions by myself 
jack  answer me 
  huh 
  he s not home 
  where is he 
  he hasn t been home all night 
where are we 
it s someplace new 
what is this 
whoa oa oa 
whoa 
what s this  what s this
there s color everywhere
what s this
there s white things in the air
what s this  i can t believe my eyes
i must be dreaming
wake up  jack  this isn t fair
what s this
what s this  what s this
there s something very wrong
what s this  there s people
singing songs  what s this
the streets are lined
with little creatures laughing
everybody seems so happy
have i possibly gone daffy
what is this
what s this
there s children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
they re busy building toys
and absolutely no one s dead
there s frost in every window
oh  i can t believe my eyes
and in my bones
i feel the warmth
that s coming from inside
oh  look  what s this
they re hanging mistletoe
they kiss  why that looks
so unique  inspired
they re gathering around
to hear a story
roasting chestnuts on a fire
what s this
what s this in here
they ve got a little tree  how queer
and who would ever think
and why
they re covering it
with tiny little things
they ve got electric lights on strings
and there s a smile on everyone
so now correct me if i m wrong
this looks like fun  this looks like fun
oh  could it be i got my wish
what s this
oh my  what now
the children are asleep
but look
there s nothing underneath
no ghouls  no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them
only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland
what s this
the monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can t be found
and in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around
instead of screams  i swear
i can hear music in the air
the smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere
the sights  the sounds
they re everywhere and all around
i ve never felt so good before
this empty place
inside of me is filling up
i simply cannot get enough
i want it  oh  i want it
oh  i want it for my own
i ve got to know  i ve got to know
what is this place that i have found
what is this
christmas town 
hmm 
ho ho ho ho 
ho ho ho ho 
hmm 
  this has never happened before 
  it s suspicious 
  it s peculiar 
  it s scary 
stand aside  coming through 
we ve got to find jack 
there s only 365 days left
till next halloween 
three sixty four 
is there anywhere
we ve forgotten to check 
i looked in every mausoleum 
we opened the sarcophagi 
i tromped through
the pumpkin patch 
i peeked behind
the cyclops  eye 
i did  but he wasn t there 
it s time to sound the alarms 
frog s breath
will overpower any odor 
bitter 
worm s wart  but where 
where is that worm s wart 
sally  is that soup ready yet 
ah  coming 
lunch 
ah  what s that 
worm s wart  mmm 
and frog s breath 
wh what s wrong  l i thought
you liked frog s breath 
nothing s more suspicious
than frog s breath 
until you taste it 
i won t swallow a spoonful 
i m not hungry  oops 
you want me to starve   
an old man like me 
who hardly has strength as it is 
me  to whom you owe
your very life 
oh  don t be silly 
mmm  see  scrumptious 
did anyone think
to dredge the lake 
oh  this morning 
  hear that 
  ah  what 
  shh 
zero 
  jack s back 
  jack s back  jack s back 
  where have you been 
  call a town meeting and i ll
tell everyone all about it 
  when 
  immediately 
town meeting  town meeting 
town meeting tonight 
town meeting 
town meeting tonight 
listen  everyone 
i want to tell you
about christmas town 
there were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed
all around things
to tantalize my brain
it s a world unlike anything
i ve ever seen
and as hard as i tried
i can t seem to describe
like a most improbable dream
but you must believe
when i tell you this
it s as real as my skull
and it does exist
here  let me show you 
ooh 
this is a thing
called a present
the whole thing
starts with a box
  a box
  is it steel
  are there locks
  is it filled with a pox
  a pox  how delightful  a pox
if you please 
just a box with
bright colored paper
and the whole thing s
topped with a bow
  a bow
  but why
  how ugly
  what s in it  what s in it
that s the point of the thing
not to know
  it s a bat
  will it bend
  it s a rat
  will it break
perhaps it s the head
that i found in the lake
listen now
you don t understand
that s not the point
of christmasland
now pay attention
we pick up an oversized sock
and hang it like this
on the wall
oh  yes  does it still
have a foot
  let me see  let me look
  is it rotted and covered with gook
um  let me explain 
there s no foot inside
but there s candy
  or sometimes it s filled
with small toys
  small toys
  do they bite
  do they snap
  or explode in the sack
well  perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys
what a splendid idea
this christmas sounds fun
i fully endorse it
let s try it at once
everyone  please
now not so fast
there s something here
that you don t quite grasp
i don t know 
do you get it 
well  i may as well
give them what they want 
and the best i must confess
i have saved for the last
for the ruler
of this christmasland
is a fearsome king
with a deep  mighty voice
least  that s what
i ve come to understand
and i ve also heard it told
that he s something to behold
like a lobster huge and red
when he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on
carting bulging sacks
with his big great arms
that is so i ve heard it said
and on a dark cold night
under full moonlight
he flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky
and they call him
sandy claws
well  at least they re excited
but they don t understand
that special kind of feeling
in christmasland
oh  well 
hmm 
hmm 
there s got to be a logical way
to explain this christmas thing 
you ve poisoned me for the
last time  you wretched girl 
oh  my head 
the door is open 
  hello 
  jack skellington 
  up here  my boy 
  doctor  i need to borrow some
equipment 
is that so  whatever for 
i m conducting a series
of experiments 
how perfectly marvelous 
  curiosity killed the cat  you know 
  i know 
come on into the lab
and we ll get you all fixed up 
hmm  experiments 
zero  i m home 
interesting reaction 
but what does it mean 
you can come out now
if you promise to behave 
sally 
sally 
oh  gone again 
hmm 
oh 
something s up with jack
something s up with jack
don t know if we re ever
going to get him back
he s all alone up there
locked away inside
  never says a word
  hope he hasn t died
something s up with jack
something s up with jack
christmastime
is buzzing in my skull
will it let me be
i cannot tell
there s so many things
i cannot grasp
when i think i ve got it
and then at last
through my bony fingers
it does slip
like a snowflake
in a fiery grip
something here i m not quite getting
though i try i keep forgetting
like a memory
long since past
here in an instant
gone in a flash
what does it mean
what does it mean
in these little bric a brac
a secret s waiting to be cracked
these dolls and toys confuse me so
confound it all  i love it though
simple objects  nothing more
but something s hidden through a door
though i do not have the key
something s here i cannot see
what does it mean
what does it mean
what does it mean
hmm  hmm 
i ve read these christmas books
so many times
i know the stories
and i know the rhymes
i know the christmas carols
all by heart
my skull s so full
it s tearing me apart
as often as i ve read them
something s wrong
it s so hard to put
my bony finger on
or perhaps it s really not as deep
as i ve been led to think
am i trying much too hard
of course
i ve been too close to see
the answer s right in front of me
right in front of me
it s simple really  very clear
like music drifting in the air
invisible but everywhere
just because i cannot see it
doesn t mean i can t believe it
you know i think this christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems
and why should they have all the fun
it should belong to anyone
not anyone in fact  but me
why i can make a christmas tree
and there s no reason i can find
i couldn t handle christmastime
i bet i could improve it too
and that s exactly what i ll do
eureka 
this year 
christmas will be ours 
patience  everyone  jack has
a special job for each of you 
dr  beetlestein 
your christmas assignment
is ready 
dr  beetlestein 
to the front of the line 
what kind of noise is that
for a baby to make 
  perhaps it can be improved 
  no problem 
i knew it 
doctor  thank you for coming 
we need some of these 
hmm 
their construction should be
exceedingly simple  i think 
how horrible
our christmas will be 
no  how jolly 
oh  how jolly
our christmas will be 
  what are you doing here 
  jack sent for us 
  specifically 
  by name 
  lock 
  shock 
  barrel 
jack  jack 
it s boogie s boys 
ah  halloween s finest
trick or treaters 
the job i have for you
is top secret 
it requires craft 
cunning  mischief 
and we thought
you didn t like us  jack 
absolutely no one
is to know about it  not a soul 
now 
tree 
christmas town 
ow  hmm 
and one more thing 
leave that no account
oogie boogie out of this 
whatever you say  jack 
  of course  jack 
  wouldn t dream of it  jack 
kidnap mr  sandy claws
  i wanna do it
  let s draw straws
  jack said we should work together
  three of a kind
  birds of a feather
  now and forever
la  la  la  la  la  la
la  la  la  la  la
la  la  la  la  la  la
la  la  la  la  la
kidnap the sandy claws
lock him up real tight
throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights
first we re going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait
when he comes a sniffing
we will snap the trap and close the gate
wait  i ve got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man
let s pop him in a boiling pot
and when he s done we ll butter him up
kidnap the sandy claws
throw him in a box
bury him for 90 years
then see if he talks
and mr  oogie boogie man
can take the whole thing
over then
he ll be so pleased i do declare
that he will cook him rare
whee
i say that we take a cannon
aim it at his door and then
knock three times and when he answers
sandy claws will be no more
you re so stupid
think now if we blow him up
to smithereens
we may lose some pieces and then
jack will beat us black and green
kidnap the sandy claws
tie him in a bag
throw him in the ocean
then see if he is sad
because mr  oogie boogie
is the meanest guy around
  if i were on his boogie list
  i d get out of town
he ll be so pleased
by our success
that he ll reward us too
i ll bet
perhaps he ll make
his special brew
of snake and spider stew
we re his little henchmen
and we take ourjob with pride
we do our best to please him
and stay on his good side
  i wish my cohorts weren t so dumb
  i m not the dumb one
  you re no fun
  shut up
  make me
i ve got something  listen now
this one is real good you ll see
we ll send a present to his door
upon there ll be a note to read
now in the box we ll wait
and hide until his curiosity
entices him to look inside and then
we ll have him one  two  three
kidnap the sandy claws
beat him with a stick
lock him up for 90 years
see what makes him tick
kidnap the sandy claws
chop him into bits
mr  oogie boogie
is sure to get his kicks
kidnap the sandy claws
see what we will see
lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key
sandy claws  huh 
it goes something like this 
how about it

a one  and a two 
and a three  and a   
  next 
  fantastic

and we ll be in great shape

my christmas is filled
with laughter and joy 
and this  my sandy claws outfit 
i want you to make it 
jack  please listen to me 
it s going to be a disaster 
how could it be 
just follow the pattern 
this part s red

  now  don t be modest 
who else is clever enough
to make my sandy claws outfit 
  next

tragedy s at hand
and though i d like
to stand by him
can t shake this feeling
that i have
the worst
is just around the bend
and does he notice
my feelings for him
and will he see
how much he means to me
i think it s not to be
what will become
of my dear friend
where will his actions
lead us then
although i d like
to join the crowd
in their enthusiastic cloud
try as i may it doesn t last
and will we ever
end up together
