in a single evening
our second and
honorable mention
goes to the fabulous
dark lagoon leeches
nice work bone daddy
yeah i guess so
just like last year
and the year before that
and the year before that
there are few who deny
at what i do i am the best
for my talents
are renowned far and wide
when it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night
i excel without ever even trying
with the slightest little effort
of my ghostlike charms
i have seen grown men
give out a shriek
with a wave of my hand
and a wellplaced moan
i have swept the very bravest
off their feet
yet year after year
its the same routine
and i grow so weary
of the sound of screams
and i jack
the pumpkin king
have grown so tired
of the same old thing
oh somewhere deep
inside of these bones
an emptiness
began to grow
theres something out there
far from my home
a longing that
ive never known
im the master of fright
and a demon of light
and ill scare you
right out of your pants
to a guy in kentucky
im mr unlucky
and im known throughout
england and france
and since i am dead
i can take off my head
to recite shakespearean quotations
no animal nor man
can scream like i can
with the fury
of my recitations
but who here
would ever understand
that the pumpkin king
with the skeleton grin
would tire of his crown
if they only understood
hed give it all up
if he only could
oh theres an empty
place in my bones
that calls out for
something unknown
the fame and praise
come year after year
does nothing for
these empty tears
jack
i know how you feel
sally
youve come back
i had to
for this
yes
shall we then
thats twice this month
youve slipped deadly nightshade
into my tea and run off
three times
youre mine you know
i made you with my own hands
you can make other creations
im restless i cant help it
its a phase my dear itll pass
we need to be patient thats all
but i dont want to be patient
no zero not now
im not in the mood
all right
here you go boy
mornin gents
jack you home
jack ive got the plans
for next halloween
i need to go over them with you
so we can get started
jack please im only
an elected official here
i cant make decisions by myself
jack answer me
huh
hes not home
where is he
he hasnt been home all night
where are we
its someplace new
what is this
whoaoaoa
whoa
whats this whats this
theres color everywhere
whats this
theres white things in the air
whats this i cant believe my eyes
i must be dreaming
wake up jack this isnt fair
whats this
whats this whats this
theres something very wrong
whats this theres people
singing songs whats this
the streets are lined
with little creatures laughing
everybody seems so happy
have i possibly gone daffy
what is this
whats this
theres children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
theyre busy building toys
and absolutely no ones dead
theres frost in every window
oh i cant believe my eyes
and in my bones
i feel the warmth
thats coming from inside
oh look whats this
theyre hanging mistletoe
they kiss why that looks
so unique inspired
theyre gathering around
to hear a story
roasting chestnuts on a fire
whats this
whats this in here
theyve got a little tree how queer
and who would ever think
and why
theyre covering it
with tiny little things
theyve got electric lights on strings
and theres a smile on everyone
so now correct me if im wrong
this looks like fun this looks like fun
oh could it be i got my wish
whats this
oh my what now
the children are asleep
but look
theres nothing underneath
no ghouls no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them
only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland
whats this
the monsters are all missing
and the nightmares cant be found
and in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around
instead of screams i swear
i can hear music in the air
the smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere
the sights the sounds
theyre everywhere and all around
ive never felt so good before
this empty place
inside of me is filling up
i simply cannot get enough
i want it oh i want it
oh i want it for my own
ive got to know ive got to know
what is this place that i have found
what is this
christmas town
hmm
hohohoho
hohohoho
hmm
this has never happened before
its suspicious
its peculiar
its scary
stand aside coming through
weve got to find jack
theres only 365 days left
till next halloween
three sixtyfour
is there anywhere
weve forgotten to check
i looked in every mausoleum
we opened the sarcophagi
i tromped through
the pumpkin patch
i peeked behind
the cyclops eye
i did but he wasnt there
its time to sound the alarms
frogs breath
will overpower any odor
bitter
worms wart but where
where is that worms wart
sally is that soup ready yet
ah coming
lunch
ah whats that
worms wart mmm
and frogs breath
whwhats wrong li thought
you liked frogs breath
nothings more suspicious
than frogs breath
until you taste it
i wont swallow a spoonful
im not hungry oops
you want me to starve
an old man like me
who hardly has strength as it is
me to whom you owe
your very life
oh dont be silly
mmm see scrumptious
did anyone think
to dredge the lake
oh this morning
hear that
ah what
shh
zero
jacks back
jacks back jacks back
where have you been
call a town meeting and ill
tell everyone all about it
when
immediately
town meeting town meeting
town meeting tonight
town meeting
town meeting tonight
listen everyone
i want to tell you
about christmas town
there were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed
all around things
to tantalize my brain
its a world unlike anything
ive ever seen
and as hard as i tried
i cant seem to describe
like a most improbable dream
but you must believe
when i tell you this
its as real as my skull
and it does exist
here let me show you
ooh
this is a thing
called a present
the whole thing
starts with a box
a box
is it steel
are there locks
is it filled with a pox
a pox how delightful a pox
if you please
just a box with
bright colored paper
and the whole things
topped with a bow
a bow
but why
how ugly
whats in it whats in it
thats the point of the thing
not to know
its a bat
will it bend
its a rat
will it break
perhaps its the head
that i found in the lake
listen now
you dont understand
thats not the point
of christmasland
now pay attention
we pick up an oversized sock
and hang it like this
on the wall
oh yes does it still
have a foot
let me see let me look
is it rotted and covered with gook
um let me explain
theres no foot inside
but theres candy
or sometimes its filled
with small toys
small toys
do they bite
do they snap
or explode in the sack
well perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys
what a splendid idea
this christmas sounds fun
i fully endorse it
lets try it at once
everyone please
now not so fast
theres something here
that you dont quite grasp
i dont know
do you get it
well i may as well
give them what they want
and the best i must confess
i have saved for the last
for the ruler
of this christmasland
is a fearsome king
with a deep mighty voice
least thats what
ive come to understand
and ive also heard it told
that hes something to behold
like a lobster huge and red
when he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on
carting bulging sacks
with his big great arms
that is so ive heard it said
and on a dark cold night
under full moonlight
he flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky
and they call him
sandy claws
well at least theyre excited
but they dont understand
that special kind of feeling
in christmasland
oh well
hmm
hmm
theres got to be a logical way
to explain this christmas thing
youve poisoned me for the
last time you wretched girl
oh my head
the door is open
hello
jack skellington
up here my boy
doctor i need to borrow some
equipment
is that so whatever for
im conducting a series
of experiments
how perfectly marvelous
curiosity killed the cat you know
i know
come on into the lab
and well get you all fixed up
hmm experiments
zero im home
interesting reaction
but what does it mean
you can come out now
if you promise to behave
sally
sally
oh gone again
hmm
oh
somethings up with jack
somethings up with jack
dont know if were ever
going to get him back
hes all alone up there
locked away inside
never says a word
hope he hasnt died
somethings up with jack
somethings up with jack
christmastime
is buzzing in my skull
will it let me be
i cannot tell
theres so many things
i cannot grasp
when i think ive got it
and then at last
through my bony fingers
it does slip
like a snowflake
in a fiery grip
something here im not quite getting
though i try i keep forgetting
like a memory
long since past
here in an instant
gone in a flash
what does it mean
what does it mean
in these little bricabrac
a secrets waiting to be cracked
these dolls and toys confuse me so
confound it all i love it though
simple objects nothing more
but somethings hidden through a door
though i do not have the key
somethings here i cannot see
what does it mean
what does it mean
what does it mean
hmm hmm
ive read these christmas books
so many times
i know the stories
and i know the rhymes
i know the christmas carols
all by heart
my skulls so full
its tearing me apart
as often as ive read them
somethings wrong
its so hard to put
my bony finger on
or perhaps its really not as deep
as ive been led to think
am i trying much too hard
of course
ive been too close to see
the answers right in front of me
right in front of me
its simple really very clear
like music drifting in the air
invisible but everywhere
just because i cannot see it
doesnt mean i cant believe it
you know i think this christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems
and why should they have all the fun
it should belong to anyone
not anyone in fact but me
why i can make a christmas tree
and theres no reason i can find
i couldnt handle christmastime
i bet i could improve it too
and thats exactly what ill do
eureka
this year
christmas will be ours
patience everyone jack has
a special job for each of you
dr beetlestein
your christmas assignment
is ready
dr beetlestein
to the front of the line
what kind of noise is that
for a baby to make
perhaps it can be improved
no problem
i knew it
doctor thank you for coming
we need some of these
hmm
their construction should be
exceedingly simple i think
how horrible
our christmas will be
no how jolly
oh how jolly
our christmas will be
what are you doing here
jack sent for us
specifically
by name
lock
shock
barrel
jack jack
its boogies boys
ah halloweens finest
trickortreaters
the job i have for you
is top secret
it requires craft
cunning mischief
and we thought
you didnt like us jack
absolutely no one
is to know about it not a soul
now
tree
christmas town
ow hmm
and one more thing
leave that noaccount
oogie boogie out of this
whatever you say jack
of course jack
wouldnt dream of it jack
kidnap mr sandy claws
i wanna do it
lets draw straws
jack said we should work together
three of a kind
birds of a feather
now and forever
la la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la
kidnap the sandy claws
lock him up real tight
throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights
first were going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait
when he comes asniffing
we will snap the trap and close the gate
wait ive got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man
lets pop him in a boiling pot
and when hes done well butter him up
kidnap the sandy claws
throw him in a box
bury him for 90 years
then see if he talks
and mr oogie boogie man
can take the whole thing
over then
hell be so pleased i do declare
that he will cook him rare
whee
i say that we take a cannon
aim it at his door and then
knock three times and when he answers
sandy claws will be no more
youre so stupid
think now if we blow him up
to smithereens
we may lose some pieces and then
jack will beat us black and green
kidnap the sandy claws
tie him in a bag
throw him in the ocean
then see if he is sad
because mr oogie boogie
is the meanest guy around
if i were on his boogie list
id get out of town
hell be so pleased
by our success
that hell reward us too
ill bet
perhaps hell make
his special brew
of snake and spider stew
were his little henchmen
and we take ourjob with pride
we do our best to please him
and stay on his good side
i wish my cohorts werent so dumb
im not the dumb one
youre no fun
shut up
make me
ive got something listen now
this one is real good youll see
well send a present to his door
upon therell be a note to read
now in the box well wait
and hide until his curiosity
entices him to look inside and then
well have him one two three
kidnap the sandy claws
beat him with a stick
lock him up for 90 years
see what makes him tick
kidnap the sandy claws
chop him into bits
mr oogie boogie
is sure to get his kicks
kidnap the sandy claws
see what we will see
lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key
