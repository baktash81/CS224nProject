borg sounds swedish
big ship decks metres long
took six months find enough titanium build cockpit
much thing cost
economics future somewhat different
money doesnt exist th century
money mean dont get paid

tough luck huh
ive got get bridge
doctor yeah
would take look yeah
ive constructed intermix chamber remember school

basic warp design required reading youre first chapter
well looks like got right
using replace damaged plasma conduit
yes need reinforce tubing nanopolymer
dr cochrane know sounds silly shake hand
honour work
never imagined ld meet man invented warp drive
im sorry thanks
keep little hero worship
cant say blame grew hearing
youre aboutto shouldnt say

believing oneself perfect often sign delusional mind
small trying attack doesnt understand
real interest
goal obtain codes computer
one goals one many
reach lm willing help reach
becoming clear yet
look standing cradling new flesh lve given
means nothing protect
simply imitating behaviour humans
youre becoming human time youre learning lie
programming designed process sensations
tear away skin would defective circuit
go ahead data wont stop
dont tempted flesh
familiar physical forms pleasure
referring sexuality
fully functional
programmed multiple techniques
long since youve used
years months days minutes
far long
bring reinforcements theres time
theyre building top particle emitter soon activated
phasers full power dish charged antiprotons

filled naked women
thats zefram cochrane thats vision
historical figure keep talking
never met cant imagine ever
someone said dont try great man man
let history judge rhetorical nonsense
said ten years
youve got minutes doc get checklist
theyre move theyve taken decks
theyve adapted weapons well modify
