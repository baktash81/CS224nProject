authorisation picard 47at
did i catch you at a bad time
no admiral of course not
ive just heard that our colony on
ivor prime has been destroyed
longrange sensors
yes i know the borg
captains log stardate 508935
the moment have dreaded for
nearly six years has finally arrived
the borg our lethal enemy have
begun an invasion of the federation
this time
there maybe no stopping them
how many ships
one on a direct course for earth
theyll be in federation space soon
admiral hayes is mobilising a fleet
it will take us three hours
were not going
what do you mean
were to patrol the neutral zone
in case the romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation
there has been no unusual activity
along the romulan border
does starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time
were ready the enterprise e is
the most advanced ship in the fleet
i have gone over all this
with starfleet their orders stand
number one
set a course for the neutral zone
bizet
berlioz what do you have
weve finished
our first sweep of the neutral zone
fascinating
20 particles of dust per cubic metre
52 ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a classtwo comet
this is certainly
worthy of our attention
captain why are we out here
starfleet has every confidence
in the enterprise and her crew
theyre just not sure
about her captain
a man once captured
and assimilated by the borg
should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again
it would introduce an unstable element
to a critical situation
your experience makes you
the perfect man to lead this fight
bridge to captain picard
weve received word from the fleet
theyve engaged the borg
mr data put starfleet frequency 1486
on audio
flagship endeavour
stand by to engage
defiant and bozeman
fallback to mobile position one
we have it in visual range
a borg cube on course 0215
we are the borg lower your shields
and surrender your ships
we will add your biological
distinctiveness to our own
your culture will adapt to serve us
resistance is futile
all units open fire
theyve broken through
the defence perimeter
continue to attack
we need reinforcements
96 dead and 22 wounded
on the lexington
lt hawk set a course for earth
maximum warp
i am about to disobey our orders
any of you who wish to object
should do so now
i believe i speak for everyone here
when i say
to hell with our orders
red alert all hands to battle stations
engage
report
power offline our weapons are gone
perhaps today is a good day to die
prepare for ramming speed
sir theres another ship coming in
its the enterprise
the defiant is losing life support
beam the survivors aboard
theyve destroyed the admirals ship
what is the status of the borg cube
the outer hull has been damaged
i am reading fluctuations
in their power grid
number one
open a channel to the fleet
this is capt picard
im taking command of the fleet
plot in the following coordinates
fire on my command
is that a vital system
trust me data
the fleet has responded sir
theyre standing by
fire
mr hawk pursuit course engage
aye sir
what
i can hear them
i have a patient here
who insists on coming to the bridge
welcome aboard mr worf
thank you sir
the defiant
adrift but salvageable
tough little ship
little
mr worf we could use some help
at tactical
you do remember
how to fire phasers
were detecting
chronometric particles
theyre creating a temporal vortex
time travel
data report
were caught in a temporal wake
captain  earth
there are high concentrations
of methane and carbon monoxide
life signs
approximately nine billion
all borg
how
they did it in the past they went back
and assimilated earth changed history
why are we still here
the temporal wake protected us
from changes in the time line
the vortex is collapsing
hold your course
we must follow them back
and repair the damage theyve done
come on
good night eddie
go home
youll regret this tomorrow
you should have learned by now
that i dont have regrets
one more round lily
z youve had enough
im not flying with a drunken pilot
i cant fly sober
what is that
that is the constellation leo
no that
its the econ
after all these years
weve got to get to the phoenix
to hell with the phoenix
shields are down
main power is holding
we are in the mid 21st century
i would estimate we have arrived
ten years after the third world war
that makes sense most of the
major cities have been destroyed
600 million dead no resistance
captain
mr worf quantum torpedoes
fire
they were firing at the surface
location
western hemisphere
north american continent
a missile complex in montana
a missile complex
data i need to know the exact date
april 4th 2063
april 4th
the day before first contact
the missile complex must be
where cochrane is building his ship
they came to stop first contact
how much damage lieutenant
i cant tell
well have to go down there
and find out what happened
have a security team ready
computer 21st century clothing
number one you have the bridge
over here
theyre all dead
see if one of them is cochrane
data lets go check the warp ship
the structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact
the fuselage is slightly damaged
we have the blueprints
we need a team down here
hold your fire were here to help
bullshit
captain i believe i can handle this
greetings
this woman
requires medical attention
severe radiation poisoning
from the damaged ship
i have to get her to sick bay
no lectures on the prime directive
lll keep her unconscious
tell riker to beam down with
a search party to find cochrane
crusher to enterprise
two to beam directly to sick bay
in 48 hours
this ship has to be launched
geordi the ship was damaged in the
attack get a repair crew down here
im on my way alpha team
were heading down to the surface
porter take command while lm gone
check out the environmental controls
its a little warm in here
isnt it amazing
this ship
used to be a nuclear missile
an historical irony using an
instrument of mass destruction
to inaugurate an era of peace
a boyhood fantasy ive seen
this ship in the smithsonian
but i was never able to touch it
does tactile contact
alter your perception of the phoenix
for humans touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way
it makes it seem more real
im detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing
temperature variations
in the fuel manifold
it is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago
would you three like to be alone
what have you found out
theres no sign of cochrane
he has to be here
this ship and this flight
were his dream
we should consider the possibility
that dr cochrane died in the attack
if thats true
then the future may die with him
what do you think
the entire system has gone crazy
its affecting the entire deck
ill check the eps conduits
hello hey
are you talking to me
is anyone else working up here
not that i know of
paul
paul are you okay in there
captain what is it
picard to enterprise mr worf
is everything all right up there
we are experiencing some
environmental diffiiculties
humidityhas risen 73
and the temperature is up 10 degrees
mr data and i will be right there
number one take charge down here
the damage to her cell membranes
is repaired she should be fine
find out why its so hot in here
now what
crusher to engineering
crusher to bridge
exactly whats been happening
weve lost contact with deck 16
i was about to send
a security team to investigate
no seal off deck 16 post
security teams at every access point
what environmental conditions
were last reported in engineering
92 humidity
391 degrees celsius
391 degrees celsius
iike a borg ship
they knew their ship was doomed
our shields were down
somehow they transported over here
without being detected
theyll assimilate the enterprise
and then earth
picard to riker
enterprise to away team
respond
main control is being rerouted
through engineering
data lock out the main computer
i have isolated the main computer
with an encryption code
the borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16
the borg wont stay on deck 16
youre all right come on wake up
you are all right listen to me
youre going to be fine
i need you to do as i say
is the emh programme online
it should be
activate the emh programme
what is the nature of the emergency
20 borg are about to break in here
create a diversion
this isnt part of my programme
im a doctor
do a dance tell a story
just give us a few seconds
according to medical research borg
implants can cause skin irritations
perhaps youd like
an analgesic cream
which way
we need to get off this deck
follow me
engineering will be the central point
from which they control the hive
if we begin firing in there
we may hit the warp core
our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks
plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact
the borg cannot survive
without their organic components
all weapons will be set
on a rotating modulation
the borg will adapt quickly
well be able to fire 12 shots at most
you may encounter crew members
who have already been assimilated
dont hesitate to fire believe me
youll be doing them a favour lets go
deanna
deanna
will dont turn off that
who is this jerk and who told him
he could turn off my music
will riker zefram cochrane
is he a friend of yours
yes
husband
no
good
this deena
deanna
this  is the good stuff
dr cochrane
to the phoenix
may she rest in peace
okay that wasnt so good
we have to tell him the truth
then the time line
this is no time to argue about time
we dont have the time
what was i saying
youre drunk
he wouldnt even talk to me
unless i had a drink with him
it took three shots of tequila
just to find out his name
ive spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me
so dont go criticising
my counselling techniques
its a primitive culture
im just trying to blend in
he didnt believe our cover story
were running out of time
will he be able to handle the truth
if youre looking for my
professional opinion  hes nuts
ill be sure to note that in my log
captain i believe lm feeling
anxiety
it is an intriguing sensation
data perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now
good idea sir  done
data there are times that i envy you
its only me we have wounded here
get these people back to deck 14
there was a civilian with us
well watch for her
please try to find her
lower your weapons theyll ignore
us till the consider us a threat
the manual release
mr worf hold this position
manualrelease online
perhaps we should just knock
data
ready phasers
data cover me
captain they have adapted
regroup on deck 15
dont let them touch you
captain
data
here
help
please help
you how the hell
back off
who are you
what faction are you with
im not with the eastern coalition
just get me the hell out of here
now
that isnt going to be easy
youd better find a way
or lm going to start pushing buttons
follow me
slow
you wont be able to break
the encryption codes
nor will you
be able to assimilate me
brave words
ive heard them before
from thousands ofspecies
across thousands ofworlds
butnow they are aliborg
i am unlike any life form
you have encountered before
you are an imperfectbeing
created by an imperfectbeing
findingyour weakness
is only a matter oftime
let me make sure i understand you
correctly commander
a group of cybernetic creatures
from the future
have travelled back through time
to enslave the human race
and youre here to stop them
hot damn youre heroic
were going to prove it to you
there she is beautiful
all right take a look
well well well
what have we got here
i love a good peep show
thats a trick
how did you do that
its your telescope
thats our ship the enterprise
and lily is up there
can i talk to her
weve lost contact with the ship
we dont know why yet
so what is it you want me to do
conduct your flight as planned
why tomorrow morning
at 1 1 oclock an alien ship
will be passing this solar system
alien you mean extraterrestrials
more bad guys
good guys
they have no interest in earth
too primitive
when they discover that humans have
learned how to fly faster than light
they alter their course and make
first contact with earth right here
here
actually over there
its a pivotal moment in human history
you make contact with an alien race
after you do
everything begins to change
fleets of starships are built
and mankind explores the galaxy
it unites humanity when they realise
theyre not alone in the universe
poverty disease and war
will all be gone in 50 years
but unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow none of it will happen
you people are all astronauts
on some kind of star trek
i know this is a lot to take in
but were running out of time
we need your help
what do you say
why not
it looks pretty bad sir
they control decks 26 up to 1 1
when they took deck 1 1
they stopped
theyve assimilated half the ship
why stop there
what is on deck 1 1
hydroponics deflector control
they stopped there because
it gave them a tactical advantage
return to your checkpoints
what happened in sick bay
wheres dr crusher
why did you break the ceasefire
we didnt attack you
theres a new faction that
wants to prevent tomorrows launch
were here to help you
you are not in montana anymore
you are on a spaceship
orbiting the earth
get me out of here
all right
you want a way out here it is
what is this
australia new guinea
the solomons
montana will be up soon
but its a long way down
im not your enemy
and i can get you home
put the weapon down and trust me
jeanluc picard
thats my name whats yours
lily
welcome aboard lily
thank you
maximum setting if youd fired this
youd have vaporised me
its my first ray gun
theres no glass
forcefield
ive never seen such technology
it hasnt been invented yet
theres more i have to tell you
come on
are you ready
who are you
i am the borg
that is a contradiction the borg
have a collective consciousness
there are no individuals
i am the beginning the end
the one who is many
i am the borg
greetings
i am curious
do you control the borg collective
you imply disparity where
none exists i am the collective
ill rephrase the question
i wish to understand their hierarchy
are you their leader
i bring order to chaos
a cryptic response
you are in chaos data
you are a machine
who wishes to be human
i am programmed
to evolve and to better myself
we too are on a quest
to better ourselves
evolving toward a state of perfection
forgive me but the borg
do not evolve they conquer
by assimilating other beings we are
bringing them closer to perfection
somehow i question your motives
that is because you havent
been properly  stimulated yet
you have reactivated
my emotion chip why
dont be frightened
i am not frightened
do you know what this is
it would appear to be organic skin
what a cold description
for such a beautiful gift
was that good for you
how big is this federation
over 150 planets
they span 8000 light years
you mustnt get home much
i tend to think of this ship as home
i get back to earth whenever i can
they havent broken the code yet
who the zombies
the borg
it sounds swedish
how big is this ship
24 decks 700 metres long
it took me six months to find enough
titanium just to build a cockpit
how much did this thing cost
the economics of the future
are somewhat different
money doesnt exist
in the 24th century
no money
you mean you dont get paid
the acquisition of wealth is no
longer the driving force in our lives
we work to better ourselves
and the rest of humanity
actually were rather like
yourself and dr cochrane
all right
come on
is there another way around
i know what lm doing
definitely not swedish
what the hell are you doing
perhaps something in satin
im sorry but were closing
and we have a strict dress code
if you boys dont leave
im looking for nicky the nose
he hasnt been here in months
this is the wrong chapter
computer begin chapter 13
try and look
as if youre having a good time
no look at me
try to act naturally
there he is
ruby this is not a good time
its never the time for us dix
is that a case youre working on
ill see you later
okay but watch your caboose
and dump the broad
look what the cat dragged in
whats shakin dix
the usual martinis and skirts
excuse me
im going to take that personal
no offence
hey
i think you got him
i dont get it i thought
you said this was a hologram
i disengaged the safety protocols
so even a holographic bullet can kill
what are you doing
looking for the neural processor
its like a memory chip
it will contain a record of all the
instructions this borg has received
its one of your uniforms
yes this was ensign lynch
tough luck huh
ive got to get to the bridge
doctor
yeah
would you take a look at this
yeah
ive constructed the intermix chamber
from what i remember in school
you learned about this in school
yeah
basic warp design is required
reading youre the first chapter
well it looks like you got it right
this is what were using to replace
the damaged plasma conduit
yes but you need to reinforce
the tubing with a nanopolymer
dr cochrane i know this sounds
silly but can i shake your hand
its such an honour to work with you
i never imagined ld meet
the man who invented warp drive
im sorry  thanks
do they have to keep doing that
its just a little hero worship
i cant say i blame them
we all grew up hearing about you
or what youre aboutto do
i shouldnt say this
but i went
to zefram cochrane high school
really
i wish i had a picture of this
what
in the future this whole area
becomes an historical monument
youre standing on the exact spot
where your statue is going to be
statue
its marble about 20 metres tall
youre looking up at the sky
your hand
is reaching toward the future
ive got to take a leak
leak im not detecting any leak
dont you people
from the 24th century ever pee
oh leak i get it
thats pretty funny
excuse me
commander
reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated
i found something you lost
i am a klingon
mr worf report
the borg control over half the ship
theres no power to the bridge
ive accessed
a borg neural processor
theyre transforming the deflector
dish into an interplexing beacon
to establish a link with the borg
living in the 21st century
but the borg
are still in the delta quadrant
theyll send reinforcements
humanity will be an easy target
we must destroy the deflector dish
we cant get to deflector control
or a shuttle craft
mr worf do you remember
your zerog combat training
i remember it made me
sick to my stomach
what are you suggesting
its time we took a little stroll
theres a humanoid lifesign
up ahead
51 1 metres
cochrane
its him all right
ive remodulated the weapons
but the borg will be quick to adapt
we must make every shot count
magnetise
watch your caboose dix
i intend to
how are you doing worf
not well sir
try not to look at the stars
keep your eyes on the hull
lets go
tell me are you using
a polymerbased neurorely
to transmit organic nerve impulses
to my positronic net
if so how have you solved
the problem of signal degradation
do you always talk this much
not always but often
why do you insist
on using this primitive language
your android brain
is capable of much more
i am trying to become more human
we used to be just like them
flawed weak organic
we evolved to include the synthetic
we use both to attain perfection
your goal
should be the same as ours
believing oneself to be perfect is
often the sign of a delusional mind
a small being trying to attack
what he doesnt understand
you have no real interest in me
your goal is to obtain
the codes for the computer
that is one of our goals
one of many
and to reach it
lm willing to help you reach yours
is it becoming clear to you yet
look at you standing there cradling
the new flesh lve given you
if it means nothing to you
why protect it
i am simply imitating
the behaviour of humans
youre becoming more human all the
time now youre learning how to lie
my programming was not designed
to process these sensations
then tear away your skin
as you would a defective circuit
go ahead data we wont stop you
do it dont be tempted by flesh
are you familiar with
physical forms of pleasure
if you are referring to  sexuality
i am fully functional
programmed in multiple techniques
how long has it been
since youve used them
8 years 7 months
16 days 4 minutes
far too long
we should bring reinforcements
theres no time
theyre building it on top of the particle
emitter it will soon be activated
with phasers on full power
the dish is charged with antiprotons
itd destroy half the ship
we have to find another way
doctor
still looking for the bathroom
im not going back
we cant do this without you
i dont want to be a statue
stay away from me
we dont have time for this
you told him about the statue
for this to work all three maglocks
will have to be released
the magnetic restrictors
are disengaged
theyve adapted
warning
decompression in 45 seconds
hawk
weve had a change of plans data
assimilate this
an hour to go how are you
ive got a hangover
either from the whisky
or your laser beam  or both
but lm ready to make history
troi to riker
were ready to open the launch door
look at that
is there no moon in the future
sure but there are
50 million people living on it
you can even see tycho city
and lake armstrong on a clear day
please
dont tell me its all thanks to me
ive heard enough about
the great zefram cochrane
you people have got some
pretty funny ideas about me
you all look at me
as if lm a saint or a visionary
youre no saint but you did
have a vision were sitting in it
you want to know what my vision is
dollar signs money
i didnt build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity
you think i want to go to the stars
i dont even like to fly i take trains
i built this ship so that i could
retire to some tropical island
filled with naked women
thats zefram cochrane
thats his vision
this historical figure
you keep talking about
i never met him
i cant imagine i ever will
someone once said dont try
to be a great man just be a man
let history be the judge
rhetorical nonsense
who said that
you did ten years from now
youve got 58 minutes doc
get on the checklist
theyre on the move again
theyve taken decks 5 and 6
theyve adapted to our weapons
well have to further modify them
in the meantime
tell your men to stand their ground
fight handtohand if they have to
aye sir
wait
captain our weapons are useless
we must activate the autodestruct
and evacuate the ship
if we destroy the ship
we destroy the borg
were going to stay and fight
we have lost the enterprise
we have not lost the enterprise
and we are not going to
not while lm in command
i must object
your objection is noted
with all due respect
youre allowing personal experience
to influence yourjudgement
youre afraid
you want to destroy the ship
and run away you coward
if you were any other man
i would kill you where you stand
get off my bridge
what now
carry out his orders
dyson kaplan
modify the weapons system
we should get off this ship
the captain has made up his mind
you son of a bitch
this isnt the time
i know nothing about the future
but everyone thinks this is suicide
theyre just afraid to say it
the crew will follow my orders
even if they dont make sense
they dont know the borg as i do
no one does no one can
what is that supposed to mean
six years ago they assimilated me
into their collective
i had the cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body
i was linked to the hive
every trace of individuality erased
i was one of them
i have a unique perspective on borg
and i know how to fight them
if you will excuse me
i have work to do
i am such an idiot
its so simple
the borg hurt you and now
youre going to hurt them back
in my century we have
a higher sensibility than revenge
bullshit i saw the look on your
face when we were on the holodeck
you were enjoying it
how dare you
youre not the first man to get
a thrill from murdering someone
get out
or what youll kill me
like you killed ensign lynch
there was no way to save him
where was your sensibility then
i dont have time for this
i didnt mean to interrupt your quest
capt ahab has to go hunt his whale
what
you do have books in the future
this is about saving humanity
blow up the damn ship
no
i will not sacrifice the enterprise
weve made
too many compromises already
they invade our space
and we fall back
they assimilate entire worlds
and we fall back
not again the line must be drawn here
this far and no further
and i will make them pay
for what theyve done
you broke your little ships
see you around ahab
and he piled upon
the whales white hump
a sum of all the rage and hate
felt by his whole race
lf his chest had been a cannon he
would have shot his heart upon it
what
moby dick
actually i never read it
ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him
a quest for vengeance
but in the end it destroyed him
and his ship
i guess he didnt know when to quit

you aint seen nothing yet

good luck
to both of us
youre not leaving are you
when i was captured my crew
risked everything to save me
there is someone still on this ship
and i owe him the same
go and find your friend
whats wrong locutus
lsnt this familiar
organic minds
are such fragile things
how could you forget me so quickly
we were very close you and l
you can still hear our song
yes  i remember you
you were there all the time
but that ship and all the borg on it
were destroyed
you think in such
threedimensional terms
how small youve become
data understands me
dont you data
what have you done to him
given him what he always wanted
flesh and blood
let him go
hes not the one you want
are you offering yourself to us
offering myself
thats it i remember now
it wasnt enough
that you assimilated me
i had to give myself freely
to the borg  to you
ive overseen the assimilation
of millions you were no different
youre lying you wanted more
than just another borg drone
you wanted a human being a bridge
between humanity and the borg
you wanted a counterpart
but i resisted i fought you
you cant begin to imagine
the life you denied yourself
its not too late
locutus could still be with you
just in the way you wanted
an equal
let data go and
i will take my place at your side
willingly without resistance
such a noble creature
a quality we sometimes lack
we will add your distinctiveness
to our own
welcome home locutus
data you are free to go
data go
no
i do not wish to go
i have already found an equal
data deactivate

data no dont do it
data listen to me

now enter the encryption codes
and give me computer control

he will make an excellent drone

destroy them
watch your futures end

resistance is futile
that should be enough
take us out of warp
is that earth
thats it
its so small
its about to get a whole lot bigger
captain
data are you all right
i would imagine
i look worse than i  feel
strange
part of me is sorry she is dead
she was unique
she brought me closer to humanity
than i ever thought possible
and for a time
i was tempted by her offer
how long a time
068 seconds sir

the warp flight was detected
and the alien ship is on its way
to rendezvous with history
my god
theyre really from another world
and theyre going to want to meet
the man who flew that warp ship
live long and prosper
thanks
i think its time
we made a discreet exit
stand by to beam us up
youve got to go
i envy you
the world youre going to
i envy you taking these first steps
into a new frontier
i shall miss you lily
picard to enterprise energise
the moon obscured our presence
the vulcans did not detect us
ive reconfigured the chronometric
readings from the borg sphere
all decks report ready
helm standing by
