authorisation  picard 47 at 
  did i catch you at a bad time 
  no  admiral  of course not 
i ve just heard that our colony on
ivor prime has been destroyed 
  long range sensors   
  yes  i know  the borg 
captain s log  stardate 50893 5 
the moment have dreaded for
nearly six years has finally arrived 
the borg  our lethal enemy  have
begun an invasion of the federation 
this time
there maybe no stopping them 
  how many ships 
  one  on a direct course for earth 
they ll be in federation space soon 
admiral hayes is mobilising a fleet 
  it will take us three hours   
  we re not going 
  what do you mean 
  we re to patrol the neutral zone 
in case the romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation 
there has been no unusual activity
along the romulan border 
does starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time 
we re ready  the enterprise e is
the most advanced ship in the fleet 
i have gone over all this
with starfleet  their orders stand 
number one 
set a course for the neutral zone 
  bizet 
  berlioz  what do you have 
we ve finished
our first sweep of the neutral zone 
fascinating 
20 particles of dust per cubic metre 
52 ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a class two comet 
this is certainly
worthy of our attention 
captain  why are we out here 
starfleet has every confidence
in the enterprise and her crew 
they re just not sure
about her captain 
a man once captured
and assimilated by the borg  
  should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again 
it would introduce an unstable element
to a critical situation 
your experience makes you
the perfect man to lead this fight 
bridge to captain picard 
we ve received word from the fleet 
they ve engaged the borg 
mr data  put starfleet frequency 1486
on audio 
flagship endeavour 
stand by to engage 
defiant and bozeman 
fallback to mobile position one 
we have it in visual range 
a borg cube on course 0215    
we are the borg  lower your shields
and surrender your ships 
we will add your biological
distinctiveness to our own 
your culture will adapt to serve us 
resistance is futile 
all units  open fire 
they ve broken through
the defence perimeter 
continue to attack 
we need reinforcements 
96 dead and 22 wounded
on the lexington 
lt hawk  set a course for earth 
maximum warp 
i am about to disobey our orders 
any of you who wish to object
should do so now 
i believe i speak for everyone here
when i say    
    to hell with our orders 
red alert  all hands to battle stations 
engage 
  report 
  power off line  our weapons are gone 
perhaps today is a good day to die 
prepare for ramming speed 
sir  there s another ship coming in 
it s the enterprise 
  the defiant is losing life support 
  beam the survivors aboard 
they ve destroyed the admiral s ship 
  what is the status of the borg cube 
  the outer hull has been damaged 
i am reading fluctuations
in their power grid 
number one 
open a channel to the fleet 
this is capt picard 
i m taking command of the fleet 
plot in the following coordinates 
fire on my command 
  is that a vital system 
  trust me  data 
the fleet has responded  sir 
they re standing by 
fire 
  mr hawk  pursuit course  engage 
  aye  sir 
  what 
  i can hear them 
i have a patient here
who insists on coming to the bridge 
  welcome aboard  mr worf 
  thank you  sir 
  the defiant 
  adrift  but salvageable 
  tough little ship 
  little 
mr worf  we could use some help
at tactical 
you do remember
how to fire phasers 
we re detecting
chronometric particles 
  they re creating a temporal vortex 
  time travel 
  data  report 
  we re caught in a temporal wake 
captain     earth 
there are high concentrations
of methane and carbon monoxide 
  life signs 
  approximately nine billion 
  all borg 
  how  
they did it in the past  they went back
and assimilated earth  changed history 
why are we still here 
the temporal wake protected us
from changes in the time line 
  the vortex is collapsing 
  hold your course 
we must follow them back
and repair the damage they ve done 
  come on 
  good night  eddie 
go home 
you ll regret this tomorrow 
you should have learned by now
that i don t have regrets 
  one more round  lily 
  z  you ve had enough 
  i m not flying with a drunken pilot 
  i can t fly sober 
what is that 
  that is the constellation leo 
  no  that 
  it s the econ 
  after all these years 
we ve got to get to the phoenix 
to hell with the phoenix 
shields are down 
main power is holding 
we are in the mid 21st century 
i would estimate we have arrived
ten years after the third world war 
that makes sense  most of the
major cities have been destroyed 
  600 million dead  no resistance 
  captain 
mr worf  quantum torpedoes 
fire 
they were firing at the surface 
location 
western hemisphere 
north american continent 
  a missile complex in montana 
  a missile complex  
data  i need to know the exact date 
april 4th  2063 
april 4th 
the day before first contact 
the missile complex must be
where cochrane is building his ship 
they came to stop first contact 
  how much damage  lieutenant 
  i can t tell 
we ll have to go down there
and find out what happened 
have a security team ready 
computer  21st century clothing 
number one  you have the bridge 
over here 
they re all dead 
see if one of them is cochrane 
data  let s go check the warp ship 
the structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact 
the fuselage is slightly damaged 
we have the blueprints 
we need a team down here 
  hold your fire  we re here to help 
  bullshit 
captain  i believe i can handle this 
greetings 
this woman
requires medical attention 
  severe radiation poisoning 
  from the damaged ship 
i have to get her to sick bay 
no lectures on the prime directive 
l ll keep her unconscious 
tell riker to beam down with
a search party to find cochrane 
crusher to enterprise 
two to beam directly to sick bay 
in 48 hours
this ship has to be launched 
geordi  the ship was damaged in the
attack  get a repair crew down here 
i m on my way  alpha team 
we re heading down to the surface 
porter  take command while l m gone 
check out the environmental controls 
it s a little warm in here 
isn t it amazing 
this ship
used to be a nuclear missile 
an historical irony  using an
instrument of mass destruction  
  to inaugurate an era of peace 
a boyhood fantasy  i ve seen
this ship in the smithsonian   
  but i was never able to touch it 
does tactile contact
alter your perception of the phoenix  
for humans  touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way 
it makes it seem more real 
i m detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing 
temperature variations
in the fuel manifold 
it is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago 
  would you three like to be alone 
  what have you found out 
  there s no sign of cochrane 
  he has to be here 
this ship and this flight
were his dream 
we should consider the possibility
that dr cochrane died in the attack 
if that s true    
then the future may die with him 
  what do you think  
  the entire system has gone crazy 
it s affecting the entire deck 
i ll check the eps conduits 
  hello  hey 
  are you talking to me 
is anyone else working up here 
not that i know of 
paul 
paul  are you okay in there 
captain  what is it 
picard to enterprise  mr worf 
is everything all right up there 
we are experiencing some
environmental diffiiculties 
humidityhas risen 73     
and the temperature is up 10 degrees 
mr data and i will be right there 
number one  take charge down here 
the damage to her cell membranes
is repaired  she should be fine 
find out why it s so hot in here 
  now what 
  crusher to engineering 
crusher to bridge 
  exactly what s been happening 
  we ve lost contact with deck 16 
i was about to send
a security team to investigate 
no  seal off deck 16  post
security teams at every access point 
what environmental conditions
were last reported in engineering 
92      humidity 
39 1 degrees celsius 
39 1 degrees celsius    
iike a borg ship 
they knew their ship was doomed 
our shields were down 
somehow they transported over here
without being detected 
they ll assimilate the enterprise    
and then earth 
picard to riker 
enterprise to away team 
respond 
main control is being re routed
through engineering 
data  lock out the main computer 
i have isolated the main computer
with an encryption code 
the borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16 
the borg won t stay on deck 16 
you re all right  come on  wake up 
you are all right  listen to me 
you re going to be fine 
i need you to do as i say 
  is the emh programme on line 
  it should be 
  activate the emh programme 
  what is the nature of the emergency  
20 borg are about to break in here 
create a diversion 
this isn t part of my programme 
i m a doctor 
do a dance  tell a story 
just give us a few seconds 
according to medical research  borg
implants can cause skin irritations 
perhaps you d like
an analgesic cream 
which way  
we need to get off this deck 
follow me 
engineering will be the central point
from which they control the hive 
if we begin firing in there 
we may hit the warp core 
our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks 
plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact 
the borg cannot survive
without their organic components 
all weapons will be set
on a rotating modulation 
the borg will adapt quickly 
we ll be able to fire 12 shots at most 
you may encounter crew members
who have already been assimilated 
don t hesitate to fire  believe me 
you ll be doing them a favour  let s go 
deanna 
deanna 
will  don t turn off that    
who is this jerk   and who told him
he could turn off my music 
will riker  zefram cochrane 
  is he a friend of yours 
  yes 
  husband 
  no 
good 
  this  deena    
  deanna 
this     is the good stuff 
dr cochrane    
to the phoenix    
may she rest in peace 
okay  that wasn t so good 
  we have to tell him the truth 
  then the time line    
this is no time to argue about time 
we don t have the time 
  what was i saying 
  you re drunk 
he wouldn t even talk to me
unless i had a drink with him 
it took three shots of tequila
just to find out his name 
i ve spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me 
so don t go criticising
my counselling techniques 
it s a primitive culture 
i m just trying to blend in 
he didn t believe our cover story 
we re running out of time 
will he be able to handle the truth 
if you re looking for my
professional opinion     he s nuts 
i ll be sure to note that in my log 
captain  i believe l m feeling    
anxiety 
it is an intriguing sensation 
data  perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now 
good idea  sir     done 
data  there are times that i envy you 
it s only me  we have wounded here 
  get these people back to deck 14 
  there was a civilian with us 
  we ll watch for her 
  please  try to find her 
lower your weapons  they ll ignore
us till the consider us a threat 
the manual release 
mr worf  hold this position 
manualrelease on line 
perhaps we should just knock 
data 
ready phasers 
data  cover me 
captain  they have adapted 
regroup on deck 15 
don t let them touch you 
  captain 
  data 
here 
help 
please  help 
  you  how the hell    
  back off 
who are you 
what faction are you with 
  i m not with the eastern coalition 
  just get me the hell out of here 
  now 
  that isn t going to be easy 
you d better find a way 
or l m going to start pushing buttons 
  follow me 
  slow 
you won t be able to break
the encryption codes 
nor will you
be able to assimilate me 
brave words 
i ve heard them before 
from thousands ofspecies
across thousands ofworlds 
butnow they are aliborg 
i am unlike any life form
you have encountered before 
you are an imperfectbeing 
created by an imperfectbeing 
findingyour weakness
is only a matter oftime 
let me make sure i understand you
correctly  commander 
a group of cybernetic creatures
from the future  
  have travelled back through time
to enslave the human race 
and you re here to stop them 
hot damn  you re heroic 
  we re going to prove it to you 
  there she is  beautiful 
  all right  take a look 
  well  well  well    
what have we got here 
i love a good peep show 
that s a trick 
how did you do that 
  it s your telescope 
  that s our ship  the enterprise 
and lily is up there 
can i talk to her  
we ve lost contact with the ship 
we don t know why yet 
  so what is it you want me to do 
  conduct your flight as planned 
why tomorrow morning 
at 1 1 o clock an alien ship
will be passing this solar system 
alien  you mean extra terrestrials 
  more bad guys 
  good guys 
they have no interest in earth    
too primitive 
when they discover that humans have
learned how to fly faster than light   
  they alter their course and make
first contact with earth right here 
  here 
  actually  over there 
it s a pivotal moment in human history 
you make contact with an alien race 
after you do 
everything begins to change 
fleets of starships are built
and mankind explores the galaxy 
it unites humanity when they realise
they re not alone in the universe 
poverty  disease and war
will all be gone in 50 years 
but unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow  none of it will happen 
you people are all astronauts    
    on some kind of star trek 
i know this is a lot to take in 
but we re running out of time 
  we need your help 
  what do you say  
why not 
it looks pretty bad  sir 
they control decks 26 up to 1 1  
when they took deck 1 1  
they stopped 
they ve assimilated half the ship 
why stop there 
  what is on deck 1 1 
  hydroponics  deflector control 
they stopped there because
it gave them a tactical advantage 
return to your checkpoints 
what happened in sick bay  
where s dr crusher  
  why did you break the cease fire 
  we didn t attack you 
there s a new faction that
wants to prevent tomorrow s launch 
we re here to help you 
you are not in montana anymore 
you are on a spaceship
orbiting the earth 
  get me out of here 
  all right 
you want a way out  here it is 
what is this 
australia  new guinea 
the solomons 
montana will be up soon 
but it s a long way down 
i m not your enemy
and i can get you home 
put the weapon down and trust me 
jean luc picard 
that s my name  what s yours 
  lily 
  welcome aboard  lily 
thank you 
maximum setting  if you d fired this 
you d have vaporised me 
it s my first ray gun 
  there s no glass 
  forcefield 
  i ve never seen such technology 
  it hasn t been invented yet 
there s more i have to tell you 
come on 
are you ready 
  who are you 
  i am the borg 
that is a contradiction  the borg
have a collective consciousness 
there are no individuals 
i am the beginning  the end 
the one who is many 
i am the borg 
greetings 
i am curious 
do you control the borg collective 
you imply disparity where
none exists  i am the collective 
i ll rephrase the question 
i wish to understand their hierarchy 
are you their leader  
i bring order to chaos 
a cryptic response 
you are in chaos  data 
you are a machine
who wishes to be human 
i am programmed
to evolve and to better myself 
we  too  are on a quest
to better ourselves 
evolving toward a state of perfection 
forgive me  but the borg
do not evolve  they conquer 
by assimilating other beings we are
bringing them closer to perfection 
somehow i question your motives 
that is because you haven t
been properly     stimulated yet 
you have reactivated
my emotion chip  why  
  don t be frightened 
  i am not frightened 
  do you know what this is 
  it would appear to be organic skin 
what a cold description
for such a beautiful gift 
was that good for you 
  how big is this federation 
  over 150 planets 
  they span 8 000 light years 
  you mustn t get home much 
i tend to think of this ship as home 
i get back to earth whenever i can 
  they haven t broken the code yet 
  who  the zombies 
  the borg 
  it sounds swedish 
  how big is this ship 
  24 decks  700 metres long 
it took me six months to find enough
titanium just to build a cockpit 
how much did this thing cost 
the economics of the future
are somewhat different 
money doesn t exist
in the 24th century 
no money  
you mean you don t get paid 
the acquisition of wealth is no
longer the driving force in our lives 
we work to better ourselves    
    and the rest of humanity 
actually  we re rather like
yourself and dr cochrane 
all right 
  come on 
  is there another way around 
i know what l m doing 
definitely not swedish 
what the hell are you doing 
perhaps something in satin 
i m sorry  but we re closing 
and we have a strict dress code 
if you boys don t leave    
  i m looking for nicky the nose 
  he hasn t been here in months 
this is the wrong chapter 
computer  begin chapter 13 
try and look
as if you re having a good time 
no  look at me 
try to act naturally 
there he is 
  ruby  this is not a good time 
  it s never the time for us  dix 
  is that a case you re working on 
  i ll see you later 
okay  but watch your caboose
and dump the broad 
look what the cat dragged in 
what s shakin   dix  
the usual  martinis and skirts 
excuse me 
  i m going to take that personal 
  no offence 
hey 
i think you got him 
i don t get it  i thought
you said this was a hologram 
i disengaged the safety protocols 
so even a holographic bullet can kill 
  what are you doing 
  looking for the neural processor 
it s like a memory chip 
it will contain a record of all the
instructions this borg has received 
  it s one of your uniforms 
  yes  this was ensign lynch 
tough luck  huh 
i ve got to get to the bridge 
  doctor    
  yeah 
  would you take a look at this 
  yeah 
i ve constructed the intermix chamber
from what i remember in school 
  you learned about this in school 
  yeah 
  basic warp design   is required
reading  you re the first chapter 
well  it looks like you got it right 
this is what we re using to replace
the damaged plasma conduit 
yes  but you need to reinforce
the tubing with a nano polymer 
dr cochrane  i know this sounds
silly  but can i shake your hand 
it s such an honour to work with you 
i never imagined l d meet
the man who invented warp drive 
i m sorry     thanks 
  do they have to keep doing that 
  it s just a little hero worship 
i can t say i blame them 
we all grew up hearing about you 
or  what you re aboutto do 
i shouldn t say this   
  but i went
to zefram cochrane high school 
really  
  i wish i had a picture of this 
  what 
in the future  this whole area
becomes an historical monument 
you re standing on the exact spot
where your statue is going to be 
statue 
it s marble  about 20 metres tall 
you re looking up at the sky 
your hand
is reaching toward the future 
i ve got to take a leak 
leak   i m not detecting any leak 
don t you people
from the 24th century ever pee 
oh  leak  i get it 
  that s pretty funny 
  excuse me 
commander    
reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated 
i found something you lost 
  i am a klingon 
  mr worf  report 
the borg control over half the ship 
there s no power to the bridge 
i ve accessed
a borg neural processor 
they re transforming the deflector
dish into an interplexing beacon  
  to establish a link with the borg
living in the 21st century 
but the borg
are still in the delta quadrant 
they ll send reinforcements 
humanity will be an easy target 
we must destroy the deflector dish 
we can t get to deflector control
or a shuttle craft    
mr worf  do you remember
your zero g combat training 
i remember it made me
sick to my stomach 
  what are you suggesting 
  it s time we took a little stroll 
there s a humanoid life sign
up ahead 
51 1 metres 
cochrane 
it s him  all right 
i ve re modulated the weapons 
but the borg will be quick to adapt 
we must make every shot count 
magnetise 
  watch your caboose  dix 
  i intend to 
  how are you doing  worf 
  not well  sir 
try not to look at the stars 
keep your eyes on the hull 
let s go 
tell me  are you using
a polymer based neuro rely  
  to transmit organic nerve impulses
to my positronic net 
if so  how have you solved
the problem of signal degradation 
do you always talk this much 
not always  but often 
why do you insist
on using this primitive language 
your android brain
is capable of much more 
i am trying to become more human 
we used to be just like them 
flawed  weak  organic 
we evolved to include the synthetic 
we use both to attain perfection 
your goal
should be the same as ours 
believing oneself to be perfect is
often the sign of a delusional mind 
a small being  trying to attack
what he doesn t understand 
you have no real interest in me 
your goal is to obtain
the codes for the computer 
that is one of our goals 
one of many 
and to reach it 
l m willing to help you reach yours 
is it becoming clear to you yet 
look at you  standing there cradling
the new flesh l ve given you 
if it means nothing to you 
why protect it 
i am simply imitating
the behaviour of humans 
you re becoming more human all the
time  now you re learning how to lie 
my programming was not designed
to process these sensations 
then tear away your skin
as you would a defective circuit 
go ahead  data  we won t stop you 
do it  don t be tempted by flesh 
are you familiar with
physical forms of pleasure 
if you are referring to     sexuality   
  i am fully functional 
programmed in multiple techniques 
how long has it been
since you ve used them 
8 years  7 months 
16 days  4 minutes    
far too long 
  we should bring reinforcements 
  there s no time 
they re building it on top of the particle
emitter  it will soon be activated 
  with phasers on full power    
  the dish is charged with anti protons 
it d destroy half the ship 
we have to find another way 
doctor 
  still looking for the bathroom 
  i m not going back 
  we can t do this without you 
  i don t want to be a statue 
  stay away from me 
  we don t have time for this 
you told him about the statue 
for this to work  all three maglocks
will have to be released 
the magnetic restrictors
are disengaged 
they ve adapted 
warning 
decompression in 45 seconds 
hawk 
we ve had a change of plans  data 
assimilate this 
  an hour to go  how are you 
  i ve got a hangover 
either from the whisky
or your laser beam     or both 
but l m ready to make history 
troi to riker 
we re ready to open the launch door 
  look at that 
  is there no moon in the future 
sure  but there are
50 million people living on it 
you can even see tycho city
and lake armstrong on a clear day 
please    
don t tell me it s all thanks to me 
i ve heard enough about
the great zefram cochrane 
you people have got some
pretty funny ideas about me 
you all look at me
as if l m a saint or a visionary 
you re no saint  but you did
have a vision  we re sitting in it 
you want to know what my vision is 
dollar signs  money 
i didn t build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity 
you think i want to go to the stars 
i don t even like to fly  i take trains 
i built this ship so that i could
retire to some tropical island   
  filled with naked women 
that s zefram cochrane 
that s his vision 
this historical figure
you keep talking about    
i never met him 
i can t imagine i ever will 
someone once said    don t try
to be a great man  just be a man   
    let history be the judge   
  rhetorical nonsense 
  who said that 
  you did  ten years from now 
you ve got 58 minutes  doc 
get on the checklist 
they re on the move again 
they ve taken decks 5 and 6 
  they ve adapted to our weapons 
  we ll have to further modify them 
in the meantime 
tell your men to stand their ground 
  fight hand to hand if they have to 
  aye  sir 
wait 
captain  our weapons are useless 
we must activate the auto destruct
and evacuate the ship 
if we destroy the ship 
we destroy the borg 
  we re going to stay and fight 
  we have lost the enterprise 
we have not lost the enterprise
and we are not going to 
  not while l m in command 
  i must object    
  your objection is noted 
  with all due respect    
you re allowing personal experience
to influence yourjudgement 
you re afraid 
you want to destroy the ship
and run away  you coward 
if you were any other man 
i would kill you where you stand 
get off my bridge 
  what now  
  carry out his orders 
dyson  kaplan 
modify the weapons system 
  we should get off this ship 
  the captain has made up his mind 
  you son of a bitch 
  this isn t the time 
i know nothing about the future 
but everyone thinks this is suicide 
  they re just afraid to say it 
  the crew will follow my orders 
  even if they don t make sense 
  they don t know the borg as i do 
  no one does  no one can 
  what is that supposed to mean 
six years ago  they assimilated me
into their collective 
i had the cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body 
i was linked to the hive 
every trace of individuality erased 
i was one of them 
i have a unique perspective on borg
and i know how to fight them 
if you will excuse me 
i have work to do 
i am such an idiot    
it s so simple 
the borg hurt you  and now
you re going to hurt them back 
in my century we have
a higher sensibility than revenge 
bullshit  i saw the look on your
face when we were on the holodeck 
  you were enjoying it 
  how dare you 
you re not the first man to get
a thrill from murdering someone 
  get out 
  or what  you ll kill me 
  like you killed ensign lynch 
  there was no way to save him 
  where was your sensibility then 
  i don t have time for this 
i didn t mean to interrupt your quest 
capt ahab has to go hunt his whale 
  what 
  you do have books in the future 
this is about saving humanity 
  blow up the damn ship 
  no 
i will not sacrifice the enterprise 
we ve made
too many compromises already 
they invade our space 
and we fall back 
they assimilate entire worlds 
and we fall back 
not again  the line must be drawn here 
this far and no further 
and i will make them pay
for what they ve done 
you broke your little ships 
see you around  ahab 
  and he piled upon
the whale s white hump  
  a sum of all the rage and hate
felt by his whole race   
  lf his chest had been a cannon  he
would have shot his heart upon it   
what 
    moby dick  
  actually  i never read it 
ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him 
a quest for vengeance 
but in the end it destroyed him  
  and his ship 
i guess he didn t know when to quit 
prepare to evacuate the enterprise

mr worf    
  i regret some of the things i said 
  some 
as a matter of fact  i think you re
the bravest man l ve ever known 
thank you  sir

  good luck 
  everybody ready to make history  
i think i forgot something

  wow 
  you ain t seen nothing yet 
if you see any of my crew 
give them this 
orders to live a quite corner of america
and stay out of history s way 
  good luck 
  to both of us 
you re not leaving  are you 
when i was captured  my crew
risked everything to save me 
there is someone still on this ship 
and i owe him the same 
go and find your friend 
what s wrong  locutus 
lsn t this familiar  
organic minds
are such fragile things 
how could you forget me so quickly  
we were very close  you and l 
you can still hear our song 
yes     i remember you 
you were there all the time 
but that ship and all the borg on it
were destroyed 
you think in such
three dimensional terms 
how small you ve become 
data understands me 
  don t you  data 
  what have you done to him 
given him what he always wanted 
flesh and blood 
let him go 
he s not the one you want 
  are you offering yourself to us 
  offering myself 
that s it  i remember now 
it wasn t enough
that you assimilated me 
i had to give myself freely
to the borg     to you 
i ve overseen the assimilation
of millions  you were no different 
you re lying  you wanted more
than just another borg drone 
you wanted a human being  a bridge
between humanity and the borg 
you wanted a counterpart 
but i resisted  i fought you 
you can t begin to imagine
the life you denied yourself 
it s not too late 
locutus could still be with you 
just in the way you wanted 
an equal 
let data go  and
i will take my place at your side   
  willingly  without resistance 
such a noble creature 
a quality we sometimes lack 
we will add your distinctiveness
to our own 
welcome home  locutus 
data  you are free to go 
  data  go 
  no 
  i do not wish to go 
  i have already found an equal

he will make an excellent drone 
plasma injectors on line  everything
is looking good  i think we re ready 
we must break the warp barrier in the
next five minutes to get their attention 
  main cells are charged and ready 
  let s do it

sweet jesus 
relax  they re just here
to give us a send off 
i am bringing
the external sensors on line 
30 seconds to warp threshold 
  approaching light speed 
  we re at critical velocity 
  quantum torpedoes locked 
  destroy them 
watch your future s end 
  data 
  resistance is futile 
that should be enough 
take us out of warp 
  is that earth 
  that s it 
  it s so small 
  it s about to get a whole lot bigger 
  captain 
  data  are you all right 
i would imagine
i look worse than i     feel 
strange    
part of me is sorry she is dead 
she was unique 
she brought me closer to humanity
than i ever thought possible 
and for a time 
i was tempted by her offer 
how long a time 
0 68 seconds  sir 
for an android 
that is nearly an eternity 
captain s log  april 5th  2063 
the voyage ofthe phoenix
was a success     again 
the warp flight was detected   
  and the alien ship is on its way
to rendezvous with history 
my god 
they re really from another world 
and they re going to want to meet
the man who flew that warp ship 
live long and prosper 
thanks 
i think it s time
we made a discreet exit 
stand by to beam us up 
you ve got to go 
i envy you 
the world you re going to 
i envy you  taking these first steps
into a new frontier 
i shall miss you  lily 
picard to enterprise  energise 
the moon obscured our presence 
the vulcans did not detect us 
i ve reconfigured the chronometric
readings from the borg sphere 
  all decks report ready 
  helm standing by
