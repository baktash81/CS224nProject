all right  boys  come on 
let s go  get in the car 
i ve got my eye on you two 
 cheyenne   boys screaming 
cheyenne 
oh  my god 
 cheyenne   boys screaming 
nick  it s that lady with the kids 
from the racetrack 
we just lost a really hot milf 
 dude  this is serious 
 yeah 
don t you think it s weird
that two of the people nick saved are dead 
weird is putting tampons in your kids  ears 
that s weird 
she was bound to die sooner or later 
that s actually why we asked you guys
to come over 
the night before it happened 
nick had a really strange dream 
great  i m glad i cancelled my golf game
for this  good 
nick 
but it wasn t a dream 
it was like these random sounds
and images 
they really didn t make any sense 
and then i read what killed them   
   and i realized that i d seen
how the next person was gonna die 
wait  what do you mean 
 the next person  
okay  don t laugh 
but we stayed up googling premonitions   
   visions  signs  things like that  just to see
how much information we could get 
nick 
there are tons of articles about people   
   who had a premonition
about a disaster   
   they saved themselves   
   and then they died 
okay  so people died  so what 
nick 
every survivor died 
in the precise order they were meant to die
in the accident 
well  we survived 
so now does that mean we all die 
 well  who s next 
 i don t remember 
but there might be an out 
some say the chain can be broken 
like if you were to intervene
into someone else s death   
   that would end it 
but others say
unless the chain is broken completely   
   then you re just changing the batting
order  and sooner or later  you re up 
that is some spooky psychobabble shit 
shut up  please  this is not funny 
 he could be watching a ton of tv 
 you know what this does to me 
it s okay  all we re trying to do
is figure out what s going on 
janet  you are gonna have to
figure that out without me 
you can call me later  but i gotta go 
hope you have fun 
lori 
janet  come back  don t leave 
janet  no  lori  no 
you guys are freaking me out 
what s with that 
she went from uptight but normal   
   to uptight and totally insane 
why do you gotta be a prick 
she saw somebody die 
hunt  so did we 
nick  yeah  and we re all freaked out 
would it kill you to be sensitive 
hunt 
i don t know 
i ve never tried it 
where are you going 
if you re right
about this whole crash thing   
   then i m going to make the most
of every moment i have left 
so i m gonna do what i do best 
i m gonna go get laid 
if i m dying  i m trying 
keep up the good fight  guys 
and if i happen to bump into janet 
i will check on her 
thanks 
 sighs 
well  that went well 
yeah  our friends think we re crazy 
it s great 
well  maybe we are 
look  they re probably
just some weird coincidences 
 sighs 
you think 
i hope so 
nick  what did you see 
 l think we can stop it 
 how 
we gotta go to the racetrack 
lori 
oh  my god 
look at this place 
all those people just   
 l don t wanna be here 
nick  i know  i know 
but this is the only thing that i can think of
to help me remember the order 
it s over here  this is where we were 
let s see if this works 
the mechanic s girlfriend dies first 
 gasping 
then that racist and his wife 
 crowd screaming 
that woman with the kids  she was next 
let s go  we shouldn t be here  let s go 
i can t remember who dies when 
 it s okay 
 i don t know what to do  i can t  
maybe this was a really bad idea 
no 
i gotta try 
you better have a damn good reason
for trespassing 
nick 
i just need to remember the order 
george  young man  that sounds crazy 
but maybe this will help you 
now  this will bring up
all our video cameras right here 
there 
that s where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies 
 so he s next  then 
nick  i think so 
that collapse kills hunt and janet 
and that s when you die 
and then lori 
then me 
maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed  we can break the chain   
   and the rest of us will be safe 
but how 
i mean  we don t even know his name 
 we know nothing about him 
nick  but we do know where he works 
grandstate customs 
man 1

george 
hey  i know exactly how you feel 
i lost my wife and my daughter
in a car accident 
i was driving and i was drunk 
every day  i ask myself how come
it couldn t be me instead of them 
for a long time 
i carried so much pain and anger   
   it was actually destroying their memory 
so now i try to live each day in their name 
hey  guys  i hate to break it to you 
but i m getting a really bad feeling 
look  kid
