cheyenne  boys screaming
cheyenne
oh my god
cheyenne  boys screaming
nick its that lady with the kids
from the racetrack
we just lost a really hot milf
dude this is serious
yeah
dont you think its weird
that two of the people nick saved are dead
weird is putting tampons in your kids ears
thats weird
she was bound to die sooner or later
thats actually why we asked you guys
to come over
the night before it happened
nick had a really strange dream
great im glad i cancelled my golf game
for this good
nick
but it wasnt a dream
it was like these random sounds
and images
they really didnt make any sense
and then i read what killed them
and i realized that id seen
how the next person was gonna die
wait what do you mean
the next person
okay dont laugh
but we stayed up googling premonitions
visions signs things like that just to see
how much information we could get
nick
there are tons of articles about people
who had a premonition
about a disaster
they saved themselves
and then they died
okay so people died so what
nick
every survivor died
in the precise order they were meant to die
in the accident
well we survived
so now does that mean we all die
well whos next
i dont remember
but there might be an out
some say the chain can be broken
like if you were to intervene
into someone elses death
that would end it
but others say
unless the chain is broken completely
then youre just changing the batting
order and sooner or later youre up
that is some spooky psychobabble shit
shut up please this is not funny
he could be watching a ton of tv
you know what this does to me
its okay all were trying to do
is figure out whats going on
janet you are gonna have to
figure that out without me
you can call me later but i gotta go
hope you have fun
lori
janet come back dont leave
janet no lori no
you guys are freaking me out
whats with that
she went from uptight but normal
to uptight and totally insane
why do you gotta be a prick
she saw somebody die
hunt so did we
nick yeah and were all freaked out
would it kill you to be sensitive
hunt
i dont know
ive never tried it
where are you going
if youre right
about this whole crash thing
then im going to make the most
of every moment i have left
so im gonna do what i do best
im gonna go get laid
if im dying im trying
keep up the good fight guys
and if i happen to bump into janet
i will check on her
thanks
sighs
well that went well
yeah our friends think were crazy
its great
well maybe we are
look theyre probably
just some weird coincidences
sighs
you think
i hope so
nick what did you see
l think we can stop it
how
we gotta go to the racetrack
lori
oh my god
look at this place
all those people just
l dont wanna be here
nick i know i know
but this is the only thing that i can think of
to help me remember the order
its over here this is where we were
lets see if this works
the mechanics girlfriend dies first
gasping
then that racist and his wife
crowd screaming
that woman with the kids she was next
lets go we shouldnt be here lets go
i cant remember who dies when
its okay
i dont know what to do i cant
maybe this was a really bad idea
no
i gotta try
you better have a damn good reason
for trespassing
nick
i just need to remember the order
george young man that sounds crazy
but maybe this will help you
now this will bring up
all our video cameras right here
there
thats where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies
so hes next then
nick i think so
that collapse kills hunt and janet
and thats when you die
and then lori
then me
maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed we can break the chain
and the rest of us will be safe
but how
i mean we dont even know his name
we know nothing about him
nick but we do know where he works
