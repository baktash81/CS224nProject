that the only person
who can save us is ourselves 
he s a monster 
a goddamn fucking monster 
that s what he is 
but i can t seem
to get away from him 
do you remember what drew you
to mitch in the first place 
we met at work  and   
he was charming
and mysterious 
he wined and dined me
and took me traveling 
and   
he told me it was me and him
against the world 
he made me feel important 
hello 
my name is
robert montague renfield 
and just like
all these decent folks 
i am in
a destructive relationship 
whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
that was a lot 
maybe we should just back up
to the beginning 
mr  renfield  i bid you welcome 
i am   
dracula 
when i met him 
i was a real estate lawyer
hoping to make a deal
that would change my life
and my family s lives forever 
oh  and it most certainly did 
you will make a very good
assistant  mr  renfield 
i understand how caitlyn feels 
i never drink wine 
he also wined and dined me 
he made me feel important 
he introduced me
into high society 
we went to the theater 
we traveled to exotic places 
and then he made me
his familiar 
which means that i take care
of master s every need 
including staff changes
and arranging his special
dietary requirements 
look  i didn t just jump into
serving the prince of darkness 
we had some great times 
but just like all great times   
  servant 
  they come to an end 
the hunters have returned 
ah  yes 
the bugs  this comes up a lot 
dracula s powers come from
consuming human life 
mine come from eating bugs 
make sense  great 
now  where were we 
i m coming  master 
shit  fuck  shit 
shit  fuck  shit  fuck 
sh sh sh shit 
this is a protection circle 
renfield 
mm 
he cannot escape 
let us rid this world
of his evil 
and you can finally be free 
free 
the moment i m gone 
they will lock you away
for what you ve done for me 
i am your only salvation 
i am your only friend 
i am the only one
who cares for you 
i actually remember thinking 
 he really  really means it
this time  
renfield 
we are the last of our kind 
from now on  every drop of blood
dracula spills
will be on your hands 
fuck  i was not expecting that 
or that 
master  you okay 
no 
yeah 
this is a fairly typical result 
at the peak of his powers 
dracula goes on
a full tilt
blood sucking bender 
the good guys show up
and do their thing 
and then it s up to me
to clean up the mess 
it s what
i call our transitional period 
so i take him to a new city 
nurse him back to full power 
find a decent place
to ride it out
until the whole cycle starts
all over again 
uh  excuse me  h hi 
may i borrow a pen  please 
thank    you 
which brings us back here 
in the meantime  i come here
and listen to these poor souls
talk about their monsters 
you were just talking
about mitch  what   
i know this is  like 
way down the list of bad stuff 
but he s also really into ska 
  the kind of music 
  yes 
fishbone  mustard plug 
voodoo glow skulls 
i fucking hate that shit 
i m so sorry  caitlyn  i m so   
  mark  i am    i m so sorry 
  it s okay 
is that the one
that s 99  horns 
yeah  see 
that s what i was thinking 
no 
that s a huge oversimplification
of ska s innovative contribution
to music 
oh  my god  who am i 
  renfield 
  hmm 
sorry  no  i swallowed a bug 
unintentionally 
what what other way
is there to   
would you like
to share your story 
no  thank thank you 
i don t think you d understand 
i know it s scary 
and you think things
are never gonna change 
but i promise you 
one day you re gonna realize
that you can have
the life that you want 
but in the meantime  i just hope
that you get something
out of coming here 
i am 
that s great 
oh  yes  i m getting something
out of coming here  victims 
but not these victims 
let s do our affirmations 
i am enough  and i have enough 
i deserve happiness 
i am grateful for all that i am 
and i take full charge
of my life today 
they can repeat these
affirmations all they want 
it ll never make
their problems go away 
but i can 
now  no one s ever gonna
call me a hero 
but i ve come up with
a mutually beneficial solution
for people like caitlyn 
get rid of their monsters
by giving mine what he needs 
hey  doug  what are you doing

you re under arrest  bitch 
fuck 
after decades of being
chased away
from every corner of the globe 
our options and bank account
have become a little limited 
it s not exactly a castle 
but it is exactly
the kind of place
no one tends to notice
a convalescing monster 
master 
master 
oh  dear jesus 
master 
there you are 
you re looking   
much better 
fetch me the hand 
yes  right away

i m sorry  master

unsuspecting tourists 
a handful of nuns  a a   
a busload of cheerleaders 
a busload of cheerleaders 
a busload of cheerleaders

like that 
do you mean female cheerleaders

i ll eat girls 
it s the purity 
it alone will bring me
back to   
full power 
i get it  master 
you deserve better 
but the modern world
is a dangerous place 
maybe if we were just
a little bit more careful 
we could  you know 
stop running 
you know  settle down 
and i could have   
we could have a life again 
it must be difficult
to be caught between
their rules and mine 
their rules offer
a confusing tangle of morality 
whereas mine are very simple 
you can kill and eat
whatever you want and never die 
and it truly is a gift 
and yet  you seem to think
it makes you
some sort of a monster 
do you have any idea
how inconsiderate that is 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
my needs are the only thing
that matters  servant 
and what exactly are my needs 
um  your needs  your needs
were the  uh   
uh  happy couples 
u unsuspecting tourists  uh

but overall pretty good   
three out of five stars 
i m sorry 
i don t mean to interrupt
whatever this is 
but   
can we get up now 
uh  yeah 
if i could have everyone

and  um  thank you 
y you    you saved my life

hmm 
wow  that was amazing 
she is amazing 
and she saw me 
she really saw me 
that hasn t happened in ages

  maybe there is hope 
  oh  god bless you 
maybe she can   
renfield 
what are you doing 
get here now 
ah  fuck 
do you think it s too late
to grab one of those nuns 
what did we talk about
yesterday 
u um   
i ve been up all day
thinking about it 
oh  what s this 
ah  my plan 
your plan 
but your plan has always been
to just drink blood 
exactly 
what have i been doing
all these years 
i mean  look at me 
lurking in the shadows and filth
like some kind
of a diseased animal 
you said it yourself   
i deserve better 
so  why am i not embracing
what i truly am 
which is 
a god  renfield 
an immortal  insatiable   
whoo     all powerful being 
everything you said about
the modern world is true 
  it is a dangerous place 
  hmm 
only not for us 
for them  it s a dangerous 
sad  broken place
full of fear and desperation 
it s weak 
longing for a powerful force
to guide it 
control it  dominate it 
  like you 
  hmm 
i mean  this entire society
was designed by renfields 
for renfields 
so  why should i
have to adapt to it 
it should have to adapt to me 
  i owe it all to you  servant 
  oh  no 
i think you actually might have
read between the lines
  a little bit there 
  indeed 
we re in this together 
dracula and renfield 
from now on  humanity
will no longer be divided
by the good and the evil 
only by followers   
and food 
you and i forever 
until the end of time 
bloody hell 
how is my life 
my life is like a   
never ending hallway
of fun house mirrors  but   
all the clowns are me 
uh  hey  everyone 
i need your help 
are you okay 
no 
i need to get out
of a toxic relationship 
okay  well  well  well  well 
take a seat and let her rip 
okay  thanks 
okay  yeah  fuck carol  i guess 
it s   
i hate her  too 
why don t you start
by telling us
what brought you here
in the first place 
i was on the job 
uh  for my boss 
uh  well  and i was
actually following bob 
because i thought
that bob would make
a very good  um  uh   
friend 
yes  thank you  bob 
thank you  renfield 
and then  you know 
i started to hear
all of your stories and   
i mean  they were all so sad 
that s us 
and  you know 
for the first time in years 
i felt like i wasn t alone 
you realized you re a codependent 
 mm hmm 
i need to change  i can see
that i i need to change 
and  uh  i want to  but my boss 
he s pretty delusional  i think 
uh  he thinks
he can take over the world 
he s a narcissist  renfield 
we all know exactly
how you feel 
  yes 
  exactly 
no  he s different 
you can t get him out of your head 
 no 
ooh  and you feel like
he could kill you
with the snap of his fingers 
yes  wouldn t even need to snap 
 oh 
he controls rats with his mind 
uh   
it s okay  it s okay 
he s on medication 
renfield  this is
codependency 101 
a narcissist will take
full advantage
of a codependent s
low self esteem 
but you re the one
with the real power 
and all you got to do
is take it back 
how do i do that 
focus on your needs 
i mean  i just haven t
thought about
any of my needs in years 
but if you were to stop focusing
on his needs  what would happen 
if i don t   
yeah  what would happen 
stop focusing on his needs 
what would happen 
he won t grow to full power 
exactly 
he won t grow to full power 
what  that s so weird 
why would you phrase it
like that 
but yes  he s right 
he s absolutely right 
he won t grow to full power 
you can take all that energy
you ve spent on him
and put it toward yourself 
and then you will be the one
who grows to full power 
  yes 
  full power 
me grow   
i i m gonna grow to full power 
i want to hear you say it 
say   i m gonna grow
to full power  
i i i m gonna grow
to full power 
i heard you say it 
but i didn t believe you 
  nope 
  let me hear you say it again 
  i m gonna grow to full power 
  yes 
i see a smile there
because you like it 
now  say it like
the world needs to hear it 
i m gonna grow to full power 
there you go 
  yes 
  that guy who walks
in here every single week 
say goodbye to him 
this is the person you are now 
  oh  oh  oh  am i ready   
  girl  there ain t a doubt  
  am i ready   
    what you talkin   bout   
    am i ready   
  you gon  figure it out  
  to be loved  to be loved  
  you found me 
i was fed up with the fantasy  
  what you wanna do     
here you go 
the power is in your hands 
that book is your armor 
it s your weapon 
it s your bible 
that s a cool ant farm 
is there room for one more 
  yeah 
  yeah 
thank you 
let s give him some ideas 
do you know what a brush is 
    am i ready   
    girl  there ain t a doubt  
oh  and clean
them nasty fingernails 
    what you talkin   bout   
    am i ready   
spa day  i ll go with you 
  to be loved     
get your chakras
balanced  homes 
ooh  and update
that wardrobe to this century 
  am i ready   
you would think
that attacking a police officer
in front of a bunch of witnesses
at a restaurant would be enough
to put teddy lobo behind bars 
you guys don t think i know
what s going on here  huh 
i don t know
how many of you assholes
are on the lobos  payroll 
but there s only so much
evidence you can tamper with
and so many witnesses
you can intimidate 
all right  because eventually 
someone brave enough
is going to step forward 
and they re going to help me
take down the lobos
and all of you motherfuckers 
permanently  permanently 
mr  renfield 
robert montague renfield 
yes  at your service 
you look different 
  oh 
  good different 
i really like your sweater 
oh  thank you 
  i went to macy s 
  oh 
um  i m here to give
my witness statement 
you always bring flowers
to give a witness statement 
yeah  uh  well 
th they re for everyone 
  they re for everyone 
  everyone 
do you  um   
probably put it in some water 
and the rest are for you 
  thank you 
  yeah  pleasure 
rebecca  is this your boyfriend 
shut the fuck up  kyle 
thank you for coming in 
mr  renfield 
it really means a lot 
yeah  it means a lot
that i can actually
do the right thing  for once 
well  if i could just stress
how appreciative i am
that you re here  uh 
because without you 
  i think i d be a bit lost 
  no 
you stood up for everyone
who s ever lived in fear
of the powerful forces
shaping their lives 
okay  and you need
to keep doing that 
because when
people like you stop
standing up to people like them 
that s when
the monsters take over 
so   
you are not lost 
you re an inspiration 
thank you  mr  renfield 
it s robert 
robert 
this is the same prick
who took out everyone
in the restaurant 
who does he work for 
  the five fucking families 
  i i don t know 
but we ve hacked into
the nsa s eye in the sky 
and we can track him
using all these other cameras
throughout the city 
yes  i can get you access
to whatever you want 
yeah  and then we enhance 
  we got a trace on him 
  boom 
we did it 
now we can track his every move 
his last known location
is at the old charity hospital 
you have until the end of the
day to find him and kill him 
give me ten minutes 
i ll take the end of the day 
can you run the dna on this pen
through the bureau s database 
and interpol 
i can t trust this with anyone
who works in my department 
this pen was found
near a location
where these three guys
went missing 
teddy lobo was fleeing
from the same location
when i arrested him 
huh

something to you  okay 
  okay 
  i was wrong about you 
i should ve realized
what you were capable of

to join me 
i i don t think i was eager 
i think that you caught me
at a low moment
and you maybe manipulated me  too 
 no  no  no 
no  no     and you just
caught me at a low moment
  and used some of your power   
  no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
i use my power
for a lot of things 
but i didn t need
to use it on you 
you were a lawyer
who wanted to get rich
off a real estate deal 
you re the one who used me 
you used my power
because you re a husk 
an empty void
that nothing can fill 
the only thing that gave your
life any meaning was my power 
the power you used
to bring me victims
while you pretended
to be one yourself 
however 
i m the real victim here 
i m the one
you swore to protect 
and you   
abandoned me 
no 
that s not true 
just like you abandoned
your wife and your daughter 
that s not    i didn t   
i didn t abandon them 
look into your own eyes 
renfield 
you re the monster  renfield 
not me 
it s you 
no  no 
that s enough  that s enough 
what 
i will no longer tolerate abuse 
stop laughing 
i deserve love 
i deserve happiness 
you deserve only suffering 
um  oh  i know being undead 
it s a painful existence   
it is    and i empathize
with your pain 
oh  please  illuminate me 
let me learn from you 
i will find everyone
you have ever loved 
and i will drain them 
  i will reduce this    this   
  s studio apartment 
studio apartment
until it s ash 
uh    uh   
affirmations  affirmations 
uh  i m enough  and  um 
i deserve some happiness 
there is some other stuff
that i have to say 
who put these ideas
in your head 
of course 
what 
shit 
you think doug was murdered 
i can t say for sure  but i   
i hope he was fucking murdered 
i hope he was torn to
itty bitty pieces and then

the shame talking

a little bit more than
just narcissism here 
master

i should never
have forsaken you

the power of a god
and the pathetic desperation
of humanity

there are some experiences
worse than death  renfield 
such as spending
the remaining years
of your miserable life

you ve witnessed
in the last century
will be nothing
compared to the suffering
i m going to unleash
on this world 
the world you chose over mine 
when i m finished 
the entire human race 
everyone you care about 
will suffer 
because you betrayed me 
  holy shit 
  hands in the air 
i destroyed everything 
i ll call it in 
i thought
i could save these people
by bringing dracula
all of their monsters 
but what i ve really done is
deliver my monster

give you an explanation 
no explanation necessary 
i don t want you to think of me

to be friends  but you re in
a lot of shit right now 
and there s a very good chance
i might be the only person
you can actually trust 
the fact that you are
the only person that i can trust
just proves that i am
monumentally fucked

because of
  your unresolved anger 
  what  
i m no psychologist  but i ve
been to a couple of meetings

my sister gets here soon 
there s a lot of heat on us 
i took my family
to a place like this in london
the morning i left
for dracula s castle 
you had a family 
i did 
um  it was a    a long time ago 
a really long time ago 
yeah  i m older than i look 
that s lilian 
she was five then 
i thought going to europe
to make some big deal
with a count
would give us
the life we deserved 
or  um   
what i thought i deserved 
i let them down in so many ways 
you know 
that s his greatest power 
he looks into your eyes
and finds
what you think you need
to make your life whole 
your    your dreams
and your desires
and your    greed 
your shame 
i blamed him for forcing me
to abandon my family 
but that    that s not true 
i   
i wanted all those things 
and i chose to follow him 
i m not a victim  i m   
i made all those mistakes
on my own 
look  i don t think
you re such a bad guy 
life throws
a lot of shit at you 
but sometimes
you fall under the thrall
of a vampire for a few decades 
and sometimes you call
your sister an unbearable twat
at grandma s birthday party 
you should make things right
with your sister while you can 
hmm 
speaking of 
i m gonna call her 
renfield  it s so wonderful
that you have finally
found someone
who does inspire you
to grow as a person 
hey  where are you 
i have found some people
who will unleash my potential
as well 
they understand this world
for what it is
and what it needs 
hello  rebecca 
looking for someone 
where s my sister 
i offered you so much  rebecca 
but you put your faith
in such fragile institutions
instead of something
far more enduring 
we ve got your sister 
she doesn t have much time 
rebecca  where are you going 
  to get my sister 
  rebecca  you don t understand 
it s not just the lobos  it s   
dracula is with them 
  fine  i ll go myself 
  look  please 
i tried to stand up to him 
and he killed people
i cared about 
i can t let that happen again 
you want to be a hero  renfield 
you have to risk everything 
and as someone
that cares about you 
you re never really gonna
be free until you face him 
you care about me 
is that what it takes
to get you in the car 
all right 
if we re gonna do this 
we need to prepare  and
we need to do it before sunset 
i m ready to do it before lunch 
okay 
let s face it 
they know we re coming 
so let s go in style 
yeah  just guns won t be enough 
i m gonna need bugs   
lots of bugs   
wooden stakes 
uh  crucifixes 
and  uh 
maybe a protection circle 
what the fuck is
a protection circle 
it s a circle
made of powder that   
it it traps demons
if you say the right 
  uh  latin stuff 
  forget it 
  na  na na na  na na na 
na na  na na  
  na  na na na  na na na     
oh  once it s dark 
it ll be too late 
can you maybe
save that for later 
oh  sorry 
  it s all in   
  is it in my teeth 
it is in every tooth 
    dress like a sleeper cell  
    na  na na na  na na na  
  i d rather go to hell  
  pull this pin 
let this world explode   
uh   
no matter what happens
in there  ju   
make sure you save your sister 
must be nice   
not needing to be invited in 
wait a second  wait a second 
don t i know you 
because you look so   
familiar 
afternoon  officer 
shit  i m out 
you think i need guns
to fuck you up 
let s do this  what the fuck 
fuck 
you should ve taken my offer
when you had the chance 
now the only choice
you re gonna get
is which one of your limbs
i m gonna tear off first 
go 
no 
oh  this must drive you crazy   
him choosing me over you 
i don t really have
strong feelings about it 
i m clearly the yin
to your yang 
we ve barely met twice 
you patronizing piece of shit 
oh  my goodness 
you almost scared me 
where s my sister 
oh  that 
one moment  please 
i need to set the mood first 
hello  rebecca 
don t worry 
i won t hurt you 
it s nice to finally meet you 
i can only imagine what
you might have heard about me
from poor renfield 
besides making him bring you
people to eat 
well  we did have
a complicated relationship 
however  when i saw you
through his eyes 
i knew i had
to make things right 
having dracula powers
is fucking amazing 
stop saying  dracula powers  
fine  what do you call it 
it s a curse 
god  you re such
a fucking drama queen 
would you please listen 
they come with a cost  okay 
you ll become his slave 
see  that s where you re wrong 
because master told me   
shit 
mm hmm 
for half a millennium 
i ve seen only weakness
in the hearts of men 
and then i looked into yours 
renfield used only
the smallest taste of my power
to do what he thought was good 
imagine what i could do 
rebecca  with you by my side 
we could bring
the justice you seek
to those who ve escaped it
for too long 
and i can heal your sister 
my blood will bring her back 
no 
say the word  rebecca 
and i will undo
what the lobos have done 
all i ask in exchange   
is for you
to join me 
no  don t listen to him 
he said the same shit to me 
can you save her 
yes 
what did he call you again 
an empty fucking husk 
see  that    that is why
dracula and i work
so well together 
i m a full husk 
full of everything you re not 
strength  power  loyalty 
her time is running out 
oh  join me 
don t 
i told you 
this is what he does 
so what 
i lost my dad 
i can t lose my sister 
and if he can give her
back to me   
i don t care
if i lose myself 
you were wrong about him 
he s not a monster 
he wants to be better  like you 
maybe i can help 
in all the darkness 
i can find the light 
shit 
that was impressive 
i can see what renfield saw   
in you 
now he ll see it go into me 
congratulations 
you shot my foot 
your foot still bleeds 
die 
no  oh  no 
you can t take my teeth 
you see  there will always
be people like you 
there are far more renfields
in this world
than there are rebeccas 
he s right 
there are millions
of people like me 
i am enough   
and they re all
trying to figure out
how to overcome
their destructive relationships 
always remember  you re the one
with the real power 
millions of codependent people 
i am the dark poetry
in the hearts of all mankind 
millions of people
just like me 
all you got to do
is take it back 
do you know what you are 
yes  i do 
i m robert   
montague renfield 
and i m a codependent 
you re right  you didn t
have to use your power
to make me your servant 
because i gave
all my power to you 
and i can take it back 
i am enough 
and i have enough 
and i am capable of change 
because i love myself 
i m taking   
full charge of my life today 
look into my eyes  dracula 
full power  motherfucker 
holy shit  it worked 
is that a protection circle 
i got the instructions
off a wiccan tumblr 
oh  and and that 
  cocaine 
  really 
yeah 
i guess any kind of powder works
as long as you say
the right magic words 
wow 
thank you  wiccan tumblr 
so  um  what do we do now 
  i wake up each morning  
  with your sweet kiss
on my mind  
  the early morning sun
shining through  
any last wishes 
i wish to spend
a season in hell 
where all
the amusing people are 
hail satan 
  i see your face in every     
yes  i know this looks extreme 
and maybe a little fun 
but to our defense 
there is so much
folklore out there about
how to actually kill a vampire 
it gets confusing 
you know  i ve personally
seen him come back
from some crazy shit

my name is
robert montague renfield 
and i m a codependent 
but i no longer feel
like a victim 
because i ve finally
faced my demons 
you might also say
i chopped my demons up
into tiny little pieces 
encased them in concrete
and flushed them down the drain 
and if i can find the power
to do that 
then maybe everyone can 
metaphorically speaking 
  i m free to do what i want  
  any old time  
  i said i m free
to do what i want  
  any old time  
  i say love me  hold me  
  love me  hold me  
   cause i m free

    love me forever  
    hold me  
    and love will never die  
  love me  hold me  
   cause i m free
