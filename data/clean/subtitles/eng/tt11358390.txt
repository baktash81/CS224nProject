that the only person
who can save us is ourselves
hes a monster
a goddamn fucking monster
thats what he is
but i cant seem
to get away from him
do you remember what drew you
to mitch in the first place
we met at work and
he was charming
and mysterious
he wined and dined me
and took me traveling
and
he told me it was me and him
against the world
he made me feel important
hello
my name is
robert montague renfield
and just like
all these decent folks
i am in
a destructive relationship
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
that was a lot
maybe we should just back up
to the beginning
mr renfield i bid you welcome
i am
dracula
when i met him
i was a real estate lawyer
hoping to make a deal
that would change my life
and my familys lives forever
oh and it most certainly did
you will make a very good
assistant mr renfield
i understand how caitlyn feels
i never drink wine
he also wined and dined me
he made me feel important
he introduced me
into high society
we went to the theater
we traveled to exotic places
and then he made me
his familiar
which means that i take care
of masters every need
including staff changes
and arranging his special
dietary requirements
look i didnt just jump into
serving the prince of darkness
we had some great times
but just like all great times
servant
they come to an end
the hunters have returned
ah yes
the bugs this comes up a lot
draculas powers come from
consuming human life
mine come from eating bugs
make sense great
now where were we
im coming master
shit fuck shit
shit fuck shit fuck
shshshshit
this is a protection circle
renfield
mm
he cannot escape
let us rid this world
of his evil
and you can finally be free
free
the moment im gone
they will lock you away
for what youve done for me
i am your only salvation
i am your only friend
i am the only one
who cares for you
i actually remember thinking
he really really means it
this time
renfield
we are the last of our kind
from now on every drop of blood
dracula spills
will be on your hands
fuck i was not expecting that
or that
master you okay
no
yeah
this is a fairly typical result
at the peak of his powers
dracula goes on
a fulltilt
bloodsucking bender
the good guys show up
and do their thing
and then its up to me
to clean up the mess
its what
i call our transitional period
so i take him to a new city
nurse him back to full power
find a decent place
to ride it out
until the whole cycle starts
all over again
uh excuse me hhi
may i borrow a pen please
thank you
which brings us back here
in the meantime i come here
and listen to these poor souls
talk about their monsters
you were just talking
about mitch what
i know this is like
way down the list of bad stuff
but hes also really into ska
the kind of music
yes
fishbone mustard plug
voodoo glow skulls
i fucking hate that shit
im so sorry caitlyn im so
mark i am im so sorry
its okay
is that the one
thats 99 horns
yeah see
thats what i was thinking
no
thats a huge oversimplification
of skas innovative contribution
to music
oh my god who am i
renfield
hmm
sorry no i swallowed a bug
unintentionally
whatwhat other way
is there to
would you like
to share your story
no thankthank you
i dont think youd understand
i know its scary
and you think things
are never gonna change
but i promise you
one day youre gonna realize
that you can have
the life that you want
but in the meantime i just hope
that you get something
out of coming here
i am
thats great
oh yes im getting something
out of coming here victims
but not these victims
lets do our affirmations
i am enough and i have enough
i deserve happiness
i am grateful for all that i am
and i take full charge
of my life today
they can repeat these
affirmations all they want
itll never make
their problems go away
but i can
now no ones ever gonna
call me a hero
but ive come up with
a mutually beneficial solution
for people like caitlyn
get rid of their monsters
by giving mine what he needs

the kind of place
no one tends to notice
a convalescing monster
master

unsuspecting tourists
a handful of nuns aa
a busload of cheerleaders

is a dangerous place
maybe if we were just
a little bit more careful
we could you know
stop running
you know settle down
and i could have
we could have a life again
it must be difficult
to be caught between
their rules and mine
their rules offer
a confusing tangle of morality
whereas mine are very simple
you can kill and eat
whatever you want and never die
and it truly is a gift
and yet you seem to think
it makes you
some sort of a monster
do you have any idea
how inconsiderate that is
im sorry im sorry
my needs are the only thing
that matters servant
and what exactly are my needs
um your needs your needs
were the uh

do you think its too late
to grab one of those nuns
what did we talk about
yesterday
uum
ive been up all day
thinking about it
oh whats this
ah my plan
your plan
but your plan has always been
to just drink blood
exactly
what have i been doing
all these years
i mean look at me
lurking in the shadows and filth
like some kind
of a diseased animal
you said it yourself
i deserve better
so why am i not embracing
what i truly am
which is
a god renfield
an immortal insatiable
whoo allpowerful being
everything you said about
the modern world is true
it is a dangerous place
hmm
only not for us
for them its a dangerous
sad broken place
full of fear and desperation
its weak
longing for a powerful force
to guide it
control it dominate it
like you
hmm
i mean this entire society
was designed by renfields
for renfields
so why should i
have to adapt to it
it should have to adapt to me
i owe it all to you servant
oh no
i think you actually might have
read between the lines
a little bit there
indeed
were in this together
dracula and renfield
from now on humanity
will no longer be divided
by the good and the evil
only by followers
and food
you and i forever
until the end of time
bloody hell
how is my life
my life is like a
neverending hallway
of fun house mirrors but
all the clowns are me
uh hey everyone
i need your help
are you okay
no
i need to get out
of a toxic relationship
okay well well well well
take a seat and let her rip
okay thanks
okay yeah fuck carol i guess
its
i hate her too
why dont you start
by telling us
what brought you here
in the first place
i was on the job
uh for my boss
uh well and i was
actually following bob
because i thought
that bob would make
a very good um uh
friend
yes thank you bob
thank you renfield
and then you know
i started to hear
all of your stories and
i mean they were all so sad
thats us
and you know
for the first time in years
i felt like i wasnt alone
you realized youre a codependent
mmhmm
i need to change i can see
that ii need to change
and uh i want to but my boss
hes pretty delusional i think
uh he thinks
he can take over the world
hes a narcissist renfield
we all know exactly
how you feel
yes
exactly
no hes different
you cant get him out of your head
no
ooh and you feel like
he could kill you
with the snap of his fingers
yes wouldnt even need to snap
oh
he controls rats with his mind
uh
its okay its okay
hes on medication
renfield this is
codependency 101
a narcissist will take
full advantage
of a codependents
low selfesteem
but youre the one
with the real power
and all you got to do
is take it back
how do i do that
focus on your needs
i mean i just havent
thought about
any of my needs in years
but if you were to stop focusing
on his needs what would happen
if i dont
yeah what would happen
stop focusing on his needs
what would happen
he wont grow to full power
exactly
he wont grow to full power
what thats so weird
why would you phrase it
like that
but yes hes right
hes absolutely right
he wont grow to full power
you can take all that energy
youve spent on him
and put it toward yourself
and then you will be the one
who grows to full power
yes
full power
me grow
iim gonna grow to full power
i want to hear you say it
say im gonna grow
to full power
iiim gonna grow
to full power
i heard you say it
but i didnt believe you
nope
let me hear you say it again
im gonna grow to full power
yes
i see a smile there
because you like it
now say it like
the world needs to hear it
im gonna grow to full power

ooh and update
that wardrobe to this century

you would think
that attacking a police officer
in front of a bunch of witnesses
at a restaurant would be enough
to put teddy lobo behind bars
you guys dont think i know
whats going on here huh
i dont know
how many of you assholes
are on the lobos payroll
but theres only so much
evidence you can tamper with
and so many witnesses
you can intimidate
all right because eventually
someone brave enough
is going to step forward
and theyre going to help me
take down the lobos
and all of you motherfuckers
permanently permanently
mr renfield
robert montague renfield
yes at your service
you look different

how appreciative i am
that youre here uh
because without you
i think id be a bit lost
no
you stood up for everyone
whos ever lived in fear
of the powerful forces
shaping their lives
okay and you need
to keep doing that
because when
people like you stop
standing up to people like them
thats when
the monsters take over
so
you are not lost
youre an inspiration
thank you mr renfield

who took out everyone
in the restaurant

the five fucking families

the nsas eye in the sky

using all these other cameras
throughout the city

to whatever you want
yeah and then we enhance
we got a trace on him
boom

now we can track his every move
his last known location
is at the old charity hospital
you have until the end of the
day to find him and kill him
give me ten minutes
ill take the end of the day
can you run the dna on this pen
through the bureaus database
and interpol
i cant trust this with anyone
who works in my department
this pen was found
near a location
where these three guys
went missing
teddy lobo was fleeing
from the same location
when i arrested him
huh
word on the street is
these are the three guys
who allegedly stole drugs
from the lobos
right
and the dna evidence on this pen
just might connect teddy lobo
to that crime scene
maybe its a long shot
but i got to try
look i know ii havent
handled anything well
since dad um
but i really need your help
can you run this pen

caught me at a low moment

i use my power
for a lot of things
but i didnt need
to use it on you
you were a lawyer
who wanted to get rich
off a real estate deal
youre the one who used me
you used my power
because youre a husk
an empty void
that nothing can fill
the only thing that gave your
life any meaning was my power
the power you used
to bring me victims
while you pretended
to be one yourself
however
im the real victim here
im the one
you swore to protect
and you
abandoned me
no
thats not true
just like you abandoned
your wife and your daughter
thats not i didnt
i didnt abandon them
look into your own eyes
renfield
youre the monster renfield
not me
its you
no no
thats enough thats enough
what
i will no longer tolerate abuse
stop laughing
i deserve love
i deserve happiness
you deserve only suffering
um oh i know being undead
its a painful existence
it is and i empathize
with your pain
oh please illuminate me
let me learn from you
i will find everyone
you have ever loved
and i will drain them
i will reduce this this
sstudio apartment
studio apartment
until its ash
uh uh
affirmations affirmations
uh im enough and um
i deserve some happiness
there is some other stuff
that i have to say
who put these ideas
in your head
of course
what
shit

the morning i left
for draculas castle
you had a family
i did
um it was a a long time ago
a really long time ago
yeah im older than i look

to make some big deal
with a count
would give us
the life we deserved
or um
what i thought i deserved
i let them down in so many ways
you know
thats his greatest power
he looks into your eyes
and finds
what you think you need
to make your life whole
your your dreams
and your desires
and your greed
your shame
i blamed him for forcing me
to abandon my family
but that thats not true
i
i wanted all those things
and i chose to follow him
im not a victim im
i made all those mistakes
on my own
look i dont think
youre such a bad guy
life throws
a lot of shit at you
but sometimes
you fall under the thrall
of a vampire for a few decades
and sometimes you call
your sister an unbearable twat
at grandmas birthday party
you should make things right
with your sister while you can
hmm
speaking of
im gonna call her
renfield its so wonderful
that you have finally
found someone
who does inspire you
to grow as a person
hey where are you
i have found some people
who will unleash my potential
as well
they understand this world
for what it is
and what it needs
hello rebecca
looking for someone
wheres my sister
i offered you so much rebecca
but you put your faith
in such fragile institutions
instead of something
far more enduring
weve got your sister
she doesnt have much time
rebecca where are you going
to get my sister
rebecca you dont understand
its not just the lobos its
dracula is with them
fine ill go myself
look please
i tried to stand up to him
and he killed people
i cared about
i cant let that happen again
you want to be a hero renfield
you have to risk everything
and as someone
that cares about you
youre never really gonna
be free until you face him
you care about me
is that what it takes
to get you in the car
all right
if were gonna do this
we need to prepare and
we need to do it before sunset
im ready to do it before lunch
okay
lets face it
they know were coming
so lets go in style
yeah just guns wont be enough
im gonna need bugs
lots of bugs
wooden stakes
uh crucifixes
and uh
maybe a protection circle
what the fuck is
a protection circle
its a circle
made of powder that
itit traps demons
if you say the right
uh latin stuff
forget it
na nanana nanana
nana nana
na nanana nanana
oh once its dark
itll be too late
can you maybe
save that for later
oh sorry

na nanana nanana
id rather go to hell
pull this pin

uh
no matter what happens
in there ju
make sure you save your sister
must be nice
not needing to be invited in
wait a second wait a second
dont i know you
because you look so
familiar
afternoon officer
shit im out
you think i need guns
to fuck you up
lets do this what the fuck
fuck
you shouldve taken my offer
when you had the chance
now the only choice
youre gonna get
is which one of your limbs
im gonna tear off first
go
no
oh this must drive you crazy
him choosing me over you
i dont really have
strong feelings about it
im clearly the yin
to your yang
weve barely met twice
you patronizing piece of shit
oh my goodness
you almost scared me
wheres my sister
oh that
one moment please
i need to set the mood first
hello rebecca
dont worry
i wont hurt you
its nice to finally meet you
i can only imagine what
you might have heard about me
from poor renfield
besides making him bring you
people to eat
well we did have
a complicated relationship
however when i saw you
through his eyes
i knew i had
to make things right
having dracula powers
is fucking amazing
stop saying dracula powers
fine what do you call it
its a curse
god youre such
a fucking drama queen
would you please listen
they come with a cost okay
youll become his slave
see thats where youre wrong
because master told me
shit
mmhmm
for half a millennium
ive seen only weakness
in the hearts of men
and then i looked into yours
renfield used only
the smallest taste of my power
to do what he thought was good
imagine what i could do
rebecca with you by my side
we could bring
the justice you seek
to those whove escaped it
for too long
and i can heal your sister
my blood will bring her back
no
say the word rebecca
and i will undo
what the lobos have done
all i ask in exchange
is for you
to join me
no dont listen to him
he said the same shit to me
can you save her
yes
what did he call you again
an empty fucking husk
see that that is why
dracula and i work
so well together
im a full husk
full of everything youre not
strength power loyalty
her time is running out
oh join me
dont
i told you
this is what he does
so what
i lost my dad
i cant lose my sister
and if he can give her
back to me
i dont care
if i lose myself
you were wrong about him
hes not a monster
he wants to be better like you
maybe i can help
in all the darkness
i can find the light
shit
that was impressive
i can see what renfield saw
in you
now hell see it go into me
congratulations
you shot my foot
your foot still bleeds
die
no oh no
you cant take my teeth
you see there will always
be people like you
there are far more renfields
in this world
than there are rebeccas
hes right
there are millions
of people like me
i am enough
and theyre all
trying to figure out
how to overcome
their destructive relationships
always remember youre the one
with the real power
millions of codependent people
i am the dark poetry
in the hearts of all mankind
millions of people
just like me
all you got to do
is take it back
do you know what you are
yes i do
im robert
montague renfield
and im a codependent
youre right you didnt
have to use your power
to make me your servant
because i gave
all my power to you
and i can take it back
i am enough
and i have enough
and i am capable of change
because i love myself
im taking
full charge of my life today
look into my eyes dracula
full power motherfucker
holy shit it worked
is that a protection circle
i got the instructions
off a wiccan tumblr
oh andand that
cocaine
really
yeah
i guess any kind of powder works
as long as you say
the right magic words
wow
thank you wiccan tumblr
so um what do we do now
i wake up each morning
with your sweet kiss
on my mind
the early morning sun
shining through
any last wishes
i wish to spend
a season in hell
where all
the amusing people are
hail satan
i see your face in every
yes i know this looks extreme
and maybe a little fun
but to our defense
there is so much
folklore out there about
how to actually kill a vampire
it gets confusing
you know ive personally
seen him come back
from some crazy shit
so why not try everything
you know im not even
100 sure this will kill him
but i do know it will take him
a long long time
to come back from
youre my yesterday
tomorrow and today
you were right
success is the best revenge
touché ma chérie
au revoir bitch
hey you okay
renfield said
you guys gave me some
dracula blood
oh no no
its a euphemism for uh
its an its an
like an herbal remedy
okay so do you think
they carry it at gnc
yeah yeah i ththink so
i love you kate
so
theres only one thing
left to do
you know
ive got to pay
for what ive done
i dont want you to go somewhere
just to punish yourself
you belong out in the world
people have a lot to learn
from a person like you
like what
its never too late
to be a hero
hmm
i was lost
in a world of darkness
for a very long time
but with all of your help
i um
i found a way out
without you i would never
have learned that
i could save myself
and thank you
for using dracula blood
to bring us all back to life
you know if it
if it wasnt for you
uh none of us
would have learned
what its like
to come back
from the other side
having seen things
that you cant unsee
and know things
that you cant unknow
okay
fantastic meeting today guys
truly
i hope hes okay
hell be all right
hmm
my name is
robert montague renfield
and im a codependent
but i no longer feel
like a victim
because ive finally
faced my demons
you might also say
i chopped my demons up
into tiny little pieces
encased them in concrete
and flushed them down the drain
and if i can find the power
to do that
then maybe everyone can
metaphorically speaking
im free to do what i want
any old time
i said im free
to do what i want
any old time
i say love me hold me
love me hold me
cause im free
i say love me
love me forever
hold me
and love will never die
love me hold me
cause im free
