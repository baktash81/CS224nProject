in a fifth floor walkup in chinatown 
it s always been just the two of us 
me and libby 
but every year on my birthday
i d make a wish 
make a wish  baby 
that someone else could be there too 
and every year when he didn  t come   
   i d ask my mom to tell me
the same story 
you never get tired of this one 
do you  okay 
once upon a time   
    there was a young 
very cool singer named libby   
    who one day decided to go out
and see the world 
little did she know that in the deserts
of morocco fate was waiting for her   
   and his name was henry 
they fell madly  passionately 
hopelessly in love   
   and were married
by the chief of a bedouin tribe 
henry brought her to england to meet
his family so they could get married for real 
but fate was not so kind this time 
she was definitely not
what they were expecting 
but when henry s father suddenly died   
   libby knew there  d be more pressure
on him to lead a certain kind of life   
   because he was now lord dashwood   
   and libby was no one  s idea of a lady 
henry knows all about it 
if you love him  you will go now 
i think you should see this 
apparently there s someone else 
so even though it broke her heart 
she knew she had to leave him 
but a few months later  fate
gave her the greatest gift of all 
a beautiful baby girl named daphne 
sweet dreams  kiddo 
 love you 
 love you 
i can   t believe you   re 1 5 years old today 
sweet dreams  henry 
on my 1 7th birthday 
mom and i had to work 
but it turned out to be
where my story really began 
you delivering something 
yeah  about three hours
of watered down rock and roll   
   and one very late waitress 
sorry 
watch your head 
are you related 
 can i park it 
 yeah  over there 
how could he do this to me 
it  s our wedding day  where is he 
what  i should know 
20 minutes and she s lost him already 
very funny 
hey  how you doing 
i m sorry  can i borrow this  thanks 
thanks 
sorry about this

daphne 
 noelle

and taylor before i go to duke  pre law 
 what s up next for you

 no  where are you going to college 
 the university of the undecided 
is that in ohio 
yeah

well  i guess i better be going 
but say hey to jenkins  and taylor 
 but  
 lf everyone would clear the dance floor   
   the bride and her father
would like to share a special dance 
 i know  i saw the look 
 i don t want to talk about it 
every time we do these weddings  mom 
i see the father daughter dances 
i just  
i can t help but think that
l m never gonna get to do that 
i know you think you re doing the
right thing by keeping me from him  
i was trying to protect you
from getting hurt the same way i was 
you left him  remember 
it s not like he jumped on a plane
and came after me 
maybe he would have
if he knew i existed 
 lt s not that simple 
 why can t you understand  mom 
i feel like half of me is missing 
and without the other half  how am
i supposed to know who i really am 
daph 
getting to know someone because
they share the same dna isn t the answer 
it s about getting to know yourself 
come on  let s go steal some leftovers 
lasagna looks great 
i love you a million swedish fish 
i love you a million red m m s 
taxi 
 where to  miss 
 jfk  virgin atlantic 
no problem 
maybe the answer was taking
a year or two off before college   
   to find out what i m supposed
to do with my life 
but deep down 
i think i ve always known   
    what i really need more than anything
else in the world is to find him   
    to find my dad 
mom  you always said it was up to me
to write the rest of my story   
   but you  ve been writing it for me 
mom

we better take this slowly 
lord henry dashwood announced today   
   he was giving up his hereditary seat
in the house of lords   
    to run for election as a commoner 
why should an accident of birth give me
the right to make decisions for people 
 the only power i want   
 my dad 
   is the power the voters choose to give
me  that s why i m standing in this election 
thank you 
lord dashwood  who will marry his fiancée
glynnis payne this summer   
    will also inherit a stepdaughter 
the lovely clarissa payne 
but this surprising announcement has sent
shock waves through westminster 
he now appears to be
an unstoppable political force 
i admit  when you first suggested
giving up your seat in the house of lords   
    i began to question your sanity 
but  no  this is political dynamite 
i had an eccentric idea we might
actually be doing the right thing 
it s possible to do the right thing
and still be a winner 
the latest poll puts the party six points
ahead  that s all due to you  henry 
you re transforming the image
of the party your father loved 
he would have been so proud of you 
you re young  thrusting  idealistic   
   an impeccable reputation    
and a fabulous fiancée
with all the right connections 
sorry to interrupt  but if i don t steal him
he ll miss his speech at the oxfam ball 
 oh  blast it  my speech 
 right hand pocket  darling 
she thinks of everything 
well  gentlemen  that seems to be all 
thank you 
you two enjoy yourselves 
how s our boy doing 
if he doesn t ruffle too many feathers 
he ll be the next prime minister 
excellent 
ian  i don t know if i can do this anymore 
daphne  he s your father 
you ve flown halfway around the world
to see him  you can t turn back now 
he s got a family now  i mean    
you saw them  they re so elegant
and sophisticated  it s like    
what would he want with me 
 yeah  well  you got a point there 
 shut up 
it s just not as simple as i thought 
maybe i should just go home
and let him get on with his life 
can i help you  miss 
actually  no 
thanks 
perfect  absolutely wonderful 
thank you so much  ciao 
you haven t forgotten lady wrightwood s
this afternoon  have you 
she is sponsoring us for the royal enclosure
at ascot  we have to be there 
i thought marrying henry
meant we didn t have to try so hard 
i m not getting married for five weeks 
until then we have
to keep up appearances 
look what happened to olivia dixon
when she went to china 
 who s olivia dixon 
 exactly 
 did you see that 
 what 
an impossibly large bird
falling off that wall 
are you hallucinating 
these eggs are positively glacial 
when i run this house  senile servants
will be the first thing to go 
you d have to get around the old bat 
she d never allow it 
anyone seen my pruning shears 
the old bat seems to have forgotten
where she put them 
morning  morning  mother 
morning  darling 
everyone sleep well 
apparently not 
there s someone at the window 
i m not hallucinating 
it s those bloody paparazzi again 
percy  call the police 
i will not tolerate this media circus 
 where do you think you re going 
 lt s you 
how long do you people have to spy
before realizing there s no story 
 you ve got the wrong idea 
 tell it to the authorities 
the real scandal is how young
they re starting you guttersnipes now 
you sit down and tell me who sent you 
the sun  the daily star 
good heavens  you can t be
more than 1 7 
go on  take your picture and go away 
 i already have a picture of you 
 what  s going on 
 where the devil did you get this 
 from libby 
 that singer you met on a camel 
 why would libby give this to you 
she thought l d want to know
what my father looked like 
my name is daphne reynolds 
i m libby s daughter 
according to this   
   i m your daughter too 
oh  for heaven s sake 
seems you had an even better time
in morocco than you let on 
oh  dear god 
i haven t  
no  this is impossible 
 must be a mistake 
 exactly  a mistake 
this doesn t prove anything 
this libby must have written down
the first man she could think of 
you re the only man she s ever thought of 
can i have a word with you in private
for a moment  please 
henry 
you re not going to believe her  are you 
maybe l    
maybe i shouldn t have come 
this is a big shock for you 
i m freaking out
and l ve known since i was 2 
don t get me wrong  i mean in a good way 
i ve dreamt about this my whole life 
not that exact entrance  of course 
i imagined something more graceful 
i can see now
that it was probably a mistake 
i shouldn t have come 
sorry  did you just say you ve known
about this your whole life 
 yeah 
 good  now we ve got that settled   
   how about some tea
and a piece of fruitcake 
your mother didn t feel i deserved
the same consideration 
 no to the fruitcake  then 
 how could she keep this from me  
what happened to the mistake theory
we were operating on a moment ago 
no  wait a minute  ducky 
henry  i know this has come as a shock 
but we can t just let the girl go 
 not until we ve got to the bottom of this 
 shall i call a hotel  madam 
and tell them what  exactly 
the best known candidate in a generation
is requesting a room for a teenage girl 
 the press will have a field day 
 can we leave the press out of this 
 no  glynnis is absolutely right 
 thank god someone else is thinking straight 
the girl must stay here  with us 
darling  before we let this hypothetical
daughter blow your political career   
    we might consider checking up on her 
 for what 
criminal record  blood type 
triple sixes on her scalp 
glynnis  she has a birth certificate 
she has my photograph and she has my eyes 
only thinking of what s best for you 
i know you don t like thinking about it 
but the press can be brutal 
  exclusive  henry dashwood
in love child shocker  
actually  she s not strictly a love child 
her mother and i were married 
i mean  not technically 
it was a bedouin ceremony in morocco 
we planned to make it official
as soon as we got back   
    but for some reason libby decided to    
well  anyway  she left 
 taking something of yours with her 
 put a cork in it 
maybe someone should have put
a cork in it 1 7 years ago 
well  here we are 
will it do 
are you kidding  it s incredible 
it s bigger than our entire apartment   
   and the restaurant downstairs  it makes
the white house look like a mcdonald s 
i get the point  now  why don t
i send percy to fetch your things 
 thank you so much  lady dashwood 
 no hugs  dear 
i m british  we only show affection
to dogs and horses 
right 
you rock 
hello 
 libby 
 henry 
 ls she there  is she all right 
 yeah  she s here 
she s fine  mother is force feeding her
fruitcake as we speak 
how could you not tell me
l d fathered a child 
you let her show up
1 7 years later  unannounced  
and what 
put a dent in your political career 
 no  that s not  
 lf you re afraid of a scandal  send her back 
it s not about scandal  it s finding out
i had a daughter for half my life 
libby 
i didn t want her to get hurt 
 what is that supposed to mean 
 ask your advisors 
they ve gotten you this far  haven   t they 
my point is that henry s strength has
been that he s completely scandal free   
   unlike his opponent 
this could ruin everything 
have you finished stating the obvious 
good  then let me explain
what we re going to do 
we give the papers the story 
but we spin it our way 
let s see what we have 
yes  the royal dress show 
introduce her as the daughter you ve always
known  but rarely were able to be with 
the press still gets a story 
but it s cut off at the knees 
we are dealing with a living 
breathing 1 7 year old girl 
the only thing we know is
that she s an american teenager 
hardly a promising start 
still  what do you think  henry 
liability or asset 
well  l ve only spent a few moments
with her myself   
   but my sense is that
she s quite mature for her age 
she seems well mannered 
 thanks  percy 
 your lunch  miss daphne 
i d say rather self contained  soft spoken 
perfect  let s run with it 
ah  me  please be armistead 
 dashwood residence  clarissa speaking 
 this is lan wallace  is daphne there 
she s not here 
there s no one here by that name  actually 
sorry 
if you do happen to see her  could you
tell her lan wallace is trying to find her 
absolutely  i will 
not 
 daphne 
 mr  dashwood 
 lord dashwood 
 call me henry 
henry  okay 
 this is a cool room 
 listen  l    
i was just wondering if    
i was wondering if     well  i don t know
if this would interest you  actually   
   but i was hoping you might accompany
me to the royal dress show on friday 
 dress show 
 yes  it s ass numbingly dull 
some people i have to impress
take it frightfully seriously 
is it like a fashion show 
gwyneth and madonna go to those things 
right  do you think they d be there 
i have no idea what you re talking about 
but for me it s a stop on the campaign trail 
for glynnis  it s a chance
to launch clarissa on society 
launch  you make her sound like a ship 
no  in clarissa s case it s more like
an intercontinental ballistic missile 
she s what in the old days
might have been called a debutante 
well  i don t know  i just    
 could you bear it 
 could i bear it  i mean that d be    
 that d be cool 
 really 
well  good  that s settled  then 
that s good 
good 
i forgot  i brought this for you 
it s some pictures of me growing up 
 that s    
 i thought you might want to have it 
thank you very much 
thank you 
that s splendid  thank you 
okay 
daphne  could i get your advice
on something 
sure 
i can t decide which one to wear
to the show tomorrow   
    and i was wondering what you thought 
 ls that a gucci tartan mini  that s so cute 
 you can go that funky to the show 
 daphne  that s the whole point 
turn up in a sensible dress and pearls   
   and you might as well wear
a sign saying   spot the plonker  
i m glad you told me 
wouldn t want to be a plonker 
what are stepsisters for 
 this is really cute 
 good  i ll wear that  then 
 see you later 
 bye 
i m here to see daphne reynolds

 no  but she s a friend of mine 
 you don t get in without an appointment

the girl is positively barbaric 
i hope she doesn t embarrass me
in front of armistead 
we still have the arrival
of henry s illegitimate daughter 
you needn t worry  henry assured me
she will be the soul of discretion 
 ls this the way to the show

how i nearly wiped out
the entire royal family 
i think they enjoyed it  it s the first time
princess charlotte s taken a shine to anyone 
and no one will go near that dog since
it ate one of lord barret s testicles 
 tragic 
 the real tragedy is  he s still reproducing 
coco pops  interesting choice 
 i had you down as an all bran man 
 these are strictly contraband 
glynnis makes me eat that
other gravel every morning 
 do you like coco pops 
 dude  it  s chocolate  need i say more 
did you mean what you said
about me staying for the summer 
yes  yes  i did 
so does that mean l m gonna
be launched on society 
i suppose we ought to arrange
some sort of coming out party for you 
coming out party  coming out as what 
 as a young woman 
 what are you trying to say  henry 
i just   i mean as a young woman
of a certain   
   social standing and eligibility 
eligibility  for what 
well  for men  
i mean  for male suitors to    
 i   m not explaining this very well  am l 
 no  but i   m having fun watching you try 
yes  well  perhaps we ought to leave
the party arrangements to you 
it s not my kind of thing 
but l ll think about it 
thanks  henry 
i was just wondering
whether your mother ever    
 no  no  she never got married 
 no  but obviously there d be    
there d be somebody  you know    
well  off to bed  i suppose 
i hope you find your sleeping arrangements
conducive to a good night s  
henry   sweet dreams  is all it takes

it s utterly ravishing 
excellent  thank you  i m counting on
you girls to give daphne some pointers 
bye  now 
oh  very you  lovely

so henry asked us to give you
some pointers  didn t he 
well  pointer number one  go home

and stop trying to be my daddy s
little girl  because l m not going anywhere 
bye 
pull 
don t listen to that silly twit clarissa 
she s just threatened by you  that s all 
pull 
 why would she be threatened 
 her mother is about to marry my son   
   and gain a title
and all that goes with it 
for years  alistair tried to elevate his
position through my husband s career 
now he s got his claws into henry 
people like alistair and glynnis 
social standing is everything 
pull 
it s silly  but they live by it 
and i lived by it too  once 
till i saw what a toll it took
on the people who i love most 
believe me  there ll be plenty
of people rooting for you to fail 
that s what makes it such fun 
 bring it on 
 pull 
oh  dear  is that how
the west was won 
lord henry dashwood  miss glynnis
payne  miss clarissa payne

 the daughters of lord orwood 
 have you noticed the chandelier 
chairman of my constituency party 
the real love of his life
is that chandelier 
don t let him catch you looking at it 
you ll start his boring story
about how napoleon   
   gave it to josephine
at the battle of borodino 
the story is longer than the battle 
excuse me  i wonder if i might request
a dance from your gorgeous daughter 
i m sure she d be delighted 
thank you  armistead 
i can t believe that little imposter
is going to ruin my summer 
she may be a lot of things  but
i can t believe imposter is one 
technically  she s 39th
in line to the throne 
really  fiona  38 people would have
to die for her to be queen 
well  it s far less than
the 72 you d need 
women are just drawn to me 
it s something i happen to be blessed with 
an indefinable quality that just
relaxes them  fascinates them 
 you re feeling it  aren t you  dabney 
 lt s daphne 
and let me guess  you re feeling it
in my backside 
ian 
ladies and gentlemen  we re gonna take
a short break  see you in 1 0 
warning   colonial strumpet alert 
hi  l m daphne reynolds 
peach and pear  isn t it 
 are those your real names 
 yes 
pumpkin and gourd would have
been much more appropriate 
 our mother was obsessed with fruit 
 and vegetables 
 we have a sister called parsnip 
 she doesn   t get out much 
let  s bail  this party  s a total bore 
don t listen to her  the party s hopping 
excuse me for a second 
she is so nice 
 henry  old chap 
 what a wonderful evening 
i   m glad you   re enjoying yourself  i don   t
know if you ve noticed the chandelier 
actually  it s a rather fascinating story 
 looking for me 
 oh  no  i was just looking for the loo 
outside  on the terrace 
all right  so you caught me 
so let me guess  you ll disappear again
without so much as a glass slipper 
this cinderella s got a dad now 
she s not going anywhere 
 your song was really beautiful 
 thanks 
it s not gonna liven up this party 
though  poor girls  i feel sorry for them 
a dud like this will send them
back to social siberia 
what do you say we liven things up
a little bit  get the party started 
well  first of all  i could get fired 
 and second of all  i could get fired 
 come on 
 no

 lnsufferable deprivation of this house

 l m most dreadfully sorry  miss 
 you idiot

i m really sorry about last night 
i was just trying to help them out 
where did you find that revolting song 
james brown  1 976 
charted out at number 1 4

no more repeats of last night 
okay  well  i just chose you to help

so tell me  obi wan  where did
you learn your impressive skills 
well  if you really want to know 
believe it or not   
    my mother was a deb 
 really 
yeah  and then she chose
to marry beneath her 
her parents promptly disowned her 
but for some reason they took pity
on me  their half breed grandson 
they paid for me to go to the right schools 
they got me into all the right clubs 
until one day i realized
the hypocrisy of it all 
and your parents 
they re poor as church mice
and they re the happiest people i know 
now  enough stalling  get up there
and let me see you perform 
all right  all right 
okay  find your center 
good  that s it 
okay  now 
you know what i still don t get 
why are you trying so hard to fit in
when you re born to stand out 
 hello 
 five hours ago your daughter   
   rode off on a motorcycle
and hasn   t been heard from since 
 are we talking about a date 
 i don  t know  but i dread to think 
the boy s in some sort of band 
really  cool  let me guess 
he  s a drummer 
 this is serious 
 as i recall   
    i spent a great deal of time
on the back of your motorbike 
yeah  well  i think
that s rather different 
strange how easy it comes  isn t it 
 what 
 worrying 
 does it ever go away 
 no  henry  it doesn t 
henry  henry 
libby  l m sorry  l m gonna have to run 
darling  this really is important  i ve just
had a conversation with a bedouin translator 
apparently there are certain drums
which indicate an actual marriage   
   whereas others they just use
merely for mating rituals 
 have i just entered a parallel universe 
 don   t you see what this means 
it s possible that you and libby
never had a real wedding 
so there s nothing to interfere
with our plans  is there 
isn t that good news  henry  henry 
here we go 
hang on a second 
 hello  sir 
 lan  i had no idea you were so versatile 
henry  come along  lots to do 
the assembled press are waiting 
hi 
 hey  what are you doing here 
 another one of my glamorous jobs 
 you look beautiful 
 thanks 
 i have to be on my best behavior 
 you better be 
 there  s more reporters here than usual 
 they  re waiting to see what i   ll do next 
oh  yeah  you mean like kissing a guy
who parks cars 
daphne  the press   
    want a photo of you and your father 
 thanks  i ll find him 
see you 
stay away from her  peasant 
she s out of your league 
what s the matter  thought our competition
ended in lower school 
afraid she might prefer musicians
to cambridge boys 
no  breeding always
wins out in the end 
is miss reynolds enjoying
her time in london 
 very much 
 lord dashwood  how s the campaign 
miss reynolds  tell us
about the chandelier 
maybe that s enough 
thank you  no more now 
 do you think he s terribly rich 
 i imagine so 
 i hope so 
 peach 
pear  you look   
    different 
 lt s daphne 
 she gave us some styling tips 
 why would you want tips from her 
lovely 
 charming here 
 lsn t it just 
the race is that way 
aren t you supposed
to be escorting clarissa 
what  and leave you
to fend for yourself 
or are you suffering
from the romantic delusion   
   that some non talent commoner
will do it for you 
you know  i really wish you   d pull
your lip over your head and swallow it 
despite myself  i find your yankee
vulgarity intensely attractive 
so forget about the car parking 
mixed race mongrel   
   and give me that kiss you   ve been
longing to give me since we first met 
you   re right 
i have been longing to do this 
henry  do something 
you should have hit him 
don t you ever pucker your lips
at me  you arrogant jerk 
and how dare you insult lan  
he s twice the man you ll ever be 
 henry  henry 
 out of the way  get out of the way 
what was the argument about 
 give me the keys to your bike  quick 
 here you go 
what s going on 
you do know how to drive  
look out 
oh  sorry 
that is without doubt the most
indecorous thing i have done in years 
well  i have no idea
what you re talking about  but l m glad 
you should do it more often 
i don t even remember
the last time i went barefoot 
don t you just love squidging
your toes in the sand 
did you know it s a natural exfoliant 
mom says if you can walk on a beach and
you got a steady hand with nail polish   
   there s no reason to ever pay
for a pedicure 
 you talk just like her  you know 
 as in too much 
is she happy 
yeah  i think so  i mean  i can tell
she gets lonely sometimes   
   but i think she s pretty content
with who she is 
 i like that about her 
 i wish i were more like that 
so  what next 
 no 
 yes 
 no  no  absolutely not 
 lt s this or that 
i think we ll do this one 
how re you doing 
henry 
that doesn t sound pleasant 
 what do you think 
 lt s just henna 
 what s this 
 i told you how groovy i was 
 yeah 
 and i used to like people like this guy 
oh  look  this stuff is good 
i ve been looking for coo coo ow 
strange  funky sounds 
i remember them    doris  
 come on  henry 
 l m not gonna head bang 
 you just bang your head

 lord dashwood 
 lord dashwood 
you ve dropped 1 5 points in the polls 
 are you worried 
 i really can t comment 
if you can t handle your own child 
how can you handle the government 
 frank  good to see you 
 could you answer  please 
 how much time do we have 
 plenty 
your first two clients
were no shows and   
   you got out of your speech
at the children   s education center 
 why would we have canceled that speech 
 we didn t  they did 
daphne  can i have a word 
this is brigadier sir roderick dashwood 
he lost an eye at the battle of the boyne 
and over here we have field marshal
bingley dashwood 
he lost his arm
at the battle of the nile 
and uncle alfred never spoke about what
he lost  but you d rarely find him sitting 
i lost my tonsils 
does that mean i qualify 
listen  daphne 
part of the burden of being a member
of this family is that there are certain   
   codes of behavior
that one is expected to observe 
and if one is not seen
to conform  then    
well  then it becomes    
listen  i   ve very much enjoyed
our time together 
really and truly  it  s just that this    
these are very difficult circumstances   
   and you  as my daughter 
have to

made a bit of a mess of things 
haven   t l 
a bit 
henry  for six centuries this family
has been sacrificing bits of itself for england 
arms  legs  eyes  the battlefields of europe
are littered with them 
don t follow in that glorious tradition 
you know what you re going
to sacrifice 
your heart  henry 
sir charles 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you 
well  over the last few weeks 
l ve certainly   
   received more support and encouragement
from this constituency   
   than i   d ever dared hoped for  so i   d like
to take this opportunity to thank you all 
you may have noticed that recently there
have been one or two remarks in the press 
regarding my behavior 
it s been suggested l ve not been conducting
myself in a manner befitting an mp 
well  l ve been giving my priorities
a great deal of thought   
   and l ve decided that it s time
to get them straight 
which is why i must now respectfully
withdraw my candidacy 
representing you would undoubtedly
be the greatest honor of my political life 
it would simply be impossible to do so
if l m not serving my own conscience 
see   
   i ve changed 
and as important
as my political aspirations are to me   
   there is one thing
that matters more 
thank you 
are you out of your mind 
i have done everything
to get you to this position   
   and i will not let you
throw it all away 
you ve lied to me 
i know you lied to libby   
   so forgive me if i don t give
a flying fart what you think 
libby  i stopped you
from ruining your life 
i saved your family s reputation 
when i found out that girl was pregnant 
i knew i was doing the right thing 
 you knew about daphne 
 of course i knew  it s my job to know 
 grandpa  are you okay 
 oh  god 
 this is horrible 
 do shut up 
henry  darling  i know daddy s been naughty 
but what about me 
you ll survive 
hey  table six is screaming for coffee 
what re you doing  anyway 
sorry  it s my college applications 
due on monday 
okay  l ll cover for you 
 thank you 
 good luck 
ladies and gentlemen  the bride
would like to share a dance with her father 
i love you  dad 
 what are you doing here 
 i just came because l    
i had something very important
to say to you   
   and i hope i can     actually 
i wrote it all down on the plane about    
about 200 times  as you    
it was on a    
i have it    
what it comes down to is    
is that i love you  daphne 
i love you 
i   m so sorry 
i wouldn   t change you  anything about you 
i wouldn   t change one hair on your head 
 not for anything  
 i love you  dad  i love you 
might l    
might i have the honor of this dance 
listen  daphne  l    
i just think when you re groveling
it s important to bring a very large present 
 i don t understand 
 may i cut in 
of course 
i tried to call you    
you never did want me to go 
did you 
there never was anyone else 
was there 
i d say i owe you
a rather large apology 
you think l ve waited 1 7 years
for an apology 
so i finally got my father daughter dance 
of course  it got interrupted
when my boyfriend showed up 
and then my parents started making out 
but sometimes things aren  t exactly
how you always imagined 
they re even better 
oh  just in case you were wondering
what happened to clarissa and glynnis   
   don  t worry 
they ended up exactly as they should 
  the rustication  then it gets smoother  
 big ben 
 so did alistair 
i can see the smiles 
for those of you who speak english   
   it  s not the name of a large hamburger
at a fast food restaurant 
this is the closest he got
to parliament 
my parents got married again 
this time  it was legal 
i think 
as for me  i didn  t end up at nyu 
but before you get too disappointed
