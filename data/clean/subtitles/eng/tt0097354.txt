things shambles
truly believe men
willing abandon lucrative
law practices take presidents case
salary year

fathers fight
survive major factor
unfolding watergate drama
press scrutinizing actions
beneath magnifying glass
one white house press aides asked
president using drugs seeing psychiatrist
whether still believed prayer
drinking rumors persistent
perhaps seemed drinking
little ever
dinnertime trying unwind
still adhered selfimposed code
alcohol nights attending receptions
dinners drink day
rumors presidents behavior
distress rife press room
even one story wearing makeup
disguise illness
know sir house judiciary committee
issued subpoena additional
tape recordings
view white house give
appearance cooperation
