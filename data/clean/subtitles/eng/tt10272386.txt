  where  where did you leave it 
  hmm 
i don t know

i can manage
very well on my own 
 grunts softly

 door closes 
 whistling 
 tv turns on  sports announcer
speaking indistinctly 
 remote clicking 
channels changing 
you found it  then 
  what 
  your watch 
oh  yes 
so you realize angela
had nothing to do with it 
only because i hid it 
luckily  just in time 
otherwise i d be sitting here 
talking to you

what time it was 
it s five o clock 
if you re interested 
myself  i am interested 
pardon me for breathing 
 chuckles

have you heard from her 
i m asking you
a question 
um   
i m going to have to move 
dad 
i m going
to have to leave london 
really  why 
we talked about this 
do you remember 
ah  is that why you re so keen
on this nurse living with me

the rats are leaving the ship 
i won t be here 
i won t be able
to come here every day

dad

very important to me 
otherwise i wouldn t be going 
i    i really love him 
 sighs 
and i can come back

i  um

my father is quite upset
by the whole idea   
  that s okay 
  yeah  so it can cause him to   
uh  i think he s quite
annoyed with me  heh 
i m just telling you this
because  uh  he is capable
of reacting unexpectedly 
has he lived on his own
up till now 
yes  uh  yeah  he was in a flat
not far from here  which worked 
and i was able to pop in on him
practically every day 
but we ve had to come
to another arrangement 
  it just wasn t viable anymore 
  i understand 
um  and he s had several carers 
one after another 
um  he finds it difficult
to get on with them 
he has his ways  heh 
   chuckles softly 
  uh  so that s why i moved him
in here with me 
but i m finding it quite
difficult to manage on my own 
it s a bit much
 cause i have to work 
and that s why
i need someone to help me 
 footsteps approaching 
  did i hear the bell 
  dad  yes 
  ding dong 
   anne chuckles

  are you sure 
i have a distinct impression
that i ve seen you before 
so laura has come round 
uh  to meet us
so she can get
an idea of how you live
and to what extent
she might be able to help you 
i know  dear 
i know that 
you ve already told me
a hundred times 
my daughter has  um   
a tendency
to repeat herself 
but you know what it s like 
it s an age thing 
   laughs 
  would you like a drink

but no  thanks 
an aperitif  are you sure

  boom  splendid 
two small whiskies coming up 
anne  please 
it s okay  anne  i m not
going to offer you a drink 
she never touches alcohol 
not a drop 
  it s true 
  never  not a drop  yeah 
um  that s why
she seems so  uh   
  so what 
  um  sober 
her mother was 
uh  the same 
the soberest woman
i ve ever met 
 anthony   laura laugh 
oh  dear  heh heh 
silly  um  whereas
her little sister
  was quite a different story 
  oh  you have two daughters 
even though i hardly ever hear
from the other one 
all the same 
she was always my favorite 
she was a painter 
look  there you are 
the pirouette 
beautiful  isn t it 
yes  it is 
anthony 
yes 
a dazzling girl 
i don t understand why
she never gets in touch  never 
   glasses clink 
  your whiskey 
  thank you 
  cheers 
 groans  chuckles 
 sucks teeth 
mmm  ah 
i d give everything i own
for a glass of whiskey 
don t you agree 
well  i don t own
all that much  so   
oh  really  what do you do
for a living 
um  i look after
other people 
other people 
mm  yeah  my job is to
help people who need help 
heh  oh 
sounds like those girls you re
always trying to dump off on me 
must be a difficult job
though  isn t it 
spending all day
with one of those   
ugh  i couldn t stand it 
am i right 
 both laughing 
what about you 
what did you do for a living 
oh  i was a dancer 
  were you 
  yes 
  dad 
  what 
  you were an engineer 
  what do you know about it 
yes  tap dancing
was my specialty 
  really 
  you seem surprised 
  a little bit 
  why 
don t you believe me  or you
find that difficult to imagine 
of course  it s just   
i ve always loved tap dancing 
you  really  i m still
great at it  i ll show you 
 snapping fingers 
   laughing 
  ay  ha ha 
jolly good 
why are you laughing 
nothing 
sorry  sorry 
i know   
i know who she reminds me of 
  who 
  it s lucy 
  lucy  when she was younger 
  lucy 
yeah  my other daughter 
that s right 
there is a resemblance 
don t you think 
  yeah  maybe 
  yes 
   laughing 
  yes 
her unbearable habit
of laughing inanely 
i had you there  didn t i 
 anthony laughs 
you see  the situation
is very simple 
i have lived in this flat   
for some time now 
i m extremely
attached to it 
and i bought it
more than 30 years ago 
can you imagine 
you weren t even born 
yes  it s a big flat 
very nice  it s very big 
and  uh  i ve been
very happy here 
uh  anyway  my daughter
is very interested in it 
anne 
what are you talking about 
you see  my daughter
is of the opinion
that i cannot manage
on my own 
so she s moved in with me 
ostensibly to help me 
with this man she met not
long ago just after her divorce 
yeah  who has
a very bad influence on her 
  i have to tell you 
  what are you talking about  dad 
so now she would like
to convince me
that i really cannot
manage on my own 
and  uh  the next stage
will be to send me away 
i don t know where  it ll be
a much more efficient way
of getting hold of my flat 
but  um  it s not
going to happen that way 
 anthony chuckles 
sorry  dear 
i may as well tell you now 
i m not leaving
this flat any time soon 
i m going to outlive you 
both of you 
i don t know about you   
but my daughter  yes 
 chuckles 
in fact  i m gonna
make a point about it 
i m going to inherit from her 
not the other way around 
and  uh  the day of her funeral 
i shall give a little speech 
uh  to remind everyone
how heartless
and  uh  manipulative she was 
  i m so sorry about this 
  why  she understands perfectly 
you re the one who doesn t 
see  i ve been trying
to convince her for months
that i can manage
very well on my own 
but    she refuses to listen 
i don t need
any help from anyone 
and i m not
going to leave my flat 
all i want is for everyone
to fuck off 
having said that   
it s been a great pleasure 
au revoir  toodle oo 
i m really
very sorry about this 
you weren t kidding
when you said he had his ways 
i m really sorry 
don t be  that sort
of reaction s quite normal 
it ll be all right 
do you think 
yeah 
 sighs 
 water turns on  off 
 sniffles 
 sobs 
 sniffling 
paul 
well 
what 
  did it go well 
  um   
yeah 
i think so  she said
she was gonna start tomorrow 
  here 
  yeah 
good 
yeah  so we ll see
how the first day goes  and   
i was really worried
it wasn t gonna work 
but in the end 
it was fine 
  he was charming 
  oh  there you are  you see 
yeah  he really
turned the charm on for her 
you should have seen him 
he told her he d been
a dancer  a tap dancer 
  no 
  yeah 
i don t know
how to describe it to you 
i think she s really
going to be able to   
i think they re really
gonna get on well together 
and then he said
that she reminded him of lucy 
really 
how old is she 
why  you interested 
what s the matter with you 
if it went well 
that s good news  isn t it 
yes  yeah 
so 
what s the matter with you 
tell me 
it s just   
what 
just now  when i came back
with the chicken 
he didn t recognize me 
i don t know 
it just did something to me 
i understand 
finding it really hard 
come  give me a hug 
i saw it in his eyes 
he didn t know who i was 
it was like
i was a stranger to him
