uh i think hes quite
annoyed with me heh
im just telling you this
because uh he is capable
of reacting unexpectedly
has he lived on his own
up till now
yes uh yeah he was in a flat
not far from here which worked
and i was able to pop in on him
practically every day
but weve had to come
to another arrangement
it just wasnt viable anymore
i understand
um and hes had several carers
one after another
um he finds it difficult
to get on with them
he has his ways heh
chuckles softly
uh so thats why i moved him
in here with me
but im finding it quite
difficult to manage on my own
its a bit much
cause i have to work
and thats why
i need someone to help me
footsteps approaching

she might be able to help you
i know dear

a tendency
to repeat herself

always trying to dump off on me
must be a difficult job
though isnt it
spending all day
with one of those
ugh i couldnt stand it
am i right
both laughing
what about you
what did you do for a living
oh i was a dancer
were you
yes
dad
what
you were an engineer
what do you know about it
yes tap dancing
was my specialty
really
you seem surprised
a little bit
why
dont you believe me or you
find that difficult to imagine
of course its just
ive always loved tap dancing
you really im still
great at it ill show you
snapping fingers
laughing
ay haha
jolly good
why are you laughing
nothing
sorry sorry
i know
i know who she reminds me of
who
its lucy
lucy when she was younger
lucy
yeah my other daughter
thats right
there is a resemblance
dont you think
yeah maybe
yes
laughing
yes
her unbearable habit
of laughing inanely
i had you there didnt i
anthony laughs
you see the situation
is very simple
i have lived in this flat
for some time now
im extremely
attached to it
and i bought it
more than 30 years ago
can you imagine
you werent even born
yes its a big flat
very nice its very big
and uh ive been
very happy here
uh anyway my daughter
is very interested in it
anne
what are you talking about
you see my daughter
is of the opinion
that i cannot manage
on my own
so shes moved in with me
ostensibly to help me
with this man she met not
long ago just after her divorce
yeah who has
a very bad influence on her
i have to tell you
what are you talking about dad
so now she would like
to convince me
that i really cannot
manage on my own
and uh the next stage
will be to send me away
i dont know where itll be
a much more efficient way
of getting hold of my flat
but um its not
going to happen that way
anthony chuckles
sorry dear
i may as well tell you now
im not leaving
this flat any time soon
im going to outlive you
both of you
i dont know about you
but my daughter yes
chuckles
in fact im gonna
make a point about it
im going to inherit from her
not the other way around
and uh the day of her funeral
i shall give a little speech
uh to remind everyone
how heartless
and uh manipulative she was
im so sorry about this
why she understands perfectly
youre the one who doesnt
see ive been trying
to convince her for months
that i can manage
very well on my own
but she refuses to listen
i dont need
any help from anyone
and im not
going to leave my flat
all i want is for everyone
to fuck off
having said that
its been a great pleasure
au revoir toodleoo
im really
very sorry about this
you werent kidding
when you said he had his ways
im really sorry
dont be that sort
of reactions quite normal
itll be all right
do you think
yeah
sighs
water turns on off
sniffles
sobs
sniffling
paul
well
what
did it go well
um
yeah
i think so she said
she was gonna start tomorrow
here
yeah
good
yeah so well see
how the first day goes and
i was really worried
it wasnt gonna work
but in the end
it was fine
he was charming
oh there you are you see
yeah he really
turned the charm on for her
you should have seen him
he told her hed been
a dancer a tap dancer
no
yeah
i dont know
how to describe it to you
i think shes really
going to be able to
i think theyre really
gonna get on well together
and then he said
that she reminded him of lucy
really
how old is she
why you interested
whats the matter with you
if it went well
thats good news isnt it
yes yeah
so
whats the matter with you
tell me
its just
what
just now when i came back

he didnt recognize me
i dont know
it just did something to me
i understand
finding it really hard
come give me a hug
