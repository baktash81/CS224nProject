  an8 not that i ve seen
it  you understand 
but it s a whodunit 
you ve seen one 
you ve seen  em all 
you know the drill 
an interminable prologue in which
all the key players are introduced 
you get a sense of the
world they inhabit   
and then the most unlikable
character gets bumped off 
there s been a murder 
cue the entrance of a
world weary detective   
who comes in and
pokes his nose around 
talks to witnesses  takes
a couple of wrong turns 
and then gathers all the
suspects in the drawing room   
and points the finger at the least likely
chump because of the way the guy   
i don t know   
ties his shoelaces 
now you ve seen our play 
you re an accomplice to murder 
and so  we ask
you to remember   
that it is very much
in your interests   
not to tell a soul
outside of this theater   
who done it 
but what do i know 
the limeys  they just lap it up 
the play s a smash hit 
not to mention a cash cow 
right there is the milkmaid
in chief  petula spencer 
this lavish affair is a party to
celebrate the 100th performance 
no wonder film producer john woolf wants to
turn the play into a major motion picture 
here he is now in the arms of
his slightly paranoid wife 
i sense that death
is close at hand 
it s probably just a draft 
this is where i come in 
leo kopernick s the name 
big shot hollywood director 
hired to make the film adaptation
marginally less boring than the play 
easier said than done when the
writer s a giant pompous ass 
mervyn cocker norris 
i say  you re rather tall 
am i  haven t really thought
about it  to be honest 
is that what happened here 
sort of  i had a bit of
an accident backstage 
sure  he s educated and he
knows a lot of  10 words   
but it s like he s never
seen a film before   
let alone try to write one 
no one important 
you know  at times you do rather
overdo the temperamental neapolitan 
that s a nice jacket 
say  why don t you scare me up
a real drink  will you  kid 
like a pint of rye or bourbon   
or motor oil  if you have to 
yeah  hop to it  now 
in england  that actually
counts as good service 
i was stationed here
during the war   
and  if anything  the locals
are more uptight now   
than when they had the
luftwaffe overhead 
mervyn 
shouldn t you be home  i
thought we had a deadline 
i thought so too 
but then our esteemed director
tore up the screenplay   
and told me to start
all over again 
he s of the opinion that a modern
audience will walk out in protest   
if they re not served at
least one violent death   
in the opening frames 
suffice to say  we are no
longer on speaking terms 
merv 
london s most sensitive writer 
how is the mousetrap  huh 
did they catch the
guy who did it 
i will not stand
here and be insulted 
well  i guess he s gonna go
over there and be insulted 
what passes for
glamour in these parts 
sheila sim and
dickie attenborough 
kid likes the sound
of his own voice 
even money  he makes a speech 
i suppose i ought
to say a few words 
not too many 
  when have i ever 
  our wedding  remember 
  we almost missed the honeymoon 
  yes 
darlings  you re ever so kind 
i d like to ask you all to
raise a metaphorical bat   
to the old pavilion 
the mousetrap is 100  not out 
  cheers 
  cheers 
i tell you what
else is 100 not out 
petula s mother 
the old kook s just
crazy about seafood 
they just brought out
more langoustines 
excuse me  i just need
to deal with that 
  mother  please  you ve had quite enough 
  hi 
now  i m not one to tell
tales out of school   
but the girls over here  they go
wild for an american accent   
and the promise of
a pair of nylons 
but the husbands   
right  i think it s time
someone taught you a lesson 
they re not so easily won over 
it s only fair to warn you that
i learned to box in the raf 
yeah  well  i learned to fly
a plane in gleason s gym 
all of which explains   
in an admittedly
roundabout fashion   
how i come to be in the theater s backstage
area in need of a change of clothes 
hello 
hello 
aw  jeez 
i guess i should have
seen this coming 
it s always the most unlikable
character who gets bumped off 
it s a whodunit 
you ve seen one 
you ve seen  em all 
we re closed 
clear off 
honestly 
oh  i m so sorry  sir 
inspector stoppard  sir 
sorry  i was under strict
instructions not to let anyone in 
just open the door 
yes  sir  of course  sorry 
i didn t recognize you  sir 
i ve actually just been
transferred myself 
thought it was leeke and
priestley on rotation tonight 
careful  sir 
in you come 
  constable 
  stalker  sir 
god  you re all
wet through  sir 
hope you don t catch
a cold after that 
yep  after you  sir 
victim s name is leo kopernick 
sir  the film director 
suspected communist 
blacklisted in hollywood   
so he came out here to work
on a picture for john woolf 
you know john woolf 
the film producer 
he made the african queen
with humphrey bogart 
 nature  mr  allnut  is what we are
put in this world to rise above  
that didn t sound
anything like bogart 
no  that was katharine hepburn  sir 
she s in it too  wonderful actress 
i go to the pictures
quite a lot  actually 
it s the escape  i suppose 
  the romance of the silver screen 
  yes  thank you  constable 
yes  sir 
signs of a struggle 
actually  sir  i believe that
happened when mrs  boyle was killed 
mrs  boyle  who s   
yes  sir  she s that woman
in the front row there 
well  she seems to
have bounced back 
sorry  sir  no  she was killed
in the play  also strangled 
not that i ve seen it 
although i would like to 
it s an agatha christie 
and i do like a good murder 
yes  thank you  constable 
yes  sir 
a ski did that  sir 
they use it in the
play  apparently 
as i said  i haven t seen it 
and then the large dent in the
cranium is a sewing machine 
seems he was killed in the
costume store initially   
and then he was deposited here 
staged  so to speak 
sorry  sir 
yeah  that s the ski that
he took in the face  sir 
and i m afraid it was
downhill from there 
sorry  sir  that one
just came out on its own 
seems he came down here
for a change of clothes 
why 
it was a party to celebrate
the 100th performance  sir 
the other nought must have   
when the victim upset the sponge 
and he then proceeded to sit in
the assortment of crustaceans 
i m told he was
intoxicated  sir  as a newt 
this was actually a lot more
fun than i thought it would be 
then he left  no one saw him again
until the body was discovered 
that s correct  sir 
perhaps they were all
in on it together  sir 
looks like the killer tried to
pull out the victim s tongue 
why would anyone do
a thing like that 
excuse me  chief inspector 
it s just  inspector  
yes  of course  inspector 
i hate to interrupt  i do 
there really is nothing worse   
petula spencer  sir 
prominent theater impresario 
yes  thank you  constable 
tell me  how much longer do you
intend to keep us all hostage here 
or is that the idea   let
the galled jade wince  
gather all the suspects
under one roof   
and then interrogate each of us in
turn until the mystery is solved 
mervyn cocker norris 
overrated playwright 
celebrated playwright 
oh  i m so sorry  sir  i
can t read me own handwriting 
not that we are
suspects  necessarily 
are we suspects 
it was just a reference to agatha christie
and her penchant for denouement   
in which the detective
gathers the   
i dare say  that s not   
  please continue 
  yes  thank you  mervyn 
inspector  i want you to know that i
have nothing but the utmost respect   
for the metropolitan police 
but  well  do you think you
might be finished in time   
  for curtain up tomorrow night 
  oh  for goodness  sake 
john woolf  esteemed
film producer 
yes  thank you  constable 
this is a murder investigation 
surely that takes precedence   
sold out or not 
yes  it s all going to plan
for you  isn t it  woolfie 
you want the run to end 
i want nothing of the sort 
it s the decent thing to do  that s all 
close the theater out of respect for leo 
such a tragic loss 
inspector  i implore
you not to overreact 
i would hate to have to
go over your head and   
talk directly to your superiors 
we wouldn t want that 
now would we  madam 
but i m afraid that under the
circumstances  as a precaution   
precaution 
he s already dead 
he is  madam 
but until we have an idea
as to a likely motive   
who s to say this
is the end of it 
what is that supposed to mean 
we are no longer
merely suspects 
we are also potential victims 
oh  god  i wasn t in that 
was i  i must look dreadful 
excuse me  sir 
stoppard 
my office 
hello  sir 
what in god s name possessed you
to close down the ambassadors 
protocol  sir 
it s a crime scene 
no  it s a public relations
disaster  is what it is 
public what  sir 
  stalker 
  sir 
not to put too
fine a point on   
  yes  please 
  here 
not to put too fine a
point on it  inspector   
but your latest blunder
is front page news 
  an8 fleet street is all over this 
like hot jam on a devonshire scone 
you are slap bang
in the crosshairs 
  an8 now  we need to do
everything we can   
  an8 to make sure the bullet
doesn t miss you and hit me 
  yeah  of course  sir  yes 
  good 
then you ll inform
the theater at once 
well  i thought as
a precaution  i   
the home secretary is a close 
personal friend of agatha christie 
his brother in law
is rex harrison 
  wonderful actor 
  yes  thank you  constable 
sir 
it s actually worked in our favor to
have the press distracted like this 
it means we can keep a lid on
the rillington place murders 
rillington place murders 
yes  what s that 
blimey 
haven t you heard  we have a
serial killer on the loose 
you didn t think all of this
was for you  now  did you 
  no  of course   
  no 
of course not 
well  have all the resources been
allocated to this other investigation 
no  not all of them  no 
i understand you met
wpc stalker last night 
i did  yes 
  constable 
  inspector 
a very capable officer 
or at least she will be once
she gets the proper instruction 
sorry  sir  i m not sure i   
you don t mean you want me to   
yes  i do 
i d like you to
show her the ropes 
i m hoping some of her enthusiasm
for police work might rub off on you 
but the bullet 
sir  is that why   
this is not a debate  stoppard 
i have a reputation as a modernizer 
i have to be seen to keep it up 
i have said in public   
that i think women are
the future of the force 
absolutely  sir  i agree 
  but we re not looking for stolen sweets   
  sweets 
or a lost bleeding bicycle 
this is a murder
investigation   
and she is inexperienced 
they were inexperienced
in the war 
ask jerry how that turned out 
yes  sir  but   
  that will be all 
  thank you 
  commissioner 
  inspector 
constable 
inspector 
  commissioner 
  constable 
sorry again about
last night  sir 
  with the rain and everything   
  water under the bridge  constable 
no harm done 
you all right 
yeah  do we have an
address for the victim 
yep  it is  laurel
canyon  hollywood  usa  
where was he staying
in england  constable 
right 
if i am honest  monsieur kopernick 
he was not a very good guest 
in arrears  was he 
non  but he did not
pay for his room 
monsieur woolf did 
what part of france
are you from  sir 
belgium 
ah  right 
oh  my  my 
what a bloody pigsty 
they don t clean the
rooms at the savoy 
hélas  not this one 
the maids  they refuse 
we offer them more money 
but still they say non 
there was an incident 
always avec monsieur
kopernick   
there was an incident 
thank you  constable 
sorry  sir 
did one of these incidents
ever turn violent 
oui  une fois 
how dare you call
me a bad writer 
i didn t say that  i
said it s bad writing 
i did the best i could within
the confines of the genre   
and woolf loved it 
woolf wouldn t know a good script if
it came up and bit him on the ass 
  it s horseshit 
  no  it isn t  not all of it 
all right  what i
read is horseshit 
you mean you didn t
even finish it 
i read enough  pal  to know that nobody
gets killed in the first 10 pages 
you charlatan  give it back 
  listen  listen to me  listen 
  give   
we need to go in a completely
different direction 
i ll kill you for this 
kopernick  you bastard 
that s that then  sir  it s
as good as a confession 
let s not jump to
conclusions  constable 
no  sir 
the least we can do is
talk to this other party 
yes  sir  cocker norris  sir 
tell me  do you write everything
down in that little notebook 
only if it s important  sir 
how do you know
if it s important 
well  i ll just sort
of put everything in   
as we go  and then down the line
when we know what s important   
we ll know that it s
already in the notebook 
so you do write everything down 
yeah  everything 
that s what i thought 
make yourself comfortable  you re
just in time for elevenses 
you must excuse the désordre   
it s research for
the film adaptation 
police statements  court
reports  newspaper cuttings 
the mousetrap is actually
based on a real life case 
nettle tea 
i appreciate you ve not yet
had time to come to terms   
with the death of
mr  kopernick  but   
is it true his tongue
was pulled out 
i m afraid i can t divulge details
of an ongoing investigation 
it was disgusting 
what 
that s gio  nephew of
mine  very hotheaded 
i wonder if it
isn t all the fumes 
you know  from the chemicals 
he s an amateur taxidermist 
he has a fascination
with the macabre 
i call it his
stymphalian bird series 
macabre in a strictly
 ornithological  sense  that is 
you wanted to ask me about leo 
we heard there was an
argument at the savoy   
and i noticed you had
the other half of this 
inspector  that was a
contretemps  nothing more 
read that part  yeah 
 i ll kill you for this 
kopernick  you bastard  
well  obviously  i   
taken out of context  i   
those words were spoken in anger
and under extreme provocation 
we had creative
differences  that s all 
how did you like the mousetrap 
oh  yeah  the play 
yeah  i didn t see it yet 
  well  if you d like  i can précis this   
  no  no  no 
i got the basics  it s
a whodunit  right 
so  you got a dead
body  a detective   
and then all the suspects
rather conveniently   
end up in a remote
country house together 
in a nutshell 
our task will be to present this
improbable series of events   
to an audience of
moderate intelligence   
in a manner that does not
cause too much offense 
easy 
flashbacks 
no 
no what 
no flashbacks 
they are crass  lazy  and they
interrupt the flow of the story 
in my opinion  they are the last
refuge of a moribund imagination 
whatever next  a caption that
says   three weeks later  
merv  merv  will you come on 
this is crazy  will
you open the door 
i m not coming out
until woolf gets here 
what is it this time 
i ll tell you what it is 
i pitched a new ending   
cockamamie novice over here
locks himself in the bathroom 
is this instead
of the car chase 
as well as  i think he thinks
 denouement  is french for  shootout  
will you at least hear me out first 
and then tell me you don t like it 
come on  i storyboarded it
for you  come on  have a seat 
why can t we just have the detective
gather everyone in the drawing room   
and then reveal to
them who did it 
why   cause it s
old  it s tired 
it s been done a thousand times 
so then who explains to the
audience what on earth s going on 
no one 
i don t know  the killer 
now you see what i
have to put up with 
will you please have a seat 
so  a remote country house 
we got all the suspects gathered
in the drawing room  right 
so far  soporific 
suddenly  the lights go out 
our hero grips his colt
special  edges into the hall 
the killer s got a hostage 
can t get a clear shot 
suddenly  kaboom 
the place goes up in flames 
blam  blam 
our hero plugs the killer 
one in the gut 
one in the knee 
  an8 then  all of a sudden   
  an8 his goddamned gun jams 
he s a sittin  duck 
sorry  not that one 
i m sorry about this 
he s a sittin  duck 
our killer  dying
but not dead   
takes aim 
boom  he fires 
out of nowhere   
our hero cop s partner
dives in slow motion 
takes a bullet 
our hero cradles his partner
like a father would his child 
his face a gumbo of emotions 
we hold on the inferno   
and we pan left 
to a dead butler 
hank williams plays us out 
 i saw the light  
you hate it 
no  no  i don t hate it 
but you don t love it 
of course he doesn t 
it s preposterous   
and totally out of keeping
with the rest of the film 
oh  who cares 
the audience only ever
remembers the last 20 minutes 
oh  poppycock 
hitchcock  actually 
how does he get the gun 
he s a cop 
police are not armed in england 
what  how do they
kill the bad guys 
they don t  they ask them to
stop in the name of the law 
well  he fought in the war  so
he kept his service revolver 
god damn it  we re gonna have
to pick this up another time 
say  merv 
you wouldn t want to lend
me this pad  would you 
just for the night 
only i got this dame parked
outside i wanna impress 
as in  she actually is a dame 
and  well  you know 
my place ain t
exactly the savoy 
i thought his place
exactly was the savoy 
no  he didn t take up residence
there till a month later 
and the production company
footed the bill when he did 
how he finagled that 
i ll never know 
either i need a new agent 
or he had dirt on woolf 
did you ever meet these women 
who were they 
girls he met during the war
who had low standards   
and even lower self esteem 
i never had the pleasure 
oh  wait 
tell a lie 
merv  come on 
when i said we should tear up the
script  i didn t mean literally 
hello  leo 
what is that doing here 
he was kopernick s son 
peas in a pod 
and the mother 
i didn t get a good look  a
plain girl  rather homely 
dark hair  glasses   
thick lenses 
so there we have it 
sir  cherchez la femme 
what 
it s belgian  sir  it
means   look for the woman  
i know what it means 
constable  what woman 
the mother of kopernick s
illegitimate son 
cocker norris couldn t remember her name 
but i bet it s in that little black book 
you know  the one that you
found in the hotel room  sir 
if we find her  we
have our answer 
we need to get a police sketch
artist down here at once   
before he forgets anything 
i m doing it again 
aren t i  sir 
  jumping to conclusions 
  conclusions  yeah  little bit 
sorry 
constable 
i have a very important
mission for you 
i need you to find
a telephone box 
call the station 
get an address for john
woolf  the film producer 
and i ll wait for you here 
 romulus films  soho  
sir  i wrote it down 
  you did 
  mm hmm 
right 
well done  thank you 
shall we 
telegram came for you 
bad news 
it s the studio 
grace kelly s doing a
hitchcock picture for warner   
so it s dial m for
maybe next time 
  grace kelly 
  yes 
for the part you
promised sheila 
yes  that s right 
which is why this
is such good news 
ann 
darling  what s the matter 
you do know a promise is only
a promise if you keep it 
what do you mean 
i mean you promised me
a night out months ago 
i have been so busy lately 
yes  i know  i am
your assistant 
i promise  as soon as i
have a moment to spare   
well  you re free on wednesday 
  am i  are you sure 
  yes 
  i thought i was   
  no 
no  well  you should know 
you are my assistant  after all 
well  that s settled 
then  it s a date 
i promise i will take you out 
i m afraid  mr  woolf  you
really must be going now   
otherwise you ll be late 
right  thank you 
no  i m serious  you do actually
need to get back to romulus 
  right  okay  yes 
  yes 
this is exciting  isn t it  sir 
i d say this is the
type of thing   
that made you want to become
a police officer  was it 
me  i just sort of
fell into it  really 
they needed people after the war 
and i needed the money  so   
no  it s true  the hours
can be unsociable   
but i can t type or stand
the sight of blood   
so that ruled out
secretary for me 
you don t mind if i pick
your brains  do you  sir 
only i have sergeants 
exams in a month   
and i just have one or two questions
that i d love to run by you 
actually  constable  i ve just
remembered that i have a   
dentist appointment 
sorry  sir  i didn t
know you were suffering 
just a routine checkup 
  what shall i do  sir 
  wait here 
but what if woolf turns up  sir 
won t be long  and
you have your   
notebook 
keep your eyes peeled 
yes  sir 
  gin 
  gin 
yeah  please 
you re joking 
oh  no 
oh  god 
follow this up with
another  please 
there you are  constable 
i ve been looking
all over for you 
so  i gather it was you   
that paid for mr  kopernick s
rather extravagant hotel suite 
nothing unusual in
that  inspector 
i m afraid a producer is expected
to indulge the whims of the talent 
especially when
they re american 
but still  a pretty penny 
a room at the savoy 
par for the course 
when i was in the congo   
for the african queen   
huston and bogart refused
to drink the water 
insisted on bourbon   
even to brush their teeth 
not so easy to get hold of in
the jungle  i can assure you 
you know  constable stalker here
is a great admirer of that film 
aren t you  constable 
it s a marvelous film  sir 
why  thank you  constable 
encyclopedia 
cinematic encyclopedia up there 
  i wouldn t say that 
  yeah 
right 
being humble 
i m not 
so  it s not true that
kopernick had dirt on you 
who told you that 
well  now what do we have here 
woolfie 
sittin  in a quiet corner 
all very nice and intimate 
say  you wouldn t mind if
i joined you  would you 
not at all  old boy 
and you must be mrs  woolf  huh 
swell to make your acquaintance 
no  no  leo  this is ann 
she s my assistant 
workin  late  huh 
if you ll excuse me   
i m sorry 
you have a nice night  now 
well  now 
this puts me in a tough spot 
that i m afraid i m gonna
have to take advantage of 
he asked to be put up at
the savoy  and i agreed 
i knew it wouldn t be for long 
that is  just until i found
the right moment to   
tell my wife 
i see  well   
we ll be in touch if
there s anything else 
constable 
shall we 
but  sir  woolf killed kopernick
to hush up the affair  case closed 
i think if that was the case  he wouldn t
have volunteered the information 
so  then he s in the clear 
no  not necessarily 
he might have killed kopernick
for another reason entirely 
i tell you   
i ll never get the hang of this
in time for sergeants  exams 
constable  about earlier 
i know it looked like i d
just come out of the pub 
you had just come
out of the pub 
that s right 
but i d only gone in there to get
rid of the taste of the mouthwash 
so you had a gin  sir 
it s an antiseptic 
i had a filling 
i thought you said it
was a routine checkup 
i see we ve read the chapter
on interrogation techniques 
sir   
i know i haven t done
anything yet to impress you   
or to inspire any
confidence  and   
i know you d probably rather
that i wasn t on the case 
but i didn t ask to be put
on this case either  sir 
i was nervous  and i still am   
and i m probably
trying a bit too hard 
but  you know  even if
i do make mistakes   
or if i jump to conclusions   
or talk a little bit too
much  that has been said   
i just want you to know
that you can trust me 
sir 
okay  good 
you re joking 
  constable 
  commissioner 
stoppard about 
no  sir  he s not yet
made it in this morning 
it s almost eleven o clock 
he had a dentist
appointment  sir 
a filling  i think he said it
was  a molar  it might have been 
i have been summoned
to the home secretary 
he wants a debrief 
i said i had good news 
have you seen the play  sir 
yes 
i m afraid i took the
wife for her birthday 
of course  it didn t fool me for a
moment  i knew who did it right away

a filling as well

i didn t get a very good
look  if i m honest 
he had on  like  a
darkish overcoat 
i see  anything else 
a pair of trousers 
and a hat 
it was on his head

average height   
medium build 
would you say like
the inspector 
yeah

so what did he do that
made you suspicious 
it wasn t so much what he did

well  sort of   
suspiciously 
this has been great 
off you go 
  thank you 
  thank you 
thank you 
that was good 
do you think that went well 
i think it s time we talk to that
actor who had a fight with kopernick 
mr  attenborough  sir 
that s the one  famous  is he 
you re pulling my leg  sir 
you ve never heard of dickie 
richard attenborough  pinkie brown 
brighton rock  you must have 
 you wanted a recording of
my voice  well  here it is 
 what you want me to
say is  i love you   
keep in mind   
that we re here to conduct an interview
as part of a murder investigation   
not an article for sight
  sound magazine  yes 
yes  sir 
come in  darling 
inspector stoppard 
i say  a real life detective 
scotland yard and everything 
and you are 
this is   
  constable stalker 
  stalker 
i like the way you did that 
very natural 
i hope you don t mind  sir 
but i just want to say bravo 
and encore 
all right  thank you  constable 
yes  thank you  constable 
are you a lover of theater  i
can get you tickets if you like 
i would like  sir 
yes  very much 
it would be good to get a
professional take on it 
yeah  i have so many questions 
i have one or two of my own 
i dare say that you do 
i understand that you and kopernick
came to blows the night in question 
was there a particular
reason for the ill feeling 
tell me  inspector  did you
get your limp during the war 
it s very slight 
i noticed it the other night
when you were on stage  i   
well  i thought i might
borrow it  if you don t mind 
it s always good for the lead
character to have a physical defect 
speaks to a troubled soul 
it was me  inspector 
you need look no further 
  i arrest you for the murder of leo   
  no  no  no 
no  not yet 
sorry  sir 
i was the particular
reason for the ill feeling 
yes  well  leo had his eye on sheila 
you see  and i took exception 
he was a real hound  inspector 
come on  play nice 
maybe i can help you 
help me 
to do what 
bag the lead role in the
film of the mousetrap 
top billing 
make you a star 
but i have bagged the lead role 
yeah  who told
you that  woolfie 
he is the producer 
honey  he just cuts the checks 
i m the director 
without me  there is no
movie  you understand 
you got a problem  buddy 
keep the change  and the glass 
and the studio  don t
they have a say in it 
rumor is they want to put
a name in the picture   
that people have heard of 
bona fide hollywood star 
they like grace kelly 
you ever heard of her 
don t worry 
they can be talked round 
i ve got a very silver tongue 
i won t lie  inspector 
i was not entirely sorry to learn of
his demise  but i had no part in it 
much like the film adaptation
of the mousetrap  it would seem 
come now  darling 
you don t know that 
woolf promised you the role 
he s a man of his
word  he went to eton 
wake up  dickie 
he s a man of whatever word
will get his film made 
and that contract business with
choo is coming apart at the seams 
  choo 
  bless you  sir 
no  as in petula spencer 
she sold woolf the film rights 
well  about those tickets  is
there a day that suits you better 
i m generally free on
tuesdays and wednesdays 
and thursdays 
well  thank you  sir 
thank you  madam 
no  no  not at all  we ll
be sure to let you know   
if anything else
springs to mind 
i m sure it s always the
insignificant detail   
that catches the killer in the
end  isn t that so  inspector 
i don t usually have a
lot on on weekends either 
or mondays  for the tickets 
  constable 
  sir 
right 
she ll see you now 
so  you own this theater 
yes  humble beginnings 
you ll have to excuse mother 
she s not been herself since father
died  in the first great war 
it s been a long 30 years 
it s nice that you
gave her a job 
well  how else is she
gonna pay the rent 
i let her have the spare
room at a discount as it is 
yes  no  you can stop there 
we get the idea  bravo 
i understand that you handled the sale of
the mousetrap film rights to john woolf 
yes  that s right 
i did  wait    why 
what s he been saying 
oh  he s such a crybaby 
honestly  he acts as though
i put a gun to his head 
hang on a minute 
is this important 
i doubt it  what does it say 
 no motion picture based on
the stage play the mousetrap   
 is to enter into production until a
minimum of six months have elapsed   
 since the end of its
first theatrical run  
oh  you don t need
to worry about that 
it s a whodunit  as soon as
word gets out who did do it   
audiences are bound to drop off 
come on  sign on the dotted
line  and i ll make a toast 
ann  darling  the next contract i
sign will be our marriage certificate 
well  first it ll be the divorce papers 
but then our marriage certificate 
edana  darling 
what a pleasant surprise 
you know choo and ann 
i do 
dear girl  what on earth
are you doing down there 
i just fell over  excuse me 
honestly  it s like having
buster keaton for an assistant 
now  i ve just come
from madame zena   
darling  i really wish
you wouldn t see that   
please don t call
her a charlatan 
i was going to say  crackpot  
  what s this 
  it s a tarot card 
i can see that 
what does it mean 
betrayal 
betrayal as in his
affair  not the contract 
that was above board 
is above board 
agatha insisted on
that clause  not me 
no  she s fiercely protective of
her own work  you see  because   
well  she has to be 
people get so riled up 
she s had death
threats  you know 
poor girl can t write so much
as a letter to the times   
without a deluge
of legal action   
and spurious claims she stole
this plot or that character 
isn t that what
happened here  though 
isn t the mousetrap
based on a true story 
yes  well  originally 
i mean  tangentially 
in any case  that s
the reason   
woolf was so keen to shut
the theater the other night 
he can t make his film until the
play ends its run in the west end 
as it is  what with the play
being such a phenomenal success   
he s stuck in
theatrical purgatory 
he s a ruthless
customer  is woolf 
he ll stop at nothing
to get his film made 
it s definitely woolf  sir 
well  not 100  
more like 73 74   i d say 
he killed kopernick in the theater
to force it to close down   
so that he could make his film 
he could marry his mistress 
and then he could get
shot of a blackmailer 
it s not woolf 
it s too elaborate 
burn the place down  if
that s what you want 
besides  doesn t he need
a director to make a film 
well  then it s back to
cocker norris  process of elimination 
no  it s not mervyn 
yeah  but the tongue business 
and he clearly didn t
like leo  did he 
people don t rip out other people s
tongues because of creative differences 
they do it out of revenge   
or rage because they ve
lost a loved one 
they can t forgive or forget   
so they just stew and
fester alone in the dark   
until finally it all comes out in
a sudden  frenzied act of violence 
how did you get the limp  sir 
if you don t mind me asking 
in the war  got shot
in the italian alps 
sounds painful 
what do you   
sorry  sir 
no  that s very funny 
is there a mr  stalker  stalker 
i m afraid he died
in the war  sir 
children 
a boy and a girl 
can t be easy 
what about you  do you
have any family  sir 
i came close  once  yeah 
i had an unfaithful wife 
she was eight months pregnant when
she told me i wasn t the father 
i d made a cot and everything 
that s awful  sir  i m sorry

will you listen to yourselves 
you hear what you re sayin  
constable 
 they do it out of
revenge or rage   
 because they have

thawed out in a jiffy 
i m sorry again that you
had to find out like this 
oh  i can t say it
came as a surprise 
leo was a bad seed 
always in trouble  he was 
he picked a fight the
night he took us out 
mervyn cocker norris
at the hotel 
no  at the pictures 
he turned on this tall fella who
came in after us and shouted   
 what are you following
me for  buddy  
and    did he know a good dentist   cause
he was about to lose a lot of teeth 
right  who s ready for a top up 
no 
where s the old girl  not gonna
play the recluse card  is she 
oh  no  no  no  she ll
be down soon enough 
that will be fellowes 
the man s an oaf 
a tall fella  you say 
had a funny accent 
italian 
no  not that funny 
more like   
a village idiot 
i m sorry  but you
have to get out 
no  good heavens  no 
scotland yard  sergeant
bakewell speaking 
yes  stoppard here 
police  stand back 
he keeps a key   
under the mat 
let me guess  inspector 
you re after an address 
how did you know that 
constable stalker  sir  she called
just now for the same information 
stalker 
agatha 
gosh  is she all right 
where s agatha  what
have you done with her 
  it was the usher  sir 
  i know 
he was under our
noses all this time 
  is he in 
  no  sir  but i found this 
  if we get going now  sir  we can   
  i can take it from here  constable 
oh  right  and me  sir 
go back to the station 
yes  sir 
oh  and  constable 
yes  sir 
make a start on the paperwork 
yes  sir 
is it me  or does he
look awfully familiar 
it s dennis  he s an usher
from the ambassadors 
oh  dennis 
so nice to see you 
this is a strange coincidence 
what are you doing here 
well  i invited you 
oh  my god 
you killed leo and mervyn 
i did 
i wanted to stop the
film and the play 
what film  what play 
the mousetrap 
now  look here  dennis 
we all have strong
opinions on the theater 
in a sense  that s what it s
there for  to provoke emotion 
and i appreciate you don t
care for the mousetrap 
i ll be the first to admit
it s not exactly hamlet 
but you must see   
that this is a bit
of an overreaction 
that s not what this is 
then  what is this 
it s not your story to
tell  is it  it s mine 
oh  i might have known 
a disgruntled writer  don t
tell me  you had the idea first 
no  it happened to me 
i m sorry  i am completely lost  i
don t have a theatrical background 
you re not dennis
corrigan  are you 
oh  you poor boy 
how do you mean 
he lost his brother
in real life 
dreadful business  it was 
it was years ago  now 
i told you about it 
it was the case the
mousetrap was based on 
inspired by 
mother  and loosely 
oh  but you re an usher 
you had to watch that
play night after night 
it must ve been torture 
i thought it would help 
he was only six when
he died  my brother 
the mousetrap is actually
based on a real life case 
neglected and left for dead by the people
who were supposed to look after us 
it sold a lot of newspapers 
but no one cared about us 
i thought the play
would be different 
a famous writer was
going to tell our story 
two brothers who put their faith
in the british social services 
but when i saw what agatha
christie had done   
used our pain and suffering as a
motive for a deranged killer   
my brother s death reduced
to a cheap sideshow   
there s been a murder 
i knew he wouldn t be able to rest
in peace until the play ended 
but it didn t 
it just went on  and on  and on 
the mousetrap is 100  not out 
when i heard about the film
adaptation  i just snapped 
without me  there is no
movie  you understand 
you got a problem  buddy 
i killed the director
to stop the film   
and thought a corpse on the stage
would put an end to the play 
but they didn t even
close the theater 
do you think you might be finished in
time for curtain up tomorrow night 
and mervyn s new ideas for the
film made me sick to my stomach 
i ll take the bare bones of the story 
a rather mundane tale of child abuse   
and make it my own 
he left me no choice 
you startled me 
i had to kill him  too 
i thought that would
be the end of it 
but you all just carried on
like nothing had happened 
shame on you 
well  maybe you ll take notice if
i kill agatha christie herself 
oh  i think she s
tryin  to say something 
oh  for god s sake  let her
out  i ll stop the film 
and the play  this is barbaric 
fine 
edana 
darling  what are
you doing here 
i followed you  i suppose i
was going to make a scene 
hello  ann 
then this beanpole assaulted
me  and i woke up in a carpet 
if you re not agatha christie 
where the hell is she 
good god  man  you
mean you don t know 
what kind of a bumbling 
half witted psychopath are you 
will you be quiet  please 
let me think 
yes  of course 
of course  why don t you
come in and sit down  dennis 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
have a little
moment to yourself 
what 
well   
i  for one  believe that   
dennis here is owed an apology 
  yes 
  he s right  of course 
the truth is the truth 
it is not to be manipulated
or played with   
and certainly not
for entertainment 
  no  no 
  no  no 
  art is supposed to reveal the truth   
  yes 
  yeah 
  not pervert it 
how would agatha christie like it if
someone took one of her stories   
and twisted it and corrupted
it just for the hell of it

but before we go
our separate ways   
you ll be wanting to know what
became of the heroes of this tale 
constable stalker  as advertised  sat her
sergeant s exams in the spring of 1953 
she aced them 
detective inspector
george stoppard 
inspector stoppard was awarded the
king s police and fire services medal 
harrold scott
received a knighthood 
the play  if you can believe it  is
still going strong in london s west end 
over 10 million people have
sat through the mousetrap 
two brothers who put their faith
in the british social services 
a sorry tale of abuse
that ended in tragedy 
well  now that you ve
seen our film   
you are an accomplice to murder 
and so we ask you to remember that
it is very much in your interest   
not to tell a soul
outside of this
