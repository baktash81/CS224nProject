an8not that ive seen
it you understand
but its a whodunit
youve seen one
youve seen em all
you know the drill
an interminable prologue in which
all the key players are introduced
you get a sense of the
world they inhabit
and then the most unlikable
character gets bumped off
theres been a murder
cue the entrance of a
worldweary detective
who comes in and
pokes his nose around
talks to witnesses takes
a couple of wrong turns
and then gathers all the
suspects in the drawing room
and points the finger at the least likely
chump because of the way the guy
i dont know
ties his shoelaces
now youve seen our play
youre an accomplice to murder
and so we ask
you to remember
that it is very much
in your interests
not to tell a soul
outside of this theater
who done it
but what do i know
the limeys they just lap it up
the plays a smash hit
not to mention a cash cow
right there is the milkmaid
in chief petula spencer
this lavish affair is a party to
celebrate the 100th performance
no wonder film producer john woolf wants to
turn the play into a major motion picture
here he is now in the arms of
his slightly paranoid wife
i sense that death
is close at hand
its probably just a draft
this is where i come in
leo kopernicks the name
bigshot hollywood director
hired to make the film adaptation
marginally less boring than the play
easier said than done when the
writers a giant pompous ass
mervyn cockernorris
i say youre rather tall
am i havent really thought
about it to be honest
is that what happened here
sort of i had a bit of
an accident backstage
sure hes educated and he
knows a lot of 10 words
but its like hes never
seen a film before
let alone try to write one
no one important
you know at times you do rather
overdo the temperamental neapolitan
thats a nice jacket
say why dont you scare me up
a real drink will you kid
like a pint of rye or bourbon
or motor oil if you have to
yeah hop to it now
in england that actually
counts as good service
i was stationed here
during the war
and if anything the locals
are more uptight now
than when they had the
luftwaffe overhead
mervyn
shouldnt you be home i
thought we had a deadline
i thought so too
but then our esteemed director
tore up the screenplay
and told me to start
all over again
hes of the opinion that a modern
audience will walk out in protest
if theyre not served at
least one violent death
in the opening frames
suffice to say we are no
longer on speaking terms
merv
londons most sensitive writer
how is the mousetrap huh
did they catch the
guy who did it
i will not stand
here and be insulted
well i guess hes gonna go
over there and be insulted
what passes for
glamour in these parts
sheila sim and
dickie attenborough
kid likes the sound
of his own voice
even money he makes a speech
i suppose i ought
to say a few words
not too many
when have i ever
our wedding remember
we almost missed the honeymoon
yes
darlings youre ever so kind
id like to ask you all to
raise a metaphorical bat
to the old pavilion
the mousetrap is 100 not out
cheers
cheers
i tell you what
else is 100 not out
petulas mother
the old kooks just
crazy about seafood
they just brought out
more langoustines
excuse me i just need
to deal with that
mother please youve had quite enough
hi
now im not one to tell
tales out of school
but the girls over here they go
wild for an american accent
and the promise of
a pair of nylons
but the husbands
right i think its time
someone taught you a lesson
theyre not so easily won over
its only fair to warn you that
i learned to box in the raf
yeah well i learned to fly
a plane in gleasons gym
all of which explains
in an admittedly
roundabout fashion
how i come to be in the theaters backstage
area in need of a change of clothes
hello
hello
aw jeez
i guess i should have
seen this coming
its always the most unlikable
character who gets bumped off
its a whodunit
youve seen one
youve seen em all
were closed
clear off
honestly
oh im so sorry sir
inspector stoppard sir
sorry i was under strict
instructions not to let anyone in
just open the door
yes sir of course sorry
i didnt recognize you sir
ive actually just been
transferred myself
thought it was leeke and
priestley on rotation tonight
careful sir
in you come
constable
stalker sir
god youre all
wet through sir
hope you dont catch
a cold after that
yep after you sir
victims name is leo kopernick
sir the film director
suspected communist
blacklisted in hollywood
so he came out here to work
on a picture for john woolf
you know john woolf
the film producer
he made the african queen
with humphrey bogart
nature mr allnut is what we are
put in this world to rise above
that didnt sound
anything like bogart
no that was katharine hepburn sir
shes in it too wonderful actress
i go to the pictures
quite a lot actually
its the escape i suppose
the romance of the silver screen
yes thank you constable
yes sir
signs of a struggle
actually sir i believe that
happened when mrs boyle was killed
mrs boyle whos
yes sir shes that woman
in the front row there
well she seems to
have bounced back
sorry sir no she was killed
in the play also strangled
not that ive seen it
although i would like to
its an agatha christie
and i do like a good murder
yes thank you constable
yes sir
a ski did that sir
they use it in the
play apparently
as i said i havent seen it
and then the large dent in the
cranium is a sewing machine
seems he was killed in the
costume store initially
and then he was deposited here
staged so to speak
sorry sir
yeah thats the ski that
he took in the face sir
and im afraid it was
downhill from there
sorry sir that one
just came out on its own
seems he came down here
for a change of clothes
why
it was a party to celebrate
the 100th performance sir
the other nought must have
when the victim upset the sponge
and he then proceeded to sit in
the assortment of crustaceans
im told he was
intoxicated sir as a newt
this was actually a lot more
fun than i thought it would be
then he left no one saw him again
until the body was discovered
thats correct sir
perhaps they were all
in on it together sir
looks like the killer tried to
pull out the victims tongue
why would anyone do
a thing like that
excuse me chief inspector
its just inspector
yes of course inspector
i hate to interrupt i do
there really is nothing worse
petula spencer sir
prominent theater impresario
yes thank you constable
tell me how much longer do you
intend to keep us all hostage here
or is that the idea let
the galled jade wince
gather all the suspects
under one roof
and then interrogate each of us in
turn until the mystery is solved
mervyn cockernorris
overrated playwright
celebrated playwright
oh im so sorry sir i
cant read me own handwriting
not that we are
suspects necessarily
are we suspects
it was just a reference to agatha christie
and her penchant for denouement
in which the detective
gathers the
i dare say thats not
please continue
yes thank you mervyn
inspector i want you to know that i
have nothing but the utmost respect
for the metropolitan police
but well do you think you
might be finished in time
for curtain up tomorrow night
oh for goodness sake
john woolf esteemed
film producer
yes thank you constable
this is a murder investigation
surely that takes precedence
sold out or not
yes its all going to plan
for you isnt it woolfie
you want the run to end
i want nothing of the sort
its the decent thing to do thats all
close the theater out of respect for leo
such a tragic loss
inspector i implore
you not to overreact
i would hate to have to
go over your head and
talk directly to your superiors
we wouldnt want that
now would we madam
but im afraid that under the
circumstances as a precaution
precaution
hes already dead
he is madam
but until we have an idea
as to a likely motive
whos to say this
is the end of it
what is that supposed to mean
we are no longer
merely suspects
we are also potential victims
oh god i wasnt in that
was i i must look dreadful
excuse me sir
stoppard
my office
hello sir
what in gods name possessed you
to close down the ambassadors
protocol sir
its a crime scene
no its a public relations
disaster is what it is
public what sir
stalker
sir
not to put too
fine a point on
yes please
here
not to put too fine a
point on it inspector
but your latest blunder
is front page news
an8fleet street is all over this
like hot jam on a devonshire scone
you are slapbang
in the crosshairs
an8now we need to do
everything we can
an8to make sure the bullet
doesnt miss you and hit me
yeah of course sir yes
good
then youll inform
the theater at once
well i thought as
a precaution i
the home secretary is a close
personal friend of agatha christie
his brotherinlaw
is rex harrison
wonderful actor
yes thank you constable
sir
its actually worked in our favor to
have the press distracted like this
it means we can keep a lid on
the rillington place murders
rillington place murders
yes whats that
blimey
havent you heard we have a
serial killer on the loose
you didnt think all of this
was for you now did you
no of course
no
of course not
well have all the resources been
allocated to this other investigation
no not all of them no
i understand you met
wpc stalker last night
i did yes
constable
inspector
a very capable officer
or at least she will be once
she gets the proper instruction
sorry sir im not sure i
you dont mean you want me to
yes i do
id like you to
show her the ropes
im hoping some of her enthusiasm
for police work might rub off on you
but the bullet
sir is that why
this is not a debate stoppard
i have a reputation as a modernizer
i have to be seen to keep it up
i have said in public
that i think women are
the future of the force
absolutely sir i agree
but were not looking for stolen sweets
sweets
or a lost bleeding bicycle
this is a murder
investigation
and she is inexperienced
they were inexperienced
in the war
ask jerry how that turned out
yes sir but
that will be all
thank you
commissioner
inspector
constable
inspector
commissioner
constable
sorry again about
last night sir
with the rain and everything
water under the bridge constable
no harm done
you all right
yeah do we have an
address for the victim
yep it is laurel
canyon hollywood usa
where was he staying
in england constable
right
if i am honest monsieur kopernick
he was not a very good guest
in arrears was he
non but he did not
pay for his room
monsieur woolf did
what part of france
are you from sir
belgium
ah right
oh my my
what a bloody pigsty
they dont clean the
rooms at the savoy
hélas not this one
the maids they refuse
we offer them more money
but still they say non
there was an incident
always avec monsieur
kopernick
there was an incident
thank you constable
sorry sir
did one of these incidents
ever turn violent
oui une fois
how dare you call
me a bad writer
i didnt say that i
said its bad writing
i did the best i could within
the confines of the genre
and woolf loved it
woolf wouldnt know a good script if
it came up and bit him on the ass
its horseshit
no it isnt not all of it
all right what i
read is horseshit
you mean you didnt
even finish it
i read enough pal to know that nobody
gets killed in the first 10 pages
you charlatan give it back
listen listen to me listen
give
we need to go in a completely
different direction
ill kill you for this
kopernick you bastard
thats that then sir its
as good as a confession
lets not jump to
conclusions constable
no sir
the least we can do is
talk to this other party
yes sir cockernorris sir
tell me do you write everything
down in that little notebook
only if its important sir
how do you know
if its important
well ill just sort
of put everything in
as we go and then down the line
when we know whats important
well know that its
already in the notebook
so you do write everything down
yeah everything
thats what i thought
make yourself comfortable youre
just in time for elevenses
you must excuse the désordre
its research for
the film adaptation
police statements court
reports newspaper cuttings
the mousetrap is actually
based on a reallife case
nettle tea
i appreciate youve not yet
had time to come to terms
with the death of
mr kopernick but
is it true his tongue
was pulled out
im afraid i cant divulge details
of an ongoing investigation
it was disgusting
what
thats gio nephew of
mine very hotheaded
i wonder if it
isnt all the fumes
you know from the chemicals
hes an amateur taxidermist
he has a fascination
with the macabre
i call it his
stymphalian bird series
macabre in a strictly
ornithological sense that is
you wanted to ask me about leo
we heard there was an
argument at the savoy
and i noticed you had
the other half of this
inspector that was a
contretemps nothing more
read that part yeah
ill kill you for this
kopernick you bastard
well obviously i
taken out of context i
those words were spoken in anger
and under extreme provocation
we had creative
differences thats all
how did you like the mousetrap
oh yeah the play
yeah i didnt see it yet
well if youd like i can précis this
no no no
i got the basics its
a whodunit right
so you got a dead
body a detective
and then all the suspects
rather conveniently
end up in a remote
country house together
in a nutshell
our task will be to present this
improbable series of events
to an audience of
moderate intelligence
in a manner that does not
cause too much offense
easy
flashbacks
no
no what
no flashbacks
they are crass lazy and they
interrupt the flow of the story
in my opinion they are the last
refuge of a moribund imagination
whatever next a caption that
says three weeks later
merv merv will you come on
this is crazy will
you open the door
im not coming out
until woolf gets here
what is it this time
ill tell you what it is
i pitched a new ending
cockamamienovice over here
locks himself in the bathroom
is this instead
of the car chase
as well as i think he thinks
denouement is french for shootout
will you at least hear me out first
and then tell me you dont like it
come on i storyboarded it
for you come on have a seat
why cant we just have the detective
gather everyone in the drawing room
and then reveal to
them who did it
why cause its
old its tired
its been done a thousand times
so then who explains to the
audience what on earths going on
no one
i dont know the killer
now you see what i
have to put up with
will you please have a seat
so a remote country house
we got all the suspects gathered
in the drawing room right
so far soporific
suddenly the lights go out
our hero grips his colt
special edges into the hall
the killers got a hostage
cant get a clear shot
suddenly kaboom
the place goes up in flames
blam blam
our hero plugs the killer
one in the gut
one in the knee
an8then all of a sudden
an8his goddamned gun jams
hes a sittin duck
sorry not that one
im sorry about this
hes a sittin duck
our killer dying
but not dead
takes aim
boom he fires
out of nowhere
our hero cops partner
dives in slow motion
takes a bullet
our hero cradles his partner
like a father would his child
his face a gumbo of emotions
we hold on the inferno
and we pan left
to a dead butler
hank williams plays us out
i saw the light
you hate it
no no i dont hate it
but you dont love it
of course he doesnt
its preposterous
and totally out of keeping
with the rest of the film
oh who cares
the audience only ever
remembers the last 20 minutes
oh poppycock
hitchcock actually
how does he get the gun
hes a cop
police are not armed in england
what how do they
kill the bad guys
they dont they ask them to
stop in the name of the law
well he fought in the war so
he kept his service revolver
god damn it were gonna have
to pick this up another time
say merv
you wouldnt want to lend
me this pad would you
just for the night
only i got this dame parked
outside i wanna impress
as in she actually is a dame
and well you know
my place aint
exactly the savoy
i thought his place
exactly was the savoy
no he didnt take up residence
there till a month later
and the production company
footed the bill when he did
how he finagled that
ill never know
either i need a new agent
or he had dirt on woolf
did you ever meet these women
who were they
girls he met during the war
who had low standards
and even lower selfesteem
i never had the pleasure
oh wait
tell a lie
merv come on
when i said we should tear up the
script i didnt mean literally
hello leo
what is that doing here
he was kopernicks son
peas in a pod
and the mother
i didnt get a good look a
plain girl rather homely
dark hair glasses
thick lenses
so there we have it
sir cherchez la femme
what
its belgian sir it
means look for the woman
i know what it means
constable what woman
the mother of kopernicks
illegitimate son
cockernorris couldnt remember her name
but i bet its in that little black book
you know the one that you
found in the hotel room sir
if we find her we
have our answer
we need to get a police sketch
artist down here at once
before he forgets anything
im doing it again
arent i sir
jumping to conclusions
conclusions yeah little bit
sorry
constable
i have a very important
mission for you
i need you to find
a telephone box
call the station
get an address for john
woolf the film producer
and ill wait for you here
romulus films soho
sir i wrote it down
you did
mmhmm
right
well done thank you
shall we
telegram came for you
bad news
its the studio
grace kellys doing a
hitchcock picture for warner
so its dial m for
maybe next time
grace kelly
yes
for the part you
promised sheila
yes thats right
which is why this
is such good news
ann
darling whats the matter
you do know a promise is only
a promise if you keep it
what do you mean
i mean you promised me
a night out months ago
i have been so busy lately
yes i know i am
your assistant
i promise as soon as i
have a moment to spare
well youre free on wednesday
am i are you sure
yes
i thought i was
no
no well you should know
you are my assistant after all
well thats settled
then its a date
i promise i will take you out
im afraid mr woolf you
really must be going now
otherwise youll be late
right thank you
no im serious you do actually
need to get back to romulus
right okay yes
yes
this is exciting isnt it sir
id say this is the
type of thing
that made you want to become
a police officer was it
me i just sort of
fell into it really
they needed people after the war
and i needed the money so
no its true the hours
can be unsociable
but i cant type or stand
the sight of blood
so that ruled out
secretary for me
you dont mind if i pick
your brains do you sir
only i have sergeants
exams in a month
and i just have one or two questions
that id love to run by you
actually constable ive just
remembered that i have a
dentist appointment
sorry sir i didnt
know you were suffering
just a routine checkup
what shall i do sir
wait here
but what if woolf turns up sir
wont be long and
you have your
notebook
keep your eyes peeled
yes sir
gin
gin
yeah please
youre joking
oh no
oh god
follow this up with
another please
there you are constable
ive been looking
all over for you
so i gather it was you
that paid for mr kopernicks
rather extravagant hotel suite
nothing unusual in
that inspector
im afraid a producer is expected
to indulge the whims of the talent
especially when
theyre american
but still a pretty penny
a room at the savoy
par for the course
when i was in the congo
for the african queen
huston and bogart refused
to drink the water
insisted on bourbon
even to brush their teeth
not so easy to get hold of in
the jungle i can assure you
you know constable stalker here
is a great admirer of that film
arent you constable
its a marvelous film sir
why thank you constable
encyclopedia
cinematic encyclopedia up there
i wouldnt say that
yeah
right
being humble
im not
so its not true that
kopernick had dirt on you
who told you that
well now what do we have here
woolfie
sittin in a quiet corner
all very nice and intimate
say you wouldnt mind if
i joined you would you
not at all old boy
and you must be mrs woolf huh
swell to make your acquaintance
no no leo this is ann
shes my assistant
workin late huh
if youll excuse me
im sorry
you have a nice night now
well now
this puts me in a tough spot
that im afraid im gonna
have to take advantage of
he asked to be put up at
the savoy and i agreed
i knew it wouldnt be for long
that is just until i found
the right moment to
tell my wife
i see well
well be in touch if
theres anything else
constable
shall we
but sir woolf killed kopernick
to hush up the affair case closed
i think if that was the case he wouldnt
have volunteered the information
so then hes in the clear
no not necessarily
he might have killed kopernick
for another reason entirely
i tell you
ill never get the hang of this
in time for sergeants exams
constable about earlier
i know it looked like id
just come out of the pub
you had just come
out of the pub
thats right
but id only gone in there to get
rid of the taste of the mouthwash
so you had a gin sir
its an antiseptic
i had a filling
i thought you said it
was a routine checkup
i see weve read the chapter
on interrogation techniques
sir
i know i havent done
anything yet to impress you
or to inspire any
confidence and
i know youd probably rather
that i wasnt on the case
but i didnt ask to be put
on this case either sir
i was nervous and i still am
and im probably
trying a bit too hard
but you know even if
i do make mistakes
or if i jump to conclusions
or talk a little bit too
much that has been said
i just want you to know
that you can trust me
sir
okay good
youre joking
constable
commissioner
stoppard about
no sir hes not yet
made it in this morning
its almost eleven oclock
he had a dentist
appointment sir
a filling i think he said it
was a molar it might have been
i have been summoned
to the home secretary
he wants a debrief
i said i had good news
have you seen the play sir
yes
im afraid i took the
wife for her birthday
of course it didnt fool me for a
moment i knew who did it right away
she was baffled though
even after the chap
explained everything
it was a trying night
for all concerned
ill stick to flowers in future
yes always a safe bet sir
sorry
police
please try to be
more careful sir
good morning
commissioner
inspector
is it wise to eat so many mints
how do you mean sir
well
havent you just
been to the dentist
yes thats right sir
yeah it was just a checkup
although i did have
a filling as well
since i was there
ive come down here for
an update inspector
we have good news sir
we do
yes sir isnt that what
you told the home secretary
yes thats what i told the
home secretary on the telephone
i came down here to get it
so we dont have good news

nice wouldnt it
no one of the ushers saw
a suspicious character

to make a liar out of me
constable
commissioner

darkish overcoat

right howd he do it
well sort of
suspiciously
this has been great
off you go

actor who had a fight with kopernick
mr attenborough sir

richard attenborough pinkie brown
brighton rock you must have
you wanted a recording of

it would be good to get a
professional take on it
yeah i have so many questions
i have one or two of my own
i dare say that you do
i understand that you and kopernick
came to blows the night in question
was there a particular
reason for the ill feeling
tell me inspector did you
get your limp during the war
its very slight
i noticed it the other night
when you were on stage i
well i thought i might
borrow it if you dont mind
its always good for the lead
character to have a physical defect
speaks to a troubled soul
it was me inspector
you need look no further
i arrest you for the murder of leo
no no no
no not yet
sorry sir
i was the particular
reason for the ill feeling
yes well leo had his eye on sheila

to do what
bag the lead role in the
film of the mousetrap

but i have bagged the lead role
yeah who told
you that woolfie
he is the producer
honey he just cuts the checks
im the director
without me there is no
movie you understand
you got a problem buddy

rumor is they want to put
a name in the picture
that people have heard of
bona fide hollywood star
they like grace kelly
you ever heard of her
dont worry
they can be talked round
ive got a very silver tongue
i wont lie inspector
i was not entirely sorry to learn of
his demise but i had no part in it
much like the film adaptation
of the mousetrap it would seem
come now darling
you dont know that
woolf promised you the role
hes a man of his
word he went to eton
wake up dickie
hes a man of whatever word
will get his film made
and that contract business with
choo is coming apart at the seams

end isnt that so inspector

or mondays for the tickets
constable

its been a long 30 years
its nice that you
gave her a job
well how else is she
gonna pay the rent
i let her have the spare
room at a discount as it is
yes no you can stop there
we get the idea bravo
i understand that you handled the sale of
the mousetrap film rights to john woolf
yes thats right
i did wait why
whats he been saying
oh hes such a crybaby
honestly he acts as though
i put a gun to his head
hang on a minute
is this important
i doubt it what does it say
no motion picture based on
the stage play the mousetrap
is to enter into production until a
minimum of six months have elapsed
since the end of its
first theatrical run
oh you dont need
to worry about that
its a whodunit as soon as
word gets out who did do it
audiences are bound to drop off
come on sign on the dotted
line and ill make a toast
ann darling the next contract i
sign will be our marriage certificate
well first itll be the divorce papers
but then our marriage certificate
edana darling
what a pleasant surprise
you know choo and ann
i do
dear girl what on earth
are you doing down there
i just fell over excuse me
honestly its like having
buster keaton for an assistant
now ive just come
from madame zena
darling i really wish
you wouldnt see that
please dont call
her a charlatan
i was going to say crackpot
whats this
its a tarot card
i can see that
what does it mean
betrayal
betrayal as in his
affair not the contract
that was above board
is above board
agatha insisted on
that clause not me
no shes fiercely protective of
her own work you see because
well she has to be
people get so riled up
shes had death
threats you know
poor girl cant write so much
as a letter to the times
without a deluge
of legal action
and spurious claims she stole
this plot or that character
isnt that what
happened here though
isnt the mousetrap
based on a true story
yes well originally
i mean tangentially
in any case thats
the reason
woolf was so keen to shut
the theater the other night
he cant make his film until the
play ends its run in the west end
as it is what with the play
being such a phenomenal success
hes stuck in
theatrical purgatory
hes a ruthless
customer is woolf
hell stop at nothing
to get his film made
its definitely woolf sir
well not 100
more like 7374 id say
he killed kopernick in the theater
to force it to close down
so that he could make his film
he could marry his mistress
and then he could get
shot of a blackmailer
its not woolf
its too elaborate
burn the place down if
thats what you want
besides doesnt he need
a director to make a film
well then its back to
cockernorris process of elimination
no its not mervyn
yeah but the tongue business
and he clearly didnt
like leo did he
people dont rip out other peoples
tongues because of creative differences
they do it out of revenge
or rage because theyve
lost a loved one
they cant forgive or forget
so they just stew and
fester alone in the dark
until finally it all comes out in
a sudden frenzied act of violence
how did you get the limp sir
if you dont mind me asking
in the war got shot
in the italian alps
sounds painful
what do you
sorry sir
no thats very funny

oh i cant say it
came as a surprise
leo was a bad seed
always in trouble he was
he picked a fight the
night he took us out
mervyn cockernorris
at the hotel
no at the pictures
he turned on this tall fella who
came in after us and shouted
what are you following
me for buddy
and did he know a good dentist cause
he was about to lose a lot of teeth
right whos ready for a topup
no
wheres the old girl not gonna
play the recluse card is she
oh no no no shell

that will be fellowes
the mans an oaf
a tall fella you say

italian

no good heavens no
scotland yard sergeant
bakewell speaking
yes stoppard here
police stand back
he keeps a key
under the mat
let me guess inspector
youre after an address
how did you know that
constable stalker sir she called
just now for the same information
stalker
agatha
gosh is she all right
wheres agatha what
have you done with her
it was the usher sir
i know
he was under our
noses all this time
is he in
no sir but i found this
if we get going now sir we can
i can take it from here constable
oh right and me sir
go back to the station
yes sir
oh and constable
yes sir
make a start on the paperwork
yes sir
is it me or does he
look awfully familiar
its dennis hes an usher
from the ambassadors
oh dennis
so nice to see you
this is a strange coincidence
what are you doing here
well i invited you
oh my god
you killed leo and mervyn
i did
i wanted to stop the
film and the play
what film what play
the mousetrap
now look here dennis
we all have strong
opinions on the theater
in a sense thats what its
there for to provoke emotion
and i appreciate you dont
care for the mousetrap
ill be the first to admit
its not exactly hamlet
but you must see
that this is a bit
of an overreaction
thats not what this is
then what is this
its not your story to
tell is it its mine
oh i might have known
a disgruntled writer dont
tell me you had the idea first
no it happened to me
im sorry i am completely lost i
dont have a theatrical background
youre not dennis
corrigan are you
oh you poor boy
how do you mean
he lost his brother
in real life
dreadful business it was
it was years ago now
i told you about it
it was the case the
mousetrap was based on
inspired by
mother and loosely
oh but youre an usher
you had to watch that
play night after night
it mustve been torture
i thought it would help
he was only six when
he died my brother
the mousetrap is actually
based on a reallife case
neglected and left for dead by the people
who were supposed to look after us
it sold a lot of newspapers
but no one cared about us
i thought the play
would be different
a famous writer was
going to tell our story
two brothers who put their faith
in the british social services
but when i saw what agatha
christie had done
used our pain and suffering as a
motive for a deranged killer
my brothers death reduced
to a cheap sideshow
theres been a murder
i knew he wouldnt be able to rest
in peace until the play ended
but it didnt
it just went on and on and on
the mousetrap is 100 not out
when i heard about the film
adaptation i just snapped
without me there is no
movie you understand
you got a problem buddy
i killed the director
to stop the film
and thought a corpse on the stage
would put an end to the play
but they didnt even
close the theater
do you think you might be finished in
time for curtain up tomorrow night
and mervyns new ideas for the
film made me sick to my stomach
ill take the bare bones of the story
a rather mundane tale of child abuse
and make it my own
he left me no choice
you startled me
i had to kill him too
i thought that would
be the end of it
but you all just carried on
like nothing had happened
shame on you
well maybe youll take notice if
i kill agatha christie herself
oh i think shes
tryin to say something
oh for gods sake let her
out ill stop the film
and the play this is barbaric
fine
edana
darling what are
you doing here
i followed you i suppose i
was going to make a scene
hello ann
then this beanpole assaulted
me and i woke up in a carpet
if youre not agatha christie
where the hell is she
good god man you
mean you dont know
what kind of a bumbling
halfwitted psychopath are you
will you be quiet please
let me think
yes of course
of course why dont you
come in and sit down dennis
yeah yeah yeah
have a little
moment to yourself
what
well
i for one believe that
dennis here is owed an apology
yes
hes right of course
the truth is the truth
it is not to be manipulated
or played with
and certainly not
for entertainment
no no
no no
art is supposed to reveal the truth
yes
yeah
not pervert it
how would agatha christie like it if
someone took one of her stories
and twisted it and corrupted
it just for the hell of it
she wouldnt
i think that we should all feel
thoroughly ashamed of ourselves
oh here we are
tea for everyone
there you are my dear
sorry to have kept you
no no please dont get
up not on my account
there there
no no no its fine
be careful
just as it was i
think it was that way
it is so nice to see you again
agatha in spite of the circumstances
no no no not that one
no thats for dennis
it is dennis isnt it
there we are
i put an extra lump in
thank you
everyone else help themselves
now dennis
how can i help why dont we
sit here and drink our tea
and discuss the matter
like civilized people
i want you to stop
the mousetrap
oh i am sorry but
that i cannot do no
im afraid it goes against
everything i hold dear in life
yes im a writer you see
i cant be told what to
write or what not to write
it would be a denial
of ones freedom
do you see dennis do drink up
good god fellowes
get up get up
now look here young man i
max
yes good idea
yes
oh my god now whats happened
dennis
put the popular author
down please dennis
no
sheila darling
nows hardly the time
dickie i need a light
but you dont smoke
dickie
look out
no dennis
dont do it please
darling
its all right hes
dead its over
sir
im bleedin
hang in there constable
sergeants exams in a month
its funny sir i actually
i dont feel anything
i think it mighta
just been a nick
yeah just the nick
of time id say
very good
im sorry constable
i havent been altogether honest or open
or loyal or fair to you as a partner
truth be told i havent been
a partner at all you know
sir you dont have to say that
no i want you to know
i do trust you
thank you sir that
does mean a lot
but when i say that i cant feel
anything i think what i mean is that
i dont think the
bullet hit me sir
what do you mean
did you
oh i see
oh no yeah
oh well youre right
again constable
are you all right sir
i think you better
call an ambulance
yep
yes i dont feel so good
a shootout and a big explosion
perhaps its for the best that
mervyn wasnt alive to see it
quite
its okay everyone im fine
now thats what i call
a leo kopernick ending
but before we go
our separate ways
youll be wanting to know what
became of the heroes of this tale
constable stalker as advertised sat her
sergeants exams in the spring of 1953
she aced them
detective inspector
george stoppard
inspector stoppard was awarded the
kings police and fire services medal
harrold scott
received a knighthood
the play if you can believe it is
still going strong in londons west end
over 10 million people have
sat through the mousetrap
two brothers who put their faith
in the british social services
a sorry tale of abuse
that ended in tragedy
well now that youve
seen our film
you are an accomplice to murder
and so we ask you to remember that
it is very much in your interest
not to tell a soul
outside of this
