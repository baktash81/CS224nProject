ideas take hold of me 
i am a woman  i tell my story 
consider my words 
see how little i misuse
the privileges this gives me  
start over from  i am a woman  
but first say it to yourself
 i am a woman  is a truth 
understand  saida 
start from there 
you tell your story 
it s a truth 
 i am a woman 
and i tell my story 
among the young men i attracted
was one i myself noticed 
my gaze fell upon him
in particular 
i didn t realize
the pleasure i procured 
i flirted with others 
not with him 
i wanted to watch him 
not please him  
thank you  saida  maelisse 
 it seems
first love begins
with this sincerity 
perhaps its sweetness
curtails the desire to please 
in turn  he observed me
differently from other young men 
more reservedly 
yet more thoughtfully 
there was something more serious
between him and me 
others welcomed my charms 
i felt at times he was not
indifferent to them 
but so confusedly  i could not
say what i thought of him
nor of myself  
 we left the church 
i remember walking slowly 
i reduced my pace 
i was sorry to be
leaving that place 
my heart was missing something 
but it did not know what it was 
i say it did not know 
perhaps it did 
for as i left  i often turned around
to see the young man i left behind
without knowing i did so for him  
what does it mean
that her heart
was missing something 
when you exchange glances 
when you cross paths
and you both exchange glances
spontaneously 
like with love at first sight 
is there something
less or more in your heart 
eli   
regret 
regret about not speaking
to the person 
for you it s regret 
so regret is something less
in your heart 
regret about not filling
the emptiness in your heart 
thank you  eli 
let s stay on this passage
and compare it
to the princess of clèves 
particularly when she first meets
the duc de nemours 
furthermore  i want you to think
about the idea of predestination
in their encounters  okay 
which happens  for example 
with love at first sight 
honestly 
if i can get laid  i will 
but i won t wait three months 
four days is all it takes 
who needs to wait
three months to get laid 
he seems a little wishy washy 
a little 
he just sat there for an hour 
just a second 
thomas keeps looking at you 
behind me 
look  he can t see 
he keeps staring 
yeah  and it s not the first time 
he s totally into you 
  never noticed 
  come on 
give me a break 
i ve seen him do it 
it could be any of us 
he s sneaking a peak 
you can look 
i don t believe you 
  i m sure you can 
  can what 
what do you think 
play cards 
it s obvious
you re both into each other 
he s cool 
it s totally possible 
seriously  he s hung up on you 
you think you like him 
sure  physically 
yeah  he s cute 
more than just  yeah

i m just good in math 
and after high school 
i d like to work in music 
start a record label 
discover artists 
start a production company 
and do you   
  you play  or just want to produce 
  i play too 
what 
i play percussion   
guitar  piano 
i m not a pro  but   
where did you learn 
on my own  with videos 
by listening 
you play anything 
i d like to  but i d have
to start with music class 
it s not for me 
it s awful 
my morn made me go 
i hated it 
turned me off for 10 years 
what do you listen to 
everything 
i can get into reggae  gypsy music 
classical  dubstep 
everything 
only thing i really can t
stand is hard rock 
people with long hair who scream 
no words  no melody   
not my thing 
it s annoying 
but everything else 
oh  fuck 
why 
because   
my big thing is hard rock 
i mean it  it s no joke 
i m into the hard stuff 
hard rock  hard metal 
you said it s lots of screaming 
you may not like my stuff 
i associate it with guys
with long hair who scream 
so i pass 
maybe your stuff is different 
i m sorry 
  i was kidding 
  you don t play it 
i was trying to fix things 
i couldn t 
i kept blabbering on 
you really think they
all have long hair 
almost 
i don t play it  but it s not true 
but you don t play it 
i ll play you my stuff 
yeah  cool  i d like that 
that way we have
to get together again 
sorry 
you okay

  sorry  i got held up 
  no problem 
the train was late 
been waiting long 
what now 
you want to eat something 
a waffle  a crepe 
we can sit outside 
but a gyro instead 
you got me slaving away
this weekend 
why 
life of marianne 
  you read it 
  i tried  i started 
and 
it s pretty tough  slow going 
you mean you don t like it 
thick books like that   
they put me off 
i put down some short
books after two pages 
but how can anyone not like it 
i didn t say that 
it s all that   
that vocabulary 
the long sentences  the old stuff 
there s lots of description 
he explores sentiments
but gets under her skin 
who knows 
maybe you ll make me like it 
i ll try to read it all 
ever read a book you liked 
have you read a book you liked 
i never read a book 
you never finished
a book you liked 
never 
there was one book i got into 
but i didn t read it alone 
what was it 
dangerous liaisons 
choderlos de laclos 
you learned that by heart 
alone  i d have missed out 
maybe you d have found
your own reasons for liking it 
he explained each chapter 
each letter  analyzed stuff 
it s a bunch of letters 
you don t find it a pain 
a teacher explaining it all 
it made it come to life 
i got into the double dealing 
at one point he writes
to the  marquise de merqueuil  
he says he loves her  but he s
writing on a whore s back 
when you read every other line 
it s another letter 
but she doesn t know 
i d never have gotten that 
that stuff goes over my head 
but in the end i got
really into it 
i m the opposite 
  you read a lot 
  i love to 
when a teacher makes
me overanalyze a book
or a text 
tying everything
into the author s life 
it closes off my imagination 
i don t like it 
but why marianne in particular 
i was going to ask 
why that one 
finish and you ll see why 
i ll read it 
i swear i ll read
life of marianne 
careful what you say 
it s 600 pages 
i ll read it 
i don t give a fuck 
you look like crap 
you didn t sleep 
you fucked  i smell it on you 
how did it go with thomas 
sleep with him 
that s not an answer 
i m pregnant 
i m pregnant 
we re tying the knot 
sleep at his place 
  details 
  there are none 
what did you two do 
spent the afternoon together 
no afternoon fucks 
so you deny it 
what are you  a sex cop 
i want details 
it s obvious you fucked 
why not say so 
i didn t or i d say so 
you didn t sleep 
what did you do 
go on  say it 
come on 
because it sucked 
i d tell you  whatever happened 
i promise 
i don t buy it 
with her face  the smell on her   
i m going in  and you 
we re coming 
i smell it from here 
you are so gross 
since when is fucking a crime 
he s following her 
straight to the bathroom 
adèle 
got a sec 
i feel like you re avoiding me 
i don t know  maybe   
you misunderstood 
or i went about it too fast 
in fact i like you a lot 
nothing to say 
it wasn t good 
yes 
it was great 
say something 
i feel like i m faking 
faking everything 
if he s getting you so worked up   
no  it s me 
he s not the problem 
i m missing something 
i m all messed up 
i m crazy 
there s a reason 
you re not sad out of the blue 
there have to be reasons 
come on  stop torturing yourself 
i look like crap 
come on  you re gorgeous 
  stop 
  i mean it 
  think i don t see myself 
  how can you 
my nose is running 
my hair s all oily 
my face is a mess 
adds to your charm 
thank god i have you 
you ll make him dump you 
bastard 
i won t have to tell him 
if he sees me like this 
he ll say   beat it  
i ll answer   okay  you sure  
it s over 
all settled 
i m sorry  i swear i am 
students  take to the streets 
no to privatization 
no to job cuts 
no to austerity measures 
more money for education 
from the city projects
to the faraway countryside
we re society s rejects 
always on the outside
we cannot find our place
we do not have the right face
born without a silver spoon
inside a gilded cocoon
got no home  got no job
got no papers  we re the mob
they don t want us to unite
they ve done it  all right
their world is dog ear dog
in their machine we re a cog
leris fix a new goal
let s make their heads roll
we won t give up 
we won t give up 
they look quadriplegic 
 little  is a word that comes
back over and over
in the play 
it s a word that stigmatizes
childhood  and powerlessness too 
childhood is a time   
no longer for you   
when we re helpless 
not big enough 
not mature enough 
not strong enough 
antigone is still a child 
she s still little 
 too little   as she says 
but she refuses to be
little anymore  not that day 
it s the day she will say no 
the day she says no 
the day she dies 
what we have here
is a perfect example of tragedy 
tragedy is the unavoidable 
it s what we cannot escape 
no matter what 
it concerns eternity 
it concerns what is timeless 
it concerns the mechanism 
the essence 
of humankind 
  you okay 
and you 
i was bored stiff in french 
got a light 
you okay  not too cold 
we re fine 
alice is cute

my name s emma 
what do you do 
what do you think 
hairdresser 
fourth year of fine arts 
fine arts 
you like it 
yeah  i do 
why is it called fine arts 
are there arts that are ugly 
no ugly arts  i mean   
some can be ugly 
but it s subjective 
because there are also
decorative arts  applied arts 
there s no ugly arts school 
why not 
that s a good point 
at the time of the impressionists 
everyone who was rejected
from the salon
for beautiful paintings
and everyone who was considered   
 ugly  went to the salon of the   
ugly 
sort of the salon of the ugly 
the best artists 
you like painting 
i don t know much  but i like it 
what do you know 
picasso 
and   
picasso

picasso

i m in school 
oh yeah  what are you studying 
literature 
i haven t graduated yet 
i m in high school 
i m doing french lit 
okay  i see 
what s your favorite subject 
depends on the teacher 
if the teacher inspires me 
i like it all 
i find it interesting 
it s a problem 
because my grades can vary 
they can drop from
15 to 4 in a year 
from 15 to 4 
with you it s all or nothing 
but   
they don t vary in french 
because i love to read 
and languages too 
because   
  in fact i love english 
  i m lousy at english 
really 
it s something i d
really like to   
i should take english classes 
my accent is shit 
it s horrible 
  i m really good 
  really 
lucky you

scorsese  kubrick

hey  cousin

we ll be waiting

what high school 
pasteur 
damn it  emma 
i can t talk for five minutes 
what do i owe you 
it s paid for 
how did you do 
i flunked it big time 
and i studied during break 
you cheated 
you were caught red handed 
like an asshole 
  how are you 
  and you 
i was nearby 
i thought we d have a drink 
adã le  you know her 
see that tomboy 
where are they going

  sure you can 
  really 
no  stay like that 
  seriously 
  yeah  you can move 
thanks 
thanks for what 
just thanks 
embarrassed 
a little 
really 
yeah 
it doesn t make you happy 
it does 
doesn t show 
i don t get sketched every day 
you often draw people you meet 
no  not often 
i just felt like it 
  my hair isn t a mess 
  it s pretty  don t touch 
i rarely do portraits 
i pick a detail 
and i use it again after 
differently 
it can be   
a skin fold by the lips
or an emotion in the eyes 
 the mysterious weakness
of man s face  
  know that 
  i don t think so 
sartre 
  know him 
  yeah  but i never heard that 
i tried his essays 
but i didn t understand 
i prefer his plays 
you know dirty hands 
  like it 
  love it 
me too 
try existentialism is a humanism 
good introduction 
and not too hard 
the idea behind sartre is that
existence precedes essence 
we re born  we exist   
and then define ourselves
by our actions 
it gives us a great responsibility 
i think i read it  i m sure 
but i didn t understand 
maybe i m bad
at philosophy  but for me 
existence  essence
is like the chicken and the egg 
i don t think we can
ever know what came first 
you re funny 
none of that stuff matters much 
he started an
intellectual revolution
that set an entire
generation free 
he said we can choose our lives
without any higher principle 
i was big on sartre in high school 
  really 
  it did me good 
especially in affirming
my freedom and my own values 
and the rigorousness
of his commitments 
i agree with it 
sort of like bob marley 
almost 
i m not so sure of that 
i m almost sure of that 
their ideas are similar 
you know  get up  stand up  
yeah  i know it 
he s committed 
it s true 
same as sartre 
philosopher  prophet    same thing 
you can help me with philosophy 
because you seem   
whenever you want 
i have to go 
i was supposed to meet sabine
15 minutes ago 
want to see 
you don t have to like it 
yeah  i like it 
it s strange 
because it s me and it isn t 
it s a sketch 
it needs some work 
i ll give it to you 
been with sabine long 
it s been   
about two years 
why 
i have to go

a friend of yours

you re welcome  good bye 
just checking you gave
me the right number 
think i m avoiding you 
i don t know 
since i m the weird
and imposing type 
you think you re a certain type 
maybe 
the type who s over 18
and hangs out in gay bars 
i think we re pretty different 
i m not so sure 
you can t tell from one meeting 
how are you 
and you 
got a light 
who was that girl who came 
with blue hair 
a little bit dykey 
  whatever

blue hair doesn t mean dyke 
it s obvious she eats pussy

i didn t lie  it s just that   
we were out walking 
and we had a drink  that s all 
  that was all 
  just a drink in a gay bar 
  okay  no problem

come on  let s fight 
you ll never touch my pussy 
dirty dyke 
shut your face 
he mentions  a pathological scruple  
what is that 
does that mean gravity  for you 
louis 
in stanza two  he says   
 the only vice of
water is gravity   
he associates natural law 
the universal law of gravity 
with a vice  as if   
everything natural is perverted 
and vice versa 
it s sort of the opposite of   
catholic conservatism 
which would say
that vice is not natural 
and you have to   
repress it  reject it 
he says that
gravity itself is a vice 
it can t be avoided 
it s totally intrinsic to water 
adèle  what do you think 
about what louis said 
i agree 
are you following any of this 
no 
we re talking about a
vice intrinsic to water  gravity 
start reading from  this vice     
page 62
throwing away the skin

even when i m full 
everything but shellfish

  that s all 
that s what i like most 
it s beyond me 
i love oysters 
really 
the texture alone grosses me out 
that s the best part 
they re like little snot balls 
big snot balls 
they remind me of something else 
i don t want to know 
something to say 
i don t know 
what 
i wanted to know
when was the first time
that you tasted

you that adèle   
doesn t like shellfish 
i m so sorry 
no big deal 
seafood isn t really my thing 
but don t worry 
a nightmare 
it s all we have 
you re a pain 
i go all out 
then you come and say   
 adèle hates oysters  
i ll have other stuff 
the entree too  no problem 
  even jumbo shrimp 
  especially 
no biggie  perfect occasion
to initiate her  it s fine 
like at the school cafeteria 
you squeeze lemon on the oyster 
and usually  if it s
really good and fresh 
it moves 
that means   
it s good  see 
look 
  it s moving 
  why tell me this 
  it s alive

it has to be alive

  it s good 
  you seem to enjoy it 
  it s good 
i ll try another 
great 
these are excellent oysters 
you have beautiful paintings 
my ex husband was an art lover 
emma gets a lot of that
from her father 
your ex loved art
but your new husband   
a lover as well 
but most of the paintings here   
lover of what 
they come from her father 
a lover of food and wine 
that counts 
i agree 
and also   
culture 
tell us about yourself 
we want to know about your life 
what you want to do 
i want to teach 
nursery school  i love kids 
you love kids 
have you always wanted to teach 
it s not that
i loved the school system 
but school means a lot to me 
it s taught me a lot 
it helped expose me to things
that my parents or friends
didn t show me 
i want to pass that on 
what do you need to do 
i ll get a masters
and then do teacher training 
that way i can start
by being an assistant teacher 
and honestly  i don t see myself   
going to school for 10 or 15 years
just to end up unemployed 
i want something concrete 
does the job market scare you 
i sense it in what you say 
maybe you ll go to school and see
that something else interests you 
for now it s what interests me 
at least you know
where you re going 
and that s important  i think 
mom 
happy birthday 
my sincerest wishes
may these flowers bring you joy
may your year be
sweet and carefree
and next year may we
all meet again
happy 18th  adèle 
mom  cheers 
  he s the king of bolognese 
  hope you like it 
help yourself 
some wine 
yes  please 
nice to meet you  emma 
we ve heard about you for months 
here you are at last 
it s great to   
to put a face
to everything you ve said 
really 
i m the one who   
thanks for having me 
it s our pleasure 
eat  it ll get cold 
it s nice of you
to help her with philosophy 
it s a really hard subject 
she was having
a tough time  but now   
it seems to be going well 
your grades are up 
thanks to you 
it s a pleasure for me 
i wasn t going about it right 
she taught me   
to make outlines 
that s important 
i don t know how
they can do that subject
in just a year 
i don t see the point 
you can t do it in depth 
one year isn t enough 
  well 
  it s delicious 
i knew it 
so you re at beaux arts 
  it shows 
  really 
it s artistic 
not everyone likes it 
it suits you well 
do you do it   
yourself 
her stuff is great 
she s having a show 
already 
at the end of the year
we show our work 
you have to let us know 
we ll come see 
living off painting
is pretty hard nowadays 
it s difficult 
the people who make
a living off it are all dead 
it s true 
i m a graphic artist too 
and it s easier these days
to live off graphic arts
than off painting 
there are openings in that 
it s important
to have an artistic side 
but you need a real job too 
to earn a living 
so if things ever get bad 
you make a living 
not to pry  but your boyfriend   
what does he do 
he works in business 
that s good  it s reassuring 
that way you can do
your painting and he   
if you want to be an artist 
it s nice to have a husband
who pays the bills 
we re not married 
you have time 
take your time 
  you never know 
  true 
the pasta is delicious 
simple but   
very good 
my love 
you scared me 
i thought you were going to scream 
i was going to shriek 
good thing you didn t 
you re beautiful 
so soft 
my morn thinks
you re sleeping in the bed there 
on the cot 
enjoying philosophy 
i love it 
it s incredibly enriching 
very deep 
very intense 
orgasm precedes essence   
your grade better be good 
give me a grade 
fourteen 
just fourteen 
you still need some practice 
i ll give it all i ve got 
this time it must be the wolf 
 it s mrs  goat 
with my seven kids 
let us hide 
have you heard the bad news  
the wolf is coming back 
 come inside   says mr  rabbit 
everyone sits down  and suddenly   
knock  knock  knock 
it s the wolf 
it must be the wolf 
must be 
 it s me  little lamb 
i was down by the stream 
but i cannot go home  because   
the wolf is coming back  
 come in   says mr  rabbit 
 come sit by the fire  
little lamb sits by the fire
when suddenly   
bang it 
keep moving 
keep using your hands 
play your drums 
don t stop 
keep on moving 
you don t want to play 
want to stay here 
hey  you

what are you doing tonight 
i don t know 
we re going out for a drink 
sylvie  quentin  anabelle   
want to come 
but tonight i have a family dinner 
you have a lot of family dinners 
these days i do 
maybe after  around what time 
are you avoiding us 
why do you say that 
whenever i suggest something 
you re busy 
just bad timing  that s all 
is your family far 
no  pretty close 
a few miles 
okay  then 
i hope you ll be able
to get free 
i ll do my best 
i swear i will 
it s gorgeous
i ve seen you on canvas

to keep it a mystery 
does it hurt 
want to sit 
  i m fine 
  sure 
playing with baby 
  is he the dad 
  not at all 
you thought it was him

i m sorry

i d especially like

adèle 
welcome  adèle 
i d also like to say
she did all the cooking 
speech 
it s your turn now 
i m really thrilled
to meet you all 
and i hope you like it 
don t cry 
cheers 
let s have a toast 
to adèle 
to emma and adèle 
to love 
she s in a trance 
and not even drunk yet 
anything else 
come sit down a little 
join us 
what do you do 
i teach nursery school 
and you 
i m doing a ph d 
both art history and philosophy 
i m doing a ph d  on   
you know egon schiele 
  i told you about him 
  maybe 
he does nudes 
emaciated  in unlikely positions 
i m working on morbidity
in schiele s oeuvre 
didn t you show her some stuff 
yeah  but i prefer klimt 
klimt is so   
there s something so   
florid    decorative 
florid and decorative 
you and i can t talk 
you hate it when people disagree 
i like schiele a lot 
it s more twisted 
it s darker  more obscure 
that s the reason i like klimt 
it s that   
the problem
with that florid stuff   
it s not florid 
you can t say it s florid 
i m hungry 
i m starving 
some sauce too 
any parmesan 
get in line 
that s fine 
perfect  thank you 
you re welcome 
it s so good 
adèle  it s out of this world 
thank you so much 
you re welcome 
  good 
  excellent 
a worm crawls out
of a plate of spaghetti and says 
 that was some gangbang  
how sweet 
 sweet  may not be the word 
what a pleasure to share this 
our kind of pleasure 
can pleasure be shared 
we each experience it differently 
my pleasure
isn t the same as yours 
i don t get the same
pleasure as you 
find the parmesan 
   between the sexes 
a quality of pleasure
so different
that we attain differing realities 
over and above orgasm 
i m curious 
why do you think that 
because   
we make faces 
  we make more noise 
  big difference 
something to drink 
every time i slept with a woman 
i noticed something
that s not   
she enters another world 
that s it 
orgasm is an
out of body experience 
our orgasm is limited 
for you  female orgasm is mystical 
i m totally sure of it 
anyone need anything 
sit down  you ve been
serving everyone 
here  eat 
relax a little 
you cooked for everyone 
   insofar as i m a man 
everything i glimpse is frustrated
by the limits of male sexuality 
even though i ve done it
with men and women 
i remember the story of tiresias 
who was lucky enough
to be a man  then a woman 
then a man again 
when he was asked
who gets more pleasure 
man or woman 
he answered categorically
that women get nine times
more pleasure than men 
ever since women
have been shown in paintings 
their ecstasy is shown more than men s 
which is shown via woman 
we see women bathing  we see   
the origin of the world 
men try desperately to depict it 
meaning they saw it 
  or imagined it 
  or wished for it 
it could be their fantasy 
  so it s based in   
  look in their eyes 
that gaze into another world 
art by women
never tackles female pleasure 
excellent pasta 
want some more 
yeah  i d like a little 
not too spicy 
you like spicy 
it s a little spicy 
but just spicy enough 
you see  emma  your paintings
of adèle seem to illustrate this 
i know i ll never experience that 
because i ll always be a man 
i love the sauce 
make it with fresh tomatoes 
from the market 
i can tell 
had you ever posed before 
never 
it s your first time 
i don t really pose 
just with emma 
you seem comfortable
in the paintings 
because they were
at times when i   
i don t know 
i can t imagine doing it
with someone else 
i know it s a stupid question   
but have you been
with girls for long 
is emma the first 
or were there any before 
she s the first 
is it different 
  from what 
  guys 
yes 
a little 
is it gentler 
it depends 
i have no idea 
sorry to ask like this 
you don t have to answer 
i don t think i could explain 
what do you do 
i teach nursery school 
you like kids 
would you like to have some 
what do you do 
i m an actor 
i do action movies 
i did an action movie 
my first  in the states 
that i got because i speak arabic 
they dig that 
the beard thing 
we were terrorists  hijackers 
they love it when we say
allah al akbar 
so we did that 
i m serious 
it was fun to see
how the americans work 
where in the states 
we shot it in a studio in l a 
but it took place in new york 
they rebuilt the city 
it s wild 
it s like you re walking
down the streets of new york 
then i was in new york on vacation 
i really  really loved it 
i m sure it s a city you d adore 
  pm to go 
  really 
so go  why wait 
it s a total trip 
it s amazing 
it s like walking on a film set 
i swear 
such energy 
everything seems possible 
you can do whatever 
like there are no barriers 
there s a huge bug on you 
what was it 
i don t know 
what are you reading 
a piece on schiele  the guy
lucie and i were talking about 
your friends are nice 
they re funny 
they talk about so much stuff 
they seem so knowledgeable 
so cultured 
i felt uncomfortable 
you were perfect 
you made a good impression 
especially on joachim 
really 
what does he do 
i was afraid to ask 
  biggest gallery owner in lille 
  in lille 
he s extremely cultured 
a genius  he knows everything 
he shows only the crã me de la crã me 
believe me   
if he ever shows my work 
i ve got it made 
he ll show your work 
  think so 
  of course 
he talks about you
as if you were picasso 
it s business above all
for those guys 
  he s your friend  why wouldn t   
  my friend   
our relationship
is mostly professional 
not really a friendship 
but he can change things 
just believe in it 
knock on wood 
you should also do
something you really like 
i work 
i know  i don t mean that 
you write really well  for example 
why not write some stuff 
even short stories   
i ve always just
written for myself 
it s a shame
to waste your talent like that 
i write what i feel 
i can t expose my life to the world 
you can invent rather than expose 
i don t know how 
you love inventing stories
and telling them to kids 
you like doing that 
but for kids  constructing
a storyline isn t my thing 
anyway  it s up to you 
i don t know 
i d like you to be   
  be what 
  i don t know 
fulfilled 
i am fulfilled with you 
i like it that you re here 
cooking and stuff   
but i d like to see you happy 
i am happy 
i m happy with you  like this 
it s my way of being happy 
if you say so 
it hurts when you insist 
i m not insisting 
a little 
kiss me 
a real kiss 
i want you 
i can t 
why not 
i m having my period 
why now 
i don t know  it happens 
you re early 
what can i say 
i have no idea 
is lise your ex 
she paints too 
monday is all gray 
tuesday  yellow like hay 
pink wednesday  stay home and play 
blue thursday

thursday green is next seen 
friday green 
who s first 
sana  stand up 
in the morning 
we come to school 
she s telling us
what we do during the day 
listen up 
stop pinching  maxence 
come here 
go on  sana 
we play 
after we get here  we play 
we do our activities  and then 
we go outside for   
recess 
then 
we have gym 
after gym 
we take a nap 
and then we work
with thérèse and madame 
time to stop talking 
do they have everything 
i had three dollies 
i can watch them now 
  really 
  sure 
i ll meet you after 
one new message 
honey  it s me 
i m still with lise  working
on the mock up i mentioned 
it s a big job  and it
has to be perfect 
don t wait up  i ll be late 
call if you want 
take care 
it s hot 
what s his problem with me 
he has a thing with lesbians 
i m happy to explain my paintings 
to say what inspired me 
but i can t get
into intimate details 
i don t have to justify who i am 
there are things
i don t want to tell him 
i can t sell myself 
when i see someone
constantly needling me   
he meant to put me down 
that s the thing 
he has to respect my work 
it s my freedom of expression 
my artistic freedom 
i can paint what i want 
you don t want some coffee 
too bad if it s no 
but he can t say 
 i ll buy your painting 
but accentuate the line   
or make it blurrier here 
or use this or that color  
i m not saying that 
i m open to criticism 
i saw his questions coming 
how can i answer that 
asshole 
bread and butter 
it s crazy 
they don t understand anything 
there s a fad in painting 
you have to follow it 
i don t care about fads 
want one 
i don t give a shit 
people only think
in terms of business 
they have no   
i don t know how to explain it   
they have no taste 
they just have no taste 
it s normal to be tense at times 
i get tense with colleagues too

you still look as young 
it s hard to lose these cheeks 
i wanted to look more ladylike 
i changed my hair to be taken
seriously  but apparently   
i was wrong 
it looks good 
you know  it happens
faster than you think 
really 
i ve never met anyone
who wanted to look older 
what about your shows and stuff 
is all that going well 
it s fine 
it s all fine 
tell me 
it s a little   
a little complicated to organize 
press  journalists 
the price of success 
i see what your fans
write on your site 
bunch of dykes 
hey  you asked for it 
i saw your latest paintings 
really 
you blow me away 
it s new  yet it s still you 
i m lousy at explaining it 
i ll buy one once i
have some money 
come on  i ll give you one 
i ll pay you 
yes 
it s important for me 
i can pay in flesh and blood 
it was a joke  a bad joke   
but a joke 
it was funny 
and you re doing well 
still with my kids 
i have first graders now  older 
i m a beginner  but   
it s great  them too 
with their abcs 
during school break 
i have a support group
for the ones with problems 
they re my favorites 
very special cases  but   
they re magical 
so gratifying when you can help 
i m having a blast 
they put me to the test 
push my limits 
but it s fascinating 
it s what you wanted 
yeah  i think 
that s good 
yeah  it s great 
but time consuming 
i have no time for myself 
you don t go out 
i do  but with other teachers 
nightclubs 
vieux lille  restaurants 
but   
i often go home alone 
i mean  i m all alone

i see old emma  new emma 
blue and red 
the life bearer 
she seems totally at peace 
yet there s something
troubling in her eyes 
i like it  i was wondering
what she s thinking 
there s an incipient
happiness  but also
a lot of anguish 
her gaze is absent 
yet it seems to beckon us
amid all the colors 
i ll be right back 
we ll talk afterwards 
sarah went to beaux arts too 
i love what you do 
i feel a passion  a movement   
in the lines 
too much talk 
what a pickup artist 
it s nice to see you 
how do you like it 
it s breathtaking 
and joachim s showing her work 
when i got the invitation

good to see you 
same here 
are you still in movies 
real estate now 
i m still doing movies 
but very little 
i was sick of   
rubbing everyone the right way 
ball busting directors 
it was a pain 
better to be a
hypocritical salesman 
like the show 
not bad 
it s not really my thing 
you re still as beautiful 
think so 
even in real life 
that makes you laugh 
at least you re smiling again 
it s not that hard seeing emma
