the young king louis xiii
ascends to the french throne
his once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides
within the borders of france itself
cardinal richelieu the kings advisor
plots in secret to seize power for himself
the inexperienced louis
and his new bride queen anne
find themselves without a single friend
europe is a powder keg waiting to explode
in a war that will engulf
the entire continent
and only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse
move out
halt
dont
getting careless
the feeling is mutual
for future reference i love you
would have been a more suitable reply
could have just said hello
what would be the fun in that
how was the bishop
not as good as you
you are incorrigible
i bet you say that to all the girls
but sir remember i am a lady
let me touch your bosom
sir keep your hands to yourself
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us
amen
thats enough wine i can assure
what
key
you mean this key
who are you
im not a priest
im not really a lady
i have 1 0 minutes
there once was an aunt from lorraine
with an incredible tolerance for pain
she had a nasty habit
involving a chicken a frog and a rabbit
i expected more
from a man of your reputation
i dont suppose you have any idea
where i could find athos and aramis
never heard of them
you french spies
youre very very arrogant and foolish
and youre so
sexy
its a wonder it took me so long
to catch you
you didnt
i beg your pardon
you didnt catch me
and what exactly are you doing here
catching you
key
vive la france
da vincis vault
leonardo designed it to protect
the plans of his greatest inventions
shall we
now
your parts done why dont you stay back
well meet at the rally point
we came together
we leave together
ill go
wait wait
too easy
pressure plates under the floor
oh
i could scale the walls
run a cable along the roof
could be boobytrapped too
hmm
well we dont have all night
youre absolutely certain
there are no hidden passages
and no secret tunnels
positive sir its a vault
one way in one way out
excellent i want these musketeers dead
i want them dead
the guards change in two minutes
maybe less
less
what now
cest la vie
no
contingency plan
got it
athos you do know whats up there
just hold your breath
get out
hey get back down there now
go ahead say it
i love you
i hate to ruin the mood
but perhaps we could go elsewhere
you know for once i think
the padre may be right
all for one
and one for all
so whats next
back to paris i guess
and then what
wherever they send us
whatever france needs
its who we are its what we do
i do love you
i know
then please try and understand
that this isnt personal
its strictly business
he made me a better offer
ah athos
buckingham
a toxin
in case you were wondering it wasnt
in your drink it was on your cup
inactive until it came into contact
with the liquid
dont worry
lt isnt fatal
although i suspect
a part of you wishes it was
you take all the risk and i get the reward
hardly seems fair
well just so you dont leave emptyhanded
a word of advice
trust no one especially women
youll live longer
telling him you loved him
right before you betrayed him
i must say that was cruel
even by my standards
i only took away his prize
you took a lot more than that
at last the war machine
look down
its a trick an old friend taught me
your adversary will not always be
as noble as you
remember that
and i have nothing left to teach you
i doubt that father
keep it
its passed down from generation
to generation from father to son
its yours now
the weapon of a musketeer
the real weapon of a musketeer
is here
all for one
and one for all
you remind me of somebody
let me guess you
no no
the man i wish i was when i was your age
well you should really be on your way
take this purse theres 1 5 crowns in it
its enough to get you to paris
and youll need a mount
your mothers insisting you take buttercup
i know its not much and
its plenty
take care of yourself my son
try not to get into any fights
if im to be a musketeer i think i might
have to do a little bit of fighting
stay at the back if you can
yes mother
theres one more piece of advice
i know i know dont get into any trouble
wrong
get into trouble
make mistakes
fight love live
and remember always
youre a gascon and our son
now go go
in the name of god
what kind of beast is that
and the beast hes riding
doesnt look much either
ostler
sir
please see that my horse is watered and fed
oh
its a horse is it
my friends here thought it was a cow
excuse me
see i know you men
are just kidding around
buttercup
well she gets a little sensitive
im afraid i must ask you to apologize
well im afraid im not in the habit
of apologizing to gascon yokels
not to me
to my horse
youve hurt her feelings
and if i dont
i shall have to kill you
you shot me
most observant of you young man
but the real question is
why are you not dead
flesh wound
sight must be off
who takes care of my pistols
captain rochefort i
whoa whoa steady
wouldnt want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood
so boy
consider this a lesson
your last

as you wish milady
rochefort come

all for one
excuse me
sorry im sorry

who insulted my horse
and tried to kill me so let me go
thats not good enough
you spilled my drink and ruined my shirt
im in a hurry

the town drunk from the smell of you
now that my boy is fighting talk

blind and deaf
fortunately for you
im somewhat of a doctor
great when can you fit me in
1200 coopers yard st germain
ill be there
excuse me
i just cant decide
well if i might point out
this does make you look very dignified
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side
equally important
dignified dashing
in the words of king
solomon ill take both
a most excellent choice sir
darling you spoil me
i dont know how i shall ever repay you
watch yourself
my apologies
matter of life and death wont happen
again believe you dropped this
this isnt mine
i saw the lady hand this to you
im not blind

i take money from this woman
are you saying that i cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe

spot but this is a brandnew jacket
coopers yard st germain 100

5 francs

failure to remove animal bowel movements
from public area
french
your horse took a dump on the street
youre joking
thats what they all say
you know what
coopers yard st germain 200
strange boy
milady de winter
close game your eminence
hmm
whos the opponent
myself no one else proved to be
a sufficient challenge
hmm
what news of england
hes coming
buckingham
hmm
and
and
he built it
the war machine
and he doesnt question your loyalty
he thinks hes so cunning
so evil
evil is just a point of view
ah
richelieu
is this lady the emissary from england
your majesty is exceptionally alert
so madam
what of buckingham
majesty
well whats he wearing these days
green your majesty
green
hmm
very interesting
and you had the gall to recommend blue
of course it should be green
why am i surrounded
by incompetent idiots
green green green
do i have to do everything myself
ah
there you are shall we get to it
so are you eager
to meet your maker
i have other appointments
youll miss them im afraid
well ill try my best to be on time
my seconds
you
youre fighting this rascal
my appointments
100 200
how long have you been in paris
arrived this morning
you have been busy
patience is not one of my virtues
well neither are good manners
wait for your turn old man
what would you like me to put
on your headstone little shit
dartagnan
im athos
this is porthos and aramis
the three musketeers
ive heard of you
from my father a musketeer himself
in fact i came to paris to be one of you
im afraid youre a little late
what happened
oh a bad mission budget cuts
cardinal progress
take your pick
well then welcome to paris
pity well have to kill you
well if i cant become a musketeer
i might as well fight one
or three
kill him already
its lunchtime and im starving
halt
jussac
well well well
how the mighty have fallen
dueling in defiance of the edicts
you got tired of rolling peddlers
for spare change
now
seal the square
surrender your weapons
and come along with us
seal it off
unless of course you would rather resist
new plan
kill the boy kick their asses
and then go get some lunch
i could do with some exercise
seal it off boys
you were saying
on the other hand
discretion is the better part of valor
youre the musketeers
wrong
we were the musketeers
now were justus
rochefort
shall we
finish them off
lets even the odds
enjoying the show
you
watch out
you didnt
answer my question
are you always this cocky
only on tuesdays
and whenever beautiful women are involved
damn you
cant you see
were trying to have a conversation
what is your name
constance
constance sounds very steadfast
a quality you seem to know little about
oh i beg to differ
deep down i am a hopeless romantic
back for more
musketeers musketeers musketeers
id forgotten what it feels like
we all have
the name is dartagnan
you must come from a very small town
how did you know
lines like yours
might actually work there
this is paris
i suggest you stick to swordplay
in the battle of wits
you sir are unarmed
shes right lad
the ladies of paris
are infinitely more complicated
they have 1000 ways of saying no
and only some of them mean yes
i hate to ruin the mood
but they will be back
and unless you wish to
fight an entire army
elsewhere
so now what
do we pick up where we left off
i think theres been enough fighting
for one day
besides any man whos an enemy
of rochefort is a friend of mine
whos rochefort
captain of the cardinals guards
the right hand of the most powerful man
in france
rochefort is the most feared swordsman
in europe
you certainly know how to pick your fights
like i said he insulted my horse
youre reckless
arrogant impetuous
probably be dead by sundown
but i like you lad
where are you staying
no idea
ah do you have any money
well good sir
you and your fine steed
are welcome in our humble home
for the time being
that goes in there
come on
what shall we drink to
how about the king
hes a child cardinal rules in all
but name might as well drink to him
to france
we served it fought for it and bled for it
look where it got us
friendship love
word of advice boy
trust no one
must be something you still believe in
this
and this
anyone who tells you otherwise is either
a fool or trying to sell you something
i know athos may seem cold and unfriendly
but dont let it fool you
deep down
he really is cold and unfriendly
what happened to him
what happens to any man a woman
you know i dont want to offend anybody
but i thought youd all be
a little bit moreheroic
what my esteemed colleague
was trying to say in his own way
is that we are obsolete
were warriors
but theres no war for us to fight
and so we drink and brawl
and quarrel with the cardinals guards
and then we drink some more
what we need is a great cause
but there are no great causes left
which is why i keep telling you its not
too late to do that priest thing again
beats working for the city
free booze at wakes and weddings
and then theres the nuns
you were a priest
until i realized being a man of god
and a man of the cloth
arent always the same thing
and yet he still says prayers
for those he kills
old habit
on the contrary
the men i kill deserve to die
but they also deserve peace
after all they must have believed
in something
we all do even the worst of us
ill drink to that
planchet more wine
planchet
sorry sirs
im afraid
theres none left youve drunk the lot
what sort of answers that
well go get some more man
very good sir its just i cant sir
weve run out of money
planchet what are you
complete and utter waste of space sir
and
as much use as a fart in a bottle sir
right
in short sir a total tit sir
but i cant work bleeding miracles
planchet
oh
thank you very much sir
thats incredibly generous
from such a handsome young man
thank you very very much
will you be staying here tonight
hell be taking your bed planchet
right and so ill be sleeping
you may take the balcony
outside the balcony outside in the cold
with birds shitting on my head all night
great can i just say you
wine wine
wine wine wine wine
yes of course wine it is sirs
check
this is a ridiculous game
surely the king
should be the most powerful piece
the king is the most important piece
but hes vulnerable he needs protection
may i suggest you castle him
checkmate
there what do you think of that
your majesty is a force of nature
took you by surprise eh
yes indeed you did
may we speak a little about foreign policy
its not about buckingham is it
oh im afraid it is
hes arriving in paris tomorrow
his master king james has agreed
to hear our peace proposal
good good well he knows better
than to mess with me then
theres also another matter
a dangerous rivalry has sprung
between your majestys musketeers
and my personal guards
who was involved
athos porthos aramis
the usual suspects
and a young man called dartagnan
i have summoned them to the palace so that
your majesty can punish them severely
his majesty the king
well well well
brawling with the cardinals guards
thats very bad
what have you got to say for yourselves
we
humbly beg your pardon your majesty
yes
yes i should hope so too
so tell me how many
were involved in the altercation
there were four of us against 40 of them
your majesty
four against 40
and you beat them like a drum
and yes you shall have to be reprimanded
of course
most harshly im afraid
you do understand that dont you
we do your majesty
her majesty the queen
anne
what a what a pleasant surprise
my ladies and i wanted to see
the valiant musketeers
who stood against the cardinals guards
four against 40
or was it 400
just 40 your majesty
lt was an off day
thats my musketeers for you
by the time they write songs about them
itll be 4000
i hope you wont be too harsh with them
after all boys will be boys
you must be dartagnan
my lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday
but you must try not to be so reckless
cant help myself your majesty
your majesty the culprits
ah yes yes
well stand up then
athos
porthos
aramis
forgive me for saying this dartagnan
but you do look a little underdressed
my father is a poor man your majesty
a former musketeer as well
these are the only clothes i have
oh lord
we shall have to rectify that
cant have my musketeers
or the son of one looking like tramps
new suits all around i think
yes youll see to that cardinal
and yes i think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage
youll see to that as well cardinal
and yes before i forget
no more fighting
with his eminences guards
hmm
or therell be none of them left
your majesty might i suggest a more
forgive my impudence cardinal
but i doubt the king
requires your advice in this matter
after all they are his musketeers
good day gentlemen
well now
off with you rascals
but be there for the parade tomorrow
new suits and all
i tire of these royal children
its time to make our move
we shall use buckinghams arrival
to our advantage
during his visit we will reveal
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the queen
may i inquire how your eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair
by reading buckinghams letters
to the queen found in her possession
written in buckinghams hand
then authenticated by his seal
a woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either
hmm your eminence is too kind
however i doubt that the king
will accept such letters
as definitive proof of
his wifes indiscretion
then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial
a piece of the queens jewelry given
to buckingham as a token of affection
buckingham will be humiliated
the king will be outraged
the queen will be executed
france will have no
choice but to go to war
and in times like these france will
naturally turn to a stronger leader
someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge
hmm
someone like your eminence
about face
well where is he then
its just appalling manners
drop anchor
anchor aweigh
damn his impudence
what is that thing called
anyway richelieu
an airship your majesty
why dont i have one of those
an oversight on our part
right right well build me one
secure the lines
all lines secured
buckingham
blue
oh
your majesty
love the outfit
very retro
we were all wearing those in london
when was it last year or the year before
lord buckingham i trust your journey
wasnt too uncomfortable
not at all no
on the contrary
handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven
cardinal
of course being a servant of god
you have no need for such crude devices
king james is most eager
to hear your peace proposal
lord buckingham
anne
your majesty
i must say your beauty is far more radiant
than i remember
youve met before
a long time ago
an evening i shall cherish forever
right well shall we
now this is a pleasant surprise
another acquaintance of yours i see
weve met yes
as i recall last i saw you
you were on your knees as well
most unfortunate habit
its a habit i shall have to break
during our next encounter
i look forward to it
in the meantime shall we talk peace
you must pass me the name
of your interior decorator
wine
i dont drink
what about that rather nice bottle of
bordeaux in your middle lefthand drawer
you must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace
and yours in mine
england cannot afford a war on two fronts
both our nations
are stretched to breaking point
a peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage
whose advantage yours
ours
i have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance
very impressive
and march
left left left right left
hold your line
halt
about face
stay where you are
this is the queens wing
you cant be up here
oh thank goodness
i got so lost i took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me
ive been trapped up here in the sun
in this heat
its going to be all right
oh im gonna faint
youre in safe hands
thank you
and march
halt
you cant shoot theyll hear you
shh
wait for it
left left
constance constance
hey hey excuse me
pardon your majesty
this will only take a moment
what are you doing here
his majesty wants a word with me
imagine that
yes lovely now excuse me
i was
i was thinking after im finished
with his majesty maybe we could talk
i cant i have plans
what about tomorrow
i have a lot of plans
well i
look dartagnan
you may have a new set of clothes
and the kings favor
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy
now excuse me
and halt
about face
and march
left left right left
two summons in two days
your majesty honors me
cut it out
please think nothing of it
youre a good fellow dartagnan
so how are the ladies
treating you these days
cant complain
yes indeed
well same here of course thing is
ive got this friend
just a regular chap like you and me
he got married very young
political alliance arranged marriage
you know the sort of thing
hardly knew the girl
but he likes her
oh yes
mmmhmm
very much
well does she like him
well funny you should say that
thats the problem
hes hes not sure
well he just feels like a fool
when hes around her
hes always saying the wrong thing
his palms are sweating
his hearts pumping so loud
hes afraid she might hear it
its torture just to look at her
have you ever felt this way
not until recently
so what do we do
i mean my friend what does he do
he should speak his heart
be someone who cares for her
and isnt afraid to show it
be himself
well thats what i told him
well then hes doubly lucky
after all he does have
your majesty as a friend
yes yes its good to have friends
will you excuse me just for one moment
i dont believe it
how are you
very well
im wearing blue
and you look very handsome in it
thank you yes i
youre looking just very lovely
in fact i was only just remarking
to dartagnan how
how beautiful you are
thank you my lord
how did it go
clockwork
good
youll go back to london
with buckingham and the diamonds
and what should i do with them
put them in his personal vault
the most secure location in all of england
the tower of london
yup
when the scandal breaks
hell deny everything
but once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession
he would have led england to war
through his indiscretion
and what of the future of france
i am france
one last thing
i suppose its quite easy
perhaps even tempting
for a double agent to play both sides
have i given your eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty
spare me the rhetoric
i know who you are i know what you are
you have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal
i admire such skills
but ill destroy you the moment i suspect
you might be using them against me
do we understand one another
there
is another side to that coin
its quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative
in the event that they are compromised
leaving them to
rot in jail or on the gallows
your point being
i require a guarantee
that i shall not suffer a similar fate
an insurance policy if you will
my word should suffice
im afraid ill need something a bit more
substantial
it is by my order
and for the good of the state
that the bearer of this
has done what has been done
satisfied
immensely
your majesty
purple
fashion favors the bold
here
try this for size
oh well
do give my regards to the queen
i will convey your diplomatic proposal
to king james immediately
cardinal richelieu a pleasure
all mine
your eminence
richelieu
richelieu
there has been
the most distressing development
certain letters
love letters were discovered
in the queens possession
letters from him
buckingham of course who else
have you spoken to the queen
about these letters
no of course i havent
shell just deny the whole thing
hmm
i can see your majestys dilemma
is there any mention
of a specific encounter a detail
a token of affection perhaps
yes
yes there is
a necklace the one i gave her
for our anniversary here
i shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me
the proof of our consummated love
does consummated mean
what i think it means
yes im afraid it does
oh my god
all your majesty has to do is throw a ball
what how would that help
lt would give your majesty the pretext
to suggest to the queen
that she wear your gift
oh richelieu thats very clever
thats very clever
so if she has the diamonds
your majesty can rest easy
and if she doesnt
he wants to have a celebration ball
five days from now
send my diamonds to the jewelers
to be polished
i want the kings undivided attention
that evening
i hope i am not interrupting
hardly your majesty to what do i owe
i know
perhaps your majesty
would care to be a bit more specific
i know
yeah
i assume this is the part
where im supposed to laugh maniacally
and regale your majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot
however i regret to inform your majesty
that i have no idea of
what youre talking about
i thought youd say that
then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit
to look into your eyes when you said it
your majesty
all may not be lost yet
coming coming
hold your horses
its not a matter of
life or death you know
actually it is
you want me to go to england
retrieve the diamonds
which the queen suspects
might be in buckinghams possession
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified
highly impregnable facility
the tower of london
since the cardinals spies
are trying to implicate the duke
it is the most logical choice
then return to paris
with every soldier assassin
mercenary bounty hunter
on both sides of the channel
out to stop me from doing so
did i miss anything
all in five days
a minor detail anything else
no
well i really only have
one question for you
why in the world would i do that
england it is
diamonds buckingham
tower of london five days
queens reputation
and the fate of france as we know it
whos with me
well i should imagine
the queen would be quite generous
count porthos hmm what do you think
got a nice ring to it doesnt it
besides i hear the english women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne
ice on the outside
but once you warm them up
this isnt a great cause
but itll have to do
buckinghams there so is she
who
countess de winter
charlotte backson
anne de breuil lady clarick
milady
milady
i know her i saw her with rochefort
shes switched sides again
shes working for the cardinal no doubt
what are you going to do if you catch her
musketeers open up
and surrender by order of the cardinal
you were followed
its rochefort
athos porthos aramis and dartagnan
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you
the moment they step out
kill them
light the torches
ill count to five then
well burn you out
one
two
three
oh sorry didnt see you there
damn you
fire
let me guess
youve come to tell me
that the musketeers are dead
our plan is proceeding on schedule
and i have absolutely positively
nothing to worry about
we were taken by surprise your eminence
somehow i was laboring
under the assumption
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise
was it not
eminence
yes you are quite fond of that word
arent you
sadly repeating it
doesnt get you into my good graces
alert milady watch the ports
no one is to leave for england
without my official permission
post a bounty on their heads
the bigger the better
yes your eminence
rochefort
do not fail me again
jussac and a lot of help
theres no way past
how the hell did he get here so fast
now what
we need a distraction
ill go
ill go
i could go
probably not
wrong
wrong on all counts
youll need every sword where youre going
i cant help you there but i can help
right here right now
if they catch you
they wont
if they catch you
im the queens ladyinwaiting
you on the other hand
are a wanted fugitive
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in england
which one of us should be worried
go
go so that you can come back
now give me that hat
dartagnan
get after him
wait
the diamonds will be
in buckinghams personal vault
located in the lowest most secure level
of the tower next to the crown jewels
the lock is state of the art
lt requires a key that buckingham
carries on his person at all times
corridor leading up to it is boobytrapped
oh im glad thats straightforward
tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese if you
you hadnt finished the briefing actually
im so sorry
please dont tell me off
then it gets worse a lot worse
we have to cross three stone walls
and a moat
and theres just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers
with a predilection for not being robbed
although since buckingham undoubtedly
knows were coming thanks to milady
that number is likely to be greater
and why cant we just tell
buckingham milady is plotting against him
because he wouldnt believe us
why should he were his sworn enemies
besides milady would have made sure
athos is coming
tell me
what do you suppose hes after
what does it matter
whatever it is its merely an excuse
he wants revenge for venice
he wants me
and he wants you
we shall have to be ready for him
wont we
we cant outshoot them
but we can outsmart them
hell naturally favor
misdirection and deception
he knows were expecting him
but that just ups the ante
she knows us
what we look like how we move
how we think
hell divide his forces independent teams
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances
there are four of us so we use
well theres five of
us actually if you
hes a skilled diver hell take the
aquatic route through the traitors gate
aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth
check every tower every rooftop
porthos on the other hand
will employ brute strength
one of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition
all the more reason
to take none of them alive
one more thing
they may try and drive a wedge between us
claim to have secret information
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another
like say im a double agent
working for the cardinal
or youre looking to get rid of me
i assure you
nothing could be further from the truth
although
i suppose i should
search you for concealed weapons
thats how its done
and thats exactly what shell expect
so we do the unexpected
we go in broad daylight
one man hiding in plain sight
with all the extra security therell be
a lot of new faces thats their weakness
and you dartagnan youre the wild card
we are the decoys
now well try and create a distraction
keep them occupied
keep them away from you
as much as possible
but ultimately its down to you
you wanted to be a musketeer
you want to serve france
this is your chance
left right left right left
i thought you saw the signal
i saw you waving like an idiot
well that was the bloody signal
im trying to see things
from your point of view
but unfortunately
i cant get my head that far up my ass
up your ass ill tell you what
yes
thats enough of that
finally good
at last a peace officer
now listen sergeant
i would like you to arrest this man
arrest me
you cant arrest me
dont you tell me that
ive lost my prized bantam
bantams they are rotten
they are not rotten
sir the first of the musketeers
has been arrested
the game is afoot
bring him to me and double the guards
double the troops
double everything
sir
theyll come to us
well then
i think your lordship
has everything under control
you wont mind if i dont stay
to see how it all turns out
do you think i might lose
on the contrary
i have no issues with you killing athos
but if its all the same to you
id rather not watch him die
tell me whats your favorite color
red
why
i wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth
hmm
as far from here as possible
well well well
look at what the cat dragged in
so hows the old athos eh
still his surly
insufferable self im sure
sending a boy to do a mans job
i should feel insulted
well what were you after anyway eh
secrets spies its all a game really
although the price of loss
as youll come to discover
is a little bit higher
what
no last words
no insults
pleas for mercy or
what time is it
about 200 id say
why are you in a hurry
look out of the window
they werent the decoys i was
ahhh
permission to come aboard
granted
athos
the wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent captain rochefort
is that hes always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated
eminence
the pride of victory
without the risk of loss
i trust you didnt come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship
no your eminence i have some good news
such as
so what about the diamonds
doesnt buckingham still have them
nope
milady likes hedging her bets
shed never have taken the chance
wed actually succeed
in breaking into the vault
so where are they now
with the only person she trusts
which means weve lost her
and all this has been for nothing
i wouldnt say that
you were the decoy we were the extraction
but the real linchpin of the plan well
that was someone else entirely
someone even milady would never suspect
driver what the hell is going on
just following your instructions maam
as far away from here as possible
whoohoo
planchet never thought
id hear myself say this but
well done
thank you sir
that means a lot
especially coming from you
shut up planchet
yes sir
dont
we took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder
what now
you give me the diamonds
or i take them off your corpse
dealers choice
anything else youd like me to take off
outside
boys
been a while
this must be the young gascon
weve met before
ah yes
small world
i didnt let rochefort kill you
you do remember that dont you
did you kill buckingham
no
but you will kill me
yes
you would spare him but kill me
yes i dont hate buckingham
here
you may find use for this
move
athos
at least she died the way she lived
on her own terms
she did it for me
i wouldnt have been able to live
with myself had i pulled the trigger
come on lets go home
but i cant get it
how marvelous
oh so great
oh
your majesty
my dear
you look troubled
hardly your majesty just startled me
oh im so sorry
i just wanted to drop by
and tell you how much
i was looking forward to tonight
should be quite spectacular you know
costumes fireworks and such
but you
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all
and especially since
youll wear the diamonds
you will wear them wont you
well its very important
to me that you do
then i shall wear them your majesty
until tonight then
she promised shell wear them
you do think shell wear them
dont you richelieu
im sure she will your majesty
im sure she will
i hate air travel
damn
hard to starboard
well now that we have their attention
lets see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner
more or less
ah gascon
so youve traded up
when it comes to transport
but once again youre outmatched
you can thank milady for that
she passed on buckinghams plans
a long time ago
as you can see
we made some improvements
isnt she a beauty
what do you want
the diamonds
come and take them
gladly
you see i can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity
if you fire on me on the other hand
youll be killing
miss ohsoyoungandpretty
you have 60 seconds
hell shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds
we cant outrun them
and we cant fight them damn it we cant
oh dartagnan
what
do you think
you have the monopoly on loss
what if she dies
the life of one woman
or the future of france
what would you do
if you were in my position
ive made a lot of sacrifices
a lot of hard choices
for honor for king for country
you wanna know what ive learned boy
hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night
life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side
dont end up like me
choose the woman
fight for love dartagnan
france will take care of itself
times up
an exchange
i go aboard your ship with the diamonds
the girl comes aboard ours
once i know shes safe
i give them to you
fine but i want to see the diamonds first
planchet
cut her loose
deploy the gangway
deploy the gangway
satisfied
you never learn do you
fire
hard right
fire
good
i really want you to see this
finish them off
we cant outrun them
and we cant outgun them
we could try asking them to surrender
but somehow i dont think it would work
we hide in there
fire
fire
lay in a pursuit course
lay in a pursuit course
fire
hes persistent ill give him that
fire
but sir we cant go into the storm
anyone
anyone else who wants to question orders
good
sir now might be a good time
to talk about the possibility of a raise
shut up planchet
yes sir
where are they
youre never gonna find them in there
i beg to differ
keep after them
ill take the gascon
hard to starboard
you know what your problem is boy
you read too many books
and then you believed them
courage honor
all for one
but history isnt written by heroes
its written by victors
keep your eyes open
round two
oh
return fire
pull up damn it
were too heavy
you scared to take me in a fair fight
hardly
i just dont fight fair
captain rochefort
oh well
drop the ballast
drop everything
and fire up the burners
over the side
drop those barrels
faster move
shall we
hold on
get out of the way
go run
i still have the diamonds
what do you propose to do about that
kill you
if you insist
oh
you shouldve stayed in gascony boy
you shouldve apologized to my horse
surround the palace
shoot the musketeers on sight
use every man at your disposal
any means necessary
your eminence
dont interrupt
these men must not
arrest these men
what is the meaning of this
your majesty these men
are delivering a gift for your majesty
compliments of the cardinal
cardinal you shouldnt have
well your majesty did ask me
to get you one of those so
so i did
but what happened to it
buckinghams spy rochefort
attempted to sabotage the craft
hes been dealt with
rochefort
hes captain of your guards isnt he
actually
his eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor
lt is by my order
and for the good of the state
that the bearer of this
has done what has been done
thats your signature isnt it richelieu
it would appear so your majesty
well let me get this right
you brought me an airship
and exposed a snake in our midst
how can i ever repay you
i could think of a few ways
anne
i was just returning from the jewelers
well i realize its a little early
but the orchestras here and so are we
would your majesty care to dance
i would love to
well mind out you fellows
dartagnan
well well well
looks like you arent the only one
who gets the girl
your majesty is a natural
guess i am
as a matter of fact
i think youll start noticing
a few more changes around here
thank you
for everything
any time
well strike up then
your majesty
positions please gentlemen
wellplayed
i could use men like you
i already have a job
im a drunk
im independently wealthy
thanks but no
the day will come
when youll wish you had said yes
maybe
but not today
maybe not today
enjoying the show
are you always this cocky
only on tuesdays
and whenever beautiful women are involved
so you think im beautiful
actually its tuesday
so what now
we drink
and then what
wherever they send us
whatever france needs
i thought you didnt believe
in that stuff anymore
i believe in us
till the day i stop believing that
there are still things in this world
worth fighting and dying for
all for one
and one for all
you know sirs
i know you can be mean tough
foultempered bastards
but sometimes i get the feeling
that deep down youre all
shut up planchet
yeah yeah of course
in case youre wondering
this isnt the afterlife
im not dead
and neither are you
what
how did you
followed athos
we fished you out of the channel
where are we going
to france of course
sail away
to get back whats mine
and pay back with interest
roll ballast
when we were young
the world seemed so old
careless and cold
we did what we were told in our lives
when we were young
had the world by the tail
good would prevail
starships would sail
and none of us would fail in this life
not when youre young
we were drawn to whoever
could keep us together
and bound by the heavens above
and we tried to survive
traveling at the speed of love
whoaohoh when we were young
when we adored the fabulous
whoaohoh when we were young
we were the foolish fearless
never knowing the cost of what we paid
letting someone else be strong
whoaohoh when we were young
in a moment of grace
a long leap of faith
the still more glorious
dawn awaits my life
im here with the lovers
and we burned the bridges
were crossing over
just to see the firelight
and the innocent are getting over
being old tonight
whoaohoh when we were young
when everything was what it seemed
whoaohoh when we were young
and every day was how we dreamed
never knowing the cost of what we paid
letting someone else be strong
whoaohoh when we were young
and when you look at yourself tonight
are you someone you recognize
you can take back what youve given away
but it must be the last time
