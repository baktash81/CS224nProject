the young king louis xiii
ascends to the french throne 
his once peaceful nation
is surrounded by enemies on all sides 
within the borders of france itself 
cardinal richelieu  the king s advisor 
plots in secret to seize power for himself 
the inexperienced louis
and his new bride  queen anne 
find themselves without a single friend 
europe is a powder keg waiting to explode
in a war that will engulf
the entire continent 
and only a few men
can prevent the coming apocalypse 
move out 
halt 
don t 
getting careless 
the feeling is mutual 
for future reference   i love you 
would have been a more suitable reply 
could have just said   hello  
what would be the fun in that 
  how was the bishop 
  not as good as you 
you are incorrigible 
i bet you say that to all the girls 
but  sir  remember i am a lady 
let me touch your bosom 
sir  keep your hands to yourself 
hallowed be thy name 
thy kingdom come 
thy will be done  on earth
as it is in heaven 
give us this day our daily bread 
and forgive us our trespasses 
as we forgive those
who trespass against us 
amen 
that s enough wine  i can assure   
  what 
  key 
you mean this key 
who are you 
  i m not a priest 
  i m not really a lady 
i have 1 0 minutes 
  there once was an aunt from lorraine 
  with an incredible tolerance for pain 
  she had a nasty habit
  involving a chicken  a frog  and a rabbit
i expected more
from a man of your reputation 
i don t suppose you have any idea
where i could find athos and aramis 
never heard of them 
you french spies 
you re very  very arrogant  and foolish 
and you re so   
sexy 
it s a wonder it took me so long
to catch you 
you didn t 
i beg your pardon 
you didn t catch me 
and what exactly are you doing here 
catching you 
key 
vive la france 
da vinci s vault 
leonardo designed it to protect
the plans of his greatest inventions 
shall we 
now 
your part s done  why don t you stay back 
we ll meet at the rally point 
we came together 
we leave together 
i ll go 
wait  wait 
too easy 
  pressure plates under the floor 
  oh 
  i could scale the walls 
  run a cable along the roof 
  could be booby trapped  too 
  hmm 
well  we don t have all night 
you re absolutely certain
there are no hidden passages 
and no secret tunnels 
positive  sir  it s a vault 
one way in  one way out 
excellent  i want these musketeers dead 
i want them dead 
the guards change in two minutes 
maybe less 
less 
what now 
  c est la vie 
  no 
contingency plan 
got it 
athos  you do know what s up there 
just hold your breath 
get out 
hey  get back down there  now 
go ahead  say it 
i love you 
i hate to ruin the mood 
but perhaps we could go elsewhere 
you know  for once i think
the padre may be right 
all for one 
and one for all 
so  what s next 
back to paris  i guess 
and then what 
wherever they send us 
whatever france needs 
it s who we are  it s what we do 
i do love you 
i know 
then please try and understand
that this isn t personal 
it s strictly business 
he made me a better offer 
ah  athos 
buckingham 
a toxin 
in case you were wondering  it wasn t
in your drink  it was on your cup 
inactive until it came into contact
with the liquid 
don t worry 
lt isn t fatal 
although i suspect
a part of you wishes it was 
you take all the risk and i get the reward 
hardly seems fair 
well  just so you don t leave empty handed 
a word of advice 
trust no one  especially women 
you ll live longer 
telling him you loved him
right before you betrayed him 
i must say  that was cruel 
even by my standards 
i only took away his prize 
you took a lot more than that 
at last  the war machine 
look down 
it s a trick an old friend taught me 
your adversary will not always be
as noble as you 
remember that 
and i have nothing left to teach you 
i doubt that  father 
keep it 
it s passed down from generation
to generation  from father to son 
it s yours now 
the weapon of a musketeer 
the real weapon of a musketeer
is here 
all for one 
and one for all 
you remind me of somebody 
let me guess  you 
no  no 
the man i wish i was when i was your age 
well  you should really be on your way 
take this purse  there s 1 5 crowns in it 
it s enough to get you to paris 
and you ll need a mount 
your mother s insisting you take buttercup 
  i know it s not much  and   
  it s plenty 
take care of yourself  my son 
try not to get into any fights 
if i m to be a musketeer  i think i might
have to do a little bit of fighting 
stay at the back if you can 
yes  mother 
  there s one more piece of advice 
  i know  i know  don t get into any trouble 
wrong 
get into trouble 
make mistakes 
fight  love  live 
and remember  always 
you re a gascon and our son 
now go  go 
in the name of god 
what kind of beast is that 
and the beast he s riding
doesn t look much either 
  ostler 
  sir 
  please see that my horse is watered and fed 
  oh 
it s a horse  is it 
my friends here thought it was a cow 
excuse me 
see  i know you men
are just kidding around 
buttercup 
well  she gets a little sensitive 
i m afraid i must ask you to apologize 
well  i m afraid i m not in the habit
of apologizing to gascon yokels 
not to me 
to my horse 
you ve hurt her feelings 
and if i don t 
i shall have to kill you 
you shot me 
most observant of you  young man 
but the real question is 
why are you not dead 
flesh wound 
sight must be off 
who takes care of my pistols 
captain rochefort  i   
whoa  whoa  steady 
wouldn t want to dirty my blade
with peasant blood 
so  boy 
consider this a lesson 
your last 
no 
he s too pretty for that 
as you wish  milady 
rochefort  come 
we re expected in paris 
thank you 
make way 
i think you ve had enough 
where s my tankard 
excuse me 
you think you re better than me 
no 
watch yourself  boy 
all for one 
excuse me 
  sorry  i m sorry 
  are you blind 
look  i m chasing after a man
who insulted my horse
and tried to kill me  so let me go 
that s not good enough 
you spilled my drink and ruined my shirt 
i m in a hurry 
  here 
  1 0 sous 
  who do you think you re talking to 
  the town drunk  from the smell of you 
now that  my boy  is fighting talk 
  what are you saying exactly 
  blind and deaf 
fortunately for you 
i m somewhat of a doctor 
great  when can you fit me in 
12 00  cooper s yard  st  germain 
i ll be there 
excuse me 
i just can t decide 
well  if i might point out 
this does make you look very dignified 
whereas the blue one
brings out your dashing side 
equally important 
dignified  dashing 
in the words of king
solomon  i ll take both 
a most excellent choice  sir 
darling  you spoil me 
i don t know how i shall ever repay you 
  watch yourself 
  my apologies 
matter of life and death  won t happen
again  believe you dropped this 
this isn t mine 
i saw the lady hand this to you 
i m not blind 
are you implying that
i take money from this woman 
are you saying that i cannot afford to pay
for my own wardrobe 
do you know who i am 
no 
then we re even 
you re in luck  boy 
ordinarily  i would slaughter you on the
spot  but this is a brand new jacket 
cooper s yard  st  germain  1 00 
i suggest you dress for a funeral 
what 
  lottery 
  there you go 
lottery ticket  sir 
might be your lucky day 
what the hell 
5 francs 
hey  hey 
what is this 
it s a citation 
it s a ticket 
failure to remove animal bowel movements
from public area 
french 
your horse took a dump on the street 
you re joking 
that s what they all say 
you know what 
cooper s yard  st  germain  2 00 
strange boy 
milady de winter 
close game  your eminence 
  hmm 
  who s the opponent 
myself  no one else proved to be
a sufficient challenge 
hmm 
what news of england 
he s coming 
  buckingham 
  hmm 
and   
and 
he built it 
the war machine 
and he doesn t question your loyalty 
he thinks he s so cunning 
so evil 
evil is just a point of view 
ah 
richelieu 
is this lady the emissary from england 
your majesty is exceptionally alert 
so  madam 
what of buckingham 
majesty 
well  what s he wearing these days 
green  your majesty 
  green 
  hmm 
very interesting 
and you had the gall to recommend blue 
of course it should be green 
why am i surrounded
by incompetent idiots 
green  green  green 
do i have to do everything myself 
ah 
there you are  shall we get to it 
so  are you eager
to meet your maker 
i have other appointments 
you ll miss them  i m afraid 
well  i ll try my best to be on time 
my seconds 
you 
you re fighting this rascal 
my appointments 
1 00  2 00 
how long have you been in paris 
  arrived this morning 
  you have been busy 
patience is not one of my virtues 
well  neither are good manners 
wait for your turn  old man 
what would you like me to put
on your headstone   little shit  
d artagnan 
i m athos 
this is porthos and aramis 
the three musketeers 
i ve heard of you 
from my father  a musketeer himself 
in fact  i came to paris to be one of you 
i m afraid you re a little late 
what happened 
oh  a bad mission  budget cuts 
cardinal  progress 
take your pick 
well  then  welcome to paris 
pity we ll have to kill you 
well  if i can t become a musketeer 
i might as well fight one 
or three 
kill him already 
it s lunchtime and i m starving 
halt 
jussac 
well  well  well 
how the mighty have fallen 
dueling in defiance of the edicts 
you got tired of rolling peddlers
for spare change 
  now   
  seal the square 
surrender your weapons
and come along with us 
seal it off 
unless  of course  you would rather resist 
new plan 
kill the boy  kick their asses 
and then go get some lunch 
i could do with some exercise 
seal it off  boys 
you were saying 
on the other hand 
discretion is the better part of valor 
you re the musketeers 
wrong 
we were the musketeers 
now we re just   us 
rochefort 
shall we 
finish them off 
let s even the odds 
enjoying the show 
  you 
  watch out 
you didn t
answer my question 
are you always this cocky 
only on tuesdays
and whenever beautiful women are involved 
damn you 
can t you see
we re trying to have a conversation 
what is your name 
constance 
constance  sounds very steadfast 
a quality you seem to know little about 
oh  i beg to differ 
deep down  i am a hopeless romantic 
back for more 
musketeers  musketeers  musketeers 
i d forgotten what it feels like 
we all have 
the name is d artagnan 
you must come from a very small town 
how did you know 
lines like yours
might actually work there 
this is paris 
i suggest you stick to swordplay 
in the battle of wits 
you  sir  are unarmed 
she s right  lad 
the ladies of paris
are infinitely more complicated 
they have 1 000 ways of saying   no  
and only some of them mean   yes  
i hate to ruin the mood 
but they will be back 
and unless you wish to
fight an entire army 
elsewhere 
so  now what 
do we pick up where we left off 
i think there s been enough fighting
for one day 
besides  any man who s an enemy
of rochefort is a friend of mine 
who s rochefort 
captain of the cardinal s guards 
the right hand of the most powerful man
in france 
rochefort is the most feared swordsman
in europe 
you certainly know how to pick your fights 
like i said  he insulted my horse 
you re reckless 
arrogant  impetuous 
probably be dead by sundown 
but i like you  lad 
  where are you staying 
  no idea 
ah  do you have any money 
well  good sir 
you and your fine steed
are welcome in our humble home 
for the time being 
that goes in there 
come on 
what shall we drink to 
how about the king 
he s a child  cardinal rules in all
but name  might as well drink to him 
to france 
we served it  fought for it and bled for it 
look where it got us 
friendship  love 
word of advice  boy 
trust no one 
must be something you still believe in 
this 
and this 
anyone who tells you otherwise is either
a fool or trying to sell you something 
i know athos may seem cold and unfriendly 
but don t let it fool you 
  deep down   
  he really is cold and unfriendly 
what happened to him 
what happens to any man  a woman 
you know  i don t want to offend anybody 
but i thought you d all be
a little bit more   heroic 
what my esteemed colleague
was trying to say  in his own way 
is that we are obsolete 
we re warriors 
but there s no war for us to fight 
and so we drink and brawl
and quarrel with the cardinal s guards
and then we drink some more 
what we need is a great cause 
but there are no great causes left 
which is why i keep telling you it s not
too late to do that priest thing again 
beats working for the city 
free booze at wakes and weddings 
and then there s the nuns 
you were a priest 
until i realized being a man of god
and a man of the cloth
aren t always the same thing 
and yet  he still says prayers
for those he kills 
  old habit 
  on the contrary 
the men i kill deserve to die 
but they also deserve peace 
after all  they must have believed
in something 
we all do  even the worst of us 
i ll drink to that 
planchet  more wine 
planchet 
sorry  sirs 
i m afraid
there s none left  you ve drunk the lot 
what sort of answer s that 
well  go get some more  man 
very good  sir  it s just  i can t  sir 
we ve run out of money 
planchet  what are you 
  complete and utter waste of space  sir 
  and 
  as much use as a fart in a bottle  sir 
  right 
in short  sir  a total tit  sir 
but i can t work bleeding miracles 
planchet 
oh 
thank you very much  sir 
that s incredibly generous
from such a handsome  young man 
thank you very  very much 
will you be staying here tonight 
he ll be taking your bed  planchet 
right  and so i ll be sleeping   
you may take the balcony 
outside  the balcony outside in the cold 
with birds shitting on my head all night 
great  can i just say you   
wine  wine 
  wine  wine  wine  wine 
  yes  of course  wine it is  sirs 
check 
this is a ridiculous game 
surely the king
should be the most powerful piece 
the king is the most important piece 
but he s vulnerable  he needs protection 
may i suggest you castle him 
checkmate 
there  what do you think of that 
your majesty is a force of nature 
  took you by surprise  eh 
  yes  indeed  you did 
may we speak a little about foreign policy 
  it s not about buckingham  is it 
  oh  i m afraid it is 
he s arriving in paris tomorrow 
his master  king james  has agreed
to hear our peace proposal 
good  good  well  he knows better
than to mess with me  then 
there s also another matter 
a dangerous rivalry has sprung
between your majesty s musketeers
and my personal guards 
who was involved 
athos  porthos  aramis 
the usual suspects 
and a young man called d artagnan 
i have summoned them to the palace so that
your majesty can punish them severely 
his majesty  the king 
well  well  well 
brawling with the cardinal s guards 
that s very bad 
what have you got to say for yourselves 
  we   
  humbly beg your pardon  your majesty 
yes 
yes  i should hope so  too 
so  tell me  how many
were involved in the altercation 
there were four of us against 40 of them 
your majesty 
four against 40 
and you beat them like a drum 
and  yes  you shall have to be reprimanded 
of course 
most harshly  i m afraid 
  you do understand that  don t you 
  we do  your majesty 
her majesty  the queen 
anne 
what a    what a pleasant surprise 
my ladies and i wanted to see
the valiant musketeers
who stood against the cardinal s guards 
four against 40 
or was it 400 
just 40  your majesty 
lt was an off day 
that s my musketeers for you 
by the time they write songs about them 
it ll be 4 000 
i hope you won t be too harsh with them 
after all  boys will be boys 
you must be d artagnan 
my lady in waiting has told me about
how brave and dashing you were yesterday 
but you must try not to be so reckless 
can t help myself  your majesty 
  your majesty  the culprits 
  ah  yes  yes 
well  stand up  then 
athos 
porthos 
aramis 
forgive me for saying this  d artagnan 
but you do look a little underdressed 
my father is a poor man  your majesty 
a former musketeer as well 
these are the only clothes i have 
oh  lord 
we shall have to rectify that 
can t have my musketeers 
or the son of one  looking like tramps 
new suits all around  i think 
yes  you ll see to that  cardinal 
and  yes  i think a purse of gold for each
as a reward for your courage 
you ll see to that as well  cardinal 
and  yes  before i forget 
no more fighting
with his eminence s guards 
hmm 
or there ll be none of them left 
your majesty  might i suggest a more   
forgive my impudence  cardinal 
but i doubt the king
requires your advice in this matter 
after all  they are his musketeers 
good day  gentlemen 
well  now 
off with you rascals 
but be there for the parade tomorrow 
new suits and all 
i tire of these royal children 
it s time to make our move 
we shall use buckingham s arrival
to our advantage 
during his visit  we will reveal
that he arranged a secret rendezvous
with the queen 
may i inquire how your eminence
has uncovered this scandalous affair 
by reading buckingham s letters
to the queen  found in her possession 
written in buckingham s hand 
then authenticated by his seal 
a woman of your talents
should have no trouble procuring either 
hmm  your eminence is too kind 
however  i doubt that the king
will accept such letters
as definitive proof of
his wife s indiscretion 
then we shall provide him
with something a bit more substantial 
a piece of the queen s jewelry given
to buckingham as a token of affection 
buckingham will be humiliated 
the king will be outraged 
the queen will be executed 
france will have no
choice but to go to war 
and in times like these  france will
naturally turn to a stronger leader 
someone better equipped to rule a nation
than a cuckolded teenager with a grudge 
hmm 
someone like your eminence 
about face 
well  where is he  then 
it s just appalling manners 
drop anchor 
anchor aweigh 
damn his impudence 
what is that thing called
anyway  richelieu 
an airship  your majesty 
  why don t i have one of those 
  an oversight on our part 
right  right  well  build me one 
secure the lines 
all lines secured 
buckingham 
blue 
oh 
your majesty 
love the outfit 
very retro 
we were all wearing those in london 
when was it  last year or the year before 
lord buckingham  i trust your journey
wasn t too uncomfortable 
not at all  no 
on the contrary 
handles like a dream and keeps me
one step closer to heaven 
cardinal 
of course  being a servant of god 
you have no need for such crude devices 
king james is most eager
to hear your peace proposal 
  lord buckingham 
  anne 
your majesty 
i must say your beauty is far more radiant
than i remember 
you ve met before 
a long time ago 
an evening i shall cherish forever 
right  well  shall we 
now this is a pleasant surprise 
another acquaintance of yours  i see 
we ve met  yes 
as i recall  last i saw you 
you were on your knees as well 
most unfortunate habit 
it s a habit i shall have to break
during our next encounter 
i look forward to it 
in the meantime  shall we talk peace 
you must pass me the name
of your interior decorator 
wine 
i don t drink 
what about that rather nice bottle of
bordeaux in your middle left hand drawer 
you must pass me the name
of your spy in the palace 
and yours in mine 
england cannot afford a war on two fronts 
both our nations
are stretched to breaking point 
a peace treaty would be
of immense strategic advantage 
whose advantage  yours 
ours 
i have a feeling my new war machines
will readdress the balance 
very impressive 
and march 
left  left  left  right  left 
hold your line 
halt 
about face 
stay where you are 
this is the queen s wing 
you can t be up here 
oh  thank goodness 
i got so lost  i took a wrong turn
and then a door slammed behind me 
i ve been trapped up here  in the sun 
in this heat 
  it s going to be all right 
  oh  i m gonna faint 
  you re in safe hands 
  thank you 
and march 
halt 
you can t shoot  they ll hear you 
shh 
wait for it 
left  left 
constance  constance 
hey  hey  excuse me 
pardon  your majesty 
this will only take a moment 
what are you doing here 
his majesty wants a word with me 
imagine that 
yes  lovely  now  excuse me 
i was   
i was thinking  after i m finished
with his majesty  maybe we could talk 
i can t  i have plans 
what about tomorrow 
i have a lot of plans 
  well  i   
  look  d artagnan 
you may have a new set of clothes
and the king s favor 
but you still act like
a clumsy country boy 
now excuse me 
and halt 
about face 
and march 
left  left  right  left 
two summons in two days 
your majesty honors me 
cut it out 
please  think nothing of it 
you re a good fellow  d artagnan 
so  how are the ladies
treating you these days 
  can t complain 
  yes  indeed 
well  same here  of course  thing is   
i ve got this friend 
just a regular chap  like you and me 
he got married very young 
political alliance  arranged marriage 
you know the sort of thing 
hardly knew the girl 
  but he likes her 
  oh  yes 
mmm hmm 
very much 
well  does she like him 
well  funny you should say that 
that s the problem 
he s    he s not sure 
well  he just feels like a fool
when he s around her 
he s always saying the wrong thing 
his palms are sweating 
his heart s pumping so loud
he s afraid she might hear it 
it s torture just to look at her 
  have you ever felt this way 
  not until recently 
so  what do we do 
i mean  my friend  what does he do 
he should speak his heart 
be someone who cares for her
and isn t afraid to show it 
be himself 
well  that s what i told him 
well  then he s doubly lucky 
after all  he does have
your majesty as a friend 
yes  yes  it s good to have friends 
will you excuse me just for one moment 
i don t believe it 
how are you 
very well 
i m wearing blue 
and you look very handsome in it 
thank you  yes  i   
you re looking just very lovely 
in fact  i was only just remarking
to d artagnan how   
how beautiful you are 
thank you  my lord 
  how did it go 
  clockwork 
good 
you ll go back to london
with buckingham and the diamonds 
and what should i do with them 
put them in his personal vault 
the most secure location in all of england 
  the tower of london 
  yup 
when the scandal breaks 
he ll deny everything 
but once the diamonds
are discovered in his possession   
he would have led england to war
through his indiscretion 
and what of the future of france 
i am france 
one last thing 
i suppose it s quite easy 
perhaps even tempting 
for a double agent to play both sides 
have i given your eminence
any reason to doubt my loyalty 
spare me the rhetoric 
i know who you are  i know what you are 
you have a gift for corruption
and a penchant for betrayal 
i admire such skills 
but i ll destroy you the moment i suspect
you might be using them against me 
do we understand one another 
there
is another side to that coin 
it s quite easy for an employer
to sever all ties with his operative 
in the event that they are compromised 
leaving them to
rot in jail or on the gallows 
your point being 
i require a guarantee
that i shall not suffer a similar fate 
an insurance policy  if you will 
my word should suffice 
i m afraid i ll need something a bit more
substantial 
 it is by my order
and for the good of the state
 that the bearer of this
has done what has been done  
satisfied 
immensely 
your majesty 
purple 
fashion favors the bold 
here 
try this for size 
oh  well 
do give my regards to the queen 
i will convey your diplomatic proposal
to king james immediately 
cardinal richelieu  a pleasure 
all mine 
your eminence 
richelieu 
richelieu 
there has been
the most distressing development 
certain letters 
love letters  were discovered
in the queen s possession 
letters from him 
buckingham  of course  who else 
have you spoken to the queen
about these letters 
no  of course i haven t 
she ll just deny the whole thing 
hmm 
i can see your majesty s dilemma 
is there any mention
of a specific encounter  a detail 
  a token of affection  perhaps 
  yes 
yes  there is 
a necklace  the one i gave her
for our anniversary  here 
 i shall always cherish
the 1 2 studded diamonds you gave me 
 the proof of our consummated love  
does  consummated  mean
what i think it means 
yes  i m afraid it does 
oh  my god 
all your majesty has to do is throw a ball 
what  how would that help 
lt would give your majesty the pretext
to suggest to the queen
that she wear your gift 
oh  richelieu  that s very clever 
that s very clever 
so  if she has the diamonds   
your majesty can rest easy 
and if she doesn t 
he wants to have a celebration ball 
five days from now 
send my diamonds to the jeweler s
to be polished 
i want the king s undivided attention
that evening 
i hope i am not interrupting 
hardly  your majesty  to what do i owe   
i know 
perhaps your majesty
would care to be a bit more specific 
i know 
yeah 
i assume this is the part
where i m supposed to laugh maniacally
and regale your majesty with the details
of some diabolical plot 
however  i regret to inform your majesty
that i have no idea of
what you re talking about 
i thought you d say that 
then why did you grace me
with the honor of your visit 
to look into your eyes when you said it 
your majesty 
all may not be lost yet 
coming  coming 
hold your horses 
it s not a matter of
life or death  you know 
actually  it is 
you want me to go to england 
retrieve the diamonds 
which the queen suspects
might be in buckingham s possession 
which will naturally involve breaking into
some heavily fortified 
highly impregnable facility 
the tower of london 
since the cardinal s spies
are trying to implicate the duke 
it is the most logical choice 
then return to paris
with every soldier  assassin 
mercenary  bounty hunter 
on both sides of the channel
out to stop me from doing so 
did i miss anything 
all in five days 
a minor detail  anything else 
no 
well  i really only have
one question for you 
why in the world would i do that 
england it is 
diamonds  buckingham 
tower of london  five days 
queen s reputation
and the fate of france as we know it 
who s with me 
well  i should imagine
the queen would be quite generous 
count porthos  hmm  what do you think 
got a nice ring to it  doesn t it 
besides  i hear the english women are a
lot like a frosted bottle of champagne 
ice on the outside 
but once you warm them up   
this isn t a great cause 
but it ll have to do 
buckingham s there  so is she 
who 
countess de winter 
charlotte backson 
anne de breuil  lady clarick 
milady 
milady 
i know her  i saw her with rochefort 
she s switched sides again 
she s working for the cardinal  no doubt 
what are you going to do if you catch her 
musketeers  open up
and surrender by order of the cardinal 
  you were followed 
  it s rochefort 
athos  porthos  aramis and d artagnan 
surrender your weapons
and no harm will come to you 
the moment they step out 
kill them 
light the torches 
i ll count to five  then
we ll burn you out 
one 
two 
three 
oh  sorry  didn t see you there 
damn you 
fire 
let me guess 
you ve come to tell me
that the musketeers are dead 
our plan is proceeding on schedule 
and i have absolutely  positively 
nothing to worry about 
we were taken by surprise  your eminence 
somehow i was laboring
under the assumption
that the plan was for you
to take them by surprise 
  was it not 
  eminence   
yes  you are quite fond of that word 
aren t you 
sadly  repeating it
doesn t get you into my good graces 
alert milady  watch the ports 
no one is to leave for england
without my official permission 
post a bounty on their heads 
the bigger  the better 
yes  your eminence 
rochefort 
do not fail me again 
jussac and a lot of help 
there s no way past 
how the hell did he get here so fast 
  now what 
  we need a distraction 
  i ll go 
  i ll go 
i could go 
probably not 
wrong 
wrong on all counts 
you ll need every sword where you re going 
i can t help you there  but i can help 
right here  right now 
  if they catch you   
  they won t 
  if they catch you   
  i m the queen s lady in waiting 
you  on the other hand 
are a wanted fugitive 
and about to steal
from the most powerful man in england 
which one of us should be worried 
go 
go so that you can come back 
now give me that hat 
d artagnan 
get after him 
wait 
the diamonds will be
in buckingham s personal vault 
located in the lowest  most secure level
of the tower  next to the crown jewels 
the lock is state of the art 
lt requires a key that buckingham
carries on his person at all times 
corridor leading up to it is booby trapped 
oh  i m glad that s straightforward 
tempt anyone
with some bread and cheese  if you   
you hadn t finished the briefing  actually 
i m so sorry 
please don t tell me off 
then it gets worse  a lot worse 
we have to cross three stone walls
and a moat 
and there s just a couple of hundred
highly trained soldiers
with a predilection for not being robbed 
although  since buckingham undoubtedly
knows we re coming  thanks to milady 
that number is likely to be greater 
and why can t we just tell
buckingham milady is plotting against him 
because he wouldn t believe us 
why should he  we re his sworn enemies 
besides  milady would have made sure 
athos is coming 
tell me 
what do you suppose he s after 
what does it matter 
whatever it is  it s merely an excuse 
he wants revenge for venice 
he wants me 
and he wants you 
we shall have to be ready for him 
won t we 
we can t outshoot them 
but we can outsmart them 
he ll naturally favor
misdirection and deception 
he knows we re expecting him 
but that just ups the ante 
she knows us 
what we look like  how we move 
how we think 
he ll divide his forces  independent teams 
each with their own point of entry
to maximize their chances 
there are four of us  so we use   
well  there s five of
us  actually  if you   
he s a skilled diver  he ll take the
aquatic route  through the traitor s gate 
aramis will undoubtedly rely
on agility and stealth 
check every tower  every rooftop 
porthos  on the other hand 
will employ brute strength 
one of his preferred methods
is getting captured by the opposition 
all the more reason
to take none of them alive 
one more thing 
they may try and drive a wedge between us 
claim to have secret information
about some plot to get us
to turn against one another 
like  say  i m a double agent
working for the cardinal
or you re looking to get rid of me 
i assure you 
nothing could be further from the truth 
although 
i suppose i should
search you for concealed weapons 
that s how it s done 
and that s exactly what she ll expect 
so we do the unexpected 
we go in broad daylight 
one man  hiding in plain sight 
with all the extra security  there ll be
a lot of new faces  that s their weakness 
and you  d artagnan  you re the wild card 
we are the decoys 
now we ll try and create a distraction 
keep them occupied 
keep them away from you
as much as possible 
but  ultimately  it s down to you 
you wanted to be a musketeer 
you want to serve france 
this is your chance 
left  right  left  right  left 
i thought you saw the signal 
  i saw you waving like an idiot 
  well  that was the bloody signal 
i m trying to see things
from your point of view 
but  unfortunately 
i can t get my head that far up my ass 
  up your ass  i ll tell you what   
  yes 
that s enough of that 
finally  good 
at last  a peace officer 
now listen  sergeant 
i would like you to arrest this man 
arrest me 
you can t arrest me 
don t you tell me that 
i ve lost my prized bantam 
  bantams  they are rotten 
  they are not rotten 
sir  the first of the musketeers
has been arrested 
the game is afoot 
bring him to me and double the guards 
double the troops 
double everything 
sir 
they ll come to us 
well  then 
i think your lordship
has everything under control 
you won t mind if i don t stay
to see how it all turns out 
  do you think i might lose 
  on the contrary 
i have no issues with you killing athos 
but  if it s all the same to you 
i d rather not watch him die 
tell me  what s your favorite color 
red 
why 
i wanted to see
if you were capable of telling the truth 
hmm 
as far from here as possible 
well  well  well 
look at what the cat dragged in 
so  how s the old athos  eh 
still his surly 
insufferable self  i m sure 
sending a boy to do a man s job 
i should feel insulted 
well  what were you after anyway  eh 
secrets  spies  it s all a game  really 
although the price of loss 
as you ll come to discover 
is a little bit higher 
what 
no last words 
no insults 
  pleas for mercy or   
  what time is it 
about 2 00  i d say 
why  are you in a hurry 
look out of the window 
they weren t the decoys  i was 
ahhh 
permission to come aboard 
granted 
athos 
the wonderful thing about fighting
an imaginary opponent  captain rochefort 
is that he s always greatly skilled
yet easily defeated 
eminence 
the pride of victory
without the risk of loss 
i trust you didn t come here to impress me
with your swordsmanship 
no  your eminence  i have some good news 
such as 
so what about the diamonds 
doesn t buckingham still have them 
nope 
milady likes hedging her bets 
she d never have taken the chance
we d actually succeed
in breaking into the vault 
so where are they now 
with the only person she trusts 
which means we ve lost her
and all this has been for nothing 
i wouldn t say that 
you were the decoy  we were the extraction 
but the real linchpin of the plan  well 
that was someone else entirely 
someone even milady would never suspect 
driver  what the hell is going on 
just following your instructions  ma am 
 as far away from here as possible  
whoo hoo 
planchet  never thought
i d hear myself say this  but
well done 
thank you  sir 
that means a lot 
especially coming from you 
shut up  planchet 
yes  sir 
don t 
we took the precaution
of removing the gunpowder 
what now 
you give me the diamonds
or i take them off your corpse 
dealer s choice 
  anything else you d like me to take off 
  outside 
boys 
been a while 
this must be the young gascon 
we ve met before 
ah  yes 
small world 
i didn t let rochefort kill you 
you do remember that  don t you 
  did you kill buckingham 
  no 
  but you will kill me 
  yes 
you would spare him  but kill me 
yes  i don t hate buckingham 
here 
you may find use for this 
move 
athos 
at least she died the way she lived 
on her own terms 
she did it for me 
i wouldn t have been able to live
with myself had i pulled the trigger 
come on  let s go home 
but i can t get it 
how marvelous 
oh  so great 
oh 
your majesty 
my dear 
you look troubled 
hardly  your majesty just startled me 
oh  i m so sorry 
i just wanted to drop by
and tell you how much
i was looking forward to tonight 
should be quite spectacular  you know 
costumes  fireworks and such 
but you 
you shall be
the most spectacular sight of all 
and especially since
you ll wear the diamonds 
you will wear them  won t you 
well  it s very important
to me that you do 
then i shall wear them  your majesty 
until tonight  then 
she promised she ll wear them 
you do think she ll wear them 
don t you  richelieu 
i m sure she will  your majesty 
i m sure she will 
i hate air travel 
damn 
hard to starboard 
well  now that we have their attention 
let s see if we can settle this
in a peaceful manner 
more or less 
ah  gascon 
so you ve traded up
when it comes to transport 
but  once again  you re outmatched 
you can thank milady for that 
she passed on buckingham s plans
a long time ago 
as you can see 
we made some improvements 
isn t she a beauty 
what do you want 
the diamonds 
  come and take them 
  gladly 
you see  i can blast you out of the sky
with total impunity 
if you fire on me  on the other hand 
you ll be killing
miss oh so young and pretty 
you have 60 seconds 
he ll shoot us down
the moment he has the diamonds 
we can t outrun them 
and we can t fight them  damn it  we can t 
  oh  d artagnan 
  what 
do you think
you have the monopoly on loss 
what if she dies 
the life of one woman
or the future of france 
what would you do
if you were in my position 
i ve made a lot of sacrifices 
a lot of hard choices 
for honor  for king  for country 
you wanna know what i ve learned  boy 
hard choices and sacrifices
do not keep you warm at night 
life is too damn short and too damn long
to go through without someone at your side 
don t end up like me 
choose the woman 
fight for love  d artagnan 
france will take care of itself 
time s up 
an exchange 
i go aboard your ship with the diamonds 
the girl comes aboard ours 
once i know she s safe 
i give them to you 
fine  but i want to see the diamonds first 
planchet 
cut her loose 
  deploy the gangway 
  deploy the gangway 
satisfied 
you never learn  do you 
fire 
hard right 
fire 
good 
i really want you to see this 
finish them off 
we can t outrun them
and we can t outgun them 
we could try asking them to surrender 
but somehow i don t think it would work 
we hide  in there 
fire 
fire 
lay in a pursuit course 
lay in a pursuit course 
fire 
he s persistent  i ll give him that 
fire 
but  sir  we can t go into the storm 
anyone 
anyone else who wants to question orders 
good 
sir  now might be a good time
to talk about the possibility of a raise 
shut up  planchet 
yes  sir 
where are they 
you re never gonna find them in there 
i beg to differ 
keep after them 
i ll take the gascon 
hard to starboard 
you know what your problem is  boy 
you read too many books 
and then you believed them 
courage  honor 
all for one 
but history isn t written by heroes 
it s written by victors 
keep your eyes open 
round two 
oh   
return fire 
pull up  damn it 
we re too heavy 
you scared to take me in a fair fight 
hardly 
i just don t fight fair 
captain rochefort 
oh  well 
drop the ballast 
drop everything 
and fire up the burners 
over the side 
drop those barrels 
faster  move 
shall we 
hold on 
get out of the way 
go  run 
i still have the diamonds 
what do you propose to do about that 
kill you 
if you insist 
oh 
you should ve stayed in gascony  boy 
you should ve apologized to my horse 
surround the palace 
shoot the musketeers on sight 
use every man at your disposal 
any means necessary 
  your eminence 
  don t interrupt 
these men must not   
arrest these men 
what is the meaning of this 
your majesty  these men   
are delivering a gift for your majesty 
compliments of the cardinal 
cardinal  you shouldn t have 
well  your majesty did ask me
to get you one of those  so   
so i did 
but what happened to it 
buckingham s spy  rochefort 
attempted to sabotage the craft 
  he s been dealt with 
  rochefort 
he s captain of your guards  isn t he 
actually 
his eminence was the one
who uncovered the traitor 
 lt is by my order
and for the good of the state
 that the bearer of this
has done what has been done  
  that s your signature  isn t it  richelieu 
  it would appear so  your majesty 
well  let me get this right 
you brought me an airship
and exposed a snake in our midst 
how can i ever repay you 
i could think of a few ways 
anne 
i was just returning from the jewelers 
well  i realize it s a little early 
but the orchestra s here and so are we 
would your majesty care to dance 
i would love to 
well  mind out  you fellows 
d artagnan 
well  well  well 
looks like you aren t the only one
who gets the girl 
your majesty is a natural 
guess i am 
as a matter of fact 
i think you ll start noticing
a few more changes around here 
thank you 
for everything 
any time 
well  strike up  then 
your majesty 
positions  please  gentlemen 
well played 
i could use men like you 
i already have a job 
  i m a drunk 
  i m independently wealthy 
thanks  but no 
the day will come
when you ll wish you had said   yes  
maybe 
but not today 
maybe not today 
enjoying the show 
are you always this cocky 
only on tuesdays
and whenever beautiful women are involved 
so you think i m beautiful 
actually  it s tuesday 
  so  what now 
  we drink 
and then what 
wherever they send us 
whatever france needs 
i thought you didn t believe
in that stuff anymore 
i believe in us 
till the day i stop believing that 
there are still things in this world
worth fighting and dying for 
all for one 
and one for all 
you know  sirs 
i know you can be mean  tough 
foul tempered bastards 
but sometimes i get the feeling
that deep down you re all   
shut up  planchet 
yeah  yeah  of course 
in case you re wondering 
this isn t the afterlife 
i m not dead 
and neither are you 
what 
how did you   
followed athos 
we fished you out of the channel 
  where are we going 
  to france  of course 
sail away 
to get back what s mine
and pay back  with interest 
roll ballast 
  when we were young
  the world seemed so old 
  careless and cold 
  we did what we were told in our lives 
  when we were young 
  had the world by the tail 
  good would prevail
  starships would sail 
  and none of us would fail in this life 
  not when you re young 
  we were drawn to whoever
  could keep us together 
  and bound by the heavens above 
  and we tried to survive 
  traveling at the speed of love 
  whoa oh oh  when we were young 
  when we adored the fabulous 
  whoa oh oh  when we were young 
  we were the foolish fearless 
  never knowing the cost of what we paid 
  letting someone else be strong 
  whoa oh oh  when we were young 
  in a moment of grace
  a long leap of faith 
  the still more glorious
dawn awaits my life 
  i m here with the lovers 
  and we burned the bridges
  we re crossing over 
  just to see the firelight 
  and the innocent are getting over
  being old tonight 
  whoa oh oh  when we were young 
  when everything was what it seemed 
  whoa oh oh  when we were young 
  and every day was how we dreamed 
  never knowing the cost of what we paid 
  letting someone else be strong 
  whoa oh oh  when we were young 
  and when you look at yourself tonight 
  are you someone you recognize 
  you can take back what you ve given away 
  but it must be the last time
