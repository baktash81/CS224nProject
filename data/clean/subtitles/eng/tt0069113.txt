chief

until we clear this weather 
  where the devil did you come from 
  from my cabin  sir 
don t you realize it s
dangerous out there 
you said come up anytime 
robin shelby   
   remember 
you picked a particularly
fascinating moment to come here 
the waves don t bother you 
i ve surfed up to 18 feet 
  but these look more like 30 
  thirty five to be exact 
some get up to 300 
  i find 60 about maximum  steady up 
man  steady up  sir 
  bring her up 
  bring her up  sir 
hang on 
  all lifelines rigged 
  all except c deck  sir 
when i order all lifelines rigged
it includes c deck  see to it 
wow  surf s really up 
  master shelby 
  yes  sir 
we ll continue our discussion
another time  fair enough 
aye  aye  sir 
that last one almost
broached us  linarcos 
i warned you  we should ve
loaded extra bunkers in gibraltar 
we are top heavy and when
that pump is repaired   
   i am taking on more ballast 
  where next 
  mr  and mrs  rogo  m45 
  yeah 
  i m dr  caravello  you asked for me 
all morning 
  you the only doctor on this tub 
caravello  the only ship doctor 
rogo 
what if somebody was dying 
oh  my god  who s not dying 
three quarters of the
passengers are sick  mr  rogo 
we have to take them in rotation 
use one of these now 
another in 8 hours   
   and remain in bed
until the sea is calm 
hold it  hold it 
you mean we had to wait all
this time for you to come   
   and give her some pills 
and some crap about staying in bed 
how do you know she s just seasick 
look at her 
it could be something else 
you didn t even examine her 
oh  shoot me  mike 
for chrissake  just shoot me 
rogo 
you see how sick she is 
i ll tell you what this is 
it s food poisoning  that s what 
how is she gonna swallow pills
when she can t even swallow water 
they re suppositories  mr  rogo 
you   
   don t swallow them 
what do you do with them 
i know what to do with suppositories 
just get them out of here 
oh  hon   
nurse  i think we should
continue with our rounds 
i still think it s food poisoning 
oh  shut up 
 sighs 
  good morning  mr  and mrs  rosen 
  good morning 
don t fall over 
  that martin  he s crazy 
  i like that man 
of course you like him  why shouldn t
you  he runs on time like a train 
you and trains 
when  in my whole life 
did i ever run for a train 
who cried for a week when
they tore down the 3rd avenue ei 
yeah 
he s lonely 
that s why he runs 
so you won t notice 
says here there s a package
tour to the mountain   
   where moses received
the ten commandments 
no 
when we finally get to israel 
we re gonna stay put  no traveling 
we re gonna get to know our grandson 
just think  he s 2 years old already 
he s talking 
we ve never even seen him 
get down on your knees
and pray to god for help   
   and then maybe everything
will work out 
garbage 
not where i come from 
you could wear off your
knees praying to god for heat   
   in a cold water flat in february 
and icicles would grow
from your upraised palms 
if you re freezing to death 
you burn the furniture   
   but you get off your knees 
  somewhat unorthodox  reverend scott 
but realistic 
john  use your church for something
more than prayer 
with those sermons  it s a wonder
you re still ordained 
  or are you 
  the best kind 
angry  rebellious 
critical  a renegade   
   stripped of most of my
so called clerical powers 
but i m still in business 
  you seem to enjoy the punishment 
  punishment 
the church has blessed me 
that s what it s done 
banished to a new country in africa 
hell  i had to look it up   
   on a map to find out
where i was going 
my bishop doesn t know  but he s
given me exactly what i wanted 
elbow room  freedom 
real freedom  freedom to dump
all the rules and all the trappings 
and freedom to discover god
in my own way 
i d better be going 
i ll see you later 
john 
still want me to give
that sermon this afternoon 
well  one thing s for sure 
nobody will sleep through it 
the weather report  sir 
 weather moderate to the southeast 
barometer 1016 millibars 
smooth seas  clear skies   good 
keep her on slow 
start taking on ballast 
aye  sir 
full ahead  captain 
as i ve told you  we don t have
enough ballast yet to run full ahead 
i suggest we talk privately 
linus  start taking on ballast 
i did not suggest full ahead  captain 
as the new owner s representative   
   i ordered it 
  damn it  man   
   the poseidon is too fine a lady to be
rushed to the junkyard on her last voyage 
we re three days behind schedule and
it s costing thousands of dollars   
   to maintain a wrecking crew 
i demand we dock monday 
i can t afford to gamble
with my passengers  lives 
your business is to deliver this ship
when and where we want it 
an unstable ship at full ahead is
dangerous  especially one this old 
i m sure i don t have to remind you
of my right to relieve your command 
three other officers
have their master s license 
now  order full ahead 
you irresponsible bastard 
full ahead 
aye  aye  sir 
 singing 
oh  can t you see the morning after 
it s waiting right outside the storm
why don t we cross the bridge together
and find a place that s safe and warm 
it s not too late  we should be giving
only with love can we climb
where did that lot come from 
they boarded at gibraltar 
they re on their way to sicily 
a free trip for free music 
they re going to a jazz festival 
there s got to be a morning after
 sings 
morning after
i can t take this 
give me a strauss waltz 
i rather fancy it 
you  you even fancy bagpipes 
hey  did you know this 
the engines on this ship
have more total horsepower   
   than all the cavalry napoleon
used to conquer europe 
how about that 
that s heavy  robin  real heavy 
 knocking on door 
the generator creates enough
electricity   
   to light charleston  south carolina 
and atlanta  georgia 
  shelby 
  that s right 
  cable 
  thank you 
  it s my turn to open the cable 
  don t be so childish 
 mother and i waiting impatiently
your arrival 
our thoughts and our love with you
on this new year s eve  dad  
  we should ve sent them a wire 
  i did 
how come you didn t ask me for
my ideas  i mean  what to put in it 
why couldn t i have had a brother
that s easier to live with 
  stop jumping and go take a shower 
  i m going to the engine room 
  you re going to church services 
  on vacation 
  will you get in that bathroom 
  i want to see the propeller shaft 
  you ll see the propeller shaft later 
  why don t you shove it 
don t you ever say that to me again 
shove it  shove it  shove it 
god is pretty busy 
he has a plan for humanity that
stretches beyond our comprehension 
so we can t expect him to concern
himself with the individual 
the individual is important
only to the extent   
   of providing a creative link
between the past and the future   
   in his children 
or in his grandchildren   
   or his contributions to humanity 
therefore  don t pray to god
to solve your problems 
pray to that part of god within you 
have the guts to fight for yourself 
god wants brave souls 
he wants winners  not quitters 
if you can t win  at least try to win 
god loves tryers 
  isn t that right  robin 
  right 
so  what resolution should
we make for the new year 
resolve to let god know that
you have the guts to do it alone 
resolve to fight for yourselves
and for others   
   and for those you love 
that part of god within you will
be fighting with you   
   all the way 
do you know what it means to be picked
out from all the people on this boat   
   to sit at the captain s table
on new year s eve 
i ll tell you one thing it means 
that your worries about other women
looking down on you is bull 
he only invited us because
you re a detective lieutenant 
why don t you just go without me 
what am i supposed do at midnight 
kiss the captain 
don t knock it 
why don t you admit the real reason 
you re still afraid some bum
will recognize you 
that s pretty stupid 
you re out of that business now 
you re my wife 
you can t go around afraid
all the time   
   that every guy you bump into
is a former customer 
linda  you hear me 
linda 
will you shut up  i m busy in here 
you weren t on the streets that long 
how many guys did you know 
you realize how slim
the chances are   
   that even one of these characters
is on this boat 
you don t have to shout 
i said   
i said  do you realize how slim   
i heard what you said 
mike 
i saw a young officer on deck
the other day 
and he looked pretty damn familiar 
even with his clothes on 
so he recognized you 
so 
doesn t that bother you 
if it bothered me  i wouldn t
have married you 
well  first you arrested me six times 
i had to keep you off the streets
until you d marry me 
come here  you lousy cop 
 nonnie singing 
there s got to be a morning after
if we can hold on through the night
we have a chance to find the sunshine
let s keep on looking for the light
oh  can t you see the morning after 
it s waiting right outside the storm
belle 
why don t we cross the bridge together
and find a place that s safe and warm 
mr  martin  what is the
little green one for 
that s alfalfa  mrs  rosen 
it s essential to blood formation 
neural function and growth 
the growth part doesn t work 
at least not with me anyway 
 laughing 
and the yellow one 
that s very attractive 
a tocopherol  derived
from seed germ oil 
  it looks like vitamin e to me 
  it is  mr  rosen 
doesn t that increase virility 
that s the rumor 
 laughing 
all you need is a pretty wife 
oh  i think perhaps
i ve been a bachelor too long 
sure  you re too busy
taking all those pills 
there she goes 
my wife can t stand seeing
anyone who s not married 
no 
  it comes from caring 
  i d like to be married  mrs  rosen 
i just can t seem to find the time 
i mean  i get down to the shop
