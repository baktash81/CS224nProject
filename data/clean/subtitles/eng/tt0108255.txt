well  we think it could be what
destroyed all the dinosaurs 
wow  there were
dinosaurs in brooklyn

why don t you come on down
to the tanning salon   
and i can hook you up
with some free tans 
bring a nice bathing suit 
something strapless so you
don t get a tan line 
  and you want to take off that rock 
  well  actually  you know   
i  i never take it off 
well  i know it sounds weird 
but  i mean   
it s the only thing i have
from when i was found 
  found 
  oh  i was abandoned 
i grew up at st  theresa s
on fulton street 
you mean  you don t know who
 your mother and your father are neither

can become    a loyal child
of the royal family 
goombas  ah 
  why d you do that to him

 you d go the opposite way i suggested 
hey  watch it

i can t stop this thing 
i can t see where i m going

  we re gonna hit the end
of the tunnel  look out 
hey  was that superior
drivin  skills or what 
let s get outta here before
this fungus stuff eats us alive 
hey  the fungus just saved us 
what re you talkin  about 
it was my drivin  that saved us 
it wasn t your driving 
that tunnel just sneezed us out 
and then this giant booger caught us
in the air  that s what saved us 
ah  come on 
let s get outta here 
  you there  excuse me  sir 
  sorry 
sir  i m sorry  i m sorry 
we didn t mean to disturb you 
but the plumbers  they re in the tunnel 
they re on their way to the desert 
what are you doing here instead of
being in the desert heading them off 
that s exactly what i told him  sir 
exactly what i told him 
between you and me  spike hasn t got
a thought in his brain  sir 
he s a liar  sir 
between us  iggy doesn t have
a brain in his head 
  i agree 
  they re your relatives 
  wait outside 
  we ll wait outside 
  you blew it 
  you  lena  bring me the princess 
and have her cleaned up 
do you know
what i love about mud 
it s clean and it s dirty
at the same time 
the princess 
  are you here to help us

transmogrification 
  more like a    transfiguration 
  ah  a super metamorphosis 
  huh 
  enough 
  both of you go to the desert 
  excuse me  excuse me 
that hardly seems logical 
does it 
perhaps we should stay
and formulate our own strategy 
tete a tete  inner circle 
that sort of thing 
here s what s logical to me 
if you do not return
with the plumbers and the rock   
i shall personally kill you 
  we re going 
  after you  ignatius 
  it was your mother s 
  what do you know about my mother 
she was quite an inspiration   
to some 
when koopa took over  she stole the rock
and smuggled you to the other side 
then she died 
what about my father  is he alive 
it depends on what
 you mean by living 
  what are you talking about 
  listen to me 
i don t care
whose daughter you are 
koopa thinks you re the only one
who can merge the dimensions 
i ve waited too long
to let all this slip away 
  well  you said the tunnel 
  i did not 
  i said parkway 
  but you meant the tunnel 
go on  pick a direction 
any direction you like 
hey  that looks good  over there  huh 
that s it  let s die there 
are the goombas training with
the hand held de evolution gun 
  as we speak  sir 
  excellent 
after the merge it will be nice to see
the humans de evolve  won t it 
what is it that they come from 
i keep forgetting 
  it s mice or something 
  apes  sir  monkeys 
disgusting mammals 
your princess is here 
well  my  my  looks like you got up on
the wrong side of the nest this morning

  go ahead and say it 
dinosaur 
yoshi is a pet of the royal family 
you may pet him 
just  uh   
don t move your hands around
like a small wounded animal 
you must be the great koopa 
that i am 
ruler of all that you see 
a few   
miserable streets and   
endless desert 
you ve done a lovely job 
well   
thank you 
where s my father 
he s around 
you are so fresh 
and so clean 
don t fight it 
you know you ve always been
uncomfortable in the human world 
and you ve at least suspected
that you were   
different 
i ve suspected a lot of things 
but not that i   
that you descended
from the dinosaurs 
and you know what they say   
about little girls  don t you 
no 
they say they never forget   
the first time they re
kissed by a lizard

shut up 
now  what s with this rock 
the rock is a piece
of a special meteorite   
which was chipped off
upon impact 65 million years ago 
once this rock is reinserted
into the meteorite   
our two dimensions will reunite
and we will become one 
and our cousin  koopa  shall become
ruler of both our worlds 
i don t get it 
  why didn t he come through before
like you clowns 
  you fools 
it s been sealed off for years
until someone on your side
blasted it open again 
scapelli 
what if we get you the rock 
will you get us daisy 
  oh  yeah

mutually benefit both our parties 
  okay  now  hand over the rock
