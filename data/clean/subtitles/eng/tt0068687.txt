i d like to know how you got
such a gorgeous tan   
if you ve been in court
since 7 00 this morning 
oh  honey  do you think
the law moves that quickly 
i mean  in florida 
there were three cases before us 
then they had a recess 
and then i wasn t called
as a material witness until 2 30 
and all that time i was sitting on
the dumb hot courtroom steps 
it was a complete waste of a day 
do you call this a honeymoon 
do you know that i haven t seen you for
five minutes since we ve been in florida 
oh  honey  it s not the amount of time
you spend with somebody 
it s how the time was spent 
and i feel that i ll   
never forget these three days 
where are you going now 
honey   honey  i ve got
to visit wilmer s family 
wilmer keeled over signing an affidavit 
the man has three broken ribs 
they rushed him to the hospital 
he s not gonna be doing much
charter fishing for a while 
so i thought i would go and lay a hundred
bucks on his wife and kids 
wait  can t i go with you 
honey  shantytown 
the man lives in shantytown 
you can t walk through
shantytown this time of night 
  i wouldn t want to if i didn t have to  sweetheart 
  what about dinner 
dinner is 9 00  florida lobster and
a terrific florida pecan pie 
something very big has come up and i think
tonight is a good time to discuss it 
something good 
could be very great  it all depends
on how you want to look at it 
i certainly appreciate the way you
and mrs  corcoran have treated me 
i mean  after all  i m a veritable stranger 
veritably unknown 
and you and mrs  corcoran
have generously treated me as though   
i were practically a member
of the immediate family 
kelly said something about
your laying your cards on the table 
  were those your cards 
  no  no  i m just kinda shuffling 
this is actually my deal now 
well  in just plain  old fashioned 
corny lingo  sir 
uh  i have fallen head over heels
with your kelly here 
it didn t take me long
to make up my mind 
one good look did it 
actually  if you want to know the truth 
i m the kind of crazy hairpin that
doesn t need much more than that 
and then  that s it for life with me 
now  there is a slight complication 
i happen to be a newlywed 
um 
i made the big mistake
about five days ago in new york 
when i say big  sir  i mean
radio city music hall big 
you may have seen her around the pool 
she s a nice girl 
but just not  not really my type 
i married her because i thought it was
the decent thing to do 
i ve learned that decency
doesn t always pay off 
so i m going to get out 
it ll be difficult  but not impossible 
not when you re as determined as i am 
sitting opposite you 
mr  corcoran  is probably   
the most determined young man
that you have ever seen 
now  i know that you are going back
to minneapolis tomorrow 
and it s my plan  just as soon as
i work out this messy business 
to follow you out to minnesota 
to get myself set up there 
and to lay claim
to your lovely daughter 
those are my cards  and  uh 
mr  corcoran  there s not
a joker in the bunch 
now  having spoken my piece 
i would like to know  in all candor 
how you feel about what i ve said   
and to ask if i have your approval 
not if they tied me to a horse
and pulled me 40 miles by my tongue 
well  that s an honest answer  sir 
not if they hung me from a tree
and put a lit bomb in my mouth 
i respect your frankness 
i think we understand
how we stand now 
it s not a question
of my not approving of you 
it s a question of   
i don t like one goddamn thing about you 
ah  well  initial judgments
very often are misleading 
i found that out to my sorrow  sir 
you come hanging around
my daughter on your honeymoon 
duane 
hang around your wife 
  don t hang around my daughter 
  duane  you re shouting  dear 
  five days  he s married  for god   five days 
  darling  please 
where s respect for
the institution of marriage 
once i get rid of my mistake  i m willing
to show you all the respect you would like 
get him out before i take him into the men s
room and break all the respect in his body 
you ve made your point  darling 
if i may  sir  in other words what
you re saying is that   
if i want kelly  i m gonna have
to put up a hell of a fight then 
is that  uh  
he s a nut 
he s some kind of a goddamn  
get him out of here  please  
just don t get upset  dear 
maybe this isn t the proper
time to discuss this 
mrs  corcoran  i hope that you will be
able to see my position in this thing 
and kelly perhaps  
look for me because i m coming 
you stay away from her 
i don t hand out my daughter to newlyweds 
why didn t you go to niagara falls
like everybody else 
thank you for everything  sir  and look
for me  kelly  because i m coming  i m coming 
you stay the hell out of minnesota 
you goddamn newlywed 
what is this 
am i talking to myself 
you ve eaten four shells 
is it terrific  did i exaggerate 
was it worth waiting for 
it s fantastic 
now    save some room
for that great pecan pie  right 
yummy yum pecan pie 
pardon me  sir 
lenny  are you gonna tell me the thing
you want to discuss 
  may i 
  yeah 
thank you 
this place must really be expensive 
can we afford this 
yeah 
don t worry about the money 
listen  lila  
money is the last thing that you
should be worrying about tonight 
really  just enjoy yourself 
enjoy your dinner 
i am 
i really am 
what is it  lenny 
what did you want to tell me 
hmm 
pardon me  sir  i m afraid we re
a little late with the pecan pie 
chef tells me we ran out
about ten minutes ago 
  would you like to order something else 
  wait a minute 
what  are you joking  no pecan pie 
  sorry  sir 
  no pecan pie 
lenny  what are you doing 
the main reason we came here
was for the pecan pie 
that s all right 
no  it s not  they should ve said
that to us at the door 
they should ve warned us that there was
a danger of running out of pecan pie 
well  there is one small piece left
in the kitchen 
would you want that one piece 
we also have some
excellent blueberry pie 
i mean  we drove
all the way from new york 
listen  take it  take the pecan pie 
we can share it 
i don t wanna share it 
i promised my wife the pecan pie 
i want you to  
bring the pecan pie for my wife 
i promised  
just bring me some coffee 
no blueberry pie 
what do i want any blueberry pie for 
  yes  sir 
  it s not a reject  is it 
  it s a perfectly good piece of pie  right 
  yes  sir 
that really bugs me 
i ve been talking about that pie
as far back as virginia 
if i d have given him ten bucks 
you d have had pecan pie
flying outta your ears by now 
  they got it back there 
  it s all right 
honey  i m getting the pie 
and i m very happy 
lenny 
tonight s been the best night
of our whole trip 
hasn t it 
aren t you happy tonight 
see  that s part of what
i wanted to talk about 
um  
geez  it s warm in here 
you pay these kind of prices 
the air conditioning is faulty in here 
  it s just  
  i think it s probably your sunburn 
go on  lenny 
what were you gonna say 
no  i was just gonna say that  uh  
um    that  uh  
when i was sitting out on the hot
courtroom steps this afternoon 
uh  i was thinking
that in three weeks   
you re gonna be 22 years old 
  the 12th 
  right 
and the really fantastic thing
about being 22 years old   
is that you have
your whole life in front of you 
i know 
we both have 
i   i mean  the people you could meet 
the places you could go 
the things that you could do 
  it s just  
  lenny  i never thought that i d get to florida 
that s right  i mean  what some women
would not give to be 22 years old 
  it s just a  
  that s right  i know it 
to go when you want 
to do   to live 
to live 
do you know what i mean 
to live  is that what you mean  lenny 
we only pass through once  right 
i mean  we can t squander it 
no matter what happens 
we re just passing this way but one time 
we can t squander it 
once is a lot 
once is a whole lifetime 
that s why we have to use   
and learn from anything that happens 
we have to   
learn from the good  from the bad 
from the happiness  from the tragic 
we have to learn 
we have to use it all  to use it all 
you re so deep  lenny 
i never knew that you were so deep 
do you sense at all
what i m trying to say 
do you  uh  
oh  christ  it s so hot in here 
is it hot in here  or is it hot in here 
what  i  
i don t underst  
what are you trying to tell me 
let me  
i m trying to say   
we have to prepare ourselves 
we have to prepare ourselves
for anything  you know 
i mean  everything could be terrific 
the world could be singing 
and then suddenly  
suddenly  for no reason at all 
it s over 
it s over  lila

  i love that 
i don t want him in this house 
i don t want him in this town 
this is my house 
i pay taxes in this town  i don t want him
in my town  i don t want him in my house 
  well  why not  duane 
  because i hate him  that s why not 
but  despite that 
kelly says he s an admirable young man 
well  can t you at least see him 
for me  daddy 
please do it    for me 
i understand you re quite taken with this part
of the country  mr  cantrow 
leonard  yes  ma am 
i like what i see out here  and   
i like what i breathe out here 
i ve just about made up my mind
that i m gonna make this my home 
oh 
well  from what i ve seen 
i d say you re
a very determined young man 
i take that as a compliment  mrs  corcoran 
thank you 
i don t mind saying this is one of the finest
meals that i ve ever had 
oh  thank you  leonard 
it s simple  you know 
mr  corcoran doesn t
really care for fancy food 
though i imagine you ve tried just about
every kind of exotic dish in new york 
exactly  see  that s the trouble 
it s exotic  but it s not honest 
i mean  it s fancy  but it s not real 
i mean  this is honest food 
there s no lying in that beef 
there s no  uh   
insincerity in those potatoes 
there s no deceit in the cauliflower 
this is a totally honest meal 
you don t know what a pleasure it is
to sit down   
in this day and age and eat food
that you can believe in 
oh  well   
what an original way of putting it 
leonard s so positive  isn t he  mother 
who does he remind you of
when he s so positive like that 
  who  dear 
  you know 
oh  yes 
oh  my goodness 
why didn t i notice that 
oh  of course 
tell me  leonard 
have you given any thought   
to what your future plans might be 
i ve given it a lot of thought 
mrs  corcoran  careful thought 
i thought actually i would like to do
something that concerns the land 
the land 
oh  you mean farming 
farming  no  i don t really think so 
and yet  it s hard to say 
you see  i want to get back
to origins  to basics 
back to the soil  so to speak 
so many young people today
are going in that direction 
concerned young people 
i think we ve taken enough
out of this country 
i believe it s time that
we started to think about   
putting something back into this country 
oh  you know 
that s very well put  leonard 
you know  i read an editorial
in the minneapolis star this morning   
that said the very same thing 
really 
i didn t see that 
can i get you something  duane 
no  thank you 
i wonder if you ladies   
would allow mr  cantrow and i
a few moments alone 
oh  yes  of course  certainly 
  mr  cantrow 
  excuse me 
no  sir  thank you  i don t smoke 
  leonard 
  sir 
i was very quiet at dinner tonight   
because i was listening 
i m in the banking business 
i m called upon to have
many business dinners 
i find i can tell more about a man by listening
to his dinner table conversation   
than by reading all the books and the records
and the balance sheets in the world 
i heard everything you said  
your feeling about the big cities 
the clear air out here 
the honest food 
getting back to the soil 
and i will tell you   
quite honestly   
i was very impressed 
  oh  i m very glad to hear that  sir 
  i was very impressed 
and i think
i can    also say   
quite honestly   
i have never heard such a crock
of horseshit in my life 
sir 
 there s no deceit in the cauliflower  
where do you get ideas like that 
they just  
they just come out of
that new york head of yours 
i was merely trying to impress
the fact that it was a pleasure  
i see through you

i know it 
it s actually ten years old 
you re talking up to
 20 000 worth of land 
i feel that so many people
are so concerned with   
taking things out of the country   
rather than making a contribution
and putting things back in 
you know what i m saying 
i think you can get a lot of satisfaction
from planting things 
  it s more like thomas jefferson  you know 
  exactly 
  we visited his home in monticello lately 
  yes 
  and he said the best government
is the least government 
  yes 
his way of doing was something fabulous 
the home he designed 
very resourceful 
what business are you in 
we make food for veal calves 
it s a specialty kind of food 
it develops  uh  
a european type   
  of   of veal calf 
  uh huh

wide open as far as   
where i might  uh  go with that 
but insurance is a field
that s been with us almost since the  
  what company are you  
  it s one of the first 
it s called alexander and alexander 
  it s a nationwide firm 
  nation 
  is that a growing field in this area 
  oh  yes 
  there s a lot of money in tear gas  uh  
  yes  indeed 
does your business bring you traveling 
there you are 
i ve been looking all over the place for you 
  i ll be with you in a second 
  wait a minute 
i would like to get back to origins 
i think many people don t think like this 
but i think we ve taken enough out of
this country in many ways  you know 
yeah 
i feel all of us should think
about putting something back in 
i m in athletic equipment now  you know 
  it s interesting 
  yeah 
what are you interested
in being when you grow up 
well  i haven t decided yet 
  how old are you 
  ten right now

  you ll hit your stride
any day  
  and you ll be on your way  
  you re going far  
  when it s rough
you ve got to hang in there  
  and it s rough i know  cause
i ve been there  
  life throws us in  
  and it s either
sink or swim  
  keep your head look around  
  do your best  
  you ll soon be
safe and sound  
  and you can rest  
  but till then
