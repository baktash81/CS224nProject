there s a black guy outside
breaking into your car 
how long s he been there 
i don t know 
what s going on 
not right now  honey  how many 
danny  how many 
one  i think 
is he strapped 
does he have a gun 
i don t fucking know 
wait a second 
what the fuck is going on 
stay right here and be quiet 
wait a second  derek  wait 
stay right here 
i don t have a personal problem
with him 
don t insult
my intelligence  murray 
you hate this child 
and i think i know why 
dr  sweeney s office 
i went out with his mother
a few times 
that was three years ago 
it was nothing 
nothing  really 
that paper  
bob  it s a travesty 
arguing for hitler
as a civil rights hero 
you ve got to draw the line 
murray you actually
did this to yourself 
you told them to do a report   
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights   
in plain english 
i am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused   
and harbors some sick ideas   
but i am not ready
to give up on him yet 
his brother probably
put him up to it 
i guarantee you 100     
his brother did not
put him up to this 
l find that hard to believe 
i know he was a good kid   
and it s a shame what he s been
through  but that s dangerous 
dangerous in what way 
that goes too far 
this racist propaganda 
 mein kampf  psychobabble   
he learned this nonsense 
and he can unlearn it too 
i will not give up
on this child yet 
i knew it was you 
danny  get in here 
i said get in here 
get in here 
five four three two

we got a whole file
on skinheads here 
part of the same gang 
venice beach gang 
actually 
he s done a stretch at y a 
this guy c c   is that him 
yeah that s him right there 
this morning we have a guest 
and there he is 
good morning 
morning  sir 
good to see you 
good morning 
this here is dr  bob sweeney 
he s principal
over at venice beach high 
for some time now 
he s been doing outreach work   
with gangs
both in and out of the can 
three years ago  a local kid
named derek vinyard   
was sent up for murdering
a couple of crips   
who were trying to jack his car 
bob taught vinyard  and
he s followed this case closely 
he was a skinhead  right 
he was more
like  the  skinhead   
the protégé
of cameron alexander 
 who 
 cameron alexander 
here you go  have a look see 
cameron alexander well 
he s a venice beach landmark 
he s the biggest distributor
and writer   
of white power literature
and videos in l a  county 
he promotes white power bands 
he writes reviews   
and in his spare time this guy
even writes hate columns 
 does he have a record 
 he s pretty clean 
been trying to pin something
to him  but it doesn t work 
trust me 
he s behind all of it 
he runs everything
out of his house by the beach 
there were no white gangs
in venice beach   
before cameron alexander
and derek vinyard hooked up 
alexander found in derek
his shining prince 
essentially 
he used derek to recruit   
a slew of insecure frustrated 
and impressionable kids 
this kid vinyard 
he s got a lot of baggage   
as you ll see on this tape
we ve gotten courtesy of nbc 
earlier today  l a  county
fire fighter dennis vinyard   
was shot and killed
battling a blaze   
at a suspected compton drug den 
we re at the vinyard home now   
and lieutenant vinyard s
oldest son derek   
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment 
derek  if you could come
down here please for a second 
look  i know this is tough 
but how do you  feel right now 
how do you think l feel 
 i think it s typical 
 typical how 
well this country s becoming
a haven for criminals   
so what do you expect 
decent hard working americans
like my dad   
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites 
parasites 
blacks  browns yellow 
whatever 
i don t understand 
you think maybe your father s
murder was race related 
yeah  it s race related 
every problem in this country
is race related 
not just crime 
it s immigration aids welfare 
those are problems
of the black community   
the hispanic community 
the asian community 
they re not white problems 
aren t those really issues
that deal more with poverty 
no  they re not products
of their environments 
minorities don t give two shits
about this country 
they come here to exploit it 
not to embrace it 
millions of white europeans
came here and flourished   
within a generation 
what the fuck is the matter
with these people 
they have to go around
shooting at firemen 
what does this have to do
with the murder of your father 
because my father was murdered
doing his job 
putting out a fire in a fucking
nigger neighborhood   
he shouldn t
have given a shit about 
he got shot
by a fucking drug dealer   
who probably still collects
a welfare check 
derek vinyard was quietly
released from chino   
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years 
i think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on 
if something happens to him   
things could get very ugly
down by the beach 
just keep it low 
venice beach
didn t always look like this 
it used to be
a great neighborhood 
the boardwalk s always
been a dump   
but when my dad moved us
out here   
venice was a nice 
quiet place to grow up 
over the years though 
it s just gone to hell 
the gangs are like a plague 
they moved west from inglewood
and south central   
and basically took over 
i ain t foulin  you 
i ain t got time
for all this bullshit 
fuck y all 
you all right 
i m all right 
yo  is that that fool
you was telling me about 
yeah that s that motherfucker 
yeah  man that s him 
bitch ass motherfucker 
that s why derek started
the d o c 
he said white kids shouldn t
have to walk around scared   
in their own neighborhood 
and for a while there   
we really made it
like it was ours again

 curtis what is that 
 come on  derek 
weed is for niggers 
put that away right now 
jesus fucking christ 
have a little self respect 
all right  listen up 
we need to open our eyes 
there s over two million
illegal immigrants   
bedding down
in this state tonight 
this state spent three
billion dollars last year   
on services for those people
who had no right to be here 
three billion dollars 
 400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals   
who only got into this country
because the ins decided   
it s not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons 
our government
doesn t give a shit 
our border policy is a joke 
so is anybody surprised   
that south of the border
they re laughing at us 
laughing at our laws 
every night thousands
of these parasites   
stream across the border like
some fucking piñata exploded 
don t laugh 
there s nothing funny here 
this is about your life
and mine 
it s about decent 
hard working americans   
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft   
because their government
cares more about the rights   
of a bunch of people
who aren t even citizens 
on the statue of liberty
it says   
 give me your tired 
your hungry your poor  
well  it s americans who are
tired and hungry and poor 
until you take care of that   
close the fucking book 
because we re losing 
we re losing our right
to pursue our destiny 
we re losing our freedom so
a bunch of fucking foreigners   
can come in here
and exploit our country 
and this isn t something
that s going on far away 
this isn t happening places
we can t do anything about it 
it s happening here 
right in our neighborhood 
right in that building
behind you 
archie miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here 
dave worked there 
mike worked there 
he went under  and now
some fucking korean owns it   
who fired these guys
and is making a killing   
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers 
i see this shit going on   
and i don t see anybody
doing anything about it   
and it fucking pisses me off 
so look around you 
this isn t
our fucking neighborhood 
it s a battlefield 
we re on a battlefield tonight 
make a decision 
are we going to stand
on the sidelines 
quietly standing there
while our country gets raped 
are we going to ante up
and do something about it 
you re goddamn right 
come here 
don t you know it s illegal   
to hire fucking border jumpers 
you nip bastard 
hey  sweetheart 
no  you don t need this 
we re not going to hurt you 
please  please  no 
you fucking spic 
 no  please 
 this bitch deserves it 
this bitch stinks  smells like
fish and chips and guacamole 
here we go 
goddamn 
get the fuck off me 
motherfucker 
viva la mexico 
have a fucking bean 
you fucking beaner 
get some of that in there 
throw it on 
that s a great colour on you 
now you can get
a white woman s job 
a little better
than this one  huh 
yeah white 
then you ll move up
in the world 
asshole 
let s go 
everybody out 
now  now 
all right  let s go 
come on 
come on  let s go 
no green card  no fucking work 
comprende 
come on 
we re fucking going  come on 
dad was gone  but things
were almost normal again 
derek had a good job 
mom was starting
to live a little 
everyone was feeling so good 
we just didn t see it coming 
maybe we should ve 
the irony is
that most of the stores   
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people 
that s stupid though 
why trash your neighborhood 
well that s my point 
it s an irrational act 
it s like an expression
of rage   
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system 
it s like we had in watts
or the riots in chicago in  68 
i don t buy that 
calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage 
that s such a cop out 
it s opportunism at its worst 
it s people grabbing
any excuse they can find   
to go and loot a store 
nothing more 
the fact that these people
ripped off the stores   
in their own communities 
all that reflects   
is that they have no respect
forthe law at all   
and certainly no concept
of community   
or civic responsibility 
now wait a minute 
white people commit crimes
against white people too 
yeah  but they re not offing
each other in record numbers 
look at the statistics 
for christ s sake 
one in every three
black males   
is in some phase
of the correctional system 
is that a coincidence   
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime 
not only that 
they re proud of it 
maybe it says something
about prejudice   
in the judicial system 
if you want to talk
about criminal statistics   
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them 
that s exactly what i hate 
you re taking one thing
and calling it something else   
and just alleviating
the responsibility   
these people have
for their own actions 
it s like saying 
it s not a riot  it s rage 
it s not crime  it s poverty 
that s just nonsense 
it s exactly what happened
in this trial   
because the media
twisted things around   
so people got all focused
on these cops   
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted   
and whether rodney king s
civil rights had been violated 
everybody lost sight
of old rodney king himself 
the guy s a multiple felon
by his own admission 
he s high as a goddamn kite   
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway 
he gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops   
and he attacks them 
he attacked police officers 
that s the bottom line 
and he walked 
and there s some yahoo there
with a video camera   
who turned it on
halfway through   
so that all we see
is them hitting him 
you got powell and koon
cracking him with billy clubs   
and briseno s kicking him
in the back of the skull   
so it looks severe you know 
people are going 
 oh this poor guy  
this poor guy
who attacked four cops   
and those cops
end up on the stand   
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures 
i don t think the tapes
showed that at all 
you didn t think so 
and you re an authority 
murray what do you think 
i did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively 
who are you
to say what s excessive 
i think it was
totally appropriate 
they re in a better position
to make that call than you are 
we  as society  grant cops
a certain amount of authority   
to make those calls 
because we acknowledge   
that their job is difficult
and dangerous 
very few people respect that
and respect that authority 
look who s talking about
respect  mr  junior kkk 
what 
you want to go to college 
learn to listen 
i didn t say i respect the laws 
i acknowledge a cop s authority 
i don t respect laws that let
rodney king back on the street 
second  i am not a member
of a low rent   
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking kkk  please 
so take your head
out of your ass 
you ve gotten off the point 
i had a point 
that wasn t even the point 
do you have one 
what is your point 
all right think about this 
if danny was walking
across the street that night   
and rodney king
plowed into him  
can we drop
this rodney king thing 
who would like some dessert 
we re having a discussion 
we re having
a nice discussion  right 
if rodney king
had been driving along   
hopped up on pcp
and had killed danny   
you d be singing
a different tune  
i didn t see him hit anybody 
and neither did you 
he didn t happen
to kill anybody thank god 
keep it down  ok 
ally s sleeping 
if that fucking monkey
had run some kid over   
everybody would have
a very different opinion 
they d be focused on rodney king
and not on these officers 
but instead 
he just attacked a few cops   
so  suddenly 
it s hands across america   
for this fucking total
son of a bitch 
it blows my mind 
we re so hung up on this notion
that we have some obligation   
to help
this struggling black man 
cut him some slack
until he can overcome   
these historical injustices 
it s crap  this stuff
just perpetuates it   
all this liberal nonsense 
everyone s looking
the otherway   
while our country rots
from the inside out 
i mean  christ  lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago 
how long does it take
to get your act together

about anti semitism 
oh forget that

only a matter of time   
before they made a move 
i just hoped it d be quick 
but it never came 
i couldn t figure it out 
i knew some of them
were itching for it 
after a while 
i just put my head down   
and read the stuff
that sweeney sent me   
and i kept to myself 
last six months in that place 
i was like a ghost

and see the truth
about people you love 
i think if you asked derek why
it all went the way it did   
and where it all started   
he d still say it started
when our father was murdered 
the truth is 
it started earlier 
are we all meeting
for the game tonight 
definitely 
all right 
ben s burger at 7 00   
then we go watch
the big guy play 
psyching up for the game 
i m always ready for that 
i got an english exam

i m not ready 
what s the matter 
afraid you ll get a  b  
might do you good  b minus 
hey  don t laugh 
this guy is different 
dr  sweeney 
this guy s unbelievable 
unbelievable  i ve never
had a teacher like this 
he s got two ph d s 
i don t know what he s doing
teaching at our school 
what s he got you reading 
we got this essay exam
on  native son  
 native son  
i don t know that 
that s a big surprise 
what  i read 
honey they don t teach
tom clancy in school 
well they don t 
so what is this  native son  
it s this book
about this black guy 
we re doing this whole
black literature unit 
is it black history month 
no  it s just
this guy sweeney you know 
it s part of the course now 
what 
nothing  it s just   
it s everywhere i look now 
what 
this affirmative blacktion 
a few new books doesn t qualify
as affirmative black action 
read the book 
ace the guy s test 
just don t swallow
everything he feeds you whole 
just  cause you see it
on the evening news   
i know  but what 
all this stuff about
making everything equal 
it s not that simple 
now you got this book
 native son  
what happened to
the other books in the course 
they re not any good anymore
because mr  two ph d  says so 
now you gotta trade in
great books for black books 
does that make sense 
you gotta question
these things  derek 
you gotta look
at the whole picture 
we re talking about books here 
i m also talking about my job 
i got two black guys
on my squad now   
who got their job
over a couple of white guys   
who actually scored higher
on the test 
does that make sense 
everything s equal now  but i
got two guys watching my back   
responsible for my life
who aren t as good 
they only got the job
because they were black   
not because they were the best 
 that sucks 
 is that what america s about 
no america s about
best man for the job 
you do your best 
you get the job 
this affirmative action crap   
i don t know what that s about 
there s like some hidden agenda
or something going on 
you see what i m saying 
yeah  i do  i didn t
think about it like that 
this guy though  i don t know 
dr  sweeney 
he comes on so strong   
it s hard
not to listen to him   
but maybe some of
what he says is kinda   
it s bullshit 
yeah  yeah  maybe 
no  it s nigger bullshit 
 you see that  don t you 
 yeah 
you gotta watch out for that 
yeah  no  i get what
you re saying  i will

just stay out of it

all right  let him go 
oh  no 
aw jesus 
oh jesus 
god what did i do 
so i guess this is where
i tell you what i learned 
my conclusion  right 
well  my conclusion is
hate is baggage 
life s too short
to be pissed off all the time 
it s just not worth it 
derek says it s always good
to end a paper with a quote 
he says someone else
has already said it best   
so if you can t top it   
steal from them
and go out strong 
so i picked a guy
i thought you d like 
 we are not enemies 
but friends 
 we must not be enemies 
 though passion
may have strained   
 we must not break
our bonds of affection 
 the mystic chords of memory
