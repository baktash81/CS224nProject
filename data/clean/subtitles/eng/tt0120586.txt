dr sweeneys office
i went out with his mother
a few times

that paper
bob its a travesty
arguing for hitler
as a civil rights hero
youve got to draw the line
murrayyou actually
did this to yourself
you told them to do a report
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights
in plain english
i am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused
and harbors some sick ideas
but i am not ready
to give up on him yet
his brother probably
put him up to it
i guarantee you 100
his brother did not
put him up to this

we got a whole file
on skinheads here
part of the same gang
venice beach gang
actually
hes done a stretch at ya
this guy cc is that him
yeahthats him right there
this morning we have a guest
and there he is
good morning
morning sir
good to see you
good morning
this here is dr bob sweeney
hes principal
over at venice beach high
for some time now
hes been doing outreach work
with gangs
both in and out of the can
three years ago a local kid
named derek vinyard
was sent up for murdering
a couple of crips
who were trying to jack his car
bob taught vinyard and
hes followed this case closely
he was a skinhead right
he was more
like the skinhead
the protégé
of cameron alexander
who
cameron alexander
here you go have a looksee
cameron alexanderwell
hes a venice beach landmark
hes the biggest distributor
and writer
of white power literature
and videos in la county
he promotes white power bands
he writes reviews
and in his spare timethis guy
even writes hate columns
does he have a record
hes pretty clean
been trying to pin something
to him but it doesnt work
trust me
hes behind all of it
he runs everything
out of his house by the beach
there were no white gangs
in venice beach
before cameron alexander
and derek vinyard hooked up
alexander found in derek
his shining prince
essentially
he used derek to recruit
a slew of insecurefrustrated
and impressionable kids
this kid vinyard
hes got a lot of baggage
as youll see on this tape
weve gotten courtesy of nbc
earlier today la county
firefighter dennis vinyard
was shot and killed
battling a blaze
at a suspected compton drug den
were at the vinyard home now
and lieutenant vinyards
oldest son derek
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment
derek if you could come
down here please for a second
look i know this is tough
but how do you  feel right now
how do you think l feel
i think its typical
typical how
wellthis countrys becoming
a haven for criminals
so what do you expect
decent hardworking americans
like my dad
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites
parasites
blacks brownsyellow
whatever
i dont understand
you think maybe your fathers
murder was racerelated
yeah its racerelated
every problem in this country
is racerelated
not just crime
its immigrationaidswelfare
those are problems
of the black community
the hispanic community
the asian community
theyre not white problems
arent those really issues
that deal more with poverty
no theyre not products
of their environments
minorities dont give two shits
about this country
they come here to exploit it
not to embrace it
millions of white europeans
came here and flourished
within a generation
what the fuck is the matter
with these people
they have to go around
shooting at firemen
what does this have to do
with the murder of your father
because my father was murdered
doing his job
putting out a fire in a fucking
nigger neighborhood
he shouldnt
have given a shit about
he got shot
by a fucking drug dealer
who probably still collects
a welfare check
derek vinyard was quietly
released from chino
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years
i think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on
if something happens to him
things could get very ugly
down by the beach
just keep it low
venice beach
didnt always look like this
it used to be
a great neighborhood
the boardwalks always
been a dump
but when my dad moved us
out here
venice was a nice
quiet place to grow up
over the yearsthough
its just gone to hell
the gangs are like a plague
they moved west from inglewood
and south central
and basically took over
i aint foulin you
i aint got time
for all this bullshit
fuck yall
you all right
im all right
yo is that that fool
you was telling me about
yeahthats that motherfucker

weed is for niggers
put that away right now
jesus fucking christ
have a little selfrespect
all right listen up
we need to open our eyes
theres over two million
illegal immigrants
bedding down
in this state tonight
this state spent three
billion dollars last year
on services for those people
who had no right to be here
three billion dollars
400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals
who only got into this country
because the ins decided
its not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons
our government
doesnt give a shit
our border policy is a joke
so is anybody surprised
that south of the border
theyre laughing at us
laughing at our laws
every nightthousands
of these parasites
stream across the border like
some fucking piñata exploded
dont laugh
theres nothing funny here
this is about your life
and mine
its about decent
hardworking americans
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft
because their government
cares more about the rights
of a bunch of people
who arent even citizens
on the statue of liberty
it says
give me your tired
your hungryyour poor
well its americans who are
tired and hungry and poor
until you take care of that
close the fucking book
because were losing
were losing our right
to pursue our destiny
were losing our freedom so
a bunch of fucking foreigners
can come in here
and exploit our country
and this isnt something
thats going on far away
this isnt happening places
we cant do anything about it
its happening here
right in our neighborhood
right in that building
behind you
archie miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here
dave worked there
mike worked there
he went under and now
some fucking korean owns it
who fired these guys
and is making a killing
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers
i see this shit going on
and i dont see anybody
doing anything about it
and it fucking pisses me off
so look around you
this isnt
our fucking neighborhood
its a battlefield
were on a battlefield tonight
make a decision
are we going to stand
on the sidelines
quietly standing there
while our country gets raped
are we going to ante up
and do something about it
youre goddamn right
come here
dont you know its illegal
to hire fucking border jumpers
you nip bastard
hey sweetheart
no you dont need this
were not going to hurt you
please please no
you fucking spic
no please
this bitch deserves it
this bitch stinks smells like
fish and chips and guacamole
here we go
goddamn
get the fuck off me
motherfucker
viva la mexico
have a fucking bean
you fucking beaner
get some of that in there
throw it on
thats a great colour on you
now you can get
a white womans job
a little better
than this one huh
yeahwhite
then youll move up
in the world
asshole
lets go
everybody out
now now
all right lets go
come on
come on lets go
no green card no fucking work
comprende
come on
were fucking going come on
dad was gone but things
were almost normal again
derek had a good job
mom was starting
to live a little
everyone was feeling so good
we just didnt see it coming
maybe we shouldve
the irony is
that most of the stores
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people
thats stupidthough
why trash your neighborhood
wellthats my point
its an irrational act
its like an expression
of rage
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system
its like we had in watts
or the riots in chicago in 68
i dont buy that
calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage
thats such a copout
its opportunism at its worst
its people grabbing
any excuse they can find
to go and loot a store
nothing more
the fact that these people
ripped off the stores
in their own communities
all that reflects
is that they have no respect
forthe law at all
and certainly no concept
of community
or civic responsibility
now wait a minute
white people commit crimes
against white peopletoo
yeah but theyre not offing
each other in record numbers
look at the statistics
for christs sake
one in every three
black males
is in some phase
of the correctional system
is that a coincidence
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime
not only that
theyre proud of it
maybe it says something
about prejudice
in the judicial system
if you want to talk
about criminal statistics
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them
thats exactly what i hate
youre taking one thing
and calling it something else
and just alleviating
the responsibility
these people have
for their own actions
its like saying
its not a riot its rage
its not crime its poverty
thats just nonsense
its exactly what happened
in this trial
because the media
twisted things around
so people got all focused
on these cops
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted
and whether rodney kings
civil rights had been violated
everybody lost sight
of old rodney king himself
the guys a multiple felon
by his own admission
hes high as a goddamn kite
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway
he gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops
and he attacks them
he attacked police officers
thats the bottom line
and he walked
and theres some yahoo there
with a video camera
who turned it on
halfway through
so that all we see
is them hitting him
you got powell and koon
cracking him with billy clubs
and brisenos kicking him
in the back of the skull
so it looks severeyou know
people are going
ohthis poor guy
this poor guy
who attacked four cops
and those cops
end up on the stand
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures
i dont think the tapes
showed that at all
you didnt think so
and youre an authority
murraywhat do you think
i did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively
who are you
to say whats excessive
i think it was
totally appropriate
theyre in a better position
to make that call than you are
we as society grant cops
a certain amount of authority
to make those calls
because we acknowledge
that their job is difficult
and dangerous
very few people respect that
and respect that authority
look whos talking about
respectmr junior kkk
what
you want to go to college
learn to listen
i didnt say i respect the laws
i acknowledge a cops authority
i dont respect laws that let
rodney king back on the street
second i am not a member
of a lowrent
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking kkk please
so take your head
out of your ass
youve gotten off the point
i had a point
that wasnt even the point
do you have one
what is your point
all rightthink about this
if danny was walking
across the street that night
and rodney king
plowed into him
can we drop
this rodney king thing
who would like some dessert
were having a discussion
were having
a nice discussion right
if rodney king
had been driving along
hopped up on pcp
and had killed danny
youd be singing
a different tune
i didnt see him hit anybody
and neither did you
he didnt happen
to kill anybodythank god
keep it down ok
allys sleeping
if that fucking monkey
had run some kid over
everybody would have
a very different opinion
theyd be focused on rodney king
and not on these officers
but instead
he just attacked a few cops
so suddenly
its hands across america
for this fucking total
son of a bitch
it blows my mind
were so hung up on this notion
that we have some obligation
to help
this struggling black man
cut him some slack
until he can overcome
these historical injustices
its crap this stuff
just perpetuates it
all this liberal nonsense
everyones looking
the otherway
while our country rots
from the inside out
i mean christ lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago
how long does it take
to get your act together
jews have been persecuted
for over 5000 years
are you saying its wrong
to feel sensitive
about antisemitism
ohforget that
im with you im with you
all the way baby
im so sick of
these liberal hypocrites
here we go again
i love this part
this is great
look how they scapegoated
chief gates
think they wouldve come down
that hard on willie williams
no way that videotape was
a setup to get rid of gates
can i be excused

i dont know what hes doing
teaching at our school
whats he got you reading
we got this essay exam
on native son
native son
i dont know that
thats a big surprise
what i read
honeythey dont teach
tom clancy in school
wellthey dont
so what is this native son
its this book
about this black guy
were doing this whole
black literature unit
is it black history month
no its just
this guy sweeneyyou know
its part of the course now

nothing its just
its everywhere i look now
what
this affirmative blacktion
a few new books doesnt qualify
as affirmative black action
read the book
ace the guys test
just dont swallow
everything he feeds you whole
just cause you see it
on the evening news
i know but what
all this stuff about
making everything equal
its not that simple
now you got this book
native son
what happened to
the other books in the course
theyre not any good anymore
because mr two phd says so
now you gotta trade in
great books for black books
does that make sense
you gotta question
these things derek

at the whole picture
were talking about books here

on my squad now
who got their job
over a couple of white guys
who actually scored higher
on the test
does that make sense
everythings equal now but i
got two guys watching my back
responsible for my life
who arent as good
they only got the job
because they were black
not because they were the best
that sucks

we better go
all right come on
bye
ill catch up with you
see you later
get out of my way
all right let him go
oh no
awjesus
ohjesus
godwhat did i do
so i guess this is where
i tell you what i learned
my conclusion right
well my conclusion is
hate is baggage
lifes too short
to be pissed off all the time
its just not worth it
derek says its always good
to end a paper with a quote
he says someone else
has already said it best
so if you cant top it
steal from them
and go out strong
so i picked a guy
i thought youd like
we are not enemies
but friends
we must not be enemies
though passion
may have strained
we must not break
our bonds of affection
the mystic chords of memory
