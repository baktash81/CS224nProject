captain
the surgeon would like
to speak with you sir
theres sickness in the crew
five more were taken down
since midwatch
fever canker sores
your cabinet has bromide
leech it out
lts beyond bleeding
mr penfield
l look to your medical knowledge
after we left moorea
you thought it was scurvy
then you said it was breakbone fever
the symptoms werent for certain
now l know
fever withered skin
black bile
cholera
cant we turn back
theres no port for a plague ship
drop anchor at the first island
this is all open sea
with due respect captain that small
boat put off from somewheres
this is a french naval chart
theres nothing but warnings
theres reefs atolls
this is a cruel turn for mrs hargraves
left widowed with an infant
cast them adrift
a woman alone with two children
put a man with them
kearneys strong and able
at least thatll give them a chance
kearney
best of a poor lot
but keep it from the rest of the crew
wait till midwatch
aye sir
putting us off into the peril
of the sea because some men are ill
this is madness
lts for your own good
lve spent the last three years
in a climate of awful heat
with insects as big as rats
rats as big as cats
l can certainly deal with some
deck hands down with fever
were carrying cholera
lf you stay aboard youll die
you cant take your sea chest missus
only things you really need
but everything we have
will be in this chest
mrs hargraves will be taking
her belongings
aye sir
cholera
mr kearney
mr kearney a cup of water please
theres only so much missus
theyre in sore need mr kearney
look the boy aint yours
so he dont matter too much
your infant knows what to do
ld say youre fresh let her suckle
l tell you lm sick and tired
of them two squalling
then give them water
lm a practical man missus
lf l was alone by myself
this could last a good while
sharing four ways makes no sense
lts best to put them out
of their misery
you wont touch them
you either shut them up
or theyre going overboard
hush lilli

if you dont want to see
richard come quickly jump up
you can help mama
yeah thats my girl

l wish l looked like him down there

he can aim when he goes
l can hit a mango leaf dead centre
why does he have one he can aim
and we dont
god in his infinite wisdom
decided
well nature gave us different parts

a cowrie shell

a cowrie shell
and we call richards a
no no no never mind
l should have explained certain
of lifes facts to you years ago
explain certain of lifes facts now
no l need to think about it first
lll explain it after your
spelling lesson tonight
lets rinse off
tonight
all right everybody
why do people get married
god commanded that when a man
and woman love each other
they take vows
vows are like promises
they make promises to each other
in the eyes of god
and thats called
the marriage ceremony
heres the ceremony
your father used to say
when he performed marriages
at the mission
what about the life facts
when a girl becomes a woman
and a boy becomes a man
whens that
well its different for everyone
but youll know when it happens
how
lilli your body will become rounder
youll grow breasts like mine
and youll bleed a bit
from between your legs
l dont wanna bleed
lt only lasts a few days
and its a great blessing
because it means you can have a baby
do l have to bleed
no but your body will change too
your voice gets deeper
hair will grow on your face
youd look handsome with a beard
unless you want to scrape it off
l want the baby now
you cant youre not ready yet
also you need the man
to make the baby inside you
lnside me
yes theres a special place
inside a woman
where the baby stays nice
and warm and safe
until its ready
to be born into the world
how does the baby get in there
well
after theyre married
the man and woman lie very
very close together and
l know lts like the iguanas lilli
you know when they get so close
you cant tell them apart
thats it
thats it
yes lguanas have
their babies soon after
thats it mother
well thats most of it
thats what lve been waiting
to hear all day
thats not gonna help
look what you did to my spear go away
that was my fish
go back out where you belong
richard look
now what are we gonna do
what are we gonna do now richard
what are we gonna do
will you be quiet and let me think
lilli
richard
were out past sunset
mothers gonna be angry
what are you doing
lve got an idea
hes coming come on
where have you been
do you realize how late it is
but there was this old shark in the
channel he took richards spear
l told you to keep away from sharks
boat drifted loose
what are the rules
be home by sunset always
and
never to the north side of the island
do you see that a full moon
we are going straight home and this is
never happening again do you hear me
oh lilli richard
go get some thatch
get back inside
our father who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against
us lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil for thine is
the kingdom power and glory forever
l can feel that the sickness has moved
into my lungs now
and that means l might not get well
whats going to happen
you may have to be here without me
lf god wants
lll be with your father and well
be guardian angels watching over you
this is my special place
lts quiet here
and l can see the house
hollow out this ground about so deep
and line it with thatch and moss
then fill it in
and smooth it over with earth
lll write out a prayer for you to say
well carve a marker and it will say
here lies sarah hargraves
wife of william mother of lillian
and l know lm not your
real mother richard
but l would like to have it said
and mother of richard
we pray the lord to grant
this last abiding wish
that lilli and richard love each other
take care of each other
and keep up with their lessons
and be prepared for the
ship when it comes amen

the calendar marks say tomorrows
easter so we must have the hunt
why
how else do we know who finds
the most eggs and wins
wins what richard
l dont know
nothing just wins
lt seems silly to me l dont
understand why we have to do it
because mother would want us to
lve got an idea whoever finds
the most eggs this year wins a prize
what kind of a prize
lf you win
lve gotta give you something
and if l win
youve gotta give me something
lts a wonderful idea
l hid ten eggs between
the beach and the berry patch

l only found eight
the winners me wheres my prize
you were down so long
what were you doing
youll see
your prize
lm gonna keep this forever
my prize the white bead
l think it looks nice in my hair
do you
l dont care what you do with it
or how you wear it
you can hang it from your nose
for all l care
back and forth
round and round
you think this whole reef is yours
you think you can swallow
anything that swims
youd like to catch me wouldnt you
but l was too fast stupid sea slug
l can beat you every time
and if you dont believe me
lll prove it
master of the reef
the first time he almost got me
but l was too fast for him
this time he was lying in wait
so l dive in
and l can see down his mouth
theres about 500 teeth
theres fish around his gills
and he comes at me
he misses me stupid sea slug
lt seems silly to me
silly lts not silly lts dangerous
exactly thats why its silly
l dont understand why you do it
l like the way it makes me feel
what
lnside here lt feels all alive when
l know lm the master of the reef
the master of the reef
