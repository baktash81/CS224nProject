alive 
 l ll take him 
 thank you  ma am 
there  there  now 
  we commit their bodies to the waters
to be turned into corruption   
   looking for resurrection 
when the sea shall give up her dead   
   and the life of the world to come 
through our lord  jesus christ  amen   
captain 
the surgeon would like
to speak with you  sir 
there s sickness in the crew 
five more were taken down
since mid watch 
fever  canker sores 
your cabinet has bromide 
leech it out 
lt s beyond bleeding 
mr  penfield 
l look to your medical knowledge 
after we left moorea 
you thought it was scurvy 
then you said it was breakbone fever 
the symptoms weren t for certain 
now  l know 
fever  withered skin 
black bile 
cholera 
 can t we turn back 
 there s no port for a plague ship 
 drop anchor at the first island 
 this is all open sea 
with due respect  captain  that small
boat put off from somewheres 
this is a french naval chart 
there s nothing but warnings 
there s reefs  atolls 
this is a cruel turn for mrs  hargraves 
left widowed with an infant 
cast them adrift 
 a woman alone with two children 
 put a man with them 
kearney s strong and able 
at least that ll give them a chance 
kearney 
best of a poor lot 
but keep it from the rest of the crew 
 wait till mid watch 
 aye  sir 
putting us off into the peril
of the sea because some men are ill 
 this is madness 
 lt s for your own good 
l ve spent the last three years
in a climate of awful heat   
   with insects as big as rats 
rats as big as cats 
l can certainly deal with some
deck hands down with fever 
we re carrying cholera 
lf you stay aboard  you ll die 
you can t take your sea chest  missus 
only things you really need 
but everything we have
will be in this chest 
mrs  hargraves will be taking
her belongings 
aye  sir 
cholera 
mr  kearney

so he don t matter too much 
your infant knows what to do 
l d say you re fresh  let her suckle 
l tell you  l m sick and tired
of them two squalling 
then give them water 
l m a practical man  missus 
lf l was alone  by myself 
this could last a good while 
sharing four ways makes no sense 
lt s best to put them out
of their misery 
you won t touch them 
you either shut them up 
or they re going overboard 
hush  lilli 
that s it  look the other way
if you don t want to see 
richard  come quickly  jump up

any passing ship will see this
when it s ablaze 
lt won t be long before one finds us 
go to sleep now  close your eyes 
l ll be right back 
l know this is your favourite dessert 
but eat slower 
and hold the spoon this way 
as l ve showed you 
someday  you ll find yourself seated
at a fancy table in san francisco   
   and be expected
to show proper table manners 
richard  don t do that 
we may be away from civilization 
but we won t behave uncivilized 
full moon 
they come every three months
when the moon is full 
off to bed  children  quickly 
richard  come 
lt ll be all right  tonight
you ll get your lullaby in the dark 
the mother 
put it down 
 why do you wear clothes when bathing 
 lt s proper 
 why don t richard and l wear clothes 
 l gave up on you long ago 
l put your clothes on
and you d just take them off 
 l wish l looked like him down there 
 why 
 he can aim when he goes 
 l can hit a mango leaf dead centre 
why does he have one he can aim
and we don t 
god  in his infinite wisdom 
decided    
well  nature gave us different parts 
 you see  a female has a  
 a cowrie shell 
 what 
 lilli looks like a cowrie shell there 
so that s what you call mine 
a cowrie shell 
 and we call richard s a  
 no  no  no  never mind 
l should have explained certain
of life s facts to you years ago 
 explain certain of life s facts now 
 no  l need to think about it first 
l ll explain it after your
spelling lesson tonight 
 let s rinse off 
 tonight 
all right  everybody 
why do people get married 
god commanded that when a man
and woman love each other   
   they take vows 
vows are like promises 
they make promises to each other
in the eyes of god 
and that s called
the marriage ceremony 
here s the ceremony
your father used to say   
   when he performed marriages
at the mission 
what about the life facts 
when a girl becomes a woman 
and a boy becomes a man  
 when s that 
 well  it s different for everyone   
    but you ll know when it happens 
 how 
lilli  your body will become rounder 
you ll grow breasts like mine 
and you ll bleed a bit
from between your legs 
l don t wanna bleed 
lt only lasts a few days 
and it s a great blessing
because it means you can have a baby 
 do l have to bleed 
 no  but your body will change too 
your voice gets deeper 
hair will grow on your face 
you d look handsome with a beard 
unless you want to scrape it off 
 l want the baby now 
 you can t  you re not ready yet 
also  you need the man
to make the baby inside you 
lnside me 
yes  there s a special place
inside a woman   
   where the baby stays nice
and warm and safe   
   until it s ready
to be born into the world 
how does the baby get in there 
well   
   after they re married 
the man and woman lie very   
    very close together and   
 l know  lt s like the iguanas  lilli 
you know  when they get so close
you can t tell them apart 
 that s it 
 that s it 
yes  lguanas have
their babies soon after 
 that s it  mother 
 well  that s most of it 
that s what l ve been waiting
to hear all day 
 that s not gonna help 
 look what you did to my spear  go away 
that was my fish 
go back out where you belong 
richard  look 
now what are we gonna do 
what are we gonna do now  richard 
 what are we gonna do 
 will you be quiet and let me think 
lilli 
richard 
we re out past sunset 
mother s gonna be angry 
 what are you doing 
 l ve got an idea 
he s coming  come on 
where have you been 
do you realize how late it is 
but there was this old shark in the
channel  he took richard s spear 
l told you to keep away from sharks 
 boat drifted loose 
 what are the rules 
 be home by sunset always 
 and 
 never to the north side of the island 
 do you see that  a full moon 
we are going straight home and this is
never happening again  do you hear me 
oh  lilli  richard 
go get some thatch 
get back inside 
our father  who art in heaven 
hallowed be thy name 
thy kingdom come  thy will be done 
on earth as it is in heaven 
give us this day our daily bread 
forgive us our trespasses as we   
   forgive those who trespass against
us  lead us not into temptation   
   but deliver us from evil  for thine is
the kingdom  power and glory forever 
l can feel that the sickness has moved
into my lungs now 
and that means l might not get well 
what s going to happen 
you may have to be here without me 
lf god wants   
   l ll be with your father and we ll
be guardian angels watching over you 
this is my special place 
lt s quiet here 
and l can see the house 
hollow out this ground about so deep 
and line it with thatch and moss 
then fill it in   
   and smooth it over with earth 
l ll write out a prayer for you to say 
we ll carve a marker and it will say 
   here lies sarah hargraves 
wife of william  mother of lillian      
and l know l m not your
real mother  richard 
but l would like to have it said 
  and mother of richard   
we pray the lord to grant
this last abiding wish 
that lilli and richard love each other 
take care of each other   
   and keep up with their lessons   
   and be prepared for the
ship when it comes  amen 
 breakfast looks extra good today 
 thank you 
 don t forget  you cook tomorrow 
 you re the one who always forgets 
 what  what do l forget 
 to colour your eggs for the hunt 
l didn t forget  l don t think
we should do it this year 
but we do it every easter 
the calendar marks say tomorrow s
easter  so we must have the hunt 
why 
how else do we know who finds
the most eggs and wins 
 wins what  richard 
 l don t know 
nothing  just wins 
lt seems silly to me  l don t
understand why we have to do it 
because mother would want us to 
l ve got an idea  whoever finds
the most eggs this year wins a prize 
what kind of a prize 
lf you win 
l ve gotta give you something 
and if l win 
you ve gotta give me something 
lt s a wonderful idea 
l hid ten eggs between
the beach and the berry patch 
l hid ten between the rocks
and the fern glade 
 ready 
 ready  get set  go 
l found nine  beat that 
 l only found eight 
 the winner s me  where s my prize 
you were down so long 
what were you doing 
you ll see 
your prize 
l m gonna keep this forever 
my prize  the white bead 
l think it looks nice in my hair 
do you 
l don t care what you do with it   
   or how you wear it 
you can hang it from your nose
for all l care 
back and forth 
round and round 
you think this whole reef is yours 
you think you can swallow
anything that swims 
you d like to catch me  wouldn t you 
but l was too fast  stupid sea slug 
l can beat you every time 
and if you don t believe me 
l ll prove it 
master of the reef 
the first time  he almost got me 
but l was too fast for him 
this time  he was lying in wait 
so l dive in 
and l can see down his mouth 
there s about 500 teeth 
there s fish around his gills 
and he comes at me 
he misses me  stupid sea slug 
 lt seems silly to me 
 silly  lt s not silly  lt s dangerous 
exactly  that s why it s silly 
l don t understand why you do it 
 l like the way it makes me feel
 what 
lnside here  lt feels all alive when
l know l m the master of the reef 
  the master of the reef 
the master of the reef   
hey  don t you ever make fun of me 
l m sorry 
besides  you re the silly one  always
touching and looking at yourself 
 l don t touch myself 
 yes  you do 
you re always touching those
when you look in the mirror 
l m just measuring
how much they ve grown 
 you shouldn t look when l m naked 
 why not 
 l always used to see you naked 
 lt s different now 
 why 
 l don t know 
l don t know why it s different 
but it is 
lilli 
l wish things could be
the way they used to be 
when we had fun 
remember the seesaw she made us 
the games we used to play 
ring around the rosy

pure silk

eel broth 
eel

the little white chunks

we appreciate your hospitality
and hope we can repay you

nothing whatever to do 
so you re bored 
like you must be here 
no  we re never bored

ln what way 
well  just look at her 
the way she s all covered up 
you said you found her clothes
stupid and unnecessary 
l do 
lt s just    
l wonder what she looks like
underneath all of them 
you mean you want to look at her   
   because you can t see her 
yes 
you remember when l wanted to go to the
north side  just because l couldn t

a beautiful fishpond 
ln plain view of everyone

but look at this  kind sir
