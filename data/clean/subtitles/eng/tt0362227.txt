new government

all the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended
the new government has sealed all
borders so your visas no longer valid

ok all right
thank you
so mr navorski
i have some very good news for you
what
ive figured out a way
to get you out of this airport
how
well we have laws here
that protect aliens
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country
if we can establish this fear with you
then the cbp will be forced
to begin expedited removal procedures
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum
asylum
mmhm asylum
unfortunately the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases
that the soonest youd get before
a judge would be six months from now
yes and we would have no choice
but to let you go for those six months
its the law youd be released
you would be free to wait
in new york until your court date
but believe it or not most people
never show up before the judge
so i go new york city
uhhuh
you can go to new york city tonight
but you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear
fear
mmhm fear
fear
fear
from what
thats the best part
it doesnt matter what youre afraid of
its all the same to uncle sam

i dont know how to react

yes ok
are you coming or going
i dont know both
tell me about it
napoleon
yeah i read a lot of history books
theyre long and cheap
like 1200 pages for 999
you cant beat that
but napoleon
yeah hes one of my favorites
you know what saved napoleons life
no
his ego
ego
yes
after he loses the battle of waterloo
napoleon isolates himself
on the tiny island of saint helena
no one knows exactly
what happens next
but the version i like goes like this
hes very depressed
and decides to take his own life
but napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job
his stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it
and he doesnt die
see ego saved his life
maybe he need glasses
glasses
yes to read words on bottle
poison
its funny you should say that
rumor has it
that napoleon was farsighted
there you go
there you go
there you go
and there you go
