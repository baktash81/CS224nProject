i hope you don t mind if i eat
while we talk  i ve a bit of bad news 
your country has suspended
all traveling privileges
on passports issued
by your government 
and our state department
has revoked the visa
that was going to allow you
to enter the us 
that s it in a nutshell  basically 
while you were in the air there
was a military coup in your country 
most of the dead were members
of the presidential guard 
they were attacked
in the middle of the night 
they got it all on ghn  i think 
there were few civilian casualties 
i m sure your family s fine 
mr  navorski  your country
was annexed from the inside 
the republic of krakozhia
is under new leadership 
krakozhia  krakozhia

the liberty rebels 
ok 
no more krakozhia  ok 
new government 
revolution  you understand 
all the flights in and out
of your country have been suspended 
the new government has sealed all
borders  so your visa s no longer valid 
so  currently
you are a citizen of nowhere 
now  we can t process you new papers
until the us recognizes your country s
new diplomatic reclassification 
you don t qualify for asylum 
refugee status 
temporary protective status 
humanitarian parole 
or non immigration work travel 
you don t qualify for any of these 
you are at this time simply   
   unacceptable 
  unacceptable

thank you 
so  mr  navorski 
i have some very good news for you 
what 
i ve figured out a way
to get you out of this airport 
how 
well  we have laws here
that protect aliens
who have a credible fear
of returning to their own country 
if we can establish this fear with you 
then the cbp will be forced
to begin expedited removal procedures 
to bring you to an immigration judge
and let you plead your case for asylum 
  asylum 
  mm hm  asylum 
unfortunately  the courts
are so backed up with asylum cases
that the soonest you d get before
a judge would be six months from now 
yes  and we would have no choice
but to let you go for those six months 
it s the law  you d be released 
you would be free to wait
in new york until your court date 
but  believe it or not  most people
never show up before the judge 
  so i go new york city 
  uh huh 
you can go to new york city tonight 
but  you only get to go
if we can establish a credible fear 
  fear 
  mm hm  fear 
  fear 
  fear 
from what 
that s the best part 
it doesn t matter what you re afraid of 
it s all the same to uncle sam 
so i m going to ask you one question 
if you give me the correct answer  i can
get you out of this airport tonight 
so  i answer one question 
go to new york city  tonight 
  tonight 
  tonight 
  tonight 
  tonight 
   laughs  ok

of returning to your own country

   viktor  good 
 amelia  man 
i am so sorry about what happened
last time  asking you out like that 
i m so used to guys
trying to grab my ass at 30 000 feet
that when i meet somebody that doesn t 
i don t know how to react 
  let s just start over 
  yes  ok 
  are you coming or going 
  i don t know  both 
tell me about it 
napoleon 
yeah  i read a lot of history books 
they re long and cheap 
like 1200 pages for  9 99 
you can t beat that 
  but napoleon 
  yeah  he s one of my favorites 
  you know what saved napoleon s life 
  no 
  his ego 
  ego 
yes 
after he loses the battle of waterloo 
napoleon isolates himself
on the tiny island of saint helena 
no one knows exactly
what happens next 
but the version i like goes like this 
he s very depressed
and decides to take his own life 
but napoleon believes himself
to be of such superhuman strength
that he takes six times the amount
of poison needed to do the job 
his stomach is so full up with poison
that his body rejects it 
and he doesn t die 
see  ego  saved his life 
maybe he need glasses 
  glasses 
  yes  to read words on bottle 
poison 
it s funny you should say that 
rumor has it
that napoleon was farsighted 
  there you go 
  there you go 
  there you go 
  and there you go 
i think we re rewriting history
right here 
why don t we talk about it over lunch
