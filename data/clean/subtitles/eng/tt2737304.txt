to get here is by the river
and i dont think
you could make it with kids
listen to me
im only gonna say this once
we are going on the trip now
its going to be rough
its gonna feel like
its going on for a long time
so its gonna be hard to stay alert
its gonna be even harder to be quiet
but you have to do both
you have to do every single thing i say
or we will not make it
understand
under no circumstance are you allowed
to take off your blindfold
if i find that you have i will hurt you
do you understand
its cold we have blankets
boy you have your dog
girl you have your kitty
this is just a place
theres nothing more that we need from it
do you understand
and no talking on the river
you must listen as closely as you can
if you hear something in the woods
you tell me
if you hear something in the water
you tell me
but you never ever
take off your blindfold
if you look you will die
do you understand
its okay
its okay its okay
kitty

lets go
okay okay
one two three four

where is it where is it
asshole i was listening to that
yeah so were the people down the street
the store was packed
this thing seems serious
wow you literally have no food
what what thing
are you serious
im serious
turn on the news dumbdumb
dumbdumb
what channel dumbdumb
any one of them
airports and train stations
have shut down
streets are crowded with people
escaping cities by car and on foot
as witnesses report
unexplained mass suicides
first recorded in romania
theres now an alarming spread
of incidents into europe and siberia
estimated death toll
is in the tens of thousands
dont yet know what is causing
the mass suicides in europe and russia
the eyewitness reports tell of people
exhibiting psychotic behavior
our sources are telling us
this does not appear to be
pathological or viral
us authorities are advising the public
to remain calm
there have been
no officially confirmed inst
well its in russia so
well try telling that to the soccer moms
fighting over bottled water
speaking of which
i just got off the phone with mom
how come i have to update her
about you all the time
why do you have to talk about me
im not telling her about my life
at three oclock im gonna go check out
an arabian stud in sausalito
see now that is a sentence
you dont hear every day
you wanna come
i cant ive got my ob with dr lapham
lapham when
oh my god
why does your voice get high
when it gets excited
how about i drive you
no im fine
i can go in we can maybe see the baby
or i can cancel the appointment
and we can go and see a horse
no fuck the horse
wow such venom
what do you think
i think i see
a whole bunch of people sitting together
but they all feel incredibly lonely
the loneliness is just incidental
its really about
peoples inability to connect
inability to connect to what
can you move
malorie
i need you to move
weve been through this
thats not how its gonna be for you
its different with a baby
its an immediate love affair
its not gonna be that way for me
yes it will
no maam
you should be afraid of being alone
not of this
and what we need to do is get you
out into the real world
with other people
not stuck in this house all day
you never leave
why should i leave
i have you to get me groceries
you have to move
no not moving
yes you do
not moving
why
not moving i love my house
i know it took you a long time
to find a studio you loved
and ever since ryan left
youve gotten a lot more work done
but so fine so no more roommates
ryan was not a roommate
it turns out he kind of was
anyway cant raise a kid here
where would you even put her
how do you know its a she
wishful thinking i guess
sorry its work
ill be there in a second
hi
yeah they just had
to push the surgery back an hour
yes
yeah
ill call right back
what
you still dont wanna know the gender
and ruin the surprise dr lapham no
how have you been feeling
have you been sleeping any better
rough
i never slept well
before i had this condition
its called pregnancy
its okay to say it out loud
oh dont you know doctor
if you dont acknowledge a thing
it simply goes away
oh really all this time i had no idea
when a horse gets pregnant
god the horse
you know about horses when a horse
gets pregnant it knows right away
does it
it changes the way it eats
it changes its gait
it bites all the other horses
who come too close
its too bad were not horses
it is too bad great to be a horse
then we would have like a mother
who would have actually raised us
and a father
off on some faraway stud farm
hold on
our father was off on a faraway stud farm
that is correct
that is correct
poor us
we should go feel sorry for ourselves
with lunch and a bottle of wine
oh finally
now youre making some sense
good
really in front of me
we didnt mean it
no like a tiny glass of rosé
is not gonna hurt the little bean
im pretty sure i heard the word bottle
you might want to think of a name
besides little bean
seeing as your child
is now the size of a small melon
small melon
i know its hard to love someone
you havent met yet
oh thats beautiful
thought about stitching that on
like a little lavender sachet
could sell them in the gift shop
in the gift shop
youre having a baby malorie
pretty soon you and i jessica
and some hardass labor and delivery nurse
will be on the third floor
making the same wise cracks
only this time
you wont be going home by yourself
i know i know
but if thats not what you want
there are plenty of couples
who are desperate to adopt a child
there are no judgments here
you can make whatever choice you want
but what you cant do is ignore it
and hope it just goes away
you okay in there
im great
are you puking
just go to the car
is it chunky
no it was actually the really smooth kind
that just shoots out real clean
ill meet you at the car okay

gotta be an image out there
they must have released some video

my crew saw one
what
what
one minute
we were digging a foundation
and then my contractor just lies down
in front of the bulldozer
and then my operator tips the rig
into the ditch and snaps his own neck
it seems like if you look at it

the president has declared
a state of emergency
and has closed all borders
do not do not go outside
avoid social media use radi
what what in the shit is happening
its an end game man
im sorry what
the end game humanity has been judged
and weve been found wanting
judged by who
they go by different names
you got world religion and mythology
thats full of mentions of demons
or spirit creatures
people whove seen these creatures
almost always describe
their encounter as this
as with an entity that takes on
a form of your worst fears or
your deepest sadness
or your greatest loss
sounds like bullshit to me
religious talk
its not bullshit okay
its real talk its facts
they come in all different forms
you got the aka manah the varios daevas
from ancient zoroastrian legend
youve got the surgat
from ancient christian occult beliefs
that made pregnant women encounter
their unborn children as other creatures
such as lobsters or spiders
youve got the hulijing from china
youve got the puca from celtic mythology
all different names but the same thing
and whats that
the end of us
charlie did you learn all of that
working at the supermarket

my husband was deployed last month
cause hes in the air force
i tried to make stuff last
as long as i could
but i was so hungry
and i was afraid i would starve my baby
so i didnt know what to do
have some water
thank you
so you left and started knocking
on random doors
i only live a block away
great now we can all starve
here in the maternity ward
it just means we need
to get more supplies
of course but we cant get anything
if we cant see
oh were so fucking trapped
maybe not
maybe we can see better than we thought
what do you mean
come here
we have cameras around the house
transmitting a live feed
come upstairs come on
its a digitized signal
it just shows the color temperatures
of the objects its neutered information
colors on a flat screen
but an image can still have power
we have no idea
how these things can operate
these images are not direct
we cant look at whatever it is
with the naked eye
but maybe we can with a translator
pixels and heat
maybe it wont even show up
well were not gonna find out
until one of us takes a look
i think its a huge mistake
you would douglas
you think everything is a huge mistake
sooner or later
were gonna have to do something
we dont know how long
were gonna have electricity
you gotta trust me on this
i really think this is gonna work
okay okay
maybe if it does we could use
the technology for supply runs or
exactly
just not too tight
i hope you know what youre doing
listen you and your husband
youre good people
you know it wasnt it wasnt that
thank you douglas
you dont have to do this
i know dont worry
tom i need the remote

this part of their house

wheres charlie
another novel i wont have to read
he saved us you fucking asshole
i know what you think of me
what everybody thinks of me
you know in the divorce petition
my first wife said that to call me a creep
would be an affront to creeps everywhere
my second wife said
she no longer feared going to hell
cause it couldnt possibly be worse
than being married to me
think i would have loved them
maybe
and then lydia
third time really was the charm for me
she was the kindest person i ever met
but im here and shes gone
you know why that is
because in the end
there are only two types of people
the assholes and the dead
god you sound like my father
like your father why
was he a towering intellect given
to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools
yes he was fluent in asshole as well
and just like you he blamed
everything he did on some deeper meaning
convoluted conspiracy theories and
how it was everybody elses fault
when he was clearly in the wrong
but you know once my sister and i
realized it was just an excuse
to treat his family like shit
it made life a little easier
you know what though
i see one difference between us
im never wrong
you are
youre two pricks in a pod

the hair the hair is different

ordered to patrol the streets
make sure everybody was safe
one morning we saw
this father walking with his four kids
so i pulled over to make sure
everything was okay
and to make sure he got
wherever he was going safely
come to find out
he was walking his kids to school
in the middle of all that shit
all that chaos
he was walking his kids to school
so
so we just followed him
day after day
we escorted him
that just became our routine
and then at the end of our time
he gave me this
when it was time to come back home
i like to think hes still
walking his kids to school

who is this
my name is rick
who is this
rick this is tom
we have a place
a compound with enough supplies
we have a community
its safe here
were down by the rivers end
where are you
dont answer that
near pikes quarry
jesus youre a ways away
how many of you are there
four of us
are any of them children
dont do not say anything
its okay its okay
no why
because the fastest way
to get here is by the river
and i dont think
you could make it with kids
wait the river
float downstream as far as you can
stay on the water
until you hit the rapids
the water is fast there its dangerous
weve lost some people
you need to see clearly
what does that mean
what do you mean see clearly
you will have to look
im telling you
rick well have blindfolds on
we cant look
im glad you said that
someone will have to take a
prepare for two days journey
at the pace of the rivers current
bring supplies for longer
how do i find you after the rapids rick
youll hear the birds
weve got a lot of them
just follow the sound to us
down a small embankment
youll find a wall with a gate
thats our
thats their what
thats our what
rick
rick
it could be real
no
could be the truth
could be is not good enough
what if rick could help us
and what if rick is one of them
wait he knew about the birds
oh my god gary knew about the birds
and he put them in the freezer
i cannot believe
youre actually thinking about this
every house has run out of food
we have to move
you really dont think i know that
you dont think i know that
when i was little
we had a boat just like this
and every single summer
we would take it to the lake
every summer
you guys would have loved it up there
they had trees they had flowers
the water was warm
the clouds were in the sky
wed all play in the water
all the kids all the children
we would all just run
up and down the shore
there were other children in the world
yeah just like you just like you
like you
one day we saw
this really really big oak tree
it was bigger than this house
it was so big and old
i couldnt see the top of it
guess what we did
climbed it
we climbed it yes we climbed it
we climbed it and climbed it
until we got to the top
guess what we saw when we got to the top
boy girl time for bed
but toms telling a story
mal let me just were almost done
im not gonna say it again come on
girl come on

come on

bed
what are you doing
what are you doing
now they think theyre gonna go outside
and climb trees with all these new kids
and see butterflies and flowers
its a story
its not a story its a lie
because theyll never climb trees
they are never gonna make new friends
why make them believe that
they have to believe in something
what is this for
if they dont have anything to believe in
so that they survive
surviving is not living
theyre gonna die if they listen to you
life is more than just what is its
what could be what you could make it
you need to promise them dreams
that may never come true
you need to love them knowing
that you may lose them at any second
they deserve dreams they deserve love
they deserve hope they deserve a mother
they deserve a mother
you havent given them names mal
their names are boy and girl
think about that
every single decision i have made
has been for them
every single one
you know what i saw
at the top of the tree
i saw a nest
with five birds
sitting on the top branch
