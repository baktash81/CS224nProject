how many of you are there 
are any of them children 
because the fastest way
to get here is by the river 
and i don t think
you could make it with kids 
listen to me 
i m only gonna say this once 
we are going on the trip now 
it s going to be rough 
it s gonna feel like
it s going on for a long time 
so it s gonna be hard to stay alert 
it s gonna be even harder to be quiet 
but you have to do both 
you have to do every single thing i say
or we will not make it 
understand 
under no circumstance are you allowed
to take off your blindfold 
if i find that you have  i will hurt you 
do you understand 
it s cold  we have blankets 
boy  you have your dog 
girl  you have your kitty 
this is just a place 
there s nothing more that we need from it 
do you understand 
and no talking on the river 
you must listen as closely as you can 
if you hear something in the woods 
you tell me 
if you hear something in the water 
you tell me 
but you never  ever
take off your blindfold 
if you look  you will die 
do you understand 
it s okay 
it s okay  it s okay 
  kitty 
  it s okay  it s okay 
let s go 
okay  okay 
one  two  three  four 
five  six  seven  eight 
twenty eight  twenty nine  thirty 
okay  this way  it s fine 
thirty one  thirty two  thirty three 
where is it  where is it 
  asshole  i was listening to that 
  yeah  so were the people down the street 
the store was packed 
this thing seems serious 
wow  you literally have no food 
  what    what thing 
  are you serious 
  i m serious 
  turn on the news  dumb dumb 
dumb dumb 
  what channel  dumb dumb 
  any one of them 
airports and train stations
have shut down 
streets are crowded with people
escaping cities by car and on foot
as witnesses report
unexplained mass suicides 
first recorded in romania 
there s now an alarming spread
of incidents into europe and siberia 
estimated death toll
is in the tens of thousands 
don t yet know what is causing
the mass suicides in europe and russia 
the eyewitness reports tell of people
exhibiting psychotic behavior 
our sources are telling us
this does not appear to be
pathological or viral 
us authorities are advising the public
to remain calm 
there have been
no officially confirmed inst   
well  it s in russia  so   
well  try telling that to the soccer moms
fighting over bottled water 
speaking of which 
i just got off the phone with mom 
how come i have to update her
about you all the time 
  why do you have to talk about me 
  i m not telling her about my life 
at three o clock  i m gonna go check out
an arabian stud in sausalito 
see  now that is a sentence
you don t hear every day 
  you wanna come 
  i can t  i ve got my ob with dr  lapham 
  lapham  when 
  oh  my god 
why does your voice get high
when it gets excited 
  how about i drive you 
  no  i m fine 
i can go in  we can maybe see the baby 
or i can cancel the appointment
and we can go and see a horse 
no  fuck the horse 
wow  such venom 
what do you think 
i think i see
a whole bunch of people sitting together 
but they all feel incredibly lonely 
the loneliness is just incidental 
it s really about
people s inability to connect 
inability to connect to what 
  can you move 
  malorie 
  i need you to move 
  we ve been through this 
that s not how it s gonna be for you 
it s different with a baby 
it s an immediate love affair 
  it s not gonna be that way for me 
  yes  it will 
  no  ma am 
  you should be afraid of being alone 
not of this 
and what we need to do is get you   
out into the real world
with other people 
not stuck in this house all day 
you never leave 
why should i leave 
i have you to get me groceries 
  you have to move 
  no  not moving 
  yes  you do 
  not moving 
  why 
  not moving  i love my house 
i know it took you a long time
to find a studio you loved 
and ever since ryan left 
you ve gotten a lot more work done 
but  so fine  so no more roommates 
ryan was not a roommate 
it turns out he kind of was 
anyway  can t raise a kid here 
where would you even put her 
how do you know it s a she 
wishful thinking  i guess 
sorry  it s work 
i ll be there in a second 
hi 
yeah  they just had
to push the surgery back an hour 
yes 
yeah 
i ll call right back 
what 
you still don t wanna know the gender 
and ruin the surprise  dr  lapham  no 
how have you been feeling 
have you been sleeping any better 
rough 
i never slept well
before i had this condition 
it s called pregnancy 
it s okay to say it out loud 
oh  don t you know  doctor 
if you don t acknowledge a thing 
it simply goes away 
oh  really  all this time  i had no idea 
  when a horse gets pregnant   
  god  the horse 
you know about horses  when a horse
gets pregnant  it knows right away 
does it 
it changes the way it eats 
it changes its gait 
it bites all the other horses
who come too close 
it s too bad we re not horses 
it is too bad  great to be a horse 
then we would have  like  a mother
who would have actually raised us
and a father
off on some faraway stud farm 
hold on 
our father was off on a faraway stud farm 
  that is correct 
  that is correct 
poor us 
we should go feel sorry for ourselves
with lunch and a bottle of wine 
oh  finally 
now you re making some sense 
  good 
  really  in front of me 
we didn t mean it   
no  like a tiny glass of rosé
is not gonna hurt the little bean 
i m pretty sure i heard the word bottle 
you might want to think of a name
besides little bean
seeing as your child
is now the size of a small melon 
small melon 
i know it s hard to love someone
you haven t met yet 
oh  that s beautiful 
thought about stitching that on 
like  a little lavender sachet 
  could sell them in the gift shop 
  in the gift shop 
you re having a baby  malorie 
pretty soon you and i  jessica 
and some hard ass labor and delivery nurse
will be on the third floor
making the same wise cracks 
only this time 
you won t be going home by yourself 
i know  i know 
but if that s not what you want 
there are plenty of couples
who are desperate to adopt a child 
there are no judgments here 
you can make whatever choice you want 
but what you can t do is ignore it
and hope it just goes away 
you okay in there 
i m great 
are you puking 
just go to the car 
is it chunky 
no  it was actually the really smooth kind
that just shoots out real clean 
i ll meet you at the car  okay

we just all gotta try to stay calm 
  really

gotta be an image out there 
they must have released some video 
  i haven t seen anything 
  my crew saw one 
  what 
  what 
one minute 
we were digging a foundation   
and then my contractor just lies down
in front of the bulldozer 
and then my operator tips the rig
into the ditch and snaps his own neck 
it seems like if you look at it 
it makes you crazy
or it makes you wanna hurt yourself 
no  it makes you kill yourself 
and you just   
you just look at it 
  and you commit suicide 
  how can that be 
close the windows  get the windows

  the president has declared
a state of emergency
and has closed all borders 
do not  do not go outside 
avoid social media  use radi   
what  what in the shit is happening 
  it s an end game  man 
  i m sorry  what 
the end game  humanity has been judged 
and we ve been found wanting 
  judged  by who 
  they go by different names 
you got world religion and mythology
that s full of mentions of demons
or spirit creatures 
people who ve seen these creatures
almost always describe
their encounter as this   
as with an entity that takes on
a form of your worst fears or   
your deepest sadness
or your greatest loss 
sounds like bullshit to me 
religious talk 
it s not bullshit  okay 
it s real talk  it s facts 
they come in all different forms 
you got the aka manah  the varios daevas
from ancient zoroastrian legend 
you ve got the surgat
from ancient christian occult beliefs
that made pregnant women encounter
their unborn children as other creatures
such as lobsters or spiders 
you ve got the huli jing from china 
you ve got the puca from celtic mythology 
all different names  but the same thing 
and what s that 
the end of us 
charlie  did you learn all of that
working at the supermarket 
  no  i ve been studying it for years 
  in college

i mean the internet  that s where you get
all your information from 
  i m working on a novel  guys

i will be sure to update you 
my husband works in trusts and estates 
what kind of law do you practice 
  bankruptcy

are you on your own 
yeah  i am 
my husband was deployed last month
 cause he s in the air force 
i tried to make stuff last
as long as i could   
but i was so hungry
and i was afraid i would starve my baby 
so i didn t know what to do 
  have some water 
  thank you 
so you left and started knocking
on random doors 
i only live a block away 
great  now we can all starve
here in the maternity ward 
it just means we need
to get more supplies 
of course  but we can t get anything
if we can t see 
oh  we re so fucking trapped 
maybe not 
maybe we can see better than we thought 
  what do you mean 
  come here 
we have cameras around the house
transmitting a live feed 
come upstairs  come on 
it s a digitized signal 
it just shows the color temperatures
of the objects  it s neutered information 
  colors on a flat screen 
  but an image can still have power 
we have no idea
how these things can operate 
these images are not direct 
we can t look at whatever it is
with the naked eye 
but maybe we can with a translator 
pixels and heat 
maybe it won t even show up 
well  we re not gonna find out
until one of us takes a look 
i think it s a huge mistake 
you would  douglas 
you think everything is a huge mistake 
sooner or later
we re gonna have to do something 
we don t know how long
we re gonna have electricity 
you gotta trust me on this 
i really think this is gonna work 
okay  okay 
maybe if it does  we could use
the technology for supply runs or   
exactly 
just not too tight 
i hope you know what you re doing 
listen    you and your husband 
you re good people 
you know  it wasn t    it wasn t that 
thank you  douglas 
you don t have to do this 
i know  don t worry 
  tom  i need the remote 
  yeah 
there you go  bud 
so why are you suing him 
 cause they want to tear down
this part of their house
and build some glass monstrosity 
his husband s an architect 
it s his property 
why do you care what he builds 
because i have to look at it 
not a chance 
well  the world s ending  baby 
so you never know 
where are you  motherfucker 
come on  greg 
focus

to be close considering   
sure 
you know 
this way  we won t be lonely

about how pregnant women
should always sleep next to someone
because the baby can sense
when the mother is lonely 
perfect 
so

when the creatures are around 
where s charlie 
another novel i won t have to read 
he saved us  you fucking asshole 
i know what you think of me 
what everybody thinks of me 
you know  in the divorce petition   
my first wife said that to call me a creep
would be an affront to creeps everywhere 
my second wife said
she no longer feared going to hell 
 cause it couldn t possibly be worse
than being married to me 
think i would have loved them 
maybe 
and then lydia 
third time really was the charm for me 
she was the kindest person i ever met 
but i m here and she s gone 
you know why that is 
because  in the end 
there are only two types of people 
the assholes and the dead 
god  you sound like my father 
like your father  why 
was he a towering intellect given
to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools 
yes  he was fluent in asshole as well 
and just like you  he blamed
everything he did on some deeper meaning 
convoluted conspiracy theories and   
how it was everybody else s fault
when he was clearly in the wrong 
but  you know  once my sister and i
realized it was just an excuse
to treat his family like shit 
it made life a little easier 
you know what though 
i see one difference between us 
i m never wrong 
you are   
you re two pricks in a pod 
do i look like him as well 
not really 
  he wasn t exquisitely handsome

  the hair 
  yeah

oh  i can t 
oh  come on  the world is ending

of whiskey s gonna tip the scales  do you

about the assholes and the dead 
i hope there is more

at the end of my deployment in iraq 
we were stationed at this village   
ordered to patrol the streets 
make sure everybody was safe 
one morning  we saw   
this father walking with his four kids 
so i pulled over to make sure
everything was okay
and to make sure he got
wherever he was going safely 
come to find out 
he was walking his kids to school 
in the middle of all that shit 
all that chaos 
he was walking his kids to school 
so   
so we just followed him 
day after day 
we escorted him 
that just became our routine 
and then  at the end of our time 
he gave me this
when it was time to come back home 
i like to think he s still
walking his kids to school

we went to my colleague carl s
house to lay low 
everything was fine until
they broke in 
creatures don t break into people s homes 
no  not the creatures  these psychos 
these psychos from northwood 
northwood 
i don t    where is that 
it s a mental institution
for the criminally insane 
well  it s nice to know
they have hall passes now 
and then what 
they took us outside
and they forced our eyes open
so that we would have
to look at the creatures 
what 
  did you look 
  no 
somehow  my friend carl managed to tackle
one of these people to the ground
and the rest of us made a run for it 
i just kept on running
and running and running till i got here 
i ve been knocking on
all the doors and nobody answered 
until you did  so   
thank you 
birds 
the scariest thing was
when these people broke in  they   
they weren t wearing blindfolds 
it s like they didn t need them 
but they d been outside 
you have to wear blindfolds 
not these people 
these crazy guys
weren t affected like everyone else 
they wanted to see 
they were happy 
they were so glad 
and they said everyone needed to see

we re not bringing
any more strangers in here 
not while i m alive 
i won t tell you again  get up and get

  purely survival 
  yeah

  hello 
  hello 
who is this 
my name is rick 
who is this 
rick  this is tom 
we have a place 
a compound with enough supplies   
we have a community 
it s safe here 
we re down by the river s end 
  where are you 
  don t answer that 
near pike s quarry 
jesus  you re a ways away 
how many of you are there 
four of us 
are any of them children 
  don t  do not say anything 
  it s okay  it s okay 
no  why 
because the fastest way
to get here is by the river 
and i don t think
you could make it with kids 
wait  the river 
float downstream as far as you can 
stay on the water
until you hit the rapids 
the water is fast there  it s dangerous 
we ve lost some people 
you need to see clearly 
  what does that mean 
  what do you mean  see clearly 
you will have to look 
  i m telling you 
  rick  we ll have blindfolds on 
we can t look 
i m glad you said that 
someone will have to take a   
prepare for two days  journey
at the pace of the river s current 
bring supplies for longer 
how do i find you after the rapids  rick 
you ll hear the birds 
we ve got a lot of them 
just follow the sound to us 
down a small embankment 
you ll find a wall with a gate 
that s our   
  that s their what 
  that s our what 
rick 
rick 
it could be real 
  no 
  could be the truth 
  could be is not good enough 
  what if rick could help us 
and what if rick is one of them 
wait  he knew about the birds 
oh  my god  gary knew about the birds
and he put them in the freezer 
i cannot believe
you re actually thinking about this 
every house has run out of food 
we have to move 
you really don t think i know that 
you don t think i know that 
when i was little 
we had a boat just like this 
and every single summer 
we would take it to the lake 
every summer 
you guys would have loved it up there 
they had trees  they had flowers 
the water was warm 
the clouds were in the sky 
we d all play in the water 
all the kids  all the children 
we would all just run
up and down the shore 
there were other children in the world 
yeah  just like you  just like you 
like you 
one day  we saw
this really  really big oak tree 
it was bigger than this house 
it was so big and old 
i couldn t see the top of it 
  guess what we did 
  climbed it 
we climbed it  yes  we climbed it 
we climbed it and climbed it
until we got to the top 
guess what we saw when we got to the top 
boy  girl  time for bed 
but tom s telling a story 
  mal  let me just    we re almost done 
  i m not gonna say it again  come on 
girl  come on 
right now 
come on 
right now 
bed 
  what are you doing 
  what are you doing 
now they think they re gonna go outside
and climb trees with all these new kids 
  and see butterflies and flowers 
  it s a story 
it s not a story  it s a lie 
because they ll never climb trees 
they are never gonna make new friends 
  why make them believe that 
  they have to believe in something 
what is this for
if they don t have anything to believe in 
  so that they survive 
  surviving is not living 
they re gonna die if they listen to you 
life is more than just what is  it s
what could be  what you could make it 
you need to promise them dreams
that may never come true 
you need to love them knowing
that you may lose them at any second 
they deserve dreams  they deserve love 
they deserve hope  they deserve a mother 
they deserve a mother 
you haven t given them names  mal 
their names are boy and girl 
think about that 
every single decision i have made
has been for them 
every single one 
you know what i saw 
at the top of the tree 
i saw a nest 
with five birds 
sitting on the top branch 
and then they just flew away 
got it  got it  sit  sit 
it s safe  come in 
no  you did not
