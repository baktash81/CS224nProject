ok  let me get this straight 
we gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess
 just so farquaad will give you back the swamp 
which you only don t have 
  cause he filled it with freaks on the first place 
 is that about right 
  you know what 
maybe there is a good reason  donkeys shouldn t talk 
i don t get it shrek 
 why didn t you just pull some ogre stuff on them 
you know just pull their hearts  grab their bones to make you brave 
you know the whole ogre trick 
oh  you know what  maybe i could have decapitated entire village
and put their heads on plate 
got a knife  cut open their spleens and drink their fluids 
does that sound good to you 
a  no  not really  no 
for your information there is alto more to ogres then people think 
 example 
 example 
ok  a  ogres are like onions 
 they stink   yes  no 
 o  they make you cry 
 no 
oh  you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and gets brown hair 
no  layers  onions have layers 
ogres have layers  onions have layers 
you get it  we both have layers 
o  you both have layers 
you know not everybody likes onions 
cake  everybody like cakes  cakes have layers 
i don t care what everyone likes 
ogres are not like cakes 
you know what everyone likes  paffe 
have you ever met a person and you say   hey  let s get some paffe 
and
they say i don t like paffe  paffe is delicious 
no  you tensed  irritating  miniature peace of barden 
ogres are like onions  end of story 
bye  bye  see you lather 
paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet 
you know i think i ve preferred you humming
do you have a tissue or something   cause i m making a mess 
just the word paffe has made me start slimying
why  shrek  did you do that 
man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off 
my mouth was opened and everything 
believe me donkey  if it was me  you d be dead 
it s brimstone  we must be getting close 
yeah  right  brimstone 
don t be talking mr  brimstone  i know what i smell and what no brimstone 
and they don t come of stone neither 
sure it s big enough  but look at the location 
oh  shrek  remember when you said that ogres have layers 
oh  yeah 
well  i have a confession to make  donkeys don t have layers 
have  sleeves 
wait a second  donkeys don t have sleeves 
 you know what i mean 
  oh  you can t tell me you re afraid of highs 
no  i m just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge
 over boiling lake of lava 
come on donkey  i m right here beside you  ok 
for emotional support 
we ll just hackle this together one little baby step after time 
 really 
  really really 
ok  that makes me feel so much better

so where is this fire breathing pain in the neck animal 
inside  waiting for us to rescue her 
i was talking about the dragon shrek 
 are you afraid 
  no  but shhhhh 
oh  good  me neither 
because there s nothing wrong with being afraid 
here s a responsible situation 
not to mention dangerous situation 
and there s dragon that breathes fire 
i m sure he s meaner then a cow or anything  but they re scare 
 you know what i mean 
i m sure he s heavier then a cow   
donkey  two things  ok

well  at lest we know where the princess is 
 but where is the   
 dragon 
donkey  look out 
got you 
oh  what large teeth you have 
i mean  white sparking teeth 
you probably hear this all the time from your food  but
you must bleach yourself  because
that is one dashing smile you got there 
and do i detect the hint of minty freshness 
and you know what else 
you re a girl dragon  oh  sure  i mean  course you re a girl dragon 
 cause you re just ricking the feminine beauty out 
what s the matter with you  do you have something in your eye 
man  i d really love to stay  but you know i m a asthmatic and
i don t know if we would worked out  you d be blowing smoke and stuff 
shrek 
no  shrek  shrek

  what 
are you princess fiona 
i am 
awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me 
oh  that s nice  now let s go 
but wait  sir knight 
this be our first meeting 
should not be wonderful  romantic moment 
yeah  sorry lady there s no time 
hey  what are you doing 
you know  you should sweep me out of my feet 
out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed 
you ve had a lot of time to plan this  haven t you 
aha 
but we have to sing through this moment 
you can residing of a poem to me 
a ballad  a sonnet  a libretti  or something 
i don t think so 
well  can i at least know a name of my champion 
shrek 
so  shrek 
i pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude 
thanks 
 you didn t slay the dragon 
  it s not my job to do this  now  come on 
but this isn t right 
that s what all the other knights did 
yeah  right before they burst in the flame 
that s not the point 
wait  where are you going  exit is over there 
well  i have to save my ass 
what kind of knight are you 
one of a kind 
   rush into physical relationship 
i m not that emotionally ready for commitment of a  magnitude 
that was the word i was looking for  magnitude 
hey  that is unwanted physical contact 
hey  what are you doing 
ok  ok  let s just back up a little
and take this one step at the time 
i mean  we really should get to know each other first  you know what am i saying 
as friends  maybe even as   
hey don t do that  that s my tail  that s my personal tail 
and you re going to tear it off    
oh  no  no 
 it talks  
 yeah  it s getting to shut up    
ok  you two  head for the exit 
i ll take care of the dragon 
ruuuuun 
you did it  you rescued me 
amizing  you re wonderful  you re a    
   a little unconvencional to admit  but
by deed is great and by heart is pure  i m entirely in your debt 
and where would a brave knight be without his noble steed 
i hope you heard that  she called me a noble steed 
she thinks i m a steed 
the battle is won  you may remove your helmet good sir knight 
 a  no 
  why not 
i have helmet hair 
please  i wouldst look opponent face of my rescuer 
oh  no  you wouldn t  dust 
but  how will you kiss me 
what  that wasn t in a job description 
 maybe it s a perk 
  no  it s destiny 
you must know how it goes 
a princess locked in a tower guarded by a dragon
 is rescued by a brave knight 
and then they share true loves first kiss 
with shrek  you think  wait   
   you think shrek is your true love 
well  yes 
you think shrek is your true love 
what is so funny 
let s just say  i m not your type  ok 
of course you are  you re my rescuer 
now remove your helmet 
look  i really don t think this is a good idea 
 just take off the helmet 
  i m not going to 
 take it off 
  no 
 now 
  ok  easy 
as you command your highness 
you re an ogre 
oh  you ware expecting prince charming 
well  yes actually 
no  this is all wrong  you re not supposed to be an ogre 
princess  i was sent to rescue by lord farquaad  ok 
he s the one  who wants to marry you 
well  then why didn t he come to rescue me 
good question  you should ask him that  when we get there 
but i have to be rescued by my true love 
not by some ogre and his pet 
well so much for noble steed 
look princess  you re not making my job any easier 
well i m sorry  but your job is not my problem 
you can tell lord farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly 
i ll be waiting him right here 
hey  i m no ones messenger boy  all right 
 i m a delivery boy 
 you wouldn t dare 
 you coming donkey 
 put me down 
yeah  i m right behind you 
put me down or you will suffer the consequences 
this is not dignified  put me down 
ok  here s another question  let s say that a woman  digged  you 
 but you don t really like her 
that way  now  how you let her down real easy 
 so her feelings aren t hurt 
but you don t get burned to a crisp neither  how do you do that 
just tell her  she s not your true love 
everyone knows what happens when you   
hey  the sooner we get to dulock  the better 
oh  yeah  you gonna love it there princess  it s beautiful 
and what of my groom to be  lord farquaad  what s he like 
well  let me put it this way  princess 
men of farquaads stature are in short supply 
oh no  shrek  there are those who think little of him 
stop it  stop it  both of you 
you know  you re just jealous that you can never measure up
 to a great ruler like lord farquaad 
yeah  well maybe you re right princess  but i d like you do
 that measuring when you see him tomorrow
tomorrow 
it will take that long 
 shouldn t we stop to make camp 
  no  that would take longer 
we can keep going 
but there are robbers in the woods 
whoa  time out shrek  camp is definitely something that sounds good 
hey  come on  i m scarier then anything
 we re gonna see in this forest 
i need to find somewhere to camp  now 
hey  over here 
shrek  we can do better then that 
now  i don t think this is decent for princess 
no  no  it s perfect  it just needs a few homey touches 
homey touches  like what
