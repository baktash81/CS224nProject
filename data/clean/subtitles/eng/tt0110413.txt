i trust you 
one thing s got
nothing to do with the other 
remember that  leon

the rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use 
because it lets you keep
your distance from the client 
the closer you get to being a pro 
the closer you can get to the client 
the knife  for example 
is the last thing you learn 
ok

last minute  it reflects light 
they can see you coming from
a mile away

you love your plant  don t you 
it s my best friend

so that it can have roots   
i m the one you should be
watering if you want me to grow 
you re right 
no 
yes

they gotta be jumping out of
the plate  they gotta be alive 
it s been a longtime  leon

as good as working  leon 
tony 
all the money i make   
that you keep for me 
you need some money

you met a woman 
leon 
you gotta be careful with women 
remember when you arrived in this
country  leon  when i took you in 
you were still wet behind
the fucking ears 
and already you were in deep shit
because of a woman   
don t forget that  leon 
wish i could  sometimes

maybe i could give    little   
to someone 
you know  to help out 
hey  it s your money  i mean 
i m just holding it for you 
you know  like a bank  except that  you
know  better than a bank because 
you know  banks are always
knocked off 
and no one knocks off old tony 
and besides  in a bank
there s always tons of forms
to be filled and all that shit 
but old tony  nothing to read 
nothing to write

mathilda  since i met you 
everything s been different 
so  i just need some time alone 
and you need some time to grow up
a little 
i ve finished growing up  leon 
i just get oider 
and for me  it s the opposite 
i m old enough 
i need time to grow up 
shit 
you re new  aren t you  fifth floor right 
well you can t sit here like that 
really  why not 
nothing s free  like a parking meter 
when you stop  you pay 
it s the law 
only on tv   
what did you say 
forget it 
how much is your meter 
ten dollars    a month 
got change 
don t worry about it 
we ll do ten for twelve 
i ll pay enough for
the rest of the year  ok 
ok  a year 
does paying rent here mean
i have to put up with you guys

i need to think 
stand up  don t you like your job

thai  maybe 
i ve got it  italian food

mathilda 
mathilda 
mathilda 
i want you to put
the sack on the floor 
good 
and now i want you to tell me
everything you know about
italian food 
and don t forget the name
of the chef who fixed for me 
nobody sent me 
i do business for myself 
so this is something personal 
is it 
what filthy piece of shit
did i do now 
you killed my brother 
i m sorry 
and you wanna join him 
no 
it s always the same thing 
it s when you start to become
really afraid of death 
that you learn to appreciate life 
do you like life  sweetheart 
yes 
that s good 
because i take no pleasure
in taking life   
if it s from a person
who doesn t care about it 
stan 
stan 
shit  stan  i ve been looking all over
for you  man  i ve checked upstairs  and   
what  i m busy 
it s malky  man  he s dead 
malky was making a buy for us
from the chinamen 
yeah  but they got
nothing to do with it  man 
they told me  this guy
came from the outside 
he was a pro  he was fast 
he fucking came outta nowhere 
boom  shoots the chinamen
dead in two seconds 
easy man  i m a cop 
then turns around  says
something to malky like   
no women  no kids 
i think it was something personal 
death is    whimsical today 
blood  you hear me 
yeah man  i hear you stan 
just chill out man 
would you take her up
to my office 
all right  yeah 
jesus fucking christ 
 leon  my love  
 i know where to find the guys
who killed my brother  
 their boss is norman stansfield 
 and he is in the dea building 
room 4602  
 i m gonna do that myself 
if something goes wrong  
 i left you twenty grand on the table 
it s for a contract  
 five grand a head  right  
 i know i ll feel better
after i do this  
 i love you   mathilda  
wait for me  i won t be long 
look  i can t park in front
like this  it s a federal building 
and she s gonna do the same
exact thing like i said 
nine milli 
bullets and another nine milli 
what did you plan to do with
all these guns  huh 
maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building 
holy shit 
what ve we got here  lunch 
careful blood  might be poisoned 
no man 
there s no anchovies on this 
is that what you call
 i won t be long  
i ve been hangin  around here
for at least ten minutes 
i did my best  avanti 
do you like it 
yes 
so say it 
i like it 
not thirsty 
you know  a girl s first time is
very important 
it determines
the rest of her life sexually 
i read that once
in one of my sister s magazines 
my girlfriends told me that
they hated their first experience 
that s because
they don t love the guys 
they just did it to show off 
afterwards  they started liking it 
like cigarettes 
i wanna like it  the first time 
mathilda  no 
why not 
i just can t 
you love someone else 
no  i mean   
there was someone a long time ago 
before i came to the states 
her father didn t want her
to see me 
she was from
a very respectable family 
mine was  you know 
not so respectable 
her dad went nuts everytime
she d take off to see me 
but she still snuck off to see you 
right 
right 
you see 
nothing can stop love  leon 
he killed her 
one shot to the head 
they kept him in jail for two days 
then they let him go free 
they said it was an accident 
so 
one night i waited for him
500 feet with a lens 
he also had an accident 
the same night i took a boat
and came here to meet up with
my father who was working for tony 
i was nineteen 
since then i ve never left the city 
and   
i ve never had another girlfriend 
you see  mathilda 
i won t be a good lover 
ok 
just do me one favor 
what 
i m sick of watching you
sleeping on your chair 
we re gonna share the bed 
i don t think it s a good idea 
it s ok  put your legs upon the bed 
yeah  its nice 
put your head down  it s ok  relax 
good night  leon 
good night 
manolo  take the kids in the kitchen 
i have a lot of respect for
your business  tony 
when you ve killed for us
in the past 
we ve always been satisfied 
and that s exactly why today
is going to be very 
very hard for me 
i hope you ll excuse my mood 
my man was killed
right here on your turf
and the chinks tell me that
the hitman was kind of the   
italian type 
so we figured that tony might
know something  wait 
there s more 
you re gonna love this 
a few hours later 
a little twelve year old girl
comes into my office 
armed to the teeth
with the firm intention of
sending me straight to the morgue 
and you know who came and got
her in the middle of the afternoon 
right there  in my building 
the very same italian hitman 
i m dying to meet him 
relax  everything s fine 
sleep well 
i never really sleep 
got one eye open always 
oh  i forgot 
you know  i never saw someone
with one eye open snore so much

mathilda 
shit 
leon asked me to help you out if   
if something happened
and   
i think something happened  right 
he put aside a little cash
for you   
so  what i m suggesting is that   
seeing as how you re still so young 
i should hold the money for you 
you know   till you re oider 
like a bank  you know 
except better than a bank
because  you know 
banks always get knocked off 
no one knocks off old tony 
but it s your money and 
in the meantime 
all you gotta do is come here
every once in a while
and i ll dish it out
so that you can have a little fun  ok 
here s a hundred bucks to start with 
can t take any job instead 
a job 
what the hell can you do 
i can clean 
i ain t got no work
for a twelve year old kid 
so get it outta your goddamn head 
it s over  the game s over 
leon s dead  you hear me 
come on  come on 
you think i ain t hurting  too 
but he s dead  and you re gonna
forget all this craziness
and get your little ass
back to school  capiche 
now take this money
and get the hell outta here 
and don t let me see your face
 till next month 
 cause something tells me i m about
to lose my famous kind streak 
my parents died in a car accident
four weeks ago 
it was terrible 
you know  we didn t have the time
to get to know one another
when you first came here 
but i want you to know
that i am not the kind of woman
who d let down a child 
whatever her situation 
whatever her mistake 
so  i m going to help you and do
my best to welcome you here again 
but on one condition  you have to
stop lying to me  mathilda 
i want you to take a chance
and trust me 
now tell me what happened to you 
ok  my family got shot down
by dea officers
because of a drug problem 
i left with the greatest guy
on earth 
he was a hitman  the best in town 
but he died this morning
and if you don t help me 
i ll be dead by tonight 
you know her 
no 
i ve never seen her 
i think we ll be ok here  leon 
 he deals the cards as a meditation
and those he plays never suspect 
 he doesn t play for the money he wins
he doesn t play for respect 
 he deals the cards to find the answer
the sacred geometry of chance 
 the hidden law of a probable outcome
the numbers lead a dance 
 i know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier 
 i know that the clubs
are weapons of war 
 i know that diamonds
mean money for this art 
 but that s not
the shape of my heart 
 he may play the jack of diamonds
he may lay the queen of spades 
 he may conceal a king in his hand
while the memory of it fades 
 i know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier 
 i know that the clubs
are weapons of war 
 i know that diamonds
mean money for this art 
 that s not
the shape of my heart 
 that s not
the shape of my heart  
 and if i told you
that i loved you 
 you d maybe think
there s something wrong 
 i m not a man of too many faces
the mask i wear is one 
 those who speak know nothing
and find out to their cost 
 like those who curse their luck
in too many places 
 and those who fear are lost 
 i know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier 
 i know that the clubs
are weapons of war 
 i know that diamonds
mean money for this art 
 but that s not
