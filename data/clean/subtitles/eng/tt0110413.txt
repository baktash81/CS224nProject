you know a girls first time is
very important
it determines
the rest of her life sexually

they dont love the guys
they just did it to show off
afterwards they started liking it
like cigarettes
i wanna like it the first time
mathilda no
why not
i just cant
you love someone else
no i mean
there was someone a long time ago
before i came to the states
her father didnt want her
to see me
she was from
a very respectable family
mine was you know
not so respectable
her dad went nuts everytime
shed take off to see me
but she still snuck off to see you
right
right
you see
nothing can stop love leon
he killed her
one shot to the head
they kept him in jail for two days
then they let him go free
they said it was an accident
so
one night i waited for him
500 feet with a lens
he also had an accident
the same night i took a boat
and came here to meet up with
my father who was working for tony
i was nineteen
since then ive never left the city
and
ive never had another girlfriend
you see mathilda
i wont be a good lover
ok

leon asked me to help you out if
if something happened
and
i think something happened right
he put aside a little cash
for you
so what im suggesting is that
seeing as how youre still so young
i should hold the money for you
you know till youre oider
like a bank you know
except better than a bank
because you know
banks always get knocked off
no one knocks off old tony
but its your money and
in the meantime
all you gotta do is come here
every once in a while
and ill dish it out
so that you can have a little fun ok
heres a hundred bucks to start with
cant take any job instead
a job
what the hell can you do
i can clean
i aint got no work
for a twelve year old kid
so get it outta your goddamn head
its over the games over
leons dead you hear me
come on come on
you think i aint hurting too
but hes dead and youre gonna
forget all this craziness
and get your little ass
back to school capiche
now take this money
and get the hell outta here
and dont let me see your face
till next month
cause something tells me im about
to lose my famous kind streak
my parents died in a car accident
four weeks ago
it was terrible
you know we didnt have the time
to get to know one another
when you first came here
but i want you to know
that i am not the kind of woman
whod let down a child
whatever her situation
whatever her mistake
so im going to help you and do
my best to welcome you here again
but on one condition you have to
stop lying to me mathilda
i want you to take a chance
and trust me
now tell me what happened to you
ok my family got shot down
by dea officers
because of a drug problem
i left with the greatest guy
on earth
he was a hitman the best in town
but he died this morning
and if you dont help me
ill be dead by tonight
you know her
no
ive never seen her
i think well be ok here leon
he deals the cards as a meditation
and those he plays never suspect
he doesnt play for the money he wins
he doesnt play for respect
he deals the cards to find the answer
the sacred geometry of chance
the hidden law of a probable outcome
the numbers lead a dance
i know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs
are weapons of war
i know that diamonds
mean money for this art
but thats not
the shape of my heart
he may play the jack of diamonds
he may lay the queen of spades
he may conceal a king in his hand
while the memory of it fades
i know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs
are weapons of war
i know that diamonds
mean money for this art
thats not
the shape of my heart
thats not
the shape of my heart
and if i told you
that i loved you
youd maybe think
theres something wrong
im not a man of too many faces
the mask i wear is one
those who speak know nothing
and find out to their cost
like those who curse their luck
in too many places
and those who fear are lost
i know that the spades
are the swords of a soldier
i know that the clubs
are weapons of war
i know that diamonds
mean money for this art
but thats not
