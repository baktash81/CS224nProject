free as the wind was he
like a soaring kite was he
where did he go lets find him
we were led by the path we took
while he carved a path of his own
stumbling rising carefree walked he
we fretted about the morrow
he simply reveled in today
living each moment to the fullest
where did he come from
he who touched our
hearts and vanished
where did he go lets find him
in scorching sun
he was like a patch of shade
in an endless desert like an oasis
on a bruised heart
like soothing balm was he
afraid we stayed confined in the well
fearless he frolicked in the river
never hesitating to swim
against the tide
he wandered lonesome as a cloud
yet he was our dearest friend
where did he go lets find him
rancho
ranchhoddas shamaldas chanchad

salt water is a great conductor
of electricity 8th grade physics
we had studied it
he applied it
dr viru sahastrabuddhe
was the director of ice
students called him virus
computer virus
virus on the way with eggs
freshmen are summoned
come quickly
virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen
he couldnt bear anyone
getting ahead of him
to save time
his shirts had velcro
and his ties had hooks
hed trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously
everyday at 2 pm he took a
7 12 minute power nap
with an opera as lullaby
govind his valet had instructions
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving nailcutting etc
what is this
sir nest
whose
a koel birds nest sir
wrong
a koel bird never makes
her own nest
she lays her eggs in
other nests
and when they hatch
what do they do
they push the other eggs
out of the nest
competition over
their life begins with murder
thats nature
compete or die
you also are like the koel birds
and these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ice
dont forget ice gets
400000 applications a year
and only 200 are selected  you
and these finished
broken eggs
my son he tried for three years
rejected every time
remember life is a race
if you dont run fast
youll get trampled
let me tell you a
very interesting story
this is an astronaut pen
fountain pens and ballpoint pens
dont work in outer space
so scientists spent
millions to invent this pen
it can write at any angle in any
temperature in zero gravity
one day when i was a student
the director of our institute
called me
he said viru sahastrabuddhe
i said yes sir
come here
i got scared
he showed me this pen
he said this is a
symbol of excellence
i give it to you
when you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself
pass it onto him
for 32 years ive been
waiting for that student
but no luck
anyone here wholl strive
to win this pen
good
put your hands down
shall i post it on the notice board
hands down
one question sir
sir if pens didnt work
in outer space
why didnt the astronauts
use a pencil
theyd have saved millions
i will get back to you on this
he zaps a seniors privates
at night
fingers the director in the day
best avoid him
you deflated viruss erection
your majesty thou art great
accept this humble offering
buzz off
you dont have school
wholl pay for it your pop
keep off my dad
relax
for school you dont need
tuition money just a uniform
pick a school
buy the uniform slip into class
in that sea of kids
no one will notice
if i get caught
then new uniform new school
see that
he was different
he challenged conventions
at every stage
a freespirited bird had
landed in viruss nest
we were robots blindly following
our professors commands
he was the only one
who was not a machine
what is a machine
whyre you smiling
sir to study engineering
was a childhood dream
im so happy to be here finally
no need to be so happy
define a machine
a machine is anything that
reduces human effort
will you please elaborate
anything that simplifies work
or saves time is a machine
its a warm day press a button
get a blast of air
the fan a machine
speak to a friend miles away
the telephone a machine
compute millions in seconds
the calculator a machine
were surrounded by machines
from a pens nib to a pants zip
all machines
up and down in a second
up down up down
what is the definition
i just gave it to you sir
youll write this in the exam
this is a machine  up down
idiot anybody else
yes
sir machines are any combination
of bodies so connected
that their relative motions
are constrained
and by which means force
and motion may be transmitted
and modified as a screw
and its nut or a lever arranged
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot etc
especially a construction
more or less complex
consisting of a combination
of moving parts or
simple mechanical elements
as wheels levers cams etc
wonderful
perfect please sit down
thank you
but sir i said the same thing
in simple language
if you prefer simple language
join an arts and commerce college
but sir one must get
the meaning too
whats the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition
you think youre smarter
than the book
write the textbook definition mister
if you want to pass
but there are other books
get out
why
in simple language  out
idiot
so we were discussing
the machine
whyre you back
i forgot something
what
instruments that record
analyze summarize organize
debate and explain information
that are illustrated nonillustrated
hardbound paperback
jacketed non jacketed
with foreword introduction
tableofcontents index
that are intended for the
enlightenment understanding
enrichment enhancement and
education of the human brain
through the sensory route of
vision sometimes touch
what do you mean
books sir
i forgot my books may i
couldnt you ask simply
i tried earlier sir
it simply didnt work
professors kept rancho
mostly out seldom in
when thrown out of one class
hed slip into another
he said  first year or fourth year
its knowledge just grab it
he was unlike any of us
we fought for a shower
every morning
hed bathe wherever
he found water
morning sir
machines were his passion
when he spotted them
he opened them
some he could reassemble
some he couldnt
there was another just like him
joy lobo
sir excuse me sir
mr joy lobo

convocation dates

words of wisdom from
his holiness guru ranchhoddas

in our village
on night patrol hed call out
aal izz well
and we slept peacefully
then there was a theft
and we learned that
he couldnt see at night
hed just yell aal izz well
and we felt secure
that day i understood
this heart scares easily
you have to trick it
however big the problem
tell your heart all is well pal
that resolves the problem

were gonna really need it here
when life spins out of control
just let your lips roll

hey mrs chicken  all is well
hey mr lamb  all is well
hey bro  all is well
hey take it up to joys window
take it higher
look at silencer  the nude dude
joy come out
come to the window
joy look outside
good news sir
the police and joys father
have no clue
everyone thinks this is suicide
the post mortem report
cause of death intense
pressure on windpipe
resulting in choking
all think the pressure
on the jugular killed him
what about the mental pressure
for the last four years
thats missing in the report
engineers are a clever bunch
they havent made a machine
to measure mental pressure
if they had all would know
this isnt suicide its murder
how dare you blame me
for joys suicide
if one student cant handle
pressure is it our fault
life is full of pressures
will you always blame others
i dont blame you sir
i blame the system
look at these statistics
india ranks no1 in suicides
every 90 minutes
a student attempts suicide
suicide is a bigger killer
than disease
somethings terribly wrong sir
i cant speak for the rest
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country
ive run this place for 32 years
we were ranked 28th
now were no1
whats the point sir
here they dont discuss
new ideas or inventions
they discuss grades
jobs settling in the usa
they teach how to get good scores
they dont teach engineering
now you will teach me
how to teach
no sir i
sir my paper
vaidyanathan please sit down
here is a
selfproclaimed professor
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers
professor ranchhoddas chanchad
will teach us engineering
we do not have all day
you have 30 seconds
to define these terms
you may refer to your books
raise your hand
if you get the answer
lets see who comes first
who comes last
your time starts now
time up
time up sir
no one got the answer
now rewind your life by a minute
when i asked this question
were you excited curious
thrilled that youd learn
something new
anyone  sir
no you all got into a frantic race
whats the use of such methods
even if you come first
will your knowledge increase
no just the pressure
this is a college
not a pressure cooker
even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip
but you call such a lion
well trained not well educated
hello
this is not a philosophy class
just explain those two words
sir these words dont exist
these are my friends names
farhan and raju
quiet
nonsense is this how
youll teach engineering
sir i wasnt teaching
you engineering
youre an expert at that
i was teaching you how to teach
and im sure one day youll learn
because unlike you i never
abandon my weak students
bye sir
quiet
quiet i said
i regret to inform you
that your son
farhan
raju
has fallen into bad company
without urgent corrective steps
his future will be ruined
viruss letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs
hiroshima and nagasaki
plunged into gloom
our parents invited us
for a dressing down
come in
see that
we could afford
just one airconditioner
we put it in farhans room
so he could study in comfort
i didnt buy a car
i manage with a scooter
we put all our money
into farhans education
we sacrificed our comforts
for farhans future understand
you took these pictures farhan
he had that useless
obsession for a while
went around taking
pictures of animals
wanted to be a
wildlife photographer
son what was your
score that year
hear that straight drop
from 94 to 91
you find it funny
no sir sorry im just
amazed at the photos
why make him an engineer
why not a wildlife photographer
enough
i humbly request you
dont ruin my sons future
foods on the table boys cmon
if you ever visit again
do eat with us
dad denied us a meal
so to fill our bellies with food
and ears with more reprimands
we reached rajus house
rajus house was straight
out of a 50s black and white film
a small dingy room
a paralyzed father
a coughing mother
and an unwed sister
a sofa sprouting springs
a 24 hour water supply
from the leaking roof
mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer
father was once a postmaster
paralysis shut down
his body partly
his salary completely
and the sister
kammos turned 28
they demand a car in dowry
if you dont study and earn
how will she marry
some okra
okra is now 12 per kilo
cauliflower is 10
its daylight robbery
what will we eat if we get
warnings from your college
mom
cottage cheese
cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers in velvet pouches
cottage cheese
no no its ok
mom please
alright ill shut up
earn for the family
slave like a maid
and then take the vow of silence
if not with my son with whom
do i share my woes  his friends
hey raju
we were in a huge dilemma
do we comfort our friend
or console his mom
screw it we thought lets
focus on the cottage cheese
even his eczema cream
costs 55 now
another roti
no thank you were through
okra for 12
cauliflower for 10
at least you were offered a meal
unlike your sadistic dad
hitler qureshi
and your mom is mother teresa
feeding us eczema roti
dont poke fun at my mom
enough you guys
im famished lets eat out
its month end wholl pay
his mother teresa
to eat out you dont need money
just a uniform look
cmon

no sir were here as the
emissaries of science
how can you explain
dad he explains superbly
im sure hell give us a demo

well delhi has plenty of
power cuts that
disrupt wedding celebrations
so i thought of making
an inverter that
draws power from guests cars
i see
wow
so wheres the inverter
sir the design is ready
wheres the design farhan
i gave you the design
i gave it to raju
raju design
never mind the design
ill make the inverter and show you
you can only invent stories
not an inverter
ill make one i promise
and ill name it after you
after all it was invented
at your daughters wedding
so itll be an honor
farhan raju ill see you
in my office tomorrow
sir what was the cost per plate
well reimburse you
in installments
well never crash a wedding again
not even my own
in fact i wont even marry
nor will he
uh right no marriage
your parents shouldnt have
married either
the world would have
to feed two less idiots
sit
pay attention
this is ranchhoddass fathers
monthly income
couple of zeroes less
and its still a sizeable income
but erase another zero
and i would worry a little
isnt that your fathers income
farhan
yes sir
now take away another zero
and thats your family income
raju rastogi
big reason to worry
take my advice and shift into
chatur ramalingams room
exams are here stay with
rancho and youre sure to fail
want a shave
no sir
then get lost
raju dont worry this is viruss
move to split us divide and rule
i have to worry
he grades us and i need
good grades for a good job
unlike you i dont have a
rich dad i can live off
shut up raju
must we follow all his hogwash
aal izz well
i wont be his flunky like you
youre crossing the line
no im drawing one
i have a family to support
dads medicines
swallow up moms pension
my sis cant marry because
they want a car in dowry
mom hasnt bought a
single saree in five years
now dont get your moms
wardrobe into the debate
by the way how many sarees
per annum is reasonable
hey no wisecracks about mom
well study with all our heart
but not just for grades
to quote a wise one  study
to be accomplished not affluent
follow excellence and success
will chase you pants down
which wise one says this
his holiness guru ranchhoddas
go rot in the bogs
raju dont stress well top
our class nothing is impossible
oh yeah
shove this back into the tube
raju got onto another train
his travails with chatur began
yes i mean travails not travels
chatur was called silencer
to sharpen his memory
he popped pills from a local quack
and then let off silent
but lethal farts
i didnt do it raju
he always blamed others
for the output
silencer crammed 18 hours a day
on exam eve
he would distract others
his belief  there are only
two ways of topping
elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents grades
rancho decided to subdue
silencer and rescue raju
with one master plan
our director has unceasingly
served served means
damn the meaning
ill memorize it
chatur was the introductory speaker
at the teachers day function
to impress virus he got his
speech written by the librarian
in highbrow hindi
hello hold on
chatur call for you
please collect the printout
ill be right back
oh the things i have to do
mr dubey the director was
remembering you
really
yes just now
ill see him right away
give this to chatur
hello hello
hello mr ramalingam
yes
im calling from the police station
are you from uganda
yes sir
your life is in danger
what  how
listen carefully or else
youll get killed as you step out
of the college gate
why what happened
while chatur was kept engaged
rancho altered a few words
in his speech for eg
served became screwed
yes sir
who are you
dubey librarian
im permanent staff sir
congratulations
hold on a moment
the chief is on the other line
excuse me sir
yes so where was i
you said i may die
outside the gate
right as you get out of the gate
youll see a traffic signal
traffic signal ok
when it turns red
all the cars will halt
ok then
then cross the road
with great caution
because son in rush hour
if a car hits you youre dead
what nonsense i know that
you know that excellent
then youre safe my boy
from the librarian silencer
you dont call me that
chanchad
hey the director said
he didnt call for me
who said called
i just said he remembered you
remembered
rascals
distinguished mr chairperson
chief guest the honorable
minister of education
respected teachers and friends
ice has now soared
beyond the stratosphere
the credit goes solely to
dr viru sahastrabuddhe
give him a big hand
sir the voice is his
but the words are mine
hes a great guy really you are
for 32 years he has
unceasingly screwed students
he means  served students
im sure his endeavors
will continue
we are astounded at
how one man in one lifetime
can screw so many so well
with rigorous training
hes built up his stamina
hes spent every living minute
just screwing
lets replicate his methods
tomorrow ice students
will go across the globe
wherever we go
we promise to screw
well hoist this screwers flag
all over the world
well show the world that
our capacity to screw
cannot be matched by any student
anywhere on the planet
mr minister good evening
you have given this institution
what it sorely needs
booty funds
bosom
its booty stupid bosom means
what nonsense thats insulting
everyone has a bosom
but it remains pocketed
no one offers it so readily
vulgar fellow
you have generously offered
your bosom
to this relentless screwer
now see how he makes it grow
is this what you teach here director
on this august occasion
heres a sanskrit verse
listen to this  the might
of his fart in verse
a good loud fart is honorable
fart go silencer
a medium fart is tolerable
softer windbreaks are terrible
and the silent ones unbearable
thats what mindless cramming
does to you
cramming may see you
through four years of college
but it will screw you
for the next 40 years
he still doesnt get it
medium fart is tolerable
unbelievable
youre a poet rancho
how did you think of this
that was fun
he didnt know what hit him
you swines
what did i ever do to you
sorry man
dont take it personally
i will
chatur ramalingam
will never forget this insult
ill think of it every minute
every second of my life
sorry man that was a demo
for raju  dont cram blindly
understand and enjoy
the wonders of science
im not here to enjoy science
so youre here to screw science
go ahead
laugh at my methods
but one day these methods
will bring me success
that day ill laugh and youll cry
youre on the wrong track again
dont chase success
become a good engineer
and success will chase you
these ideals dont work

it was going well till
one day
our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math

papa was a powerful man so
our teacher alerted him

drunk i urinated
on the directors door
that scoundrel rancho
is messing with your mind
i dont enjoy engineering
id make a terrible engineer
rancho has a simple belief
make your passion your profession
then work will become play
whatll you earn in that jungle
a small stipend but ill learn a lot
five years from now
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes youll curse yourself
life as an engineer will bring
only frustration then ill curse you
id rather curse myself dad
the world will laugh
label you a loser
for quitting in the final year
mr kapoor feels youre fortunate
to be at ice whatll he think
mr kapoor didnt provide me
with an airconditioner
it wasnt mr kapoor who slept
in discomfort while i slept well
he didnt take me around the zoo
on his shoulders
you did all that dad
how you feel matters to me
mr kapoor makes no difference
i dont even know his first name
you think youre the hero
of a melodrama
enough please hes upset
god forbid if he did
something crazy like raju
then the discussion is over
dont say a word or
his lordship will jump off the roof
no dad ill never attempt suicide
i promise
the rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet
told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind
and imagine whatd happen
to your smiles
when you see my dead body
i want to convince you dad
but not with a suicide threat
dad whatll happen
if i become a photographer
ill earn less
ill have a smaller house
a smaller car
but ill be happy
i will be really happy
whatever i do for you
will be out of genuine love
ive always listened to you
for once
let me listen to my heart
please dad
dad
please dont go away
return this
son whats the cost
of a professional camera

if you need more money just ask
go live your life my son
your grades are consistently poor
reason
fear
i was a good student
since childhood
parents hoped
id end their poverty
that scared me
here i saw the mad race
you dont count if youre not first
my fear grew
fear is not good for grades sir
i slipped on more
charms and rings
prayed to god for favors
no begged for favors
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect
finally sense dawned
today i didnt beg god for this job
just thanked him for this life
if you reject me no regrets
ill still do something
worthwhile with my life
such frank behavior
is not good for our firm
we need someone diplomatic
to handle clients
youre too straightforward
but
if you assure us
youll control this attitude
we may consider you
it took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet
wasnt easy to get this attitude
cant change it sir
you keep your job
ill keep my attitude
im sorry no offense sir

candidates for 25 years
