free as the wind was he
like a soaring kite was he
where did he go    let s find him
we were led by the path we took
while he carved a path of his own
stumbling  rising  carefree walked he
we fretted about the morrow
he simply reveled in today
living each moment to the fullest
where did he come from   
he who touched our
hearts and vanished   
where did he go    let s find him
in scorching sun 
he was like a patch of shade   
in an endless desert  like an oasis   
on a bruised heart 
like soothing balm was he
afraid  we stayed confined in the well
fearless  he frolicked in the river
never hesitating to swim
against the tide
he wandered lonesome as a cloud
    yet he was our dearest friend
where did he go    let s find him
rancho
ranchhoddas shamaldas chanchad

salt water is a great conductor
of electricity  8th grade physics
we had studied it 
he applied it
dr  viru sahastrabuddhe
was the director of ice
students called him virus 
computer virus
virus on the way  with eggs
freshmen are summoned 
come quickly
virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen
he couldn t bear anyone
getting ahead of him
to save time 
his shirts had velcro
and his ties had hooks
he d trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously
everyday at 2 pm he took a
7 1 2 minute power nap
with an opera as lullaby
govind  his valet  had instructions
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving  nail cutting etc
what is this 
  sir  nest
whose 
  a koel bird s nest  sir
wrong
a koel bird never makes
her own nest
she lays her eggs in
other nests
and when they hatch 
what do they do 
they push the other eggs
out of the nest
competition over
their life begins with murder 
that s nature
compete or die
you also are like the koel birds
and these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ice
don t forget  ice gets
400 000 applications a year
and only 200 are selected   you 
and these  finished 
broken eggs
my son    he tried for three years
rejected  every time
remember  life is a race
if you don t run fast 
you ll get trampled
let me tell you a
very interesting story
this is an astronaut pen
fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don t work in outer space
so scientists spent
millions to invent this pen
it can write at any angle  in any
temperature  in zero gravity
one day  when i was a student
the director of our institute
called me
he said   viru sahastrabuddhe  
i said   yes sir 
 come here  
i got scared
he showed me this pen
he said   this is a
symbol of excellence 
 i give it to you 
 when you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself
   pass it onto him 
for 32 years  i ve been
waiting for that student
but no luck
anyone here  who ll strive
to win this pen 
good 
put your hands down
shall i post it on the notice board 
hands down
one question  sir
sir  if pens didn t work
in outer space
why didn t the astronauts
use a pencil 
they d have saved millions
i will get back to you on this
he zaps a senior s privates
at night
fingers the director in the day 
best avoid him
you deflated virus s erection
your majesty  thou art great 
accept this humble offering
buzz off 
you don t have school 
who ll pay for it  your pop 
keep off my dad 
  relax
for school you don t need
tuition money  just a uniform
pick a school 
buy the uniform  slip into class
in that sea of kids 
no one will notice
if i get caught 
  then new uniform  new school
see that 
  he was different   
he challenged conventions
at every stage
a free spirited bird had
landed in virus s nest
we were robots  blindly following
our professors  commands
he was the only one
who was not a machine
what is a machine 
why re you smiling 
sir  to study engineering
was a childhood dream
i m so happy to be here finally
no need to be so happy 
define a machine
a machine is anything that
reduces human effort
will you please elaborate 
anything that simplifies work 
or saves time  is a machine
it s a warm day  press a button 
get a blast of air
the fan    a machine 
speak to a friend miles away 
the telephone    a machine 
compute millions in seconds 
the calculator    a machine 
we re surrounded by machines
from a pen s nib to a pants  zip  
all machines
up and down in a second 
up  down  up  down   
what is the definition 
i just gave it to you  sir
you ll write this in the exam 
this is a machine   up  down   
idiot  anybody else 
yes 
sir  machines are any combination
of bodies so connected
that their relative motions
are constrained
and by which means  force
and motion may be transmitted
and modified as a screw
and its nut  or a lever arranged
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot  etc
especially  a construction 
more or less complex
consisting of a combination
of moving parts  or
simple mechanical elements 
as wheels  levers  cams etc
wonderful
perfect  please sit down
thank you
but sir  i said the same thing 
in simple language
if you prefer simple language 
join an arts and commerce college
but sir  one must get
the meaning too
what s the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition
you think you re smarter
than the book 
write the textbook definition  mister 
if you want to pass
but there are other books   
  get out 
why 
in simple language   out 
idiot 
so  we were discussing
the machine   
why re you back 
i forgot something
what 
instruments that record 
analyze  summarize  organize
debate and explain information 
that are illustrated  non illustrated
hard bound  paperback 
jacketed  non jacketed
with foreword  introduction 
table of contents  index
that are intended for the
enlightenment  understanding
enrichment  enhancement and
education of the human brain
through the sensory route of
vision  sometimes touch
what do you mean 
books  sir
i forgot my books  may i 
couldn t you ask simply 
i tried earlier  sir 
it simply didn t work
professors kept rancho
mostly out    seldom in
when thrown out of one class 
he d slip into another
he said   first year or fourth year 
it s knowledge  just grab it
he was unlike any of us
we fought for a shower
every morning
he d bathe wherever
he found water
morning  sir
machines were his passion
when he spotted them 
he opened them
some he could re assemble   
some he couldn t
there was another  just like him
joy lobo
sir  excuse me  sir
mr  joy lobo 
sir  if i could know the
convocation dates   
why 
dad wants to make
train reservations

village  everyone wants to attend
in that case  call your dad
please hurry up 
don t waste my time
hello
dad  the director wants to
speak to you
joy 
mr  lobo  your son won t
graduate this year

dude s come up with an
amazing design
a wireless camera atop a helicopter
can be used for
traffic updates  security    wow 
but virus said it s an
impractical design  it won t fly
it will fly  we ll make it fly
don t tell joy  it ll be a surprise
we ll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction
if we work on his project 
who ll work on ours 
tests  vivas  quizzes  
42 exams per semester
you scare easily  bro
take your hand  put it over your
heart  and say   aal izz well 
all is well 
  aal izz well
words of wisdom from
his holiness guru ranchhoddas
we had an old watchman
in our village
on night patrol  he d call out 
 aal izz well 
and we slept peacefully 
then there was a theft
and we learned that
he couldn t see at night 
he d just yell  aal izz well  
and we felt secure
that day i understood
this heart scares easily
you have to trick it
however big the problem 
tell your heart   all is well  pal 
that resolves the problem 
no  but you gain courage to face it
learn it up  bro 
we re gonna really need it here
when life spins out of control
just let your lips roll
let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
when life spins out of control
just let your lips roll
just let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
yell   all is well   
the chicken s clueless
about the egg s fate
will it hatch or
become an omelette
no one knows
what the future holds
so let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
whistle away the toll
yell   all is well
hey bro   all is well
hey mate   all is well
hey bro   all is well
confusion and more confusion
no sign of any solution
ah    finally a solution
but wait    what was the question 
if the timid heart with fear
is about to die
then con it bro 
with this simple lie
heart s an idiot 
it will fall under that spell
let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
whistle away the toll
yell   all is well
hey bro   all is well
hey mate   all is well
hey bro   all is well
blew the scholarship on booze
but that did not dispel my blues
holy incense lit up my plight
and yet god s nowhere in sight
the lamb is clueless for
what it s destined
will it be served on skewers
or simply minced
no one knows
what the future holds
so let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
whistle away the toll
yell   all is well
hey bro   all is well
hey mate   all is well
hey bro   all is well
when life spins out of control
just let your lips roll
just let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
all is well
the chicken s clueless
about the egg s fate
will it hatch or
become an omelette
no one knows
what the future holds
so let your lips roll
and whistle away the toll
whistle away the toll
eureka  eureka 
yell   all is well
hey mrs  chicken   all is well
hey mr  lamb   all is well
hey bro   all is well
hey  take it up to joy s window
take it higher
look at silencer   the nude dude 
joy  come out
come to the window
joy  look outside
good news  sir
the police and joy s father
have no clue
everyone thinks this is suicide
the post mortem report  
cause of death  intense
pressure on windpipe
resulting in choking
all think the pressure
on the jugular killed him
what about the mental pressure
for the last four years 
that s missing in the report
engineers are a clever bunch
they haven t made a machine
to measure mental pressure
if they had  all would know   
this isn t suicide    it s murder
how dare you blame me
for joy s suicide 
if one student can t handle
pressure  is it our fault 
life is full of pressures 
will you always blame others 
i don t blame you  sir 
i blame the system
look at these statistics  
india ranks no 1 in suicides
every 90 minutes 
a student attempts suicide
suicide is a bigger killer
than disease
something s terribly wrong  sir
i can t speak for the rest
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country
i ve run this place for 32 years
we were ranked 28th 
now we re no 1
what s the point  sir 
here they don t discuss
new ideas or inventions
they discuss grades 
jobs  settling in the usa
they teach how to get good scores 
they don t teach engineering
now you will teach me
how to teach 
no sir  i   
sir  my paper   
vaidyanathan  please sit down
here is a
self proclaimed professor
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers
professor ranchhoddas chanchad
will teach us engineering
we do not have all day
you have 30 seconds
to define these terms
you may refer to your books
raise your hand
if you get the answer
let s see who comes first 
who comes last
your time starts    now
time up
time up  sir
no one got the answer 
now rewind your life by a minute
when i asked this question 
were you excited  curious 
thrilled that you d learn
something new 
anyone      sir 
no  you all got into a frantic race
what s the use of such methods 
even if you come first
will your knowledge increase 
no  just the pressure
this is a college 
not a pressure cooker
even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip
but you call such a lion
 well trained   not  well educated 
hello 
this is not a philosophy class 
just explain those two words
sir  these words don t exist
these are my friends  names 
farhan and raju
quiet 
nonsense  is this how
you ll teach engineering 
sir  i wasn t teaching
you engineering
you re an expert at that
i was teaching you    how to teach
and i m sure one day you ll learn
because unlike you  i never
abandon my weak students
bye  sir
quiet 
quiet  i said
i regret to inform you
that your son   
farhan   
raju   
has fallen into bad company
without urgent corrective steps 
his future will be ruined
virus s letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs
hiroshima and nagasaki
plunged into gloom
our parents invited us  
for a dressing down
come in
see that 
we could afford
just one air conditioner
we put it in farhan s room 
so he could study in comfort
i didn t buy a car 
i manage with a scooter
we put all our money
into farhan s education
we sacrificed our comforts
for farhan s future  understand 
you took these pictures  farhan 
he had that useless
obsession for a while
went around taking
pictures of animals
wanted to be a
wildlife photographer
son  what was your
score that year 
91 
hear that  straight drop
from 94  to 91 
you find it funny 
no sir  sorry  i m just
amazed at the photos
why make him an engineer   
why not a wildlife photographer 
enough 
i humbly request you  
don t ruin my son s future
food s on the table  boys  c mon
if you ever visit again 
do eat with us
dad denied us a meal   
so  to fill our bellies with food   
and ears with more reprimands 
we reached raju s house
raju s house was straight
out of a 50 s black and white film
a small  dingy room   
a paralyzed father   
a coughing mother   
and an unwed sister
a sofa sprouting springs   
a 24 hour water supply  
from the leaking roof
mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer
father was once a postmaster
paralysis shut down
his body partly   
his salary completely 
and the sister   
kammo s turned 28 
they demand a car in dowry
if you don t study and earn 
how will she marry 
some okra 
okra is now 12   per kilo 
cauliflower is 10  
it s daylight robbery 
what will we eat if we get
warnings from your college 
mom 
cottage cheese 
cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers  in velvet pouches
cottage cheese 
  no  no  it s ok
mom  please
alright  i ll shut up
earn for the family 
slave like a maid
and then take the vow of silence
if not with my son  with whom
do i share my woes   his friends 
hey raju
we were in a huge dilemma
do we comfort our friend
or console his mom 
screw it  we thought  let s
focus on the cottage cheese
even his eczema cream
costs 55   now
another roti 
no  thank you  we re through
okra for 12  
  cauliflower for 10  
at least you were offered a meal
unlike your sadistic dad   
 hitler  qureshi 
and your mom is mother teresa   
feeding us  eczema roti  
don t poke fun at my mom 
  enough  you guys
i m famished  let s eat out
it s month end  who ll pay 
his mother teresa 
to eat out  you don t need money 
just a uniform  look   
c mon
  come
good evening 
good evening
oh  uncle
three large vodkas 
  half soda  half water
if we re caught  we re dead

he s a price tag
he ll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices
he ll ruin your life 
your future will be finished

the price of his shoes 
i won t ask 
he ll announce it himself
what the hell   
mint sauce on my  300 shoes

it s free advice  take it or leave it
genuine italian leather  
hand stitched 
dad  are they your guests 
my students 
what re they doing here 
hold on  dad
these beans smell great
no room for roti
  just pile it on
hi
  hey
that was an eye opener 
thank you so much
it was my moral responsibility
can i ask you for little more help 
dad won t let me break off
this engagement
you explain so well 
can you give him a demo too 
certainly 
raju  the mint sauce
you re really sweet
where is your daddy 
  right behind you
aal izz well
run for your life 
it s free advice  take it or leave it
what re you doing here 
we ll hand these gifts
to the couple
i ll do that for you 
it s my sister s wedding
sister 
sir  what s the sum total
of your daughters 
empty  no gift cheques
forgot the cheques  raju
    farhan 
we didn t invite you 
you must be from the groom s side
no sir  we re here as the
emissaries of science
how  can you explain 
dad  he explains superbly 
i m sure he ll give us a demo
won t you 
well  delhi has plenty of
power cuts that   
disrupt wedding celebrations
so i thought of making
an inverter that   
draws power from guests  cars
i see
wow
so where s the inverter 
sir  the design is ready
where s the design  farhan 
i gave you the design
  i gave it to raju
raju  design 
never mind the design 
i ll make the inverter and show you
you can only invent stories 
not an inverter
i ll make one  i promise
and i ll name it after you 
after all  it was invented   
at your daughter s wedding 
so it ll be an honor   
farhan  raju  i ll see you
in my office tomorrow
sir  what was the cost per plate 
we ll reimburse you
    in installments
we ll never crash a wedding again
  not even my own
in fact  i won t even marry 
nor will he
uh    right  no marriage
your parents shouldn t have
married either
the world would have
to feed two less idiots
sit 
pay attention
this is ranchhoddas s father s
monthly income
couple of zeroes less 
and it s still a sizeable income
but erase another zero 
and i would worry a little
isn t that your fathers income 
farhan 
yes  sir
now take away another zero   
and that s your family income 
raju rastogi
big reason to worry
take my advice and shift into
chatur ramalingam s room
exams are here  stay with
rancho and you re sure to fail
want a shave 
  no  sir
then get lost 
raju  don t worry  this is virus s
move to split us  divide and rule
i have to worry
he grades us  and i need
good grades for a good job
unlike you  i don t have a
rich dad i can live off
shut up  raju
must we follow all his hogwash 
 aal izz well 
i won t be his flunky    like you
you re crossing the line
  no  i m drawing one
i have a family to support
dad s medicines
swallow up mom s pension
my sis can t marry because
they want a car in dowry
mom hasn t bought a
single saree in five years
now don t get your mom s
wardrobe into the debate
by the way  how many sarees
per annum is reasonable 
hey    no wisecracks about mom
we ll study with all our heart 
but not just for grades
to quote a wise one   study
to be accomplished  not affluent
follow excellence  and success
will chase you  pants down 
which wise one says this 
his holiness guru ranchhoddas 
go rot in the bogs 
raju  don t stress  we ll top
our class  nothing is impossible
oh yeah 
shove this back into the tube
raju got onto another train
his travails with chatur began 
yes  i mean travails  not travels
chatur was called  silencer 
to sharpen his memory 
he popped pills from a local quack
and then let off silent   
but lethal farts
i didn t do it    raju 
he always blamed others
for the output
silencer crammed 18 hours a day
on exam eve 
he would distract others
his belief   there are only
two ways of topping
elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents  grades
rancho decided to subdue
silencer and rescue raju   
with one master plan
our director has unceasingly
served     served  means   
damn the meaning

speech written by the librarian   
in highbrow hindi

who said  called  
i just said he  remembered  you
remembered 
rascals 
distinguished mr  chairperson
chief guest  the honorable
minister of education
respected teachers and friends
ice has now soared
beyond the stratosphere
the credit goes solely to
dr  viru sahastrabuddhe 
give him a big hand
sir  the voice is his
but the words are mine
he s a great guy  really you are
for 32 years  he has
unceasingly screwed students
he means    served  students
i m sure his endeavors
will continue
we are astounded at
how one man  in one lifetime
can screw so many  so well
with rigorous training
he s built up his stamina
he s spent every living minute
just screwing
let s replicate his methods
tomorrow ice students
will go across the globe
wherever we go 
we promise to screw
we ll hoist this screwer s flag
all over the world
we ll show the world that
our capacity to screw   
cannot be matched by any student   
anywhere on the planet
mr  minister  good evening
you have given this institution
what it sorely needs
booty  funds
  bosom
it s booty  stupid  bosom means   
what nonsense  that s insulting
everyone has a bosom 
but it remains pocketed
no one offers it so readily
vulgar fellow 
you have generously offered
your bosom   
to this relentless screwer
now see how he makes it grow
is this what you teach here  director 
on this august occasion 
here s a sanskrit verse   
listen to this   the might
of his fart in verse
a good loud fart is honorable
 fart   go  silencer
a medium fart is tolerable
softer windbreaks are terrible
and the silent ones unbearable
that s what mindless cramming
does to you
cramming may see you
through four years of college
but it will  screw  you
for the next 40 years
he still doesn t get it
 medium fart is tolerable    
unbelievable 
you re a poet  rancho 
how did you think of this 
that was fun 
he didn t know what hit him
you swines 
what did i ever do to you 
sorry man 
don t take it personally
i will
chatur ramalingam
will never forget this insult
i ll think of it every minute 
every second of my life
sorry man  that was a demo
for raju   don t cram blindly
understand and enjoy
the wonders of science
i m not here to enjoy science
so you re here to screw science
go ahead 
laugh at my methods
but one day these methods
will bring me success
that day i ll laugh and you ll cry
you re on the wrong track again 
don t chase success
become a good engineer
and success will chase you
these ideals don t work
in the real world
you take your train  i ll take mine
ten years from now
we ll meet at the same station
same day  same place 
we ll see who s more successful
you    or i

why publicise someone s flaws 
if your iron count is low 
will the doctor prescribe tonic   
or air your report on tv

what you are saying is
i should personally go to
each student s room
and whisper in his ears   
 you have come first  
 you re second  
 oh  i m so sorry 
you have failed 
no sir  i mean
grades create a divide
i ve topped  so i m next to you

prefers humans to machines
they ll get jobs  i guarantee
you guarantee it

chhote 
he was our gardener s son  chhote
he stayed on with us
after he was orphaned
did odd jobs around the house 
ran errands
he had a passion for learning
he d wear my old uniform
and slip into school
and attend any class he liked 
it suited me
i made him do my homework 
take my exams
it was going well  till
one day   
our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math
which grade are you in  son 
what s your name 
we got caught
papa was a powerful man  so   
our teacher alerted him
before going to the principal
you started it  you will finish it
people pretend to show me respect
but behind my back   
mock me as an illiterate
i won t let that happen to my son
this boy wants to study 
i want just a degree
let the game go on
make this kid an engineer
and i ll have a degree
in my son s name on that wall
i went to london for four years 
he went to college as me
he d promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree
but he always said 
 two idiots will come looking for me 
he really misses you both
i ll give you his address 
go to him
but please keep my secret
what secret

most of us went to college
just for a degree
no degree meant
no plum job  no pretty wife   
no credit card  no social status
none of this mattered to him
he was in college
for the joy of learning
he never cared
if he was first or last
who was the first man

neil armstrong  sir
obviously  it is neil armstrong 
we all know it
who was the second

consistent students
consistently last in every exam
come my geniuses  come
their brains will fetch
a handsome price
 cause they re completely unused
and to answer their question  
the exam won t affect their jobs
because no company
will hire them anyway 
they re so unique  their
names will be writ in gold  
 farhanitrate  and  prerajulization 
give them a big hand

  it s waiting
thank you  why 
i m going to the job interview
you coming with me 
no  i m going for the interview 
you re going home
why would i go home 
remember  we promised
this rascal
give me your tie
why 
i doubt you ll go for the
interview after reading this
what s that 
a letter
  for you  from hungary
some photographer
called andre istvan
you posted my letter 
he loved your pictures
the guy wants you to assist him   
in the brazilian rain forest 
for a year
will pay you  too
dad will never agree
go speak to him   
from your heart
for once  dump your fears   
or someday  on your deathbed 
you ll regret it
you ll remember that the letter was
in your hand  taxi at the gate   
with just a little courage  you
could ve turned your life around
do you think he ll like it 
why such an expensive gift 
our son s getting
his first job today
don t be stingy at
such a proud moment
farhan 
don t you have
the job interview today 
i didn t go
i don t want to be
an engineer  dad
what happened 
you had an accident 
see that building 
i jumped from its third floor
why 
because i was rusticated
from college
why 
drunk  i urinated
on the director s door
that scoundrel rancho
is messing with your mind 
i don t enjoy engineering 
i d make a terrible engineer
rancho has a simple belief  
make your passion your profession
then work will become play
what ll you earn in that jungle 
a small stipend  but i ll learn a lot
five years from now   
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes  you ll curse yourself
life as an engineer will bring
only frustration  then i ll curse you
i d rather curse myself  dad
the world will laugh 
label you a loser 
for quitting in the final year
mr  kapoor feels you re fortunate
to be at ice  what ll he think 
mr  kapoor didn t provide me
with an air conditioner
it wasn t mr  kapoor who slept
in discomfort while i slept well
he didn t take me around the zoo
on his shoulders
you did all that  dad
how you feel  matters to me 
mr  kapoor makes no difference
i don t even know his first name
you think you re the hero
of a melodrama 
enough  please    he s upset
god forbid  if he did
something crazy like raju   
then the discussion is over
don t say a word or
his lordship will jump off the roof
no  dad  i ll never attempt suicide 
i promise
the rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet
told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind
and imagine what d happen
to your smiles
when you see my dead body
i want to convince you  dad
but not with a suicide threat
dad  what ll happen
if i become a photographer 
i ll earn less
i ll have a smaller house 
a smaller car
but i ll be happy
i will be really happy
whatever i do for you
will be out of genuine love
i ve always listened to you
for once 
let me listen to my heart
please    dad
dad   
please don t go away   
return this
son  what s the cost
of a professional camera 
can the laptop be exchanged for it 
if you need more money  just ask
go live your life  my son
your grades are consistently poor 
reason 
fear
i was a good student
since childhood
parents hoped
i d end their poverty
that scared me
here i saw the mad race 
you don t count if you re not first
my fear grew
fear is not good for grades  sir
i slipped on more
charms and rings
prayed to god for favors 
no    begged for favors
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect
finally  sense dawned
today i didn t beg god for this job 
just thanked him for this life
if you reject me  no regrets
i ll still do something
worthwhile with my life
such frank behavior
is not good for our firm
we need someone diplomatic
to handle clients
you re too straightforward
but   
if you assure us
you ll control this attitude
we may consider you
it took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet
wasn t easy to get this attitude
can t change it  sir
you keep your job   
i ll keep my attitude
i m sorry  no offense  sir
wait
i ve interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years
everyone turns into
a yes man to get the job
where did you spring from  son 
sir 
shall we discuss the salary 
thank you  sir
your majesty  thou art great
accept this humble offering
govind

my moustache
