three cars are tied
for the season points lead
heading into the final race
of the season
and the winner of this race will win
the season title and the piston cup
does the king strip weathers
have one more victory in him
before retirement
hes been dinocos golden boy
for years
can he win them one last piston cup
and as always in the
second place spot we find chick hicks
hes been chasing
that tailfin his entire career
chick thought
this was his year
his chance to finally emerge
from the kings shadow
but the last thing he expected was
lightning mcqueen
you know i dont think
anybody expected this
the rookie sensation
came into the season unknown
but everyone knows him now
will he be the first rookie
to win a piston cup and land dinoco
the legend the runnerup
and the rookie
three cars one champion
no you dont
hey
what a ride
go get em mcqueen
go get em
i love you lightning
dinoco is all mine

huge crash behind the leaders

lets go get me back out there
mcqueens not going into the pits
the rookie fired his
crew chief the third this season
says he likes working alone

hes got a lot of ground to make up
get ready boys
were coming to the restart
come on come on come on
we need tires now
come on lets go
no no no no no tires just gas
what
you need tires you idiot
looks like its
gasandgos for mcqueen today

thats a shortterm gain
longterm loss
but its workin for him he obviously
knows somethin we dont know
this is it darrell one lap to go
and lightning mcqueen has a huge lead
hes got it in the bag
call in the dogs and put out the fire
were gonna crown us a new champion
