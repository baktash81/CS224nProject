welcome back to the dinoco 400 
i m bob cutlass  here
with my good friend  darrell cartrip 
we re midway through what may
be an historic day for racing 
bob  my oil pressure s
through the roof 
if this gets more exciting  they re
gonna have to tow me outta the booth 
right  darrell 
three cars are tied
for the season points lead 
heading into the final race
of the season 
and the winner of this race will win
the season title and the piston cup 
does the king  strip weathers 
have one more victory in him
before retirement 
he s been dinoco s golden boy
for years 
can he win them one last piston cup 
and  as always  in the
second place spot we find chick hicks 
he s been chasing
that tailfin his entire career 
chick thought
this was his year 
his chance to finally emerge
from the king s shadow 
but the last thing he expected was   
lightning mcqueen 
you know  i don t think
anybody expected this 
the rookie sensation
came into the season unknown 
but everyone knows him now 
will he be the first rookie
to win a piston cup and land dinoco 
the legend  the runner up 
and the rookie 
three cars  one champion 
no you don t 
hey 
what a ride 
go get  em  mcqueen 
go get  em 
i love you  lightning 
dinoco is all mine 
trouble  turn three 
  get through that  mcqueen 
  huge crash behind the leaders 
wait a second  darrell 
mcqueen is in the wreckage 
there s no way the rookie
can make it through 
not in one piece  that is 
yeah 
lightning  oh 
look at that 
mcqueen made it through 
a spectacular move
by lightning mcqueen 
yeah  ka chow 
mcqueen  mcqueen  mcqueen 
mcqueen  mcqueen  mcqueen 
yeah  mcqueen  ka chow 
while everyone
heads into the pits 
mcqueen stays out to take the lead 
don t take me out  coach 
i can still race 
what do you think 
a thing of beauty 
  mcqueen made it 
  what 
he s not pitting 
you gotta get me out there 
let s go  get me back out there 
mcqueen s not going into the pits 
the rookie fired his
crew chief  the third this season 
  says he likes working alone 
  go  go 
looks like chick
got caught up in the pits 
yeah  after a stop like that 
he s got a lot of ground to make up 
get ready  boys 
we re coming to the restart 
come on  come on  come on 
we need tires now 
come on  let s go 
  no  no  no  no  no tires  just gas 
  what 
you need tires  you idiot 
looks like it s
gas and go s for mcqueen today 
right  no tires again 
that s a short term gain 
long term loss 
but it s workin  for him  he obviously
knows somethin  we don t know 
this is it  darrell  one lap to go
and lightning mcqueen has a huge lead 
he s got it in the bag 
call in the dogs and put out the fire 
we re gonna crown us a new champion 
checkered flag  here i come 
no  mcqueen s blown a tire 
and with only one turn to go 
can he make it 
you fool 
mcqueen s blown a tire 
he s blown a tire 
go  go  go 
he s lost another tire 
  king and chick come up fast 
  they re entering turn three 
come on 
i don t believe
what i m watching  bob 
lightning mcqueen
is 100 feet from his piston cup 
the king and chick
rounding turn four 
down the stretch they come 
and it s  and it s   
  it s too close to call  too close 
  i don t believe it 
lightning 
  the most spectacular  amazing   
  i don t believe it 
   unequivocally  unbelievable ending
in the history of the world 
  and we don t know who won 
  look at that 
  that s very close to call 
  can we play that again 
hey  no cameras  get outta here 
we re here in victory lane 
awaiting the results 
mcqueen  that was a risky move 
not taking tires 
tell me about it 
are you sorry you didn t have
a crew chief out there 
oh  kori  there s a lot more to racing
than just winning 
i mean  taking the race by a full lap   
where s the entertainment in that 
i wanted to give folks a little sizzle 
  sizzle 
  am i sorry i don t have a crew chief
