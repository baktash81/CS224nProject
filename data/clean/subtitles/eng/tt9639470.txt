a vision from the past
the murder of a young woman
in the mid to late 1960s
by a man you believe
to be her pimp
yeah
youre an art student correct
uh fashion
have you ever taken
any hallucinogens
acid mushrooms mescaline

into trouble if you have
yeah i know it sounds crazy
but im not on drugs
i dont take anything
you were at a party before
could somebody have
slipped you something
maybe somebody
bought you a drink
get these down you
uh no
no itit it started
before last night
when i was sober
i saw landmarks in my dreams
details of nightclubs
places that
id never been to before
and then i saw those details
in real life
i know something bad happened
to this girl
cause i have these visions
these visions of the past
ever since i moved to london
i keep seeing sandie
ththats the murdered girl
have you only been here
a short time
a few weeks
london well it can be a lot
maybe it would help
if you spoke to someone
look please just listen to me
is there a history
of sschizophrenia
or mental health issues
in your family
i know who the killer is
its her boyfriend
uh and her pimp jack
ive seen him
in the present day
look theres this man
ive seen around soho
who follows me
the first time i saw him
outside one of
those models places
he didnt take
much notice of me
but he did suddenly take notice
when i changed my hair
to the same style
as sandies the murdered girl
what this hairdo
look look my point is
ive seen jack
ive seen the killer
as an old man around soho
can you narrow down
around soho
he drinks at the toucan
i think weve got all we need
papers shuffling
door bangs open
coughing
toilet flushes
detective

last night in soho by dave
dee dozy beaky mick  tich
you came into my life
like rain upon
a barren desert
one smile
and i was born again
i felt sure
it wasnt too late
i found strength
to make me go straight
i had love
and threw it away
why did they lead me
astray
for last night in soho
i let my life go
i never told you
of some things ive done
im so ashamed of
i thought my foolish past
was over and done
i would prove
id make a new start
i tried
with all of my heart
i had dreams
and broke them in two
im just not worthy of you
for last night in soho
i let my life go
well hi there kid
you aint been around
for quite some little while
you got yourself
a real cute doll
youre living life in style
but boy dont get
above your station
if you dont want
aggravation
got a little job for you
this is what youve
gotta do boy
thats how last night
in soho
i let my life go
dont cry my baby
as they lead me
where no love can help me
dont stay around
to watch me go
just forget
there once was a time
you were proud
to call yourself mine
i had love
right here in my hand
why could i not understand
for last night in soho
i let my life go
