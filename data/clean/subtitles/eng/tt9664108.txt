and famine plague the population
science is looking for a new planet
on which human life can thrive
and it finds that in year 2063
the blue
indicates water
the red is oxygen
this is our best chance
to find a habitable planet
one we can colonize
and so ensure the
survival of our species
with the deteriorating
situation here on earth
its essential we send
a scouting mission
as soon as possible
the voyage there will
take 86 years
so the crew will
reproduce onboard the ship
and their grandchildren will be
the ones who reach the planet
nobel
laureate in physics
say hello to
mit bioengineer
our first challenge was finding
30 qualified crew members
able to cope with the stress
of prolonged confinement
that and the knowledge that
they wont be coming back
our solution
breed and raise our own crew
train them in isolation
so they wont miss earth
then the next
step is to assess
when theyll be
ready to go
the younger they are
the longer we can conserve resources
and extend the timeline
of the mission
but they will be on
the ship alone
and while i have every
confidence in our education
and management system
im most concerned
that they
be able to combat
the dangers
they may face
along the way
some were just
beginning to understand
decontamination complete
richard
richard
richard
how would you
solve that one
good
sleep well
christopher
sleep well sela
sleep well zac
im scared
of what
i dont know
theres nothing
to be scared of
youre safe
i want
to go with them
its a oneway
trip richard
there is no
coming back
youll die up there
ill die down
here eventually
seems the same
to me
the whole reason
were raising them this way
is for their
mental health
so they dont miss wide open
spaces sunlight people
now you
on the other hand
are going to have a hard
time dealing with
i wouldnt miss a thing
its not part
of the plan
i know i know
but think of it like this
youll be able
to launch sooner
if i go with them
four years instead
of seven
someone should be
there to raise them
to protect them
you know im right
tminus 15 seconds
we are go for launch
13 12 11
switch from glc to obc
6 5
go main engines
3 2 1
all right
you good
yeah
good luck
thank you
hatch closing
ten years later
you are the link between past
and future generations
and have been entrusted with
the survival of our species
you will have children
onboard the ship
and your grandchildren will be
the ones to reach the planet
onship reproduction will occur
via artificial fertilization
and incubation
during each generations 24th year
in order to maximize resources
well were the first generation
so we wont ever see the planet
well never know
what they discover
thats true
our lives
are unimportant
no your life
my life is as
important as anyones
here or on earth
let me show
you something
not supposed to let
anyone see these
that is my father
and his parents
my grandparents
i never knew them
but i know they lived an honest life
you know they took care of their
family they provided for the future
thats all any
of us can do
whats up
theres a toxin in
the irrigation water
well replace the filter
and test it again
its coming from us
its in our urine
yeah its from
something weve eaten
are we eating
something toxic
maybe toxic for a plant
that relies solely on water
but youre stronger
than that
what is it
whats the chemical
i dont know
just change that filter
hey
what do you
make of this
its an ingredient
in something we eat
why would that
be unavailable
lets go
howd you get
past the firewall
by connecting
directly to the processor
its the same way i got
into the design plans
hmm
try nutrition
its not there
is it some kind
of vitamin
maybe
medication
here we go
the active ingredient
in daily beverage a02
combine with blue
alkaline syrup
to counter
stomach irritation
blue
its the blue
effect is enhanced when
consuming it with food
what effect
i thought it was just
an enzyme for digestion
personality
becomes dull and docile
eliminates sexual
desire and sensation
decreased pleasure
response
decreased pleasure
response
i want
increased pleasure
theyre drugging us
so they
can control us
pacify us
they dont want us
to reproduce naturally
they dont want us
to have sexual relations
so we dont feel what
that feels like
and so we dont
overpopulate the ship
to conserve food
i dont care
im not
drinking it
so richard
lied to you
the mission lies
what else arent
they telling us
well christopher found
a hidden compartment
in the
ships plans
where is it
in pod23
unmarked behind
a wall
whats inside
i dont know yet
dont tell richard
you went off the blue
hes going to force
them back on it anyway
yeah maybe by then
well know what it feels like
what does it
feel like
has anything changed
since you stopped
yes but
wheres my pleasure
here
ow
a little jolt
a bolt
a bite
you know thats a
waste of electricity
go away
so
what have you been thinking
about since our last session
nothing
come on
nothing
well i guess
i was wondering
why do you lie to us
what do you think
i lied about
well i found
out that
what
theres an unmarked
compartment
pod23
well mission withholds certain
information for various reasons
you know
even from me
its not quite lying
but i get what you mean
howd you find it
i just did
whats inside
i dont know
i dont know it must be
for the third generation
but whys it hidden
arent you curious
i am
its probably
reserved for them
its for
your grandchildren
thats a profound thought
i mean youre going
to have children
and youre going
to have grandchildren
what do you
think about that
yeah
theyre normal kids
theyre sensitive
and smart
which means they know when im
not telling them the truth
and thats my point
i want to be honest with
them about everything
otherwise theyll lose
faith in me
so
im going to need a quick
response from you on this
thats all for now
sela
what
you look different
im the same
no youre not
neither am i
what are you
talking about
i dont know
youve changed
everything about you
yeah ive grown up
thats exactly what i
want to talk to you about
you have but youre not
feeling what im feeling
no grabbing zac
i wasnt grabbing
easy with the hands
you know the rules
yeah
yeah
cmon
i hate
those noises
anything
no
so whats causing
the sounds
richard says
its the cooling
and contracting of the
ship when we power down
i dont think the
temperature differential
is enough to affect
the structure that way
plus richards a liar
so what is it
you think its something
on the outside dont you
if theres life on the
planet why not out here
what else can
explain those sounds
what is it
sage
plant that grows
in warm climates
pine needles
its beautiful
hmm
you see that
he can touch her
but i cant
weve lost
contact with earth
because overnight there was a
malfunction in the lct transmitter
ill have to go
exterior to fix it
zac will come with me
and the rest of you
know your roles
right here
here you go
thanks
this sensor goes on your
wrist and it attaches here
but its tricky because
it can come loose
so just
make sure
make sure you
pull the cuff over
the inner sleeve
so that it
hey hey hey
whats happening here
zac what are you doing
youre going to lose food rations if
you dont tell me whats going on
you okay
im fine
zac
zac
zac
phoebe have you
seen zac
no but i heard
what he did
has he done anything
like that before
i dont know
but he stopped taking the blue
are you sure
i saw him
pour it out
christopher
you seen zac
you heard
what he did
oh you think
thats okay
no
good im glad
to hear it
hes not taking
the blue are you
why would i
its a drug
youre drugging us
mission made a decision
to administer medication
to help with
impulse control
to prevent exactly this kind
of thing from happening
its the only way to
deal with living like this
we didnt ask
to be here
nobody chooses what
theyre born into
but you have to find
a way to live your life
you gotta
decide what kind of person
you want to be
you gotta try to be good
why
were just gonna
die in the end
so why cant we do
what we want
whats the difference
whether were good or not
theres a big difference
well i dont see it
are we still
doing the repair
yeah
cmon
all right
put this on
why
youre coming with me
i dont
want to go
look i get that
youre angry
but i need your
help with this
and the sooner
we fix it
the sooner you can
voice your objections
to mission control
ill back you up
depressurization in progress
kai you ready
in the systems room
yes
control room set
med bay
on 1 with vital signs
depressurization complete
opening hatch
whos with him
christopher
were at junction box 1
starting the repair
shut down power
to lct 1 transmitter
copy that
lct 1 shutting down
opening
junction box 1
copy that
lct 1 repair complete
going to lct 2
copy that
lct 2 shut down
there it is
its just the ship
richard told us
what it is
do you see anything
because theres
nothing there
richard
richard
richard
do you read me richard
what happened
i dont know
switching to emergency power
check the breakers
we have
a fire in the systems room
navigation errors
i dont know
were trying to check
negative no effect
communications
the whole systems down
were not transmitting or receiving
no keep the oxygen
were going to go again
its not working
are you pronouncing
him dead
it says the chief medical
officer should note
the time of death
okay
1435 ship time
i just dont understand
what actually happened
you didnt see it
i was facing
the other way
there was
that sound
creaking
just before
it happened
was anyone watching
the monitor
yes we didnt
see anything
i did
and
whatd you see
it looked like
like a force
jumping into him
what do you mean
like a meteoroid
he means
something else
something alien
what
its okay
its going
to be okay
whats going
to happen to us
well be okay
whatever it was
it was on the outside
were safe
inside the ship
but without
richard
we were going to be on our
own at some point anyway
it just happened early
if we keep it together
well be all right
system restarting
did you get an image
everything
recorded is gone
so we cant see
what happened
the fire
in the systems room
destroyed the
surveillance archive
the program says we need to
choose a new chief officer
ill be
chief officer
im head
engineer now
it makes sense
that i be chief
well what
about sela
shes head
medical officer
i dont want
to be chief
it says everyone
gets a vote
we have an election
and the new
chief officer is
christopher
congratulations
thank you
first thing we have to
do is repair the damage
the lcs is down
so we wont be hearing from
earth until we fix it
were on our own now
but we can work our
way out of this
well need
the entire crew
in the damaged area
working on the repairs
the fire knocked out
most of the systems room
well look at electrical
and communications first
pull out all the burned
equipment and replace it
then well work
on the surveillance system
try to get it up and running
so we can see what
really happened to richard
okay
edward said the fire
destroyed all the surveillance
yeah
the connections
are burned
but maybe the drives
are still intact
hey
you okay
yeah
what are you
doing in here
im supposed to destroy
his personal archive
why
its in
the program
they dont want
us to see it
do i have to do it
yes of course
thats richard
when he was ten
thats his sister
thats his parents
his parents
we only have
genetic donors
its the same
is it
we still get our
natures from them
why did he show
you all this
he wanted someone
to talk to
what else
what do you mean
we saw
we saw him
touching you
and we thought that
you and richard
i didnt do anything
with richard
we were just friends
he showed me his things
he would tell me about his life
but why
he felt
alone
day 1240
im not gonna be able
to keep up the count
its hard to explain
on one hand i
i didnt feel like i had
anybody at home
the kids
seemed like my only
relationship so
i didnt want to lose that
and then
on the other hand
i believe
its a noble mission
in the great tradition
of exploration you know
whats out there
why are we here
where are we going
i wont get to
see the answer
but maybe i can move us
a little closer to it
but i think the real
reason why i came is
i wanted to make
sure theyre okay
and i want to protect them
protect us from what
everything okay
yes
hows it going with
the surveillance
not sure yet
where is everyone
hey whats going on
why isnt everyone
at their jobs
we have to repair
the damage
we have to secure
the ship
what are you
doing in here
bit of an emergency
that short circuit cut the
power to the refrigerators
were doing
everything we can
to get them back before
we lose any food
oh
somebody should
have told you
can you fix it
yes
but theres a bunch
of food we need to eat
before it goes
bad and
i was thinking we
could have a party
a feast
what for
to celebrate our
new chief officer
dont drink the blue
dont drink it
why not
zac says
we shouldnt
its medication
to control us
richard
yeah
kai
what are you doing
get out of here now
everyone go
get out
just remember
richard isnt here
to protect you
i dont need him
to protect me
is she all right
she doesnt want me
to touch her
sela
you in there
looking
for sela
shes in the med bay
i just saw her
hi
everything all right
yeah
sela
stop
what are you doing
what does it
look like
looks like you
got here fast
get out
wait
whoa
youre just like him
no you dont
understand
he was coming in
here to get you
i was trying
to help you
why dont you help
the rest of the crew
its getting out of control
youre the leader
you should do
something about it
whyd you do that
what
you knew i was going
to find sela
and you went
right to her
you need to
leave her alone
you think cause
youre chief officer
you can tell me what to do
no
good
im telling you as a friend
stay away from her
ill do what i want
kai
what are you doing kai
whats up
no im good
tayo
tayo get down from there
dont sit
on the table
thats right
youre not supposed put your
feet where youre eating
shut your face
all right
thats enough
kai
what
no no no stop
stop
let go
let go
let it go
let it go
come on
let go
stop
lets get them treated
and then i want everyone
in the common room
theres no more fighting
it has to stop
its not how we resolve
our conflicts
do you understand
also some of us
arent doing our work
no ones
maintaining the ship
why should we if
no one else does
because
if you dont who will
it isnt fair
we have to repair the damage
and safeguard the ship
i want everyone
finishing those two jobs
the ship
is secure
weve done
our job
then everyone should
be in the systems room
no now were working
on the food supply
this is more important
more important
than food
no youre wrong
about that
you havent been working
on the food anyway
you havent been
doing anything
no one has
and if we dont
the mission wont survive
who cares
we wont make
it anyway
but somebody will
and its our job
to support them
to lay the groundwork
for our grandchildren
who cares about them
well be dead
listen were going to get that
whole section up and running
and everyones going
to work on it
i dont want to work
in the systems room
why not
i just dont
he thinks the alien
is living in there
what that doesnt
make any sense
its on
the outside
he says we brought it
inside with richard
christopher
brought it in
now its hiding in
the damaged area
thats not true
i for one
dont know if there is an alien
who cares what
you dont know
if we repair
the damage
we can watch the
surveillance video and see
shut your fat
pusfilled face
ive got
a right to talk
you talk too much as it is
you bloated wheezing blister
zac she can talk
you shut up too
who are you
telling people what to do
im chief officer
why should that make
any difference
because i was chosen
its in the program
its in the rules
who cares about
the rules
zac come on
were strong
we can do what we want
stop it
both of you stop
im not listening to
christopher anymore
hes chief officer
youre not
a commander
youre not a leader
im trying to keep us on track
anyone who wants
to follow me can
ill make more food
thats our food too
and ill protect you
from the alien
especially if hes
inside the ship now
youre just trying
to scare them
are you calling
me a liar
zac why are you
doing this
we need a new leader
he doesnt know
how to feed you
he cant protect you
and im not going to
listen to him anymore
anyone who wants to be a
part of my group is welcome
well have more food
so were strong
strong enough to fight
the alien strong enough
to kill it
anyone who wants
can come with me
what if zac is right
about the alien
if we can just
get that surveillance drive
then we can see what
really happened
you dont think its living in
there do you
i dont know
what are you doing
nothing
wheres christopher
i i dont know
whos in the
systems room
no one
you all stay here
dont let anyone
come in
what do you think
whats through there
what is that
get behind it
try to close the door
go go go
close it close it
what was that
what happened
what was it
the surveillance drive
there was really something in there
what was it
i dont know
not christopher
no
what did it look like
it was dark
we couldnt see
okay
start shutting down
the transmitter circuits now
its pretty damaged
you cant
see anything
copy that
lets try a different angle
i can clean this up
its not as bad as it looks
everything all right
no
what is it
zac and kai were in the systems
room right after you left
they said they
saw the alien
they fought it
what
it wasnt there
when i was inside
and the room
looks destroyed
there are pieces of the
surveillance unit everywhere
the alien did that
or they did it
themselves
it doesnt matter
we have all the
data right here
but if it was
zac and kai
they did it
for a reason
to destroy the record
whos with him
christopher
it was supposed
to be me
richard looked for you
all right
go into lct 2
copy that
shutting down lct 2
you should give him a
little zap for his trouble
for my trouble
a little spark
a sting
a stab
you could do it
i know i could
hed be surprised
hed be shocked
you hear that
yeah its just
the ship
he knew it
was the ship all along
this one
yes
he didnt feel it
nothing
is he touching the cable
yes but his gloves
are insulated
murder
dont mention
this to anyone
not until we decide what to do
how could zac do that
why have they
all gone crazy
maybe they havent
maybe this is what
theyre really like
we have our rules
that keep us in line
but deep down
maybe this is our true nature
no
it cant be
im not like that
youre not like that
youre not
and the crew will be on our
side once they know the truth
im not so sure
they dont care anymore
sometimes
i dont either
you care
i know you do
i should leave
you alone
no
i want you to stay
time to
wake up sela
go away
oh were not going away
were coming in
what are you doing
what are
you doing
i see im breaking up a
nice little thing here
what do you want
were having
a celebration
right now
yes
selas invited
i guess you
are too
come eat
if you want
dont if you dont
you okay
mmmhmm
get some food
you must be hungry
all right listen up
everybody
now i know weve had some
disagreements in the past
were going to put
all that behind us
im chief officer now
and thats the way
its gonna be
from now on
well do the work
but well do it when we
want and how we want
well make the rules
and anyone who breaks them
will have to answer to me
the aliens somewhere
in the ship
well fight it again if we have
to and well defeat it
youll be safe now
cause ill protect you
hey what are you doing
sit down
richard was killed
at 135837
copy that
he was electrocuted
shutting down lct 1
whos with him
christopher
it was supposed to be me
you should give him a
little zap for his trouble
a little spark
a sting
a stab
this one
yes
he didnt feel it
is he touching
the cable
yes
but his gloves are insulated
zac killed richard
there is no alien
not out there not in here
theres only zac
hes been lying to you
the whole time
but now you
know the truth
youve seen it
with your own eyes
zac should go to his compartment
while we consult the program
then well decide
what to do
its true
i did it
i killed him
but i did it for you
i did it to protect you
i did it because i saw
the alien in him
the alien was in richard
and then christopher
brought it inside
thats not true
he shouldnt have
he knew something was
wrong but he did it anyway
he brought the alien
into the ship
just watch the rest
of the video
youll see hes lying
i killed richard
to protect the crew
but now the aliens inside
the ship somewhere
we need to find out
where so we can stop it
so we can kill it
thats right
well kill it
well take
back control
weve been drugged and betrayed
and programmed by liars
but were not going to
follow the program anymore
we cant escape this life
but we wont just lay
down and give up
we wont be afraid
we wont be terrorized
well fight back
well find it
theres nothing
to find
where is it now
first
it was inside richard
now maybe its hiding
in someone else
one of you
it could be you
or you
or you
well kill it
yes well find it
and kill it
kill it
we have to find it
it could be you
or you
or you
or him
its him
its him
him
its him
its him
him
get him
stop stop it
its okay
he had the alien
inside of him
i dont know
he did
dont worry
unless its you
who has it inside
no
its not me
grab anything that can
be used as a weapon
scalpels scissors
anything sharp
we have to arm
ourselves to fight
we need something that
will make him back down
maybe we should
just give up
we cant give up
but theres nothing
we can do right now
we accused him of murder
hes not going to forget that
we should join
his group
i mean thats all he
really wants anyway
maybe later
we can detain him
thats right
when things calm down
eventually
things will calm down and be okay
right now
it is too dangerous
we cant
stay separate
theres no way
to fight him
we dont have
any weapons
weapons
you know where they are
i do
he said you did
who did
richard
i was watching his video diary
and he said you knew about the weapons
chief
wake up
was it the alien
it was christopher
must be for the third
generation
when they reach
the planet
no these are for us
chief
they want
to join us
why should
we let you
what else
can we do
is the alien
inside you
there isnt an
no its not
wherere they hiding
there they are
what are they holding
weapons
and we just
have this
thats not going
to help us
maybe it will
we can say we want
to join his group
like anda and alex
hell never believe it
all we need is a moment
why
so we can get close
and then what
and then ill kill him
kill him
or hes going to kill us
no hes not
theyre moving
they cut
the power
what do we do
we stay in here

sela
we are voting
on everything now
trying to reach consensus
its not easy but its how
we want to move forward
and weve decided
to not go back on the blue
we feel that it is the
best course of action
that we can do better
hey chief
