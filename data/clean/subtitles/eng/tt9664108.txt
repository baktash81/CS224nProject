and famine plague the population 
science is looking for a new planet
on which human life can thrive 
and it finds that in year 2063 
the blue
indicates water 
the red is oxygen 
this is our best chance
to find a habitable planet 
one we can colonize
and so ensure the
survival of our species 
with the deteriorating
situation here on earth 
it s essential we send
a scouting mission
as soon as possible 
the voyage there will
take 86 years 
so  the crew will
reproduce onboard the ship 
and their grandchildren will be
the ones who reach the planet 
nobel
laureate in physics 
say hello to
mit bio engineer 
our first challenge was finding
30 qualified crew members
able to cope with the stress
of prolonged confinement 
that and the knowledge that
they won t be coming back 
our solution 
breed and raise our own crew 
train them in isolation
so they won t miss earth 
then the next
step is to assess
when they ll be
ready to go 
the younger they are 
the longer we can conserve resources
and extend the timeline
of the mission 
but they will be on
the ship alone 
and while i have every
confidence in our education
and management system 
i m most concerned
that they
be able to combat
the dangers
they may face
along the way 
some we re just
beginning to understand 
decontamination complete 
  richard 
  richard 
richard 
how would you
solve that one 
good 
sleep well 
christopher 
sleep well  sela 
sleep well  zac 
i m scared 
of what 
i don t know 
there s nothing
to be scared of 
you re safe 
i want
to go with them 
it s a one way
trip  richard 
there is no
coming back 
you ll die up there 
i ll die down
here eventually 
seems the same
to me 
the whole reason
we re raising them this way
is for their
mental health 
so they don t miss wide open
spaces  sunlight  people 
now you 
on the other hand 
are going to have a hard
time dealing with   
i wouldn t miss a thing 
it s not part
of the plan 
i know  i know 
but think of it like this 
you ll be able
to launch sooner
if i go with them 
four years instead
of seven 
someone should be
there to raise them 
to protect them 
you know i m right 
t minus 15 seconds 
we are go for launch 
13  12  11   
switch from glc to obc 
   6  5   
go main engines 
   3  2  1   
  all right 
  you good 
yeah 
  good luck 
  thank you 
hatch closing 
ten years later
you are the link between past
and future generations
and have been entrusted with
the survival of our species 
you will have children
onboard the ship 
and your grandchildren will be
the ones to reach the planet 
on ship reproduction will occur
via artificial fertilization
and incubation
during each generation s 24th year
in order to maximize resources 
well  we re the first generation 
so we won t ever see the planet 
we ll never know
what they discover 
that s true 
our lives
are unimportant 
no  your life 
my life is as
important as anyone s 
here or on earth 
let me show
you something 
not supposed to let
anyone see these 
that is my father
and his parents 
my grandparents 
i never knew them 
but i know they lived an honest life 
you know  they took care of their
family  they provided for the future 
that s all any
of us can do 
what s up 
there s a toxin in
the irrigation water 
well  replace the filter
and test it again 
it s coming from us 
it s in our urine 
yeah  it s from
something we ve eaten 
are we eating
something toxic 
maybe toxic for a plant
that relies solely on water 
but you re stronger
than that 
what is it 
what s the chemical 
i don t know 
just change that filter 
hey 
what do you
make of this 
it s an ingredient
in something we eat 
why would that
be unavailable 
let s go 
how d you get
past the firewall 
by connecting
directly to the processor 
it s the same way i got
into the design plans 
  hmm 
  try  nutrition  
it s not there 
is it some kind
of vitamin 
maybe
medication 
here we go 
    the active ingredient
in daily beverage a 02  
 combine with blue
alkaline syrup
 to counter
stomach irritation  
blue 
it s the blue 
    effect is enhanced when
consuming it with food  
what effect 
i thought it was just
an enzyme for digestion 
    personality
becomes dull and docile    
    eliminates sexual
desire and sensation    
    decreased pleasure
response    
decreased pleasure
response 
i want
increased pleasure 
they re drugging us 
so they
can control us 
pacify us 
they don t want us
to reproduce naturally 
they don t want us
to have sexual relations 
so we don t feel what
that feels like 
and so we don t
overpopulate the ship 
to conserve food 
i don t care 
i m not
drinking it 
so  richard
lied to you 
the mission lies 
what else aren t
they telling us 
well  christopher found
a hidden compartment 
in the
ship s plans 
where is it 
in pod 23 
unmarked behind
a wall 
what s inside 
i don t know yet 
don t tell richard
you went off the blue 
he s going to force
them back on it anyway 
yeah  maybe  by then 
we ll know what it feels like 
what does it
feel like 
has anything changed
since you stopped 
  yes  but   
  where s my pleasure 
here 
ow 
a little jolt 
  a bolt 
  a bite 
you know that s a
waste of electricity 
go away 
so   
what have you been thinking
about since our last session 
nothing 
come on 
nothing 
well  i guess
i was wondering
why do you lie to us 
what do you think
i lied about 
well  i found
out that   
what 
there s an unmarked
compartment 
pod 23 
well  mission withholds certain
information for various reasons 
you know 
even from me 
it s not quite lying 
but i get what you mean 
how d you find it 
i just did 
what s inside 
i don t know 
i don t know  it must be
for the third generation 
but why s it hidden 
aren t you curious 
i am   
it s probably
reserved for them 
it s for
your grandchildren 
that s a profound thought 
i mean  you re going
to have children 
and you re going
to have grandchildren 
what do you
think about that 
yeah 
they re normal kids 
they re sensitive
and smart
which means they know when i m
not telling them the truth 
and that s my point 
i want to be honest with
them about everything 
otherwise  they ll lose
faith in me 
so   
i m going to need a quick
response from you on this 
that s all for now 
sela 
what 
you look different 
i m the same 
no  you re not 
neither am i 
what are you
talking about 
i don t know 
you ve changed 
everything about you 
yeah  i ve grown up 
that s exactly what i
want to talk to you about 
you have  but you re not
feeling what i m feeling 
no grabbing  zac 
i wasn t grabbing 
easy with the hands 
you know the rules 
yeah 
yeah 
c mon 
i hate
those noises 
anything 
no 
so what s causing
the sounds 
richard says
it s the cooling
and contracting of the
ship when we power down 
i don t think the
temperature differential
is enough to affect
the structure that way 
plus  richard s a liar 
so what is it 
you think it s something
on the outside  don t you 
if there s life on the
planet  why not out here 
what else can
explain those sounds 
what is it 
sage 
plant that grows
in warm climates 
pine needles 
  it s beautiful 
  hmm 
you see that 
he can touch her 
but i can t 
we ve lost
contact with earth
because overnight there was a
malfunction in the lct transmitter 
i ll have to go
exterior to fix it 
zac will come with me 
and the rest of you
know your roles 
right here 
  here you go 
  thanks 
this sensor goes on your
wrist and it attaches here 
but it s tricky because
it can come loose 
so just
make sure   
make sure you
pull the cuff over
the inner sleeve
so that it   
hey  hey  hey 
what s happening here 
zac  what are you doing 
you re going to lose food rations if
you don t tell me what s going on 
you okay 
i m fine 
zac 
zac 
zac 
phoebe  have you
seen zac 
no  but i heard
what he did 
has he done anything
like that before 
i don t know 
but he stopped taking the blue 
are you sure 
i saw him
pour it out 
christopher 
you seen zac 
you heard
what he did 
oh  you think
that s okay 
no 
good  i m glad
to hear it 
he s not taking
the blue  are you 
why would i 
it s a drug 
you re drugging us 
mission made a decision
to administer medication
to help with
impulse control 
to prevent exactly this kind
of thing from happening 
it s the only way to
deal with living like this 
we didn t ask
to be here 
nobody chooses what
they re born into 
but you have to find
a way to live your life 
you gotta
decide what kind of person
you want to be 
you gotta try to be good 
why 
we re just gonna
die in the end 
so why can t we do
what we want 
what s the difference
whether we re good or not 
  there s a big difference 
  well  i don t see it 
are we still
doing the repair 
yeah 
c mon 
all right 
put this on 
  why 
  you re coming with me 
i don t
want to go 
look  i get that
you re angry 
but i need your
help with this 
and the sooner
we fix it 
the sooner you can
voice your objections
to mission control 
i ll back you up 
depressurization in progress 
90  
80  
kai  you ready
in the systems room 
yes 
control room set 
med bay
on 1 with vital signs 
depressurization complete 
opening hatch 
who s with him 
christopher 
we re at junction box 1 
starting the repair 
shut down power
to lct 1 transmitter 
copy that 
lct 1 shutting down 
opening
junction box 1 
copy that 
lct 1 repair complete 
going to lct 2 
copy that 
lct 2 shut down 
there it is 
it s just the ship 
richard told us
what it is 
do you see anything 
because there s
nothing there 
richard 
richard 
richard 
do you read me  richard 
  what happened 
  i don t know 
switching to emergency power 
check the breakers 
we have
a fire in the systems room 
navigation errors 
i don t know 
we re trying to check 
negative  no effect 
communications 
the whole system s down 
we re not transmitting or receiving 
no  keep the oxygen 
we re going to go again 
it s not working 
are you pronouncing
him dead 
it says the chief medical
officer should note
the time of death 
okay 
14 35 ship time 
i just don t understand 
what actually happened 
you didn t see it 
i was facing
the other way 
there was
that sound 
creaking 
just before
it happened 
was anyone watching
the monitor 
yes  we didn t
see anything 
i did 
and 
what d you see 
it looked like   
like a force
jumping into him 
what do you mean 
like a meteoroid 
he means
something else 
something alien 
what 
it s okay 
it s going
to be okay 
what s going
to happen to us 
we ll be okay 
whatever it was 
it was on the outside 
we re safe
inside the ship 
but without
richard   
we were going to be on our
own at some point anyway 
it just happened early 
if we keep it together 
we ll be all right 
system restarting 
did you get an image 
everything
recorded is gone 
so we can t see
what happened 
the fire
in the systems room
destroyed the
surveillance archive 
the program says we need to
choose a new chief officer 
i ll be
chief officer 
i m head
engineer now 
it makes sense
that i be chief 
well  what
about sela 
she s head
medical officer 
i don t want
to be chief 
it says everyone
gets a vote 
we have an election 
and the new
chief officer is   
christopher 
  congratulations 
  thank you 
first thing we have to
do is repair the damage 
the lcs is down 
so we won t be hearing from
earth until we fix it 
we re on our own now 
but we can work our
way out of this 
we ll need
the entire crew
in the damaged area
working on the repairs 
the fire knocked out
most of the systems room 
we ll look at electrical
and communications first 
pull out all the burned
equipment and replace it 
then we ll work
on the surveillance system 
try to get it up and running
so we can see what
really happened to richard 
okay 
edward said the fire
destroyed all the surveillance 
yeah 
the connections
are burned 
but maybe the drives
are still intact 
hey 
you okay 
yeah 
what are you
doing in here 
i m supposed to destroy
his personal archive 
why 
it s in
the program 
they don t want
us to see it 
do i have to do it 
yes  of course 
that s richard
when he was ten 
that s his sister 
that s his parents 
his parents   
we only have
genetic donors 
it s the same 
is it 
we still get our
natures from them 
why did he show
you all this 
he wanted someone
to talk to 
what else 
what do you mean 
we saw   
we saw him
touching you 
and we thought that
you and richard   
i didn t do anything
with richard 
we were just friends 
he showed me his things 
he would tell me about his life 
but why 
he felt
alone 
day 1 240 
i m not gonna be able
to keep up the count   
it s hard to explain 
on one hand  i   
i didn t feel like i had
anybody at home 
the kids
seemed like my only
relationship  so   
i didn t want to lose that 
and then 
on the other hand 
i believe
it s a noble mission 
in the great tradition
of exploration  you know   
what s out there 
why are we here 
where are we going 
i won t get to
see the answer 
but maybe i can move us
a little closer to it 
but i think the real
reason why i came is 
i wanted to make
sure they re okay 
and i want to protect them 
protect us from what 
everything okay 
yes 
how s it going with
the surveillance 
not sure yet 
where is everyone 
hey  what s going on 
why isn t everyone
at their jobs 
we have to repair
the damage 
we have to secure
the ship 
what are you
doing in here 
bit of an emergency 
that short circuit cut the
power to the refrigerators 
we re doing
everything we can
to get them back before
we lose any food 
oh 
somebody should
have told you 
  can you fix it 
  yes 
but there s a bunch
of food we need to eat
before it goes
bad and   
i was thinking we
could have a party 
a feast 
what for 
to celebrate our
new chief officer 
don t drink the blue 
don t drink it 
why not 
zac says
we shouldn t 
it s medication
to control us 
  richard 
  yeah 
kai 
what are you doing 
get out of here now 
everyone go 
get out 
just remember 
richard isn t here
to protect you 
i don t need him
to protect me 
is she all right 
she doesn t want me
to touch her 
sela 
you in there 
looking
for sela 
she s in the med bay 
i just saw her 
hi 
everything all right 
yeah 
sela 
stop 
what are you doing 
what does it
look like 
looks like you
got here fast 
get out 
wait 
  whoa 
  you re just like him 
no  you don t
understand 
he was coming in
here to get you 
i was trying
to help you 
why don t you help
the rest of the crew 
it s getting out of control 
you re the leader 
you should do
something about it 
why d you do that 
what 
you knew i was going
to find sela 
and you went
right to her 
you need to
leave her alone 
you think  cause
you re chief officer 
  you can tell me what to do 
  no 
  good 
  i m telling you as a friend 
stay away from her 
i ll do what i want 
kai 
what are you doing  kai 
what s up 
no  i m good 
tayo   
tayo  get down from there 
don t sit
on the table 
that s right 
you re not supposed put your
feet where you re eating 
shut your face 
all right 
that s enough 
  kai 
  what 
no  no  no  stop 
stop 
let go 
  let go 
  let it go 
  let it go 
  come on 
  let go 
  stop 
let s get them treated 
and then i want everyone
in the common room 
there s no more fighting 
it has to stop 
it s not how we resolve
our conflicts 
do you understand 
also  some of us
aren t doing our work 
no one s
maintaining the ship 
why should we if
no one else does 
because
if you don t  who will 
it isn t fair 
we have to repair the damage
and safeguard the ship 
i want everyone
finishing those two jobs 
the ship
is secure 
we ve done
our job 
then everyone should
be in the systems room 
no  now we re working
on the food supply 
this is more important 
more important
than food 
no  you re wrong
about that 
you haven t been working
on the food anyway 
you haven t been
doing anything 
no one has 
and if we don t 
the mission won t survive 
who cares 
we won t make
it anyway 
but somebody will 
and it s our job
to support them 
to lay the groundwork 
for our grandchildren 
who cares about them 
we ll be dead 
listen  we re going to get that
whole section up and running 
and everyone s going
to work on it 
i don t want to work
in the systems room 
  why not 
  i just don t 
he thinks the alien
is living in there 
what  that doesn t
make any sense 
it s on
the outside 
he says we brought it
inside with richard 
christopher
brought it in 
now it s hiding in
the damaged area 
that s not true 
i  for one 
don t know if there is an alien 
who cares what
you don t know 
if we repair
the damage 
we can watch the
surveillance video and see   
shut your fat 
pus filled face 
i ve got
a right to talk 
you talk too much as it is 
you bloated  wheezing blister 
zac  she can talk 
you shut up  too 
who are you 
telling people what to do 
i m chief officer 
why should that make
any difference 
because i was chosen 
it s in the program 
it s in the rules 
who cares about
the rules 
zac  come on 
we re strong 
we can do what we want 
stop it 
both of you  stop 
i m not listening to
christopher anymore 
he s chief officer 
you re not
a commander 
  you re not a leader 
  i m trying to keep us on track 
anyone who wants
to follow me can 
  i ll make more food 
  that s our food  too 
and i ll protect you
from the alien 
especially if he s
inside the ship now 
you re just trying
to scare them 
are you calling
me a liar 
zac  why are you
doing this 
we need a new leader 
he doesn t know
how to feed you 
he can t protect you 
and i m not going to
listen to him anymore 
anyone who wants to be a
part of my group is welcome 
we ll have more food 
so we re strong   
strong enough to fight
the alien  strong enough
to kill it 
anyone who wants
can come with me 
what if zac is right
about the alien 
if we can just
get that surveillance drive 
then we can see what
really happened 
you don t think it s living in
there  do you 
i don t know 
what are you doing 
nothing 
where s christopher 
i    i don t know 
who s in the
systems room 
no one 
you all stay here 
don t let anyone
come in 
what do you think 
what s through there 
what is that 
  get behind it 
  try to close the door 
go  go  go 
close it  close it 
what was that 
what happened 
what was it 
the surveillance drive 
  there was really something in there 
  what was it 
  i don t know 
  not christopher 
  no 
  what did it look like 
it was dark 
we couldn t see 
okay   
start shutting down
the transmitter circuits now 
it s pretty damaged 
you can t
see anything 
  copy that 
  let s try a different angle 
i can clean this up 
it s not as bad as it looks 
everything all right 
no 
what is it 
zac and kai were in the systems
room right after you left 
they said they
saw the alien 
  they fought it 
  what 
it wasn t there
when i was inside 
and the room
looks destroyed 
there are pieces of the
surveillance unit everywhere 
the alien did that 
or they did it
themselves 
it doesn t matter 
we have all the
data right here 
but if it was
zac and kai 
they did it
for a reason 
to destroy the record 
who s with him 
christopher 
it was supposed
to be me 
richard looked for you 
all right 
go into lct 2 
copy that 
shutting down lct 2 
you should give him a
little zap for his trouble 
for my trouble   
a little spark 
  a sting 
  a stab 
you could do it 
  i know i could 
  he d be surprised 
he d be shocked 
you hear that 
yeah  it s just
the ship 
he knew it
was the ship all along 
this one 
yes 
he didn t feel it 
nothing 
is he touching the cable 
yes  but his gloves
are insulated 
murder   
don t mention
this to anyone 
not until we decide what to do 
how could zac do that 
why have they
all gone crazy 
maybe they haven t 
maybe this is what
they re really like 
we have our rules
that keep us in line 
but deep down 
maybe this is our true nature 
no 
it can t be 
i m not like that 
you re not like that 
you re not 
and the crew will be on our
side once they know the truth 
i m not so sure 
they don t care anymore 
sometimes 
i don t either 
you care 
i know you do 
i should leave
you alone 
no 
i want you to stay 
time to
wake up  sela 
go away 
oh  we re not going away 
we re coming in 
what are you doing 
what are
you doing 
i see i m breaking up a
nice little thing here 
what do you want 
we re having
a celebration 
right now 
yes 
sela s invited 
i guess you
are  too 
come eat 
if you want 
don t if you don t 
  you okay 
  mmm hmm 
get some food 
you must be hungry 
all right  listen up 
everybody 
now i know we ve had some
disagreements in the past 
we re going to put
all that behind us 
i m chief officer now 
and that s the way
it s gonna be 
from now on 
we ll do the work 
but we ll do it when we
want and how we want 
we ll make the rules 
and anyone who breaks them
will have to answer to me 
the alien s somewhere
in the ship 
we ll fight it again if we have
to  and we ll defeat it 
you ll be safe now
 cause i ll protect you 
hey  what are you doing 
sit down 
richard was killed
at 13 58 37 
  copy that 
  he was electrocuted 
shutting down lct 1 
who s with him 
christopher 
it was supposed to be me 
you should give him a
little zap for his trouble 
a little spark 
  a sting 
  a stab 
  this one 
  yes 
he didn t feel it 
is he touching
the cable 
yes 
but his gloves are insulated 
zac killed richard 
there is no alien 
not out there  not in here 
there s only zac 
he s been lying to you
the whole time 
but now you
know the truth 
you ve seen it
with your own eyes 
zac should go to his compartment
while we consult the program 
then we ll decide
what to do 
it s true 
i did it 
i killed him 
but i did it for you 
i did it to protect you 
i did it because i saw
the alien in him 
the alien was in richard 
and then christopher
brought it inside 
that s not true 
he shouldn t have 
he knew something was
wrong  but he did it anyway 
he brought the alien
into the ship 
just watch the rest
of the video 
you ll see he s lying 
i killed richard
to protect the crew 
but now the alien s inside
the ship somewhere 
we need to find out
where so we can stop it 
so we can kill it 
that s right 
we ll kill it 
we ll take
back control 
we ve been drugged and betrayed
and programmed by liars 
but we re not going to
follow the program anymore 
we can t escape this life 
but we won t just lay
down and give up 
we won t be afraid 
we won t be terrorized 
we ll fight back

grab anything that can
be used as a weapon 
scalpels  scissors 
anything sharp 
we have to arm
ourselves to fight 
we need something that
will make him back down 
maybe we should
just give up 
we can t give up 
but there s nothing
we can do right now 
we accused him of murder 
he s not going to forget that 
we should join
his group 
i mean  that s all he
really wants anyway 
maybe later
we can detain him 
that s right 
when things calm down 
eventually 
things will calm down and be okay 
right now 
it is too dangerous 
we can t
stay separate 
there s no way
to fight him 
we don t have
any weapons

i think about the world
we are leaving behind 
and how i ve seen it
at its best and its worst
and how
we ll have our own bad times 
i mean  they re coming 
there is nothing i can do about it 
but i also know that
you will prevail 
and our best will live on 
that we are worth saving 
and the new chief is   
sela 
we are voting
on everything now 
trying to reach consensus 
it s not easy  but it s how
we want to move forward 
and we ve decided
to not go back on the blue 
we feel that it is the
best course of action 
that we can do better 
hey  chief
