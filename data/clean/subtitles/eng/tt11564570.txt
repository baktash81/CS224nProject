as a very different kind of candidate 
governor  thanks for joining us 
working from home like the rest of us 
i can see 
yes  welcome to our office 
campaign center  and kindergarten 
we are losing our minds 
your campaign is backed
by billionaire philanthropist  miles bron 
founder of the ubiquitous tech giant 
alpha  which now has dozens of companies
from alpha cosmos
to alpha car  alpha shop 
i know  i know  i know  but what can i do 
  you can tell him no 
  how about no 
 man  lionel  you re a scientist 
not a publicist 
exactly 
you can t keep making excuses
for every one
of miles bron s insane whims 
genius always looks like insanity
at first  though  right 
isn t that how he became miles bron 
you guys have no idea 
the man faxes me
in the middle of the night 
he loves his faxes 
he sends me his ideas
that i m supposed to 
you know what  you tell me 
genius or insanity 
 uber for biospheres  
i don t know  okay  maybe 
 ai in dogs equals discourse  
okay  i mean  all night long 
they just keep 
but then 
remember  child equals nft  
we all laughed 
but then the crypto kids app
paid for this building 
   man 2  delivery 
  i mean  how do you argue with that 
   man 2  i wiped it down 
  yeah  we know 
never bet against bron  we know it 
but he s asking us to put
a volatile substance on a manned flight 
he won t listen 
he just says   make it work  
and what if it works 
this is science  not a religion 
remember that  lionel 
because if your name is on this 
and it fails 
it will sink you forever 
 mysterious music playing

  oops  sorry  feminists

a young man in america
to slow down so a woman can catch up 
 older woman  duke 
for centuries  the western workplace
has been dominated by men  cause

that s what we did with alpha 
disrupt  see 
tell you a little secret 
your worldview s gonna change 
once you hear it  you can t unhear it 
is your phone turned off 
  oh  i left it in my room 
   miles  okay 
if you want to shake things up 
you start with something small 
you break a norm 
or an idea  or a convention 
some little business model 
but you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway 
everybody gets excited
because you re busting up something
that everyone wanted broken
in the first place 
that s the infraction point 
that s the place
where you have to look within yourself
and ask   am i the kind of person
who will keep going  
will you break more things 
break bigger things 
are you willing to break the thing
that nobody wants you to break 
because at that point 
people are not gonna be on your side 
they re gonna call you crazy 
they re gonna say you re a bully 
they re gonna tell you to stop 
even your partner will say 
 you need to stop  
because as it turns out 
nobody wants you to break
the system itself 
but that is what true disruption is 
and that is what unites all of us 
we all got to that line and crossed it 
mm hmm  mm hmm  mm hmm 
   miles  see 
  yeah  yeah 
so  disruptors 
all of us 
 clapping 
wow 
mmm 
that was some real red pill stuff  miles 
the andi i built alpha with 
she believed it 
oh  i believed it 
i believed it 
mr  blanc  you re a detective  right 
yes  i m 
can you spot the other thing 
the real thing this group has in common 
andi  come on 
oh  lionel 
everybody knows who lionel works for 
that s no secret 
and we know
who bankrolled claire s campaign 
but when nobody 
nobody would touch birdie
with a ten foot pole
because she went on oprah
and compared herself to harriet tubman 
in spirit  oh  god 
 who do you think showed up
as an angel investor
in sweetie pants  huh 
and duke 
when duke got banned from twitch
for hawking rhino horn boner pills
to teenage boys 
there was zero rhino in those pills 
 who set him up at youtube
and used their media empire
to promote the stream 
that is the common thread here 
every single one of you
is holding on for dear life
to miles bron s golden titties 
and each of you 
you ll stab a friend in the back
to hold on 
that is what i believe 
 claire sighs 
 claire  andi  wait 
 miles  wow 
that was so real 
anyway  dinner s at 8 00 
see you all there  yeah 
 birdie  like miles said 
i m a truth teller 
some people can t handle it 
it s a dangerous thing
to mistake speaking without thought
for speaking the truth 
don t you think 
 mysterious music playing 
are you calling me dangerous 
well  we ll see 
if you ll excuse me 
 mysterious music continues 
 claire  something s off 
 lionel  what do you mean 
she s changed 
what s she playing at 
 peg  mr  bron  wait 
hey  hi 
  hello 
   peg  uh 
  please don t do this 
  sorry 
bird showed me the statement you want her
to make to the press about bangladesh 
and if you make her go through with it 
her name is 
destroyed 
but you see  my resume
is just birdie jay  birdie jay 
a short stint in retail 
and then birdie jay 
so if her name is destroyed 
then my name is 
i  i m sorry 
it s peg 
i m begging you 
you gotta get her to make that statement 
it is her only way out 
  what   
  okay  good 
but  uh 
   male voice over speakers  dong 
   gong reverberating 
 lighter clicks 
 alarm blaring 
 automated voice 
this is a smokeless garden 
this is a smokeless garden 
this is a smokeless garden 
 alarms blaring 
 automated voice 
please  keep our water clean 
please  keep our water clean 
please  keep our water clean 
 panting 
 miles laughs 
 rustling 
 miles moaning 
are you gonna do it for me 
 miles  mm hmm 
  to love somebody  playing 
  there s a light  
  a certain kind of light  
 birdie gasps  wow 
  that never shone on me  
  i want my life to be  
  lived with you  
  lived with you  
  there s a way   
welcome  gang 
a few cocktails before i m murdered 
i think i remember everyone s favorite 
and we got tamales 
my chemist 
  mmm  lagavulin 16 
   miles  he likes it heavy on the peat 
 lionel  serve it up neat 
is this my cuban breeze 
the drink that got us on the no fly list
at st  barts  what else 
well   worthlt 
  claire bear 
   claire  hmm 
  room temp white 
   claire  pinot gris 
 grunts 
halle berry  that has a kick 
oh  that s jeremy renner s
small batch hot sauce 
 clears throat 
i let him invest  he sends me
a pallet every year  take a few bottles 
well   coughs   thank you 
i apologize  i don t know your drink 
but  you know  pick your poison 
hey  andi 
i m hoping it s still whiskey soda 
  you know i   
   claire  okay  miles 
 scoffs  i mean 
i know you have a thing for it  but 
i mean  this place is the tate modern 
why would you hang a framed print
of the mona lisa front and center 
it s like having a che poster
in your dorm room 
   miles  mm hmm 
   chuckles 
or 
come on 
wait 
  that s impossible  miles 
   miles  mm hmm 
forgive my incredulity  but surely 
 laughs  no  the mona lisa 
that s property of the state 
there s no way   
blame it on the pando  blanc 
the louvre was closed 
france needed money 
and so i bought myself
a little short term loan 
it turns out the transport
and the security was most of the cost 
check this out 
 glass shield thuds 
   claire  oh my god 
   birdie  oh my god 
   birdie laughs 
   sighs 
don t tell the insurance guys 
but i had
a little override button installed 
  oh  you did 
  where do you think it is 
 thuds 
 birdie  oh  my gosh  it s easy 
 miles  it s so freaking sensitive 
a phone dings  it closes up 
it s ridiculous 
but i needed to be able to look her
in the eyes without glass in between us 
my mom took me to paris
when i was six years old 
first time i looked at this lady 
it changed my life 
you know da vinci invented a technique
for brushstrokes that leave no lines 
that s how you can look straight at her 
and her expression changes every time 
her smile s there  then it disappears 
is she happy  is she sad 
is it something else 
this simple thing
that you thought you were looking at 
it suddenly takes on layers
and depth so complex 
it gives you vertigo 
it really is something 
it s a classic 
hey  not here 
every time we ve gotten to the point
where i m going to strangle you 
you pull something like this 
and it s magic 
  thank you  thank you 
  look  it all started with her 
what did i say to you guys 
the first night we hung out
at the glass onion  what did i say 
i wanna be responsible
for something that gets mentioned
in the same breath as the mona lisa 
forever 
a and what does that mean 
oh  it means immortality 
he wants to do something
that s gonna change   
 claire  wait a minute  miles 
why do you have the mona lisa
in your living room 
in one week 
i ve invited world leaders
and members of the press from all over
to come to this island 
and right here 
i m going to unveil the future 
   sighs 
  you know what this is 
you know damn well we do 
what s going on  miles 
uh  i don t   chuckles 
  don t drop it 
   claire  oh my god 
 miles  that s a new solid hydrogen fuel 
it s incredibly powerful 
it s radically efficient 
zero carbon emissions 
and it s derived from abundant seawater 
i call it klear  with a k 
and at this event 
we are going to announce  klear america  
our affordable home power solution 
klear is going to be powering
people s dreams 
all over this country 
by the end of this year 
   glass shield thuds 
   sighs 
no 
no  because i was clear with you 
i told you i need two years minimum
to test this stuff
to see if it s safe or even viable 
claire and i are not gonna be responsible
for putting something out in the world
before it s tested and   
oh  no 
oh  yeah 
no 
you re running this entire place off this 
all of it  all this awesome lighting 
the heating and cooling 
everything right down to my fax machine 
the whole glass onion is powered by klear 
oh my god  miles 
guys  we did it 
i m out  i m done 
this is reckless 
and you re gonna get somebody killed 
bro  you re not getting out 
it s already happening 
i love you  come on  let s  let s eat 
 lionel sighs heavily 
okay  gang 
it s been a memorable weekend already 
to be sure  but now the real fun starts 
we got three days to bask in the sun 
swim in the ionian sea 
eat good food and wine 
and enjoy each other s company 
but alongside and underneath the partay 
you ve been charged with a serious task 
because tonight  in this very room 
a murder will be committed 
 claire scoffs 
my murder 
you will have
to closely observe the crime 
consider what you know about each other 
know that across the island 
i ve hidden clues 
some may be helpful  some may misdirect 
that s for you to determine 
but if anyone can name the killer 
tell me how they achieved the murder 
and  most importantly 
what was the motive 
that person wins our game 
any questions 
uh  wait  what do we win 
i  what do you mean  what do you 
what do you want 
no  no  nothing  i just 
i just thought maybe
there was a prize or something 
i  an ipad or like 
okay  fine 
yeah  no  the winner gets an ipad 
and  uh  once you re dead 
will we still be able to talk to you 
yeah  i m not playing dead
the whole weekend  dude   splutters 
we hang  but i 
you just can t ask me questions 
i m not gonna help 
i don t actually need an ipad 
i m just saying  it s just 
when you said  win   it 
you know  it made me say it 
can we  um  work together 
 miles  um  only one person
can solve the crime 
so if you got a theory 
keep it close to your chest 
it s designed to be hard 
this will take the whole weekend 
well  this is truly delightful 
oh  have we started already  is it   
  well  the murder hasn t happened  but 
  oh  yeah 
yeah  why not  as watson said to holmes   
it was birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow
in revenge for you stealing
her signature ren diamond 
look at the seating arrangement 
it triangulates birdie
just perfectly with that thing 
which is loaded with a dummy bolt 
aimed directly 
at mr  bron 
now i believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device 
but more damning 
that is a vintage jayhawk brand crossbow 
jayhawk  birdie jay 
of course  there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues 
the hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter b 
birdie s room is the sacral chakra 
which is the one blocked by guilt 
blah  blah  blah  but the motive  yes 
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of the face magazine
with birdie on the cover 
 chuckles   she famously wore
what became known as the ren diamond 
and that s a family heirloom  i believe 
well  to be clear  i mean  i didn t know
what a  blood diamond  was so   
mr  bron  the large pendulous locket
which is  has not left your neck 
 chuckles  bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style 
would you kindly open it for us 
 screams 
my ren diamond 
a dramatic  passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista 
miss birdie jay 
unfortunately  this crime clashed
with the presence of benoit blanc 
 benoit laughs  oh 
that  see that  that just went up 
very good  very good 
my god  that just felt so good 
so solid  so satisfying 
you know  like one of those
mini crosswords the times has
or  you know  i have a chef friend 
and she speaks of trying to create
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bite sized   
you re angry 
no  blanc  i m  uh  just  you know 
what the hell 
that was not
the simplest thing to set up  so 
it s fine  it doesn t matter  it s just 
i hired gillian flynn
to write the whole thing   
  oh  she s quite good 
  she s goddamn expensive  is what she is 
what am i supposed to do now 
play yahtzee all weekend  just   exhales 
mr  bron  truth is 
i  i ruined your game on purpose
and for a very good reason 
i m sorry  what 
i like the glass onion as a metaphor 
an object that seems densely layered 
but in reality
the center is in plain sight 
your relationship with these people
may seem complex 
but look  what you ve done
this weekend is crystal clear 
you ve taken seven people 
each of whom has a real life reason
to wish you harm 
gathered them together on a remote island
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads 
it s like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights 
oh  whoa   chuckles 
come on 
so you play hardball with lionel 
threaten to destroy his reputation
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with klear 
but now with claire too 
now perhaps 
you threaten to support her opponent
in the up and coming election
if she does not approve your power plant 
you have done some homework 
and birdie  bangladesh 
sweetie pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop 
you re making birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor 
and duke  well   chuckles 
 we all know why duke wants to kill you 
he doesn t know about that 
yes  he does 
take my presence as a sign 
for at least one person on this island 
this is not a game 
oh  this is the famous napkin 
i know this story 
  right 
  will you look at that 
i sketched out the original idea
for alpha on a cocktail napkin
and i showed it to andi one night
at the glass onion 
that was our local bar 
that s where it all began 
but they tore it down the year after that 
 benoit  mm hmm 
 sighs  andi 
yes  andi 
andi used to tell me the truth 
nobody does that now 
it s all just fake smiles and agendas
and people wanting
what they think they re owed 
hating you when you don t give it to them
because that s what you re there for 
i know it s probably hard to have sympathy
for the poor  tortured billionaire  but 
god damn  i miss that bar 
  take me home  country roads 
by toots and the maytals playing 
   cell phone dings 
   glass shields thudding 
  yeah  listen   
   phone dings 
   thuds 
you know  you could just power it down 
ah  it s my google alerts

well  i m out of here 
tomorrow morning  gone

 imitates crying 
you can stay  have fun 
  fine  you re murdering my vibe 
   cell phone ringing 
 lionel  well  i hate saying this
in any context 
but i m with duke 
or we can get drunk
and enjoy paradise for the weekend 
we should probably go too 
no  miserable in paradise 
we ve all earned this 
yes  you have 
are we even gonna talk about
the elephant in the room 
or just gonna throw a blanket over it
and push through the weekend 
am i the elephant 
yeah  you re the elephant 
you re not that bad 
 lionel  what d you come for  andi 
given the circumstances 
i think it s a fair question 
fair 
oh my god  yes  no  fine 
nothing about any of this is fair 
congratulations  now  you know 
and we all stuck with miles 
what do you want 
do you wanna know why we did it  hmm 
really  why  do the math  it s easy math 
 scoffs  so you come here 
in your gucci flats  telling us 
valentino 
 that we owe you 
you made money off of alpha
all those years 
you did fine  you got yours 
i got 
no  he got his from me  all of it 
my life was taken away from me
by someone  by everyone in this room 
my life  do you even know what that means 
huh 
what claire s trying to say 
is we re sorry 
we feel bad for you  what do you want 
  are you really asking me that 
   claire  yes  what do you want 
a check  you want performative pity 
 sighs

 sighs 
the truth is  is that we
are all holding on to that golden tit 
we re all playing
the same game here  honey 
you lost 
so you can go ahead
and put yourself up on a cross
like some unspeakable crime
has been committed against you
that none of us could possibly imagine 
but me  i m tired of pretending
like you re the victim in this game 
you just couldn t hack it 
you re the loser  there  that s the truth

it all makes perfect sense 
duke  andi  this weekend 
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island 
will you explain it to us then  detective 
no  i can peel back the layers 
i can take it to a point 
but what lies at the center 
only one person can tell us
who killed cassandra brand 
 gentle piano music playing 
 knock on door 
 benoit  get that  would ya 
 phillip  you re not in the bath again 
are you 
 benoit hesitates  no 
 door unlocking 
yep 
uh 
can i help you 
 in southern accent 
yes  is this benoit blanc s residence 
um  what is this regarding 
well  his office was closed 
and i really need to speak with him 
it s urgent  please 
blanc  there s someone here for you 
with a box 
 benoit chuckles  oh my 
well  why don t we start at the beginning 
my name is helen brand 
and i came all the way here from alabama 
well  what do you do in alabama 
i teach  third grade  do a lot of zooming 
we ve been getting into tie dying a lot
and all this pandemic stuff 
okay  none of that really matters 
mr  blanc  two days ago 
i received a call 
my twin sister committed suicide 
in her car 
in her garage 
with the engine running 
my sister was cassandra brand 
do you know who she was 
yes  of course  i m sorry  you 
i thought you looked familiar   chuckles 
impressive woman  your sister 
you know  she kept a journal
every day of her life
since she was six years old 
you know what she called it 
 notes for future biographers  
biographers  plural 
  the girl was six years old 
   chuckles 
then the day after high school 
she shot off to new york 
and she just never looked back 
 laughs  you know  when we were kids 
we goofed together 
and we d do this character  rich bitch 
 heavens  the dog ate the caviar again  
 chuckles 
then i hear her doing a talk 
and that s exactly how she sounded 
rich bitch  and i m like 
 who are you fooling  girl  not me  
she had the guts and brains
for both of us 
and i was just happy watching her 
you know 
so you  um  you get the call 
yeah  yeah  i get the call and i fly in 
this was yesterday 
and then i go to andi s house 
i m cleaning it out  it s a mess 
all of her books everywhere 
and i m just thinking about
what was taken from my sister 
how i wasn t there for her 
and i m getting angrier and angrier 
and then i just hear a knock at the door 
and it s some courier
with this thing from miles bron 
and i m sure there s
some clever way to open it 
i don t know  i just open it 
and it s an invitation
to his private island in greece
for next weekend 
one of those little trips she d go on
with him and his group of shitheads 
they like to call themselves
 the disruptors  
but i knew who they were 
and i told her who they were  shitheads 
 sighs 
miss brand  what can i do for you 
andi didn t commit suicide 
 dramatic music plays 
 helen  she didn t leave any note 
so i went on her computer 
and i looked in her email 
her sent messages 
to see if she wrote anybody anything 
and look  she sent this at 4 00 p m  
the day she was murdered  four days ago 
 i finally found it  
 it s right here  and i m going to use it
to burn his whole empire down  
 i m giving you all one last chance
to make things right  
  an8  you know where to find me  a  
and i m assuming
all of these names here are   
birdie jay  duke cody 
claire debella and lionel toussaint 
the shitheads 
she sends that email 
nobody writes back anything 
and then the next day 
she s dead in the garage
with sleeping pills in her system 
i searched every inch
of every room in her house 
and guess what wasn t there 
the red envelope 
compelling 
google said you are
the world s greatest detective 
somebody like me 
takes something like this
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers   
but if one was to get  em alone 
isolated for a weekend with 
in your words 
the world s greatest detective 
you wanna hire me to go to that island 
it s a stupid idea  right 
listen  i want to be clear  huh 
i am not batman 
i can find you the truth 
i can gather evidence 
i can present it to the police
and the courts  but   scoffs 
 that is where my jurisdiction ends 
yeah  but it s you doing it instead of me 
i ll take those odds 
i ve not seen
your sister s death in the news 
  did you release a statement 
   helen  no 
shit  was i supposed to 
i don t know how this works 
and you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and 
oh  if i pulled a few strings 
i could keep it from leaking
to the press for another  week 
maybe  that s 
oh 
no  that s outrageous  that wouldn t 
well  now 
wow  no  that  yes  miss brand 
any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me
when you crossed my threshold 
buttress those feelings now 
buttress them 
i am proposing
that you come with me to that island
as your sister 
as cassandra brand 
what  no 
no  no  no  i m hiring you to go 
i  i m not  are you insane 
buttress now  yes 
a famous detective shows up
and out of the blue 
starts poking the subject of your sister 
they ll shut up like a clam 
your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst 
  oh  no  come on  man 
  buttress 
yeah  i m trying real hard to buttress 
but this sounds nuts 
but it is the only way that this works 
look at me 
they ll know instantly that i m not her 
you ll cut your hair 
you ll wear her clothes 
oh  you really think
i can fit into that shit 
  and what about my hair 
  i know a guy 
now  why would anyone suspect
you showing up  playing your sister 
when they don t know your sister is dead 
 helen  right 
they don t know andi is dead 
so why would they suspect anything 
  and you ll do the inspecting 
  yes  i will  you just have to be there 
mr  blanc  is  is this safe 
no  no 
one person will know the truth about you 
from the moment you arrive on that island 
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing 
and they certainly wouldn t hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks 
i m  i m a detective  helen 
i m not a bodyguard 
i m sorry  i can t help you 
no 
one of those shitheads killed my sister 
do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch 
 suspenseful music playing 
 music continues 
well  my goodness 
i shouldn t be here  this is nuts 
but i m here  so let s do this 
  drink 
  you need a drink 
oh  no  i don t drink 
i ll have some coffee 
 waiter  all right 
andi s journals 
good  you keep studying them 
okay  so  tomorrow 
i ll get there early 
really lay on some southern hokum 
get them all off guard 
on the boat  be cold 
don t engage in conversation 
  okay  i m not great on boats 
  oh  you ll be fine 
just remember  rich bitch voice 
andi posture 
i have all of her ted talks on this 
and i ve been studying  em 
good 
   in stately tone  the dog ate the caviar 
  there you go 
yeah 
 in southern accent  so  you said
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive 
did you find anything 
yes  i did 
but motives for each of them
to want miles bron dead 
now why would they
kill her to protect him 
i just don t get it 
what about miles  what if he just did it 
well  we can t rule it out 
but miles bron is not an idiot 
to risk committing murder
after a very public court case 
with the possibility
of that email of andi s coming to light 
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do 
especially if someone
was willing to do it for him 
come on  walk me through these journals 
okay 
about ten years ago 
before they all hit it big 
they used to hang together at this bar 
 benoit  and miles was leader of the pack 
 helen  no  andi was 
they were all friends with andi 
birdie was a washed up model 
duke was a nerd
doing video game tournaments 
claire just lost a race for city council 
lionel was a substitute teacher 
all of them run aground in their thirties 
but andi saw their potentials 
she found them all 
  hi 
  hey 
 helen  then she found miles 
introduced him to the group 
this is miles 
  hey  nice to meet you 
  hey  bro 
 claire  i love your hair 
 helen  at first  nobody liked him 
 miles   outlive the person 
 helen  he d say stuff like 
i want to be responsible for something
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the mona lisa  forever 
what does that even mean 
it just means immortality 
he wants to create something
that feels lasting  that feels   
his first venture was moviefone
for foot massages 
  did it work 
   lionel  no 
okay  listen  let s just roll with it 
let s humor him  let s see where it goes 
let s see what happens 
  hey  team 
   helen  and things started happening 
 screams 
 helen  he got birdie a show
for her designs  it did well 
got lionel published 
duke set up at twitch 
claire elected locally 
 at you  i love you back 
 helen  you know  small stuff 
but it happened 
  an8 and then the big thing happened 
what is that you re working on 
  he told me  
  let the children lose it  
  let the children use it  
  let all the children boogie  
so based on the napkin idea 
andi and miles created alpha 
it blows up 
they bring everyone along for the ride 
miles  aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger 
cut to two years ago 
miles meets
some sketchy norwegian scientist
at an ayahuasca ceremony in peru
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel 
  hmm 
  he becomes obsessed 
and he s willing to give the company s
entire resources to launch this thing 
no 
andi  andi  come on  this is it 
no  no  no  this is not a start up 
this could blow up the world 
yeah 
no  literally  miles 
this could blow up the world 
 sighs 
the reality distortion field ends here 
i can t let you do this 
what  what do you mean you can t let me 
i ll walk 
and i ll take half the company
to stop you from using it for this 
and she did it 
and  god  i love that she did it 
then she found out miles
had the lawyers work the contract
so she was cut out the company completely 
so she sued over that 
her whole case was based on
intellectual ownership
of the company s founding idea 
her idea on the napkin 
which she didn t keep 
miles was very excited  he had an idea 
uh  so he grabbed a napkin 
and he  uh  he scribbled
something on it to show us 
  that s a lie  your honor  it s a lie 
   judge  order  counsel  get your client   
 andi  look me in the eye  claire 
you know it s a lie 
it s a lie 
 camera shutters clicking 
 lawyer  and do you recall  mr  cody 
who wrote this napkin 
yeah  miles 
uh  it was miles 
miles 
 helen  this was march 
and right after the verdict 
miles suddenly found the napkin
written in his handwriting
and did all those interviews about it 
 benoit  a bald faced fabrication 
a damn lie  and it worked 
 dramatic music playing 
 grunts 
so  every one of the disruptors
perjured themselves
to destroy andi and shield miles bron 
we  you and i 
we need to find out why  motive 
whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder 
and then  this will be tricky 
everyone s whereabouts
on the night of her death 
who could have been
at andi s house that night  opportunity 
  our suspects  motive  opportunity  hey 
  mm hmm 
  this kinda looks like that clue notepad 
  yes  yes  yes 
you must be really great at clue  huh 
i m very bad at dumb things 
my achilles  heel 
ticking boxes  running around 
searching all the rooms 
it s just a terrible  terrible game 
well  my students love it 
i m scared 
i understand 
this is your last chance to back out 
 dramatic music playing 
 grunts softly 
oh  god  boats 
 duke whistles 
ballsy move 
 birdie  you shouldn t be here 
duke and birdie  i think they re onto me 
or they were just being assholes 
well  that s not mutually exclusive 
now  look  i suspect 
when we re all settling in 
bron s going to pull me aside
to explain my presence 
that is your chance to snoop 
snoop 
snoop 
 suspenseful music playing 
snooping  snoop 
okay  here we go 
   whiskey  hey 
   helen  in stately tone  hi 
andi 
yes 
i m whiskey  we didn t really meet 
  are you looking for the pool 
  i am 
  do you want to walk 
  sure 
do you want this  i m not into it 
it smells like that guy derol 
that s a beautiful necklace 
you re a taurus 
yeah  um  miles got it for me 
he  um  surprised me for my birthday 
he filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses 
it was very cute 
he s a really good guy  he s complicated 
but 
i think it s really shitty
what they all did to you 
and how they all treated you 
i read your court transcripts 
and you got shanked 
thanks  whiskey 
yeah  this is my second one
of these things 
we did a yacht thing last year 
well  that sounds fun 
 laughs  no 
i mean  when they re all together 
it s kind of the worst 
duke just treats me like arm candy 
and they just ignore me 
  why do you put up with it 
  with duke 
i m building my brand  and he s putting me
on his channel more often 
though  he s leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff 
if i m going to go
into politics eventually 
i don t think
that s a road i wanna go down 
it s expeditious 
but it s kind of a shitshow 
  oh  here s the pool 
  i m gonna walk around a little longer 
  i ll catch you over there 
  okay 
hey  it s really great
talking to you  whiskey 
you too 
   male voice over speakers  dong 
   gong reverberating 
   gunshot 
   claire  oh my god 
 duke  really 
asshole 
   miles  now it s a party 
   grunts 
i did it  two weeks ago  i did it 
you signed off on the power plant 
yep  when this thing breaks  poof 
my whole base is gone 
the grassroots lefties  gone 
i did it too 
did what 
i signed off on putting klear
in a manned mission 
  the staff doesn t know it yet 
   claire  oh  god damn it 
let s just pray that
andi was wrong about this klear stuff 
no  she was right 
you put its gas form
into household piping 
there s massive leakage into the air 
the hydrogen particles are too small 
hydrogen gas 
lionel  i sold my soul for this 
you re telling me that it could literally
turn people s homes into the hindenburg 
i will take care of him  don t worry 
there was a time  you know  back when 
i was the one on magazines  he was nobody 
he was this little thing in my hand 
i preferred that 
andi  hi 
wow  no 
 chuckles  you re really good at this 
this is interesting stuff about whiskey
and motives for both lionel and claire 
well done 
those were motives 
because i was kind of confused 
oh  no  they bet the farm
and will both be ruined
along with miles if he fails 
they need to protect him at all costs 
but i can t imagine them killing her 
i just can t 
think of the crime  the nature of it 
no  they ve come to apologize 
to make amends 
and the murder itself  it s nonviolent 
gentle even 
they don t even see her die 
 engine starts 
 benoit  she just goes to sleep 
no  no 
they re all more than capable 
 helen gulping 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
i thought you said you didn t drink 
oh  this  this isn t a drink 
this is some funky health stuff 
no  you give me that 
that s hard kombucha 
that s jared leto s hard kombucha 
what is it that  that s 9  alcohol or so 
get off that 
how many of these things you had 
i don t know  but i feel fine 
okay  we need to focus 
we need to focus  we need
to find the o s  the opportunities 
we got to open them up  it s time to push 
no  no  no 
we re not pushing anything right now 
listen  i feel good 
i think maybe you should lie down 
  we re running out of time  blanc 
  helen 
 softly  helen 
please 
think of the danger here 
you gotta step back
and let me handle this 
push nothing 
 miles  they re gonna tell you to stop 
even your partner will say 
 you need to stop  
because as it turns out 
nobody wants you to break
the system itself 
but that is what true disruption is 
and that is what unites all of us 
we all got to that line and crossed it 
 claire  andi 
wait  wait 
wait  no  you wait 
that day in court 
you couldn t even look me in the eye 
what are you doing 
you want to talk about the email 
oh 
so now you want to talk about the email 
you didn t even write back 
i m a politician 
i never email anything
that i wouldn t want to see
on the front page of the times 
that s why i called 
 scoffs 
we all did 
right after we got it  over and over 
you  your phone was off 
and then the whole next week 
yeah  i ve got a new number 
and when we couldn t reach you 
i went to your house 
 claire  lionel and i got there
at the same time 
duke was already there 
   duke  andi 
   lionel  hey  andi 
 duke  the lights were out 
i was pounding so hard 
i almost broke it down 
andi 
we knocked  waited  and called for you 
but after an hour  we left 
birdie came back later on to check 
it was the same thing 
  where the hell were you  andi 
  what time did you get there 
i don t know  it was dark 
and  duke 
you were already there 
he almost got in an accident
on his motorcycle 
he was driving so fast 
andi  i almost got pancaked 
okay  okay  can you say all that
one more time for me  please 
 sighs 
look 
i don t know what you re planning
on pulling being here 
but we need to talk about this 
if i would ve answered
the door that night 
would you have said 
 i m sorry  i back you with miles  
or were you just showing up
so you could stop me
from using that envelope 
something s off 
i don t like it 
what s she playing at 
 alarm blaring 
 automated voice 
please  keep our water clean  please 
 helen  blanc 
 automated voice 
please  keep our water clean 
that s everything she said  i think 
i think maybe you should take up drinking 
you re just killing it 
lionel and claire were never there alone 
but duke came early and birdie came late 
but they could ve gotten there early 
killed your sister 
  an8 circled away and then waited
for the other to arrive 
  an8 shit 
  an8 something is just teasing the edge
of my brain 
  an8 this  this case confounds me 
it just confounds me 
  an8 we don t have a motive
for duke or birdie  so   
  an8 do either of you two
want to do a session or what 
i m on the clock 
no  not right now 
 fax machine whirring 
maybe later 
all right  it s your money  not mine 
ugh  oh  if i ever meet jared leto 
i m gonna whoop his kombucha brewing ass 
one number  all his machines 
 helen  holy shit 
from that afternoon 
just minutes after andi sent the email 
lionel  lionel faxed it   
now hold on 
it doesn t necessarily mean he  get down 
right now  go to him 
do what you gotta do 
push that son of a bitch 
just get an answer out of him 
look  babe  we really need this 
so do this for me one last time  okay 
  all right  i love   
   line disconnects 
 miles chuckles 
 miles moaning 
 miles  come here 
 rustling 
are you gonna do it for me 
 miles  mm hmm 
 grunts

  hmm 
  huh uh 
oh  come on  come on 
it s all he wants 
the youtube channel s dying 
he needs the exposure 
just put him on alpha news  baby 
just a late night spot 
and you know he s earned it 
with what he did 
 miles  listen  listen 
i am building the future of news 
i can t have
rhino horn boner pill karma in the mix 
   both giggle 
  see  see 
like  he is my loyal friend 
but i can t put him on alpha news  okay 
 breathing heavily 
 birdie  there s no stopping it  peg 
i can t do this anymore  i m done 
  peg 
  don t  just don t talk to me 
  wait  peg 
   peg  ten years  ten years 
my therapist says
this is a toxic relationship 
   birdie  don t be like that 
   peg  don t follow me  birdie 
i quit  i quit 
 birdie  it was a tribute to beyoncé 
but people 
 fast forwarding 
 peg  what did miles mean 
 this is her only chance  
 birdie  what does anything mean 
 peg  i swear to god 
i ll punch you in the face if you do not 
 tell me 
i am going to sign the statement 
no  that will destroy us 
there s no coming   
the story is gonna break 
there s no stopping it 
we will do what we always do 
deny  half apologize 
and then go silent awhile 
i will handle this  you 
what is this 
it s my secret phone 
what is this 
an email from the sweetie pants contractor
two years ago 
 miss jay  i m writing to inform you
that the proposed bangladesh factory
is notoriously one of the world s
biggest sweatshops  
 please advise  
and then you replied 
 sounds perfect  thanks  
with your memoji dabbing 
birdie 
please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make
sweatpants 
oh my god 
 sighs  miles is going to pay me off 
he said if i take full responsibility
for the sweatshops 
he ll pay me the value of my shares 
thirty million 
i will do whatever i have to do
to save myself 
and he is my only lifeline 
  can i have my secret phone back 
   peg  no 
this never happens in clue 
that s because it s a terrible game 
they all had a motive to protect miles 
they were all there that night 
so what now  detective 
the envelope 
whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect miles 
and they wouldn t just destroy it 
they would want him to see
what they d done for him 
they brought it here  it s here 
so how are we supposed to find it 
well  unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner 
they won t have an envelope
that size on their person 
they ll have to hide it in their room 
so  at dinner tonight 
andi  i m hoping it s still whiskey soda 
 benoit  you need to keep your head clear
and stay sharp 
because you have to find a way 
 helen  i want the truth 
 thuds 
i can give you that 
 benoit  a way that is
so painfully uncomfortable
that nobody will question it
or follow you 
  pick a fight  and lose 
  i m tired of pretending

you re the loser  that s the truth 
 duke grunts

   helen grunts softly 
   benoit  inside 
 helen whimpering softly 
 benoit  it s time to finish this 
 helen straining 
 gasps  blowing nose 
shitballs 
 miles  it makes no sense 
 benoit  this makes perfect sense 
duke  andi  this weekend 
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island 
will you explain it
to us all then  detective 
no  i can peel back the layers 
i can take it to a point 
but what lies at the center 
only one person can tell us
who killed cassandra brand 
who 
well  i keep returning 
in my mind  to the glass onion 
something that seems densely layered 
mysterious and inscrutable 
but in fact  the center is in plain sight 
where  where 
and that is why
this case has confounded me like no other 
why every complex layer
peeled back has revealed
another layer and another layer
and come to naught 
and that was the problem  right there 
you see  i expected complexity 
i expected intelligence 
i expected a puzzle  a game 
but that s not what any of this is 
it hides not behind complexity 
but behind mind numbing obvious clarity 
truth is  it doesn t hide at all 
i was staring right at it 
 soaring  dramatic music plays 
the killer nearly struck
my achilles  heel 
but thank high heaven  at the last moment 
i realized what had teased my brain
through this entire case 
 inbreathiate  
it s not a word 
what 
can we just take a second
and fully inbreathiate this moment 
it s not a real word 
it kind of sounds like one 
but it s just entirely made up 
now  reclamation  
now  well  that 
that is a word  but it s the wrong word 
this place is the full reclamation
of everything i ve achieved up to now 
this entire day 
the predefinite detective 
a veritable minefield of malapropisms 
the infraction point 
 and factual errors 
bask in the sun  swim in the ionian sea 
that is the aegean sea 
oh  yeah  it is  it is 
his dock doesn t float 
his wonder fuel is a disaster 
his grasp of disruption theory
is remedial at best 
he didn t design the puzzle boxes 
he didn t write the mystery 
et voilà  it all adds up 
the key to this entire case 
and it was staring me right in the face 
like everyone in the world 
i assumed miles bron was
a complicated genius 
but why 
look into the clear center
of this glass onion 
miles bron is an idiot 
oh  please 
just tell us who tried to kill me 
nobody tried to kill you 
you vainglorious buffoon 
duke took my glass 
that s what you told us he did 
he must ve picked it up by mistake 
you told us  right after it happened 
look at that dress spin 
birdie  do that again  watch this 
and after you said those words 
that s what we all remember seeing 
but think 
ignore his lies  everyone 
and think clearly now 
what did we all actually see 
wow  look at that dress spin 
birdie  that s amazing 
just 
   gasps 
   benoit  you handed duke your own glass 
clear as crystal 
right in front of our eyes 
all of us 
and then told a bald faced fabrication 
and it worked 
blanc  are you telling us
miles killed duke 
  yes 
  why 
because the night
andi sent you all the emails 
when duke got to andi s house
early on his motorcycle 
 engine revving 
 benoit   he saw miles leaving 
 tires screeching 
 benoit  was almost struck by him 
in fact  he told all of us 
right out in the open  he told us 
iconic 
remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of andi s 
anderson cooper s birthday  mm hmm 
that night  at andi s 
that night  duke told us
he almost got in an accident 
he  pancaked 
yeah  but miles had been living in greece
the past six months 
no  whiskey 
miles saw you
on your birthday in new york 
gave you that necklace for your birthday 
and you re a taurus 
i am 
two weeks ago 
   benoit  forget the hydrofuels 
  may 9th 
 and the sweatshops 
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments 
sorry  what 
and focus
on the envelope 
 screams 
 gasps  holy shit 
what is reality 
andi 
 benoit  who did the envelope threaten 
miles bron 
that night  lionel faxed andi s email
to miles who received it in new york 
the one thing that could destroy
his empire of lies 
the truth in the hands
of the only person unafraid to tell it 
so miles drives his baby blue porsche
to the scene of the crime 
and andi lets him in 
of course she did 
miles  machine of lawyers and power
could destroy her
through sheer dumb force 
but miles himself 
oh  she was clever enough
not to fear miles 
but she didn t see the real threat 
the obvious threat until it was too late 
duke alone knew you were there that night 
but he didn t know andi was dead 
no  no  he didn t know that
until this evening 
right here 
when he got a google alert on his phone 
which has now fallen strangely silent 
and which he showed to you 
 gasps 
 because you don t own a phone 
duke  no 
did he really think
he could stop all of them
from finding out about andi s death 
they all have phones 
  where s my phone 
   birdie  peggy 
  phone 
  still no 
 benoit  he didn t need to hide the death 
he just needed to hide
that duke had shown him the death
moments before he was killed 
right out in the open  duke showed him 
 duke  that changes things  right 
it sure does 
and told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence 
numbers like this 
maybe we can talk alpha news 
you bet your ass  come here 
so what does miles do 
does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something 
is that a rich person thing 
no  no  no  no  it s just 
it s so much stupider than that 
birdie  what are the ingredients
to your cuban breeze 
um  vodka  amaretto 
oh  god 
 birdie  and  pineapple juice 
no pineapple in that  right 
duke don t dance with pineapple 
an allergy 
he can t even have a drop 
pineapple juice 
he just put
pineapple juice in his whiskey 
it s so dumb 
oh  it s so dumb  it s brilliant 
no  it s just dumb 
 died of an apparent suicide 
she is survived by her sister  helen  
helen 
you told me about helen  your sister   
 gasps  oh  wait 
helen brand  ladies and gentlemen 
and now we come
to helen s attempted murder 
which  i have to give you credit for 
did have a sound foundation of thought 
you realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you 
you have a house on a remote island 
filled with desperate people 
all of whom have a real life reason
to wish this woman harm  you   
furthermore  you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach 
and the lights had even been turned off 
you ve taken seven people 
each of whom has a real life reason
to wish you harm 
gathered them together on a remote island 
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads 
it s like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights 
heavens to 
you dim witted  brainless
jackass 
your one murder  with any panache at all 
and you stole the whole idea from me 
 dramatic music playing 
 gunshot 
and after all that  you 
you still kept the envelope 
you didn t burn it or anything 
you recognize this 
andi s handwriting 
i got you  son of a bitch 
oh  let s slow down there  sister  okay 
because first  how could you
ever prove that that s the original 
  she might have copied mine 
  no 
the bar closed nine years ago 
and hers has one thing
that yours just doesn t 
okay  but second 
 thuds 
  what the hell did he do 
  he just burned it 
 miles  burned what 
i didn t see anything 
 helen  you burned it 
  is someone making toast 
  this will not stand 
uh huh  well  did you see this proof 
this smoking napkin  blanc 
no  did anybody 
okay  then wow 
wow  we got some big accusations
flying around here 
except  everybody seems to have
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw 
and there s nothing
but totally circumspective evidence 
 sighs 
so  if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game 
which we should have been doing
all weekend 
then blanc wins an ipad pro this time 
but this is the real world 
and in the real world  you need
more than a neat  little detective story 
you need evidence 
and you ve got  nothing 
do you 
he s right 
the contents of that envelope
and his possession of it
were our only physical evidence 
right 
wanna take that to the cops 
you wanna take it to the courts 
 chuckles 
look  you pick your poison 
anywhere you go 
it s going to be your word against mine 
how do you think that s gonna go 
i think it s gonna go
about like it went for andi 
jesus 
and  i do want to say 
your sister was a complicated woman 
but she meant the world to me 
and i m so sorry for your loss 
nobody s stepping up 
raise your hand
and say   i saw him take duke s gun  
 i saw him that night at andi s house  
 i saw the napkin before he burned it  
we didn t 
we  we didn t 
you would lie for a lie 
but you won t lie for the truth 
you re still holding on to his titties 
you shitheads 
blanc 
i need you to do something 
i m sorry  helen 
i gave you the truth 
this is where my jurisdiction ends 
i have to answer to the police 
the courts  the system 
there s nothing i can do 
except maybe 
offer you some courage 
and a reminder of why your sister
walked away in the first place 
 menacing music playing 
 frenetic string music playing
