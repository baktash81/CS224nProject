the man faxes me
in the middle of the night

whiskey laughs

i mean for all of us
for anybody right peg

im gonna go for a swim
machine beeps whirring
now i can handle
the matisse in the bathroom
but is uh is that a fax machine
birdie chuckles
miles doesnt even have a phone
its really convenient i have one number
goes to all my fax machines
all over the world
theres something about analog thats
oh look at this blast from my past
an8 chuckles
look everybody look
miles youre so funny
having this around
benoit may i ask
if it isnt too presumptuous of me
what first drew you all together
youre such an eclectic bunch chuckles
i think disruptors recognize each other
yes
now youve used
that word before disruptors
what does that mean
miles some people think
birdies disruptive
every time she opens her mouth
i mean just because she says
what everyones thinking
but no ones got the nerve to say
its true i say it like i see it
no but seriously you know about
sweetie pants right
im going to embarrass myself here
i adore sweetie pants i live in mine
youre sitting next to birdie jay
she was a fashion icon
and then the youngest editor ever
of she she magazine right
establishment bs
on top of the world but then
well sighs
then there was the whole thing
with the halloween costume
oh
birdie it was a tribute to beyoncé
but people did not take it that way
anyway i had a lot of time at home
benoit mmhmm
birdie i just spent all my time in my
oh in sweatpants
miles she comes out with designer
high quality comfortable sweatpants
just as a pandemic hits
she disrupted her own disruption
she made a killing
and look at duke
you think people looked at him
and saw anything other than the beef
you think they saw the first influencer
to have a million followers on twitch
yes i did here it is
grunts deal with it
hello
miles what about claire
you know soccer mom in beige
throwing grenades into machine politics
lionel he didnt wait ten years
licking on the taint of academia
to get permission to start pushing
the boundaries of science
he just did it
thats what i did with al
thats what we did with alpha
disrupt see
tell you a little secret
your worldviews gonna change
once you hear it you cant unhear it
is your phone turned off
oh i left it in my room
miles okay
if you want to shake things up
you start with something small
you break a norm
or an idea or a convention
some little business model
but you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway
everybody gets excited
because youre busting up something
that everyone wanted broken
in the first place
thats the infraction point
thats the place
where you have to look within yourself
and ask am i the kind of person
who will keep going
will you break more things
break bigger things
are you willing to break the thing
that nobody wants you to break
because at that point
people are not gonna be on your side
theyre gonna call you crazy
theyre gonna say youre a bully
theyre gonna tell you to stop
even your partner will say
you need to stop
because as it turns out
nobody wants you to break
the system itself
but that is what true disruption is
and that is what unites all of us
we all got to that line and crossed it
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
miles see
yeah yeah
so disruptors
all of us
clapping
wow
mmm
that was some real redpill stuff miles
the andi i built alpha with
she believed it
oh i believed it
i believed it
mr blanc youre a detective right
yes im
can you spot the other thing
the real thing this group has in common
andi come on
oh lionel
everybody knows who lionel works for
thats no secret
and we know
who bankrolled claires campaign
but when nobody
nobody would touch birdie
with a tenfoot pole
because she went on oprah
and compared herself to harriet tubman
in spirit oh god
who do you think showed up
as an angel investor
in sweetie pants huh
and duke
when duke got banned from twitch
for hawking rhinohorn boner pills
to teenage boys
there was zero rhino in those pills
who set him up at youtube
and used their media empire
to promote the stream
that is the common thread here
every single one of you
is holding on for dear life
to miles brons golden titties
and each of you
youll stab a friend in the back
to hold on
that is what i believe
claire sighs
claire andi wait
miles wow
that was so real
anyway dinners at 800
see you all there yeah
birdie like miles said
im a truthteller
some people cant handle it
its a dangerous thing
to mistake speaking without thought
for speaking the truth
dont you think
mysterious music playing
are you calling me dangerous
well well see
if youll excuse me
mysterious music continues
claire somethings off
lionel what do you mean
shes changed
whats she playing at
peg mr bron wait
hey hi
hello

bird showed me the statement you want her
to make to the press about bangladesh

i apologize i dont know your drink
but you know pick your poison
hey andi
im hoping its still whiskey soda
you know i
claire okay miles
scoffs i mean
i know you have a thing for it but
i mean this place is the tate modern
why would you hang a framed print
of the mona lisa front and center
its like having a che poster
in your dorm room
miles mmhmm
chuckles
or
come on
wait
thats impossible miles
miles mmhmm
forgive my incredulity but surely
laughs no the mona lisa
thats property of the state
theres no way
blame it on the pando blanc
the louvre was closed
france needed money
and so i bought myself
a little shortterm loan
it turns out the transport
and the security was most of the cost
check this out
glass shield thuds
claire oh my god
birdie oh my god
birdie laughs
sighs
dont tell the insurance guys
but i had
a little override button installed
oh you did
where do you think it is
thuds
birdie oh my gosh its easy
miles its so freaking sensitive
a phone dings it closes up
its ridiculous
but i needed to be able to look her
in the eyes without glass in between us
my mom took me to paris
when i was six years old
first time i looked at this lady
it changed my life
you know da vinci invented a technique
for brushstrokes that leave no lines
thats how you can look straight at her
and her expression changes every time
her smiles there then it disappears
is she happy is she sad
is it something else
this simple thing
that you thought you were looking at
it suddenly takes on layers
and depth so complex
it gives you vertigo
it really is something
its a classic
hey not here
every time weve gotten to the point
where im going to strangle you
you pull something like this
and its magic
thank you thank you
look it all started with her
what did i say to you guys
the first night we hung out
at the glass onion what did i say
i wanna be responsible
for something that gets mentioned
in the same breath as the mona lisa
forever
aand what does that mean
oh it means immortality
he wants to do something
thats gonna change
claire wait a minute miles
why do you have the mona lisa
in your living room
in one week
ive invited world leaders
and members of the press from all over
to come to this island
and right here
im going to unveil the future
sighs
you know what this is
you know damn well we do
whats going on miles
uh i dont chuckles
dont drop it
claire oh my god
miles thats a new solid hydrogen fuel
its incredibly powerful
its radically efficient
zero carbon emissions
and its derived from abundant seawater
i call it klear with a k
and at this event
we are going to announce klear america
our affordable home power solution
klear is going to be powering
peoples dreams
all over this country
by the end of this year
glass shield thuds
sighs
no
no because i was clear with you
i told you i need two years minimum
to test this stuff
to see if its safe or even viable
claire and i are not gonna be responsible
for putting something out in the world
before its tested and
oh no
oh yeah
no
youre running this entire place off this
all of it all this awesome lighting
the heating and cooling
everything right down to my fax machine
the whole glass onion is powered by klear
oh my god miles
guys we did it
im out im done
this is reckless
and youre gonna get somebody killed
bro youre not getting out
its already happening
i love you come on lets lets eat
lionel sighs heavily
okay gang
its been a memorable weekend already
to be sure but now the real fun starts
we got three days to bask in the sun
swim in the ionian sea
eat good food and wine
and enjoy each others company
but alongside and underneath the partay
youve been charged with a serious task
because tonight in this very room
a murder will be committed
claire scoffs
my murder
you will have
to closely observe the crime
consider what you know about each other
know that across the island
ive hidden clues
some may be helpful some may misdirect
thats for you to determine
but if anyone can name the killer
tell me how they achieved the murder
and most importantly
what was the motive
that person wins our game
any questions
uh wait what do we win
i what do you mean what do you
what do you want
no no nothing i just
i just thought maybe
there was a prize or something
i an ipad or like
okay fine
yeah no the winner gets an ipad
and uh once youre dead
will we still be able to talk to you
yeah im not playing dead
the whole weekend dude splutters
we hang but i
you just cant ask me questions
im not gonna help
i dont actually need an ipad
im just saying its just
when you said win it
you know it made me say it
can we um work together
miles um only one person
can solve the crime
so if you got a theory
keep it close to your chest
its designed to be hard
this will take the whole weekend
well this is truly delightful
oh have we started already is it
well the murder hasnt happened but
oh yeah
yeah why not as watson said to holmes
it was birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow
in revenge for you stealing
her signature ren diamond
look at the seating arrangement
it triangulates birdie
just perfectly with that thing
which is loaded with a dummy bolt
aimed directly
at mr bron
now i believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device
but more damning
that is a vintage jayhawk brand crossbow
jayhawk birdie jay
of course there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues
the hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter b
birdies room is the sacral chakra
which is the one blocked by guilt
blah blah blah but the motive yes
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of the face magazine
with birdie on the cover
chuckles she famously wore
what became known as the ren diamond
and thats a family heirloom i believe
well to be clear i mean i didnt know
what a blood diamond was so
mr bron the large pendulous locket
which is has not left your neck
chuckles bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style
would you kindly open it for us
screams
my ren diamond
a dramatic passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista
miss birdie jay
unfortunately this crime clashed
with the presence of benoit blanc
benoit laughs oh
that see that that just went up
very good very good
my god that just felt so good
so solid so satisfying
you know like one of those
minicrosswords the times has
or you know i have a chef friend
and she speaks of trying to create
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bitesized
youre angry
no blanc im uh just you know
what the hell
that was not
the simplest thing to set up so
its fine it doesnt matter its just
i hired gillian flynn
to write the whole thing
oh shes quite good
shes goddamn expensive is what she is
what am i supposed to do now
play yahtzee all weekend just exhales
mr bron truth is
i i ruined your game on purpose
and for a very good reason
im sorry what
i like the glass onion as a metaphor
an object that seems densely layered
but in reality
the center is in plain sight
your relationship with these people
may seem complex
but look what youve done
this weekend is crystal clear
youve taken seven people
each of whom has a reallife reason
to wish you harm
gathered them together on a remote island
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads
its like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights
oh whoa chuckles
come on
so you play hardball with lionel
threaten to destroy his reputation
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with klear
but now with claire too
now perhaps
you threaten to support her opponent
in the upandcoming election
if she does not approve your power plant
you have done some homework
and birdie bangladesh
sweetie pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop
youre making birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor
and duke well chuckles
we all know why duke wants to kill you
he doesnt know about that
yes he does
take my presence as a sign
for at least one person on this island
this is not a game
oh this is the famous napkin
i know this story
right
will you look at that
i sketched out the original idea
for alpha on a cocktail napkin
and i showed it to andi one night
at the glass onion
that was our local bar
thats where it all began
but they tore it down the year after that
benoit mmhmm
sighs andi
yes andi
andi used to tell me the truth
nobody does that now
its all just fake smiles and agendas
and people wanting
what they think theyre owed
hating you when you dont give it to them
because thats what youre there for
i know its probably hard to have sympathy
for the poor tortured billionaire but
god damn i miss that bar
take me home country roads
by toots and the maytals playing
cell phone dings
glass shields thudding

lionel whatd you come for andi
given the circumstances
i think its a fair question

all those years

my life was taken away from me
by someone by everyone in this room

huh
what claires trying to say
is were sorry
we feel bad for you what do you want
are you really asking me that
claire yes what do you want
a check you want performative pity
sighs
just tell us the right words
that we can use
so that we can get on with our lives

you want to slit miles throat
you wanna take us all down
what just drop the bombshell say it
say it
i want the truth

ill be the asshole
sighs
the truth is is that we

and put yourself up on a cross
like some unspeakable crime
has been committed against you

with a box
benoit chuckles oh my
well why dont we start at the beginning
my name is helen brand
and i came all the way here from alabama
well what do you do in alabama
i teach third grade do a lot of zooming
weve been getting into tiedying a lot
and all this pandemic stuff
okay none of that really matters
mr blanc two days ago
i received a call
my twin sister committed suicide
in her car
in her garage
with the engine running
my sister was cassandra brand
do you know who she was
yes of course im sorry you
i thought you looked familiar chuckles
impressive woman your sister
you know she kept a journal
every day of her life
since she was six years old
you know what she called it
notes for future biographers
biographers plural
the girl was six years old
chuckles
then the day after high school
she shot off to new york
and she just never looked back
laughs you know when we were kids
we goofed together
and wed do this character rich bitch
heavens the dog ate the caviar again
chuckles
then i hear her doing a talk
and thats exactly how she sounded
rich bitch and im like
who are you fooling girl not me
she had the guts and brains
for both of us
and i was just happy watching her
you know
so you um you get the call
yeah yeah i get the call and i fly in
this was yesterday
and then i go to andis house
im cleaning it out its a mess
all of her books everywhere
and im just thinking about
what was taken from my sister
how i wasnt there for her
and im getting angrier and angrier
and then i just hear a knock at the door
and its some courier
with this thing from miles bron
and im sure theres
some clever way to open it
i dont know i just open it
and its an invitation
to his private island in greece
for next weekend
one of those little trips shed go on
with him and his group of shitheads
they like to call themselves
the disruptors
but i knew who they were
and i told her who they were shitheads
sighs
miss brand what can i do for you
andi didnt commit suicide
dramatic music plays
helen she didnt leave any note
so i went on her computer
and i looked in her email
her sent messages
to see if she wrote anybody anything
and look she sent this at 400 pm
the day she was murdered four days ago
i finally found it
its right here and im going to use it
to burn his whole empire down
im giving you all one last chance
to make things right
an8you know where to find me a
and im assuming
all of these names here are
birdie jay duke cody
claire debella and lionel toussaint
the shitheads
she sends that email
nobody writes back anything
and then the next day
shes dead in the garage
with sleeping pills in her system
i searched every inch
of every room in her house
and guess what wasnt there
the red envelope
compelling
google said you are
the worlds greatest detective
somebody like me
takes something like this
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers
but if one was to get em alone
isolated for a weekend with
in your words
the worlds greatest detective
you wanna hire me to go to that island
its a stupid idea right
listen i want to be clear huh
i am not batman
i can find you the truth
i can gather evidence
i can present it to the police
and the courts but scoffs
that is where my jurisdiction ends
yeah but its you doing it instead of me
ill take those odds
ive not seen
your sisters death in the news
did you release a statement
helen no
shit was i supposed to
i dont know how this works
and you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and
oh if i pulled a few strings
i could keep it from leaking
to the press for another week
maybe thats
oh
no thats outrageous that wouldnt
well now
wow no that yes miss brand
any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me
when you crossed my threshold
buttress those feelings now
buttress them
i am proposing
that you come with me to that island
as your sister
as cassandra brand
what no
no no no im hiring you to go
i im not are you insane
buttress now yes
a famous detective shows up
and out of the blue
starts poking the subject of your sister
theyll shut up like a clam
your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst
oh no come on man
buttress
yeah im trying real hard to buttress
but this sounds nuts
but it is the only way that this works
look at me
theyll know instantly that im not her
youll cut your hair
youll wear her clothes
oh you really think
i can fit into that shit
and what about my hair
i know a guy
now why would anyone suspect
you showing up playing your sister
when they dont know your sister is dead
helen right
they dont know andi is dead
so why would they suspect anything
and youll do the inspecting
yes i will you just have to be there
mr blanc is is this safe
no no
one person will know the truth about you
from the moment you arrive on that island
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing
and they certainly wouldnt hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks
im im a detective helen
im not a bodyguard
im sorry i cant help you
no
one of those shitheads killed my sister
do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch
suspenseful music playing
music continues
well my goodness
i shouldnt be here this is nuts
but im here so lets do this
drink
you need a drink
oh no i dont drink
ill have some coffee
waiter all right
andis journals
good you keep studying them
okay so tomorrow
ill get there early
really lay on some southern hokum
get them all off guard
on the boat be cold
dont engage in conversation
okay im not great on boats
oh youll be fine
just remember rich bitch voice
andi posture
i have all of her ted talks on this
and ive been studying em
good
in stately tone the dog ate the caviar
there you go
yeah
in southern accent so you said
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive
did you find anything
yes i did
but motives for each of them
to want miles bron dead
now why would they
kill her to protect him
i just dont get it
what about miles what if he just did it
well we cant rule it out
but miles bron is not an idiot
to risk committing murder
after a very public court case
with the possibility
of that email of andis coming to light
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do
especially if someone
was willing to do it for him
come on walk me through these journals
okay
about ten years ago
before they all hit it big
they used to hang together at this bar
benoit and miles was leader of the pack
helen no andi was
they were all friends with andi
birdie was a washedup model
duke was a nerd
doing video game tournaments
claire just lost a race for city council
lionel was a substitute teacher
all of them run aground in their thirties
but andi saw their potentials
she found them all
hi
hey
helen then she found miles
introduced him to the group
this is miles
hey nice to meet you
hey bro
claire i love your hair
helen at first nobody liked him
miles outlive the person
helen hed say stuff like
i want to be responsible for something
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the mona lisa forever
what does that even mean
it just means immortality
he wants to create something
that feels lasting that feels
his first venture was moviefone
for foot massages
did it work
lionel no
okay listen lets just roll with it
lets humor him lets see where it goes
lets see what happens
hey team
helen and things started happening
screams
helen he got birdie a show
for her designs it did well
got lionel published
duke set up at twitch
claire elected locally
at you i love you back
helen you know small stuff
but it happened
an8and then the big thing happened
what is that youre working on
he told me
let the children lose it
let the children use it
let all the children boogie
so based on the napkin idea
andi and miles created alpha
it blows up
they bring everyone along for the ride
miles aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger
cut to two years ago
miles meets
some sketchy norwegian scientist
at an ayahuasca ceremony in peru
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel
hmm
he becomes obsessed
and hes willing to give the companys
entire resources to launch this thing
no
andi andi come on this is it
no no no this is not a startup
this could blow up the world
yeah
no literally miles
this could blow up the world
sighs
the realitydistortion field ends here
i cant let you do this
what what do you mean you cant let me
ill walk
and ill take half the company
to stop you from using it for this
and she did it
and god i love that she did it
then she found out miles
had the lawyers work the contract
so she was cut out the company completely
so she sued over that
her whole case was based on
intellectual ownership
of the companys founding idea
her idea on the napkin
which she didnt keep
miles was very excited he had an idea
uh so he grabbed a napkin
and he uh he scribbled
something on it to show us
thats a lie your honor its a lie
judge order counsel get your client
andi look me in the eye claire
you know its a lie
its a lie
camera shutters clicking
lawyer and do you recall mr cody
who wrote this napkin
yeah miles
uh it was miles
miles
helen this was march
and right after the verdict
miles suddenly found the napkin
written in his handwriting
and did all those interviews about it
benoit a baldfaced fabrication
a damn lie and it worked
dramatic music playing
grunts
so every one of the disruptors
perjured themselves
to destroy andi and shield miles bron
we you and i
we need to find out why motive
whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder
and then this will be tricky
everyones whereabouts
on the night of her death
who could have been
at andis house that night opportunity
our suspects motive opportunity hey
mmhmm
this kinda looks like that clue notepad
yes yes yes
you must be really great at clue huh
im very bad at dumb things
my achilles heel
ticking boxes running around
searching all the rooms
its just a terrible terrible game
well my students love it
im scared
i understand
this is your last chance to back out
dramatic music playing
grunts softly
oh god boats
duke whistles
ballsy move
birdie you shouldnt be here
duke and birdie i think theyre onto me
or they were just being assholes
well thats not mutually exclusive
now look i suspect
when were all settling in
brons going to pull me aside
to explain my presence
that is your chance to snoop
snoop
snoop
suspenseful music playing
snooping snoop
okay here we go
whiskey hey
helen in stately tone hi
andi
yes
im whiskey we didnt really meet

thats a beautiful necklace
youre a taurus
yeah um miles got it for me
he um surprised me for my birthday
he filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses
it was very cute
hes a really good guy hes complicated
but
i think its really shitty
what they all did to you
and how they all treated you
i read your court transcripts
and you got shanked
thanks whiskey
yeah this is my second one
of these things
we did a yacht thing last year
well that sounds fun
laughs no
i mean when theyre all together
its kind of the worst
duke just treats me like arm candy
and they just ignore me
why do you put up with it
with duke
im building my brand and hes putting me
on his channel more often
though hes leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff
if im going to go
into politics eventually
i dont think
thats a road i wanna go down
its expeditious
but its kind of a shitshow
oh heres the pool
im gonna walk around a little longer
ill catch you over there
okay
hey its really great
talking to you whiskey

male voice over speakers dong
gong reverberating
gunshot

grunts
i did it two weeks ago i did it
you signed off on the power plant
yep when this thing breaks poof
my whole base is gone
the grassroots lefties gone
i did it too
did what
i signed off on putting klear
in a manned mission
the staff doesnt know it yet
claire oh god damn it
lets just pray that
andi was wrong about this klear stuff
no she was right
you put its gas form
into household piping
theres massive leakage into the air
the hydrogen particles are too small
hydrogen gas
lionel i sold my soul for this
youre telling me that it could literally
turn peoples homes into the hindenburg
i will take care of him dont worry
there was a time you know back when
i was the one on magazines he was nobody
he was this little thing in my hand
i preferred that
andi hi
wow no
chuckles youre really good at this
this is interesting stuff about whiskey
and motives for both lionel and claire
well done
those were motives
because i was kind of confused
oh no they bet the farm
and will both be ruined
along with miles if he fails
they need to protect him at all costs
but i cant imagine them killing her
i just cant
think of the crime the nature of it
no theyve come to apologize
to make amends
and the murder itself its nonviolent
gentle even
they dont even see her die
engine starts
benoit she just goes to sleep
no no
theyre all more than capable
helen gulping
whoa whoa whoa
i thought you said you didnt drink
oh this this isnt a drink
this is some funky health stuff
no you give me that
thats hard kombucha
thats jared letos hard kombucha
what is it that thats 9 alcohol or so
get off that
how many of these things you had
i dont know but i feel fine
okay we need to focus
we need to focus we need
to find the os the opportunities
we got to open them up its time to push
no no no
were not pushing anything right now
listen i feel good
i think maybe you should lie down
were running out of time blanc
helen
softly helen
please
think of the danger here
you gotta step back
and let me handle this
push nothing
miles theyre gonna tell you to stop
even your partner will say
you need to stop
because as it turns out
nobody wants you to break
the system itself
but that is what true disruption is
and that is what unites all of us
we all got to that line and crossed it
claire andi
wait wait
wait no you wait
that day in court
you couldnt even look me in the eye
what are you doing
you want to talk about the email
oh
so now you want to talk about the email
you didnt even write back
im a politician
i never email anything
that i wouldnt want to see
on the front page of the times
thats why i called
scoffs
we all did
right after we got it over and over

and when we couldnt reach you
i went to your house

what is this
its my secret phone
what is this
an email from the sweetie pants contractor
two years ago
miss jay im writing to inform you
that the proposed bangladesh factory
is notoriously one of the worlds
biggest sweatshops
please advise
and then you replied
sounds perfect thanks
with your memoji dabbing
birdie
please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make
sweatpants
oh my god
sighs miles is going to pay me off
he said if i take full responsibility
for the sweatshops
hell pay me the value of my shares
thirty million
i will do whatever i have to do
to save myself
and he is my only lifeline
can i have my secret phone back
peg no
this never happens in clue
thats because its a terrible game
they all had a motive to protect miles
they were all there that night
so what now detective
the envelope
whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect miles
and they wouldnt just destroy it
they would want him to see
what theyd done for him
they brought it here its here
so how are we supposed to find it
well unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner
they wont have an envelope
that size on their person
theyll have to hide it in their room
so at dinner tonight
andi im hoping its still whiskey soda
benoit you need to keep your head clear
and stay sharp
because you have to find a way
helen i want the truth
thuds
i can give you that
benoit a way that is
so painfully uncomfortable
that nobody will question it
or follow you
pick a fight and lose
im tired of pretending
benoit we have to find that envelope
youre the loser thats the truth
duke grunts
there she is theres the andi i know
cell phone dings
thuds
in southern accent hes a son
of a bitch whiskey leave his ass
dramatic music playing
benoit search their rooms
ransack them fast and thorough
dont worry about being neat
cell phone buzzing
grunts
gasps
cool change
by little river band playing
hey

cell phone buzzing
damn it
what the hell
oh shit oh shit
dramatic music playing
whiskey screams

dramatic music playing
panting
andi
benoit andi
blanc
blanc where are you where are you

did you take dukes gun
why would i take dukes gun
and why are the lights out
duke is dead
what
no time did you find the envelope
no i searched every room its not there
oh ive been a fool
theres one more room to search
they already gave it to miles
its in the glass onion
if i can distract everyone
and you can get up there and find it
no but that doesnt tell us
who gave it to him
blanc i dont understand
please trust me its all in plain sight
we only need one last piece
of information but only you can
gunshot
harpsichord music playing
whimpers
gasps
panting
son of a bitch
blanc go chase him
what are you doing
dont let him get away
the killer thinks youre dead
this is our cover
i can buy you maybe five minutes alone
in the glass onion but you have to
give me that
you have to find that envelope
i will
thats it
oh no give me that give me that
thisll be good
clears throat
oh oh oh
shitballs
blanc
yes
systems powering up
claire oh god
birdie screams whimpers
miles god andi
benoit everyone inside right now
claire shouldnt we
benoit shes not going anywhere
helen grunts softly
benoit inside
helen whimpering softly
benoit its time to finish this
helen straining
gasps blowing nose
shitballs
miles it makes no sense
benoit this makes perfect sense
duke andi this weekend
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island
will you explain it
to us all then detective
no i can peel back the layers
i can take it to a point
but what lies at the center
only one person can tell us
who killed cassandra brand
who
well i keep returning
in my mind to the glass onion
something that seems densely layered
mysterious and inscrutable
but in fact the center is in plain sight
where where
and that is why
this case has confounded me like no other
why every complex layer
peeled back has revealed
another layer and another layer
and come to naught
and that was the problem right there
you see i expected complexity
i expected intelligence
i expected a puzzle a game
but thats not what any of this is
it hides not behind complexity
but behind mindnumbing obvious clarity
truth is it doesnt hide at all
i was staring right at it
soaring dramatic music plays
the killer nearly struck
my achilles heel
but thank high heaven at the last moment
i realized what had teased my brain
through this entire case
inbreathiate
its not a word
what
can we just take a second
and fully inbreathiate this moment
its not a real word
it kind of sounds like one
but its just entirely made up
now reclamation
now well that
that is a word but its the wrong word
this place is the full reclamation
of everything ive achieved up to now
this entire day
the predefinite detective
a veritable minefield of malapropisms
the infraction point
and factual errors
bask in the sun swim in the ionian sea
that is the aegean sea
oh yeah it is it is
his dock doesnt float
his wonderfuel is a disaster
his grasp of disruption theory
is remedial at best
he didnt design the puzzle boxes
he didnt write the mystery
et voilà it all adds up
the key to this entire case
and it was staring me right in the face
like everyone in the world
i assumed miles bron was
a complicated genius
but why
look into the clear center
of this glass onion
miles bron is an idiot
oh please
just tell us who tried to kill me
nobody tried to kill you
you vainglorious buffoon
duke took my glass
thats what you told us he did
he mustve picked it up by mistake
you told us right after it happened
look at that dress spin
birdie do that again watch this
and after you said those words
thats what we all remember seeing
but think
ignore his lies everyone
and think clearly now
what did we all actually see
wow look at that dress spin
birdie thats amazing
just
gasps
benoit you handed duke your own glass
clear as crystal
right in front of our eyes
all of us
and then told a baldfaced fabrication
and it worked
blanc are you telling us
miles killed duke
yes
why
because the night
andi sent you all the emails
when duke got to andis house
early on his motorcycle
engine revving
benoit he saw miles leaving
tires screeching
benoit was almost struck by him
in fact he told all of us
right out in the open he told us
iconic
remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of andis
anderson coopers birthday mmhmm
that night at andis
that night duke told us
he almost got in an accident
he pancaked
yeah but miles had been living in greece
the past six months
no whiskey
miles saw you
on your birthday in new york
gave you that necklace for your birthday
and youre a taurus
i am
two weeks ago
benoit forget the hydrofuels
may 9th
and the sweatshops
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments
sorry what
and focus
on the envelope
screams
gasps holy shit
what is reality
andi
benoit who did the envelope threaten
miles bron
that night lionel faxed andis email
to miles who received it in new york
the one thing that could destroy
his empire of lies
the truth in the hands
of the only person unafraid to tell it
so miles drives his baby blue porsche
to the scene of the crime
and andi lets him in
of course she did
miles machine of lawyers and power
could destroy her
through sheer dumb force
but miles himself
oh she was clever enough
not to fear miles
but she didnt see the real threat
the obvious threat until it was too late
duke alone knew you were there that night
but he didnt know andi was dead
no no he didnt know that
until this evening
right here
when he got a google alert on his phone
which has now fallen strangely silent
and which he showed to you
gasps
because you dont own a phone
duke no
did he really think
he could stop all of them
from finding out about andis death
they all have phones
wheres my phone
birdie peggy
phone
still no
benoit he didnt need to hide the death
he just needed to hide
that duke had shown him the death
moments before he was killed
right out in the open duke showed him
duke that changes things right
it sure does
and told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence
numbers like this
maybe we can talk alpha news
you bet your ass come here
so what does miles do
does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something
is that a rich person thing
no no no no its just
its so much stupider than that
birdie what are the ingredients
to your cuban breeze
um vodka amaretto
oh god
birdie and pineapple juice
no pineapple in that right
duke dont dance with pineapple
an allergy
he cant even have a drop
pineapple juice
he just put
pineapple juice in his whiskey
its so dumb
oh its so dumb its brilliant
no its just dumb
died of an apparent suicide
she is survived by her sister helen
helen
you told me about helen your sister
gasps oh wait
helen brand ladies and gentlemen
and now we come
to helens attempted murder
which i have to give you credit for
did have a sound foundation of thought
you realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you
you have a house on a remote island
filled with desperate people
all of whom have a reallife reason
to wish this woman harm you
furthermore you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach
and the lights had even been turned off
youve taken seven people
each of whom has a reallife reason
to wish you harm
gathered them together on a remote island
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads
its like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights
heavens to
you dimwitted brainless
jackass
your one murder with any panache at all
and you stole the whole idea from me
dramatic music playing
gunshot
and after all that you
you still kept the envelope
you didnt burn it or anything
you recognize this
andis handwriting
i got you son of a bitch
oh lets slow down there sister okay
because first how could you
ever prove that thats the original
she might have copied mine
no
the bar closed nine years ago
and hers has one thing
that yours just doesnt
okay but second
thuds
what the hell did he do
he just burned it
miles burned what
i didnt see anything
helen you burned it
is someone making toast
this will not stand
uhhuh well did you see this proof
this smoking napkin blanc
no did anybody
okay then wow
wow we got some big accusations
flying around here
except everybody seems to have
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw
and theres nothing
but totally circumspective evidence
sighs
so if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game
which we should have been doing
all weekend
then blanc wins an ipad pro this time
but this is the real world
and in the real world you need
more than a neat little detective story
you need evidence
and youve got nothing
do you
hes right
the contents of that envelope
and his possession of it
were our only physical evidence
right
wanna take that to the cops
you wanna take it to the courts
chuckles
look you pick your poison
anywhere you go
its going to be your word against mine
how do you think thats gonna go
i think its gonna go
about like it went for andi
jesus
and i do want to say
your sister was a complicated woman
but she meant the world to me
and im so sorry for your loss
nobodys stepping up
raise your hand
and say i saw him take dukes gun
i saw him that night at andis house
i saw the napkin before he burned it
we didnt
we we didnt
you would lie for a lie
but you wont lie for the truth
youre still holding on to his titties
you shitheads
blanc
i need you to do something
im sorry helen
i gave you the truth
this is where my jurisdiction ends
i have to answer to the police
the courts the system
theres nothing i can do
except maybe
offer you some courage
and a reminder of why your sister
walked away in the first place
