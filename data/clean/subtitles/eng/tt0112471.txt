yeah 
no  i m sorry 
my german is not very good 
have you heard that
as couples age   
   they lose their ability
to hear each other 
no 
supposedly  men lose their ability
to hear high pitched sounds   
   and women lose hearing
in the low end 
i guess they nullify each other 
i guess  nature s way of allowing
couples to grow old together   
   without killing each other 
what are you reading 
oh  yeah 
how about you 
i was thinking about going
to the lounge car 
 would you like to come with me 
 yeah 
okay 
how do you speak such good english 
i went to school for a summer
in los angeles 
 it s fine here 
 yeah  this is good 
and i spent some time in london 
 wow 
 how do you speak such good english 
me  i m american 
 you re american  are you sure 
 yeah 
no  i m joking 
i knew you were american 
and you don t speak
any other language  right 
yeah  yeah 
i get it  i get it 
i m the crude  dumb 
vulgar american   
   who doesn t speak other languages 
who has no culture  but i tried 
i took french in high school 
when i first got to paris   
   i stood in line
at the metro station 
i was practicing 
whatever 
and i get up there 
and i look at this woman   
   and my mind goes blank  and i say 
 l need a ticket to get to     
so anyway    
so where are you headed 
well  back to paris 
 my classes start next week 
 you re still in school  where 
la sorbonne  you know 
sure 
you re coming from budapest 
 i was visiting my grandmother 
 oh  how is she 
she s okay 
 she s all right 
 she s fine 
 how about you  where are you going 
 i m going to vienna 
vienna 
what s there 
no idea 
i m flying out of there tomorrow 
you re on holiday 
i don t really know what i m on 
you know 
i ve just been traveling around 
riding trains for two or three weeks 
you were visiting friends
or just on your own 
i had a friend in madrid  but    
 madrid  that s nice 
 i got a eurail pass   
   is what i did 
that s great 
so has this trip around europe
been good for you 
yeah  sure  it s been    
it sucked 
what 
it s had its    
i ll tell you  sitting for weeks on end
looking out the window   
   has actually been kind of great 
what do you mean 
well  you know  for instance   
   you have ideas that you
ordinarily wouldn t have 
 what kind of ideas 
 want to hear one 
 tell me 
 all right 
i have this idea  okay 
for a television show 
some friends of mine
are cable access producers 
do you know what that is 
anybody can produce a show real cheap 
and they have to put it on 
i have this idea for a show that lasts
24 hours a day for a year straight 
what you do is you get   
   365 people from cities
all over the world   
   to do these 24 hour documents
of real time 
capturing life as it s lived 
you know  it would start with a guy
waking up in the morning   
   and taking the long shower   
   eating a little breakfast 
making a little coffee   
   reading the paper    
wait  all those mundane 
boring things   
   everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life 
i was going to say 
 the poetry of day to day life  
you say it your way 
i ll say it my way 
 think of it like this  
 who s gonna watch 
think about it like this  why is it
that a dog sleeping in the sun   
   is so beautiful 
it is  it s beautiful 
but a guy taking money
from a bank machine   
   iooks like a complete moron 
so it s like a national geographic
program  but on people 
yeah 
what do you think 
yeah  i can see it 
like  24 boring hours   sorry  
   and a three minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after 
yeah  and that would
be a great episode 
people would talk about that episode 
you and your friends could
do one in paris if you wanted 
i don t know  the key  the thing
that haunts me is the distribution 
getting these tapes from town to town
so it would play continuously 
because it would have to play all
the time  or it just wouldn t work 
thank you 
thanks 
you know what 
not service oriented 
just an observation about europe 
my parents never really
spoke of the possibility   
   of my falling in love or
getting married or having children 
even as a little girl   
   they wanted me to think as
a future career as a  you know   
   interior designer or lawyer
or something like that 
i d say to my dad 
 l want to be a writer  
and he d say   journalist  
i d say i wanted to have a refuge for
stray cats  he d say   veterinarian  
i d say i wanted to be an actress 
he d say   tv newscaster  
it was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition into these   
   practical moneymaking ventures 
i had a good bullshit detector
when i was a kid 
i always knew
when they were lying to me 
by high school  i was dead set   
   on listening to what everybody
thought i should do with my life   
   and doing the opposite 
nobody was ever mean about it 
i just could never get very excited   
   about other people s ambitions
for my life 
but you know what 
if your parents never   
   fully contradict you about anything
and are nice and supportive   
right 
   it makes it even harder
to officially complain 
even when they re wrong 
it s this passive aggressive shit 
you know what i mean 
i hate it 
i really hate it 
well  you know  despite all that
kind of bullshit   
   that comes along with it   
   i remember childhood as   
   this magical time 
i do  i remember when my mother
first told me about death 
my great grandmother had died  and my
family had visited them in florida 
i was about 3  3 1 2 years old 
anyway  i was in
the back yard playing   
   and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose   
   and do it in such a way that   
   it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow 
and so i was doing that   
   and through the mist 
i could see my grandmother 
and she was just standing there 
smiling at me 
and i held it there for a long time   
   and i looked at her 
and then finally  i let go
of the nozzle  you know 
and then i dropped the hose   
   and she disappeared 
and so i run back inside
and tell my parents 
and they sit me down
and give me this big rap on how   
   when people die  you never see
them again  and how i d imagined it 
but i knew what i d seen 
i was glad i saw that 
i ve never seen anything
like that since  but i don t know 
it just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was 
even death 
you re lucky you can have
this attitude toward death 
i think i m afraid of death
24 hours a day 
i swear  i mean  that s why
i m in a train right now 
i could ve flown to paris 
but i m scared 
 oh  come on 
 i can t help it 
i know the statistics say 
 na  na  na  it s safer   whatever 
when i m in a plane 
i can see the explosion 
i can see me falling
through the clouds 
and i m so scared of those
few seconds of consciousness   
   before you die 
when you know you re gonna die 
i can t stop thinking that way 
it s exhausting 
yeah  i bet 
really exhausting 
 i think this is vienna 
 yeah 
 you get off here  no 
 yeah  what a drag 
i wish i d met you earlier 
i really like talking to you 
yeah  me too 
it was really nice of you too 
i have an admittedly insane idea 
but if i don t ask you this   
   it ll haunt me the rest of my life 
what 
i want to keep talking to you 
i have no idea what your situation is   
   but i feel like we have
some kind of   
   connection  right 
yeah  me too 
right  great 
here s the deal 
get off here in vienna
and come check out the town 
 what 
 come on  it ll be fun 
 come on 
 what would we do 
i don t know  all i know is i catch
a flight tomorrow morning at 9 30   
   and i can t afford a hotel 
so i was going to walk around   
   and it d be more fun
if you came with me 
and if i turn out to be a psycho 
just get on the next train 
all right  all right 
think of it like this 
jump ahead 10  20 years  okay 
and you re married 
only your marriage doesn t have
that same energy it used to have 
you start to blame your husband 
you think about all those guys
you ve met in your life   
   and what might ve happened
if you d picked up with one of them 
i m one of those guys 
that s me 
so think of this as time travel   
   from then to now to find out
what you re missing out on 
what this could be is
a gigantic favor   
   to you and your husband to find out
you re not missing anything 
i m just as big a loser as he is 
unmotivated  boring 
you made the right choice 
you re happy 
let me get my bag 
we should get a locker for all this 
what s your name 
my name 
jesse  james  actually 
but everybody calls me jesse 
you mean  jesse james  no 
no  no  just jesse 
i m celine 
this is a nice bridge 
yeah 
this is kind of weird 
isn t it  i mean 
i feel a little awkward 
 but it s all right  right 
 yeah  this is great 
 let s go to some places 
 yeah  let s go to some places 
 let s ask these guys 
 okay 
excuse me  excuse me 
sprechen sie english 
 ja  of course 
 do you speak german for a change 
 what 
 no  it was a joke 
we just got into vienna today  and
we re looking for something fun to do 
like museums  exhibitions    
but museums are not that
funny anymore these days 
they are closing right now 
how long are you going to be here 
just for tonight 
why did you come to vienna 
what could you be expecting 
we re on honeymoon 
yeah  she got pregnant 
we had to get married    
i don t believe you 
you re a bad liar 
this is a play we re both in 
we would like to invite you 
you re actors 
not professional 
part time for fun 
it s a play about a cow and
lndians searching for it 
there are also
politicians  mexicans  
russians  communists    
 you have a real cow on stage 
 no  an actor in a cow costume 
 he s the cow 
 yes  i am the cow 
 and the cow s a bit weird 
 the cow has a disease 
she s acting a bit strange 
like a dog 
if someone throws a stick 
she fetches it 
and she can smoke with hoofs
and everything 
 great 
 as you see  there is the address 
it s in the second district 
near the prater  you know it 
the big ferris wheel 
we should go  we should 
perhaps you can go to the prater
before the play 
it starts at 2130 
 2130 
 it s at 9 30 
 9 30 
 oh  right 
what s the name of this play 
it translates as  bring me the horns
of wilmington s cow  
i m wilmington s cow 
 all right 
 great 
 you ll be there 
 we ll try 
i m the cow 
goodbye 
i got an idea  are you ready 
it s q and a time 
we ve known each other a little while 
we re stuck together  so we ll ask
each other a few direct questions 
all right 
 we ask each other questions 
 and you have to answer honestly 
 of course 
 okay 
all right  first question 
 you 
 yes  i am going to ask you 
describe for me your
first sexual feelings   
   towards a person 
my first sexual feelings 
oh  my god 
i know  i know 
jean marc fleury 
jean marc fleury 
we were at this summer camp together 
and he was a swimmer 
he had bleached out
chlorine hair and green eyes   
   and to improve his times 
he d shave his legs and arms 
 that s disgusting 
 he was like this gorgeous dolphin 
my friend emma
had a big crush on him 
so one day  i was cutting across
the field back to my room   
   and he came walking up beside me 
i told him   
    you should date emma 
she has a big crush on you  
and he turned to me and said   
    well  that s too bad  because
i have a big crush on you  
so  yeah  it really scared
the hell out of me   
   because i thought he was so fine 
then he officially asked me on a date 
i pretended i didn t like him 
you know  i was so afraid of
what i might do  you know 
so i went to see him swim
a few times at the competition 
and he was so sexy  really 
i mean  really sexy 
we wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer   
   and  you know  promised we would
keep writing forever   
   and meet again very soon and  
did you 
of course not 
then this is the opportune time
to tell you i m a fantastic swimmer 
 really 
 yeah 
 i make note of that 
 okay 
 so it s my turn  no 
 yes  your turn 
hit me 
have you ever been in love 
yes 
next question 
 what was the  
 wait a minute 
 so i can give one word answers 
 why not 
after i went into detail
about my sexual feelings 
they re different questions  i could
answer the sexual feelings thing 
but  you know  love   i mean 
what if i asked you about love 
i would have lied  but at least
i would have made up a great story 
love is a complex issue  you know 
i mean  yes  i ve told somebody
that i love them  and i ve meant it 
but was it totally unselfish 
giving love 
was it a beautiful thing 
not really 
you know  it s like  love    
i mean  i don t know 
you know 
 yeah  i know what you mean 
 but as far as sexual feelings go   
   it started with
an obsessive relationship   
   with miss july  1978 
do you know playboy magazine 
 i ve heard of it 
 you know crystal 
you don t know crystal 
well  i knew crystal 
is it my turn now 
tell me something that
really pisses you off 
 really drives you crazy 
 pisses me off 
 god  everything pisses me off 
 list a couple 
oh  i know  i hate being told
by strange men   
   strange men in the street   
   you know  to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life 
what else 
i hate    
i hate that 300 kilometers from here 
there s a war   
   people are dying 
and nobody knows what to do 
or they don t give a shit 
i don t know 
i hate that the media s
trying to control our minds 
 the media 
 yeah  the media 
it s very subtle  but it s
a new form of fascism  really 
i hate    
i hate when i m in a foreign country 
especially in america   
   each time i wear black or lose my
temper or say anything about anything   
   they always go 
 oh  it s so french  it s so cute  
i hate that 
i can t stand that  really 
is that all 
well  there s a lot of things  but    
 so it s my turn 
 okay 
 you re gonna answer 
 yes  i ll answer 
what s a problem for you 
you  probably 
what 
i had a thought the other day
that kind of   
   qualifies as a problem 
what is it 
it was a thought i had
on the train  so    
okay  all right 
do you believe in reincarnation 
yeah  yeah  it s interesting 
a lot of people talk about past
lives and things like that  you know 
and even if they don t believe in it
in some specific way   
   people have a notion
of an eternal soul 
 yeah 
 okay 
this is my thought 
50 000 years ago   
   there s not even a million people 
ten thousand years ago 
there s  like  two million people 
now there s between five and six
billion people on the planet 
if we all have our own   
   individual  unique   
   soul   
   where did they all come from 
are modern souls only
a fraction of the original souls 
if they are  that represents
a 5000 to 1 split of each soul   
   in the last 50 000 years  which is
a blip in the earth s time 
so at best  we re these
tiny fractions   
   of people walking  
is that why we re so scattered 
is that why we re so specialized 
wait a minute  i m not sure  
yeah  i know  i know 
it s a totally scattered thought 
which is kind of why it makes sense 
i agree with you 
let s get off this damn train 
this place is pretty neat 
yeah 
there s even a listening booth 
have you heard of this singer 
i think she s american 
a friend told me about her 
do you want to go see if that
listening booth still works 
yeah  okay 
there s a wind that
blows in from the north
and it says that loving
takes this course
come here
come here
no  i m not impossible to touch
i have never wanted you so much
come here
come here
have i never laid down by your side
baby  let s forget about this pride
come here
come here
look at this  this is beautiful 
quick  it s leaving 
look  there s a rabbit 
yeah 
hey there  rabbit 
it s so cute 
i visited this as a young teenager 
it left a bigger impression on me
at that time than the museums 
yeah  it s tiny 
i know 
a little old man talked to us 
he was the groundskeeper 
he explained that most
of the people buried here   
   had washed up on the bank
of the danube 
how old are these 
around the beginning of the century 
it s called no name cemetery   
   because they often didn t know
who those people were 
maybe a first name  that s all 
why were all the bodies washing up 
i think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that 
but most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river 
i always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world 
when i was a little girl 
i thought   
   if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead   
   then it s like
not really being dead 
people can invent the best
and the worst for you 
here she is  i think 
yeah  this is the one
i remember the most 
she was only 13 when she died 
that meant something to me 
i was that age when i first saw this 
now i m 10 years older 
and she s still 13  i guess 
that s funny 
that s the danube over there 
that s a river  right 
yeah 
this is   
   gorgeous 
yeah  this is beautiful 
i mean  we got    
we got a sunset here 
 yeah 
 we got the ferris wheel 
it seems like   
   this would be a    
what 
you know    
are you trying to say
you want to kiss me 
but you know what 
it doesn t matter what
generation you re born into 
look at my parents 
they were angry  young may  68 people
revolting against everything 
the government  their conservative
catholic backgrounds    
then i was born  and my father
became a successful architect 
we traveled around the world
while he built bridges   
   and  you know  towers and stuff 
i mean  i really can t
complain about anything 
they love me more than anything   
   and i ve been raised with all
the freedom they fought for 
and yet  for me now 
it s another type of fight 
we have to deal with the same shit 
but we can t really know   
   who or  you know  what the enemy is 
i don t know if
there really is an enemy 
everybody s parents fucked them up 
rich kids  parents gave them too much 
poor kids   not enough 
too much attention 
not enough attention 
they either left or
taught them the wrong things 
my parents are just two people
who didn t like each other much   
   who got married and had a kid 
and they tried their best
to be nice to me 
 did your parents divorce 
 yeah  finally 
they should have done it sooner 
they stuck together   
   for the well being of my sister
and l  thank you very much 
i remember my mother told me
right in front of my father   
   that he didn t really
want to have me 
that he was pissed off when
he found out she was pregnant 
that i was a big mistake 
that really shaped the way i think 
i always saw the world as this place
where i really wasn t meant to be 
that s so sad 
well  i mean  i eventually
kind of took pride in it 
you know  like my life
was my own doing 
you know  like i was
crashing the big party 
that s the way to see it 
my parents are still married
and i guess they re happy 
but i think it s healthy to rebel
against everything that came before 
you know  i ve been wondering lately   
   do you know anyone
who s in a happy relationship 
yeah  sure  you know 
i know happy couples 
but i think they lie to each other 
yeah 
people can live their
whole life as a lie 
my grandmother was married   
   and i thought she had an
uncomplicated love life 
but she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life   
   dreaming about another man
she was in love with 
she just accepted her fate 
it s so sad 
in the same time  i love that
she had these emotions   
   and feelings i never
thought she had 
i guarantee you
it was better that way 
if she d known him  he d have
disappointed her eventually 
 how do you know 
 i know  i know 
people put romantic projections
on everything 
it s not based in any kind of reality 
romantic projections 
oh  mr  romantic up in the ferris wheel 
 oh  kiss me  the sunset 
oh  it s so beautiful  
tell me about your grandmother 
what were you saying about her 
check these guys out 
 hans  i have a confession  i m not
wearing underwear underneath this  
 oh  really  does that frighten you   
can i tell you a secret 
yeah 
come here 
 what 
 come here 
look at this palm reader 
she s interesting looking 
yeah 
 uh oh  uh oh 
 what 
 i made eye contact 
 she s not coming over here 
 yes  she is 
 oh  shit 
oh  no 
 you want your palm read 
 no 
 are you sure 
 i m sure 
 okay 
 hello 
oh  here she is 
i want your palm read 
yeah  how much is it 
for you  50 
okay 
okay 
so you have been on a journey   
   and you re a stranger
to this place 
you are   
   an adventurer 
a seeker 
an adventurer in your mind 
you are interested
in the power of the woman 
in the woman s deep strength
and creativity 
you re becoming this woman 
you need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life 
only if you find peace
within yourself   
   will you find
true connection with others 
that is a stranger to you 
i guess so 
you will be all right 
he s learning 
okay 
money 
you re both stars 
don t forget 
when the stars exploded
billions of years ago   
   they formed everything
that is this world 
everything we know is stardust 
so don t forget  you are stardust 
that s very nice and all 
i mean  that we re all stardust   
   and you re becoming this great woman 
but i hope you don t take that
any more seriously   
   than some horoscope
in a newspaper 
what  she knew i was on vacation
and that we didn t know each other   
   and that i was going
to become this great woman 
but what was that
 l am learning  bullshit 
that s way condescending  you know 
i mean  she wasn t even doing me 
i mean  if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth   
   it would put them
out of business 
just once  i d love to see some
little old lady save up all her money   
   to go to the fortuneteller  she d
get there and the woman would say   
    tomorrow and all
your remaining days   
   will be exactly like today   
   a tedious collection of hours 
and you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts   
   and no new travels 
and when you die 
you ll be completely forgotten 
fifty schillings  please  
that i d like to see 
it s so funny how   
   she almost didn t notice you 
it s weird  i wonder why 
she was really wise and intense 
i really loved what she said 
you pay your money to hear what
makes you feel good about yourself 
maybe there s a seedy section of vienna 
we can buy a hit of crack 
would you like that 
you re so    
stardust  stardust 
there s an exhibition 
i guess we ll miss it 
it doesn t start until next week 
yeah  i think so 
i actually saw this one in a museum 
i stared and stared at it 
must have been 45 minutes 
i love it 
la voie ferrée 
it s great 
i love the way the people are
dissolving into the background 
look at this 
it s like the environments   
   are stronger than the people 
his human figures are
always so transitory 
it s funny  transitory 
transitory 
 you think this is open 
 i don t know  let s try it 
i was in an old church like this   
   with my grandmother
a few days ago in budapest 
even though i reject
most of the religious thing   
   i can t help but feeling for
those people that come here   
   iost or in pain  guilt   
   iooking for some kind of answers 
it fascinates me how a single place
can join pain and happiness   
   of so many generations 
you re close with your grandmother 
yeah 
i think it s because i always
have this strange feeling   
   that i m this very old woman
laying down  about to die 
you know  that my life is just   
   her memories or something 
that s so wild 
i always think that i m still
this 13 year old boy   
   who doesn t really know how
to be an adult  pretending to   
   iive my life  taking notes for when
i ll really have to do it 
like i m in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play 
that s funny 
then up there in the ferris wheel 
it was like   
   this very old woman
kissing this very young boy  right 
do you know anything about
the quakers  the quaker religion 
no  not much 
well  i went to
this quaker wedding once   
   and it was fantastic 
what they do is   
   the couple comes in and they kneel
in front of the whole congregation   
   and they stare at each other 
nobody says a word unless they feel
that god moves them to speak   
   or say something 
and then  after an hour or so of just   
   staring at each other   
   they re married 
that s beautiful  i like that 
this is a horrible story 
what 
it s not the appropriate place
to tell it 
well  i was driving around
with this buddy of mine 
he s a big atheist  you know 
and he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy 
my buddy takes out a   100 bill   
   and leans out the window   
   and he says 
 do you believe in god   
and the guy looks at my friend 
he looks at the money 
he says   
    yes  i do  
my friend says   wrong answer  
we drove away 
that s mean 
would you be in paris by now
if you hadn t gotten off the train 
no  not yet 
what would you be doing 
i d probably be hanging around
the airport   
   crying in my coffee
because you didn t come with me 
i d probably gotten off the train
in salzburg with someone else 
oh  yeah  oh  i see 
so i m just a dumb american   
   momentarily decorating
your blank canvas  huh 
 i m having a great time 
 really 
me too 
i m glad  because
no one knows i m here 
i don t know anyone
that would tell me   
   all those bad things you ve done 
 i ll tell you some 
 yeah  i m sure 
you hear so much shit about people 
i always feel like   
   the general of an army
when i start dating 
plotting my strategy
and maneuverings   
   knowing his weak points 
what would hurt him  seduce him 
it s horrible 
if we were always around each other   
   what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad 
no  i m not going to
answer this question 
i dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that 
 what about me bugs you   
finally i said   l don t think
you handle criticism too well  
she flew into a rage and
broke up with me  that s true 
all she wanted was
to have an excuse   
   to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me 
is that what you want 
something about me bugs you 
 what is it about me bugs you 
 nothing at all 
if it had to be something 
what would it be 
if it had to be something 
if i had to think about it   
   i kind of didn t really like this
reaction at the palm reader 
you were like this rooster prick 
what the hell
is a rooster prick 
you were like a boy whining   
   because all the attention
wasn t focused on him 
all right  listen 
this woman robs you blind  okay 
you were like a boy
walking by an ice cream store   
   crying because his mom
won t buy him a milk shake 
i don t care what this charlatan
has to say about  
what 
i understand a little 
but he doesn t at all 
may i ask you a question 
so i would like to
make a deal with you 
i mean  instead of just asking you
for money  i will ask you for a word 
you give me a word  i take the word 
and then i will write a poem   
   with the word inside 
and if you like it 
if you like my poem   
   if it adds something to
your life in any way   
   then you can pay me
whatever you feel like 
i ll write in english  of course 
 okay 
 all right  great 
so 
pick a word 
a word 
 milk shake 
 milk shake  oh  good 
i was gonna say  rooster prick  
but great  milk shake 
 milk shake  
okay  milk shake 
 all right  so    
 good 
i gotta say  i like this
viennese variation of bum 
i like what he said about
adding something to your life 
so  were we having
our first fight back there 
i think so  i think we were 
even if we were  why does everyone
think conflict is so bad 
there s a lot of good things
coming out of conflict 
yeah  i guess so 
i always think if i could
just accept the fact   
   that my life was supposed to be
difficult  that s what s expected   
   then i might not get so pissed off 
and i d just be glad
when something nice happens 
that s why i m still in school 
it s easier to have
something to fight against 
well  we ve all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us 
you know  i can be doing
the most nothing thing 
throwing some darts
or shooting some pool 
then all of a sudden 
i feel it come over me 
i have got to win 
is that why you tried to get me
off the train  competitiveness 
what do you mean 
i got a poem 
oh  all right 
will you read it to us 
sure  okay 
 daydream delusion
limousine eyelash
oh  baby  with your pretty face
drop a tear in my wine glass
look at those big eyes
see what you mean to me
sweetcakes and milk shakes
i am a delusion angel
i m a fantasy parade
i want you to know what i think
don t want you to guess anymore
you have no idea where i came from
we have no idea where we re going
lodged in life
like branches in the river
flowing downstream
caught in the current
i carry you
you ll carry me
that s how it could be
don t you know me 
don t you know me by now   
great 
 thanks 
 thanks  man 
here you go 
 thanks 
 all right 
 here  thank you 
 thank you 
good luck 
it was wonderful  no 
 what 
 he probably didn t just write that 
he wrote it  but he
probably plugs that word in 
you know  whatever   milk shake  
what do you mean 
nothing  i loved it  it was great 
you know what drives me crazy 
people talking about   
   how great technology is 
how it saves all this time 
but what good is saved time
if nobody uses it 
if it just turns into more busy work 
i never hear anybody say   with the time
i ve saved using my word processor   
   i m gonna go to a zen monastery
and hang out  
 you don t hear that 
 time is so abstract anyway 
 are you looking at this girl 
 what 
nothing 
you wanna go in here 
 you wanna go in here 
 yeah  it s a club  no 
wanna go 
hello 
fifty schillings 
 each 
 i got 100  here  i got it 
i ll buy you a beer  thank you 
 you gonna buy me a beer 
 yeah 
you think old milwaukee
is expensive here 
we haven t talked about this yet 
but are you dating anyone 
you got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in paris or anything like that 
 no  not right now 
 but you did 
we broke up six months ago 
six months ago  oh  i m sorry 
i mean  i m not that sorry 
tell me about it 
no way  i can t 
it s really  really boring 
come on  tell me about it 
i was really disappointed 
i thought this one would last
for a while  he was   
   very stupid  ugly 
bad in bed  alcoholic    
 you know 
 a real prize winner 
i was kind of giving him a favor 
but he left me 
saying i loved him too much 
i was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that 
but anyway  i was traumatized
and became  
and became totally obsessed with him 
so i went to a shrink  and it came up
that i had written   
   this stupid story about this
woman trying to kill her boyfriend   
   and how she d do it 
it s all the details
of how to do it and not get caught  
she was gonna kill her boyfriend 
yeah  she was  it s nothing i would do 
but it was just some writing 
no  i understand 
this stupid shrink believed
everything i told her 
it was my first time seeing her 
she said she had to call the police 
she had to call the police 
she was totally convinced
i was really gonna do it 
even though i had explained
it was just some writing 
she said  looking into my eyes 
 the way you said it   
   i know you are going to do it  
she was totally out of her mind 
it was my first and last session 
so what happened then 
i totally got over him 
but now  i m obsessed   
   that he s gonna die from
an accident or 1000 kilometers away 
and i m gonna be the one accused 
why is it you become obsessed
with people you don t   
   really like that much 
i don t know 
so how about you 
 what 
 are you with anyone 
it s funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long 
but now you have to tell me 
well  i kind of see love   
   as this escape for two people
who don t know how to be alone 
it s funny 
people always talk about how   
   iove is this totally unselfish 
giving thing 
but if you think about it 
there s nothing more selfish 
i know 
so who just broke up with you 
what 
you sound like you just were hurt 
do l 
all right 
big confession 
i should ve told you this
earlier or something 
i didn t come to europe just to   
   hang out and read hemingway in paris
and shit like that 
i saved up my money all spring to
fly to madrid   
   and spend the summer
with my girlfriend  
 your girlfriend 
 my ex girlfriend   
   who has been on this art history
program for the last year 
anyway  i got here 
we were reunited at long last   
   and we went out to dinner our
first night with six of her friends 
pedro  antonio  gonzalo   
   maria  suzy from home 
she managed to avoid being alone
with me for the first few days   
   and i stuck around just to let it
sink in that she wished i hadn t come 
so i bought the cheapest flight out 
this one leaving out of vienna 
it didn t leave for a couple weeks 
so i bought this eurail pass 
you know what s the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you 
it s when you remember
how little you thought about   
   the people you broke up with 
and you realize   
   that that is how little
they re thinking about you 
you d like to think
you re both in pain   
   but really  they re just 
 hey  i m glad you re gone  
believe me  i know 
you should look at bright colors 
that s what the shrink told me 
i was paying her 900 francs an hour   
   to hear that l
was a homicidal maniac   
   but i could shift my obsession if l
would concentrate on bright colors 
did it work 
 didn t help your pinball 
 well  no 
yeah  well  you know 
i haven t killed anyone lately 
not lately 
that s good 
you re cured then 
there s breeds of monkeys 
and all they do is have sex   
   all the time 
and they turn out to be
the least violent   
   the most peaceful  the most happy 
so maybe fooling around s
not so bad 
 are you talking about monkeys 
 yes  i am 
 i thought so 
 why 
i never heard this one 
but it reminds me of this perfect   
   male argument to justify them
fooling around 
women monkeys are fooling around too 
everybody s fooling around 
that s cute  i have this awful 
paranoid thought   
   that feminism was mostly invented
by men so they could   
   fool around more 
 woman  free your mind 
free your body  sleep with me 
we re all happy and free  as long as
i can fuck as much as i can  
all right 
but maybe there s some
biological things at work here 
if you had an island   
   and there were 99 women
on the island and only one man   
   in a year  you d have
the possibility of 99 babies 
but if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman   
   in a year  you have the possibility
of only one baby  so    
you know what 
on this island  i think there
will be only  like  maybe 43 men left 
they would ve killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman 
and on the other island 
there would be 99 women  99 babies   
   and no more man 
because they would ve all
eaten him alive 
oh  yeah 
there s something to that 
on some level  women don t mind
the idea of destroying a man 
i was walking down the street
with my ex girlfriend   
   and we d just walked by these four
thuggy looking guys next to a camaro 
and one of them says 
 hey  baby  nice ass  
so i m like   no big deal 
i won t get uptight about this  
plus  there were four of them 
exactly  but she says 
 fuck you  dickheads  
and i m like   okay 
wait a minute  here  
they re not gonna come over
and kick her ass 
so who just got pushed
to the frontline on that one 
women say they hate it
if you re all protective 
but if it suits them  then
they ll tell you you re being unmanly 
you know what  i don t think
woman really wants to destroy man 
even if they want to 
they don t succeed 
i m sure even men are
destroying women   
   or are capable of destroying women
much more than women  
anyway  it s depressing 
you know what 
 you wanna stop talking about this 
 i hate it 
men  women  it s    
there s no end to it 
it s like a skipping record 
every couple s been having
this conversation forever 
and nobody came up with anything 
i saw a documentary on that 
it s a birth dance 
a birth dance 
should i give her some money 
everything that s interesting
costs a little money 
so a birth dance  huh 
looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me 
no  but really 
women used it when giving birth 
in part of the world 
they still do it 
the woman in labor enters a tent   
   and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance 
they encourage her
to dance with them   
   so as to make
the birth less painful 
and when the baby is born 
they all dance in celebration 
i don t think my mom
would ve gone for that 
i like the idea of dancing as something
everybody participates in 
i know  i heard about this old guy   
   who was watching
some young people dance 
he said   how beautiful 
they re shaking off their genitals
to become angels  
i like that 
one question  though 
when the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff   
   where are the men 
are we out food gathering  are we not
invited  you all don t need us 
men are lucky we don t
bite off their heads after mating 
certain insects do that 
like spiders and stuff 
we let you live 
what are you complaining about 
see  you re officially kidding 
but there s something to that 
you keep bringing stuff like that up 
no  no  wait a minute 
talking seriously here 
i mean  i always feel
this pressure of being   
   a strong and independent
icon of womanhood   
   and not making it look like   
   my whole life is revolving
around some guy 
but loving someone   
   and being loved
means so much to me 
i always make fun of it and stuff   
   but isn t everything
we do in life   
   a way to be loved a little more 
i don t know 
sometimes i dream   
   about being a good father
and a good husband 
and sometimes it feels really close 
but then other times   
   it seems silly   
   iike it would   
   ruin my whole life 
and it s not just
a fear of commitment   
   or that i m incapable
of caring or loving because   
   i can 
it s just that  if i m
totally honest with myself   
   i think i d rather die knowing   
   that i was
really good at something 
that i had excelled
in some way   
   than that i d just been in   
   a nice  caring relationship 
i had worked for this older man 
and once he told me   
   that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career 
he was 52 
and it suddenly struck him   
   that he had never really
given anything of himself 
his life was for no one and nothing 
he was almost crying saying that 
i believe if there s
any kind of god   
   it wouldn t be in any of us   
   not you or me   
   but just this little space
in between 
if there s any kind of magic
in this world   
   it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone sharing something 
i know  it s almost
impossible to succeed   
   but who cares really 
the answer must be in the attempt 
i think this is a civilization in
decline  look at the service 
where is the waitress 
in new york  she d be out of a job 
i m gonna call my friend in paris   
   who i m supposed to have
lunch with in eight hours 
pick up 
 pick up the phone 
 all right 
i ve been working on my english 
you wanna talk in english  for laughs 
yeah  okay  that s a good idea 
i don t think i ll be able to
make it for lunch today 
i met a guy on the train 
and i got off with him in vienna 
are you crazy 
probably 
 he s austrian  he s from there 
 no  no 
he s passing through  he s american 
he s going back home tomorrow 
why d you get off 
well  he convinced me 
i mean  actually  i was ready to
get off the train with him   
   after talking to him a short while 
he was so sweet  i couldn t help it 
in the lounge car 
he began to talk about   
   him as a boy seeing
his great grandmother s ghost 
i think that s when i fell for him 
just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams 
he trapped me 
and he s so cute 
he has beautiful blue eyes   
   nice pink lips   
   greasy hair 
i love it 
he s kind of tall 
and he s a little clumsy 
i like to feel his eyes on me
when i look away 
he kind of kisses like an adolescent 
it s so cute 
 what 
 yeah  we kissed  it was so adorable 
as the night went on 
i began to like him more and more 
i m afraid he s scared of me 
i told him the story about
the woman that kills her ex boyfriend 
he must be scared to death 
he must be thinking i m
this manipulative  mean woman 
i just hope he doesn t feel
that way about me 
because  you know me 
i m the most harmless person 
the only person i could
really hurt is myself 
i don t think he s scared of you 
i think he s crazy about you 
 really 
 i ve known you a long time 
i got a good feeling 
you gonna see him again 
we haven t talked about that yet 
okay  it s your turn 
you call your friend 
all right  all right 
i usually get this guy s
answering machine 
hi  dude  what s up 
hey  frank  how you been 
i m glad you re home 
cool  yeah 
so how was madrid 
madrid sucked 
lisa and i had our
long overdue meltdown 
too bad  i told you  no 
yeah  yeah  the long distance thing
just never works 
i was only in madrid
for a couple days 
i got a cheaper flight out of vienna 
you know  it really wasn t
that much cheaper  i just    
i couldn t go home right away 
i didn t want to see anybody i knew 
i just wanted to be a ghost 
completely anonymous 
so are you okay now 
yeah  i m great  i m great 
that s the thing 
i m rapturous 
and i ll tell you why 
i met somebody
on my last night in europe 
 that s incredible 
 i know  i know 
you know how they say we re all
each other s demons and angels 
well  she was literally
a botticelli angel   
   telling me everything
would be okay 
how did you meet 
on the train 
she was sitting next to
a weird couple that was fighting   
   so she moved  she sat
right across the aisle from me 
so we started to talk 
she didn t like me much at first 
she s super smart   
   very passionate   
   and beautiful 
and i was so unsure of myself 
i thought everything i said
sounded so stupid 
oh  man  i wouldn t worry about that 
no  i m sure she was not judging you 
no  and by the way 
she sat next to you 
i m sure she did it on purpose 
oh  yeah 
us men are so stupid  we don t
understand anything about women 
they act strange 
the little i know of them 
don t they 
i feel like this is
some dream world we re in 
yeah  it s so weird 
it s like our time together
is just ours 
it s our own creation 
it must be like i m in your dream
and you re in mine 
and what s so cool
is that this whole evening   
   all our time together 
shouldn t officially be happening 
yeah  i know  maybe that s why
this feels so otherworldly 
but then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins  right 
i know 
but now  you re supposed to
produce the glass slipper   
   and see if it fits 
it ll fit 
this friend of mine had a kid   
   and it was a home birth 
so he was there helping out 
but he said at that
profound moment of birth   
   he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time   
   trying to take its first breath 
all he could think about was
that he was looking at something   
   that was gonna die someday 
he couldn t get it out of his head 
and i think that s so true 
everything is so finite 
but don t you think that s what   
   makes our time and specific moments
so important 
yeah  i know 
it s the same for us tonight  though 
after tomorrow  we ll probably
never see each other again  right 
you don t think we ll
ever see each other 
what do you think 
actually  i don t know 
i hadn t planned another  
me too  i live in paris 
you live in the u s  i understand 
i d hate to make you fly 
you d hate to fly  right 
i m not so scared of flying 
i mean  i could 
well  if you were gonna   
   come to the u s   
   or if  you know  if l    
i mean  i could come back here 
what 
no  let s just be rational adults
about this 
we should try something different 
it s not so bad if tonight
is our only night  right 
people exchange numbers  addresses 
they end up writing once 
calling each other twice 
right  fizzles out 
yeah  i don t want that 
i hate that 
i hate that too 
why does everybody think
relationships should last forever 
yeah  why  it s stupid 
but you think tonight s it 
i mean  that tonight s our only night 
it s the only way  no 
well  all right 
let s do it 
no delusions  no projections 
we ll just make tonight great 
let s do that 
we should do some kind of handshake 
give me your hand 
to our one and only   
   night together   
   and the hours that remain 
what 
it s just    
it s depressing  no 
now  the only thing
we re gonna think of is   
   when we ll have to say goodbye 
we could say goodbye now 
then we won t worry about it 
now 
say goodbye 
 bye 
 goodbye 
au revoir 
 later 
 later  yeah 
here s the plan 
you re gonna grab the glasses 
and i m gonna get the wine 
 red wine 
 red wine  right 
 you think you can do that 
 no problem 
 wish me luck 
 good luck 
hello 
do you speak english 
 a bit 
 yeah  a bit 
i m having kind of an odd situation   
   which is that    
you see that girl over there 
well  this is our only night together   
   and she    
the problem is that she wants
a bottle of red wine   
   and i don t have any money 
but i was thinking
that you might want to   
   give me the address of this bar 
and i would promise   
   to send you the money  and you d
be making our night complete 
you would send me the money 
your hand 
for the greatest night in your life 
thank you very much 
so often i ve been with people
and shared beautiful moments   
   iike traveling or staying up
all night and watching the sunrise 
and i knew those were special moments 
but something was always wrong 
i wished i d been with someone else 
i knew that what i was feeling   
   exactly what was so important to me 
they didn t understand 
but i m happy to be with you 
you couldn t know
why a night like this   
   is so important
to my life right now   
   but it is 
this is a great morning 
it is a great morning 
do you think we have others like this 
what about our rational  adult decision 
oh  yeah 
i know what you mean about wishing
somebody wasn t there 
it s just  usually  it s myself   
   that i wish i could get away from 
seriously  think about this 
i have never been anywhere   
   that i haven t been 
i ve never had a kiss   
   when i wasn t one of the kissers 
you know  i ve never   
   gone to the movies when
i wasn t there in the audience 
i ve never been out bowling
if i wasn t there   
   making some stupid joke 
that s why so many people
hate themselves  seriously 
it s just  they are sick to death   
   of being around themselves 
let s say that you and l
were together all the time 
you d start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms 
the way   
   the way every time
that we would have people over   
   i d be insecure  and i d get
a little too drunk 
or the way i tell the same stupid 
pseudo intellectual story   
   again and again 
you see  i ve heard
all those stories   
   so of course i m sick of myself 
but being with you   
   it s made me feel like
i was somebody else 
i mean  the only other way
to lose yourself like that is   
   you know  dancing   
   or alcohol   
   or drugs  or stuff like that 
fucking 
fucking  yeah  that s one way 
do you know what i want 
what 
to be kissed 
well  i could do that 
wait 
i have to say something stupid 
all right 
it s very stupid 
i don t think we should
sleep together 
i want to  but since we re never
going to see each other again   
   it ll make me feel bad 
i ll wonder who else you re with 
i ll miss you 
i know  it s not very adult 
maybe it s a female thing 
i can t help it 
let s see each other again 
no  i don t want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid 
i don t want to just get laid 
i want to   i mean    
i mean  i think we should 
we die in the morning  right 
 i think we should 
 then it s like some male fantasy 
meet a french girl 
fuck her and never see her again 
and have this great story to tell 
i don t want   
   this great evening to
just have been for that 
okay  we don t have to have sex 
it s not a big deal 
you don t want to see me again 
no  of course i do 
if somebody gave me
the choice right now   
   of to never see you again
or to marry you   
   i would marry you 
maybe that s a lot
of romantic bullshit   
   but people have gotten married
for a lot less 
actually   
   i think i decided i wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train 
now that we ve talked so much 
i don t know anymore 
why do we make everything
so complicated 
i don t know 
what s the first thing you ll do
when you get back to paris 
call my parents 
what about you 
i don t know  i ll probably go
pick up my dog  he s with a friend 
you have a dog 
i love dogs 
 you do 
 yeah 
 oh  shit 
 what 
i don t know 
we re back in real time 
i know  i hate that 
what is that 
sounds like a harpsichord 
check that out 
somebody s playing 
that s cool 
can we dance to the harpsichord 
of course 
oh  wow 
i m gonna take your picture   
   so i never forget you   
   or all this 
okay  me too 
 the years shall run like rabbits  
what 
nothing 
i have   
   this recording of dylan thomas   
   reading a w  h  auden poem 
he s got a great voice 
it s like    
 all the clocks in the city
began to whirr and chime 
 o let not time deceive you
you cannot conquer time 
in headaches and in worry
vaguely life leaks away
and time will have his fancy
tomorrow or today   
something like that 
that s good 
when you talked earlier
about after a few years   
   how a couple would begin
to hate each other   
   by anticipating their reactions   
   or getting tired
of their mannerisms 
i think it would be
the opposite for me 
i think i can really fall in love
when i know everything about someone 
the way he s gonna part his hair   
   which shirt he s gonna
wear that day   
   knowing the exact story he d tell
in a given situation 
i m sure that s when i know
i m really in love 
 hey  guess what 
 what 
we didn t go to those guys  play 
play 
the cow 
oh  yeah  we didn t 
oh  no  we missed it 
you know what bus to take
to the airport 
no problem 
 i should get on this one 
 right here  you wanna get on there 
i guess this is it  no 
i really    
 you know    
 yeah  i know  me too 
have a great life  have fun
with everything you re gonna do 
good luck with school and all that 
i hate this 
me too 
the train is about to leave 
you know all this bullshit
we re talking about   
   not seeing each other 
i don t want that 
i don t either 
 you don t 
 i waited for you to say it 
why didn t you say something 
i was afraid
you didn t wanna see me 
what do you wanna do 
maybe we should meet here
in five years or something 
five years  that s a long time 
it s awful  it s like
a sociological experiment 
 how about one year 
 one year 
 how about six months 
 six months 
it s gonna be freezing 
who cares  we come here 
we go somewhere else 
six months from now or last night 
last night  six months
from last night  which was   
   june 1 6th 
so track nine  six months from now
at 6 00 at night 
december 
it s a train ride for you 
but i gotta fly all the way here 
but i m gonna be here 
 okay  me too 
 all right 
we won t call  write or  
no  it s depressing 
your train s gonna leave
