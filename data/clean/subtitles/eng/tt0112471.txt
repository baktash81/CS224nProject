yeah
no im sorry
my german is not very good
have you heard that
as couples age
they lose their ability
to hear each other
no
supposedly men lose their ability
to hear highpitched sounds
and women lose hearing
in the low end
i guess they nullify each other
i guess natures way of allowing
couples to grow old together
without killing each other
what are you reading
oh yeah
how about you
i was thinking about going
to the lounge car
would you like to come with me
yeah
okay
how do you speak such good english
i went to school for a summer
in los angeles
its fine here
yeah this is good
and i spent some time in london
wow
how do you speak such good english
me im american
youre american are you sure
yeah
no im joking
i knew you were american
and you dont speak
any other language right
yeah yeah
i get it i get it
im the crude dumb
vulgar american
who doesnt speak other languages
who has no culture but i tried
i took french in high school
when i first got to paris
i stood in line
at the metro station
i was practicing
whatever
and i get up there
and i look at this woman
and my mind goes blank and i say
l need a ticket to get to
so anyway
so where are you headed
well back to paris
my classes start next week
youre still in school where
la sorbonne you know
sure
youre coming from budapest
i was visiting my grandmother
oh how is she
shes okay
shes all right
shes fine
how about you where are you going
im going to vienna
vienna
whats there
no idea
im flying out of there tomorrow
youre on holiday
i dont really know what im on
you know
ive just been traveling around
riding trains for two or three weeks
you were visiting friends
or just on your own
i had a friend in madrid but
madrid thats nice
i got a eurail pass
is what i did
thats great
so has this trip around europe
been good for you
yeah sure its been
it sucked
what
its had its
ill tell you sitting for weeks on end
looking out the window
has actually been kind of great
what do you mean
well you know for instance
you have ideas that you
ordinarily wouldnt have
what kind of ideas
want to hear one
tell me
all right
i have this idea okay
for a television show
some friends of mine
are cableaccess producers
do you know what that is
anybody can produce a show real cheap
and they have to put it on
i have this idea for a show that lasts
24 hours a day for a year straight
what you do is you get
365 people from cities
all over the world
to do these 24hour documents
of real time
capturing life as its lived
you know it would start with a guy
waking up in the morning
and taking the long shower
eating a little breakfast
making a little coffee
reading the paper
wait all those mundane
boring things
everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life
i was going to say
the poetry of daytoday life
you say it your way
ill say it my way
think of it like this
whos gonna watch
think about it like this why is it
that a dog sleeping in the sun
is so beautiful
it is its beautiful
but a guy taking money
from a bank machine
iooks like a complete moron
so its like a national geographic
program but on people
yeah
what do you think
yeah i can see it
like 24 boring hours sorry
and a threeminute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after
yeah and that would
be a great episode
people would talk about that episode
you and your friends could
do one in paris if you wanted
i dont know the key the thing
that haunts me is the distribution
getting these tapes from town to town
so it would play continuously
because it would have to play all
the time or it just wouldnt work
thank you
thanks
you know what
not service oriented
just an observation about europe
my parents never really
spoke of the possibility
of my falling in love or
getting married or having children
even as a little girl
they wanted me to think as
a future career as a you know
interior designer or lawyer
or something like that
id say to my dad
l want to be a writer
and hed say journalist
id say i wanted to have a refuge for
stray cats hed say veterinarian
id say i wanted to be an actress
hed say tv newscaster
it was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition into these
practical moneymaking ventures
i had a good bullshit detector
when i was a kid
i always knew
when they were lying to me
by high school i was dead set
on listening to what everybody
thought i should do with my life
and doing the opposite
nobody was ever mean about it
i just could never get very excited
about other peoples ambitions
for my life
but you know what
if your parents never
fully contradict you about anything
and are nice and supportive
right
it makes it even harder
to officially complain
even when theyre wrong
its this passiveaggressive shit
you know what i mean
i hate it
i really hate it
well you know despite all that
kind of bullshit
that comes along with it
i remember childhood as
this magical time
i do i remember when my mother
first told me about death
my greatgrandmother had died and my
family had visited them in florida
i was about 3 3 12 years old
anyway i was in
the back yard playing
and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose
and do it in such a way that
it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow
and so i was doing that
and through the mist
i could see my grandmother
and she was just standing there
smiling at me
and i held it there for a long time
and i looked at her
and then finally i let go
of the nozzle you know
and then i dropped the hose
and she disappeared
and so i run back inside
and tell my parents
and they sit me down
and give me this big rap on how
when people die you never see
them again and how id imagined it
but i knew what id seen
i was glad i saw that
ive never seen anything
like that since but i dont know
it just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was
even death
youre lucky you can have
this attitude toward death
i think im afraid of death
24 hours a day
i swear i mean thats why
im in a train right now
i couldve flown to paris
but im scared
oh come on
i cant help it
i know the statistics say
na na na its safer whatever
when im in a plane
i can see the explosion
i can see me falling
through the clouds
and im so scared of those
few seconds of consciousness
before you die
when you know youre gonna die
i cant stop thinking that way
its exhausting
yeah i bet
really exhausting
i think this is vienna
yeah
you get off here no
yeah what a drag
i wish id met you earlier
i really like talking to you
yeah me too
it was really nice of you too
i have an admittedly insane idea
but if i dont ask you this
itll haunt me the rest of my life
what
i want to keep talking to you
i have no idea what your situation is
but i feel like we have
some kind of
connection right
yeah me too
right great
heres the deal
get off here in vienna
and come check out the town
what
come on itll be fun
come on
what would we do
i dont know all i know is i catch
a flight tomorrow morning at 930
and i cant afford a hotel
so i was going to walk around
and itd be more fun
if you came with me
and if i turn out to be a psycho
just get on the next train
all right all right
think of it like this
jump ahead 10 20 years okay
and youre married
only your marriage doesnt have
that same energy it used to have
you start to blame your husband
you think about all those guys
youve met in your life
and what mightve happened
if youd picked up with one of them
im one of those guys
thats me
so think of this as time travel
from then to now to find out
what youre missing out on
what this could be is
a gigantic favor
to you and your husband to find out
youre not missing anything
im just as big a loser as he is
unmotivated boring
you made the right choice
youre happy
let me get my bag
we should get a locker for all this
whats your name
my name
jesse james actually
but everybody calls me jesse
you mean jesse james no
no no just jesse
im celine
this is a nice bridge
yeah
this is kind of weird
isnt it i mean
i feel a little awkward
but its all right right
yeah this is great
lets go to some places
yeah lets go to some places
lets ask these guys
okay
excuse me excuse me
sprechen sie english
ja of course
do you speak german for a change
what
no it was a joke
we just got into vienna today and
were looking for something fun to do
like museums exhibitions
but museums are not that
funny anymore these days
they are closing right now
how long are you going to be here
just for tonight
why did you come to vienna
what could you be expecting
were on honeymoon
yeah she got pregnant
we had to get married
i dont believe you
youre a bad liar
this is a play were both in
we would like to invite you
youre actors
not professional
parttime for fun
its a play about a cow and
lndians searching for it
there are also
politicians mexicans
russians communists
you have a real cow on stage
no an actor in a cow costume
hes the cow
yes i am the cow
and the cows a bit weird
the cow has a disease
shes acting a bit strange
like a dog
if someone throws a stick
she fetches it
and she can smoke with hoofs
and everything
great
as you see there is the address
its in the second district
near the prater you know it
the big ferris wheel
we should go we should
perhaps you can go to the prater
before the play
it starts at 2130
its at 930
oh right
whats the name of this play
it translates as bring me the horns
of wilmingtons cow
im wilmingtons cow
all right
great
youll be there
well try
im the cow
goodbye
i got an idea are you ready
its q and a time
weve known each other a little while
were stuck together so well ask
each other a few direct questions
all right
we ask each other questions
and you have to answer honestly
of course
okay
all right first question
you
yes i am going to ask you
describe for me your
first sexual feelings
towards a person
my first sexual feelings
oh my god
i know i know
jeanmarc fleury
jeanmarc fleury
we were at this summer camp together
and he was a swimmer
he had bleachedout
chlorine hair and green eyes
and to improve his times
hed shave his legs and arms
thats disgusting
he was like this gorgeous dolphin
my friend emma
had a big crush on him
so one day i was cutting across
the field back to my room
and he came walking up beside me
i told him
you should date emma
she has a big crush on you
and he turned to me and said
well thats too bad because
i have a big crush on you
so yeah it really scared
the hell out of me
because i thought he was so fine
then he officially asked me on a date
i pretended i didnt like him
you know i was so afraid of
what i might do you know
so i went to see him swim
a few times at the competition
and he was so sexy really
i mean really sexy
we wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer
and you know promised we would
keep writing forever
and meet again very soon and
did you
of course not
then this is the opportune time
to tell you im a fantastic swimmer
really
yeah
i make note of that
okay
so its my turn no
yes your turn
hit me
have you ever been in love
yes
next question
what was the
wait a minute
so i can give oneword answers
why not
after i went into detail
about my sexual feelings
theyre different questions i could
answer the sexualfeelings thing
but you know love i mean
what if i asked you about love
i would have lied but at least
i would have made up a great story
love is a complex issue you know
i mean yes ive told somebody
that i love them and ive meant it
but was it totally unselfish
giving love
was it a beautiful thing
not really
you know its like love
i mean i dont know
you know
yeah i know what you mean
but as far as sexual feelings go
it started with
an obsessive relationship
with miss july 1978
do you know playboy magazine
ive heard of it
you know crystal
you dont know crystal
well i knew crystal
is it my turn now
tell me something that
really pisses you off
really drives you crazy
pisses me off
god everything pisses me off
list a couple
oh i know i hate being told
by strange men
strange men in the street
you know to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life
what else
i hate
i hate that 300 kilometers from here
theres a war
people are dying
and nobody knows what to do
or they dont give a shit
i dont know
i hate that the medias
trying to control our minds
the media
yeah the media
its very subtle but its
a new form of fascism really
i hate
i hate when im in a foreign country
especially in america
each time i wear black or lose my
temper or say anything about anything
they always go
oh its so french its so cute
i hate that
i cant stand that really
is that all
well theres a lot of things but
so its my turn
okay
youre gonna answer
yes ill answer
whats a problem for you
you probably
what
i had a thought the other day
that kind of
qualifies as a problem
what is it
it was a thought i had
on the train so
okay all right
do you believe in reincarnation
yeah yeah its interesting
a lot of people talk about past
lives and things like that you know
and even if they dont believe in it
in some specific way
people have a notion
of an eternal soul
yeah
okay
this is my thought
50000 years ago
theres not even a million people
ten thousand years ago
theres like two million people
now theres between five and six
billion people on the planet
if we all have our own
individual unique
soul
where did they all come from
are modern souls only
a fraction of the original souls
if they are that represents
a 5000 to 1 split of each soul
in the last 50000 years which is
a blip in the earths time
so at best were these
tiny fractions
of people walking
is that why were so scattered
is that why were so specialized
wait a minute im not sure
yeah i know i know
its a totally scattered thought
which is kind of why it makes sense
i agree with you
lets get off this damn train
this place is pretty neat
yeah
theres even a listening booth
have you heard of this singer
i think shes american
a friend told me about her
do you want to go see if that
listening booth still works
yeah okay
theres a wind that
blows in from the north
and it says that loving
takes this course
come here
come here
no im not impossible to touch
i have never wanted you so much
come here
come here
have i never laid down by your side
baby lets forget about this pride
come here
come here
look at this this is beautiful
quick its leaving
look theres a rabbit
yeah
hey there rabbit
its so cute
i visited this as a young teenager
it left a bigger impression on me
at that time than the museums
yeah its tiny
i know
a little old man talked to us
he was the groundskeeper
he explained that most
of the people buried here
had washed up on the bank
of the danube
how old are these
around the beginning of the century
its called no name cemetery
because they often didnt know
who those people were
maybe a first name thats all
why were all the bodies washing up
i think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that
but most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river
i always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world
when i was a little girl
i thought
if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead
then its like
not really being dead
people can invent the best
and the worst for you
here she is i think
yeah this is the one
i remember the most
she was only 13 when she died
that meant something to me
i was that age when i first saw this
now im 10 years older
and shes still 13 i guess
thats funny
thats the danube over there
thats a river right
yeah
this is
gorgeous
yeah this is beautiful
i mean we got
we got a sunset here
yeah
we got the ferris wheel
it seems like
this would be a
what
you know
are you trying to say
you want to kiss me
but you know what
it doesnt matter what
generation youre born into
look at my parents
they were angry young may 68 people
revolting against everything
the government their conservative
catholic backgrounds
then i was born and my father
became a successful architect
we traveled around the world
while he built bridges
and you know towers and stuff
i mean i really cant
complain about anything
they love me more than anything
and ive been raised with all
the freedom they fought for
and yet for me now
its another type of fight
we have to deal with the same shit
but we cant really know
who or you know what the enemy is
i dont know if
there really is an enemy
everybodys parents fucked them up
rich kids parents gave them too much
poor kids not enough
too much attention
not enough attention
they either left or
taught them the wrong things
my parents are just two people
who didnt like each other much
who got married and had a kid
and they tried their best
to be nice to me
did your parents divorce
yeah finally
they should have done it sooner
they stuck together
for the wellbeing of my sister
and l thank you very much
i remember my mother told me
right in front of my father
that he didnt really
want to have me
that he was pissed off when
he found out she was pregnant
that i was a big mistake
that really shaped the way i think
i always saw the world as this place
where i really wasnt meant to be
thats so sad
well i mean i eventually
kind of took pride in it
you know like my life
was my own doing
you know like i was
crashing the big party
thats the way to see it
my parents are still married
and i guess theyre happy
but i think its healthy to rebel
against everything that came before
you know ive been wondering lately
do you know anyone
whos in a happy relationship
yeah sure you know
i know happy couples
but i think they lie to each other
yeah
people can live their
whole life as a lie
my grandmother was married
and i thought she had an
uncomplicated love life
but she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life
dreaming about another man
she was in love with
she just accepted her fate
its so sad
in the same time i love that
she had these emotions
and feelings i never
thought she had
i guarantee you
it was better that way
if shed known him hed have
disappointed her eventually
how do you know
i know i know
people put romantic projections
on everything
its not based in any kind of reality
romantic projections
oh mr romantic up in the ferris wheel
oh kiss me the sunset
oh its so beautiful
tell me about your grandmother
what were you saying about her
check these guys out
hans i have a confession im not
wearing underwear underneath this
oh really does that frighten you
can i tell you a secret
yeah
come here
what
come here
look at this palm reader
shes interesting looking
yeah
uhoh uhoh
what
i made eye contact
shes not coming over here
yes she is
oh shit
oh no
you want your palm read
no
are you sure
im sure
okay
hello
oh here she is
i want your palm read
yeah how much is it
for you 50
okay
okay
so you have been on a journey
and youre a stranger
to this place
you are
an adventurer
a seeker
an adventurer in your mind
you are interested
in the power of the woman
in the womans deep strength
and creativity
youre becoming this woman
you need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life
only if you find peace
within yourself
will you find
true connection with others
that is a stranger to you
i guess so
you will be all right
hes learning
okay
money
youre both stars
dont forget
when the stars exploded
billions of years ago
they formed everything
that is this world
everything we know is stardust
so dont forget you are stardust
thats very nice and all
i mean that were all stardust
and youre becoming this great woman
but i hope you dont take that
any more seriously
than some horoscope
in a newspaper
what she knew i was on vacation
and that we didnt know each other
and that i was going
to become this great woman
but what was that
l am learning bullshit
thats way condescending you know
i mean she wasnt even doing me
i mean if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth
it would put them
out of business
just once id love to see some
little old lady save up all her money
to go to the fortuneteller shed
get there and the woman would say
tomorrow and all
your remaining days
will be exactly like today
a tedious collection of hours
and you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts
and no new travels
and when you die
youll be completely forgotten
fifty schillings please
that id like to see
its so funny how
she almost didnt notice you
its weird i wonder why
she was really wise and intense
i really loved what she said
you pay your money to hear what
makes you feel good about yourself
maybe theres a seedy section of vienna
we can buy a hit of crack
would you like that
youre so
stardust stardust
theres an exhibition
i guess well miss it
it doesnt start until next week
yeah i think so
i actually saw this one in a museum
i stared and stared at it
must have been 45 minutes
i love it
la voie ferrée
its great
i love the way the people are
dissolving into the background
look at this
its like the environments
are stronger than the people
his human figures are
always so transitory
its funny transitory
transitory
you think this is open
i dont know lets try it
i was in an old church like this
with my grandmother
a few days ago in budapest
even though i reject
most of the religious thing
i cant help but feeling for
those people that come here
iost or in pain guilt
iooking for some kind of answers
it fascinates me how a single place
can join pain and happiness
of so many generations
youre close with your grandmother
yeah
i think its because i always
have this strange feeling
that im this very old woman
laying down about to die
you know that my life is just
her memories or something
thats so wild
i always think that im still
this 13yearold boy
who doesnt really know how
to be an adult pretending to
iive my life taking notes for when
ill really have to do it
like im in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play
thats funny
then up there in the ferris wheel
it was like
this very old woman
kissing this very young boy right
do you know anything about
the quakers the quaker religion
no not much
well i went to
this quaker wedding once
and it was fantastic
what they do is
the couple comes in and they kneel
in front of the whole congregation
and they stare at each other
nobody says a word unless they feel
that god moves them to speak
or say something
and then after an hour or so of just
staring at each other
theyre married
thats beautiful i like that
this is a horrible story
what
its not the appropriate place
to tell it
well i was driving around
with this buddy of mine
hes a big atheist you know
and he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy
my buddy takes out a  100 bill
and leans out the window
and he says
do you believe in god
and the guy looks at my friend
he looks at the money
he says
yes i do
my friend says wrong answer
we drove away
thats mean
would you be in paris by now
if you hadnt gotten off the train
no not yet
what would you be doing
id probably be hanging around
the airport
crying in my coffee
because you didnt come with me
id probably gotten off the train
in salzburg with someone else
oh yeah oh i see
so im just a dumb american
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas huh
im having a great time
really
me too
im glad because
no one knows im here
i dont know anyone
that would tell me
all those bad things youve done
ill tell you some
yeah im sure
you hear so much shit about people
i always feel like
the general of an army
when i start dating
plotting my strategy
and maneuverings
knowing his weak points
what would hurt him seduce him
its horrible
if we were always around each other
what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad
no im not going to
answer this question
i dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that
what about me bugs you
finally i said l dont think
you handle criticism too well
she flew into a rage and
broke up with me thats true
all she wanted was
to have an excuse
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me
is that what you want
something about me bugs you
what is it about me bugs you
nothing at all
if it had to be something
what would it be
if it had to be something
if i had to think about it
i kind of didnt really like this
reaction at the palm reader
you were like this rooster prick
what the hell
is a rooster prick
you were like a boy whining
because all the attention
wasnt focused on him
all right listen
this woman robs you blind okay
you were like a boy
walking by an icecream store
crying because his mom
wont buy him a milk shake
i dont care what this charlatan
has to say about
what
i understand a little
but he doesnt at all
may i ask you a question
so i would like to
make a deal with you
i mean instead of just asking you
for money i will ask you for a word
you give me a word i take the word
and then i will write a poem
with the word inside
and if you like it
if you like my poem
if it adds something to
your life in any way
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like
ill write in english of course
okay
all right great
so
pick a word
a word
milk shake
milk shake oh good
i was gonna say rooster prick
but great milk shake
milk shake
okay milk shake
all right so
good
i gotta say i like this
viennese variation of bum
i like what he said about
adding something to your life
so were we having
our first fight back there
i think so i think we were
even if we were why does everyone
think conflict is so bad
theres a lot of good things
coming out of conflict
yeah i guess so
i always think if i could
just accept the fact
that my life was supposed to be
difficult thats whats expected
then i might not get so pissed off
and id just be glad
when something nice happens
thats why im still in school
its easier to have
something to fight against
well weve all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us
you know i can be doing
the most nothing thing
throwing some darts
or shooting some pool
then all of a sudden
i feel it come over me
i have got to win
is that why you tried to get me
off the train competitiveness
what do you mean
i got a poem
oh all right
will you read it to us
sure okay
daydream delusion
limousine eyelash
oh baby with your pretty face
drop a tear in my wine glass
look at those big eyes
see what you mean to me
sweetcakes and milk shakes
i am a delusion angel
im a fantasy parade
i want you to know what i think
dont want you to guess anymore
you have no idea where i came from
we have no idea where were going
lodged in life
like branches in the river
flowing downstream
caught in the current
i carry you
youll carry me
thats how it could be
dont you know me
dont you know me by now
great
thanks
thanks man
here you go
thanks
all right
here thank you
thank you
good luck
it was wonderful no
what
he probably didnt just write that
he wrote it but he
probably plugs that word in
you know whatever milk shake
what do you mean
nothing i loved it it was great
you know what drives me crazy
people talking about
how great technology is
how it saves all this time
but what good is saved time
if nobody uses it
if it just turns into more busy work
i never hear anybody say with the time
ive saved using my word processor
im gonna go to a zen monastery
and hang out
you dont hear that
time is so abstract anyway
are you looking at this girl
what
nothing
you wanna go in here
you wanna go in here

come on tell me about it
i was really disappointed
i thought this one would last
for a while he was
very stupid ugly
bad in bed alcoholic
you know
a real prize winner
i was kind of giving him a favor
but he left me
saying i loved him too much
i was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that
but anyway i was traumatized
and became
and became totally obsessed with him
so i went to a shrink and it came up
that i had written
this stupid story about this
woman trying to kill her boyfriend
and how shed do it
its all the details
of how to do it and not get caught
she was gonna kill her boyfriend
yeah she was its nothing i would do
but it was just some writing
no i understand
this stupid shrink believed
everything i told her
it was my first time seeing her
she said she had to call the police
she had to call the police
she was totally convinced
i was really gonna do it
even though i had explained
it was just some writing
she said looking into my eyes
the way you said it
i know you are going to do it
she was totally out of her mind
it was my first and last session
so what happened then
i totally got over him
but now im obsessed
that hes gonna die from
an accident or 1000 kilometers away
and im gonna be the one accused
why is it you become obsessed
with people you dont
really like that much
i dont know
so how about you
what
are you with anyone
its funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long
but now you have to tell me
well i kind of see love
as this escape for two people
who dont know how to be alone
its funny
people always talk about how
iove is this totally unselfish
giving thing
but if you think about it
theres nothing more selfish
i know
so who just broke up with you
what
you sound like you just were hurt
do l
all right
big confession
i shouldve told you this
earlier or something
i didnt come to europe just to
hang out and read hemingway in paris
and shit like that
i saved up my money all spring to
fly to madrid
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend
your girlfriend
my exgirlfriend
who has been on this art history
program for the last year
anyway i got here
we were reunited at long last
and we went out to dinner our
first night with six of her friends
pedro antonio gonzalo
maria suzy from home
she managed to avoid being alone
with me for the first few days
and i stuck around just to let it
sink in that she wished i hadnt come
so i bought the cheapest flight out
this one leaving out of vienna
it didnt leave for a couple weeks
so i bought this eurail pass
you know whats the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you
its when you remember
how little you thought about
the people you broke up with
and you realize
that that is how little
theyre thinking about you
youd like to think
youre both in pain
but really theyre just
hey im glad youre gone
believe me i know
you should look at bright colors
thats what the shrink told me
i was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that l
was a homicidal maniac
but i could shift my obsession if l
would concentrate on bright colors
did it work
didnt help your pinball
well no
yeah well you know
i havent killed anyone lately
not lately
thats good
youre cured then
theres breeds of monkeys
and all they do is have sex
all the time
and they turn out to be
the least violent
the most peaceful the most happy
so maybe fooling arounds
not so bad
are you talking about monkeys
yes i am
i thought so
why
i never heard this one
but it reminds me of this perfect
male argument to justify them
fooling around
women monkeys are fooling around too
everybodys fooling around
thats cute i have this awful
paranoid thought
that feminism was mostly invented
by men so they could
fool around more
woman free your mind
free your body sleep with me
were all happy and free as long as
i can fuck as much as i can
all right
but maybe theres some
biological things at work here
if you had an island
and there were 99 women
on the island and only one man
in a year youd have
the possibility of 99 babies
but if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman
in a year you have the possibility
of only one baby so
you know what
on this island i think there
will be only like maybe 43 men left
they wouldve killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman
and on the other island
there would be 99 women 99 babies
and no more man
because they wouldve all
eaten him alive
oh yeah
theres something to that
on some level women dont mind
the idea of destroying a man
i was walking down the street
with my exgirlfriend
and wed just walked by these four
thuggylooking guys next to a camaro
and one of them says
hey baby nice ass
so im like no big deal
i wont get uptight about this
plus there were four of them
exactly but she says
fuck you dickheads
and im like okay
wait a minute here
theyre not gonna come over
and kick her ass
so who just got pushed
to the frontline on that one
women say they hate it
if youre all protective
but if it suits them then
theyll tell you youre being unmanly
you know what i dont think
woman really wants to destroy man
even if they want to
they dont succeed
im sure even men are
destroying women
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women
anyway its depressing
you know what
you wanna stop talking about this
i hate it
men women its
theres no end to it
its like a skipping record
every couples been having
this conversation forever
and nobody came up with anything
i saw a documentary on that
its a birth dance
a birth dance
should i give her some money
everything thats interesting
costs a little money
so a birth dance huh
looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me
no but really
women used it when giving birth
in part of the world
they still do it
the woman in labor enters a tent
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance
they encourage her
to dance with them
so as to make
the birth less painful
and when the baby is born
they all dance in celebration
i dont think my mom
wouldve gone for that
i like the idea of dancing as something
everybody participates in
i know i heard about this old guy
who was watching
some young people dance
he said how beautiful
theyre shaking off their genitals
to become angels
i like that
one question though
when the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff
where are the men
are we out food gathering are we not
invited you all dont need us
men are lucky we dont
bite off their heads after mating
certain insects do that
like spiders and stuff
we let you live
what are you complaining about
see youre officially kidding
but theres something to that
you keep bringing stuff like that up
no no wait a minute
talking seriously here
i mean i always feel
this pressure of being
a strong and independent
icon of womanhood
and not making it look like
my whole life is revolving
around some guy
but loving someone
and being loved
means so much to me
i always make fun of it and stuff
but isnt everything
we do in life
a way to be loved a little more
i dont know
sometimes i dream
about being a good father
and a good husband
and sometimes it feels really close
but then other times
it seems silly
iike it would
ruin my whole life
and its not just
a fear of commitment
or that im incapable
of caring or loving because
i can
its just that if im
totally honest with myself
i think id rather die knowing
that i was
really good at something
that i had excelled
in some way
than that id just been in
a nice caring relationship
i had worked for this older man
and once he told me
that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career
he was 52
and it suddenly struck him
that he had never really
given anything of himself
his life was for no one and nothing
he was almost crying saying that
i believe if theres
any kind of god
it wouldnt be in any of us
not you or me
but just this little space
in between
if theres any kind of magic
in this world
it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone sharing something
i know its almost
impossible to succeed
but who cares really
the answer must be in the attempt
i think this is a civilization in
decline look at the service
where is the waitress
in new york shed be out of a job
im gonna call my friend in paris
who im supposed to have
lunch with in eight hours
pick up
pick up the phone
all right
ive been working on my english
you wanna talk in english for laughs
yeah okay thats a good idea
i dont think ill be able to
make it for lunch today
i met a guy on the train
and i got off with him in vienna
are you crazy
probably
hes austrian hes from there
no no
hes passing through hes american
hes going back home tomorrow
whyd you get off
well he convinced me
i mean actually i was ready to
get off the train with him
after talking to him a short while
he was so sweet i couldnt help it
in the lounge car
he began to talk about
him as a boy seeing
his greatgrandmothers ghost
i think thats when i fell for him
just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams
he trapped me
and hes so cute
he has beautiful blue eyes
nice pink lips
greasy hair
i love it
hes kind of tall
and hes a little clumsy
i like to feel his eyes on me
when i look away
he kind of kisses like an adolescent
its so cute
what
yeah we kissed it was so adorable
as the night went on
i began to like him more and more
im afraid hes scared of me
i told him the story about
the woman that kills her exboyfriend
he must be scared to death
he must be thinking im
this manipulative mean woman
i just hope he doesnt feel
that way about me
because you know me
im the most harmless person
the only person i could
really hurt is myself
i dont think hes scared of you
i think hes crazy about you
really
ive known you a long time
i got a good feeling
you gonna see him again
we havent talked about that yet
okay its your turn
you call your friend
all right all right
i usually get this guys
answering machine
hi dude whats up
hey frank how you been
im glad youre home
cool yeah
so how was madrid
madrid sucked
lisa and i had our
long overdue meltdown
too bad i told you no
yeah yeah the longdistance thing
just never works
i was only in madrid
for a couple days
i got a cheaper flight out of vienna
you know it really wasnt
that much cheaper i just
i couldnt go home right away
i didnt want to see anybody i knew
i just wanted to be a ghost
completely anonymous
so are you okay now
yeah im great im great
thats the thing
im rapturous
and ill tell you why
i met somebody
on my last night in europe
thats incredible
i know i know
you know how they say were all
each others demons and angels
well she was literally
a botticelli angel
telling me everything
would be okay
how did you meet
on the train
she was sitting next to
a weird couple that was fighting
so she moved she sat
right across the aisle from me
so we started to talk
she didnt like me much at first
shes super smart
very passionate
and beautiful
and i was so unsure of myself
i thought everything i said
sounded so stupid
oh man i wouldnt worry about that
no im sure she was not judging you
no and by the way
she sat next to you
im sure she did it on purpose
oh yeah
us men are so stupid we dont
understand anything about women
they act strange
the little i know of them
dont they
i feel like this is
some dream world were in
yeah its so weird
its like our time together
is just ours
its our own creation
it must be like im in your dream
and youre in mine
and whats so cool
is that this whole evening
all our time together
shouldnt officially be happening
yeah i know maybe thats why
this feels so otherworldly
but then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins right
i know
but now youre supposed to
produce the glass slipper
and see if it fits
itll fit
this friend of mine had a kid
and it was a home birth
so he was there helping out
but he said at that
profound moment of birth
he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time
trying to take its first breath
all he could think about was
that he was looking at something
that was gonna die someday
he couldnt get it out of his head
and i think thats so true
everything is so finite
but dont you think thats what
makes our time and specific moments
so important
yeah i know
its the same for us tonight though
after tomorrow well probably
never see each other again right
you dont think well
ever see each other
what do you think
actually i dont know
i hadnt planned another
me too i live in paris
you live in the us i understand
id hate to make you fly
youd hate to fly right
im not so scared of flying
i mean i could
well if you were gonna
come to the us
or if you know if l
i mean i could come back here
what
no lets just be rational adults
about this
we should try something different
its not so bad if tonight
is our only night right
people exchange numbers addresses
they end up writing once
calling each other twice
right fizzles out
yeah i dont want that
i hate that
i hate that too
why does everybody think
relationships should last forever
yeah why its stupid
but you think tonights it
i mean that tonights our only night
its the only way no
well all right
lets do it
no delusions no projections
well just make tonight great
lets do that
we should do some kind of handshake
give me your hand
to our one and only
night together
and the hours that remain
what
its just
its depressing no
now the only thing
were gonna think of is
when well have to say goodbye
we could say goodbye now
then we wont worry about it
now
say goodbye
bye
goodbye
au revoir
later
later yeah
heres the plan
youre gonna grab the glasses
and im gonna get the wine
red wine
red wine right
you think you can do that
no problem
wish me luck
good luck
hello
do you speak english
a bit
yeah a bit
im having kind of an odd situation
which is that
you see that girl over there
well this is our only night together
and she
the problem is that she wants
a bottle of red wine
and i dont have any money
but i was thinking
that you might want to
give me the address of this bar
and i would promise
to send you the money and youd
be making our night complete
you would send me the money
your hand
for the greatest night in your life
thank you very much
so often ive been with people
and shared beautiful moments
iike traveling or staying up
all night and watching the sunrise
and i knew those were special moments
but something was always wrong
i wished id been with someone else
i knew that what i was feeling
exactly what was so important to me
they didnt understand
but im happy to be with you
you couldnt know
why a night like this
is so important
to my life right now
but it is
this is a great morning
it is a great morning
do you think we have others like this
what about our rational adult decision
oh yeah
i know what you mean about wishing
somebody wasnt there
its just usually its myself
that i wish i could get away from
seriously think about this
i have never been anywhere
that i havent been
ive never had a kiss
when i wasnt one of the kissers
you know ive never
gone to the movies when
i wasnt there in the audience
ive never been out bowling
if i wasnt there
making some stupid joke
thats why so many people
hate themselves seriously
its just they are sick to death
of being around themselves
lets say that you and l
were together all the time
youd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms
the way
the way every time
that we would have people over
id be insecure and id get
a little too drunk
or the way i tell the same stupid
pseudointellectual story
again and again
you see ive heard
all those stories
so of course im sick of myself
but being with you
its made me feel like
i was somebody else
i mean the only other way
to lose yourself like that is
you know dancing
or alcohol
or drugs or stuff like that
fucking
fucking yeah thats one way
do you know what i want
what
to be kissed
well i could do that
wait
i have to say something stupid
all right
its very stupid
i dont think we should
sleep together
i want to but since were never
going to see each other again
itll make me feel bad
ill wonder who else youre with
ill miss you
i know its not very adult
maybe its a female thing
i cant help it
lets see each other again
no i dont want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid
i dont want to just get laid
i want to i mean
i mean i think we should
we die in the morning right
i think we should
then its like some male fantasy
meet a french girl
fuck her and never see her again
and have this great story to tell
i dont want
this great evening to
just have been for that
okay we dont have to have sex
its not a big deal
you dont want to see me again
no of course i do
if somebody gave me
the choice right now
of to never see you again
or to marry you
i would marry you
maybe thats a lot
of romantic bullshit
but people have gotten married
for a lot less
actually
i think i decided i wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train
now that weve talked so much
i dont know anymore
why do we make everything
so complicated
i dont know
whats the first thing youll do
when you get back to paris
call my parents
what about you
i dont know ill probably go
pick up my dog hes with a friend
you have a dog
i love dogs
you do
yeah
oh shit
what
i dont know
were back in real time
i know i hate that
what is that
sounds like a harpsichord
check that out
somebodys playing
thats cool
can we dance to the harpsichord
of course
oh wow
im gonna take your picture
so i never forget you
or all this
okay me too
the years shall run like rabbits
what
nothing
i have
this recording of dylan thomas
reading a w h auden poem
hes got a great voice
its like
all the clocks in the city
began to whirr and chime
o let not time deceive you
you cannot conquer time
in headaches and in worry
vaguely life leaks away
and time will have his fancy
tomorrow or today
something like that
thats good
when you talked earlier
about after a few years
how a couple would begin
to hate each other
by anticipating their reactions
or getting tired
of their mannerisms
i think it would be
the opposite for me
i think i can really fall in love
when i know everything about someone
the way hes gonna part his hair
which shirt hes gonna
wear that day
knowing the exact story hed tell
in a given situation
im sure thats when i know
im really in love
hey guess what
what
we didnt go to those guys play
play
the cow
oh yeah we didnt
oh no we missed it
you know what bus to take
to the airport
no problem
i should get on this one
right here you wanna get on there
i guess this is it no
i really
you know
yeah i know me too
have a great life have fun
with everything youre gonna do
good luck with school and all that
i hate this
me too
the train is about to leave
you know all this bullshit
were talking about
not seeing each other
i dont want that
i dont either
you dont
i waited for you to say it
why didnt you say something
i was afraid
you didnt wanna see me
what do you wanna do
maybe we should meet here
in five years or something
five years thats a long time
its awful its like
a sociological experiment
how about one year
one year
how about six months
six months
its gonna be freezing
who cares we come here
we go somewhere else
six months from now or last night
last night six months
from last night which was
june 1 6th
