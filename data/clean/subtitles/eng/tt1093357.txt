quickly we must close the cage
welcome make
yourself at home

and young people make
rash decisions

vika are still alive
they are made up of
lethal wave energy
hide behind us
run run

the new gun is almost ready
the man who built it
thought we could microwave
their invisible shield
get the lead blankets
out of radiation

the stun gun it works
take the flanks
prepare to fight
they stopped before the water
the plan is not working
its vika

up signals from others around the globe
