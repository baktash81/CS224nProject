percy  dad 
dad 
dad  come on  let s go 
   rock music plays 
   people chatter 
look  it s up  it s up  it s up 
it s up  the review s up 
to the review  here we go 
  to you  baby  to you 
  here we go 
  my culinary hero 
  to the team 
 reads 
 gauloises   eager to please  
  whoo 
  yes 
 10 years ago  i had the
good fortune to dine
 at chef casper s revelatory
miami bistro  marrow  
  miami in the house 
  marrow  baby 
martin  that s your house 
 the sheer audacity of this fresh 
brave voice of the culinary scene
 reminded me why i write
about food as a vocation  
  martin  yeah   laughs 
  that s a lot of pressure 
 it is nearly impossible to separate
my glowing regard for chef casper
 and how much he inspired me from my
expectations as i sat down to dine
 at the recently remodelled
brentwood gallic staple  gauloises  
  yeah  this is good 
   oh  how times have changed 
 over the last decade  carl casper has
somehow managed to transform himself
 from the edgiest chef in miami
 to the needy aunt that gives
you  5 every time you see her
 in hopes that you will like her 
 but instead causes you to
shrink from her cloying embrace
 which threatens to smother you
in her saggy  moist cleavage 
 the signature app 
 intended to impress the
country club brunch crowd 
 is the caviar egg 
 a shirred egg topped
with a dollop of caviar
 is an excuse for the
chef to overcharge us
 for his insecurity and
lack of imagination 
 carl casper can best be summed
up by the first bite of his needy
 and yet by some miracle
also irrelevant
 chocolate lava cake 
 casper didn t even have the
courage to undercook the cake 
 thus curiously lacking its
signature molten centre  
 grunts 
 this sad dessert is emblematic
 of carl casper s
disappointing new chapter 
 his dramatic    weight
gain can only be explained
 by the fact that he must be eating
 all the food sent
back to the kitchen  
two stars 
i don t get it  i don t get it 
everyone loved it 
he loved it  even 
then why d he write all that mean
shit about me  about my food 
who cares  who cares 
i do   cause i could
have done better 
i should have cooked the
shit i was gonna cook 
you re ignoring the fact
that everyone was happy
and you re making a problem
where there s no problem 
it s not hard to make people happy 
there s certain things you could put on
a menu that ll make everybody happy 
if you put ahi tuna on a
menu  it will sell out 
it s guaranteed  you know that 
but i cooked the beef cheek 
which is a better dish 
and nobody wants to even try it 
  it was good  though 
  yeah  for family meal 
well  who you cooking for  though 
that s my point 
why do i have to pick 
why do i have to choose 
why can t i have both 
there are chefs that cook
food that they believe in
and people will try because
they re open to a new experience
and they ll end up liking it 
  what do you want me to say to you 
  the truth 
you want me to tell you
that you re the best chef
that i ever worked with 
and it s true  because you are 
you are  carl  you are the best
chef i ve ever worked with 
  ok 
  i mean it 
well  thank you 
you re welcome 
  we both agreed not to do that 
  i know 
why don t i just
cook you something 
oh  ok  fuck it  let s go 
  rudy  a message to you  plays 
mmm 
mom wants to talk to you 
  inez 
   woman speaks spanish 
inez 
 speaks spanish 
are you ok 
i got two stars 
getting two stars is good  right 
i mean  i don t read that
shit normally  but  you know 
then he starts writing all this
personal shit about me and   
how many people you got working 
you got  like  50 people 
and percy s 10 years old 
does he still need a nanny 
he s in school all day  what does
she even do here  hi  flora 
  hi  mr carl 
  i mean  what does he need   
  what s she doing here 
  you know that he s hurt  right 
because i was late  i already
apologised to him  we re fine 
late  he waited for you for
one hour alone outside 
well  i didn t realise
it was that long 
it s just    that
was the day that   
you re right 
i didn t like what
they wrote about you 
i didn t like it either 
it hurt  alright 
you ok 
i m alright 
good 
i m gonna make it up to him 
 kids scream 
 movie weapons blast 
 tyres screech

i have complete freedom to
cook whatever i want now 
i like my life 
and as far as your publicist goes 
when she calls back  you let her know
that i understand i shouldn t
tweet any pictures of my dick
and any career advice
should be kept to oneself

  i m excited 
  i m excited  i m finally happy 
i m happy  ok 
  am i allowed to be happy at work 
   door opens 
carl  carl  we re staying
with the same menu  right 
i have something really
good planned for tonight 
i m gonna let you   
it s not sweetbreads 
  you re gonna be able to taste it 
  that may be true 
but we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened 
  you realise that 
  i know  i was on twitter 
  yeah 
  i was promoting the restaurant 
  i was on twitter 
  what  yeah  that s another thing 
from now on  before you post
anything online  i ok it  alright 
the whole reason
everybody s here tonight
is because i called out
ramsey michel online
and they re all coming to
watch me stick it in his ass 
yeah  and you re gonna
twitter an apology
for calling the most respected
critic in los angeles an asshole 
  i m not gonna fucking apologise 
  what do you mean  you re not   
  you see what he wrote about me 
  i don t give a fuck   
  he started it 
    what he wrote  i don t care 
you re a cook  you re a chef 
this is what you ve been cooking
for years  and it works 
and either you cook the menu that
our customers have come to ex   
  you want me to cook the same food 
  the same exact   
the same food that he ripped apart 
the same guy who s coming tonight 
the restaurant isn t
filled with critics 
it s filled with people
that ve been eating your food
for the last 10 years 
so now  suddenly  you re
gonna be an artist 
well  be an artist
on your own time 
  listen to me 
  no sweetbreads 
  listen 
  no calves  brains 
i m not cooking sweetbreads 
listen to me 
the kitchen is my domain 
that was our deal 
i don t give a fuck
what the deal was 
the deal is now changed 
either you stay or you go 
it s up to you  end of discussion 
  we got a full house of people      yeah 
    who are coming tonight      yeah 
    to eat my food 
  no  it s not your food  carl 
it s not your food 
by definition  it s my food
because it s my restaurant 
i pay for the glasses 
i pay for the napkins 
i pay for the spoons 
i pay for molly s salary 
i pay for your entire
staff s salary  ok 
so you either cook
my menu or tony can 
tony  you ve been cooking
it half the time anyway 
tell the truth  right 
so you re threatening
to fire me now 
am i threatening to fire you 
no  i m telling you
what i m prepared to do
if you don t cook my menu 
subject closed 
well  why don t you cook
the menu without a chef
and we see how it goes tonight

i understand 
is there something we can do
to make you more comfortable 
um    could i actually   
could i speak with the chef

  um   
  if i may 
the last time i was in
napa  at the vineyard

bottle as a gift 
and i ve just been waiting
for the right occasion 
that    that s very
generous of you 
is chef casper here 
unfortunately  he was called away

  cavern  continues 
 laughs 
 phone camera clicks 
i need you out front  they re three
deep in the bar  get off the phone 
  please let me do my job 
  please go to the bar 
  tony 
  carl  i can t talk right now 
  we are in deep weeds 
  carl  this guy s tweeting me 
this guy s calling me out online 
what the fuck are you serving 
i don t know  they re
serving the same shit 
  what s he eating 
  i think he s   
  what course is he on 
  he s   
he s eating the chocolate
lava cake right now 
you just keep him right
where the fuck he is 
  what  
  i m parking the car 
  carl  what 
  don t let him leave 
keep the motherfucker there 
is he here  is the
fucker still here 
  oh  fuck 
  let s go into the back of the house 
i just wanna say one thing  i just
wanna say one thing  just one thing 
riva  let s go to the kitchen 
stop it  stop it for a second 
let s just   
i ve been waiting to talk to
this prick for a long time 
  ok 
  i am not cloying  i am not needy 
i don t care what you think 
you re not getting to me 
i m not needy 
chocolate lava cake is not just
undercooked chocolate cake 
that s not what makes
the centre molten 
you take a frozen cylinder of ganache
and you set it in the ramekin
so that as the outside cooks
fully  the inside becomes molten 
ok  ok 
it s fucking molten  see 
its fucking molten  you asshole 
and you don t do anything 
what do you do 
you sit and you eat and you
vomit those words back 
to make people laugh 
you know how hard i
work for this shit 
do you know how hard
my whole staff works 
what sacrifices i make
to make you happy
and then you just smugly just
fucking shit on my shit 
riva  ok 
  it hurts 
  yes 
it fucking hurts when
you write that shit 
  it hurt you 
  it does  it does 
he was    he thought you were gonna
close his fucking restaurant down 
you asshole 
and what do you  you just
write shit to make   
you just make shit up 
it was molten 
it s fucking molten 
asshole 
  you re not getting to me 
  riva  ok  ok 
  you re not getting to me 
  ok  carl 
  he s not getting to me 
  no  he s not 
i know  but you re a publicist 
don t you have relationships 
isn t that what you re hired to do 
to take these things off the internet 
but it s out there 
even if i could persuade one
site to pull down one clip 
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones 
what should we    should
we at least lawyer up
and threaten legal
action or something 
you threatening them with
lawyers builds on a story
that s already getting
a lot of play 
and then you get another
week of headlines 
and then you got this food critic
posting fresh blogs about you nonstop 
and they re all getting picked
up  and the picked up headlines
are getting picked
up by each other 
you know  it s
absolutely unbelievable 
  so   
  i ve never seen anything like   
wait a second    you re saying
there s nothing i could do 
to get the footage down 
no  that lives forever 
great  awesome 
but there just might be
an opportunity here 
how can this possibly
be an opportunity 
well  i was holding
off until we spoke 
but i m fairly certain we have
a good shot at  hell s kitchen  
  wait  what 
  the reality show 
i don t think you understand
what s going on here 
i m a real chef with   
  you said you needed money  right 
  a job 
a job  not money 
i need a job  like i had 
well  your twitter account says
you ve got 20 000 followers 
  that s pretty damn big 
  yeah  i m gonna cancel the account 
  don t worry 
  don t cancel it 
i can get you money to
mention a few products 
are you listening  i don t wanna
get involved with any of that 
  i wanna cook food 
  you got two choices 
you can either lean into it
and work it for all it s worth   
like honey boo boo 
i don t want that 
you know how much she
pulls down  or her mother 
i don t care what she makes 
get to your point 
or go underground and wait till the
storm passes  you got two choices 
i thought this shit
lives forever online 
it does  but there s so much
news out there and it s so fast
and there s so much white noise 
nobody remembers anything 
ok  thank you for taking the time
and walking me through everything 
it was very illuminating 
oh  you re hanging up  ok  listen

if you can t get me  i m on a
cell phone and i ve got a pager

what exactly are you doing here 
i m  uh    eating the food 
i m eating your food 
i thought my food was
needy and cloying 
well  i didn t think
you d want to serve me 
so i sent somebody
else to pick it up 
what happened between us 
that really knocked me for a loop 
i mean  you robbed me of my pride
and my career and my dignity 
and i know people like you don t
usually care about that kind of thing 
that s not necessarily true 
but you should know 
it hurts people like me 
   cause we re really trying 
  you started a flame war with me 
are you kidding me  i buy
ink by the barrel  buddy 
what are you doing
picking a fight with me 
i wouldn t challenge
you to a cook off 
i thought i was sending
you a private message 
i didn t know that 
i thought we were having fun 
it was theatre  by the way 
what the fuck were you cooking 
you totally shat the bed  buddy 
how could i back that 
you were one of my early boys 
i had no control over the menu 
whatever the case  ok  you seem
to be cooking for yourself again 
because this shit is sensational 
i mean  really  really good 
thank you 
i m not gonna write about it 
yeah  i understand 
because i d like to back you 
excuse me 
i wanna bankroll you 
and i can t write about anything
i have a vested interest in 
i m not sure i get
what s going on here 
i sold my website for
a whole lot of money
and i ve just put in a
bid on a place on rose 
it s zoned  it s permitted  you could
build it out however you like 
and you can cook whatever you like 
take your time  think about it 
i wouldn t blame you for
having a few trust issues 
but i just thought that  you know 
you and me burying the hatchet
might be a good story 
reservations out the door 
more importantly  you know  you
just cook your ass off in there 
in the meantime  you just
tweet me wherever you are
and i ll come running 
 cause this shit s good  alright 
delicious 
delicioso 
mucho goodo 
  hey  jefe 
  yeah 
that was a lot of talking
and you not punching him

  right here is the hot spot 
so you re controlling it all the time 
you re always controlling 
and you re looking  you re looking 
as soon as you get your good colour   
this is now where you start it 
you start to really build
the sandwich itself 
a light scrape 
so you can see  the whole
sandwich starts to evolve 
and  see  the cheese is
starting to evolve too 
yes  you can do it  there you go 
getting in there 
you re almost   
even now  as you get further  jon 
you re getting in 
like  assertive now 
you re changing   
even your grip s here 
  mm hm 
  changing your positions 
you re moving around 
but you re not too
busy with it  you re   
you re precise  but then
sometimes you step back 
  nothing else exists except this 
  right
