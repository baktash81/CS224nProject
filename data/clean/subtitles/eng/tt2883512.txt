people say that ive found a way
to make you say that you love me

its a natural fact
that i wanna come back
show me where its at
baby yeah
im so tired of being alone
im so tired
percy dad
dad
dad come on lets go
rock music plays
people chatter
look its up its up its up
its up the reviews up
to the review here we go
to you baby to you
here we go
my culinary hero
to the team
reads
gauloises  eager to please
whoo
yes
10 years ago i had the
good fortune to dine
at chef caspers revelatory
miami bistro marrow
miami in the house
marrow baby
martin thats your house
the sheer audacity of this fresh
brave voice of the culinary scene
reminded me why i write
about food as a vocation
martin yeah laughs
thats a lot of pressure
it is nearly impossible to separate
my glowing regard for chef casper
and how much he inspired me from my
expectations as i sat down to dine
at the recently remodelled
brentwood gallic staple gauloises
yeah this is good
oh how times have changed
over the last decade carl casper has
somehow managed to transform himself
from the edgiest chef in miami
to the needy aunt that gives
you 5 every time you see her
in hopes that you will like her
but instead causes you to
shrink from her cloying embrace
which threatens to smother you
in her saggy moist cleavage
the signature app
intended to impress the
country club brunch crowd
is the caviar egg
a shirred egg topped
with a dollop of caviar
is an excuse for the
chef to overcharge us
for his insecurity and
lack of imagination
carl casper can best be summed
up by the first bite of his needy
and yet by some miracle
also irrelevant
chocolate lava cake
casper didnt even have the
courage to undercook the cake
thus curiously lacking its
signature molten centre
grunts
this sad dessert is emblematic
of carl caspers
disappointing new chapter
his dramatic weight
gain can only be explained
by the fact that he must be eating
all the food sent
back to the kitchen
two stars
i dont get it i dont get it
everyone loved it
he loved it even
then whyd he write all that mean
shit about me about my food
who cares who cares
i do cause i could
have done better
i should have cooked the
shit i was gonna cook
youre ignoring the fact
that everyone was happy
and youre making a problem
where theres no problem
its not hard to make people happy
theres certain things you could put on
a menu thatll make everybody happy
if you put ahi tuna on a
menu it will sell out
its guaranteed you know that
but i cooked the beef cheek
which is a better dish
and nobody wants to even try it
it was good though
yeah for family meal
well who you cooking for though
thats my point
why do i have to pick
why do i have to choose
why cant i have both
there are chefs that cook
food that they believe in
and people will try because
theyre open to a new experience
and theyll end up liking it
what do you want me to say to you
the truth
you want me to tell you
that youre the best chef
that i ever worked with
and its true because you are
you are carl you are the best
chef ive ever worked with
ok
i mean it
well thank you
youre welcome
we both agreed not to do that
i know
why dont i just
cook you something
oh ok fuck it lets go
rudy a message to you plays
mmm
mom wants to talk to you
inez
woman speaks spanish
inez
speaks spanish
are you ok
i got two stars
getting two stars is good right
i mean i dont read that
shit normally but you know
then he starts writing all this
personal shit about me and
how many people you got working
you got like 50 people
and percys 10 years old
does he still need a nanny
hes in school all day what does
she even do here hi flora

i mean what does he need
whats she doing here
you know that hes hurt right
because i was late i already
apologised to him were fine

one hour alone outside

even if i could persuade one
site to pull down one clip
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones
what should we should
we at least lawyer up
and threaten legal
action or something
you threatening them with
lawyers builds on a story
thats already getting
a lot of play
and then you get another
week of headlines

posting fresh blogs about you nonstop
and theyre all getting picked
up and the pickedup headlines
are getting picked
up by each other

well i didnt think
youd want to serve me
so i sent somebody
else to pick it up
what happened between us
that really knocked me for a loop
i mean you robbed me of my pride
and my career and my dignity
and i know people like you dont
usually care about that kind of thing
thats not necessarily true
but you should know
it hurts people like me
cause were really trying
you started a flame war with me
are you kidding me i buy
ink by the barrel buddy
what are you doing
picking a fight with me
i wouldnt challenge
you to a cookoff
i thought i was sending
you a private message
i didnt know that
i thought we were having fun
it was theatre by the way
what the fuck were you cooking
you totally shat the bed buddy
how could i back that
you were one of my early boys
i had no control over the menu
whatever the case ok you seem
to be cooking for yourself again
because this shit is sensational
i mean really really good
thank you
im not gonna write about it

because id like to back you
excuse me
i wanna bankroll you

i have a vested interest in
im not sure i get
whats going on here
i sold my website for
a whole lot of money
and ive just put in a
bid on a place on rose
its zoned its permitted you could
build it out however you like
and you can cook whatever you like
take your time think about it
i wouldnt blame you for
having a few trust issues
but i just thought that you know
you and me burying the hatchet
might be a good story
reservations out the door
more importantly you know you
just cook your ass off in there
in the meantime you just
tweet me wherever you are
and ill come running
cause this shits good alright
delicious
delicioso

so youre controlling it all the time
youre always controlling
and youre looking youre looking
as soon as you get your good colour
this is now where you start it
you start to really build
the sandwich itself
a light scrape
so you can see the whole
sandwich starts to evolve
and see the cheese is
starting to evolve too
yes you can do it there you go
getting in there
youre almost
even now as you get further jon
youre getting in
like assertive now
youre changing
even your grips here
mmhm
changing your positions
youre moving around
but youre not too
busy with it youre
youre precise but then
sometimes you step back
nothing else exists except this
right
