swept off my feet today
now she might say
this is a really bad time for me
or something like i just need some space
or my personal favorite
im really into my career right now
you believe that neither does she
you know why
because shes lying to you thats why
you understand me lying
its not a bad time for her
she doesnt need any space
she may be into her career
but what shes really saying is
get away from me now
or possibly try harder stupid
well which one is it
60 of all human communication
is nonverbal
body language
30 is your tone
so that means that
90 of what youre saying
aint coming out of your mouth
toby
shit
of course shell lie to you
shes a nice person
she doesnt wanna hurt your feelings
what else is she gonna say
she doesnt even know you
yet
luckily the fact is
that just like the rest of us
even a beautiful woman doesnt know
what she wants until she sees it
and thats where i come in
my job is to open her eyes
oh my god
is this what youre looking for
basic principles no matter what
no matter when no matter who
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet
just needs the right broom
you cannot use what you do not have
so if youre shy be shy
if youre outgoing be outgoing
im not outgoing
thats okay
she may not want the whole truth
but she does want the real you
she may not want to see it all at once
but she does want to see it
so tonight when youre wondering what
to say how you look or if she likes you
just remember she is already out with you
that means she said yes
when she could have said no
that means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off
so that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you
it is your job not to mess it up
the shoes are hot
you went to the place i told you
yeah but i dont think theyre really me
you is a very fluid concept right now
you bought the shoes
you look great in the shoes
thats the you im talking about
the key tonight is hang back
give her plenty of space
if she lingers at a photograph move on
but maintain the visual
its supposed to be 64 and clear tonight
so when you leave the club walk a little
ask her what she thought about the show
what was her favorite photograph
why that one
and when she answers
dont be looking at her mouth
dont be wondering
what she looks like naked
listen to what she is saying and respond
listen and respond
that way when its your turn to talk
youll have something better to say than
i like your mouth
what was your favorite one
the elephant definitely
and all of a sudden
were on date number two
ready
no way
were going back in there
you have to smile
in case you didnt go to high school
hitting is a good thing
so how does it happen great love
are you okay
nobody knows
im good
let me get a bomb pop
and a screwball for the lady
but what i can tell you
is that it happens in the blink of an eye
one moment youre enjoying your life
and the next youre wondering
how you ever lived without them
three dates is all i need
three dates and ill get you here
to the highstakes medal round
where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss
will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship
after that youre on your own
but always remember
life is not the amount of breaths you take
its the moments that take your breath away
did i call it or did i call it
i mean what did i say six months
and when was her first date
so fiveandahalf
god i hate it when im right
what is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks
even when theyre going out with
someone as awesome as allegra cole
shes only the most fabulous thing
walking around new york
thanks young
are you kidding
of course im gonna run it
why should she waste her heart
on some swedish aristobrat
even if he is gorgeous
if hes stupid enough to cheat
the world should know
hes dumb enough to get caught
exactly im in the elevator
see you in a minute
good morning how are you
bitter party of one
you should try it sometime
barbados by myself
i wouldnt last five minutes
it was just what the doctor ordered
i slept in i did my yoga
i read a couple of books
flirted with my scuba instructor
and apparently never left the office
i know isnt that great
you shouldve taken someone with you
who am i gonna take with me
this is where a boyfriend comes in handy
i dont have time for a boyfriend
you said that two years ago
yes and its as true today as it was then
i thought you were on vacation
see if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour
besides relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along
spoken like a true cynic
im not a cynic im a realist
you are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist
what are you doing here
what is she doing here
she works here remember
no she doesnt not for another four days
this couldnt wait
it could
what are you doing go back to the beach
i dont want you here
no really you do
you are becoming
a sick workaholic lunatic
and this is exactly
the kind of nervous overwrought behavior
that leads to
pictures of sebby with a busty brunette
a very big raise
jesus you could find dirt in a snowstorm
comes with the job
you know kiddo there is more to life
than watching other people live it
can i help he was cheating on my beach
i think its great
that youre so good at your job
im just a little worried as to why
let me worry about that
okay i want that column on my desk
by lunch
so youll pay for my hotel
for you to sip mai tais
i dont think so get out
come on
what
thats good right
no
no it was in and it freaked out
you know what your problem is hitch
youre all about the short game
you pick your shots
based on what you see first
not whats necessarily best for you
in the long run
all of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby
you know im very happy for you
just not meant for everybody
so please just leave me to my hot sweaty
totally varied wildly experimental
short game
i was talking about pool but whatever
yeah okay
honestly i just hope one day
youre able to experience
the unconditional love trust
and openness
that i share with grace every single day
is this really barroom talk
you need to listen to me im serious
because when you get to a place
with a woman like that
its so beyond anything physical that
when i think back to
when i used to run around with you
and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women
i dont know its kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic
yeah i see what you mean thats pathetic
so howd you meet him
i was in la perla
just buying some weekend thongs
and he was doing likewise
no
actually he said he was buying something
for his mom
his mom
casey who buys highpriced lingerie
for their mother
well maybe he was looking for a robe
casey he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman
i prefer the mother story
i know you do but thats not the point
no the point is im not gonna start out
assuming the guys a liar
why not
because thats how you wind up
like me is that what you were gonna say
no i was gonna say like you
whats his name
why
im gonna google him
no google your own guy
lets just see if his mothers still alive
so when is grace due again
soon
you excited
whatd you say
do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here
no dont do that
are you saying you dont wanna talk to them
because you cant go home with them
im just trying to keep my head above water
have you heard of the date doctor
urban myth
really
absolutely
i was hoping he also helped women
casey youre not sick youre single
you just have to relax and enjoy the ride
i havent been ridden in months
on that happy note im gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight
you mean besides me
right
bye
ill go get those girls
bring them over here
and well have a conversation
like human beings
then youre gonna home
and ill take them back to my apartment
well that sounds like fun for me
but you might want to get in line pal
hey girl
hey how are you
hey baby can i get a couple coronas
at the pool table please thanks
excuse me
lime wedges in the bottles fine
hey asshole i dont work here
im sorry the paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth sweetheart
just dont let it happen again
i knew you didnt work here
you did
how else was i supposed to get you away
from all those guys
why would you want to do that
some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex
they like women women like them
everything flows naturally
back in college i was just not one of them
i seemed to lack the basic understanding
that my peers just intuitively grasped
but like any late bloomer
i was eager to make up for lost time
her name was cressida baylor
can you tell me
where the registration building is
and my life would never be the same
im alex
cressida
what we had was beautiful
i love you
i love you so much
i love you too alex
i know you dont love me
as much as i love you
but thats okay
im just glad you love me at all
in retrospect
i guess i may have come on a little strong
but the experience taught me a lot
cressida
what are you doing
im sorry alex
but i love you what did i do wrong
just tell me what i did wrong
youre doing it right now
alex im sorry
and its an education
i feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men
because with no guile and no game
theres no girl
if ever a man born was without game
it was albert brennaman
my business is 100 referral
and thus far untraceable
and if theres one thing ive learned
when you orchestrate coordinate
and otherwise mess with fate
its best to fly under the radar
i hope shes single
cause i dont do breakups
hi thank you for seeing me
yeah no
i mean she just got out of a relationship
is that a problem
because if it is thats fine
im a little uncomfortable with this anyway
definitely been hurt a lot
i had a lot of bad experiences
some good ones
but definitely a lot of bad ones
im desperate basically
i mean not in general you understand
you know not just for anybody
but man for her yeah
why dont you tell me about her
lets see what can i say
my company handles her finances
im her tax consultant
well im one of them
im the junior man on the account
so does she know youre interested
no
alive
i lent her my pen once
shoot does anyone have a pen
here take mine
albert youre crushing my arm
sorry about that here you go allegra
allegra as in allegra cole
yeah i realize that im not her usual type
well her last boyfriend owned sweden
or something
and that guy was a bum
he didnt seem like
a very nice person to me
you swing for the fence
look you dont think i tried
talking myself out of this
i mean you dont think i know
how ridiculous this is i know okay
i just thought that maybe with your help
you know what
im really sorry i wasted your time
hold on a second albert
you know what its like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless
feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man
but at the same time
hoping that she still finds happiness
even if its never gonna be with you
you are flatout
out of your mind you know that
thats good
it is
you ever heard of michelangelo
heard of the sistine chapel
michelangelo
sistine chapel
you saying you can do this
my name is alex hitchens
lets go paint that ceiling
take it easy
oh my god
well it looks like im still rich
but what i would really like
and what i was wondering is
if i could have 500000
to invest on my own
and what were you thinking
of investing in allegra
well its something
that i really have a passion for
daydreams are for private time
when youre in the room be in the room
concentrate focus
women respond when you respond to them
my friend maggie is a talented designer
ive seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic
and i would really like to get involved
ill tell you what
let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in
and next month
well run the whole lot of them by you
okay
fine thank you all right gentlemen
lets go over this one more time
what is the objective
shock and awe
that was shockingly awful
what is the objective
shock and awe
what is the objective
excuse me sir
yes albert
i dont really agree with that
you dont really agree with what
i think if you want to invest 500000
in your friends business
thats exactly what you should do
you dont need us to tell you what to do
were a board of advisers
not your kindergarten teachers
if you want to be taken seriously
as an adult
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money
from a boardroom
full of your daddys golf buddies
thats quite enough
im not finished
id like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity
that shes had to deal with her whole life
with half her class
we should be taking advice from you
miss cole not the other way around
sit down
no you know what i quit
oh my god
just breathe howd it go
i yelled at her i screamed at my boss
i quit my job
what
you said
i gotta go back
no i didnt tell you to quit
relax okay listen were fine
would you let me go
albert no
just relax okay
just let it marinate for a second trust me
no
relax
its allegra cole
answer it
could i speak to you a second
answer the door albert
yes hi
whats up
listen albert right
people dont usually talk to me like that
close your mouth man
let me rephrase that
people never talk to me like that
stand up
i guess its kind of scary for them
but thats why i really appreciate
what you did in there
but i was wondering
do you think that you and i could
get together sometime this week
you know to go over things
financial things
id like to see the areas
where i can afford to take some risks
check your schedule
ill check my schedule
great let me give you my number
do you have a pen
i dont think i have one
yes i do
great
and call me allegra
youre done
goodbye
good job
oh damn
shes some kind of newspaper columnist
comes in here once in a while great tipper
whats her drink
usually beer
tonight grey goose martini dirty
hi
i noticed your glass was getting low
so i took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini
thank you
and i couldnt help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend
whats your name
they call me chip
you cant get them to stop
that was funny
listen i understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air
so dont take the following personally
you have fantastic eyes
thanks try to listen
this is no reflection on you
im just not interested
but thank you for the compliment
of coming over
youre welcome
so do you like cuban food
chip seriously that was not code for
i wish youd try harder
are you always so shutdown and afraid
that the right man might make you
feel like a natural woman
sorry im late honey
i couldnt get a cab how was the meeting
well there was a beginning
a middle and an end
nice to meet you chip
you too
on the one hand
it is very difficult for a man
to even speak to someone
who looks like you
but on the other hand
should that be your problem
so lifes kind of hard all around
not if you pay attention
youre sending all the right signals
no earrings heels under two inches
your hair is pulled back
wearing reading glasses with no book
drinking a grey goose martini
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldnt do it
if that wasnt clear enough
theres always the fuck off
that you have stamped on your forehead
whod believe theres a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesnt know
and genuinely be interested in who she is
what she does without his own agenda
i wouldnt even know
what that would look like
so what would a guy like that say
hed say my name is alex hitchens
and im a consultant
but she wouldnt be interested in that
because shed be counting the seconds
until he left
thinking he was like every other guy
which life experience has taught her
is a virtual certainty
but then hed ask her name
and what she did for a living
and she might blow him off
or she might say
im sara melas
i run the gossip column at the standard
and then hed ask
all these penetrating questions about her
because he was sincerely
if atypically interested
no
no
hed be interested
but hed see that there was no way
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real
well he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original
wouldnt help
dont you hate it when that happens
not really
theyd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward
my guess is theyd do just fine
its a pleasure to have met you sara melas
grey goose martini
from the gentleman who just left
is that for me
what
vance munson sorry im late
no not a problem
wow youre the
can i get you something to drink mr
no im fine thank you
so tell me about her
have you ever met someone
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you
not just because of her looks
but that x factor
howd you meet her
actually i was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom
and by that of course you mean
you were buying lingerie
for another woman
yes you cant help
where you meet somebody
and the lingerie is for a woman
im no longer seeing
but anyway the girl i met
the one i was talking about
shes so sweet funny southern
she gives me her number
now she wont return my phone calls
i dont know what it is about her
i just cant get her out of my mind
you know food has lost its taste
colors they seem dull
things that used to matter
i dont know they just no longer do
i think things arent gonna snap back
unless i
unless i bang her
excuse me
you know bang her clear my head
get in get off get out
i think you may have misunderstood
what i do exactly
no i was told you help guys get in there
right but see heres the thing
my clients actually like women
hit it and quit it is not my thing
let me make one thing clear to you rabbi
i need professional help
well that is for damn certain
and im glad you can admit it
because generally thats the hardest part
you see what im doing
this is what im about
power suit power tie power steering
people can wince cry beg
but eventually they do what i want
so thats like a metaphor
well im more of a literal kind of guy
so when i do this
this is more like me saying
that i will literally break your shit off
if you ever touch me again okay pumpkin
got it
no
pablo i cant just mention your restaurant
somebody has to eat there
no somebody famous you know that
sara melas
no
okay bye
i need your signature
i hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number
so this is me not calling over
yes youre right
this is much less invasive
ive been thinking about
that sign on your forehead
and i was wondering if youd mind
taking it down for dinner friday night over
i cant i have a couple of parties
i have to hit
gossip never sleeps
not till about 400 a m
saturday
i have a date
do you know the definition
of perseverance miss melas
an excuse to be obnoxious
continuing in a course of action
without regard to discouragement
opposition or previous failure over
okay webster how do i get rid of you
breakfast sunday
and you can barely even call that a date
you do that with outoftown relatives
that you dont even like over
come on
okay i guess i could do sunday
you forgot to say over  over
this conversations over
as soon as you tell me when and where
700 a m north cove marina over and out
700 a m are you crazy
i dont do 700 a m
hello

what
you said sunday right
yeah
what if i would have said friday
sunday
so i guess youre not going to church
do you really expect me to wear this
itll be awful cold out there without it
good morning
good would have been at 1000
youre a lot taller than i remember
you ever ride one of these
not on the hudson
so what do you wanna do
race me around the statue of liberty
if theres time
but you might need these
all right
bam
wow
how do i look
fabulous
all right i give
where do i change
so well go past the wall then take a left
its pretty much a straight shot from there
straight shot to where
thats for me to know and you to find out
what you do with these babies is
yeah what i do with this baby
is kick your ass
what happened you change your mind
it just died
did you put gas in it
no you know i think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something
gross try it again
you want me to call aaa

and let me hop on with you
i dont know what if you break mine too
then well both be sitting ducks
i didnt break it it just died
yeah yeah

scoot back
hitch im already here
but you dont know where were going
why dont you tell me
then well both know
man male egos
i dont know how you guys
make it through the day with them
what it is not my ego
i just dont want to ruin the surprise
im sorry are you all right
there i always keep a few of those around
thank you
i have lower back trouble
i just shove the ice packs right down there
no thats a fresh one
so ellis island
i have to admit i have lived in new york
my whole life and ive never been here
i figured that most people havent
so i got my man larry here
to set us up a private tour
great
anything for hitch
it was originally known as oyster island
the island was expanded
to its present size
with dirt removed during the construction
of the new york subway system
are you serious
yes
did you know this
yeah thats why i brought you here
in fact over 100 million americans
can trace their ancestry
back to a single man woman or child
on the ships manifest
to an inspectors ledger
by 1910 75 of the residents of new york
chicago detroit cleveland and boston
were immigrants
or the children of immigrants
they generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities
in little italys chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves
its called the kissing post
the plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences
now what exactly would qualify
as a long absence
i mean
that count
no
i actually had a relative come through here
really
yeah
what
what
what was that thing
no you know i was just thinking
you cant really know where youre going
until you know where youve been
aint that right larry
amen brother
thats kind of deep for a first date
dont you think
what is that
oh my god
thats my greatgreatgrandfather
thats his signature
jesus its right here
how did you know
hitch did the search i just found the page
im sorry
i saw that going differently in my mind
so my family never saw him again
well except for on the wanted posters
look im really sorry
when i saw it on the computer
it said the butcher of cádiz
i thought it was a profession
not a headline
its just one of those horrible family legacies
weve all tried to forget
but thank you
no it was
a train wreck
no
let me get you a cab
thanks
bye
byebye
taxi
poor guy
sounds like he went to a lot of trouble
it was fun in a disastrous kind of way
i mean this isnt exactly a hickey
at least you got a good story
out of it right
right
you should try mine its great
wait youre seeing him again
well look you said that
im always expecting men
to let me down right
assuming that theyre gonna fail
which he did
yeah but he did it with flair
i mean case he really tanked
and thats a desirable trait
yeah weird huh
now just keep it simple
just like we practiced
were just leaving a message
women like allegra cole
dont pick up numbers they dont recognize
hello
shes on the phone
yes hello miss cole

hi there
this was a fantastic idea
i suppose hey wheres maggie

tonight i want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg
do you know why i want you to do that
because im cool
no
i know im not
im saying that you are an iceberg
in that over 90 of your mass
is below the surface
i know im heavy i am
im talking about who you are
its a metaphor
accounting business
all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper richer albert
one more
its gonna be loud in there
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier
in a nonsleazy way
so get to where its loudest
ask her if shed like a drink
lean in place your hand
on the small of her back
and say it in her ear like a secret
watch your hand placement
too high says i just wanna be friends
too low says i just wanna grab some ass
friends ass me
special issues allegra cole is a celebrity
which means that when people talk to her
theyll ignore you completely
shes classy so shell introduce you
when she does shake hands hard
and speak up let them know youre there
show her you can handle being her escort
egon this is albert
how you doing
albert this is zak
nice to see you
these guys are friends with maggie
been to that new brazilian restaurant
no but i am
its disgusting
im writing an article about it
did you see the new installation at moma
yes did you think
disgusting
women can always tell
when youre not being real with them
worst thing you can do is try to fake it
because you are a great guy
and you do have something
to offer allegra that no other man does
what was your name eggnog
egon
what do you think of the design of the jets
new football stadium on the west side
let me guess disgusting
think it over well be back
thank you i cant stand those guys
really i kind of liked them
but when all is said and done
tonight is not about allegra
its not
no tonight is about maggie
a womans best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions
so you cant afford to mess this up
albert i want you to meet
my friend maggie
hi maggie
its an absolute pleasure to meet you
im maggie
no youre not
actually i am
magnus forester
thank you so much for inviting us
you have very soft hands
thank you
wow so do you

so tonight you focus on one thing
and one thing only
maggie
where does your inspiration come from
oh my god
anything i see
something in a magazine
out on the street
in an old movie
the receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me
anybody want any spring rolls
thats a beautiful tie by the way
this whole thing it just works
thank you
is he gay
i dont think so
i like him
about the deejay
generally i have a firm nodancing policy
but if she asks you cannot say no
im not worried about dancing
but if there are people there

is that a problem
its not a problem but this is allegra cole
eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship
and believe me
she has definitely thought about it
she has
of course
not that shes gonna act on it
so its no real big deal
all right its no big deal then
its a very big deal
huge
monumental
you are not listening
i need you to wrap your head around this
tomorrow night allegra cole
could have her last first kiss
all right come on

a woman that doesnt want a kiss
takes her keys out puts them in the door
goes in the house
a woman that wants to kiss she fiddles
im fiddling

you see what im doing
robbing me
no
this is what most guys do
they rush in to take the kiss
but youre not most guys
see the secret to a kiss
is to go 90 of the way
and then hold
for how long
as long as it takes
for her to come the other 10
okay 9010 got it
