swept off my feet today   
now  she might say 
 this is a really bad time for me   
or something like   i just need some space   
or my personal favorite 
 i m really into my career right now   
you believe that  neither does she 
you know why 
because she s lying to you  that s why 
you understand me  lying 
it s not a bad time for her 
she doesn t need any space 
she may be into her career   
but what she s really saying is 
 get away from me now   
or possibly   try harder  stupid   
well  which one is it 
60  of all human communication
is nonverbal 
body language 
30  is your tone 
so that means that
90  of what you re saying   
ain t coming out of your mouth 
toby 
shit 
of course she ll lie to you 
she s a nice person 
she doesn t wanna hurt your feelings 
what else is she gonna say 
she doesn t even know you 
yet 
luckily  the fact is
that just like the rest of us   
even a beautiful woman doesn t know
what she wants until she sees it 
and that s where i come in 
my job is to open her eyes 
oh  my god 
is this what you re looking for 
basic principles  no matter what 
no matter when  no matter who   
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet 
just needs the right broom 
you cannot use what you do not have 
so if you re shy  be shy 
if you re outgoing  be outgoing 
  i m not outgoing 
  that s okay 
she may not want the whole truth 
but she does want the real you 
she may not want to see it all at once 
but she does want to see it 
so tonight  when you re wondering what
to say  how you look  or if she likes you   
just remember  she is already out with you 
that means she said yes
when she could have said no 
that means she made a plan
when she could have just blown you off 
so that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you 
it is your job not to mess it up 
the shoes are hot 
you went to the place i told you 
yeah  but i don t think they re really me 
 you  is a very fluid concept right now 
you bought the shoes 
you look great in the shoes 
that s the you i m talking about 
the key tonight is hang back 
give her plenty of space 
if she lingers at a photograph  move on 
but maintain the visual 
it s supposed to be 64 and clear tonight 
so when you leave the club  walk a little 
ask her what she thought about the show   
what was her favorite photograph 
why that one 
and when she answers 
don t be looking at her mouth 
don t be wondering
what she looks like naked 
listen to what she is saying and respond 
listen and respond 
that way  when it s your turn to talk   
you ll have something better to say than 
 i like your mouth   
what was your favorite one 
the elephant  definitely 
and all of a sudden 
we re on date number two 
ready 
no way 
we re going back in there 
you have to smile 
in case you didn t go to high school 
hitting is a good thing 
so how does it happen  great love 
are you okay 
  nobody knows 
  i m good 
let me get a bomb pop
and a screwball for the lady 
but what i can tell you 
is that it happens in the blink of an eye 
one moment  you re enjoying your life 
and the next  you re wondering
how you ever lived without them 
three dates is all i need 
three dates  and i ll get you here 
to the high stakes medal round   
where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss   
will tell them everything they need to know
about the relationship 
after that  you re on your own 
but always remember   
life is not the amount of breaths you take 
it s the moments that take your breath away 
did i call it or did i call it 
i mean  what did i say  six months 
and when was her first date 
so five and a half 
god  i hate it when i m right 
what is it about guys that makes them
want to screw anything that walks   
even when they re going out with
someone as awesome as allegra cole 
she s only the most fabulous thing
walking around new york 
thanks  young 
are you kidding 
of course i m gonna run it 
why should she waste her heart
on some swedish aristo brat 
even if he is gorgeous 
if he s stupid enough to cheat   
the world should know
he s dumb enough to get caught 
exactly  i m in the elevator 
see you in a minute 
good morning  how are you 
bitter  party of one 
you should try it sometime 
barbados by myself 
i wouldn t last five minutes 
it was just what the doctor ordered 
i slept in  i did my yoga 
i read a couple of books   
flirted with my scuba instructor 
  and apparently never left the office 
  i know  isn t that great 
you should ve taken someone with you 
who am i gonna take with me 
this is where a boyfriend comes in handy 
  i don t have time for a boyfriend 
  you said that two years ago 
yes  and it s as true today as it was then 
i thought you were on vacation 
see if these are in focus
and have them in my desk in an hour 
besides  relationships are for people
waiting for something better to come along 
spoken like a true cynic 
i m not a cynic  i m a realist 
you are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist 
what are you doing here 
what is she doing here 
she works here  remember 
no  she doesn t  not for another four days 
  this couldn t wait 
  it could 
what are you doing  go back to the beach 
  i don t want you here 
  no  really  you do 
you are becoming
a sick  workaholic lunatic   
and this is exactly   
the kind of nervous  overwrought behavior
that leads to   
pictures of sebby with a busty brunette 
a very big raise 
jesus  you could find dirt in a snowstorm 
comes with the job 
you know  kiddo  there is more to life
than watching other people live it 
can i help he was cheating on my beach 
i think it s great
that you re so good at your job 
i m just a little worried as to why 
let me worry about that 
okay  i want that column on my desk
by lunch 
so you ll pay for my hotel 
for you to sip mai tais 
i don t think so  get out 
  come on 
  what 
  that s good  right 
  no 
no  it was in and it freaked out 
you know what your problem is  hitch 
you re all about the short game 
you pick your shots
based on what you see first   
not what s necessarily best for you   
in the long run 
all of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby 
you know  i m very happy for you 
just not meant for everybody 
so please just leave me to my hot  sweaty   
totally varied  wildly experimental
short game 
  i was talking about pool  but whatever 
  yeah  okay 
honestly  i just hope one day
you re able to experience   
the unconditional love  trust 
and openness   
that i share with grace every single day 
  is this really barroom talk 
  you need to listen to me  i m serious 
because when you get to a place
with a woman like that   
it s so beyond anything physical that   
when i think back to
when i used to run around with you   
and chase all these really gorgeous
but shallow women   
i don t know  it s kind of ridiculous
and vaguely pathetic 
yeah  i see what you mean  that s pathetic 
so  how d you meet him 
i was in la perla
just buying some weekend thongs 
  and he was doing likewise 
  no 
actually  he said he was buying something
for his mom 
his mom 
casey  who buys high priced lingerie
for their mother 
well  maybe he was looking for a robe 
casey  he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman 
  i prefer the mother story 
  i know you do  but that s not the point 
no  the point is i m not gonna start out
assuming the guy s a liar 
  why not 
  because that s how you wind up   
like me  is that what you were gonna say 
no  i was gonna say   like you   
  what s his name 
  why 
  i m gonna google him 
  no  google your own guy 
let s just see if his mother s still alive 
  so when is grace due again 
  soon 
  you excited 
  what d you say 
do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here 
no  don t do that 
are you saying you don t wanna talk to them
because you can t go home with them 
i m just trying to keep my head above water 
  have you heard of the date doctor 
  urban myth 
  really 
  absolutely 
i was hoping he also helped women 
casey  you re not sick  you re single 
you just have to relax and enjoy the ride 
i haven t been ridden in months 
on that happy note  i m gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight 
  you mean  besides me 
  right 
bye 
i ll go get those girls 
bring them over here   
and we ll have a conversation
like human beings 
then you re gonna home 
and i ll take them back to my apartment 
well  that sounds like fun for me 
but you might want to get in line  pal 
  hey  girl 
  hey  how are you 
hey  baby  can i get a couple coronas
at the pool table  please  thanks 
excuse me 
lime wedges in the bottle s fine 
hey  asshole  i don t work here 
i m sorry  the paramedics will have to come
to get my foot out of my mouth  sweetheart 
just don t let it happen again 
  i knew you didn t work here 
  you did 
how else was i supposed to get you away
from all those guys 
why would you want to do that 
some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex 
they like women  women like them 
everything flows naturally 
back in college  i was just not one of them 
i seemed to lack the basic understanding   
that my peers just intuitively grasped 
but like any late bloomer 
i was eager to make up for lost time 
her name was cressida baylor 
can you tell me
where the registration building is 
and my life would never be the same 
  i m alex 
  cressida 
what we had was beautiful 
i love you 
i love you so much 
i love you  too  alex 
i know you don t love me
as much as i love you 
but that s okay 
i m just glad you love me at all 
in retrospect 
i guess i may have come on a little strong 
but the experience taught me a lot 
cressida 
what are you doing 
i m sorry  alex 
but i love you  what did i do wrong 
just tell me what i did wrong 
you re doing it right now 
alex  i m sorry 
and it s an education
i feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men 
because with no guile and no game 
there s no girl 
if ever a man born was without game   
it was albert brennaman 
my business is 100  referral
and  thus far  untraceable 
and if there s one thing i ve learned   
when you orchestrate  coordinate 
and otherwise mess with fate   
it s best to fly under the radar 
i hope she s single
 cause i don t do break ups 
hi  thank you for seeing me 
yeah  no 
i mean  she just got out of a relationship 
is that a problem 
because if it is  that s fine 
i m a little uncomfortable with this anyway 
definitely been hurt a lot 
i had a lot of bad experiences 
some good ones 
but definitely a lot of bad ones 
i m desperate  basically 
i mean  not in general  you understand 
you know  not just for anybody 
but  man  for her    yeah 
why don t you tell me about her 
let s see  what can i say 
my company handles her finances 
i m her tax consultant 
well  i m one of them 
i m the junior man on the account 
  so does she know you re interested 
  no 
alive 
i lent her my pen once 
shoot  does anyone have a pen 
  here  take mine 
  albert  you re crushing my arm 
sorry about that  here you go  allegra 
allegra  as in allegra cole 
yeah  i realize that i m not her usual type 
well  her last boyfriend owned sweden
or something 
and that guy was a bum 
he didn t seem like
a very nice person to me 
you swing for the fence 
look  you don t think i tried
talking myself out of this 
i mean  you don t think i know
how ridiculous this is  i know  okay 
i just thought that maybe with your help   
you know what 
i m really sorry i wasted your time 
hold on a second  albert 
you know what it s like
getting up every morning feeling hopeless 
feeling like the love of your life
is waking up with the wrong man 
but at the same time 
hoping that she still finds happiness   
even if it s never gonna be with you 
you are flat out   
out of your mind  you know that 
that s good 
it is 
you ever heard of michelangelo 
heard of the sistine chapel 
michelangelo 
sistine chapel 
you saying you can do this 
my name is alex hitchens 
let s go paint that ceiling 
take it easy 
oh  my god 
well  it looks like i m still rich 
but what i would really like 
and what i was wondering is   
if i could have  500 000
to invest on my own 
and what were you thinking
of investing in  allegra 
well  it s something
that i really have a passion for 
daydreams are for private time 
when you re in the room  be in the room 
concentrate  focus 
women respond when you respond to them 
my friend maggie is a talented designer 
i ve seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic 
and i would really like to get involved 
i ll tell you what 
let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in   
and next month 
we ll run the whole lot of them by you 
okay 
fine  thank you  all right  gentlemen 
let s go over this one more time 
what is the objective 
shock and awe 
that was shockingly awful 
what is the objective 
shock and awe 
what is the objective 
  excuse me  sir 
  yes  albert 
i don t really agree with that 
you don t really agree with what 
i think if you want to invest  500 000
in your friend s business   
that s exactly what you should do 
you don t need us to tell you what to do 
we re a board of advisers 
not your kindergarten teachers 
if you want to be taken seriously
as an adult   
then start taking yourself seriously
as an adult   
instead of asking for permission
to invest your own money   
from a boardroom
full of your daddy s golf buddies 
  that s quite enough 
  i m not finished 
i d like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity   
that she s had to deal with her whole life 
with half her class 
we should be taking advice from you 
miss cole  not the other way around 
  sit down   
  no  you know what  i quit 
oh  my god 
just breathe  how d it go 
i yelled at her  i screamed at my boss 
i quit my job 
  what 
  you said   
  i gotta go back 
  no  i didn t tell you to quit 
relax  okay  listen  we re fine 
  would you let me go 
  albert  no 
just relax  okay 
  just let it marinate for a second  trust me 
  no 
relax 
  it s allegra cole 
  answer it 
  could i speak to you a second 
  answer the door  albert 
yes  hi 
what s up 
listen  albert  right 
  people don t usually talk to me like that 
  close your mouth  man 
let me rephrase that 
people never talk to me like that 
stand up 
i guess it s kind of scary for them 
but that s why i really appreciate
what you did in there 
but i was wondering   
do you think that you and i could
get together sometime this week 
you know  to go over things 
financial things 
i d like to see the areas
where i can afford to take some risks 
  check your schedule 
  i ll check my schedule 
great  let me give you my number 
do you have a pen 
i don t think i have one 
  yes  i do 
  great 
and call me allegra 
  you re done 
  goodbye 
good job 
oh  damn 
she s some kind of newspaper columnist 
comes in here once in a while  great tipper 
what s her drink 
usually beer 
tonight  grey goose martini  dirty 
hi 
i noticed your glass was getting low   
so i took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini 
thank you 
and i couldn t help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend 
  what s your name 
  they call me chip 
you can t get them to stop 
that was funny 
listen  i understand the courage it takes
to walk across a room   
and try to generate a relationship
out of thin air 
  so don t take the following personally 
  you have fantastic eyes 
thanks  try to listen 
this is no reflection on you 
i m just not interested 
but thank you for the compliment
of coming over 
you re welcome 
so do you like cuban food 
chip  seriously  that was not code for 
 i wish you d try harder   
are you always so shut down and afraid
that the right man might make you   
feel like a natural woman 
sorry i m late  honey 
i couldn t get a cab  how was the meeting 
well  there was a beginning 
a middle  and an end 
nice to meet you  chip 
you  too 
on the one hand 
it is very difficult for a man   
to even speak to someone
who looks like you 
but on the other hand 
should that be your problem 
so life s kind of hard all around 
not if you pay attention 
you re sending all the right signals 
no earrings  heels under two inches 
your hair is pulled back   
wearing reading glasses with no book 
drinking a grey goose martini   
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn t do it 
if that wasn t clear enough   
there s always the  fuck off 
that you have stamped on your forehead 
who d believe there s a man out there
that can sit by a woman he doesn t know   
and genuinely be interested in who she is 
what she does  without his own agenda 
i wouldn t even know
what that would look like 
so what would a guy like that say 
he d say   my name is alex hitchens
and i m a consultant   
but she wouldn t be interested in that   
because she d be counting the seconds
until he left 
thinking he was like every other guy 
which  life experience has taught her 
is a virtual certainty 
but then he d ask her name
and what she did for a living   
and she might blow him off 
or she might say   
i m sara melas 
i run the gossip column at the standard 
and then he d ask
all these penetrating questions about her   
because he was sincerely 
if atypically  interested 
no 
  no 
  he d be interested 
but he d see that there was no way   
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real 
well  he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original 
wouldn t help 
  don t you hate it when that happens 
  not really 
they d both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward 
my guess is they d do just fine 
it s a pleasure to have met you  sara melas 
grey goose martini
from the gentleman who just left 
is that for me 
what 
vance munson  sorry i m late 
no  not a problem 
wow  you re the   
  can i get you something to drink  mr   
  no  i m fine  thank you 
so  tell me about her 
have you ever met someone   
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you 
not just because of her looks 
but that x factor 
how d you meet her 
actually  i was in a shop
buying pajamas for my mom 
and by that  of course  you mean   
you were buying lingerie
for another woman 
yes  you can t help
where you meet somebody 
and the lingerie is for a woman
i m no longer seeing 
but anyway  the girl i met 
the one i was talking about   
she s so sweet  funny  southern 
she gives me her number 
now she won t return my phone calls 
i don t know what it is about her 
i just can t get her out of my mind 
you know  food has lost its taste 
colors  they seem dull 
things that used to matter   
i don t know  they just no longer do 
i think things aren t gonna snap back
unless i   
unless i bang her 
excuse me 
you know  bang her  clear my head 
get in  get off  get out 
i think you may have misunderstood
what i do exactly 
no  i was told you help guys get in there 
right  but  see  here s the thing 
my clients actually like women 
hit it and quit it is not my thing 
let me make one thing clear to you  rabbi 
i need professional help 
well  that is for damn certain 
and i m glad you can admit it
because generally that s the hardest part 
you see what i m doing 
this is what i m about 
power suit  power tie  power steering 
people can wince  cry  beg 
but eventually they do what i want 
so that s  like  a metaphor 
well  i m more of a literal kind of guy 
so when i do this   
this is more like me saying
that i will literally break your shit off   
if you ever touch me again  okay  pumpkin 
got it 
no 
pablo  i can t just mention your restaurant 
somebody has to eat there 
no  somebody famous  you know that 
  sara melas 
  no 
okay  bye 
i need your signature 
i hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number 
so this is me not calling  over 
yes  you re right 
this is much less invasive 
i ve been thinking about
that sign on your forehead 
and i was wondering if you d mind
taking it down for dinner friday night  over 
i can t  i have a couple of parties
i have to hit 
gossip never sleeps 
not till about 4 00 a  m 
saturday 
i have a date 
do you know the definition
of  perseverance   miss melas 
an excuse to be obnoxious 
continuing in a course of action   
without regard to discouragement 
opposition or previous failure  over 
okay  webster  how do i get rid of you 
breakfast  sunday 
and you can barely even call that a date 
you do that with out of town relatives
that you don t even like  over 
come on 
okay  i guess i could do sunday 
you forgot to say  over    over 
this conversation s over
as soon as you tell me when and where 
7 00 a  m   north cove marina  over and out 
7 00 a  m  are you crazy 
i don t do 7 00 a  m 
  hello 
  sign here

sunday 
so i guess you re not going to church 
do you really expect me to wear this 
it ll be awful cold out there without it 
  good morning 
   good  would have been at 10 00 
you re a lot taller than i remember 
you ever ride one of these 
not on the hudson 
so  what do you wanna do 
race me around the statue of liberty 
if there s time 
  but you might need these 
  all right 
  bam 
  wow 
how do i look 
fabulous 
all right  i give 
where do i change 
so we ll go past the wall  then take a left 
it s pretty much a straight shot from there 
  straight shot to where 
  that s for me to know and you to find out 
what you do with these babies is   
yeah  what i do with this baby
is kick your ass 
  what happened  you change your mind 
  it just died 
did you put gas in it 
no  you know  i think it must have
sucked up a diaper or something 
gross  try it again 
you want me to call aaa 
come on around
and let me hop on with you 
i don t know  what if you break mine  too 
then we ll both be sitting ducks 
  i didn t break it  it just died 
  yeah  yeah 
all right  hop on 
  scoot back 
  hitch  i m already here 
but you don t know where we re going 
why don t you tell me 
then we ll both know 
man  male egos 
i don t know how you guys
make it through the day with them 
what  it is not my ego 
i just don t want to ruin the surprise 
i m sorry  are you all right 
there  i always keep a few of those around 
thank you 
i have lower back trouble 
i just shove the ice packs right down there 
no  that s a fresh one 
so  ellis island 
i have to admit  i have lived in new york
my whole life and i ve never been here 
i figured that  most people haven t 
so i got my man larry here
to set us up a private tour 
  great 
  anything for hitch 
it was originally known as oyster island 
the island was expanded
to its present size   
with dirt removed during the construction
of the new york subway system 
  are you serious 
  yes 
  did you know this 
  yeah  that s why i brought you here 
in fact  over 100 million americans
can trace their ancestry   
back to a single man  woman  or child
on the ship s manifest   
to an inspector s ledger 
by 1910  75  of the residents of new york   
chicago  detroit  cleveland  and boston   
were immigrants 
or the children of immigrants 
they generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities   
in little italys  chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves 
it s called the kissing post 
the plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences 
now  what exactly would qualify
as a long absence 
i mean   
  that count 
  no 
i actually had a relative come through here 
  really 
  yeah 
what 
  what 
  what was that thing 
no  you know  i was just thinking   
you can t really know where you re going
until you know where you ve been 
  ain t that right  larry 
  amen  brother 
that s kind of deep for a first date 
don t you think 
what is that 
oh  my god 
that s my great great grandfather 
that s his signature 
jesus  it s right here 
how did you know 
hitch did the search  i just found the page 
i m sorry 
i saw that going differently in my mind 
so my family never saw him again 
well  except for on the wanted posters 
look  i m really sorry 
when i saw it on the computer 
it said   the butcher of cádiz   
i thought it was a profession 
not a headline 
it s just one of those horrible family legacies
we ve all tried to forget 
but thank you 
no  it was   
  a train wreck 
  no 
let me get you a cab 
thanks 
  bye 
  bye bye 
taxi 
poor guy 
sounds like he went to a lot of trouble 
it was fun  in a disastrous kind of way 
i mean  this isn t exactly a hickey 
at least you got a good story
out of it  right 
right 
  you should try mine  it s great 
  wait  you re seeing him again 
well  look  you said that
i m always expecting men   
to let me down  right 
assuming that they re gonna fail 
which he did 
yeah  but he did it with flair 
i mean  case  he really tanked 
and that s a desirable trait 
yeah  weird  huh 
now  just keep it simple 
just like we practiced 
we re just leaving a message 
women like allegra cole
don t pick up numbers they don t recognize 
hello 
she s on the phone 
  yes  hello  miss cole 
  yeah 
hi  i have albert brennaman for you 
  one moment  please 
  no  tell her i m at lunch 
we called her to tell her you re at lunch 
allegra  hi  it s albert brennaman 
hi  how are you 
good  i m doing good 
the reason i m calling
is about our appointment this wednesday 
not gonna be able to make it 
well  when can you make it 
when can i do it 
i don t even know 
because my whole next week is slammed 
right  but it s all good 
no  we re gonna make it happen though 
that s for sure 
we re going to make it happen  yes 
what s going on over there 
just moving some things around 
sky studios 
tonight i m actually going
to this fashion thing at sky studios 
designer friend 
i just thought it might be something
your designer friend would be interested in 
yeah  definitely 
well  great 
then i will put you back on with my   
  allegra  over here  please 
  miss cole  this way 
great  one more 
  hi  there 
  this was a fantastic idea 
i suppose  hey  where s maggie 
late as usual 
tonight i want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg 
do you know why i want you to do that 
because i m cool 
  no 
  i know  i m not 
i m saying that you are an iceberg   
in that over 90  of your mass
is below the surface 
i know i m heavy  i am 
i m talking about who you are 
it s a metaphor 
accounting  business   
all of that is just a small part
of a much deeper  richer albert 
one more 
it s gonna be loud in there   
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier   
in a non sleazy way 
so get to where it s loudest 
ask her if she d like a drink 
lean in  place your hand
on the small of her back   
and say it in her ear like a secret 
watch your hand placement 
too high says   i just wanna be friends   
too low says   i just wanna grab some ass   
friends  ass  me 
special issues  allegra cole is a celebrity   
which means that when people talk to her 
they ll ignore you completely 
she s classy  so she ll introduce you 
when she does  shake hands hard
and speak up  let them know you re there 
show her you can handle being her escort 
  egon  this is albert 
  how you doing 
  albert  this is zak 
  nice to see you 
these guys are friends with maggie 
  been to that new brazilian restaurant 
  no  but i am   
it s disgusting 
i m writing an article about it 
did you see the new installation at moma 
  yes  did you think   
  disgusting 
women can always tell
when you re not being real with them 
worst thing you can do is try to fake it 
because you are a great guy 
and you do have something
to offer allegra that no other man does 
what was your name  eggnog 
egon 
what do you think of the design of the jets 
new football stadium on the west side 
let me guess  disgusting 
think it over  we ll be back 
thank you  i can t stand those guys 
really  i kind of liked them 
but when all is said and done   
tonight is not about allegra 
  it s not 
  no  tonight is about maggie 
a woman s best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions 
so you can t afford to mess this up 
albert  i want you to meet
my friend  maggie 
hi  maggie 
it s an absolute pleasure to meet you 
i m maggie 
  no  you re not 
  actually  i am 
magnus forester 
thank you so much for inviting us 
  you have very soft hands 
  thank you 
  wow  so do you 
  thank you 
so tonight  you focus on one thing
and one thing only 
maggie 
  where does your inspiration come from 
  oh  my god 
anything i see 
something in a magazine 
out on the street   
in an old movie 
the receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me 
anybody want any spring rolls 
that s a beautiful tie  by the way 
this whole thing  it just works 
thank you 
  is he gay 
  i don t think so 
i like him 
about the deejay 
generally  i have a firm no dancing policy 
but if she asks  you cannot say no 
i m not worried about dancing 
but if there are people there   
i m sorry  i hate to be a stickler 
but i need to be thorough 
show me what you mean
by you re not worried about it 
trust me  you know what i m gonna do 
that s what it s all about  right there 
see how it gets bigger 
now i m gonna start the fire 
but the feet are going 
i start the fire  i make the pizza 
hips are always going 
can t get enough hip 
from there  the q tip 
q tip  throw it away 
that s not working  hit them with this 
don t ever   
do that again 
do you hear me 
  just expressing myself 
  no 
not like that  you re not  all right 
this is where you live 
right here 
you live right here  okay  this is home 
none of this 
i don t wanna see none of that 
don t need no pizza  they got food there 
elbows  6 inches from the waist 
90 degree angles 
don t you bite your lip  stop it 
women relate dancing to sex  all right 
even a great dancer can lose it
with one of these 
okay  now that s what i need to be learning 
can t stop it 
you cannot stop it 
next subject 
get out 
thanks 
so  are you a knicks fan 
when they re good 
  i m really sorry 
  oh  god  why 
  she was there 
  i left you a bunch of messages 
my phone fell in the hudson 
yeah  well  it gets worse 
i don t believe this 
  i thought he was a bodyguard 
  i m the only one who will need protection 
  max is gonna   
  gonna be really irritated 
when i got the train this morning 
i thought it was gonna be a good day 
who the hell is albert brennaman 
  tell me how this happened 
  what  there were some photographers 
does this even look like dancing to you 
that s just a little bit of me being me 
no  that s you being a lot of something
you don t need to ever be again 
  it s just one dance 
  no 
one dance  one look  one kiss 
that s all we get  albert 
just one shot to make the difference   
between happily ever after and 
 oh  he s just some guy
i went to some thing with once   
all right 
  what 
  you said  kiss   
is that a problem 
it s not a problem  but this is allegra cole 
eight out of 10 women believe
that the first kiss   
will tell them everything they need to know
about a relationship 
and believe me 
she has definitely thought about it 
  she has 
  of course 
not that she s gonna act on it 
so it s no real big deal 
  all right  it s no big deal then 
  it s a very big deal 
  huge 
  monumental 
you are not listening   
i need you to wrap your head around this 
tomorrow night  allegra cole   
could have her last first kiss 
all right  come on 
just show me what you got 
  what do you mean 
  just show me how you would kiss me 
i wouldn t kiss you 
i m not me  i m allegra 
but you re really not  so   
okay  albert  end of the night 
you re dropping me off at home 
  show me the magic 
  i m not comfortable with this 
god  albert 
i had such a wonderful time with you 
yeah  how about those knicks 
you see what i m doing 
this is a signal  i m fiddling with my keys 
a woman that doesn t want a kiss   
takes her keys out  puts them in the door 
goes in the house 
a woman that wants to kiss  she fiddles 
i m fiddling 
okay  you have a good night now   
  you see what i m doing 
  robbing me 
no 
this is what most guys do 
they rush in to take the kiss 
but you re not most guys 
see  the secret to a kiss
is to go 90  of the way   
and then hold 
  for how long 
  as long as it takes   
for her to come the other 10  
okay  90  10   got it 
okay  come on  shake it off  it s your turn 
i had a really nice time tonight  albert 
i had a great time tonight  too  allegra   
with a beard 
what s up 
  i m not feeling it 
  what do you mean  i came 90  
i m not feeling like you want it 
look  i m allegra cole 
the woman of your dreams 
the woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire 
now  show me the magic  albert 
  what the hell was that 
  i m showing you the magic 
no  i said come 90  and then i come 10  
you don t go the whole 100  
my mouth was open  albert

other than that  how was it

and they left together
