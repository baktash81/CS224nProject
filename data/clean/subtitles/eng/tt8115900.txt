lets see what theyre saying
about us today
what up its tiffany fluffit
channel 6 action news
the bad guys
have struck again
guys guys stop it
were on tv
ooh ooh
proving once more that they
are the most diabolical
criminals of our time
ooh diabolical thats new
know what it sounds like
a cologne
diabolical
to address
this heinous crime spree
is the newly elected governor
diane foxington
governor
okay yeah
i hear you i hear you
listen listen we all know
how dastardly the bad guys are
you bet we are
but more than anything
i feel sorry for them
what
these socalled bad guys
are really just
secondrate hasbeens
behind their amateurish antics
and frankly
unoriginal capers
i mean really another bank
is nothing but
a deep well of anger
i aint angry youre angry
denial
not true
and selfloathing
the only one i selfloathe
is you
and those are holes
that no amount of cash
or priceless art can ever fill
whats on the food network
so can we just forget about
whowho is she to judge us
and focus on more positive things
and what could be more positive
than the annual
good samaritan awards
where tomorrow night i will
present the golden dolphin
to this years goodest citizen
i cant believe i voted for her
you voted for her
what
shes good on climate change
wait whats going on
youve got that twinkle
in your eye
guys whos up for another job
a big one
the golden dolphin
seriously
oh
i thought i was the crazy one
that job has broken
every criminal whos tried it
the bucharest bandits
lucky jim
the crimson paw
actually the crimson paw
was never arrested
yeah but he never stole
anything again
snake what better way
to wipe that smirk
off the governors fuzzy face
than stealing the golden dolphin
from right under her whiskers
this is the holy grail
of thievery
if we pull this off
well cement our legacy
as the greatest criminals
of all time
whoa whoa buddy
i thought we werent supposed
to make things personal
besides weve got
a good thing going here
friends freedom
and just look at this loot
all right youre right
forget it
the dolphin job is off
good
i guess the pig
will get his trophy after all
yeah i guess he would
what do you mean pig
oh yes did i not mention that
thats weird i thought
i mentioned that it was uh
the good samaritan is
a guinea pig
what do you say snakey
better than cake
right
okay fine
but he better be delicious
are we all in this together
so heres the plan
like every year
the ceremony will be held
at the museum of fine arts
where the golden dolphin
will be positioned
just beyond
the backstage curtain
sounds easy
sounds easy hermano
but to get there
well need to bypass
three levels of security
so step one
well need to blend in
baby im howlin for you
dada dada da
dada dada da
professor marmalade
this years recipient
of the golden dolphin
the most annoying good creature
on the planet
professor in the past year
youve stopped wars
fed the hungry
and saved countless pandas
some have described
your goodness
as second only to mother teresa
oh tiffany
its not a competition
and if it were it would
really be more of a tie
but we can all agree that
there is a flower of goodness
inside all of us
just waiting to blossom
once inside
there are two armored doors
the first can only be opened by
a special key card
that is carried
by our dear friend
the chief of police
the second is outfitted
with a retinal scanner
and guarded by
an elite special ops unit
trained to strike first
and ask questions later
governor foxington
is the only one
who has clearance
to open the second door
so step two
she and i will need to get
up close and personal
enjoy your evening
mr ambassador
thank you maam
interesting piece
trashy pointless
and pretentious
hmm they say that art reveals
more about the viewer
than the artist
mister
poodleton oliver poodleton
uh okay
its about time someone stood up
to those diabolical bad guys
though ive got to say
no ones succeeded yet
eh i dont think
itll be that hard
i have a feeling itll be
harder than you think
id say theyre
one epic job away
from cementing their legacy
mr poodleton
youreyoure funny
i am
the only legacy theyre
cementing is life in prison
did you see their last job
ugh unsecured exits
crude disguises
compulsive showboating
i mean it was a mess
all the classic signs
of a crew in decline
next theyre gonna
make it personal
thats when you know
theyre toast
uh well thats your opinion
it is and im the governor
as for the sculpture
i think its about perspective
if you look closely enough
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful
how about that
i guess some things
arent always as they appear
that reminds me
may i i cant miss a photo op
with the governor
and a pile of garbage
oh mr poodleton
youre too hard on yourself
hey
okay friends
its showtime

narcissism

sadly we were never
given a chance
to be anything more
than secondrate criminals
if only there was someone
who could help
the flower of goodness
inside us blossom
some icon of love
and forgiveness
like uh i dont know
mother teresa
best thing is to just
throw us in jail
for the rest
of our hopeless lives
yeah thats the plan
wait wait wait no no
get in there
ow
wait
uh beg beg pardon
mr wolf may be a savage beast
basically walking garbage

to everyone at that gala
that the bad guys have changed
will you set them free

im the villain of every story
guilty until proven innocent
even if by some miracle
we did change
whos gonna believe us huh

why whats up
i was just getting
a little worried

isnt it
snake buddy
who made the plan to begin with
you did
so im the one who sticks
to the plan the most right
yeah ri uh yeah ok

but if the plan
were ever to change
youdyoud tell me right
you have my word
go bad
or go home
hey snake
yeah
you ever wonder
what itd be like
the world loving us
instead of being scared of us
you ever

loving us
yeah right
i dont waste time
thinking about stuff

accessible with
her authorized fingerprints

to hack into the power grid

youre such a
good boy
you
it was all you
what are you talking about
wolf
the old lady
the golden dolphin
good training
it was all to get us here
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall
whoa whoa what old lady
andand why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway
uh guys hes creeping me out
wait what whats going on
someone turn me around
well well
so you finally get it
wait
what
you stole the meteorite
oh its not just a meteorite
i told you guys its a butt
its not a butt
its the ultimate power source
you see when it struck
scientists found that
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency
unlike anything else on earth
im going to harness its power
to pull off the greatest heist
the world has ever seen
you shouldve eaten him
when you had the chance
yep
but why us
because youre
the perfect patsies
come on when people look up
bad in the dictionary
do they see a sweet
adorable guinea pig
no they see you
and they always will
okay fine
but you set us up
oh pishpish
lets be honest
evolution set you up
but wolfie here
really clinched it
you fell for every one
of my traps
starting with saving
a helpless little old lady
wolf whats he talking about
whoops
did i say too much
anyhoo looks like yet again
the big bad wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy
you little pouchycheeked rat
ill kill you you hear me
youre dead youre de
help help help
the big bad wolf
is attacking me
oh now you are done
forever wolf
professor professor
any thoughts
on how the bad guys managed
to steal the meteorite
in plain sight
well off the top of my head
perhaps they accessed the site
previously
and set up an intricate system
of tunnels and trapdoors
uhhuh
that could be
remotely triggered
to suck the meteorite down
into a holding area
but how should i know
totally
i mean theyre the
deranged masterminds not me
im giving it all back
i cant believe
we got doublecrossed
by a tiny rodent
oh we got doublecrossed
by a rodent all right
but uh not a tiny one
what
this was supposed to be
us conning marmalade
it turns out
it was wolf conning us
does that sound familiar
to you wolf
whywhy would you think that
oh i dont know maybe because
you just sabotaged
the biggest heist of our lives
i think you owe us
an explanation buddy
okay youre right
this is what happened
back in the museum i just tried
to steal an old ladys purse
classic snatch and grab
tried to since when do you try
to steal something
and not just steal it
i was trying to steal the purse
when the old lady fell and
i kind of helped her
what
i kind of helped her
but then you stole her purse
no i didnt
i saved the old lady
and she hugged me
and my tail wagged
and i didnt know what it was
but it felt uh
you know good
ah
but then you stole the purse
no
you know i heard
what the pig said to you
about cutting us loose
wait like us us
but i never thought
youd actually do it man
hey hey hey hey
ii would never
i was trying to
i was trying to find us
a better life
our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it
i didnt
you guys felt it at the gala
the clapping the cheering
we were more than
than just scary villains
they loved us
oh yeah
if they loved us so much
how come were in prison
for a crime we didnt commit
you know what
ill give marmalade this
at least he sees the world
for what it is
a place where
some people are scary
and some people are scared
oh yeah
well im tired of being scary
imim tired of
being an outcast
maybe i dont want to be a
what a bad guy
dont want to be
a bad guy anymore huh
say it wolf
yeah i thought so
and us your lifelong friends
were just holding you back
yeah maybe you are
take it back
take it back apologize
hey hey hey hey hey hey
prison is no place for fighting
tell that to him
huh
what
shh
run
oh
wwwait wait hohold on
diane
but how do you know how to do
all of that
kickkickpunchpunch
wait a sec
youre the crimson paw
the queen of cons
acrobatic swiss army knife
stole the zumpango diamond
twice
once for profit
second time just for fun
never identified never caught
guess im still
the best bad guy
the world has ever seen
ugh at least i used to be
huh
nope im still the best
just like riding
a stolen bicycle
oh uh you got a little
ouch
hey whwhy did you
save us anyway
after the gala
i knew something wasnt right
so i did some investigating
and that meteor
i know some kind of cosmic
megasuperantennae thing
right if conducted through
an array of ionized crystals
it will generate a massive
psychokinetic field
the size of a city
oh my gosh
did i interrupt you
were you gonna say that
uh iii was gonna be
a little more technical
but you got the gist of it
marmalade needs to be stopped
but i cant do it alone
you know his compound
better than anyone
you can count on us
right guys
there is no us
were through wolf
done finito
because of that little tiff
back there
come on man thats what we do
you serve i volley
thats our little dance
not this time
piranha
webs
sorry wolfie
shark
hmm
hey
guys
guys
you want to know why
i hate birthdays wolf do you
when you grow up a snake
nobody shows up to your party
birthdays are a constant
reminder that out there
im just a scary
goodfornothing monster
yeah
but nothing compares
to having the one guy
the one guy i thought
i could trust
stab me in the back
come on guys
lets get out of here
now this is what
a true bad guy looks like
what do you say
we have some fun
hey you okay
no im not okay
im very very unokay
just left the only friends
i have ever had
so what am i
what am i doing
i know this isnt easy
leaving everything behind
do you
yeah
i was the best thief
in the world
fast fearless inventive
i just had one thing
left to steal
the golden dolphin
so you went after it
i didnt just go after it
i had it
and a clear escape route
but
all i saw in the end
was the tricky fox
that they always told me i was
it changed everything
so now
instead of hurting people
im helping them
im still me
im just me on the right side
youre doing the right thing
and someday your friends
if theyre real friends
i think theyll understand
now come on lets get inside
you look like you just busted out of a prison
guinea pigs
marmalade
lets bounce
so this is the hideout
of the great crimson paw
snack break
okay oddly timed
but you do you
identity verified
what
welcome diane
whoa holy moly
its so good to be home
are you kidding me
lasersighted zip line
the xm2400 radar jammer
no way
i actually prefer
the earlier model
agree to disagree
uh this stuff is nice too
yeah thats a blowtorch
also not really your color
all righty marmalade
what are you up to
you fuzzy little weirdo
we need eyes on the city
lets see if we cant hack
into the governments
surveillance satellite
but youre the governor
couldnt you just ask
yeah but
the paperwork
i am definitely picking up
on suspicious activity here
those are guinea pig
heat signatures
marmalade seems to be
controlling them
but to do what
there are no obvious targets
thats because
theyre moving targets
his charity fundraiser
hes gonna steal the money
raised in his own name
its the greatest heist
the worlds ever seen
1 billion inside trucks
on their way to charities
all over the city
we need to cut off
marmalades communication
with his guinea pig army
if theres no signal
theres no heist
we have to steal the meteorite
that was very cute
that thing we just did there
all right
put on your biggirl pants
were gearing up
i wouldnt take that
those things rip your pants
right off
huh try wearing
clean underwear
just in case
wha
you stole my car
respect
lets do this
no
what
all our stuff
where is everything
no no no no no
no no no no no no no no
all our stuff
its all gone
my disguise closet
wheres my things
wolf gave away all our loot
we stole it fair and square
now i understand
what it feels like
to have things stolen from you
i dont like it
i really dont like it
we got no food
we got no money
we got no money
we could use to buy food
no food we can sell for money
we
all right okay okay
here here take it
now stop crying buddy
um snake what did you just do
what my friend was sad
i was just cheering him up
you you did a good thing
for me
dont be ridiculous
i just put your needs
before my own
yeah youre being good
im not
i was simply making a sacrifice
so shark could be happy
that is the actual definition
of being good
snake you
the worst one of us
the most selfish
spiteful
terrible
sneaky
dishonest
insensitive
manipulative
snakelike
stanky
and your point is
i think wolf was right
maybe we could be more
than just scary villains
wh
oh wow
is this is this wagging
werewere wagging
no no no
well always be bad guys
faster faster my little pigs
once we steal the meteorite
we take it straight
to the police
and all will be forgiven
i dont know about all
but its a start
thats strange
why would marmalade leave
the golden dolphin unprotected
because maybe its a trap
or maybe
wait wait wait
yeah it was a trap
well well well
if it isnt my prized pupil
and youve brought along
the governor
or should i say
the crimson paw
mm what an ingenious way
to disguise a zumpango diamond
hiding it in plain sight
you got to be kidding me
what im sentimental
you always did have panache
and yet you still fell
right into my trap
but how did you know
wed even be here
oh i got a little tip
from a friend
hey buddy
