sucker 
come on  man  now you gonna
make me get all aggressive 
animals 
spit it out  spit it out 
never 
let s see what they re saying
about us today 
what up  it s tiffany fluffit 
channel 6 action news 
the bad guys
have struck again   
guys  guys  stop it 
we re on tv 
  ooh  ooh 
     proving once more that they
are the most diabolical
criminals of our time 
ooh   diabolical   that s new 
know what it sounds like 
a cologne 
diabolical 
to address
this heinous crime spree
is the newly elected governor 
diane foxington 
  governor 
  okay  yeah 
i hear you  i hear you 
listen  listen  we all know
how dastardly the bad guys are 
  you bet we are 
  but more than anything   
i feel sorry for them 
what 
these so called bad guys
are really just
second rate has beens 
behind their amateurish antics
and  frankly 
unoriginal capers   
i mean  really  another bank    
is nothing but
a deep well of anger   
i ain t angry  you re angry 
     denial   
  not true 
   and self loathing 
the only one i self loathe
is you 
and those are holes
that no amount of cash
or priceless art can ever fill 
what s on the food network 
so  can we just forget about   
who who is she to judge us 
   and focus on more positive things 
and what could be more positive
than the annual
good samaritan awards 
where tomorrow night i will
present the golden dolphin
to this year s goodest citizen 
i can t believe i voted for her 
you voted for her 
what 
she s good on climate change 
wait  what s going on 
you ve got that twinkle
in your eye 
guys  who s up for another job 
a big one 
the golden dolphin 
  seriously 
  oh 
i thought i was the crazy one 
that job has broken
every criminal who s tried it 
the bucharest bandits 
lucky jim 
the crimson paw 
actually  the crimson paw
was never arrested 
yeah  but he never stole
anything again 
snake  what better way
to wipe that smirk
off the governor s fuzzy face
than stealing the golden dolphin
from right under her whiskers 
this is the holy grail
of thievery 
if we pull this off 
we ll cement our legacy
as the greatest criminals
of all time 
whoa  whoa  buddy 
i thought we weren t supposed
to make things personal 
besides  we ve got
a good thing going here 
friends  freedom 
and just look at this loot 
all right  you re right 
forget it 
  the dolphin job is off 
  good 
i guess the pig
will get his trophy after all 
yeah  i guess he would   
what do you mean   pig  
oh  yes  did i not mention that 
that s weird  i thought
i mentioned that it was  uh   
the good samaritan is   
a guinea pig 
what do you say  snakey 
better than cake 
right 
okay  fine 
but he better be delicious 
are we all in this together 
so here s the plan 
like every year 
the ceremony will be held
at the museum of fine arts 
where the golden dolphin
will be positioned
just beyond
the backstage curtain 
sounds easy 
sounds easy  hermano 
but to get there 
we ll need to bypass
three levels of security 
so  step one 
we ll need to blend in 
  baby  i m howlin  for you  
  da da da da da 
da da da da da     
professor marmalade 
this year s recipient
of the golden dolphin 
the most annoying good creature
on the planet 
professor  in the past year 
you ve stopped wars 
fed the hungry
and saved countless pandas 
some have described
your goodness
as second only to mother teresa 
oh  tiffany 
it s not a competition 
and if it were  it would
really be more of a tie 
but we can all agree that
there is a flower of goodness
inside all of us 
just waiting to blossom 
once inside 
there are two armored doors 
the first can only be opened by
a special key card
that is carried
by our dear friend 
the chief of police 
the second is outfitted
with a retinal scanner
and guarded by
an elite special ops unit
trained to strike first
and ask questions later 
governor foxington
is the only one
who has clearance
to open the second door 
so  step two 
she and i will need to get
up close and personal 
enjoy your evening 
mr  ambassador 
thank you  ma am 
interesting piece 
trashy  pointless
and pretentious 
hmm  they say that art reveals
more about the viewer
than the artist 
mister   
poodleton  oliver poodleton 
uh    okay 
it s about time someone stood up
to those diabolical bad guys 
though  i ve got to say 
no one s succeeded yet 
eh  i don t think
it ll be that hard 
i have a feeling it ll be
harder than you think 
i d say they re
one epic job away
from cementing their legacy 
mr  poodleton 
you re you re funny 
i am 
the only legacy they re
cementing is life in prison 
did you see their last job 
ugh  unsecured exits 
crude disguises 
compulsive showboating 
i mean  it was a mess 
all the classic signs
of a crew in decline 
next  they re gonna
make it personal 
that s when you know
they re toast 
uh  well  that s your opinion 
it is  and i m the governor 
as for the sculpture 
i think it s about perspective 
if you look closely enough 
even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful 
how about that 
i guess some things
aren t always as they appear 
that reminds me 
may i  i can t miss a photo op
with the governor
and a pile of garbage 
oh  mr  poodleton 
you re too hard on yourself 
hey   
okay  friends 
it s showtime 
once we re in

of anger and self loathing 
  denial

  narcissism 
  yeah  yeah 
emotional emptiness 
  so we re on the same page 
  hmm 
what is he doing 
sadly  we were never
given a chance
to be anything more
than second rate criminals 
if only there was someone
who could help
the flower of goodness
inside us blossom 
some icon of love
and forgiveness 
like  uh  i don t know 
mother teresa 
best thing is to just
throw us in jail
for the rest
of our hopeless lives 
yeah  that s the plan 
wait  wait  wait  no  no 
  get in there 
  ow 
wait 
uh  beg    beg pardon 
mr  wolf may be a savage beast 
basically walking garbage 
sorry  i m making a point 
do what you need to do  pal 
but how can we say
they re hopeless
if they ve never
been given a chance 
what if    what if we tried
a little experiment  diane 
as you know 
my gala for goodness 
the  hashtag charity event
of the year   is coming up 
if i can prove
to everyone at that gala
that the bad guys have changed 
will you set them free
and give them a clean start 
  what  professor marmalade 
  ow 
no  no  no  no  no 
don t you see what he s doing 
he s playing you 
but it was my idea 
it was his idea 
but only because
you made him have it 
madam governor 
you can t just let them go 
professor  i m not about to put
the safety of the city
on the line for an experiment 
excuse me  madam governor 
i seem to remember that
a wise person once said 
 even trash can be recycled
into something beautiful  
okay  i m game 
but only because it s you 
professor 
no 
we ll hold on to the dolphin
until the gala 
just to remove
any unnecessary temptation 
of course  good thinking 
that s why you re governor 
now that everyone s happy   
not happy 
   i  rupert marmalade
the fourth 
will turn the bad guys into   
the good guys 
i think these belong to you 
hey

a second chance 
make the most of it 
mr  poodleton

the head with an anchor 
and after that 
he only swam in a circle 
no  no  g guys  guys

just a few days with marmalade 
and then we roll into the gala
as good guys
and roll out scot free with   
the golden dolphin

since when do we not
finish a job 
the bad guys become
the good guys
so we can stay the bad guys

the love crater meteorite 
my greatest   
  i wonder whose butt it is

does he know what a butt is 
as i was saying 
on the outside 
the five of you are villains 
predators 
remorseless sociopaths 
oh  stop 
you re making me blush 
but inside  there s a flower   
the flower of goodness   
and when it blooms
and you feel that tingle
of positivity
radiating through your body 
you re going to want to feel it
all the time 
so we re going for a tingle 
not any tingle 
the tingle of goodness 
which you ll feel
in my state of the art
sharing laboratory 
okay  mr  snake  i m going
to give you a push pop 
great  push pop just for me 
  no  to share 
  why 
well  on a fundamental level 
it s about putting
someone else s needs
ahead of your own 
oh  no  no way 
snake 
all right  all right 
this is going to taste
extra sweet 
 cause i know how bad
you want it 
pop me  please  ah   
nope  sucker 
that s it 
i ll teach you to share 
mm  i like sharing 
it s yummy  mm 
totally worth it

a good person always
pays attention
to the needs of others 
now  here s a kindly 
frail grandma

maybe simpler 
hey  look

it doesn t get much simpler
than that

two pieces of bread with me

that flower of goodness is
blossoming all over the place 
don t you ever
get tired of lying 
no 
i mean    fudge 
that was    that was
a trick question  right 
i gave you an opportunity   
a chance to show the world
that you re more than just
a scary stereotype   
but you re too proud
or too gutless
to take advantage of it 
gutless  i m gutless 
oh 
i m sorry  have we met 
i m the villain of every story 
guilty until proven innocent 
even if by some miracle
we did change 
who s gonna believe us  huh 
of course you wouldn t know
anything about that 
with your little miss perfect
power suits 
is that so 
wait a second 
what did    how did you   
a wolf and a fox
are not so different 
maybe they will believe you 
maybe they won t 
but it doesn t matter 
don t do it for them 
do it for you 
this is a chance
to write your own story 
to find a better life for you
and your friends 
come on 
what have you got to lose 
i don t know  my dignity 
yeah  well 
that ship has already sailed 
believe it or not 
i m rooting for you  wolf 
so you re not gonna
call the chief 
i ll see you at the gala 
i think we got off
to a bad start 
the name s wolf 
yep 
i get that a lot 
first impressions and all 
no  no  no  no 
uh  it s okay  it s okay 
i m not gonna hurt you 
i know you re scared 
i would be  too  if i were you

to win over the guests
at the gala 
  now we re talking 
  yes    all right 
yeah  we did it  all right 
uh  wolf 
i must say 
you ve really turned a corner 
  you re really getting it 
  really 
oh  uh  thanks 
now  i mean it 
and i can see it
from tip to tail 
it s just a shame that you
have to carry all that baggage 
what are you talk   
you mean the guys 
what do you mean 
you have great potential  wolf 
but at some point 
you re going to have to choose
between your friends
or the good life 
hey  you still awake 
you you brought the cat in 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
i m just   
i m just saving it up for later 
why  what s up 
i was just getting
a little worried 
since you ve kind of become a   
become a what 
you know  teacher s pet 
getting all cozy with marmalade 
your tail wagging
and everything 
well  yeah  because
it has to be believable 
uh huh  yeah  i guess so 
as long as it s all
part of the plan 
it is all part of the plan 
isn t it 
snake  buddy 
who made the plan to begin with 
you did 
so i m the one who sticks
to the plan the most  right 
yeah  ri    uh  yeah  ok   
i guess that makes sense  yeah 
but if the plan
were ever to change 
you d you d tell me  right 
you have my word 
go bad   
or go home 
  hey  snake 
  yeah 
you ever wonder
what it d be like 
the world loving us
instead of being scared of us 
you ever   
you ever think about that 
loving us 
yeah  right 
i don t waste time
thinking about stuff
that s never gonna happen 
i can t wait for things
to get back to normal 
yeah  back to normal 
back to normal 
what up 
we are just moments away
from professor marmalade s
gala for goodness 
where the legendary
love crater meteorite

is really buzzing about
is the bad guys  whose
heart melting rescue video
has made them an overnight
viral sensation 
all right  guys 
this is the big one 
the golden dolphin
is inside a titanium case
controlled by a randomly
generated five digit code 
a code kept safe and secure
inside a briefcase handcuffed
to the chief of police 
she s not messing around 
the code is only
accessible with
  her authorized fingerprints 
  leave that to me 
while snake gets the code 
shark will secure
the fake dolphin 
i like the sound of that 
meanwhile  the rest of us
plant circuit jammers 
allowing me
to hack into the power grid 
at the end of the night 
we toast the professor 
 blah blah blah  yada yada  
and when i say  marmalade  
lights go out 
and we ll have exactly
four seconds to make our move 
the old switcheroo 
chief hands marmalade
the fake dolphin 
we get our pardon  applause 
applause  exit stage right 
and by the time they realize
what happened   
so long  suckers

into the sunset 
legacy cemented

some misunderstanding 
ah  professor marmalade 
you ve got five minutes

there  there 
of course you didn t do it 
how could you 
after all 
you re such a good boy 
you re such a good boy 
that shiver up my spine 
the wag in my tiny tail 
arrest them 
what if we tried
a little experiment  diane 
as you know 
my gala for goodness   
where the legendary
love crater meteorite
will be on display
for the first time ever 
all eyes will be
on you tonight  not me 
you re such a   
good boy 
you 
it was all you 
what are you talking about 
wolf 
the old lady 
the golden dolphin 
good training   
it was all to get us here 
so he could steal the meteorite
and let us take the fall 
whoa  whoa  what old lady 
and and why would a guinea pig
want a meteorite anyway 
uh  guys  he s creeping me out 
wait  what  what s going on 
someone turn me around 
well  well 
so  you finally get it 
  wait 
  what 
you stole the meteorite 
oh  it s not just a meteorite 
i told you guys it s a butt 
it s not a butt 
it s the ultimate power source 
you see  when it struck 
scientists found that
it emitted
an electromagnetic frequency
unlike anything else on earth 
i m going to harness its power
to pull off the greatest heist
the world has ever seen 
you should ve eaten him
when you had the chance 
  yep 
  but why us 
because you re
the perfect patsies 
come on  when people look up
 bad  in the dictionary 
do they see a sweet 
adorable guinea pig 
no  they see you 
and they always will 
okay  fine 
but you set us up 
oh  pish pish 
let s be honest   
evolution set you up 
but wolfie here
really clinched it 
you fell for every one
of my traps 
starting with saving
a helpless little old lady 
wolf  what s he talking about 
whoops 
did i say too much 
anyhoo  looks like  yet again 
the big bad wolf got outsmarted
by a little piggy 
you little pouchy cheeked rat 
i ll kill you  you hear me 
  you re dead  you re de   
  help  help  help 
the big bad wolf
is attacking me 
oh  now you are done
forever  wolf 
professor  professor 
any thoughts
on how the bad guys managed
to steal the meteorite
in plain sight 
well  off the top of my head 
perhaps they accessed the site
previously
and set up an intricate system
  of tunnels and trapdoors   
  uh huh 
   that could be
remotely triggered
to suck the meteorite down
into a holding area 
  but how should i know 
  totally 
i mean  they re the
deranged masterminds  not me 
i m giving it all back 
i can t believe
we got double crossed
by a tiny rodent 
oh  we got double crossed
by a rodent all right 
  but  uh  not a tiny one 
  what 
this was supposed to be
us conning marmalade 
it turns out
it was wolf conning us 
does that sound familiar
to you  wolf 
why why would you think that 
oh  i don t know  maybe because
you just sabotaged
the biggest heist of our lives 
i think you owe us
an explanation  buddy 
okay  you re right 
this is what happened 
back in the museum  i just tried
to steal an old lady s purse 
classic snatch and grab 
tried to  since when do you try
to steal something
and not just steal it 
i was trying to steal the purse
when the old lady fell and   
i kind of helped her 
what 
i kind of helped her 
but then you stole her purse 
no  i didn t 
i saved the old lady 
and she hugged me 
and my tail wagged 
and i didn t know what it was 
but it felt  uh 
you know    good 
ah 
but then you stole the purse 
no 
you know  i heard
what the pig said to you
about cutting us loose 
wait  like   us  us 
but i never thought
you d actually do it  man 
hey  hey  hey  hey 
i i would never   
i was trying to   
i was trying to find us
a better life 
our life was perfect
until you decided to ruin it 
i didn t 
you guys felt it at the gala 
the clapping  the cheering 
we were more than   
than just scary villains 
they loved us 
oh  yeah 
if they loved us so much 
how come we re in prison
for a crime we didn t commit 
you know what 
i ll give marmalade this 
at least he sees the world
for what it is 
a place where
some people are scary
and some people are scared 
oh  yeah 
well  i m tired of being scary 
i m i m tired of
being an outcast 
maybe i don t want to be a   
what  a bad guy 
don t want to be
a bad guy anymore  huh 
say it  wolf 
yeah  i thought so 
and us  your lifelong friends 
we re just holding you back 
yeah  maybe you are 
take it back 
take it back  apologize 
hey  hey  hey  hey  hey  hey 
prison is no place for fighting 
tell that to him 
huh 
what 
shh 
run 
  oh 
  w w wait  wait  ho hold on 
diane 
but how do you know how to do
all of that
kick kick punch punch 
wait a sec 
you re the crimson paw 
the queen of cons 
acrobatic swiss army knife 
stole the zumpango diamond
twice 
once for profit 
second time just for fun 
never identified  never caught 
guess i m still
the best bad guy
the world has ever seen 
ugh  at least i used to be 
huh 
nope  i m still the best 
just like riding
a stolen bicycle 
oh  uh  you got a little   
ouch 
hey  wh why did you
save us anyway 
after the gala 
i knew something wasn t right 
so i did some investigating 
and that meteor   
i know  some kind of cosmic
mega super antennae thing 
right  if conducted through
an array of ionized crystals 
it will generate a massive
psychokinetic field
the size of a city 
oh  my gosh 
did i interrupt you 
were you gonna say that 
uh  i i i was gonna be
a little more technical 
but you got the gist of it 
marmalade needs to be stopped 
but i can t do it alone 
you know his compound
better than anyone 
you can count on us 
right  guys 
there is no  us  
we re through  wolf 
done  finito 
because of that little tiff
back there 
come on  man  that s what we do 
you serve  i volley 
that s our little dance 
not this time 
piranha 
webs 
sorry  wolfie 
shark 
hmm 
hey 
guys 
guys 
you want to know why
i hate birthdays  wolf  do you 
when you grow up a snake 
nobody shows up to your party 
birthdays are a constant
reminder that out there
i m just a scary 
good for nothing monster 
yeah 
but nothing compares
to having the one guy   
the one guy i thought
i could trust
stab me in the back 
come on  guys 
let s get out of here 
now  this is what
a true bad guy looks like 
what do you say
we have some fun 
hey  you okay 
no  i m not okay 
i m very  very un okay 
just left the only friends
i have ever had 
so what am i   
what am i doing 
i know this isn t easy 
leaving everything behind 
  do you 
  yeah 
i was the best thief
in the world 
fast  fearless  inventive 
i just had one thing
left to steal 
the golden dolphin 
so you went after it 
i didn t just go after it 
i had it 
and a clear escape route 
but   
all i saw in the end
was the tricky fox
that they always told me i was 
it changed everything 
so  now 
instead of hurting people 
i m helping them 
i m still me 
i m just me on the right side 
you re doing the right thing 
and someday your friends 
if they re real friends 
i think they ll understand 
now  come on  let s get inside 
you look like you just busted out of a prison 
guinea pigs 
marmalade 
let s bounce 
so this is the hideout
of the great crimson paw 
snack break 
okay  oddly timed 
but you do you 
identity verified 
  what 
  welcome  diane 
whoa  holy moly 
it s so good to be home 
are you kidding me 
laser sighted zip line 
the xm 2400 radar jammer 
no way 
i actually prefer
the earlier model 
agree to disagree 
uh  this stuff is nice  too 
yeah  that s a blowtorch 
also  not really your color 
all righty  marmalade 
what are you up to 
you fuzzy little weirdo 
we need eyes on the city 
let s see if we can t hack
into the government s
surveillance satellite 
but you re the governor 
couldn t you just ask 
yeah  but   
the paperwork 
i am definitely picking up
on suspicious activity here 
those are guinea pig
heat signatures 
marmalade seems to be
controlling them 
but to do what 
there are no obvious targets 
that s because
they re moving targets 
his charity fundraiser 
he s gonna steal the money
raised in his own name 
it s the greatest heist
the world s ever seen 
 1 billion inside trucks 
on their way to charities
all over the city 
we need to cut off
marmalade s communication
with his guinea pig army 
if there s no signal   
there s no heist 
we have to steal the meteorite 
that was very cute 
  that thing we just did there 
  all right 
put on your big girl pants 
we re gearing up 
i wouldn t take that 
those things rip your pants
right off 
huh  try wearing
clean underwear 
just in case 
wha   
you stole my car 
respect 
let s do this 
  no 
  what 
all our stuff 
  where is everything 
  no  no  no  no  no 
  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
  all our stuff 
  it s all gone 
  my disguise closet 
where s my things 
wolf gave away all our loot 
we stole it fair and square 
now i understand
what it feels like
to have things stolen from you 
i don t like it 
i really don t like it 
we got no food 
we got no money 
we got no money
we could use to buy food 
no food we can sell for money 
we   
all right  okay  okay 
here  here  take it 
now  stop crying  buddy 
um  snake  what did you just do 
what  my friend was sad 
i was just cheering him up 
you    you did a good thing 
  for me 
  don t be ridiculous 
i just put your needs
before my own 
  yeah  you re being good 
  i m not 
i was simply making a sacrifice
so shark could be happy 
that is the actual definition
of being good 
snake  you 
the worst one of us 
the most selfish 
  spiteful 
  terrible 
  sneaky 
  dishonest 
  insensitive 
  manipulative 
  snakelike

i think wolf was right 
maybe we could be more
than just scary villains 
wh    
oh  wow

we re we re wagging 
no  no  no 
we ll always be bad guys 
faster  faster  my little pigs 
once we steal the meteorite 
we take it straight
to the police 
and all will be forgiven 
i don t know about  all  
but it s a start 
that s strange 
why would marmalade leave
the golden dolphin unprotected 
  because maybe it s a trap 
  or maybe   
wait  wait  wait 
yeah  it was a trap 
well  well  well 
if it isn t my prized pupil 
and you ve brought along
the governor 
or should i say   
the crimson paw 
mm  what an ingenious way
to disguise a zumpango diamond 
hiding it in plain sight 
you got to be kidding me 
what  i m sentimental 
you always did have panache 
and yet  you still fell
right into my trap 
but how did you know
we d even be here 
oh  i got a little tip
from a friend

like  say  a billion dollars 
ooh  i just got a tingle

  governor foxington

ha  how could you know that 
unless   
unless you were conspiring
with a bunch of known criminals 
well   
as a matter of fact 
it s time i came clean
about something 
the truth is i m really   
r really   
really a big fan
of redemption arcs

  yeah 
  mm hmm 
  yeah 
  yep 
chief  do what you need to do

some responsibility 
start a clean state 
take us in  chief

to play the piccolo 
only to find that
my fingers were just
too powerful for that
fragile little instrument 
and that s when i discovered
law enforcement 
i m proud of you  wolf 
you know  a fox and a wolf
are not that different 
you got a good thing
going here  governor

the meteorite back

to take the meteorite
back to my compound
