the usual 
 death to rosenberg    
 retire rosenberg    
 cut off the oxygen   
that s my favourite 
of course  you 
mr grantham   
   did pretty good by me
your last time out 
 rosenberg equals
the government   
   over business   
   the individual over government 
the environment over everything   
   and the indians  oh 
give them whatever they want  
with all due respect 
that wasn t my line 
that was a quote 
from one of your unnamed
senior white house officials 
senior white house bastard 
you should have said 
got in there by   
   stirring up these people 
one against the other 
never fails to amaze me   
   what a man will do
to get an oval office 
yes 
looking for mr sneller 
mr sneller 
yes  mr edwin f  sneller 
hello 
everything is in place 
all the money must be there   
   when i arrive in zurich 
it will be there
if the job is finished 
it will be finished 
may i help you 
i d like to order room service 
what would you like 
 name 
   scrambled eggs 
whole wheat toast   
   and orange juice  please 
it ll be about 15 minutes 
thank you 
when we substitute
threat for an argument   
   violence for principle 
we allow our passion   
   to overcome our
capacity for reason 
passion and self interest
are threats to liberty   
   which brings us   
   to bowers against hardwick 
a police officer
entered mr hardwick s   
   apartment to serve
him a warrant   
   for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public 
they caught him with an open beer 
when he entered
mr hardwick s bedroom   
   he found him in bed with a man 
the officer arrested hardwick   
   for violating
georgia s statute   
   which outlaws sodomy 
even though georgia
dropped the case   
   hardwick challenged   
   the constitutionality
of the statute 
now  what was his claim 
that it violates the
right of privacy 
why 
he s got the right to do
as he pleases in his home 
but what if he decided
to sell drugs   
   at his home or
engage in child abuse 
those actions don t fit
within the right of privacy 
the court  beginning
with griswold   
   has limited the
right of privacy   
   to actions which
are intimate   
   which are deeply personal 
which allow us to
control our lives   
   to define who we are 
but is that a
constitutional claim 
there s no   
   right to define oneself   
   written into the constitution 
it s not even in
the bill of rights 
if the state of
georgia can regulate
hardwick s sexuality   
   engaged in private
with consenting   
   adults  hardwick
cannot be free 
the constitution ensures
limited government 
if there s no right of privacy   
   and georgia can
enforce the statute   
   we sacrifice the
liberty the framers   
   thought they d guaranteed us 
the supreme court
disagreed with you 
they found that the statute   
   did not violate
the right of privacy 
why 
they re wrong 
so all three of you girls
find him irresistible  why 
sexual attraction 
you mean he s just got it 
does he ever 
what you re saying   
   is that if you could clone   
   three of him 
you d all be happy 
okay  tell us  what
is your secret 
i m not sure i can say on tv 
but what i can say is
it s a big secret 
a very big secret 
my goodness gracious 
i can t believe my ears 
hope my mom s not watching 
she hopes so too 
ma  i was just kidding 
ladies  have you changed   
   your opinion about our stud 
you still like him 
i like big guys 
i think your fan
club has increased 
everything has increased 
they found rosenberg around 1 a m 
his nurse was also murdered 
jensen was found
two hours later   
   in some queer club 
voyles called me  wildly upset 
it s hardly good for
fbi s reputation 
he and giminski are on the way 
giminski 
yes  the cia should be involved 
at least for now 
you must wait two
hours to address   
   the nation if we
want an audience 
a coat and tie may
seem a bit rehearsed 
how about a cardigan 
you want me to talk
to the nation in a   
   time of crisis
wearing a sweater 
mr president   
   i ve already told justice   
   to put together
a list of nominees 
restructuring the court
will be your legacy 
mr president 
mr voyles 
does the fbi have any suspects 
it s too soon 
we ll have ballistics
and autopsies later 
i would like to have a report   
   on your security and
where it broke down 
you re assuming it broke down 
we have two dead
judges  both of whom   
   were being
protected by the fbi 
bob  i d like a straight answer 
are these killings in any way   
   linked to the cia   
   or to any other agency   
   of the united
states government 
i m shocked you d think that 
bob  just look into it  okay 
i suggest we meet
back here at five 
five  gentlemen 
thank you 
it s rally around the leader time 
your approval ratings will go   
   through the roof 
that s the weather   
   in new orleans 
this is tim bellew 
we interrupt our program now   
   for a special bulletin 
in a special address 
live from the white house   
   the president of
the united states 
my fellow americans   
   our country has suffered
a grievous loss 
last night   
   supreme court justices
rosenberg and jensen   
   were assassinated 
these assassinations may be an   
   attempt to strike
at the very fabric   
   of our government 
but i can assure each   
   and every american   
   that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished 
everything   
   is being and will be done
to bring the culprit   
   or culprits to justice 
for justice must   
   and shall prevail 
i wish you could have known him   
   when i used to clerk for him 
last time i saw him 
only the mind was left 
that s why they killed him 
that mind was still a threat 
but why kill him now 
when he had so little time left 
maybe they couldn t
take a chance   
   he d last till the elections 
so why jensen 
this president nominated him 
he and rosenberg had almost   
   nothing in common 
that s what they should look for 
decisions on which
they both agreed 
boy  if there ever was a moment   
   for a drink   
one day at a time  right 
we re talking a conspiracy 
then who are the conspirators 
if we ve let foreign
terrorists in 
there ll be hell to
pay politically 
the intelligence
community can t be   
   blamed for a weakness
in immigration 
denton  who are your suspects 
this has to be kept very quiet 
of course 
this is the oval office 
at least 11 underground
army members   
   have been in the d c  area   
   and we suspect
them in at least   
   100 bombings of
abortion clinics   
   porno houses 
gay clubs all over the country 
the truth is 
you don t have a suspect 
correct 
watch your claws 
gray grantham covers the
supreme court for the
washington herald 
you actually interviewed
justice rosenberg   
   before he was shot on 
as it turned out 
the day he died 
did he say anything
that might shed   
   some light on
these dreadful events 
yes  he spoke about things   
   off the record 
appropriately for
a sitting justice 
but i think it would
be appropriate   
   to quote him now 
he said   the campaign waged   
   by the president
was so ruthless   
   in its manipulation of the   
   middle class fears
of minorities   
   had been so exploitive
and divisive   
   that it created a
climate of distrust  
you know  that grantham s
a man after my own heart 
everyone wants to know   
   when you re starting
classes again 
that includes me 
you know what they say 
drinking makes depression worse 
what do they
recommend for anguish 
where ve you been 
the library  i
studied a printout   
   of the supreme court docket 
i even made a list of
possible suspects 
and then threw it away   
   because they d be
obvious to everyone 
then you looked for areas
jensen and rosenberg
had in common 
exactly 
jensen generally
protected the rights   
   of criminal defendants 
some notable exceptions 
he wrote 3 majority opinions   
   protective of the environment 
and almost always supported   
   tax protestors 
so they might have
been assassinated   
   by an insatiable tax collector 
as yet  i rule no one out 
everyone is assuming the motive   
   is hatred or revenge 
or an attempt to influence   
   the social agenda of the court 
what if the issue involved   
   old fashioned material greed 
a case that involves
a great deal of money 
can i help you 
i d like to see this file  please 
why 
it s public record  isn t it 
semi public 
are you familiar with   
   the freedom of information act 
this file has the pleading   
   and correspondence 
the rest is discovery
and the trial 
when was the trial 
last summer 
went on for 2 months 
where s the appeal 
not perfected yet 
i think the deadline
is august 1st 
so  who done it 
you have some obscure
suspect unknown   
   to the fbi and the cia and   
   secret service   
   and 10 000 police departments 
i had one   
   which i have now discarded 
you skipped class 
ignored me for a   
   week  just to throw it away 
let me see it 
don t laugh  it was
ludicrous of me   
   to think i could solve it 
hubris of the young  huh 
don t knock the
hubris that i love 
i m leaving tomorrow 
i m going up to
rosenberg s memorial   
   in washington 
i went through
rosenberg s decisions   
   the other night   
   and in the back of my mind   
   there s an idea   
   to do a book on him 
no one could do it better 
i started making notes   
   about what he meant to me 
surrogate father 
mentor  you know 
i started to get very thirsty 
i deserted you this week 
not the greatest timing 
you re here to study law 
not keep me sober 
it s alice 
want to come out with
me for a burger 
no  thanks 
it might do you good to get out 
i m fine  thanks 
you sure 
yes 
okay  bye 
hey  sarge 
hey  son 
dark coffee  three sugars 
so how s the president 
which one 
not coal  the real one 
cool and mellow 
would you believe
he s all tore up   
   about rosenberg 
and all fired up about   
   restructuring the court 
thinks it ll make
his place in history 
sounds like coal 
what d you get me 
there s a short list of nominees 
the original had 20 or so names 
then they cut it to
8  i gave you 2 
what about the investigation 
i haven t heard much   
   but i ll keep my ears open 
i know you will  thanks 
 name 
i ll see you later 
mellow  mellow  mellow 
martini  please 
good day 
good to see you 
another coffee  please 
you read the grantham article 
it had me running around all day 
coal blasted the
director  saying the   
   judges  names were
leaked by the fbi 
the director said coal
had leaked them   
   himself to test the waters 
coal ran the most
divisive campaign   
   in 20 years   
   and the president did nothing 
i d like to have seen your name   
   on this list of judges 
we all voted you   
   most likely to make the court 
these days  it s hard enough   
   just to make my class 
how old is she  this time 
twenty four  but she s   
   extremely mature 
at 24  she s mature 
i don t know if i believe that 
do you have a photo 
no  i don t  she s
not a puppy dog   
   or a grandchild 
thank god 
who killed them  gavin 
i m just a lawyer with the bureau 
i m not an agent 
but  as i recall 
you have great ears 
to be honest  we
don t have a clue 
my girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay   
   on who might have ordered   
   the assassinations 
your girlfriend has a theory 
here  take a look at
it  you ll get   
   a kick out of the
way her mind works 
is this gray grantham 
 name 
sorry to call at
such a crazy hour 
i m at a pay phone
on my way to work 
i can t call from
home or the office 
what kind of office 
i m an attorney 
private or government 
i d rather not say 
i may know something   
   about rosenberg and jensen 
are you recording this 
can this call be traced 
i m not recording
it or tracing it 
i promise you 
i may know who killed them 
what s your name 
garcia 
that s not your real name 
i think i saw
something at the office
i wasn t supposed to see 
do you have a copy 
i need to think about this 
i understand 
  i m not thinking rationally 
listen  i promise you   
   i will protect you
as a confidential source 
hello 
got you 
mr grantham s not here 
but he left his
car number for you 
it s garcia 
i still don t know what to do 
mr garcia   
   i ve gone to jail
rather than reveal a source 
i know what kind of hell
this must be for you 
you re clearly a
decent human being 
a good citizen 
but could you live
with yourself   
   if you don t
reveal what you know 
morgan i ll get back to you 
taxi 
french authorities
reviewed footage   
   from the airport
cameras in paris   
   and think they
recognized a face   
   that might be
khamel s  the terrorist 
he may have arrived
here on a flight   
   10 hours after we
found jensen s body 
anything else 
maybe a small new wrinkle 
what s the wrinkle 
it s a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours 
voyles is really intrigued by it 
he s afraid it
might be damaging   
   to the president 
how s that 
it s all there in the brief 
it s amateur stuff   
   but how often
does something make
coal sweat and run for cover 
he didn t exactly
sweat in front of us 
but his stone face showed
he wasn t happy 
did he have any symptoms 
as i told you 
the president   
   is here for his
annual check up 
i wish i was in as good shape 
was this timed to counter   
   the age issue in
the next election 
why didn t i think of that 
he hasn t decided
whether to run again 
when will he decide 
do you really expect
me to answer that 
one rumour i can deny is   
   that he checked in
to get away from you 
although could you blame him 
thank you again 
commander  go downstairs   
   and tell them
i have a date for
golf this afternoon 
yes  sir 
it s killing the press
you re so healthy 
good 
now  what s so important 
this is   
   a brief   
   written by an eager beaver   
   law student 
it s a theory about
the assassinations 
and indirectly   
   it implicates the white house 
the premise is so far fetched   
   it s absurd 
but director voyles 
for reasons   
   both you and i can guess   
   is going after it 
well  we   
we can t interfere
with his investigation 
you should ask giminski
to have the cia investigate 
when we confirm that
this is garbage 
you can ask voyles to back off 
it s domestic 
the cia can t go nosing around 
it s illegal 
yes  technically 
what about   
   your friend   
   barr  and the unit 
i think you call it 
i ve spoken to barr 
they re very good   
   for small specific missions   
   but they aren t the cia 
how does it implicate
the white house 
what are there  names 
one name 
someone we both know 
mr president   
i ve decided my agenda
for the future 
i ll stay in bed   
   drink   
   make love   
   and forget the
whole damn business 
you don t approve 
what about the book on rosenberg 
you should write it 
let s go 
 name 
you have the youth  the energy 
the certitude 
you d be perfect 
can i have the keys 
i m perfectly capable of driving 
you ve drunk too much 
give me the keys

did you know the man in the car 
thomas callahan 
it ll be a few minutes 
are you sure that the man who   
   called himself rupert
said he was a cop 
we don t have a record of a cop   
   named rupert 
the computer   
   has no record of
the tag numbers of   
   the car you were
in  must be fake 
i ll go move the car 
i ll be back 
all right 
gavin verheek 
this is darby shaw 
do you know who i am 
we have a mutual friend 
thomas gave you a
copy of my theory 
yes  he did 
where is it 
i read it and i showed it   
   to some folks at the bureau   
   who sent it to director voyles 
has it been seen
outside of the fbi 
i can t answer that 
then i won t tell you   
   what s happened to thomas 
okay  yes 
it s been seen outside the fbi 
but by whom i don t know 
he s dead  gavin 
he was murdered 
someone planted   
   a car bomb for both of us 
i got lucky  but they re after me 
what s your phone number 
where are you 
not so fast 
come on  thomas callahan   
   was my best friend 
i ll have agents pick you up 
you can t stay on the street 
thomas is dead
because he talked   
   to you  tell that to voyles 
turn up the tv 
i can t hear regis and kathie lee

mr president 
sit down  you must see this 
we ve been working
on this all morning 
you have your first audience 
over  roll over 
roll over 
how serious is this pelican thing 
i ve assigned 14
agents in new orleans 
i doubt if there s anything to it 
but we must check it out 
i don t have to tell you   
   how much trouble and pain   
   this nonsense could cause   
   if the press gets wind of it 
oh  well  you got half of it 
good boy 
i just wish   
   that you d   
   back off the thing   
i mean   
   it s a goose chase 
are you asking me to
ignore a suspect 
mr president 
if the press   
   gets wind of what
you re after   
   and starts digging  i ll be 
we ll be crucified 
so you re asking me to back off 
back off and chase
the real suspects 
ignore it for a few
weeks  that s all 
your hatchet man did
a real number on me   
   with the press 
they ate my lunch   
   over the security   
   we provided jensen
and rosenberg 
get that pit bull off my ass and
i ll forget the
pelican theory a while 
may i have your card 
i ll pay with cash 
verheek

what did voyles say 
mr voyles has been unavailable 
but i will try to speak to him   
   later this afternoon 
i expected more 
there s a memorial
service tomorrow

i think we should meet 
darby  i can save your life 
you can t even talk
to the director 
where will you stay 
at the westin  by the river

we ll meet at 6 a m 
all right  bob 
hooten  stay 
this means her little brief
is right on point 
will you notify the president 
notifying the president   
   means notifying coal 
gray grantham s article   
   in tomorrow s
washington herald   
   maintains that  according   
   to unnamed white
house sources   
   the mid eastern
terrorist  khamel   
   may be among those
who assassinated
justices rosenberg and jensen 
those sources say that
a country known   
   for sponsoring
terrorist activity   
   may have hired khamel

at the bandstand   
   and i ll find you 
the riverside bandstand

but i m planning on losing it

   and within an hour
i ll come get you with 3 agents 
mr sneller on line 2 
khamel is dead 
we don t know who did it 
and the girl 
  she s running 
we lost her 
we ll find her 
there s been another murder 
you remember my friend gave   
   the brief to a
friend at the fbi 
the fbi friend was
killed yesterday 
how do you know 
i was holding his hand 
he was shot   
   in broad daylight in a crowd 
i m very sorry 
i m in new york now 
when can you come 
you ll have to give me
something i can confirm 
we get crank calls from
people claiming   
   to know who killed
rosenberg and jensen 
something you can confirm 
please 
such as 
the name of the friend   
   that was murdered
in the car explosion 
take your time 
callahan 
his first name 
thomas 
where did it happen 
in new orleans 
i think that should be enough 
all right 
what s the name of the friend   
   that worked at the fbi 
verheek 
gavin verheek 
voyles  chief counsel 
i think that s more than enough 
i ll be on a plane this afternoon 
you must follow my instructions 
this is gray grantham 
that s right 
got it 
did you follow my instructions 
yes 
you must think i m crazy 
yes  i did   
   till i checked new orleans 
callahan was   
   killed exactly as you said 
i also checked verheek 
according to the fbi   
   they found his
body 2 days ago   
   in a hotel room
early in the morning 
he d been dead for
at least 8 hours 
that can t be 
want to talk about the brief 
everyone i ve told
about the brief is dead 
i ll take my chances 
you can t  under
any circumstances 
use my name   
   or reveal how you got
the information 
or publish anything until
i ve left the country  agreed 
unless i can convince
you otherwise 
you can t 
may i sit down 
mind if i use a tape recorder 
interesting read  isn t it 
what d the president say 
he spoke to voyles   
   who will leave it
alone for a while 
the president asked
voyles to back off 
we thought it was
just another shot   
   in the dark 
now i m not sure 
that s obstruction of justice 
assuming the brief
turns out to be true 
if it does  you ll
be the fall guy 
i won t be the only one 
the old nixon two step 
don t even think that name 
look at the hopeful side 
iran gate  iraq gate   
good chance it won t come out 
what s up with grantham 
we got his car phone 
we haven t been
inside the home yet 
why not 
we almost got caught
by the cleaning lady 
grantham knows about the brief 
he called 3 white
house aides today   
   and god knows who else 
what made you hone in   
   on this particular
case so quickly 
i remembered this piece   
   that  frontline 
did a year ago   
   about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit 
they said he d committed suicide 
but his family thought
it was foul play 
after the assassinations 
i called his family 
they said he had   
   a depressive
problem years before   
   but medication
had taken care of it 
his doctor confirmed
what the family said 
they told the police   
   they were not
convinced it was suicide 
but the police
closed the investigation 
exactly 
that s it 
that s the brief 
maybe we could   
   finish up in the morning 
i ll be up late going
over my notes   
   while they re fresh in my head 
call me when you wake up 
try and get some sleep 
mr grantham 
i know it sounds silly  but   
   would you sleep on the sofa 
no problem 
good night 
listen   
at the risk of sounding
old fashioned   
   isn t it time i
knew your real name 
darby shaw 
what made you pick me 
darby shaw 
callahan was a fan 
does the name victor mattiece   
   mean anything to you 
money 
power 
influence 
he s made and lost several   
   fortunes drilling
oil in louisiana 
in 1979   
   his oil company
punched some holes   
   in terrebonne
parish and hit oil 
a lot of oil 
he needed governmental
permission   
   to dredge a channel though   
   the marshlands
to get the oil out 
enter mattiece 
the great campaign contributor   
   and as night follows day   
   government permission   
   to gouge through
the endangered marshes 
mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars   
   when green fund   
   an obscure
environmental outfit   
   trots down to the
u s  district court   
   in lafayette and
files a lawsuit   
   to stop the entire operation 
of course  mattiece
spares no expense   
   to win the lawsuit 
i don t think there s
a top law firm   
   between houston
and new orleans   
   that he hasn t hired 
fucking pbs 
by the time the
green fund lawyers   
   all two of them   
   wade in  the joint ventures   
   limited partnerships   
   and corporate associations   
   form an impenetrable maze   
   that makes mattiece invisible 
luckily for the green
fund s lawsuit   
   the heart of the
new oil reserve   
   is near a natural
refuge for waterfowl 
osprey  egrets  pelicans 
ducks  cranes  geese 
the pelican becomes the hero 
after 30 years of contamination   
   by ddt and other pesticides   
   the louisiana
brown pelican is   
   on the brink of extinction 
green fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts   
   from around the country
to testify on its behalf 
it takes 7 years for
the pelican suit   
   to go to trial in lake charles 
the 3 man jury 
caring less   
   about the pelicans than jobs   
   votes in favour of mattiece 
but the judge rules to keep the   
   injunction against
drilling because   
   he thinks green
fund has proven   
   its point about the pelican   
   a federally protected species 
and that it will appeal 
what s the lawsuit s status 
from the trial level   
   it will be appealed
to the court   
   of appeals in new
orleans in a month 
any idea what the court will do 
it could be reversed 
then the fun starts 
if either side   
   is unhappy with the court   
   they can appeal
to the supreme court 
from today  how long
would it take   
   for a decision by
the supreme court 
anywhere from 3 to 5 years 
rosenberg would have died 
but another president could be   
   in the white
house when he died 
so if you re mattiece   
   and you don t mind killing   
   a couple of supremes   
   now s the time to kill them 
when you can predict
their replacement 
but why jensen 
he shared one piece   
   of common ground
with rosenberg 
protecting the environment 
i didn t mean to wake you 
you said that mattiece
hired law firms   
   from houston to new orleans 
were there any in washington 
maybe two 
white   blazevich   
   and brim 
stearns   somebody 
great 
i got a call from
a lawyer in d c   
   who saw something   
   concerning
rosenberg and jensen 
he backed out of our meeting 
i never heard from him again 
he gave me a phony name 
but i got his picture 
how 
long story  if he works
at one of these   
   law firms  he could
be our confirmation 
i hope you find him 
come with me to washington 
i ve had enough 
if you re right about mattiece 
then there ll be a cover up 
it ll probably work 
how do you know 
i called the herald
morgue last night 
two years ago  a reporter
did a piece   
   on  violations of
campaign financing laws  
he found out that 
hidden under   
   a lot of other
names of individuals   
   and pac s and corporations 
mattiece was the
biggest contributor   
   by far   
   to the president s campaign 
we ran a picture 
with the article 
of the president and mattiece 
it was taken unbeknownst
to either one 
in it  the president
and mattiece are   
   in front of mattiece s
hunting lodge   
   sipping on some bourbon 
having a good laugh 
the best of pals 
the captions said 
 the president s most secret   
   and generous contributor  
now if your brief is right   
   and it ever reaches
the light of day   
   the president loses
any chance of re election 
the men around the president   
   won t let that happen 
i checked with my sources 
the bureau  langley 
the white house   
   all said the
brief doesn t exist 
you may be the only
witness to the fact   
   there is a brief 
if you disappear   
   so does justice 
is that what callahan would want 
he d want me to see
my 25th birthday 
darby 
if this thing reaches as deep   
   and goes as high as
we think it does   
   they ll do anything
not to be exposed 
where can you hide 
go back to washington 
they re all shook up   
   about you asking
about something 
i expected that 
it s like the gestapo over there 
coal clears everything 
they put me on medical leave   
   for 90 days 
what s wrong with you 
  i don t know 
one thing i do know 
i ve never seen it this bad 
i m worried about you  son 
gray  it s darby 
when you hear this 
i ll be in the air   
   on my way to nowhere 
try to understand 
i can t keep you on that story 
i m sending you to arkansas 
the times  the networks   
   are there checking
out the judge   
   they re about to nominate 
i need more time 
for what 
you lost your white house sources 
you ve lost garcia and the girl 
not your best week 
you can t take me off this story 
what do you know for fact 
an unidentified guy says   
   he knows about
the assassinations 
he works in a law
firm  you don t know   
   which one  he s
cut off all contact 
that s not very promising 
there s something
there  i can smell it 
evidence based on
olfactory prowess is   
   inadmissible  in
case you didn t know 
then there s a girl   
   with her bird
brief for which   
   you can t get confirmation 
not yet 
she also cut off
contact  something   
   that s reaching
epidemic proportions 
they re waiting for you upstairs 
everything she said about   
   the two deaths
has been confirmed 
the fbi says verheek was killed   
   in some hotel mugging 
that s what you told me 
  that s what they told me 
and they said they knew of   
   no connection with
the assassinations 
what else would they say 
i m interested in
what they did say 
let s look at what
i have confirmed 
callahan was killed 
he was a professor 
they had an affair 
give it to the times picayune 
maybe they want some gossip 
i also found that
callahan clerked   
   for rosenberg 20 years ago 
life is filled with
odd coincidence 
not a coincidence if the brief 
you have no confirmation
there is a brief 
i confirmed verheek
and callahan   
   were friends 
they met here a few weeks ago 
when he must have
given him the brief 
supposition again 
i ve confirmed the
pelican lawsuit 
on which she has based
her suppositions 
it s all just suppositions 
you know what mattiece could do 
i know what he has done already 
he has a bizarre history 
so do i  according
to my ex wife  it   
   doesn t mean that
i killed the justices 
but it means it s worth exploring 
go down to that crappy
cabin of yours   
   on the weekend 
hole up  retrench 
prove you have a
way to revitalize   
   this story  and i
might keep you on it 
but if i were you  i d check
where to eat in little rock 
this is the story of   
   a mystery that
may never be solved 
the story of a brilliant
young lawyer   
   who loved this land   
   and wanted to fight
to preserve it   
   from the inroads of man   
   until his abrupt death   
   a few months ago 
his body was found
in a lonely cottage 
near the louisiana bayou he loved 
there was a bullet in his head   
   and a gun beside him 
the coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide 
but he died sitting at a computer 
surrounded by his notes   
   for what he called   
   the case he was born to win 
his friends and family ask   
   would anyone commit suicide   
   in such a manner   
   at such a time 
tonight  frontline explores
a young idealist s death 
who s there 
it s darby 
i got your message 
if they bugged your phone 
they d think i d left the country 
did you find that lawyer in d c  
not yet 
my editor wants to take me
off the story 
i could help you find him 
how d you find me 
i called your editor 
he told you 
i told him i was
your sister mary   
   from out of town
and couldn t find you 
how d you know i
had a sister mary 
you re not the only
one doing research 
it was a beautiful service 
thank you  mr president 
i ll have an announcement
after the weekend 
it was the right thing to do 
no matter where
the body was found 
you can t announce
the nominations next week 
you said they d be
vetted this weekend 
there must be a change in plans 
i don t understand 
the pelican brief 
what about the pelican brief 
i thought that was
ancient history 
we believe that grantham s
gotten hold of it 
mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that 
not if it s true 
you think it s true 
i know what grantham will write 
 a man who gave
the president millions   
   had two supreme
court justices killed   
   so the president   
   could appoint
more reasonable judges   
   so his oil could be harvested  
if voyles says you told
him to back off   
   the case  we face
an obstruction charge 
oh  jesus 
there s a way to handle this 
handle it how 
we appoint two nature lovers   
   to the court 
good environmentalists   
   who d kill mattiece
and his oil field 
meet with voyles 
in the presence   
   of the attorney general   
   and demand an investigation   
   into mattiece 
i ll leak the brief
to every reporter in town 
then we ride out the storm 
but there has to be
some way to keep   
   this information
from coming out 
i m working on it 
what 
how 
mr president   
   you don t want to know 
what s this all about 
a trip to mt  vernon
will do you good 
are you losing it 
first i order you to
go to little rock 
you refuse to go 
you refuse to tell me why 
then you order me   
   your boss  i might add   
   to drop everything   
   and meet you at george s place 
i thought of making
you unemployed   
   but you d sue me
for discrimination 
she s here 
the bird girl 
  she s here 
you could ve told me 
 name 
by the way  refusing to tell me   
   where you could be reached   
   didn t leave a good impression 
it s too risky to go
to my apartment   
   or to the job 
where have you been 
 name 
this is a hell of a time   
   to punch notches in your belt 
we re not in the same hotel 
she s helping me find garcia

it s the only way she d play 
so what if you can t find garcia 
we go to plan b 
what s that 
we attack the lawyers directly 
what if it s another firm 
we go to plan c 
what s that 
we didn t go that far

i know she s been
through an ordeal 
when did you people   
   ever respect anyone s privacy 
i feel that way
about most reporters 
but her husband called me   
   3 times before he died 
i believe his death
wasn t accidental 
she doesn t want to talk 
get the hell out of here 
you change your mind   
   i ll be at this number 
mr grantham 
yes 
this is mrs morgan 
do you still want to see me 
did you know your
husband called me

   anything about
those dead judges 
i have no idea 
did he keep any   
   unusual documents   
   or papers 
we have a lock box at the bank   
   for deed and wills 
i looked at it last thursday 
there was nothing unusual in it 
on saturday morning   
   i was going through his   
   desk in the bedroom 
i found something a bit unusual 
a key 
a key to what 
another lock box 
which bank 
riggs bank 
we ve never banked there 
and you knew nothing
about this other   
   box 
not until saturday morning 
i figured   
   i ll run by when
i felt up to it 
maybe you should
check it  mrs morgan 
could be a clue to who killed him 
are you saying
curtis was killed   
   because he knew something   
   about the a ssassinations 
that s exactly what i m saying 
do you think there   
   may be papers in
the safe deposit box   
   that may reveal
what curtis knew   
   about the a ssassinations 
there could be 
my child s lost one parent 
i can t let her lose another 
i ll check it for you 
no one has to know
you have the key 
they will only give
it to his wife 
my partner s a woman

if you find something

it s a four page affidavit   
   signed under oath 
it s dated the day before
the last time he called me 
he worked at white   blazevich   
   in the oil and gas
section for 5 years 
listen to this 
during that time   
   he worked for a client who   
   was engaged in a
lawsuit in louisiana 
the client was a man
named victor mattiece   
   who he s never met 
lots about the lawsuit 
how desperate mattiece
was to win it 
just as if you wrote it 
a partner named sims wakefield   
   supervised the case for w   b 
morgan worked on a
peripherated case 
he took files and documents   
   that wakefield left for him   
   not related to the case 
when he got back to
his own office  he   
   found a memo on the
bottom of the stack 
he d inadvertently taken it
from wakefield s desk 
a copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit 
he copied the memo
and left the memo   
   under the files on his desk 
next stop 
washington herald 
no  stop 
get out of the car 
there was a car explosion   
   in a garage near
the riggs bank 
the police traced the car
to a leasing agency 
it was rented
yesterday by grantham 
have you heard from grantham 
not since yesterday 
i should ve taken
him off that story 
what story 
see what you can find 
smith keen   
   meet darby shaw 
so  mr grantham   
   what the hell is going on 
sweetheart  i m down here
in the basement 
it s about two in the morning 
this is   
   an affidavit   
   concerning a memo
i found on my desk 
i m going to trust you
to do with it what you will 
the memo s from velmano 
he s a senior partner 
it was dated september 28th   
   addressed to
wakefield and it read 
 sims  advise client
research is complete 
the bench will sit much softer   
   if the old man is retired 
the second retirement
is a bit unusual 
jensen  of all people 
advise further that the pelican   
   should arrive
here in 4 years   
   assuming other factors  
there s no signature 
then justices
rosenberg and jensen   
   were killed 
i firmly believe that this is   
   the work of mattiece
and his associates 
memo doesn t mention mattiece 
but it refers to a client 
wakefield had no other clients 
and no client had
as much to gain   
   from the new court 
i thought that i
was protecting us   
   by not revealing what i found 
you ll only see this if i m gone 
so i will have failed 
i m sorry  sweetheart 
i ll always be with you 
always 
this is marty velmano 
what a pleasure 
what can i do for you 
we re doing a story
about victor mattiece   
   and his involvement
in the deaths   
   of rosenberg and jensen 
great  we ll sue you
for the next 20   
   years  you ll be
named as a defendant 
oh  this will be great 
victor mattiece will
own the herald 
have you heard of
the pelican brief 
we have a copy of it 
we also have a copy of a memo   
   sent by you to
sims wakefield   
   in which you suggest
your client s   
   position would be
greatly improved   
   by the removal of rosenberg   
   and jensen from the court 
i noticed you waited till five 
an hour earlier 
we could ve   
   run to court 
stopped this 
you deny you wrote the memo 
it s a fabrication 
you have no lawsuit 
mr velmano 
you know it 
you son of a bitch 
mr coal 
have you read the pelican brief 
i have 
we re running a story
which verifies   
   the facts set
forth in that brief 
we ve confirmed mattiece   
   contributed over  4 million   
   to the president s
last campaign 
4 200 000  all through
legal channels 
that s right 
we believe the
white house tried   
   to obstruct the
fbi investigation   
   and we wonder
if there are any comments 
the white house denies   
   any direct or
indirect involvement   
   in this investigation 
you ve received some
bad information 
mr voyles  it s grantham 
we re running a story
detailing a conspiracy   
   in the murders of
rosenberg and jensen 
we re naming mattiece  an oil   
   speculator  and
two of his lawyers 
we believe the fbi
knew about mattiece 
but didn t investigate   
   at the urging of
the white house 
any comments 
i think we ll have great
success with these people 
they were really very pleased   
   and genuinely cooperative 
what s up 
you know gray grantham 
and this is darby shaw 
so you re the little lady   
   who started this
great brouhaha 
i think you have me confused   
   with the president s friend 
i have some comments 
for the record 
first  we got the pelican brief   
   two weeks ago   
   and submitted it
to the white house   
   on the same day 
it was not considered
high priority in   
   the investigation
until gavin verheek   
   special counsel
to the director 
was found murdered 
did the white house interfere   
   in the fbi
investigation of mattiece 
i ll discuss it   
   off the record 
last wednesday the
president asked me   
   to ignore victor
mattiece as a suspect 
in his words   
   he asked me to  back off  
i have a tape   
   which i will allow
no one to hear   
   unless the president
first denies this 
so what do you do now 
there ll be a grand jury by   
   noon tomorrow 
quick indictments 
and we ll find mattiece 
i d like a few minutes alone
with ms shaw 
if she doesn t mind 
it s her call 
i d like mr grantham to stay 
what s next for you 
who killed the man
disguised as verheek 
oh  you mean the assassin  khamel 
off the record 
khamel was killed   
   by a contract operative   
   hired independently by the cia 
rupert 
he probably has 20 names 
why was he following her 
i think the brief initially   
   scared giminski
more than anyone 
and he probably   
   sent rupert   
   to trail darby   
   in part to watch 
and in part to protect 
we can help 
what do you want 
to leave the country  alone 
all right 
we ll get you out of here 
put you on my plane 
we ll fly you anywhere you want   
   and you can disappear 
but you must allow
me to contact you   
   through mr grantham   
   if  and only if 
it becomes urgently necessary 
that s fine 
i want no one on the plane but me 
gray and the pilots 
after take off  i ll
tell the pilot   
   where to go 
he has to file a flight plan
before he can leave 
you re the director of the fbi 
set it up 
our guest today is
gray grantham   
   who has  as just
about everyone   
   in america knows   
   revealed the plot behind the   
   assassinations of
rosenberg and jensen 
the ripple effects
of this story   
   just don t seem to stop 
as of this broadcast 
victor mattiece 
one of the country s
richest men   
   has been indicted 
along with   
   4 aides and lawyers 
fletcher coal  the
president s chief   
   of staff  has resigned 
and we re getting
strong indications   
   that the president himself   
   will not run again 
that s what we know 
let s get to what we don t 
we know the pelican
brief was written   
   by a woman named darby shaw   
   but we don t know who that is 
who is darby shaw 
that s a question for darby shaw 
next question 
speaking for many of
our colleagues   
   who are in a
feeding frenzy to   
   interview her   
   where is darby shaw 
that s also a question
for darby shaw 
but she s not available   
   to answer questions   
   until the feeding frenzy stops 
does that mean   
   you don t know where she is 
i didn t say that 
then you do know 
i take it this
cryptic smile means   
   you re not answering 
in view of all this 
you know that   
   there s speculation   
   that this woman is a figment   
   of your imagination 
that you created her   
   from a lot of
different sources 
just as there are
people who believe   
   there was no deep throat
