the usual
death to rosenberg
retire rosenberg
cut off the oxygen
thats my favourite
of course you
mr grantham
did pretty good by me
your last time out
rosenberg equals
the government
over business
the individual over government
the environment over everything
and the indians oh
give them whatever they want
with all due respect
that wasnt my line
that was a quote
from one of your unnamed
senior white house officials
senior white house bastard
you should have said
got in there by
stirring up these people
one against the other
never fails to amaze me
what a man will do
to get an oval office
yes
looking for mr sneller
mr sneller
yes mr edwin f sneller
hello
everything is in place
all the money must be there
when i arrive in zurich
it will be there
if the job is finished
it will be finished
may i help you
id like to order room service
what would you like
name
scrambled eggs
wholewheat toast
and orange juice please
itll be about 15 minutes
thank you
when we substitute
threat for an argument
violence for principle
we allow our passion
to overcome our
capacity for reason
passion and selfinterest
are threats to liberty
which brings us
to bowers against hardwick
a police officer
entered mr hardwicks
apartment to serve
him a warrant
for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public
they caught him with an open beer
when he entered
mr hardwicks bedroom
he found him in bed with a man
the officer arrested hardwick
for violating
georgias statute
which outlaws sodomy
even though georgia
dropped the case
hardwick challenged
the constitutionality
of the statute
now what was his claim
that it violates the
right of privacy
why
hes got the right to do
as he pleases in his home
but what if he decided
to sell drugs
at his home or
engage in child abuse
those actions dont fit
within the right of privacy
the court beginning
with griswold
has limited the
right of privacy
to actions which
are intimate
which are deeply personal
which allow us to
control our lives
to define who we are
but is that a
constitutional claim
theres no
right to define oneself
written into the constitution
its not even in
the bill of rights
if the state of
georgia can regulate
hardwicks sexuality
engaged in private
with consenting
adults hardwick
cannot be free
the constitution ensures
limited government
if theres no right of privacy
and georgia can
enforce the statute
we sacrifice the
liberty the framers
thought theyd guaranteed us
the supreme court
disagreed with you
they found that the statute
did not violate
the right of privacy
why
theyre wrong
so all three of you girls
find him irresistible why
sexual attraction
you mean hes just got it
does he ever
what youre saying
is that if you could clone
three of him
youd all be happy
okay tell us what
is your secret
im not sure i can say on tv
but what i can say is
its a big secret
a very big secret
my goodness gracious
i cant believe my ears
hope my moms not watching
she hopes so too
ma i was just kidding
ladies have you changed
your opinion about our stud
you still like him
i like big guys
i think your fan
club has increased
everything has increased
they found rosenberg around 1 am
his nurse was also murdered
jensen was found
two hours later
in some queer club
voyles called me wildly upset
its hardly good for
fbis reputation
he and giminski are on the way
giminski
yes the cia should be involved
at least for now
you must wait two
hours to address
the nation if we
want an audience
a coat and tie may
seem a bit rehearsed
how about a cardigan
you want me to talk
to the nation in a
time of crisis
wearing a sweater
mr president
ive already told justice
to put together
a list of nominees
restructuring the court
will be your legacy
mr president
mr voyles
does the fbi have any suspects
its too soon
well have ballistics
and autopsies later
i would like to have a report
on your security and
where it broke down
youre assuming it broke down
we have two dead
judges both of whom
were being
protected by the fbi
bob id like a straight answer
are these killings in any way
linked to the cia
or to any other agency
of the united
states government
im shocked youd think that
bob just look into it okay
i suggest we meet
back here at five
five gentlemen
thank you
its rallyaroundtheleader time
your approval ratings will go
through the roof
thats the weather
in new orleans
this is tim bellew
we interrupt our program now
for a special bulletin
in a special address
live from the white house
the president of
the united states
my fellow americans
our country has suffered
a grievous loss
last night
supreme court justices
rosenberg and jensen
were assassinated
these assassinations may be an
attempt to strike
at the very fabric
of our government
but i can assure each
and every american
that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished
everything
is being and will be done
to bring the culprit
or culprits to justice
for justice must
and shall prevail
i wish you could have known him
when i used to clerk for him
last time i saw him
only the mind was left
thats why they killed him
that mind was still a threat
but why kill him now
when he had so little time left
maybe they couldnt
take a chance
hed last till the elections
so why jensen
this president nominated him
he and rosenberg had almost
nothing in common
thats what they should look for
decisions on which
they both agreed
boy if there ever was a moment
for a drink
one day at a time right
were talking a conspiracy
then who are the conspirators
if weve let foreign
terrorists in
therell be hell to
pay politically
the intelligence
community cant be
blamed for a weakness
in immigration
denton who are your suspects
this has to be kept very quiet
of course
this is the oval office
at least 11 underground
army members
have been in the dc area
and we suspect
them in at least
100 bombings of
abortion clinics
porno houses
gay clubs all over the country
the truth is
you dont have a suspect
correct
watch your claws
gray grantham covers the
supreme court for the
washington herald
you actually interviewed
justice rosenberg
before he was shot on
as it turned out
the day he died
did he say anything
that might shed
some light on
these dreadful events
yes he spoke about things
off the record
appropriately for
a sitting justice
but i think it would
be appropriate
to quote him now
he said the campaign waged
by the president
was so ruthless
in its manipulation of the
middleclass fears
of minorities
had been so exploitive
and divisive
that it created a
climate of distrust
you know that granthams
a man after my own heart
everyone wants to know
when youre starting
classes again
that includes me
you know what they say
drinking makes depression worse
what do they
recommend for anguish
whereve you been
the library i
studied a printout
of the supreme court docket
i even made a list of
possible suspects
and then threw it away
because theyd be
obvious to everyone
then you looked for areas
jensen and rosenberg
had in common
exactly
jensen generally
protected the rights
of criminal defendants
some notable exceptions
he wrote 3 majority opinions
protective of the environment
and almost always supported
tax protestors
so they might have
been assassinated
by an insatiable tax collector
as yet i rule no one out
everyone is assuming the motive
is hatred or revenge
or an attempt to influence
the social agenda of the court
what if the issue involved
oldfashioned material greed
a case that involves
a great deal of money
can i help you
id like to see this file please
why
its public record isnt it
semipublic
are you familiar with
the freedom of information act
this file has the pleading
and correspondence
the rest is discovery
and the trial
when was the trial
last summer
went on for 2 months
wheres the appeal
not perfected yet
i think the deadline
is august 1st
so who done it
you have some obscure
suspect unknown
to the fbi and the cia and
secret service
and 10000 police departments
i had one
which i have now discarded
you skipped class
ignored me for a
week just to throw it away
let me see it
dont laugh it was
ludicrous of me
to think i could solve it
hubris of the young huh
dont knock the
hubris that i love
im leaving tomorrow
im going up to
rosenbergs memorial
in washington
i went through
rosenbergs decisions
the other night
and in the back of my mind
theres an idea
to do a book on him
no one could do it better
i started making notes
about what he meant to me
surrogate father
mentor you know
i started to get very thirsty
i deserted you this week
not the greatest timing
youre here to study law
not keep me sober
its alice
want to come out with
me for a burger
no thanks
it might do you good to get out
im fine thanks
you sure
yes
okay bye
hey sarge
hey son
dark coffee three sugars
so hows the president
which one
not coal the real one
cool and mellow
would you believe
hes all tore up
about rosenberg
and all fired up about
restructuring the court
thinks itll make
his place in history
sounds like coal
whatd you get me
theres a short list of nominees
the original had 20 or so names
then they cut it to
8 i gave you 2
what about the investigation
i havent heard much
but ill keep my ears open
i know you will thanks
name
ill see you later
mellow mellow mellow
martini please
good day
good to see you
another coffee please
you read the grantham article
it had me running around all day
coal blasted the
director saying the
judges names were
leaked by the fbi
the director said coal
had leaked them
himself to test the waters
coal ran the most
divisive campaign
in 20 years
and the president did nothing
id like to have seen your name
on this list of judges
we all voted you
most likely to make the court
these days its hard enough
just to make my class
how old is she this time
twentyfour but shes
extremely mature
at 24 shes mature
i dont know if i believe that
do you have a photo
no i dont shes
not a puppy dog
or a grandchild
thank god
who killed them gavin
im just a lawyer with the bureau
im not an agent
but as i recall
you have great ears
to be honest we
dont have a clue
my girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay
on who might have ordered
the assassinations
your girlfriend has a theory
here take a look at
it youll get
a kick out of the
way her mind works
is this gray grantham
name
sorry to call at
such a crazy hour
im at a pay phone
on my way to work
i cant call from
home or the office
what kind of office
im an attorney
private or government
id rather not say
i may know something
about rosenberg and jensen
are you recording this
can this call be traced
im not recording
it or tracing it
i promise you
i may know who killed them
whats your name
garcia
thats not your real name
i think i saw
something at the office
i wasnt supposed to see
do you have a copy
i need to think about this
i understand
im not thinking rationally
listen i promise you
i will protect you
as a confidential source
hello
got you
mr granthams not here
but he left his
car number for you
its garcia
i still dont know what to do
mr garcia
ive gone to jail
rather than reveal a source
i know what kind of hell
this must be for you
youre clearly a
decent human being
a good citizen
but could you live
with yourself
if you dont
reveal what you know
morgan ill get back to you
taxi
french authorities
reviewed footage
from the airport
cameras in paris
and think they
recognized a face
that might be
khamels the terrorist
he may have arrived
here on a flight
10 hours after we
found jensens body
anything else
maybe a small new wrinkle
whats the wrinkle
its a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours
voyles is really intrigued by it
hes afraid it
might be damaging
to the president
hows that
its all there in the brief
its amateur stuff
but how often
does something make
coal sweat and run for cover
he didnt exactly
sweat in front of us
but his stone face showed
he wasnt happy
did he have any symptoms
as i told you
the president
is here for his
annual checkup
i wish i was in as good shape
was this timed to counter
the age issue in
the next election
why didnt i think of that
he hasnt decided
whether to run again
when will he decide
do you really expect
me to answer that
one rumour i can deny is
that he checked in
to get away from you
although could you blame him
thank you again
commander go downstairs
and tell them
i have a date for
golf this afternoon
yes sir
its killing the press
youre so healthy
good
now whats so important
this is
a brief
written by an eagerbeaver
law student
its a theory about
the assassinations
and indirectly
it implicates the white house
the premise is so farfetched
its absurd
but director voyles
for reasons
both you and i can guess
is going after it
well we
we cant interfere
with his investigation
you should ask giminski
to have the cia investigate
when we confirm that
this is garbage
you can ask voyles to back off
its domestic
the cia cant go nosing around
its illegal
yes technically
what about
your friend
barr and the unit
i think you call it
ive spoken to barr
theyre very good
for small specific missions
but they arent the cia
how does it implicate
the white house
what are there names
one name
someone we both know
mr president
ive decided my agenda
for the future
ill stay in bed
drink
make love
and forget the
whole damn business
you dont approve

ive assigned 14
agents in new orleans
i doubt if theres anything to it
but we must check it out
i dont have to tell you
how much trouble and pain
this nonsense could cause
if the press gets wind of it
oh well you got half of it
good boy
i just wish
that youd
back off the thing
i mean
its a goose chase
are you asking me to
ignore a suspect
mr president
if the press
gets wind of what
youre after
and starts digging ill be
well be crucified
so youre asking me to back off
back off and chase
the real suspects
ignore it for a few
weeks thats all
your hatchet man did
a real number on me
with the press
they ate my lunch
over the security

ill forget the
pelican theory a while

in broad daylight in a crowd
im very sorry
im in new york now

we get crank calls from
people claiming
to know who killed
rosenberg and jensen
something you can confirm
please
such as
the name of the friend
that was murdered
in the car explosion
take your time
callahan
his first name
thomas
where did it happen
in new orleans
i think that should be enough

till i checked new orleans
callahan was
killed exactly as you said
i also checked verheek
according to the fbi
they found his
body 2 days ago
in a hotel room
early in the morning
hed been dead for
at least 8 hours
that cant be
want to talk about the brief
everyone ive told
about the brief is dead
ill take my chances
you cant under
any circumstances
use my name
or reveal how you got
the information
or publish anything until
ive left the country agreed
unless i can convince
you otherwise
you cant
may i sit down
mind if i use a tape recorder
interesting read isnt it
whatd the president say
he spoke to voyles
who will leave it
alone for a while
the president asked
voyles to back off
we thought it was
just another shot
in the dark
now im not sure
thats obstruction of justice
assuming the brief
turns out to be true
if it does youll
be the fall guy
i wont be the only one
the old nixon twostep
dont even think that name
look at the hopeful side
iran gate iraq gate
good chance it wont come out
whats up with grantham
we got his car phone
we havent been
inside the home yet
why not
we almost got caught
by the cleaning lady
grantham knows about the brief
he called 3 white
house aides today
and god knows who else
what made you hone in
on this particular
case so quickly
i remembered this piece
that frontline
did a year ago
about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit
they said hed committed suicide
but his family thought
it was foul play
after the assassinations
i called his family
they said he had
a depressive
problem years before
but medication
had taken care of it
his doctor confirmed
what the family said
they told the police
they were not
convinced it was suicide
but the police
closed the investigation
exactly
thats it
thats the brief
maybe we could
finish up in the morning
ill be up late going
over my notes
while theyre fresh in my head
call me when you wake up
try and get some sleep
mr grantham
i know it sounds silly but
would you sleep on the sofa
no problem
good night
listen
at the risk of sounding
oldfashioned
isnt it time i
knew your real name
darby shaw
what made you pick me
darby shaw
callahan was a fan
does the name victor mattiece
mean anything to you
money
power
influence
hes made and lost several
fortunes drilling
oil in louisiana
in 1979
his oil company
punched some holes
in terrebonne
parish and hit oil
a lot of oil
he needed governmental
permission
to dredge a channel though
the marshlands
to get the oil out
enter mattiece
the great campaign contributor
and as night follows day
government permission
to gouge through
the endangered marshes
mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars
when green fund
an obscure
environmental outfit
trots down to the
us district court
in lafayette and
files a lawsuit
to stop the entire operation
of course mattiece
spares no expense
to win the lawsuit
i dont think theres
a top law firm
between houston
and new orleans
that he hasnt hired
fucking pbs
by the time the
green fund lawyers
all two of them
wade in the joint ventures
limited partnerships
and corporate associations
form an impenetrable maze
that makes mattiece invisible
luckily for the green
funds lawsuit
the heart of the
new oil reserve
is near a natural
refuge for waterfowl
osprey egrets pelicans
ducks cranes geese
the pelican becomes the hero
after 30 years of contamination
by ddt and other pesticides
the louisiana
brown pelican is
on the brink of extinction
green fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts
from around the country
to testify on its behalf
it takes 7 years for
the pelican suit
to go to trial in lake charles
the 3man jury
caring less
about the pelicans than jobs
votes in favour of mattiece
but the judge rules to keep the
injunction against
drilling because
he thinks green
fund has proven
its point about the pelican
a federallyprotected species
and that it will appeal
whats the lawsuits status
from the trial level
it will be appealed
to the court
of appeals in new
orleans in a month
any idea what the court will do
it could be reversed
then the fun starts
if either side
is unhappy with the court
they can appeal
to the supreme court
from today how long
would it take
for a decision by
the supreme court
anywhere from 3 to 5 years
rosenberg would have died
but another president could be
in the white
house when he died
so if youre mattiece
and you dont mind killing
a couple of supremes
nows the time to kill them
when you can predict
their replacement
but why jensen
he shared one piece
of common ground
with rosenberg
protecting the environment
i didnt mean to wake you
you said that mattiece
hired law firms
from houston to new orleans
were there any in washington
maybe two
white  blazevich
and brim
stearns  somebody
great
i got a call from
a lawyer in dc
who saw something
concerning
rosenberg and jensen
he backed out of our meeting
i never heard from him again
he gave me a phony name
but i got his picture
how
long story if he works
at one of these
law firms he could
be our confirmation
i hope you find him
come with me to washington
ive had enough
if youre right about mattiece
then therell be a coverup
itll probably work
how do you know
i called the herald
morgue last night
two years ago a reporter
did a piece
on violations of
campaign financing laws
he found out that
hidden under
a lot of other
names of individuals
and pacs and corporations
mattiece was the
biggest contributor
by far
to the presidents campaign
we ran a picture
with the article
of the president and mattiece
it was taken unbeknownst
to either one
in it the president
and mattiece are
in front of mattieces
hunting lodge
sipping on some bourbon
having a good laugh
the best of pals
the captions said
the presidents most secret
and generous contributor
now if your brief is right
and it ever reaches
the light of day
the president loses
any chance of reelection
the men around the president
wont let that happen
i checked with my sources
the bureau langley
the white house
all said the
brief doesnt exist
you may be the only
witness to the fact
there is a brief
if you disappear
so does justice
is that what callahan would want
hed want me to see
my 25th birthday
darby
if this thing reaches as deep
and goes as high as
we think it does
theyll do anything
not to be exposed
where can you hide
go back to washington
theyre all shook up
about you asking
about something
i expected that
its like the gestapo over there
coal clears everything
they put me on medical leave
for 90 days
whats wrong with you
i dont know
one thing i do know
ive never seen it this bad
im worried about you son
gray its darby
when you hear this
ill be in the air
on my way to nowhere
try to understand
i cant keep you on that story
im sending you to arkansas
the times the networks
are there checking
out the judge
theyre about to nominate
i need more time
for what
you lost your white house sources
youve lost garcia and the girl
not your best week
you cant take me off this story
what do you know for fact
an unidentified guy says
he knows about
the assassinations
he works in a law
firm you dont know
which one hes
cut off all contact
thats not very promising
theres something
there i can smell it
evidence based on
olfactory prowess is
inadmissible in
case you didnt know
then theres a girl
with her bird
brief for which
you cant get confirmation
not yet
she also cut off
contact something
thats reaching
epidemic proportions
theyre waiting for you upstairs
everything she said about
the two deaths
has been confirmed
the fbi says verheek was killed
in some hotel mugging
thats what you told me
thats what they told me
and they said they knew of
no connection with
the assassinations
what else would they say
im interested in
what they did say
lets look at what
i have confirmed
callahan was killed
he was a professor
they had an affair
give it to the timespicayune
maybe they want some gossip
i also found that
callahan clerked
for rosenberg 20 years ago
life is filled with
odd coincidence
not a coincidence if the brief
you have no confirmation
there is a brief
i confirmed verheek
and callahan
were friends
they met here a few weeks ago
when he must have
given him the brief
supposition again
ive confirmed the
pelican lawsuit
on which she has based
her suppositions
its all just suppositions
you know what mattiece could do
i know what he has done already
he has a bizarre history
so do i according
to my exwife it
doesnt mean that
i killed the justices
but it means its worth exploring
go down to that crappy
cabin of yours
on the weekend
hole up retrench
prove you have a
way to revitalize
this story and i
might keep you on it
but if i were you id check
where to eat in little rock
this is the story of
a mystery that
may never be solved
the story of a brilliant
young lawyer
who loved this land
and wanted to fight
to preserve it
from the inroads of man
until his abrupt death
a few months ago
his body was found
in a lonely cottage
near the louisiana bayou he loved
there was a bullet in his head
and a gun beside him
the coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide
but he died sitting at a computer
surrounded by his notes
for what he called
the case he was born to win
his friends and family ask
would anyone commit suicide
in such a manner
at such a time
tonight frontline explores
a young idealists death
whos there
its darby
i got your message
if they bugged your phone
theyd think id left the country
did you find that lawyer in dc
not yet
my editor wants to take me
off the story
i could help you find him
howd you find me
i called your editor
he told you
i told him i was
your sister mary
from out of town
and couldnt find you
howd you know i
had a sister mary
youre not the only
one doing research
it was a beautiful service
thank you mr president
ill have an announcement
after the weekend
it was the right thing to do
no matter where
the body was found
you cant announce
the nominations next week
you said theyd be
vetted this weekend
there must be a change in plans
i dont understand
the pelican brief
what about the pelican brief
i thought that was
ancient history
we believe that granthams
gotten hold of it
mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that
not if its true
you think its true
i know what grantham will write
a man who gave
the president millions
had two supreme
court justices killed
so the president
could appoint
more reasonable judges
so his oil could be harvested
if voyles says you told
him to back off
the case we face
an obstruction charge
oh jesus
theres a way to handle this
handle it how
we appoint two naturelovers
to the court
good environmentalists
whod kill mattiece
and his oil field
meet with voyles
in the presence
of the attorney general
and demand an investigation
into mattiece
ill leak the brief
to every reporter in town
then we ride out the storm
but there has to be
some way to keep
this information
from coming out
im working on it
what
how
mr president
you dont want to know
whats this all about
a trip to mt vernon
will do you good
are you losing it
first i order you to
go to little rock
you refuse to go
you refuse to tell me why
then you order me
your boss i might add
to drop everything
and meet you at georges place
i thought of making
you unemployed
but youd sue me
for discrimination
shes here
the bird girl
shes here
you couldve told me
name
by the way refusing to tell me
where you could be reached
didnt leave a good impression
its too risky to go
to my apartment
or to the job
where have you been
name
this is a hell of a time
to punch notches in your belt
were not in the same hotel
shes helping me find garcia
it sounds like shes in control
its the only way shed play
so what if you cant find garcia

good evening
im grantham of the herald
this is my assistant
could we see mrs morgan
im her father
she wont talk
i respect her privacy
i know shes been
through an ordeal
when did you people
ever respect anyones privacy
i feel that way
about most reporters
but her husband called me
3 times before he died
i believe his death
wasnt accidental
she doesnt want to talk
get the hell out of here
you change your mind
ill be at this number
mr grantham
yes
this is mrs morgan
do you still want to see me
did you know your
husband called me
no how would he know
anything about
those dead judges
i have no idea
did he keep any
unusual documents
or papers
we have a lock box at the bank
for deed and wills
i looked at it last thursday
there was nothing unusual in it
on saturday morning
i was going through his
desk in the bedroom
i found something a bit unusual
a key
a key to what
another lock box
which bank
riggs bank
weve never banked there
and you knew nothing
about this other
box
not until saturday morning
i figured
ill run by when
i felt up to it
maybe you should
check it mrs morgan
could be a clue to who killed him
are you saying
curtis was killed
because he knew something
about the a ssassinations
thats exactly what im saying
do you think there
may be papers in
the safedeposit box
that may reveal
what curtis knew
about the a ssassinations
there could be
my childs lost one parent
i cant let her lose another
ill check it for you
no one has to know
you have the key
they will only give
it to his wife
my partners a woman
shes trustworthy
i would have one condition
if you find something
that disparages
my husband in any
way you cant use it
you have my word mrs morgan
where are the safedeposit boxes
down those steps
i need access to a box please
the number please
616
this box was rented two weeks ago
yes
i assume youre mrs morgan
sara ann morgan
the address
225 willow road bethesda
phone number
7984
who rented this box
my husband
curtis d morgan
and his social security number
will you sign here please
may i help you
id like to rent a box
will you have a seat
ill be with you in a minute
you have a key
yes i do
follow me
its a fourpage affidavit
signed under oath
its dated the day before
the last time he called me
he worked at white  blazevich
in the oil and gas
section for 5 years
listen to this
during that time
he worked for a client who
was engaged in a
lawsuit in louisiana
the client was a man
named victor mattiece
who hes never met
lots about the lawsuit
how desperate mattiece
was to win it
just as if you wrote it
a partner named sims wakefield
supervised the case for w  b
morgan worked on a
peripherated case
he took files and documents
that wakefield left for him
not related to the case
when he got back to
his own office he
found a memo on the
bottom of the stack
hed inadvertently taken it
from wakefields desk
a copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit
he copied the memo
and left the memo
under the files on his desk
next stop
washington herald
no stop
get out of the car
there was a car explosion
in a garage near
the riggs bank
the police traced the car
to a leasing agency
it was rented
yesterday by grantham
have you heard from grantham
not since yesterday
i shouldve taken
him off that story
what story
see what you can find
smith keen
meet darby shaw
so mr grantham
what the hell is going on
sweetheart im down here
in the basement
its about two in the morning
this is
an affidavit
concerning a memo
i found on my desk
im going to trust you
to do with it what you will
the memos from velmano
hes a senior partner
it was dated september 28th
addressed to
wakefield and it read
sims advise client
research is complete
the bench will sit much softer
if the old man is retired
the second retirement
is a bit unusual
jensen of all people
advise further that the pelican
should arrive
here in 4 years
assuming other factors
theres no signature
then justices
rosenberg and jensen
were killed
i firmly believe that this is
the work of mattiece
and his associates
memo doesnt mention mattiece
but it refers to a client
wakefield had no other clients
and no client had
as much to gain
from the new court
i thought that i
was protecting us
by not revealing what i found
youll only see this if im gone
so i will have failed
im sorry sweetheart
ill always be with you
always
this is marty velmano
what a pleasure
what can i do for you
were doing a story
about victor mattiece
and his involvement
in the deaths
of rosenberg and jensen
great well sue you
for the next 20
years youll be
named as a defendant
oh this will be great
victor mattiece will
own the herald
have you heard of
the pelican brief
we have a copy of it
we also have a copy of a memo
sent by you to
sims wakefield
in which you suggest
your clients
position would be
greatly improved
by the removal of rosenberg
and jensen from the court
i noticed you waited till five
an hour earlier
we couldve
run to court
stopped this
you deny you wrote the memo
its a fabrication
you have no lawsuit
mr velmano
you know it
you son of a bitch
mr coal
have you read the pelican brief
i have
were running a story
which verifies
the facts set
forth in that brief
weve confirmed mattiece
contributed over 4 million
to the presidents
last campaign
4200000 all through
legal channels
thats right
we believe the
white house tried
to obstruct the
fbi investigation
and we wonder
if there are any comments
the white house denies
any direct or
indirect involvement
in this investigation
youve received some
bad information
mr voyles its grantham
were running a story
detailing a conspiracy
in the murders of
rosenberg and jensen
were naming mattiece an oil
speculator and
two of his lawyers
we believe the fbi
knew about mattiece
but didnt investigate
at the urging of
the white house
any comments
i think well have great
success with these people
they were really very pleased
and genuinely cooperative
whats up
you know gray grantham
and this is darby shaw
so youre the little lady
who started this
great brouhaha
i think you have me confused
with the presidents friend
i have some comments
for the record
first we got the pelican brief
two weeks ago
and submitted it
to the white house
on the same day
it was not considered
high priority in
the investigation
until gavin verheek
special counsel
to the director
was found murdered
did the white house interfere
in the fbi
investigation of mattiece
ill discuss it
off the record
last wednesday the
president asked me
to ignore victor
mattiece as a suspect
in his words
he asked me to back off
i have a tape
which i will allow
no one to hear
unless the president
first denies this
so what do you do now
therell be a grand jury by
noon tomorrow
quick indictments
and well find mattiece
id like a few minutes alone
with ms shaw
if she doesnt mind
its her call
id like mr grantham to stay
whats next for you
who killed the man
disguised as verheek
oh you mean the assassin khamel
off the record
khamel was killed
by a contract operative
hired independently by the cia
rupert
he probably has 20 names
why was he following her
i think the brief initially
scared giminski
more than anyone
and he probably
sent rupert
to trail darby
in part to watch
and in part to protect
we can help
what do you want
to leave the country alone
all right
well get you out of here
put you on my plane
well fly you anywhere you want
and you can disappear
but you must allow
me to contact you
through mr grantham
if and only if
it becomes urgently necessary
thats fine
i want no one on the plane but me
gray and the pilots
after takeoff ill
tell the pilot
where to go
he has to file a flight plan
before he can leave
youre the director of the fbi
set it up
our guest today is
gray grantham
who has as just
about everyone
in america knows
revealed the plot behind the
assassinations of
rosenberg and jensen
the ripple effects
of this story
just dont seem to stop
as of this broadcast
victor mattiece
one of the countrys
richest men
has been indicted
along with
4 aides and lawyers
fletcher coal the
presidents chief
of staff has resigned
and were getting
strong indications
that the president himself
will not run again
thats what we know
lets get to what we dont
we know the pelican
brief was written
by a woman named darby shaw
but we dont know who that is
who is darby shaw
thats a question for darby shaw
next question
speaking for many of
our colleagues
who are in a
feeding frenzy to
interview her
where is darby shaw
thats also a question
for darby shaw
but shes not available
to answer questions
until the feeding frenzy stops
does that mean
you dont know where she is
i didnt say that
then you do know
i take it this
cryptic smile means
youre not answering
in view of all this
you know that
theres speculation
that this woman is a figment
of your imagination
that you created her
from a lot of
different sources
just as there are
people who believe
there was no deep throat
