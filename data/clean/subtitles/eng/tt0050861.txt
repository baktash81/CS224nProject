for the coronation
of their majesties
king george v and queen mary
include the regent
of carpathia
his serene highness
the grand duke charles
he will be accompanied by the present king
his son nicholas viii
and by the queen dowager
they will be in residence
at the carpathian embassy
belgrave square sw
muttering
but do you mean to say
northbrook
that you know nothing
about carpathia whatever
dont even know where the beastly
place is for a start
how long have you been
in the foreign office
15 years sir but im in
the far eastern department
now thats no excuse
what would you think if i said
that i knew nothing about siam
dont think id mind very much
that sort of remark will
get you nowhere northbrook
not even out of this job
certainly not
your predecessor
has had a riding accident
and you are now in his saddle
attached to suite of the grand duke charles
regent of carpathia
and theres an end of it
but i made so many jolly little
plans for the coronation
and i dont speak
a word of carpathian
oh thats all right
fortunately theyre excessively
proud of their english
now look here northbrook
carpathia
a mixed germanslav population
of 11 12 millions
the most efficient railway
service in the balkans
and the fourthlargest
army in europe
so delicately poised is the
balance of power at this moment
that the secession
of this from
this
to
that would certainly
make the aggressor
feel strong enough
to start his war
and i presume that even in
the far eastern department
they have some idea of who that
aggressor would likely to be
kaiser wilhelm
precisely
kaiser bill
they shouldve left
the station by now
youd better get along
to their embassy
yes by jove here they are
there northbrook
there is your future charge
whos the boy
the king for heavens sake
the regents son
dont you know anything
unhappily
the boys progerman
a cousin of the kaiser
on his mothers side
and in 18 months time
when he comes to power
we shall have to
look out for trouble
thats the queen dowager
beside him
the boys grandmother
the regents motherinlaw
quite a formidable old lady
and there is the regent
a character northbrook
definitely a character
by the way grand ducal highness
not serene
and all for formalities
backing out
all that sort of thing
hes very touchy
about those matters
in fact hes a very touchy
proposition altogether
but a very vital one
he must not by one jot nor
one tittle be offended
and you are the instrument
chosen by fate and by me
to see to that happy result
tonight for instance
take him out entertain him
the opera whatever he wishes
the opera i say
i said northbrook
whatever he wishes
yes who is it
miss marina hurry
youll be late
what
all the principals
to meet the royal party
miss springfields lining

privilege be yours

ducal highness

but i know miss springfield well
we are old friends
oh your grand ducal highness
what a charming character
is this uh coconut girl

grand ducal highness say so
it is a character that goes a little
deeper than most in musical comedy
ah yes yes indeed
quite so
i have been so anxious
to find a role
which offered an
an emotional challenge
most charming it is
i began to feel we had
lost the gay person
that i knew in paris
how gracious of you

i look forward to
and this i take it is our hero

grand ducal highness

his grand ducal highness
the grand duke charles
prince regent of carpathia
requests the pleasure of
miss elsie marinas company
at supper this evening
june the 21st 1911
at 12 midnight
at carpathian embassy
46 belgrave square
let me see
is it a joke
the honorable peter northbrook
will present himself at
the avenue theater at 1115
to escort miss marina
to the embassy
youre in dear
oh gosh i dont
have a thing to wear
please ladies please
time is getting short
oh this wont do
i think this ones the best
elsie dear honest
say who else is coming to this
party besides his majesty
his majesty
yes that that
that grand duke
oh my dear youve
quite startled me
look miss marina
i think perhaps before
you meet the regent again
you should learn the
correct form of address
otherwise who knows
there may be a few petites
moments dembarras
oh i just hate that
your host tonight is correctly
addressed as your grand ducal highness
or sir although
as the prince of hungary
which he was before he married
the late queen of carpathia
he is i suppose
correctly entitled
to the formal appellation
of imperial and royal
although at that time
by his own request
serene highness was continued
until he became regent
i dont know what
youre talking about
its most important that you should
miss marina
and i dont even know who you are
much less who he is
i am his grand ducal highness
personal equerry
and in my own right
the deputy head of the far eastern
department of the foreign office
deputy head of the far eastern department
imagine
imagine
i still dont know anything
i mean why uh
royal and imperial
isnt one enough
well it all goes back
to the holy roman empire
the grand duke
is a nephew by marriage
bulging on the hip
of the emperor
franz josef of austria
all right no wisecracks
about austria then
i sincerely hope no wisecracks
about anything miss trehearne
in these troubled times
the lightest remark
can have most terrible
repercussions
i can see
the history books now
the war of elsies remark
say is it all right
over the youknowwhat
wonderful over
the youknowwhat
you can come out now
well
very nice
is that all you can say
very nice indeed
oh miss marina
there is one other small point
in conversation with royalty
only speak when you are
directly addressed
what did he say
wait for the cue before speaking the line
dear
good night mr northbrook
good night
i wont wait up
are you sure he hasnt gotten me
mixed up with maisie springfield
hes a very dear friend of hers
she keeps telling us
im quite sure of that
but why me i just have that
little bit in the second act
perhaps that was just
the little bit he liked
but why me
i wonder why he wants me
hmm tough question that
all right
dont forget
tomorrow morning dear
must leave here sharp at 620
so dont be too late
good night
be good
gosh this is the first time
ive ever seen an embassy
surely not
after all there are 9 embassies
in london at the present time
anyway its the first time
ive ever been
inside of one
gosh
this is really something
isnt it
something
this hallway and everything
yes
personally
i find the decorations a little vulgar
well all i can can say
is give me vulgarity
we neednt have hurried so much
were the first ones arent we
this way miss marina
upstairs whats the idea of
having a supper party upstairs
well its quite
an informal party
but think of all the trouble
of bringing the food
all the way up from the kitchen
i fancy itll be a cold supper
miss marina
well they still
have to carry it up
is his wife going to be here
no miss marina
her late majesty passed over as they say
some 10 years ago
oh
now if you should meet
the queen dowager
oh gosh another one
she is addressed as
your majesty or maam
now the young king
the regents son
oh no
well its extremely unlikely
that you will meet him
but he is
your majesty or sir
im shaking
this is worse than a first night
oh were still the first ones
arent we
gee this is all right
too isnt it
is that the dining room
in there
no
well is it in there
no
there then
no
well where is it
hmm
and incidentally
where is his regency
his grand ducal highness
oh well all right
but where is he
he was called away
to an important meeting
hey
two places
pas devant
what
not in front of them
i know but two places shh
doors close
please miss marina
i beg you control yourself
theres no need for panic
oh isnt there
this is a plot isnt it
supper for two
you knew all the time
well i suppose i have to
confess i did have an idea
when i received the grand dukes
instructions regarding yourself
you know theres a word
for what you are
and its not deputy head of
the far eastern department
miss marina i implore you
not to leap to conclusions
i dont have to do any
leaping to this conclusion
i just walked straight there
and im walking straight out
but why this panic over a harmless
little teteàtete supper
oh i know all about these harmless
little teteàtete suppers
ive had to fight my way
out of quite a few
champagne and i hope
you like caviar
and something cold to follow
because we really dont want
the servants around do we
its so much more fun serving ourselves
dont you think
and then after supper miss marina
you must be very tired
why dont you put your feet
up on this nice sofa
oh no
i know every move
arent you
confusing this embassy
with a private room at romanos
whats the difference
except up there
its a longer run from
the sofa to the door
and theres no evidence
that a duke cant run
just as fast as the next man
oh please please miss marina
pas devant
now dont give me
pas devant stuff
make any excuse you like uh
my aunts ill or something
your aunt miss marina
im awfully sorry
really i am but goodbye
oh please please
please miss marina
you want to get me and
the whole foreign office
in the most terrible trouble
since you asked yes
im sure you dont want
to insult the grand duke
why dont you have a
little supper with him
itll be a very good one
hes the most charming
conversationalist
after supper
all you have to say is
well sir its been a most delightful
evening and i must go home
yes as an exit line thats swell
but can you guarantee the exit
i dont think so this is a balkan
grand duke for heavens sake
educated in england
thats just what i mean
no listen please
miss marina please
look supposing i do guarantee your exit
as you call it
supposing i give you time for supper
and then after supper
i come in with a message
from a hospital
where your aunt has been
taken after an accident
well i dont know
no i dont think so at all
why thank you
how do you do
so good of you to come on such short notice
oh thats all right
your regency
your grand ducal
oh thats all right
your grand ducal
highness
grand ducal highness

embassy for buckingham palace

you see
the company i came over with from the states

maybe but you know
what they say
drunk as a fly
oh but that is
really quite excellent
i can see you have a witty
little tongue miss marina
i have
hurt a fly
drunk as a fly
i must remember that
i really shouldnt bother
your grand ducal
well uh cheerio
cheerio
coughs
what is the matter
that time i burned
my witty little tongue
heh heh heh

i hope you are too
enraptured
ah will you sit here
pop

there now we are to ourselves
good well now
you will forgive me
if i dont join you
for the minute
i have already had dinner
and have one or two matters
of business to attend to
turned quite warm all of a sudden
hasnt it
i wasnt addressed
give me the ambassador
very well then wake him
ach ambassador you were asleep
how sad
i wish to tell you of my interview
with the foreign secretary
it concerned of course
my having ordered the arrest of wolffstein
sir what has disturbed
them at the moment
we have not been able
to think up a charge
which makes it rather awkward
yes it was careless of me
i admit
but i have been
so busy all evening
what yes yes my dear fellow
you can speak freely
theres no one here
uncarpathian activities
heh heh heh
yes that would be most amusing
but what has
chiefly disturbed sir
at what is the fact that these
stupid americans have protested
some nonsense about political
freedom and democratic rights
you know what children
the americans are
in matters of this kind
their diplomacy always makes me
think of the minotaur legend reversed
you know
the bull chasing theseus through
the labyrinth heh heh heh
a steamtraction engine
in hampton court maze
heh heh heh heh
eh eh ha ha ha ha
excellent heh heh heh heh
what oh no the british
of course will be more sensible
theyll wait until after
the trial and then protest
but oh herr gock
when will these
crazy americans grow up
yes we will talk tomorrow
good night
well well well
and how is everything
just dandy
ach i see you have
already served yourself
how remiss of me
oh not at all
i prefer it this way
splendid
well uh cheerio
mud in your eye
chokes
what a priceless expression
wherever did you learn it
in america
oh really
have you been there
i was born there
i am american
are you indeed miss uh
yes your grand ducal
thats just what i am
excuse me i have thought of
another telephone call i must make
oh its quite all right
i just adore my own company
connect me with
the french ambassador
heh yes hell still
be at the reception
well i shall try later
to president taft
i said to president taft
whispering
president taft
so i wasnt addressed
who cares
bull in the labyrinth
who the hecks theseus anyway
protest i should darn well
think they would protest
arresting people that way
disgraceful
ah miss marina
wont you have some champagne
oh i dont know
your grand ducal
you really think i ought
well maybe just a sip
maybe just up to
whoa ha ha ha
i beg your pardon
you said something
oh no just playing a little
game over here all by myself
good uh cheerio
down the hatch
ha ha ha
why was i not informed of
wolffsteins arrest father
why was i left to learn it
from the london
evening standard

no need to inform the king
ah may i present
miss elsie marina
good evening

and just a touch more on the cheeks
too i think
yes maam
and dont make mischief between
me and madame bernhardt now
or i shall be cross
oh a little vague
say doesnt she mind
about you and me
mind
well isnt she
your wifes mother
no my dear
my wife and i were married
because she needed to reinforce
her trade agreement
with hungary
i accepted her because
the emperor told me to
for 10 years we were utterly and
completely devoted to each other
with never an unkind word
on either side
how could there be any question
of anyone minding anything
in such circumstances
ooh i find your life shocking
why
well theres no
love in it
nothing
oh yes
maisie springfields by the dozens
but i mean oh real love
telephone rings
oh excuse me
oh no not again

riots my dear fellow
there is no need to panic
the new chief of police is a good man
and i trust him
heh no
well my dear
well
my dear
wouldnt you be more comfortable on the sofa
you could put your feet
up there and rest
oh no thank you
i think ill stay
right where i am
just as you please
chuckling
my dear it was so good of you
to come and see me here tonight
you said that before
did i
that is a beautiful dress
you said that before too
heh heh heh
what does it matter
what are words
where deeds can
say so much more
laughing thats just terrible
my
what is terrible
that performance of yours
dear i do not altogether
understand you miss marina
ohh now dont pull
grand duke with me
you made a pass
and i turned it down
thats all that happened
we can still be friendly
excuse me
say listen
i could use a short one
i need it for my heart
its kind of beating down here
im so sorry
its all right
its not your fault
in fact if id known this was
all that was going to happen
i wouldnt even
have been nervous
long life to your
grand highness
cheerio
better luck next time
only not with me of course
say listen
there is something to this stuff
are you sure theres no effect
when you drink it that way
after 3 of them
you might experience a certain euphoria
i think you have had enough
i think so too
i dont know why i was
so nervous tonight
i thought i was gonna have a
real struggle with myself
i thought
well of course i would have won it
i always do
but i thought this time
hes a hungarian prince
and a grand ducal
well with fire
and passion and
i thought if
anybody knows about this love stuff
this guy will
ha ha ha ha ha
suppresses a laugh
i even thought
i even thought
that youd have
gypsy violins playing somewhere outside
and that
the lights would be
dimmed low and
thered be strange
seductive perfume everywhere in the air
well put it all together
i thought
mmm sister
you better watch your step
you just better watch out
oh well
do they all fall
as easily as that
those maisie springfields
and all those others
before your insults grow too
great to be borne miss marina
im ringing for your motor
oh no dont do that
i mean
i dont want you to get your car out again
i live way out in brixton
i could just walk
you will go in the motor
ok if you insist
ill just get my wrap
ohh
sorry
pretty good huh
why am i deserted
why is there no one
to answer the bell
major domo
with respect
your grand ducal
highness yourself
gave orders that the attendants
were to be moved from the door
see that a motor is here
and tell the adc on duty
he is to escort miss marina
to a place called brixton
as your grand ducal
highness commands
major domo
why was this room not perfumed
perfumed your grand
ducal highness
and why were the lights
not turned down
to give a romantic
and mysterious effect
with respect your grand ducal
highness gave no such command
himmel
am i to think of everything
have i not enough on my mind
what are you doing
you would lock the stable door
after the horse has bolted
if it is your grand ducal highness
wish that the stable door be locked
i will instantly instruct
the head coachman
dummkopf do you not know
the english idiomatic phrase
that it is foolish to lock the
stable door after the horse has
hey but has it
give that to me
wait
one of my personal
servants plays the violin
which is that
i think it is franz
your grand ducal highness
and does he play it well
i am tone deaf
your grand ducal highness
where is he now
in bed sir
well fetch him out of it
and tell him i may need him
to play his confounded
fiddle outside this door
but dont let him begin
until i ring
wait
humming
oh hasnt the car
gotten here yet
ah the little bird
so anxious to return
to her nest
well this is my exit i guess
please this is not
quite yet goodbye
give me just one minute
to tell you
how deeply distressed i feel at
what has happened between us
listen im the one
who should be sorry
oh please please let me try to
explain a little about something
that is in my mind
at the moment
wont you sit down
just for a second huh
well i dont want to
keep those drivers up
oh that is all right
theyre used to waiting
it is simply this my dear
i have realized that all that you
have said about my life is true
it is quite without love
im im growing
into middle age
oh no
almost into middle age
hey i didnt ask for that
yes here am i having
reached the age of 40
and i have never known what
it is to love or be loved
it is like the legend
of the sleeping princess
only here it is
the prince who sleeps
and awaits the kiss of the
beautiful young maiden
that will bring him
back to life
you mean you want me
to kiss you
you are so literal
it is love that i need
the ennobling love
of a pure young woman
her bright faith in me as i am
and as i might yet be
her glowing selfsacrifice to my
little weaknesses and desires
for love is sacrifice
is it not
rings bell
yes and where is
the mystic kiss
which might bring this
sleeping prince to life
i got you
do you know what
your hair reminds me of
violin playing
summer corn kissed by the wind
into enchantingly
exciting furrow
your eyes
hey
hmm
where is that music coming from
music oh
one of my servants a hungarian
always plays at this hour
hes lamenting his lost love
ohh
poor boy
isnt life awful
go back to my eyes
twin pools of gladness and joy
in which any man would be
happy to drown himself
in both of them
laughing
in either
oh i like that
twin pools
go on
ah your chin
oh you skipped my nose because
you noticed the bump on the end
oh no no no
i left it out because there is
nothing to say of perfection
oh thats nice
back to my chin
this is what i think
of your chin
my darling
oh my darling
violin continues playing
oh that poor hungarian
i do hope he gets his love back
well dont think of his love
think of ours
my darling you know
think of our love and the
beauty of our meeting here
ooh you have pretty hair
ah you think so huh
you like my hair
you use the wrong stuff
on it though
what do you use
a little pomade dear but
thats where youre wrong
you should use um
oh whats the name
of that stuff
whats the name of it
oh i know
uh pinauds lilac
huh ah
so remember what i was
asking you my darling
to remember our love
oh you have pretty eyebrows
love
what a universe of joy and pain
lies in that little word
your grand ducal highness
this is intolerable
my deepest respects sir
my message is so important
i had no choice but to intrude
revolution
no sir
miss marinas aunt has
been in a motor accident
the hospital is calling
for her most urgently
what
oh go away you silly lad
giggling
but miss marina your aunt
do you realize how
serious her condition is
well its her own fault
she has no right out this time of night
shes 93
miss marina
miss marina asked
you to go away
and i command you to go away
i am most horribly displeased
at this breach of etiquette
mr northbrook
and shall no doubt
find opportunity
of expressing my displeasure
in certain quarters
your grand ducal highness go
giggling
my dear
ooh
i got a solemn word
of warning for you
what is that my beloved
you know whats going to happen
im gonna fall in love with you
cause i always always do
always
hmm both times
so you better watch out
you better watch out
oh what pretty cherubs
on the ceiling
good night my darling
good night
see you in the morning
major domo
violin continues playing
stop that infernal din
how do you expect a man
to get any sleep
bell rings
good morning sir
whispering urgently
good gracious
ah good morning
mr northbrook
good morning sir
uh my father has sent for me
you think i should go in
i think sir
perhaps youd better not
i understand from the major domo
that his valets are with him
theyre having a little
trouble with his shaving
promising weather for the coronation
dont you think so sir
pity you cant
go into the abbey
but of course
protocol forbids it
i understand youre watching the procession
from a window in the ritz hotel
you should have
an exceptionally good view
who is accompanying
your majesty
the duke of strelitz
and of course my jailer
your jailer sir
colonel hoffman
charles is that you nicky
yes father
good morning nicky
ive been thinking things over
and it seems to me better
you do not have strelitz
with you this morning
but father
i do not want to be alone with hoffman
i know
strelitz is my cousin
and i have not seen him
since his
since his abdication
yeah i know dear boy you are very
fond of him but i really think
dummkopf am i to go to the coronation
looking like a sliced tomato
knock on door
aye
speaking hungarian
nicky when in england
we speak only english
shouting in hungarian
in any case nicky
i believe you are merely sulking
because of wolffsteins arrest
that issue is far too important
for me as sulking father
will you please tell me
what has happened in my
country since last night
the riots are still continuing
and that they appear
to be well organized
i have had no option but to
order certain further arrests
further arrests
yes i have the list
here i think
yes here it is
no friends of yours there
i hope
i am not allowed to have
politicians for friends father
you know that
thank you so much
mr northbrook
oh i wonder who it is
i have left off this list
there was some name
he was looking for
and relieved to find not there
shh
speaking hungarian
northbrook
sir
do i see what i saw
i fear so sir yes
but why has she not
been got rid of huh
i understand sir
her sleep was unduly heavy
and resistant
to prodding and shaking
she cannot be seen here
at this hour of the morning
she will make a scandal
suppose the queen
is in that room
and she comes out again
looking like that huh
im sure sir
her sense of comme il faut
she has as much sense of comme
il faut as a rhinoceros
do i gather sir
that the evening was not
an entirely happy one
northbrook this british
understatement of yours
i begin to find irritating
the evening was an
unqualified nightmare
oh im so sorry sir
i have only one evening
in london
one single evening
in which to arrange for
myself a little relaxation
and what happens
out of the whole of
this vast teeming city
teeming with beautiful
intelligent women
you find me what
a little american ninnycompoop
with respect sir
either ninny by itself or nincompoop
ninnycompoop will serve
she fully deserves a new word
the mind of a backward child
the muscles of a boxer
and an approach to life
of such stomachturning
sentimentality
that i found myself northbrook
i found myself last night
uttering phrases
which had any single one
of them been overheard
would have made me
the laughingstock of europe
and to crown it all
she is rendered insensible
by an amount of vodka
which in carpathia
you would add to the morning
milk of a 4yearold child
as a mild tonic
and gott how maddening
to think how overjoyed lucy
sunningdale would have been
if i had asked her to have a little
supper with me here last night
id like to remind
your grand ducal highness
i think i heard you remark
that you found lady sunningdale
old hat
i have no doubt at
all that i did
nevertheless
my dear northbrook
there is an old russian saying
better an old hat
than a bare head
and telephone
to lady sunningdale
and ask her to join me
here tonight for supper
but sir the coronation ball
i shall make a token appearance
and leave in good time
say about 1230
but sir tonight
coronation night
she may well have an engagement
she will break it
elsie good morning
thats his room
in there isnt it
yes but miss marina
but ive just got to say
good morning
charles who is that
guess who
oh gott
good morning my dear
oh good morning
how are you
oh you poor darling
youve cut yourself
it is nothing
oh but you still
look lovely to me
whats the matter
uh someone might come in
oh this is times square
i found that out last night
but who cares
but this is the morning
its different you know
whats different about it
unless maybe its you
no i assure you my dear
im exactly the same person
youre not acting
exactly the same way
but this is the morning
you keep saying that
i remember last night
the way you kept repeating yourself
tell me my darling grand duke
is it only very late at night
that youre such
a lonely person
you feel the need to share your
life with a pure young woman
no no please
whose bright face
ennobling love
there are certain phrases
should never be quoted
out of context
i dont know what that means
oh yes i do
it means its the morning
doesnt it
anyway to me its
still dream time
this coronation day 1911
i woke up to find myself
madly in love with you
but madly
so there
my dear im overwhelmed of course
but alas i feel it my duty
oh dont make
another long speech
although some of them last night
made more sense than you know
you know you do need
more love in your life
i never met anyone
who needed it more
so now youve got it
good luck to you
cheerio
is that all youre going to say
oh my dear of course
im overwhelmed
but alas we have
so little time together
i must leave tomorrow
for carpathia

say our little adieus

with a few appropriate words
but now you have driven them
clean out of my head

i dont want to say anything
but ill bet there are
quite a few of these things
being worn around europe these days
huh

disconcerting me

her majesty is ready
and the motor to take
the king to the ritz
he has already left
miss marina

oh gosh
who was that
mr northbrook who was that creature
was it an anarchist
no maam
then who was it
a young lady maam
called miss elsie marina
ah
fetch her to me
miss marina
her majesty wishes
to speak to you
miss marina
good morning my dear
so delightful to see you again
why are you dressed up
as a revolutionary
is this a new game
if it is
you should have let me know
i love games
elsie no maam
its not a game
well take that thing off
it looks most unbecoming
queen dowager
come here my dear
i am going to have a cigarette
so soothing
before a long ordeal
will you join me
no thank you
well please sit down
oh maam is probably wondering
why im still dressed the way
i was last night
you see
i had a stupid accident with my latchkey
what does she say
said she had an accident with her latchkey
maam
and what is a latchkey
well maam its
oh it does not matter
im sure it is
something very dull
such irritating news
mr northbrook this morning
maud wollenzu meisenbraun
my chief ladyinwaiting
claims she cannot leave her bed
so i have no option but to take
the baroness brunnheim to the abbey
it is not of course her fault
but i feel we shall be very
squashed in the carriage
speaking french
excuse me maam
i didnt quite catch that
i dont think miss marina speaks french
maam
doesnt speak french
how ridiculous
she lives with sarah
bernhardt in paris
speaking french
oui
you see
speaking french
oui
bien
speaking french
most intelligent
reading la rochefoucauld
yes indeed maam
i think perhaps id
better warn the regent
that we shall be leaving soon
if your majesty will excuse me
mmm is that that evening dress
you were wearing
oh yes maam you see
i was trying to explain
ohh
lottie my jewelry box
just turn around
my dear will you
and lower yourself
yes that is very possible
i think we need something else
but maam
just turn around again
my dear will you
and lower yourself again
good
oh whats happening
is this a game
did you say something my dear
ask maam if this is a game
she wants to know
is this a game maam
uh lottie my dear
put your cape on her would you
oh whats happening
please tell me
better and better
lottie my dear would you
be very disappointed
ho ho
on the contrary maam
as you know
it is my little trouble
i always have been a little
nervous of long ceremonies
good
that is settled then
lend her your gloves
and arrange her veil on her
oh whats happening
please tell me
i am appointing you my ladyinwaiting
for the day my dear
and taking you to the abbey
oh maam you cant
i mean what if someone
would recognize me
id be arrested
arrest my ladyinwaiting
my dear child
such an absurdity
but where will i sit
and what will i do
you just do what is obvious
and sit where
mr northbrook tells you
you still look rather bare
i know
you need an order
lottie go and fetch the ambassador
will you
my dear
hello
my dear such fun
how you will laugh
we are taking miss marina
to the abbey
oh are we
but i need an order
for her my dear
ah dear ambassador
fetch me that nice mauve order
the one the regent gave
to the foreign secretary
the other day
my dear motherinlaw
what is it you
are wearing lottie
the purple pillow
no the mauve one is
much more fetching
so slim and pretty
we will now be most
comfortable in the carriage
hand it to the regent
you realize i suppose
that this order is only given
for a very special
personal service
to the head of the state
such hairsplitting
no doubt she will
do you one one day
take your cape off
kneel down
i hereby invest you with
the royal carpathian order
of perseverance
secondclass
queen dowager
come my dears
and i hereby return you this
after all
were not parting quite yet
are we my darling grand duke
crowd cheering
band plays
oh its a shame
shes gonna hate us
oh do be quiet
yes fair lily
we cant spoil a lovely day like this
worrying about
that wretched girl
im sure miss america
has missed the boat
nyah nyah nyah
oh shut up
oh cheer up fanny
its her own silly fault
well its a shame
oh well
what could we do
cheering
oh isnt this wonderful
most impressive
and the soldiers
facing the procession too
such a change from the last coronation
i attended the bessarabias
revolver shots going off
like kettle drums
and the sky black
with infernal machines
happily no fatalities
except in the crowd
but it all left
a very bad impression
gasp
this must be his grand duke
who lives now
this is your moment
maisie dear
she wont get over this
its a shame
its her i promise you
its her
its elsie
its elsie
bugle blowing
women screaming
ha ha ha ha
miss springfield
miss springfield
its elsie marina
miss springfield
with the regent
of carpathia mmm
such a thing could not happen
horn blowing
organ plays
fanfare plays
singing hymn
female soloist sings
choir sings
cannon fires
bells peal
say you havent seen an old raincoat around
have you
ok forget it
oh
gosh
another one
hi there
good afternoon miss marina
oh dont look so anxious
i dont tell tales
oh oh that is good of you
im so very grateful
still
that doesnt mean that i dont think
youre a very naughty boy
indeed
to me and many of my countrymen
it is my father who
is the naughty boy
yes but youre only 16
whereas hes
well he says 40
but id make a rough guess at
um
shouldnt you wait
till youre grown up
miss marina
i can see that you are very kind
and a good person
but in matters of this nature
nicolas
i wish to speak with you
no do not go miss marina
this concerns you too
the telephone operator
has reported to hoffman
that youve talked with
the german ambassador this morning
that is true
yes
after miss marina
had obtained you the number
she did not know
what the number was
you passed a message
didnt you
your operator will tell you
she doesnt speak german
i know
i found that out
will you tell me
the message nicky
isnt it nice that it was such
a fine day for the coronation
youll go to your room
colonel hoffman will
visit you there later
and of course
theres no question
of your going
to the ball tonight
i prefer not to keep company
with traitors
miss marina
i say this with sincerity
it has been a real pleasure
what am i to do with such a boy
if you were asking me
that question seriously
oh would i give you an answer
but since youre not
but i am asking you
although herr gott
i know what the
answer is going to be
something about his not having
enough love in his life i suppose
not such a bad guess
speaking german
such sentimental idiocy
why do you always
swear in german
because the germans
have the best oaths
and the best machine guns
yes i suppose
cross thunder weather yet again
wouldnt sound nearly so fierce
would it
oh well
i guess theres
nothing left for me to do
but to take off all of my finery
and slip quietly
out of your life forever
what
i said i guess
theres nothing left
no no no
before that
you translated
do you speak german
sure
then you heard his message
oh yes but im not going
to tell you what it was
so dont excite yourself
too much
ooh dont you look cute
when youre fierce
miss marina
you are in possession of some very
dangerous information and i must
now dont put the screws on me
darling
oh my dear dear child
if only you could
oh you cant wheedle me either
shouting in german
well done
thats the best yet
giggling
my darling dont swear anymore
youre gonna run out of oaths
im not going to tell you
and thats that
but i will tell you i think
the treatment of your son just now
was plain bad policy
good policy i suppose
would be to kiss the little schweinhund
on both cheeks
and say let bygones be bygones
dear child come to the ball
the words right out of my mouth
now who is nicky more likely
to tell his plot to
that nasty old colonel hoffman
giving him the
dickens in his room
or his dream prince
of a beautiful father
taking him to the ball
do not call me by these names
it is grotesque
oh darling
i may call you by
other names one day
but for now
youll have to forgive
the language of love
im ready for my goodbye kiss
is that all i get
the way im feeling
at the moment
it is considered a bit too much
tell the king
to come and see me
hey what about
my parting present
no pin it on please
now
say to me what you said
to me this morning
if i do you will
only laugh at me again
and say my epaulets are
scratching you or something
and i shall be
disconcerted again
take the risk
it has been wonderful
knowing you
if only it could
have lasted longer
thank you my darling
his majesty
nicky
sit down nicky
this german embassy affair
has made me most unhappy
i have always known
that you and i
did not see eyetoeye
on policy
but that my own son
should conspire against me
has been a most bitter shock
ah nicky nicky
i wonder if you realize
how easy it is to break
a fathers heart
if you mean your heart
father i dont
perhaps that is because i dont
wear my heart on my sleeve nicky
some people prefer to keep their
feelings bottled up you know
and i maybe i am at fault
plucks strings
anyway nicky i dont want to say
any more about it
i have decided to let bygones
be bygones
and after all
in spite of everything
you may come to the ball
thank you father
but i dont think i want to
i think i would
rather go to bed
oh but sir
you must go to the ball
its going to be
the most beautiful ball ever
fabulous uniforms
beautiful decorations
no i wouldve
liked to have gone
but grandmother says shes not going
because shes tired
and i wont know anyone
and i wont have anyone
to dance with
invite someone to dance with
invite someone
yes of course
i can easily arrange these
things
you mean anyone
yes anyone
miss marina
will you accompany me
to the coronation ball tonight
oh i shall be very happy to obey
your majestys command
that is good
then i shall come in person
to collect you at
your theater at 1100
oh that would be nice
say uh do you think your
grandmother would mind if
no she wont mind
ill bring them for you
shell just say such fun
and ill borrow one of her tiaras
for you too
well if they can see me leave
the theater in a tiara
they can darn well see me arrive
in an evening gown
i think i shall find
you another order
the one you are wearing
is not firstclass
oh no
well mind i wasnt going to say anything
but um if you really think
see you at the ball
orchestra playing
lively dance music
dear lucy
you dont know
how many engagements
ive broken for
your sake tonight
some that i wouldnt have broken
for any other man in the world
so kind
you will come then
to the embassy at about 1230
i have arranged a little supper
at your command
i would come to the end of the earth
belgrave square is
fortunately not so far
ah and here is
your escort my dear
if your grand ducal
highness will permit
not at all
i envy you old boy
well
im afraid i cant find them
northbrook
you should not let them
out of your sight for a moment
with such a girl like that
anything can happen
anything
you search that way
i will search this way
for the settled
peace of the kingdom
signed nicolas viii
uh just nicolas
ok nicky
well
it seems reasonable enough to me
if only your father
were a reasonable man
excuse me please
oh pardon me
really
anyway
i promise to do everything i can
anyway its gonna be wonderful
to have a dance with him
ahem
oh
hello there
weve been looking all over for you
indeed and i have been
looking for you
well can you beat that
father i feel sure
that you should like
to have a dance
with miss marina
i should be charmed
playing intro to waltz
ah northbrook
would you care for
a little refreshment
thank you so much
what a sweet boy he is
my son
far too grown up
i guess thats just due to uh
due to his upbringing
say wouldnt it be a good thing
if you and him made it up
i mean for your country and for
european peace and all that
these things are not
done so easily
oh i dont know
with a little give and take
it wouldnt be so hard
as a matter of fact
i just happen to know what
his conditions would be
conditions
yes he wants a motorcycle
and he wants to be allowed to
ride it anywhere in carpathia
well it seems
reasonable enough to me
lets see what else
did he want
oh yes i remember
he wants a general election
speaking german
i knew you would say that
still i dont know
why you object
general elections are a good thing
theyre democratic
you are very pretty my dear
but you will be wise
to think twice
before entering
the political arena
you may find the role
of madame de pompadour
is a little beyond your range
and your range is

little services to us
and i wish you much

well goodbye
goodbye
good night nicky
northbrook i will take
my carriage in 10 minutes
they went for a ride on a bus
a public bus
on number 57
this may mean
a scandal northbrook
yes sir
and you followed this bus in the
carriage as far as victoria station
yes sir
i then followed them on foot
as they walked from
there to the embassy
they walked you mean
shes here in the building
yes sir she is with the king
in the stewards room
what are they doing
in the stewards room
she is teaching the king
an american dance
called a fox trot
your valet franz
is playing for them
with one or two others of the household
in ragtime
speaking german
exactly sir
lady sunningdale is late
only a few minutes sir
her unpunctuality used to be
one of her most irritating
characteristics
i had hoped she might have grown
out of it by now
she has had
the after all time
hello
hello
oh supper
how lovely
how thoughtful of you darling
ill just run down and
say good night to nicky
ill be right back
in just a minute
come come sir
all that is needed is
a little firmness
you should say straight out
that the supper is not for her
and that you are
expecting another guest
that is your
considered suggestion
for surmounting this
crisis northbrook
yes sir it is
then i can only say that
i now fully understand
why the foreign office
always makes such a mess
of its relations
with the state department
northbrook we are not here dealing
with a civilized adult
but with an unruly child
do you think i am anxious
to have supper for 3
im sorry sir
i had not i agree
considered that aspect
the best policy then
would appear for me to
intercept lady sunningdale
on arrival
and escort her to the little
music roomdownstairs
there i can arrange to
have another table made
2 suppers i am to eat
im afraid i see no alternative
but how am i to leave this one
that is the crux northbrook
a few minutes after
lady sunningdale arrives
i shall come up here
and announce
that the ambassador
urgently requires your presence
in the chancellery
and that your business
will last for at least an hour
you will then say goodbye
to miss marina
for positively the last time
oh i shall be here sir
no harm will come to you
and leave miss marina for me
to escort back to brixton
at least an hour is hopeless
you had better say all night
only so will your plan
have the faintest
chance of success
well here i am
you may leave us northbrook
very well sir
say he doesnt do that half
as bad as me does he
vodka
thank you
oh thats too much
oh you can take that surely
oh
too fast i wanted to make you a toast
well here youll have to
have some more
no not so much please
you dont want to spoil
my illusions of you do you
what are your illusions of me
well your capacity for vodkas
certainly one of them
heres to more love
in everybodys life
cheers
well i have
a little document here
shall i read it
manifesto to
my faithful subjects
i nicolas viii king
do hereby renounce and reject
thoroughly the overtures
lately made to me
by a certain person
that i assume the powers of government
before the appointed time
and i do hereby solemnly adjure
all citizens of the realm
to unite loyally
and wholeheartedly
under the regency of my father
the grand duke charles
for the settled peace
of the kingdom
signed nicolas
but it isnt signed
nicolas at all
of course not darling
you know you have those little
conditions to agree to first
give and take darling
give and take
ah thats right
thatll help you see it
in the best possible light
do you not see
you pretty little dummkopf
that a general election will
put the kaisers party in power
and there will be a war
in europe in 6 months
well
i dont see how you can be so sure
i mean well what
if your party wins
thats a funny thing
about general elections
you never know
whos going to win
the overtures lately made to
me by a certain person
of course you do not realize
what it is you are
making the boy sign
yes darling
a manifesto
a confession
an abject confession by my son
that the kaisers party
were plotting with him
to overthrow the constitution
and destroy me
ausgezeichnet
another vodka
ah no thank you
ive had enough
a little one
ah hmm
something to eat
uh no thank you
im not hungry
of course the timing of events
will have to be most
carefully considered
i hold the initiative now
i must not lose it
well i dont see
with your fine brain
and your wonderful grasp
of the situation
how you could ever lose
anything so little
as an initiative
wouldnt you be more comfortable
with your feet up
no thank you
vodka
no thank you
mein gott i have it
what
i will give this manifesto
to the press of
the entire world
that will proclaim
wolffsteins guilt
and explain why ive
had to put him in jail
also it will answer those
stupid american protests
i mean it will satisfy
democratic opinion
well thats wonderful
but here lies the
real key of the plan
i will be most magnanimous
having established the guilt of
wolffstein to the entire world
i will then release him
so will i make him look
the perfect bloody fool
and i will look to my country
and the rest of the world
as the true
freedomloving democrat
and so will i win my election
by a landslide
brilliant brilliant
quite quite brilliant
rings bell
oh i can see
they dont call you
the fox of the balkans
for nothing do they
am i called so
didnt you know it
the fox of the balkans
chuckles
violin plays
oh
you look so like a fox with those eyebrows
look like a fox
yes like a sleek
dangerous animal
but such a lonely one
oh my child it is
my lot to be lonely
but must it always be so
it must it must
darling if you
could only under
violin playing
wheres that music coming from
oh never mind darling
its just that hungarian
i expect
you told me he
played every night
the the oh yes every ni
mmm never mind my darling
i found a dream
laying in your arms
the whole night through
im yours
no matter what
others may say or do
light of heart
and fancy free
thats the way to start
there will be
nothing to lose
till you lose your heart
oh my child if only you knew
how i long for
that kind of freedom
oh my sweet
go on with what you were saying
what does it matter
what are words
what are words where deeds
can say so much more
oh not that again darling
cant you think
of something else to say
speaking hungarian
i didnt quite catch that
i love you
i love you
oh gosh
your grand ducal highness
how i love you
shouting in german
how dare you
your grand ducal highness
the ambassador has arrived
if you know what i mean
please do not argue
leave the room at once
think yourself lucky
im not telephoning the
foreign secretary immediately
morgen herr northbrook
guten morgen
speaking german quietly
speaking german
lady sunningdale
speaking german
mr northbrook
oh good morning sir
is my father quite well
this morning
ive heard nothing to
the contrary sir why
he has just
embraced me
well sir hes surely
done that often before
in public of course
but this was in private
mr northbrook
in his bedroom with only
his valets to see it
and he called me
his darling boy
how nice
it is most suspicious
he was asking too
the most extraordinary
not to say embarrassing
questions
was i not sometimes very lonely
had he not always been
a good father to me
did i not sometimes feel
the lack of love in my life
mr northbrook
my father asked me
if i did not feel the
lack of love in my life
yes sir i heard
youre not surprised
you have heard something
already perhaps
is there cause for concern
let me tell you mr northbrook
i strongly suspect
some foreign office
hocus pocus in all this
the foreign office sir
never resorts to hocus pocus
you are doubtless thinking
of the wilhelmstrasse
come in
good morning northbrook
punctual as usual
i see splendid
herr gott how handsome you look
in that uniform of yours
and yesterday too
i meant to say something about it
but somehow it slipped my mind
and nicky my darling boy
yes father
nothing just my darling aah
careful franz
you had better get ready
we leave in 5 minutes
yes father
give me a kiss nicky
another kiss
why not heh
one can overdo such things
oh nonsense
fathers should kiss their sons
when they are children
but not when
nicky come and
give me a kiss this instant
chuckles
well northbrook
chuckles
well well well
well well indeed sir
wonderful morning is it not
wonderful sir
i have a letter here
for your grand ducal highness
of a somewhat private nature
oh
oh dear
oh dear dear
tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk
you know northbrook
what i think is the trouble
with lady sunningdale
she has not enough love
in her life sir
too much one should keep
her balance in these things
now northbrook i have
one or two commissions
for you to perform
after we leave
i shall be honored
first a special passport
must be obtained
for a journey to
carpathia next thursday
made out in the name of
miss elsa stolzenburg
miss who sir
citizeness of the united states
profession actress
stage name miss elsie marina
oh sir i was
beginning to wonder
second for the journey itself
a special coach must be attached
to the orient express
and a french chef must board
the train at ostend
flowers boughs of flowers
in the salons and bedrooms of course
you will attend to these
petty details yourself will you not
gladly sir
now for the journey
she may require a few dresses
furs personal ornaments
you will see to it
that in that respect
she is given carte blanche
carte quite blanche sir
as blanche as she
cares to make it
gott es willen
that was myself speaking
it was sir
i suppose it cannot be oh
dispose of this please
my father is still dressing
just finishing sir
oh thank goodness
you will be seeing miss
marina some time you think
it appears quite possible sir
when you see her
say goodbye to her for me
and give her this
small parting gift
most certainly sir
also this photograph
tell her i enjoyed
myself last night
more than ive ever
before in my life
and thank her most gratefully
i will sir
yes
mr northbrook
sir
has he kissed you too
not yet sir
i should not be too confident
mr northbrook
playing with fire
what oh good morning
miss marina
good morning
yes i am
thats a sport you
should leave to me
it was a lovely sunrise
this morning wasnt it
i doubt if i paid it
quite the same attention
as you obviously have
i do hope you
havent taken cold
were you out there long
almost all night
i didnt want to
go back to brixton
i wanted to see them off
you werent thinking of going to the station
miss marina
no
i see
i have to present these to you
with the kings compliments
and his thanks for last night
which he claims was the
pleasantest evening
he has ever spent in his life
oh how sweet
he signed it too

the royal carpathian arms
well wouldnt you know it
as i am plainly de trop
i shall await your grand ducal
highness in the hall
i wont say goodbye
miss marina
i understand we shall be seeing
a lot of each other
during the next few days
what with special passports
and other things
special passports
northbrook that was intended
to be a surprise
im so sorry
your grand ducal highness
i wouldnt have spoilt it
for the world
door closes
good morning

chuckles
my dear
i have been making such
a spectacle of myself today
behaving like a schoolboy
and what is so surprising
loving it you know
oh dear
this morning its up to me
to be the grownup one
isnt it
oh grown up eh
its hard for you to remember
i suppose sometimes
youre really quite
an important man arent you
oh
i rule a small country
which is not my own
for which i have some loyalty
but no feeling
i rule it as well as i can
no better and no worse than
any other man in my place
is that so important
they say it is
they why are they
people
last night one man said
you know you wouldnt
think it to look at him
but there goes the best political
brain in europe
would not think it
to look at
but my darling
in 18 months time
i shall surrender
my power to nicky
i shall then be a free citizen
in 18 months time im free
of my contract with george edwards
so there we are arent we
my dear child
you do not realize
what can happen in this world
in 18 months
yes i think i do
i really think i do
this is goodbye then
au revoir
au revoir of course
could i have my parting present now
please
but it is real you know
of course it is my darling

terribly disconcerted
yes
i do
childishness
isnt all fun is it
no
door opens
good morning miss marina
how good of you
to be here so early
is it not charles
yes yes indeed
my dear such a night
not a wink of sleep
some dreadful drunkard fiddling in
the corridor for hours and hours
and the night before too
only not so long
i did not dare
go out and stop him
in case it was an anarchist
or a republican or something
one never knows nowadays
so disturbing
my dear why do you
always wear white
i suppose because
i think it suits me maam
yes but not
all the time my dear
you are imitating the divine
sarah bernhardt no doubt
but even she i am told
changes her dress occasionally
mmm
maud
yes maam i have it here
here is a little brooch for you
with the carpathian arms on it
thank you maam
how kind of you
and here is a photograph for you
too
let me see now
yes i have signed it
thank you maam
you may kiss me my dear
hmm
mr northbrook
you will come to the station with us
of course maam
the king has already left for the station
with the ambassador
and there is a motor to take
miss marina where she wishes
of course sir
yes i do think just a little
variety in the costume my dear
nothing exaggerated of course
simply from time to time
an ordinary little day dress
such fun it has been
goodbye
goodbye maam
