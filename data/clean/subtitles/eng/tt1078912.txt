any time youre done mr daley
call me
thank you for that
so youre quite the smooth operator
arent you mr daley
quick
that actually worked
whats next
look nothing personal but im kind of
in the middle of something here
thats not really your fight
its because im a woman isnt it
no its because ive got this ancient
raisedfromthedead evil pharaoh guy
whos willing to kill me and probably
anyone near me to get this tablet
so he can rule the world
so it is because im a woman
look i
no you look mr daley
if it werent for me youd still be
lost in that monochromatic mayhem
lost in what
black and white photo you boob
now listen and listen good
i can help you
i want to help you and not because
i like you which so far i dont
but because i smell adventure
and damn it i want in
okay dont blame me
if something happens to you
i should be so lucky
i am kahmunrah i am half god
once removed on my mothers side
rightful ruler of egypt
future ruler of
well everything else
now i have lost some men
so i am in need of some new generals
to join me in my little plan
of conquering this world
ivan the terrible
napoleon bonaparte
and young al capone
yeah
some of the most despicable
most feared leaders in all of history
gentlemen
really its just fantastic
to meet you all
and us too
and me you
all i ask is your allegiance
and in return i offer you the world
literally are there any questions
yeah i got one
how come youre wearing a dress
this is not a dress this is a tunic
it was the height of fashion
3000 years ago i assure you
are there any other questions
da this dress youre wearing
do we have to wear one of these too
were you not listening
i just told mr capone here
that this is not a dress
it is in fact a tunic
very big difference
are there any other questions
any questions not about the dress
tunic
all right then moonlight is wasting
and the time is short
short
why do you look at me
when you say short
sorry it slipped out
da if we are talking
about world domination
then of course i am interested
but first i want to clarify something
so you know what you are getting
people always say
ivan the terrible hes so terrible
im so scared of ivan hes bad news
when in fact
the correct translation is
ivan the awesome
ivan the awesome
its not really as catchy is it
i mean ivan the terrible
that really pops
but i wasnt terrible in fact
i was quite an effective leader
duly noted now id like to wrap up
the old meetandgreet
by asking you gentlemen a question
are you with me
yeah yeah sure
oui
da but
then bring larry daley of daley devices
and the golden tablet of ahkmenrah
to me
well get you back down
to your chums mr daley
you wont get lost
following amelia earhart
quick get down
well well mr daley
i quite like the way youre holding me
no sorry i wasnt trying to
oh please
stop beating your gums mr daley
you havent been able
to take your cheaters off my chassis
since the moment we met
i literally didnt understand
one word of that
is it just me
or is there music in the air
my baby we can make it shine
we can take forever
you little flying angel things quiet
theyre cupids mr daley gods of love
great gods of love would you shut up
please shut up were trying to hide
yeah more than a woman yeah

its not about the arrangement quiet
kick the chorus yall
more than a woman
yo show me what you got
night guard
all right come on lets go
more than a woman to me
more than a woman
shes more than a woman
and so the little tiny man who
could not be a smaller or shorter mouse
runs into the claws of the giant cat
youre really hung up
on the height arent you
no its not about height see
yes you are
youre saying im a little mouse
youre a giant cat
i am the giant cat
no offense i just
youre napoleon
theres a complex named after you
youre famous for being little
and its true look
oh you naive american manboy
look neither of us are gonna
be jamming anytime soon right
so its not like we should
its not even an issue
its not about height or something else
its a plan its a brilliant plan

i shall take that from you
thank you
finally finally after 3000 years
my evil army of the damned
my beautiful beautiful army
shall be unleashed
im afraid that mother
and father may have
slightly changed the combination on me
i guess this whole
unleashingtheunderworld thing
isnt really working out for you huh
it must be really frustrating
cause youve waited thousands of years
to come back from the dead
and everything
and now you cant get it open
fear not for i shall wait
a thousand more if i must
good cause in a few hours youll be
standing here in a frustrated position
frozen and ill walk out of here
with my buddies and thatll be that
so i got all night
really all night well
he doesnt
open that cage
what are you doing
no touching no touching
dont you manhandle me
look hes having a little tantrum
jed
dont you squirm dont squirm
itll only be worse for you
put him down
dont be afraid
i shant hurt you
i lied
i dont think he has all night
at all mr daley
from the looks of things
id say he has a little over an hour
take me out of here
you were the guardian
you know all about this tablet
youre obviously much more clever
than the rest of us
you may or may not
know the combination
but i am going to give you
exactly one hour to figure it out
if you do not
i shall kill your friends
and please dont think about escaping
for i shall be watching you
look i dont even know how to begin
to decipher this thing
all right really
what a pity
and your little cowboy friend seemed
like such a charming little fellow
ah well ticktock mr daley
your hour has begun
hey you got this partner
i know you do
you got this
there you are are you all right
ive been worried sick sick i tell you
no im fine
so whats our next move partner
i dont know i just got to get
this tablet translated
oh great this guy again

we dont want any trouble all right
look at that
i guess our sassy cephalopod was just a
fish who didnt like being out of water
hes not such a ballywagger after all
okay glad youre happy
hello a little assistance
hey teddy perfect
yes
maybe you could help us
id love to help you
but first things first
my nose is so itchy
its driving me insane
i hate to ask but as you see
im missing a few body parts
could you please give us a scratch
yeah sure
oh yes thats exquisite
a little over there
yes
more
oh yes yes oh thats
sweet rutabaga pie that was divine
theodore roosevelt at your service
twentysixth president
of the united states rough rider
founder of the national parks
and a whole bunch of other stuff
have we met
no theres another teddy
we have one of you in new york
really whats he like this other me
hes pretty much the same
except with
except what say it
except with a body
yes he has a body
oh dash it the pain
and a horse
excuse me
we really need someone to translate
whats written on this tablet
do you read hieroglyphics
yes i do missy
thats a simple one
bird man with spear
sideways fish beetle vase
okay and what does that mean
it means and this is
just a rough translation
a man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase
and there was also a beetle
i dont think thats it
thats just one possible translation
another possible translation is
you will find the combination you seek
if you figure out the secret
at the heart of pharaohs tomb
okay and what does that mean
i dont know what am i the sphinx
whats this whats that
why dont you ask new york teddy
im sure hed love to get his grabby
little fingers all over that thing
probably let his horse lick it too
mr daley we should be going
to the sculpture gallery
i think theres someone there
who might have a better thought on this
