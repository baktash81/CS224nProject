can possibly imagine 
bringing things back to life

with it  i shall unlock
the gate to the underworld
and bring forth my army
from the land of the dead 
so  if it s not too much trouble   
   hand it over 
okay  here you go

you know what  by the way 
your brother didn t want
to mess with it  either 
yeah  he wanted to play it safe  too 
just  you sort of struck me
as a next level sort of guy  so i was

situation right now

anywhere near me

that we are about to attack 
what 
yeah  i guess so 
you re quite the popular fellow 
mr  daley

my friends are being held down there 
i got to go get them

i spent two weeks spear hunting
with a tribe in micronesia 
the micronesians had
much slower reflexes

well  this is one humdinger
of a hootenanny 
excuse me  sorry  excuse me 
wow  four bars in 1945 
  hello 
  dad  finally 
i ve been studying
these plans to the archives 
looks like once
you get down the stairwell

  so you found everyone 
  sort of 
what is that flibberty widget
you are talking to 
  who s that 
  it s amelia earhart 
you found amelia earhart 
i    hey 
  wait a minute 
  buddy  what s your hurry 
  didn t you hear  the war s over 
  sorry  these guys are chasing me 
what  what am i looking at  mardi gras 
  what unit are you from 
  i m from brooklyn

what the heck is this thing 
excuse me  mind if i get in here 
any time you re done  mr  daley 
  call me 
  thank you for that 
so you re quite the smooth operator 
aren t you  mr  daley 
quick 
  that actually worked 
  what s next 
look  nothing personal  but i m kind of
in the middle of something here
that s not really your fight 
it s because i m a woman  isn t it 
no  it s because i ve got this ancient
raised from the dead evil pharaoh guy
who s willing to kill me and probably
anyone near me to get this tablet
so he can rule the world 
so it is because i m a woman 
  look  i   
  no  you look  mr  daley 
if it weren t for me  you d still be
lost in that monochromatic mayhem 
  lost in what 
  black and white photo  you boob 
now listen  and listen good 
i can help you 
i want to help you  and not because
i like you  which so far i don t 
but because i smell adventure 
and  damn it  i want in 
okay  don t blame me
if something happens to you 
i should be so lucky 
i am kahmunrah  i am half god 
once removed on my mother s side 
rightful ruler of egypt 
future ruler of   
well  everything else 
now  i have lost some men 
so  i am in need of some new generals
to join me in my little plan
of conquering this world 
ivan the terrible 
napoleon bonaparte 
and young al capone 
yeah 
some of the most despicable 
most feared leaders in all of history 
gentlemen 
really  it s just fantastic
to meet you all 
  and us  too 
  and me  you 
all i ask is your allegiance 
and in return  i offer you the world 
literally  are there any questions 
yeah  i got one 
how come you re wearing a dress 
this is not a dress  this is a tunic 
it was the height of fashion
3 000 years ago  i assure you 
are there any other questions 
da  this dress you re wearing 
do we have to wear one of these  too 
were you not listening 
i just told mr  capone here
that this is not a dress 
it is  in fact  a tunic 
very big difference 
are there any other questions 
any questions not about the dress 
tunic 
all right  then  moonlight is wasting 
  and the time is short 
  short 
why do you look at me
when you say  short  
sorry  it slipped out 
da  if we are talking
about world domination 
then of course  i am interested 
but first i want to clarify something
so you know what you are getting 
people always say 
 ivan the terrible  he s so terrible 
 i m so scared of ivan  he s bad news   
when in fact 
the correct translation is
 ivan the awesome  
ivan the awesome 
it s not really as catchy  is it 
i mean   ivan the terrible  
that really pops 
but i wasn t terrible  in fact 
i was quite an effective leader 
duly noted  now  i d like to wrap up
the old meet and greet
by asking you gentlemen a question 
are you with me 
  yeah  yeah  sure 
  oui 
  da  but   
  then bring larry daley of daley devices
and the golden tablet of ahkmenrah
to me 
we ll get you back down
to your chums  mr  daley 
you won t get lost
following amelia earhart 
quick  get down 
well  well  mr  daley 
i quite like the way you re holding me 
no  sorry  i wasn t trying to   
oh  please 
stop beating your gums  mr  daley 
you haven t been able
to take your cheaters off my chassis
since the moment we met 
i literally didn t understand
one word of that 
is it just me
or is there music in the air 
   my baby  we can make it shine
we can take forever   
you  little flying angel things  quiet 
they re cupids  mr  daley  gods of love 
great  gods of love  would you shut up 
please shut up  we re trying to hide 
yeah  more than a woman  yeah 
no  don t change the arrangement 
it s not about the arrangement  quiet 
kick the chorus  y all 
more than a woman
yo  show me what you got 
night guard 
all right  come on  let s go 
more than a woman to me
more than a woman
she s more than a woman
and so  the little tiny man who
could not be a smaller or shorter mouse
runs into the claws of the giant cat 
you re really hung up
on the height  aren t you 
  no  it s not about height  see   
  yes  you are 
you re saying i m a little mouse 
you re a giant cat 
  i am the giant cat 
  no offense  i just   
you re napoleon 
there s a complex named after you 
you re famous for being little 
and it s true  look 
oh  you naive american man boy 
look  neither of us are gonna
be jamming anytime soon  right 
so it s not like we should   
it s not even an issue 
it s not about height or something else

this rodeo clown wouldn t know
a flapjack from a flyswatter 
now  gigantor s out there
risking his hide for us 
the least we can do
is give him some help 
some big help  but we can t very well do
that if we re stuck in here  now  can we 
we need to escape 
what s a flapjack 
it s like a biscuit or a scone 
  chest bump

ruby slippers indeed 
but  whoever you are  archie bunker 
you had one comfortable throne 
hey  boss

through a rust hole in the crate 
one of his little friends got away 
oh  please 
what damage could they possibly do 
why  they re no bigger than
a little grain of couscous  aren t you 
you know  two words come to mind
when i hear you talk 
 delusional  and  weirdo  
and if i had to say a third   goofy

now you let old jedediah out of here
or he s gonna get angry 
well played  jedediah 
i m sorry  i can t take you seriously 
you re just adorable 
even when you re threatening me 
it s hilarious 
is it just me 
or are these guys unbelievably cute 
now hold it a second  now 
now  you have a right to keep me
as your captive  torture me  even 
but don t call me cute  i ain t cute 
steady  my friend 
just stay alive  i will find you 
gigantor  no 
hello  mr  daley  nice to see you again 
now  if you don t mind 
i shall take that from you 
thank you 
finally  finally  after 3 000 years 
my evil army of the damned 
my beautiful  beautiful army 
shall be unleashed 
i m afraid that mother
and father may have
slightly changed the combination on me 
i guess this whole
unleashing the underworld thing
isn t really working out for you  huh 
it must be really frustrating 
 cause you ve waited thousands of years
to come back from the dead
and everything 
and now you can t get it open 
fear not  for i shall wait
a thousand more if i must 
good   cause in a few hours you ll be
standing here in a frustrated position 
frozen  and i ll walk out of here
with my buddies and that ll be that 
so  i got all night 
really  all night  well 
he doesn t 
open that cage 
  what are you doing 
  no touching  no touching 
don t you manhandle me 
  look  he s having a little tantrum 
  jed 
don t you squirm  don t squirm 
it ll only be worse for you 
  put him down 
  don t be afraid 
i shan t hurt you 
i lied 
i don t think he has all night
at all  mr  daley 
from the looks of things 
i d say he has a little over an hour 
take me out of here 
you were the guardian 
you know all about this tablet 
you re obviously much more clever
than the rest of us 
you may or may not
know the combination 
but i am going to give you
exactly one hour to figure it out 
if you do not 
i shall kill your friends 
and please don t think about escaping 
for i shall be watching you 
look  i don t even know how to begin
to decipher this thing 
all right  really 
what a pity 
and your little cowboy friend seemed
like such a charming little fellow 
ah  well  tick tock  mr  daley 
your hour has begun 
hey  you got this  partner 
i know you do 
you got this 
there you are  are you all right 
i ve been worried sick  sick i tell you 
  no  i m fine 
  so what s our next move  partner 
i don t know  i just got to get
this tablet translated 
oh  great  this guy again 
look  buddy 
we don t want any trouble  all right 
look at that 
i guess our sassy cephalopod was just a
fish who didn t like being out of water 
he s not such a ballywagger after all 
okay  glad you re happy 
hello  a little assistance 
  hey  teddy  perfect 
  yes 
maybe you could help us 
i d love to help you 
but first things first 
my nose is so itchy 
it s driving me insane 
i hate to ask  but  as you see 
i m missing a few body parts 
  could you please give us a scratch 
  yeah  sure 
oh  yes  that s exquisite 
a little over there   
  yes 
  more 
oh  yes  yes  oh  that s   
sweet rutabaga pie  that was divine 
theodore roosevelt  at your service 
twenty sixth president
of the united states  rough rider 
founder of the national parks 
and a whole bunch of other stuff 
  have we met 
  no  there s another teddy 
  we have one of you in new york 
  really  what s he like  this other me 
he s pretty much the same 
except with   
except what  say it 
except with a body 
  yes  he has a body 
  oh  dash it  the pain 
  and a horse 
  excuse me 
we really need someone to translate
what s written on this tablet 
  do you read hieroglyphics 
  yes  i do  missy 
that s a simple one 
bird  man with spear 
sideways fish  beetle  vase 
okay  and what does that mean 
it means  and this is
just a rough translation 
 a man with a spear trapped a bird
and a sideways fish in a vase 
 and there was also a beetle   
  i don t think that s it 
  that s just one possible translation 
another possible translation is 
 you will find the combination you seek
 if you figure out the secret
at the heart of pharaoh s tomb   
  okay  and what does that mean 
  i don t know  what am i  the sphinx 
 what s this  what s that  
why don t you ask new york teddy 
i m sure he d love to get his grabby
little fingers all over that thing 
probably let his horse lick it  too 
mr  daley  we should be going
to the sculpture gallery 
i think there s someone there
who might have a better thought on this 
the fellow we re looking for
is just down here 
  bonsoir 
  hello  young lady 
hey  excuse me 
could we keep moving  please 
we certainly could  but then
we might miss a rare opportunity 
i mean  she is a degas  mr  daley 
okay  it s just i got a little buddy
stuck in an hourglass 
i got a pitch meeting
at wal mart in the morning   
  it would be great if we could   
  he s right here 
i think he ll have a thought on this 
mr  thinker  we re sorry
to interrupt your contemplation 
but we really need
to figure out the secret
at the heart of pharaoh s tomb 
i m thinking  i m thinking 
i m thinking 
  i m thinking 
  it s not happening with him 
oh  wow 
you ve gotta be kidding me 
check that out 
  oh  yeah 
  hey  hey 
buddy  over here  this is serious 
apparently  it s a matter
of life and death 
i ll tell you
what s a matter of life and death 
that beautiful lady over there 
hey  baby  check out the gun show
going on over here 
firepower 
he s certainly no einstein 
  biceps  deltoids   
  yeah 
  wait a minute  i saw a bunch of those 
  a bunch of whats 
  little einsteins 
  where 
over there  in air and space 
i gotta get over there 
what 
  nothing 
  okay  then why are you staring at me 
i don t wanna miss a moment 
all right  good  but we should
get going   cause we   
  why 
  you talk too much  ace 
i don t know why i did that  mr  daley 
i just feel as if i ve been asleep
for a long time and now  suddenly 
i m awake 
i can explain that   
but really  i could  i really   
again  why 
great  you re back 
okay  yeah  great 
love theme from titanic 
good  but not really appropriate 
you don t let yourself enjoy things
much  do you  mr  daley 
okay  you know what 
it s not really the song choice 
and by the way  you re a little pitchy 
well  i thought you were amazing 
and you look wonderful 
could you just fly away  please 
and so the adventure continues 
what did i tell you  enough 
you know  i do sort of feel
like a floating butterfly 
you are crazier than a road lizard 
mr  egypt  these two here heard
that we re taking over the world
and they want in 
i don t know who they are 
but they re on exhibit here 
too  apparently 
i don t even know what they are

hey  i could show you how bad i am 
fear me

what does it mean  you ve lost me 
is that you breathing
