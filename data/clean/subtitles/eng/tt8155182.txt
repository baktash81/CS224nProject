she was    nice to me 
well  if you have any stories
about her i d like to hear them 
she didn t tell you anything
about the place

nothing 
i didn t realize the house
was so far from campus 
it s far from    everything 
thank you 
everything ok 
oh    yeah 
everything

 distant laughter 
hello 
hello 
hello 
 echoing 
hello  hello  hello 
 gasps

yeah 
what re you doing here 
i thought your bus
didn t get in until 4 00 
it did 
it s 4 00 
it s 5 30 
oh  that means you had to spend
an hour in a truck alone
with ozzie the weirdo 
it s probably for the best 
though 
meredith isn t even back
with the car yet 
ugh 
who the hell knows
where she went 
ok  be warned 
hmm 
rose has gone all ed begley jr  
who 
never mind 
i m thinking of crushing up
some of my klonopin
and spiking her clover juice 
i love clover juice 
right 
i m so over kale 
we found this random clover
patch in the yard a while back 
it inspired us to grow some
in the garden 
did you pick it up yet 
not yet 
lila s here 
i thought she wasn t
getting in until    oh 
well  it s good
you re here  lila 
we need your help

lila  do you wanna pee
outside or inside this week 
uh  inside 
then it s time to get to work 
grab that wire 
ok  lila  this hose is gonna be
our water line
until we get the pipes in 
then our water source will
be officially self contained 
step one of going off the grid 
oh  wait  you guys weren t using
the well before 
no  they stopped using it years
ago because they said the water
was corrupted but i tested it
myself and it s totally fine 
like  perfect 
we should have been done with
this already but it took longer
because someone decided to try
and jury rig the solar panels
so she could use it
to get internet 
dude  we haven t had it for 
like  three days 
wait  there s no internet 
yeah  no internet  no power 
and no cell service  either 
until we get these frikken 
solar panels installed 
there 
once this juices up
we ll have water
and once meredith gets back 
ok  who s who s meredith 
she s    she s the asshole 
yeah  but she s the only one
at the sorority
that s studying native plant
landscape architecture 
so we need her 
yeah  well  she loves her
native plants 
oh   
 indistinct cursing

you had your phone
at the bus stop 
you had your phone in the truck 
on the way to the house 
and now you don t 
it s at tory s 
darnit 
as long as meredith is focused
and booze free she s great

we can be socially conscious
and get shit faced

around here 
really 
a plant has one job  rose 
it does it really well 
the right plant in the right
place won t only thrive

nor bloom of light can stop
a leprechaun from a kill 
what is this

hee hee hee 
killing is the key to my health
and helps me in finding
my wealth 
 gasping 
oh  that is awful

ugh  you re such an idiot 
wow  matt  this looks so cool 
oh  thanks

the garden in an hour 
this is literally the worst
thing that can happen right now 
 irish jig music playing 
what is this 
this wasn t on my play list 
i should put a temporary fence
around the garden 
matt  we should pull up
our mattresses 
sure thing  man 
mmm  no 
i don t know 
i didn t have the right sized
fuses for the circuit box 
i don t think it can handle
that much power at once 
if you want me to sleep
with you again
you don t have to
make up excuses  ok 
just say so 
god  i hate you 
ugh 
she wants me 
ok  well  um  i actually have
portable speakers
that we could just plug
my phone into  no problem 
ugh 
i hate it when people
try too hard 
now we ll probably
be stuck listening
to the wicked soundtrack
all night 
ok   
 screams 
your bear isn t the only animal
on the endangered list  love 
this can t be real 
do i look like a figment
of imagination to you 
ahhhh    
fruity 
and full bodied 
with hints of your mother 
you re the thing my mom always
said was real 
she wasn t crazy 
crazy to think she could get rid
of me forever 
her and her friends tried 
they watched me melt and
threw me down the well to rot 
but if you leave a piece
of a leprechaun intact 
you haven t killed
the leprechaun 
and thanks to this piece of gold
taken from my friend s bowels
i was able to reform
at my discretion 
now  i want the rest of it 
give it to me 
i don t know anything
about your gold 
then what s hanging around
that pretty neck of yours 
ahhhhh     
what kind of trick is this  
it s not a trick 
my mom gave it to me 
she said it would protect me 
it looks as real as me gold 
now what did you do with it 
andy 
katie s never gonna let me hear
the end of this 
i told you this was
gonna happen 
i got the fuses
you told me to 
but   
 sighs

the end of the world 
no  it is kind of the end 
we seriously need to go 
um   
look  i m not crazy  ok 
 laughs  but how would
you know that 
you don t know me 
none of you know me so of course
you think that i m crazy
just like everyone thought
my mother was crazy
and rose told me not to talk
about my mom too much 
we are all so screwed 
where is everyone 
i don t know 
we need to find them 
god  what an asshole 
 growls 
 screams 
 laughing 
your face 
god 
why do you have to be
such a jerk all the time 
what s wrong 
hmm 
i think there s another box
of fuses in the barn 
if we don t turn
everything on at once
i think we can get the lights
working again 
aren t you the smarty pants 
stop it 
hmm 
i am not 
i m not gonna keep doing this 
there once was a lass
in college 
who studied the spirits
for knowledge 
she laid hard with the devil 
to rise up a great level 
but no one begrudged her
the mileage 
 spits 
a golden shower 
i don t care what the others say
about you 
you re a keeper 
what do they say 
you know    i got a glad eye
for a fellow tosspot 
i think i m having
alcohol hallucinations 
don t be selling yourself short 
short 
a walkman and a camera
all in one 
impressive 
what s a walkman 
forget it 
i m looking for something
and if you tell me where it is
i won t rip you to shreds 
what re you looking for 
come a little closer
and i ll tell you 
katie 
oh  rose 
do not tell me something else
is wrong 
i filmed an animal in the house 
it s inside 
everyone needs to close
the doors when they go 
ok  it is not an animal 
it s a leprechaun 
so  no animal 
ok  i am going to try
to explain this calmly
so that you both can see
that this is real 
i went to get my speakers
and the leprechaun was wearing
my bear s head and it 
it attacked me
and then it ran off
when all the lights went out 
thank god 
not for you  lila 
for the house 
oh  for you that sounds   
mental illness is a really
unfortunate problem 
maybe she hit her head 
there is a deranged dwarf
obsessed with money
in the kitchen 
 together  what 
yeah  i got away before
he could do anything 
see  that s him 
i told you 
it could be a crackhead who
got a hold of the wrong stuff 
 all  it s a leprechaun 
how did you get that 
guys  i always thought
that my mom was sick  ok 
i mean  the strange things
that she used to say 
that he would murder anyone
for his gold 
yeah  well  maybe we shouldn t
take stock
in the rantings
of a crazy person 
she wasn t 
ok 
i mean  i always thought  but   
you know  she wasn t 
katie and andy are out back 
we can t leave them 
guys 
guys  i really don t think
this is a good 
i gotta go take a leak 
no  no  no  no  that s latex
which isn t biodegrade   
i make such bad choices 
come on  katie 
i don t wanna have another talk
right now  ok 
my sentiments exactly 
the ladies always want to
ruin the moment 
that s why i m fond of
tearing out their tongues 
what the hell are you 
i m a leprechaun and i ve come
to get me gold back 
you wouldn t know anything
about that now  would you 
dude

i  i don t think
that he s a cannibal

that frikken  jaunty hat

i m looking for the north star
on my star gazing app 
do you see it 
yeah  look 
see  it s that one 
so we re supposed to go north 
well  technically the sorority
house is south east but   
i don t know 
without the proper coordinates
i don t know exactly
where we are  so   
you have no idea 
no 
 rustling 
shh  shh 
it s him 
we are so dead 
be quiet 
 screaming 
you re not dead 
good for you 
thank you 
what re you doing out here 
i m looking for his gold 
i thought you said you didn t
know where it was 
well  i didn t 
but now i do 
almost 
ok 
alright 
alright 
oh  shit 
 cackling 
lights  camera  decapitation 
work goddamit 
why do you look so sore 
audiences love lots of gore 
help 
 screaming 
as long as you don t let it
get to your head 
i tried to warn you 
and now you re dead 
 chuckling 
ok  so my mom and her friends
hid the gold 
i guess they didn t want
anything to do with it
but they hid it here
in case it came back 
which  obviously  he did 
where d you find the map 
oz 
look  what if the gold
isn t there 
it has to be 
look  there 
that seems like a big enough
marker  don t you think 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
ok 
um  ok 
look  we found it 
yeah 
 squealing 
oh 
what 
that s what he s trying
to kill us for 
that seems a little
anticlimactic 
well  yeah  but if that s what
he wants then we just 
we have to give it to him 
no 
you can t give that to him 
that isn t all of it 
how do you know that 
because i found it
months ago  ok 
i didn t know who s it was 
it was just here 
just    hidden here 
you stole it 
i only took what i needed
for the house project 
i  i kept a record of it
so i would know how much
to buy back
once i could afford it
after everyone saw what i 
what we did with
the house project 
so much for the sorority code 
this is something you should
have mentioned before  rose 
my god we re so screwed 
i thought we were gonna
get away 
i  i don t understand  though 
i thought you had a successful
gofundme page 
please 
no one really gives a shit
about saving the environment 
the only people that gave money
were my stepmother out of guilt
and some dude from albuquerque
who asked if i would send
a naked picture of myself
in return for 20 bucks 
which i did  by the way 
so i funded it all myself 
but i only took as much
as i needed 
i planned on buying it all back
and returning it
from the cash for gold place 
ok  ok 
how much more was in there
when you first found it 
not much more 
well  what does
your notebook say 
i guess like   
oh my god 
so overflowing 
ok  look 
we can just take it back
to the cash for gold place
and get it back 
it s all the way in bismarck 
god 
what have you done  rose 
now we have nothing
to offer him 
oh my god  oh my god 
he s gonna kill us all 
no  no  no  no  no 
ok  ok  look 
if we can t give him
his gold then   
then there s only one thing
left to do 
run forever 
no 
we use his strengths
against him 
and we kill him 
where are you going 
ok  i don t know  actually 
that just seemed like
the right thing to do
but we should probably make
a plan first 
yeah 
ok  well  we know his strengths 
i mean  that s something 
yeah  but we don t know
what his weaknesses are
and we can t just google
how to kill a leprechaun 
wait  can we 
if we had power  yeah 
we could just reboot the
internet and call the police 
wait  is there a way to turn
the power back on 
i just have to change the fuse 
 loud screech 
lila  why didn t he take
the coin around your neck 
well  he tried but it burned
his hand when he grabbed it 
let me see it 
i think it s fool s gold 
how can you tell 
andy tried to pass off
this bracelet he got
for my birthday as real gold 
it wasn t 
lila  fool s good
is iron pyrite 
iron 
that s a thing  right 
that sounds like a thing
we can stop him with 
oh  yeah 
and four leaf clovers 
how do you know that 
i just do 
where are we gonna get
that much iron 
guys  i have an idea 
 scream 
we are so not going to pull
this off 
we can do this 
we can do this 
well  we have to give it to him 
that s easy for you  you have
protection around your neck 
ok  i thought we said that we
were all gonna stick together 
we have been  and look
where that got us 
if we give it to him
we re as good as dead 
you don t know what
you re talking about 
neither do you  lila 
just because your mother
dealt with this
doesn t mean you re gonna
walk out of it  too 
you re gonna get us all killed 
well  fine 
then i ll just give
it to him myself 
  fine 
  fine

a bunch of chirping birds

 cackling 
 cackling 
two pretty sights in one 
me gold and a girl
who s fate is undone 
you want it 
it s yours 
looks like your friends
didn t agree with your plan 
they didn t want me
to give it to you 
but if i didn t
you d just kill us 
ok 
so it s yours  just 
just take it and leave 
very wise of you

lila s mother s voice  i told
you  all of this is real

you could wish me back 
these people aren t
your friends

 groaning 
 explosion 
hey

 squealing 
so    now what 
ok  ok 
now we have to burn
the rest of him 
because he said if you leave
a piece of a leprechaun
you haven t killed a leprechaun
so we have to get rid
of all of him 
like a funeral pyre 
yeah  i guess so 
we can get a fire started
in the front yard
because i never wanna see that
shitty lilliputian ever again 
no rose  we don t wanna hear
how fire releases carbon dioxide
into the air  ok 
ok 
fine 
i ll sweep him up 
scream if anything happens 
what more could possibly happen 
well  this has been the weirdest
day of my life 
yeah 
after everything i went through
with my mother
i didn t think i d have
a weirder day 
then again  i also never thought
i d have any friends

more fiscally responsible 
maybe you   
need to liquidate 
 choking

a little too late 
the best you can hope for
is a painful fate 
 cackling
