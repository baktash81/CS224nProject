ago because they said the water
was corrupted but i tested it
myself and its totally fine

i should put a temporary fence
around the garden
matt we should pull up
our mattresses

that much power at once
if you want me to sleep
with you again
you dont have to
make up excuses ok
just say so
god i hate you
ugh
she wants me
ok well um i actually have
portable speakers

my phone into no problem

to the wicked soundtrack
all night
ok
screams
your bear isnt the only animal
on the endangered list love
this cant be real
do i look like a figment
of imagination to you
ahhhh
fruity
and fullbodied
with hints of your mother
youre the thing my mom always
said was real
she wasnt crazy
crazy to think she could get rid
of me forever
her and her friends tried
they watched me melt and
threw me down the well to rot
but if you leave a piece
of a leprechaun intact
you havent killed
the leprechaun
and thanks to this piece of gold
taken from my friends bowels
i was able to reform
at my discretion
now i want the rest of it
give it to me
i dont know anything
about your gold
then whats hanging around
that pretty neck of yours
ahhhhh
what kind of trick is this
its not a trick
my mom gave it to me
she said it would protect me
it looks as real as me gold
now what did you do with it
andy
katies never gonna let me hear
the end of this
i told you this was
gonna happen
i got the fuses

is wrong
i filmed an animal in the house
its inside
everyone needs to close
the doors when they go
ok it is not an animal
its a leprechaun
so no animal
ok i am going to try
to explain this calmly
so that you both can see
that this is real
i went to get my speakers
and the leprechaun was wearing
my bears head and it
it attacked me
and then it ran off
when all the lights went out
thank god
not for you lila
for the house
oh for you that sounds
mental illness is a really
unfortunate problem
maybe she hit her head
there is a deranged dwarf
obsessed with money
in the kitchen
together what
yeah i got away before
he could do anything
see thats him
i told you
it could be a crackhead who
got a hold of the wrong stuff
all its a leprechaun
how did you get that
guys i always thought
that my mom was sick ok
i mean the strange things
that she used to say
that he would murder anyone
for his gold
yeah well maybe we shouldnt
take stock
in the rantings
of a crazy person
she wasnt
ok
i mean i always thought but
you know she wasnt
katie and andy are out back

im looking for the north star
on my stargazing app
do you see it
yeah look
see its that one
so were supposed to go north
well technically the sorority
house is south east but
i dont know
without the proper coordinates
i dont know exactly
where we are so
you have no idea
no
rustling
shh shh
its him
we are so dead
be quiet
screaming
youre not dead
good for you
thank you
whatre you doing out here
im looking for his gold
i thought you said you didnt
know where it was
well i didnt
but now i do
almost
ok
alright
alright
oh shit
cackling
lights camera decapitation
work goddamit
why do you look so sore
audiences love lots of gore
help
screaming
as long as you dont let it
get to your head
i tried to warn you
and now youre dead
chuckling
ok so my mom and her friends
hid the gold
i guess they didnt want
anything to do with it
but they hid it here
in case it came back
which obviously he did
whered you find the map
oz
look what if the gold
isnt there
it has to be
look there
that seems like a big enough
marker dont you think
yeah yeah yeah
ok
um ok
look we found it
yeah
squealing
oh
what
thats what hes trying
to kill us for
that seems a little
anticlimactic
well yeah but if thats what
he wants then we just
we have to give it to him
no
you cant give that to him
that isnt all of it
how do you know that
because i found it
months ago ok
i didnt know whos it was
it was just here
just hidden here
you stole it
i only took what i needed
for the house project
i i kept a record of it
so i would know how much
to buy back
once i could afford it
after everyone saw what i
what we did with
the house project
so much for the sorority code
this is something you should
have mentioned before rose
my godwere so screwed
i thought we were gonna
get away
i i dont understand though
i thought you had a successful
gofundme page
please
no one really gives a shit
about saving the environment
the only people that gave money
were my stepmother out of guilt
and some dude from albuquerque
who asked if i would send
a naked picture of myself
in return for 20 bucks
which i did by the way
so i funded it all myself
but i only took as much
as i needed
i planned on buying it all back
and returning it
from the cash for gold place
ok ok
how much more was in there
when you first found it
not much more
well what does
your notebook say
i guess like
oh my god
so overflowing

that just seemed like
the right thing to do
but we should probably make
a plan first
yeah
ok well we know his strengths
i mean thats something
yeah but we dont know
what his weaknesses are
and we cant just google
how to kill a leprechaun
wait can we
if we had power yeah
we could just reboot the
internet and call the police
wait is there a way to turn
the power back on
i just have to change the fuse
loud screech
lila why didnt he take
the coin around your neck

his hand when he grabbed it

how fire releases carbon dioxide
into the air ok
