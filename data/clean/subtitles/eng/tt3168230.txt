i was going to 
  you must forgive my son 
he loves bees 
  it isn t a bee  it s a wasp 
different thing entirely 
  was that him 
  ah  the prodigal returns 
ooh 
  outside  roger 
you know you re not allowed 
like having a welsh pony 
will you be going up
to your study 
  no  not as yet 
ah  yes  home again 
home again 
mrs  munro 
it would appear we ve had
a decrease in population 
did mr  healy not come by
to take care of the apiary
whilst i was gone 
  yes  but he won t be able
to do it next time 
  did mr  healy say that 
  no  his daughter did 
she s taken him to live
with her  too feeble  she said 
  is he too feeble 
  seemed spry enough 
chattier  maybe 
  with you 
  with himself 
  key to the study 
is that lunch 
  mm 
  hmm   
 watson had married 
 and i was alone  
in fact  it was on the very day 
 he left baker street 
 that the case which was
to be my last began to unfold  
 it was almost 30 years ago  
 the great war had ended 
 and the tourists 
 had come back to baker street 
 to catch a glimpse 
 of the real sherlock holmes  
 thankfully  in his stories  
 watson had always published 
 a false address
 for our actual quarters  
so you found the right address 
why did you do it 
  sir 
  break into my study 
my study is
my sanctum sanctorum 
private place 
  before you went to japan 
i saw you writing that story 
i didn t know you wrote stories 
  oh  dr  watson  yes 
he was the writer 
  well  so i borrowed mum s key
and went into your study 
and there it was 
  and how much did you read 
  just to where you stopped 
it was a good part too 
a man comes to baker street 
you say 
 you ve come about your wife  
how could you tell 
did you do the thing 
  what thing would that be 
   the cane shows the marks
of a dog s teeth 
the wood is from an island
southwest of madeira  
that thing 
  and how would you tell
that a man s visit
was about his wife 
  he wears a wedding ring 
  no 
the clues are all on that page 
this sentence  to be exact 
   one day  into the room
came a young man 
in newly pressed 
albeit inexpensive clothes  
the clothes are freshly pressed 
he s a young man  though 
not expensive clothes 
then his wife must press them 
men don t have the talent
and he can t afford
a servant to do so 
  very good 
  that s how you knew
it was about the wife 
  well  no 
when you re a detective
and a man comes to visit you   
it s usually about his wife 
  so why did you stop
where you did 
  ahh   
ah  did you get the things
from the chemist 
  on order 
said it would be a few days 
  we ll hold them to that 
otherwise  triumphant  were you 
  like v e day 
oh  doctor s here 
  did you catch cold in japan 
  does it sound it 
  i thought you might be coming
off the tail end of something 
lost some weight as well 
  hmm 
  did you find
what you were looking for 
the mysterious ashy prick 
  prickly ash 
  oh  yes  sorry 
that was the reason the fellow
invited you to japan  wasn t it 
dig up a pile of the stuff 
smuggle it home 
  it can t interfere
with anything you ve prescribed 
but surely it can t do me ill 
  in and of itself  no 
  you mean there might be
side effects 
  perhaps 
  such as 
  hope 
what was the name of the fellow
who invited you to japan 
you just spent a week
with the man 
corresponded with him
for months 
do you recall his name 
there s a flat adjacent to
my surgery that s gone to let   
  no 
  what happens when you don t
recall where the telephone is 
or you forget
to turn off the gas 
you can t live alone 
  i don t live alone 
i have the housekeeper 
  take this diary 
each day you don t recall
a name or place 
make a mark on the page
for that day s date 
  and if i forget
to make the mark 
oh    mm 
no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
  it s the royal jelly 
  yes  well 
we re not using it anymore 
instead 
we re going to use this 
it s called prickly ash 
  is it food 
  mm   
  eurgh  looks like
it came out the down spout 
  it came from japan 
  that makes all the difference 
  you add it in as you would
the royal jelly 
in the tea or the coffee 
and you should try
cooking with it
to enhance your specialities 
  mr  holmes 
mr  holmes 
tamiki umezaki 
welcome to japan 
i am so honoured
you have accepted my invitation 
we spend tonight at my house 
tomorrow we begin our search 
i have owned your book
for 20 years 
i purchased my copy
when it first appeared in print 
i hope you ll do me the honour
of a personal inscription 
  oh  yes  of course 
um   
mr  umezaki 
how close to the city
does the prickly ash grow 
  it is found
mostly near the sea 
  and how far
shall we have to go 
  where i am thinking
is two days  journey by train 
you are very eager 
  i m in the middle of a project
that i m keen to finish
and my wits must be
at their sharpest 
i want to be able to benefit
from the effect
as soon as possible 
  it s that urgent 
  i fear it s so 
  you are very great detective 
  thank you very much 
  my mother  she wonders
if you have brought
your famous hat 
  oh  the deer stalker 
that was an embellishment
of the illustrator 
i ve never worn one 
  and the pipe 
  i prefer a cigar 
i told watson 
if i ever write a story myself 
it will be to correct
the million misconceptions
created by his
imaginative licence 
  did you write such a story 
  but i m trying to do so now 
i must finish with you
before i die 
 so you ve come
about your wife  
 you ve come about your wife   
 you ve come    
roger 
here 
i ll see you after lunch 
i m going to need some help
with the bees 
so you found the right address 
  a friendly porter at 221b 
  it s just a minor fiction
to mislead the curious 
most of them
seem to be american 
have a seat  mr  kelmot 
so   
you ve come about your wife 
  how did you know 
  it doesn t matter 
tell me what you have to say 
  my wife is named ann 
her mother died in childbirth 
her father was a colonel 
killed in that business
at waziristan 
 we wanted very much
 to have children  
she lost our first child
in her third month   
 our second in her fourth  
 we were told it was
 too dangerous to try again  
 ann was    distraught  
it was as though
each of them lost
had been a real child 
as opposed to   
thank you 
for a time 
she even insisted i have
a pair of headstones carved
and placed in our cemetery plot 
as if their bodies
were buried beneath 
she was in desperate need
of something to soothe
this dangerous melancholy 
she liked music so i suggested
the glass armonica 
  the armonica 
  my father s
most prized possession 
 he played it constantly 
 till the day he died  
i had it brought to the house 
 and arranged
 a month s worth of lessons  
 one hour per week  
soon ann asked me
if she could
increase the lessons
to twice a week 
then three times 
then every day 
  so  she took up the avocation 
 you hoped she would  
why are you here  mr  kelmot 
  mr  holmes 
my ann has changed 
and it isn t just the lessons
or her obsession
with the instrument 
one day i was outside the room 
 and suddenly
 her playing stopped  
 and i heard her saying 
 quite clearly    
  grace  james 
  those were to be
the names of your children 
  when i confronted ann 
she denied it 
so i forbad her
playing the armonica
and i forbad her
taking the lessons 
the woman who teaches them 
madame schirmer 
is a person
of dangerous beliefs 
  the dangerous beliefs
of a music teacher 
  she s put a spell on ann 
preying upon
her weak frame of mind 
for what reason i cannot say 
  have you proof of this 
  following my instructions 
she stopped seeing
madame schirmer 
i received in the post   
three receipts from the woman 
each for the payment
of one armonica lesson 
again ann denied it 
consequently  my wife
is no longer permitted
to withdraw money from the bank 
 then yesterday  i followed ann
 to the place where
 the woman gives her lessons  
 even on the pavement below 
 i could hear her playing  
 naturally  i went inside 
 but the schirmer woman said  
 your wife is not here  
last night  i questioned ann 
  and she said that she hadn t
been to madame schirmer s rooms 
  not for weeks 
  do you have
a portrait of your wife 
i shall take your case if you
answer just one last question 
  certainly 
  what perfume
does your wife wear 
  roger 
it s late 
lights out like it s the blitz 
look at you 
do you remember your dad 
  i remember him holding my hand
and taking me to the sea 
  you re not remembering 
that s the picture 
what about
the invisible stories 
some nights at bedtime 
your dad would make up stories 
he d    he d say 
 give me three things  
and you d say 
 a ball  a cat and roger  
so then he d   
he d make up some tale
about a ball that had
a pet cat named roger 
always a something
and something and roger 
you don t remember
any of the invisible stories 
  no  do you 
  i was never any good
at stories 
sleep well 
 the first thing
 to know is there s no danger  
bees aren t interested
in harming you 
their only concern
is self preservation 
  from people 
  they re much too clever
for people 
their enemies are the weather 
disease and predators 
the wasp is their
particular antagonist 
did you know that one wasp
can kill 40 honey bees
in under a minute 
in consequence 
we do not like wasps 
  yes  sir 
we do not like wasps 
  ah 
the queen runs the colony 
the drones service the queen 
hands up 
workers do the work 
as it should be 
of concern is the latest
decrease in the bee population 
we ve identified the problem 
and now we must solve it 
right  there you are 
off you go 
  have you ever been bitten
by a bee 
  stung 
bees don t have teeth 
yes  i have 
  well  not often  though 
  7 816 times 
i keep a record 
you re not entirely dreadful 
  you ever been bit 
  no  i have never been bit 
  well  people work with bees
all the time  don t they 
  what is royal jelly 
  it s a special secretion
of the worker bees 
and it s royal because 
  it feeds the queen 
  bravo 
it was the jelly s
curative powers
that prompted my monograph 
the value of royal jelly
with further comments
on the potential health benefits
of prickly ash 
  what s that 
  prickly ash  hmm 
well  in japanese  hire sansho 
is the common word
for zanthoxylum piperitum  
it s used to treat
various degenerative diseases 
anaemia  circulatory
conditions    arthritis and   
hmm  what s it called 
oh  senility 
that was a witticism 
the newest research suggests
that prickly ash
has far more promise
than royal jelly 
henceforth  prickly ash
is all that we should use 
  have you written more
about the man and his wife 
  all in good time 
  is it real 
  of course 
fiction is worthless 
  the place you stopped 
why do you want to know
the wife s perfume 
  cameo rose  is it 
  yes 
  always leaves a trace 
madame schirmer 
madame schirmer  this is
thomas kelmot  let me in 
madame schirmer 
  herr kelmot  i did warn 
you come 
i call the metropolitan police 
  madame 
my friend s emotional state
is such that  if denied entry 
he might not be able
to restrain his passions 
allow us both in  and
i will take full responsibility 
thank you so much 
  who is this 
  this gentleman is a detective 
  ja  his badge  please 
  his name
is mr  sherlock holmes 
  you don t mind if i close
this  do you  such a draught 
  no  i have seen sherlock
holmes in the magazines 
with the hat and the pipe 
it was never this person 
  madame schirmer 
i saw ann enter this place 
i demand you produce her 
  your wife is not here 
  you said that last time 
  you question my truth 
oswald  my dear 
it is a wish to know
if you are this man s wife 
  no 
  you could be in disguise 
  i don t think so 
  voilà  
it is  i believe  what
the english call a water closet 
  she was here  i saw her 
  mr  kelmot  if you insist
on following your wife
when you have employed me
to do the same 
one or the other of us will
find himself made redundant 
he is distraught 
  he is a fool 
  the armonica
used to be thought of
as an instrument
of the black arts 
said to be used
to call for the dead 
something to do
with the nature of the glasses 
  you don t believe that 
surely 
  what i believe
plays no part in this matter 
when was mrs  kelmot last here 
  weeks now 
  then the receipts
you posted to her address
were for oswald s lessons 
mrs  kelmot is paying for them 
  frau kelmot is passionate 
but an amateur 
she knew it was oswald
who has the gift 
you knew she was not here 
  of course 
oswald doesn t wear her scent 
  you are still not
sherlock holmes 
  how considerate 
you waited for me 
  what are you doing 
  trying to see
if i can tell where i ve been 
  don t you know 
  mr  holmes
can tell things like that
just from looking at a person 
  where are you off to 
  see to the bees 
  you ll eat
your breakfast first 
got a letter from your aunt
the other day 
she says there s a couple
in portsmouth
opening a hotel there 
need a housekeeper 
  why would we want
to live in portsmouth 
  can t stay here forever 
  why not 
  because we can t 
  what s in portsmouth 
  this couple are opening
a hotel there   
  you said that 
  you ll leave the table when
you re finished and not before 
  i m not finished 
  you don t eat
that japanese muck 
  it s hire sansho  
  i know you like working
with the hive   
  it s an apiary 
  and you like
being given responsibility 
but i shouldn t get too close 
  bees don t bite 
  i don t mean the bees 
mr  holmes
won t be here forever 
your aunt says this hotel
might even take you on 
they got porters and   
  have porters 
finished 
  chemist delivered your things 
shall i have roger
open the crate 
  no  i ll see to it
when i m finished 
  yes  sir 
sir 
i know roger s been
a help to you  he s a good boy 
he s always been clever 
his dad and i
weren t the sort to know
the things a boy like roger
takes interest in 
  exceptional children
are often the product
of unremarkable parents 
  i ve got a sister 
she lives in portsmouth 
a couple of her acquaintants are
opening a private hotel there 
say they re willing
to take roger and me on 
  you have a sister 
never would have thought it 
is this a matter of wages 
  no 
  hmm 
i shall take this
under advisement 
  my mother was sad
to see you leave 
  i m rather sorry now
i didn t bring the deerstalker 
  you said you never wore one 
  well  yes 
but it would ve pleased her 
  she wanted the fictional 
you are the real 
  well 
i m not sure that s true 
i think i was real once
until john made me into fiction 
and then after that 
i had little choice 
play the part
as he d fashioned it 
or become its contradiction 
i m actually quite fond
of a pipe 
but to smoke it 
especially in public 
after it became so well known
a prop  seemed vulgar 
  so  dr  watson s imagination
changed you 
  i ve never had much use
for imagination 
i prefer facts 
  my father
would bring me here as a child 
it was designed as a miniature 
we walk as giants 
the stones represent the lives
of those he has lost 
  oh   
  sherlock san 
  hire sansho  
  prickly ash 
  mr  holmes 
  hmm 
  too late to check on the bees 
  not in the least 
  bee check 
they re quiet 
  yes 
  what happens
when the bees die 
  is this
a metaphysical question 
  i mean  do you mourn them 
  oh  i can t say that i ve ever
mourned the dead 
bees or otherwise 
i concentrate on circumstances 
how did it die 
who was responsible 
death  grieving  mourning 
they re all commonplace 
logic is rare  and so   
i dwell on logic 
well  thank you  kind sir 
night  bees 
  sweet dreams  bees 
  now  what do you say
we go for a dip tomorrow 
  in the sea 
  yes 
  it ll be brisk 
  good for the blood 
  all right  then 
  what sort of books
do you like  hmm 
apart from dr  watson s stories
and books about bees 
  those are
all the books i have 
  well  there s a perfectly good
library right here  inside 
you can take any book you like 
  mr  holmes 
are we going for our swim 
i ve already seen to the apiary 
are you all right 
  i m perfectly   
i m quite   
perfectly fine 
all right  roger 
you go along  i ll catch you up 
roger  come along
or we ll lose the day 
well done 
  the photograph is her 
isn t it 
the woman in the story 
  yes 
  is she why you re writing it 
  i wouldn t say
i was writing it   
it s more i m trying
to remember it 
ah  thank you 
a few months ago 
my brother mycroft died 
 his club  the diogenes  
 asked that i go up to london 
 to retrieve his things  
 i was given a small chest 
containing the watson stories  
 none of which
 i d ever actually read  
 they were as john
 always described them  
 penny dreadfuls
 with an elevated prose style  
 but one of the titles
 piqued my interest  
 the story was familiar  
 but its ending felt very 
 very wrong  
 i d not seen any of
 the cinematic depictions  
 but by a fortunate chance  
 an opportunity soon arose  
it s strange to see a semblance
 of one s self 40 feet high    
  i fear for my ann s sanity  
  fear for her sanity  
 dear man 
you should fear for your life  
  whatever do you mean  
  murder  mr  kelmot  murder  
    and played 
 as a character
 out of pantomime  
   poisoned  
 with what means have i  
  your armonica 
 madame schirmer  
  preposterous  
  or rather  the glasses  
 it is the lead in the crystal
 that creates the unique tone  
 absorbed into the blood
 through the skin  
 small exposure can produce
 confusion  hallucinations  
but constant  obsessive contact 
can end in insanity and death  
 every plot twist
 came with a twirl
 of a moustache 
 and ended
 in an exclamation mark  
 our
would be murderer is ingenious  
  surely you re not
 referring to    
  i m afraid  mrs  kelmot 
 you will have to find yourself
 a new music teacher  
  oh  
 absolute rubbish  
what possible motive
could that german woman
have had to kill ann 
that night
i searched for something
to jog my memory
of the actual case 
 and there it was   
 her picture  
you know  a few years ago 
i could have told you everything
about the woman
in that photograph 
certainly i d recall
what had become of her 
whether she was victim
or culprit 
but that night   
i couldn t remember any of it 
all i knew for certain
was that the case was my last
and it was why
i left the profession 
came down here 
retired to my bees 
so  i decided to
write the story down on paper
as it was  not as john made it 
get it right before i die 
  you re not going to die 
  roger 
i m 93 
  i had a great uncle
who lived to be 102 
  well  then 
that seals my fate 
what are the odds
that you would know
two men who would live
that long 
  well  i didn t
actually know him 
i ll see to the bees 
ow  mr  holmes 
  mr  holmes 
  aargh  aargh 
i ve been stung 
  unlike the wasp 
the bee always leaves its sting 
  i must have done
something stupid 
  oh  no 
sometimes   
there s no reason at all 
right 
salt water  you drink that 
or onion juice
to prevent serious consequences 
and no need to tell your mother
about all this 
we don t want to worry her 
do we 
  you going to go back
to the story 
  is that the price
for your silence 
  tight lips 
  how considerate 
you waited for me 
good afternoon 
  sir 
  tea for one in the window 
  certainly  sir  mind the step 
  ill  do you say 
  took all the strength he had
just to write out the cheque 
  there you are  sir 
  thank you 
well  here we are 
  have you used this before 
  no  i haven t 
it is highly poisonous 
a drop will more than suffice 
  thank you 
it s just thomas
is in such a state 
he insisted i made certain 
  reassure mr  kelmot
that the particulars of the will
have not changed
since he dictated them 
your possessions are bequeathed
to him  as his are to you 
thank you so much 
it was so good to see you 
  excuse me 
  yes  miss 
is the 8 10 the fast service 
  the 8 10 s the slow one 
makes local stops 
and the 9 05 
  that s the fast train 
goes right on through 
  all aboard 
  thank you 
  all aboard 
  honeybees
are attracted to you 
it s the scent  cameo rose 
  oh 
  she thinks you re a flower 
must confuse
the little thing no end 
may i 
  oh 
  very kind 
ah  the iris 
amazing resilience 
enough light and they will grow
in the most
uninhabitable regions 
desert  cold  rock 
why do you suppose it is
that something as small
and insignificant as the iris
should be so much stronger
than we are 
  perhaps they re less affected
by what goes on around them 
  hmm 
are you a botanist 
  amateur only 
i am  by disposition 
a hobbyist 
in fact  if i may 
there is one particular
hobby of mine
that might amuse you 
i can see the future 
shall i read your palm 
i promise
i ll find nothing dreadful 
  what about our friend 
oh 
oh 
  hmm  hmm 
your parents are gone 
your mother long ago 
your father more recently 
you had love in your heart
for someone   
no  for more than one person 
but they have left you 
and your love for them
has nowhere to go 
you re in pain 
but you must not allow your pain
to guide your actions 
where that leads   
the lines are not so distinct 
  why 
  i beg your pardon 
  you see so much 
why can t you see
what happens next 
  the lines   
  yes  you said 
ply your parlour tricks
elsewhere  mr  holmes 
  wait 
i can t   
i can t remember 
  mum  mum 
  mr  holmes 
was it the smoke
knocked him out 
  could have done 
most likely he stood up
too quickly
and lost consciousness 
it isn t the first time 
the last housekeeper
didn t know what to do 
he must have decided
to take it subcutaneously 
  well  now we can t leave 
  no 
made sure of that  didn t he 
  where s the hire sansho  
the prickly ash 
  if it s not there 
i m sure i don t know 
  did you throw it out 
  why would i do that 
  for spite and malice 
  where d you get words
like that 
  the dictionary 
  like as not 
he took the muck himself 
got burnt up
with the rest of it 
those can go on the fire 
  did mr  holmes say
you were to do this 
  he always disposes
of that sort 
  how do you know
what sort these are 
  you want to know
who writes to him 
pensioners who think
they ve solved jack the ripper 
widows who ve lost their cats
and just know he s the only
man on earth who can find them 
he s the last resort
for every lunatic out there 
  it s not your decision 
  it is   
if i m to be a full bore
medical staff at cook s wages 
he s an invalid  needs a nurse 
not a housekeeper 
  all he did was took a fall 
  your granddad
was hale and hearty
60 summers
then he took a fall 
it was three weeks
to the day he died 
should be in hospital 
that or one of them places 
  he ll get better 
  and the day he does
is the day we go 
is that clear 
  hmm 
oh 
  got a letter from japan 
it s from mr  umezaki 
  have you read it 
  no  wanted to 
  sin of desire 
you re a catholic 
  mum says you throw out
most of the letters you get 
  and why do you think that is 
  the people who write
want you to solve things 
if you read their letters 
you d want to help 
  oh  no 
you give me too much credit 
it s just
if i were to read them 
i d feel obliged to respond 
  perhaps mr  umezaki s
asking you to go back to japan 
  oh 
i ll never go back to japan 
  why not 
  long journey  old man 
  you made it before 
  that was before 
  maybe you could get
more prickly ash 
  the prickly ash hasn t made
a bit of difference
to my memory 
any more
than the royal jelly did 
yes 
the only inspiration
for any sort of recollections
has been you 
go on  you open it 
he s writing to say
his mother is dead 
  how could you tell 
  mr  umezaki swore that
he would never contact me again 
the only thing that would
make him change his mind
would be a deathbed instruction
from his mother 
a good son always does
what his mother asks 
  mr  holmes 
you re not to be out of bed 
  mrs  munro 
i have counted the steps
from the bed to the window 
from the window to the   
  you re not to do anything
on your own 
you re to ring 
  i thought it was
an imposition 
  it will be an imposition
if you lose your bearings
and end up on the floor
for me to collect 
  i hadn t realised
that this had become
an industrial dispute 
i ve been trying
to calculate the likelihood
that we should find hire sansho 
in a place
so utterly devoid of life 
  perhaps it is life
reasserting itself 
 hire sansho  
  how does it taste 
  it isn t for the taste
that we sought it 
ah  now  before we leave 
there s something
that i mustn t forget 
i ve signed it 
as you requested 
  oh 
  not certain
you can read my scrawl 
   to mr  umezaki  who has not
owned this book for long  
  you haven t had this book
for 20 years 
it came from the library 
the glue mark shows
where you removed
the card jacket 
you know nothing about bees
or royal jelly or prickly ash 
  enough to bring you here 
during our correspondence
over the last few months   
was my name not familiar to you 
  no 
  my father s  then 
masuo umezaki 
  i never knew your father 
  he was a diplomat in london 
years ago 
he loved all things english 
the first gift he gave to me
was a cricket bat 
the second was this 
in english 
so as to  assist my education  
   after consulting
 with the very great
detective sherlock holmes 
 i realise it s in the best
interests of us all
 that i remain
in england indefinitely 
 you will see from this book
 that he is a very wise
and intelligent man 
and that his say in this matter
should not be taken lightly  
  we never heard from him again 
  i m sorry 
  my mother is dying 
she grew old without a husband 
all because of you 
  i understand 
the last time
you heard from your father
was the first time
you heard about me 
masuo vanished from your life
and i arrived   
in the form of a book 
one replaced the other 
as it were 
i suggest you and your mother
take whatever time you have
to come to terms
with the facts of the case 
a man abandoned his family
and wrote his son a story 
he wouldn t be the first
to cloak his cowardice
in a flag of sacrifice 
i m sorry 
but i never knew your father 
  i shall not bother you
any longer with my questions 
but if the prickly ash succeeds 
you will let me know 
  aargh  argh 
aargh 
help 
help 
thank you 
i look like i ve been attacked
by the hound
of the baskervilles 
  can t let mum
see you wearing that top 
  no 
  it s evidence 
  yes 
what of  a murder 
oh    i ve something for you 
no 
 apis cerana japonica  
  they have bees in japan 
  yes  just like our bees 
only they re japanese 
no  it s for you  it s a gift 
  oh  thank you 
  arigato  as they say in japan 
something the matter 
  you lost
another dozen bees today 
  a dozen 
  what do you think it is 
  an outbreak of mortality 
could be a disease
we ve not seen before 
or a sudden mutation 
you bring up some corpses
and we ll examine them 
  yes  sir 
  and my glass 
study 
should be in one of the drawers 
roger 
roger 
  mr  holmes feels better today 
  is that so 
  hmm 
  mr  holmes
feels so much better 
we re about to start
an investigation 
  of what 
  the crime wave
that has done away
with a number of our apiary s
most prominent residents 
  well  if you need suspects 
you know where to find me 
  mum  wait 
i bet if we asked  mr  holmes
would    do his thing 
the thing he does
where he tells people
who they are and where
they ve been  just from looking 
do mum for her 
  i m sure your mother
doesn t need to be told
where she s been 
  let s not bother mr  holmes
with any foolishness 
  it s not foolishness  here 
you come and stand in front
of mr  holmes  just like that 
and he will tell you
where you ve been 
do it 
you want her
to turn in a circle 
  no  that won t be necessary 
  turn in a circle 
  you ve been away
most of the day 
the soot on your dress attests
that you went by train
to portsmouth 
as all other nearby rail lines
which might accommodate
a return trip of this length
are under repair or beyond it 
in portsmouth  you met
the couple who run the hotel 
your hair and nails are evidence
that you wished to make
a favourable impression 
they made you an offer 
you accepted 
you declined tea 
and did not see the sister
for whom you have
no particular fondness 
using my indisposition
as an excuse to hurry back 
  it wasn t an excuse 
  you accepted 
  start a week monday 
  both of us 
  we re both going 
  she wants me
to be a bootblack 
  roger 
  she wants me
to do what she does 
  there is no shame
in what i do 
  you complain enough about it 
always going on
about how hard things are 
and you wish you had it better 
she can barely read 
  go after her 
apologise for saying things
that were meant to hurt 
you were cruel 
if you don t apologise 
you will regret it 
  people always say that 
  because it s true 
 moi  je regrette tellement  
  you regret   
  so much 
  your dad hated
what he did for a living 
mechanic in a garage 
like his dad before him 
when he got called up 
he said to me 
 my love 
i ll not spend this war
 underneath the oil pan
of some toff s jeep 
i m gonna put in for the raf  
so he did 
he trained 
scored high marks  got assigned
to a bristol blenheim  mark iv 
blown out of the sky 
first time up 
all his mates
who worked the motor pool
came home without a scratch 
  i shouldn t have said
what i said 
  lesson there  then 
don t say everything you think 
  look 
  how did you find that 
  in your desk 
  couldn t have 
  the one in the corner 
didn t know it was a desk
until i opened it 
  oh  that s not my desk 
it s john s 
he left it at baker street
when he went off to get married 
  yes  and there s
a secret compartment
containing the very glove
you ve been writing about 
i know you say dr  watson
didn t always
get things right 
but in the story   
  i am not working
on that story anymore 
  yes  but in watson s story 
he does have the armonica in it 
and the german lady 
and that glove 
so maybe
he did get things right 
  no  that s not possible 
john had gone
from baker street by then 
  well  then why was it
in there 
  i don t know 
and if i ever did know 
i don t remember 
  if you can t remember 
then why couldn t the case
have been a success
like dr  watson wrote it 
  because it was my last case 
and if i d brought it
to a successful conclusion 
i wouldn t have left
the profession
and spent 35 years here  in
this place  away from the world 
i chose exile for my punishment 
but what was it for 
i must have done something
terribly wrong   
and i ve no evidence
of what it was 
only pain  guilt   
useless  worthless feelings 
i wish to god i d never even
taken umezaki s case 
  kelmot s 
  what 
  kelmot s case 
you said umezaki 
  roger  tea s ready 
best clear this up 
mr  holmes 
would you like your tea now 
  mr  holmes 
if you die   
what ll happen to the bees 
  i haven t a clue 
one can t solve everything 
 said to be used
 to call for the dead  
 death  mourning  grief    
 they re all commonplace  
 logic is rare  
  the dead are not
so very far away 
they re just on the other side
of the wall 
  now  whenever
did you say that 
  ply your parlour tricks
elsewhere  mr  holmes 
my husband could never succeed
at deception
so long as i do his laundry 
i don t know much
about your profession 
but i doubt predicting
the future of women
you re engaged to follow
is common practice 
  it was intended only
as a means
to achieve a desired result 
  that being what 
  to delay your actions 
to keep you
from this appointment
you seem so eager to make 
even before
i glimpsed you today 
i d gleaned some
of the passionate
feelings you have
for your husband 
the man who took away
the music you loved 
denied you the pleasures
of your lessons 
even refused even
to mark a child s grave 
all these predicted
your antipathy 
and then i witnessed
your actions 
 forging his signature  
 drawing down his account  
 purchasing poison 
 consulting his will  
 planning an escape
 with a mystery man 
 who was paid a handsome fee  
and all for my benefit 
a convincing set
of circumstances 
signalling your intention
to murder your husband 
but for two errors 
we must place blame
on your husband for the first 
if mr  kelmot had not blundered
into madame schirmer s
atelier   
and so taken me from my course  
 you wouldn t have had
 to loiter on the street
 for such a suspiciously long
 period of time  
 but you had no choice  
 so loiter you did  
i would also make
the observation
that there is nothing about you
that signifies the type of woman
who enjoys window shopping 
especially the window
of a taxidermist 
  was that the second error 
  no  merely confirmation
of the first 
the second was unavoidable 
and all the more damning 
the man at the station 
everything about him 
 his clothes 
 the patches on his trousers 
 his hands 
 scarred and burned with acid  
 announced his profession  
stonemason 
money must have been
a dire necessity 
else you would never have forged
your husband s signature 
the money was to pay
for the headstones
your husband would not allow 
for grace  for james 
for you 
was arranging things
to make it look
as if mr  kelmot
was the intended victim
simply to keep me off the trail 
  when i found the card   
i was furious 
that thomas
should know me so little
that he had need to employ a
detective to uncover the truth 
then it struck me 
if anyone could understand 
it would be you 
thomas thinks i m mad
because i speak to my children 
he doesn t understand 
the dead
are not so very far away 
they re just   
on the other side of the wall 
it s us  on this side 
who are  all of us so   
  alone 
i have been alone   
all my life 
but with the compensations
of the intellect 
  and is that enough 
  it can be 
if one is so fortunate
as to find a place in the world 
and another soul with whom
one s loneliness can reside 
  do you know a place where
two such souls might reside 
 it was an offer 
unlike any i had ever received  
 she wanted to share
 her solitude with me  
 it was only later i realised 
 how fateful
 my decision would be  
you have a husband
who loves you 
go home to him 
  mr  holmes   
you have my thanks 
  what more  madam  could i do 
 she had poured out 
 the contents of the bottle 
 and 
 with no malice aforethought  
poisoned the innocent witness  
 if it had been
 one of john s stories  
 he would have called it
 a foreshadowing  
our time together was fleeting  
 less than an hour  really  
 yet her death made me see 
that human nature was a mystery 
 that logic alone
 could not illuminate  
 i had successfully deduced 
 the facts of her case  
 but i had failed
 to grasp their meaning  
 never had i felt
 such an incomprehensible 
 emptiness within myself  
 only then did i begin
 to understand 
 how utterly alone
 i was in the world  
 mrs  hudson wrote to watson  
 he came at once  
 he stayed with me  in our
 old rooms  for a month more  
 i told him about the case  
 everything in great detail  
 he brought me back
 from the brink  
 and then watson
 wrote the story  
 he made me the hero  
 it was his way
 of bestowing a kindness  
 he knew no other manner
 in which to write
 the character he had created  
 after all those years  
 john didn t know me at all  
 why he took the glove
 i can only surmise  
 was it to prevent it becoming
 too powerful a reminder  
 to keep it from being
 a well of sadness
 to which i might return  
but he could not bring himself 
 to destroy it either  
 after that 
 john and i were estranged  
 three years later 
 he too was gone  
 without us ever
 having said goodbye  
 and thus concludes
 the true story 
 of a woman
 who died before her time  
and a man who  until recently  
 was certain
 he had outlived his  
roger with the bees 
  like as not 
  must tell him
something important 
you continue with
whatever it was you were doing 
  you might ask him
where the watering can s got to 
  ambulance 
yes  this is headly house 
 headly  
  yes  quickly 
and bring some supplies
of adrenaline 
  headly house  
  that s right  headly 
  roger 
roger 
roger 
oh  roger  oh  no 
no  no  no  no  no  no 
roger  oh  roger 
  mr  holmes 
it s inspector gilbert 
mr  holmes 
  yes  inspector 
  they re giving the boy
injections of adrenaline 
as you said to  but   
he s not looking good 
  he was fleeing his attackers 
his footprints 
their pattern shows that
his flight was disorientated 
the swarm must have followed him
in their attack 
and before
he lost consciousness 
his skin would have flushed 
accompanied by burning pain   
a drop in blood pressure 
weakness 
his throat and mouth
would be swollen
which explains
why he didn t call for help 
then a drop in heart rate   
inability to breathe   
shock 
  did you know
he was allergic to bees 
  i was certain he wasn t 
no  no  no  mrs  munro  no 
you mustn t do that 
  my son    won t wake 
he may never wake 
they sent me away till morning 
you didn t even have the decency
to tell me
what d happened to him 
  i didn t think
it would make a difference 
  i m his mother 
i m his mother   
and you stole him from me 
he s all i had 
and i ve lost him now 
why wasn t it you
they did it to 
it should ve been you 
  the bees were not to blame 
  they re all you care about 
  no  i care about roger 
i care about him very much 
the bees    didn t do it 
the bees were not to blame 
it was the wasps 
roger was trying to find out
what was killing the bees 
and he did 
he found the wasps  nest 
he had to stop them
wiping out the bees 
and so he did
the worst possible thing 
he tried to drown them
with water from his can 
  how do you know it was them 
  bees leave their stings 
wasps don t 
there were no stings left
in roger s face 
and when they attacked 
he dropped the watering can
and ran up to protect the bees 
there are his footprints from
the apiary to the nest and back 
  he was trying
to save the bees 
  yes 
yes 
there was a woman  once 
i knew her less than a day 
a quarter of an hour s
conversation 
she needed my help 
she needed so desperately
to be understood by someone   
me 
so  i laid out the particulars
of her case as i saw them   
to her satisfaction  i thought 
i watched her walk away 
and within hours
she d ended her life 
by identifying the cause of
her despair with such clarity 
i d given her carte blanche
to do just as she intended 
i should ve done
whatever it took to save her 
lie to her  make up a story 
take her by the hand
and hold her as she wept 
and said   come live with me 
let us be alone together  
but i was fearful 
selfish 
she s the reason   
i came here to my bees 
so that i couldn t harm
anyone ever again 
i m leaving you the house 
you and roger 
house  grounds  apiary 
everything within and without 
and as i shan t change my mind
on this point 
you will see  i trust 
that it will be greatly less
complicated for all concerned
if the two of you
don t go off   
   to somewhere like   
portsmouth 
  mrs  munro 
roger s awake 
  dear mr  umezaki 
 i write to tell you
 that i have at last 
 recalled my meeting
 with your father  
 a woman had died because
 i failed to solve her case  
 guilt and recrimination 
having taken their toll on me  
 my powers
 were far from at their best 
 when i received
 an urgent message 
 summoning me
 to the diogenes club 
 to meet
 with my brother mycroft  
  this gentleman has made
an offer of service 
he wishes to work for the crown 
  i m here to be tested 
mr  holmes 
i very much want to be of use  
do you think that i am suited 
  i m sure  sir 
  good 
there is one minor issue 
mr  umezaki
has a wife and child in japan 
he wonders
what would be the best course 
  write a letter saying
you plan to stay on in england 
could be a long while
until your return 
 your father went on to serve 
 the british empire
 for many years 
 in absolute secrecy and
with the greatest distinction  
from   
the malay    straits   
to the arabian sea 
 he was a man of courage 
heart and dignity 
 of whom a beloved wife
 and cherished son 
may be deservedly proud 
sherlock holmes 
hmmm 
my friend john 
my brother mycroft 
mrs  hudson 
masuo umezaki 
maya    umezaki 
ann 
and who is that one for 
  me  you 
  well  not yet awhile  surely 
  did you finish
what you had to do 
  yes  i did 
my first foray
into the world of fiction 
one shouldn t leave this life
without a sense of completion 
you can use this
in one of your stories 
a glass  a bee   
and roger 
  show me how to knock them out 
  go on
