useless worthless feelings
wish god id never even taken umezakis case
kelmots
kelmots case said umezaki
roger teas ready
best clear
mr holmes would like tea
mr holmes
die whatll happen bees
havent clue
one cant solve everything
said used call dead
death mourning grief
theyre commonplace
logic rare
dead far away
theyre side wall
whenever say
ply parlour tricks elsewhere mr holmes
husband could never succeed deception
long laundry
dont know much profession
doubt predicting
future women youre engaged follow
common practice
intended means
achieve desired result
delay actions
keep appointment
seem eager make
even glimpsed today
id gleaned passionate
feelings husband
man took away music loved
denied pleasures lessons
even refused even mark childs grave
predicted antipathy
witnessed actions
forging signature
drawing account
purchasing poison consulting
planning escape mystery man
paid handsome fee
benefit
convincing set circumstances
signalling intention murder husband
two errors
must place blame husband first
mr kelmot blundered
madame schirmers atelier
taken course
wouldnt loiter street
suspiciously long period time
choice loiter
would also make observation
nothing
signifies type woman enjoys window shopping
especially window taxidermist
second error
merely confirmation first
second unavoidable damning
man station
everything
clothes patches trousers
hands scarred burned acid
announced profession
stonemason
money must dire necessity
else would never forged husbands signature
money pay headstones
husband would allow
grace james

arranging things make look
mr kelmot intended victim
simply keep trail
found card furious
thomas know little
need employ detective uncover truth
struck
anyone could understand would
thomas thinks im mad speak children
doesnt understand
dead far away
theyre
side wall
us side us
alone
alone
life
compensations intellect
enough
one fortunate find place world
another soul ones loneliness reside
know place two souls might reside
offer unlike ever received
wanted share solitude
later realised
fateful decision would
husband loves
go home
mr holmes
thanks
madam could
poured contents bottle
malice aforethought
poisoned innocent witness
one johns stories
would called foreshadowing
time together fleeting
less hour really
yet death made see human nature mystery
logic alone could illuminate
successfully deduced facts case
failed grasp meaning
never felt
incomprehensible emptiness within
begin understand
utterly alone world
mrs hudson wrote watson
came
stayed old rooms month
told case everything great detail
brought back brink
watson wrote story
made hero
way bestowing kindness
knew manner
write character created
years john didnt know
took glove surmise
prevent becoming powerful reminder
keep well sadness
might return
could bring destroy either
john estranged
three years later gone
without us ever said goodbye
thus concludes true story
woman died time
