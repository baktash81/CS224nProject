to have a neighbor  
  just like you  
  i ve always wanted to live

hello  neighbor 
it s so good to see you again today 
did you see the    
what special thing i brought in to show you 
it s called a picture board 
because behind each one
of these little doors   
is a picture of people 
lady aberlin 
let s see who s behind this door 
here s king friday xiii 
with his crown and   
mustache and beard 
who s behind here 
oh  it s mr  mcfeely 
he always says   speedy delivery  
doesn t he 
i d like you to meet a new friend of mine 
his name is lloyd vogel 
someone has hurt my friend lloyd 
and not just on his face 
he is having a hard time forgiving
the person who hurt him 
do you     do you know what that means 
to forgive 
it s a decision we make   
to release a person   
from the feelings of anger we have at them 
it s strange  but sometimes   
it s hardest of all
to forgive someone we love 
let s say hello to my new friend  lloyd 
shall we 
  i never felt magic crazy as this  
  i never saw moons
knew the meaning of the sea  
  i never held emotion
in the palm of my hand  
  or felt sweet breezes
in the top of a tree  
  but now you re here  
  brighten my northern sky   
here to present this year s award
for feature writing   
   last year s winner  lloyd vogel 
thank you 
it s so wonderful to be among so many
of my fellow misfits tonight 
so   
why do we write for magazines for a living 
honestly  because doing anything else
doesn t seem quite like living at all 
we get a front row seat to history 
we get to expose the truth
that others cannot see 
and sometimes 
just sometimes 
we get to change a broken world
with our words 
mmm  thank you 
i needed this 
i ate a block of cheese for dinner 
  heh  heh 
  so  what are we forgetting 
you definitely need more diapers 
more than this 
we re going to jersey for one night 
we go through at least 12 a day 
  we do 
  mm hm 
what are you feeding that kid 
would it be easier
if we left him with a sitter 
i m not ready to leave him with a stranger 
okay  he s too little 
yeah 
  hey  your sister called last night 
  mm hm 
she wanted to make sure
you wrote your toast 
oh  i m all set 
i m gonna use my speech
from her first wedding 
  or maybe her second 
  oh  yeah 
  just change the names 
  yeah 
and she wanted me to tell you something 
okay 
your father s coming 
i guess she reached out to him
a couple months ago and he didn t respond 
but then he called 
and now he s coming to the wedding 
ohh 
are you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
but i don t think we should go 
  lloyd 
  what 
seriously  why have a baby if you can t
use him to get out of social obligations 
this is what lorraine was afraid of 
that you would back out 
i m kidding  i m not gonna miss her wedding 
i look forward to them every year 
okay 
i think it ll be nice
for gavin to meet his grandfather 
ha  ha

  how did that happen 
i invited him and he came 
to walk you down the aisle  really 
he offered  he missed the first two 
i thought   why the hell not  
i can think of a few reasons why 
he s old 
and if he s gonna try to make an effort   
oh  i guess it s time we get this started 
so  in lieu of the typical
father of the bride speech 
i thought i d  well   
i d like to sing a little ditty 
now  this one s for my lorraine 
and for you too 
what s his name again 
for todd

until you think you have the time  
  to spend an evening with me  
  and if we go someplace to dance  
  i know that there s a chance
you won t be leaving with me  
  then afterwards we drop
into a quiet little place  
  and have a drink or two  
admit it  now you wish we hadn t eloped 
he s drunk 
     by saying something stupid like  
yeah  well  he can sing

you re smart 
your mom and i hardly knew each other
when she got pregnant 
but we were babies  huh

  you didn t hear him 
  you were out of control 
he was out of control 
you re just not gonna take responsibility
for any of this 
of course i am  i offered
to pay for lorraine s dry cleaning 
have you ever felt the way lloyd does 
so angry you want to hurt someone 
or yourself 
i know i have 
when i was a boy  i was very chubby 
and the other kids would chase me
and call me names 
like fat freddy 
it made me very sad 
sometimes  when i was by myself 
i would cry 
and other times 
it made me very angry 
there is always something you can do
with the mad that you feel 
did you hear that 
someone is at my door 
let s go see who it is 
it s mr  mcfeely 
speedy delivery 
look  it s a magazine 
thank you 
magazines are always so full
of interesting information 
they sure are 
my friend lloyd works for a magazine 
he is a very wonderful writer 
that reminds me  i have a video i found 
and i thought you and your neighbor
may like to see it 
what is it 
it s about how people make a magazine 
it s called  how people make a magazine  
i know lots of people like magazines  so
i thought you might find this interesting 
i think we would 
do you have time to show it to us now 
well  i d be glad to see it again 
let s look at it on picture picture 
we ll watch it on picture picture   
and see how people make   
a magazine 
this is the ink they use in the
printing press that prints the magazines 
yellow ink 
it looks like mustard  heh  heh 
and these are large rolls of blank paper
that are getting loaded into the machine 
i wonder how many magazines they can make
out of one of those large rolls 
they print the magazines
in giant sheets  one color at a time 
this machine assembles the magazine
and glues it all together 
oh  now  who s this 
these are the people who decide
what will be in the magazine 
they pick the pictures
and design the layout 
oh  that s an importantjob 
and these are the people
who write the words that go into a magazine 
it s a lot of work
to make a magazine  isn t it 
it certainly is 
  yeah 
  pay no attention to my face 
softball injury  nothing to worry about

the way we d hoped 
mm 
how long have you been married  lloyd 
eight years 
eight year    oh  that s   
a wonderful accomplishment 
does your spouse have a name 
andrea 
i would like to meet andrea someday 
i m sure 
you ve lived in pittsburgh your whole life 
i grew up not too far from here
in a town called latrobe 
but we ve lived here quite some time
and we ve raised our boys here 
and do you think living here makes it easier
or more difficult to be a celebrity 
uh   celebrity   mercy 
you don t consider yourself famous 
 fame  is a four letter word 
like  tape  or  zoom  or  face  
what ultimately matters
is what we do with it 
and what are you doing with it 
we are trying to give children positive ways
to deal with their feelings 
this piece will be
for an issue about heroes 
do you consider yourself a hero 
i don t think of myself as a hero 
no  not at all 
what about mister rogers  is he a hero 
i don t understand the question 
well  there s you  fred 
and then there s the character you play 
mister rogers 
you said it was a play at the plate 
is that     is that what    
is that what happened to you 
what did happen to you  lloyd 
i got into a fight 
ohh  oh  my 
who did you get into a fight with 
it s not important 
jerry 
mm  and who is jerry 
my father

daniel isn t just a puppet 
daniel is fred  and fred is daniel 
  you mean

  let me know when you re ready  lady 
  okay  thank you 
and trolley 
action 
well  hello  lady aberlin 
hi  daniel 
are you making that funny smell 
do you mean that skunk kind of smell  no 
i m trying to help that smell go away 
by squirting another smell 
that s right  a sweet smelling smell 
  want to smell 
  okay 
  mmm 
  ahh 
  that does smell good 
  mm hm 
where did that bad smell come from 
mr  skunk 
he got scared 
and he just sprayed this smell all over me 
oh  no  did he say he was sorry 
no 
and that just makes me   
so very mad 
and i don t know what to do 
oh  daniel 
  what do you do
with the mad that you feel  
  when you feel so mad
you could bite   
  when the whole wide world
seems  oh  so wrong  
  and nothing you do seems very right  
  what do you do 
do you punch a bag   
  do you pound some clay or some dough   
  do you round up friends
for a game of tag  
  or see how fast you go   
  i can stop when i want to
can stop when i wish  
  can stop  stop  stop anytime  
  and what a good feeling
to feel like this  
  and know that the feeling is really mine  
    know that there s something deep inside
  know that there s something deep inside  
    that helps us become what we can
  that helps us become what we can  
    for a girl can be someday a woman
  for a girl can be someday a woman  
    and a boy can be someday a man
  and a boy can be someday a man   
thank you  lady aberlin 
thank you  daniel 
i    i feel better 
i m so glad 
i don t know if he s for real 
that s not for you to say  lloyd 
i think with a few more interviews   
  no  no  no  i told you 
this isn t an exposé  okay 
just put pen to paper 
a couple funny anecdotes 
keep it simple 
i can t do that  ellen 
he s a lot more complex than i thought 
he s a children s entertainer 
he s mister freaking rogers 
this isn t mikhail gorbachev
we re talking about 
i don t think you understand
what you re asking of me 
i m asking you to do your job 
now  get out and come back to me
when you have your first draft 
now   
this gives new meaning to boyz n the hood 
we ll be back with mister rogers 
we all grew up with you   
  hey 
  hi 
i see things going on out there 
kind of worries me 
i wish more people would   
how d it go 
he s just about the nicest person
i ve ever met 
when you say it 
it doesn t sound like a compliment 
there is    there s an attitude out there 
there s some things going on 
a lot of hopelessness 
what do we need to do 
there s no simple answers  of course 
but if we could 
through television programs 
as well as every other imaginable program 
let people know
that each one of us is precious 
it all starts in the home  we can
never underrate how important that is 
i don t think anybody can grow
unless he really is accepted
exactly as he is 
if somebody is always saying to a child 
 oh  you re    you re going to grow up
and you re    you re going to be fine  
there s so much of that
in this country already 
it s your turn 
  yeah 
  and so a child is appreciated
for what he will be and not for what he is 
 he will be a great consumer someday 
and so the quicker
we can get them out of the nest
so they can go out and buy 
then the better  
what do you think is the biggest mistakes
parents make in raising their children 
  not to remember their own childhood 
  yeah 
i think that the best thing
that we can do is to   
think about what it was like for us
and know what our children
are going through 
but you know what 
it s so hard once you get to be a parent 
you always say   i will never do this  
when your parents are doing it to you 
you say   i will never do this to my child  
and then you get to our age
and you forget what it was like
to be this size 
you really do forget 
well  but those children
can help re evoke what it was like 
that s why  when you re a parent 
you have a new chance to grow 
you do 
did you ever     i can t imagine   
i know that you are the father of two boys 
but i can t imagine you
ever having a problem with your children 
  you ever have any 
  well  of course 
i m a human being just like everybody else 
i thought you would just talk to them
and say 
 can you say   good morning   
and they would change  heh  heh 
but  you know 
a lot of people do those parodies  just   
  well  i left my happy home  
  to see what i could find out  
  i left my folk and friends  
  with the aim to clear my mind out  
  well i hit the rowdy road  
lloyd  hello 
i can stop  stop  stop anytime

so how does it feel
to be married to a living saint 
you know  i m not fond of that term 
if you think of him as a saint 
then his way of being is unattainable 
you know  he works at it all the time 
it s a practice 
he s not a perfect person 
he has a temper 
he chooses how he responds to that anger 
that must take a lot of effort 
well  yeah  he    he does things every day
that help to ground him 
read scripture  swims laps 
prays for people by name 
writes letters  hundreds of them

  it s a beautiful day in the neighborhood
a beautiful day for a neighbor  
  would you be mine 
could you be mine   
  it s a neighborly day in this beauty wood
a neighborly day for a beauty  
  would you be mine 
could you be mine   
  i have always wanted
to have a neighbor  
  just like you  
  i ve always wanted to live
in a neighborhood with you  
  so let s make the most
of this beautiful day  
  since we re together
we might as well say  
  would you be mine 
could you be mine   
  won t you be my neighbor   
  won t you please  
  please  won t you be my neighbor    
that was wonderful 
it seems like all these people line up
to tell you their problems 
isn t it wonderful 
such bravery 
well   
it seems like that would be
an incredible burden on you 
well  i m grateful
for you saying that  lloyd 
i m grateful for your compassion 
is it  a burden on you 
okay  let s assume it s a burden on you 
there    there is no normal life
that is free from pain 
how do you deal with it 
oh  well  there are many ways you can deal
with your feelings without hurting yourself
or anybody else 
yeah  like     like what 
well  you can pound a lump of clay   
or swim as fast as you can swim
or play the lowest keys on a piano
all at the same time 
do you ever talk to anyone
about the burden you carry 
would you like to meet
my special puppet friends
from the neighborhood of make believe 
they look like they ve seen better days 
well  they   
they ve been with me for quite a while 
you ever think about swapping them out 
getting new ones 
didn t you have a special friend
when you were very young  lloyd 
a special friend 
yeah  a special toy 
or a   
a stuffed animal that you loved very much 
even as it got ratty and worn out
and made you just love it all the more 
i don t know  i m sure i did 
can you tell me about your special friend 
think i had a rabbit 
did your rabbit have a name 
just  rabbit  
it was  old rabbit  
and who gave you old rabbit 
my mom 
she must love you very much 
that she did 
she    she died when i was young 
i m sure that if she saw you today 
the person you have become 
she would be proud of you 
i want to get back to my questions 
you wanted to meet my special friends
from the neighborhood of make believe 
no  i asked you about the burden you carry 
i am king friday xiii 
lloyd vogel  the journalist  i presume 
and here s daniel striped tiger 
now  sometimes daniel is too shy to talk 
but   
but that s okay  daniel 
have you met daniel 
not officially  no 
i d like to meet old rabbit 
i don t want to talk about old rabbit 
i got to say 
well  maybe lloyd
doesn t feel like talking today  daniel 
and    and that s okay 
can you put the puppet down  fred 
you stopped making the show
in the mid  70s for three years 
why d you quit 
well  at that point  i felt the program had
covered all the major facets of childhood 
and what brought you back  money 
boredom 
my sons had grown into teenagers
and we were struggling 
we all were  and   
i realized then that there was still
so much more to talk about 
i can t imagine it was easy   
growing up with you as a father 
until recently 
my oldest never told people about me 
he s very private and that s okay 
and my youngest son  he   
he genuinely tested me 
but  eventually  we found our way 
and now i m very proud of both of them 
but you are right  lloyd 
it couldn t have been easy on them 
thank you 
thank you for that perspective 
you re welcome 
is that not the answer you were hoping for 
being a parent
does not mean being a perfect parent 
you might be experiencing some of that now
with your son 
and   
i ve been thinking a lot
about you and your father 
did you work out your disagreement 
this is ridiculous 
  lloyd  where are you going 
  we re done  thanks  been a real pleasure 
mercy 
heh  heh  he s so quiet with you 
i m good with babies

dorothy and i have been together and in love
for 15 years 
he left as soon as mom got sick 
did you know that 
couldn t even wait for her to die 
she really didn t want me there 
because you were sleeping around
while she was dying 
i know 
i know it 
took me years to get myself together 
dorothy s why i m standing here 
she helped me grow the hell up 
you know what they tell you about people
when they re dying 
they tell you it s peaceful 
that they just slip away 
mom screamed    when she went 
did you know that 
she screamed until she passed out 
and then they came in and revived her 
and she went right back to it 
it was just me  lorraine and the nurses 
sign the paperwork  pack up the house 
put her in the ground

what are people like you 
i ve never met anyone like you
in my entire life 
broken people 
i don t think you are broken 
i know you are a man of conviction 
a person who knows the difference
between what is wrong and what is right 
try to remember
that your relationship with your father   
also helped to shape those parts 
he helped you become what you are 
would you do something with me  lloyd 
it s an exercise i like to do sometimes 
we ll just take a minute
and think about all the people
who loved us into being 
i    i can t do that 
they will come to you 
just one minute of silence 
thank you for doing that with me 
i feel so much better 
so the way i left   
was messed up 
  yes  i should have called you 
  you shouldn t have left 
the doctor came out to speak to you 
i didn t know what to tell her 
i really didn t know what to tell your dad 
and on top of that 
i tried to get a cab home 
of course  i couldn t get one 
so i had to take the train at midnight 
people were looking at me with gavin like   
someone was gonna call child services 
i know you re trying to apologize 
but that doesn t mean it gets to be easy 
okay  talk

listen 
i    i realize
i need to deal with my feelings 
when i m scared   
which i was in the hospital 
and i have been   
for a long time 
   i get really angry 
and i know it s a way of saying 
 i can t deal with this 
get away from me  
but that s not what i want 
it s actually the opposite of what i want 
you and gavin

yes  sir 
you certainly may 
lloyd  joanne adored your article  as did i 
andrea  are you feeling better
about day care 
a little 
maybe 
what  you re not the only one
who talks to fred 
mister rogers 
is it true you re a sharpshooter 
navy seal 
no  i m afraid not 
what the hell kind of insane question
was that 
i heard it 
andrea  where d you guys go
on your honeymoon 
well  we eloped in maui 
so we were kind of already on our honeymoon 
  i would ve gone 
  you weren t invited 
hey  lloyd  he s embarrassed by us 
i m kidding 
i know 
maybe we should do a family vacation 
what do you think about that  dad 
should we dip our toes in the ocean
together 
oh  that sounds so nice 
crash your honeymoon 
count me in 
if i m still here 
you know 
death is something
many of us are uncomfortable speaking about 
but to die is to be human 
and anything human is mentionable 
anything mentionable is manageable 
anything mentionable is manageable 
you got to send me a copy 
joanne will love this when she sees it 
it d be so much cooler if he was in this 
  thank you 
  thank you 
i should get going 
i ll walk you out 
i got these 
count on it 
thank you 
hey  what    
what did you say to jerry 
i asked him to pray for me 
i figure anyone who is going through
what he is going through
must be awfully close to god 
  lloyd 
  bill 
read the article 
and 
  sometimes people get sad  
  and they really do feel bad  
  but the very same people
who are sad sometimes  
  are the very same people
who are glad sometimes  
  it s funny  but it s true  
  it s the same  isn t it 
for me and     
  sometimes people are good  
  and they do just what they should  
  but the very same people
who are good sometimes  
  are the very same people
who are bad sometimes   
so maybe i could slow down for a few months 
what do you mean 
stay home with gavin 
let you go back to work
without having to worry about day care 
  i want to 
  really 
you 
gavin and i already discussed it 
we both agree 
i m so glad i had a chance to tell you
about my friend lloyd and his family 
i have a new picture of lloyd
with his family 
would you like to see it 
there they are 
that s a nice picture 
it gives me a good feeling
to see them all together like that 
i hope you know
that you made today a very special day
by just your being you 
there s no one in the whole world like you 
and i like you just the way you are 
  it s such a good feeling
to know you re alive  
  it s such a happy feeling
you re growing inside  
   i think i ll make a snappy new day   
  it s such a good feeling  
  a very good feeling
the feeling you know  
  that i ll be back
when the day is new  
  and i ll have more ideas for you  
  and you ll have things
you ll want to talk about  
  i will too   
see you next time 
and that s a cut

  you can make believe it happens  
  or pretend that something s true  
  you can wish or hope or contemplate  
  a thing you d like to do  
  but until you start to do it  
  you will never see it through  
   cause the make believe pretending  
  just won t do it for you  
  you ve got to do it  
  every little bit
you ve got to do it  
  do it  do it  do it  
  and when you re through  
  you can know who did it  
  for you did it  
  you did it  you did it  
  it s not easy to keep trying  
  but it s one good way to grow  
  it s not easy to keep learning  
  but i know that this is so  
  when you ve tried and learned
you re bigger than you were a day ago  
  it s not easy to keep trying
but it s one way to grow  
  you ve got to do it  
  every little bit  
  you ve got to do it
do it  do it  do it
