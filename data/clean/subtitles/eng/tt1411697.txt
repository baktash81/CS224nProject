that s two grand right there 
my mother in law s watching the kids 
now she s got this whole new thing
to hold over my head 
plus it takes five days to get there 
it s a 16 hour flight 
and it s beautiful when you get there 
  whatever  it s a hassle 
  it is kind of far 
lauren s been there a week
and she s still jet lagged 
it s where her parents are from 
it means a lot 
who gives a shit about her parents 
her dad hates you

come on  stu  it s killing him 
i don t care 
honestly  the two of you
were barely invited 
  oh

just  you know what  alan considers you
to be one of his best friends 
i consider alan to be insane 
stu  throw him a bone 
his dad pays
for everything he eats and breaks 
we should squeeze the old man
to cover the bachelor party 
that s good 
i m glad you brought that up 
because this is the bachelor party 
  what 
  what are you talking about

i m still putting the broken pieces
of my psyche back together 
and you know what the glue is 
lauren  and i m not doing anything
to screw that up 
  you wouldn t be with her if it wasn t for us 
  oh  this ll be good 
stu  think about it 
you ended up ditching melissa 
two years later 
you met your true soul mate 
you take vegas out of that equation 
you would have married a cunt 
it s okay  i m allowed to say it 
it s a bachelor party 
drink up  everybody

i ve been  uh  meaning to ask 
i noticed it s a fishing village 
is there a long john silver s
on the island

you too  okay 
all right 
thank you  teddy 
the hands of a brilliant musician   
and one day  a great surgeon 
i admit it 
when i first met stu  i was not quite sold 
he seemed unattractive 
he lacked intelligence and imagination 
he was missing that spark
you look for in a man 
but then i look into stu s eyes 
he reminded me of my sweet brother 
chaiyo 
for those who do not know   
chaiyo is learning disabled
and lives in a group home 
but chaiyo loves chok 
and that s when i realized   
stu is chok 
what s chok 
chok is soft white rice
in lukewarm water 
it has no taste 
we feed it to small baby
and very old people 
it is nourishment
that everyone can digest 
the world needs chok 
just as the world needs people like stu 
to my sweet daughter and stu 
congratulations 
  hear  hear 
  cheers  guys 
and now i believe that teddy
has something to say 
sit down  i got this 
sit down  boy 
that was  uh  a great speech  sir 
i like the comparisons between  uh 
stu and rice 
i ve also prepared a few words 
 hey  everybody  here are some fun facts 
the population in thailand
is 63 million people 
it is twice the size of wyoming

where our friend is 
brother han took a vow of silence

i got a dark side 
there s a demon in me 
it s true  he has semen in him 
i said  demon  
but you also have semen in you 
remember 
that s not relevant  but thank you  alan 
point is   
this demon takes me
to some pretty weird places 
and we lost teddy
for two days in bangkok

and back to find him 
we took on bangkok and we won 
and that s pretty fucking cool
if you ask me  right 
i love your daughter
and i m gonna marry her   
unless you have any problem with that 
  i m good 
  all right

it would actually mean a great deal
to both of us   
if we could just get
your motherfucking blessing 
hey  alan 
your head looks pretty cool shaved 
thanks  phil
