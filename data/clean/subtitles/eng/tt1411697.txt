he reminded me of my sweet brother
chaiyo
for those who do not know
chaiyo is learningdisabled
and lives in a group home
but chaiyo loves chok
and thats when i realized
stu is chok
whats chok
chok is soft white rice
in lukewarm water
it has no taste
we feed it to small baby
and very old people
it is nourishment
that everyone can digest
the world needs chok
just as the world needs people like stu
to my sweet daughter and stu
congratulations
