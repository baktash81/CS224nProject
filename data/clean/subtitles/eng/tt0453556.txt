in the sewers of new york 
named after the great
renaissance masters   
   and trained as ninjas 
they battled many creatures and foes
before defeating their archenemy   
    the shredder 
but now a greater evil is poised
to destroy their very brotherhood 
an evil born 3000 years ago 
it was in that time
that a warrior king named yoatl   
   ied a brotherhood that fought
side by side with one purpose 
to conquer all the kingdoms
of the world 
nothing could stand in their way   
   as they left a trail of destruction
behind them 
in his quest 
the warrior learned of a constellation   
   known as the stars of kikan 
every 3000 years 
the stars would align   
   opening a portal
to a world of unknown power 
he became immortal   
   but at a price 
his brotherhood was turned to stone 
and upon the portal s opening   
    1 3 monsters were released
into our world 
the warrior king was left
to eternally walk the earth   
   unable to die
or forget his horrible mistake 
and the monsters
that were unleashed   
   continue to plague mankind
to this very day 
monsters 
no

   for the continued protection
of your village

to look for me 
actually  i was already here
on business 
but then the local legend
started sounding familiar   
   so i decided to snoop around 
 what kind of business 
 ancient artifacts 
some tycoon with too much time
on his hands   
   has his heart set on a collection
of 3000 year old statues 
well  you always did run
with a strange crowd  april

happy birthday from cowabunga carl

i bruise easily 
hey  black and blue clashes with green 
dudes  hey  that s

what s raph doing 
no one really knows 
he just sleeps all day 
well  what s he do all night 
2802  2802  burglary in progress

time to punch in 
good work  boys  that was easier
than i thought it was gonna be 
hey  look  guys  i grabbed a toaster 
i love your work ethic  tommy 
it s an inspiration to us all 
what was that 
what s going on  guys 
what in the   
looks like it s just you and me  shaky 
take it easy  i m not gonna hurt you   
   much 
i love when they play hard to get 
the nightwatcher 
 he s doing our job for us again 
 tommy 
 keep your hands to yourself 
 hey  who s tickling me 
your training period ended a year ago 
and splinter says
you don t write anymore 
splinter sent me down here
to become a better leader 
i can t go back a failure 
besides  these people need me
more than my brothers do 
if master splinter were here   
   he would ask you 
 what is your heart telling you   
i don t know 
i just know something s missing 
your brothers need you  leo 
they re lost without you 
leo 
why skate a halfpipe
when you can skate a sewer pipe 
sewer s up  bra 
hey 
cowabunga 
dude  going down 
yeah 
here s mikey 
guys 
anyone 
hello 
whatever 
this place used to be fun 
and with rocketing interest rates 
that s bad news for homeowners   
   as the real estate market
continues its downward spiral 
coming up  the vigilante known
as nightwatcher strikes again 
now  i can  t say for sure 
but he was definitely an alien 
i think it s a disgrace  taking the law
into your own hands like that 
 leave it to the police 
 up next    
i remember how that used to feel 
busting up crime syndicates 
sure  they had a bunch of guns 
but they weren t like these guns 
why do you do this to yourself  mikey 
those glory days are over 
forget about them  get on with your life 
concentrate on your work 
yeah  yeah  spoken like a true has been 
well  look who woke up 
i suppose you think the nightwatcher
is some kind of hero 
beats sitting around doing nothing
while dirtbags run free 
i would love to know what it is
that you do that s so great 
we re contributing around here 
all you do is sleep 
yeah  i do nothing  you re right 
you got me all figured out 
i know that your attitude has been
a source of contention to this team 
you think fear is the best way
to accomplish things 
first of all  this team you speak of
doesn t exist anymore 
and second of all    
raphael 
enough 
i think i made my point 
that doesn t prove anything 
why couldn t you send him away
for training 
donatello  this home
has become like an empty shell 
each of your brothers
has strengths and weaknesses 
you must learn to be strong
when they are weak 
if you don t learn to recognize this   
   then all hope is lost for our family 
keep it coming 
hey  careful 
those aren t souvenirs 
sorry about that  ma am 
where are you  casey 
come on  come on  pick up 
don t do this to me again  not now 
casey can t come to the phone right now
because we re hardly working 
this better be good 
casey  i am standing on the dock with
a priceless statue and no delivery truck 
 so my question is  where are you 
 april 
hey  babe  i am so sorry 
i set the alarm clock  but    
it  s broken  the clock    
it  s bad enough that you   re
out every night playing vigilante   
    but we ve got a deadline to meet 
 i m sorry 
oh  wait  babe  real quick 
you left a message saying you found leo 
 i mean  is he there with you 
 no 
i found him  he s not coming back 
but didn t you tell him how weird things
have gotten with the turtles 
look  casey  we re gonna lose
the biggest client we have   
   if you don  t get down here 
all right  i m on my way 
please tell me we re getting paid
by the pound here 
is this place a museum or what 
 you ve never heard of winterscorp 
 that s what i m telling you 
they re into everything  real estate 
technology  pharmaceuticals  hair gel 
 i don t wear hair gel 
 really 
i m the caveman type  au naturel 
just make sure you don t
touch anything in here 
hey  i was born careful 
hope that wasn t expensive 
oh  wait   just   i m  
 oh  boy 
 please tell me that wasn t you 
 mr  winters 
 miss o neil 
all the pieces are coming together 
oh  my  this is my associate  casey 
 nice to meet you  kenny 
 boyfriend  it s casey 
 so you were successful 
 yes  the fourth general 
i want to ask you before i go   
   if i could take one last look 
i believe this is the one
they call general akeela 
it s actually  aguila  
but that was a good try 
these statues may appear
to be only stone   
   but they re like family to me 
i didn t choose them 
friends you can choose 
but never your family 
okay  then 
take care  mr  winters 
if you ve come to kill me 
could you make it fast 
i ve got a shareholders  meeting at 1 0 
i d rather miss it 
if we had come here to hurt you 
you d be hurting already 
the foot clan and l
have come to hear your offer 
well  it appears that today
is my lucky day 
i must warn you 
we do not come cheap 
does it look like
money is of any concern to me 
only time is of the essence  my dear 
since you re so rich and powerful   
   what is it we could possibly have
to offer you 
i need you to be my eyes and ears 
i have some friends coming to town   
   that i d like to roll out
the red carpet for 
greet them warmly
and bring them to me 
and how will we know these friends 
don t worry  they re impossible to miss 
and you keep them up  got that 
and don t let me catch you
calling the cops 
what  not again 
didn t i take care of you last week 
hey  oh  no  come on  now  wait 
i m very disappointed in you 
knucklehead 
guess night school s in session 
hope i m not disturbing class 
hey  nightwatcher 
need any teaching assistants 
oh  no  casey 
i got this one covered  pal 
thanks  but no  thanks 
you think you own these rooftops 
i happen to think you could use my help 
and i could use a sidekick 
you may have everyone else fooled 
but you haven t fooled me  raph 
yeah  well  guess what  pal 
now you  
hey  wait a minute 
how did you know it was me 
wasn t that hard  man 
you know  you look like a big  metal turtle 
it s that obvious  huh 
 i should ve stayed in law school 
 ain t that cute  he s trying to get away 
well  looks like i got a sidekick 
yeah  right  you re the sidekick 
 what  is it performance art  i don t get it 
 what was i supposed to do   
   sit around  wait for leo to come back
and save the day 
i mean  we haven t
heard word one from him   
   since splinter sent him away
on his little vacation 
you think these lowlifes take vacations
at the first sign of pressure 
no  the criminal element of this city
may be guilty of a lot of things   
   but being quitters ain t one of them 
you know  i don t even care
about leo anymore 
kind of hope he never comes back 
come on  aren t you being
a little hard on the guy 
i don t know  it s possible 
i guess if i could live anywhere
other than the city  i d go too 
but i could never leave this place 
i can t even sleep without the sound
of the subway rumbling over my head 
i guess it comes from growing up
with a houseful of brothers 
i m not trying to tell you what to do 
i m just saying that if it was my brother 
i d find a way to work it out 
but that s just me 
i got my own issues  you know 
like back at home  with april 
there s this whole thing
about settling down   
   that makes me miss the old times 
i don t know if i can be the grownup
she needs me to be 
good talk  raph 
arise  my brothers  arise  dear sister 
the stars of kikan align 
all ye generals 
wake from your stone slumber 
dude 
dude 
enter 
kneel  my son 
i return from my training  master 
i was so caught up in my own world 
i forgot about everyone else 
i m sorry i failed 
on the contrary  my son   
   now you are much stronger 
your strength is needed here now 
you owe me no apology 
but perhaps you should talk to raphael 
your absence has been
particularly difficult for him   
   though he ll never admit it 
i m certain things will be back to normal
in no time  master 
good  because until you can act as one 
you are forbidden to fight 
yes  sensei 
i have missed you  leonardo 
i ve missed you too  father 
raphael 
your brother is home 
 hey 
 hey 
welcome home 
yeah  thanks 
well  i m going to bed 
hey  leo s back 
better go say hello before he leaves again 
 what  leo 
 hey 
 hey 
 huh  leo 
 ls that really you 
 yeah 
 i m  like  dreaming  aren t l 
 no  mikey  you re not dreaming 
oh  good 
i have nightmares about birthday parties 
okay  leo  i ll bite 
what are we doing up here 
i told splinter
i d get this team in shape again 
hey  i ve been training  since you left 
my video game scores have  like  doubled 
right  and while you ve been
playing games  brother   
   nightwatcher s
come into the neighborhood   
   iike some kind of vigilante showboat 
but his days are done 
hey  you went awol  leo   
   and the nightwatcher
was the only guy to pick up the slack 
crime never took a break  you did 
i heard his bike turns into a plane or 
like  a jetpack 
hey  don  you re so smart 
why don t we have jetpacks 
that s good  mikey  i don t even
trust you with a driver s license 
have you seen
the way this guy behaves  
someone s cranky 
 okay  jungle boy  grab a vine 
 raph  wait 
splinter told us not to fight 
 jungle boy   good one 
all right  but remember 
we re only up here for training 
you know what i always say 
 train by doing  dude  
mikey  when have you ever said that 
you smell that 
it s like a monkey cage up here 
wow  good news is 
there s a bunch of foot ninjas   
   getting the snot kicked out of them 
bad news is  this thing
is gonna run out of bodies soon 
yeah  so 
you think we should help these guys 
i d rather enjoy the show 
what do you say  fearless leader 
 we re not  
 i say we stop talking 
come here  fuzzy wuzzy 
you 
i think we re getting off
on the wrong foot here 
 we re trying to help you 
 never 
team 
wait  the shredder s dead 
who are you working for 
hey  a little help  o fearless one 
that was too easy 
like i said  too easy 
bad dog 
look at me  found the elevator 
oh  my shoulder 
my spleen 
this place needed a skylight 
this is why we need jetpacks 
 okay  any more bright ideas 
 how about this 
when this is over 
i m totally calling the architect 
wait a minute  how did something
that big just disappear  it doesn t  
dude  it s the cops 
raph  raph 
oh  yeah  the turtles are back  dudes 
i give us a 1 0 for style 
an eight for skill   
   and a two for stealth 
what seems to be the problem 
the problem is that we were hired
to merely patrol the city   
   and report anything strange to you 
you never said anything about monsters 
now  i m sorry that your illustrious group
have been reduced to hired guns   
   but i believe we made a deal  karai 
and i expect you to honor it 
you do understand honor  don t you 
so how did we fare 
my  my  my  and what is your name 
were there any problems  general 
none  my lord 
then show these fools
how a true warrior acts 
keep them on schedule
in completing their task 
we do not need any help 
nevertheless  karai 
i trust my family more than i trust you 
you may be the eyes and ears 
but they are the muscle 
they will help you gather
the remaining 1 2 of these abominations   
   so we can finally see
our birthrights fulfilled 
it s going to be quite a party 
dudes  did anyone get the license plate
of that thing that hit us last night 
my head 
okay  that was just weird  i mean 
first the foot  then that hideous monster 
yeah  it looked like your mom  dude 
yeah  that would make her
your mom too  doofus 
yeah  whatever 
keep laughing 
last night was an embarrassment 
i ll tell you what s embarrassing 
you can t follow a single order 
oh  how cute 
you ve been back for five minutes   
   and now you re schooling us
on your master plan 
okay  so this is my fault now 
huh  raph 
i m the only one
that has to be responsible 
hey  you re the trained master  not me 
dudes  can it  here comes splinter 
good morning  my sons 
 good morning  sensei 
 sup 
every ninja s day should start
with a healthy breakfast 
it fills me with pride
to see you boys together again 
if anyone needs me 
i ll be watching my stories 
 hothead 
 splinter jr 
cody is going to break up with donna 
i just know it 
we interrupt the gilmore girls
for this special news report 
monsters loose in the city 
strange reports are coming in
about an incident   
   that sounds like something
out of science fiction 
boys 
leonardo 
i am most disappointed in you 
you are the eldest of your brothers 
i was counting on you to bring order
to the chaos of this family 
this is why i have forbidden
any surface activity 
we cannot return to the surface
to fight evil   
   if we continue to fight each other 
but master splinter 
how can i be expected to do so  
there are no excuses
when you are the leader  my student 
we have to go out
and find who s responsible for this 
there ain t no other solution 
save the brute vigilante junk
for that nightwatchman 
 nightwatcher 
 nightwatcher 
yeah  whatever 
i m going out 
witnesses say
there are holes in the floors   
   as if something or someone had just
blasted straight down through them   
   ieaving authorities
scratching their heads 
well  at least some people
care about justice these days 
hey  casey 
 raph 
 meet me on the roof  okay 
what is it 
the roof 
you know what the roof is  don t you 
pushy sidekick 
we ve gotten this image
in from an amateur cameraman   
   and i do stress  amateur   
casey  come look at this 
be safe 
what s this all about  raph 
we got bigger things to worry about
than criminals 
like what 
come on 
i think we lost it 
it s gotta be around here somewhere 
i don t think so 
what s going on  raph 
did i mention
we ran into a monster last night 
no  you kind of failed to tell me
about that one  buddy 
you do know i only have
a wooden bat  don t you 
the foot  i thought they were history 
and now we got walking statues 
you got a plan for those 
yeah  hey  those are a first for me too 
and who knows 
these guys might be friendly 
friendly 
wait a second  those statues look  
witnesses 
watch out 
i don t feel so good 
that can t be good 
that s just rude 
hey  wait up 
 raph 
 come here 
 what  you never heard of smoke pellets 
 warn me next time 
i got allergies 
come on 
that s the second mask this week 
they ll never find us in here 
stay with me  now 
we ll be out of here soon 
no 
and i thought girl scouts were pushy 
some people just can t take a hint 
this is the police  you on the roof 
put your hands behind your    
what is that  tommy  you see this 
yeah  you better run 
i gotta hand it to you  raph   
   you sure know how
to show a lady a good time 
raph 
oh  no 
i gotta get you someplace safe  pal 
my compliments to the chef 
anyone for dessert

 yes 
cowabunga carl party services 
cowabunga  dude 
 raph  s hurt  you need to get over here 
 slow down  april 
 what happened to raph 
 i don  t know  he s unconscious 
we ll be right there 
leo  you came back 
leo 
sorry the reunion
isn t under better circumstances 
nice pad  kids 
oh  hey  raph 
well  his vital signs seem to be okay 
pupil dilation is normal 
some sort of stone 
probably obsidian  i think 
well  is he gonna be all right 
you re still here 
go back to your jungle 
well  at least
his personality s still intact 
and there s an engraving on it 
looks south american 
that s your department  april 
would it help if i told you that those statues
you collected for winters   
   were shooting these things
at me and raph 
 the legend of yoatl   it can t be 
it was just a myth   
   a scary story the locals told kids
around a campfire 
whoa  what are you talking about 
they say 3000 years ago 
some great warrior   
   actually found a portal
to another dimension 
and when the portal opened   
   the energy from it
gave the warrior eternal life 
but it also turned his generals to stone 
what if this warrior
just kept living forever 
he would spend
the rest of his days in regret   
   spending all of his riches
and all of his power   
    to find a way
to revive his stone generals 
maybe  just maybe   
   he  s built a new empire 
but  hey  like i said  it  s just a myth 
if you ask me  guys 
this has winters  name written all over it 
 how do you figure that  donnie 
 yeah 
because this has winters  name
written all over it 
now i know who to thank
for this shot in the arm 
so where do we find this guy
and his stone jokers 
we re not going
until we get splinter s blessing 
you re gonna quote a rulebook to me
that you ain t been following for a year 
if you got something you wanna
get off your shell  now s the time 
but i m not gonna stand here
and debate splinter s orders with you 
fine  then  i quit 
hey  raph  don t do it  man 
sometimes just taking a breather
is the best thing to do 
whatever 
to picking up the pieces 
what is it 
two creatures remain  my lord 
well  by all means  then 
let s finish it 
and you will finally be free
of your stone prison 
but if the curse is broken 
we will no longer be immortal 
brother  do not question my command 
 here we go  now 
 so  what are we looking for 
well  according to these star charts 
the portal is set to open   
   directly over winters tower
in the next 24 hours 
so the legend is right 
three thousand years 
and when the portal opens 
we ll lose the city to monsters within hours 
within days  the country 
and within weeks  the world 
oh  so it s like halley s comet 
only monsters come out 
yes  i guess so 
i m smart 
i m okay 
why do we need raph  anyway 
it s his temper that always
jeopardizes all our missions 
okay  leo  whatever you say 
nobody was talking about him 
leonardo  this team
you are so eager to lead is incomplete 
you know what you must do 
yes  sensei 
generals  i think our brother
has plans to betray us 
the 1 3th monster must not be found

and soon enough   
   you lose sight of everything 
good night  dark prince 
raph 
what 
you are so smug  you know that 
you think the world revolves around you 
don t you 
we couldn t survive without
the mighty and powerful leonardo   
   to guide us through our problems 
well  i got a news flash for you 
we got along just fine without you 
oh  and this qualifies as  just fine  
dressing up like it s halloween every night 
risking the safety of our family 
i mean  come on  what were you thinking 
don t push it 
you can t leave and come back   
   expecting us to fall in line
like your little soldiers 
hey  i was training 
training to be a better leader  for you 
 why do you hate me for that 
 and whoever said i wanted to be led 
i m better off calling my own shots now 
get used to it 
you aren t ready 
you re impatient and hot tempered 
and more importantly 
i m better than you 
oh  you know something  big brother 
i d have to disagree with you
on that one 
don t do this  raph 
i m done taking orders 
not human   
   but clearly not the final monster 
yoatl won t know the difference 
by the time our brother discovers
this turtle is not the 1 3th monster   
   it will already be too late 
leo

i know why you chose him now 
i know that there s a reason
why he s the better son and i m not 
raphael  you always bear
the world s problems on your shoulders 
it is an admirable quality
when you are a protector of others 
but you must realize that while  at times 
you may not be my favorite student   
   it does not mean
that you are my least favorite son 
you are strong  passionate
and loyal to a fault 
these are the merits
of a great leader as well   
   but only when tempered
with compassion and humility 
but  master splinter

your time s run out  winters 
miss o neil 
i must have hit my head pretty hard 
i m seeing giant turtles 
we know what you re up to  winters 
we know about the portal   
   and we think that it s time
you sent all these monsters home 
i couldn t agree with you more 
it is time to put an end to the curse
that i have brought upon myself   
   and this world 
that s what this is about  miss o neil 
penance 
i must return all 1 3 beasts
or our curse will continue 
and that is a torment
i can no longer bear 
then you should be
put out of your misery 
i think we walked in
on a family feud  guys 
the time has come to reopen the portal
and rain destruction upon the earth 
nothing will stand in our way   
   when we have an army
at our command 
 my brothers  l  
 we are no brothers to you 
with one monster still free 
the curse will never be broken 
we shall finish what we began
all those years ago 
and we will finally have our victory 
join us  join us  foot clan 
swear your allegiance to us
and no harm will befall you 
the foot ninja is not without honor 
we work for winters  not you 
okay  what does that mean 
it means we re going to help you 
my ninja will find the last monster
and you will bring it back here 
hurry  we don t have much time 
hey  i got shotgun 
forget about them 
by the time they return 
the portal will already be closed   
   with you inside it 
i hate to see brothers fight like this 
unless it s together 
hate to rain on your parade  pal 
but we thought we d even the odds 
we re going to enjoy this 
if you please  they can defeat them 
they are a team 
let s hope so  because if not 
aguila will use the portal   
   to draw forth an army of evil
and the world will be lost 
more beasts 
let s send them back where they belong 
temper  temper 
come to daddy

you would think they would be
more concerned about the 1 3th monster 
boys  we must finish this now
