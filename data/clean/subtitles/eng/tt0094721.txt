and retrace our steps
you saved my
two hours
you wont believe what
thats how long you were gone
what is going on
i have to show you something
look
theres that
and theres that
handbook for the recently diseased
deceased
deceased
i dont know where it came from
look at the publisher
handbook for
the recently deceased press
you know what i dont think
we survived the crash
i hate this
can you give me the basics
this book isnt arranged that way
what do you want to know
why did you disappear
when you stepped off the porch
are we halfway to heaven
or to hell
how long will this last
i dont see anything
about heaven or hell
the book reads like stereo instructions
listen
geographical and temporal perimeters
functional perimeters vary from
manifestation to manifestation
this is going to take some time
damn sandworms
thirteen percent huh
i better find a job
lets see business section
what do we got here
the maitlands
cute couple
look nice and stupid too
i wish i had a better view
of the cemetery from here
i cant tell which is
the best placement for us
cabin fever
i cant clean properly
the vacuums in the garage
and we cant leave the house
where are the other dead people
why is it just you and me
maybe this is heaven
in heaven there wouldnt be dust
on everything
its jane
whats she doing here
i dont know
jane up here jane
she cant see you right
in the book rule number 2
the living usually wont see the dead
wont or cant
it just says wont
god this book is so stupid
i cant understand anything in it
barb honey
were dead
i dont think we have much
to worry about anymore
this is great
just what the doctor ordered
sorry maam
delia deetz welcome home

good sturdy country craftsmanship
look at that kitchen youll finally
be able to cook a decent meal
come have a look

well have to rip out the plumbing
other than that its perfect
just perfect
what do you think honey
delia hates it
i could live here

i dont mean my as in i bought it
i mean i made it
put it on the table
ten minutes
im already perfectly at ease
its perfect
help
its otho
otho why dont you
come in the front door
its bad luck
you left the city for me
i am so happy
of course you are
lets get one thing straight
were here to enjoy the country setting
not to trash the place
charles youre lucky
the yuppies are buying condos
so you can afford what im going
to have to do to this place
im here to relax and clip coupons
and damn it i mean to do it
then go do it quietly dear
and let otho and me think
is the rest of the house
as bad as this
is this a punishment
what are we going to do
were not completely helpless
ive been reading that book and theres
a word for people in our situation
ghosts
lets get this show on the road
were dealing with
negative entertainment potential
theres absolutely
no organic flow through
i noticed that too
its like a giant ant farm
what
i thought i saw something
you read my mind
i did
few clients are able to read my mind
theyre not open
to the experience
my god
we just have to pray the other closets
are bigger than this one
look
ozzie and harriet
what happened to these people
they died
look an indoor outhouse
viridian
viridian why do i know that name
bluegreen
hydrated chromic oxide
remember im schooled in chemistry
i was a hair analyst
what
briefly
deliver me from ll bean
i know what you two are up to
youre not going to get away with it
this is not working out
i will not stop living art
just because you need to relax
i will live with you
in this hellhole
but i must express myself if i cant
gut this house and make it my own
i will go insane
and i will take you with me
yeah well maybe the house
could use a little remodeling
but why dont you just leave
this room alone okay
ill get her
so
cover the wallpaper knock down a few
walls and this place might be livable
whats on the third floor
attic space
i forgot to lock
the attic door
did you feel something
when
you dont have a key
maybe charles does
i have a feeling theres something
very interesting behind this door
yeah ghosts of the people who died
in this house and they want us out
lets do them a favor
my god that was close
i cannot watch this
whats the good of being a ghost
if you cant frighten people away
honey

you dont know whats out there
i dont care

so lets try to make it a pleasant one
dont bait your mother
when we get settled well build you
a darkroom in the basement
my whole life is a darkroom
one big dark room
you were miserable in new york city
and youll be miserable in the sticks
at least someones life
hasnt been upheaved
im happy here those people in new york
dont know what theyre missing
we could become the summer art center
of new york
i could start sculpting again
im only truly happy when im sculpting
thats a very good idea
thatll be very timeconsuming
first the house
otho and i have great plans
we should keep it
the way it is
good idea
the furniture truck is coming we
must decide what goes and what stays
everything goes
along with whats in the attic
careful
tell me what you do and ill tell you
why my husband will fire you
isnt there an index
no nothing
whats this
do you know where thats going
did anyone tell you where
why are there only three sculptures
there were four sculptures

is death a problem and not the solution
unhappy with eternity
having difficulty adjusting
call betelgeuse
theres no number or instructions

i dont get it
straight back
why dont you take a break
for half an hour
put that down
what the hell are you doing

you dont have an appointment
we didnt know how to make one
appointment for what

help
already just bit the big one
two months ago and you want help
what does that have
to do with anything
youll use up all
your help vouchers d90s
you spend 125 years on earth
in that house
during which you get only 3 classone
d90 intercessions with juno
you probably havent read through
the manual completely yet
youll have to wait if you dont have
an appointment
an appointment with whom
for juno your caseworker
number 54000601 ferndock
want a cigarette
no thank you
im trying to cut down myself
adam is this what happens
when you die
this is what happens
when you die
that is what happens when he dies
and that is what happens when they die
its all very personal
ill tell you something
if i knew then what i know now
i wouldnt have had my little accident
maitland party of two
take the handbook
and go to the sixth door
oh we forgot our handbook
come on
all new arrivals
report to waiting room number eight
flight 409 is arriving
at gate three
how do i look
there are no mirrors on this side
you look fine
fine
thanks ive been feeling
a little flat
125 years i cant believe this
i cant believe
they didnt tell us
oh adam what is this
thats the lost souls room
a room for ghosts
that have been exorcised
poor devils
thats death for the dead
its all in the handbook
keep moving
five
this is the sixth door
boy this place
just gets weirder and weirder
were home
look at this place
everythings different
all our furnitures gone
how long do you suppose
we were waiting there
three months
id almost given up on you
i was about to leave
i do have other clients
are you juno our caseworker
yes
i evaluate individual cases
and determine
if help is needed deserved
and available
are you available
whats wrong
were very unhappy
what did you expect
youre dead
we want to get rid of the people here
we worked hard on this house
we probably wouldnt mind sharing
the house with people who were
more like you used to be
yes
but these people
things seem quiet here
you should thank god
you didnt die in italy
the deetzes
have you been studying the manual
we tried
the intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all
get them out yourselves
its your house
haunted houses
arent easy to come by
we dont quite get it
i heard
tore your faces off
its useless to pull off your heads
in front of people who cant see you
we should start simply
start simply
do what you know
use your talents practice
you should have been studying
those lessons since day one
ive got to go
what about that guy in the flyer
betel
dont even say his name
you dont want his help
we might
no you dont
he does not work well with others
what do you mean
i didnt want to bring it up
but rather than have you make
another mistake ill tell you
he was my assistant
but he was a troublemaker
he went out on his own
as a freelance bioexorcist
claimed he could get rid of the living
got into more trouble
i believe hes been sleazing
around your cemetery lately
the only way
he can be brought back
is by calling his name
three times
but i strongly suggest
that you remove
the deetzes yourselves
how do we contact you
if we need you again
oh adam
that guys in our cemetery
shes right we just keep this simple
we can do this
hey you come here
hungry
come on
hey come here
i got something good for you
come on over
well have a little bite
something to nosh
come here
help me
maxie havent i always made you money
thats the only real question
nobody made me money like you
you were a demon until your nerves went
its just that
winter river connecticut is
if youll forgive me nowhere
why would i want to invest that kind
of money in an old building
its way the hell up there
its not a building thats the beauty
the people dont know the value of their
property i can buy the whole town
then we own a whole town
full of nowhere
come and see
and bring sarah
all right charles
its just that i am kind of busy here
just a minute
listen enough of this talk
about visiting okay i gotta go
you take it easy up there
big fellow
goodbye
max wait wait
putz
lydia is connecticut so boring
i had maxie dean on the phone
dads found a way of making money
while i relax so would you scram
your mother will kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her 300 sheets
this is so corny is this what
weve been reduced to sheets
think of them as death shrouds
and the moaning is important
really moan
god how can he stand that woman
cut it out
im a child for gods sakes
i feel so stupid
its not stupid were ghosts
do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman
moan louder

in your own bedroom
ah no feet

hiding in the attic
were ghosts
what do you look like under there
arent you scared
im not scared of sheets
are you gross under there
are you night of the living dead
under there
like all bloody veins and pus
night of the what
living dead its a movie
if i had seen a ghost at your age
i would have been scared out of my wits
youre not gross
why are you wearing sheets
were practicing
you can see us without the sheets
of course i can see you
how can you see us
and nobody else can
i read through that
handbook for the recently deceased
it says live people ignore
the strange and unusual
i myself am strange and unusual
you look normal
you read our book
yes
you could follow it
yes why were you in delias bedroom
trying to scare your mother
stepmother
you cant scare her
shes sleeping with prince valium
you did this
you carved these houses and things
and this used to be your house
why do you want to scare everybody
we wanted to frighten you
so you would move out

my father bought this place
he never walks away from equity
why dont you leave
we havent left since the funeral
funeral

unless it will frighten them away
tell them we are horrible
desperate ghoulish creatures
who will stop at nothing
to get our house back

any tricks to prove im not dreaming
if you are real ghosts you better get
another routine because those sheets
they dont work

in this house

besides im not exposing
that little girl to that pervert
we did call him
and he seemed awfully pissed off
i dont care ive changed my mind
we can scare them off ourselves tonight
i have an idea
what you did with the place
is wonderful
not me them
so
do you like them
i hope it wasnt yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts
you know what they say about people
who commit suicide
in the afterlife
they become civil servants
otho i didnt realize
you were into the supernatural
of course you remember
after my stint
with the living theater
i was one of new yorks
leading paranormal researchers
until the bottom dropped out
in 72
paranormal is that what
theyre calling your kind these days
dont mind her shes still upset that
somebody dropped a house on her sister
well this looks really good
i saw some ghosts
its a private joke lydia and i share
its not a joke
yes it is just today she tried
to convince me this house is haunted
kids you know i love them
ghosts
in designer sheets no less
id like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends
who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us
may your buildings go condo
lydia favor us
about your ghosts
no i am sick of that subject
delia lighten up
i would rather talk about
thats cute delia
otho are you doing this
we did it
lets watch them scatter
any minute now theyll come
running out that door screaming
any minute now
its me lydia
they want you
to come downstairs
delia says you can wear
any sheets you want
it was like being
in an amusement park bam
i didnt know i could do the calypso
who has more fun than us
were dealing with tracy and hepburn
a very sophisticated pair
they even appear in sheets
charles why didnt you tell us
about this before
were not sure we want our secret out
everyone will want them for parties
people will pay big money for this
the enquirers offering 50000
for proof of life after death
this is it charles
you can get maxie dean up here now
you think so
sarah loves the supernatural
shell have him sprint up here
in his helicopter
if you can produce ghosts for her
i should remind you
that im delias agent
i have lost money on her work
for years
if anything happened here
i shall handle it
but not until
ive seen real proof
what about this table
what do you call what just happened
what money
dont you believe in my work
heres lydia
well
they dont want to come down
why not
i think they were trying to scare you
away and you didnt get scared
theyre dead
its a little late to be neurotic
all right
this was not a hallucination
this was real
we all experienced a superpowerful
paranormal experience and it was real
delia you are a flake
you have always been a flake
if you insist on frightening people
do it with your sculpture
drive carefully
im dead
where do they hide
the attic
the attics locked
theyre ghosts
they can do what they want
they do whatever they want
take us up there right now
fabulous otho fenlocks
locked door ghosts
probably committed suicide there
im enchanted
in there
they must live like animals
its locked how did they get in
open this door dead people
or well bust it down
and drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with
they didnt commit suicide
it doesnt matter
i can teach you something here
take the upper hand in all situations
or people dead or alive
will walk all over you
open up
where are they
these ghosts are nice people
i think we scared them away
so lets leave them alone all right
its the whole damn town
i have never been so embarrassed
have they gone for good
dad dont
mom lets just go
no ghosts here
come on if they are in here
i dont want to scare them away
were leaving now
you can go about your business
what are we doing

leading supernatural research center
amusement park ill do a presentation
lydia will bring the ghosts
i cant bring the ghosts

i heard you allowed yourselves
to be photographed
you let betelgeuse out
