he s got hair down
to his goddamn shoulders 
he says to me

  i took scissors to him so fast  
  see you later 
  this will be great 
  wouldn t you rather go to jamaica 
  no way  there s no place like home 
  look out for that  
perfect start to our vacation 
you ll feel better when you re dry 
that fire wasn t burning
when we left 
  how s your arm 
  i don t know  it feels frozen 
i ll make some coffee
and you get wood for the fire 
maybe we should take things
extra slow 
do you remember how
we got back up here 
i m going back to the bridge
and retrace our steps 
  you saved my  
  two hours 
  you won t believe   what 
  that s how long you were gone 
  what is going on 
  i have to show you something 
look 
there s that 
and there s that 
   handbook for the recently diseased  
  deceased 
deceased 
i don t know where it came from 
look at the publisher 
 handbook for
the recently deceased press  
you know what  i don t think
we survived the crash 
i hate this 
can you give me the basics 
this book isn t arranged that way 
what do you want to know 
why did you disappear
when you stepped off the porch 
are we halfway to heaven
or to hell 
how long will this last 
i don t see anything
about heaven or hell 
the book reads like stereo instructions 
listen 
 geographical and temporal perimeters 
 functional perimeters vary from
manifestation to manifestation  
this is going to take some time 
damn sandworms 
thirteen percent  huh 
i better find a job 
let s see  business section 
what do we got here 
the maitlands 
cute couple 
look nice and stupid  too 
i wish i had a better view
of the cemetery from here 
i can t tell which is
the best placement for us 
cabin fever 
i can t clean properly 
the vacuum s in the garage
and we can t leave the house 
where are the other dead people 
why is it just you and me 
maybe this is heaven 
in heaven there wouldn t be dust
on everything 
it s jane 
  what s she doing here 
  i don t know 
jane  up here  jane 
she can t see you  right 
in the book  rule number 2 
the living usually won t see the dead 
  won t or can t 
  it just says  won t  
god  this book is so stupid 
i can t understand anything in it 
barb  honey   
we re dead 
i don t think we have much
to worry about anymore 
this is great 
just what the doctor ordered 
sorry  ma am 
delia deetz  welcome home 
charles 
it s okay  there s no damage  see 
good  sturdy country craftsmanship 
look at that kitchen  you ll finally
be able to cook a decent meal 
come have a look 
a little gasoline  blowtorch 
no problem 
excuse me 
here we go 
we ll have to rip out the plumbing 
other than that  it s perfect 
just perfect 
  what do you think  honey 
  delia hates it 
i could live here 
careful  that s my sculpture 
i don t mean  my  as in  i bought it  
i mean i made it 
put it on the table 
ten minutes 
i m already perfectly at ease 
it s perfect 
help 
it s otho 
otho  why don t you
come in the front door 
it s bad luck 
you left the city for me 
i am so happy 
of course you are 
let s get one thing straight 
we re here to enjoy the country setting 
not to trash the place 
charles  you re lucky
the yuppies are buying condos   
so you can afford what i m going
to have to do to this place 
i m here to relax and clip coupons 
and  damn it  i mean to do it 
then go do it quietly  dear 
and let otho and me think 
is the rest of the house
as bad as this 
is this a punishment 
what are we going to do 
we re not completely helpless 
i ve been reading that book and there s
a word for people in our situation 
ghosts 
let s get this show on the road 
we re dealing with
negative entertainment potential 
there s absolutely
no organic flow through 
i noticed that  too 
it s like a giant ant farm 
  what 
  i thought i saw something 
you read my mind 
  i did 
  few clients are able to read my mind 
they re not open
to the experience 
my god 
we just have to pray the other closets
are bigger than this one 
look 
ozzie and harriet 
  what happened to these people 
  they died 
look  an indoor outhouse 
  viridian 
  viridian  why do i know that name 
blue green 
hydrated chromic oxide 
remember  i m schooled in chemistry 
i was a hair analyst 
  what 
  briefly 
deliver me from l l  bean 
i know what you two are up to 
  you re not going to get away with it 
  this is not working out 
i will not stop living art
just because you need to relax 
i will live with you
in this hellhole 
but i must express myself  if i can t
gut this house and make it my own   
i will go insane
and i will take you with me 
yeah  well  maybe the house
could use a little remodeling 
but why don t you just leave
this room alone  okay 
i ll get her 
so 
cover the wallpaper  knock down a few
walls and this place might be livable 
  what s on the third floor 
  attic space 
i forgot to lock
the attic door 
  did you feel something 
  when 
  you don t have a key 
  maybe charles does 
i have a feeling there s something
very interesting behind this door 
yeah  ghosts of the people who died
in this house  and they want us out 
let s do them a favor 
my god  that was close 
i cannot watch this 
what s the good of being a ghost
if you can t frighten people away 
  honey 
  no  i m not putting up with this 
  you don t know what s out there 
  i don t care 
  barbara 
  adam 
adam  help 
i m getting all yellow 
we re trapped in this house
with those people 
i can t believe we re eating cantonese 
is there no szechuan up here 
i plan to have a stroke
from the msg in this food 
this is our first meal in this house 
so let s try to make it a pleasant one 
don t bait your mother 
when we get settled  we ll build you
a darkroom in the basement 
my whole life is a darkroom 
one big dark room 
you were miserable in new york city 
and you ll be miserable in the sticks 
at least someone s life
hasn t been upheaved 
i m happy here  those people in new york
don t know what they re missing 
we could become the summer art center
of new york 
i could start sculpting again 
i m only truly happy when i m sculpting 
that s a very good idea 
that ll be very time consuming 
first the house 
otho and i have great plans 
we should keep it
the way it is 
good idea 
the furniture truck is coming  we
must decide what goes and what stays 
everything goes 
along with what s in the attic 
careful 
tell me what you do and i ll tell you
why my husband will fire you 
  isn t there an index 
  no  nothing 
what s this 
do you know where that s going 
did anyone tell you where  
why are there only three sculptures 
there were four sculptures 
where s the fourth sculpture 
what are you doing 
 betelgeuse  the bio exorcist 
troubled by the living 
 is death a problem and not the solution 
unhappy with eternity 
 having difficulty adjusting 
call betelgeuse  
there s no number or instructions 
nothing  the bio exorcist 
i don t get it 
straight back 
why don t you take a break
for half an hour 
  put that down 
  what the hell are you doing 
  listen to me 
  jesus 
why are you doing this to me 
this is my art and it is dangerous 
you think i want to die
like this 
that little girl saw us 
  nobody can see us 
  but she did 
  what happened to the previous owners 
  they drowned 
yes  they were family 
i was devastated 
  here  take that 
  is this the key to the attic 
that skeleton key will open any door 
give that to your father 
you might mention i single handedly
decorated that house 
if he needs any advice in that arena
have him come see me 
don t worry 
i locked the door 
having trouble with the living 
tired of having your home violated 
want to get rid of them
pesky living critters 
well  come on down and see me 
the afterlife s leading bio exorcist 
yes  sirree  i want to tell you 
i ll do anything 
i ll scare  em real bad 
i ll do anything to get your business 
hell  i ll possess myself
if i gotta 
yo  i got demons runnin 
all through me 
come on down and see it 
if you act now  you get a free
demon possession with every exorcism 
you can t beat that  can you 
bring the little partners  we ve got
plenty of snakes for them to play with 
say it once  say it twice 
third time s the charm  and remember  
i ll eat anything you want me to eat
swallow anything you want me to swallow
but come on down
i ll chew on a dog
we need some help  i read something
in this book about emergencies 
here it is 
 in case of emergency  draw a door  
draw a door  i don t know why
we keep looking in that stupid book 
maybe we should try
that beetle guy 
you didn t actually think
that would work  did you 
knock 3 times 
birdies 
  can t you see i m relaxing 
  i want to tell you what i saw 
what is the point of my coming here
if you people won t let me relax 
pumpkin  sweetheart   
go help your mother 
maybe you can relax in a haunted house 
but i can t 
hmm  nice building 
bad roof  good parking 
  adam 
  this way  honey 
you don t have an appointment 
  we didn t know how to make one 
  appointment for what 
  what do you want 
  help 
already  just bit the big one
two months ago and you want help 
what does that have
to do with anything 
you ll use up all
your help vouchers  d 90s 
you spend 125 years on earth
in that house   
during which you get only 3 class one
d 90 intercessions with juno 
you probably haven t read through
the manual completely yet 
you ll have to wait if you don t have
an appointment 
  an appointment with whom 
  for juno  your caseworker 
number 54 000 601  ferndock 
  want a cigarette 
  no  thank you 
i m trying to cut down myself 
adam  is this what happens
when you die 
this is what happens
when you die 
that is what happens when he dies 
and that is what happens when they die 
it s all very personal 
i ll tell you something 
if i knew then what i know now 
i wouldn t have had my little accident 
maitland  party of two 
take the handbook
and go to the sixth door 
oh  we forgot our handbook 
come on 
all new arrivals 
report to waiting room number eight 
flight 409 is arriving
at gate three 
how do i look 
there are no mirrors on this side 
  you look fine 
  fine 
thanks  i ve been feeling
a little flat 
125 years  i can t believe this 
i can t believe
they didn t tell us 
oh  adam  what is this 
that s the lost souls  room 
a room for ghosts
that have been exorcised 
poor devils 
that s death for the dead 
it s all in the handbook 
keep moving 
five 
this is the sixth door 
boy  this place
just gets weirder and weirder 
we re home 
look at this place 
everything s different 
all our furniture s gone 
how long do you suppose
we were waiting there 
three months 
i d almost given up on you 
i was about to leave 
i do have other clients 
  are you juno  our caseworker 
  yes 
i evaluate individual cases
and determine   
if help is needed  deserved
and available 
are you available 
  what s wrong 
  we re very unhappy 
what did you expect 
you re dead 
we want to get rid of the people here 
we worked hard on this house 
we probably wouldn t mind sharing
the house with people who were  
  more like you used to be 
  yes 
but these people 
things seem quiet here 
you should thank god
you didn t die in italy 
the deetzes 
  have you been studying the manual 
  we tried 
the intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all 
get them out yourselves 
it s your house 
haunted houses
aren t easy to come by 
  we don t quite get it 
  i heard 
tore your faces off 
it s useless to pull off your heads
in front of people who can t see you 
  we should start simply 
  start simply 
do what you know 
use your talents  practice 
you should have been studying
those lessons since day one 
i ve got to go 
what about that guy in the flyer 
betel  
don t even say his name 
you don t want his help 
we might 
no  you don t 
he does not work well with others 
what do you mean 
i didn t want to bring it up 
but rather than have you make
another mistake  i ll tell you 
he was my assistant 
but he was a troublemaker 
he went out on his own   
as a freelance bio exorcist 
claimed he could get rid of the living 
got into more trouble 
i believe he s been sleazing
around your cemetery lately 
the only way
he can be brought back   
is by calling his name
three times 
but i strongly suggest   
that you remove
the deetzes yourselves 
how do we contact you   
if we need you again 
oh  adam 
that guy s in our cemetery 
she s right  we just keep this simple 
we can do this 
hey  you  come here 
hungry 
come on 
hey  come here 
i got something good for you 
come on over 
we ll have a little bite 
something to nosh 
  come here 
  help me 
maxie  haven t i always made you money 
that s the only real question 
nobody made me money like you 
you were a demon until your nerves went 
it s just that   
winter river  connecticut  is 
if you ll forgive me  nowhere 
why would i want to invest that kind
of money in an old building 
  it s way the hell up there 
  it s not a building  that s the beauty 
the people don t know the value of their
property  i can buy the whole town 
then we own a whole town
full of nowhere 
come and see 
and bring sarah 
all right  charles 
it s just that i am kind of busy here 
just a minute 
listen  enough of this talk
about visiting  okay  i gotta go 
you take it easy up there 
big fellow 
  good bye 
  max  wait  wait 
putz 
lydia  is connecticut so boring 
i had maxie dean on the phone

while i relax  so would you scram 
your mother will kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her  300 sheets 
this is so corny  is this what
we ve been reduced to  sheets 
think of them as death shrouds 
and the moaning is important 
really moan 
god  how can he stand that woman 
cut it out 
i m a child  for god s sakes 
  i feel so stupid 
  it s not stupid  we re ghosts 
do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman 
moan louder 
oh  god 
sick  sexual perversion 
do that weird sexual stuff
in your own bedroom 
ah  no feet 
are you the guys
hiding in the attic 
we re ghosts 
  what do you look like under there 
  aren t you scared 
i m not scared of sheets 
are you gross under there 
are you night of the living dead
under there 
like all bloody veins and pus 
  night of the what 
  living dead  it s a movie 
if i had seen a ghost at your age 
i would have been scared out of my wits 
you re not gross 
why are you wearing sheets 
we re practicing 
  you can see us without the sheets 
  of course i can see you 
how can you see us
and nobody else can 
i read through that
handbook for the recently deceased 
it says   live people ignore
the strange and unusual  
i myself am strange and unusual 
you look normal 
  you read our book 
  yes 
  you could follow it 
  yes  why were you in delia s bedroom 
  trying to scare your mother 
  stepmother 
you can t scare her 
she s sleeping with prince valium 
you did this 
you carved these houses and things 
and this used to be your house 
why do you want to scare everybody 
we wanted to frighten you
so you would move out 
you don t know the deetzes 
my father bought this place 
he never walks away from equity 
  why don t you leave 
  we haven t left since the funeral 
funeral 
god  you guys really are dead 
this is amazing 
  i better go 
  wait 
  don t tell your parents we re here 
  unless it will frighten them away 
tell them we are horrible   
desperate ghoulish creatures
who will stop at nothing   
to get our house back 
what if this is a dream  can you do
any tricks to prove i m not dreaming 
if you are real ghosts  you better get
another routine because those sheets   
they don t work 
ghosts 
you re telling me we have ghosts
in this house 
those pictures are of ghosts

you re working with
a professional here 
nice fucking model 
we can do this stuff on our own 
besides  i m not exposing
that little girl to that pervert 
we did call him 
and he seemed awfully pissed off 
i don t care  i ve changed my mind 
we can scare them off ourselves tonight 
i have an idea 
what you did with the place
is wonderful 
not me  them 
so 
do you like them 
i hope it wasn t yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts 
you know what they say about people
who commit suicide 
in the afterlife 
they become civil servants 
otho  i didn t realize
you were into the supernatural 
of course  you remember 
after my stint
with the living theater   
i was one of new york s
leading paranormal researchers   
until the bottom dropped out
in  72 
paranormal  is that what
they re calling your kind these days 
don t mind her  she s still upset that
somebody dropped a house on her sister 
well  this looks really good 
i saw some ghosts 
  it s a private joke lydia and i share 
  it s not a joke 
yes  it is  just today she tried
to convince me this house is haunted 
kids  you know  i love them 
  ghosts 
  in designer sheets  no less 
i d like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends   
who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us 
may your buildings go condo 
lydia  favor us
about your ghosts 
no  i am sick of that subject 
delia  lighten up 
i would rather talk about  
that s cute  delia 
otho  are you doing this 
we did it 
let s watch them scatter 
any minute now they ll come
running out that door screaming 
any minute now 
it s me  lydia 
they want you
to come downstairs 
delia says you can wear
any sheets you want 
it was like being
in an amusement park  bam 
  i didn t know i could do the calypso 
  who has more fun than us 
we re dealing with tracy and hepburn 
a very sophisticated pair 
they even appear in sheets 
charles  why didn t you tell us
about this before 
we re not sure we want our secret out 
everyone will want them for parties 
people will pay big money for this 
the enquirer s offering  50 000
for proof of life after death 
this is it  charles 
you can get maxie dean up here now 
  you think so 
  sarah loves the supernatural 
she ll have him sprint up here
in his helicopter   
if you can produce ghosts for her 
i should remind you
that i m delia s agent 
i have lost money on her work
for years 
if anything happened here 
i shall handle it 
but not until
i ve seen real proof 
  what about this table 
  what do you call what just happened 
what money 
don t you believe in my work 
here s lydia 
  well 
  they don t want to come down 
why not 
i think they were trying to scare you
away  and you didn t get scared 
they re dead 
it s a little late to be neurotic 
all right 
this was not a hallucination 
this was real 
we all experienced a superpowerful
paranormal experience and it was real 
delia  you are a flake 
you have always been a flake 
if you insist on frightening people 
do it with your sculpture 
drive carefully 
  i m dead 
  where do they hide 
  the attic 
  the attic s locked 
they re ghosts 
they can do what they want 
they do whatever they want 
take us up there right now 
fabulous  otho fenlock s
 locked door ghosts  
probably committed suicide there 
  i m enchanted 
  in there 
  they must live like animals 
  it s locked  how did they get in 
open this door  dead people 
or we ll bust it down   
and drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with 
  they didn t commit suicide 
  it doesn t matter 
i can teach you something here 
take the upper hand in all situations   
or people  dead or alive 
will walk all over you 
open up 
where are they 
these ghosts are nice people 
i think we scared them away 
so let s leave them alone  all right 
it s the whole damn town
