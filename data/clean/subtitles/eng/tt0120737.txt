gandalfs death vain
would give hope
carry heavy burden frodo
dont carry weight dead
follow
cares galeton
heart elvendom earth
realm lord celeborn galadriel lady light
enemy knows entered
hope secrecy gone
eight yet nine set rivendell
tell gandalf
much desire speak
longer see afar
gandalf grey pass borders land
fallen shadow
taken shadow flame
balrog morgoth
went needlessly net moria
needless none deeds gandalf life
yet know full purpose
let great emptiness khazadd√ªm fill heart
gimli son gloin
world grown full peril
lands
love mingled grief
becomes fellowship
without gandalf hope lost
quest stands upon edge knife
stray little fail
ruin
yet hope remains company true
let hearts troubled go rest
weary sorrow much toil
tonight sleep
welcome frodo shire
one seen eye
lament gandalf
say
heart tell
grief still near
bet dont mention fireworks
verse
finest rockets ever seen
burst stars blue green
thunder silver showers
came falling like rain flowers
oh doesnt justice long road
take rest
borders wellprotected
find rest
heard voice inside head
spoke father fall gondor
said even hope left
see
long since hope
father noble man
rule failing
people lose faith
looks make things right would
would see glory gondor restored
ever seen aragorn
white tower ecthelion
glimmering like spike pearl silver
banners caught high morning breeze
ever called home
clear ringing silver trumpets
seen white city
long ago
one day paths lead us
tower guard shall take call
lords gondor returned
look mirror
see
even wisest tell
mirror
shows many things
things
things
things
yet come pass
know saw
also mind
come pass fail
fellowship breaking already begun
try take ring
know speak
one one destroy
ask
give one ring
offer freely
deny heart greatly desired
place dark lord would queen
dark beautiful terrible dawn
treacherous sea
stronger foundations earth
shall love
despair
pass test diminish
go west
remain galadriel alone
ringbearer frodo bear ring power
alone
nenya ring adamant
keeper
task appointed
find way
one
know must

im afraid
even smallest person change course future
know orcs first came
elves
taken dark powers
tortured mutilated
ruined terrible form life

perfected
fighting urukhai
serve
saruman
hunt stop found
know pain know fear
taste manflesh
one halflings carries something great value
bring alive unspoiled
kill others
never clad strangers garb people
may cloaks help shield unfriendly eyes
lembas
elvish waybread
one small bite enough fill stomach grown man
many eat
four
every league travel south danger increase
mordor orcs hold eastern shore anduin
find safety western bank
strange creatures bearing mark white hand seen borders
seldom orcs journey open sun yet done
le aphadar aen tracked
river chance outrunning enemy falls rauros
gift legolas bow galadhrim
worthy skill woodland kin
daggers noldorin
already seen service war
fear young peregrin took
find courage
samwise gamgee
elven rope made hithlain
thank lady

gift would dwarf ask elves
nothing
except look upon lady galadhrim one last time
fair jewels beneath earth
actually
one thing
couidnt quite impossible
stupid ask
nothing greater give
gift already bear
meleth d√Æn love
ant e guil arwen und√≥miel p√≠gatha fear grace arwen evenstar diminish
an√≠ron e broniatha ad ae periatham would leave shores
athar methid enamar hen people
an√≠ron e c√≠ratha na valannor would take ship valinor
choice yet
choice make aragorn
rise height fathers since days elendil
fall darkness left kin

dan √∫eveditham elessar shall meet elessar
farewell frodo baggins
give light earendil
beloved star

lights go
taken worst wound parting
looked last upon fairest
henceforth call nothing fair unless gift
