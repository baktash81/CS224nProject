i feel it in the water 
han mathon ne chae 
i feel it in the earth 
a han noston ned  wilith 
i smell it in the air 
much that once was   
   is lost 
for none now live who remember it 
the lord of the rings 
it began with the forging of the great rings 
three were given to the elves 
immortal  wisest and fairest of all beings 
seven to the dwarf lords 
great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls 
and nine   
   nine rings were gifted to the race of men   
   who  above all else  desire power 
for within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race 
but they were all of them deceived 
for another ring was made 
in the land of mordor 
in the fires of mount doom   
    the dark lord sauron forged
in secret a master ring   
    to control all others 
and into this ring he poured
his cruelty  his malice   
   and his will to dominate all life 
one ring to rule them all 
one by one   
    the free lands of middle earth
fell to the power of the ring 
but there were some who resisted 
a last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of mordor 
and on the slopes of mount doom  they
fought for the freedom of middle earth 
tangado haid   hold positions  
leithio i philinn   fire the arrows  
victory was near 
but the power of the ring   
   could not be undone 
it was in this moment   
    when all hope had faded   
    that isildur  son of the king 
took up his father s sword 
sauron  the enemy of the free peoples
of middle earth  was defeated 
the ring passed to isildur   
    who had this one chance to destroy evil forever 
but the hearts of men   
   are easily corrupted 
and the ring of power has a will of its own 
it betrayed isildur   
    to his death 
and some things
that should not have been forgotten   
   were lost 
history became legend   
   legend became myth 
and for two and a half thousand years   
    the ring passed out of all knowledge 
until  when chance came   
   it ensnared a new bearer 
my precious 
the ring came to the creature gollum   
    who took it deep into the tunnels
of the misty mountains 
and there it consumed him 
it came to me 
my own  my love  my own 
my precious 
the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life 
for 500 years it poisoned his mind 
and in the gloom of gollum s cave  it waited 
darkness crept back into the forests of the world 
rumor grew of a shadow in the east   
    whispers of a nameless fear 
and the ring of power perceived   
   its time had now come 
it abandoned gollum 
but something happened then
the ring did not intend 
it was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable 
what s this 
a hobbit 
bilbo baggins of the shire 
a ring 
lost 
my precious is lost 
for the time will soon come   
    when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all 
the 22nd day of september   
   in the year 1400   
   by shire reckoning 
bag end  bagshot row 
hobbiton  westfarthing   
   the shire   
   middle earth 
the third age of this world 
the fellowship of the ring 
there and back again 
a hobbit s tale 
by bilbo baggins 
now   
   where to begin 
ah  yes    
 concerning   
   hobbits  
hobbits have been living and farming
in the four farthings of the shire   
   for many hundreds of years   
   quite content to ignore and be ignored   
   by the world of the big folk 
middle earth being  after all 
full of strange creatures beyond count   
   hobbits must seem of little importance   
   being neither renowned as great warriors   
   nor counted among the very wise 
frodo  someone at the door 
in fact  it has been remarked by some   
    that hobbits  only real passion is for food 
a rather unfair observation   
   as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales   
   and the smoking of pipe weed 
but where our hearts truly lie   
   is in peace and quiet   
   and good  tilled earth 
for all hobbits share a love of things that grow 
and yes  no doubt to others our ways seem quaint 
but today of all days 
it is brought home to me   
it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life 
frodo  the door 
sticklebacks  where is that boy 
frodo 
down from the door where it began
and i must follow if i can
the road goes ever on and on
down from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone
and i must follow if i can
  you re late 
a wizard is never late  frodo baggins 
nor is he early 
he arrives precisely when he means to 
it s wonderful to see you  gandalf 
you didn t think i d miss
your uncle bilbo s birthday 
how is the old rascal 
i hear it s going to be a party
of special magnificence 
you know bilbo 
he s got the whole piece in an uproar 
well  that should please him 
half the shire s been invited 
and the rest of them are turning up anyway 
and so life in the shire goes on   
    very much as it has this past age 
full of its own comings and goings 
with change coming slowly 
if it comes at all 
for things are made to endure in the shire   
   passing from one generation to the next 
there s always been a baggins
living here under the hill   
   in bag end 
and there always will be 
to tell you the truth 
bilbo s been a bit odd lateiy 
i mean  more than usual 
he s taken to locking himself in his study 
he spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks i m not looking 
where s it gone 
he s up to something 
  all right  then  keep your secrets 
  what 
but i know you have something to do with it 
good gracious me 
before you came along  we bagginses
were very well thought of 
indeed 
never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected 
if you re referring to the incident with the dragon 
i was barely involved 
all i did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door 
whatever you did  you ve been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace 
oh  really 
gandalf  gandalf 
fireworks  gandalf 
  gandalf 
  fireworks  gandalf 
gandalf 
  i m glad you re back 
  so am i  dear boy 
so am i 
no  thank you 
we don t want any more visitors 
well wishers or distant relations 
and what about very old friends 
gandalf 
  bilbo baggins 
  my dear gandalf 
good to see you  111 years old 
who would believe it 
you haven t aged a day 
come on  come in 
welcome  welcome 
oh  here we are 
tea   or maybe something a littie stronger 
i ve got a few bottles of the old winyard left   1296 
very good year  almost as old as i am 
it was laid down by my father 
what say we open one  eh 
just tea  thank you 
i was expecting you sometime last week 
not that it matters  you come and go as
you please  always have and always will 
you caught me a bit unprepared i m afraid 
we ve only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle    
there s some cheese here 
no  that won t do 
we ve got raspberry jam  an apple tart    
but not much for afters 
oh  no  we re all right 
i ve just found some sponge cake 
i could make you some eggs if you d li   
  just tea  thank you 
  oh  right 
  you don t mind if i eat  do you 
  no  not at all 
bilbo  bilbo baggins 
i m not at home 
it s the sackville bagginses 
  i know you re in there 
  they re after the house 
they ve never forgiven me for living this long 
i ve got to get away from these confounded
relatives  hanging on the bell all day   
   never giving me a moment s peace 
i want to see mountains again 
mountains  gandalf 
and then find somewhere quiet
where i can finish my book  oh  tea 
  so you mean to go through with your plan 
  yes  yes  it s all in hand 
all the arrangements are made 
oh  thank you 
frodo suspects something 
of course he does  he s a baggins   
   not some blockheaded bracegirdle
from hardbottle 
you will tell him  won t you 
  yes  yes 
  he s very fond of you 
i know 
he d probably come with me if i asked him 
i think in his heart  frodo s
still in love with the shire 
the woods  the fields 
little rivers 
i am old  gandalf 
i know i don t look it  but i m
beginning to feel it in my heart 
i feel thin 
sort of stretched   
   like butter scraped over too much bread 
i need a holiday  a very long holiday 
and i don t expect i shall return 
in fact  i mean not to 
old toby 
the finest weed in the southfarthing 
gandalf  my old friend   
   this will be a night to remember 
hello  hello 
fatty bolger  lovely to see you 
welcome  welcome 
go on  sam  ask rosie for a dance 
  i think i ll just have another ale 
  oh  no  you don t 
go on 
so there i was   
   at the mercy of three monstrous trolls 
and they were all arguing amongst themselves   
   about how they were going to cook us 
whether it be turned on a spit  or to sit
on us one by one  squash us into jelly 
they spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors   
   that the sun s first light
crept over the top of the trees   
   and turned them all to stone 
quickly 
up they go 
no no  the big one   big one
mrs  bracegirdle  how nice to see you 
welcome  welcome 
are all these children yours 
good gracious  you have been productive 
bilbo 
sackville bagginses 
quickly  hide 
thank you  my boy 
you re a good lad  frodo 
i m very selfish  you know 
yes  i am  very selfish 
i don t know why i took you in after
your mother and father died   
   but it wasn t out of charity 
i think it was because   
   of all my numerous relations   
   you were the one baggins that showed real spirit 
bilbo  have you been at the gaffer s home brew 
no 
well  yes  but that s not the point 
the point is  frodo   
   you ll be all right 
  done 
  you re supposed to stick it in the ground 
  it is in the ground 
  outside 
this was your idea 
bilbo 
bilbo  watch out for the dragon 
nonsense  there hasn t been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years 
  that was good 
  let s get another one 
meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took 
i might ve known 
speech  bilbo 
speech 
speech 
my dear bagginses and boffins   
   tooks and brandybucks   
   grubbs  chubbs   
   hornblowers   
   bolgers   
   bracegirdles   
   and proudfoots 
  proudfeet 
today is my 111th birthday 
happy birthday 
but alas  eleventh one years is
far too short a time to live among   
   such excellent and admirable hobbits 
i don t know half of you
half as well as i should like   
   and i like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve 
i have things to do 
i ve put this off for far too long 
i regret to announce this is the end 
i m going now 
i bid you all a very fond farewell 
goodbye 
i suppose you think that was terribly clever 
come on  gandalf 
did you see their faces 
there are many magic rings in
this world  bilbo baggins   
   and none of them should be used lightly 
it was just a bit of fun 
oh  you re probably right  as usual 
  you will keep an eye on frodo  won t you 
  two eyes 
as often as i can spare them 
  i m leaving everything to him 
  what about this ring of yours 
  is that staying too 
  yes  yes 
it s in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece 
no  wait  it s   
   here in my pocket 
isn t that    isn t that odd  now 
yet  after all  why not 
  why shouldn t i keep it 
  i think you should leave the ring behind 
is that so hard 
well  no 
and yes 
now it comes to it 
i don t feel l ike parting with it 
it s mine  i found it  it came to me 
  there s no need to get angry 
  well  if i m angry  it s your fault 
it s mine 
my own 
  my precious 
  precious 
it s been called that before  but not by you 
what business is it of yours
what i do with my own things 
i think you ve had that ring quite long enough 
  you want it for yourself 
  bilbo baggins 
do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks 
i am not trying to rob you 
i m trying to help you 
all your long years  we ve been friends 
trust me as you once did 
let it go 
you re right  gandalf 
the ring must go to frodo 
it s late  the road is long 
yes  it is time 
bilbo  the ring is still in your pocket 
i ve thought up an ending for my book 
 and he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days  
and i m sure you will  my dear friend 
goodbye  gandalf 
goodbye  dear bilbo 
the road goes ever on and on   
until our next meeting 
it s mine  my own 
my precious 
riddles in the dark 
bilbo 
bilbo 
my precious 
precious 
he s gone  hasn t he 
he talked for so long about leaving   
   i didn t think he d really do it 
gandalf 
bilbo s ring 
he s gone to stay with the elves 
he s left you bag end 
along with all his possessions 
the ring is yours now 
  put it somewhere out of sight 
  where are you going 
  there are some things that i must see to 
  what things 
  questions  questions that need answering 
  you ve only just arrived 
i don t understand 
neither do i 
keep it secret 
keep it safe 
shire 
baggins 
 the year 3434 of the second age 
here follows the account of isildur 
high king of gondor   
   and the finding of the ring of power  
 it has come to me 
the one ring 
it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom 
all those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate   
   for i will risk no hurt to the ring 
it is precious to me   
   though i buy it with great pain 
the markings upon the band begin to fade 
the writing  which at first was as clear
as red flame  has all but disappeared 
a secret now that only fire can tell  
shire   
   baggins 
there s no bagginses around here 
they re all up in hobbiton 
that way 
 hey ho to the dock i go
to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow
but there still be   
   many miles to go
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
and the stream that falls from hill to plain
better than rain or rippling brook
is a mug of beer inside this took  
there s been some strange folk crossing the shire 
dwarves and others of a less than savory nature 
war is brewing 
the mountains are fair teeming with goblins 
far off tales and children s stories  that s all that is 
you re beginning to sound like that old
bilbo baggins  cracked  he was 
young mr  frodo here  he s cracking 
and proud of it 
  cheers  gaffer 
  aye  cheers 
weel it s none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders 
keep your nose out of trouble 
and no trouble ll come to you 
  good night  lads 
  good night 
good night  sweet maiden of the golden ale 
mind who you re sweet taking 
don t worry  sam 
rosie knows an idiot when she sees one 
does she 
  good night  sam 
  good night  mr  frodo 
is it secret  is it safe 
what are you doing 
hold out your hand  frodo 
it s quite cool 
what can you see 
can you see anything 
nothing 
there s nothing 
wait 
there are markings 
it s some form of elvish 
i can t read it 
there are few who can 
the language is that of mordor 
which i will not utter here 
mordor 
in the common tongue  it says 
 one ring to rule them all   
   one ring to find them   
   one ring to bring them all   
   and in the darkness bind them  
this is the one ring   
   forged by the dark lord sauron
in the fires of mount doom 
taken by isiidur from the hand of sauron himself 
bilbo found it 
  in gollum s cave 
  yes 
for 60 years  the ring lay quiet in bilbo s keeping   
   prolonging his life  delaying old age 
but no longer  frodo 
evil is stirring in mordor 
the ring has awoken 
it s heard its master s call 
but he was destroyed 
sauron was destroyed 
no  frodo 
the spirit of sauron endured 
his life force is bound to the ring 
and the ring survived 
sauron has returned 
his orcs have multiplied 
his fortress at barad dûr
is rebuilt in the land of mordor 
sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness 
he is seeking it 
seeking it   all his thought is bent on it 
for the ring yearns above all else   
   to return to the hand of its master 
they are one   
   the ring and the dark lord 
frodo   
   he must never find it 
all right 
we put it away  we keep it hidden 
we never speak of it again 
no one knows it s here  do they 
do they  gandalf 
there is one other who knew
that bilbo had the ring 
i looked everywhere for the creature gollum 
but the enemy found him first 
i don t know how long they tortured him 
but amidst the endless screams and
inane babble  they discerned two words 
shire 
baggins 
shire 
baggins 
but that would lead them here 
who goes there 
take it  gandalf 
  take it 
  no  frodo 
  you must take it 
  you cannot offer me this ring 
  i m giving it to you 
  don t tempt me  frodo 
i dare not take it 
not even to keep it safe 
understand  frodo   
   i would use this ring from a desire to do good 
but through me  it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine 
  but it cannot stay in the shire 
  no 
no  it can t 
what must i do 
  you must leave  and leave quickly 
  where  where do i go 
get out of the shire 
make for the village of bree 
bree 
  what about you 
  i ll be waiting for you   
   at the inn of the prancing pony 
  and the ring will be safe there 
  i don t know  frodo 
i don t have any answers 
i must see the head of my order 
he is both wise and powerful  trust me  frodo 
he ll know what to do 
you ll have to leave the name
of baggins behind you 
that name is not safe outside the shire 
travel only by day 
and stay off the road 
i can cut across country easily enough 
my dear frodo 
hobbits really are amazing creatures 
you can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month 
and yet  after a hundred years   
   they can still surprise you 
get down 
confound it all  samwise gamgee 
have you been eavesdropping 
i haven t been dropping no eaves  honest 
i was just cutting the grass under
the window there   if you follow me 
a little late for trimming the verge  don t you think 
  i heard raised voices 
  what did you hear  speak 
nothing important 
that is  i heard a good deal
about a ring  and a dark lord   
   and something about the end of the world but   
please  mr  gandalf  sir  don t hurt me 
don t turn me into anything unnatural 
no 
perhaps not 
i ve thought of a better use for you 
come along  samwise  keep up 
be careful  both of you 
the enemy has many spies in his service 
birds  beasts 
is it safe 
never put it on   
   for the agents of the dark lord
will be drawn to its power 
always remember  frodo   
   the ring is trying to get back to its master 
it wants to be found 
this is it 
this is what 
if i take one more step   
   it ll be the farthest away
from home i ve ever been 
come on  sam 
remember what bilbo used to say 
   it s a dangerous business  frodo  
   going out your door 
you step onto the road 
and if you don t keep your feet   
    there s no knowing where
you might be swept off to  
sam 
wood elves 
they re going to the harbor
beyond the white towers 
to the grey havens 
they re leaving middle earth 
never to return 
i don t know why   
   it makes me sad 
everywhere i lie there s a dirty
great root sticking into my back 
just shut your eyes   
   and imagine you re back in your own bed   
   with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow 
it s not working  mr  frodo 
i m never going to be able to sleep out here 
me neither  sam 
smoke rises from the mountain of doom 
the hour grows late 
and gandalf the grey rides to isengard   
   seeking my counsel 
for that is why you have come  is it not 
my old friend 
saruman 
  you are sure of this 
  beyond any doubt 
so the ring of power has been found 
all these long years  it was in the shire 
  under my very nose 
  yet you did not have the wit to see it 
your love of the halfling s leaf
has clearly slowed your mind 
but we still have time 
time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly 
time 
what time do you think we have 
sauron has regained much of his former strength 
he cannot yet take physical form   
   but his spirit has lost none of its potency 
concealed within his fortress 
the lord of mordor sees all 
his gaze pierces cloud  shadow  earth and flesh 
you know of what i speak  gandalf 
a great eye  lidless  wreathed in flame 
the eye of sauron 
he is gathering all evil to him 
very soon  he ll have summoned an army   
   great enough for an assault upon middle earth 
you know this 
how 
i have seen it 
a palantir is a dangerous tool  saruman 
why 
why should we fear to use it 
they are not all accounted for 
the lost seeing stones 
we do not know who else may be watching 
the hour is later than you think 
sauron s forces are already moving 
the nine have left minas morgul 
the nine 
they crossed the river isen on midsummer s eve   
   disguised as riders in black 
  they ve reached the shire 
  they will find the ring 
and kill the one who carries it 
frodo 
you did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of sauron 
there are none who can 
against the power of mordor   
   there can be no victory 
we must join with him  gandalf 
we must join with sauron 
it would be wise  my friend 
tell me   
   friend   
   when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness 
i gave you the chance of   
   aiding me willingly   
   but you have elected the way of pain 
mr  frodo 
frodo  frodo 
  i thought i d lost you 
  what are you taking about 
  it s just something gandalf said 
  what did he say 
 don t you lose him  samwise gamgee  
and i don t mean to 
sam  we re still in the shire 
what could possibly happen 
frodo 
  merry  it s frodo baggins 
  hello  frodo

you ve been into farmer maggot s crop 
you get back here

and some cabbages 
and those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week 
  and then the mushrooms the week before 
  yes  pippin  my point is   
   he s clearly overreacting 
run 
oh  that was close 
i think i ve broken something

a short cut 
  short cut to what 
  mushrooms

he s my second cousin 
once removed on his mother s side   
   and my third cousin  twice removed    
  pippin 
  steady on  frodo 
you cannot hide 
i see you 
there is no life   
   in the void 
only   
   death 
you draw far too much attention
to yourself   mr  underhill  
what do you want 
a little more caution from you 
that is no trinket you carry 
  i carry nothing 
  indeed 
i can avoid being seen if i wish   
   but to disappear entirely  that is a rare gift 
  who are you 
  are you frightened 
yes 
not nearly frightened enough 
i know what hunts you 
let him go 
or i ll have you  longshanks 
you have a stout heart  little hobbit 
but that will not save you 
you can no longer wait for the wizard  frodo 
they re coming 
what are they 
they were once men 
great kings of men 
then sauron the deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power 
blinded by their greed 
they took them without question 
one by one  falling into darkness 
now they are slaves to his will 
they are the nazgûl 
ringwraiths  neither living nor dead 
at all times they feel   
    the presence of the ring   
   drawn to the power of the one 
they will never stop hunting you 
  where are you taking us 
  into the wild 
how can we know this strider
is a friend of gandalf 
i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer   
   and feel fouler 
  he s foul enough 
we have no choice but to trust him 
  but where is he leading us 
  to rivendell  master gamgee 
  to the house of elrond 
  did you hear that  rivendell 
we re going to see the elves 
  gentlemen  we do not stop till nightfall 
  what about breakfast

lasto beth nîn  tolo dan na ngalad 
 hear my voice   come back to the light  
  where am i 
  you are in the house of elrond 
and it is 10 o clock in the morning
on october 24th  if you want to know 
  gandalf 
  yes  i m here 
and you re lucky to be here too 
a few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid 
but you have some strength in you 
my dear hobbit 
what happened  gandalf 
  why didn t you meet us 
  i am sorry  frodo 
i was delayed 
a friendship with saruman
is not lightly thrown aside 
one ill turn deserves another  it is over 
embrace the power of the ring   
   or embrace your own destruction 
there is only one lord of the ring 
only one who can bend it to his will 
and he does not share power 
so you have chosen   death 
gandalf  what is it 
nothing  frodo 
frodo 
  sam 
  bless you  you re awake 
sam has hardly left your side 
we were that worried about you 
weren t we  mr  gandalf 
by the skills of lord elrond 
you re beginning to mend 
welcome to rivendell  frodo baggins 
  bilbo 
  hello  frodo  my lad 
bilbo 
there and back again
a hobbit s tale  by bilbo baggins   
  this is wonderful 
  i meant to go back   
   wonder at the powers of mirkwood   
   visit lake town   
   see the lonely mountain again 
but age  it seems  has finally caught up with me 
i miss the shire 
i spent all my childhood pretending
i was off somewhere else 
off with you  on one of your adventures 
but my own adventure turned out
to be quite different 
i m not like you  bilbo 
my dear boy 
  now  what have i forgotten 
  packed already 
no harm in being prepared 
  i thought you wanted to see the elves 
  i do 
  more than anything 
  i did 
it s just    
we did what gandalf wanted  didn t we 
we got the ring this far  to rivendell 
and i thought   
   seeing as how you re on the mend 
we d be off soon 
off home 
you are right  sam 
we did what we set out to do 
the ring will be safe in rivendell 
i am ready to go home 
his strength returns 
that wound will never fully heal 
he will carry it the rest of his life 
and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring   
   the hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil 
it is a burden he should never have had to bear 
  we can ask no more of frodo 
  gandalf  the enemy is moving 
sauron s forces are massing in the east 
his eye is fixed on rivendell 
and saruman  you tell me  has betrayed us 
our list of allies grows thin 
his treachery runs deeper than you know 
by foul craft  saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin men 
he s breeding an army in the caverns of isengard 
an army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed 
saruman is coming for the ring 
this evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves 
we do not have the strength to
fight both mordor and isengard 
gandalf   
   the ring cannot stay here 
this peril belongs to all middle earth 
they must decide now how to end it 
the time of the elves is over 
my people are leaving these shores 
who will you look to when we ve gone 
the dwarves 
they hide in mountains seeking riches 
they care not for the troubles of others 
it is in men that we must place our hope 
men 
men are weak  the race of men is failing 
the blood of numenor is all but spent 
its pride and dignity forgotten 
it is because of men the ring survives 
i was there  gandalf 
i was there 3000 years ago   
    when isildur took the ring 
i was there the day the strength of men failed 
isildur  hurry  follow me 
i led isildur into the heart of mount doom   
   where the ring was forged 
the one place it could be destroyed 
cast it into the fire 
  destroy it 
  no 
isildur 
it should have ended that day 
but evil was allowed to endure 
isildur kept the ring 
the line of kings is broken 
there s no strength left in the world of men 
  they re scattered  divided  leaderless 
  there is one who could unite them 
one who could reclaim the throne of gondor 
he turned from that path a long time ago 
he has chosen exile 
you are no elf 
men of the south are welcome here 
  who are you 
  i am a friend to gandalf the grey 
then we are here on common purpose   
   friend 
the shards of narsil 
the blade that cut the ring from sauron s hand 
it s still sharp 
but no more than a broken heirloom 
why do you fear the past 
you are isildur s heir  not isildur himseif 
you are not bound to his fate 
the same blood flows in my veins 
the same weakness 
your time will come 
you will face the same evil 
and you will defeat it 
a si i dhuath ú orthor  aragorn 
 the shadow does not hold sway yet  aragorn 
ú or le a ú or nin 
 not over you  not over me  
renich i lú i erui govannem 
 do you remember when we first met  
nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen 
 i thought i had strayed into a dream  
gwenwin in enninath 
 long years have passed  
ú  arnech in naeth i si celich 
 you did not wear the troubles you carry now  
renech i beth i pennen 
 do you remember what i told you  
you said you d bind yourself to me   
   forsaking the immortal life of your people 
and to that i hold 
i would rather share one lifetime with you   
   than face all the ages of this world alone 
i choose a mortal life 
  you cannot give me this 
  it is mine to give to whom i will   
   like my heart 
strangers from distant lands  friends of old   
   you ve been summoned here
to answer the threat of mordor 
middle earth stands upon the brink of destruction 
none can escape it 
you will unite  or you will fall 
each race is bound to this fate  this one doom 
bring forth the ring  frodo 
so it is true 
the ring of power   
the doom of men   
in a dream   
   i saw the eastern sky grow dark   
   but in the west a pale light lingered 
a voice was crying 
 your doom is near at hand 
isildur s bane is found  
isildur s bane 
boromir 
 ash nazg durbatulûk   
  one ring to rule them all    
   ash nazg gimbatul   
    one ring to find them    
   ash nazg thrakatulûk   
    one ring to bring them all    
   agh burzum ishi krimpatul  
    and in the darkness bind them   
never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in imladris 
i do not ask your pardon  master elrond   
   for the black speech of mordor   
   may yet be heard   
   in every corner of the west 
the ring is altogether evil 
it is a gift 
a gift to the foes of mordor 
why not use this ring 
long has my father  the steward of gondor   
   kept the forces of mordor at bay 
by the blood of our people   
   are your lands kept safe 
give gondor the weapon of the enemy 
let us use it against him 
you cannot wield it  none of us can 
the one ring answers to sauron alone 
it has no other master 
and what would a ranger know of this matter 
this is no mere ranger 
he is aragorn  son of arathorn 
you owe him your allegiance 
aragorn 
this is isildur s heir 
and heir to the throne of gondor 
havo dad  legolas 
 sit down  legolas  
gondor has no king 
gondor needs no king 
aragorn is right  we cannot use it 
you have only one choice 
the ring must be destroyed 
what are we waiting for 
the ring cannot be destroyed  gimli  son of gloin   
   by any craft that we here possess 
the ring was made in the fires of mount doom 
only there can it be unmade 
it must be taken deep into mordor   
   and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came 
ash nazg durbatuluk   
 one ring to rule them all    
one of you   
   must do this 
one does not simply walk into mordor 
its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs 
there is evil there that does not sleep 
the great eye is ever watchful 
it is a barren wasteland   
   riddled with fire  and ash and dust 
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume 
not with 10 000 men could you do this 
it is folly 
have you heard nothing lord elrond has said 
the ring must be destroyed 
and i suppose you think you are the one to do it 
and if we fail  what then  what happens
when sauron takes back what is his 
i will be dead before i see the
ring in the hands of an elf 
never trust an elf 
do you not understand  while you bicker
amongst yourselves  sauron s power grows 
none can escape it 
you ll all be destroyed 
ash nazg durbatuluk
 one ring to rule them all    
   ash nazg gimbatul   
    one ring to find them    
ash nazg durbatuluk   
 one ring to rule them all    
   ash nazg gimbatul   
    one ring to find them    
ash nazg durbatuluk   
 one ring to rule them all    
   ash nazg gimbatul   
    one ring to find them    
ash nazg durbatuluk   
 one ring to rule them all    
i will take it 
i will take it 
i will take the ring to mordor 
though   
   i do not know the way 
i will help you bear this burden  frodo baggins   
   as long as it is yours to bear 
if by my life or death i can protect you   
   i will 
you have my sword 
and you have my bow 
and my ax 
you carry the fates of us all  little one 
if this is indeed the will of the council   
   then gondor will see it done 
  mr  frodo s not going anywhere without me 
  no indeed it is hardly possible to separate you   
   even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not 
oy  we re coming too 
you ll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us 
anyway  you need people
of intelligence on this sort of   
   mission 
quest 
thing 
well  that rules you out  pip 
nine companions 
so be it 
you shall be  the fellowship of the ring 
great 
where are we going 
anirne hene beriad i chen lîn 
 she wanted to protect her child  
ned imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen 
 she thought in rivendell you would be safe  
in her heart  your mother knew
you d be hunted all your life 
that you d never escape your fate 
the skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings   
   but only you have the power to wield it 
i do not want that power 
i have never wanted it 
you are the last of that bloodline 
there is no other 
my old sword  sting 
here  take it  take it 
  it s so light 
  yes  yeah  made by the elves  you know 
the blade glows blue when orcs are close 
and it s times like that  my lad 
when you have to be extra careful 
here s a pretty thing 
mithril 
as light as a feather  and as hard as dragon scales 
let me see you put it on  come on 
my old ring 
i should very much like   
   to hold it again  one last time 
i m sorry i brought this upon you  my boy 
i m sorry that you must carry this burden 
i m sorry for everything 
the ring bearer is setting out
on the quest of mount doom 
on you who travel with him  no oath   
   nor bond is laid to go further than you will 
farewell  hold to your purpose 
may the blessings of elves and men   
   and all free folk go with you 
the fellowship awaits the ring bearer 
mordor  gandalf  is it left or right 
left 
we must hold to this course  west
of the misty mountains  for 40 days 
if our luck holds  the gap of rohan
will still be open to us 
from there  our road turns east to mordor 
two  one  five  good  very good 
move your feet 
  you look good  pippin 
  thanks 
faster 
if anyone was to ask for my opinion 
which i note they re not   
   i d say we were taking the long way  round 
gandalf 
we could pass through the mines of moria 
my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome 
no gimli  i would not take the road through
moria unless i had no other choice 
sorry 
get him 
  for the shire 
  hold him  hold him down  merry 
gentlemen  that s enough 
you ve got my arm 
you ve got my arm 
  what is that 
  nothing  it s just a wisp of cloud 
it s moving fast 
against the wind 
  crebain from dunland 
  hide 
  hurry 
  take cover 
spies of saruman 
the passage south is being watched 
we must take the pass of caradhras 
frodo 
boromir 
it is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt   
   over so small a thing 
such a little thing 
boromir 
give the ring to frodo 
as you wish 
i care not 
so  gandalf  you try to lead them over caradhras 
and if that fails  where then will you go 
if the mountain defeats you   
    will you risk a more dangerous road 
cuiva nwalca carnirasse 
 wake up cruel redhorn  
there is a fell voice on the air 
nai yarvaxea rasselya 
 may your horn be bloodstained  
it s saruman 
he s trying to bring down the mountain 
gandalf  we must turn back 
no 
losto caradhras  sedho  hodo  nuitho i  ruith 
 sleep caradhras  be still  lie still  hold your wrath  
cuiva nwalca carnirasse 
 wake up cruel redhorn  
nai yarvaxea rasselya   
 may your bloodstained horn    
   taltuva notto carinnar 
    fall upon enemy heads  
we must get off the mountain 
make for the gap of rohan 
and take the west road to my city 
the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard 
we cannot pass over a mountain 
let us go under it 
let us go through the mines of moria 
moria  you fear to go into those mines 
the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep 
you know what they awoke
in the darkness of khazad dûm 
shadow and flame 
let the ring bearer decide 
we cannot stay here 
this will be the death of the hobbits 
frodo 
we will go through the mines 
so be it 
frodo  come and help an old man 
how is your shoulder 
  better than it was 
  and the ring 
you feel its power growing  don t you 
i ve felt it too 
you must be careful now 
evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship 
and  i fear  from within 
  who then do i trust 
  you must trust yourself 
trust your own strengths 
  what do you mean 
  there are many powers in this world   
   for good or for evil 
some are greater than i am 
and against some i have not yet been tested 
the walls   
   of moria 
dwarf doors are invisible when closed 
yes  gimli  their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten 
why doesn t that surprise me 
well  let s see 
ithildin 
it mirrors only starlight and moonlight 
it reads   the doors of durin  lord of moria 
  speak  friend  and enter  
  what do you suppose that means 
oh it s quite simple  if you are a friend 
you speak the password and the doors will open 
annon edhellen  edro hi ammen 
 gate of the elves  open now for me  
   lasto beth lammen 
    listen to the word of my tongue  
nothing s happening 
i once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves   
   men and orcs 
what are you going to do  then 
knock your head against these doors 
peregrin took 
and if that does not shatter them   
   and i am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions   
   i will try to find the opening words 
ando eldarinwa   
 gate of elves    
   a lasta quettanya   
    listen to my word    
   fenda casarinwa   
    threshold of dwarves    
mines are no place for a pony 
  even one so brave as bill 
  bye bye  bill 
fennas nogothrim   
 doorway of the dwarf folk    
go on  bill  go on 
don t worry  sam  he knows the way home 
do not disturb the water 
oh  it s useless 
it s a riddle 
 speak  friend  and enter  
what s the elvish word for  friend  
mellon 
soon  master elf  you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves 
roaring fires  malt beer  ripe meat off the bone 
this  my friend  is the home of my cousin balin 
and they call it a mine 
a mine 
this is no mine  it s a tomb 
no    
no 
goblins 
we make for the gap of rohan 
we should never have come here 
now  get out of here  get out 
  frodo 
  help 
strider 
  help 
  get off him 
aragorn 
frodo 
into the mines 
  legolas 
  into the cave 
run 
we now have but one choice 
we must face the long dark of moria 
be on your guard 
there are older and fouler things than orcs   
   in the deep places of the world 
quietly now 
it s a four day journey to the other side 
let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed 
the wealth of moria was not in gold   
   or jewels   
   but mithril 
bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that thorin gave him 
  oh  that was a kingly gift 
  yes 
i never told him   
   but its worth was greater
than the value of the shire 
pippin 
i have no memory of this place 
  are we lost 
  no 
  i think we are 
  gandalf s thinking 
  merry 
  what 
i m hungry 
  there s something down there 
  it s gollum 
  gollum 
  he s been following us for three days 
  he escaped the dungeons of barad dûr 
  escaped   
   or was set loose 
now the ring has brought him here 
he will never be rid of his need for it 
he hates and loves the ring 
as he hates and loves himseif 
smeagol s life is a sad story 
yes  smeagol he was once called 
before the ring found him 
before it drove him mad 
it s a pity bilbo didn t kill him
when he had the chance 
pity 
it is pity that stayed bilbo s hand 
many that live deserve death 
some that die deserve life 
can you give it to them  frodo 
do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment 
even the very wise cannot see all ends 
my heart tells me that gollum has some
part to play yet  for good or ill   
   before this is over 
the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many 
i wish the ring had never come to me 
i wish none of this had happened 
so do all who live to see such times 
but that is not for them to decide 
all we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us 
there are other forces at work in this
world  frodo  besides the will of evil 
bilbo was meant to find the ring 
in which case  you also were meant to have it 
and that is an encouraging thought 
it s that way 
  he s remembered 
  no 
but the air doesn t smell so foul down here 
if in doubt  meriadoc  always follow your nose 
let me risk a little more light 
behold   
   the great realm and dwarf city of dwarrowdelf 
now there s an eye opener  and no mistake 
gimli 
no 
oh  no 
no 
 here lies balin   
   son of fundin   
   lord of moria  
he is dead  then 
it s as i feared 
we must move on  we cannot linger 
 they have taken the bridge and the second hall 
we have barred the gates   
   but cannot hold them for long 
the ground shakes 
drums   
   drums in the deep 
we cannot get out 
a shadow moves in the dark 
we cannot get out 
they are coming  
fool of a took 
throw yourself in next time 
and rid us of your stupidity 
frodo 
orcs 
get back  stay close to gandalf 
they have a cave troll 
let them come 
there is one dwarf yet in moria
who still draws breath 
i think i m getting the hang of this 
frodo 
aragorn  aragorn 
frodo 
frodo 
oh  no 
he s alive 
i m all right  i m not hurt 
you should be dead 
that spear would have skewered a wild boar 
i think there s more to this
hobbit than meets the eye 
mithril 
you are full of surprises  master baggins 
to the bridge of khazad dûm 
this way 
what is this new devilry 
a balrog 
a demon of the ancient world 
this foe is beyond any of you 
run 
quickly 
gandalf 
lead them on  aragorn 
the bridge is near 
do as i say 
swords are no more use here 
gandalf 
merry  pippin 
sam 
nobody tosses a dwarf 
not the beard 
steady 
hold on 
hang on 
lean forward 
steady 
come on 
now 
over the bridge 
fly 
you cannot pass 
gandalf 
i am a servant of the secret fire 
wielder of the flame of anor 
the dark fire will not avail you  flame of udûn 
go back to the shadow 
you   shall not   pass 
  no  no 
  gandalf 
fly  you fools 
no 
aragorn 
legolas  get them up 
give them a moment  for pity s sake 
by nightfall  these hills will be swarming with orcs 
we must reach the woods of lothlórien 
come  boromir  legolas 
gimli  get them up 
on your feet  sam 
frodo 
frodo 
stay close  young hobbits 
they say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods 
an elf witch   
   of terrible power 
all who look upon her   
   fall under her spell 
frodo 
and are never seen again 
your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom 
you bring great evil here  ring bearer 
mr  frodo 
well  here s one dwarf she won t ensnare so easily 
i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox 
the dwarf breathes so loud  we
could have shot him in the dark 
mae govannen  legolas thranduilion 
 welcome  legolas son of thranduil  
govannas vîn gwennen le 
 our fellowship stands in your debt  
haldir o lórien 
 haldir of lórien  
a  aragorn in dúnedain   
 oh  aragorn of the dúnedain    
   istannen le ammen 
    you are known to us  
haldir 
so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves 
speak words we can all understand 
we have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days 
and you know what this dwarf says to that 
ishkhaqwi ai durugnul 
 i spit upon your grave  
that was not so courteous 
you bring great evil with you 
you can go no further 
boe ammen veriad lîn  andelu i ven 
 we need your protection  the road is fell  
merin le telim 
 i wish we may come with you  
henio  aníron boe ammen i dulu lîn 
 please  understand  we need your support  
aragorn 
merin le telim 
 i wish we may come with you  
andelu i ven 
 the road is very dangerous  
gandalf s death was not in vain 
nor would he have you give up hope 
you carry a heavy burden  frodo 
don t carry the weight of the dead 
you will follow me 
cares galeton 
the heart of elvendom on earth 
realm of the lord celeborn
and of galadriel  lady of light 
the enemy knows you have entered here 
what hope you had in secrecy is now gone 
eight there are here  yet nine there
were set out from rivendell 
tell me  where is gandalf 
for i much desire to speak with him 
i can no longer see him from afar 
gandalf the grey did not pass
the borders of this land 
he has fallen into shadow 
he was taken by both shadow and flame 
a balrog of morgoth 
for we went needlessly into the net of moria 
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life 
we do not yet know his full purpose 
do not let the great emptiness
of khazad dûm fill your heart   
   gimli  son of gloin 
for the world has grown full of peril   
   and in all lands   
   love is now mingled with grief 
what now becomes of this fellowship 
without gandalf  hope is lost 
the quest stands upon the edge of a knife 
stray but a little and it will fail   
   to the ruin of all 
yet hope remains while the company is true 
do not let your hearts be troubled 
go now and rest   
   for you are weary with sorrow and much toil 
tonight  you will sleep    
welcome  frodo of the shire   
   one who has seen the eye 
a lament for gandalf 
what do they say about him 
i have not the heart to tell you 
for me  the grief is still too near 
i bet they don t mention his fireworks 
there should be a verse about them 
the finest rockets ever seen
they burst in stars of blue and green
or after thunder  silver showers
came falling like a rain of flowers
oh  that doesn t do them justice by a long road 
take some rest 
these borders are well protected 
i will find no rest here 
i heard her voice inside my head 
she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor 
she said to me   even now there is hope left  
but i cannot see it 
it is long since we had any hope 
my father is a noble man 
but his rule is failing   
   and our people lose faith 
he looks to me to make things right 
and i would do it 
i would see the glory of gondor restored 
have you ever seen it  aragorn 
the white tower of ecthelion 
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver 
its banners caught high in the morning breeze 
have you ever been called home   
   by the clear ringing of silver trumpets 
i have seen the white city   
   long ago 
one day  our paths will lead us there 
and the tower guard shall take up the call 
 the lords of gondor have returned  
will you look into the mirror 
what will i see 
even the wisest cannot tell 
for the mirror   
   shows many things 
things that were   
   things that are   
   and some things   
   that have not yet come to pass 
i know what it is you saw 
for it is also in my mind 
it is what will come to pass if you should fail 
the fellowship is breaking 
it is already begun 
he will try to take the ring 
you know of whom i speak 
one by one  it will destroy them all 
if you ask it of me   
    i will give you the one ring 
you offer it to me freely 
i do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this 
in place of a dark lord  you would have a queen   
   not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn 
treacherous as the sea 
stronger than the foundations of the earth 
all shall love me   
   and despair 
i pass the test  i will diminish   
   and go into the west   
   and remain galadriel 
  i cannot do this alone 
you are a ring bearer  frodo 
to bear a ring of power   
   is to be alone 
this is nenya  the ring of adamant 
and i am its keeper 
this task was appointed to you 
and if you do not find a way   
   no one will 
then i know what i must do 
it s just   
   i m afraid to do it 
even the smallest person can change
the course of the future 
do you know how the orcs first came into being 
they were elves once 
taken by the dark powers   
   tortured and mutilated 
a ruined and terrible form of life 
and now   
   perfected 
my fighting uruk hai   
   whom do you serve 
saruman 
hunt them down  do not stop until  they are found 
you do not know pain 
you do not know fear 
you will taste man flesh 
one of the halflings carries
something of great value 
bring them to me alive and unspoiled 
kill the others 
never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people 
may these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes 
lembas 
elvish waybread 
one small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man 
how many did you eat 
four 
every league you travel south 
the danger will increase 
mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the anduin 
nor will you find safety on the western bank 
strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders 
seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun  yet these have done so 
le aphadar aen 
 you are being tracked  
by river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of rauros 
my gift for you  legolas  is a bow of the galadhrim 
worthy of the skill of our woodland kin 
these are the daggers of the noldorin 
they have already seen service in war 
do not fear  young peregrin took 
you will find your courage 
and for you  samwise gamgee   
   elven rope made of hithlain 
thank you  my lady 
have you run out of those nice  shiny daggers 
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves 
nothing 
except to look upon the lady
of the galadhrim one last time   
   for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth 
actually    
there was one thing 
no  no  i couidn t 
it s quite impossible 
stupid to ask 
i have nothing greater to give   
   than the gift you already bear 
am meleth dîn   
 for her love    
   i ant e guil arwen undómiel pígatha 
    i fear the grace of arwen evenstar will diminish  
aníron i e broniatha  ad ae periatham   
 i would have her leave these shores    
   athar i methid en amar hen 
    and be with her people  
aníron i e círatha na valannor 
 i would have her take the ship to valinor  
that choice is yet before her 
you have your own choice to make  aragorn 
to rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of elendil   
   or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin 
namárië 
 farewell  
nadath nâ i moe cerich 
 there is much you have yet to do  
dan  ú  eveditham  elessar 
 we shall not meet again  elessar  
farewell  frodo baggins 
i give you the light of earendil   
   our most beloved star 
may it be a light for you in dark places   
    when all other lights go out 
i have taken my worst wound at this parting   
   having looked my last upon that which is fairest 
henceforth i will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me 
what was her gift 
i asked her for one hair from her golden head 
she gave me three 
gollum  he has tracked us since moria 
i had hoped we would lose him on the river 
but he s too clever a waterman 
and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts   
   it will make the crossing even more dangerous 
have some food  mr  frodo 
  no  sam 
  you haven t eaten anything all day 
you re not sleeping  neither 
don t think i haven t noticed 
  mr  frodo
  i m all right 
but you re not 
i m here to help you 
i promised gandalf that i would 
you can t help me  sam 
not this time 
get some sleep 
minas tirith is the safer road 
you know that 
from there we can regroup 
strike out for mordor from a place of strength 
there is no strength in gondor that can avail us 
you were quick enough to trust the elves 
have you so little faith in your own people 
yes  there is weakness 
there is frailty 
but there is courage also 
and honor to be found in men 
but you will not see that 
you are afraid 
all your life  you have hidden in the shadows 
scared of who you are  of what you are 
i will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city 
frodo 
the argonath 
long have i desired to look upon the kings of old 
my kin 
we cross the lake at nightfall 
hide the boats and continue on foot 
  we approach mordor from the north 
  oh  yes 
just a simple matter of finding
our way through emyn muil   
   an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks 
and after that  it gets even better 
festering  stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see 
that is our road 
i suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength  master dwarf 
recover my   
  we should leave now 
  no 
orcs patrol the eastern shore 
we must wait for cover of darkness 
it is not the eastern shore that worries me 
a shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind 
something draws near 
i can feel it 
recover strength 
pay no heed to that  young hobbit 
where s frodo 
none of us should wander alone 
you  least of all 
so much depends on you 
frodo 
i know why you seek solitude 
you suffer  i see it day by day 
you sure you do not suffer needlessly 
there are other ways  frodo 
  other paths that we might take 
  i know what you would say 
it would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart 
warning   against what 
we re all afraid  frodo 
but to let that fear drive us 
to destroy what hope we have   
   don t you see that is madness 
  there is no other way 
i ask only for the strength to defend my people 
  if you would but lend me the ring 
  no 
  why do you recoil  i am no thief 
  you are not yourself 
what chance do you think you have 
they will find you 
they will take the ring 
and you will beg for death before the end 
you fool 
it is not yours  save by unhappy chance 
it could have been mine 
it should be mine  give it to me 
  give it to me 
  no 
  give it to me 
  no 
i see your mind 
you will take the ring to sauron 
you will betray us 
you ll go to your death  and the death of us all 
curse you 
curse you and all the halflings 
frodo 
frodo 
what have i done 
please  frodo 
frodo  i m sorry 
ash ghurûm
 they will fall 
frodo 
  it has taken boromir 
  where is the ring 
stay away 
frodo 
  i swore to protect you 
  can you protect me from yourself 
would you destroy it 
aragorn 
aragorn 
elessar 
i would have gone with you to the end 
into the very fires of mordor 
i know 
look after the others  especially sam 
he will not understand 
go  frodo 
run 
run 
mr  frodo 
find the halfling 
find the halfling 
elendil 
aragorn  go 
frodo 
hide here  quick 
come on 
what s he doing 
he s leaving 
  no 
  pippin 
run  frodo  go 
  hey  hey  you 
  over here 
  over here 
  this way 
  it s working 
  i know it s working  run 
  the horn of gondor 
  boromir 
run 
no 
  they took the little ones 
  hold still 
frodo  where is frodo 
i let frodo go 
then you did what i could not 
i tried to take the ring from him 
  the ring is beyond our reach now 
  forgive me 
i did not see it 
  i have failed you all 
  no  boromir 
you fought bravely 
you have kept your honor 
leave it 
it is over 
the world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness   
   and my city to ruin 
i do not know what strength is in my blood   
   but i swear to you  i will
not let the white city fall   
   nor our people fail 
our people 
our people 
i would have followed you  my brother 
my captain 
my king 
be at peace   
   son of gondor 
they will look for his coming from the white tower 
but he will not return 
frodo 
i wish the ring had never come to me 
i wish none of this had happened 
so do all who live to see such times   
   but that is not for them to decide 
all you have to decide   
   is what to do with the time that is given to you 
frodo  no 
frodo 
  mr  frodo 
  no  sam 
go back  sam 
  i m going to mordor alone 
  of course you are 
and i m coming with you 
you can t swim 
sam 
sam 
i made a promise  mr  frodo 
a promise 
 don t you leave him  samwise gamgee  
and i don t mean to 
i don t mean to 
oh sam 
come on 
hurry  frodo and sam have
reached the eastern shore 
  you mean not to follow them 
  frodo s fate is no longer in our hands 
then it has all been in vain 
the fellowship has failed 
not if we hold true to each other 
we will not abandon merry and
pippin to torment and death 
not while we have strength left 
leave all that can be spared behind 
we travel light 
let us hunt some orc 
yes 
mordor 
i hope the others find a safer road 
strider will look after them
