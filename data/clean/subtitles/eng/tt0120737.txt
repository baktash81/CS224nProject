i feel it in the water
han mathon ne chae
i feel it in the earth
a han noston ned wilith
i smell it in the air
much that once was
is lost
for none now live who remember it
the lord of the rings
it began with the forging of the great rings
three were given to the elves
immortal wisest and fairest of all beings
seven to the dwarflords
great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls
and nine
nine rings were gifted to the race of men
who above all else desire power
for within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race
but they were all of them deceived
for another ring was made
in the land of mordor
in the fires of mount doom
the dark lord sauron forged
in secret a master ring
to control all others
and into this ring he poured
his cruelty his malice
and his will to dominate all life
one ring to rule them all
one by one
the free lands of middleearth
fell to the power of the ring
but there were some who resisted
a last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of mordor
and on the slopes of mount doom they
fought for the freedom of middleearth
tangado haid hold positions
leithio i philinn fire the arrows
victory was near
but the power of the ring
could not be undone
it was in this moment
when all hope had faded
that isildur son of the king
took up his fathers sword
sauron the enemy of the free peoples
of middleearth was defeated
the ring passed to isildur
who had this one chance to destroy evil forever
but the hearts of men
are easily corrupted
and the ring of power has a will of its own
it betrayed isildur
to his death
and some things
that should not have been forgotten
were lost
history became legend
legend became myth
and for two and a half thousand years
the ring passed out of all knowledge
until when chance came
it ensnared a new bearer
my precious
the ring came to the creature gollum
who took it deep into the tunnels
of the misty mountains
and there it consumed him
it came to me
my own my love my own
my precious
the ring brought to gollum unnatural long life
for 500 years it poisoned his mind
and in the gloom of gollums cave it waited
darkness crept back into the forests of the world
rumor grew of a shadow in the east
whispers of a nameless fear
and the ring of power perceived
its time had now come
it abandoned gollum
but something happened then
the ring did not intend
it was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable
whats this
a hobbit
bilbo baggins of the shire
a ring
lost
my precious is lost
for the time will soon come
when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all
the 22nd day of september
in the year 1400
by shirereckoning
bag end bagshot row
hobbiton westfarthing
the shire
middleearth
the third age of this world
the fellowship of the ring
there and back again
a hobbits tale
by bilbo baggins
now
where to begin
ah yes
concerning
hobbits
hobbits have been living and farming
in the four farthings of the shire
for many hundreds of years
quite content to ignore and be ignored
by the world of the big folk
middleearth being after all
full of strange creatures beyond count
hobbits must seem of little importance
being neither renowned as great warriors
nor counted among the very wise
frodo someone at the door
in fact it has been remarked by some
that hobbits only real passion is for food
a rather unfair observation
as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales
and the smoking of pipeweed
but where our hearts truly lie
is in peace and quiet
and good tilled earth
for all hobbits share a love of things that grow
and yes no doubt to others our ways seem quaint
but today of all days
it is brought home to me
it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life
frodo the door
sticklebacks where is that boy
frodo
down from the door where it began
and i must follow if i can
the road goes ever on and on
down from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone
and i must follow if i can
youre late
a wizard is never late frodo baggins
nor is he early
he arrives precisely when he means to
its wonderful to see you gandalf
you didnt think id miss
your uncle bilbos birthday
how is the old rascal
i hear its going to be a party
of special magnificence
you know bilbo
hes got the whole piece in an uproar
well that should please him
half the shires been invited
and the rest of them are turning up anyway
and so life in the shire goes on
very much as it has this past age
full of its own comings and goings
with change coming slowly
if it comes at all
for things are made to endure in the shire
passing from one generation to the next
theres always been a baggins
living here under the hill
in bag end
and there always will be
to tell you the truth
bilbos been a bit odd lateiy
i mean more than usual
hes taken to locking himself in his study
he spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks im not looking
wheres it gone
hes up to something
all right then keep your secrets
what
but i know you have something to do with it
good gracious me
before you came along we bagginses
were very well thought of
indeed
never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected
if youre referring to the incident with the dragon
i was barely involved
all i did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door
whatever you did youve been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace
oh really
gandalf gandalf
fireworks gandalf
gandalf
fireworks gandalf
gandalf
im glad youre back
so am i dear boy

but not much for afters
oh no were all right
ive just found some sponge cake
i could make you some eggs if youd li
just tea thank you
oh right
you dont mind if i eat do you
no not at all
bilbo bilbo baggins
im not at home
its the sackvillebagginses
i know youre in there
theyre after the house
theyve never forgiven me for living this long
ive got to get away from these confounded
relatives hanging on the bell all day
never giving me a moments peace
i want to see mountains again
mountains gandalf
and then find somewhere quiet
where i can finish my book oh tea
so you mean to go through with your plan
yes yes its all in hand
all the arrangements are made
oh thank you
frodo suspects something
of course he does hes a baggins
not some blockheaded bracegirdle
from hardbottle
you will tell him wont you
yes yes
hes very fond of you
i know
hed probably come with me if i asked him
i think in his heart frodos
still in love with the shire
the woods the fields
little rivers
i am old gandalf
i know i dont look it but im
beginning to feel it in my heart
i feel thin
sort of stretched
like butter scraped over too much bread
i need a holiday a very long holiday
and i dont expect i shall return
in fact i mean not to
old toby
the finest weed in the southfarthing
gandalf my old friend
this will be a night to remember
hello hello
fatty bolger lovely to see you
welcome welcome
go on sam ask rosie for a dance
i think ill just have another ale
oh no you dont
go on
so there i was
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls
and they were all arguing amongst themselves
about how they were going to cook us
whether it be turned on a spit or to sit
on us one by one squash us into jelly
they spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors
that the suns first light
crept over the top of the trees
and turned them all to stone
quickly
up they go
no no the big one  big one
mrs bracegirdle how nice to see you
welcome welcome
are all these children yours
good gracious you have been productive
bilbo
sackvillebagginses
quickly hide
thank you my boy
youre a good lad frodo
im very selfish you know
yes i am very selfish
i dont know why i took you in after
your mother and father died
but it wasnt out of charity
i think it was because
of all my numerous relations
you were the one baggins that showed real spirit
bilbo have you been at the gaffers home brew
no
well yes but thats not the point
the point is frodo
youll be all right
done
youre supposed to stick it in the ground
it is in the ground
outside
this was your idea
bilbo
bilbo watch out for the dragon
nonsense there hasnt been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years
that was good
lets get another one
meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took
i mightve known
speech bilbo

today is my 111th birthday
happy birthday
but alas eleventhone years is
far too short a time to live among
such excellent and admirable hobbits
i dont know half of you
half as well as i should like
and i like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve
i have things to do
ive put this off for far too long
i regret to announce this is the end
im going now
i bid you all a very fond farewell
goodbye
i suppose you think that was terribly clever
come on gandalf
did you see their faces
there are many magic rings in
this world bilbo baggins
and none of them should be used lightly
it was just a bit of fun
oh youre probably right as usual
you will keep an eye on frodo wont you
two eyes
as often as i can spare them
im leaving everything to him
what about this ring of yours
is that staying too
yes yes
its in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece
no wait its
here in my pocket
isnt that isnt that odd now
yet after all why not
why shouldnt i keep it
i think you should leave the ring behind
is that so hard
well no
and yes
now it comes to it
i dont feel l ike parting with it
its mine i found it it came to me
theres no need to get angry
well if im angry its your fault
its mine
my own
my precious
precious
its been called that before but not by you
what business is it of yours
what i do with my own things
i think youve had that ring quite long enough
you want it for yourself
bilbo baggins
do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks
i am not trying to rob you
im trying to help you
all your long years weve been friends
trust me as you once did
let it go
youre right gandalf
the ring must go to frodo
its late the road is long
yes it is time
bilbo the ring is still in your pocket
ive thought up an ending for my book
and he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days
and im sure you will my dear friend
goodbye gandalf
goodbye dear bilbo
the road goes ever on and on
until our next meeting
its mine my own
my precious
riddles in the dark
bilbo
bilbo
my precious
precious
hes gone hasnt he
he talked for so long about leaving
i didnt think hed really do it
gandalf
bilbos ring
hes gone to stay with the elves
hes left you bag end
along with all his possessions
the ring is yours now
put it somewhere out of sight
where are you going
there are some things that i must see to
what things
questions questions that need answering
youve only just arrived
i dont understand
neither do i
keep it secret
keep it safe
shire
baggins
the year 3434 of the second age
here follows the account of isildur
high king of gondor
and the finding of the ring of power
it has come to me
the one ring
it shall be an heirloom of my kingdom
all those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate
for i will risk no hurt to the ring
it is precious to me
though i buy it with great pain
the markings upon the band begin to fade
the writing which at first was as clear
as red flame has all but disappeared
a secret now that only fire can tell
shire
baggins
theres no bagginses around here
theyre all up in hobbiton
that way
hey ho to the dock i go
to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow
but there still be
many miles to go
sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
and the stream that falls from hill to plain
better than rain or rippling brook
is a mug of beer inside this took
theres been some strange folk crossing the shire
dwarves and others of a less than savory nature
war is brewing
the mountains are fair teeming with goblins
faroff tales and childrens stories thats all that is
youre beginning to sound like that old
bilbo baggins cracked he was
young mr frodo here hes cracking
and proud of it
cheers gaffer
aye cheers
weel its none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders
keep your nose out of trouble
and no troublell come to you
good night lads
good night
good night sweet maiden of the golden ale
mind who youre sweettaking
dont worry sam
rosie knows an idiot when she sees one
does she
good night sam
good night mr frodo
is it secret is it safe
what are you doing
hold out your hand frodo
its quite cool
what can you see
can you see anything
nothing
theres nothing
wait
there are markings
its some form of elvish
i cant read it
there are few who can
the language is that of mordor
which i will not utter here
mordor
in the common tongue it says
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them
one ring to bring them all
and in the darkness bind them
this is the one ring
forged by the dark lord sauron
in the fires of mount doom
taken by isiidur from the hand of sauron himself
bilbo found it
in gollums cave
yes
for 60 years the ring lay quiet in bilbos keeping
prolonging his life delaying old age
but no longer frodo
evil is stirring in mordor
the ring has awoken
its heard its masters call
but he was destroyed
sauron was destroyed
no frodo
the spirit of sauron endured
his life force is bound to the ring
and the ring survived
sauron has returned
his orcs have multiplied
his fortress at baraddûr
is rebuilt in the land of mordor
sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness
he is seeking it
seeking it  all his thought is bent on it
for the ring yearns above all else
to return to the hand of its master
they are one
the ring and the dark lord
frodo
he must never find it
all right
we put it away we keep it hidden
we never speak of it again
no one knows its here do they
do they gandalf
there is one other who knew
that bilbo had the ring
i looked everywhere for the creature gollum
but the enemy found him first
i dont know how long they tortured him
but amidst the endless screams and
inane babble they discerned two words
shire
baggins
shire
baggins
but that would lead them here
who goes there
take it gandalf
take it
no frodo
you must take it
you cannot offer me this ring
im giving it to you
dont tempt me frodo
i dare not take it
not even to keep it safe
understand frodo
i would use this ring from a desire to do good
but through me it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine
but it cannot stay in the shire
no
no it cant
what must i do
you must leave and leave quickly
where where do i go
get out of the shire
make for the village of bree
bree
what about you
ill be waiting for you
at the inn of the prancing pony
and the ring will be safe there
i dont know frodo
i dont have any answers
i must see the head of my order
he is both wise and powerful trust me frodo
hell know what to do
youll have to leave the name
of baggins behind you
that name is not safe outside the shire
travel only by day
and stay off the road
i can cut across country easily enough
my dear frodo
hobbits really are amazing creatures
you can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month
and yet after a hundred years
they can still surprise you
get down
confound it all samwise gamgee
have you been eavesdropping
i havent been dropping no eaves honest
i was just cutting the grass under
the window thereif you follow me
a little late for trimming the verge dont you think
i heard raised voices
what did you hear speak
nothing important
that is i heard a good deal
about a ring and a dark lord
and something about the end of the world but
please mr gandalf sir dont hurt me
dont turn me into anything unnatural
no
perhaps not
ive thought of a better use for you
come along samwise keep up
be careful both of you
the enemy has many spies in his service
birds beasts
is it safe
never put it on
for the agents of the dark lord
will be drawn to its power
always remember frodo
the ring is trying to get back to its master
it wants to be found
this is it
this is what
if i take one more step
itll be the farthest away
from home ive ever been
come on sam
remember what bilbo used to say
its a dangerous business frodo
going out your door
you step onto the road
and if you dont keep your feet
theres no knowing where
you might be swept off to
sam
woodelves
theyre going to the harbor
beyond the white towers
to the grey havens
theyre leaving middleearth
never to return
i dont know why
it makes me sad
everywhere i lie theres a dirty
great root sticking into my back
just shut your eyes
and imagine youre back in your own bed
with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow
its not working mr frodo
im never going to be able to sleep out here
me neither sam
smoke rises from the mountain of doom
the hour grows late
and gandalf the grey rides to isengard
seeking my counsel
for that is why you have come is it not
my old friend
saruman
you are sure of this
beyond any doubt
so the ring of power has been found
all these long years it was in the shire
under my very nose
yet you did not have the wit to see it
your love of the halflings leaf
has clearly slowed your mind
but we still have time
time enough to counter sauron if we act quickly
time
what time do you think we have
sauron has regained much of his former strength
he cannot yet take physical form
but his spirit has lost none of its potency
concealed within his fortress
the lord of mordor sees all
his gaze pierces cloud shadow earth and flesh
you know of what i speak gandalf
a great eye lidless wreathed in flame
the eye of sauron
he is gathering all evil to him
very soon hell have summoned an army
great enough for an assault upon middleearth
you know this
how
i have seen it
a palantir is a dangerous tool saruman
why
why should we fear to use it
they are not all accounted for
the lost seeingstones
we do not know who else may be watching
the hour is later than you think
saurons forces are already moving
the nine have left minas morgul
the nine
they crossed the river isen on midsummers eve
disguised as riders in black
theyve reached the shire
they will find the ring
and kill the one who carries it
frodo
you did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of sauron
there are none who can
against the power of mordor
there can be no victory
we must join with him gandalf
we must join with sauron
it would be wise my friend
tell me
friend
when did saruman the wise abandon reason for madness
i gave you the chance of
aiding me willingly
but you have elected the way of pain
mr frodo
frodo frodo
i thought id lost you
what are you taking about
its just something gandalf said
what did he say
dont you lose him samwise gamgee
and i dont mean to
sam were still in the shire
what could possibly happen
frodo
merry its frodo baggins
hello frodo
get off him
come on frodo
whats the meaning of this
youve been into farmer maggots crop
you get back here
get out of my field
youll know the devil if i catch up with you

who are you

or ill have you longshanks
you have a stout heart little hobbit
but that will not save you
you can no longer wait for the wizard frodo
theyre coming
what are they
they were once men
great kings of men
then sauron the deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power
blinded by their greed
they took them without question
one by one falling into darkness
now they are slaves to his will
they are the nazgûl
ringwraiths neither living nor dead
at all times they feel
the presence of the ring
drawn to the power of the one
they will never stop hunting you
where are you taking us
into the wild
how can we know this strider
is a friend of gandalf
i think a servant of the enemy would look fairer
and feel fouler
hes foul enough
we have no choice but to trust him
but where is he leading us
to rivendell master gamgee
to the house of elrond
did you hear that rivendell

a few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid
but you have some strength in you
my dear hobbit
what happened gandalf
why didnt you meet us
i am sorry frodo
i was delayed
a friendship with saruman
is not lightly thrown aside
one ill turn deserves another it is over
embrace the power of the ring
or embrace your own destruction
there is only one lord of the ring
only one who can bend it to his will
and he does not share power
so you have chosendeath
gandalf what is it

bilbo
there and back again
a hobbits tale by bilbo baggins
this is wonderful
i meant to go back
wonder at the powers of mirkwood
visit laketown
see the lonely mountain again
but age it seems has finally caught up with me
i miss the shire
i spent all my childhood pretending
i was off somewhere else
off with you on one of your adventures
but my own adventure turned out
to be quite different
im not like you bilbo
my dear boy
now what have i forgotten
packed already
no harm in being prepared
i thought you wanted to see the elves
i do
more than anything
i did
its just
we did what gandalf wanted didnt we
we got the ring this far to rivendell
and i thought
seeing as how youre on the mend
wed be off soon
off home
you are right sam
we did what we set out to do
the ring will be safe in rivendell
i am ready to go home
his strength returns
that wound will never fully heal
he will carry it the rest of his life
and yet to have come so far still bearing the ring
the hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil
it is a burden he should never have had to bear
we can ask no more of frodo
gandalf the enemy is moving
saurons forces are massing in the east
his eye is fixed on rivendell
and saruman you tell me has betrayed us
our list of allies grows thin
his treachery runs deeper than you know
by foul craft saruman
has crossed orcs with goblinmen
hes breeding an army in the caverns of isengard
an army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed
saruman is coming for the ring
this evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves
we do not have the strength to
fight both mordor and isengard
gandalf
the ring cannot stay here
this peril belongs to all middleearth
they must decide now how to end it
the time of the elves is over
my people are leaving these shores
who will you look to when weve gone
the dwarves
they hide in mountains seeking riches
they care not for the troubles of others
it is in men that we must place our hope
men
men are weak the race of men is failing
the blood of numenor is all but spent
its pride and dignity forgotten
it is because of men the ring survives
i was there gandalf
i was there 3000 years ago
when isildur took the ring
i was there the day the strength of men failed
isildur hurry follow me
i led isildur into the heart of mount doom
where the ring was forged
the one place it could be destroyed
cast it into the fire
destroy it
no
isildur
it should have ended that day
but evil was allowed to endure
isildur kept the ring
the line of kings is broken
theres no strength left in the world of men
theyre scattered divided leaderless
there is one who could unite them
one who could reclaim the throne of gondor
he turned from that path a long time ago
he has chosen exile
you are no elf
men of the south are welcome here
who are you
i am a friend to gandalf the grey
then we are here on common purpose
friend
the shards of narsil
the blade that cut the ring from saurons hand
its still sharp
but no more than a broken heirloom
why do you fear the past
you are isildurs heir not isildur himseif
you are not bound to his fate
the same blood flows in my veins
the same weakness
your time will come
you will face the same evil
and you will defeat it
a si idhuath úorthor aragorn
the shadow does not hold sway yet aragorn
ú or le a ú or nin
not over you not over me
renich i lú i erui govannem
do you remember when we first met
nauthannen i ned ôl reniannen
i thought i had strayed into a dream
gwenwin in enninath
long years have passed
úarnech in naeth i si celich
you did not wear the troubles you carry now
renech i beth i pennen
do you remember what i told you
you said youd bind yourself to me
forsaking the immortal life of your people
and to that i hold
i would rather share one lifetime with you
than face all the ages of this world alone
i choose a mortal life
you cannot give me this
it is mine to give to whom i will
like my heart
strangers from distant lands friends of old
youve been summoned here
to answer the threat of mordor
middleearth stands upon the brink of destruction
none can escape it
you will unite or you will fall
each race is bound to this fate this one doom
bring forth the ring frodo
so it is true
the ring of power
the doom of men
in a dream
i saw the eastern sky grow dark
but in the west a pale light lingered
a voice was crying
your doom is near at hand
isildurs bane is found
isildurs bane
boromir
ash nazg durbatulûk
one ring to rule them all
ash nazg gimbatul
one ring to find them
ash nazg thrakatulûk
one ring to bring them all
agh burzumishi krimpatul
and in the darkness bind them
never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in imladris
i do not ask your pardon master elrond
for the black speech of mordor
may yet be heard
in every corner of the west
the ring is altogether evil
it is a gift
a gift to the foes of mordor
why not use this ring
long has my father the steward of gondor
kept the forces of mordor at bay
by the blood of our people
are your lands kept safe
give gondor the weapon of the enemy
let us use it against him
you cannot wield it none of us can
the one ring answers to sauron alone
it has no other master
and what would a ranger know of this matter
this is no mere ranger
he is aragorn son of arathorn
you owe him your allegiance
aragorn
this is isildurs heir
and heir to the throne of gondor
havo dad legolas
sit down legolas
gondor has no king
gondor needs no king
aragorn is right we cannot use it
you have only one choice
the ring must be destroyed
what are we waiting for
the ring cannot be destroyed gimli son of gloin
by any craft that we here possess
the ring was made in the fires of mount doom
only there can it be unmade
it must be taken deep into mordor
and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came
ash nazg durbatuluk
one ring to rule them all
one of you
must do this
one does not simply walk into mordor
its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs
there is evil there that does not sleep
the great eye is everwatchful
it is a barren wasteland
riddled with fire and ash and dust
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume
not with 10000 men could you do this
it is folly
have you heard nothing lord elrond has said
the ring must be destroyed
and i suppose you think you are the one to do it
and if we fail what then what happens
when sauron takes back what is his
i will be dead before i see the
ring in the hands of an elf
never trust an elf
do you not understand while you bicker
amongst yourselves saurons power grows
none can escape it
youll all be destroyed
ash nazg durbatuluk
one ring to rule them all
ash nazg gimbatul
one ring to find them
ash nazg durbatuluk
one ring to rule them all
ash nazg gimbatul
one ring to find them
ash nazg durbatuluk
one ring to rule them all
ash nazg gimbatul
one ring to find them
ash nazg durbatuluk
one ring to rule them all
i will take it
i will take it
i will take the ring to mordor
though
i do not know the way
i will help you bear this burden frodo baggins
as long as it is yours to bear
if by my life or death i can protect you
i will
you have my sword
and you have my bow
and my ax
you carry the fates of us all little one
if this is indeed the will of the council
then gondor will see it done
mr frodos not going anywhere without me
no indeed it is hardly possible to separate you
even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not
oy were coming too
youll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us
anyway you need people
of intelligence on this sort of
mission
quest
thing
well that rules you out pip
nine companions
so be it
you shall be the fellowship of the ring
great
where are we going
anirne hene beriad i chen lîn
she wanted to protect her child
ned imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen
she thought in rivendell you would be safe
in her heart your mother knew
youd be hunted all your life
that youd never escape your fate
the skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings
but only you have the power to wield it
i do not want that power
i have never wanted it
you are the last of that bloodline
there is no other
my old sword sting
here take it take it
its so light
yes yeah made by the elves you know
the blade glows blue when orcs are close
and its times like that my lad
when you have to be extra careful
heres a pretty thing
mithril
as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales
let me see you put it on come on
my old ring
i should very much like
to hold it again one last time
im sorry i brought this upon you my boy
im sorry that you must carry this burden
im sorry for everything
the ringbearer is setting out
on the quest of mount doom
on you who travel with him no oath
nor bond is laid to go further than you will
farewell hold to your purpose
may the blessings of elves and men
and all free folk go with you
the fellowship awaits the ringbearer
mordor gandalf is it left or right
left
we must hold to this course west
of the misty mountains for 40 days
if our luck holds the gap of rohan
will still be open to us
from there our road turns east to mordor
two one five good very good
move your feet
you look good pippin
thanks
faster
if anyone was to ask for my opinion
which i note theyre not
id say we were taking the long way round
gandalf
we could pass through the mines of moria
my cousin balin would give us a royal welcome
no gimli i would not take the road through
moria unless i had no other choice
sorry
get him
for the shire
hold him hold him down merry
gentlemen thats enough
youve got my arm
youve got my arm
what is that
nothing its just a wisp of cloud
its moving fast
against the wind
crebain from dunland
hide
hurry
take cover
spies of saruman
the passage south is being watched
we must take the pass of caradhras
frodo
boromir
it is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt
over so small a thing
such a little thing
boromir
give the ring to frodo
as you wish
i care not
so gandalf you try to lead them over caradhras
and if that fails where then will you go
if the mountain defeats you
will you risk a more dangerous road
cuiva nwalca carnirasse
wake up cruel redhorn
there is a fell voice on the air
nai yarvaxea rasselya
may your horn be bloodstained
its saruman
hes trying to bring down the mountain
gandalf we must turn back
no
losto caradhras sedho hodo nuitho i ruith
sleep caradhras be still lie still hold your wrath
cuiva nwalca carnirasse
wake up cruel redhorn
nai yarvaxea rasselya
may your bloodstained horn
taltuva nottocarinnar
fall upon enemy heads
we must get off the mountain
make for the gap of rohan
and take the west road to my city
the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard
we cannot pass over a mountain
let us go under it
let us go through the mines of moria
moria you fear to go into those mines
the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep
you know what they awoke
in the darkness of khazaddûm
shadow and flame
let the ringbearer decide
we cannot stay here
this will be the death of the hobbits
frodo
we will go through the mines
so be it
frodo come and help an old man
how is your shoulder
better than it was
and the ring
you feel its power growing dont you
ive felt it too
you must be careful now
evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship
and i fear from within
who then do i trust
you must trust yourself
trust your own strengths
what do you mean
there are many powers in this world
for good or for evil
some are greater than i am
and against some i have not yet been tested
the walls
of moria
dwarf doors are invisible when closed
yes gimli their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten
why doesnt that surprise me
well lets see
ithildin
it mirrors only starlight and moonlight
it reads the doors of durin lord of moria
speak friend and enter
what do you suppose that means
oh its quite simple if you are a friend
you speak the password and the doors will open
annon edhellen edro hi ammen
gate of the elves open now for me
lasto beth lammen
listen to the word of my tongue
nothings happening
i once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves
men and orcs
what are you going to do then
knock your head against these doors
peregrin took
and if that does not shatter them
and i am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions
i will try to find the opening words
ando eldarinwa
gate of elves
a lasta quettanya
listen to my word
fenda casarinwa
threshold of dwarves
mines are no place for a pony
even one so brave as bill
byebye bill
fennas nogothrim
doorway of the dwarffolk
go on bill go on
dont worry sam he knows the way home
do not disturb the water
oh its useless
its a riddle
speak friend and enter
whats the elvish word for friend
mellon
soon master elf you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves
roaring fires malt beer ripe meat off the bone
this my friend is the home of my cousin balin
and they call it a mine
a mine
this is no mine its a tomb
no
no
goblins
we make for the gap of rohan
we should never have come here
now get out of here get out
frodo
help
strider
help
get off him
aragorn
frodo
into the mines
legolas
into the cave
run
we now have but one choice
we must face the long dark of moria
be on your guard
there are older and fouler things than orcs
in the deep places of the world
quietly now
its a fourday journey to the other side
let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed
the wealth of moria was not in gold
or jewels
but mithril
bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that thorin gave him
oh that was a kingly gift
yes
i never told him
but its worth was greater
than the value of the shire
pippin
i have no memory of this place
are we lost
no
i think we are
gandalfs thinking
merry
what
im hungry
theres something down there
its gollum
gollum
hes been following us for three days
he escaped the dungeons of baraddûr
escaped
or was set loose
now the ring has brought him here
he will never be rid of his need for it
he hates and loves the ring
as he hates and loves himseif
smeagols life is a sad story
yes smeagol he was once called
before the ring found him
before it drove him mad
its a pity bilbo didnt kill him
when he had the chance
pity
it is pity that stayed bilbos hand
many that live deserve death
some that die deserve life
can you give it to them frodo
do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment
even the very wise cannot see all ends
my heart tells me that gollum has some
part to play yet for good or ill
before this is over
the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many
i wish the ring had never come to me
i wish none of this had happened
so do all who live to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us
there are other forces at work in this
world frodo besides the will of evil
bilbo was meant to find the ring
in which case you also were meant to have it
and that is an encouraging thought
its that way
hes remembered
no
but the air doesnt smell so foul down here
if in doubt meriadoc always follow your nose
let me risk a little more light
behold
the great realm and dwarfcity of dwarrowdelf
now theres an eye opener and no mistake
gimli
no
oh no
no
here lies balin
son of fundin
lord of moria
he is dead then
its as i feared
we must move on we cannot linger
they have taken the bridge and the second hall
we have barred the gates
but cannot hold them for long
the ground shakes
drums
drums in the deep
we cannot get out
a shadow moves in the dark
we cannot get out
they are coming
fool of a took
throw yourself in next time
and rid us of your stupidity
frodo
orcs
get back stay close to gandalf
they have a cavetroll
let them come
there is one dwarf yet in moria
who still draws breath
i think im getting the hang of this
frodo
aragorn aragorn
frodo
frodo
oh no
hes alive
im all right im not hurt
you should be dead
that spear would have skewered a wild boar
i think theres more to this
hobbit than meets the eye
mithril
you are full of surprises master baggins
to the bridge of khazaddûm
this way
what is this new devilry
a balrog
a demon of the ancient world
this foe is beyond any of you
run
quickly
gandalf
lead them on aragorn
the bridge is near
do as i say
swords are no more use here
gandalf
merry pippin
sam
nobody tosses a dwarf
not the beard
steady
hold on
hang on
lean forward
steady
come on
now
over the bridge
fly
you cannot pass
gandalf
i am a servant of the secret fire
wielder of the flame of anor
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udûn
go back to the shadow
you  shall not  pass
no no
gandalf
fly you fools
no
aragorn
legolas get them up
give them a moment for pitys sake
by nightfall these hills will be swarming with orcs
we must reach the woods of lothlórien
come boromir legolas
gimli get them up
on your feet sam
frodo
frodo
stay close young hobbits
they say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods
an elfwitch
of terrible power
all who look upon her
fall under her spell
frodo
and are never seen again
your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom
you bring great evil here ringbearer
mr frodo
well heres one dwarf she wont ensnare so easily
i have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox
the dwarf breathes so loud we
could have shot him in the dark
mae govannen legolas thranduilion
welcome legolas son of thranduil
govannas vîn gwennen le
our fellowship stands in your debt
haldir o lórien
haldir of lórien
a aragorn in dúnedain
oh aragorn of the dúnedain
istannen le ammen
you are known to us
haldir
so much for the legendary courtesy of the elves
speak words we can all understand
we have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days
and you know what this dwarf says to that
ishkhaqwi ai durugnul
i spit upon your grave
that was not so courteous
you bring great evil with you
you can go no further
boe ammen veriad lîn andelu i ven
we need your protection the road is fell
merin le telim
i wish we may come with you
henio aníron boe ammen i dulu lîn
please understand we need your support
aragorn
merin le telim
i wish we may come with you
andelu i ven
the road is very dangerous
gandalfs death was not in vain
nor would he have you give up hope
you carry a heavy burden frodo
dont carry the weight of the dead
you will follow me
cares galeton
the heart of elvendom on earth
realm of the lord celeborn
and of galadriel lady of light
the enemy knows you have entered here
what hope you had in secrecy is now gone
eight there are here yet nine there
were set out from rivendell
tell me where is gandalf
for i much desire to speak with him
i can no longer see him from afar
gandalf the grey did not pass
the borders of this land
he has fallen into shadow
he was taken by both shadow and flame
a balrog of morgoth
for we went needlessly into the net of moria
needless were none of the deeds of gandalf in life
we do not yet know his full purpose
do not let the great emptiness
of khazaddûm fill your heart
gimli son of gloin
for the world has grown full of peril
and in all lands
love is now mingled with grief
what now becomes of this fellowship
without gandalf hope is lost
the quest stands upon the edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fail
to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while the company is true
do not let your hearts be troubled
go now and rest
for you are weary with sorrow and much toil
tonight you will sleep
welcome frodo of the shire
one who has seen the eye
a lament for gandalf
what do they say about him
i have not the heart to tell you
for me the grief is still too near
i bet they dont mention his fireworks
there should be a verse about them
the finest rockets ever seen
they burst in stars of blue and green
or after thunder silver showers
came falling like a rain of flowers
oh that doesnt do them justice by a long road
take some rest
these borders are wellprotected
i will find no rest here
i heard her voice inside my head
she spoke of my father and the fall of gondor
she said to me even now there is hope left
but i cannot see it
it is long since we had any hope
my father is a noble man
but his rule is failing
and our people lose faith
he looks to me to make things right
and i would do it
i would see the glory of gondor restored
have you ever seen it aragorn
the white tower of ecthelion
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver
its banners caught high in the morning breeze
have you ever been called home
by the clear ringing of silver trumpets
i have seen the white city
long ago
one day our paths will lead us there
and the tower guard shall take up the call
the lords of gondor have returned
will you look into the mirror
what will i see
even the wisest cannot tell
for the mirror
shows many things
things that were
things that are
and some things
that have not yet come to pass
i know what it is you saw
for it is also in my mind
it is what will come to pass if you should fail
the fellowship is breaking
it is already begun
he will try to take the ring
you know of whom i speak
one by one it will destroy them all
if you ask it of me
i will give you the one ring
you offer it to me freely
i do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this
in place of a dark lord you would have a queen
not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn
treacherous as the sea
stronger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me
and despair
i pass the test i will diminish
and go into the west
and remain galadriel
i cannot do this alone
you are a ringbearer frodo
to bear a ring of power
is to be alone
this is nenya the ring of adamant
and i am its keeper
this task was appointed to you
and if you do not find a way
no one will
then i know what i must do
its just
im afraid to do it
even the smallest person can change
the course of the future
do you know how the orcs first came into being
they were elves once
taken by the dark powers
tortured and mutilated
a ruined and terrible form of life
and now
perfected
my fighting urukhai
whom do you serve
saruman
hunt them down do not stop until they are found
you do not know pain
you do not know fear
you will taste manflesh
one of the halflings carries
something of great value
bring them to me alive and unspoiled
kill the others
never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people
may these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes
lembas
elvish waybread
one small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man
how many did you eat
four
every league you travel south
the danger will increase
mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the anduin
nor will you find safety on the western bank
strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders
seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun yet these have done so
le aphadar aen
you are being tracked
by river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of rauros
my gift for you legolas is a bow of the galadhrim
worthy of the skill of our woodland kin
these are the daggers of the noldorin
they have already seen service in war
do not fear young peregrin took
you will find your courage
and for you samwise gamgee
elven rope made of hithlain
thank you my lady
have you run out of those nice shiny daggers
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves
nothing
except to look upon the lady
of the galadhrim one last time
for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth
actually
there was one thing
no no i couidnt
its quite impossible
stupid to ask
i have nothing greater to give
than the gift you already bear
am meleth dîn
for her love
i ant e guil arwen undómiel pígatha
i fear the grace of arwen evenstar will diminish
aníron i e broniatha ad ae periatham
i would have her leave these shores
athar i methid enamar hen
and be with her people
aníron i e círatha na valannor
i would have her take the ship to valinor
that choice is yet before her
you have your own choice to make aragorn
to rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of elendil
or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin
namárië
farewell
nadath nâ i moe cerich
there is much you have yet to do
dan úeveditham elessar
we shall not meet again elessar
farewell frodo baggins
i give you the light of earendil
our most beloved star
may it be a light for you in dark places
when all other lights go out
i have taken my worst wound at this parting
having looked my last upon that which is fairest
henceforth i will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me
what was her gift
i asked her for one hair from her golden head
she gave me three
gollum he has tracked us since moria
i had hoped we would lose him on the river
but hes too clever a waterman
and if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts
it will make the crossing even more dangerous
have some food mr frodo
no sam
you havent eaten anything all day
youre not sleeping neither
dont think i havent noticed
mr frodo
im all right
but youre not
im here to help you
i promised gandalf that i would
you cant help me sam
not this time
get some sleep
minas tirith is the safer road
you know that
from there we can regroup
strike out for mordor from a place of strength
there is no strength in gondor that can avail us
you were quick enough to trust the elves
have you so little faith in your own people
yes there is weakness
there is frailty
but there is courage also
and honor to be found in men
but you will not see that
you are afraid
all your life you have hidden in the shadows
scared of who you are of what you are
i will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city
frodo
the argonath
long have i desired to look upon the kings of old
my kin
we cross the lake at nightfall
hide the boats and continue on foot
we approach mordor from the north
oh yes
just a simple matter of finding
our way through emyn muil
an impassable labyrinth of razorsharp rocks
and after that it gets even better
festering stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see
that is our road
i suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength master dwarf
recover my
we should leave now
no
orcs patrol the eastern shore
we must wait for cover of darkness
it is not the eastern shore that worries me
a shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind
something draws near
i can feel it
recover strength
pay no heed to that young hobbit
wheres frodo
none of us should wander alone
you least of all
so much depends on you
frodo
i know why you seek solitude
you suffer i see it day by day
you sure you do not suffer needlessly
there are other ways frodo
other paths that we might take
i know what you would say
it would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart
warningagainst what
were all afraid frodo
but to let that fear drive us
to destroy what hope we have
dont you see that is madness
there is no other way
i ask only for the strength to defend my people
if you would but lend me the ring
no
why do you recoil i am no thief
you are not yourself
what chance do you think you have
they will find you
they will take the ring
and you will beg for death before the end
you fool
it is not yours save by unhappy chance
it could have been mine
it should be mine give it to me
give it to me
no
give it to me
no
i see your mind
you will take the ring to sauron
you will betray us
youll go to your death and the death of us all
curse you
curse you and all the halflings
frodo

then you did what i could not
i tried to take the ring from him
the ring is beyond our reach now
forgive me
i did not see it
i have failed you all
no boromir
you fought bravely
you have kept your honor
leave it
it is over
the world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness
and my city to ruin
i do not know what strength is in my blood
but i swear to you i will
not let the white city fall
nor our people fail
our people
our people
i would have followed you my brother
my captain
my king
be at peace
son of gondor
they will look for his coming from the white tower
but he will not return
frodo
i wish the ring had never come to me
i wish none of this had happened
so do all who live to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
all you have to decide
is what to do with the time that is given to you
frodo no

a promise
dont you leave him samwise gamgee
and i dont mean to
i dont mean to
oh sam
come on
hurry frodo and sam have
reached the eastern shore
you mean not to follow them
frodos fate is no longer in our hands
then it has all been in vain
the fellowship has failed
not if we hold true to each other
we will not abandon merry and
pippin to torment and death
not while we have strength left
leave all that can be spared behind
we travel light
let us hunt some orc
yes
mordor
i hope the others find a safer road
strider will look after them
