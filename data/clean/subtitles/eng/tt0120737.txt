realm lord celeborn galadriel lady light
enemy knows entered
hope secrecy gone
eight yet nine set rivendell
tell gandalf
much desire speak
longer see afar
gandalf grey pass borders land
fallen shadow
taken shadow flame
balrog morgoth
went needlessly net moria
needless none deeds gandalf life
yet know full purpose
let great emptiness khazaddûm fill heart
gimli son gloin
world grown full peril
lands
love mingled grief
becomes fellowship
without gandalf hope lost
quest stands upon edge knife
stray little fail
ruin
yet hope remains company true
let hearts troubled go rest
weary sorrow much toil
tonight sleep
welcome frodo shire
one seen eye
lament gandalf
say
heart tell
grief still near
bet dont mention fireworks
verse
finest rockets ever seen
burst stars blue green
thunder silver showers
came falling like rain flowers
oh doesnt justice long road
take rest
borders wellprotected
find rest
heard voice inside head
spoke father fall gondor
said even hope left
see
long since hope
father noble man
rule failing
people lose faith
looks make things right would
would see glory gondor restored
ever seen aragorn
white tower ecthelion
glimmering like spike pearl silver
banners caught high morning breeze
ever called home
clear ringing silver trumpets
seen white city

offer freely
deny heart greatly desired
place dark lord would queen
dark beautiful terrible dawn
treacherous sea
stronger foundations earth

never clad strangers garb people
may cloaks help shield unfriendly eyes
lembas
elvish waybread
one small bite enough fill stomach grown man
many eat
