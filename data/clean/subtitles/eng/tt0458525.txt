how did you do that
you know power of persuasion is a gift
i see
do you uh have those powers over me
well you didnt stay in the car did you
why is the moon so lonely
why
because she used to have a lover
you tell this to the kids
no
his name was kuekuatsheu and they lived
in the spirit world together
ah its a true story
right
and every night
they would wander the skies together
butone of the other spirits
was jealous
trickster one of the moons from south
so he told kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers
he told him to come to our world
and pick up some wild roses
but kuekuatsheu didnt know
that once you leave the spirit world
you can never go back
and every night he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name
but
he can never touch her again
kookookachooka got screwed
kuekuatsheu
means the wolverine
what youre doing logan
kayla
youre not from around here are you
what gave me away
you got an insurance in this place
insurance
no
too bad
well well well

why
you dont call
you dont write
how else am i supposed
to get your attention
i hate to say it james
but frankly im a little disappointed
stay down
tell me something jimmy
was she worth it
when are you gonna figure it out
we are not like them
i am nothing like you
sure you are you just dont know it yet
what do we got
bar fight multiple knife wounds
what is this a joke
the guys fine
where is he
i said where is he
i dont know who he is
i can help you
six years ive been here no one
knew me and then you show up
and the next day shes dead
i tried to warn you
why dont you tell me it was victor
i didnt know
i swear on my sons life
i didnt
victors appetites were
becoming too public
i had to lock him up
he thought id betrayed him
went awol
he said he was coming after all of us
you didnt come to warn me
you came to save your own ass
so whats your plan captain
you cant beat him logan
you know you cant
im gonna find him and kill him
i can give you the tools to defeat him
so we can still save the others
you mean save yourself right
i promise you two things
youll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure
but youll have your revenge
if i come with you im coming for blood
no law no code of conduct
you point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way
when it starts
whatever the reason is
that youre doing this
focus on that
maybe it will help
trust me ive been through worse
no you havent
we are ready
were gonna make you indestructible
but first were gonna have to destroy you
remember what we were
looking for in africa
i remember
well i found it
it helped us create a
metal compound so strong
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything
its called adamantium
i cant put victor down myself logan
to kill him youre gonna have to
embrace the other side
become the animal
lets do this
i almost forgot
i want new ones
what do you want them to say
wolverine
generals
welcome
general munson
today were gonna witness
medical history
today were gonna create weapon x
x
roman numeral ten
we are about to begin bonding
adamantium to weapon xs skeleton
lets begin
were brothers jimmy
logan
body temperature is 108
and rising
why is he thrashing like that
why isnt he sedated
he feels pain just like the rest of us
anaesthesia wont work on him
thats why he had to volunteer
will he survive this
i dont know
son
heartbeats well beyond maximum
blood pressure
260 on 180
he can make it he can make it
victor
i love you
youre not an animal logan
it means
the wolverine
i guess he can die
come on old friend
come back
heart rate rising
adamantium reservoir is depleted
no rejection
procedure completed
we did it
we take him to the island
the island
no
the bonding works
we use his dna for the xi
erase his memory
fry his brain
i think he heard you
lockdown
hunt him down
take his head off
travis

naked man in the barn

i love you
why is the moon so lonely

because she used to have a lover
he can never touch her again

he was better than you
hunting and killing
everythings he was pointin at
quit a few months later myself
couldnt take rounding them up
rounding who up
leave it alone
rounding who up john
hey god damn it john
we hunted our own kind logan
theres a special place in hell
for the things we did
mutants

strykerd say we would
make a difference
protecting people from the bad ones
how are you gonna take
victor down logan
remember that stuff in africa
yeah i remember africa what about it
damn
whatd they do to you

him and zero were real tight
fred dukes
where is he

trying to help you out logan
dukes dont like you that much
and you know it
the feeling is mutual
use those gloves man

allow him to let his anger out on you
i figure if you do that he might
tell you everything you wanna know

big old ass comin out of
the front of his shirt

but none of their weaknesses
you really hate them dont you
no i dont hate them
after 20 years of working with them
i just know what they can do
if we win this war before it starts
and save countless lives in the process
preemptive action is
the only action here general
the days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over
we need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us
i admire your passion i do
thank you
but this is as far as it goes
weapon x was a a hickup
we know about your son bill
we know hes a mutant
and we know he killed your wife
you shouldnt have kept that from us
that
that has nothing to do with my work
bullshit
youre too close to this
im sure you know it
youre right
ii wont lie to you
my son did bring the problem home for me
but i took an oath
to protect the american people
from every threat
both foreign
and domestic
you dont like flying huh
im fine
just concentrate on
what youre doing
you sure you got a bit of
sweat on your brow there
very funny just keep your eyes on the
on the what clouds

yes colonel
logan
welcome back to the war
before i gut you
i wanna know why
i needed your powers
for the pool
for the what
a mutant killer
the dead pool
years of searching him to find him
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart
my son was the first piece of the puzzle
logan you are the last
you made weapon xi possible
i
i asked you to help but
you said you wanted the quiet life
well
ive learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge
who are you
oh shes a real old friend
do you really think wed
just let you walk away
you are a dangerous man
i like to keep an eye on dangerous men
tell him about the
day you died
they gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide
it reduces the heart rate so low
it appears you flatline
dont be angry with her
real credit
to your species
did you know that her sister
has diamondhard skin
kaylas mutation
is tactohypnosis
she can influence people as
long as she touches them
quite a useful tool in the seduction
it was never real my friend
it was real for me
i told you if you came down this road
you wouldnt like what youd found
that story you told me
about man who gets flowers for the moon
i had it backwards
i thought you were the moon
and i was your wolverine
but you were the trickster arent you
i am just the fool that got played
the worst part of this is
i should have known
but i ignored my instincts
i ignored what i really am
well that will never happen again
colonel
not now kayla
i have done everything youve asked
my sister
you said that if i help you
youd let her go
kayla its not as simple as that
her mutation is unique
quite beautiful
we just need a little more time
to analyze it thats all
you let him go
victor please
you cant let him go
you cant beat him victor
give me the adamantium
tests came out
we had a deal
you would never survive the operation
i can take anything he can
no you cant
you are my favorite soldier victor
