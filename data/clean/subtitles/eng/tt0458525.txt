because she used to have a lover 
  you tell this to the kids 
  no 
his name was kuekuatsheu and they lived
in the spirit world together 
ah  it s a true story 
right 
and every night 
they would wander the skies together 
but   one of the other spirits
was jealous 
trickster  one of the moons from south 
so he told kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers 
he told him to come to our world
and pick up some wild roses 
but kuekuatsheu didn t know
that once you leave the spirit world 
you can never go back 
and every night  he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name 
but   
   he can never touch her again 
koo koo kachooka got screwed 
kuekuatsheu 
means the wolverine 
what you re doing  logan

  i tried to warn you 
  why don t you tell me it was victor 
  i didn t know 
i swear on my son s life 
i didn t   
victor s appetites were
becoming too public 
i had to lock him up 
he thought i d betrayed him 
went awol 
he said he was coming after all of us 
you didn t come to warn me 
you came to save your own ass 
so what s your plan  captain 
you can t beat him  logan 
you know you can t 
i m gonna find him and kill him 
i can give you the tools to defeat him 
  so we can still save the others 
  you mean save yourself  right 
i promise you two things 
you ll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure 
but you ll have your revenge 
if i come with you  i m coming for blood 
no law  no code of conduct 
you point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way 
when it starts 
whatever the reason is
that you re doing this 
focus on that 
maybe it will help 
trust me  i ve been through worse 
no  you haven t 
we are ready 
we re gonna make you indestructible 
but first  we re gonna have to destroy you 
remember what we were
looking for in africa 
i remember 
well  i found it 
it helped us create a   
metal compound so strong
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything 
it s called adamantium 
i can t put victor down myself  logan 
to kill him  you re gonna have to
embrace the other side 
become the animal 
let s do this 
i almost forgot 
i want new ones 
what do you want them to say 
wolverine 
generals 
welcome 
general munson 
today  we re gonna witness
medical history 
  today  we re gonna create weapon x 
  x 
roman numeral  ten 
we are about to begin bonding
adamantium to weapon x s skeleton
let s begin 
  we re brothers  jimmy 
  logan 
body temperature is 1 0 8
and rising 
why is he thrashing like that 
why isn t he sedated 
he feels pain  just like the rest of us 
anaesthesia won t work on him 
that s why he had to volunteer 
195 
  will he survive this 
  i don t know 
200 
   son 
heartbeat s well beyond maximum 
  blood pressure 
  260 on 180 
he can make it  he can make it 
victor 
i love you

it means   
the wolverine 
i guess he can die 
come on  old friend 
come back 
heart rate rising 
adamantium reservoir is depleted 
no rejection 
procedure completed 
we did it 
we take him to the island 
the island

the bonding works 
we use his dna for the xi 
erase his memory 
fry his brain 
i think he heard you 
lockdown 
hunt him down 
take his head off 
travis

  why 
because she used to have a lover 
he can never touch her again

back there 
innocent people 
it s funny how good innocent people
tend to die around you 
zero never stood a chance 
the only thing that ll take him down
is an adamantium bullet
this facility is compromised 
prep transport 
colonel  this is turning into a disaster 
  don t worry  we ll stop him 
  really 
you ve just spent half a billion
dollars making him indestructible 
  sir 
  yes 
the young mutant you ve been looking for 
we found him 
general  logan isn t the only
piece in this puzzle 
i need to evacuate this facility 
please  go back to washington

yo hablo  i talk 
tu hablas  you talk  el habla 
somebody translate 
summers

but victor  he had to prove you
he was better than you 
hunting and killing
everything s he was pointin  at 
quit a few months later myself 
couldn t take rounding them up 
  rounding who up 
  leave it alone 
rounding who up  john 
hey  god damn it  john 
we hunted our own kind  logan 
there s a special place in hell
for the things we did 
mutants 
why 
stryker d say we would
make a difference 
protecting people from the bad ones 
how are you gonna take
victor down  logan 
  remember that stuff in africa 
  yeah  i remember africa  what about it 
damn 
what d they do to you

  him and zero were real tight 
  fred dukes 
  where is he 
  he s here 
  well  let s go talk to him 
  hold on 
he don t get in until around four

i got an idea 
  this is your idea of an idea 
  trying to help you out  logan 
dukes don t like you that much 
and you know it 
the feeling is mutual 
use those gloves  man 
dance with him a little bit 
allow him to let his anger out on you 
i figure if you do that  he might
tell you everything you wanna know 
come on  man  look at him 
big old ass comin  out of
the front of his shirt 
jesus  he s gonna have a coronary
for christ s sake 
is there even a stretcher big enough

you re an asshole 
whoop his ass 
  let me have it 
  if you want 
be careful with this 
you wanna dance with me 
oh  oh  that feels good 
hey  guess what

goddamn experiment 
where is it 
logan  stryker kept it real secret 
but   
  a prisoner escaped there once 
  who 
his name is remy lebeau

 cause he kept taking all their
money at poker  that s all i know 
what s stryker up to fred

he s taking their powers 
trying to combine them somehow

you really want to kill  em 
as long as you stay
out of my way  yeah 
colonel 
general 
is this weapon xi 
all their strenghts
but none of their weaknesses 
you really hate them  don t you 
no  i don t hate them 
after 20 years of working with them 
i just know what they can do 
if we win this war before it starts 
and save countless lives in the process 
preemptive action is
the only action here  general 
the days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over 
we need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us 
  i admire your passion  i do 
  thank you 
but this is as far as it goes 
weapon x was a    a hickup 
we know about your son  bill 
we know he s a mutant 
and we know he killed your wife 
you shouldn t have kept that from us 
that   
  that has nothing to do with my work 
  bullshit 
you re too close to this 
i m sure you know it 
you re right 
i   i won t lie to you 
my son did bring the problem home for me 
but i took an oath   
to protect the american people
from every threat 
both foreign
   and domestic 
  you don t like flying  huh 
  i m fine 
just concentrate on
what you re doing 
you sure  you got a bit of
sweat on your brow there 
  very funny  just keep your eyes on the   
  on the what  clouds 
we re jumpin  up and down
like a freakin  yoyo here 
where did you get this thing anyway 
oh  this is my baby 
i won her in a game 
  jacks over fives 
  great 
relax  we re almost there 
there it is    the island 
three mile island 
hiding in plain sight 
no one s gonna sneak around
a nuclear reactor 
they think it s gonna turn them into freaks 
like you 
right 
all right  you ready 
cause it s now or never 
let s go 
about time 
hey  if it s make you feel any better 
this is really gonna hurt 
oh yeah  it kind of does actually 
good luck 
likewise 
oh shit 
how are you doing 
is everything alright 
  is he ready yet 
  a few hours 
he will respond to my commands 
yes  colonel 
logan 
welcome back to the war 
before i gut you 
i wanna know why 
i needed your powers
for the pool 
for the what 
a mutant killer 
the dead pool 
years of searching him  to find him 
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart 
my son was the first piece of the puzzle 
logan  you are the last 
you made weapon xi possible 
i   
i asked you to help but   
you said you wanted the quiet life 
well   
i ve learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge 
who are you 
oh she s a real old friend 
do you really think we d
just let you walk away 
you are a dangerous man 
i like to keep an eye on dangerous men 
tell him about the
day you died 
they gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide 
it reduces the heart rate so low 
it appears you flatline 
don t be angry with her 
real credit   
to your species 
did you know that her sister
has diamond hard skin 
kayla s mutation
is tacto hypnosis 
she can influence people as
