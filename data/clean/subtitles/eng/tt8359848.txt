who are no longer with us
you have seen a film based on real events
that happened in france in winter 1996
existence is a fleeting illusion
what does dance mean to you 
everything 
dance is everything 
it s all i have 
if you couldn t dance 
what would you do 
suicide 
when you re on stage dancing   
you feel free  no barriers 
no judgement 
just us  our body and sensations 
i find marijuana is a great muscle relaxant 
so when you dance
the sensations are a bit different 
you re more sensitive   
with certain muscles  or sensations 
when i dance  i can be someone
i can t be anywhere else 
ok 
is your family supportive 
yes 
mum  dad  everyone   
they know what you dance 
yes 
do they come to watch 
no 
i prefer not 
what would they say 
they d be a bit shocked 
would you do anything to make it 
meaning 
you re in a profession where   
you need to bring enjoyment   
i m ready for anything 
what s anything 
everything 
i don t know what you ll ask me to do
but i m primed
and honestly  it s a chance in a million
to work with a choreographer like you 
it could really help me evolve 
so i m ready for anything 
i can ask you anything 
anything 
my worst nightmare 
to find myself alone 
with nothing and no one around 
alone 
do you have a life motto 
 what doesn t kill you makes you stronger  
do you believe in paradise 
yes 
why 
because i want to 
what s in paradise 
everything good 
meaning 
only good things  no problems 
there s no chaos there 
i am from berlin 
but i m happy to leave 
it became too much 
the art scene there is too much
i really want to do what i love 
without    being fucked up 
there s a lot of drugs in berlin 
it s too much 
my ex roommate 
i don t talk to him anymore   
before i moved out 
he started to take acid in his eyes 
like actual drops 
so i decided to get away
from all that  because   
i don t want to
end up like christiane f 
i like to let off steam   
i have my secret garden that i   
i like to go to when i party 
i tried a line of coke once 
you asked me to be open so   
yeah  i snorted a line with a girlfriend 
my worst nightmare 
my worst nightmare 
i m real scared of darkness 
really scared 
you know  when you do your own thing 
it s make or break 
and in my experience  it s mostly break 
i wade right in 
if there s a problem 
i deal with it then move on 
what s the worst
you ve done to a guy in a fight 
i smashed a head once 
knocked two of his teeth out 
he had a big gash in his forehead 
he passed out 
two days in a coma 
do you regret it 
not really  that s life 
do you do drugs 
no  never 
no drugs  i m more into girls 
what do you think of the other dancers 
some look good 
it all seems good 
meaning 
some of the girls are hot 
your cousin s your partner in crime 
yeah  we pick up girls together 
and guys 
guys  well   
guys    it depends 
straight up  i ve never worked with gays before 
i m a little nervous  but   
it s no big deal   
i m just waiting for the first connection 
i ve heard things but want to see for myself 
for sure  i m a bit nervous about it 
but i like that  feeling the fear 
being brother and sister  we re close of course 
but with dance we share an activity that   
keeps us close 
we ll be touring france and the states 
what do you think 
i ve been to new york so   
wow  that s awesome 
we ve never been to the us together 
yes  i ve been to new york 
oh 
with who 
the us is the place to go 
and for black culture too  it s great 
america 
america   
it s heaven on earth 
you ve been there 
never 
i come from hell 
where is hell 
we re lucky in france to really shine in dance 
it s incredible 
it would be interesting
to take that to other countries 
like america or places where   
the level s not so high 
france is a country that really has our back 
helping us  with its culture 
and music 
which really lets us   
flourish and   
work with a level of excellence 
it s the french trademark 
present a french film and proud of it
god is with us 
now let s party 
i love your kid 
my tito 
great dancer

we hit lucky here   
bro  omar

david  he s a ticket to an std 
that s mean 
he s my buddy 
he s nice  but   
he should   
i bet he has herpes 
he s dirty 
just the way he looks at you   
cut it out 
it can be a turn on 
ok  he s a sonofabitch 
he has his charms 
is he a good lay at least 
a top shooter 
sometimes they make out like   
no  really 
have you two screwed 
no  but he s banged
someone next to me 
a young chick   
you gang bang 
he fucked her brains out 
tell me about gazelle 
just a little 
i m curious

just a little  no details if she s ass or pussy 
just    how nuts she goes 
you live your life  i live mine 
your life is mine as well 
get off my case 
i don t get it  i m reacting

what makes omar special 
everything 
oh yeah 
he s got everything 
know what 
i wanna bone her 
i m not surprised 
honestly  i wanna bone her 
you re a lucky man 
you re not as tough as me 
so  let s ask her 
maybe we can do a threesome 
you say   it s the last night 
 everything sucks 
 the sex   
 it s not like before   
 nowadays  group sex is the thing  all that stuff  
and we do it 
what bugs you 
seeing you together 
i don t like him 
we may seem buddies but we re not 
so what 
i m your big brother 
i m 20  not a baby anymore 
so 
you disrespect me 
he seems totally uptight 
only with you 
say what 
what it says 
you re not my mum or dad 
just my big brother 
so 
you re 25  i m 20  an adult 
but you re   
still too young for that 
for what 
what you do with omar 
you know what we do 
i see enough 
no need for details 
you ve had your dick sucked already 
so 
that doesn t mean you can suck his   
any time you like 
that s not how it goes 
it s normal when
you ve been together 9 months  no 
9 months  you two 
he didn t tell you 
no 
think it s funny 
this place has seen some weird shit 
i can feel it 
sacrifices    strange shit  for sure 
you mean like a sect 
all that stuff 
how can you walk in a room
and see a flag like that 
no way 
no way 
i don t dig the vibe in this group 
they re weird 
and this school   
intensifies it 
it magnifies the sense of weirdness 
weird or not   
i ll fuck them all 
straight up 
weird or not  i fuck them 
true   
even if the ghost turns up 
on the flag 
we ll fuck him on the flag 
ghost or no  he ll get some 
i m sick of all the
fathers and brothers
on our case all the time 
telling us what to do 
who you can or can t see  enough already 
there s more to life than men 
too right 
there are girls   
nice ones too  huh
