who are no longer with us
you have seen a film based on real events
that happened in france in winter 1996
existence is a fleeting illusion
what does dance mean to you
everything
dance is everything
its all i have
if you couldnt dance
what would you do
suicide
when youre on stage dancing
you feel free no barriers
no judgement
just us our body and sensations
i find marijuana is a great muscle relaxant
so when you dance
the sensations are a bit different
youre more sensitive
with certain muscles or sensations
when i dance i can be someone
i cant be anywhere else
ok
is your family supportive
yes
mum dad everyone
they know what you dance
yes
do they come to watch
no
i prefer not
what would they say
theyd be a bit shocked
would you do anything to make it
meaning
youre in a profession where
you need to bring enjoyment
im ready for anything
whats anything
everything
i dont know what youll ask me to do
but im primed
and honestly its a chance in a million
to work with a choreographer like you
it could really help me evolve
so im ready for anything
i can ask you anything
anything
my worst nightmare
to find myself alone
with nothing and no one around
alone
do you have a life motto
what doesnt kill you makes you stronger
do you believe in paradise
yes
why
because i want to
whats in paradise
everything good
meaning
only good things no problems
theres no chaos there
i am from berlin
but im happy to leave
it became too much
the art scene there is too much
i really want to do what i love
without being fucked up
theres a lot of drugs in berlin
its too much
my exroommate
i dont talk to him anymore
before i moved out
he started to take acid in his eyes
like actual drops
so i decided to get away
from all that because
i dont want to
end up like christiane f
i like to let off steam
i have my secret garden that i
i like to go to when i party
i tried a line of coke once
you asked me to be open so
yeah i snorted a line with a girlfriend
my worst nightmare
my worst nightmare
im real scared of darkness
really scared
you know when you do your own thing
its make or break
and in my experience its mostly break
i wade right in
if theres a problem
i deal with it then move on
whats the worst
youve done to a guy in a fight
i smashed a head once
knocked two of his teeth out
he had a big gash in his forehead
he passed out
two days in a coma
do you regret it
not really thats life
do you do drugs
no never
no drugs im more into girls
what do you think of the other dancers
some look good
it all seems good
meaning
some of the girls are hot
your cousins your partner in crime
yeah we pick up girls together
and guys
guys well
guys it depends
straight up ive never worked with gays before
im a little nervous but
its no big deal
im just waiting for the first connection
ive heard things but want to see for myself
for sure im a bit nervous about it
but i like that feeling the fear
being brother and sister were close of course
but with dance we share an activity that
keeps us close
well be touring france and the states
what do you think
ive been to new york so
wow thats awesome
weve never been to the us together
yes ive been to new york
oh
with who
the us is the place to go
and for black culture too its great
america
america
its heaven on earth
youve been there
never
i come from hell
where is hell
were lucky in france to really shine in dance
its incredible
it would be interesting
to take that to other countries
like america or places where
the levels not so high
france is a country that really has our back
helping us with its culture
and music
which really lets us
flourish and
work with a level of excellence
its the french trademark
present a french film and proud of it
god is with us
now lets party
i love your kid
my tito
great dancer
can i dance with him
go ahead i made some sangria
later
what did you think
awesome

but youre
still too young for that
for what
what you do with omar
you know what we do
i see enough
no need for details
youve had your dick sucked already

that doesnt mean you can suck his
any time you like
thats not how it goes

on the flag
