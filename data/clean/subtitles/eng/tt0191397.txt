i can t believe that martel
goes for a give up slide
 it did look cautious
 i could have scored on that 
it may be the lastplay
of the season 
the player s strike became official    
   at 4 p m  eastern time 
i m sad that the players   demands 
which center around    
   a rise in the current salary cap 
were rejected by the owners 
i have told my union brothers to walk 
get me jimmy mcginty 
have him here tonight
yes  sir
i m here with eddie martel 
a lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy 
any comments 
dwight  i know  5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money   
   but i have to pay 10  to my agent 
5  to my lawyer  
do you know what insurance costs
on a ferrari  mother  
pat  back to you 
that was washington running back
malcolm lamont
it s all about money  folks 
but isn t it always 
yes  this is pat summerall
for john madden saying   
   so long from nextel stadium 
 you look like shit
 i m dying  jimmy
come on
you ve been dying for 20 years
 give me a cigarette

looks like a largemouth bass
i m too old to screw around
let me give it to you straight
i want you back

 i ll take care of it
 like you took care of me
 now  jimmy
your players all flew home
to their castles
in their private jets
we re gonna finish
the season anyway
i m gonna use replacement players
 jeez  what a business
 we got 4 games left
we win three  we re in the playoffs
really  win three out of four
with replacement players 
that s not too much to ask
you won for me once 
you can do it again
what s the matter  jimmy 
nobody s gonna give you
a better chance than this
after that dallas mess
 i was right about that
 it had nothing to do with being right 
went head to head with
an  8 million quarterback
who did you think was gonna win 
that s not gonna happen here 
i m talking about a team of poor
nobodies who play to win
not a bunch of bitchy millionaires
come on  jimmy 
i m thinking
hello 
hello 
i want total control of my team
i want to be able to recruit anybody
that i want  no interference
my word is my bond
i want it in writing
okay  jimmy
okay
we thought we d skip special teams
for now
it ll be tough enough to put
together a team in a week
 we re gonna go a different way
 a different way 
here s a list of people i ve
been watching over the years
they ve all played football 
not all of them in the pros
but they all have something
unique to bring
we ll take them and try to
put together a winning team
if nothing else  they should
be fun to watch
daniel bateman  swat team officer
awarded a purple heart for losing

you re jimmy mcginty
that old coach from the  80s
we met just before the sugar bowl
i remember
hell of a game  that sugar bowl
 what d you lose that by  40 points 
 that would be 45
a game like that sticks with you
you never shake it off

 that s why girls don t play
why are you here  coach 
back with the sentinels
i want you as quarterback
i found the best guards
and a wide receiver
even you couldn t overthrow
 i m retired
 retired 
it looks like things have gone
real well for you since
i got no complaints
it s quiet here
nobody bothers me
the great thing about plankton is 
it pretty much keeps to itself
you know what separates the winners
from the losers 
the score
getting back up after being
kicked in the teeth
i watched films of your games
since the sugar bowl
you shouldn t have been trying to
carry the whole team that first year
your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled
 is that how you want to be remembered 
 i don t want to be remembered at all
if you do well  who knows what ll
happen after the strike
i m not making you any promises 
but why don t you take a chance 
rather than scraping crap off
the bottom of somebody else s toys 
think it over
you could be part of something
football fans  what the owners are
doing is absolutely unconscionable
they have blatantly hired scabs
which goes against our constitution 
the declaration of independence   
   and the emancipation proclamation 
here come the scabs now

quarterback who fell out of sight

beatings he took in seattle 
one thing we do know is that
falco can take a hit
well  i ll tell you  he s sure
had a lot of practice at it 
ladies and gentlemen 
your washington sentinels 
 did you see that

i used to cry
and now i hold my head up high
and you see me

okay  all right
frankie
if anything like this bar fight

there ll be no place
on the team for any of you

i think the whole town heard
about that
is that from the game or the fight 
i m not sure it s all blurred
into one big beating
the good news is 
you guys got into a rhythm
apart from that vomiting thing 
which was on sports center 
oh  god
after that 
the team was really clicking
yeah  it was starting
to come together
yeah
 you want to sit down

thanks for coming by

 cold 
 sorry  sorry

missing for a really long time
it s a good thing you did last night
it was just stupid
thanks

 on three  fellas
 we got this we got this
 you want to put the car back

ready to go to practice 
yeah  let s do that
 how s that arm 
 good
what s that smell 
wild yam
 that s nice
 you like that 
and so  boys and girls 
if anybody does have any firearms   
   you need to turn them in
as soon as possible 
no questions asked
understood 
all right
okay  coach  it s all yours
last sunday  i saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could
to win the football game
we lost not because
of effort or desire
but because of lack of leadership
and trust one s been resolved
but leadership means nothing if
we don t believe in each other
players spend years together
before they develop trust
i m asking you to do it in a week 
not reasonable but
these aren t reasonable times
i know you all have concerns
about this sunday
but a real man
admits his fears
i m asking you
to do that here  tonight
who wants to start 
let s talk about fears
fears fears
i m scared of spiders  coach
 that s not what i meant
 i m afraid of spiders too
goddamn spiders freak me  too  fellas
well  i didn t mean that  
ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm 
 crawling on you 
 damn 
thanks  jumbo you can just
rock me to sleep tonight
okay  that s great  but i m talking
about what scares us on the field
like spiders on the field 
can we get beyond the spiders  please 
bees
bees 
 bees 
 bees
anybody here afraid of anything
other than insects 
come on
quicksand
shit  yeah 
quicksand s a scary mother  man
it sucks you right in and even
if you scream  you get that muck  
i don t think that s it
that s not what he had in mind
 what s he talking about  then 
 ask him
what s up  shane 
you re playing
and you think everything is going
fine but then one thing goes wrong
and another
and another
you try to fight back  but the harder
you fight  the deeper you sink
until you can t move
you can t breathe
because you re in over your head
like quicksand
that s some deep shit
some deep shit
anything else 
 going back to the mini mart
 the shipping yard
the auto plant
prison
yeah  all right
the truth is  you guys have been
given something
that every athlete dreams of
a second chance
and you re afraid of blowing it
we all are
but now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together
let s lose that fear this sunday
and put it into san diego 
come on 
another vicious hit by
the all pro hank morris 
that s his third of the game 
it s just me  dickhead
i tell you  he is really putting
a hurt on falco 
i m not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take
huddle up 
huddle up 
same play  except let morris by
nobody touch him
 it s 16 0 already
 i said let him through 
get some penetration  morris 
get some penetration 
blue  88 
now  that is a hit 
holy shit 
let s haul ass  round boy 
follow me  follow me 
holy shit  holy shit 
go 
jump on his back 
here it comes  i m coming through 
jump on his back 
fumiko scores  fumiko scores 
i love to see a fat guy score 
why 
because you get a fat guy spike 
and then you get a fat guy dance 
pork rice 
that s not in the playbook
yeah
maybe we should put it in
kickoff 
so  annabelle  what do you  like 
think of our friends 
i think
they re friendly
i know  aren t they 
yeah

mcginty s gonna let gruff try
this field goal from 65 yards out

smoking  i m sure you
just imagined that 
no  i saw the smoke and everything 
vito  look who s on tv 
he wants to keep his pub 
he s gonna stop blowing some kicks 
i m telling you  that s him
it s straight enough 
if it s got the distance    
it has the distance  it s good 
washington wins 
the 65 yard field goal attempt
is good by nigel gruff 
final score

he was the biggest washington fan
you have ever seen
other kids got bedtime stories

i wish he was here
to see you guys play
 i don t know about that

yeah
you coming to the game on sunday 
no  we don t travel with the team
can i see you when i get back 
sure
good night  annabelle
good night
 what do you do here  john 
 you go for it  you have to 
but falco s been shut down
by this defense all afternoon 
but i ll tell you this 
all it takes   
   is one big play to get him
back in the ball game 
and here goes falco 
falco scores  falco scores 
here s falco he ll try to reverse
pivot  turn and pitch out here
but in doing so  his left guard 
andre jackson  is going to pull
and falco will hit him with
the ball in the back
then it s gonna flop
around the ground
here comes cochran  he ll kick it
franklin s gonna pick it up
franklin s gonna get hit right here
the ball will go flying in the air
falco will pick it up
and the guy who started the play 
falco
will end up with it
in the end zone for a touchdown 
 welcome to strike football
 and the fabulous falco
if they can win against dallas   
   they ll do what washington
hasn t done in over seven years 
get to the playoffs 
call time out  time out 
time out 
time out washington 
franklin  come here 
come here  come on
i had it  
shut up give me the stick em
 that s illegal
 think you ll go to football jail 
now  you know this don t look natural
don t talk we ll run the same play
you ll catch the ball
i look like i jacked off
an elephant 
say you understand
i understand
go out there and catch the ball
for a change  all right 
damn  this cup is stuck 
gonna need some time on this one
here we go same play
pro right switch 9  
franklin franklin 
i can t get the damn cup off 
you can do this
it s one on one ready 
ready 
blue 89 
blue 89 
and franklin catches the ball 
who would ve thought 
he never catches a ball 
but he caught the ball 
that makes the score 21 to 20 
conventional wisdom says kick
the extra point  tie the game   
   and go into overtime  especially
with the playoffs on the line 
but jimmy mcginty is anything
but a conventional guy
and mcginty says go for it
let s go for the win 
i need a receiver 
4 22 y cross  okay 
we gotta have it  gotta have it 
ready  go  ready 
this kind of situation has not been
falco s strong point in the past 
falco rolls to his left and throws   
   right into the defender s hands 
and he drops it right into the unsure
hands of clifford franklin 
washington wins 
what a lucky break for shane falco 
who threw a bad pass   
that could ve blown the game
for washington
get over it
it s a win
better lucky than good 
right
shane falco
 great game out there today
 thanks
to what do you attribute this team s
sudden rise over these past few weeks 
you know  you should talk to franklin
he s the hero today
clifford franklin
terrific day today
yeah  today was a good day
for clifford franklin
clifford franklin can t wait
till tomorrow
clifford franklin gets
better looking every day
we re beginning to scratch the surface
of the talents of clifford franklin
clifford franklin has moves even
clifford franklin ain t seen yet
you showed us a few moves
today against phoenix
but it could be a different story
against dallas
that s the same story 
different chapter
the football is like a one man cold
to clifford franklin
clifford franklin s the only one
catching it and coming down with it
cheers  babe
i think we got it
 what are you up to 
 what 
i can t get excited about
the future of my team 
okay  okay  i got some great news
martel and carr have crossed
the picket line
with a deal i made them swallow 
i can t not take them back
no
no what 
i m sticking with falco
jimmy  come on
have you read the newspaper 
the entire dallas team has crossed
the picket line
thanksgiving night we play
the world champions
we have a deal
no interference with my coaching
as long as the strike is on 
falco is my quarterback
we have to beat dallas
to get into the playoffs
falco can t do that
you saw what happened yesterday
jesus christ 
do you think he ll have
that luck against dallas too 
 they ll murder him 
 he s just getting his game back
he falls apart when the game
is on the line 
that s been his rap
ever since the sugar bowl
21 other men put their faith in you to
lead them they d be heartbroken
if you abandoned them before
the biggest game of their lives
you really are a son of a bitch 
you know that 
what are you doing 
don t want to make the same mistake
i did in phoenix
we might end up in that situation
with dallas
they like to send their safeties
put the pressure on
yeah  coach 
it s over
martel crossed
i m sorry
  chokes with the game on the line  
ls that what o neil said 
it s okay
it s better for the team  right 
i mean  martel

he doesn t have heart
you do
it s been a privilege
thanks for believing
you give them hell on thursday
i just wanted to tell you
before you left
i m sorry
 thanks
 no  really
i think it s terrible
what they do to you guys
they make you believe that
you re better than you really are
then they pull the rug
out from under you
the cruelest thing that they can give
guys like you
is hope
you re a real class act  martel
a real class act
she deserves better
you re a sinking ship
don t drag her down with you
take care of my guys

welcome back to nextel stadium
in our nation s capital 
i m pat summerall and with me
as always is john madden
it appears that the strike
is coming to a close
martel will be resuming
the quarterback position tonight 
i gotta admit  i was looking forward
to seeing what falco could do   
    with one more game  he made
amazing progress the past few weeks   
   under the tutelage
of jimmy mcginty 
he really did 
but tonight it ll be martel leading
washington against dallas 
i never thought i d say this  but    
   l m gonna kind of miss
those replacement games 
bring back falco 
ladies and gentlemen  leading
your washington sentinels today   
    welcome back number 7

this isn t a track meet  asshole
you have to look for the ball 
i ll pull you off the field

my brothers  will somebody please get
this asshole out of here 
get your hands off me  you gorilla 
jimmy mcginty is anything
but a conventional guy
and mcginty says  with the playoffs
on the line  go for it 
get to the playoffs 
something washington   
   has not been able to do
against dallas in seven years 
falco 
what the hell is he up to 
look  here comes falco 
falco s back 
what happened to martel 
i don t know 
but the way falco s running   
   and that look he has in his eye 
he thinks he s gonna play 
i m sorry
they re playing zone
and you can pick them apart
if you keep your eyes open  
he seems to be necking with that
cheerleader  that s what he s doing 
players aren t supposed to be
fraternizing with cheerleaders 
yeah  but what are they gonna do 
fire him 
 you give me strength
 you re late for work
kick ass  falco 
what s all the celebrating about 
we re down 17 to nothing
it s nasty out there
that s why girls
don t play the game  coach
listen up this time tomorrow 
the strike will be officially over
dallas made a big mistake
they haven t been afraid of you
they should be  because you have
a powerful weapon working for you
there is no tomorrow for you
and that makes you all
very dangerous people 
kick ass on one ready 
clifford franklin is
looking for a new ho
ready for some pain 
 bring it on
 it s coming
it s coming
see him coming in motion 
i ve never seen anything like this 
unbelievable 
there s at least five  six flags
out there  hats  everything 
this is what you call
an old fashioned melee
unnecessary roughness 
number 16 and number 34
fifteen yards  so that s  wait
how many yards so far 
who do they think
they re playing here 
come on  let s go  come on 
my knee 
it s my knee

 i m right behind you
we need it  we need it 
a gain of 20 yards by ray smith 
first down 
i know you re tired 
i know you re hurting
i wish i could say something
classy and inspirational
but it wouldn t be our style
pain heals
chicks dig scars
glory lasts forever
right on  shane
right on  baby right on 
shotgun dc right
flip 90 dig  on the center ready 
we  re looking at a different team
here in the second half 
absolutely  washington is playing
like there s no tomorrow   
because there isn t
touchdown  baby 
son of a bitch 
odd bullets  blitz coverage 
daniel bateman comes up with
a big stop on third and one 
that forces a dallas punt 
pat  with 28 seconds remaining 
washington needs a decent return   
   in order to give gruff
a shot to tie the game 
with 12 seconds remaining   
 it s yours  nigel
    a 32 yard field goal    
    will send this game into overtime 
32 yards is just
a chip shot for gruff
you all right 
i m sorry
i had the money but i pissed it
away at the track again
what  what are you talking about 
they ll take my pub away from me
it s all i got
come on  shane 
it s a fake  falco still has it 
he  s running with it 
touchdown  falco 
holding  number 68 on the offense
10 yard penalty repeat first down
what a terrible call 
time out

green 86 
green 86 
touchdown  brian murphy 
i knew it  i knew it all along 
jimmy  you beautiful son of a bitch 
i knew you could do it 
final score 
washington 20  dallas 17 
washington goes to the playoffs 
you did it 
you did it 
when the replacement players
for the sentinels left the stadium   
   there was no ticker tape parade   
   no endorsement deals
for sneakers   
   or soda pop or breakfast cereal 
just a locker to be cleaned out    
   and a ride home to catch 
but what they didn t know   
    was that their lives
would be changed forever   
   because they had been
part of something great
