i cant believe that martel
goes for a giveup slide
it did look cautious
i could have scored on that
it may be the lastplay
of the season
the players strike became official
at 4 pm eastern time
im sad that the players  demands
which center around
a rise in the current salary cap
were rejected by the owners
i have told my union brothers to walk
get me jimmy mcginty
have him here tonight
yes sir
im here with eddie martel
a lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy
any comments
dwight i know 5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money
but i have to pay 10 to my agent
5 to my lawyer
do you know what insurance costs
on a ferrari mother

your players all flew home
to their castles
in their private jets

the season anyway
im gonna use replacement players
jeez what a business
we got 4 games left
we win three were in the playoffs
really win three out of four
with replacement players
thats not too much to ask
you won for me once
you can do it again
whats the matter jimmy
nobodys gonna give you
a better chance than this
after that dallas mess
i was right about that
it had nothing to do with being right
went headtohead with
an 8 million quarterback
who did you think was gonna win
thats not gonna happen here
im talking about a team of poor
nobodies who play to win
not a bunch of bitchy millionaires
come on jimmy
im thinking
hello
hello
i want total control of my team
i want to be able to recruit anybody
that i want no interference
my word is my bond
i want it in writing
okay jimmy
okay
we thought wed skip special teams
for now
itll be tough enough to put
together a team in a week
were gonna go a different way
a different way
heres a list of people ive
been watching over the years
theyve all played football
not all of them in the pros
but they all have something
unique to bring
well take them and try to
put together a winning team
if nothing else they should
be fun to watch
daniel bateman swat team officer
awarded a purple heart for losing
a kidney during the gulf war
a walkon at michigan state

i want you as quarterback
i found the best guards
and a wide receiver
even you couldnt overthrow
im retired
retired
it looks like things have gone
real well for you since
i got no complaints
its quiet here
nobody bothers me
the great thing about plankton is
it pretty much keeps to itself
you know what separates the winners
from the losers
the score
getting back up after being
kicked in the teeth
i watched films of your games
since the sugar bowl
you shouldnt have been trying to
carry the whole team that first year
your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled
is that how you want to be remembered
i dont want to be remembered at all
if you do well who knows whatll
happen after the strike
im not making you any promises
but why dont you take a chance
rather than scraping crap off
the bottom of somebody elses toys
think it over
you could be part of something
football fans what the owners are
doing is absolutely unconscionable
they have blatantly hired scabs
which goes against our constitution
the declaration of independence
and the emancipation proclamation
here come the scabs now

okay coach its all yours
last sunday i saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could
to win the football game
we lost not because
of effort or desire
but because of lack of leadership
and trust ones been resolved
but leadership means nothing if
we dont believe in each other
players spend years together
before they develop trust
im asking you to do it in a week
not reasonable but
these arent reasonable times
i know you all have concerns
about this sunday
but a real man
admits his fears
im asking you
to do that here tonight
who wants to start
lets talk about fears
fears fears
im scared of spiders coach
thats not what i meant
im afraid of spiders too
goddamn spiders freak me too fellas
well i didnt mean that
ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm

falco scores falco scores
heres falco hell try to reverse
pivot turn and pitch out here

youll catch the ball
i look like i jacked off
an elephant

i understand
go out there and catch the ball
for a change all right
damn this cup is stuck
gonna need some time on this one
here we go same play
pro right switch 9
franklin franklin
i cant get the damn cup off
you can do this
its one on one ready
ready
blue 89
blue 89
and franklin catches the ball
who wouldve thought
he never catches a ball
but he caught the ball
that makes the score 21 to 20
conventional wisdom says kick
the extra point tie the game
and go into overtime especially
with the playoffs on the line
but jimmy mcginty is anything
but a conventional guy
and mcginty says go for it
lets go for the win
i need a receiver
422 y cross okay
we gotta have it gotta have it
ready go ready
this kind of situation has not been
falcos strong point in the past
falco rolls to his left and throws
right into the defenders hands
and he drops it right into the unsure
hands of clifford franklin
washington wins
what a lucky break for shane falco
who threw a bad pass
that couldve blown the game
for washington
get over it
its a win
better lucky than good
right
shane falco
great game out there today
thanks
to what do you attribute this teams
sudden rise over these past few weeks
you know you should talk to franklin
hes the hero today
clifford franklin
terrific day today
yeah today was a good day
for clifford franklin
clifford franklin cant wait
till tomorrow
clifford franklin gets
better looking every day
were beginning to scratch the surface
of the talents of clifford franklin
clifford franklin has moves even
clifford franklin aint seen yet
you showed us a few moves
today against phoenix
but it could be a different story
against dallas
thats the same story
different chapter
the football is like a oneman cold
to clifford franklin
clifford franklins the only one
catching it and coming down with it
cheers babe
i think we got it
what are you up to

i cant get excited about
the future of my team

the picket line
thanksgiving night we play
the world champions
we have a deal
no interference with my coaching
as long as the strike is on
falco is my quarterback
we have to beat dallas
to get into the playoffs
falco cant do that
you saw what happened yesterday
jesus christ
do you think hell have
that luck against dallas too
theyll murder him
hes just getting his game back
he falls apart when the game
is on the line
thats been his rap
ever since the sugar bowl
21 other men put their faith in you to
lead them theyd be heartbroken
if you abandoned them before
the biggest game of their lives
you really are a son of a bitch
you know that
what are you doing
dont want to make the same mistake
i did in phoenix
we might end up in that situation
with dallas
they like to send their safeties
put the pressure on
yeah coach

amazing progress the past few weeks
under the tutelage
of jimmy mcginty
he really did
but tonight itll be martel leading
washington against dallas

against dallas in seven years
falco
what the hell is he up to
look here comes falco
falcos back
what happened to martel
i dont know

and that look he has in his eye
he thinks hes gonna play
im sorry
theyre playing zone

if you keep your eyes open
he seems to be necking with that
cheerleader thats what hes doing
players arent supposed to be
fraternizing with cheerleaders
yeah but what are they gonna do
fire him

youre late for work
kick ass falco
whats all the celebrating about

listen up this time tomorrow
the strike will be officially over
dallas made a big mistake

a powerful weapon working for you
there is no tomorrow for you
and that makes you all
very dangerous people
kick ass on one ready
clifford franklin is
looking for a new ho
ready for some pain
bring it on
its coming

a gain of 20 yards by ray smith

shotgun dc right
flip 90 dig on the center ready
we re looking at a different team
here in the second half
absolutely washington is playing
like theres no tomorrow
because there isnt
touchdown baby
son of a bitch
odd bullets blitz coverage
daniel bateman comes up with
a big stop on third and one
that forces a dallas punt
pat with 28 seconds remaining
washington needs a decent return
in order to give gruff
a shot to tie the game
with 12 seconds remaining
its yours nigel
a 32yard field goal
will send this game into overtime
32 yards is just
a chip shot for gruff
you all right
im sorry
i had the money but i pissed it
away at the track again
what what are you talking about
theyll take my pub away from me
its all i got
come on shane

10yard penalty repeat first down

jimmy you beautiful son of a bitch
i knew you could do it
final score
washington 20 dallas 17
washington goes to the playoffs
you did it
you did it
when the replacement players
for the sentinels left the stadium
there was no tickertape parade
no endorsement deals
for sneakers
or soda pop or breakfast cereal
just a locker to be cleaned out
and a ride home to catch
but what they didnt know
was that their lives
would be changed forever
because they had been
part of something great
