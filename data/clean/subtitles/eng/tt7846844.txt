now where to begin
an8baby crying
the first thing you need to know
is that my mother named me enola
she insisted on it in fact
eudoria whispering enola
normal voice enola
enola coos
enola i know its an unusual name
but my mother is rather a fan
of word games
eudoria on your marks
enola get set
eudoria go
enola and enola spelled backwards
reads well
alone
yes
enola she would continually tell me
youll do very well on your own enola
enola coos
eudoria mmhmm
enola and yet we were always together
no no
laughing yes
enola my father died when i was young
i dont really remember him
and both my brothers left home soon after
i barely remember them either
so then it was just the two of us
and it was wonderful
glass shatters
she was not an ordinary mother
she didnt teach me to string seashells
or practice my embroidery
we did different things
reading
science
sports
all sorts of exercise
both physical
grunts
and mental
mother said we were free to do anything
at ferndell
oh sorry grandpa
sighs
enola and be anyone
she was my whole world
both laugh
but she didnt share everything with me
eudoria right ladies to conclude
our choices
the bankmen met
entangle herb
ellie houseman
woman ooh marvelous
eudoria are we all agreed yes
women yes
eudoria ellie houseman
woman of course
woman gasps
enola mother believed
privacy was the highest virtue
and the one most frequently violated
birds chirping
brakes squeal
which leads me to the second thing
you need to know
rooster crows
a week ago
on the july morning of my 16th birthday
i awoke
mother
to find that my mother was missing
breathing heavily
shed left ferndell hall our home
at some point during the night
mother
and she did not return
bicycle rattling
she left me with little bar some gifts
that she instructed mrs lane
to give me at teatime
an8mrs lane what kind gifts
an8and look shes made this herself
enola we were happy
werent we mrs lane
shouldnt she give me
these presents herself
lively music plays
bicycle rattling
oh whoa whoa
grunts
pants
and the third thing you need to know
and there may be those amongst you
who have already guessed it
is that cycling
is not one of my core strengths
but needs must
when you must speed somewhere
train whistling
breathes heavily
train whistling
the fourth thing you need to know
is that im presently on the way
to collect my brothers
mycroft and sherlock
names which backwards spell out
respectively
tforcym and kcolrehs
perhaps one shouldnt read too much
into the alone idea
woman thank you
enola yes
sherlock holmes
the famous detective scholar chemist
virtuoso violinist
expert marksman
an8swordsman singlestick fighter
pugilist
and brilliant deductive thinker
an8my genius brother
he will have all the answers
inhales sharply
clears throat
mr holmes
and um mr holmes
yes
you sent for me
you sent a telegram
asked me to meet you here
and the fifth thing you need to know
is that they havent seen me
in quite some time
enola
my god
look at you
youre in such a mess
wheres your hat and your gloves
well i have a hat
it just makes my head itch
and i have no gloves
she has no gloves
plainly not mycroft
we didnt send for you silly girl
we sent for the carriage
did you at least bring it
the carriage
yes
what carriage would you be wanting
because i have a few in mind
the carriage i pay for
right
i think you may have us confused
with another house
boy fetch us a carriage
quickly
mycroft oh
what the
mycroft sighs
oh dear god look at the house
enola gasps
enola isnt it wonderful
mycroft what the hell
has she been playing at
mrs lane gentlemen welcome home
its been some time
door creaks open
what is this
tennis
mother says im getting quite proficient
effort grunts
glass shatters
oh
inhales through teeth
i suppose thats game
shuddering breath
shuddering breaths
where the hell is she
i would say this is going quite well
wouldnt you
her bed hasnt been made
hmm chrysanthemums
mycroft clothes havent been put away
and laurustinus and queen annes lace
mycroft enough with the bally flowers
sherlock
sherlock sighs
sherlock huh
but it wasnt foul play
how are you certain
her regular supply of drawing pencils
has dwindled to nothing
she clearly had decided
not to replace them
and you rarely find that kidnap victims
have planned for their own disappearance
chuckles
she wasnt returning
and yet she disguised her intentions
perfectly
thats good news is it not
depends if youre relying on her
coming back
mycroft hmm
mycroft oh good god feminism
perhaps she was mad or senile
though madness in our family
i would doubt it
ooh grunts
sherlock i think i can surmise
by the way that she left
leaving no clear leads
she still had her full wits
about her sniffs
no madwoman could compile the accounts
she sent me over the last ten years
perfectly clear and orderly
detailing a bathroom
which does not exist
mycroft and a water closet
likewise
mycroft
and the constantly rising salaries
of the footmen the housemaids
the kitchen maids
gardeners under gardeners
you get the point
and for enola a music teacher
a dance instructor a governess
enola you at least had a governess
she wouldnt like you in here
this is her private space
tell me she at least saw
that you had an education
she valued education
scoffs
she taught me herself
she made me read every book
in ferndell halls library
shakespeare locke
and the encyclopedia
and thackeray and the essays
of mary wollstonecraft
and i did it on my own account
for my own learning
which mother said was the best way
to become a young
woman
well this is what
she wanted you to become
mycroft
what
i dont know what she wanted me to be
shes left me too
scoffs
she will return wont she sherlock
inhales deeply
wont she
mycroft what is she up to sherlock
she was too old to remarry she had
no passions or ambitions i was aware of
she simply had to ensure enola
a decent life
and to live her remaining years
with dignity
this is my house not hers
and has been since father died
she asked for 16 years
to bring up enola here
i gave it and for that
i deserve to be robbed
i am not the villain here
perhaps she needed the money
you clearly dont
or has the government cut your salary
mycroft sighs
mycroft its always the same isnt it
always the same
we dont see each other for months
and then you blast in without a care
and condemn me with your bon mots
simply inquiring
you are judging
you are judging something
for which you took no responsibility
youve never shown an interest
in this family
sherlock i dont mean to judge
we have two problems as i see it
one finding a boarding school
that is willing to take enola on
so she wont be a complete failure
in this world
that i am in the process of solving
with the help of an old friend
brakes screech
and two finding mother
the first is my problem
the second i consider yours
my dear
oh
mycroft chuckling my dear
ooh chuckles
mycroft let me
sighs
a motor car
how delightful miss harrison
miss harrison
well i am an educator mr holmes
i like to keep ahead of the times
enola may prefer to stay here
you could acquire a governess
she needs a firm hand sherlock
miss harrison where is she
mycroft shes inside
though i must warn you in advance
shes unbroken
miss harrison chuckles
well soon see about that
we need to break her and build her up
miss harrison stand tall girl
door closes
thats better
in mothers absence
she is my ward not yours
seamstress waist 24 inches
miss harrison chuckles
seamstress chest 33 inches
well thats too small
they are perfectly fine
seamstress hips 35 inches
oh how disappointing
we will have to use an amplifier
a wild and dangerous woman
brought up a wild child
she seems intelligent
hips are simply a function of legs
arent they
what need have they of amplification
arent you the clever little tongue
ill enjoy that
i wont enjoy being imprisoned
in those preposterous clothes
these clothes will not imprison
they will free
they will allow you to fit into society
to take part in its numerous pleasures
to catch an eye to attract
with miss harrisons help
well make her acceptable for society
father would be turning in his grave
miss harrison at my finishing school
you will learn how to be a young lady
and youll make many new friends
i dont need friends
i have my own company
mycroft an unedcated underdressed
poorly mannered wildling
and i dont need to go
to your ridiculous school
enola grunts
panting
sighs
enola no please dont do this to me
let me remain happy i am happy here
you are a young woman now enola
you need an education
test me on anything you think
i need to know
to be sufficient for this world
if she taught you so well
you wouldnt be standing
in your undergarments in front of me
you have no hope of making a husband
in your current state
i dont want a husband
and that is another thing
you need to have educated out of you
enola whispers sherlock
dont let him do this to me
you are his ward
make me yours
guide me teach me
for him i am a nuisance for you
enola
im sorry
its out of my hands
just like his cruelty to our mother
was out of your hands
she is not dangerous
she is remarkable and always has been
and if you still cant see that
then shame on you both
so remarkable that she left you
in my care
footsteps approaching
well we have had a lovely little chat
havent we
i can tell were going to be firm friends
oh miss harrison
im so grateful for your kindness
mr holmes
its an honor
i shall bring her tomorrow myself
miss harrison yourself
good
sighs
birds chirping
sherlock i also enjoy a sketch
sherlock sighs
helps me think
process my thoughts
helps me do the same
enola grunts
enola sighs
chuckles
a caricature
perhaps best if mycroft doesnt see it
do you intend to stay up there
i was hoping for some privacy
sherlock you know last i remember
you were quite a timid little thing
you had a pine cone wrapped in wool
dragged it with you wherever you went
calling it dash
someone told you that queen victoria
had a cavalier king charles spaniel
called dash
and you decided you wanted the same
we could never persuade you
to put any trousers on
enola gasps
your bottom was always bare
sherlock chuckles
enola grunts
i think thats all the memories i have
enola thank you
if you could now forget them all
a pine cone called dash
that sounds ridiculous
father used to chase you
all about the place shouting
get that damn dog out of my house
chuckles
sighs why did you never visit
sighs
i lead a busy life
sighs
grunts why did you never write
would you have cared for my letters
i have kept every clipping
of every case of yours i could ever find
thats flattering
and yet it took our mothers disappearance
to bring you home
she meant to go
shes not coming back
no
but the truth is
mother always had a reason for everything
her own way of doing things
and those kind of mysteries
are always the most satisfying to unpick
i dont want a mystery sherlock
i want my mother back here
and my life as it was
youre being emotional
its understandable
but unnecessary
sighs
look for whats there
not what you want to be there
youll see the truth soon enough
sighs
own way of doing things
and look shes made this herself
frustrated grunt
alone
thats my name
m s
a
c
try it backwards
bear with me
sighs chrysanthemums
my in look
enola
i hear you mother
floor creaking
whispering chrysanthemums
chrysanthemums
the bestowing of chrysanthemums
indicates familial attachment
and by implication affection
sniffs
sighs
my chrysanthemums
gasps
not the ones she bought
the ones she painted gasps
money she must have left a message
our future is up to us
what future
there are two paths you can take enola
yours
or the path others choose for you
our future is up to us
chuckles
enola sighs
mother was able to vanish from ferndell
and so must i
in the clothes
sherlock himself grew up in
its a necessary distraction
i was just beginning to master it
phase one of the plan complete
im coming to find you mother
the game is afoot
train whistles

so i chose a different line altogether
with my brothers after me

he will think i helped hide you
and i will be endangered by this
therefore i ask you
to get out of this carriage

tewkesbury screams
grunting
panting
train whistling
tewkesbury panting
enola panting
tewkesbury grunting
tewkesbury groans
aah
tewkesbury breathing heavily
and grunting
breathing heavily
you do make an awful lot of noise
dont you
well it turns out
being thrown off a train
hurts considerably more
than you might think
tewkesbury exhales sharply
and ive lost a button
train whistling
sherlock so now weve lost them both
i presume they have no clue
as to where shes gone mrs lane
no they found her bicycle
planted so as to send us
in the wrong direction
this isnt as fun as you might think
master sherlock
she has your wits
she runs rings around me
just as easily as you once did but
yes
she knows nothing of the world
i must admit to being
quite seriously concerned for her
mycroft will make sure to find her
mrs lane well mycroft isnt blessed
as you are
as she is
a matter of great bitterness for him
and not a small part
of the cause of this mess
enola is special
she has such a good heart
shes even left money on my bedside table
money
youve already abandoned her once sir
im asking
that you dont abandon her again
footsteps receding
enola you do know youve entirely ruined
phase three of my plan
tewkesbury phase what
who the hell are you
look i believe our recent
brush with death
deserves me at least a name
enola holmes
holmes like sherlock
and i am undercover so forget i told you
that piece of information
undercover working for him
undercover from him
hence why youre dressed as a boy
hence why you are to say nothing
so
what
thank you
youre supposed to say thank you
for what
animal bleating in the distance
enola sighs
enola we should think
about sleeping soon
tewkesbury we should think
about eating soon
enola we have nothing to eat
tewkesbury of course we do
arctium lappa
which youll know as burdock
very tasty
um and then theres trifolium
clover
and is that
chuckles yes i knew it
mushrooms
agaricus lanipes
the princess
delicious
if you can get a fire started
i can make us a feast
fine
sighs
im not entirely an idiot you know
fire crackling
enola hmm
ive been thinking
you need to disguise yourself a little
how do you feel about your hair
ive never cared for it
cut it off with a knife
of course you will
who taught you
how to sharpen it like that
my mother
your mother is very different to mine
both chuckle
who taught you about flowers and herbs
my father
enola i never really knew my father
my fathers dead too
both im sorry
sharpens knife
tewkesbury why have you run
from home i mean
i didnt want to go to miss harrisons
finishing school for young ladies
tewkesbury chuckles
why have you
well uh
a tree branch broke above me
while i was collecting wild mushrooms
it should have crushed me
but i managed to roll out of the way
and i realized that
what
youll laugh at me
i wont
my life seemed to flash before me
i was just about to take my seat
in the house of lords
i had these ideas
about how we might progress the estate
but my family were set
on me joining the army
and then going overseas
just like my uncle
and i realized i was scared
scared i would hate every second
of the rest of my life
why would i laugh at that
dont i sound pathetic
no
why were they going to send you
to the finishing school
enola sighs
in the morning well have to move fast
the bowler hat man
will be hot on your tail
wheres your destination im going to
london
tewkesbury chuckles
well then
shall we um stick together
if you like slight chuckle
no
well get to london
and go our separate ways
understood
inhales deeply
understood clears throat
totally pained grunt entirely
do you have to be quite so brutal
with the hair
enola yes
sheep bleating
well you would say that
chuckles
both laugh
sheep bleating
horses neighing
people chattering
geese honking
sheep bleating
oh so this is where we part
enola it is
then thank you enola holmes
for helping me here
you were supposed to have forgotten
that name
then youll have to find another
sheep bleating
hell be fine
enola london
the beating heart of england
mother will be here somewhere
and though she prepared me
for many things
eudoria oh youve time enough
for the world
let it do its damage later
horses whinnying
the outside world was not one of them
and yet here i am
at the center of civilization
the home of polite society
man out of the sodding way boy
enola of music
of literature
lords debate reform bill
case of the missing marquess
enola and the finest things
that money can buy
a shilling apiece
yelps
a shilling apiece
enola i must admit
london isnt quite what i imagined
people are a lot more excitable
than in the country
man 1 without this reform
this country isnt ours its theirs
crowd cheering
we must petition the lords
and weve not only got to do it
for ourselves but for our children
man 2 vote for change
so if i am to fit in
and stay hidden from my brothers
i must become something
unexpected
man 1 this is our chance
demand the vote
vote for all men
crowd cheering
vote for all men
an8no one on the trains
no one on the boats
no one anywhere
the girl has simply vanished
of course it doesnt help
that englands suddenly consumed
by this ridiculous marquess
attendant sir
sherry please
attendant certainly sir
you havent been offered it have you
what
the marquess case
i knew his father obnoxious sort
liberal but worth a fortune
i have and i have refused it
im rather more consumed elsewhere
oh in finding mother
in finding our sister
no
no
your job i made clear
was to find mother
im looking for her too
as will no doubt enola
you never cared about her before
shes only 16
you havent given our name
in the search for her
of course not
i dont want anyone knowing our business
any more than you do
oh dont worry little brother
she may have escaped us for now
but i have the best police officers
in london
looking for a child
matching her description
and they will find that stupid little girl
and bring her back to us
reform
god help us if theres one thing
this country doesnt need
its more uneducated voters
england is going to pot
snoring
and what does a boy like you
want with those
i shall need a whalebone corset
miss gregory
you shall need no such thing
this is a respectable shop
then i shall respect it
you dont look like you will
you dont smell like you will
and i
gasps
do you have anywhere i can dress
shuddering
in the back
the corset a symbol of repression
to those who are forced to wear it
but for me who chooses to wear it
the bust enhancer and the hip regulators
will hide the fortune
my mother has given me
and as they do so
they will make me look
like that truly unlikely thing
a lady
you have to go to school enola
but i dont want to go
to a finishing school mycroft
well what else
are we going to do with you
youre a girl
oh come on seriously
gasps
now where might i find a lodging house
ill pay handsomely for good value
chuckles
is this really good value
oh best value youll find
youre lucky you found me
here you have it
voices yelling and arguing
baby crying
animal squeaking
voices continue yelling and arguing
nervous chuckle
train whistling
its lovely
train chugging
enola now ive finally got
some peace and quiet to think
its time for phase five of my plan
or possibly phase four
or possibly phase six
ive entirely lost count
it is time to find my mother
to find mother the first thing
i need to do is leave a cipher
in every newspaper she might read
thank you my chrysanthemum
are you blooming send iris please
iris means message
an8now how to disguise them
mother can untangle anything
so i need to make it most devious
i placed it
in the personal advertisements column
of the pall mall gazette
which my mother seldom missed
plus the magazine of modern womanhood
typewriter clacking
and the journal of dress reform
two publications
i thought might tickle her
this gentleman seems to be getting
a lot of attention
well hes a bloomin marquess
clears throat then i had to find out
who she really was
is
was
my mother only corresponded
with one address with regularity
it was wrong of me
to look where it was addressed to
and entirely wrong of me
to have memorized it
but when growing up in the countryside
there is little excitement
so one clings to whatever narratives
one can get
horses neighing
people chattering
more macaroons please jason

grunts
linthorn grunts
shuddering breaths
chuckles i knew this would have
a truer use
no more surprises
no
no
linthorn yelps
linthorn yelling
bird squawking
when i was a child i cut my knee open
trying to save a sheep
from the cliff edge
sheep bleating
chuckles i almost died in truth
mother was angry
inaudible
inaudible
very angry
eudoria it is good
to care for the vulnerable
but not if it means risking your life
sometimes you have to let nature
take its course
do you hear me
inhales sharply
enola the truth is
i did not ask for viscount tewkesbury
marquess of basilwether in my life
i did not want the viscount tewkesbury
marquess of basilwether in my life
so why do i feel responsibility
for the viscount tewkesbury
marquess of basilwether
because
there are those that want to hurt him
and he has not the strength
to stop them
yells
and i do have that strength
she would have me leave him
he is foolish
and proud and utterly ridiculous
but hes on the edge of a cliff
mother you will have to wait
an8horse whinnying
galloping
when looking to travel incognito
its safest to travel as a widow
people are always anxious
to avoid conversations about death
horse whinnies
widows scare them
and theres no better disguise than fear
sniffling
bird cawing
cries
miss may beatrice posy
tis i
for the lady tewkesbury
marchioness of basilwether
enola sighs
doors close
sir whimbrel whats your business here
enola im a private detective
ive come to offer my services
my sisterinlaw
has all the help she needs show her out
i believe i can help you
you are a reporter
for one of those dirty newspapers
i am a lady detective
please leave
before we make you leave
i work for sherlock holmes
i
im his assistant
he sends me ahead of time
to prepare the ground
sherlock holmes is interested
in our case
yes
lady tewkesbury and he
breathes deeply
sent along a widow to fleece his path
a very good issue to take
may have overthought my outfit
clears throat
widowhood doesnt impact on my ability
to do my job
sherlock trusts me to
lestrade poppycock
im sorry but ive heard enough
you do not know sherlock holmes
oh lestrade so pleased you could make
this young ladys acquaintance
i am lestrade of scotland yard
and im a close personal friend
of sherlock holmes
so you claim
hes never mentioned him
and you are not his assistant
he doesnt have an assistant
sherlock holmes always works alone
hes changed his ways
since you claim to have known him
impossible
ask me three questions about him
and ill ask you three and well discover
who knows him best shall we
enough this circus is not appropriate
for basilwether
shes right leave both of you
shuddering breaths
but madam you know me
i am lestrade i am from scotland yard
and im investigating
your sons disappearance
he has proven useful
mama
i dont care if youre from the houses of
parliament leave this house this instant
clock ticking
me too
door opens
enola thank you for having me
birds chirping
his favorite tobacco
black shag
favorite dessert
plum pie
his favorite composer
paganini
favorite meal of the day
breakfast
are all your questions about food
his favorite case
the one before
favorite board game
how do you know sherlock holmes
chess
but only with a worthy opponent
lestrade hmm
chuckles
enola panting
i say
ill pay you five pounds
to swap clothes with me
you neednt wear my dress
if you prefer not to
the young master
he was outside a lot am i right
could never get him inside
enola where would he go
the woods
chuckles
man hey hey
people chattering
entrance bell jingles
grab a book and have a seat
and ill be with you as soon as im free
delightful
perhaps you could join me for tea
i advise you not to walk away
and yet you walk away anyway
whatever you think you know
sherlock holmes
please be advised that if you disturb
any of my customers
youd hurt me badly
i am well aware of your talents
miss grayston
the question is what youd risk
if i were to advise my friends
in the government
to take a look at this place
i know my brother would be delighted
to browse your seditious dangerous
and extremely banned bookshelves
scoffs
sherlock you see
we can both hurt each other
now please put the teapot down
in your hands it is a mighty weapon
scoffs
sherlock thank you
do you have any sense
as to where my mother is
how did you find me
letters hidden up her chimney
the ash on the sole of her shoe
and the coal dust led me to them
she always said you never missed anything
she needs to be home
she has a daughter that needs her
enola seems to be surviving perfectly well
on her own
so youve seen her
is she safe
shes had company
a useless boy
but clearly
she didnt feel like she needed him
enola is on her own path
and so for better or worse is eudoria
whatever mischief you two are
mischief
a poor choice of word
try not to sound like your brother
you havent any hope of understanding
any of this you do know that
educate me as to why
because you dont know
what it is to be without power
politics doesnt interest you
why
because its fatally boring
because you have no interest
in changing a world
that suits you so well
a pretty speech
edith a scary one
youre intelligent enough to know
that every word of it is true
edith chuckles
what a family
a lost child a puffedup misanthrope
a revolutionary and yourself
no wife no friends
just a strange occupation
obsessed with footprints and coal dust
you see the world so closely
but do you see how its changing
breathes deeply
the reform bill is just the beginning
if it passes
i have to get back to work now
mr holmes
customers to serve
cakes to bake
edith sighs
im pleased youre interested at least
eudoria thought
that youd just ignore your sister
like the ostrich you are
but i suspect that she needs you
so everyone keeps telling me
door closes
bell jingles
sighs
a simple shave please martin
her name
may beatrice posy
mycroft she looked
small dark young
how young
lestrade barely past 20
mycroft hmm
mycroft her mind
lestrade sharp as a tack
and what she knew of sherlock
oh she knew a great deal
as much as i
oh another sycophant
how very exciting
will you tell me who she is
do you have any sense
of where she might have gone
lestrade oh you wish to track her down
ive been engaged in trying to do so
for a number of days
lestrade chuckling of course
shes your sister
keep your mouth shut
mycroft sighs
yes
and i believe i explicitly told you
to look for her
w you explicitly told me
to look for a scrappy girl with no poise
this was a woman with extreme poise
mycroft oh theres a wild thing
underneath
that i assure you
find her
and you will be well rewarded
mycroft sighs
door opens closes
bell jingles
chuckles
birds chirping
a tree branch broke above me
as i was collecting wild mushrooms
it should have crushed me
wind chime tinkling
enola tewkesbury
grunts
grunts
grunting
grunts
owl hooting
breathing heavily
bird squawking
breathing heavily
train whistling and chugging
enola so this is where
you laid your plans
an8or maybe thats what
you wanted them to think
you were leading them astray
this must be why bowler hat was there
screams
following your breadcrumb trail
so what was your real plan
chuckles
oh you tickle me viscount tewkesbury
you magnificent
marquess of blooming basilwether
an8and youre a cleverer boy
than i perhaps gave you credit for
an8 woman its not as stable as you think
gasps
some of those branches
are extremely capricious
good morning
i believe weve already met
though you were dressed differently then
youd already discovered this hadnt you
woman we found it a few days ago
would you care to come down
did you see anything to report
to your employer
grunts
oh
no
sherlock um
hell probably want to come by
what did you say your name was
may
may beatrice posy
and how old are you miss posy
twentytwo
ill have to let the gardener go
for lending you his uniform
no
no i forced him
tied him up
i know jujutsu
grunts
its a martial art
you are most intriguing miss posy
chuckles
or should i say missus
my condolences by the way
birds chirping
beautiful isnt it
it always felt an honor to me
that my family was given
this part of england to protect
to protect
that is what it is
to be an ancestral landowner
as the world becomes
increasingly unstable
it feels important
that these ideas of england are preserved
for the safety and security
of the future of our country
it is lovely here
but youre probably
one of those new thinkers
my son was a new thinker too
never could focus on what was
it was always about what could be
i suspect my grandson is the same
englands true glory
is what is
do you see
i can see much beauty
very sensible answer
now go
if my son or daughterinlaw
finds you here theyll have you arrested
if you see my grandson before i do
will you tell him
that i care about him a great deal
i will
off you go
horse neighs
people chattering
i want four yellow flowers
two blue and a red one
i dont care about the breed
any flower will do
what are you doing here
why if youre passionate about flowers
would you come to london
because i can be lost here
and yet i found you
and why have you done so
youre here for the money
theyve offered a reward
have they
i didnt know
well i must tie you up and claim it
enola laughing
stars and garters
are you really so ridiculous
ive come here because ive grown
to like you more in your absence
and because as it turns out
your life is still in danger
whats made you like me more
really that is your question
not who is trying to kill me
i found your flower pressings
they were quite beautiful
i dont give a fig about flowers
of course
thats because youre ignorant
ignorant how dare you
ignorant and willfully so
you could change your mind about a boy
im not a boy
inhales deeply im a man
youre a man when i tell you youre a man
you do look better in breeches
ill give you that
ive missed you enola holmes
i wanted to miss you
but i kept getting dragged back
towards you
now come on were in serious danger
if you didnt know
is this how youre living
did you just rent a room at the ritz
i afforded myself
a shade more comfort than this
well the woman i boarded off
assured me this was a fine room
tewkesbury mmm
the woman you boarded off lied
i have but a single bed
so youll have to sleep on the floor
you keep old newspapers
be careful with that
i havent finished reading it yet
oh im in this one
so you are
look
why do you keep all these old newspapers
enola holmes
my mother
im waiting for her to leave me a message
she hasnt yet
message what
enola she likes ciphers
coded messages that need to be deciphered
and why would she leave you a message
because she left me
and i thought she meant
for me to find her
but im not sure she did now
so i left her a message
and im hopeful of a reply
i keep the newspapers to check
both grunt
enola i got it
enola chuckles
tewkesbury chuckles
dont look at me like that
im sorry
i dont want your pity tewkesbury
if you dont stop looking at me like that
viscount irritation
marquess of bothersomeshire
ill murder you myself
people dont seem to want us do they
no
still at least weve got each other
ill make us some tea
both chuckle
so you genuinely believe
my lifes in danger
uh from whom
your past and your future
whatever does that mean
enola your family they didnt send
a detective to find you
they could have and they didnt
instead they sent a murderer
tewkesbury why would anyone
want me dead
countless reasons
your personality your ridiculous hair
your silly smile
or possibly your land your estate
your title your seat
same reasons they wanted your father dead
greed does funny things to people
tewkesbury
so now youre saying
you think they killed my father
i dont think
i know
no no none of this
makes the slightest sense
my fathers death was caused
by a botched burglary
and and it would have been easier
to kill me before i ran away
rather than now
i entirely agree i think they tried to
i found the branch that almost killed you
it had been cut
cut
lestrade better you
enola yells
lestrade grunts oh gosh oh
oh gosh you
enola come on
lestrade grunts come back here
whos he
didnt you get her inspector
shut up you
enola move the chest move the chest
grunts where are they
open up miss posy
or should i say miss holmes
enola and tewkesbury grunting
inspector lestrade
i need to report an attempted murder
youre supposed to be on our side
grunting
help me get in through this door
well ill help you when i get my money
my finders fee
youll get your money when we catch her
come on
enola see that window over there
it leads onto a roof
i need you to climb out
and take off into nowhere
and leave you
i need to hold this door
but you need to get away too
lestrade grunts
if he catches you
your life will be in danger
if he catches me
its simply a life i do not want now go
i dont want to leave you enola
banging on door
lestrade grunts
go
go
lestrade grunting
lestrade and enola grunting
lestrade grunts
grunts
help me now
useless men
lestrade grunts
both yelling
no
all grunting
all breathing heavily
hes worth more
but you give me greater pleasure
chuckles
thunder rumbles
rain pattering
mycroft you may not like me
you may not think what im doing is right
but even your blessed mother made a match
even your blessed mother was a bride
i want you to be happy
crying no
you want you to be happy
you want me controlled
because otherwise you think
i will affect your standing
you already have done immense damage
as has that errant brother of ours
let me out of this carriage
i will deny i am your sister
to whoever asks
and i will do it with pleasure
yelling you are my ward
and you will do as you are told
sobs
sobbing
mycroft now hand it over
it is my money after all
breathing deeply
good girl
sobbing
horses neighing
clock ticking
youve missed supper but no matter
you could do with losing a pound or two
the name holmes
is coming to mean something
in this country
at this school
youll be given a chance to live up to it
but i
and you can begin by closing your mouth
the next time you meet your brothers
they will have reason to be proud of you
welcome
miss harrison girls
you are here for one reason
bell dinging
and one reason only
you are here to be made into young ladies
how do we laugh
we laugh politely
ha ha ha
girls ha ha ha
miss harrison
you all have the potential
but you are untapped
untested
grunts
and most of all untrained
walk as we show you to
eyes up up up up
speak as we tell you to
what whim led white whitney to whittle
girls what whim led white whitney
to whittle
miss harrison
act think be as we tell you
and youll become acceptable wives
and responsible mothers
slurping
enola slurps
girls giggle
miss harrison follow the path
of so many girls
who once stood where you do now
and just as we molded them
dishes clatter
so shall we you
miss harrison do you know why
i am an educator
its because i want to make people happy
i want you to live
a full and vibrant life
not with anger and endless questions
but with answers
i prepare my girls for the world
for the real world
i would never abandon you
and leave you to fend for yourself
yes
mycroft told me
my mother had her reasons
im sure she did
i knew your mother
we were friends for a while
at school
she was a peculiar little thing
was always unpredictable
always challenging
she never truly cared for anything
except her own
unusual ideas
she cared for me
then why did she leave you
prefects will accompany you
to and from lessons
this door will always be kept locked
youll thank me
one day
when youre happily married
with a pair of strapping boys
sleep well enola
door creaks closes
lock clicks
sighs
grunts
miss harrison your brothers here
smart collar
mr holmes
you
thank you miss harrison
oh
of course
door closes
i have never seen
such a range of romances in my life
its enough to turn you to newspapers
what in heavens are you looking for
why might you be interested
in the personals youve gone quite mad
i have a right to be mad
in a place like this
i was forced into calligraphy as a child
ah
hated it but theres rarely a case
where someones handwriting
doesnt tell me something i need to know
and what might i learn from deportment
the way a person stands
may disguise who they are
nothings wasted
have you found her
no not yet
i went to the tearooms
where edith threatened me with a teapot
and to limehouse
i believe you went there too
chuckles
youve become quite the detective enola
did you find the gunpowder
and the bombs
i did
why would she
sherlock i shudder to think
perhaps she wants to change the world
perhaps its a world that needs changing
will you stop her
i dont get involved in politics
or people either unless theyre clues
did you help mycroft catch me
no
but you found out about the money
you told him
you disappeared
we had to know how far you would run
im just a case to you arent i
a curiosity is that why youre here
to pick my brains
no
or possibly youre feeling guilty
im here because i care for you
youre being emotional
its understandable but unnecessary
sherlock its an intrigue isnt it
enola emotion
the tewkesbury case
a bit more complicated
than a simple disappearance
he jumped from the train
with another boy
were they being chased do you think
how did you know that
i traced your departure
to the same station that he left from
edith mentioned a useless boy
and i was telegrammed
about a young female assistant of mine
who visited the tewkesbury residence
have you solved it
not yet
the only advice i can give to you
one detective to another
sometimes you must dangle your feet
in the water
in order to attract the sharks
so thats why you came here
shark lessons
no no
i came here sighs
to give you this
i found it under her pillow
she kept it you see
enola dash
sentimental really but she always did
she always found you quite extraordinary
as do i enola holmes
the choice is always yours
whatever society may claim
it cant control you
as mother has proven
enola breathes sharply
keep the paper
footsteps depart
door opens
enola mother thought
i was extraordinary
extraordinary
chuckles
the lords

every vote counts

well sighs whatever it is

grunting

door closes
what on earth does mycroft want
basket rustling
continues rustling
sneezes
male voice ow
breathing heavily
tewkesbury
chuckling whoa
breathing heavily
youre supposed to be helping me out
not getting in with me
tewkesbury chuckles
how did you find me
well you said you didnt want to come
to miss harrisons finishing school
for young ladies
i have quite the prodigious memory
when i choose to use it
so i thought wed go out
the same way i came in
enola huh
i even wore my most porterish coat
thats an excellent idea
nope nope nope nope help me up
miss harrison
she will see right through you
tewkesbury oh i knew there was a flaw
shh let me think
do you have any ideas
grunting
enola groans
tewkesbury quiet

students chattering in the distance

grunts
miss harrison stop there

i am the headmistress of the school
well then um this is for you
well open it up
let me see whats inside

i was given express instructions
that this be opened in private
oh how ridiculous
by my employer miss
miss harrison and who might that be
mycroft holmes
bell ringing
mycroft holmes
students approaching
girls
would you just take this parcel
into my office
that i might open it later
girls grunt
girls breathing heavily
miss harrison no dillydallying
girl ouch
oh this weighs a ton
girls grunting
why is it so heavy
so what are you waiting for a tip
go on begone
basket thuds
girls sighing
breathing heavily
lively music plays
tewkesbury can you actually drive this
i know the basic rudiments
grunts

car sputtering
my automobile
tewkesbury

oh no
tewkesbury the bush
enola whoohoo
tewkesbury enola
enola im not finished yet
miss harrison gasping
miss harrison screams
tires screeching
thank you that was uh
you did save me
tewkesbury chuckles
the best bit was my idea
but you did save me
youre welcome i think
i didnt like it in there
no no of course not
now lets get back to london
and find a proper hiding place
brakes screeching
tewkesbury why have we stopped
enola whatever youre planning
eudoria therell come a time
when you have to make a hard choice
enola
eudoria and in that moment
you will discover
what mettle you truly have
and what youre prepared to risk
for what matters
your move enola
we need to go to basilwether
what
an injustice has occurred
its time to right some wrongs
you want a culprit find the motive
i dont understand
when were you due
to be inducted into the lords
im viscount tewkesbury
well hes a bloomin marquess
imminently
how would you have voted on the bill
votes for all men
the same as my father id be for it
who knew that
i had these ideas
but my family were set on me
joining the army and going overseas
and who stands to gain the estate
with your father dead and if you die
my uncle
my sisterinlaw
has all the help she needs show her out
you think this is my uncles doing
doesnt it make sense
tewkesbury but hes a powerful man
what on earth could we do
solve the crime of course
enola we are both extremely lucky
to have lived this long
and you want to drive us into a place
where there is most certain danger
sometimes lord tewkesbury
you have to dangle your legs in the water
to attract the bloody sharks
why would we want to attract
the bloody sharks
sighs good point
tewkesbury this is a terrible idea
the closer we get
the worse this idea becomes
why are we doing this
unlike most wellbred ladies
i was never taught to embroider
grunts i never molded wax roses
hemmed handkerchiefs
or strung seashells
i was taught to watch and listen
i was taught to fight
this is what my mother made me for
sighs
trust me
to find the answers we need
you dont know how to embroider
sighs
we need to do this
you need to do thiswe are doing this
come on

your time is over
people chattering
woman i was really quite shocked
yep
sir
dont be ridiculous
indistinct chattering
sherlock lestrade
lestrade
lestrade ah
sherlock holmes
we meet again
please
youve been building
quite a reputation for yourself
despite your best efforts
to avoid the press
the marquess case
you need to arrest his grandmother
the dowager
shes trying to kill him
as she killed his father
two questions
how did you arrive at that conclusion
its a question of divided loyalty
and succession
with the boy dead the uncle would take
the vacant seat in the lords
and stand against the reform bill
and the extension of the vote
just as the dowager wanted
the boy i deduce would not
nor would his father have
so why would it not be the uncle himself
that did the deed
to the father or the son
father
his uniform in the press photographs
oh
sherlock the medals on his chest
he wasnt in the country
when the boys father was killed
rather serving in the afghan war
lestrade chuckles
its always there the truth
yeah
you just need to look for it
lestrade second question
how did your sister get there before ya
im sorry
men chattering indistinctly
ha
tewkesbury i look fine
sir whimbrel
dont fuss over him caroline
please mother
oh can i just
dont im trying to have
these mens respect
its quite the style you know
yes i suppose
it sets your face off nicely
your father would be very proud of you
congratulations you finally look
like the nincompoop you were born to be
chuckles
enola no
you look good
this is good
the vote is in an hour its um
its quite the thing
im not supposed to bow or anything am i
now that you are whatever you are
well arguably you always had to bow
you just chose not to
chuckles
so uh are you safe are you
are you are you comfortable
youre not still living
in that terrible lodgings house are you
no chuckles
i used the reward money
your mother gave me
which you reluctantly took
and found somewhere new
well mother has said that theres um
theres theres always room for you
with us
your mother clearly hasnt spent
enough time with me
and what if it was i that
asked you to stay
a kind offer
but one i must refuse
i
how will i how
when will i see you again
youre not rid of me yet
viscount tewkesbury
marquess of basilwether
sighs
chuckles
sniffles
ah
man thank you
thank you
thank you
sighs
enola mother
may i borrow your pencil
thank you
numbers turn into letters
which forms into
enola five two five five
three three one
one one one
sighs
continues reading numbers indistinctly
sighs
meet me royal academy
five tonight mother
well
thats unexpected
thank you
there are three thoughts
that immediately occur
one is that mother wouldnt have signed
mother but chrysanthemum
and two
the royal academy is an institution
that has consistently neglected
to include women
mother wouldnt have suggested it
as a meeting place
and my final thought
is that i may have revealed my hand
in front of my brother
when checking the newspaper
this is sherlock holmess doing
and yet facts dont distract from hope
ill pay you five pounds
to swap clothes with me
sherlock anything
mycroft nothing at all
she beat you once before little brother
and now she may have done so again
oh i do believe she thought it me
but i also believe
that shed be too intrigued
not to be here all the same
unfortunately you were wrong
mycroft chuckles
its possible
nevertheless if we do find her again
id like her to be my ward
ill take care of her
well sighs on your head be it
i washed my hands of her
very well
all the better
you are a strange fish little brother
and youre a cantankerous one
older brother
i assume youre being so delightful
because of the vote
passed by one
that reemerging little toadstool
the marquess of tewkesbury
and his vote proved decisive
now much as i enjoy
standing outside the royal academy
hes an interesting character you know
mycroft hmm
and i suspect hes rather keen
on young enola
then he should marry her
maybe itll tame them both
drink at the club to commiserate me
yes ill buy you a drink mycroft
mycroft come on sherlock
cobbler here you go sir
coin clatters
what on earth were you doing
sherlock thought i saw something
good afternoon enola
good afternoon
youve got a visitor
inhales sharply
this is a surprisingly nice room
i like the finishing touches
inhales sharply i cant stay long
people might be watching
how on earth did you find that
sherlock did
i thought you had forgotten it
you never could leave it alone
as a little girl
you used to drag it around behind you
sherlock said
youd heard queen victoria had
sherlock said that too
well
nice that you two have connected
im sorry
im sorry
i wanted to tell you where i was going
but it wasnt safe
are you safe now
shuddering breaths
i didnt leave you
because i didnt love you
i left for you
because i couldnt bear
to have this world be your future
so i had to fight
you have to make some noise
if you want to be heard
oh its funny chuckles
i thought
i was the one
that was going to change the world
the reform bill
is it true what you did
chuckles
sniffles
what a woman youve become
sniffles
eudoria chuckles
breathes deeply
shuddering breaths
eudoria sniffles
both chuckle
eudoria sniffles
thank you for your irises
now if you ever
ever need me
ill be looking out for them
you have to go
yes but
lets just stay like this for a bit
id like that too
enola so how to conclude
my name is enola
which backwards spells alone
to be a holmes
you must find your own path
my brothers have
my mother has
and i must too
both grunting
but i now see that being alone
doesnt mean i have to be lonely
mother never wanted that
she wanted me to find my freedom
my future
my purpose
i am a detective
i am a decipherer
and i am a finder of lost souls
