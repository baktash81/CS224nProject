poldark and a couple other russkys
just went in the refinery 
then l was right  he s planning something 
maybe they just want to fill up
their gas tanks for free 
 l couldn t blame them 
 no that man s so crooked
he could eat nails and poop corkscrews 
you re the world s foremost authority
on poldark 
what do you think he s up to 
lf his mission is to sabotage
the world s oil reserves
why would he care about
some two bit refinery like this one 
l ll make sure you get a chance to ask him

that you re going to hate in five years
and give her your house 
keep the watch 
a memento compliments of the cla 
so gillian  ls that the woman
that lives next door to your cover house 
 yeah they ve been stepping out 
 l could never give up this life for a woman 
we re spies man 
every little boy wants to be a spy 
lt s the life 
all the hours you spend
sitting alone in a little room like this
eating cold take out food
in the back of a surveillance van
getting shot at all the time
learning how to pee in a bottle
in a moving vehicle 
 you re doing the right thing 
 only problem is that her kids hate me 
you the man 
really gonna miss you ho 
good luck with those kids 
l ve brought down dictators 
how tough can three kids be 
 come on ringo come on

ringo ringo  come on kitty 
lt s not that far 
please please please ringo 
there you go 
 so what do you think 
 well    
lt s a work in progress 
sadly l didn t have any time
to work on it today 
cat was on the roof
satellite s broken again 
l spent two hours on hold
trying to get a repairman out here
and l can t stop thinking about last night 
so are we okay 
l understand 
lf a man marries you
he marries all four of you 
don t forget the pig the cat and the turtle 
so do you really like it 
lt frightens me 
sometimes l think l found
the last honest man left in the world 
l brought you all cookies 
 yes 
 ls it true  you re going to marry bob 
 what  whoa  calm down 
 you can t do this gillian 
you re like so far above him 
what she means is he s boring  he s a geek 
he s a very nice man
who treats me very well 
 he s a pen importer 
 he s a cyborg 
you all don t know him like l do 
he s very passionate about the world
and about my art 
he likes to talk about history
science and politics 
l see what you mean about
him not being boring 
what you all call boring l call dependable 
for once l d like a man who goes to work
every day at the same time
and who comes home every single night 
a man who doesn t lie or cheat
or leave his family the first time some    
my happiness counts too 
l hate it when old people have feelings 
we gotta deep six bob 
 what s the story here 
 they hit poldark s prison transport caravan
 at the edge of town 
 tell me he didn t get away 
he s as gone as rum cake at an aa meeting 
l m telling you
this whole thing was a setup 
they knew he was coming 
are you saying
there s a mole in the agency 
l m not saying anything except he got away 
welcome back 
tatiana
you can t imagine what it s like in there 
the oppressive darkness and the torture
of empty days stretching for years
