the boys found this on the floor 
in the back of the caddy 
yeah  they showed me 
could be unrelated 
could be 
any of those dead kids
wearing pearl earrings 
no 
could be someone s missing  maybe 
that s what i m thinking 
just one more bag after that 
i just wanted to come here 
to winkie s 
this winkie s 
okay  why this winkie s 
it s kind of embarrassing 
go ahead 
  i had a dream about this place 
  oh  boy 
see what i mean 
okay  so you had a dream
about this place 
tell me 
well   
it s the second one i ve had 
but they re both the same 
they start out that i m in here but   
it s not day or night   
it s kind of half night  you know 
but it looks just like this 
except for the light 
and i m scared like i can t
tell you 
of all people   
you re standing right over there 
by that counter 
you re in both dreams
and you re scared 
i get even more frightened when
i see how afraid you are  and   
then i realize what it is 
there s a man   
in back of this place 
he s the one who s doing it 
i can see him through the wall 
i can see his face 
i hope that i never see that face
ever outside of the dream 
that s it 
so    you came to see
if he s out there 
to get rid of this
god awful feeling 
right then 
it s around the back 
dan  dan  are you all right 
what is it  dan  dan

in the courtyard one more time   
i m just gonna bank his little butt for
breakfast  you don t have any pets 
  no  i don t 
  they re allowed 
i just don t like them
in here for obvious reasons 
there was a man that lived here once
that had a prizefighting kangaroo 
you just wouldn t believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard 
let s go see your aunt s apartment 
it s a good one 
i can hardly wait 
  it s unbelievable 
  i told you 
you and your aunt probably have
an understanding  so here s the key 
and if you need anything 
just give a holler 
everybody in this building is pretty
much okay with me   
or they wouldn t be here 
if you like  later on
i ll introduce you around 
well  no hard feelings if you don t 
i m sorry  my aunt ruth didn t tell
me someone was gonna be here 
  i m so sorry 
  it s okay 
i m ruth s niece  my name is betty 
i m sure she told you i was coming 
there was an accident

she s letting me stay here while
she s working on a movie   
that s being made in canada 
but i guess you already know that 
i couldn t afford a place like this
in a million years 
unless  of course  i m discovered
and become a movie star 
of course  i d rather be known as
a great actress than a movie star   
but sometimes people
end up being both  so   
that is  i guess you d say 
the story of why i came here 
i m sorry  i m just
so excited to be here 
i just came here from deep river 
ontario  and now i m in this   
dream place

cowboy   
  howdy 
  howdy to you 
beautiful evening 
thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that   
nice hotel downtown 
no problem 
what s on your mind 
well  now  here s a man who
wants to get right down to it 
kind of anxious
to get to it  are you 
whatever 
a man s attitude   
a man s attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be 
is that something
you might agree with 
sure 
did you answer because that s what
you thought i wanted to hear   
or did you think about what i said   
and answered  cause you
truly believe that to be right 
i agree with what you said  truly 
what d i say 
that a man s attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be 
so since you agree   
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life 
how s that 
well  stop for a little second   
and think about it 
can you do that for me 
okay  i m thinking 
no  you re not  you re too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking 
now  i want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck 
can you try that for me 
look  where s this going 
what do you want me to do 
there s sometimes a buggy 
how many drivers does a buggy have 
one 
so let s just say
i m driving this buggy 
and if you fix your attitude 
you can ride along with me 
i want you to go back
to work tomorrow 
you were recasting the lead actress 
audition many girls for the part 
when you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today  you will say 
 this is the girl  
the rest of the cast can stay 
that s up to you 
but that lead girl
is not up to you 
now  you will see me one more
time if you do good 
you ll see me two more times
if you do bad 
good night 
  you re still here 
  i thought that s what you wanted 
  nobody wants you here 
  really 
my parents are right upstairs 
they think you ve left 
  so  surprise 
  i can call them  i can call my dad

  a small town 
  so you rolled in here from canada 
i always wanted to come here 
i won this jitterbug contest 
that sort of led to acting

when my aunt died   
anyway  she left me some money 
  she worked here 
  in the movies 
yes 
how did you meet camilla 
  on the  sylvia north story  
  camilla was great in that 
i never went to
casablanca with luigi 
  what a pity 
  then go 
i wanted the lead so bad 
anyway  camilla got the part 
the director   
bob rooker 
yes 
he didn t think so much of me 
anyway  that s when
we became friends 
she helped me   
getting some parts in some
of her films 
i see 
so i got the pool 
and she got the pool man 
i couldn t believe it  i wanted
to buy that judge a rolls royce 
sometimes  good things happen 
so i guess we ve saved
the best for last 
  do you want to tell them 
  no  you tell them 
camilla and i   
are going to be   
sorry about that
