the boys found this on the floor
in the back of the caddy

any of those dead kids

just one more bag after that
i just wanted to come here

i had a dream about this place
oh boy

okay so you had a dream
about this place
tell me
well
its the second one ive had
but theyre both the same
they start out that im in here but
its not day or night
its kind of halfnight you know
but it looks just like this
except for the light
and im scared like i cant
tell you
of all people
youre standing right over there
by that counter
youre in both dreams
and youre scared
i get even more frightened when
i see how afraid you are and
then i realize what it is
theres a man
in back of this place
hes the one whos doing it
i can see him through the wall
i can see his face
i hope that i never see that face
ever outside of the dream
thats it
so you came to see
if hes out there
to get rid of this
godawful feeling
right then
its around the back
dan dan are you all right

that had a prizefighting kangaroo
you just wouldnt believe what that
kangaroo did to this courtyard

good night
cowboy
howdy
howdy to you
beautiful evening
thank you for coming all the way
up here to see me from that
nice hotel downtown
no problem
whats on your mind
well now heres a man who
wants to get right down to it
kind of anxious
to get to it are you
whatever
a mans attitude
a mans attitude goes some ways
the way his life will be
is that something
you might agree with
sure
did you answer because thats what
you thought i wanted to hear
or did you think about what i said
and answered cause you
truly believe that to be right
i agree with what you said truly
whatd i say
that a mans attitude determines to
a large extent how his life will be
so since you agree
you must be a person who does not
care about the good life
hows that
well stop for a little second
and think about it
can you do that for me
okay im thinking
no youre not youre too busy
being a smart aleck to be thinking
now i want you to think
and stop being a smart aleck
can you try that for me
look wheres this going
what do you want me to do
theres sometimes a buggy
how many drivers does a buggy have
one
so lets just say
im driving this buggy
and if you fix your attitude
you can ride along with me
i want you to go back
to work tomorrow
you were recasting the lead actress
audition many girls for the part
when you see the girl that was shown
to you earlier today you will say
this is the girl
the rest of the cast can stay
thats up to you
but that lead girl
is not up to you
now you will see me one more
time if you do good
youll see me two more times
if you do bad
