he began our friendship with a gift 
and later  not long before tsavo 
he gave me another  an incredible gift 
a glimpse of the world through god s eye 
and i thought 
 yes  i see 
 this is the way it was intended   
i ve written about all the others 
not because i loved them less  
but because they were clearer  easier 
he was waiting for me there 
but i ve gone ahead of my story 
he  d have hated that  
denys loved to hear a story told well

he is thick with the somalis 
there s a crowd of them up on his land 
who think he s some sort of prince 
he sells finch hatton s ivory  
belknap is a cheery sort 
had a place of his own 
went belly up trying to grow flax  
does he know cattle 
i didn t buy cattle 
we re going to grow coffee instead  
that s not what we planned 
you were in denmark  i had to decide 
we made a decision 
 we don t know anything about coffee 
 you plant it  it grows  
my mother put her money up to do a dairy 
she doesn t care whether
it s cows or coffee as long as it pays  
you must be with a herd or things go wrong 
i didn t come to africa to sit with silly cows 
just tell her we changed our minds 
next time you change your mind 
you do it with your money  
they bought you a title  they didn t buy me 
fetch some wine for my lover s brother 
i think you re tired 
 whispering  be careful 
did i tell you hans came to say goodbye 
 farah instructing
in native language  
 where is baron blixen 
 he s gone to hunt

it can be many days before the rains 
 baboons screeching 
in ohio we put up scarecrows
to keep the birds away  
here you hope there re enough leopards
to keep down the baboons  
 course they ll take your dog  too 
that s africa  
 how much will we plant 
 1 000 acres  the baron says  
how long will that take 
that depends on kinanjui 
he s the chief of the kikuyu  
 got a deal with him to get you help 
 when will be our first harvest  
these are seedlings 
it ll be three  maybe four years  
four years 
if they bear at all 
no one s ever tried coffee this high  
and what are we going to live on
for four years  
i m working to get home 
now  if you haven t got it  
it d be good if you could tell me right now 
we will plant 500 
chief kinanjui  i have heard
that you are a wise chief    
not now  please 
and i look forward to our dealings  
your kikuyu are good workers 
i look forward to dealing
with them honestly  and fairly  
this chief has no british

your leg is very sick 
you must come to the house for medicine

 yes  
if you don t come 
the other boys will say you are afraid  
i myself will think only that you are foolish 
this boy must come to my house
for treatment  see that he does  
what else did kinanjui say 
he says coffee must not grow this high 
never mind  he s a chief  but he s a kikuyu 
 clock cuckooing 
 natives singing tribal song 
if you put a dam here to stop the water
then i can make a pond here  
do you know how to make a pond 
 this water must go home to mombasa

this water lives at mombasa 
 bell ringing

 horse neighing softly 
 neighing continues 
 exclaims 
 growling 
denys  i wouldn t run 
if you do 
she ll think you re something good to eat  
 growling menacingly 
 do you have a gun 
 she won t like the smell of you

 she s had breakfast  
 exclaiming fearfully 
please shoot her 
let s give her a moment 
oh  my god  shoot her 
just how much closer
did you expect to let her come  
a bit  she wanted to see if you d run 
that s how they decide  
 a lot like people that way 
 she almost had me for lunch  
 it wasn t her fault  she s a lion 
 it wasn t mine  
doesn t that outfit come with a rifle 
it s on my saddle 
better keep it with you 
your horse isn t much of a shot  
for berkeley  he s brought you presents 
denys  we stopped by your house
and then came looking  
good lord  you are sweet 
you re on the road actually 
we re off to magadi to shoot some ivory  
at least i have something good to offer you 
did you intend to tell berkeley
what a fool i was  
she had a lion a bit interested 
a bit  a bit  but not enough to bite 
it s all right to take a chance
as long as you re the only one who ll pay  
wouldn t you say so 
i d say that it sounds
more like something you d say  
 thank you 
 not at all  
 where s blix 
 hunting  
 has he been out long 
 yes  
you ll need a good chat then 
shall we stay for supper  
blix will have jackets we can use

 then i would like you to stay 
 good  
i don t know  do you sing

 can you tell a story then 
 i happen to be very good at stories  
i believe that 
denys  what s happened to the cows 
for the dairy  
karen  we changed our minds 
we ll grow coffee instead  
denys  a bit risky  this high 
karen  so i ve been told  
 didn t seem to bother you 
 i think they just haven t tried  
every time i turn my back 
it wants to go wild again  
it will go wild 
 your man   
 kanuthia  
 he s not kikuyu 
 no  
shall i see that he s given supper 
don t do anything for him 
thank you  baroness  
it s true of somalis 
the only tribe that knows horses  
and they don t drink  charge interest 
or chase other men s wives  
cole  got to go to town for that 
did you know that in all of literature
there is no poem celebrating the foot  
there s lips  there s eyes  hands 
face  hair  breasts  
iegs  arms  even the knees 
but not one verse for the poor old foot  
why do you think that is 
priorities  i suppose 
did you think you would make one  
the problem is 
there s nothing to rhyme it with  
 put 
 it s not a noun  
doesn t matter 
 along he came and he did put
upon my farm his clumsy foot  
 chuckling 
mm 
we should have a story now 
when i tell a story to my nieces at home 
one of them always provides
the first sentence  
 anything 
 absolutely anything  
there was a wandering chinese
named cheng huan 
iiving in limehouse 
and a girl named shirley 
who spoke perfect chinese 
which she learned
from her missionary parents  
cheng huan lived alone
in a room on formosa street 
above the blue lantern 
he sat at his window 
and in his poor listening heart
strange echoes of his home and country   
 indistinct chattering 
karen  they found them there
the next morning  
in their room above the blue lantern 
the dead child and the warlord 
with cheng huan s love gift
coiled about his neck  
had you been to those places 
i have been a mental traveler 
 till now 
 karen  yes  
wasn t this england  excuse me  denmark 
i like my things 
and when you traveled before 
in your mind  
did you carry so much luggage 
a mental traveler
hasn t the need to eat or sleep 
or entertain 
you re right 
anyway  aren t you pleased
that i brought my crystal and my china  
and your stories  yes 
cole and denys   singing 
the conquering heroes come 
sound the trumpets
beat the drums 
 cole and denys humming 
 but i want you to come often 
 i d like that very much  
 and you must promise me it will be soon 
 i promise  
bye 
did you save my life 
no  the lioness did that  she walked away 
so i am not indebted then 
but i am 
we pay our storytellers here 
it s lovely 
but my stories are free
and your present s much too dear  
write them down sometime 
take care  finch hatton 
you wouldn t rather call me denys 
baroness 
goodbye 
 thunder rumbling in the distance 
what are you doing 
i want you to come home 
 thunder rumbling 
we never spoke about children 
did you   
do you 
yes 
is that all right 
these kikuyu want to be sick now 
good lord 
your leg has got worse 
you should go to hospital 
this leg may be foolish 
it may think not to go to hospital  
this leg will do as it pleases 
but if you will take it to hospital 
i will think that you are wise  
and such a wise man as this 
i would want to work in my house 
for wages 
how much wages would come to
such a wise man as that  
more wages than come from tending goats 
i will speak to this leg 
 car horn honking 
 indistinct chattering 
man 1   what about air raids 
delamere  quiet  one question at a time  
the war s in europe  will it ever reach here 
german east is only 200 miles south 
general von lettow is there  
let s not wait till he joins us at the bar 
would we engage them 
this is our war 
you don t have to be involved  but thanks  
i ve got crops coming in 
how long is this thing gonna last  
delamere  we just have to stay
and go as we must  
man 2  they won t fight if we won t fight 
we could always arm the masai
and point them south  
do you want the job of collecting rifles
from the masai when this is over  
and our women and children 
shall we bring them into town  
we will deal with that problem as it arises 
will they use native troops 
i d assume so  but not masai 
berkeley  what about your somalis 
they d make very good scouts 
we can cover the area here to the border  
we can gather information
for when the regulars arrive  
denys  what s it about  have you any idea 
 cole chuckling awkwardly 
cole  not really 
denys  then why do you want to get into it  
it s got nothing to do with us 
they ve made agreements
we know nothing about  
victoria and the kaiser were relatives 
for god s sake  
they divided africa between them 
do you know why there s a border  
 cause she had two mountains
and he had none  
so she gave him kilimanjaro 
it s a silly argument
between two spoiled countries  
the sooner we do this  the sooner it ends 
the sooner we pick up where we left off  
it may end 
but we re not gonna
pick up where we left off  
you don t have to go  you want to go 
we ve got to live here 
 they don t want you 
 they don t know where we stand  
i m not so fond of their empire
i d have you shot for it  
more likely chewed on than shot 
the farm will take care of itself 
and you ve got belknap  
the farm will not take care of itself 
that s not the point 
i didn t expect to like you so much 
you re not going to go falling in love 
are you  
not with someone who s always leaving 
if you need me 
send a runner to find delamere  
that s where i ll be 
 that s a fine kiss goodbye 
 i m better at hello  
karen  it s an odd feeling  farewell 
there is some envy in it 
men go off to be tested for courage 
but if we re tested at all it s for patience 
for doing without 
perhaps for how well
we can endure loneliness  
but i had always known that 
 g re eti n g i n native lan g uag e 
it didn  t require a war 
i said goodbye to bror 
denys left without a word 
which was quite proper  
hel lo  the house 
 dog barki n g 
i thought you might want some meat 
is there any word 
nothing new  there s not much fighting 
awful fever  though  
i ve got time for tea  i should think 
are you for the germans 
did they send you out to ask me this 
 we had a row about it in town 
 because of my bad english  
and whose side were you on 
yours 
they want to send me home to school 
mother says i m growing up wild  
 i wanted to ask you about it 
 me  
you ve been around and about 
some day  i d like to run
my own show the way you do  
 is that what i do 
 you don t seem to need us much  
may i ask you something 
i don t know much about men 
i want them to like me  but i   
i want to be let alone  too 
i m supposed to want to be taken  aren t i 
i ve got this book 
but how do you know
when to do what they want you to 
and when not to 
i suppose you ought to call me karen 
 clock ticking 
 clock cuckooing 
 children laughing 
they need paraffin and tinned food

he wants you to send
a white man with the wagon  
is he all right 
i assume  well enough to send a message 
and where would my husband
like this wagon sent  
he s with delamere
on the border near lake natron  
 that s confidential  of course 
 i would bear that in mind  
sorry  i only meant
it wouldn t do for it to be talk around nairobi 
we have to move you into town 
we can t protect you here  
what do you mean  into town 
with the men gone 
we re worried about the natives  
we have orders 
women and children into town  
 that is internment  lieutenant 
 women and children  
is that one category or two 
you ll want time to gather your things 
i ll send an escort here for you thursday 
and i am a captain 
i m not paid to fight 
no 
where is lake natron

 i m on my way to delamere

i m going on

 no  
she could be hurt or worse 
i imagine she knows that

here 
find a spot on the horizon
each morning and steer by it  
south southwest

farah  msabu s bleeding 
she does not have this ox  
this lion is hungry 
he does not have this ox 
this wagon is heavy  it doesn t have this ox 
god is happy  he plays with us 
tell blix his wife s here 
 native marshalling oxen 
hello  karen 
hello  d  hello  bror 
i ve brought you some things 
you ve changed your hair 
 laughing 
 you needed supplies   
 bror  send someone  i said  
you were lucky to get through 
it was really foolish  
but i did get through 
and it was fun 
when are you coming home 
not just yet 
you re not going to help at all
with the farm  are you  
no 
i could force you  i could cut you off 
i ll just hunt professionally 
i might do it anyway 
it s not the way we thought it would be 
is it 
but i like it that you re honest with me 
i like you  too 
very much 
karen  i had a compass from denys 
 to steer by    he said 
but later it came to me
that we navigated differently 
perhaps he knew  as i did not 
that the earth was made round
so that we would not see
too far down the road  
 g ru nts 
you ve got syphilis 
karen   that s not possible 
your husband is not ill 
no 
not the last time i saw him 
that was three months ago 
he s on the border with delamere 
he would have come home  
these cases vary 
he may have just a touch 
but you are very ill 
is he the only possibility 
yes 
you ll have to go home
to deal with it  you know  
the treatment s difficult 
but they have a thing called salvarsan  
arsenic 
and if i m not cured
then i will be insane  won t i  
you ought to go soon 
i ll have to see your husband 
i will send for him 
these ought to help with the fever
till you get home  
 and what are my chances 
 about even  i m afraid  
 exclaims in disbelief 
it s not what i thought
would happen to me now  
 muthaiga 
 what  
your letters 
excuse me 
i heard you had made it 
i d have paid anything to see their faces  
hello 
would you join us for a drink 
i can t  how is it that you are home 
i brought berkeley back 
 has he been wounded 
 no  fever  
more than usual  but he ll be all right
as long as the gin holds out  
and you  how is it with the fighting 
we re taking a beating 
it s likely to last for a while  
 i still have your compass 
 why don t you keep it  
you ve earned it 
besides  i don t always want to know
where i m going anyway  
please don t let me keep you 
 are you all right 
 yes  
take good care 
 we re behind a story or two 
 yes  
 when i get back 
 back  from where  
when you get back  i meant 
 bror  i thought it was malaria 
 it wasn t  
and you may be all right 
but you have to be seen  
and the others  whoever they are 
i hope they ve got it  
it s my fault  no one else s 
i want to go with you 
someone has to stay here and run things 
and the factory must be finished  
 can you do that 
 that s little enough  
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
where s memsahib  
she can come soon enough 
karen  later that day  i left for mombasa
and the voyage home to denmark 
it was a longer journey this time 
the war went on 
i fought my own war 
arsenic was my ally
against an enemy i never saw  
i stayed in the room where i was born
in rungstedlund
and tried to remember the colors of africa 
there was only the medicine
and walks with my mother
along a deserted stretch of beach 
and this room in my mother s house 
denmark had become a stranger to me
and i to her 
but my mother s house 
i came to know again  
and knew i would come back to it 
sick or well  
sane or mad  someday 
and so i did

 march ing band playing lively tune

christmas

 speaking native language 
this chief says children higher than this
must not learn to read 
tell him that all the children
must go to school  
no  this is a chief  you are not a chief 
that s absurd 
it is not good for tall people
to know more than this chief  
when these children are tall 
then this chief can be dead  
 cheerful instrumental
music playing  
 indistinct chattering 
bror  yes  but denys hired out to tourists 
i can t imagine  
he s got no other trade
and we ve got no choice  
the government s put a stop to the ivory 
 what will you do then 
 i ll concentrate on the farm  
hello  the house 
how is it you re home 
i m out  look  i didn t learn a thing 
but i m wonderfully clean  
i ll come and see you 
you save me a dance  berkeley  
what s this nonsense i hear about a school 
i ve taken on a young missionary 
he s promised me to do the alphabet first 
and save god for later  
wogs can t even count their goats 
it s none of your bloody business anyway 
who the devil are you 
 people shouting 
i wonder if you d dance with me 
i think you are about to apologize 
you do stir things up 
when they said they d like to read 
how did they put that exactly  
do they know they d like dickens 
 you don t think they should learn to read 
 i think you might have asked them  
did you ask to learn when you were a child 
how can stories possibly harm them 
they have their own stories 
just not in writing  
why would you rather keep them ignorant 
they re not ignorant 
i just don t think they should
be turned into little englishmen  
 you do like to change things  don t you 
 for the better  i hope  
i want my kikuyu to learn to read 
my kikuyu  my limoges  my farm 
 it s an awful lot to own  isn t it 
 i ve paid a price for all i own  
what is it exactly that s yours 
we re not owners here 
we re just passing through  
is life really so damn simple for you 
perhaps i ask less of it than you do 
i don t believe that at all 
all  happy new year 
 traditional new year song playing 
 all singing 
 gunshot fires 
 all singing british anthem

 bror shouting in native language 
do they always have to whip them so 
 soft classical music
playing on gramophone  
they finally made a machine
that s really useful  listen

once more 
 sighing 
 car engine starting 
well done  we re off 
denys  i don t know
the scientific basis for it  
but i know you can see further
in the african night than any other place 
and the stars are brighter 
it s about the tents 
when i m out with kanuthia   
used to be  we didn t use them 
i remember him 
 there was something   
 masai  
he was half masai 
that s what you remember about him  
they re like nobody else 
we think we ll tame them  but we won t 
if you put them in prison  they die 
why 
because they live now 
they don t think about the future  
they can t grasp the idea
that they ll be let out one day  
they think it s permanent  so they die 
they re the only ones here
that don t care about us  
and that is what will finish them 
what did the two of you
ever find to talk about  
nothing 
so you knew i would come 
it s an early day tomorrow 
why don t you get some sleep  
 what happens tomorrow 
 i have no idea  
good night 
 soft classical music playing 
 baboons screeching 
 you would think they would run off 
 you didn t  
 baboons screeching 
 denys exclaiming

karen  it s how i imagined america to be 
 have you been to america 
 no  but my father was there  
and he always told me stories
about it when i was a little girl  
are you still close 
he died  he killed himself
when i was 1 0 years old  
i can fix that  i think 
 laugh d loud and long  and all the while
 his eyes went to and fro
  ha  ha   quoth he   full plain i see
  the devil knows how to row 
 farewell  farewell  
 you re skipping verses 
 i leave out the dull parts  
 farewell  farewell  but this i tell
to thee  thou wedding guest   
lay your head back 
 he prayeth well  who loveth well
 both man and bird and beast 
 sighs 
that s better 
karen  will it be so different 
hunting for hire 
not for the animals 
well  maybe for the animals  
 do you really prefer them to people 
 sometimes  
they don t do anything half heartedly 
everything s for the first time 
hunting  working  mating 
it s only man that does it badly 
it s only man that tires of going through it  
who says   see here 
i know how you feel about me 
 and you know how i feel about you 
 we understand each other 
so let s lie down and get on with it   
 laughing 
why am i here 
because i wanted you to see all this 
i wanted to show it to you 
i thought you d understand it 
 do you think much about death 
 i think about getting old  
it d be like living with
a cranky demanding old bastard  
you are a cranky demanding old bastard 
i had syphilis 
that s why i went home 
i know 
i never seem to get anything 
german measles once  
they say i ll have a normal life now 
but no children 
so the school

the farm  that s what i am now 
no 
we ll need meat for the camp tomorrow 
i ll wake you at dawn 
good night 
denys  we might scare up a gazelle or two 
but we ll be going through buffalo country

 grunting

 whispering  back up  slowly 
if there s a charge  drop flat  and let me do it 
 lion roaring 
 echoing  drop

dinner in a while 
i m glad you came 
 soft classical music playing 
to rose lipt maidens 
there was a very young girl from denmark
who took passage
on a steamer bound for suez  
there was a storm
off morocco
and she was washed ashore onto a beach 
onto a white beach 
onto a beach so white   
i d like to do that 
will that hurt 
if you say anything now 
i ll believe it 
i need to know how to think about this

when the old mapmakers

men who missed moose in alaska 
grizzly in america  
tigers in india

 chuckles 
berkeley is going to farm

no  thank you 
you ought to look in on him though 
he didn t look all that well  
can you stay 
for a day or so

 how was town 
 crowded  
i ve been thinking 
with all the safari work
i have little use for the room at the club  
i don t know that i d be any good at this 
but how would it be
if i kept a few things with you  
you would come and go from my house 
if that s all right 
when the gods want to punish you
they answer your prayers  
berkeley s dying 
 what 
 blackwater fever  
oh  my god 
 i ll go to him 
 he wouldn t want you there  
why 
there s a woman there  she s somali 
she s been with him for some time 
you never told me this 
i didn t know 
 priest reciting funeral rites 
    with each one of us
now and forevermore   amen  
strange that denys isn t here 
i think he is off with berkeley 
karen  in the days and hours
that denys was at home  
we spoke of nothing ordinary 
not of my troubles with the farm 
my notes due and my failing crop 
or of his with his work 
what he knew was happening to africa 
or of anything at all that was small and real 
we lived disconnected
and apart from things 
i had been making up stories
while he was away  
in the evenings 
he made himself comfortable  
spreading cushions
like a couch in front of the fire  
and with me sitting cross legged
like scherazade herself  
he would listen clear eyed to a long tale 
from when it began until it ended

he s smarter than i am  it may go well 
good luck 
 you might have asked

she said yes 
if i get eaten up sometime
bury me here  will you  
whatever s left 
just there at the crest of the hill 
 when are you leaving 
 tomorrow  
doesn t it matter to you
that i m another man s wife  
what matters to me is that you tried so hard 
what time tomorrow 
karen   goodbye again 
 how many acres under cultivation

how is the hunting 
i ll make a living  where s denys 
uganda  some potentate 
i thought you might be wanting a divorce 
has she got money 
of course she s got money  
is this important  bror 
i suppose 
i ll have to accuse you of something 
or did you think you would
have it the other way around  
fire away  whatever  i have surely done it 
thank you 
how do you manage it  to keep us friends 
we started that way 
i ll be happy for you  if i can 
i remember that quite well 
when you go away on safari 
are you ever with someone else 
i d be with you
if i wanted to be with anyone  
 do you ever get lonely 
 sometimes  
do you ever wonder if i am lonely 
no  i don t 
do you think about me at all 
often 
but not enough to come back 
i do come back  all the time  what is it 
nothing 
bror has asked me for a divorce 
he s found someone that he wants to marry 
i just thought we might do that some day 
divorce 
 chuckles 
how would a wedding change things 
i would have someone of my own 
you wouldn t 
what s wrong with marriage anyway 
 have you ever seen one you admire 
 yes  i have  many  
belfields  for one 
he sent her home for the rains in 1 91 0 
didn t tell her they were over until 1 91 3 
it s not a joke  people marry 
it s not revolutionary  
some animals mate for life 
geese 
you use the animals for your own argument 
you won t let me use them for mine  
i d mate for life 
one day at a time 
 chuckling 
i d just like someone
to ask me once  that s all  
promise me you ll do that
if i promise to say no  
just trust you 
when you go away 
you don t always go on safari  do you 
no 
you just want to be away 
it s not meant to hurt you 
it does 
i m with you because i choose to be with you 
i don t want to live
someone else s idea of how to live  
don t ask me to do that 
i don t want to find out one day
that i m at the end of someone else s life  
i m willing to pay for mine 
to be lonely sometimes  
to die alone if i have to  i think that s fair 
not quite  you want me to pay for it as well 
you have a choice  and you re not willing to
do the same for me  
i won t be closer to you 
and i won t love you more
because of a piece of paper  
 thunder rumbling 
 speaking native language 
see if you can shore it up 
let it go 
this water lives in mombasa anyway 
 plane engine droning 
 soft classical music playing 
denys  i flew as far as narok 
you could see all the ruts
where the lorries had been  
 the serengeti was still good 
 it would take a week just getting there  
and samburu s still good 
where s belknap  i haven t seen him 
he must be in america by now 
i let him go 
 sighs  i had to 
but you don t want to
hear about the farm  do you  
 have you got any buttons 
 what are you doing  
 mending your shirts 
 don t do that  
you don t have to do that 
maybe i ll try samburu day after tomorrow 
you just got back 
felicity asked to come along 
and i almost said no
because i thought you wouldn t like it  
 there s no reason for her not to come 
 yes  there is  i wouldn t like it  
you want her along 
 i want things that don t matter not to 
 tell her no  do it for me  
then what else would it be 
why is your freedom
more important than mine  
it isn t  and i ve never
interfered with your freedom  
i m not allowed to need you or rely on you
or expect anything from you 
i m free to leave  
 but i do need you 
 you don t need me  
if i die will you die  you don t need me 
you confuse need with want 
you always have  
in your world  there would be no love at all 
or the best kind 
the one we wouldn t have to prove  
 you d live on the moon then 
 because i won t do it your way  
are we assuming
there is one proper way to do this  
do you think i care about felicity 
do you think i ll be involved with her  
 no 
 then there s no reason for this  is there  
if she s not important
why won t you give it up  
i have learned a thing that you haven t 
there are some things worth having 
but they come at a price 
and i want to be one of them  
i won t allow it 
you have no idea
the effect that language has on me  
i used to think there was nothing
you really wanted  
but that s not it  is it 
you want to have it all 
i m going to samburu
and she can come or not  
then you ll be living elsewhere 
all right 
is there a prince in there 
i think that you had better get up 
you had better get up 
i think that god is coming  
 all clamoring 
all gone 
delamere  how did it start 
karen  i think god had a hand in it  
he gave me my best crop ever
and then he remembered  
 insurance 
 that s for pessimists  
 where s denys 
 who knows  
 chuckling cynically 
it doesn t matter  the baroness is broke 
it s over 
i ve got to find some land before i go
for my kikuyu  
you have trouble enough 
just a chunk somewhere
so they can stay all together  
we re just out of coffee 
but i can give you tea  
there is no arable land
that size outside the reserve  
and if there were  we d not put natives on it 
since it s theirs 
it belongs to the crown 
what you want is quite impossible  
it always is  who must i see next 
you ve run through us all  i m afraid 
we have a new governor  haven t we 
sir joseph  he hasn t arrived yet 
but will soon  i m told 
you do still ask me to things 
commissioner  captain jacques llewllyn 
jacques  your servant  sir

 baroness  
the baroness von blixen

 yes  i regret it  
do you know of my problem now 
 this land you want from us   
 will you help me  
that s quite difficult 
get up  baroness  please 
kenya is a hard country for women 
so there is a chivalry here of a sort 
you are a powerful man
and i ve no one else to turn to  
joseph  let s discuss this
in the proper way  
you mustn t be embarrassed 
i ve lost everything  
 it costs me very little to beg you 
 denys  wait  
give her a moment  please 
this land was theirs 
we took it
and now they ve nowhere else to go  
i ll look into it  we ll do the best we can 
may i have your word 
you have mine 
thank you 
i hope you will be happy here  i was 
i m sorry i won t know you 
i didn t hear it until i got to the border 
it seems i ll do almost anything
to get your attention  
 people murmuring 
i ve nearly got you packed 
my poor family 
i ve got them near bankrupt 
now i have to ask them for more money  
let me help you 
you would keep me then 
i want to be worth something now 
what will you do 
after my rummage sale  leave 
friday for mombasa 
and then the boat to denmark  
thank you  denys 
karen  you must have them
ready to leave before the rains  
it is good land  enough for all 
but they must not fight about it 
or be any trouble to the authorities 
do you understand  
 or they will lose it 
 yes  
you must make them understand
that i will not be here 
to speak for them 
 this land is far 
 by dagoretti  not too far  
how can it be now  with me and yourself 
you will have some money  enough  i think 
i do not speak of money 
do you remember how it was on safari 
in the afternoons i would send you ahead
to look for a camp  
and you would wait for me 
and you can see the fire
and come to this place  
yes 
it will be like that 
only this time
i will go ahead and wait for you  
it is far where you are going 
yes 
you must make this fire very big 
so i can find you 
take that out to the lawn 
 soft classical music playing 
have you had dinner 
yes 
i ve packed your things 
i thought i would send them on to the club 
is that all right 
this wasn t a very good idea 
 karen chuckling 
i think we should have
had it this way all the time  
i don t know 
i was beginning to like your things  
and i was beginning
to like living without them  
you ve ruined it for me  you know 
ruined what 
being alone 
have i 
i d like to come with you to mombasa 
can i fly you there 
aren t you going away again 
i have some things to do tomorrow
at tsavo  but i ll be back on friday  
will that be all right 
of course 
i ve got this little thing
that i ve learned to do lately  
when it gets so bad and i think
i can t go on 
i try to make it worse 
i make myself think
about our camp on the river  
and berkeley 
and the first time that you took me flying 
how good it all was 
and when i m certain that i can t stand it 
i go one moment more 
and then i know i can bear anything 
would you like to help me 
yes 
 romantic classical music
playing on gramophone  
come dance with me then 
karen  you were right  you know 
the farm never did belong to me  
denys  i may have been wrong 
karen  i had a farm in africa 
 plane engine droning 
denys  friday  
karen  yes  
 people chattering 
 birds chirping 
hello  bror 
would you like a drink 
please 
denys has been killed 
his plane crashed at tsavo 
there was a fire 
can i take you into town 
why did they send you 
i thought i should 
my god  you re brave 
priest   the sun shall not
smite thee by day  nor the moon at night  
 the lord shall preserve thee from all evil 
 he shall preserve thy soul 
 the lord shall preserve thy going out
and thy coming in  
 from this time forth
and even forevermore   
all  amen 
 the time you won your town the race
 we chaired you through the market place
 man and boy stood cheering by
 and home we brought you shoulder high
 smart lad  to slip betimes away
 from fields where glory does not stay
 and early though the laurel grows
 it withers quicker than a rose 
 now you will not swell the rout
of lads that wore their honors out 
 runners whom renown outran
 and the name died before the man
 and round that early laurelled head
 will flock to gaze the strengthless dead
 and find unwithered on its curls
 a garland
 briefer than a girl s 
now take back the soul
of denys george finch hatton  
whom you have shared with us 
he brought us joy
and we loved him well 
he was not ours 
he was not mine 
karen  if i know a song of africa 
of the giraffe
and the african new moon
lying on her back  
of the plows in the fields
and the sweaty faces of the coffee pickers 
does africa know a song of me  
will the air over the plain quiver
with a color that i have had on  
or will the children invent a game
in which my name is   
or the full moon throw a shadow
over the gravel of the drive 
that was like me  
or will the eagles
of the ngong hills look out for me   
you cannot come where i m going 
there is no cooking where you are going 
you would not like it there 
you must trust me about this 
karen  letters you can send on
to this address in denmark  
when you sell the car  if you would
send the check to hunter   company  
and anything else
you don t know what to do with  
yes  ma am 
i ve been sent to ask
if we may stand you a drink  
who is  we

karen  the mail has come today 
and a friend writes this to me 
 the masai have reported
to the district commissioner at ngong 
 that many times at sunrise and sunset
 they have seen lions
on finch hatton  s grave  
 a lion and a lioness have come there
 and stood  or lain
on the grave for a long time  
 after you went away 
 the ground around the grave
was leveled out into a sort of terrace  
 i suppose that the level place
makes a good site for the lions
