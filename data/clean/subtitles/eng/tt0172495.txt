roma victor 
roma victor 
do you think
he s really dying 
he s been dying
for ten years 
if he weren t really dying 
he wouldn t have sent for us 
maybe he just misses us 
and the senators 
he wouldn t have summoned them if   
peace  commodus 
after two weeks on the road  your
incessant scheming is hurting my head 
he s made his decision 
he s going to announce it 
he will name me 
the first thing i shall do   
when   
is honor him with games
worthy of his majesty 
for now  the first thing
i shall do is have a hot bath 
your highness 
we seem to be
almost there  sir 
  sire 
  where s the emperor 
he s at the front  sire 
they ve been gone for 19 days 
the wounded are
still coming in 
my horse 
my lord 
kiss 
you have proved your valor
yet again  maximus 
let us hope
for the last time 
there s no one
left to fight  sire 
there is always
someone left to fight 
how can i reward
rome s greatest general 
let me go home 
ah  home 
they honor you  caesar 
it s for you  maximus 
they honor you 
have i missed it 
have i missed the battle 
you have missed the war 
father  congratulations 
i shall sacrifice a hundred bulls
to honor your triumph 
save the bulls 
honor maximus 
he won the battle 
  general 
  highness 
rome salutes you 
and i embrace you as a brother 
it has been too long 
my old friend 
  highness 
  here  father 
take my arm 
i think it is time
for me to leave 
so much for
the glory of rome 
magnificent battle 
  general 
  still alive 
  still alive 
  the gods must have a sense of humor 
  the gods must love you 
  valerius 
back to barracks  general 
or to rome 
home  my wife 
the son  the harvest 
maximus the farmer 
i still have difficulty imagining that 
you know  dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood  quintus 
  here he is 
  highness 
senator gaius  senator falco 
beware of gaius  he ll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear   
and you ll wake up one day and all
you ll say is   republic  republic  
well  why not 
rome was founded as a republic 
yes  and in a republic
the senate has the power 
but senator gaius isn t
influenced by that  of course 
where do you stand  general 
emperor or senate 
a soldier has the advantage
of being able   
to look his enemy
in the eye  senator 
well  with an army behind you 
you could be extremely political 
i warned you 
now i shall save you  senators 
maximus 
i m going to need
good men like you 
how may i be of service 
highness 
you re a man who knows
what it is to command 
you give your orders  the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won 
but these senators scheme and squabble
and flatter and deceive 
maximus  we must save rome
from the politicians  my friend 
can i count on you
when the time comes 
highness  when your father releases me 
i intend to return home 
home  well  no one s earned it more 
don t get too comfortable 
i may call on you before long 
lucilla s here 
did you know 
she s not forgotten you 
and now you re the great man 
i fonly you
had been born a man 
what a caesar
you would have made 
father 
you would have been strong 
i wonder 
would you have been just 
i would have been
what you taught me to be 
how was your journey 
long  uncomfortable 
why have i come 
i need your help 
with your brother 
of course 
he loves you 
he always has 
and   
he will need you now
more than ever 
enough of politics 
let us pretend that
you are a loving daughter   
and i am a good father 
this is a pleasant fiction 
isn t it 
good morning 
i need three more horses 
two  three 
four 
one  two 
you sent for me  caesar 
  caesar 
  tell me again  maximus 
why are we here 
for the glory ofthe empire  sire 
ah  yes 
ah  yes  i remember 
do you see that map  maximus 
that is the world
which i created 
for 25 years   
i have conquered  spilt blood 
expanded the empire 
since i became caesar 
i ve known four years without war 
four years of peace in 20 
and for what 
i brought the sword 
nothing more 
caesar  your life   
please 
please don t call me that 
come  please 
come sit 
let us talk together now   
very simply    as men 
maximus  talk 
five thousand of my men are
out there in the freezing mud 
three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved 
two thousand will never
leave this place 
i will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing 
and what would you believe 
they fought foryou and for rome 
and what is rome 
i ve seen much
of the rest of the world 
it is brutal and cruel and dark 
rome is the light 
yet you have
never been there 
you have not seen
what it has become 
i am dying  maximus 
when a man sees his end   
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life 
how will the world speak my name
in years to come 
will i be known
as the philosopher 
the warrior 
the tyrant 
or will i be the emperor who
gave rome back her true self 
there was once a dream
that was rome 
you could only whisper it 
anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish   
it was so fragile 
and i fear that it will not
survive the winter 
maximus   
let us whisper now   
together  you and i 
you have a son 
tell me about your home 
my house is in the hills
above trujillo  a very simple place 
pink stones
that warm in the sun 
a kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day   
jasmine in the evening 
through the gate
is a giant poplar 
figs  apples  pears 
the soil  marcus    black 
black like my wife s hair 
grapes on the south slopes 
olives on the north 
wild ponies play near my house 
they tease my son  he wants to be one 
  remember the last time you were home 
  two years  264 days and this morning 
i envy you  maximus 
it s a good home 
worth fighting for 
there is one more duty   
that i ask of you
before you go home 
what would you
have me do  caesar 
i want you to become
the protector of rome after i die 
i will empower you
to one end alone   
to give power back
to the people of rome   
and end the corruption
that has crippled it 
will you accept this great honor
that i have offered you 
with all my heart  no 
maximus   
that is why it must be you 
but surely a prefect 
a senator   
somebody who knows the city 
who understands her politics 
but you have not been
corrupted by her politics 
  and commodus 
  commodus is not a moral man 
you have known that
since you were young 
commodus cannot rule 
he must not rule 
you are the son
that i should have had 
commodus will accept my decision 
he knows that you command
the loyalty of the army 
i need some time  sire 
yes 
by sunset 
i hope you will have agreed 
now embrace me as my son 
and bring an old man
another blanket 
  my father favors you now 
  my lady 
  it was not always so 
  many things change 
many things 
not everything 
maximus  stop 
let me see your face 
  you seem upset 
  i lost many men 
what did my father
want with you 
to wish me well
before i leave for home 
you re lying 
i could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it 
  i never acquired your comfort with it 
  true 
but then you never had to 
life is more simple
for a soldier 
or do you think me heartless 
i think you have
a talent for survival 
maximus  stop 
is it really so terrible
seeing me again 
no  i m tired from battle 
it hurts you to see
my father so fragile 
commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days 
will you serve my brother
as you served his father 
i will always serve rome 
do you know   
i still rememberyou
in my prayers 
oh  yes  i pray 
i was sad to hear
of your husband s death  i mourned him 
  thank you 
  and i hear you have a son 
yes  lucius 
he ll be nearly
eight years old 
my son is also nearly eight 
i thank you for your prayers 
ancestors  i ask
for your guidance 
blessed mother  come to me
with the gods  desire for my future 
blessed father  watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword 
whisper to them i live
only to hold them again 
ancestors  i honor you   
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me 
cicero 
sir 
you don t find it hard
to do your duty 
sometimes i do
what i want to do 
the rest of the time
i do what i have to 
we may not be able
to go home after all 
are you ready to do
your duty for rome 
yes  father 
you will not be emperor 
which wiser  older man
is to take my place 
my powers
will pass to maximus   
to hold in trust   
until the senate
is ready to rule once more 
rome is to be
a republic again 
  maximus 
  yes 
my decision disappoints you 
you wrote to me once   
listing the four chief virtues 
wisdom  justice   
fortitude   
and temperance 
as i read the list 
i knew i had none of them 
but i have other virtues  father 
ambition 
that can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel 
resourcefulness 
courage 
perhaps not on
the battlefield  but   
there are many forms of courage 
devotion to my family   
and to you 
but none of my virtues
were on your list 
even then it was as if
you didn t want me foryour son 
you go too far 
i searched the faces
of the gods   
for ways to please you 
to make you proud 
one kind word   
one full hug   
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight   
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years 
what is it in me
you hate so much 
all i ve ever wanted   
was to live up to you  caesar 
  father 
  commodus 
your fault as a son   
is my failure as a father 
come 
father 
i would butcher
the whole world   
if you would only have loved me 
maximus  the emperor needs you 
it s urgent 
lament with me  brother 
our great father is dead 
how did he die 
the surgeons say
there was no pain 
his breath gave out as he slept 
father 
your emperor asks
for your loyalty  maximus 
take my hand 
i only offer it once 
quintus 
hail  caesar 
i must talk to the senators 
i need their counsel 
wake gaius and falco 
  sword 
  sword 
maximus  please be careful 
that was not prudent 
prudent 
the emperor has been slain 
the emperor died
of natural causes 
  why are you armed  quintus 
  guards 
please don t fight  maximus 
i m sorry 
caesar has spoken 
ride until dawn   
and then execute him 
quintus  look at me 
look at me 
promise me that you will
look after my family 
your family will meet you
in the afterlife 
kneel 
biessed father 
watch over my wife and son 
whisper to them that i live
only to hold them again 
at least give me a clean death 
a soldier s death 
the frost  sometimes
it makes the blade stick 
praetorian 
  remember the last time you were home 
  two years  264 days and this morning 
blessed father  watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword 
whisper to them i live only to hold them
again  for all else is dust and air 
whisper to them
i live only to hold them again   
for all else is dust and air 
papa  papa 
don t die 
you ll meet them again 
not yet 
no  they will clean it 
wait and see 
don t die 
they ll feed you to the lions 
they are worth more than we are 
better now 
clean  you see 
proximo 
my old friend 
every day is a great day
when you are here   
but today
is your most fortunate day 
those giraffes you sold me   
they won t mate 
they just walk around eating   
and not mating 
you sold me   
queer giraffes 
  i want my money back 
  not a chance 
i do special price for you 
on what 
have you seen my new stock 
come and see them 
do any of them fight 
i ve got a match coming up 
some are good for fighting 
others for dying 
you need both  i think 
get up 
what s your trade 
i was a hunter 
i bought him from a salt mine
in carthage 
sit down 
mark of the legion 
  deserter 
  maybe so  but who cares 
  he s a spaniard 
  i ll take six 
  for one thousand 
  one thousand 
the numidian alone is worth 2 000 
these slaves are rotten 
it all adds to the flavor 
wait  wait  wait 
i can negotiate 
i ll give you 2 000   
and four for the beasts 
that s 5 000 for an old friend 
come on  how long does it take
to get into my own house 
i am proximo 
i shall be closer to you
for the next few days   
which will be the last
of your miserable lives   
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world 
i did not pay good money for you
for your company 
i paid it so that i could
profit from your death 
and as your mother was there
at your beginning   
so i shall be there at your end 
and when you die 
and die you shall   
your transition
shall be to the sound of   
gladiators   
i salute you 
  red 
  red 
yellow 
yellow 
good 
  red 
  red 
spaniard 
that s enough for the moment 
his time will come 
next 
spaniard 
why don t you fight 
we all have to fight 
is that the sign of your gods 
will that not anger them 
the gods favor you 
red is the gods  color 
you will need their help today 
some of you are thinking
you won t fight   
and some that you can t fight 
they all say that   
until they re out there 
listen 
kill  kill  kill 
thrust this
into another man s flesh 
they will applaud
and love you for that 
and you   
you may begin to love them   
for that 
ultimately   
we re all dead men 
sadly  we cannot choose how  but   
we can decide
how we meet that end   
in order
that we are remembered   
as men 
on the left 
draw your shields 
on the right 
draw your swords 
kill  kill  kill 
pair them up   
red with yellow 
next 
move it 
  go away 
  you ll never rule us  commodus 
he enters rome like a conquering hero 
but what has he conquered 
give him time  gracchus 
he s young 
i think he could do very well 
for rome  or for you 
go to your mother  lucius 
it s what she d like 
lucius 
mother 
hail  caesar 
senators 
rome greets her new emperor 
your loyal subjects
bid you welcome  highness 
thankyou  falco 
and for the loyal subjects 
i trust they weren t too expensive 
  caesar 
  gracchus 
all rome rejoices
in your return  caesar 
there are many matters
that require your attention 
to order  please 
to order 
for your guidance  caesar  the senate
has prepared a series of protocols   
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city   
beginning with basic sanitation
for the greek quarter   
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there 
so  if caesar   
don t you see  gracchus 
that s the very problem 
isn t it 
my father spent
all his time at study   
at books of learning
and philosophy 
he spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the senate 
and all the while
the people were forgotten 
but the senate
is the people  sire   
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people 
i doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do  gracchus   
or have such
splendid mistresses  gaius 
i think i understand my own people 
then perhaps caesar will be so good
as to teach us   
out of his own extensive experience 
i call it love 
i am their father 
the people are my children 
i shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly 
have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague  sire 
no  but if you interrupt me again   
i assure you that you shall 
senator 
my brother is very tired 
leave your list with me 
caesar shall do
all that rome requires 
my lady  as always   
your lightest touch
commands obedience 
who are they to lecture me 
commodus  the senate has its uses 
what uses 
all they do is talk 
it should be just   
you and me   
and rome 
don t even think it 
there s always been a senate 
rome has changed 
it takes an emperor
to rule an empire 
of course 
but leave the people their   
illusions 
traditions 
my father s war
against the barbarians   
he said it himself  it achieved nothing 
but the people loved him 
the people always love victories 
why 
they didn t see the battles 
what do they care about germania 
they care about
the greatness of rome 
the greatness of rome 
well  what is that 
it s an idea   
greatness 
greatness is a vision 
exactly  a vision 
do you not see  lucilla 
i will give the people a vision of rome 
and they will love me for it 
and they ll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men 
i will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives 
white and red wine
for your drinking pleasure 
games 
one hundred and fifty days
of games 
he s cleverer than i thought 
clever 
the whole of rome
would be laughing at him   
if they weren t so afraid
of his praetorian 
fear and wonder   
a powerful combination 
you really think the people
are going to be seduced by that 
i think he knows what rome is 
rome is the mob 
conjure magic for them 
and they ll be distracted 
take away their freedom 
and still they ll roar 
the beating heart of rome   
is not the marble of the senate 
it s the sand of the colosseum 
he ll bring them death   
and they will love him for it 
spaniard 
are you not entertained 
are you not entertained 
is this not why you are here 
spaniard  spaniard 
what do you want 
girl 
boy 
you sent for me 
yes  i did 
you re good  spaniard 
but you re not that good 
you could be magnificent 
i m required to kill  so i kill 
that is enough 
that s enough for the provinces 
but not for rome 
the young emperor   
has arranged
a series of spectacles   
to commemorate his father   
marcus aurelius 
i find that amusing   
since it was marcus aurelius   
the wise 
the all knowing marcus aurelius   
that closed us down 
so  finally  after five years
of scratching a living   
in flea infested villages   
we re finally going back
to where we belong   
the colosseum 
oh  you should see
the colosseum  spaniard 
fifty thousand romans   
watching every movement
of your sword   
willing you to make
that killer blow 
the silence before you strike   
and the noise afterwards 
it rises 
it rises up like   
like a storm   
as if you were
the thunder god himself 
you were a gladiator 
yes  i was 
you won your freedom 
a long time ago  the emperor   
presented me with a rudis 
it s just a wooden sword 
the symbol of your freedom 
he touched me on the shoulder 
and i was free 
you knew marcus aurelius 
i did not say i knew him  i said
he touched me on the shoulder once 
you asked me what i want 
i too  want to stand
in front of the emperor   
as you did 
then listen to me 
learn from me 
i wasn t the best
because i killed quickly 
i was the best
because the crowd loved me 
win the crowd   
and you ll win your freedom 
i will win the crowd 
i will give them something
they ve never seen before 
so  spaniard 
we shall go to rome together   
and have bloody adventures   
and the great whore
will suckle us   
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more 
and then   
when enough men have died   
perhaps you will have your freedom 
here  use this 
it s somewhere out there   
my country   
my home 
my wife is preparing food 
my daughters carry water
from the river 
will i ever see them again 
i think no 
do you believe you ll see them again
when you die 
i think so 
but then   
i will die soon 
they will not die for many years 
i ll have to wait 
but you would wait 
ofcourse 
you see   
my wife   
and my son   
are already waiting for me 
you ll meet them again 
but not yet 
not yet  unless   
not yet 
not yet 
there 
there it is 
out 
go  go  out 
good to see you again 
old friend 
bring me fortune 
have you ever seen anything
like that before
