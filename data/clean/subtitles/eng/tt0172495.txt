do you think
hes really dying
hes been dying
for ten years
if he werent really dying
he wouldnt have sent for us
maybe he just misses us
and the senators
he wouldnt have summoned them if
peace commodus
after two weeks on the road your
incessant scheming is hurting my head
hes made his decision
hes going to announce it
he will name me
the first thing i shall do
when
is honor him with games
worthy of his majesty
for now the first thing
i shall do is have a hot bath
your highness
we seem to be
almost there sir
sire
wheres the emperor
hes at the front sire
theyve been gone for 19 days
the wounded are
still coming in
my horse
my lord
kiss
you have proved your valor
yet again maximus
let us hope
for the last time
theres no one
left to fight sire
there is always
someone left to fight
how can i reward
romes greatest general
let me go home
ah home
they honor you caesar
its for you maximus
they honor you
have i missed it
have i missed the battle
you have missed the war
father congratulations
i shall sacrifice a hundred bulls
to honor your triumph
save the bulls
honor maximus
he won the battle
general
highness
rome salutes you
and i embrace you as a brother
it has been too long
my old friend
highness
here father
take my arm
i think it is time
for me to leave
so much for
the glory of rome
magnificent battle
general
still alive
still alive
the gods must have a sense of humor
the gods must love you
valerius
back to barracks general
or to rome
home my wife
the son the harvest
maximus the farmer
i still have difficulty imagining that
you know dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood quintus
here he is
highness
senator gaius senator falco
beware of gaius hell pour
a honeyed potion in your ear
and youll wake up one day and all
youll say is republic republic
well why not
rome was founded as a republic
yes and in a republic
the senate has the power
but senator gaius isnt
influenced by that of course
where do you stand general
emperor or senate
a soldier has the advantage
of being able
to look his enemy
in the eye senator
well with an army behind you
you could be extremely political
i warned you
now i shall save you senators
maximus
im going to need
good men like you
how may i be of service
highness
youre a man who knows
what it is to command
you give your orders the orders
are obeyed and the battle is won
but these senators scheme and squabble
and flatter and deceive
maximus we must save rome
from the politicians my friend
can i count on you
when the time comes
highness when your father releases me
i intend to return home
home well no ones earned it more
dont get too comfortable
i may call on you before long
lucillas here
did you know
shes not forgotten you
and now youre the great man
i fonly you
had been born a man
what a caesar
you would have made
father
you would have been strong
i wonder
would you have been just
i would have been
what you taught me to be
how was your journey
long uncomfortable
why have i come
i need your help
with your brother
of course
he loves you
he always has
and
he will need you now
more than ever
enough of politics
let us pretend that
you are a loving daughter
and i am a good father
this is a pleasant fiction
isnt it
good morning
i need three more horses
two three
four
one two
you sent for me caesar
caesar
tell me again maximus
why are we here
for the glory ofthe empire sire
ah yes
ah yes i remember
do you see that map maximus
that is the world
which i created
for 25 years
i have conquered spilt blood
expanded the empire
since i became caesar
ive known four years without war
four years of peace in 20
and for what
i brought the sword
nothing more
caesar your life
please
please dont call me that
come please
come sit
let us talk together now
very simply as men
maximus talk
five thousand of my men are
out there in the freezing mud
three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved
two thousand will never
leave this place
i will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing
and what would you believe
they fought foryou and for rome
and what is rome
ive seen much
of the rest of the world
it is brutal and cruel and dark
rome is the light
yet you have
never been there
you have not seen
what it has become
i am dying maximus
when a man sees his end
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life
how will the world speak my name
in years to come
will i be known
as the philosopher
the warrior
the tyrant
or will i be the emperor who
gave rome back her true self
there was once a dream
that was rome
you could only whisper it
anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish
it was so fragile
and i fear that it will not
survive the winter
maximus
let us whisper now
together you and i
you have a son
tell me about your home
my house is in the hills
above trujillo a very simple place
pink stones
that warm in the sun
a kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day
jasmine in the evening
through the gate
is a giant poplar
figs apples pears
the soil marcus black
black like my wifes hair
grapes on the south slopes
olives on the north
wild ponies play near my house
they tease my son he wants to be one
remember the last time you were home
two years 264 days and this morning
i envy you maximus
its a good home
worth fighting for
there is one more duty
that i ask of you
before you go home
what would you
have me do caesar
i want you to become
the protector of rome after i die
i will empower you
to one end alone
to give power back
to the people of rome
and end the corruption
that has crippled it
will you accept this great honor
that i have offered you
with all my heart no
maximus
that is why it must be you
but surely a prefect
a senator
somebody who knows the city
who understands her politics
but you have not been
corrupted by her politics
and commodus
commodus is not a moral man
you have known that
since you were young
commodus cannot rule
he must not rule
you are the son
that i should have had
commodus will accept my decision
he knows that you command
the loyalty of the army
i need some time sire
yes
by sunset
i hope you will have agreed
now embrace me as my son
and bring an old man
another blanket
my father favors you now
my lady
it was not always so
many things change
many things
not everything
maximus stop
let me see your face
you seem upset
i lost many men
what did my father
want with you
to wish me well
before i leave for home
youre lying
i could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it
i never acquired your comfort with it
true
but then you never had to
life is more simple
for a soldier
or do you think me heartless
i think you have
a talent for survival
maximus stop
is it really so terrible
seeing me again
no im tired from battle
it hurts you to see
my father so fragile
commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days
will you serve my brother
as you served his father
i will always serve rome
do you know
i still rememberyou
in my prayers
oh yes i pray
i was sad to hear
of your husbands death i mourned him
thank you
and i hear you have a son
yes lucius
hell be nearly
eight years old
my son is also nearly eight
i thank you for your prayers
ancestors i ask
for your guidance
blessed mother come to me
with the gods desire for my future
blessed father watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword
whisper to them i live
only to hold them again
ancestors i honor you
and will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me
cicero
sir
you dont find it hard
to do your duty
sometimes i do
what i want to do
the rest of the time
i do what i have to
we may not be able
to go home after all
are you ready to do
your duty for rome
yes father
you will not be emperor
which wiser older man
is to take my place
my powers
will pass to maximus
to hold in trust
until the senate
is ready to rule once more
rome is to be
a republic again
maximus
yes
my decision disappoints you
you wrote to me once
listing the four chief virtues
wisdom justice
fortitude
and temperance
as i read the list
i knew i had none of them
but i have other virtues father
ambition
that can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel
resourcefulness
courage
perhaps not on
the battlefield but
there are many forms of courage
devotion to my family
and to you
but none of my virtues
were on your list
even then it was as if
you didnt want me foryour son
you go too far
i searched the faces
of the gods
for ways to please you
to make you proud
one kind word
one full hug
where you pressed me
to your chest and held me tight
would have been like the sun
on my heart for a thousand years
what is it in me
you hate so much
all ive ever wanted
was to live up to you caesar
father
commodus
your fault as a son
is my failure as a father
come
father
i would butcher
the whole world
if you would only have loved me
maximus the emperor needs you
its urgent
lament with me brother
our great father is dead
how did he die
the surgeons say
there was no pain
his breath gave out as he slept
father
your emperor asks
for your loyalty maximus
take my hand
i only offer it once
quintus
hail caesar
i must talk to the senators
i need their counsel
wake gaius and falco
sword
sword
maximus please be careful
that was not prudent
prudent
the emperor has been slain
the emperor died
of natural causes
why are you armed quintus
guards
please dont fight maximus
im sorry
caesar has spoken
ride until dawn
and then execute him
quintus look at me
look at me
promise me that you will
look after my family
your family will meet you
in the afterlife
kneel
biessed father
watch over my wife and son
whisper to them that i live
only to hold them again
at least give me a clean death
a soldiers death
the frost sometimes
it makes the blade stick
praetorian
remember the last time you were home
two years 264 days and this morning
blessed father watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword
whisper to them i live only to hold them
again for all else is dust and air
whisper to them
i live only to hold them again
for all else is dust and air
papa papa
dont die
youll meet them again
not yet
no they will clean it
wait and see
dont die
theyll feed you to the lions
they are worth more than we are
better now
clean you see
proximo
my old friend
every day is a great day
when you are here
but today
is your most fortunate day
those giraffes you sold me
they wont mate
they just walk around eating
and not mating
you sold me
queer giraffes
i want my money back
not a chance
i do special price for you
on what
have you seen my new stock
come and see them
do any of them fight
ive got a match coming up
some are good for fighting
others for dying
you need both i think
get up
whats your trade
i was a hunter
i bought him from a salt mine
in carthage
sit down
mark of the legion
deserter
maybe so but who cares
hes a spaniard
ill take six
for one thousand
one thousand
the numidian alone is worth 2000
these slaves are rotten
it all adds to the flavor
wait wait wait
i can negotiate
ill give you 2000
and four for the beasts
thats 5000 for an old friend
come on how long does it take
to get into my own house
i am proximo
i shall be closer to you
for the next few days
which will be the last
of your miserable lives
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world
i did not pay good money for you
for your company
i paid it so that i could
profit from your death
and as your mother was there
at your beginning
so i shall be there at your end
and when you die
and die you shall
your transition
shall be to the sound of
gladiators
i salute you
red
red
yellow
yellow
good
red
red
spaniard
thats enough for the moment
his time will come
next
spaniard
why dont you fight
we all have to fight
is that the sign of your gods
will that not anger them
the gods favor you
red is the gods color
you will need their help today
some of you are thinking
you wont fight
and some that you cant fight
they all say that
until theyre out there
listen
kill kill kill
thrust this
into another mans flesh
they will applaud
and love you for that
and you
you may begin to love them
for that
ultimately
were all dead men
sadly we cannot choose how but
we can decide
how we meet that end
in order
that we are remembered
as men
on the left
draw your shields
on the right
draw your swords
kill kill kill
pair them up
red with yellow
next
move it
go away
youll never rule us commodus
he enters rome like a conquering hero
but what has he conquered
give him time gracchus
hes young
i think he could do very well
for rome or for you
go to your mother lucius
its what shed like
lucius
mother
hail caesar
senators
rome greets her new emperor
your loyal subjects
bid you welcome highness
thankyou falco
and for the loyal subjects
i trust they werent too expensive
caesar
gracchus
all rome rejoices
in your return caesar
there are many matters
that require your attention
to order please
to order
for your guidance caesar the senate
has prepared a series of protocols
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city
beginning with basic sanitation
for the greek quarter
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there
so if caesar
dont you see gracchus
thats the very problem
isnt it
my father spent
all his time at study
at books of learning
and philosophy
he spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the senate
and all the while
the people were forgotten
but the senate
is the people sire
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people
i doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do gracchus
or have such
splendid mistresses gaius
i think i understand my own people
then perhaps caesar will be so good
as to teach us
out of his own extensive experience
i call it love
i am their father
the people are my children
i shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly
have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague sire
no but if you interrupt me again
i assure you that you shall
senator
my brother is very tired
leave your list with me
caesar shall do
all that rome requires
my lady as always
your lightest touch
commands obedience
who are they to lecture me
commodus the senate has its uses
what uses
all they do is talk
it should be just
you and me
and rome
dont even think it
theres always been a senate
rome has changed
it takes an emperor
to rule an empire
of course
but leave the people their
illusions
traditions
my fathers war
against the barbarians
he said it himself it achieved nothing
but the people loved him
the people always love victories
why
they didnt see the battles
what do they care about germania
they care about
the greatness of rome
the greatness of rome
well what is that
its an idea
greatness
greatness is a vision
exactly a vision
do you not see lucilla
i will give the people a vision of rome
and they will love me for it
and theyll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men
i will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives
white and red wine
for your drinking pleasure
games
one hundred and fifty days
of games
hes cleverer than i thought
clever
the whole of rome
would be laughing at him
if they werent so afraid
of his praetorian
fear and wonder
a powerful combination
you really think the people
are going to be seduced by that
i think he knows what rome is
rome is the mob
conjure magic for them
and theyll be distracted
take away their freedom
and still theyll roar
the beating heart of rome
is not the marble of the senate
its the sand of the colosseum
hell bring them death
and they will love him for it
spaniard
are you not entertained
are you not entertained
is this not why you are here
spaniard spaniard
what do you want
girl
boy
you sent for me
yes i did
youre good spaniard
but youre not that good
you could be magnificent
im required to kill so i kill
that is enough
thats enough for the provinces
but not for rome
the young emperor
has arranged
a series of spectacles
to commemorate his father
marcus aurelius
i find that amusing
since it was marcus aurelius
the wise
the allknowing marcus aurelius
that closed us down
so finally after five years
of scratching a living
in fleainfested villages
were finally going back
to where we belong
the colosseum
oh you should see
the colosseum spaniard
fifty thousand romans
watching every movement
of your sword
willing you to make
that killer blow
the silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards
it rises
it rises up like
like a storm
as if you were
the thunder god himself
you were a gladiator
yes i was
you won your freedom
a long time ago the emperor
presented me with a rudis
its just a wooden sword
the symbol of your freedom
he touched me on the shoulder
and i was free
you knew marcus aurelius
i did not say i knew him i said
he touched me on the shoulder once
you asked me what i want
i too want to stand
in front of the emperor
as you did
then listen to me
learn from me
i wasnt the best
because i killed quickly
i was the best
because the crowd loved me
win the crowd
and youll win your freedom
i will win the crowd
i will give them something
theyve never seen before
so spaniard
we shall go to rome together
and have bloody adventures
and the great whore
will suckle us
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more
and then
when enough men have died
perhaps you will have your freedom
here use this
its somewhere out there
my country
my home
my wife is preparing food
my daughters carry water
from the river
will i ever see them again
i think no
do you believe youll see them again
when you die
i think so
but then
i will die soon
they will not die for many years
ill have to wait
but you would wait
ofcourse
you see
my wife
and my son
are already waiting for me
youll meet them again
but not yet
not yet unless
not yet
not yet
there
there it is
out
go go out
good to see you again
old friend
bring me fortune
have you ever seen anything
like that before
