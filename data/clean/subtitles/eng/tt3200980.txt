in your best interest
or its just uh
its just a hard decision
its not fair
im saying that god
is probably not a genie

every wish or
i dont know i dont know
maybe youre right
i hope that you get
what you asked for tonight
thanks dad
hes crashing come on
doctor get that
off of the paper
get two units of blood
probing
wheres the co2
you know its
in moments like these
im reminded
of one profound truth
life is short
and its meant to be lived
with courage
and not laden with fear
and you have to decide
are your dreams bigger
than your memories
or will you stay
stuck in the past
life is meant to be lived
lived abundantly
you know you look around this
cemetery you see there are
there are two dates
on every tombstone
theres a birthdate
and there is a date of death
every human being
is guaranteed those two dates
but that little dash
that lies in between
those two numbers
thats what defines our life
so make your dash count
live really live
ladies and
gentlemen lets welcome
our new louisville bats
manager calvin campbell
who will now take the mound
to throw out the first pitch
wow
i want to dedicate
this first pitch
to someone
very important to me

the heck have you been
i dont know
good morning sunshine
its nice to see you up
once in a while
its 1200 already
the city bus is gone
youre late again
but ill give you a ride
i know you dont like it
when i tell you how to live
but somethings gotta give
so let it out
you gotta move on
before you lose
all you love
and have to
start over again
maybe thats how
youll learn about
life love and pain
you say youre dry now
but to me
it looks like rain
and i dont want to see you
get soaked
all over again
dead man walking
youre stumbling
down the street
at half past 300
sooner or later
youll find the police
and theyll find me
now i can understand
if you dont know
who you are
and where you wanna go
my impatience
is starting to show
so pick it up
pack it all on
you better start soon
or ill be gone
im not gonna wait
maybe thats how
youll learn about
life love and pain
you say youre dry now
but to me
it looks like rain
and i dont want to see you
get soaked all over again
life love and pain
life love and pain
life love and pain
life love and pain
life love and pain
life love and pain
life love and pain
life love and pain
my heart holds a question
between every beat
got every answer
beneath my feet
fallin apart
but i never know why
ive walked every road
but the one thats right
been chasin my tail
instead of my dream
lifes just a game
but you play it for keeps
the world is kind
the world is cruel
the world you find
depends on you
when did i stop believin
wake me from this sleep
wake me from this sleep
save me from these dreams
when did i stop believin
i guess im alive
but i tend to forget
i remember the taste
