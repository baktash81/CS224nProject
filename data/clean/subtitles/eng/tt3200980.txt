okay 
growing up  did i get you
everything that you ever asked for 
  of course not 
  no 
but i love you so much
and i want you to have
everything that you want 
but sometimes it s not
in your best interest
or it s just  uh   
it s just a hard decision 
it s not fair 
i m saying that god   
is probably not a genie   
you know  that s granting
every wish or   
i don t know  i don t know 
maybe you re right 
i hope that you get
what you asked for tonight 
thanks  dad 
he s crashing  come on 
doctor  get that
off of the paper 
get two units of blood 
probing 
where s the co2 
you know  it s
in moments like these 
i m reminded
of one profound truth 
life is short 
and it s meant to be lived
with courage
and not laden with fear 
and you have to decide
are your dreams bigger
than your memories 
or will you stay
stuck in the past 
life is meant to be lived 
lived abundantly 
you know  you look around this
cemetery  you see there are   
there are two dates
on every tombstone 
there s a birthdate
and there is a date of death 
every human being
is guaranteed those two dates 
but that little dash
that lies in between
those two numbers 
that s what defines our life 
so make your dash count 
live  really live 
ladies and
gentlemen  let s welcome
our new louisville bats
manager  calvin campbell 
who will now take the mound
to throw out the first pitch 
wow 
i want to dedicate
this first pitch
to someone
very important to me

  but something s gotta give  
  so let it out 
you gotta move on  
  before you lose
all you love  
  and have to
start over again  
  maybe that s how
you ll learn about  
  life  love  and pain  
  you say you re dry now  
  but to me
it looks like rain  
  and i don t want to see you  
  get soaked
all over again     
  dead man walking  
  you re stumbling
down the street  
  at half past 3 00  
  sooner or later
you ll find the police  
  and they ll find me  
  now i can understand  
  if you don t know
who you are  
  and where you wanna go  
  my impatience
is starting to show  
  so pick it up 
pack it all on  
  you better start soon
or i ll be gone  
  i m not gonna wait  
  maybe that s how
you ll learn about  
  life  love  and pain  
  you say you re dry now  
  but to me
it looks like rain  
  and i don t want to see you  
  get soaked all over again  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain  
  life  love  and pain   
  my heart holds a question
between every beat  
  got every answer
beneath my feet  
  fallin  apart 
but i never know why  
  i ve walked every road
but the one that s right  
  been chasin  my tail
instead of my dream  
  life s just a game 
but you play it for keeps  
  the world is kind 
the world is cruel  
  the world you find
depends on you  
  when did i stop believin    
  wake me from this sleep  
  wake me from this sleep  
  save me from these dreams  
  when did i stop believin    
  i guess i m alive 
but i tend to forget  
  i remember the taste
