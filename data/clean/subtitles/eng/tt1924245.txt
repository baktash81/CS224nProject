to find her
and even longer
to let her go

ive ever known
and the hard times
could be rocky
but they were better
than being alone

we were young
and strong
we fought for our freedom

and we all stood together
now it feels like
im standing alone
guess its never

to find a new home
it took a long time
to find her
and even longer
to let her go
and the good days
were the best days
ive ever known
and the hard times
could be rocky
