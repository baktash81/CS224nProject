oh 
hi  mr  and mrs  torres 
   man  please  take a seat 
  thank you  we re getting two for one 
  i guess we ll be home early 
   chuckling 
is this about nando s grades 
because we are working on focus   
uh  it s not about nando s grades 
although  uh  they re not great 
oh  getting better 
we wanted to meet with you together
because  uh  we ve noticed a common theme
in katie and nando s schoolwork 
what s the common theme 
well  here s a haiku
katie wrote in my english class 
 a caged bird am i 
my mother  my sweet captor 
mother  let me fly  
 mother  my sweet captor 
  mother  let me fly  
  five  seven  five  she nailed it  haiku 
i didn t think much of it at first 
until mr  chan told me about a video
that nando made for his history class 
he made a video  that s pretty cool 
let s just have a look at the video 
 sighs 
 nando  the following program
is intended for mature audiences only 
it contains violence 
adult language  and nudity 
viewer discretion is advised 
don t worry  there s no nudity 
  oh  okay 
   scoffs 
phew 
 nando  stalin  mussolini 
and mom 
my mother might not have
had anyone tortured or killed   
not yet 
oh 
 nando    but in our house 
she s no less of a dictator 
so now i m a dictator 
i m not asking twice  nando 
you will do what i say  when i say it 
i m your mother  i don t need a reason 
i don t  so   
 nando  her goal  maximum oppression 
you re not going
till you finish your homework 
i mean  that s parenting 
 chuckles 
stop  it s like 1984 in this house 
big mother is always watching 
i like that nickname  it s tough 
why can t miss hoffling
ever assign a happy book 
 scoffs  okay  they are depressing 
have you ever read little women 
she gets scarlet fever 
  the little prince 
   hoffling  he has no family 
harry potter s an orphan 
there are no happy books 
don t walk away from me 
ow 
 roaring  nando 
 mellow music playing 
 carlos  where are you going 
oh  come on  honey  you can make
anyone look bad with editing 
  you make me look bad 
  me  why me 
because you get to be
the fun dad everybody loves 
and i am stuck being the bad cop 
you didn t see the dad
as the villain in that video  did you 
it ll probably get uploaded to youtube 
then i ll just be the viral psycho mom 
how d you get to be the fun one 
i was the fun one 
look  ally 
i am the bad guy all day at work 
every time i walk into that office 
people stop laughing and leave the room 
but when i come home  the kids 
they actually smile when they see me 
yeah  well  it s not fair 
i hear myself with the kids  and
i think i wouldn t even hang out with me 
   thudding 
   screaming 
i m so sorry  i have a suggestion 
sorry  i didn t mean to frighten you 
i was just eavesdropping or spying 
there are so many parents out there 
and i come in here to hide 
and then i got really hungry 
so i made a huge thing of tots 
 chuckles  would you guys care for a tot 
do you want a tot  a hot tot 
come here  have a hot tot 
have a tot  they re perfectly lukewarm 
who are you 
it s mr  deacon 
katie and nando s guidance counselor 
yes  but thanks to budget cuts 
i m also the pe teacher football coach 
go  cougars  shoot the layup
for the touchdown   scoffs 
i don t know anything about sports 
no  i was a science major 
i specialized in the gastrointestinal
behavior of field mice 
but i do know
a thing or two about parenting 
both professionally and personally 
i have six beautiful kids at home 
timmy  tommy  tonya 
tanya  tyson  and doug 
how come you look like
you re just back from tahiti 
you want to know what my secret is 
i give my kids yes days 
yes days  what s a yes day 
you pick a day
in the not too distant future 
and for 24 hours  you say yes
to everything that your kids want 
 laughing 
   carlos  really 
  yeah 
  are you serious 
  what  you say yes to everything 
well  you set some ground rules 
they can t ask for
something in the future 
and they can t kill anybody  obvi 
hum 
i know it sounds crazy 
but it is a true game changer 
they liberate kids
and give them a rare sense of autonomy 
and it sets the parents free too 
yeah  mr  coach deacon 
i would love to just
take a day off from being a mom
and let my kids do whatever they want 
but i d also love to find
a rainbow unicorn and fly it to the moon 
then i think you d want a pegasus 
more of a pegacorn 
 chuckles 
the point is  you don t know our kids 
oh  these tots have turned 
if we tried what you re proposing 
it    it would be apocalyptic 
you re right  i don t know your kids 
i don t know everything 
but   
i will say this 
you should say yes to a yes day 
ooh  meatloaf 
 kids who are given yes days
consume less sugar  
not really 
 and spend less time on the internet  
it doesn t make sense 
you re not falling for this 
everything happens for a reason 
maybe there s a reason
that guy showed up with those tater tots 
maybe by being a little less serious 
we can make things better 
i mean  you said it yourself 
we ve been trying to do it the right way 
maybe it s time to try something new 
 sighs 
so  tired of hearing how great i am 
you want to give
steven spielberg here a yes day 
what s a yes day 
this new thing where parents agree
to say yes to everything
their kids ask for for 24 hours 
  radical 
  how am i just hearing about this 
well  don t get too excited 
mom probably won t let us have one anyway 
well  what does that mean  why wouldn t i 
 katie  yes days are  like  fun 
and you re  like  a fun killer 
  oh 
  come on  katie  your mom is plenty fun 
she is fun 
 soft music playing 
i have had a very long day 
and i m gonna go to bed 
  so  good night 
   carlos  no  we   
we still need to   
   allison  it s okay 
  honey  tell your mom she s fun 
  nando 
  you told us never to lie 
yeah  daddy 
 faint screaming 
hey  guys 
 whispers  hey 
of course you think your mom can t be fun 
you don t even know me 
i invented fun  i    i used to be
the funnest person i knew 
what happened 
what happened was i had three babies
that had to be kept safe and alive 
it was a lot of pressure 
but that s not the point 
the point is  i can be fun again 
mom  really  there s no way 
 clicks tongue  i ll have a yes day 
we will have a super time 
just you watch and see 
mama can haiku too 
sorry  but you couldn t make it through
a yes morning  let alone a yes day 
 clicks tongue  would you like to have
a little wager on that 
know what  i d love to 
hm  how about this 
if you say no one time 
i get to go to fleekfest with layla 
no adults  no parents 
just us young  underage  vulnerable girls 
wait  honey  are you sure 
i ll take your wager  missy 
because i know that i won t say no 
and when you lose  and you will lose 
i am so fun that
you will still get to go to your concert 
  really 
  absolutely

i ll sit next to you 
and we ll hold hands 
we ll put our hands in the air
