hi
hi
morning
hi
sinful salacious
and extraneous materials
all reading material
and films and television
are off limits
while inside the program
i am using sexual sin
and homosexuality
to fill a godshaped void
in my life
i am using sexual sin
and homosexuality to fill
a godshaped void in my life
but i am not broken
and god loves me
but i am not broken
and god loves me
good that is very true
now somebody tell me
what this is
dollar
a dollar
now no matter how much
you crumple up a dollar bill
you can never take away
its value
now even if you were
to rip it
which would represent
our being severed from christ
well guess what
you can always
tape it back together
jesus puts us back together
and even though
there is a scar
our value does not change
you are somebody
sorry
you are worth something
thats okay jon sit down
and that is a fact
dont spend it
all at once phillip
now this may be the toughest
but most rewarding 12 days that
many of you will ever face
but we have just one task
to bring ourselves back to god
to invite him back in
to understand how
he truly meant to create us
before all those pieces
got torn away
now look i know
the road here wasnt easy
for many of you
but i promise a smoother ride
now that youre here
because we are about to go
on an amazing journey together
so whos ready
that was a question
whos ready say amen
amen
amen
if you know youre worth
a dollar say amen
amen
welcome to the refuge program
come on
thats right great souls
great
now im gonna tell you
something thats
gonna make you immediately
feel a little better
people tell you you can be
born gay thats not true
you cannot be born
a homosexual this is a lie
now im a counselor
and a pastor
but was i born that way
no
its behavioral its a choice
cameron youyou uh
play football
yeah
yeah
were you born that way
no
no
now you chose to be
a football player right
its behavior
now if you if cameron
stops playing football
he no longer is
a football player
we got to learn for ourselves
where behavior comes from
so we can cut it out
and then we can no longer
be labeled that way
now who could tell us
what a genogram is
phillip
well a genograms
like a family tree
only one that shows patterns
of family behavior as well
sort of like
an illustrated one
yes now we are going to draw
our family tree
and were gonna list
next to these people
their behavioral sin
so they made us
and they labeled us
so were gonna label them
michael can you read
the behavioral sins
we use the letters ssa or h
to label same sex attraction
or homosexuality
d for drugs
a dollar sign for gambling
a alcoholism
p promiscuity
m mental illness
capital a lowercase b
for abortion
capital p lowercase o
for pornography
and c or g
criminal or gang affiliation
forgetting dv
domestic violence
capital d lowercase
v domestic violence
okay guys

oh um i filled out
your homework for you
i was only in a gang
for a year or so until i
went down for drugs
got sent to prison
haha
i put your uncle vincent
down there
youve never met him cause
he uh moved to louisiana
when you were little so
we just never see him
we always figured that he
he was very femininelike
you might say
all right
oh im tired
nightnight
good night
what is a real man
and what does
a real man look like
does anybody know
guys uncross your legs
posture come on
now perhaps being close
to the flames of hell
and finding your way back
shows a great strength
and if that were so then
if this isnt a real man
then i dont know what is
this is brandon ellis guys
i want you to say hello
thanks sykes
make him welcome
over to you brandon
thank you
god bless god bless
a real man to me
is a man of god
first and foremost
and im a man of god no doubt
i guess that counts me in
but i wasnt once
if i was ever listed
on my own sons genograms
thered be so many of these
letters next to my name
it would look
like qualifications
for some fancy university
drugs violence gang crime
prison time
but i actually believe
im qualified to be here
not because ive ever had the
types of thoughts and feelings
that yall are wrestling with
or that your other
guidance counselors
have overcome righteously
but ive had all sorts
of my own trials
that took me so far away
from the lord
that it is a true miracle
that im standing here
before you today
but i am
i am
standing leaning sitting
all the same idea
triangles are
the strongest shape
hand or hands on hips go
save yourself
fingers forward not back
just the way it is
think of the shapes
youre making and ask yourself
is this a manly shape
im making
or is it a girly
or feminine shape
sarah come on up here
come on
you delicate flower you
okay
i want you to arrange
these guys into a line
in terms of masculinity
if you will
go on you can do it
follow your instincts
myself and other addicts
and alcoholics
put our faith in aa
get familiar with this phrase
knees up
fake it till you make it
knees up body up push
and yall folks and kids being
what youre afflicted with
better learn how to survive
when youre in prison
youd surprise yourself
what you could do to fit in
come on phillip
eye on the ball
come on okay next
fake it till you make it
become the man you are not
so you think cameron here
is the big winner huh
you think being big and tall
and overeating
immediately puts a guy
at the front of the line
but its more than triangles
or postures
and genetics
firm handshake
lets go do it
you got to pick up the bat
hold the bat up
ow
ooh
get back up on that horse
all right
just get him out of there
lee youre gonna be okay
come on
jared youre up next
thats good
military man
god bless son
who you are on the inside
can be affected by the outside
outside in
fake it till you make it
adapt to survive
ah see
thats a batting stance
thats what im talking about
boom
lesbian gay bisexual
transsexual
whatever that is
multisexual
intellectual sexual
i mean what else do you want
unicorns squirrels
cupcakes i mean rainbows
theres so much choice
in this group
but hey think about this
what are the consequences
to those choices
have a look at this
rape abuse aids
what sinful things
have yall done
moral inventory
catalog your sins
and ask gods forgiveness
who is ready
sarah
i would look at other girls
in the changing rooms
before gym
and in the showers
my biggest sin is one
that i am also thankful for
because it has led me
to love in action
doing well sarah carry on
i had run away
from my uncles house
and stayed
with some girls i knew
whose parents were away
it was there
that i finally acted
on my homosexual thoughts
come on sarah
i let a girl touch my
kiss mmy
my vagina
nobodys judging come on
and put
her fingers inside me
and i did the same
i renounce these
sinful thoughts and actions
and ask god to forgive me
all these things

a momentary straying

the path of faith
and that he strive to be honest
and that he then find the joy
of a new life
in his name we pray
amen
jared
hows college treating you
ah its going good yeah
its good
your fathers asked me
to take some of your blood
he wants me to to check
for testosterone levels
im in a bit of
a bind here jared
and ii said this
to your mother too
now i am a religious woman
therestheres nono question
but i have also been
to medical school
and well you could say that
i hold science in one hand
and god in the other
and that is not always
an easy balance
and i know that everybody would
like for me to say otherwise
and send you down
to the pharmacy for aa pill
that would magically fix you
but thats not gonna happen
but im gonna take your blood
and i know
i know what its gonna show me
that you are
a perfectly normal
very healthy teenage boy
jared itsits not my place
to tell you
that your parents are wrong
but lets say
that they are wrong
i understand
your father signed you up
for a program next month
whatever happens next
it is still your choice
it may not feel that way
but it is
youre 18
do you have anything
that youd
youd like to say to me
anyany questions
no
jared
morning
so i wanted to talk to you
about these
uh your writing
this uh
remy and lucy met at midnight
under the stars
on willow street
whatwhat
tell me about these
well itsits just
itsits a story
its a love story about
a boy and a girl correct
yeah
but were you
thinking about two boys
when you wrote this
no
i mean be honest
no its just a story
its just an assignment
for college
jared ive seen your
reading list for college
i have it here and listen
the picture of dorian gray
lolita
ii mean some of
ththese books jared
considering everything thats
going on for you right now
i dont know that college
is really the best thing
for you to be pursuing at all
a year with us may be
a much much better use
of your time
given everything that i see
and everything thats at stake
and im willing to say that
to your parents
listen ive had many
wonderful conversations
with your parents
lovely people
so i know some of the story
and i know that there is
quite a discrepancy
between what they were told
and what you said
and you got to understand that
they dont know
what to believe
and thats very troubling
for them
but i think that you and i know
that there is a whole lot more
to the story
and you know were not here
on mere thoughts alone
jared thethe people who get
the most out of this place
are the people that are just
really brave andand honest
andand lay everything on
the table ugly as it seems
andand fess up
to what god already sees
and then i can
really truly assess
what is the best future
for you
okay son
yeah yeah
dear heavenly father
today i ask your forgiveness
for my sins
for a year we lived together
under the cover
of being roommates
but in reality the whole time
i was committing
the sin of sodomy
and then my family
discovered the truth
and brought me back
to my senses
they helped me realize
that i was fooling myself
that i was being fooled
that i was seduced
into a life of sin
by all sorts of sinful people
and i knew in my heart
that i had forsaken jesus
for satan
but now
i am awake to my sins
im enlightened
im here with all of you
and i am disgusted at
the person that i once was
i want to ask god
for his forgiveness
and i want to thank
all of you guys
especially you mr sykes
for helping me get back
on the path to righteousness
we love you gary
we love you gary
please dont do that honey
you know i dont
mom who did that happen to
and when seriously
do you know
do you actually know
who that happened to
it never happened
parents want to
protect their kids
so they feed them lies
i think that theyre okay lies
what like not telling me
how long i might be here for
you know the whole thing
you and dad are paying for here
is all about how messed up
we are by our parents
they want to know about you
thats why you cant know
all about it
cause then they wouldnt
get their money out of you
what have i ever
done to you hmm
talk about me all you want
my conscience is clean
honey
im gonna go for a run
is that okay mom
mmhmm
fuck you
fuck you
fuck you
please please
give me strength
i need your help
amen
im reading it no debate
i have a right to know
what theyre teaching you
i dont see why anyone
would read it
unless you absolutely had to
i need to know whats inside
there are tons of
spelling errors in it
i almost want to mark up
a copy for them
but that would take away
the only real enjoyment
you get from reading it
cause i guess its actually
not much fun to be there
and im starting to wonder
whether its really
gonna change me
we always come back
to dogs true design
almighty dog
welcome to god versus science

you know that night
when pastor wilkes and jim
came to the house
those men decided what to do
with you and i just
i fell into line
like i usually do
they say sometimes
you got to hurt a child
in order to help them
and that may be so
with some things but
a mother knows
when something isnt right
and i knew in my bones
this wasnt hurting to help
i was just letting you down
and i kept my mouth shut
and i will always regret that
but i can do
a different thing now
now that i have a chance
ill handle your father
he can fall into line with me
for a change
some folk
they dont go to church
for the right reasons
now you know the type
of person im talking about
they just turn up
they dont use every day
of their christian life
to praise the lord
and to help bring others
to his word
it might be your neighbor
it might be your friend
it might be just a face
you only ever see at church
they just turn up
i will tell you something
that i know
just turning up to church
does not make you a christian
yes sir
amen
study the bible
study his word
i guarantee you
every question you have
you gonna find an answer
in this book
yes

that simple
for your father
its a little more complicated
i wish it wasnt but it is
did you hear about
the article ive got
coming out in the times
do you know what its about
i dont want to get
into a fight
your mother told me son
its not a fight
im just
doing the right thing
im letting you know
ive written more
and the publishers are
talking about me putting
together a whole book
you dont need to read
any of it
i just needed you to know
thatthat it might
be out there
well now i know
but it might be good
for you to read
because you never really asked
what went on there
you never really knew
the staff or
or
youre right youre right
when the situation came up
i did what ive often done
in my life
i sought the counsel
of wiser men
and i followed their advice
what would you do now
now that youre running things
enough
good night
for me
is there something
you need help with
cause you know
i got to make my flight
yeah now this was
gonna be for christmas
but uh well you know
your mother tells me
you like to drive upstate
sometimes to write
dad i live in new york
i dont need a car
she also tells me
you like to write by hand
before you use your computer
just like me
this pen
is made from a cedar tree
grown in israel
guided me
ive written every sermon
that ive ever delivered
in this new church
with this pen
one writer to another
i dont want
to pretend anymore
we dont need
to spend time together
we dont need to speak
unless were gonna talk
to each other properly
like youyouve done
some things
that have really hurt me
likelike you never
you never asked
if there was more
to my story at college
you never asked if i was okay
you were too focused
on how it affected you
there are so many things
that weve never spoken about
and i dont know
if we ever will
yeah
you know all this
was gonna be yours
ii mean it still will be
but i meant to run and to
make a living from
i understand
we all got our own paths
the truth is
i want you to do well
i want you to have
a great life
i love you
but i cant pretend either
there are things
i disagree with
and ill admit
im gonna be honest
im you know
i am being prideful
when i resent the fact that
i may never be a grandparent
now thats just the truth
its hard for me to admit
that i have hurt you
and that with my beliefs
and with all thats gone on
i understand ii may have
set myself up to lose you
and ive had to ask myself
and god
if im ready for that
i do not want to lose you
well it doesnt feel like that
im sick of avoiding you
im sick of talking
about nothing
im sick of it
im gay and im your son
and neither of those things
are going to change
okay so lets deal with that
or lets call it a day
both of us would be okay
but that would be a shame
im not changing
theres no changing me
god knows i tried
so if you mean it
if you really mean that
and youre not ready
to lose me
then im sorry
but youre gonna have to be
the one to change
i understand
i am gonna try
ill try
i got to get going
dad
ive invited mom
