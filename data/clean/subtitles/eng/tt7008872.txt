  hi 
  hi 
  morning 
  hi 
    sinful  salacious 
 and extraneous materials 
 all reading material
and films and television
are off limits
while inside the program  
i am using sexual sin
and homosexuality
to fill a god shaped void
in my life 
i am using sexual sin
and homosexuality to fill
a god shaped void in my life 
but i am not broken 
and god loves me 
but i am not broken 
  and god loves me 
  good  that is very true 
now  somebody tell me
what this is 
dollar 
a dollar 
now  no matter how much
you crumple up a dollar bill   
you can never take away
its value 
now  even if you were
to rip it   
which would represent
our being severed from christ   
well  guess what 
you can always
tape it back together 
jesus puts us back together 
and even though
there is a scar 
our value does not change 
  you are somebody 
  sorry 
you are worth something 
that s okay  jon  sit down 
and that is a fact 
don t spend it
all at once  phillip 
now  this may be the toughest
but most rewarding 12 days that
many of you will ever face 
but we have just one task 
to bring ourselves back to god 
to invite him back in 
to understand how
he truly meant to create us
before all those pieces
got torn away 
now  look  i know
the road here wasn t easy
for many of you 
but i promise a smoother ride
now that you re here 
because we are about to go
on an amazing journey together 
so who s ready 
that was a question 
who s ready  say  amen  
  amen 
  amen 
if you know you re worth
a dollar  say  amen  
amen 
welcome to the refuge program 
come on 
that s right  great souls 
great 
now  i m gonna tell you
something that s
gonna make you immediately
feel a little better 
people tell you you can be
born gay  that s not true 
you cannot be born
a homosexual  this is a lie 
now  i m a counselor
and a pastor 
but was i born that way 
no 
it s behavioral  it s a choice 
cameron  you you  uh 
play football 
  yeah 
  yeah 
were you born that way 
  no 
  no 
now  you chose to be
a football player  right 
it s behavior 
now  if you    if cameron
stops playing football 
he no longer is
a football player 
we got to learn for ourselves
where behavior comes from 
so we can cut it out 
and then we can no longer
be labeled that way 
now  who could tell us
what a genogram is 
phillip 
well  a genogram s
like a family tree 
only one that shows patterns
of family behavior as well 
sort of like
an illustrated one 
yes  now  we are going to draw
our family tree 
and we re gonna list
next to these people
their behavioral sin 
so  they made us   
and they labeled us 
so we re gonna label them 
michael  can you read
the behavioral sins 
we use the letters  ssa  or  h 
to label same sex attraction
or homosexuality 
 d  for drugs 
a dollar sign for gambling 
 a   alcoholism 
 p   promiscuity 
 m   mental illness 
capital  a  lowercase  b 
for abortion 
capital  p  lowercase  o 
for pornography 
and  c  or  g  
criminal or gang affiliation 
forgetting  dv  
domestic violence 
capital  d  lowercase
 v   domestic violence 
okay  guys 
let s dive right in 
let s grab some cards
and some markers 
i want you to write  em down   
and put the letters
next to their name 
i know they re family 
but i can guarantee that one
or some of these people
are the reason that
you re at love in action 
so  jared  you must be
the preacher s son 
you know or you don t know 
what s the question mark for 
uncle chris is an alcoholic 
hmm 
well  this must be pretty tough
on your family  hmm 
 give ear 
o my people  to my law 
 incline your ears
to the words of my mouth 
 i will open my mouth
in a parable 
i will utter dark sayings

it is a great idea 
you re both mature kids
who know how
to conduct themselves 
and who  by now 
know how the world works 
you know  son 
small steps toward manhood 
that s the way to learn 
that way you don t

dear heavenly father

this is just
an assessment program 
until they know

hey  listen 
just lean into it  man 
yeah 
do the work 
and trust me  man   
you re gonna love it here 
aren t you gonna tell me
about your day 
we re not meant to talk
about it outside of group 
i don t need gossip 
i just   
i just mean generally 
i m gonna lean into it 
and there are some good people 
and  yeah  i like it 
i m excited to be here 
that s good 
do we have people in the family
who had issues
with any of this stuff 
pornography 
mom 
drugs 
gang affiliat   
gang affiliations 
what is this 
i need to know for homework 
why do they need to know
about the family 
our family is so normal 
big day tomorrow  hmm 
you get some good sleep  now 
oh  um  i filled out
your homework for you 
i was only in a gang
for a year or so  until i   
went down for drugs 
got sent to prison 
ha ha 
i put your uncle vincent
down there 
you ve never met him   cause
he  uh  moved to louisiana
when you were little  so   
we just never see him 
we always figured that he   
he was very feminine like 
you might say 
all right 
oh  i m tired 
  night night 
  good night 
what is    a real man 
and what does
a real man look like 
does anybody know 
guys  uncross your legs 
posture  come on 
now  perhaps being close
to the flames of hell
and finding your way back
shows a great strength 
and if that were so  then   
if this isn t a real man 
then i don t know what is 
this is brandon ellis  guys 
  i want you to say hello 
  thanks  sykes 
make him welcome 
over to you  brandon 
thank you 
god bless  god bless 
a real man  to me 
is a man of god 
first and foremost 
and i m a man of god  no doubt 
i guess that counts me in 
but i wasn t once 
if i was ever listed
on my own son s genograms 
there d be so many of these
letters next to my name 
it would look
like qualifications
for some fancy university 
drugs  violence  gang crime 
prison time 
but i actually believe
i m qualified to be here 
not because i ve ever had the
types of thoughts and feelings
that y all are wrestling with
or that your other
guidance counselors
have overcome righteously 
but i ve had all sorts
of my own trials
that took me so far away
from the lord
that it is a true miracle
that i m standing here
before you today 
but i am 
i am 
standing  leaning  sitting 
all the same idea 
triangles are
the strongest shape 
hand or hands on hips  go 
save yourself 
fingers forward  not back 
just the way it is 
think of the shapes
you re making and ask yourself 
is this a manly shape
i m making 
or is it a girly
or feminine shape 
sarah  come on up here 
come on 
you delicate flower  you 
okay 
i want you to arrange
these guys into a line
in terms of masculinity 
if you will 
go on  you can do it 
follow your instincts 
myself and other addicts
and alcoholics
put our faith in aa 
  get familiar with this phrase 
  knees up 
  fake it till you make it 
  knees up  body up  push 
and y all folks and kids  being
what you re afflicted with 
better learn how to survive 
when you re in prison 
you d surprise yourself
what you could do to fit in 
come on  phillip 
eye on the ball 
come on  okay  next 
fake it till you make it 
become the man you are not 
so you think cameron here
is the big winner  huh 
you think being big and tall
and overeating
immediately puts a guy
at the front of the line 
but it s more than triangles
or postures
and genetics 
firm handshake 
let s go  do it 
you got to pick up the bat 
hold the bat up 
  ow 
  ooh   
get back up on that horse 
all right 
just get him out of there 
  lee  you re gonna be okay 
  come on 
jared  you re up next 
that s good 
military man 
god bless  son 
who you are on the inside
can be affected by the outside 
outside in 
fake it till you make it 
adapt to survive 
ah  see 
that s a batting stance 
that s what i m talking about 
boom 
lesbian  gay  bisexual 
transsexual   
whatever that is   
multisexual 
intellectual sexual 
i mean  what else do you want 
unicorns  squirrels 
cupcakes  i mean  rainbows 
there s so much choice
in this group 
but  hey  think about this 
what are the consequences
to those choices 
have a look at this 
rape  abuse  aids 
what sinful things
have y all done 
moral inventory 
catalog your sins
and ask god s forgiveness 
who is ready 
sarah 
 i would look at other girls
 in the changing rooms
before gym
 and in the showers 
 my biggest sin is one
that i am also thankful for 
because it has led me
to love in action  
doing well  sarah  carry on 
 i had run away
from my uncle s house
 and stayed
with some girls i knew
 whose parents were away 
 it was there
that i finally acted
on my homosexual thoughts  
come on  sarah 
 i let a girl touch my   
 kiss m my   
   my vagina    
nobody s judging  come on 
    and put
her fingers inside me 
 and i did the same 
 i renounce these
sinful thoughts and actions 
and ask god to forgive me
all these things  
very good 
we love you  sarah 
all right  repeat after me 
we love you  sarah 
we love you  sarah

for one of your flock  jared 
who has lost his way 
we pray  lord 
that you make him pure
and that you return him
safely back to us
and see that the errors
of his way
are nothing more than
a momentary straying 
we pray that he see
the path of faith
and that he strive to be honest
and that he then find the joy
of a new life 
in his name we pray

and    well  you could say that
i hold science in one hand
and god in the other 
and that is not always
an easy balance 
and i know that everybody would
like for me to say otherwise
and send you down
to the pharmacy for a a pill
that would magically fix you 
but that s not gonna happen 
but i m gonna take your blood 
and i know 
i know what it s gonna show me 
that you are
a perfectly normal 
very healthy teenage boy 
jared  it s it s not my place
to tell you
that your parents are wrong 
but let s say
that they are wrong 
i understand
your father signed you up
for a program next month 
whatever happens next 
it is still your choice 
it may not feel that way 
but it is 
you re 18 
do you have anything
that you d   
you d like to say to me 
any any questions 
no 
jared 
morning 
so    i wanted to talk to you
about these 
uh  your writing 
this  uh 
 remy and lucy met at midnight
under the stars
on willow street  
what what   
tell me about these 
well  it s it s just 
it s it s a story 
it s a love story about
a boy and a girl  correct 
  yeah 
  but were you
thinking about two boys
when you wrote this 
no 
i mean  be honest 
no  it s just a story 
it s just an assignment
for college 
jared  i ve seen your
reading list for college 
i have it here  and listen 
the picture of dorian gray 
lolita 
i i mean  some of
th these books  jared 
considering everything that s
going on for you right now 
i don t know that college
is really the best thing
for you to be pursuing at all 
a year with us may be
a much  much better use
of your time 
given everything that i see 
and everything that s at stake 
and i m willing to say that
to your parents 
listen  i ve had many
wonderful conversations
with your parents   
lovely people 
so  i know some of the story 
and i know that there is
quite a discrepancy
between what they were told
and what you said 
and you got to understand that
they don t know
what to believe 
and that s very troubling
for them 
but i think that you and i know
that there is a whole lot more
to the story 
and  you know  we re not here
on mere thoughts alone 
jared  the the people who get
the most out of this place
are the people that are just
really brave and and honest
and and lay everything on
the table  ugly as it seems 
and and fess up
to what god already sees 
and then i can
really truly assess
what is the best future
for you 
okay  son 
yeah  yeah 
dear heavenly father 
today i ask your forgiveness
for my sins 
for a year  we lived together
under the cover
of being roommates 
but in reality  the whole time 
i was committing
the sin of sodomy 
and then my family
discovered the truth
and brought me back
to my senses 
they helped me realize
that i was fooling myself 
that i was being fooled 
that i was seduced
into a life of sin
by all sorts of sinful people 
and i knew in my heart
that i had forsaken jesus
for satan 
but now   
   i am awake to my sins 
i m enlightened 
i m here with all of you 
and i am disgusted at
the person that i once was 
i want to ask god
for his forgiveness 
and i want to thank
all of you guys 
especially you  mr  sykes 
for helping me get back
on the path to righteousness 
we love you  gary 
we love you  gary 
please don t do that  honey 
you know i don t   
mom  who did that happen to
and when  seriously 
do you know 
do you actually know
who that happened to 
it never happened 
parents want to
protect their kids 
so they feed them lies 
i think that they re okay lies 
what  like not telling me
how long i might be here for 
you know  the whole thing
you and dad are paying for here
is all about how messed up
we are by our parents 
they want to know about you 
that s why you can t know
all about it 
 cause then they wouldn t
get their money out of you 
what have i ever
done to you  hmm 
talk about me all you want 
my conscience is clean 
honey 
i m gonna go for a run 
is that okay  mom 
mm hmm 
fuck you 
fuck you 
fuck you 
please  please
give me strength 
i need your help 
amen 
i m reading it  no debate 
i have a right to know
what they re teaching you 
i don t see why anyone
would read it
unless you absolutely had to 
i need to know what s inside 
there are tons of
spelling errors in it 
i almost want to mark up
a copy for them 
but that would take away
the only real enjoyment
you get from reading it 
 cause i guess it s    actually
not much fun to be there 
and i m starting to wonder
whether it s really
gonna change me 
 we always come back
to dog s true design  
almighty dog 
welcome to god versus science 
thank you 
look up there   
welcome to this exhibit 
where are you from  xavier 
i was born in vienna 
i ended up in canada 
and now i m here 
do you believe in god 
i do  yeah 
wow 
i question it  but i still
believe in god  yeah 
who created the earth 
you like a little
small talk  huh 
do you believe in the devil 
does he look like me 
i don t know 
do you know job from the bible 
not personally 
i hear he s not great company 
always complaining 
i i imagine i m him sometimes 
and that god and the devil
are having a bet over me 
that one day
god will let let me in
on the experiment
he was having to test me 
i think we re our own god 
i mean  i think he s in us 
in all of us  not    you know 
somewhere hiding and watching 
stay with me 
nothing needs to happen 
i swear 
i ll prove to you
that god won t strike you down 
you wronged me  dad  and i   
  and i hate the way that   
  louder  cameron 
can t hear you 
come on  i ll bring him closer 
there he is 
you wronged me  dad 
and i hate you for the way
that you  that you treated me
since you found out
about my problems 
no  about your sin  say that 
 about my sins   go 
 about my sins  
come on  cameron 
 my homosexual sins  
come on  cameron 
  cameron 
  i can go 
  i don t  i don t mind   
  no  no  no  no 
jared  everybody gets a turn 
this is cameron s turn 
 about my sins   come on 
found out about my sins 
i hate that you never listen
to me or acknowledge me 
and when you do acknowledge me 
it s to make fun of me
in front of my friends 
 it s to make fun of me  
to make fun of me
in front of my friends 
and that  and that time
that you told me
that you wished
i d never been born 
that really hurt me 
cameron   
now  you say that you re angry 
but  quite frankly 
i don t really see it 
well  what s going on
in there  cameron 
huh 
do you want to change 
now  you re gonna wish
you hadn t have been born  son 
because god will not love you
the way that you are right now 
unless you really
want to change 
well  come on 
well  i guess not 
i guess not  okay 
let s take a break 
and you are gonna stay here
until you re ready to go 
everybody but cameron 
take a break 
i don t care
if you sit there all day  son 
is this all a game to you 
what do you mean 
listen  man 
you got to think about
why you went there 
you re trying to bail him out 
seriously 
and touching him like that 
do you think no one saw 
you saw him 
he was very upset 
  i didn t mean anything by it 
  i should report you 
true ownership  man  okay 
this is what moral inventory
is all about 
and you got to quit
staring at me all the time 
these are the urges
that we got to stamp out 
okay  you got to control this 
  do you even want this to work 
  of course i do 
we re all trying
to make this work 
i m having a tough time  too 
just like you are 
listen  i m fine 
doesn t seem like it 
hey  what are you
doing in here alone 
you re meant to attend bathroom
breaks with a staff member 
what 
now you don t have to pee 
or are you gonna do
something solo 
that s why
they make them rules 
not to be trusted 
not at this stage of the game 
hmm 
sounds like morse code 
sending me a message   
faggot 
starting to see it
for what it is 
are you okay 
i m fine  i m fine 
i m gonna give you some advice 
play the part 
show  em it s working 
you re getting better 
fake it until you make it 
right 
you don t want to end up
in one of those houses
for any length of time 
i ve heard the stories 
and they re not good 
and that s where
you re likely gonna end up 
sarah s already there 
so  play the part  man 
and then  once you re home 
you got to figure out
what to do next 
if it comes down to it 
you may have to walk away
from everything 
everyone 
thank you for today  michael 
  see you tomorrow 
  mm hmm 
you re gonna be
on the podium any day now 
so you should have a plan 
unless you really think
you can change 
or even want to 
i don t want
to be here anymore 
it s a trial  it   
  i don t feel good here 
  nobody feels good
  about you being there  jared 
  i i don t  i don t   
i m not sure
if i feel any different 
son  son  you re

why didn t you tell me
how long i might stay for 
none of us knows
the answer to that  jared 
it s kind of up to you 
you know  you just got to
give it a chance 
this is like
the book of matthew 
the devil s not gonna
ask you once 
he s gonna ask you
over and over again  son 
and you have just got to find
the strength and commitment
inside you 
you can get through this  okay

you know that night   
when pastor wilkes and jim
came to the house 
those men decided what to do
with you  and i just   
i fell into line 
like i usually do 
they say sometimes
you got to hurt a child
in order to help them 
and that may be so
with some things  but   
a mother knows
when something isn t right 
and i knew in my bones   
this wasn t hurting to help 
i was just letting you down 
and i kept my mouth shut 
and i will always regret that 
but i can do
a different thing now 
now that i have a chance 
i ll handle your father 
he can fall into line with me
for a change 
some folk 
they don t go to church
for the right reasons 
now  you know the type
of person i m talking about 
they just turn up 
they don t use every day
of their christian life   
to praise the lord
and to help bring others
to his word 
it might be your neighbor 
it might be your friend 
it might be just a face
you only ever see at church 
they just turn up 
i will tell you something
that i know 
just turning up to church
does not make you a christian 
  yes  sir 
  amen 
study the bible 
study his word 
i guarantee you 
every question you have   
you gonna find an answer
in this book 
  yes 
  amen

mom  what s going on
with you two 
jared  it s   
he knows 
i can t be around the   
i love god 
god loves me 
and i love my son 
that simple 
for your father 
it s a little more complicated 
i wish it wasn t  but it is 
did you hear about
the article i ve got
coming out in the times 
do you know what it s about 
i don t want to get
into a fight 
  your mother told me  son 
  it s not a fight 
i m just   
doing the right thing 
i m letting you know 
i ve written more 
and the publishers are
talking about me putting
together a whole book 
you don t need to read
any of it 
i just needed you to know
that that it might
be out there 
well    now i know 
but it might be good
for you to read 
because you never really asked
what went on there 
you never really knew
the staff or   
  or   
  you re right  you re right 
when the situation came up 
i did what i ve often done
in my life 
i sought the counsel
of wiser men 
and i followed their advice 
what would you do now 
now that you re running things 
enough 
good night 
for me 
is there something
you need help with 
 cause  you know 
i got to make my flight 
yeah  now  this was
gonna be for christmas 
but  uh  well  you know 
your mother tells me
you like to drive upstate
sometimes to write 
dad  i live in new york 
i don t need a car 
she also tells me   
you like to write by hand
before you use your computer 
just like me 
this pen   
is made from a cedar tree
grown in israel 
guided me 
i ve written every sermon
that i ve ever delivered
in this new church
with this pen 
one writer to another 
i don t want
to pretend anymore 
we don t need
to spend time together 
we don t need to speak
unless we re gonna talk
to each other properly 
like    you you ve done
some things
that have really hurt me 
like like you never 
you never asked
if there was more
to my story at college 
you never asked if i was okay 
you were too focused
on how it affected you 
there are so many things
that we ve never spoken about 
and i don t know
if we ever will 
yeah 
you know  all this
was gonna be yours 
i i mean  it still will be 
but i meant to run and to   
make a living from 
i understand 
we all got our own paths 
the truth is
i want you to do well 
i want you to have
a great life 
i love you 
but i can t pretend  either 
there are things
i disagree with 
and i ll admit 
i m gonna be honest 
i m  you know   
i am being prideful
when i resent the fact that
i may never be a grandparent 
now  that s just the truth 
it s hard for me to admit
that i have hurt you 
and that with my beliefs
and with all that s gone on 
i understand i i may have
set myself up to lose you 
and i ve had to ask myself 
and god 
if i m ready for that 
i do not want to lose you 
well  it doesn t feel like that 
i m sick of avoiding you 
i m sick of talking
about nothing 
i m sick of it 
i m gay  and i m your son 
and neither of those things
are going to change 
okay  so let s deal with that 
or let s call it a day 
both of us would be okay 
but that would be a shame 
i m not changing 
there s no changing me 
god knows i tried 
so if you mean it   
if you really mean that   
   and you re not ready
to lose me   
then i m sorry 
but you re gonna have to be
the one to change 
i understand 
i am gonna try 
i ll try 
i got to get going 
dad   
i ve invited mom
