from here to madonna dei prati
and my dicks length
is from here to piacenza
and its as fast as a train too
trains are real machines
not that rake there
i like to drive that rake
youre against progress
it makes me work less and im happy
but who do you think pays for it
the master does
we pay for machines with our work
first he passed his lice on to paride
and then to the little one
i tried to delouse him
but he always runs away
its not only the lice today olmo
made my nina eat a living frog
and what do you know
about philosophy nothing
im the only one who went
to the meeting of the league
because you can go to meetings
only if you understand things
then you can go around
speaking of justice
inside the isolated cottages
where honest peasants work hard
while the rich bourgeois
despises his labour
amen
look at him
whos crying
rosina wants to send olmo to the seminary
why
because hes a devil
they want to take away my son
make him become a priest
you wanted to had fun
now cry

if you could see yourself mr alfredo
you didnt die like a master
and why did you untie all the cows
to make me work harder

maybe the truth is
that when someone has nothing to do
they have too much time to think
and thinking too much
they become dotards
at least we knew each other
i knew you were the one who ruled
now its a mess
who knows how everything will end

follow me everyone
to cut it short
we lost everything
wine tomatoes potatoes
grain the whole harvest
therefore we must
all make sacrifices
dont we leo
so the cat stole your tongue
tell them how much wheat we lost
half as much
at least
therefore its simple we
must live with half wage
but when the harvest is double
we dont get double wage
to be honest if i had to
act out of my own interest
i should send you all home
especially you labourers
youre a bunch of ignorants
you should be grateful to me
because the only one
whos really losing here is me
and by the way whos the master
who rules here
you
we lost everything didnt you hear me
and you have big ears too
speaking dialect
lets get inside

i asked you if you know

desolina today youll go
to the village to get some milk
and dont stop talking to anyone
thats crazy we have to buy the milk
when the stables full of cows
strikes are intolerably arrogant
theyre against civil principles
those people arent reasonable
the old man included
theyll have to give up
and cows will explode
and wheat will rot in the fields
you eat
listen
negotiations between
the trade union and
the agrarian association
have fallen through
well send lancers
to the sites on strike
well reply to boycotts
boycotting the league
stop it
this is the official report
well reply to the strike with a lockout
well reply to violence with violence
the whip is necessary against
subverting beastly instincts
granddad who are the strikebreakers
theyre dogs who go
to work when the strikes on
why dont they like the strike
because theyre poorer
and more ignorant than us

olmo put it back thats not ours
wasnt it halfandhalf
olmo when you were away
many things changed
weve always been
paid half harvest
the master had to rent machines
and pay new labourers
so what
its been a bad year
long live our hero
even half harvest would be a theft
because were the ones who work
you dont even want to go fiftyfifty
wanna know why i had
to hire so many labourers
because you all went to die at war
like idiots
dad you have no right to say that
shut up and play with
tin soldiers if you wish
wanna know how much it cost me
to keep you at home
how much
more than what youre worth
i wanted to go too but you stopped me
sure
thats a beautiful sword
indeed it is
its sharp too very sharp
look dad
congratulations lieutenant
is that all you can do
when i was your age i got up
at 4 am to check the stables
you all shouldnt forget that
i was the first to get up
in threshing times
and i was the last to go to sleep
try to deny it
deny it if you can
youre so good little cousin
thanks i can do better
to widen the farm
these are no longer values
respectability devotion
to the church love for the land
loyalty to ones family
and faith into the banks
calm down please
and respect
respect respect respect
what the master means is
that there was no one left to work here
so he had to rent new machines
which he paid grain for
as he does with you all
machines which make life easier
theyre a change
they mean progress
theyre great
dont you agree
its heavy isnt it
hey what are you doing
stop it
stop it the army
didnt teach you anything
whos that
attila melanchini my dads new farmer
im a soldier like you
you heard the master
he gave you all what he could
from now on well work together
by the way i understand you
no olmo olmo
enough
women did you hear the master
its our mens fault
because they went to die in war
its the labourers fault too
because they work
and want to be paid for it
its our fault because we get hungry
and catch pellagra
and its also our fault if
2 out of 3 of our kids die
the master wont be ruined
if we take some more of our grain
and leave the rest to him
come on help yourselves
you speak too well to be a peasant
