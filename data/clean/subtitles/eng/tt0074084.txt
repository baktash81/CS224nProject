from here to madonna dei prati 
about 3 kilometres 
once i saw a train whose length was
from here to madonna dei prati 
and my dick s length
is from here to piacenza 
and it s as fast as a train too 
trains are real machines 
not that rake there 
i like to drive that rake 
you re against progress 
it makes me work less  and i m happy 
  but who do you think pays for it 
  the master does 
we pay for machines with our work 
first he passed his lice on to paride
and then to the little one
i tried to delouse him 
but he always runs away 
it s not only the lice  today olmo
made my nina eat a living frog 
   and what do you know
about philosophy  nothing 
i m the only one who went
to the meeting of the league 
because you can go to meetings
only if you understand things 
then you can go around
speaking of justice
inside the isolated cottages
where honest peasants work hard 
while the rich bourgeois
despises his labour 
amen 
look at him 
  who s crying 
  rosina wants to send olmo to the seminary 
  why 
  because he s a devil 
they want to take away my son 
make him become a priest 
you wanted to had fun 
now cry 
leave her be  that s a long time ago 
all the bastards
end up being evil 
bastard  who s a bastard 
there are no bastards in my house 
olmo is your children s brother
because his father is one of us 
isn t it true  rosina 
tell them  rosina 
as you know 
of course i know  it s true 
who else could know 
olmo

come here  remember this 
you ll learn to read and write 
but you ll always be olmo d alc 
the son of a peasant 
a poor unfortunate 
you ll serve in the army
and you ll see the world 
you must learn to obey 
and to be kicked in the ass 
you ll get married and will have to
work hard to raise your children 
  but who will you always be 
  olmo d alc 
olmo d alc  the peasant 
understood 
no priests in this house 
  what have you got there 
  a coin  it s mine 
mr  giovanni gave it to me
in change for my frogs

ottavio is a real gentleman like me 
i wasn t born a nun

  do you want to fire a shot

or you ll go to hell 
shit face 
  who taught you that

and no one will have my land 
not even a square yard of it 
you can say what you want
but your father has a thing for ottavio 
i m here only because i want
the land  all of it  otherwise   
if you want to know the truth 
i ve always envied ottavio  always 
i wish i could stay away
from this family problems 
enjoy life  eat up all the money
in 6 months  have a new woman every day 
  love is an arrow
  which brings my words to you     
a fucking gulf 
poor thing 
you didn t have to force him to eat 
he s my son  and no one
can tell me how to raise him 
alfredo 
don t worry  when
he gets hungry he ll be back 
these aren t lice 
these are chickens 
keep still 
you ll see  you ll look
like a nice ravish 
don t move  stay still 
they ll never find me 
i ll leave with uncle ottavio 
alfredo

if my father had been here
no one would have cut my hair 
once i heard him call me
from the bottom of a well 
  alfredo 
  let s run away together 
he also called me from
an empty pumpkin   olmo  
alfredo 
and he called me
from a barrel of lambrusco wine 
olmo 
  alfredo 
  olmo 
 speaking dialect 
hey carter  come back 
what a fool to leave a horse
in the middle of the road 
come back at once 
damn you 
i ve not even got the strength
to give an order to a servant 
listen    what lovely music 
young people dance 
hug each other 
and make love before sunset 
there s no place for an old man here 
it s hot  master  isn t it 
  who are you 
  i m irma  the daughter of delina 
i ve always walked barefoot 
and now my feet are swollen 
but they re nice  aren t they 
my mistress gave them to me 
irma  follow me 
come on 
master 
master 
master 
don t worry 
i m not going to hurt you 
take it 
you scared me 
  milk her 
  it s not milking time 
she s swollen  milk her 
cows are full
of milk and shit 
we re all cursed 
curse is inside us 
and it gets worse with age 
do you know what
the worst curse is 
the hail 
the hail isn t a curse 
shit and milk in my head  that s it 
not even war or pellagra are 
one is cursed when
it doesn t get hard anymore 
milk and shit 
it s no use 
it doesn t want to get hard 
put your hand inside 
mr alfredo 
no one can milk a bull 
go back to dance

our master is dead 
yes  our master is dead

  who knows 
take the water away 
let s all get drunk 
fill it up 
but the master
wants us to keep dancing 
he wants
to rule after death too 
let s play 
if you could see yourself  mr  alfredo 
you didn t die like a master 
and why did you untie all the cows 
to make me work harder 
maybe   
maybe the truth is
that when someone has nothing to do
they have too much time to think 
and thinking too much
they become dotards 
at least we knew each other 
i knew you were the one who ruled 
now it s a mess 
who knows how everything will end 
 i  alfredo berlinghieri 
in possession of all my mental faculties
appoint as my sole heir
my youngest son giovanni 
to my firstborn ottavio
  what did he say 
   my firstborn ottavio  
 i leave a life annuity
of 5 000 lire 
which he ll receive
for his lifetime
from my sole heir 
moreover  i leave him

those aren t nests but cocoons 
i ve seen one in a book 
take off those clothes 
they re all wet 
it s so light    butterflies
come out of this hole 
i ve never seen them 
like my little sister  she was born
at night  then she flew away 
  why did she fly away 
  because she died 
when you die you don t fly away 
they just put you in the ground 
doesn t it hurt

  show me yours 
it looks like a worm 
if you pull it  it ll become like mine 
  it doesn t 
  pull harder

  i m a socialist with holes in his pocket 
  a socialist with holes in his pocket 
  never mind  you don t understand anything 
  come on  take this mantle 
  i don t want it 
don t act like a child 
it stopped hailing 
come and see 
  what s that 
  it s the town 
that cannot be  it s too far away 
it s the town  i swear on god 
that s the cathedral  i went there
with uncle ottavio when i was small 
  what tall houses 
  those aren t houses  those are bell towers 
one of them is smoking 
  that s a factory 
  who knows if they can see us too

follow me  everyone 
to cut it short 
we lost everything 
wine  tomatoes  potatoes 
grain  the whole harvest 
therefore we must
all make sacrifices 
don t we  leo 
so  the cat stole your tongue 
tell them how much wheat we lost 
  half as much 
  at least 
therefore it s simple  we
must live with half wage 
but when the harvest is double
we don t get double wage 
to be honest  if i had to
act out of my own interest 
i should send you all home 
especially you labourers 
you re a bunch of ignorants 
you should be grateful to me 
because the only one
who s really losing here is me 
and by the way  who s the master 
who rules here 
you 
we lost everything  didn t you hear me 
and you have big ears too 
 speaking dialect 
let s get inside

we all agree 
we ll go on strike 
strike 
do you know what strike means 
i asked you if you know
what it means 
it means i ll no longer
use these hands to work 
good  he s right 
they won t sow  they
won t harvest the wheat 
they won t milk 
and so no more milk 
everyone stands still 
and in the meantime the land
dies  are you ready for that 
yes  there s the league now 
the league 
what s this league 
did the league tell you
we ll end up eating grass 
and that we ll all get
mean  but really mean 
  did they tell you this 
  yes  the league is great and strong 
you want to know
what the league is 
strike  strike

poor things  they haven t

so  are the maids on strike too 
desolina  today you ll go
to the village to get some milk 
and don t stop talking to anyone 
that s crazy  we have to buy the milk
when the stable s full of cows 
strikes are intolerably arrogant 
they re against civil principles 
those people aren t reasonable 
the old man included 
they ll have to give up 
and cows will explode
and wheat will rot in the fields 
you  eat 
listen 
 negotiations between
the trade union and
the agrarian association
have fallen through 
we ll send lancers
to the sites on strike 
we ll reply to boycotts
boycotting the league  
stop it 
this is the official report 
 we ll reply to the strike with a lock out 
we ll reply to violence with violence 
the whip is necessary against
subverting beastly instincts  
granddad  who are the strike breakers 
they re dogs who go
to work when the strike s on 
why don t they like the strike 
because they re poorer
and more ignorant than us 
granny  listen to the music

anita  anita furlan 
venetian 
  from verona

  anita  how does the tale ends 
  go ahead 
  please 
  alright 
at tention 
  yes sir 
  stand at ease 
dotard  you don t recognise
your friends  it s me  bonehead 
lieutenant  i ll demote you 
war is over 
no one can give us orders now 
now i like you 
really  then kiss me  my hero 
no one took care of your silkworms 
there s only mice in here now 
like in the trenches 
remember when we could see the town
from here but no one believed us 
it seemed so close 
could you see
the war from here too 
master of the house 
may you rest in peace 
go to hell with your father 
your mother  etcetera  amen 
olmo  put it back  that s not ours 
wasn t it half and half 
olmo  when you were away
many things changed 
we ve always been
paid half harvest 
the master had to rent machines
and pay new labourers 
  so what 
  it s been a bad year 
long live our hero 
even half harvest would be a theft 
because we re the ones who work 
you don t even want to go fifty fifty 
wanna know why i had
to hire so many labourers 
because you all went to die at war 
  like idiots 
  dad  you have no right to say that 
shut up and play with
tin soldiers if you wish 
wanna know how much it cost me
to keep you at home 
how much 
  more than what you re worth 
  i wanted to go too  but you stopped me 
sure   
that s a beautiful sword 
indeed it is 
it s sharp too  very sharp 
look  dad 
congratulations  lieutenant 
is that all you can do 
when i was your age i got up
at 4 a m  to check the stables 
you all shouldn t forget that 
i was the first to get up
in threshing times 
and i was the last to go to sleep 
try to deny it 
deny it if you can 
  you re so good  little cousin 
  thanks  i can do better 
   to widen the farm 
these are no longer values 
respectability  devotion
to the church  love for the land 
loyalty to one s family
and faith into the banks 
calm down please 
and respect 
respect  respect  respect 
what the master means is
that there was no one left to work here 
so he had to rent new machines
which he paid grain for 
as he does with you all 
machines which make life easier 
they re a change 
they mean progress 
they re great 
don t you agree 
it s heavy  isn t it 
hey  what are you doing 
stop it 
stop it  the army
didn t teach you anything 
  who s that 
  attila melanchini  my dad s new farmer 
i m a soldier like you 
you heard the master 
he gave you all what he could 
from now on we ll work together 
by the way i understand you 
no  olmo  olmo 
enough 
women  did you hear the master 
it s our men s fault 
because they went to die in war 
it s the labourers  fault too
because they work 
and want to be paid for it 
it s our fault  because we get hungry
and catch pellagra 
and it s also our fault if
2 out of 3 of our kids die 
the master won t be ruined
if we take some more of our grain
and leave the rest to him 
come on  help yourselves 
  you speak too well to be a peasant 
  i m a teacher 
you re the first educated
girlfriend i ve ever had 
excuse me  teacher 
are you done with your lesson 
here comes the rooster 
peck this 
peep peep peep 
enough  stop it 
alright then 
what happened 
where are you going 
to celebrate saint martin
