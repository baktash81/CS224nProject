what exactly is the problem 
take this one as an example 
you call this a straight line 
and why s it folded here 
why is this sticking up 
you didn t even fold it 
a quarter of them look like this 
so 1 out of 4 are rejects 
so you re really docking
10  off our pay 
considering the rejects 
that s a low penalty  isn t it 
our pay is so low already 
how can you do this 
look here 
this is not some minor issue 
you know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image 
brand  you can t even afford
a box folder 
what did you say 
boss 
this is all because
of that guy  right 
what guy 
your part time worker 
he s gone awol  right 
just when the love of god church
made a huge group order 
how do you know all that 
who told you 
my sister knows the guy 
he s always been a bit strange 
got a bad reputation 
speaking of which  boss 
we ll accept a 10  penalty 
in return   
in return 
any thought of hiring
a new part time worker 
sis  we need someone 
ditch the guy you ve got now 
just fire him 
tomorrow i ll come for
a formal interview  what time 
wait  hold on a sec 
let me think about it 
then for now 
just pay for the boxes 
so we re all gathered here today 
to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones 
and this bounteous wi fi 
look at that bastard 
it s not even dark yet 
why didn t you put up
a  no urinating  sign 
i told you 
no  signs like that
just make them piss even more 
at least shout at him 
don t shout 
 please don t piss  
hey  is that min 
hey mister  that s not a toilet 
way to go  min 
hey  punk 
who are you staring at  asshole 
come here  you little shit 
get a fucking grip 
that s an impressive friend 
college students have
a real vigor to them 
not like my brother 
but is he coming here 
did you invite him 
no 
hello 
oh hi  min 
min 
are you well  sir 
  sure 
  what are you doing here 
i texted you  didn t you see it 
sorry  were you eating 
no  we weren t eating 
  how are you  ki jung 
  fine  you too 
we could ve met outside 
why come here 
because of this 
it s for you 
but it s so heavy 
really  put it down here 
wow  what is that 
when i said i was meeting ki woo 
my grandfather insisted
i bring this to you 
is this a landscape type 
or you can see it
as an abstract type 
wow  you know these 
my grandpa has collected scholar s rocks
since his cadet days 
now the annex  the study 
every room in the house
is filled with these things 
but this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families   
min 
this is so metaphorical 
for sure 
it s a very opportune gift 
of course 
please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa 
food would be better 
what was that called 
a landscape stone 
you collect those rocks too 
hey  thanks to that rock
i saw your parents  they look healthy 
they re plenty healthy 
just out of work 
is ki jung taking lessons
these days 
she can t afford lessons 
cute  huh 
she s the one you re tutoring 
park da hye 
high school sophomore 
you take over
as her english tutor 
what do you mean 
tutor a rich kid 
it pays well 
she s a nice girl 
look after her while
i m studying abroad 
what about your university friends 
why ask a loser like me 
why do you think 
just the thought makes me sick 
those disgusting frat boys
slavering over da hye 
it s revolting 
you like her 
hey  i m serious 
when she enters university 
i ll officially ask her out 
so you take care of
her until then 
if it s you 
i can leave in peace 
thanks for your trust 
but do i have to pretend to be
a college student 
ki woo  think about it 
for years including
your military service 
you took the university entrance
exam 4 times 
grammar  vocabulary 
composition  conversation   
when it comes to english 
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks 
  i guess so 
  sure 
but will they hire me 
i m not a college student 
just fake it 
don t worry  you ll have
my recommendation  plus   
how should i describe the mother    
she s a bit simple 
young and simple 
simple 
what do you mean 
anyway  it s all good 
i had fun there 
so you agree 
i guess so 
hey  you said
your sister is artistic 
good at photoshop 
god  with skills like this 
why can t you get into art school 
shut up 
hey  no smoking in here 
yeah  yeah  gimme that 
yeah 
now the cherry on top   
wow  does oxford have
a major in document forgery 
ki jung would be top of her class 
she s amazing  huh 
our boy s going for a job interview 
wish him luck 
son 
i m proud of you 
dad 
i don t think of this
as forgery or crime 
i ll go to this university
next year 
so you ve got a plan 
i just printed out the document
a bit early 
who is it 
madame  good afternoon 
i m here on min s recommendation   
oh right  come in 
thank you 
hello 
hello  madame 
i just work here 
come this way 
the yard is so nice 
the inside s nice too 
you know the architect namgoong 
he s famous 
he used to live in this house 
he designed it himself 
as you can see 
now it s a playpen 
this way 
sit yourself down here 
i ll bring the madame 
yes 
madame 
madame 
madame 
madame 
he s here 
the tutoring candidate 
i don t care about documents 
min recommended you  after all 
as you know  min is such
a brilliant human being 
da hye and i were quite happy
with him 
regardless of her grades 
know what i mean 
yes 
he was marvelous 
so to be honest  we wanted to stick
with him through high school 
but all of a sudden
he s going abroad 
anyway  excuse me 
but if i can speak directly 
if you re not up
to min s level  then 
i m not sure
what the point is 
so anyway 
what i want to say is 
for your first lesson today 
do you mind if i sit in 
i want to see it full time 
how you run your lesson 
is it okay with you 
you sure about  24 
da hye  you solved those later problems
then went back to  24 
right 
yes 
if that were the first question
on a real exam  you d be screwed 
look at this 
your pulse is racing 
the heart doesn t lie 
an exam is like slashing through
a jungle 
lose that momentum
and you re finished 
the answer to  24 
i don t care 
slashing through the exam 
dominating it 
that s all i care about 
what you need is vigor 
vigor 
understand 
so i ll pay you
this time each month 
3 classes a week 
2 hours each  okay 
as for the fee 
i was going to pay min s rate 
then i added a bit for inflation 
thank you 
how about a proper introduction 
da hye s tutor 
we ll call him kevin 
mr  kevin 
if you feel like snacking
during your lesson  just call me 
if you need anything  ask her 
she knows this house better than i   
da song  stop it 
i m sorry  did he startle you 
how cute  his name s da song 
yes  our youngest 
da song  come say hi 
this is mr  kevin 
this is an indian arrow 
i ordered it from the u s 
from last year he s been
an indian fanatic 
indians 
he s got a fanboy personality 
well  he s eccentric
and easily distracted 
he can barely sit still 
so last year i enrolled him
in cub scouts 
hoping he d learn moderation
and focus 
but look 
he s even worse 
his scout leader is an indian fanatic 
maybe that s why 
the american indian is
the very spirit of the cub scouts 
it s a good thing 
were you a cub scout  kevin 
sure  i m a scout by nature 
da song is an artist by nature 
look at this painting 
it s so metaphorical 
it s really strong 
strong  right 
you ve got an eye for this 
it s a chimpanzee  right 
a self portrait 
sure enough 
the perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding 
or perhaps it s da song s
expressive genius   
anyway  we ve been through
so many art teachers 
none of them lasts even a month 
and da song is just so hard
to control 
  just a moment  madame 
  yes 
someone just came to mind 
what was her name 
jessica  right  jessica   
she was in the same art school
as my cousin 
what was her korean name 
anyway  after studying applied arts
at illinois state university 
she returned to korea 
illinois    tell me more 
her teaching is unusual 
but she knows how to handle kids 
she s got a special reputation
in her field 
but even though
her methods are unique 
she can help kids get
into good art schools 
now i m really curious 
what is she like 
would you like to meet her 
though i heard she s
in high demand   
hold on 
jessica  only child 
illinois chicago 
classmate kim jin mo 
he s your cousin 
look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth
in this mosaic arrangement 
but within that too 
there are repeating patterns 
gochujang is red  the rice   
well  anyway 
he has a basquiat esque sense 
even at age 9 
how exciting 
i m sure miss jessica
must have already sensed this 
so i ll leave you two 
and go up for da hye s lesson 
have a nice lesson  jessica 
yes  thank you for the introduction 
so as you can see 
da song s eccentric genius   
da hye 
so we ll start with  38 
kevin 
yeah 
did you know that da song is
faking it all 
huh  what do you mean 
it s all a show 
acting like a genius 
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake 
an artist cosplay 
da song 
you know that thing 
when he freezes and stares at the sky 
as if struck by inspiration 
so he s walking along  then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes 
so you know what i mean 
he gives me the creeps 
he pretends that he can t live
a normal life 
makes me want to puke 
so da song is pretending   
but what s that got to do
with your studies 
well  i m just saying 
sure  so in that sense 
what you told me
about da song was very interesting 
so let s write about it
in english 
and be sure to use the word  pretend 
at least twice 
then  can i ask you a question 
sure 
that teacher jessica 
is she really your cousin s classmate 
what do you mean 
she s your girlfriend  right 
no way    i just met her today 
jessica s really pretty 
isn t she 
aren t you interested 
you saw her 
sure  she s pretty 
she s a beautiful woman 
yeah 
i knew it 
so you are interested 
da hye   
so  if we can compare jessica
to a rose 
then you are   
  let s study 
  yes 
please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still 
i understand 
da song 
da song  get up 
come on  da song 
in your butt   
  madame  please leave us 
  what 
i never teach with a parent
in the room 
but today is our first day 
and as you can see  he s   
wait downstairs 
park da song 
da song 
madame 
want some plum extract 
what 
it s mixed with honey 
to ease your tension 
yeah  that would be great 
  hey 
  yes 
i ve got an idea 
take two glasses of plum
extract to da song s room 
you re not a parent 
so you can go in 
oh  that s right 
then i ll report back on
what s going on in there   
why didn t i think of it earlier 
what 
they came out 
yeah 
so you re done already 
madame 
come sit next to me 
da song  go upstairs 
hurry up 
da song just painted this 
i see   
i d rather speak with madame alone 
oh  but she is   
no  leave us 
madame 
i told you i study art psychology
and art therapy 
yes 
did anything happen to da song
in first grade 
to be frank 
before i decide whether
to take on da song 
i need to hear about this 
but this is hard for me
to talk about right now 
what to do 
never mind  then 
the lower right region of a painting is
called the  schizophrenia zone  
psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here 
oh  phrenia   
look here 
da song painted this unusual shape 
right 
i see 
over there  it s the same 
it s the same  right 
yes  that s correct 
a similar shape in the same zone 
you see it now 
yes 
i ve stared at that painting
at every meal 
but i had no idea 
calm down 
let s compose ourselves 
this is all a black box
into da song s mind 
would you like to
open that box with me  madame 
i want to open it 
then we ll need 4 two hour sessions
per week 
and this is not simple tutoring 
it s art therapy  right 
of course 
because of that my rate is
set at a very high level 
are you okay with that 
it s my pleasure 
da song s dad is home 
honey  da song s new art teacher
is here 
her name s jessica 
from illinois 
jessica  this is dong ik 
  hello 
  hi 
thanks for your help 
class is over 
yes  just finished 
  driver yoon 
  yes 
  are you free 
  yes  i am 
then give her a lift  okay 
sure  we don t want her
going down alone at night  right 
of course 
miss jessica 
shall i drive you
all the way home  then 
  which neighborhood 
  no  that s fine 
you can just drop me off
at hyehwa station 
thank you 
i don t mind if it s far away 
  my shift is finished  anyway 
  i ll get off at hyehwa 
looks like it s going to rain 
ride the benz  not the subway 
i m meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of hyehwa station 
yes 
dad  when you worked as a driver 
did you drive a lot of benzes 
benzes 
not then  but i did
when i worked as a valet 
you worked as a valet 
sure  after the chicken place went bust 
before the taiwan cake shop 
in that 6 month window 
no  it was after the cake shop
went bust 
we re moving
to the next stage already 
i set a trap in the benz 
then we re diving right in 
wow  this is so metaphorical 
look dad  we re eating in
a driver s cafeteria right now 
right  a driver s cafeteria 
eat as much as you want  kids 
you didn t even pay for it 
they did 
son  have some more 
eat up 
yes  dad 
eat your fill 
what did you do
to that woman yesterday 
what 
she was freaking out 
saying she was so moved 
you put her in shock 
fuck  i don t know 
i googled  art therapy  
and ad libbed the rest 
then suddenly she s weeping 
crazy bitch 
i couldn t believe it 
oh  you re home 
did you eat yet 
is something wrong 
is the housekeeper out 
she s walking the dogs 
honey 
this was under my car seat 
driver yoon is such a scumbag 
what is this 
i m sorry  honey 
i didn t know
he was this kind of guy 
don t you pay him well 
is he saving up by not paying
for a motel 
he must be a pervert 
he likes it in the car 
oh  that s gross 
in his boss  car 
a young guy s sex life is
his own business  that s all fine 
but why in my car 
and if so  why not in his seat 
why cross the line like that 
you re right 
does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on 
i can t believe this 
but you know
what s strangest of all 
what 
usually if you have car sex 
you might leave behind
a strand of hair  or an earring 
right 
but how can you forget
your own panties 
that s right 
it s hard to overlook 
so it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman s condition 
you get me 
oh my    meth or cocaine 
shh  the kids   
what do we do 
what if anyone finds white powder
in your car 
calm down  relax 
relax
for now it s just supposition 
a rational guess 
but no need to call the police 
not that 
still  for a busy man like me to ask 
 why are you fucking in my car  
exactly 
so instead   
can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go 
okay sure 
no need to mention panties
or car sex 
we don t need to stoop
to that level  do we 
surely not 
but what if he goes online
and accuses us   
just give him a good severance 
how was da song today 
he was fine 
  so class is finished 
  yes 
jessica  the last time you came 
our driver gave you a ride 
right 
that s right 
this may be an odd question 
but nothing happened then 
no  he was very nice 
i told him
to go to hyehwa station 
but he insisted
on driving me home 
that jerk 
he took you home late at night 
revealing where you live 
no  i got off at hyehwa 
oh  good girl  very good 
jessica nice   
did something happen with him 
he won t be working for us anymore 
a slightly shameful incident 
what incident 
oh  you don t need to know 
but i m surprised 
he was so gentlemanly and cool 
jessica  you re too young
and innocent 
you have a lot to learn
about people 
but we were excited to have such
a young  hip driver  too 
but isn t an older driver better 
that s true  they drive better 
have better manners 
my father s brother had
a driver just like that 
mr  kim 
he was so congenial and nice 
i used to call him uncle
when i was young 
you know a man like that 
yes  he was so mild mannered 
oh  but my relatives relocated
to chicago 
i wonder if mr 
kim s free now 
i m really interested 
could i meet him 
really 
i don t trust anyone now 
i only trust someone recommended
by a person i know well 
but if you ve known him so long 
i d feel much more at ease 
do you really want to meet him 
i m deadly serious 
this chain of recommendations
is best 
how should i describe it 
a belt of trust 
  this one s different 
  here 
oh  right 
and this one 
looks like a touch screen now 
it s not touch 
it says you have to turn it 
wow  this thing 
sir 
taking our time  are we 
this is a nice car 
this is it 
come over here 
he s in a meeting now 
have a seat and wait here 
hello  nice to meet   
but is it compatible
with a phone 
oh  not with a phone 
you need more computing power 
this isn t any sort of test 
so don t be nervous 
i was worn out at the office 
so i came out for a bit 
i understand 
constant chatter  all that bother 
at least the car is peaceful 
thank you 
you seem to know the roads well 
anything below the 38th parallel 
after 30 years behind the wheel 
the car almost drives itself 
i respect those who work
in one field for a long time 
well  to be honest 
this is a simple vocation 
but    the head of a household 
the leader of a company 
or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning   
it s companionship of a sort 
so that s how i ve approached each day 
the years sure pass quickly 
sure enough 
your cornering is excellent 
well  it may look simple 
but it s one of the fundamentals 
she may look like a sheep 
but inside  she s a fox 
sometimes she acts like
she owns the house 
right 
of all the people in that house 
she s lived there the longest 
she was housekeeper
to the architect namgoong 
but then she went on to work
for this family 
when the architect moved out 
he introduced this woman
to park s family 
telling them   this is a great housekeeper 
you should hire her  
so she survived
a change of ownership 
she won t give up
a good job easily 
to extract a woman like that 
we need to prepare well 
right  we need a plan 
i want to eat peaches 
i like peaches best 
why not ask for some 
no peaches at our house 
it s forbidden fruit 
so according to
what da hye told me 
she s got a massively serious
allergy to peaches 
you know that fuzz
on a peach s skin 
if she s anywhere near it 
she gets a full body rash 
has trouble breathing  asthma 
a total meltdown 
no no  there weren t
any peaches anywhere 
that s what i m saying 
usually when i get symptoms
like this 
i run to my room
and take my medicine 
but it was so sudden 
i wasn t sure where i left it 
madame  this woman behind me 
is that    
oh  it s our housekeeper 
so it s true  oh  how sad 
i wasn t sure
if that was really her 
i ve only seen her a couple times
in the living room 
this was in the hospital 
a few days ago i went
for my annual medical exam 
i took a selfie for my wife 
and there she was behind me 
is she talking
on the phone there 
anyway  i wasn t trying
to eavesdrop   
i wasn t trying
to eavesdrop 
but her words
came through clearly 
  so i couldn t help but    
  cut  cut 
dad  your emotions are up
to here 
bring them down to
about there 
   so i couldn t help
but overhear 
keep it focused 
what i m trying to say is 
it s just that 
your housekeeper s voice
is quite loud  you know 
i understand  it s all right 
just tell me  okay 
she said she got diagnosed
with active tb 
and she was shouting
on the phone 
so upset she could
barely control herself 
tuberculosis 
come on   
it s true  she phoned someone
saying she had active tb 
do people still get tb 
dad   
back in the day  people used
to buy christmas seals  right 
feels like a bygone era 
but i saw it on the internet 
korea has the  1 rate of tb
of all the oecd countries 
but she s still working 
as if nothing s wrong 
with a kid like da song
in the house 
so you ve got a young kid
like da song in the house 
and a tb patient is doing dishes 
cooking  spraying spittle   
stop it  please 
dad  arriving in 3 mins
if you get the chance 
this ll be icing on the cake 
madame
2nd floor sauna room
don t let her see you
  have a seat 
  yes 
mr  kim 
please don t tell any of this
to my husband  okay 
understood 
if he hears i brought
a tb patient to our home 
i ll be hanged and quartered 
don t worry  madame 
and if i may presume
to say one thing 
i have no feelings
against that woman 
i felt i had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene 
but this could be
seen as snitching or   
don t you worry 
i won t mention the tb 
i ll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her 
simply and quietly 
it s a proven method 
that s the best 
okay  then 
have you    washed your hands 
mr  kim  do you know
a good braised ribs place 
somewhere close by 
sure 
  then you ll be eating out 
  that s right 
why such a craving
for braised ribs today 
our old housekeeper made delicious ribs 
the one who quit this week 
my wife wouldn t even tell me
why she quit 
sure  it s easy enough
to hire a new one 
still  it s a shame 
she was a great housekeeper 
i see 
she kept the house
in great shape 
and she knew never
to cross the line 
i can t stand people
who cross the line 
perhaps just one weak point 
eating too much 
she always ate enough for two 
but considering all the work
she did   
then you better find someone new 
a new housekeeper 
we re in trouble now 
in a week  our house will be
a trash can 
my clothes will start
to smell 
my wife has no talent for housework 
she s bad at cleaning 
and her cooking s awful 
still  you love her  right 
of course  i love her 
we ll call it love 
then would this help 
the care 
what is this 
i just recently found out
about them 
how to describe it 
it s like a membership service 
the company provides veteran grade
help to vip customers such as you 
for example maids  caregivers 
or drivers like myself 
you can tell from the card
they re high class 
cool design 
then how do you know
about this company 
they contacted me 
as a veteran grade driver 
you might say they scouted me 
but when their call came i had
already arranged to meet with you 
i see   
you turned down this famous company
to work for me 
i won t forget that 
son of a bitch 
anyway  i can give this card
to my wife  right 
yes  that s why i brought it up 
no need to mention me 
you can tell her
you found the company yourself 
sure 
thanks to you i can play
the good husband 
on the back  there s a number
for consultations

worrying about things like this

in an age like ours 
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates 
our entire family got hired 
that s right  dad 
if we put our 4 salaries together 
the amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense 
let s offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great mr  park 
and to min

she got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year

she s rich  but still nice 
not  rich  but still nice  
 nice because she s rich  
you know

i d be nice too 
even nicer 
that s true 
your mom s right 
rich people are naive

no creases on them 
it all gets ironed out 
money is an iron 
those creases all get smoothed out 
hey  ki woo

she s a nice woman  she let me in 
there was an iron plate 
for grilling meat 
it was wedged under the shelf 
so that s why 
i couldn t open it
from the inside 
  what s going on here 
  i know you must be startled 
i would be too in this situation 
but as two fellow workers   
right  chung sook 
how do you know my name 
to be honest i m still texting
with the boy da song 
i knew they were going camping 
so i came today 
i wanted to speak to you alone

nobody knows i came 
isn t that good  sis

sis  my name is moon gwang 
this is my hubbie oh geun sae 
say hello  honey 
this tastes great 
what happened to your face 
i ll tell you later 
so you d steal food every day
while working in the kitchen 
feeding your husband 
not at all  i bought all his food
with my salary 
that s so unfair 
but how long has
your husband been down here 
hold on a sec 
4 years 
4 years  3 months and 17 days 
right  it s june now 
four years ago
when mr  namgoong moved to paris 
in the time before mr  park s family
moved in 
i brought my husband down here 
many rich houses have secret bunkers 
where you can hide
in case north korea attacks 
or if creditors break in 
but it seems mr  namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this 
because he never mentioned it
to mr  park s family 
so only i know about it 
so that s how it happened 
but now that i know  i ve no choice
but to call the police 
no please  sis 
as fellow members of the needy 
please don t 
i m not needy 
but we re needy 
we ve no house  no money 
only debts 
sis  please 
even after 4 years of hiding 
those debt collectors won t give up 
they re still searching for him 
threatening to stab him 
you used loan sharks 
it s all my fault 
the taiwan cake shop 
my taiwanese wangshui
castella shop went bust 
i was overwhelmed by debt 
please take this 
what s that 
it s not much 
just a modest sum 
but we ll send it
to you every month 
in return 
just once every 2 days 
please leave him some food 
no no  just once a week 
there s a refrigerator here 
just once a week 
you ve got some nerve 
i m calling the police 
sis 
who is that 
wait    jessica 
mr  kim 
what the hell 
dad  my ankle

let s go up  honey 
time for you to get some fresh air 
honey  this  send  button is
like a missile launcher 
what do you mean  honey 
if we threaten to push it 
those people can t do anything 
it s like a north korean rocket 
a north korean missile button 
today our beloved
great leader kim jong un 
after witnessing
the charlatan family video 
was unable to contain
his shock and fury
at their wicked 
despicable provocation 
i ve missed your jokes  honey 
therefore our great leader 
in this age of denuclearization 
has commanded that the nation s
last remaining nuclear warhead
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family 
no one can imitate north korean
news anchors like you 
with their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard 
our dear leader s wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can   
hands in the air  fuckers

late that night 
when everyone was sleeping 
da song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out 
the whipped cream
on that cake was amazing 
even in bed  he couldn t stop
thinking about it 
so da song was sitting 
eating his cake   
he screamed 
and i ran downstairs 
and he was all   
his eyes rolled back in his head 
convulsions  foam in his mouth 
have you ever seen
a child have a seizure

what is it 
like an old radish

you know when you boil a rag 
it smells like that 
anyway  even though he always seems
about to cross the line 
he never does cross it 
that s good 
  i ll give him credit 
  yeah 
but that smell crosses the line 
it powers through right
into the back seat 
how bad can it be 
i don t know 
it s hard to describe 
but you sometimes smell it
on the subway 
it s been ages
since i rode a subway 
people who ride the subway

life never works out that way 
look around us

 let s all spend the night in a gym  
but look now 
everyone s sleeping on the floor

that s why people shouldn t make plans 
with no plan 
nothing can go wrong 
and if something spins out of control 
it doesn t matter 
whether you kill someone 
or betray your country 
none of it fucking matters 
got it 
dad 
i m sorry 
for what

stop pushing  dad

car keys 
the car keys 
throw them

are you okay 
don t touch it 
hello  mr  park 
you know me 
respect 
opening my eyes for the first time
in a month 
i saw a detective 
you have the right to
an attorney   
who looked nothing like
a detective 
is he laughing 
just a sec 
then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke 
that happens sometimes
after brain surgery 
they keep laughing 
for no reason 
do you hear me 
can you hear me 
then do i have to do it again 
do what 
the miranda thing 
you have the right to remain silent 
anything you say can and
will be used against you   
he keeps laughing  look 
even when i heard
how much ki jung bled that day   
even when i heard the words forgery 
trespassing  foul play  self defense
and we were lucky
to get away with a probation   
even when i finally
got to see ki jung s face   
kim ki jung  rip
i kept laughing 
still  when i went back
and watched the news reports 
i didn t laugh 
this sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upper class home
is a highly unusual case 
since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene 
police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive 
the driver kim and the slain mr  park
are said to have been on good terms 
for now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver kim 
kim  after exiting this door
and descending the stairs 
disappeared into the neighboring alleys 
police searched the cctvs
of nearby homes to no avail 
and they have yet
to find any witnesses 
given the situation 
it s not an exaggeration to say that
kim vanished into thin air 
actually mom and i had no idea
where dad was 
but those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us 
eventually the news went quiet 
and after the tails stopped 
i started going up that mountain 
from up there 
you get a great view of the house 
that day  despite the cold 
i felt like staying longer 
dash dash dot dot
son 
son 
perhaps you  if no one else 
will be able to read this letter 
you were a boy scout 
so i m writing this just
in case 
have your injuries healed 
i m sure your mom is
plenty healthy 
i m doing fine in here 
though thinking of
ki jung makes me cry 
even now  what happened that day
doesn t seem real 
it feels like a dream 
and yet it doesn t 
that day as i went out the gate 
i suddenly knew 
where i needed to go   
a house where such
a grisly crime took place
would surely not be easy
to sell 
i m sorry  mr  park 
i struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house 
still  thanks to the house
being empty 
what was her name 
moon gwang 
i was able to give her
a proper send off 
i hear tree side burials are trendy 
so hell  i did my best 
but those real estate
sharks sure are clever 
they hoodwinked some people
who hadjust arrived in korea
and managed to sell the house 
with the parents working 
and the kids attending school 
the family is usually out 
but the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day 
each time i go upstairs 
i take my life in my hands 
it turns out germans eat
more than just sausage and beer 
what a relief 
passing the time down here 
everything starts to go hazy 
today at least i was able
to write you a letter 
if i send out the letter
this way every night 
maybe someday you ll see it 
so long 
you re home  ki woo 
yeah 
dad  today i made a plan 
a fundamental plan 
i m going to earn money 
a lot of it 
university  a career  marriage 
those are all fine 
but first i ll earn money 
you ll see once you go in 
but it s very spacious 
actually  we don t show this house
to just anyone 
when i have money 
i ll buy that house 
on the day we move in 
mom and i will be in the yard 
because the sunshine is
