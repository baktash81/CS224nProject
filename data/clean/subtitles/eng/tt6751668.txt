what exactly is the problem
take this one as an example
you call this a straight line
and whys it folded here
why is this sticking up
you didnt even fold it
a quarter of them look like this
so 1 out of 4 are rejects
so youre really docking
10 off our pay
considering the rejects
thats a low penalty isnt it
our pay is so low already
how can you do this
look here
this is not some minor issue
you know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image
brand you cant even afford
a box folder
what did you say
boss
this is all because
of that guy right
what guy
your parttime worker
hes gone awol right
just when the love of god church
made a huge group order
how do you know all that
who told you
my sister knows the guy
hes always been a bit strange
got a bad reputation
speaking of which boss
well accept a 10 penalty
in return
in return
any thought of hiring
a new parttime worker
sis we need someone
ditch the guy youve got now
just fire him
tomorrow ill come for
a formal interview what time
wait hold on a sec
let me think about it
then for now
just pay for the boxes
so were all gathered here today
to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones
and this bounteous wifi
look at that bastard
its not even dark yet
why didnt you put up
a no urinating sign
i told you
no signs like that
just make them piss even more
at least shout at him
dont shout
please dont piss
hey is that min
hey mister thats not a toilet
way to go min
hey punk

college students have
a real vigor to them
not like my brother
but is he coming here

what are you doing here
i texted you didnt you see it
sorry were you eating
no we werent eating
how are you kijung

we couldve met outside
why come here
because of this
its for you
but its so heavy
really put it down here
wow what is that
when i said i was meeting kiwoo
my grandfather insisted
i bring this to you
is this a landscape type
or you can see it
as an abstract type
wow you know these
my grandpa has collected scholars rocks
since his cadet days
now the annex the study
every room in the house
is filled with these things
but this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families
min
this is so metaphorical
for sure
its a very opportune gift
of course
please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa
food would be better
what was that called
a landscape stone
you collect those rocks too
hey thanks to that rock
i saw your parents they look healthy
theyre plenty healthy
just out of work
is kijung taking lessons
these days
she cant afford lessons
cute huh
shes the one youre tutoring
park dahye
high school sophomore
you take over
as her english tutor
what do you mean
tutor a rich kid
it pays well
shes a nice girl
look after her while
im studying abroad
what about your university friends
why ask a loser like me
why do you think
just the thought makes me sick
those disgusting frat boys
slavering over dahye
its revolting
you like her
hey im serious
when she enters university
ill officially ask her out
so you take care of
her until then
if its you
i can leave in peace
thanks for your trust
but do i have to pretend to be
a college student
kiwoo think about it
for years including
your military service
you took the university entrance
exam 4 times
grammar vocabulary
composition conversation
when it comes to english
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks
i guess so
sure
but will they hire me
im not a college student
just fake it
dont worry youll have
my recommendation plus
how should i describe the mother
shes a bit simple
young and simple
simple
what do you mean
anyway its all good
i had fun there
so you agree
i guess so
hey you said
your sister is artistic
good at photoshop
god with skills like this
why cant you get into art school
shut up
hey no smoking in here
yeah yeah gimme that
yeah
now the cherry on top
wow does oxford have
a major in document forgery
kijung would be top of her class
shes amazing huh
our boys going for a job interview
wish him luck
son
im proud of you
dad
i dont think of this
as forgery or crime
ill go to this university
next year
so youve got a plan
i just printed out the document
a bit early
who is it
madame good afternoon
im here on mins recommendation
oh right come in
thank you
hello
hello madame
i just work here
come this way
the yard is so nice
the insides nice too
you know the architect namgoong
hes famous
he used to live in this house
he designed it himself
as you can see
now its a playpen
this way
sit yourself down here
ill bring the madame
yes
madame
madame
madame
madame
hes here
the tutoring candidate
i dont care about documents
min recommended you after all
as you know min is such
a brilliant human being
dahye and i were quite happy
with him
regardless of her grades
know what i mean
yes
he was marvelous
so to be honest we wanted to stick
with him through high school
but all of a sudden
hes going abroad
anyway excuse me
but if i can speak directly
if youre not up
to mins level then
im not sure
what the point is
so anyway
what i want to say is
for your first lesson today
do you mind if i sit in
i want to see it full time
how you run your lesson
is it okay with you
you sure about 24
dahye you solved those later problems
then went back to 24
right
yes
if that were the first question
on a real exam youd be screwed
look at this
your pulse is racing
the heart doesnt lie
an exam is like slashing through
a jungle
lose that momentum
and youre finished
the answer to 24
i dont care
slashing through the exam
dominating it
thats all i care about
what you need is vigor
vigor
understand
so ill pay you
this time each month
3 classes a week
2 hours each okay
as for the fee
i was going to pay mins rate
then i added a bit for inflation
thank you
how about a proper introduction
dahyes tutor
well call him kevin
mr kevin
if you feel like snacking
during your lesson just call me
if you need anything ask her
she knows this house better than i
dasong stop it
im sorry did he startle you
how cute his names dasong
yes our youngest
dasong come say hi
this is mr kevin
this is an indian arrow
i ordered it from the us
from last year hes been
an indian fanatic
indians
hes got a fanboy personality
well hes eccentric
and easily distracted
he can barely sit still
so last year i enrolled him
in cub scouts
hoping hed learn moderation
and focus
but look
hes even worse
his scout leader is an indian fanatic
maybe thats why
the american indian is
the very spirit of the cub scouts
its a good thing
were you a cub scout kevin
sure im a scout by nature
dasong is an artist by nature
look at this painting
its so metaphorical
its really strong
strong right
youve got an eye for this
its a chimpanzee right
a selfportrait
sure enough
the perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding
or perhaps its dasongs
expressive genius
anyway weve been through
so many art teachers
none of them lasts even a month
and dasong is just so hard
to control
just a moment madame
yes
someone just came to mind
what was her name
jessica right jessica
she was in the same art school
as my cousin
what was her korean name
anyway after studying applied arts
at illinois state university
she returned to korea
illinois tell me more
her teaching is unusual
but she knows how to handle kids
shes got a special reputation
in her field
but even though
her methods are unique
she can help kids get
into good art schools
now im really curious
what is she like
would you like to meet her
though i heard shes
in high demand
hold on
jessica only child
illinois chicago
classmate kim jinmo
hes your cousin
look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth
in this mosaic arrangement
but within that too
there are repeating patterns
gochujang is red the rice
well anyway
he has a basquiatesque sense
even at age 9
how exciting
im sure miss jessica
must have already sensed this
so ill leave you two
and go up for dahyes lesson
have a nice lesson jessica
yes thank you for the introduction
so as you can see
dasongs eccentric genius
dahye
so well start with 38
kevin
yeah
did you know that dasong is
faking it all
huh what do you mean
its all a show
acting like a genius
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake
an artist cosplay
dasong
you know that thing
when he freezes and stares at the sky
as if struck by inspiration
so hes walking along then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes
so you know what i mean
he gives me the creeps
he pretends that he cant live
a normal life
makes me want to puke
so dasong is pretending
but whats that got to do
with your studies
well im just saying
sure so in that sense
what you told me
about dasong was very interesting
so lets write about it
in english
and be sure to use the word pretend
at least twice
then can i ask you a question
sure
that teacher jessica
is she really your cousins classmate
what do you mean
shes your girlfriend right
no way i just met her today
jessicas really pretty
isnt she
arent you interested
you saw her
sure shes pretty
shes a beautiful woman
yeah
i knew it
so you are interested
dahye
so if we can compare jessica
to a rose
then you are
lets study
yes
please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still
i understand
dasong
dasong get up
come on dasong
in your butt
madame please leave us
what
i never teach with a parent
in the room
but today is our first day
and as you can see hes
wait downstairs
park dasong
dasong
madame
want some plum extract
what
its mixed with honey
to ease your tension
yeah that would be great
hey
yes
ive got an idea
take two glasses of plum
extract to dasongs room
youre not a parent
so you can go in
oh thats right
then ill report back on
whats going on in there
why didnt i think of it earlier
what
they came out
yeah
so youre done already
madame
come sit next to me
dasong go upstairs
hurry up
dasong just painted this
i see
id rather speak with madame alone
oh but she is
no leave us
madame
i told you i study art psychology
and art therapy
yes
did anything happen to dasong
in first grade
to be frank
before i decide whether
to take on dasong
i need to hear about this
but this is hard for me
to talk about right now
what to do
never mind then
the lowerright region of a painting is
called the schizophrenia zone
psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here
oh phrenia
look here
dasong painted this unusual shape
right
i see
over there its the same
its the same right
yes thats correct
a similar shape in the same zone
you see it now
yes
ive stared at that painting
at every meal
but i had no idea
calm down
lets compose ourselves
this is all a black box
into dasongs mind
would you like to
open that box with me madame
i want to open it
then well need 4 twohour sessions
per week
and this is not simple tutoring
its art therapy right
of course
because of that my rate is
set at a very high level
are you okay with that
its my pleasure
dasongs dad is home
honey dasongs new art teacher
is here
her names jessica
from illinois
jessica this is dongik
hello
hi
thanks for your help
class is over
yes just finished
driver yoon
yes
are you free
yes i am
then give her a lift okay
sure we dont want her
going down alone at night right
of course
miss jessica
shall i drive you
all the way home then
which neighborhood
no thats fine
you can just drop me off
at hyehwa station
thank you
i dont mind if its far away
my shift is finished anyway
ill get off at hyehwa
looks like its going to rain
ride the benz not the subway
im meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of hyehwa station
yes
dad when you worked as a driver
did you drive a lot of benzes
benzes
not then but i did
when i worked as a valet
you worked as a valet
sure after the chicken place went bust
before the taiwan cake shop
in that 6month window
no it was after the cake shop
went bust
were moving
to the next stage already
i set a trap in the benz
then were diving right in
wow this is so metaphorical
look dad were eating in
a drivers cafeteria right now
right a drivers cafeteria
eat as much as you want kids
you didnt even pay for it
they did
son have some more
eat up
yes dad
eat your fill
what did you do
to that woman yesterday
what
she was freaking out
saying she was so moved
you put her in shock
fuck i dont know
i googled art therapy
and adlibbed the rest
then suddenly shes weeping
crazy bitch
i couldnt believe it
oh youre home
did you eat yet
is something wrong
is the housekeeper out
shes walking the dogs
honey
this was under my car seat
driver yoon is such a scumbag
what is this
im sorry honey
i didnt know
he was this kind of guy
dont you pay him well
is he saving up by not paying
for a motel
he must be a pervert
he likes it in the car
oh thats gross
in his boss car
a young guys sex life is
his own business thats all fine
but why in my car
and if so why not in his seat
why cross the line like that
youre right
does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on
i cant believe this
but you know
whats strangest of all
what
usually if you have car sex
you might leave behind
a strand of hair or an earring
right
but how can you forget
your own panties
thats right
its hard to overlook
so it makes me quite suspicious
of this womans condition
you get me
oh my meth or cocaine
shh the kids
what do we do
what if anyone finds white powder
in your car
calm down relax
relax
for now its just supposition
a rational guess
but no need to call the police
not that
still for a busy man like me to ask
why are you fucking in my car
exactly
so instead
can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go
okay sure
no need to mention panties
or car sex
we dont need to stoop
to that level do we
surely not
but what if he goes online
and accuses us
just give him a good severance
how was dasong today
he was fine
so class is finished
yes
jessica the last time you came
our driver gave you a ride
right
thats right
this may be an odd question
but nothing happened then
no he was very nice
i told him
to go to hyehwa station
but he insisted
on driving me home
that jerk
he took you home late at night
revealing where you live
no i got off at hyehwa
oh good girl very good
jessica nice
did something happen with him
he wont be working for us anymore
a slightly shameful incident
what incident
oh you dont need to know
but im surprised
he was so gentlemanly and cool
jessica youre too young
and innocent
you have a lot to learn
about people
but we were excited to have such
a young hip driver too
but isnt an older driver better
thats true they drive better
have better manners
my fathers brother had
a driver just like that
mr kim
he was so congenial and nice
i used to call him uncle
when i was young
you know a man like that
yes he was so mildmannered
oh but my relatives relocated
to chicago
i wonder if mr
kims free now
im really interested
could i meet him
really
i dont trust anyone now
i only trust someone recommended
by a person i know well
but if youve known him so long
id feel much more at ease
do you really want to meet him
im deadly serious
this chain of recommendations
is best
how should i describe it
a belt of trust
this ones different
here
oh right
and this one
looks like a touch screen now
its not touch
it says you have to turn it
wow this thing
sir
taking our time are we
this is a nice car
this is it
come over here
hes in a meeting now
have a seat and wait here
hello nice to meet
but is it compatible
with a phone
oh not with a phone
you need more computing power
this isnt any sort of test
so dont be nervous
i was worn out at the office
so i came out for a bit
i understand
constant chatter all that bother
at least the car is peaceful
thank you
you seem to know the roads well
anything below the 38th parallel
after 30 years behind the wheel
the car almost drives itself
i respect those who work
in one field for a long time
well to be honest
this is a simple vocation
but the head of a household
the leader of a company
or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning
its companionship of a sort
so thats how ive approached each day
the years sure pass quickly
sure enough
your cornering is excellent
well it may look simple
but its one of the fundamentals
she may look like a sheep
but inside shes a fox
sometimes she acts like
she owns the house
right
of all the people in that house
shes lived there the longest
she was housekeeper
to the architect namgoong
but then she went on to work
for this family
when the architect moved out
he introduced this woman
to parks family
telling them this is a great housekeeper
you should hire her
so she survived
a change of ownership
she wont give up
a good job easily
to extract a woman like that
we need to prepare well
right we need a plan
i want to eat peaches
i like peaches best
why not ask for some
no peaches at our house
its forbidden fruit
so according to
what dahye told me
shes got a massively serious
allergy to peaches
you know that fuzz
on a peachs skin
if shes anywhere near it
she gets a full body rash
has trouble breathing asthma
a total meltdown
no no there werent
any peaches anywhere
thats what im saying
usually when i get symptoms
like this
i run to my room
and take my medicine
but it was so sudden
i wasnt sure where i left it
madame this woman behind me
is that
oh its our housekeeper
so its true oh how sad
i wasnt sure
if that was really her
ive only seen her a couple times
in the living room
this was in the hospital
a few days ago i went
for my annual medical exam
i took a selfie for my wife
and there she was behind me
is she talking
on the phone there
anyway i wasnt trying
to eavesdrop
i wasnt trying
to eavesdrop
but her words
came through clearly
so i couldnt help but
cut cut
dad your emotions are up
to here
bring them down to
about there
so i couldnt help
but overhear
keep it focused
what im trying to say is
its just that
your housekeepers voice
is quite loud you know
i understand its all right
just tell me okay
she said she got diagnosed
with active tb
and she was shouting
on the phone
so upset she could
barely control herself
tuberculosis
come on
its true she phoned someone
saying she had active tb
do people still get tb
dad
back in the day people used
to buy christmas seals right
feels like a bygone era
but i saw it on the internet
korea has the 1 rate of tb
of all the oecd countries
but shes still working
as if nothings wrong
with a kid like dasong
in the house
so youve got a young kid
like dasong in the house
and a tb patient is doing dishes
cooking spraying spittle
stop it please
dad arriving in 3 mins
if you get the chance
thisll be icing on the cake
madame
2nd floor sauna room
dont let her see you
have a seat
yes
mr kim
please dont tell any of this
to my husband okay
understood
if he hears i brought
a tb patient to our home
ill be hanged and quartered
dont worry madame
and if i may presume
to say one thing
i have no feelings
against that woman
i felt i had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene
but this could be
seen as snitching or
dont you worry
i wont mention the tb
ill just make up some excuse
to dismiss her
simply and quietly
its a proven method
thats the best
okay then
have you washed your hands
mr kim do you know
a good braised ribs place
somewhere close by
sure
then youll be eating out
thats right
why such a craving
for braised ribs today
our old housekeeper made delicious ribs
the one who quit this week
my wife wouldnt even tell me
why she quit
sure its easy enough
to hire a new one
still its a shame
she was a great housekeeper
i see
she kept the house
in great shape
and she knew never
to cross the line
i cant stand people
who cross the line
perhaps just one weak point
eating too much
she always ate enough for two
but considering all the work
she did
then you better find someone new
a new housekeeper
were in trouble now
in a week our house will be
a trash can
my clothes will start
to smell
my wife has no talent for housework
shes bad at cleaning
and her cookings awful
still you love her right
of course i love her
well call it love
then would this help
the care
what is this
i just recently found out
about them
how to describe it
its like a membership service
the company provides veterangrade
help to vip customers such as you
for example maids caregivers
or drivers like myself
you can tell from the card
theyre highclass
cool design
then how do you know
about this company
they contacted me
as a veterangrade driver
you might say they scouted me
but when their call came i had
already arranged to meet with you
i see
you turned down this famous company
to work for me
i wont forget that
son of a bitch
anyway i can give this card
to my wife right
yes thats why i brought it up
no need to mention me
you can tell her
you found the company yourself
sure
thanks to you i can play
the good husband
on the back theres a number
for consultations
tell her to call there
eyes on the road
hello this is
senior advisor yeo of the care
yes this is the cares main office
thats correct
if she wanted shed be
a fucking great con artist
isnt her voice tone great
takes after me
from what ive heard
its a full membership service
so youre not currently
a member i assume
thats right what steps do
i need to take
well just need to receive
a few documents from you
are you ready
to write this down
your family register
citizenship id cards
documents to prove
your income level
ie the title to your property etc
our property title
yes
wow peaches

what is it
whats he doing now
dasong dont do that
its the same
they smell the same
what are you talking about
go up to jessica
jessica smells like that too
so do we all need
to use different soap now
dad well need to use
different laundry soap too
and fabric softener
you mean doing four separate loads
of laundry each time
thats not it
its the semibasement smell
we need to leave this home
to lose the smell
anyway arent we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this
sure
in an age like ours
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates
our entire family got hired
thats right dad
if we put our 4 salaries together
the amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense
lets offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great mr park
and to min
kiwoo that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy
and thanks to him were all
fuck not again
that assholes dead
kiwoos on the rampage
dont overdo it

current weather is clear over
the clouds are moving
but theyre not rain clouds
over
i hear you over
currently your sisters lip is
pouting like a ducks bill
shes super annoyed over

and call kevin

we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad
look at her
she got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year
i even caught the bouquet
from a bitch ive never met
if you get the bouquet

thats how your acting got so good
acting is one thing
but this family is so gullible right
the madame especially

shes so naive and nice
shes rich but still nice
not rich but still nice
nice because shes rich
you know
hell if i had all this money
id be nice too
even nicer
thats true
your moms right
rich people are naive
no resentments
no creases on them
it all gets ironed out
money is an iron
those creases all get smoothed out
hey kiwoo

when mr namgoong moved to paris
in the time before mr parks family
moved in
i brought my husband down here
many rich houses have secret bunkers
where you can hide
in case north korea attacks
or if creditors break in
but it seems mr namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this
because he never mentioned it
to mr parks family
so only i know about it
so thats how it happened
but now that i know ive no choice
but to call the police
no please sis
as fellow members of the needy
please dont
im not needy
but were needy
weve no house no money
only debts
sis please
even after 4 years of hiding
those debt collectors wont give up
theyre still searching for him
threatening to stab him
you used loan sharks
its all my fault
the taiwan cake shop
my taiwanese wangshui
castella shop went bust
i was overwhelmed by debt

just a modest sum
but well send it
to you every month

great leader kim jongun
after witnessing
the charlatan family video

his shock and fury
at their wicked
despicable provocation

in this age of denuclearization
has commanded that the nations
last remaining nuclear warhead
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family
no one can imitate north korean

as the last nuclear graveyard

at home that day
late that night
when everyone was sleeping
dasong crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out
the whipped cream
on that cake was amazing
even in bed he couldnt stop
thinking about it
so dasong was sitting
eating his cake
he screamed
and i ran downstairs
and he was all
his eyes rolled back in his head
convulsions foam in his mouth
have you ever seen
a child have a seizure

they need 15minute treatment
or theyre done for

an emergency room 15 minutes

semibasements

dasong

it hurts
the emergency room
get the car
mr kim
what are you doing
we cant wait for an ambulance
stop pushing dad
makes it hurt more
car keys
the car keys
throw them
throw me the keys
are you okay
dont touch it
hello mr park
you know me
respect
opening my eyes for the first time
in a month
i saw a detective
you have the right to
an attorney
who looked nothing like
a detective
is he laughing
just a sec
then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke
that happens sometimes
after brain surgery
they keep laughing
for no reason
do you hear me
can you hear me
then do i have to do it again
do what
the miranda thing
you have the right to remain silent
anything you say can and
will be used against you
he keeps laughing look
even when i heard
how much kijung bled that day
even when i heard the words forgery
trespassing foul play selfdefense
and we were lucky
to get away with a probation
even when i finally
got to see kijungs face
kim kijung rip
i kept laughing
still when i went back
and watched the news reports
i didnt laugh
this sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upperclass home
is a highly unusual case
since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene
police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive
the driver kim and the slain mr park
are said to have been on good terms
for now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver kim
kim after exiting this door
and descending the stairs
disappeared into the neighboring alleys
police searched the cctvs
of nearby homes to no avail
and they have yet
to find any witnesses
given the situation
its not an exaggeration to say that
kim vanished into thin air
actually mom and i had no idea
where dad was
but those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us
eventually the news went quiet
and after the tails stopped
i started going up that mountain
from up there
you get a great view of the house
that day despite the cold
i felt like staying longer
dashdashdotdot
son
son
perhaps you if no one else
will be able to read this letter
you were a boy scout
so im writing this just
in case
have your injuries healed
im sure your mom is
plenty healthy
im doing fine in here
though thinking of
kijung makes me cry
even now what happened that day
doesnt seem real
it feels like a dream
and yet it doesnt
that day as i went out the gate
i suddenly knew
where i needed to go
a house where such
a grisly crime took place
would surely not be easy
to sell
im sorry mr park
i struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house
still thanks to the house
being empty
what was her name
moongwang
i was able to give her
a proper send off
i hear treeside burials are trendy
so hell i did my best
but those real estate
sharks sure are clever
they hoodwinked some people
who hadjust arrived in korea
and managed to sell the house
with the parents working
and the kids attending school
the family is usually out
but the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day
each time i go upstairs
i take my life in my hands
it turns out germans eat
more than just sausage and beer
what a relief
passing the time down here
everything starts to go hazy
today at least i was able
to write you a letter
if i send out the letter
this way every night
maybe someday youll see it
so long
youre home kiwoo
yeah
dad today i made a plan
a fundamental plan
im going to earn money
a lot of it
university a career marriage
those are all fine
but first ill earn money
youll see once you go in
but its very spacious
actually we dont show this house
to just anyone
when i have money
ill buy that house
on the day we move in
mom and i will be in the yard
because the sunshine is
