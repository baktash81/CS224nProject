old enough to understand
what the world is
you have to understand

things from his childhood
its time to go down downstairs
jack remember what your mom said
i think we got hot
yeah the lights
the lights will
get very warm
listening to you im sure you
must have felt at times as if
god had deserted you
in those very black moments
yeah
did you consider taking your
own life just to escape
im getting a feeling my client
its ok
im ok  can you give
her a minute please
im fine can i just
have a tissue
of course can we get
her a tissue please
here you go  hard to talk
im sure
sorry
you dont have to apologize
nobodys expecting you to be
you know the pillar
of strength you can cry
you know why dont we just go on to
the next question would that be ok
do you want to put your tissue
maybe under your chair
yeah
there you go
ok
good
ok
so
when jack came along
was it different for you then
when jack came
everything was different
he was so beautiful and
i just knew that i had
to keep him safe
of course of course
when hes older
will you tell jack
about his father
jacks not his
hes not his so are you saying
that there were other men
no
no
a father is a man
who loves his child
of course thats so true
in very real sense but the
the biological relationship
but thats not a relationship
jack is is nobodys but mine
when he was born did it
did it ever occur to you
to ask your captor
to take jack away
away
well to take
him to a hospital say
leave him there
where he could be found
why would i do that
so jack could be free
now this is the ultimate
sacrifice and i understand that
but did you think about him
having a normal childhood
but he had me
of course he did
but was that the best
thing for him
