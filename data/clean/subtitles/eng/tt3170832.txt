the way things had happened latly
  that alice   
   lately  
lately  that alice had
begun to think that
very few things indeed
were really impossible 
there s seemed to be no use
in waiting by the little door   
ma   
hey jack  do you
remember mouse 
yeah 
yeah 
do you know
where he is 
i do 
he s on the other
side of this wall 
what other side 
jack  there is two
sides to everything 
not in octagon

  but   
  an octagon has eight sides 
but a wall  ok 
a wall is like this 
see  we re on the inside   
the mouse is on the outside 
  in outer space 
  no  in the world 
it s much closer
than outer space 
i can t see the outside side 
listen  i know that i   
told you somethings else before
but you were much younger 
i didn t think that you could
understand but now you re so old   
and so smart  i know
that you can get this 
where do you think that
old nick gets our food 
  from tv by magic 
  there is no magic 
what you see on tv  those are pictures
of real things  of real people 
it s real stuff 
dora s real for real 
no  that s a drawing 
dora is a drawing 
but other people   
they have faces like us 
those are pictures of real things 
and all the other stuff you see
on there  that s real too 
that s real oceans 
real trees  real cats 
no way 
  where they all fit 
  they just do  they just fit 
they just fit out in the world 
jack  c mon   
you re so smart  i know that
you ve been wondering about this

and they rot  like salad in the fridge 
where s all that 
stuff you said 
trees and dogs 
and cats and grass

it from here   
because the skylight looks
upwards instead of sideways 
you re just tricking me 
no  i m not 
  liar  liar  pants on fire 
  jack 
i couldn t explain it before
because you were too small   
you were to small to understand
so i had to make up a story  but   
but now i m doing the opposite 
ok  i m doing the opposite
of lying  i am unlying 
because you re five now

old enough to understand   
what the world is 
you have to understand 
you have to understand 
we can t keep living like
this you need to help me 
i want to be four again

but he pretended
his dog was sick 
what s the dog s name 
jack  there wasn t a dog 
he was trying to trick me  ok 
there wasn t a dog 
old nick stole me 
i want a different story 
no  this is the story
that you get 
he put me in
his garden shed 
here  room is the shed

the only one that knows the code 
you know  the secret
numbers that open the door 
he is the only one that knows and
i ve been locked in here for seven years 
i ve been in here for seven years 
do you understand 
this story is boring 
jack  the world is so big 
it s so big you wouldn t
even believe it 
and room is just one
stinky part of it 
room is not stinky 
only when you do a fart 
my god   
i don t believe
in you stinky world 
ma   
it s warm again 
ma   
ma   
ma   
eggsnake s our longest
friend and fanciest 
meltedy spoon s the best to eat
with because he s more blobbier 
labyrinth is the twistiest 
and she hides things so i
don t know where they are 
toilet s the best
at disappearing poo 
lamp s the brightest except
when the power is cut 
you re the best at reading
and songs and lots 
except if you re
having a gone day 
i m the best at drawing and jumping
and growing and nearly everything 
 tv  but the turtle is
no longer afraid of that 
she is bigger now and
her shell is much harder 
are turtles real 
yeah  they are totally real 
i had a turtle as a pet 
and crocodiles and sharks 
yeah  they are all real 
real 
sort of 
so  these are real people but
they are playing dress up 
they are pretending that they re
people from hundreds of years ago 
just tv 
you re getting it 
when old nick comes back 
i m gonna kick him in the butt 
let me tell you something 
you know  one time i tried
to kick old nick in the butt 
i hid behind the door 
and i was holding the lid
from the toilet tank 
there used to be a lid on it 
it was the heaviest thing in room 
when he came in
i smashed it on his head 
but i messed up 
he shoved the door closed and
he grabbed me by the wrist 
that s why it s sore now 
we could wait till he s
asleep and kill him dead 
yeah  we could  but   
then what    
we d ran out of food 
and we don t know
the code to the door 
hey  the grandma and
grandpa could come

i will see my daughter 
you don t need me 
you ve been doing
just fine without me 
how can you say that 
do you think that you re the only
one who s life was destroyed 
actually  that s
exactly what i think 
yeah  how would you feel if
somebody took jack away from you 
  oh shut up 
  go easy 
look at him 
you should be
thinking about him 
don t you tell me how
to look after my son 
i m sorry that i m
not nice anymore 
you know what  maybe if
your voice saying  be nice    
hadn t been in my head  then   
maybe i wouldn t have helped
the guy with a fucking sick dog 
stay there  jack 
i m calling
the fucking lawyer 
i can t stand this place 
isabelle  so what are we
thinking for the walk and talk 
and i want you to know that
you guide this interview  ok 
so  what you feel comfortable
with  you talk about it 
and when you don t 
you just say   
 not comfortable  and we
move on to another question 
  ok 
  and i m gonna  you know  
my lawyer said that s   
  you re good 
  thanks 
did you ever think you
could see this house again 
i hoped 
  you hoped 
  yes 
and did you think about
things from his childhood 
it s time to go down downstairs 
jack  remember what your mom said 
  i think we got hot 
  yeah  the lights 
the lights will
get very warm 
listening to you i m sure you
must have felt at times as if   
god had deserted you 
  in those very black moments   
  yeah 
did you consider taking your
own life  just to escape 
  i m getting a feeling my client   
  it s ok 
  i m ok    can you give
her a minute  please 
i m fine  can i just
have a tissue 
of course  can we get
her a tissue  please 
  here you go    hard to talk 
  i m sure 
  sorry 
  you don t have to apologize 
nobody s expecting you to be 
you know  the pillar
of strength  you can cry 
you know  why don t we just go on to
the next question  would that be ok 
do you want to put your tissue 
maybe under your chair 
yeah 
  there you go 
  ok 
  good 
  ok 
so   
when jack came along   
was it different for you then 
when jack came
everything was different 
he was so beautiful    and   
i just knew that i had
to keep him safe 
of course  of course 
when he s older   
will you tell jack
about his father 
jack s not his 
he s not his  so are you saying
that there were other men 
no 
no 
a father is a man
who loves his child 
of course  that s so true
in very real sense  but the  
  the biological relationship   
  but that s not a relationship 
jack is  is nobody s but mine 
  when he was born  did it 
did it ever occur to you   
to ask your captor
to take jack away 
away 
well  to take
him to a hospital  say   
leave him there
where he could be found 
why would i do that 
  so jack could be free 
now  this is the ultimate
sacrifice and i understand that   
but did you think about him
having a normal childhood 
  but he had me 
  of course he did 
but  was that the best
thing for him 
ma 
ma
