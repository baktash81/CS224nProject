they remain in my thoughts 
once  i took off my robe 
and i forgot to wear shorts 
i recall every fall 
hook  and jab  
bad way to get rid of flab 
as you know  my life
wasn t drab  though i d much   
though i d rather hear you cheer
when i delve into shakespeare 
my kingdom for a horse 
i haven t won in months 
though i m no olivier 
i d rather   
i m no olivier  but it ain t
the ring  it s the play 
give me a stage where i ll rage 
though i can fight 
i d rather recite 
that s entertainment

la motta has won 
a unanimous decision 
he s handing robinson
his first professional loss 
robinson doesn t like it 
with this victory  la motta
