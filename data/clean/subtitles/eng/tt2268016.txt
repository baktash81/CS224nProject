we just do it on the way up

right
oh right
this stripper convention
that i keep hearing about
yep
its the infamous convention
which one are you then
you um
which what
are you cop in a thong
or iron man in a thong
i am i am
youre gonna have to pay
to see that
thats what i am
or ill just load up on all
those fantastic 80s hair bands
for my drive instead
where you going
where you headed
uh
just on the road again
new york this time
okay
um and i
basically im just trying to
avoid ending up on the pole
like you
but you never know
stripper pissing on beach
in contemplative pose
could sell for thousands
one day
if thats true
then i will whip it out
and start peeing on whatever
you tell me to pee on
and we can just
we can cash in
fantastic
i love the enthusiasm
save some of it though
because you and i are gonna
untie that sailboat over there
and organize a firstever
crossdressing search party
out to that island
what do you say
uh
win or die stripper guy
ii say that um
i would actually love
to do that
but id say i know what happens
on that island
and i just thats just
mmhmm
i think im gonna opt out
oh
what happens on that island
its just i know what happens
for me on that island
oh i see
you think im gonna hook up
with you mm
thats not at all what i said
at all
thats the farthest thing
from what i said
cause i said i would want to go
to that island
and then i know
what i would do
and then somehow that probably
wouldnt work out
on any level that i would
want it to work out on
and then i think
that its probably better
if i just go back
yeah
wow
okay
well fret not casanova
youre safe with me
im not going through
a guy phase anyway
oh
well in that case
that makes things easier
yeah cause then
all the more reason
for me to probably just go do
the goodnight thing

can i pitch you something
let me just
throw something out

with some new routines
we we cant do that man
we got two days
i mean mike thats what
weve rehearsed man
yeah and dont call our shit lame bro
youre right you know what
im not calling
your shit lame
im just saying that cowboys
and firemen dancing to 80s rock

all right
have you ever wanted to be
a fireman
a real one

hotter than hell
hotter than hell
do you like that song
crushes
i know it crushes
but do you like it
do you play it
when youre not onstage
i dont see your point
here
my point is if you dont
like it why did you pick it
well i didnt pick it
dallas did
exactly my point
dallas picked it
you didnt pick it so its not
on the inside you know what
just because you made up some of
your own routines back in the day
doesnt mean that you get to
waltz back in here
after three years and try to
tell us how to run our own shit
im not trying to tell you
what the fuck to do no
im just say
there is no fucking universe
in which i am not doing
that fireman routine

yeah
well until i uh
i went to work with dallas

right
yeah yeah
its just outside of charleston
she texted me the address
i dont know
ill tell you

that was like
it was a good night
im not gonna lie to you
your stuff is revolutionary
man
sometimes the songs
are a little
no man it was perfect
are you kidding me
i appreciate that and you
just made that up on the spot
i well rome likes us
to put our passion in our work
well it shows man
ive never seen anything
like that
are you doing anything else
with your music
man im trying
i put it up online
hopefully like itll spread
through social media
but honestly with this ep
thats coming out its
oh cool man
its hard to get people
to pay attention to it
cause theres so much shit that comes
on the internet every day oh so much
i just want to stay
authentic
yeah well
at least youre trying man
at least youre trying
thats why i moved
down to florida back in the day
actually
was to do music stuff
really
yeah yeah
i sang
in dream along with mickey
at disney world
from 03 to 05
what
yeah man
for real
i mean i started out
as the donald duck understudy
but i i was playing mickey
by my second year
i got signed by an agent
booked a couple
regional commercial spots
and one day i heard an ad on
the radio looking for dancers
and you know how that shit goes
so
when i started this
i thought
man i thought id hate it
but now if the if like
the ep blew up tomorrow
id probably still do this
on the side
what
im serious
youre shitting me
do you see how many girls i meet
every day
yes
for free
for free
i dont got to pay for
all i do is sing
and you think about that
like these girls have to deal
with men in their lives
every day who
they dont listen to them
they dont ask them
what they want
they dont even ask them
what they want
all we got to do is ask them
what they want
and when they tell you
