so i seek out my people 
you are one  you are one 
mm hmm  on the inside

mostly 
of course
it s on the inside 
yeah 
what s her name 
dolly titz 
dolly tits 
with a  z  
with a  z  
mm hmm 
where is she from 
here 
okay 
and she loves couponing
and nascar 
i got an inner drag queen  too 
oh  really 
yeah 
okay  i figured 
uh  what s her name 
her name is   
clitoria labia is her name 
that s actually not bad 
it s not bad at all 
she s    she s the main bitch 
she s like cheetara

and they always sing
 rapper s delight 
everywhere they go 
so  you and your friends  um 
frequent drag shows  do you 
no 
not    well  somet   
we just do it on the way up
to myrtle beach every year 
right 
oh  right 
this stripper convention
that i keep hearing about 
yep 
it s the infamous convention 
which one are you  then 
you  um   
which what 
are you cop in a thong
or iron man in a thong 
i am    i am   
you re gonna have to pay
to see that 
that s what i am 
or i ll just load up on all
those fantastic  80s hair bands
for my drive instead 
where you going 
where you headed 
uh   
just on the road again 
new york this time 
okay 
um  and i   
basically  i m just trying to
avoid ending up on the pole 
like you 
but you never know 
 stripper pissing on beach
in contemplative pose 
could sell for thousands
one day 
if that s true 
then i will whip it out
and start peeing on whatever
you tell me to pee on 
and we can just   
we can cash in 
fantastic 
i love the enthusiasm 
save some of it  though 
because you and i are gonna
untie that sailboat over there
and organize a first ever
cross dressing search party
out to that island 
what do you say 
uh   
win or die  stripper guy 
i i say that  um   
i would actually love
to do that 
but i d say i know what happens
on that island 
and i just    that s just   
mm hmm 
i think i m gonna opt out 
oh 
what happens on that island 
it s just i know what happens
for me on that island 
oh  i see 
you think i m gonna hook up
with you  mm 
that s not at all what i said 
at all 
that s the farthest thing
from what i said 
 cause i said i would want to go
to that island 
and then i know
what i would do
and then somehow that probably
wouldn t work out
on any level that i would
want it to work out on 
and then i think
that it s probably better
if i just go back 
yeah 
wow 
okay 
well  fret not  casanova 
you re safe with me 
i m not going through
a guy phase anyway 
oh 
well  in that case 
that makes things easier 
yeah   cause then
all the more reason
for me to probably just go do
the good night thing 
okay  yeah 
it was nice to meet you  though 
dolly titz 
back at you  clitoria 
good morning 
good morning 
you sleep okay

i had the dog 
i had  downton abbey 
on the weekends 
i even did the proposal
on the beach
with bacon and mimosas
and pancakes and all that 
and for whatever reason
that i ll probably never
understand   
she wanted something else 
so i came on this trip
with you fucks

with it 
so i m gonna be damned
if i m gonna just let it end
right here and now

i d say you had a thing 
yeah 
well  until i  uh 
i went to work with dallas 
yeah 
so    is she gonna come help us
or what 
no 
no 
i don t    i don t think
that s gonna actually happen 
rome likes to stay
in her castle 
that s why she built it 
so  uh  i getting on 95 north 
right 
yeah  yeah 
it s just outside of charleston 
she texted me the address 
i don t know 
i ll tell you
when we get closer 
you need a co pilot

that was insane tonight 
man 
thanks  i m serious  dude 
that was like   
it was a good night 
i m not gonna lie to you 
your stuff is revolutionary 
man 
sometimes the songs
are a little   
no  man  it was perfect 
are you kidding me 
i appreciate that  and you
just made that up on the spot 
i    well  rome likes us
to put our passion in our work 
well  it shows  man 
i ve never seen anything
like that 
are you doing anything else
with your music 
man  i m trying 
i put it up online 
hopefully  like  it ll spread
through social media 
but honestly  with this e p 
that s coming out  it s   
oh  cool  man 
it s hard to get people
to pay attention to it 
 cause there s so much shit that comes
on the internet every day  oh  so much 
i just want to stay
authentic 
yeah  well 
at least you re trying  man 
at least you re trying 
that s why i moved
down to florida back in the day 
actually 
was to do music stuff 
really 
yeah  yeah 
i sang
in  dream along with mickey 
at disney world
from  03 to  05 
what 
yeah  man 
for real 
i mean  i started out
as the donald duck understudy 
but i    i was playing mickey
by my second year 
i got signed by an agent 
booked a couple
regional commercial spots 
and one day i heard an ad on
the radio looking for dancers 
and you know how that shit goes 
so   
when i started this 
i thought

oh  i knew enough 
i knew he really liked it
when i put my fing   
mom  no  i don t want to hear that 
hey

sweet and loving and nurturing 
you got to talk to him 
 cause if he s not gonna

  baby  you re all that i want  
  when you re lying here
in my arms  
  i m finding it hard to believe
we re in heaven

of course you re   
you re eating cake by yourself
when  uh  the fireworks
are about to go off in there 
this isn t concerning at all 
what can i say 
i like cake 
do you have any idea
what s going on out there 
a lady is about to get   
i don t even know
how to put it into words 
no 
i m a cookie guy 
what 
yeah 
it s red fucking velvet 
i would take a pack of oreos
over that bullshit
any day of the week 
what s wrong with you 
nothing s wrong 
 cause cookies are awesome 
well  i don t think
we have anything more
to say to one another 
look  if you don t want to talk
about it or whatever   
i don t know
if it s about new york   
but i maybe intuit
that it might be   
i m gonna start hiding
the kitchen knives in a minute 
seriously 
it is that obvious 
what s up 
i met a photographer in miami
at this party i was working at 
he was nice and married
and all of that 
mm 
took a look at my photos
and said i had an eye 
offered me a job right there
on the spot as his assistant 
that s cool 
i mean  did he offer a place
for you to stay as well
that happened to be his house
when his wife was away 
that   
yeah 
wait 
were you there 
i was there  but i was in drag 
you wouldn t have recognized me 
mm  but i just want to throw
this out there  though 
um  this might be god s way
of giving you a second chance
at myrtle beach 
mm 
any god worth believing in
certainly sends you dudes
in thongs when in need 
or she just knows
that some asshole in miami   
she 
yes  my god is a she 
um  she just might know that   
i don t know   
some asshole in miami stole your
smile and you need it back 
and i can guarantee you
that strippers will give
smiles aplenty
and make you forget
about new york 
and if that doesn t work  then
there will be 3 000 women there 
seeing as you re not
in a boy phase 
that s quite a pitch 
mm 
look  when shit s not going
your way 
getting a little crazy
with some random friends
has a way of helping you
sort out your own shit 
so i m your friend now 
you ve seen me pee 
i don t know anyone that s not
my friend that s seen me pee 
fair enough 
look  i don t normally trust
a cookie guy   
but i ll   
i ll think about it 
that s valid 
all right 
you think about it  dolly 
i m gonna go back in there
and feed the wolves 
 cause it s getting
a little rabid in there
