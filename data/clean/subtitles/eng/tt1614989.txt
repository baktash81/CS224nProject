more than 10 minutes 
every minute increases the chance
of someone coming home unexpectedly 
three    don t leave any dna traces 
four    don t waste time
getting an expensive reproduction 
even a simple forgery
will take weeks to be discovered 
five    sooner or later 
one of two things is bound to happen 
you find a work of art so valuable
that you never need to worry again 
or you get caught 
my name is roger brown 
i m 1 68 metres tall 
you don t need a shrink to realise
that needs compensation 
for instance  my house
is worth 30 million kroner 
i don t like it  and i can t afford it 
but she loves it 
please come  how often does
one of your girlfriends open a gallery 
i told her i had inherited the money 
but all i ve inherited is bad genes 
this has been an intricate case 
for someone like me to get
what he wants  only one thing matters   
lots of money 
but there is one thing
diana wants more than anything else 
exactly the one thing
i don t want to give her 
  isn t she cute 
  real cute 
diana strøm eliassen
is one of those tall  smart beauties 
those used to being loved 
those who take love for granted 
and there are plenty of men
who would give her love 
men taller than 1 68 
but soon my time will come 
my opportunity  i can feel it 
meanwhile  i play for high stakes 
if you don t gamble  you don t win 
  what are you doing tomorrow 
  why 
we re invited to a dinner 
we re invited to a dinner 
  we are invited to a dinner 
  yes 
  are you telling others about us 
  there s someone i want you to meet 
  this ends right here and now 
  please don t   
  you and me do not exist 
  please stop it 
  an impressive cv  lander 
  thank you 
yes  i believe
i m the right man for pathfinder 
  what about life outside the job 
  is there such a thing 
you live here inoslo  at skøyen 
and are married to    
camilla  been married nine years 
two kids  they are in school 
  she holds a job 
  yes  at a downtown law firm 
  who stays home if a child falls ill 
  she does 
  no maid 
  no 
  dog 
  no 
  allergic 
  no 
how much
is your reputation as leader worth 
my reputation 
what do you mean 
this work by julianopie
is worth a quarter of a million 
  got any equally expensive art 
  i do 
a munch lithograph   the brooch  
could you estimate its value
just by looking at it 
this one consists of a few circles
and lines  it s monotone  no texture 
all that makes it worth a quarter
of a million is the artist s reputation 
  and the same thing goes for leaders 
  exactly 
and that is why
you will not land this job 
  what 
  my god  you applied for it yourself 
  what else was i supposed to do 
  get someone to tip us about you 
pretend you didn t know about it
when we contacted you 
  but   
  it s all a game  lander 
i want you to meet pathfinder s
chairman and manager tomorrow 
listen politely  then tell them
why you re no longer interested 
  i would seem unreliable 
  no 
they would see you as ambitious 
someone who knows his own worth 
  landler  this is your opportunity 
  opportunity 
let me build your reputation 
andl i promise you a position which
quintuples your income within two years 
how can you promise this 
because i have never given a client
a recommendation he hasn t followed 
  but how 
  the answer starts with an  r  
  reputation   
  my entire career is based on it 
hi

the  calydonian boar hunt   by rubens 
stolen by the germans
in antwerp in 1941 
it s been missing ever since 
do you know where it is 
  no 
  in clas greve s apartment 
clas s grandmother had a secret affair
with a german officer during the war 
but he was arrested
and shot a few days later 
  she was scared of being exposed 
  and hid the painting 
  but it s not genuine 
  did the germans want reproductions 
  why did he tell you 
  he asked if i could evaluate it 
or if i knew someone who could 
you think clas greve has a genuine
rubens hanging in his apartment 
  here in oslo 
  yes 
i offered to contact an art museum 
to have it moved as soon as possible 
next week  you don t place a painting
like this into a safe deposit box 
  how much do you think it s worth 
  tens of millions  maybe a hundred 
do you know what i think 
that you and i should celebrate 
  celebrate what 
  that you opened your own gallery 
  and the twwo of us 
  thanks for supporting me  roger 
  everything is going to be fine 
  what do you mean 
that you and i should start
thinking about the future 
  ove here 
  we have a candidate 
  do you know what the time is 
  clas greve  25 oscar street 
  what  he is grave 
  no  his name is greve 
ove 
  ove  what s happening 
  sorry  natasha is here 
  come again 
  meet me at the cabin tomorrow 
no  not tomorrow  it s saturday 
i ve got her for the whole weekend 
this is a big deal  ove 
we only have a couple of days 
  one o clock 
  ok 
  you are so sweet 
  good morning 
  listen   
  yes 
what you said yesterday
about the future   
does it include the sound
of tiny feet in these corridors 
  maybe 
  don t give me maybe  roger 
i told you
that everything would be fine 
  i want that conversation now 
  but i have an important meeting 
do you think i m stupid 
an important meeting 
was it set up during the night 
i have to go 
i ll call you later 
  what are you so scared of 
  nothing 
dogs  and you when you re like this 
if you want us to be childless forever 
i would like to know 
we ll have the conversation 
but now i have an important meeting 
  i ve tried to talk now for seven years 
  and there ll be seven more 
if you continue nagging this way 
i didn t mean that 
you will never give me a child 
how many millions
are we talking about 
  maybe up to a hundred 
  a hundred  
this happens every time 
i ve told you i don t like
those things lying around 
you know i always carry weapons 
at home i ve got weapons everywhere 
got a gun within reach in every room 
you shouldl get one as well 
sooner or later they ll be coming 
we do it this way    you go to
gothenburg and get a reproduction 
we need a good one  i have lunch
with clas greve on monday   
ove 
  i told you to stay in the car 
  but i have no light 
out  we re having a meeting 
women   
like i said before i was interrupted
by a russian prostitute   
during lunch monday i ll find out
when the apartment is empty 
  you go to sweden immediately  now 
  ok 
  shit  no  i can t  i m busy 
  busy 
natasha is here 
i ll make a new film with her 
i ve arranged everything
with the guys at work 
  you re filming her 
  i need something to watch 
i just activate the alarm
and the cameras start rolling 
  she doesn t know you re filming 
  no way 
and the tripolis guards
are watching the two of you    
the cameras are not directed
towards the bed 
they see her undress
and a bit of fingering  that s it 
she s cut her hair 
looks nice 
the rest is private 
cool  eh 
the painting is removed
in only a few days 
  do you realise how big this is 
  she s here twwice in six months 
you ll be left with millions 
with that kind of money  you can
buy her  for the rest of your life 
the one without scampi jelly 
and dressing on the side 
will you settle in oslo now 
or will you commute 
three and a half million 
plus stock options 
i m afraid you take things for granted 
remember you re a foreigner 
norwegian companies want   
i don t doubt that your methods
will work on most people 
but we ve been
in this situation before 
you practically dribbled   
you drooled when we met at the gallery 
and with good reason 
the problem was only
that i was not interested in a job 
but redecoration is not that interesting
in the long run 
so if it s ok with you 
let s just drop the charade 
ok  i surrender 
  but i still need more data on you 
  do you play squash 
  married 
  divorced 
  children 
  no 
  dog 
  yes 
  still in amsterdam 
  in quarantine 
i ll fly down to get him tomorrow 
the gps business is a tough one 
  your back 
  oh  that s from the army 
i enrolled when i was 18 
after a few years  i entered
an elite unit which specialised   
  in what 
  tracking 
  tracking of    
  people 
missing people  fugitives 
  and the technology came from hote 
  exactly 
they produced
microscopic transmitters 
i hadl improvement suggestions 
so they recruited me 
  where did you get those scars 
  bolivia 
  were you tortured 
  i was lucky  i got out in time 
  sounds like something from a film 
  no  you ve never seen this on film 
  when can we meet with pathfinder 
  any time 
  when are you back 
  the day after tomorrow 
let s do it then 
diana 
out with clients 
home late  d 
no  murphy  come here 
this is diana  i cannot answer
the phone right now  have a nice day 
  hi 
  you re so late 
  i tried to call your mobile phone

  no 
i just wanted to hear your voice 
that s sweet  come and sit down 
this film just started 
no  i   
i m totally beat 
i m going to bed 
ok 
we developed this gel containing
hundreds of transmitters per millilitre 
it adlheres to all materials
and is impossible to remove 
you mean trace 
the disadvantage is that trace
is hypersensitive to dirt and mud 
i know this from my experience
as a soldier 
when you re stuck in  pardon
my french  the arsehole of the world 
then you are dependent
on your equipment 
being introduced by brown
is of great significance 
his recommendations are vital 
just a moment 
  great meeting  thanks a lot 
  thank you so much 
when will you write
the recommendation 
  we have to make a decision first 
  what was that 
there are other candidates 
we have to consider the total picture 
did we attend the same meeting 
they were readly to sign the contract
here and now 
well  then your chances are good 
hi 
you go to gothenburg tonight  ove 
the painting has to be traded for money 
as quickly as possible 
hi  i have to talk to you 
  don t look me up this way  lotte 
  please  just twwo seconds 
i m sorry if it s my fault
you re feeling this way  but we have   
there s really

i miss you so much 
lotte   
lotte    don t contact me again 
  you look tired 
  thank you 
  anything wrong

  quite a bit 
i had a meeting today with pathfinder
and clas greve 
  did it work out fine 
  no 
  he won t get the job 
  definitely not 
tomorrow  i ll call
all the other agencies 
i ll make sure he won t get
a single job in norway 
why is that 
by the way

  what happened 
  you sat on a syringe in my car 
a syringe 
  you were lucky 
  lucky  
it must have hit your knee 
you didn t absorb all the poison 
  did you fuck up 
  that s not what it s about 
  diana has an affair with clas greve 
  that s no reason to kill you 
  call 113 
  we don t want the police here 
please  roger 
i need to get to a hospital 
  or else i die 
  i ll get you some milk 
milk neutralises poison  that s what
they would do at the hospital 
here   
  call them 
  don t do anything stupid 
then i do it myself 
just calm down now   
roger 
i would like to talk to you

our main research
was into the tracking of people 
microscopic transmitters

  what a rush of people today 
  i m just visiting roger brown 
  that businessman 
  yes 
  what do you want from him 
  we have an appointment 
it s none of my business  but   
he probably didn t invite you
for coffee and cakes in the cabin 
in the cabin 
and since it s my property  maybe
a slight compensation would be fair 
search 
hello

  did anyone ask for me 
  no  get back to bed 
except for the police 
they re waiting for you in the corridor

hundreds of transmitters per millilitre 
it adheres to all materials
and is impossible to remove

  it s not my fault 
  what s going on  
  please   
  what does greve want from me 
  it s the pathfinder job 
  you don t kill people for a job 
it s about billions 
they worked on this for months  ever
since pathfinder sought a new ceo 
  who are  they   
  clas 
  he still works for hote 
  what 
what  
they have
massive economic problems 
amtech demands that hote provide
them with pathfinder s technology 
  this was clas s assignment 
  are you all insane 
i was to get to know you 
then introduce you to him 
but he had to change plans  since
you didn t want to see me anymore 
he had to find a way to meet you 
his grandmother had an
old reproduction of a rubens painting 
he made up a wild story that she had
gotten it from a german officer 
he told diana the story 
and she believed him 
then he met you 
the only thing i ve done
is to rub transmitters into your hair 
did you do that 
did you smear that shit
into my hair  
  is diana involved 
  i think so 
  you think so  
  i didn t want this to happen 
i just want to get away from him 
please help me 
may i have a glass of water 
lotte 
the suspect dlied in the accident 
with three of the four policemen 
the last police officer is still missing 
military divers are now searching
along the river 
diana 
roger

i know why you left  there s
nothing more between clas and me 
i tried to tell you in the garage 
but i couldn t 
  what do you know about    
  i have to tell you this now 
i didn t want it to happen 
but you hurt me 
he was so easy to talk to 
and i just   
i couldn t stand it anymore 
but it was wrong 
and i m so ashamed 
because you are the one i want 
if you really think we shouldn t
have children  we don t need to 
i m willing to do anything 
you really do love me   
you must never doubt that 
promise me 
  and you didn t know anything 
  about what 
you didn t know anything 
oh  my god 
what has happened 
come here 
dog bites are very serious  roger 
you have to see a doctor 
it s not that convenient right now 
hold this 
  what are you planning to do 
  i don t know 
they ll soon find out
who died in the accident 
i have to remove evidence 
and then 
i have to get away from here 
make a new start 
maybe you and i could   
i can wait a while
before i report it stolen 
i have to clean these too 
did you love her 
no 
how could you be
so goddamn stupid 
steal works of art 
to buy things i don t need 
who do you think i am 
you have asked me
what i m scared of 
and i ve been scared
since i first met you 
i ve been scared
that you would leave me 
scared that we would have a child
which you would love more than me 
and i ve been scared
that you would see me as i really am 
and hate it 
i have to meet you  diana 
  i m sorry about this  greve 
  it s quite alright 
roger brown is on
an unexpected journey abroad 
  sounds exciting 
  to save an important contract 
but you re in safe hands now 
there are only formalities left 
so it won t take very long 
we were supposed
to change a fan at b4 
we ve been in and out the whole day 
but this card doesn t work 
forensic institute
thank you 
hello  guys 
sorry  we re a bit behind here 
a lady just got in who s been lying dead
on heating cables for two weeks 
  any thoughts on this 
  typical car accident injuries 
the cause of death
is internal haemorrhages 
where are the peanuts 
it says here there was a bag of peanuts 
well  i didn t eat them 
  has anyone unauthorised been here 
  to steal a bag of peanuts 
who s that 
what the hell
is going on here  roger 
are you removing evidence 
think you ll get out of this 
what the hell 
so you realised
the transmitters were in your hair 
and that it was lotte    
  that s why you killed her 
  does it feel like a loss 
i ll give you a choice 
if you tell me what s going on 
i ll shoot you in the head 
  if not  a bullet in your stomach 
  don t you feel anything 
i would like to know
if people like you really exist 
people like me 
people who are not capable of love 
who are without empathy 
  empathy 
  yes 
if you want the answer 
just look in the mirror 
  i m not like you 
  you re not 
no 
  i have lovedl someone 
  you have loved someone  diana 
you have loved her 
i m afraid i have bad news for you 
she tells me she longs for me 
she wants me 
and i m only human 
have you ever loved anyone 
except for your dead dog 
i have no time for this  i ve got
an appointment with diana tonight 
you went and got the hair 
you knew i d be coming for you  why 
a shot in the stomach means
a slow death  you ll beg me to kill you 
so i ask you for the last time   
why am i here 
what are you smiling at 
why am i here 
hold it right there 
do you know
why i was smiling  clas 
because you just proved
that diana loves me 
she didn t come to you
because she wanted you 
she came to change the cartridges
in your pistol 
she exchanged the bullets in your gun
for blank cartridges 
or what do you call them in danish 
blanks 
  what are you talking about 
  she hates you 
she wants you to die 
but i will give you one chance 
i have no idea how many bullets
diana managed to switch 
this is not like you  clas 
is it over 
yes 
i may not know myself  but i know
others  and that s what i gambled on 
welcome to this press conference 
led by the oslo police and kripos 
i had prepared well 
the police would find the pistol
from the crash on kjikerud s night table 
this pistol also killed lotte madsen 
whom the press called greve s lover 
how the  art burglars  ove kjikerud
and clas greve killed each other   
   was watched by a whole world
on the internet 
the police would find
that the pistol greve fired
was identical to the one
that killed ove 
he should never
have picked up that gun 
we are pleased to present
a breakthrough in the case 
but even though
i had done everything right 
there was one thing
i could not change 
ove was already dead
when i shot greve 
but brede sperre is norway s
most renowned investigator 
unsolved cases is not his style 
especially after vg called him
 the man who makes norway
sleep well at night   
because he is competent 
obviously 
but mainly because he knows
what it takes to get ahead in this world 
and what would that be 
the answer starts with an  r  
reputation 
it gets you on tv and providles you
with smses from unknown women 
we think they celebrated the theft
and that it got out of control 
they end up torturing a dog
and killing the farmer 
that s correct 
for sale
have a nice day 
both of you 
  we are ready 
  send in the candidate in one minute 
ferdinand    thank you 
hi  i m sorry  please sit down 
i asked you to come here
because we are at the end of
a long and dramatic hunt
for pathfinder s new leader 
in the last round 
he could not leave his position 
without promising too much 
i think i have persuaded him 
please welcome    jeremias lander
