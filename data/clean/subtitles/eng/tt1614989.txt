more than 10 minutes
every minute increases the chance
of someone coming home unexpectedly
three dont leave any dna traces
four dont waste time
getting an expensive reproduction
even a simple forgery
will take weeks to be discovered
five sooner or later
one of two things is bound to happen
you find a work of art so valuable
that you never need to worry again
or you get caught
my name is roger brown
im 168 metres tall
you dont need a shrink to realise
that needs compensation
for instance my house
is worth 30 million kroner
i dont like it and i cant afford it
but she loves it
please come how often does
one of your girlfriends open a gallery
i told her i had inherited the money
but all ive inherited is bad genes
this has been an intricate case
for someone like me to get
what he wants only one thing matters
lots of money
but there is one thing
diana wants more than anything else
exactly the one thing
i dont want to give her
isnt she cute
real cute
diana strømeliassen
is one of those tall smart beauties
those used to being loved
those who take love for granted
and there are plenty of men
who would give her love
men taller than 168
but soon my time will come
my opportunity i can feel it
meanwhile i play for high stakes
if you dont gamble you dont win
what are you doing tomorrow
why
were invited to a dinner
were invited to a dinner
we are invited to a dinner
yes
are you telling others about us
theres someone i want you to meet
this ends right here and now
please dont
you and me do not exist
please stop it
an impressive cv lander
thank you
yes i believe
im the right man for pathfinder
what about life outside the job
is there such a thing
you live here inoslo at skøyen
and are married to
camilla been married nine years
two kids they are in school
she holds a job
yes at a downtown law firm
who stays home if a child falls ill
she does
no maid
no
dog
no
allergic
no
how much
is your reputation as leader worth
my reputation
what do you mean
this work by julianopie
is worth a quarter of a million
got any equally expensive art
i do
a munch lithograph the brooch
could you estimate its value
just by looking at it
this one consists of a few circles
and lines its monotone no texture
all that makes it worth a quarter
of a million is the artists reputation
and the same thing goes for leaders
exactly
and that is why
you will not land this job
what
my god you applied for it yourself
what else was i supposed to do
get someone to tip us about you
pretend you didnt know about it
when we contacted you
but
its all a game lander
i want you to meet pathfinders
chairman and manager tomorrow
listen politely then tell them
why youre no longer interested
i would seem unreliable
no
they would see you as ambitious
someone who knows his own worth
landler this is your opportunity
opportunity
let me build your reputation
andl i promise you a position which
quintuples your income within two years
how can you promise this
because i have never given a client
a recommendation he hasnt followed
but how
the answer starts with an r
reputation
my entire career is based on it

no
in clas greves apartment
class grandmother had a secret affair
with a german officer during the war
but he was arrested
and shot a few days later
she was scared of being exposed
and hid the painting
but its not genuine
did the germans want reproductions
why did he tell you
he asked if i could evaluate it
or if i knew someone who could
you think clas greve has a genuine
rubens hanging in his apartment
here in oslo
yes
i offered to contact an art museum
to have it moved as soon as possible
next week you dont place a painting
like this into a safedeposit box
how much do you think its worth
tens of millions maybe a hundred
do you know what i think
that you and i should celebrate
celebrate what
that you opened your own gallery
and the twwo of us
thanks for supporting me roger
everything is going to be fine
what do you mean
that you and i should start
thinking about the future
ove here

this is a big deal ove
we only have a couple of days
one oclock
ok
you are so sweet
good morning

yes
what you said yesterday
about the future
does it include the sound
of tiny feet in these corridors
maybe
dont give me maybe roger
i told you
that everything would be fine
i want that conversation now
but i have an important meeting
do you think im stupid
an important meeting
was it set up during the night
i have to go
ill call you later
what are you so scared of
nothing
dogs and you when youre like this
if you want us to be childless forever
i would like to know
well have the conversation
but now i have an important meeting
ive tried to talk now for seven years
and therell be seven more
if you continue nagging this way
i didnt mean that
you will never give me a child
how many millions
are we talking about
maybe up to a hundred
a hundred
this happens every time
ive told you i dont like
those things lying around
you know i always carry weapons
at home ive got weapons everywhere
got a gun within reach in every room
you shouldl get one as well
sooner or later theyll be coming
we do it this way you go to
gothenburg and get a reproduction
we need a good one i have lunch
with clas greve on monday
ove
i told you to stay in the car
but i have no light
out were having a meeting
women
like i said before i was interrupted
by a russian prostitute
during lunch monday ill find out
when the apartment is empty
you go to sweden immediately now
ok
shit no i cant im busy
busy
natasha is here
ill make a new film with her
ive arranged everything
with the guys at work
youre filming her
i need something to watch
i just activate the alarm
and the cameras start rolling
she doesnt know youre filming
no way
and the tripolis guards
are watching the two of you
the cameras are not directed
towards the bed
they see her undress
and a bit of fingering thats it
shes cut her hair
looks nice
the rest is private
cool eh
the painting is removed
in only a few days
do you realise how big this is
shes here twwice in six months
youll be left with millions
with that kind of money you can
buy her for the rest of your life
the one without scampi jelly
and dressing on the side
will you settle in oslo now
or will you commute
three and a half million
plus stock options
im afraid you take things for granted
remember youre a foreigner
norwegian companies want
i dont doubt that your methods
will work on most people
but weve been
in this situation before
you practically dribbled
you drooled when we met at the gallery
and with good reason
the problem was only
that i was not interested in a job
but redecoration is not that interesting
in the long run
so if its ok with you
lets just drop the charade
ok i surrender
but i still need more data on you
do you play squash
married
divorced
children
no
dog
yes
still in amsterdam
in quarantine
ill fly down to get him tomorrow
the gps business is a tough one
your back
oh thats from the army
i enrolled when i was 18
after a few years i entered
an elite unit which specialised
in what
tracking
tracking of
people
missing people fugitives
and the technology came from hote
exactly
they produced
microscopic transmitters
i hadl improvement suggestions
so they recruited me
where did you get those scars
bolivia
were you tortured
i was lucky i got out in time
sounds like something from a film
no youve never seen this on film
when can we meet with pathfinder

this film just started
no i
im totally beat
im going to bed
ok
we developed this gel containing
hundreds of transmitters per millilitre
it adlheres to all materials
and is impossible to remove
you mean trace
the disadvantage is that trace
is hypersensitive to dirt and mud
i know this from my experience
as a soldier
when youre stuck in pardon
my french the arsehole of the world
then you are dependent
on your equipment
being introduced by brown
is of great significance
his recommendations are vital
just a moment
great meeting thanks a lot
thank you so much
when will you write
the recommendation
we have to make a decision first
what was that
there are other candidates
we have to consider the total picture
did we attend the same meeting
they were readly to sign the contract
here and now
well then your chances are good
hi

the painting has to be traded for money
as quickly as possible

by the roadside
if you touch the tractor
i want compensation
what a rush of people today
im just visiting roger brown
that businessman
yes
what do you want from him
we have an appointment
its none of my business but
he probably didnt invite you
for coffee and cakes in the cabin
in the cabin
and since its my property maybe
a slight compensation would be fair
search
hello
who are you
oh shit
youre not supposed to be out of bed
did anyone ask for me
no get back to bed
except for the police
theyre waiting for you in the corridor
i told them you should
have your breakfast first

aas neighbour found you

hundreds of transmitters per millilitre
it adheres to all materials
and is impossible to remove

they worked on this for months ever
since pathfinder sought a new ceo

clas

what
they have
massive economic problems
amtech demands that hote provide
them with pathfinders technology
this was class assignment
are you all insane
i was to get to know you
then introduce you to him
but he had to change plans since
you didnt want to see me anymore
he had to find a way to meet you
his grandmother had an
old reproduction of a rubens painting
he made up a wild story that she had
gotten it from a german officer
he told diana the story
and she believed him
then he met you
the only thing ive done
is to rub transmitters into your hair
did you do that
did you smear that shit
into my hair
is diana involved
i think so
you think so
i didnt want this to happen
i just want to get away from him
please help me
may i have a glass of water
lotte
the suspect dlied in the accident
with three of the four policemen
the last police officer is still missing
military divers are now searching
along the river
diana
roger
what happened to you
dont look at me that way
i know why you left theres
nothing more between clas and me
i tried to tell you in the garage
but i couldnt
what do you know about
i have to tell you this now
i didnt want it to happen
but you hurt me
he was so easy to talk to
and i just
i couldnt stand it anymore
but it was wrong
and im so ashamed
because you are the one i want
if you really think we shouldnt
have children we dont need to
im willing to do anything
you really do love me
you must never doubt that
promise me
and you didnt know anything
about what
you didnt know anything
oh my god
what has happened
come here
dog bites are very serious roger
you have to see a doctor
its not that convenient right now
hold this
what are you planning to do
i dont know
theyll soon find out
who died in the accident
i have to remove evidence
and then
i have to get away from here
make a new start
maybe you and i could
i can wait a while
before i report it stolen
i have to clean these too
did you love her
no
how could you be
so goddamn stupid
steal works of art
to buy things i dont need
who do you think i am
you have asked me
what im scared of
and ive been scared
since i first met you
ive been scared
that you would leave me
scared that we would have a child
which you would love more than me
and ive been scared
that you would see me as i really am
and hate it
i have to meet you diana
im sorry about this greve
its quite alright
roger brown is on
an unexpected journey abroad
sounds exciting
to save an important contract
but youre in safe hands now
there are only formalities left
so it wont take very long
we were supposed
to change a fan at b4
weve been in and out the whole day
but this card doesnt work
forensic institute
thank you
hello guys
sorry were a bit behind here
a lady just got in whos been lying dead
on heating cables for two weeks
any thoughts on this
typical car accident injuries
the cause of death
is internal haemorrhages
where are the peanuts
it says here there was a bag of peanuts
well i didnt eat them
has anyone unauthorised been here
to steal a bag of peanuts
whos that
what the hell
is going on here roger
are you removing evidence
think youll get out of this
what the hell
so you realised
the transmitters were in your hair
and that it was lotte
thats why you killed her
does it feel like a loss
ill give you a choice
if you tell me whats going on
ill shoot you in the head
if not a bullet in your stomach
dont you feel anything
i would like to know
if people like you really exist
people like me
people who are not capable of love
who are without empathy
empathy
yes
if you want the answer
just look in the mirror
im not like you
youre not
no
i have lovedl someone
you have loved someone diana
you have loved her
im afraid i have bad news for you
she tells me she longs for me
she wants me
and im only human
have you ever loved anyone
except for your dead dog
i have no time for this ive got
an appointment with diana tonight
you went and got the hair
you knew id be coming for you why
a shot in the stomach means
a slow death youll beg me to kill you
so i ask you for the last time
why am i here
what are you smiling at
why am i here
hold it right there
do you know
why i was smiling clas
because you just proved
that diana loves me
she didnt come to you
because she wanted you
she came to change the cartridges
in your pistol
she exchanged the bullets in your gun
for blank cartridges
or what do you call them in danish
blanks
what are you talking about
she hates you
she wants you to die
but i will give you one chance
i have no idea how many bullets
diana managed to switch
this is not like you clas
is it over
yes
i may not know myself but i know
others and thats what i gambled on
welcome to this press conference
led by the oslo police and kripos
i had prepared well
the police would find the pistol
from the crash on kjikeruds night table
this pistol also killed lotte madsen
whom the press called greves lover
how the art burglars ove kjikerud
and clas greve killed each other
was watched by a whole world
on the internet
the police would find
that the pistol greve fired
was identical to the one
that killed ove
he should never
have picked up that gun
we are pleased to present
a breakthrough in the case
but even though
i had done everything right
there was one thing
i could not change
ove was already dead
when i shot greve
but brede sperre is norways
most renowned investigator
unsolved cases is not his style
especially after vg called him
the man who makes norway
sleep well at night
because he is competent
obviously
but mainly because he knows
what it takes to get ahead in this world
and what would that be
the answer starts with an r
reputation
it gets you on tv and providles you
with smses from unknown women
we think they celebrated the theft
and that it got out of control
they end up torturing a dog
and killing the farmer
thats correct
for sale
have a nice day
both of you
we are ready
send in the candidate in one minute
ferdinand thank you
hi im sorry please sit down
i asked you to come here
because we are at the end of
a long and dramatic hunt
for pathfinders new leader
in the last round
he could not leave his position
without promising too much
i think i have persuaded him
please welcome jeremias lander
