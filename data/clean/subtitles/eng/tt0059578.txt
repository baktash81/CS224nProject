in the territory
well mr mortimer
i want to assure you our bank here
has everything
all the safeguards youre looking for
i dont doubt that but i have
a large sum to deposit
now suppose im a bandit
a bandit
a very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers
what would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob
in your case the one bank
i would suggest is the bank of el paso
not even indio would dare
to attack that one
its not a bank
its a fortress there
what times the next train
for el paso
1130 ill telegraph
to my colleague
in the bank of el paso
that youre going to arrive
thanks
hey mister captain

my name is fernando
the stable is right here
and that is your hotel
why this hotel
and not some other
you probably wouldnt like
that other place as much senor
youd have to spend half the night
shootin cockroaches
at this hotel the rooms
will cost you so much less
and theres a landlady
at this one senor
married
yes but she doesnt care
thats the bank as soon as i get
some money ill put it in
well youre gonna have
to earn it first
i have 50 cents here for you

thank you
watch this
hello my friends
hello indio
you see i didnt waste
a minute coming here
indio calls and groggy
comes running right away
and sancho
if youre waiting for sancho ill go
and come back in about four years
hes in prison for four years
bad for him
not so bad for the rest of us
a man who gets caught
doesnt deserve respect huh
whats it all about huh
now just listen
a bank at el paso
lets see
well say this is the inside
of the bank nino is the safe
which weighs three tons
and cant be opened with dynamite
theres the part with two cashiers
this is the managers desk
right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors
theres the main door and opposite
they built a double wall
what happens groggy
lets say youve already killed
the two cashiers and the manager
for the next few minutes
youre the boss of the bank
now what
the times been wasted
right a waste of time
especially groggy to blast open
that damn iron safe wed have
to be using so much dynamite
that the whole bank
would just disappear
and youd all go up with it
besides the presence of a safe alone
doesnt always signify
that there is money inside
to help you understand what i mean
i would like to relate
a nice little parable
once upon a time
there was a carpenter
you dont think a carpenter
can make money eh
no youre wrong
this one did well because
he was a builder of safes
there was a banker once
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised
to look like a wood cabinet
to get it made
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job and one day
as destiny has it
the carpenters in el paso
he happens to walk into the bank there
and what does he find
the cabinet
since hed worked on the cabinet
he spotted it right away
from that day on
he couldnt work anymore
pity because
there was something he had to do
there was this crazy idea
and it stayed
to put his hands on the money inside
get in there and grab all the money
sure you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank
it wasnt true
his good fortune stopped that day
because later
as a prisoner
he ran into me
the carpenter told me the story
and i tell you
the money isnt in the safe
its right in this
almost a million dollars in it
your colleague in tucumcari told me
that this bank
has the largest deposits
in the whole state
yes thats correct
mr mortimer
here at the bank at el paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand
i see you sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much
from the moment your moneys
on deposit here
you can sleep without any worries
besides
when the bank is closed
an armed guard always remains here
and a patrol
is on guard outside
even the bank of san francisco
isnt that well protected
exactly the truth is
to try robbing us
would be so futile
that only a complete fool
would attempt it
yeah
or a complete madman
get out of the way
get out of here
more news amigo
another stranger in town
yes and i know something else
there was another stranger
i didnt tell you about
listen to me
you sawedoff little runt
i want to know how many men
there are all together
well there were two
now theres two more
where
in the saloon
whiskey
listen mister why do you choose
my place to commit suicide
i know that man
its a miracle youre alive
why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted
its mighty strange
if the hunchback didnt shoot you
he had a very important reason
thats all
i was thinking that myself
1 2
3 now 4 now 5
11 12 13
14 15 16
17 18 19
20 21 22
23 24

27 28 29
30 31
32 and 33
all right now
i dont know him
come on now you know everybody
i dont know anybody anymore
im dead understand
well there was a time
when i knew everybody
that was a long time ago
when all this was prairie
in these days everybodys in a hurry
thats right
with your damned
goodfornothing trains
disgusting
one day someone from the railroad
comes here to see me
he says prophet the railways
gonna go right past your house
is that so i said
yep that right he says
all those trains
gonna go right past here
the best thing for you prophet
is sell your land to the company
or else well buy bakers
he lives next to your place
and ill put the tracks here
and thatll make you go crazy
will you sell out
to our company prophet
oh is that so says i
he was very anxious
for me to sell out
you know what i told him
about the railroad
you know what i told him
he could do with his railroad
you know what my decision
about selling was
well you said no
youre right about that
no to him and his damn trains
i wouldnt no
look listen to me old man
youre supposed to be a prophet
i didnt come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains
i want to find out about this man
its obvious you dont know anything
no need to be insulting
if thats all you came here to do
you can clear out of my house fast
before i lose my temper
understand
hey where you goin
i guess i better leave before
you go and lose your temper
whats the matter with you
why are you so dang stupid
hurry up
give me that pistol there
yeah right there behind ya
hurry
yes thats the one
now hand it over
thats it give me that gun
the man you asked about
theres only one question
how does he carry his gun
he wears it here
across his belly
well why didnt you tell me that
in the first place my boy
of course i know the man
youre trying to find out about
of course i know him
hes colonel douglas mortimer
mortimer a brave man a soldier
he was known as the best shot
in the carolinas
a great soldier
now hes reduced to being
a bounty killer same as you
because of trains
because of the damn trains
damn em
take it to the station
the gentlemans leavin
hold it
take it back
take it to the station
go inside
the station
just like the games we know
hes picking it up
a trick maybe
how can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this
that contraption
almost sent you to your grave
youre forgetting one thing colonel
i was shooting at your hat
well i was only shooting at yours
but i recall firing first
boy
ive reached almost 50 years
of age with my system
not many men last long
in these parts
how long do you expect to last
much longer than that
when i get my hands on indio
and that 10000
im gonna buy myself a little place
possibly retire
well i dont believe we ought
to start another fight
but you forget one small detail
whats that
i wanna get my hands on indio too
sure after me
or before you
or at the same time
is that a proposition
an equal partnership
why why should i
i can think of three reasons
first is theres 14 of them
yeah thats a lot
a lot for me
yeah no small number
even for two of us
second reason
second reason
the second reason is
you could make it 15 to one
dont forget i wanna play
in this game too
as youre aware when two hunters
go after the same prey
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back and we dont want that
then the colonel dies hmm
all right ill be generous
you can have the reward
for indio
and ill take the reward
for the rest of the band
all wrong
indios worth 10000 dollars but
the rest adds up to much more than that
blackies worth four
wilds worth three nino two
ninos one
well friscos worth two
thats ten thousand
yeah but
theres a few more thatll
add up to more than that im sure
how do you know that
i have my information
when alls said and done
i think i might just take you up
on your proposition
lets drink to this partnership
to the partnership
with no tricks of course
no tricks
now then
you realize were gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle
one from the outside one from
the inside theres no other way
one of us will have to
join indios band
why are you looking at me
when you say one of us
because they dont know you
wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire
tell me
how do you propose that i
join up with indio
maybe bring him
a bunch of roses
you could do that but id suggest
you take him sancho perez
whos sancho perez
a friend of indios
right now hes cooling off
hes cooling off
in alamogourdo jail
how do you know all this
ive got my information too
naturally youll have to arrange
for his uh release
naturally
tell me
were you ever young
and just as reckless as you
then one day something happened
made life very precious to me
whats that
or is the question indiscreet
the question isnt indiscreet
but the answer could be
they told me you were put away youd be
resting for four long years in prison
no indio for four weeks
no more than four weeks
who is that with you
he got me out
the mans a friend of mine
why did he help you
did you ask him that
yeah amigo why did you
help me out
well theres such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen
that i thought i might just tag along
on your next robbery
i might just turn you
into the law
amigo
thats the one answer
that would prove youre all right
and you arrived just in time too
the job is already set
its tomorrow
the place is
the bank in el paso
not far from el paso
theres a little town santa cruz
tomorrow blackie chico
paco
and you amigo
will rob the bank in santa cruz
shoot kill get every gun
in the area after you
especially those from el paso
any others around
well take care of them
and then after the job
well all meet again at las palmeras
where are you going
well if theres gonna be
any shooting
i gotta get my rest
hey amigo you know when you told
that story yesterday i fell for it
big joke wasnt it amigo
who said i was jokin
i dont get that
if its true
too bad you have to die
what is it
by now they should be
at santa cruz
listen shorty
indio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town
now why dont you just sit down
and send out the alarm to el paso
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn em right
but mister i didnt hear any shots
at the bank and i sure would have
you might hear one
the alarm
easy now
theyve robbed the bank
at santa cruz
follow me
groggy the telegraph wires
good day gentlemen
good day sir
sir
good afternoon
the other side
eleven
twelve
fourteen
lets go
what are you doin here
youre not runnin away are you
no im not running away
im going after them and im going
alone our partnership is dissolved
boy lets wait
and talk it over
all weve done is talk
ive been reasonable with no results
now take it easy we only knew
the santa cruz part of this plan
you were the one who had
their strategy all worked out
now im gonna meet indio
i see i better go along
im going alone me
i have an appointment with indio
and im not gonna let anyone interfere
you certain about that
thats right
in that case im sorry
thats not bad indio sent
four men to santa cruz
and one man returns
a new man without a scratch
mmmm indios no idiot
when you ride up to him and show him
that little nick he might believe you
and dont forget
that as of today
the whole gangs worth
40000 more
thats the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back
is the partnership operating again
just how do you figure
try to convince indio to go north
and then go along the rio bravo
its a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires
you on the outside
me on the inside right
north
north
hughie
wait a minute we need time to open it
and this isnt the right place
and the others
dead
after santa cruz we headed for el paso
and they hit us from all sides
and you just saved your own skin
isnt that right you yellow
you did your part of it
lets go
which way we headed
north
north along rio bravo canyon
why not
seems like a good place
for an ambush to me
you know a better way to go
yeah south
ride to the border
theyll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarms been sent
think well head east
theres a place i know about
agua caliente
here we are
thats agua caliente
yes i have many friends here
it looks just like a morgue
but look out
it could be one so easily
they dont like strangers
no they dont like anybody
wild you never saw
our friend here shoot right
did any of you
we dont know how youd be
in emergencies
i was thinking
this is the right place
i got a way
you can show the men
hows that
go into town alone amigo
bravo
do you mind tellin me
how you got here
i just reasoned it out
i figured youd tell indio
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed
and hes suspicious enough
to figure out somethin else
since el paso was out of the question
well here i am
rum a double
tequila for all of us
if it isnt the smoker
remember me amigo
of course you do el paso
its a small world
yes and very very bad
now come on
you light another match
i generally smoke just after i eat
come back in ten minutes
ten minutes youll be smoking
in hell get up
stay calm
on your feet
cucillo
count to three
one
two
three
stop it
who are you
im the one who can open
the safe for you
what safe senor
the one from el paso
you got there ahead of me
however
however
open that safe and youre gonna
destroy half the bank notes
i can open it
without blowing it up
whatll it cost
five thousand
twos all ill pay you
five
keep your hands off it
its easy to steal
the trouble is in keeping the loot
take it out
now every man in new mexico
is after us
if they catch one of us with money
well all end up the same way
were going to wait here for an
entire month if i think its necessary
then everybody will get his share
and you will wait a month
to get your money
naturally
ill be in the tavern
the air around here stinks anyway
just like the food
but the month will go fast
right here
lets go
i was worried about you
all alone with uh
so many problems to solve
its all right here
go ahead
you shouldnt have shot
the apples off that tree
put it on
whats he doing now
this sheriff of el paso
right now lookin for the cash
that was in the bank
right
and suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside el paso
with lots of money on them
what will the sheriff think
well he
thats right
slim
what is it nino
a change of plans
indio wants you to
its not loaded
i think you should
get out fast now
heres your guns without bullets
listen dont you let indio
find you both around
i know you dont like questions
but why are you doing this
how long have you known
that moncos a bounty killer
i found out tonight why
i knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived
the other ones also
a bounty killer
so i have an idea
theyll be useful to us
well try it
those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun
so well let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle
but that wont
really matter to me
or you
because well be far away right
and well have all the money
go on
go on and wake cucillo
who did it
why dont you look
at the knife
its mine
then it shouldnt be there
should it
but i didnt kill him
i didnt do it
its difficult to prove that
i am innocent
one of your horses is outside
lets see if you can get to it
he just killed slim
and he he helped those
two bounty killers get away
i want them back
right now
what are you doing here
go and get them back
those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away
we cant let em go free
its done now
prepare to get out of here
here
hold it
not a bad idea
but im one thing
you forgot about
open it up now
all right come on now
open it
leave indio to me
all right
where in hell is it
ill kill em but ill rip
out their guts first
i have a plan
what
lets just wait
theyll be back here
and this way
therell be two of us
can they come back here
your men couldve killed them
who they
are you sure of that
that they havent
i thought something different
you made the boys ride on out to
make sure theyre both killed and fast
im not as dumb
as the rest of them
there was no help for it
go on
that watch
its been a long time
that i wanted to ask
i can see that it means
a lot to you
why
listen to me
this is colonel mortimer
douglas mortimer
does the name
mean anything to you
when the chimes end
pick up your gun
try and shoot me colonel
just try
very careless of you old man
try this
now we start
bravo
there seems to be
a family resemblance
here
naturally between
brother and sister
my gun
my boy
youve become rich

old man
no its all for you
i think you deserve it
what about our partnership
maybe next time
ten thousand twelve thousand
