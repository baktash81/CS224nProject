  carolina

   oh  but exactly

the largest and most secure bank 
 in the territory 
well  mr  mortimer  
 i want to assure you our bank here   
has everything    
 all the safeguards you re looking for 
i don t doubt that  but i have 
 a large sum to deposit 
now  suppose i m a bandit 
a bandit 
a very dangerous bandit 
 with a gang of killers 
what would be the most 
 impossible bank for me to rob 
in your case  the one bank 
 i would suggest is the bank of el paso 
not even indio would dare 
 to attack that one 
it s not a bank  
 it s a fortress there 
what time s the next train

yes  senor  what do you want 
i don t wear  em 
i m honored that you thought of me  
 thank you 
watch this 
hello  my friends 
hello  indio 
you see  i didn t waste 
 a minute coming here 
indio calls and groggy 
 comes running right away 
and sancho 
if you re waiting for sancho  i ll go 
 and come back in about four years 
he s in prison for four years 
bad for him  
 not so bad for the rest of us 
a man who gets caught 
 doesn t deserve respect  huh 
what s it all about  huh 
now just listen 
a bank at el paso 
let s see 
we ll say this is the inside 
 of the bank  nino is the safe 
which weighs three tons 
 and can t be opened with dynamite 
there s the part with two cashiers 
this is the manager s desk 
right in back is a fancy cabinet 
 containing bottles   
for offering drinks 
 to the rich depositors 
there s the main door  and opposite 
 they built a double wall 
what happens  groggy 
let s say you ve already killed 
 the two cashiers and the manager 
for the next few minutes  
 you re the boss of the bank 
now what 
the time s been wasted 
right  a waste of time  
 especially  groggy  to blast open   
that damn iron safe  we d have 
 to be using so much dynamite   
that the whole bank 
 would just disappear 
and you d all go up with it 
besides  the presence of a safe alone 
 doesn t always signify   
that there is money inside 
to help you understand what i mean   
i would like to relate 
 a nice little parable 
once upon a time 
 there was a carpenter 
you don t think a carpenter 
 can make money  eh 
no  you re wrong 
this one did well because 
 he was a builder of safes 
there was a banker once   
who decided he must have 
 his iron safe disguised   
to look like a wood cabinet 
to get it made   
the banker goes to our carpenter 
 for the job  and one day   
as destiny has it   
the carpenter s in el paso 
he happens to walk into the bank there  
 and what does he find 
the cabinet 
since he d worked on the cabinet  
 he spotted it right away 
from that day on  
 he couldn t work anymore 
pity  because   
there was something he had to do 
there was this crazy idea 
and it stayed   
to put his hands on the money inside 
get in there and grab all the money 
sure  you think that carpenter 
 was lucky the way things work out   
that he was lucky 
 to go in just that bank 
it wasn t true 
his good fortune stopped that day 
because later   
as a prisoner   
he ran into me 
the carpenter told me the story  
 and i tell you 
the money isn t in the safe  
 it s right in this 
almost a million dollars in it 
your colleague in tucumcari told me 
 that this bank   
has the largest deposits 
 in the whole state 
yes  that s correct  
 mr  mortimer 
here at the bank at el paso we have half 
 a million dollars in reserve on hand 
i see  you sure this bank 
 is secure enough to hold that much 
from the moment your money s 
 on deposit here   
you can sleep without any worries 
besides   
when the bank is closed  
 an armed guard always remains here   
and a patrol 
 is on guard outside 
even the bank of san francisco 
 isn t that well protected 
exactly  the truth is   
to try robbing us 
 would be so futile   
that only a complete fool 
 would attempt it 
yeah 
or a complete madman 
get out of the way  
 get out of here 
more news  amigo 
another stranger in town 
yes  and i know something else 
there was another stranger 
 i didn t tell you about 
listen to me  
 you sawed off little runt 
i want to know how many men 
 there are all together 
well  there were two  
 now there s two more 
where 
in the saloon 
whiskey 
listen  mister  why do you choose 
 my place to commit suicide 
i know that man  
 it s a miracle you re alive 
why should a man walk around with 
 a pistol and let himself be insulted 
it s mighty strange 
if the hunchback didn t shoot you   
he had a very important reason  
 that s all 
i was thinking that myself 
1  2   
3  now 4  now 5   
11  12  13   
14  15  16   
17  18  19   
20  21  22   
23  24   
25  26   
27  28  29   
30  31   
32 and 33 
all right  now 
i don t know him 
come on  now  you know everybody 
i don t know anybody anymore  
 i m dead  understand 
well  there was a time 
 when i knew everybody 
that was a long time ago 
 when all this was prairie 
in these days everybody s in a hurry  
 that s right   
with your damned 
 good for nothing trains 
disgusting 
one day  someone from the railroad 
 comes here to see me 
he says  prophet  the railway s 
 gonna go right past your house 
is that so  i said 
yep  that right  he says 
all those trains 
 gonna go right past here 
the best thing for you  prophet  
 is sell your land to the company   
or else we ll buy baker s 
he lives next to your place  
 and i ll put the tracks here   
and that ll make you go crazy 
will you sell out 
 to our company  prophet 
oh  is that so  says i 
he was very anxious 
 for me to sell out 
you know what i told him 
 about the railroad 
you know what i told him 
 he could do with his railroad 
you know what my decision 
 about selling was 
well  you said no 
you re right about that  
 no to him and his damn trains 
i wouldn t  no 
look  listen to me  old man 
you re supposed to be a prophet 
i didn t come here to listen to you 
 rattle on about trains 
i want to find out about this man  
 it s obvious you don t know anything 
no need to be insulting  
 if that s all you came here to do   
you can clear out of my house fast 
 before i lose my temper 
understand 
hey  where you goin  
i guess i better leave before 
 you go and lose your temper 
what s the matter with you  
 why are you so dang stupid 
hurry up  
 give me that pistol there 
yeah  right there behind ya 
hurry 
yes  that s the one  
 now  hand it over 
that s it  give me that gun  
 the man you asked about 
there s only one question  
 how does he carry his gun 
he wears it here  
 across his belly 
well  why didn t you tell me that 
 in the first place  my boy 
of course i know the man 
 you re trying to find out about 
of course i know him 
he s colonel douglas mortimer 
mortimer    a brave man  a soldier 
he was known as the best shot 
 in the carolinas 
a great soldier 
now he s reduced to being 
 a bounty killer  same as you 
because of trains 
because of the damn trains  
 damn  em 
take it to the station  
 the gentleman s leavin  
hold it 
take it back 
take it to the station 
  go inside  
   the station 
just like the games we know 
  he s picking it up  
   a trick  maybe 
how can somebody in my business 
 go around with a contraption like this 
that contraption   
almost sent you to your grave 
you re forgetting one thing  colonel    
 i was shooting at your hat 
well  i was only shooting at yours 
but i recall firing first 
boy   
i ve reached almost 50 years 
 of age with my system 
not many men last long 
 in these parts 
how long do you expect to last 
much longer than that 
when i get my hands on indio 
 and that  10 000   
i m gonna buy myself a little place  
 possibly retire 
well  i don t believe we ought 
 to start another fight 
but you forget one small detail 
what s that 
i wanna get my hands on indio too 
sure  after me 
or before you 
or at the same time 
is that a proposition 
an equal partnership 
why  why should i 
i can think of three reasons 
first is there s 14 of them 
yeah  that s a lot 
a lot for me 
yeah  no small number 
 even for two of us 
second reason 
second reason   
the second reason is 
 you could make it 15 to one 
don t forget i wanna play 
 in this game too 
as you re aware  when two hunters 
 go after the same prey   
they usually end up shooting each other 
 in the back  and we don t want that 
then the colonel dies  hmm 
all right  i ll be generous 
you can have the reward 
 for indio   
and i ll take the reward 
 for the rest of the band 
all wrong 
indio s worth  10 000 dollars  but 
 the rest adds up to much more than that 
blackie s worth four  
 wild s worth three  nino two 
nino s one 
well  frisco s worth two 
that s ten thousand 
yeah  but   
there s a few more that ll 
 add up to more than that  i m sure 
  how do you know that  
   i have my information 
when all s said and done   
i think i might just take you up 
 on your proposition 
let s drink to this partnership 
to the partnership  
 with no tricks  of course 
no tricks 
now  then   
you realize we re gonna have to figure 
 out some way to get them in the middle 
one from the outside  one from 
 the inside  there s no other way 
one of us will have to 
 join indio s band 
why are you looking at me 
 when you say one of us 
because they don t know you 
wild sees me and his hump 
 will catch on fire 
tell me   
how do you propose that i 
 join up with indio 
maybe bring him 
 a bunch of roses 
you could do that  but i d suggest 
 you take him sancho perez 
who s sancho perez 
a friend of indio s  
 right now he s cooling off 
he s cooling off 
 in alamogourdo jail 
how do you know all this 
i ve got my information too 
naturally  you ll have to arrange 
 for his  uh  release 
naturally 
tell me   
were you ever young 
and just as reckless as you 
then one day something happened 
made life very precious to me 
what s that 
or is the question indiscreet 
the question isn t indiscreet 
but the answer could be 
they told me you were put away  you d be 
 resting for four long years in prison 
no  indio  for four weeks  
 no more than four weeks 
who is that with you 
he got me out  
 the man s a friend of mine 
why did he help you  
 did you ask him that 
yeah  amigo  why did you 
 help me out 
well  there s such a big reward 
 being offered on all you gentlemen   
that i thought i might just tag along 
 on your next robbery 
i might just turn you 
 into the law 
amigo   
that s the one answer 
 that would prove you re all right 
and you arrived just in time too  
 the job is already set 
it s tomorrow 
the place is   
the bank in el paso 
not far from el paso 
 there s a little town  santa cruz 
tomorrow  blackie  chico  
 paco   
and you  amigo   
will rob the bank in santa cruz 
shoot  kill  get every gun 
 in the area after you   
especially those from el paso 
any others around  
 we ll take care of them 
and then after the job  
 we ll all meet again at las palmeras 
where are you going 
well  if there s gonna be 
 any shooting   
i gotta get my rest 
hey  amigo  you know when you told 
 that story yesterday  i fell for it 
big joke  wasn t it  amigo 
who said i was jokin  
i don t get that  
 if it s true   
too bad you have to die 
what is it 
by now they should be 
 at santa cruz 
listen  shorty   
indio and his band have just 
 robbed the bank here in town 
now why don t you just sit down 
 and send out the alarm to el paso   
and the rest of the towns around here 
 and warn  em  right 
but  mister  i didn t hear any shots 
 at the bank  and i sure would have 
you might hear one 
the alarm 
easy now 
they ve robbed the bank 
 at santa cruz 
follow me 
groggy  the telegraph wires 
  good day  gentlemen  
   good day  sir 
  sir  
   good afternoon 
the other side 
eleven   
twelve   
fourteen   
let s go 
what are you doin  here  
 you re not runnin  away  are you 
no  i m not running away 
i m going after them and i m going 
 alone  our partnership is dissolved 
boy  let s wait 
 and talk it over 
all we ve done is talk  
 i ve been reasonable with no results 
now take it easy  we only knew 
 the santa cruz part of this plan 
you were the one who had 
 their strategy all worked out 
  now i m gonna meet indio  
   i see  i better go along 
i m going alone    me 
i have an appointment with indio 
 and i m not gonna let anyone interfere 
  you certain about that  
   that s right 
in that case i m sorry 
that s not bad  indio sent 
 four men to santa cruz 
and one man returns    
 a new man without a scratch 
mm mm  indio s no idiot 
when you ride up to him and show him 
 that little nick  he might believe you 
and don t forget  
 that as of today   
the whole gang s worth 
  40 000 more 
that s the reward offered by the bank 
 to get the money back 
  is the partnership operating again  
   just how do you figure 
try to convince indio to go north  
 and then go along the rio bravo 
it s a good spot for an ambush 
 and we can get him between two fires 
you on the outside  
 me on the inside  right 
north 
north 
hughie 
wait a minute  we need time to open it 
 and this isn t the right place 
and the others 
dead 
after santa cruz  we headed for el paso 
 and they hit us from all sides 
and you just saved your own skin  
 isn t that right  you yellow   
you did your part of it  
 let s go 
which way we headed 
north 
north  along rio bravo canyon 
why not 
seems like a good place 
 for an ambush to me 
you know a better way to go 
yeah  south 
ride to the border 
they ll never expect you to cross the 
 border now that the alarm s been sent 
think we ll head east 
there s a place i know about  
 agua caliente 
here we are  
 that s agua caliente 
yes  i have many friends here 
it looks just like a morgue 
but look out 
it could be one so easily 
  they don t like strangers  
   no  they don t like anybody 
wild  you never saw 
 our friend here shoot  right 
did any of you 
we don t know how you d be 
 in emergencies 
i was thinking  
 this is the right place 
i got a way 
 you can show the men 
how s that 
go into town alone  amigo 
bravo 
do you mind tellin  me 
 how you got here 
i just reasoned it out 
i figured you d tell indio   
to do just exactly the opposite 
 of what we agreed   
and he s suspicious enough 
 to figure out somethin  else 
since el paso was out of the question  
 well  here i am 
rum    a double 
tequila for all of us 
if it isn t the smoker 
remember me  amigo 
of course you do  el paso 
it s a small world 
yes  and very  very bad 
now  come on  
 you light another match 
i generally smoke just after i eat  
 come back in ten minutes 
ten minutes you ll be smoking 
 in hell  get up 
stay calm 
on your feet 
cucillo 
count to three 
one   
two   
three 
stop it 
who are you 
i m the one who can open 
 the safe for you 
what safe  senor 
the one from el paso  
 you got there ahead of me 
  however    
   however 
open that safe and you re gonna 
 destroy half the bank notes 
i can open it 
 without blowing it up 
what ll it cost 
five thousand 
two s all i ll pay you 
five 
keep your hands off it 
it s easy to steal  
 the trouble is in keeping the loot 
take it out 
now every man in new mexico 
 is after us 
if they catch one of us with money 
 we ll all end up the same way 
we re going to wait here for an 
 entire month if i think it s necessary 
then everybody will get his share 
and you will wait a month 
 to get your money 
naturally 
i ll be in the tavern 
the air around here stinks anyway  
 just like the food 
but the month will go fast 
right here 
let s go 
i was worried about you 
all alone with  uh  
 so many problems to solve 
it s all right here 
go ahead 
you shouldn t have shot 
 the apples off that tree 
put it on 
what s he doing now  
 this sheriff of el paso 
right now  lookin  for the cash 
 that was in the bank 
right 
and suppose he finds the bodies 
 of these men just outside el paso   
with lots of money on them 
what will the sheriff think 
well  he   
that s right 
slim 
what is it  nino 
a change of plans 
indio wants you to   
it s not loaded 
i think you should 
 get out fast now 
here s your guns without bullets 
listen  don t you let indio 
 find you both around 
i know you don t like questions  
 but why are you doing this 
how long have you known 
 that monco s a bounty killer 
i found out tonight  why 
i knew he was one from 
 the first moment he arrived 
the other one s also 
 a bounty killer 
so i have an idea 
they ll be useful to us 
we ll try it 
those men are a lot better 
 than mine with a gun 
so we ll let all of them 
 get mixed up in a gun battle 
but that won t 
 really matter to me 
or you 
because we ll be far away  right 
and we ll have all the money 
go on 
go on and wake cucillo 
who did it 
why don t you look 
 at the knife 
it s mine 
then it shouldn t be there  
 should it 
but i didn t kill him  
 i didn t do it 
it s difficult to prove that 
i am innocent 
one of your horses is outside 
let s see if you can get to it 
he just killed slim 
and he    he helped those 
 two bounty killers get away 
i want them back   
right now 
what are you doing here 
go and get them back 
those two bounty killers are sitting on 
 our backs and must be killed right away 
we can t let  em go free 
it s done now 
prepare to get out of here 
here 
hold it 
not a bad idea 
but i m one thing 
 you forgot about 
open it up now 
all right  come on now  
 open it 
leave indio to me 
all right 
where in hell is it 
i ll kill  em  but i ll rip 
 out their guts first 
i have a plan 
what 
let s just wait 
they ll be back here 
and this way  
 there ll be two of us 
can they come back here  
 your men could ve killed them 
who  they 
are you sure of that  
 that they haven t 
i thought something different

 mean anything to you

 a family resemblance
