you could paint like your husband
really you must be so proud of him
so elegant
yes theyre all vejle
where he grew up
now i dont say my client is the
best landscape artist in denmark
but he is in the top one
yes oh hello
its going very well
mmm yes hell be impossible
oh my
oh thank you
and rasmussen
oh come on be kind
at least he agreed to see your work
it was only because he was drunk
i know
yes you were loving it
i was not
i dont say my client is
the best landscape artist in denmark
but
hes in the top one
quiet people are sleeping
sorry
do you know what time it is
time you came back to bed
no
im ready to start work
gerda
what
your face
you think i cant resist you
do you want to resist me
no
but id like you to ask nicely
so i dont feel such a pushover
gerda wegener
my life
my wife
thorbjorn
mr wegener
tighter
perfect
yes more
einar wegener
oh dont worry about him
hes only ever had eyes for one woman
my guilty secrets out
so
when are you two
going to brood me a godchild huh
ulla youre an atheist
have you tried drinking raw eggs
no
do it for my sake
were trying
try harder
anyway
what are you doing in today
i thought you had finished last week
i wanted to check on the painting
of the backdrop for the storm scene
and give gerda some space
ah shes got a shy one
well you know im next
oh so i heard
i wont be shy
i should imagine not
shell need all her colors for me
mmmhmm
mmm
head up
i wanted to say
i appreciate our being alone today
i hope your husband doesnt mind
not at all
i could see his being here
made you uncomfortable
it wasnt personal
its not uncommon
ah
its hard for a man
to be looked at by a woman
women are used to it
of course but for a man to um
submit to a womans gaze
its unsettling
although i believe theres some pleasure
to be had from it once you um
yield
sit
good girl
morning
morning
well
perfect
almost
ah
good luck
toodleoo
all portraits
is that bad
not per se
this kind of work is not really my
gerda i dont think it would
benefit either of us to show these
its not a judgment on your abilities
i agree with einar
you could be a firstclass painter
if you found the right subject matter
how was it
fine
i finally managed
to get the color for the snow
a bog in vejle
i dont know how you can
paint the same thing over and over
i suppose i just havent
finished with it yet
gerda
could you please not speak
to rasmussen about me again
my work is my business
stay out of it
gerda
i have my period
sorry
are you
of course i am
i mean you know i am
could you help me with something
anything
ulla has an extra rehearsal
she canceled again
oh
would you try on her stockings and shoes
im just so behind i dont know how
ill be finished in time for her opening
yeah ill
ill do it
its fine ill do it
theyre there
hvappe no not now
he almost snagged it
hvappe
uh
thats backwards
i saw those in the window at fonnesbechs
hmm
smart arent they
i dont think theyll fit
well you do the best you can
no i need the dress
no
i need to see how the hem falls
no gerda im not putting it on
well i havent asked you to
just relax
the sooner i start
the sooner i finish
well hello there
oh dont worry my darling
were going to call you
lili
such concentration
sometimes i think youre going to slip
through the surface
of the painting and vanish
into the bog
like your friends kite
when you were a boy
hans
mmm
yes hans
i bet he still sits on that rock
sobbing his heart out
dont
hes actually an art dealer in paris
peddling old masters to rich americans
hmm
so we dont need to worry about hans
no we dont need to worry about hans
i didnt mean to disturb you
no its okay im finished
and dont worry i wont
disappear into the bog
the bogs in me silly
what
cant a man watch his wife get undressed
its new
thats very observant
oh no leave it on
its pretty
i might let you borrow it
i might enjoy that
is there something youd like to tell me
is there something youd like to know
no
im your wife
i know everything
those two over there
both of them
and at the same time
oh married people
are so delightfully easy to shock
we just pretend to be shocked
because it encourages you
i know
that is why youre the only married couple
in my party for the artists ball
no out of the question
she can go without me
gerda without an escort
why it would be a scandal
gerda loves a scandal
look at the way she dresses
flaunting her ankles
i dont think anyone is likely to
be corrupted by seeing my ankles
i was
it was the first time we met
i was leaving the academy
and she was sitting on the steps
flaunting said ankles
and she propositioned me
is that true
when i said hello to him
he actually blushed
he was so shy so i asked him out
and you said yes
well she made me
she seemed so sure
i was sure
i still am
please enough
no
what was it about him
i dont know
but we went for coffee and after
i kissed him
and it was the strangest thing
it was like kissing myself
these two wont be staying much longer
unmarried people
are so delightfully easy to shock
leave it
were you really corrupted by my ankles
you were shameless
i still am
beautiful
shameless gerda
wait
did i wake you
sorry
i couldnt sleep
why
wondering about things
what things
wondering if we made a baby last night
what do you think
wondering when you got so pretty
i was always pretty
but you just never noticed
hello
in here
these are good gerda
you think
mmm
well thank you
i had a coffee with ulla
hmm
she asked me about the artists ball
im not going
dont worry
i told her no
you should go you enjoy it
with you i enjoy it
its good to be seen at those things
i do understand that
and thats why you hate them
i feel as though im performing myself
giving them your einar wegener
mmmhmm
why not give them something different
go as someone else
do you have someone in particular in mind
no
youd be very convincing
that is outrageous
oh you might even enjoy it
no
youll have to shave closer next time
mmm mmm
close your eyes
this is hard on someone else
well let me try
what do you think
better than i ever manage
lili
i want to sketch you
sit
come on hvap come on you
lean to the side
knee over
head up oh
look at those hands relax
dont make her a slut
its your fault
you excite her
my miss lili
you are forward
you have no idea
maybe bring out the hand
morning
morning thorbjorn
good morning
forward
hello
i was wondering where you were
its getting late
we have plenty of time
i bought you these
ah
oh theyre perfect

ill never be as pretty as you
you are so beautiful

thats right
einars cousin from vejle
my dear
youre exquisite
in lets go in
come on
you wont leave me will you
no never
people are looking
well youre a pretty girl
youll have to get used to it
its fine
youre just feeling selfconscious
gerda
oh
go and talk to them
ill stay with you
no go ill be fine
please go before they come over
all right
whos that
are you a reporter
no
a poetess
do you know the story of this oak tree
no
they say that if you eat its acorns
you can make a wish
and become anyone you want for a day
why would they say that
henrik sandahl
at your disposal
lili
are you here with someone lili
yes my uh
my cousins wife
whos your cousin
einar wegener painter
yes hes rather a good one
hes better than most people think
is that right
most people our age at any rate
dont go back in there
its um its cooler out here
besides im a romantic
really
i prefer the shadows
and i dont mean to presume
but ive been watching you
and i think you might be the same
come on
have you seen einar i cant find him
of course you cant he isnt here
cheers
youre different from most girls
thats not a very original line
its true
youre oldfashioned
provincial
im new to the city
no its more than that
i feel id need to ask your permission
before i kissed you
i should go and find gerda
why dont you tell her ill walk you home
no she wouldnt like that
lili
no einar
he might be waiting for us
and he wouldnt like this
wouldnt he
no
lili
lili
lili
you didnt ask permission
i couldnt risk you saying no
whats the matter
im sorry
im sorry i dont know what happened
how are you
you were late home last night
so i thought id let you sleep
how was it
did lili have fun
i think it would be better
if lili didnt come here again
fine
exactly what happened
between you and sandahl last night
nothing it was nothing
did he know it was you
it wasnt as simple as that
i watched him kiss you einar
so could you please make an effort
he may have known who i was
but i wasnt always me
there was a moment when i was just lili
and i think that he could see that
do you see
but lili doesnt exist
we made her up
i know
we were playing a game
i know we were
but then
something changed
this is absurd we we need to stop
you need to stop einar
i am going to try
another headache
its nothing
can i get you anything
im fine
maybe you should see a doctor
gerda
im fine
i didnt think youd come
no
nor did i
i thought you might not come back
thats absurd
is it
come here
the model
einars cousin
the resemblance is
are there others
a series back at the studio
these are different
for these
i dont know there may be a market
youre taking them
well yes
come in
i havent got long
gerdas seeing rasmussen
i dont like all these lies
shes very protective
why dont you just tell her about us
i couldnt do that
sorry
i dont want to upset you
come here
no
yes
einar
what
come on shh its all right
im sorry i dont understand
i lili
please
i dont know what you want
i want you
i dont know what you mean
i want you
no
lili lili lili wait
are you all right
no
ive been seeing henrik sandahl
im
i thought perhaps you knew
no
not this
so
are you in love with sandahl
no
no i love you
gerda only you its lili she
be honest
i need you to believe me gerda
you of all people to understand
all right
you need to tell me when henrik and
lili
are together they what they
they kiss
has it gone beyond that
no
no lili has never gone
further than that with a man
she wouldnt shes
there have been other men
wait there
there was another yes
but it was a long time ago
it was that boy hans
in vejle
she fell for him and
he kissed her just once
but then my father came in
and he caught them
and he smacked hans down
he was so angry
i dont know what to say
what
im so
einar
im so sorry
im so sorry im not feeling well
einar what is it
einar einar einar
einar whats happened whats happening
im all right im all right
what do you have pain
so you saw dr andersen
after a bout of severe nosebleeds
which you have come to believe
coincide with the stomach cramps
and on a monthly basis
hmm
so
how long have you been married
six years
children
no
is there regular copulation
yes
perhaps less now than before
than before you started
to dress as a woman
im a specialist mr wegener
you may be embarrassed
i am not
tell me about lili
where does she come from
inside me
you know the most likely explanation
for all of this is a chemical imbalance
really
mmm
onto the bed
that would explain the pain
the confused state of masculinity
and the infertility
lets hope it is that
because that at least we can cure
i dont need to do this
theres nothing wrong with me
thats not true
gerda this cant be right
radiation is a miracle mr wegener
it destroys the bad and saves the good
im sure itll be over quickly
lie still mr wegener
mr wegener
how are you feeling this morning
you hurt lili
im afraid your husbands
aberrant thinking persists
do you keep a lock on your wardrobe
of course not
mrs wegener
youre not encouraging this delusion
you do understand that
your husband is insane
no thats not true
we trusted you we came to you for help
gerda
where have you been
away
why whats wrong
i sold the lili portraits
i have enough interest now
to mount a full show
thats wonderful
and theres more
the gallery etienne dufour in paris
wants to represent you
in paris
yes you must go
i cant travel just now
gerda this is your moment
youve waited long enough
these art dealers can be fickle
oh
what are you doing
ive been asked to exhibit in paris
thats wonderful
yes
we have to go
rasmussen said it would
make all the difference
gerda im not sure that i can
ill take care of you
yes but surely theres no rush
cant you just do this one thing for me
whats happening
i had a letter from hexler
he wants to lock me up
everything will work out for us
really i know it
you just have to trust me
i do
einars a painter too
oh do you exhibit in paris
i think my works a little introspective
for french taste
excuse me is the model here
no
she stayed behind in denmark
oh i was so hoping to meet her
madame gerda wegener
no no
im sorry
will you sit for me
just as you are
we havent done that since art school
the teacher
suddenly at the mercy of the student
you found it exciting
i cant just now
im sorry
i miss you
i miss you working beside me
i cant remember the landscape anymore
i cant remember vejle
well you can help me with this background
what does it need a kettlehole lake
a farmhouse far off
gerda
merci
well hes playing with us
he knows the price
look i have to go
i have some danish girl waiting to see me
all right
madame
hans axgil
hello thank you for seeing me
dont thank me yet i cant represent you
i dont handle any contemporary art
of course i know that
the reviews for your show
were terrific but
perhaps if you would let me speak
things would be clearer
so when did you arrive
six months almost
i dont know
why rasmussen gave you my number
but im happy he did
i asked him
i wanted to meet you to
put a face to a name
hmm
i believe you were
a childhood friend of my husband
you have a husband
im married to einar wegener
einar
you remember him
of course i remember him
we were such friends how is he
he told me that you kissed him once
i what
youre right
youre right i remember
we were fooling in the kitchen
and he was wearing
his grandmothers apron
you know little boys playing around
he just looked so pretty in it
i had to kiss him
so yes i kissed einar
the next thing i know
his fathers chasing me out
einar my god
why didnt he come today
he doesnt know im here
i dont think hed like me asking for help
we dont really know people here
and einar is hes
hes lost his way
hes not working
he needs someone to represent him
someone who knows him
he needs a friend
i have a new dealer
coming over later
id like you to meet him
i dont want a new dealer
it doesnt make sense to me
im hardly working
that might change
i dont think so
im happy helping you
its hans axgil
dinner at la dauphine at 800
then back here to see the paintings
he remembers you with great fondness
it was handmade
and ive had it since i was four
you know einars still stricken with guilt
about crashing your kite
my kite ill tease him about that
no its too cruel
well if he ever gets here
perhaps he doesnt want to see me
no no its not that
maybe we should order without him
does he abandon you often
of course not
i was joking
i can come back another time
if you think einar would prefer it
really
hes expecting you
and itll do him good
i know this
the fjord at vejle
not far from our houses
yes he painted it just before we left
lili
hans
may i introduce
lili wegener
einars cousin from home
you cannot imagine how happy i am
we actually met once before in vejle
but you probably dont remember
may i take your coat
of course
a digestif hans
its so chilly all of a sudden
i feel the cold these days
i dont know why
here
thank you
im so sorry that einar couldnt be here
he told me how back in vejle
you were his great friend
both always plotting to get away
thats true
such a tedious place
he said that you would sit
and youd look out together
beyond the fjord to the sea
to the future
we had big dreams yes
yes
and that you were the only one
that would let him paint in peace
who told him it was all
right to be a painter
he used to sketch my portrait
take a stone and draw me on the rocks
at the side of the road
i didnt know that
yes
would you like to see more of einars work
yes
but do we have any
of course lili
could we not do it another time
because i just
i want to hear more about you hans
are you married
uh no
well why not
you dont mind do you
ive been on my own a long time now
im too set in my ways
i think that marriage is the single thing
we should all hope for in life
really
it creates someone else
more than just the two of you
yes i think itd be terrible not to
i think itd be terrible im so
will you excuse me
lili
you ought to go
let me help
please
im sorry
good night lili
good night
i dont think he noticed do you
i dont know
i think i got out just in time
sleep now
well talk more tomorrow

no weve never done that
lilis never spent the night
it doesnt matter what i wear
cause when i dream
theyre lilis dreams
what
a new dress
and this is for you
do you like it
yes
its perfect for you
were a little short of
money at the moment

thats a shame
for you i mean
i dont mind

hes excited
our friend uh is coming to town
ulla fonsmarck the dancer

oh no im fine honestly
well if you just wait a minute
someone will drive you
no im fine
my goodness youre soaked
did it go well
tell me how was it
youd know if youd been there
ive made us a supper
you should have come
a little sort of celebration
this is not how it goes
we do these things together
that was you and einar
stop playing that stupid stupid game
please gerda
dont you think this is a game
you should have been there
how could i
look at me
not everything is about you
i need to see einar
let me help please
i need my husband
go get him
i cant
i need to talk to my husband
i need to hold my husband
i need him
cant you just get him
can you at least try
no im sorry
gerda
what is it
are you all right
oh my god
gerda wait
wait
i dont think i can
give you what you want
i dont know how long
we can go on like this
no
he needs to see someone
you know what happened with hexler
but hes so thin
somethings wrong with him
lili watches her figure
look
theres a doctor
he runs the womens clinic in dresden
hes interested in men like einar
who are
confused
men who are different
hes often in paris
just talk to him
youre awake
how do you feel
come
listen ive got somewhere to go
where
sorry i
i dont know
how to hold on to you any longer
i know
but i love you
and im going to find an answer
english
english
do you speak english
are you um a boy or a girl
a woman
do you have a
or
joking
i cant hold the buyers much longer
im sorry
einar
youre good at this
i boxed for a while
shame you werent with me earlier
im sorry ive not been to see you before
thats all right
youre here now
i couldnt let gerda see me like this
shes had enough to put up with
whats happened to you
i dont understand
nor do i
but i dont think its anything new
even back in vejle
what
ow sorry
what
i was different
it didnt take much to
be different in vejle
surely thats why we became friends
every morning
i promise myself
that i will spend the entire day as einar
but theres so little of einar left
you think these things
because youre exhausted
sometimes i think about killing einar
but its only the thought
that id be killing lili too that stops me
you need to see someone
a doctor
no
yes
no doctors
ill help you find someone
you have to try
a confused state of identity
i drill small holes
here and here
i have listened to you very carefully
and im afraid its not good news
youre a homosexual
well i dont really know
what kind of help i need but i
i cant go on living
without knowing who i am
please excuse me for a moment
do you think im insane
did a doctor say that
im sorry i know we agreed no more but
look at me
you are not insane
did i do this to you
what
sometimes i i wonder
if it hadnt been for the paintings
no gerda no
you helped bring lili to life
but she was always there
she was always waiting
now shes making you ill
i dont know what to do
the doctors cant help me
do you want to try one more
warnekros einar my husband
hello
good to see you
so what do you think would explain
what youve been experiencing
mr wegener
professor warnekros the fact is
i believe that i am a woman
inside
and i believe it too
you probably think that im insane
or that we both are
well
there are people who think that im insane
but i think youre probably right
ive met another man like you
i pursued his case
against the wishes of my colleagues
of course
i told him i could operate
to make him fully a woman
that was what he wanted
is that really possible
what happened to the man
was the operation successful
on the morning of the first operation
he ran away
he was too frightened
i wouldnt do that i
perhaps he was the smart one
the surgery has never
been attempted before
never
professor warnekros what is the surgery
two operations
the first
to remove the male parts entirely
the second
once youre strong enough again
to construct a vagina
an irreversible change
and a high risk of failure
infections
complications
its too dangerous
its my only hope
i leave for dresden at lunchtime tomorrow
mrs wegener
i do believe i can help your husband
but he wont be your husband
when ive finished
i feel strange going dressed like this
its important
hans said
the germans might check your papers
youre nearly there
i wont be seeing you again
ive only really liked
a handful of people in my life
and youve been two of them
take care
take care
i wish youd let me come with you
i cant
you love einar
and i have to let him go
here
take this
hello
um my name is lili
im here to see professor warnekros
lili what
elbe
lili elbe like the river
of course please take a seat over there
must i really wait
its only a week
i need you to rest gain some weight
we cant risk an infection
for what we are attempting
ill need you to be strong
this is not my body professor
please take it away
youre having a baby
and you
oh no no im
im ill inside
but professor warnekros
is going to make me better
and will you be able to
have children after
do you know i dont know
i hope so
gerda why dont you go
he asked me not to
he wanted to protect you
you should be there ill go with you
if i go it will be alone
now youre sounding like einar
i am like einar
what do you want me to do
i want you to go away
really
no i sorry
she regained
consciousness very briefly
were having to give her
a great deal of morphine of course
so thats to be expected
you mustnt move lili
it only makes it worse
oh god
breathe
breathe
breathe
im here
its all right
im here now
lili
i can feel myself getting better
when i listen to your pencil
youve always sketched
me better than i was
but what you draw i become
you made me beautiful
and now youre making me strong
such power in you
shall we go back to denmark then gerda
shall we go home
lili
youre late
and your pills
every two hours
and i need to eat something first
i have some macaroons in my bag all ready
and these
only if you need them
good luck
and remember
making a purchase at fonnesbechs
is not merely shopping
its an experience
you lived in paris yes
yes
let everyone know
the store is a stage
were here to perform
in paris you see a lady would never dream
of spraying the scent directly onto herself
she she would spray it in the air
and then shed walk through it
oh
voila
you try
ah voila
thanks
thats so unfair
youve got the sweetest tooth
and the narrowest hips in the whole store
how do you manage it
eating so much sugar
the trick is you eat nothing else
see you tomorrow
see you tomorrow
bye lili
bye
lili are you coming
you know one night last week
i had the strangest dream
what was it
i dreamed you were getting married
do you think i ever will
who knows
so many strange things have happened
i do want to gerda
its not so long ago we were married
you and me
you and einar
i know it was einar
but really
it was you and me
lili
is it really you
i believe so
so what youre suggesting
is that uh a doctor
intervened
to correct a mistake in nature
he made you a woman
no god made me a woman
but the doctor he the doctor
is curing me of the sickness
that was my disguise
a real woman
youre going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like that
when warnekros suggested i keep a diary
i thought id never have anything to write
it does help
just to make sense of things
maybe i should try it
so
do you enjoy working at fonnesbechs
for now at least
i do enjoy sort of being part of it
you never think of painting
you might be good at it
gerda i want to be a woman not a painter
well people have been known to do both
im curious to see what you would paint
thats all sometimes its
hard to know whats in your
didnt you just take one of those
a minute ago
gerda i know what im doing
im just going to get some fresh air
you know sometimes i do wonder
why you let me go through all this
if you thought that
everything would be the same afterwards
i didnt
but i promised einar
that i would take care of you
for goodness sakes gerda einar is dead
we both have to accept that
you took care of me
but now i have to take care of myself
i have to have a life of my own
and you need to do the same
come on hvap
uh yes
in london
uh is it urgent
no thats fine
just tell him
just say its a beautiful
day in copenhagen
morning
good morning
its not what you think
henriks homosexual
theres nothing between us
i should have told you that id seen him
no you shouldnt
hes a friend gerdie someone to talk to
because you cant talk to me
ive made a decision
im going back to dresden
for the second operation
thats too soon
no no its time
i need to finish what i started
youre not strong enough
professor warnekros thinks that i am
warnekros
warnekros hasnt seen you
ive made up my mind gerda
