you could paint like your husband 
really  you must be so proud of him 
so elegant 
yes  they re all vejle 
where he grew up 
now  i don t say my client is the
best landscape artist in denmark 
but he is in the top one 
yes  oh  hello 
it s going very well 
mmm  yes  he ll be impossible 
oh  my 
oh  thank you 
and rasmussen 
oh  come on  be kind 
at least he agreed to see your work 
it was only because he was drunk 
i know 
yes  you were loving it 
i was not 
 i don t say my client is
the best landscape artist in denmark    
but   
 he s in the top one  
quiet  people are sleeping 
sorry 
do you know what time it is 
time you came back to bed 
no 
i m ready to start work 
  gerda 
  what 
your face 
you think i can t resist you 
do you want to resist me 
no 
but i d like you to ask nicely 
so i don t feel such a pushover 
gerda wegener 
my life 
my wife 
thorbjorn 
mr  wegener 
tighter 
perfect 
yes  more 
einar wegener 
oh  don t worry about him 
he s only ever had eyes for one woman 
my guilty secret s out 
so 
when are you two
going to brood me a godchild  huh 
ulla  you re an atheist 
have you tried drinking raw eggs 
  no 
  do it  for my sake 
  we re trying 
  try harder 
anyway   
what are you doing in today 
i thought you had finished last week 
i wanted to check on the painting
of the backdrop for the storm scene 
and give gerda some space 
ah  she s got a shy one 
well  you know i m next 
oh    so i heard 
i won t be shy 
i should imagine not 
she ll need all her colors for me 
mmm hmm 
mmm 
head up 
i wanted to say
i appreciate our being alone today 
i hope your husband doesn t mind 
not at all 
i could see his being here
made you uncomfortable 
it wasn t personal 
it s not uncommon 
ah 
it s hard for a man
to be looked at by a woman 
women are used to it 
of course  but for a man to  um 
submit to a woman s gaze 
it s unsettling 
although i believe there s some pleasure
to be had from it  once you  um 
yield 
sit 
good girl 
  morning 
  morning 
well 
perfect 
almost 
ah 
good luck 
toodle oo 
all portraits 
is that bad 
not per se 
this kind of work is not really my   
gerda  i don t think it would
benefit either of us to show these 
it s not a judgment on your abilities 
i agree with einar 
you could be a first class painter
if you found the right subject matter 
how was it 
fine 
i finally managed
to get the color for the snow 
a bog in vejle 
i don t know how you can
paint the same thing over and over 
i suppose i just haven t
finished with it yet 
gerda 
could you please not speak
to rasmussen about me again 
my work is my business 
  stay out of it 
  gerda 
i have my period 
sorry 
  are you 
  of course i am 
i mean  you know i am 
could you help me with something 
anything 
ulla has an extra rehearsal 
she canceled again 
oh 
would you try on her stockings and shoes 
i m just so behind  i don t know how
i ll be finished in time for her opening 
yeah  i ll   
i ll do it 
it s fine  i ll do it 
they re there 
hvappe  no  not now 
he almost snagged it 
hvappe 
uh   
that s backwards 
i saw those in the window at fonnesbech s 
hmm 
smart  aren t they 
i don t think they ll fit 
well  you do the best you can 
  no  i need the dress 
  no 
i need to see how the hem falls 
no  gerda  i m not putting it on 
well  i haven t asked you to 
just relax 
the sooner i start 
the sooner i finish 
well  hello  there 
oh  don t worry  my darling 
we re going to call you
lili 
such concentration 
sometimes i think you re going to slip
through the surface
of the painting and vanish 
into the bog 
like your friend s kite
when you were a boy 
  hans 
  mmm 
yes  hans 
i bet he still sits on that rock 
sobbing his heart out 
don t 
he s actually an art dealer in paris 
  peddling old masters to rich americans 
  hmm 
so we don t need to worry about hans 
no  we don t need to worry about hans 
i didn t mean to disturb you 
no  it s okay  i m finished 
and don t worry  i won t
disappear into the bog 
the bog s in me  silly 
what 
can t a man watch his wife get undressed 
it s new 
that s very observant 
oh  no  leave it on 
it s pretty 
i might let you borrow it 
i might enjoy that 
is there something you d like to tell me 
is there something you d like to know 
no 
i m your wife 
i know everything 
those two  over there 
both of them 
and at the same time 
oh  married people
are so delightfully easy to shock 
we just pretend to be shocked
because it encourages you 
i know 
that is why you re the only married couple
in my party for the artists  ball 
no  out of the question 
she can go without me 
gerda without an escort 
why  it would be a scandal 
gerda loves a scandal 
look at the way she dresses 
flaunting her ankles 
i don t think anyone is likely to
be corrupted by seeing my ankles 
i was 
it was the first time we met 
i was leaving the academy
and she was sitting on the steps 
flaunting said ankles 
and she propositioned me 
is that true 
when i said hello to him 
he actually blushed 
he was so shy  so i asked him out 
and you said yes 
well  she made me 
she seemed so sure 
i was sure 
i still am 
  please  enough 
  no 
what was it about him 
i don t know 
but we went for coffee  and after 
i kissed him 
and it was the strangest thing 
it was like kissing myself 
these two won t be staying much longer 
unmarried people
are so delightfully easy to shock 
leave it 
were you really corrupted by my ankles 
you were shameless 
i still am 
beautiful 
shameless gerda 
wait 
did i wake you 
sorry 
i couldn t sleep 
why 
wondering about things 
what things 
wondering if we made a baby last night 
what do you think 
wondering when you got so pretty 
i was always pretty 
but you just never noticed 
  hello 
  in here 
these are good  gerda 
  you think 
  mmm 
well  thank you 
i had a coffee with ulla 
  hmm 
  she asked me about the artists  ball 
i m not going 
don t worry 
i told her no 
you should go  you enjoy it 
with you  i enjoy it 
it s good to be seen at those things 
i do understand that 
and that s why you hate them 
i feel as though i m performing myself 
giving them your einar wegener 
mmm hmm 
why not give them something different 
go as someone else 
do you have someone in particular in mind 
no 
you d be very convincing 
that is outrageous 
oh  you might even enjoy it 
no 
you ll have to shave closer next time 
mmm  mmm 
close your eyes 
this is hard on someone else 
well  let me try 
what do you think 
better than i ever manage 
lili 
i want to sketch you 
sit 
come on  hvap  come on  you 
lean to the side 
knee over 
head up  oh 
look at those hands  relax 
don t make her a slut 
it s your fault 
you excite her 
my  miss lili 
you are forward 
you have no idea 
maybe bring out the hand 
morning 
morning  thorbjorn 
good morning 
forward 
hello 
i was wondering where you were 
it s getting late 
we have plenty of time 
i bought you these 
ah 
oh  they re perfect 
are you sure about tonight 
what is it 
am i pretty enough 
of course you are 
i ll never be as pretty as you 
you are so beautiful 
my darling 
ulla  let me introduce   
it s lili 
that s right 
einar s cousin from vejle 
my dear 
you re exquisite 
in  let s go in 
come on 
you won t leave me  will you 
no  never 
people are looking 
well  you re a pretty girl 
you ll have to get used to it 
it s fine 
you re just feeling self conscious 
gerda 
oh   
go and talk to them 
i ll stay with you 
no  go  i ll be fine 
please go before they come over 
all right 
who s that 
are you a reporter 
no 
a poetess 
do you know the story of this oak tree 
no 
they say that if you eat its acorns 
you can make a wish 
and become anyone you want for a day 
why would they say that 
henrik sandahl 
at your disposal 
lili 
are you here with someone  lili 
yes  my  uh   
my cousin s wife 
who s your cousin 
einar wegener  painter 
yes  he s rather a good one 
he s better than most people think 
is that right 
most people our age  at any rate 
don t go back in there 
it s  um    it s cooler out here 
besides  i m a romantic 
really 
i prefer the shadows 
and i don t mean to presume 
but i ve been watching you 
and i think you might be the same 
come on 
have you seen einar  i can t find him 
of course you can t  he isn t here 
cheers 
you re different from most girls 
that s not a very original line 
it s true 
you re old fashioned 
provincial 
i m new to the city 
no  it s more than that 
i feel i d need to ask your permission
before i kissed you 
i should go and find gerda 
why don t you tell her i ll walk you home 
no  she wouldn t like that 
  lili   
  no  einar   
he might be waiting for us 
and he wouldn t like this 
wouldn t he 
no 
lili   
lili   
lili   
you didn t ask permission 
i couldn t risk you saying no 
what s the matter 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  i don t know what happened 
how are you 
you were late home last night 
so i thought i d let you sleep 
how was it 
did lili have fun 
i think it would be better
if lili didn t come here again 
fine 
exactly what happened
between you and sandahl last night 
nothing  it was nothing 
did he know it was you 
it wasn t as simple as that 
i watched him kiss you  einar 
so could you please make an effort 
he may have known who i was 
but i wasn t always me 
there was a moment when i was just lili 
and i think that he could see that 
  do you see 
  but lili doesn t exist 
  we made her up 
  i know 
  we were playing a game 
  i know we were 
but then 
something changed 
this is absurd  we    we need to stop 
you need to stop  einar 
i am going to try 
another headache 
it s nothing 
can i get you anything 
i m fine 
maybe you should see a doctor 
gerda   
i m fine 
i didn t think you d come 
no 
nor did i 
i thought you might not come back 
that s absurd 
is it 
come here 
the model   
einar s cousin 
the resemblance is   
are there others 
a series back at the studio 
these are different 
for these   
i don t know  there may be a market 
you re taking them 
well  yes 
come in 
i haven t got long 
gerda s seeing rasmussen 
i don t like all these lies 
she s very protective 
why don t you just tell her about us 
i couldn t do that 
sorry 
i don t want to upset you 
come here 
  no 
  yes 
einar 
what 
come on  shh  it s all right 
i m sorry  i don t understand 
i    lili 
please 
i don t know what you want 
  i want you 
  i don t know what you mean 
  i want you 
  no 
lili  lili  lili  wait 
are you all right 
no 
i ve been seeing henrik sandahl 
i m   
i thought perhaps you knew 
no 
not this 
so   
are you in love with sandahl 
no 
no  i love you 
gerda  only you  it s lili  she   
be honest 
i need you to believe me  gerda 
you of all people to understand 
all right 
you need to tell me when henrik and
lili
are together  they what  they   
they kiss 
  has it gone beyond that 
  no 
no  lili has never gone
further than that with a man 
she wouldn t  she s   
there have been other men 
wait  there   
there was another  yes 
but it was a long time ago 
it was that boy  hans 
in vejle 
she fell for him  and
he kissed her  just once 
but then my father came in
and he caught them 
and he smacked hans down 
he was so angry 
i don t know what to say 
what 
i m so   
einar 
i m so sorry 
  i m so sorry  i m not feeling well 
  einar  what is it 
einar  einar  einar 
einar  what s happened  what s happening 
  i m all right  i m all right 
  what  do you have pain 
so  you saw dr  andersen
after a bout of severe nosebleeds 
which you have come to believe
coincide with the stomach cramps 
and on a monthly basis 
hmm 
so 
how long have you been married 
six years 
children 
no 
is there regular copulation 
yes 
perhaps less now than before   
than before you started
to dress as a woman 
i m a specialist  mr  wegener 
you may be embarrassed 
i am not 
tell me about lili 
where does she come from 
inside me 
you know  the most likely explanation
for all of this is a chemical imbalance 
  really 
  mmm 
onto the bed 
that would explain the pain 
the confused state of masculinity
and the infertility 
let s hope it is that 
because that  at least  we can cure 
i don t need to do this 
there s nothing wrong with me 
  that s not true 
  gerda  this can t be right 
radiation is a miracle  mr  wegener 
it destroys the bad and saves the good 
i m sure it ll be over quickly 
lie still  mr  wegener 
mr  wegener 
how are you feeling this morning 
you hurt lili 
i m afraid your husband s
aberrant thinking persists 
do you keep a lock on your wardrobe 
of course not 
mrs  wegener 
you re not encouraging this delusion 
you do understand that
your husband is insane 
no  that s not true 
we trusted you  we came to you for help 
gerda 
where have you been 
away 
why  what s wrong 
i sold the lili portraits 
i have enough interest  now 
to mount a full show 
  that s wonderful 
  and there s more 
the gallery etienne dufour in paris
wants to represent you 
  in paris 
  yes  you must go 
i can t travel just now 
gerda  this is your moment 
you ve waited long enough 
these art dealers can be fickle 
oh 
what are you doing 
i ve been asked to exhibit in paris 
  that s wonderful 
  yes 
we have to go 
rasmussen said it would
make all the difference 
gerda  i m not sure that i can 
i ll take care of you 
yes  but surely there s no rush 
can t you just do this one thing for me 
what s happening 
i had a letter from hexler 
he wants to lock me up 
everything will work out for us 
really  i know it 
you just have to trust me 
i do 
einar s a painter  too 
oh  do you exhibit in paris 
i think my work s a little introspective
for french taste 
excuse me  is the model here 
no 
she stayed behind in denmark 
oh  i was so hoping to meet her 
madame gerda wegener   
no  no 
i m sorry 
will you sit for me 
just as you are 
we haven t done that since art school 
the teacher 
suddenly at the mercy of the student 
you found it exciting 
i can t just now 
i m sorry 
i miss you 
i miss you working beside me 
i can t remember the landscape anymore 
i can t remember vejle 
well  you can help me with this background 
what does it need  a kettle hole lake 
a farmhouse  far off 
gerda 
merci 
well  he s playing with us 
he knows the price 
look  i have to go 
i have some danish girl waiting to see me 
all right 
madame 
hans axgil 
hello  thank you for seeing me 
don t thank me yet  i can t represent you 
i don t handle any contemporary art 
of course  i know that 
the reviews for your show
were terrific  but   
perhaps if you would let me speak 
things would be clearer 
so  when did you arrive 
six months  almost 
i don t know
why rasmussen gave you my number 
but i m happy he did 
i asked him 
i wanted to meet you to
put a face to a name 
hmm 
i believe you were
a childhood friend of my husband 
you have a husband 
i m married to einar wegener 
einar 
you remember him 
of course i remember him 
we were such friends  how is he 
he told me that you kissed him once 
i what 
you re right 
you re right  i remember 
we were fooling in the kitchen 
and he was wearing
his grandmother s apron 
you know  little boys  playing around 
he just looked so pretty in it 
i had to kiss him 
so  yes  i kissed einar 
the next thing i know 
his father s chasing me out 
einar  my god 
why didn t he come today 
he doesn t know i m here 
i don t think he d like me asking for help 
we don t really know people here 
and einar is    he s   
he s lost his way 
he s not working 
he needs someone to represent him 
someone who knows him 
he needs a friend 
i have a new dealer
coming over later 
i d like you to meet him 
i don t want a new dealer 
it doesn t make sense to me 
i m hardly working 
that might change 
i don t think so 
i m happy helping you 
it s hans axgil 
dinner at la dauphine at 8 00 
then back here to see the paintings 
he remembers you with great fondness 
it was handmade 
and i ve had it since i was four 
you know  einar s still stricken with guilt
about crashing your kite 
my kite  i ll tease him about that 
no  it s too cruel 
well  if he ever gets here 
perhaps he doesn t want to see me 
no  no  it s not that 
maybe we should order without him 
does he abandon you often 
of course not 
i was joking 
i can come back another time 
if you think einar would prefer it 
really 
he s expecting you 
and it ll do him good 
i know this 
the fjord at vejle 
not far from our houses 
yes  he painted it just before we left 
lili 
hans 
may i introduce
lili wegener 
einar s cousin from home 
you cannot imagine how happy i am 
we actually met once before  in vejle 
but you probably don t remember 
may i take your coat 
of course 
a digestif  hans 
it s so chilly all of a sudden 
i feel the cold these days 
i don t know why 
here 
thank you 
i m so sorry that einar couldn t be here 
he told me how  back in vejle 
you were his great friend 
  both always plotting to get away 
  that s true 
such a tedious place 
he said that you would sit
and you d look out together 
beyond the fjord  to the sea 
to the future 
we had big dreams  yes 
yes 
and that you were the only one
that would let him paint in peace 
who told him it was all
right to be a painter 
he used to sketch my portrait 
take a stone and draw me on the rocks
at the side of the road 
i didn t know that 
yes 
would you like to see more of einar s work 
  yes 
  but do we have any 
of course  lili 
could we not do it another time 
because i just   
i want to hear more about you  hans 
are you married 
  uh  no 
  well  why not 
you don t mind  do you 
i ve been on my own a long time now 
i m too set in my ways 
i think that marriage is the single thing
we should all hope for in life 
really 
it creates someone else 
more than just the two of you 
yes  i think it d be terrible not to   
i think it d be terrible    i m so   
will you excuse me 
lili 
you ought to go 
let me help 
please 
i m sorry 
good night  lili 
good night 
i don t think he noticed  do you 
i don t know 
i think i got out just in time 
sleep now 
we ll talk more tomorrow 
can i borrow a nightdress 
no  we ve never done that 
lili s never spent the night 
it doesn t matter what i wear 
 cause when i dream 
they re lili s dreams 
what 
a new dress 
and this is for you 
do you like it 
yes 
it s perfect for you 
we re a little short of
money at the moment 
i know 
but now that i m back 
i can sit for you again 
well  it worked well before 
didn t it work 
come on  come on  hvap

thank you 
i didn t know you were coming 
it s a good crowd 
she s a popular girl 
thank you for coming 
thank you for inviting me 
i thought you d forgotten all about me 
we ve been busy 
is einar here 
he hates this kind of thing 
that s a shame 
for you  i mean 
i don t mind 
is he well 
he s excited 
our friend  uh  is coming to town 
ulla fonsmarck  the dancer 
you maybe know her 
no  i don t think so 
can i take you to dinner 
to celebrate 
i think someone ought to 
no  thank you 
gerda 
have i offended you 
no 
gerda 
i m still einar s wife 
hans 
oh  henri 
at least take an umbrella 
oh  no  i m fine  honestly 
well  if you just wait a minute 
someone will drive you 
no  i m fine 
my goodness  you re soaked 
did it go well 
tell me  how was it 
you d know if you d been there 
i ve made us a supper 
you should have come 
a little sort of celebration 
this is not how it goes 
we do these things together 
that was you and einar 
stop playing that stupid  stupid game 
please  gerda 
don t you think this is a game 
you should have been there 
how could i 
  look at me 
  not everything is about you 
i need to see einar 
let me help  please 
i need my husband 
go get him 
i can t 
i need to talk to my husband 
i need to hold my husband 
i need him 
can t you just get him 
can you at least try 
no  i m sorry 
gerda 
what is it 
are you all right 
oh  my god 
gerda  wait 
wait 
i don t think i can
give you what you want 
i don t know how long
we can go on like this 
no 
he needs to see someone 
you know what happened with hexler 
but he s so thin 
something s wrong with him 
lili watches her figure 
look 
there s a doctor 
he runs the women s clinic in dresden 
he s interested in men like einar
who are
confused 
men who are different 
he s often in paris 
just talk to him 
you re awake 
how do you feel 
come 
listen  i ve got somewhere to go 
where 
sorry  i   
i don t know
how to hold on to you any longer 
i know 
but i love you 
and i m going to find an answer 
  english 
  english 
do you speak english 
are you  um  a boy or a girl 
  a woman 
  do you have a   
or   
joking 
i can t hold the buyers much longer 
i m sorry 
einar 
you re good at this 
i boxed for a while 
shame you weren t with me earlier 
i m sorry i ve not been to see you before 
that s all right 
you re here now 
i couldn t let gerda see me like this 
she s had enough to put up with 
what s happened to you 
i don t understand 
nor do i 
but i don t think it s anything new 
even back in vejle   
  what 
  ow  sorry 
what 
i was different 
it didn t take much to
be different in vejle 
surely that s why we became friends 
every morning
i promise myself
that i will spend the entire day as einar 
but there s so little of einar left 
you think these things
because you re exhausted 
sometimes i think about killing einar 
but it s only the thought
that i d be killing lili too that stops me 
you need to see someone 
  a doctor 
  no 
  yes 
  no doctors 
i ll help you find someone 
you have to try 
a confused state of identity 
i drill small holes 
here and here 
i have listened to you very carefully 
and i m afraid it s not good news 
you re a homosexual 
well  i don t really know
what kind of help i need  but i   
i can t go on living
without knowing who i am 
please excuse me for a moment 
do you think i m insane 
did a doctor say that 
i m sorry  i know we agreed no more  but   
look at me 
you are not insane 
did i do this to you 
what 
sometimes  i    i wonder   
if it hadn t been for the paintings   
no  gerda  no 
you helped bring lili to life 
but she was always there 
she was always waiting 
now she s making you ill 
i don t know what to do 
the doctors can t help me 
do you want to try one more 
   warnekros  einar  my husband 
  hello 
  good to see you 
so  what do you think would explain
what you ve been experiencing 
mr  wegener 
professor warnekros  the fact is
i believe that i am a woman 
inside 
and i believe it too 
you probably think that i m insane 
or that we both are 
well 
there are people who think that i m insane 
but i think you re probably right 
i ve met another man like you 
i pursued his case 
against the wishes of my colleagues 
of course 
i told him i could operate
to make him fully a woman 
that was what he wanted 
is that really possible 
what happened to the man 
was the operation successful 
on the morning of the first operation 
he ran away 
he was too frightened 
i wouldn t do that  i   
perhaps he was the smart one 
the surgery has never
been attempted before 
never 
professor warnekros  what is the surgery 
two operations 
the first 
to remove the male parts entirely 
the second 
once you re strong enough again 
to construct a vagina 
an irreversible change
and a high risk of failure 
infections 
complications 
it s too dangerous 
it s my only hope 
i leave for dresden at lunchtime tomorrow 
mrs  wegener 
i do believe i can help your husband 
but he won t be your husband
when i ve finished 
i feel strange going dressed like this 
it s important 
hans said
the germans might check your papers 
you re nearly there 
i won t be seeing you again 
i ve only really liked
a handful of people in my life 
and you ve been two of them 
take care 
take care 
i wish you d let me come with you 
i can t 
you love einar 
and i have to let him go 
here 
take this 
hello 
um    my name is lili 
i m here to see professor warnekros 
lili what 
elbe 
lili elbe  like the river 
of course  please take a seat over there 
must i really wait 
it s only a week 
i need you to rest  gain some weight 
we can t risk an infection 
for what we are attempting 
i ll need you to be strong 
this is not my body  professor 
please take it away 
you re having a baby 
and you 
oh  no  no  i m   
i m ill inside 
but professor warnekros
is going to make me better 
and will you be able to
have children after 
do you know  i don t know 
i hope so 
gerda  why don t you go 
  he asked me not to 
  he wanted to protect you 
you should be there  i ll go with you 
if i go  it will be alone 
now you re sounding like einar 
i am like einar 
what do you want me to do 
i want you to go away 
really 
no  i    sorry 
she regained
consciousness very briefly 
we re having to give her
a great deal of morphine  of course 
so that s to be expected 
you mustn t move  lili 
it only makes it worse 
oh  god 
breathe 
breathe 
breathe 
i m here 
it s all right 
i m here now 
lili 
i can feel myself getting better
when i listen to your pencil 
you ve always sketched
me better than i was 
but what you draw  i become 
you made me beautiful 
and now you re making me strong 
such power in you 
shall we go back to denmark  then  gerda 
shall we go home 
lili 
you re late 
and your pills 
every two hours 
and i need to eat something first 
i have some macaroons in my bag all ready 
and these 
only if you need them 
good luck 
and remember 
making a purchase at fonnesbech s
is not merely shopping 
it s an experience 
you lived in paris  yes 
yes 
let everyone know 
the store is a stage 
we re here to perform 
in paris  you see  a lady would never dream
of spraying the scent directly onto herself 
she    she would spray it in the air 
and then she d walk through it 
  oh 
  voila 
you try 
ah  voila 
thanks 
that s so unfair 
you ve got the sweetest tooth
and the narrowest hips in the whole store 
how do you manage it 
eating so much sugar 
the trick is you eat nothing else 
  see you tomorrow 
  see you tomorrow 
  bye  lili 
  bye 
lili  are you coming 
you know  one night last week 
i had the strangest dream 
what was it 
i dreamed you were getting married 
do you think i ever will 
who knows 
so many strange things have happened 
i do want to  gerda 
it s not so long ago we were married 
you and me 
you and einar 
i know it was einar 
but really 
it was you and me 
lili 
is it really you 
i believe so 
so  what you re suggesting
is that  uh  a doctor
intervened 
to correct a mistake in nature 
he made you a woman 
no  god made me a woman 
but the doctor    he    the doctor
is curing me of the sickness
that was my disguise 
a real woman 
you re going to need a new notebook
if you carry on like that 
when warnekros suggested i keep a diary 
i thought i d never have anything to write 
it does help 
just to make sense of things 
maybe i should try it 
so 
do you enjoy working at fonnesbech s 
for now  at least 
i do enjoy sort of being part of it 
you never think of painting 
you might be good at it 
gerda  i want to be a woman  not a painter 
well  people have been known to do both 
i m curious to see what you would paint 
that s all  sometimes it s
hard to know what s in your   
didn t you just take one of those
a minute ago 
gerda  i know what i m doing 
i m just going to get some fresh air 
you know  sometimes i do wonder
why you let me go through all this 
if you thought that
everything would be the same afterwards 
i didn t 
but i promised einar
that i would take care of you 
for goodness  sakes  gerda  einar is dead 
we both have to accept that 
you took care of me 
but now i have to take care of myself 
i have to have a life of my own 
and you need to do the same 
come on  hvap 
uh  yes 
in london 
uh  is it urgent 
no  that s fine 
just tell him   
just say it s a beautiful
day in copenhagen 
  morning 
  good morning 
it s not what you think 
henrik s homosexual 
there s nothing between us 
i should have told you that i d seen him 
no  you shouldn t 
he s a friend  gerdie  someone to talk to 
because you can t talk to me 
i ve made a decision 
i m going back to dresden
for the second operation 
that s too soon 
no    no  it s time 
i need to finish what i started 
you re not strong enough 
professor warnekros thinks that i am 
warnekros 
warnekros hasn t seen you 
i ve made up my mind  gerda 
it could kill you 
i m going on friday  will you come with me 
i won t help you to hurt yourself 
gerda  will you come 
this will be harder than
the first operation 
you understand that 
yes  i do 
it s complex surgery 
and i will sleep all the way through it 
yes  you will 
and you ll be there when i wake up 
of course 
i want a husband who looks just like you 
um   
maybe a child one day 
like a real woman 
one step at a time 
get some rest  good night 
are you still angry with me 
i m not angry with you 
i m worried about you 
you heard my wish  gerda 
when no one else could hear me 
you did 
come 
we both need our rest 
i ll sleep on the chair there 
  no  off to your little hotel 
  i don t mind 
here  take this 
because there s a chill in the air 
  no 
  please 
you have it  for now 
i m going to be fine 
yes 
sleep well 
good night 
good evening 
uh  room nine  please 
number nine  yes  of course 
thank you 
hans 
it s all right 
everything will be all right 
miss elbe 
it s time 
good luck  everybody 
swab  quick 
professor warnekros would like a word 
she lost a lot of blood 
now we are struggling
to keep the fever down 
there s a chance it might
burn itself out  but   
i have to be honest 
the prognosis is not   
come here  just lie still 
it s all right  shh 
shh 
lili 
how are you  lili 
i am
entirely myself 
you had us worried there  you know 
can we go outside  gerda 
into the garden 
you should rest 
please 
you mustn t worry about me anymore  gerda 
it s an old habit 
i m slow to change 
how have i ever deserved such love 
there s nothing to be afraid of anymore 
no 
last night
i had the most beautiful dream 
i dreamed that i was a baby
in my mother s arms 
and she looked down at me 
and she called me lili
