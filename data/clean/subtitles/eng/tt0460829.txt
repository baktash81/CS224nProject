so
you have a new role
to play l hear
up for a role
but uh lm afraid
far from getting it
no no l definitely heard
that you have it
oh
yes
it is an
is it an interesting role
oh yes very
is it about marriage
um perhaps in some ways
but um
your husband
hes involved
no
hmm
a little boy
went out to play
when he opened his door
he saw the world
as he passed
through the doorway
he caused
a reflection
evil was born
evil was born
and followed the boy
im sorry
what is that
an old tale
and the variation
a little girl
went out to play
lost in the marketplace
as if halfborn
then not through
the marketplace
you see that
dont you
but through the alley
behind the marketplace
this
is the way to the palace
but
it isnt something
you remember
forgetfulness
it happens to us all
and me why
lm the worst one
oh where was l
yes
is is there a murder
in your film
uh no thats not
part of the story
no
i think you are wrong
about that
no
brutal fuckin murder
uh i dont like
this kind of talk
the things youve been saying
l think you should go now
yes
me i i cant
seem to remember
if its today
two days from now
or yesterday
hmm i suppose
if it was 945
id think it was
after midnight
for instance
if today
was tomorrow
you wouldnt even remember
that you owed
on an unpaid bill
actions
do have consequences
and yet
there is the magic
if it was tomorrow
you would be sitting
over there

what he meant

i think we have a chance
to pull it off
what do you say
lets do it
if you dont fuck it up
kingsley lm sure we can
ive never felt better
in my life

in a professional way
and thats how it will stay
professional

it was good
nightynight guys
goodnight lll talk to you tomorrow
ok
bye
lets go
hello
good morning ms grace
go right inside
ooh fantastic
its all in the beans
and lm just full of beans
wow is that our set
yeah
but its not finished yet
theres smithys house
smithys house
i should have guessed you two
professionals would be here early
and beavering away
were just laying about
drinking cappuccinos
devon makes
a great capuccino
care for one
oh thanks
but freddie and l just had a
cup of tea
actually it was a terrible cup
of tea at the commissary
terrible is an
inadequate description of it
well l thought since were here
and smithys sets been started
we might go through some of those
scenes that take place there
not the love scene of course
but some of the earlier scenes
that indicate so beautifully
your characters
lets take for instance
scene 35
the scene where uh
devon you arrive
billy
at uh smithys house
to find sue nikki
looking out of the window
i love that scene
yeah well
well just uh
well go through it
and then well
maybe take it on the set and
block it out as best as possible
so i guess we should just
jump right in
yeah that would be jolly good
all right
um lll start it off
uh top of page 57
uh nikki this is just
a rough runthrough
so dont be hard on yourself
i am expecting from you
an academy award performance
right out of the gate so
thanks devon
get going please
i didnt think
youd be here
no of course
you wouldnt
thats because you
what
what do you want
i said some things last night
as you know
yeah
and l want to apologize
apologize
yeah
the things you said
werent the truth
i didnt say that
were they the truth
are you cryin
uh huh
yeah
are you sorry about last night
are you
why are you cryin
im sorry billy
im so sorry
what
oh shit
look in the other room
what is that
freddie
no someones there
this stage is supposed to be
ours and ours alone
well lets have a look
who was it
disappeared where its
real hard to disappear
maybe we should talk
maybe this is the time
lets be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene
what
what is it
sit down lll tell you
now it was freddie who
first heard about it
its
if you have a
an assistant
who can hold his liquor then
freddie can do that
with the best of them
somebodys got to do it
gables dead
now freddie is purposefully
out and about
gathering what
in this business
is the most
valuable commodity
information
information is indispensable
you probably know this
from your own lives
we all have people who gather
agents friends producers
and sometimes they share
sometimes not
politics i dont know
huh ego
fear
kingsley
sometimes one just isnt told
the whole story
kingsley get to the point
on high in blue tomorrows
is in fact a remake
its a remake
yeah
i wouldnt do a remake
no no no no no
l know of course
but you didnt know
the original was a differrent name
it was started
but it was never finished
now freddies found out
that our producers
knew the history of this film
and they have taken it on themselves
not to pass on that information to us
purposefully
well at least not on me
and l assume not the two of you
true
no uh absolutely
nobody told me anything
no me neither
uh i thought this was
an original script
yeah well
anyway the film
was never finished
something happened before
the film was finished
i i dont understand
why wasnt it finished
well after the characters
had been filming for some time
they discovered something
in in
something insi
inside the story
please kingsley
the the two leads
were murdered
it was based
on a polish gypsy folktale
the title in german was
vier sieben
four seven
and it was said to be cursed
so it turned out to be
what
did you understand what i said
i dont understand
hmm you dont speak polish
no
half of it
i i think she understands
more than she lets on
but l dont speak it so
take a seat
now
whats this all about
ive been hypnotized
or something
hypnotized
lm gonna
im im gonna
im gonna kill someone
oh yeah
