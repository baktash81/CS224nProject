to know one s neighbors 
to say  hello  to them 
yes  it s very rare these days 
but that s very nice 
which house are you living in 
just down the way 
tucked back
in the small woods

so   
you have a new role
to play  l hear 
up for a role 
but  uh  l m afraid   
far from getting it 
no  no  l definitely heard
that you have it 
 oh 
 yes   
it is an  
is it an interesting role 
oh  yes  very 
is it about marriage 
um    perhaps  in some ways 
but  um   
your husband 
he s involved 
no 
hmm 
a little boy   
went out to play 
when he opened his door   
he saw the world 
as he passed
through the doorway   
he caused   
a reflection 
evil was born 
evil was born 
and followed the boy 
i m sorry   
what is that 
an old tale 
and the variation 
a little girl   
went out to play 
lost in the marketplace   
as if half born 
then    not through
the marketplace  
you see that 
don t you   
but through the alley 
behind the marketplace 
this   
is the way to the palace 
but   
it isn t something
you remember 
forgetfulness 
it happens to us all 
and    me  why 
l m the worst one 
 oh  where was l  
yes 
is    is there a murder
in your film 
uh  no  that s not
part of the story 
no 
i think you are wrong
about that 
no 
brutal fuckin  murder 
uh  i don t like
this kind of talk 
the things you ve been saying   
l think you should go now 
yes   
me    i    i can t
seem to remember
if it s today   
two days from now 
or yesterday 
hmm  i suppose
if it was 9 45 
i d think it was
after midnight 
for instance   
if today   
was tomorrow   
you wouldn t even remember
that you owed   
on an unpaid bill 
actions   
do have consequences 
and yet   
there is the magic 
if it was tomorrow   
you would be sitting
over there 
do you see 
you think that s really
what he meant 
excuse me  ma am 
excuse me  ma am 
telephone 
it s for you 
it s your agent 
greg 
greg

fortunate to have you onboard

i meant everything l said in
praising devon 
and forgive me  l do love
making speeches 
i mean this  too 
you have everything you need
to soar back to the top   
and stay perched there 
this film  you and devon 
a great director   
yes  do l hear 
the script as well 
we re gonna plunge into it   
if we all    play our role 
do our best 
if we work hard together   
well  this could be the one 
this is a star maker  if ever
l saw one  you ll see 
i think we have a chance
to pull it off 
what do you say 
let s do it 
if you don t fuck it up 
kingsley  l m sure we can 
i ve never felt better
in my life 
champagne and caviar
is on its way 
tonight  nikki grace
and devon berk 
marsha  honey  l know where
you live  don t pull my hair 
we re back in 
5 4 3 2   
mamas  lock up
your daughters  doors 
nikki  really  this news  this
shocking revelation by devon   
must ve send a shiver
down your spine 
are you going
to be able to be
true to hubby
with a wolf in the den 
now  marilyn   
we  um   
i m sure we ll get on famously 
in a professional way 
and that s how it will stay 
professional 
mmm   mm hmm 
mm hmm 
mmm   mm hmm 
and  devon  you naughty boy 
are you hiding a smile 
is your devilish mind
scheming 
mmm mmm 
if you re looking for
shock value  marilyn 
l suggest you look in the mirror 
whoo 
hoo hoo hoo hoo 
what a biting wit 
but l tell you this 
marilyn levens
is going to be watching 
and she will be
reporting to you
everything she finds out 
there and there
and there and
beyond around the world 
the marilyn levens
starlight celebrity show
will be back next week 
from hollywood  california 
where stars make dreams   
   and dreams make stars 
what the hell were
you assholes thinking 
that was the biggest
crock of shit l ever saw 
how can this bitch be popular 
bullshit 
 hey 
 oh  you guys  how did it go 
you were great  you were amazing 
beautiful 
you absolutely nailed it 
did you hear her 
 did you hear what marilyn said 
 no 
she said you glowed 
i mean  it was perfect 
so  devon   
this one s off limits  right 
don t even think about it 
if l don t kill you 
her husband will 
and he is the most
powerful guy around 
he knows everything  there s
not a thing he doesn t know 
i could tell you stories
that ll curl your hair 
so listen to me
when l tell you 
around nikki 
keep it in your pants 
what the fuck you guys
talking about 
she s a nice girl
but she s so far from my style 
it s not even funny 
beautiful  devon  great 
we ll be able to sleep tonight 
you gotta admit  though 
she s got a nice ass 
 it was good 
 nighty night  guys 
 goodnight  l ll talk to you tomorrow 
 ok 
 bye 
 let s go 
 hello 
 good morning  ms  grace 
go right inside 
ooh  fantastic 
it s all in the beans 
and l m just full of beans 
wow  is that our set 
yeah 
but it s not finished yet 
there s smithy s house 
smithy s house   
i should have guessed you two
professionals would be here early
and beavering away 
we re just laying about 
drinking cappuccinos 
devon makes
a great capuccino 
care for one 
oh  thanks 
but freddie and l just had a   
cup of tea 
actually  it was a terrible cup
of tea  at the commissary 
 terrible  is an
inadequate description of it 
well  l thought since we re here
and smithy s set s been started   
we might go through some of those
scenes that take place there 
not the love scene  of course 
but some of the earlier scenes
that indicate so beautifully
your characters 
let s take  for instance 
scene 35   
the scene where  uh   
devon  you arrive  
billy  
at  uh  smithy s house 
to find sue   nikki  
looking out of the window 
 i love that scene 
yeah  well   
we ll just  uh   
we ll go through it 
and then we ll   
maybe take it on the set and
block it out as best as possible 
so i guess we should just
jump right in 
 yeah  that would be jolly good 
 all right 
um  l ll start it off   
uh  top of page 57 
uh  nikki  this is just
a rough run through 
so don t be hard on yourself 
i am expecting from you
an academy award performance
right out of the gate  so   
thanks  devon 
get going  please 
 i didn t think
you d be here  
 no  of course
you wouldn t  
 that s because you    
 what  
 what do you want  
 i said some things last night 
as you know  
 yeah  
 and l want to apologize  
  apologize  
  yeah  
 the things you said
weren t the truth  
 i didn t say that  
 were they the truth  
 are you cryin   
 uh huh   
yeah  
 are you sorry about last night  
 are you  
 why are you cryin   
 i m sorry  billy 
i m so sorry    
 what  
 oh  shit  
 look in the other room  
what is that 
freddie 
no  someone s there 
this stage is supposed to be
ours and ours alone 
well    let s have a look 
who was it 
disappeared where it s
real hard to disappear 
maybe we should talk 
maybe this is the time 
let s be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene 
 what 
 what is it 
sit down  l ll tell you 
now  it was freddie who
first heard about it 
it s  
if you have a  
an assistant
who can hold his liquor  then   
freddie can do that
with the best of them 
somebody s got to do it 
gable s dead 
now  freddie is purposefully
out and about
gathering what
in this business
is the most
valuable commodity  
information 
information is indispensable 
you probably know this
from your own lives 
we all have people who gather  
agents  friends  producers 
and    sometimes they share 
sometimes not 
politics  i don t know 
huh  ego 
fear 
kingsley 
sometimes one just isn t told
the whole story 
kingsley  get to the point 
on high in blue tomorrows
is  in fact  a remake 
it s a remake   
 yeah 
 i wouldn t do a remake 
no  no no  no  no 
l know  of course 
but you didn t know 
the original was a differrent name 
it was started 
but it was never finished 
now    freddie s found out
that our producers   
knew the history of this film
and they have taken it on themselves
not to pass on that information to us 
purposefully 
well  at least  not on me 
and l assume not the two of you 
true 
no  uh  absolutely 
nobody told me anything 
no  me neither 
uh  i thought this was
an original script 
yeah  well   
anyway  the film
was never finished 
something happened before
the film was finished 
i   i don t understand 
why wasn t it finished 
well  after the characters
had been filming for some time   
they discovered something   
in   in  
something insi  
inside the story 
please  kingsley 
the   the two leads   
were murdered 
it was based
on a polish gypsy folktale 
the title in german was
vier sieben  
four seven 
and it was said to be cursed 
so it turned out to be 
what 
did you understand what i said 
i don t understand 
hmm  you don t speak polish 
no 
half of it   
i   i think she understands
more than she lets on 
but l don t speak it  so   
take a seat 
now

i ve been hypnotized 
or something 
hypnotized

once when l  
when l looked
around the bar

and he   he said that l   
that i would know who it was 
how are you gonna kill
this person 
with a screwdriver

my wife is not a free agent 
i don t allow her that 
the bonds of marriage

for ourselves   
by ourselves  or   
if necessary   
they re enforced for us 
either way  she is   
   bound 
do you understand this 
there are consequences
to one s actions
