thirty five  maybe 
i have lots of scars 
they call my condition
focal retrograde amnesia 
it s no picnic

  any other questions 
  what s the weather like on your planet 
charlene  my darling 
my name is samantha  samantha caine 
no  no  no  forget all that 
that teacher business was your cover

your memory was gone  you got confused 
you bought your own cover 
it was a fantasy  for chrissake 
samantha caine never existed 
you wrote the bloody thing 
no  it s not a fantasy 
i m in the goddamn pta 
then quit 
you re an assassin
working for the united states government 
i ought to know 
i trained you 
get the fuck out of here  ha  ha 
assassin  ha  ha 
your father was in the royal lrish rangers 
assigned to belfast 
after he was murdered there in 1975   
his friend perkins adopted you 
or perhaps i should say recruited you   
to work for chapter  a black bag operation
working from the u s  state department 
you getting this 
october  1988 
you re assigned to take out
a munitions dealer  daedalus   
and his hired enforcer  timothy 
you failed to complete your mission   
electing instead to die  of all things 
despite clear orders to the contrary 
and dead you remained until 
without preamble   
you re emerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier 
anyhow  i think we can safely assume   
that daedalus is aware
of your resurrection   
and attempting to reverse it 
he ll be watching the police 
watching hospitals 
we must stay away  understand 
yes  mr  henessey  can i help you 
henessey  what is it 
it s a setup  it s gotta be 
put that down 
this is not an episode of television 
those guys back there at the train station 
how d they know we d be there 
impossible 
unless waldman here told them 
  i did not 
  they tapped your phone at least 
i know it sounds preposterous   
oh  just happened to know we d be calling 
get in the car

you thinking what i m thinking 
i hope not  because i m thinking
how much my balls hurt 
but if you re talking about that postcard 
i don t wanna meet more of your friends 
we have no choice 
we need some answers
or we re gonna die 
i saw you from the road

  who are you  william shatner  calm down 
yeah  a note to her uncle 
  max 
  yeah 
uncle max 
that s the agency  you blithering idiot 
and the word  engaged  means

she doesn t know me from adam 
it s not that i don t trust my
compadre here  major baltimore 
in fact  i had every confidence
that your amnesia was genuine   
until you showed up here 
you follow 
i m trying to pull off the biggest job
of my career   
so you see  darling 
i have to know how much about me   
you really remember  and who you told 
i haven t told a soul  i swear 
we ll soon know 
what is this  some kind of torture thing 
torture  yes 
a woman s face
never looks quite so beautiful   
as when it s distended in pain 
witness the beauty of childbirth 
  untie me and i ll make any face you want 
  let s not and say we did 
take a deep breath 
we re gonna do the torture thing 
operation honeymoon s on schedule 
i ve secured the tanker 
now i just gotta make the soup 
i ll follow as soon as i m done here 
ten minutes in this cold water 
she ll be insane or dead 
five minutes 
she ll tell me everything i need 
that s right  take all the air you can 
if you need to vomit  do it now 
so you
don t remember anything at all 
best night of your fucking life 
i say drown the wench 
talk to me  major 
is my identity safe 
my name is samantha caine 
answer the question 
who knows about me 
nobody  fuck you 
fuck you 
i hate to see you like this  charly 
i heard you were a hell of a spy once 
watch your back 
i m not done yet 
good night 
okay  i ll signal daedalus 
your money will be waiting 
jack 
jack  jack 
do yourself a favor  man 
don t let her looks fool you 
she s the energizer fucking bunny 
just do her and dump her 
don t try to get cute
and play doctor first 
i made that mistake  it nearly killed me 
motherfucker 
daedalus   
i ll make you a deal 
let me go now   
and i ll leave you the use of your legs 
why have you resurfaced 
is it operation honeymoon  is that it 
who sent you 
why are you here 
i let you touch me  cowboy 
i think i need a bath 
samantha  please 
who s samantha 
where s henessey 
the lengthening of its neck
makes it easier for it to swim 
its front feet are larger   
and that s good  to have paddle like
feet to move through water   
hey  mitch 
you re awake 
you re seeping 
here  look at this 
shit 
that hurt like shit 
i know  that s why i distracted you first 
same principle as deflowering virgins 
what  virg     what 
i read it in this harold robbins book 
guy bites her on the ear 
distracts from the pain 
you ever try that 
no  no  i sock them in the jaw
and yell   pop goes the weasel  
who the fuck are you 
the name s charly 
the spy 
nice to meet you 
drink 
yeah 
now  as you can see 
things are still very crazy here   
but the sheriff has told me this 
there have been gunshots  and yes   
okay  let s say i buy it 
you are a trained killer 
i can t even say that with a straight face 
so samantha  she   
never really existed 
like nathan said 
she was a total fabrication 
i made her up 
so now she s just gone
forever and ever 
thank god 
look at my inordinately large ass 
look what she did to me 
pretty convincing act 
i guess 
you know  her personality
had to come from somewhere 
change the subject 
better yet  bring me that bottle 
here you go  drink up 
so  what s next 
what do we do now 
i contact chapter 
i come in for debriefing   
bury the last eight years   
get back to work

if she got to daedalus   
she could know about honeymoon 
she might know that old targets
have become your new best friends 
that could be trouble 
goddamn you 
there were weapons at that farm 
she s armed now 
stop having kittens 
you re the head of a major spy network 
and you have a tendency to whine 
do you realize that 
she could compromise
this entire operation 
we have 24 hours 
we find her   
then we kill her 
do whatever it takes  but be careful 
if it gets out you work for me   
i ll be grabbing my ankles

fundraiser 
1993 
world trade center bombing  remember 
during the trial  one of the bombers
claimed the cia had advanced knowledge 
the diplomat who issued
the terrorists  visa was cia

for the bombing   
purely to justify a budget increase 
you re gonna fake some terrorist thing
just to scare some money out of congress 
well  unfortunately  mr  henessey
