you might not believe it to look at me
but i was born only years eight ago
on a beach in new jersey
i entered the world fully grown
wearing clothes i dont remember buying
in the back pocket a single key
filed blank and faceless
a fitting metaphor
but otherwise no help whatsoever none
sometimes i stand naked in the mirror
try to guess my age
thirtyfive maybe
i have lots of scars
they call my condition
focal retrograde amnesia
its no picnic
but ive learned to live with it
got a job i love been seeing someone
nice guy good sense of humor
hound of the baskervilles

working for the united states government

assassin ha ha
your father was in the royal lrish rangers
assigned to belfast
after he was murdered there in 1975
his friend perkins adopted you
or perhaps i should say recruited you
to work for chapter a blackbag operation
working from the us state department
you getting this
october 1988
youre assigned to take out
a munitions dealer daedalus
and his hired enforcer timothy
you failed to complete your mission
electing instead to die of all things
despite clear orders to the contrary
and dead you remained until
without preamble
you reemerge eight years later
and a good deal frumpier
anyhow i think we can safely assume
that daedalus is aware
of your resurrection
and attempting to reverse it
hell be watching the police
watching hospitals
we must stay away understand
yes mr henessey can i help you
henessey what is it
its a setup its gotta be

and thats good to have paddlelike
feet to move through water

i cant even say that with a straight face
so samantha she
never really existed
like nathan said
she was a total fabrication
i made her up
so now shes just gone
forever and ever
thank god

have become your new best friends
that could be trouble

stop having kittens
youre the head of a major spy network
and you have a tendency to whine
do you realize that
she could compromise
this entire operation
we have 24 hours
