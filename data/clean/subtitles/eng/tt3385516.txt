after the vietnam war in 1973 
6 days later  we all watched
as one of those mutants   
erik lehnsherr  attacked the president
and the cabinet
on the lawn of the white house 
their lives were saved by
a young mutant  who stopped him 
now  lehnsherr escaped and became
the world s most wanted fugitive 
and as for her 
she disappeared as well 
but  she has become
the symbol of a new age 
the face of a world
that will never   
     be the same again 
  you winking at my girl 
yes  the world is panicked 
  your girl 
      and there is still some prejudice

  hey  scott 
i m hank mccoy 
i m one of the teachers here 
where s the professor 
    to break forth bloodily  then the past
must be obliterated and a new start made 
let us now start fresh
without remembrance 
rather than live forward and
backward at the same time 
now  what are the aggrieve things

when he wrote all that 
he   
that s going to be your
assignment for tomorrow

thank you 
this is my brother  scott 
hello  scott 
welcome to the school for the gifted 
yeah 
it doesn t exactly feel like a gift 
it never does  not at first 
the first step in understanding
one s power is learning the extent of it 
only then  can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it 
if you do decide to stay 
i can promise you that by
the time you are done here
you ll be able to go back into the world
and play a stable productive partner 
why don t you take your bandages off
and we can have a look
at what we re dealing with here 
alex  would you line him up 
face him in the right direction if you will 
there s a target just across the water 
when you open your eyes 
try and hit that 
you can open your eyes  scott 
there s nothing to be afraid of 
it s quite   
get back 
get back 
get back

i   
i saw the end of the world 
i could feel all this death 
nope 
it was just a dream 
  but  it felt real 
  i know 
your mind is the most powerful
i ve ever seen 
  it can convince itself   
  no  it s not
just a mind reading or a telekinesis 
it s something else 
some    dark power inside
and it s growing  like a fire 
  i thought i was getting better 
  you are  you will 
  you just have to be patient 
  no  no 
you don t know what it s like
to be afraid to shut your eyes 
  to be trapped inside your own head 
  oh  but i think i do 
it wasn t so long ago 
that i was plagued by voices of myself 
all their suffering 
all their pain 
their secrets 
i m afraid one day
i am going to hurt someone 
lie back 
everyone fears that
which they do not understand 
you will learn to control your powers 
and when you do 
you ll have nothing to fear 
her nightmares were different this time 
well  it could have count for something
i saw while i was in my lab earlier 
there was some kind of tremor 
like an energy surge 
  i picked it up on one of my meters 
  you re saying that jean created it 
no  i m saying something else did 
maybe she was reacting to it 
i don t know 
but  the epicenter was
half way around the world 
  half way around the world 
  yeah 
that s why i was hoping
you could take a look

how d you leave things 
  any hard feelings 
  not likely 
everybody take a break 
i wiped her mind off
all memories of us 
the beach  cuba 
that whole time 
it s so long ago  alex 
before the world knew about mutants 
i have felt   
it was the best thing for her 
and for you 
it didn t really matter
what s best for me 
moira mactaggert 
hello 
allow me to introduce myself 
i m professor   
charles xavier
  i know exactly who you are
  you do 
of course i do 
i ve read all of your papers 
it s a pleasure to finally meet you 
  moira mactaggert 
  alex summers 
have a seat 
just  throw that on the floor 
it s wonderful to see you again 
to to meet you again
for the first time 
i   
you got a son 
  yes 
  does he have a husband or   
do you have a husband 
i had a husband  but   
it s hard to do this job and
make it home in time for dinner 
good 
good 
we all make choices  right 
yes  we do 
  professor 
  yes 
yes  i was    we were hoping
that you would tell us about
what happened yesterday in egypt 
i m afraid that s classified information 
and  i don t mean to be rude 
but   
how did you get in here 
i have level 5 clearance 
ever since the world found out
about mutants in  73 
there have been cults who see them
as some kind of second coming
or sign of god 
i was tracking one of them 
they called themselves 
ashir en sabah nur 
named after an ancient being
they believed to be the world s first 
the world first s what 
the world s first mutant 
i thought mutants didn t
evolve until this century
that s the common theory  yes 
but  these guys believe that
the first mutant was born
ten of thousands of years ago 
and they believe he will rise again 
they ve been searching ancient sites
all round the world for clues 
these hieroglyphs described a specific set
of powers greater than any man can possess 
they think he lived all that time 
yes and no 
they believe he had the ability
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body 
and whenever he was close to death
he would just take on a new body 
so  these may have been the bodies of
mutants enabling him to take their powers
amassing varies abilities over the years 
  an all powerful mutant 
  exactly 
and wherever this being was 
he always had 4 principle followers 
disciples 
protectors he would imbue their powers 
like the four horsemen of the apocalypse 
  he got that one from the bible 
  or the bible got it from him 
and wherever he ruled 
eventually  it would end in disaster 
cataclysm 
some kind of    apocalypse 
the end of the world 
i must say  apollo 
the way you ape
human behavior is remarkable 
get out 
come one 
come on 
come on 
i ve never seen another
mutant in this city 
do you speak egyptian 
arab 
english 
great fighter 
she s my hero 
i want to be like her

you love me 
love you 
be logical 
i m not some simple
shepherdess you can awe 
why  i could no more love you than
i could love a new species of   
bacteria 
what are you doing 
learning 
in the streets there is outrage against
the soviet invasion of afghanistan   
the brotherhood of our kind 
one of them was held in boston 
since the act in the nuclear weapons 
the united states does not start fights

united states being superpowers

charles wants students
not soldiers 
he thinks the best of people 
he has hope 
and you 
you know  i think
we should hope for the best 
and prepare for the worst 
i think the world needs the x men 
maybe  now that you re back
you can help me convince him
      we can start it together 
  hank  i m here about erik

see what i can do 
i ll show you 
think about the person
you love most in your life

it is to lose someone they love 
and live with that pain 
  forever 
  henryk  please

who the fuck are you

people were slaughtered 
you shouldn t have brought me here 
why 
are you afraid to be here 
you can t escape it  erik 
who are you 
elohim  shen  ra 
i ve been called many names
over many lifetimes 
i am born of death 
i was there to spark and fan
the flame of man s awakening 
to spin the wheel of civilization 
and when the forest would grow rank
and in need of clearing for new growth   
i was there to set it ablaze 
where were you 
when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place 
asleep 
trapped in darkness 
i was not there for you  my son 
but i am here now 
you don t know your own strength 
but i do 
reach down 
feel the metal in the ground 
reach  as deep as you can 
you ll find you have the power
to move the very earth itself 
everything they ve built will fall 
and from the ashes of their world 
we ll build a better one 
lehnsherr was identified yesterday
in this small town  in central poland 
leaders from all communities are
urging their citizens to remain calm
as police and armed forces
are mobilizing
to find lehnsherr before
he can strike again 
if anyone has information about lehnsherr 
or as he is also known as magneto 
contact you local authorities immediately 
and proceed with caution 
  as he is considered extremely dangerous 
  peter 
what s up 
  i m just checking on you 
  i m good  playing pac man 
are you sure
you weren t watching this 
the world was celebrating 10 years of
peace between mutants and man kind 
you re going after him  aren t you 
you wanted me to get out
of the house more  right 
i can t stop you 
nobody can 
trust me 
this won t end well 
nothing does with him 
i m not afraid of him 
you should be 
xavier s school
for gifted youngsters
i ve read so much about this place 
but being here 
it actually seems kind of   
    familiar 
  it s strange 
  it could be quite 
shall we 
now playing
the return of the jedi
i m just saying 
 the empire  is still the best 
it s the most complex 
the most sophisticated 
wasn t afraid to have a dark ending 
yeah  but come on  if it
wasn t for the first one
you wouldn t have any of
the rest of the movies 
well  at least we can all agree
the third one is always the worst 
hank 
you in here 
i d like you to meet the   
moira 
raven 
i m sorry  have we met 
hank  alex  agent mactaggert  would
you give us just one moment please 
of course 
charles  why didn t she recognize me 
she knew me in this form 
well  after you left me
on the beach in cuba 
i took her memories of that time 
have a sit 
lucky girl 
it s good to see you  raven 
  welcome home 
  this isn t my house 
it was once 
no  it was your home 
i just lived here 
i barely even recognize it now 
yeah  i have plans for this place 
i mean to turn it
into a real campus 
a university  not just for mutants 
even for humans too 
living and working 
    growing together 
you know  i really believed that once 
i really believed we can
change them after dc 
we did 
no charles 
they still hate and fear us 
it s just harder to see because
they re more polite about it 
i got sick of living that lie 
that s why you re not
in your natural blue form 
i m not going to be the face
of a world that doesn t exist 
things are better 
the world is better 
maybe in westchester 
out there  mutants are still running 
hiding  living in fear 
just because there s not a war
doesn t mean there s peace 
if you want to teach your kids
something  teach them that 
teach them to fight 
otherwise  they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives 
you still sound just like him 
you sound just like erik 
that s why i m here 
he s resurfaced 
he had a wife and a daughter 
they were killed 
along with a handful of policemen 
the whole world
will be looking for him 
but you can help me
find him before they do 
moira  i m going to have to
ask you to keep this a secret 
i don t even know
what this    is 
it s cerebro 
  the new model 
  yeah  i based the color on   
it doesn t matter 
what are those 
those are all the humans
of the world 
and these   
    are all the mutants 
i m connected to all of their minds 
the cia would kill for this 
i know they would 
where are you  erik 
charles

and your loss 
you think  because

    you know how it feels 
you are looking in the wrong place  charles 
what happened to them 
it was terribly wrong 
but  come back to us 
i can help you 
help me 
think of your wife 
think of your daughter 
  what would they have wanted 
  they would have wanted to live 
i tried your way  charles 
i tried to be like them 
live like them 
but it always ends the same way 
they took everything away from me 
now   
we ll take everything from them 
hank

not more spears 
no more slings 
no more swords

the pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches from russia 
as well as the uk 
israel and china 
  look 
  up there 
so far  there has been
no response from the white house 
eye witness accounts have been pouring in
from across the globe 
authorities are not sure if it was
an act of peace or an act of war 
dear father 
hold me in the light of god 
it should have been me 
he was the one who s going to
do something with his life 
he was always the one 
that s not how he felt 
he felt you were the one who s going to
do something special with your life 
that you re going to make
a difference in the world 
maybe even change it 
how did you know what he felt 
i know what everybody feels 
hold me in the light of god 
protect me from danger 
save me by your command 
listen to my prayer 
and keep me safe 
you re blocking me 
how 
i can shield their minds
from your power 
it s one of the many gifts i have
acquired through out the millennia 
but to    see   
inside a mind 
to control it 
that s your gift 
you saw it  didn t you 
the glory of what s to come 
are you going to take part
in all this killing 
destruction 
  it s all i ever known 
  no  it isn t 
  you ve just forgotten 
  no  charles  i remember 
your way doesn t work 
i showed him a better way 
a better world 
no  you just tapped into his rage and pain 
that s all you ve done 
i told you from the moment i met you 
there s more to you  erik 
there is good in you too 
whatever it is you think
you saw in me  charles 
i buried it 
with my family 
  what

i m a senior officer at the cia 
i know who you are 
agent mactaggert 
  you cannot keep me here in this   
  actually  i can 
a psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to moscow 
that event emanated from
exactly where we found you 
at the home of the world s
most powerful psychic 
so  you re going to tell me 
where is charles xavier 
it s not him
you should be worried about 
there s someone else 
someone more powerful 
if you let us out of here 
we can help you 
do you really expect me
to believe that 
you can put on any face
that you want 
but i know who you are 
what you are 
hey  moira 
mm 
what did you mean when you said
someone more powerful than charles 
once he finished this 
we ll go from there 
what s taking so long 
i can t get in 
it has a field around it
like the helicopter 
there s got to be a way
to cut the power 
charles  you will send a message
to every living mind 
you will tell them that this earth
will be laid waste 
that it is i  en sabah nur 
who wreak this upon them 
now 
deliver my message 
even if i wanted to 
i couldn t reach that many people 
i don t have cerebro 
you don t need a machine   
to amplify your powers 
you have me 
guys  that could be
our way out of here 
you know him 
magneto

on tv again 
and  i came to their house
looking for him 
but  by the time i got there

but i have returned 
but i have returned 
the day of reckoning 
it is here 
all your buildings

iron  nickel  cobalt 
the ocean s floor is
lying with them too 
it s already begun 
at the lowest depths 
land masses will slow it 
but not for long 
eventually  cities  urban centers 
anything built since the
bronze age will be wiped away 
the death toll will be billions

whole god damn world 
you re just another false god 
and whoever s left to follow you
when this is all over 
they will betray you again 
you re wrong  charles

to the other  has stopped 
at a debriefing today 
cia special agent moira mactaggert

committee

aided in defeating
this powerful and unknown   
i think our prayers were answered 
thank you  mr  president 
the potential destructive power
of mutants   
    is sure to fuel new controversy
and debate   
at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world 
mystique told me he is your father 
are you gonna tell him 
i might   
one day 
i think for now  i m just gonna
stick around here for a while 
me  too 
the world s already begun
rebuilding it s arsenals 
it s human nature  charles 
i still have hope 
oh  yes 
 hope  
i was right about raven 
i was even right about you 
what about the rest of the world 
doesn t it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night 
the feeling that one day
they ll come for you   
and your children 
it does  indeed
what do you do when
you wake up to that 
i feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul   
that comes to my school
looking for trouble 
you re sure i can t convince you
to stay

you can convince me to do anything 
goodbye  old friend
