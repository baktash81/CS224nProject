a job like this with his wife in my condition 
that kind of guy 
my husband s the bravest man i know
but he is not much for abstract thinking 
honor and duty are as real as i am 
so if it comes down to a choice
between his life and his duty  
you want me to push him
in the right direction 
  can i shove him in the right direction 
  heh 
that s why i picked you  you seem sensible 
well  that s a nice way to put it

buy yourself a cadillac  lt s a nice car 
you don t get cars like that too often 
you know  jerry  one of these nights
she s just gonna get bored 
scared 
or he ll give her a rock and she ll
just roll on us in a fit of gratitude

a new swain and that s not good 
with all due respect  sarge  you don t
know a goddamn thing about her

el dorado trust 
it s an a bomb

continental wire service   
   which means cohen s got the only wire
between here and chicago 
he s building the central book
for the entire western united states 
wait  what s the central book 
all gambling money on the west coast
will go through a central book   
   and mickey cohen
will touch every penny 
if he gets that thing up and running 
inside a week it won t matter what we do 
it ll be growing faster than we can

when he was sent to alcatraz  friends of
jack whalen welcomed him with a lead pipe 
 camera cllcking 
parker stayed on as chief of police
until his death in 1966 
he got credit for cohen s downfall 
no one ever spoke of the gangster squad 
the reign of the gangster mickey cohen
in los angeles is at an end 
o mara 
parker deserved the praise 
in tough times  he d kept his oath
to protect and serve   
   just like the thousands who walk
their beats every day 
maybe without glory   
   but with pride and honor 
 barks 
we brought cohen in  but it was
grace s testimony that put him away 
after the trial  she held on to jerry
and wouldn t let go 
jerry always threatened to leave
the force  but he never did 
i guess he couldn t shake
the call of duty that echoed in his ears 
every man carries a badge 
and this was mine 
but it was time to put it away 
the mob has never had
a foothold in los angeles 
i d like to think i played
