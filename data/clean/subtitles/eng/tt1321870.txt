cop
all right lets go
omara
every man carries a badge
mickey cohen pledged allegiance
to his own power
violence was his means and his end
when he was sent to alcatraz friends of
jack whalen welcomed him with a lead pipe
camera cllcking
parker stayed on as chief of police
until his death in 1966
he got credit for cohens downfall
no one ever spoke of the gangster squad
the reign of the gangster mickey cohen
in los angeles is at an end
omara
parker deserved the praise
in tough times hed kept his oath
to protect and serve
just like the thousands who walk
their beats every day
maybe without glory
but with pride and honor
barks
we brought cohen in but it was
graces testimony that put him away
after the trial she held on to jerry
and wouldnt let go
jerry always threatened to leave
the force but he never did
i guess he couldnt shake
the call of duty that echoed in his ears
every man carries a badge
and this was mine
but it was time to put it away
the mob has never had
a foothold in los angeles
id like to think i played
