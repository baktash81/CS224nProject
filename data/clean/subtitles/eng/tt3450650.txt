problem 
they ve already upgraded the lock on mr 
van gogh to the dual control 
you said the upgrades weren t
scheduled till tomorrow 
because that is what the
security e mail said 
now  i do have a
guy on the inside
who was supposed to alert
me if the schedule changed 
obviously  he didn t 
options 
we disable both controls
at the exact same moment
with a thermal lance 
now  it can be done 
but that s gonna push us back 
okay  let s switch out all the other
pieces before the rest get upgraded 
then we can focus
on the van gogh 
it s number one on our buyer s list 
and i am not leaving without it 
everybody listen up 
we re going now 
now  we re leaving the
van gogh for last 
so nadia will coordinate
the new order 
they say las vegas has the
best security in the world 
well  we re about to find out 
bring me your guy on the inside 
  what d i do 
  you don t get it 
  you just do not get it

hair and nice teeth 
  officer needs assistance 
  don t you get it 
you smell like peat moss and curry 
and i think i m gonna throw up 
you don t want to
go out with me 
whoa  seems to me like two nice people
are trying to board the peace train 
but she seems to have derailed 
look  this hairy  drunk rent a cop
confused  go away  for  hit on me  
  hey   
  ma am  officer panero here 
who  in my professional
opinion  doesn t seem drunk 
has at least three years 
training in distress recognition 
i m sure he sensed that an
attractive lady sitting by herself
most likely seemed a bit lonely 
so before you retreat behind
that wall we all put up 
just know that officer
panero was here for you 
maybe i overreacted 
and he s giving the
keynote tonight 
  pleasure to be here 
  he s blotto 
sort of like someone s
mother last columbus day 
will you let it go  it
was a half box of wine 
she s very patriotic 
well  there s no way
panero can go on 
we need a leader right now that can
step up  take the reins and inspire us 
i understand 
i tried contacting officer ferguson from
tsa  but he must have his phone off 
i mean  my hands are tied 
paul 
can you step up to the
plate and save us 
i m gonna need my dress whites 
come on

  thank you very much

i am the general manager of this
resort  so i don t take tips 
and i don t normally deliver
dry cleaning either 
but i just    i
wanted to clarify
that i was not making
advances towards you earlier 
nor would i  ever 
look  i understand you
have no control over this 
integrity is a bewitching gumbo 
but i m preparing now 
internally  to give the keynote 
so if you don t mind  okay 
look  this is crazy 
i m actually dating someone 
please  ma am  i practically
invented the fake boyfriend thing 
what 
listen  you have no bearing
on my life whatsoever 
your lip is sweating 
it s sweating 
there is an audience out there
of security professionals
that paid good money
to hear you speak 
they want to hear you 
that s not true  they didn t pay
anything  but they do deserve your best 
they deserve it 
they deserve it

okay 
hey  thanks for all your help 
there you are 
  we re about to announce you 
  okay 
come on  maya 
thanks 
cool party  whose suite is this 
the housekeepers are all
good friends of mine 
they let me know when the high
rollers check out early  so   
  you okay 
  yeah  everything s great 
i ll be right back  i
got something for you 
i think you re gonna like it 
yeah 
very kind  very kind 
ladies and gentlemen  i know
you re here to see nick panero
deliver the keynote speech 
however  due to circumstances
beyond our control 
we ve had to bring in a
different speaker tonight 
yeah  i know  i m
disappointed  too 
so  instead  how about a
nice  warm expo welcome
for officer paul blart 
thank you  officer gundermutt 
is it warm in here 
or am i ordering my next uniform
from rochester big and humid 
i am honored to be here 
in the presence of the
greats from the past 
just looking at these faces reminds me
of the questions so many people ask 
why do we do it 
why walk a beat knowing
that on a typical day
you ll get zero
pats on the back 
but you know what you will get 
a whole lot of ridicule 
what are you doing here 
i thought mini kiss was playing 
what are you doing here 
i get it  we re easy targets 
people call us heavy 
skinny  lumpy 
they point out our bad skin 
what is it that we
all have in common 
in the words of joseph conrad 
who wrote some really long
books about sailing and stuff 
 we live as we dream  
 alone  
turns out i am giving
 the keynote after all 
so it d mean a lot if you
could be there  peanut 
you were supposed to tell me
  if the schedule got moved 
  let s calm down 
and no one told me anything 
i m sorry  bye 
get her 
and yet  when people ask
me   why do you do it  
i have to laugh 
 cause they think
i have a choice 
i don t 
i  like you  didn t
choose security 
security chose me 
every morning  i pull my
pants on one leg at a time 
and i slip on my
soft soled shoes 
and i hear the same
calling you do 
 help someone today  
come on  dad 
 help someone today  
sounds easy  doesn t it 
but if being a security officer
was easy  anybody could do it 
anyone can do it 
takes a certain breed 
someone who has spidey senses
when things are going wrong 
sure  you can meet all kinds of
people in this line of work 
your shoplifters 
your pickpockets 
your freeloaders
stealing a nap in a
brookstone massage chair 
  they re the worst 
  don t get me started 
and there s the old lady who can t
find her car in parking level f
 cause she doesn t have a car 
and there is no parking level f 
it only goes up to d 
and all of a sudden
you re asking yourself 
 why do i do it  
till the little boy  tears in his
eyes  is tugging on your sleeve 
he says to you 
 mister  mister  mister  
 can t find my mommy  
that s why you do it 
  yeah 
  yeah 
i will close with this 
if you believe the purpose of
life is to only serve yourself 
then you have no purpose 
help someone today 
  jackpot 
  you nailed it  you nailed it 
way to 90  blart

ramos 
excuse me 
the buttons on your
uniform are rivet brass 
made by cintas uniform supply 
which stopped using that
particular type of metal 
due to humanitarian
reasons  18 years ago 
since there s no way
you re a day over 30 
and the security association
restricts the hiring
of anybody under the age of 18 
there is no way you are
a security guard here 
you re right 
headbutt

well done  blart 
you thinned my manpower
significantly

lonely out there 
you scared 
not following you 
your fear of being alone 
  first your wife dumps you at the altar 
  wrong 
  she was with me six days 
  great 
so she got to sample
the merchandise
and was glad she
kept her receipt 
and then your mom
kisses a bus 
it was a milk truck  but
i ll give you that one 
and now your daughter can t
wait to get away from you 
that s not true  dad 
well  she s following her
destiny  and i support it fully 
flag on the play  sloppy 
she says you can t be alone
and that you re doing everything
in your pathetic power
to keep her under your thumb 
  i didn t say that exactly  dad 
  it s okay  sweetheart 
see  vincent  i m
fiercely independent 
yet i m not a big
fan of being alone 
i m a contradiction 
i told you i was crazy 
and i told you that i m crazy 
you can t out crazy me 
my crazy will take your crazy 
shove it in a metal tube 
fill it with rats 
then blowtorch it
until the rats have no way to escape except
eating their way through your crazy 
wow  you are oblivious to
the avalanche of insanity
i am about to unload 
you don t know what
i will do to you 
you don t know what
i ll do to you 
i will spin around until i throw
up on you and your friends 
i simply don t care 
i ll stick your face in maple
syrup and make you sing gospel 
how does that blow
your hair back  blart 
i will crawl inside you and
lay eggs like a baby spider 
i welcome it 
i ve got two different
colored eyes

because that s how crazy i am 
now  give me back my daughter 
give me my painting 
pick it up  pick it up
before he ruins it 
get back 
did you honestly think that
i was gonna be thwarted
by some sweaty  sluggish
non entity like yourself 
 non entity  
see  i knew you
couldn t be trusted 
so i took out an
insurance policy 
allow me to introduce you
to a few of my associates 
gino chizetti 
staten island
industrial complex 
saul gundermutt 
philadelphia farmers  market 
khan mubi 
king s landing walmart 
and last but not least 
donna ericone  mall
of freaking america 
you got to    you got
to fan out  guys 
he can t see you 
fan it out  fan it out 
you have your own superhero 
what s with the cape 
why are you wearing
a cape  khan 
i came straight from a haircut 
vincent  you just
don t get it  do you 
fool me once  shame on you 
fool me twice  shame on me 
are you sure about that 
you see  i have a little
insurance policy of my own 
see  i thought i took
all of you out  what   
non lethal  i get it now 
shame on you 
we are trained to detect 
deter  observe  and report 
but one day  six years ago 
a man did more than that 
and i am that man 
we are that man 
and so i say to you  sir   
foot locker 
give me the gun  finish them 
go 
there s a lip on that carpet 
someone s gonna have to call
that in  get that changed  okay 
foot locker 
dad 
i m going to the helipad 
saul  help me  help me 
get back here 
what  what 
  oh  no 
  you couldn t stay out of the way  could you 
eduardo  i knew you
were part of this 
how is it a man like you
could win the heart
of a woman like divina 
what are you talking about 
my daughter s been kidnapped 
  come on  man 
  look 
we ll never get to them on time 
hey  blart  i heard you
need a little backup 
fun fact for you  there s
no helipad up here 
but there is over there 
got it 
we don t have much time 
  thanks  nick 
  no hard feelings 
hold on  paul 
oh  boy

knot jump 
coming in hot 
dad  come on 
hey 
you finish loading 
i ll finish this 
up you go  missy 
all right  guys  who
took my show hair 
i think maya s just
seen her future 
nice punch 
now  don t move 
you don t move 
looks like we got ourselves
a sticky situation 
that doesn t sound like something
that can be fixed here 
  you done 
  i am 
great  so am i 
oatmeal 
always bet on blart 
dad 
so paul blart hadn t
 officially peaked after all 
eduardo and i got
past our differences 
i told him that if he ever wanted
to go where the real action was 
there would always be a job for him
 at the west orange pavilion mall 
officer blart 
he turned me down immediately 
but i did get to meet
the man himself   
mr  wynn 
who was appreciative that i
saved his art collection 
very appreciative 
holy crawfish 
with ail things going my way  i figured
it was time to make a decision
that would change
my life forever 
paul 
you   
  look at me now 
  yeah  okay 
you are a fearless man 
a loving father  a strange 
misshapen superhero 
  thank you 
  and my heart is yours 
okay  divina  listen
very intently 
some people think that holding
on is what makes one strong 
but in reality 
our only power is in letting go 
but i love   
that s just it 
see  it s easy to fall in love  but
hard to find someone to catch you 
besides 
you don t love me 
  but i   
  what you love is the mystery 
that s all i am to you 
you know  i m a lone cowboy 
a renegade 
a rocky mountain steed 
but truth be told  divina 
i m none of those things 
i m a simple man 
now  the qualities you
seek  they re in him 
that man  sitting right over there 
that man 
just longing to catch    he s
crying right now  isn t he 
yep  he s crying 
that s a full on cry 
but he s the real deal  divina 
he swung in on a rope like
a knight in shining armor 
and he rescued my daughter
and me  and he loves you 
now  go to him 
go 
you re right 
but don t kid
yourself  paul blart 
you are a rocky mountain steed 
that actually felt really good 
i might have made a
colossal mistake 
colossal 
ladies and gentlemen 
to commemorate his long
career of undying loyalty 
honor  and acts of heroism 
above and beyond
the call of duty 
twice 
the security officers trade association
 is proud to bestow on officer paul blart
its highest
and  really  only award 
the safety medal of honor 
the road of life is hard 
but once you reach the
top  the view is amazing 
look  i ve given it
a lot of thought 
and i m gonna be really happy
at central jersey applied
technical junior college 
  really 
  yeah 
so they don t have
a football team
of a campus 
i mean  who cares 
the last couple of days really
reracked my priorities 
well  if you want to stay home
with me and keep me company 
maybe for a year or two until i
get settled  then i have to say 
i think you re crazy 
you re going to ucla 
and  besides   
holy crawfish 
that s exactly what i said 
i said that 
now  go  have fun 
not too much fun 
all right 
but as for this renegade  some
of us are meant to ride alone 
all by my  
what do we have here 
  hey 
  sorry 
you know what you just did 
you jaywalked in a
business district  sir 
actually  it s  officer  
i apologize 
i should ve recognized the steely eyed
gaze of a fellow brother in arms 
you re still giving me a ticket 
nope 
i m gonna give you
my phone number 
in case you want to
grab a drink sometime
