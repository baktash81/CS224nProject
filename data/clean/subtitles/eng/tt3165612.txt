to people named elaine 
elaine s great name 
  it s like  elaine  elaine   
  hey 
if you ever even mention the graduate
again  i will slit your throat 
okay  lainey  glad we got that cleared up 
welcome to my thursday night  huh 
you  uh    you wanna watch porn 
smoke drugs 
ugh  this sucks 
  mm 
  you know what i was gonna do tonight 
judging from your outfit 
i d say scale a mountain 
  lose my virginity 
  hold on a second   
you were gonna lose your
virginity to matthew sobvechik
in 11b at wein dormitory 
he s the ta in my pre med bio class 
i m deliberately failing to
get work sessions with him 
we fool around after he teaches
me things i already know 
jesus  how matthew sobvechik managed to bag
such a delightfully unhinged hottie
by being the most boring  fucking guy
on this entire floor is beyond me 
  well  i m in love with him 
  come on 
there s no way you love matthew sobvechik
the pontiac aztec of people 
lainey  you having sex
with matthew sobvechik
is basically the same thing
as me telling an aborigine
in the australian outback
that he s about to
listen to the beatles
for the first time  and then
i play him blues traveler 
that s a cruel joke  for i
will have just tricked him
into thinking blues traveler
is the greatest band of all time  okay 
now  if you were to sleep
with matthew sobvechik
you would be addicted to mediocrity
for the rest of your life 
and that barely
covered vagina of yours
deserves better than that 
it doesn t deserve john popper 
it deserves john lennon  okay 
you understand me 
i m talkin  about  like  the
 white album   not  hook  
tell me what sex is like 
oh  my god  you ve got a one track mind 
fuck you  enlighten me 
you want me to tell you
what sex is like  huh 
  mm hmm  tell me 
  okay 
better be ready 
  you ready 
  yes 
sex is like  uh   
it s like kissing with your entire body 
very sensual experience 
it s like shooting heroin
in a    in a controlled yet
moist environment  you know 
you know what it s like    it s
like    it s like times square at night 
i mean    just the right tinge of danger 
sorry 
oh  my god 
what 
yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  okay 
yeah  so i haven t technically   
   actually really done it yet 
why re you laughing at me  that s not   
but you re so old 
fuck you  i didn t call you an old virgin 
i m not    i m shocked 
i m shocked  you re so cute 
why re you giving me shit 
y you can t get the most boring dude
in the dorm to sleep with you 
you know    that    i
mean  that s ridiculous 
you re the one that s should be   
no  i m    i m sorry 
i    i m    i m   
i m sorry  i didn t mean to upset 
i thought    i was just joking around 
you know  i thought we were
joking around  so i was joking 
this was all  just very romantic
and then you just fucked it up 
it was 
what is this 
get it off 
jesus 
i m so  so sweaty  all this on   
you re incredible 
you re gonna drive some guy crazy some day 
     smile upon you   
  okay  alright 
  mm hmm 
  here we go 
  mm hmm 
  that girl s stuck in your head  
  let down your   
and make them stare  
  you know it s not too late     
hey  hey  hannah 
hannah 
   cause it s a thrill to give you  
  what you want  
  it s everything you dreamed of  
  what you want  
  i can remiss     
  what you want  
  if you just don t blow it  
  everything s going down  
  everything s blowing but
you just can t stop it   
  hannah 
  leave me alone 
  oh  come on  look  i could do this all the way to brooklyn   
  fuck you 
whoa  whoa  whoa  easy  easy 
hey  did you see me take out
that cab  sydney bristow style 
thank god you stopped 
okay  please  please   
  you re disgusting 
  i m    okay  maybe you re right 
  you might be right 
  how could you fuck her  jake 
i look  sorry  i    ow  ooh  that got me 
how could you even kiss
me after you fucked her 
what are we doing in
the middle of the street 
ugh  because i hope we fucking die 
will you get    whoa 
fuckin  please  come on 
let s get off the street  okay 
okay  look  look  look  look  look 
hey  hey  hey  hey  i appreciate
your anger  i really do  okay 
and lord knows  i could use the exercise
but i do believe there are exactly
3 points we should discuss  okay 
first off  in our initial
conversations about exclusivity
i distinctly recall you saying
something about  staying casual   yeah 
  i only said that   
  most likely because you thought
that was what i wanted to hear  yes 
  yes 
  okay  well  me taking you at your word
doesn t make me an asshole  it
does however make you a liar 
ugh  you re such a piece of shit   
hey  second    second point  okay 
if you really  actually wanted monogamy
why have casual sex
with me for three months 
you know  i mean  if you wanna grow
flowers  you don t plant  em in a closet 
so either you re stupid or deep down
inside you don t want monogamy either 
you fucked my best friend 
which brings me to my
third and final point 
your chief complaint is
not that i screwed someone
it is who i screwed 
that s what it s about  right 
so much like your  uh 
the counter intuitive plan
to secure an exclusive relationship
with a guy that you
don t actually wanna date 
moi  your issue with me and sarah   
  do not say her name 
  was a lot   
your issue with us is purely
driven by a societal insecurity 
not to mention  a culturally
infused female competition 
oh  my heart goes out to you ladies 
baby  you re a bad liar 
you re not stupid 
and she can t hold a candle to you 
can we please go home 
please 
you know  get out of these wet clothes 
and dry each other off using friction 
yeah 
  yeah 
  good 
whoa 
  you got a girlfriend  charles 
  no 
playing the field  hmm 
be careful 
  you know 
  why 
i don t know if i have time to answer that 
wow  bathroom fucking stinks 
um  what were we talking
about  so i said to jack 
i said   jack  lainey and
i  we re looking to buy 
maybe have a kid  
i hope it s okay that
i said that  by the way 
i mean  you haven t changed
your mind or anything  have you 
because i know you don t
wanna get married  but you know
i do think it s important we make
some sort of commitment to each other
and i think buying a
place  maybe kensington
maybe prospect heights 
what s up  little nugget  what
are you doing with the notebook 
sam  i have to read you something 
you ve been writing again 
  sweetie  that s great 
  no   
  i was never writing 
  honey  yes 
  it was one short story   
  yes  that is great 
no  listen  listen   
i wanna tell you something  look at me 
look at me  okay  i know you love teaching 
but that s not a real thing  i
mean  this is great  this is   
can you please just not interrupt
me while i read this  please 
  just listen to it  let me get through all of it 
  i won t 
i don t think i interrupt you  but go on 
  don t

  please don t interrupt 
  i would love to hear it 
  okay  mister 
  wow me

and romantic obsession

  i feel like

  i know  i would love to hear what you re telling me 
  sam 
  can you listen to what i m saying to you

relationship in an honest way

i m trying to get better 
you can t get better 
lainey  you re not an addict  okay 
you re just a whore 
you re a whore 
you re a fuckin  whore 
before i started this program
i thought  love  was a feeling 
but that s bullshit  it s not a feeling
it s a decision 
like everything else 
and i see now that when i was in
my addiction i made the decision
over and over again to choose
sex over my self worth 
and it doesn t mean that
i don t like sex now
it doesn t mean that i m
not a sexual person  gail 
i don t need to go trolling online looking
for women to go down on 
i don t need to fuck
8 guys on one night 
i don t deny what i ve
done  i embrace my past 
yes  i did once call one of my
neighbors in the middle of the day
when he was at work and said 
 grab some condoms and meet me
at that delicious soft
pretzel place   who cares 
i did let someone put a protein
bar up my ass once  big deal 
i did hack into my
supermarket s instagram account
and posted a picture of my asshole
and said  there was a sale on asshole

my asshole if you re bald

where do you find her 
some sort of  like  website
for people who want to have
a horrible  painful life   
i think i need to stop having
sex all together for a while 
no  alright  the problem isn t sex 
the problem is captain amazing
has monopolized your vag for like a decade
and now you re a pod person 
but maybe if i m not having any sex   
and become a sexually anorexic  no 
what  is that a real thing 
yeah  of course it s a real thing 
sexual anorexian  it s like
depriving yourself of sex
because of low self esteem 
or abuse or other gnarly shit 
that s great  that s another dysfunction
i have to worry about developing 
it s like enough with this shit 
sobvechik  it s like enough 
i mean  you can do so much better 
i don t care if it s a woman
or if it s somebody else
just anything but the schmuck 
i feel like people are looking at us 
the guy i lost my virginity to
was at my sex addicts meeting 
what do you think that means 
it s a sign 
you should fuck that guy  a lot 
i don t think everyone should just be
running around fucking willy nilly  okay

you should fuck that sex addict 
  one look in the mirror

then i ll come out and
we ll  uh    date it up 
matthew sobvechik  that guy had all
the charm of a broken etch a sketch 
it feels so freeing to tell someone
about it  who actually knows him 
okay  you re gonna have to explain
this to me  i mean  is he packing  huh 
is that what s going on 
does it tip in hundreds 
read you the polar express before bedtime 
you know  it s pretty average actually 
ah  goddammit  even his junk is boring 
god damn boring dick 
that s so weird  and
you re a catch  it s true 
you know  i m serious  you ve
got a strong vocabulary 
you look dynamite in a tank
top  it s just    what gives 
i guess   
i guess  i just thought
eventually he d choose me 
  mm hmm 
  and so i always chose him 
if he texted i d think of
an excuse  i d lie  i d   
  that s psychotic 
  mm  thanks 
well  i mean it s not your fault 
you know  little girls are told
that someday they re gonna find the one 
what they don t tell
you guys is that the one
might be a complete fucking dickhead
with a boring heroin penis that
turns you all into a sex addict
that s what they leave
out in the disney movies   
i m not sex addict 
oh  yeah  yeah  me neither 
i went to a few meetings
because my therapist suggested
that i go  that it    that it might help 
  but it didn t  so i stopped 
  okay 
what s your excuse 
  me 
  yeah 
my girlfriend said if i didn t go
she d break up with me 
so i went to a meeting 
she broke up with me anyway  i m cured 
  well why did she want you to go 
  i don t know 
she    some have suggested
that i have a little bit of
a problem staying faithful
for long periods of
time    or possibly at all 
oh  and it all comes out 
look  once i come to the
realization that i m with   
   the wrong girl   
  mm hmm 
  i don t know how to end it 
  so you sabotage it by sleeping with other people 
  mm  exactly 
yeah  obviously they get upset
but then comes the whole rigmarole
of  like   you re afraid to commit 
and it s like  no  i just
don t wanna commit to you  
but i can t say that  because
that s  like  mean on top of mean 
you know  so it s  no  no 
no  it s not you  it s me 
i don t like you  
  you know  like that 
  yeah  that s harsh 
  that s harsh  right you can t say that 
  that s pretty harsh 
so instead i d rather
just say something like   
 i fucked your sister  
  much better 
  well  it s honest 
you have to fuck the sister
in order for it to work 
  it s like i d rather   
  be the bad guy than tell the truth 
  see  you get it 
  oh  yeah  but i m psychotic 
but like an approachable psychotic 
  that s the thing i don t think i mentioned earlier 
  you like it 
yeah  it s like    it s
like ted bundy  you know 
you can t get him into a
van by just being a jerk 
you ve got to have a certain   
   way about you 
  appetite 
  that would be    that would be something 
  yes  yes  yes 
  i m hungry again

relationship we ve ever have 
i know  i    i right  i mean  and yet

so  maybe    we gotta just be friends 
yes  that is the mature 
responsible thing to do  uh   
   for each other and
ourselves  yes i agree 
okay  but then we ve got
to come up with a system 
  if we re gonna be friends  you know   
  okay 
  and i want to be good friends   
  it s fair 
so  maybe we come up with a safe word
for if we re having sexual tension
and then we ll stop whatever   
so  if you re doing something
sexy or i m doing something sexy 
  or feeling attracted 
  okay  but it s mutual 
  so it is mutual 
  the word 
you re saying it s mutual 
  it could be mutual 
  that s a yes

i m gonna teach you how
to finger yourself today 
right now  okay 
  what 
  it s    it s go time  sister 
  alright  let s go  alright 
  okay 
  no  no  this is a good thing 
  oh  boy 
it s about time  get it out 
  okay 
  i m excited 
for the purposes of today s tutorial
your vagina will be played by this
former bottle of green tea 
  looks just like it 
  okay  good to know 
so  here s what we do 
first thing  you take  uh  take this guy   
   this  uh  index finger
and you re gonna just  uh
slide in there    like that  okay 
and you re gonna curve it up a little bit
and i want you to tap the roof like that 
you see that  that s your g
spot alright  you got that 
  yeah  i ll check it out 
  okay  good 
alright  now  next move 
alright  you re gonna take
the middle finger here  alright 
and you know  the bad boy  right 
you re gonna have to pop that in as well
and you re gonna have
that one tapping the roof
and then this one  the
middle finger is going to be
you know  sort of circling  uh 
this  uh  just like fleshy gap area 
  my cervix  jesus 
  yeah  sure 
okay  y you know what it s
called  wonderful  good for you 
okay  yes  so you re gonna
go after the cervix here 
so you re gonna mind the
gap  right  tap the roof 
   mind the gap  tap the roof  
  you got it 
alright  now  at this point you wanna start
thinking about something  uh  arousing 
you know  like  uh  maybe
you wanna think about
the guy you lost your virginity to perhaps 
  gross 
  okay  and then you re gonna start to get wet 
you re gonna start to get wet
and then you re gonna
start to feel some  uh   
   contractions in your vagina  alright 
at that point you re gonna
wanna squeeze your vagina harder
than it wants to go  okay 
  and that s called   
  kegeling 
well  it s pronounced
 kee gul ing   but it doesn t matter 
uh  i got into med school 
i think i know how it s pronounced 
what  you did  you didn t tell me that 
oh yeah  i got in  uh  michigan 
  wow  lane  that s great 
  i know 
alright 
well  uh  are you    i mean  are

okay  yeah  da  da  da  okay  let s see 
so  uh  do you know what a dirty dj is 
  no 
  you don t  okay  great 
okay  so the biggest
misconception that guys
have about the clitoris 
uh  if they can find it
  is that they re too nice to it  okay 
  mm hmm 
like    that s the problem 
i mean  you know  the
trick is to be a little
rude to the clitoris  okay 
  oh  really 
  yeah 
just go to town on this
little motherfucker right here 
you just    like you
just    tweet  tweet  tweet 
you know  so that s the dirty dj 
you know  like you re scratching
a record  you know  this   
tweet tweet tweet 
let    let    let the drummer   
let    let    let the
drummer get wicked  right 
and you just really wanna
work that little bugger 
you know  remember like
the old ibm thinkpads 
  mm hmm 
  and that little nub  right 
okay  so you just really
go after it like that 
  just like this  yeah 
  yeah

that s    that s phase three 
  mm hmm

  natural  okay  yeah  so tap the roof 
  i know 
mind the gap  oh  see 
okay  yeah  work all three 
  he s there 
  look at that  it s like you re doing

anne sullivan teaching
helen keller about water and
everything else is amazing 
  what a breakthrough 
  mm hmm 
  yeah  that s it 
  like that 
yeah  you know  just take a night
crack open a bottle of rose and   
   just have multiple orgasms 
if you want  you know    you know   
uh  primatologists actually
believed that    that
women evolved this way so that  uh   
   they could mate with as many
men in one session as possible 
  fucking awesome  you know that s   
  yeah 
  that s neat 
  multiple orgasms for multiple partners  you know

to tell you all that 
i think it s sort of great 
i mean  he s    he s actually
dating  he s not cheating 
and i    and i hardly think
about matthew  like ever 
yeah   cause you re in a
relationship with each other 
no  we re not 
oh  you re not out there 
i mean  this jake guy
is taking up emotional
real estate that could be
occupied by a real option  okay 
you leased the space out to matthew 
rent free i might add 
and now  you    you just
replaced him with another
unavailable avoidant
breeder you don t fuck 
  like where s the fucking

fucked up thing you guys have   
  we re    we re best friends 
  no  we re best friends

  oh  yeah  mousetrap
  what the fuck is that 
  that was repartee 
  that s    that s exactly why i can t have you at the party 
because you have repartee with everybody 
you love repartee 
all you want to do is flit around the party
flirt with the moms 
and then they all get mad  and
then they turn on each other 
then they yell at naomi 
then naomi yells at me 
then they won t let their
kids play with my kids 
then i have to play with my kids
because my kids have no friends 
i m raising friendless
children because of you 
  do you understand 
  i   
it is a cascading shit
storm that is your creation 
a tremendous amount of malcolm
gladwellian logic jumps

   you might not become that creepy guy 
but he s got a point 
i m gonna be the creepy old dude 
like  that s sucks and then what happens
when my dick doesn t get
as hard as it used to  okay 
 cause that s gonna happen  it s
gonna happen  it s inevitable 
and    and young chicks
don t put up with that shit
they have no time for that 
and older women are gonna be
no way near into my nonsense  okay 
just not into it at all

i know that you stop
breathing when you kiss 
that when you lean in to
whisper  you put your lips
right up against the back of my earlobe 
that you kiss the back of my neck before
you slip my coat over my shoulders 
i remember every
compliment you ever gave me 
everything you ever did to me in bed 
and the day you made me yours 
the day you said   
    elaine  i wish i could have known you
 when you were a little girl 
so that i could ve been    
 could ve been your true love
