bearing the name of our land   
will descend from the heavens 
and save us all 
and here you are 
here to claim your throne 
 claim my throne

he was a king and a wizard  like you 
but she wanted the throne all to herself 
poor man

you got to come clean
for that innocent young girl 
i ll deal with her later 
as my new assistant  all you

he s just a
real  good  solid wizard  everyone 
the wizard  here he is

watching over it  awaiting your arrival 
much obliged 
praise be you are here at last   
and the prophecy shall be fulfilled 
this is a glorious day for us all 
and may i add  you re
as handsome a king as we ve ever had 
flatterer 
who is this fetching woman 
this is my sister 
i am evanora  the royal advisor 
i have been protecting the emerald city
whilst we awaited your arrival 
i am here to serve you 
as i served the king before you 
i look forward to being served 
sister  i like him already 
my sceptre 
yes  go on then  have a seat 
how does it feel 
fits like a glove 
goodness  knuck will show you
to your chambers   
and then we can chat more later 
can t wait  monkey  my bag 
yes  wizard  right away 
oh  great and powerful one 
thank you  sourpuss 
my name is knuck 
isn t he wonderful 
didn t i say he would come 
you dare escort that oaf in here   
and allow him
to climb on the hallowed throne 
and why not  he is the wizard 
 the wizard   or so he says 
did it not occur to you   
that he might be an imposter
in league with the wicked witch   
and sent here to kill us 
the wicked witch  don t be ridiculous 
i m not the one who s
underestimating her cleverness 
or maybe it s you i m underestimating 
have you finally joined her side  sister 
i am on no one s side  you know that 
i simply want peace 
it s all i ever wanted 
and the wizard can do that 
he s a good man 
what do you know about goodness 
deep down  you are wicked 
i am not wicked 
that temper really is wasted on you 
do you honestly think   
that i could conspire against you with her 
you are my sister and i love you 
all right 
but i do need proof
that he is who he claims to be 
but he has already proven himself 
not to me  he hasn t 
thank you for the tour 
it s my job 
giving tours 
taking care of the king 
of course  and on that note   
i was thinking it might be nice
to have a royal feast 
maybe a grand roast 
my sister has been telling me
that your magic is really quite powerful 
really 
yes  boggling to the minds
of all who witness it 
i do wish i could see it for myself 
yes 
why not show me now 
  now 
  here 
all things in good time 
and a good time for all things 
so wise  so true 
well  there is one last room
that i would like you to see 
the royal treasure of oz 
it belongs to whoever is king 
it s all right  wizard 
go and enjoy your riches 
it s mine 
mine 
no more second hand suits for you 
baby 
nothing but the silks and satins 
ali baba 
and one of these things  what is this 
a chalice 
a chalice 
i ve always wanted a chalice 
and now i ve got one 
well  not quite yet 
you see  you only become the king
after you defeat the wicked witch 
that s the prophecy 
and since you haven t done that yet 
you re not   
i m not actually king 
not yet  no 
you still have to
get rid of the wicked witch 
right 
and killing her won t be easy 
no  i don t suppose it will be 
wait a minute 
no one said anything about killing anybody 
if you re not interested in being king 
that s all right with me 
we can just forget about the whole thing 
the gold and the rubies  the chalice 
i m interested 
i m just not too keen on killing a lady 
she s not a lady 
she s a wicked witch 
and your magic is the only thing
strong enough to destroy her 
all you have to do is journey to
the dark forest and destroy her wand 
  her wand 
  yes 
it s the source of all her power 
without it  she dies 
i haven t even said goodbye
to theodora  she will be upset 
i will talk to her in the morning 
i will tell her how much you love her   
no 
no  don t say anything 
all right  i will say
whatever it is you want me to say   
but are you going to save us all or not 
i m your wizard 
we re really gonna do this 
how hard could it be
to kill a wicked witch 
hard  really hard 
it s very  very hard
to kill a wicked witch 
and what about that poor girl
back there  i think she really liked you 
she ll get over me  they always do 
she s a pretty young witch 
there ll be plenty of wizards
knocking at her door 
every lie you tell gets us one step
closer to the emerald city dungeon 
then don t think of them as lies 
think of them as stepping stones
on the road to greatness 
wait  i got it 
we ll turn around and go back 
you ll come clean 
you apologise for lying about being the
wizard and for lying to that poor girl 
you gotta really seem contrite 
you gotta sell it 
maybe you could even cry 
can you cry 
i could cut up an onion 
we re not going back 
we re gonna find this wicked witch 
steal her wand   
i ll get that big pile of gold   
and you can have
a nice pile of bananas  all right 
bananas 
i see 
because i m a monkey 
i must love bananas  right 
that is a vicious stereotype 
  you don t like bananas 
  of course i love bananas 
i m a monkey  don t be ridiculous 
i just don t like you saying it 
how about this 
we offer to wash all the windows
in the emerald city   
for an entire year 
they d have to forgive us 
or we could give them a little help
with their infrastructure 
i noticed some yellow brick potholes
back there 
that looks bad 
we re not going down there 
someone might need our help 
not that you care 
get back here  you get back here 
we gotta get the wicked witch 
what are we doing over here

i can still feel his body
pressed against mine 
sister  you were right about him 
he is the great wizard 
he must be  to make me feel the way i feel 
oh  no

he said i would be his queen 
did he 
are you quite sure
it wasn t you who said it to him 
you fool 
serves you right 
i want glinda and that wizard
torn to shreds 
do not fail me a second time 
fly 
on the day my father died 
we lost a kind and noble leader 
and a dark shadow
was cast across this land 
i ve had to stand alone against evanora
and watch   
as towns were destroyed 
children were orphaned   
and my heart was broken 
i ve been unable to protect
the good people of oz by myself 
with only faith in my father s prophecy 
i ve waited 
for you   
great wizard from kansas 
to come and set things right 
so  that s the prophecy 
you see  when i agreed to be king   
i didn t realise
how complicated all of this was 
she knows 
what 
evanora knows you know the truth now 
look 
oh  no

wizard  now is the time 
the time 
use your magic

hey  is that a wall 
of sorts 
it repels our enemies
and protects us from harm 
but we re headed straight for it 
yes  we are 
and going very fast 
how do you   
does this thing have any brakes 
i m going too fast  i m gonna die 
you needn t worry  wizard 
it s a magic wall 
and all good hearted souls
get to pass through 
i m gonna die 
wanda 
it s beautiful 
they ve waited a long time for you  wizard 
all hail the great and powerful oz 
hail 
thank you 
wow  you re a wonderful crowd 
you put the  merry  back in
 the merry land of oz  
hi  what s your name 
you re very beautiful 
thank you 
girls  listen  i am not a toy 
i am not a toy 
oz  oz 
hello 
what  no fireworks 
what are fireworks 
remind me to show you sometime 
glinda  i didn t know
if you d like these  or these 
they re both so beautiful 
i couldn t possibly decide 
we need your help  wizard 
please save us 
you know  i should tell you   
i might not actually be a wizard 
yes  i know 
oh 
at least  not any kind of wizard
we were expecting 
you could tell 
yes 
i can also tell you re weak  selfish   
slightly egotistical and a fibber 
i see 
anything you don t know about me 
whether or not you ll save my people 
no  i just told you i m not the wizard 
but they don t know that 
if you can make them believe 
then you re wizard enough 
these are desperate times  after all 
can you make them believe 
will i still get that gold 
good people of oz 
your wizard is here 
what s the matter  sister 
look at how happy they are 
do you think she ll be his queen 
of course she ll be his queen 
what did you expect 
you can t compete with glinda s charms 
no one can 
oh  god  sister  it hurts 
such is a broken heart 
your precious wizard did that to you 
make it stop 
would you like me to 
one bite is all it takes 
one bite and your world
will change forever 
one bite and your heart
will become impenetrable 
one bite and you and i
will finally share the throne 
unless you d rather see
oz and glinda there 
you re the wicked one  not glinda 
sister  you lied to me 
it s nice  isn t it 
how clear everything becomes 
what is happening to me 
it s just your heart withering away 
fear not  theodora   
for soon you will feel
nothing at all except   
beautiful wickedness 
sister 
sister  you re hideous 
i can cast a simple enchantment   
and have you looking
just the way you were before 
no 
this is who i am now 
i want him to see me like this 
i want him to know that he was the one
who made me this way 
oh  dear 
it s imperative that you behave like
the great leader that they think you are 
morale is essential if we have
any hope of defeating evanora 
and i assume you have a plan 
no 
you have a plan 
you re going to lead us into battle
and take back the throne 
and do we have an army to help do this 
of sorts 
the quadlings  your highness 
you re soldiers 
no  sir  farmers  mostly 
farmers 
but you can fight 
no  sir  many of us can hoe 
oh  you can hoe 
  and i can work with iron 
  that s good 
  i bake bread 
  yummy 
  i can sew 
  not so helpful 
i can make a scarecrow 
that ll come in handy 
it might 
and these are the tinkers 
are you kidding me 
we re tougher than we look  wizard 
what they lack in stamina 
the tinkers make up for in ingenuity 
they can build anything 
and i ll tell you what else 
we can build anything 
yeah  i got it 
and we re prepared
to storm the emerald city 
if you don t keel over on the way there 
and  finally  the munchkins 
please tell me you gentlemen can fight 
no 
but we make pretty clothes 
also  we sing 
no  that won t be necessary 
i like it  i think it s cute 
i hope you like it 
the prophecy was clear
the wind would bring you here
and so it was a man named oz
would magically appear
all right  enough 
so  sound the battle call
the wicked witch will fall
and so it is the wondrous wiz
will come to save us all
all right  that s enough 
munchkins  stop 
they do make beautiful clothes 
all right 
now  listen  wanda 
glinda 
guys  take five 
glinda  these are all very lovely people 
but do you honestly believe   
that they can kill a wicked witch
and an army of flying baboons 
i don t expect them to kill anyone 
what do you mean 
i mean the good people of oz
are forbidden to kill 
forbidden to   
you want me to lead
an army that can t kill 
if this was easy 
we wouldn t need a wizard  would we 
something s wrong 
  look 
  what is that 
  the wall 
  what s happening 
the wicked witch isn t powerful
enough to get through the wall 
it looks like she s managing 
not by herself  she isn t 
what does that mean 
is someone helping her 
everyone  take cover 
run quickly  take cover 
get the children to safety 
run 
glinda 
there s so much good here 
it sickens me 
still think your wizard can save you
from the likes of me 
speak up  or i will tear out your tongue 
now  who is that 
don t you recognise me  wizard 
have i changed so much 
theodora 
may i have this dance 
hey  hey 
i get it  you re a little upset 
theodora  stop  you re hurting him 
theodora  what happened to you 
you happened to me 
this isn t you 
it s your sister 
she s worked her magic on you 
i d hoped you d be able to see through her 
glinda  so naive 
just like your father 
that s why it was so easy
for my sister to kill him 
she only killed a man 
not what he believed in 
begone  witch 
before the wizard makes mush of you 
how sweet 
you all believe in him 
well  so did i  once 
and as for you   
my pretty one 
when i return with
my sister and her army   
the yellow brick road
will be red with the blood   
of every tinker  farmer and munchkin
in your kingdom 
you underestimate us  theodora 
we are a strong and united people 
and now the wizard is here to lead us 
and as for your wizard   
he will be the first to die 
and you will all see
that he is nothing but a deceitful   
selfish and extremely mortal man 
give me that 
it was a broom that you wanted 
wasn t it  wizard 
it s all right 
it s all right 
she s gone now  don t be frightened 
now that the wizard is with us   
wizard 
leaving 
but you promised to help us 
yeah  well  that was
before i knew what we were up against 
an army and yet another wicked witch 
this one bent on destroying everyone 
especially me 
we can defeat them 
there must be something 
something we haven t thought of 
something that we re not seeing 
something we re just on the verge of 
glinda 
you need a real wizard 
better yet  a general 
but you re all i have 
so  you re not the wizard i was expecting 
so  you don t have the powers
i thought you d have 
but you re here 
there must be a reason 
maybe you re capable of more than you know 
glinda  i wish i had the answer 
but i m just a con man 
i m a carnival magician 
i m just not the man you want me to be 
someone needs to tuck me in 
yes  of course 
allow me 
my papa used to do it 
i see 
perhaps you d prefer the wizard  then 
yes  please 
all right 
in you go 
here you are 
just a moment 
bring forth the covers now 
yes  ma am 
comfy 
goodnight 
do you grant wishes 
do i what 
grant wishes 
the old wizard could grant wishes 
people would travel to the emerald city
and ask him for things 
and if they were good and noble wishes   
he would grant them 
is that right 
do you know what i d wish for 
a pretty dress 
to have my family back 
i know 
i m sorry 
i can t grant wishes 
i m not that kind of wizard 
that s what i thought 
you see  where i come from 
there aren t any real wizards 
although  there is one 
thomas alva edison 
the wizard of menlo park 
a truly great man 
did he grant wishes 
no 
but he could look into the future
and make it real 
he created the electric light 
the phonograph 
he created a camera
that could take moving pictures 
pictures that move 
yeah  can you imagine 
and all he had was a little bit of wire
and some glass 
with almost nothing 
he made the impossible real 
is that the kind of wizard you are 
it s the kind of wizard i d like to be 
you are that kind  i can tell 
i d rather you grant wishes 
but that s a good wizard  too 
goodnight  wizard 
glinda  i ve got it 
what have you got 
i ve got a way out of this mess 
  what is this 
  a battle plan 
it s all in there 
illusion  misdirect  sleight of hand 
look   
i know i m not the wizard
that you were expecting   
but i might just be
the wizard that you need 
you said you were just a con man 
precisely 
nothing but a trickster 
yes 
a terrible cheat 
the best there is 
the carnival magician s
going to put on a show 
i ll put on the show of a lifetime 
the likes of which
the land of oz has never seen 
magic  mystery  prestidigitation 
it ll be my greatest trick yet 
tinkers  gather around 
quickly  now 
this is what you re gonna build 
where i come from 
this is called a praxinoscope 
although  i ve made a few modifications 
it allows you to project
an image into space 
impossible 
nothing s impossible
if you put your mind to it 
  bully 
  bully 
these three roads
all lead to the emerald city 
to the east are the deadly poppy fields 
we ll have to steer clear of them 
why is that 
one good whiff and it s everlasting sleep 
and we re not exactly
a terrifying army when we re awake 
all right  we ll steer clear 
or maybe not 
in the conjuring business 
flash is always good 
gives the audience a little  wow  
you gentlemen will be combining
sulphur rock  nitrate of pot ash   
and charcoal to create
what is commonly known   
as black powder 
mr quimby  we need 200 bales of hay
delivered to the main road by noon 
mr zim  have the quadling carts   
looks good 
my very own winkie guards   
soon you will be facing glinda
and her army of weaklings 
and when they see our towering might   
they will run and flee for the hills and   
no 
we shall not let them flee 
we shall show them no mercy 
now  i ve added this adjustable lens
to your design   
along with a few other things 
have a look 
yes  edison himself would be proud 
now  there s something else
i need you to do 
but i d rather you just keep it between us 
yes 
do you know how to build a hot air balloon 
this is all very impressive   
but you still haven t told me how you plan
to get this thing into the emerald city 
relax  i know someone 
what do you mean you know someone 
hello  wizard 
well  well  well 
if it isn t old sourpuss 
my name is knuck 
now  you two be nice to each other 
  let s move it  wizard 
  can you give me a break 
i ll break your nose 
guess i m up 
time to do what i do  right 
cue the con man 
would you stop 
a con man couldn t have done all this 
you re much more than that 
well  then  it looks like
i ve got you fooled  too 
the only person you ve got fooled
is yourself 
for protection 
not that you need it 
great people of oz 
today we fight to free the land
from the villainy of the wicked witches 
we are few   
but we are mighty 
quadlings 
  tinkers 
  bully 
munchkins 
we face great odds 
but we are armed with our courage   
our hard work and most of all   
our faith in one another 
we have nothing to fear
as long as we believe 
for when we do believe   
anything is possible 
onward 
halt 
good day there  fellow winkie guardsman

the citizens of emerald city
will not tolerate this 
we will not 
silence 
silence 
what should i do now 
i d get your sister and fly out of here 
really 
while you still can 
i think i m going to do
something quite different   
and i m going to do it   
very  very slowly  because   
i just can t take the sight of that
pretty  pretty face 
i m going to wipe out your light   
until there is nothing left
but my darkness 
i have been waiting for this
for a long time 
oh  no 
he said it was going to be
his greatest trick yet 
did he tell you the trick was on us 
how predictable 
i knew that buffoon of yours
couldn t be the wizard 
out of my way 
give up  glinda 
why do you continue to resist 
because i believe in the wizard 
so did i  once 
behold 
look 
your wizard 
where is he going 
he s abandoning us 
how could he 
no 
no 
not so great and powerful after all 
you  there  move back

i thought you were dead 
you were crying pretty hard 
was that for me 
no  some of the smoke got in my eyes 
right 
wow  you fooled everybody 
that was your greatest trick yet 
that was just the opening act 
let this be the final word 
your prophecy is dead 
like the king who spoke it 
and the wizard who tried to fulfil it 
all dead 
it s showtime 
and they will be joined in death
by glinda the good 
farewell 
say hello to your daddy for me

they deserve that 
what s the matter  glinda 
out of bubbles

from the great wizard himself 
 with little more than pluck and belief   
 we made the impossible happen 
 as your wizard  i hereby decree

at the woman you ve become 
zim zallah bim
