there were once two people
called mary and jemima 
they spent their days
telling stories to each other 
and then one day 
their mother and father
were kidnapped
by the evil demon ravana   
   leaving them all alone 
as i understand it  her mother was
struck down with cholera very suddenly 
her father rushed her mother
to hospital 
she died that night 
her father the following morning 
she can t stay here 
well  she has
an uncle in england 
we ll send her back
with the other children 
it s disgusting 
then you re gonna be
very hungry 
i never said
you could do that 
you didn t say i couldn t 
if you weren t eating it  i will 
you don t understand 
i need better food than this 
my parents are dead 
we ve all lost  girl 
would you
like to hear a story 
no  i m not a kid 
there once
was a lord of the seas 
his name was varuna  and   
he   
i m not a kid 
you are a plain little
piece of goods  aren t you 
don t expect luxury 
misselthwaite is not

hospital in the war  left it a wreck 
don t you care 
does it matter
if i care or not 
you are an odd duck  aren t you 
is that the sea 
no  it s the moors 
nothing lives on
but wild ponies and sheep 
and there you have it 
that s home 
that s misselthwaite 
and don t expect him
to come running  your uncle 
he s had better days 
and you re not to stare
when you see what afflicts him 
first things first 
we are fully electric 
that doesn t mean
the electric always works 
so  if you re needing the lavatory
in the night  you take a lamp 
secondly  mr  craven is
a widower and on his own 
he s promised he ll have someone
to tend to you soon enough 
but until then  don t be expecting

 cause there won t 
i need no entertaining

what rooms you can go into 
and what rooms
you re to keep out of 
but until then  you stick to
your rooms and your rooms only

me mother always says she can t
see why grand people s children
didn t turn out to be fools 
what with being washed and dressed
and took out to walk
as if they were puppies 
and there i was  excited to
have a young  un in the house 
it doesn t matter 
this is of no importance 
we can t just leave them
all piled up like this

so you re the one
that cries at night 
i thought this cursed house
was magic   
you think the house cursed 
by all the soldiers
that died here 
no  the curse came
before the war 
the reason they say
this house is cursed
is because it killed my mother
and tried to kill me 
my mother s dead too 
and i killed her 
did you really 
well  then we both
know tragedy    don t we 
daddy 
wake up  girl 
the master wants to see you

my mother would say you do
as little as fast as you can 
i have decided
that i like your mother 
you ve never met her  eat 
i like your brother dickon too 
and i have met him 
well  i would have  but he backed away 
i ve seen him  at least 
dickon has problems enough of his
own without you to bother him 
don t worry  he won t like me 
no one does 
and how do you
like yourself

now  when he speaks to you 
you answer back with a  sir  
do you understand 
yes  mrs  medlock 
and if he wants to look at you 
you let him look 
but don t stare back 
and say nothing fanciful

i want to play
out of doors 
it was too hot
to do so in india 
i m obliged by law
to have you taught

misselthwaite  one way or another

i m afraid i can t 
you ve seen my father s hunchback 
well  mine is worse 
i ve never been able to walk 
shall we use the chair
to explore  i can push   
your cousin is dying 
you don t look like
someone who s dying 
and how many dying people
have you seen 
we could go outside and  who
knows  you might feel better 
once they tried
to take me outside 
and the stench of the roses
almost killed me 
you re afraid of flowers 
that isn t very sensible 
what if i were to tell you
that i know of a magical place 
where the birds
sing for you
and a friendly dog
plays with you 
i d say that you were lying 
and i m not interested 
even if you are
telling the truth 
but   
i m tired now  you can go 
what 
i m tired 
you re not listening to me 
please leave 
i m not your play toy to be
put down when you choose 
you came to me 
i never invited you in 
i told you secrets
about my magic place 
secrets i didn t care
to know of 
now get off my bed
and leave me alone 
is that your mother 
you were leaving 
they say i look like her 
i hate her for doing it 
dying 
hate her 
my mother loved me hugely 
everyone said so 
and then she died 
leaving me all alone 
it s unforgivable 
well  my mother
never loved me 
will you read to me 
as i try to fall asleep 
i struggle to sleep 
i know   
i ll tell you a story
about gods
and a quarrel
over who first made fire 
that sounds terrible

what are you laughing about 
you might be the rudest boy
i ve ever met 
perfectly all right 
but you ve not eaten anything 
please don t fuss 
martha  can you tell me
about my aunt grace 
your mother didn t talk
of her sister at all 
she never talked of england 
thick as thieves  they were 
the crying i heard
when it was announced
your father
was to be posted to india 
i served at the last ball
they had here 
to see them dance   
this house
was filled with light 
laughter  happiness 
your poor mother 
i don t know how
she coped to lose her 
i don t think
she ever recovered 
mummy 
i have a new story for you

your sister to box your ears   
my sister loves me
much more than you 
she won t love you so much when she
knows you re poaching on the moor 
poaching 
i were not 
you ran from me 
that says guilt 
guilt for what you did
to my jemima 
i m not sure your dog
would like the name jemima 
being as he s a boy 
a boy  it doesn t matter 
his paw was trapped
in a horror trap 
tell me where i d find him 
why should i trust you 
i know how
to make him better 
trust that 
i need you to keep a secret 
on my honor i ll keep it 
why have you
just spat on yourself 
you spit too  then we shake 
then we re bonded 
if you re too much of a lady  then there s no   
i m no lady  sir 
and it s my secret 
so you re to keep it

to help with the dog 
wow

this was all a trick 
if we don t see to this now 
he ll lose his leg

nothing s broken 
but it looks like it s going rotten 
is there running water here 
that s really good  that

fixed anything 
you ve made it worse 
just give it time

we re hoping the garden
will magic him well 
come morning 
we ll have an answer 
it has a lake  you wouldn t call it a
lake  but a pond maybe  and a stream 
now  promise to spit 
you may need to educate me
on how to spit 
surprisingly simple 
i ve spit
and i won t tell a soul 
now  tell me everything

i said i d heard you 
they said you d lost
both your parents tragically 
they were very clear
you weren t a murderess 
do you trust me 
i ve something to show you 
why would i trust you 
you ll damage my back 
i wished her death 
and it happened 
i m absolutely her murderer 
okay  fine  i believe you 
but if you take me to that
garden  you ll murder me too

they re inside
the secret garden 
don t be afraid  look 
  and we re there too 
  no 
i ve been
to misselthwaite before 
so we did know of each other 
isn t that extraordinary 
and do you know
what s even more extraordinary

this is just jealousy
because my mother loved me 
well  you don t deserve
a mother s love 
colin  are you okay 
where does it hurt

at this hour 
i ll take care of it  mrs  medlock

i ll take the arms 
or    we can get you
in the chair

i promise you
we won t kill you 
you can t promise

he wants to say hello 
i can see 
  he took it from my hand 
  he did 
  and now he s licking my hand 
  he does that 
it tickles 
he s not diseased 
not that we ve seen 
what s his name 
he was called jemima 
till she knew different 
now he s    dog 
he needs a better name than that 
perhaps we should   
what s your father called 
marcus  can we not
name him after him 
we should not name him
after my father either 
my father was called hector 
and he was a brave man 
was 
settled  hector 
mary and dickon
you know already 
well  i m colin 
and i m your new friend 
oh 
you think
you just can sneak about
and act how you like 
don t you 
little savage girl 
i knew
you were hiding something 
you and your secret ways
and your    deviance 
mrs  medlock  whatever you think
i ve been doing  i promise   
thieving 
that the sort
of barbarous behavior
you learnt out there 
is it 
where did you find them 
underneath a floorboard 
where are you taking me 
you understand these pearls
mean something to me 
i m sorry 
she s been everywhere 
to the boy too 
his wheelchair was skew whiff
when i went in this morning 
it s this roused my suspicions 
she s found my son too 
have we just given her
the full run of the house 
i warned you
what a young girl could do 
was it not explained to you to stay
away from the parts of the house
that were not yours
to roam in 
colin is my friend 
i just thought that if i
could excite him about life   
your excitement could kill him 
do you think he wants that 
oh  what have you done 
mrs  medlock 
let s look into finding
a school for my niece 
please 
i was trying
to make things better 
find somewhere to
educate some civility into her 
you locked me in 
if you ll be
needing the lavatory in the night 
you ll find we ve provided you
with a chamber pot 
it s under the bed 
martha will let you out
in the morning 
hey  where are you going  girl 
mary 
follow me 
mary  what s wrong 
there are even more secrets
to this garden 
so colin s mother
was dying 
yes 
and you think
she came here 
my mother came to be with her in
the last days of grace s illness 
knowing that she wanted to die
by this tree 
after which  mr  craven   
he shut the garden away because
memories of her caused too much pain 
we don t have long 
they re sending me to school 
no 
this is grace s garden 
and it needs to cure her son 
it s cold 
it s very  very cold 
i don t think i can 
course you can 
i don t think i can 
we ve got you 
i suppose it s not so freezing 
that s the way 
i ve done it  i ve done it 
now hold your arms out
and lie back 
and now   
you re on your own 
done  over there  please 
what are you
laughing about 
just enjoying
your happiness 
we re all happy  aren t we 
we are pirates 
we re lords 
we re conquerors
of this fair and beautiful land 
this is our garden
and we love it 
no 
it s not our garden 
and it never can be 
there s something
i have to show you 
stop  stop 
you know
what happened here  then 
why would you
bring me here 
because you needed to see it 
would you like to see the
place your mother died 
my mother died in a hospital 
alone and in pain 
your mother
found a far better spot 
dickon  can you
fetch me some flowers 
the white ones 
and then can you take me home 
i don t want to be here 
you don t understand 
she died here
because it was beautiful 
and so she made
this place magical 
it cured hector s leg  and i   
i didn t want to see the dresses
and i don t want to see this 
please  take me home 
oof  hello  monkey 
is something troubling you 
your mother   
is sad at the moment 
her sadness
has made her unwell 
it s not her fault 
i m sorry 
i didn t understand 
not today 
colin  i ve found these
letters from my mother to your mother 
i don t want you today 
all about you 
and i don t want
that garden 
you need to hear this 
they talk about how your father
is focusing all his fears
about your mother s illness
onto you 
how he seems set on
protecting you from the world 
and she s scared   
of the damage he ll
do to you when she s gone 
should you be   
i need to read those letters 
you walked 
listen to this 
 she s bold  slightly dangerous 
and she has a spirit
that nothing can quench 
i d be scared for her
if i wasn t so proud of her  
who s bold 
she loved you  mary 
she wanted me nowhere near her 
maybe that s   
 i m so pleased colin
is making you laugh so 
a whole day
pretending to be a dog 
what a delight  
a dog  was it 
 archie sounds deeper in love
than i ve ever heard a man 
he s just as besotted
as i am with mary  
my father wants me
locked in a room 
that s the thing  isn t it 
loss changes people 
even your mother  mary 
you don t know my mother 
but i know
what it means to lose someone 
listen to this one  mary 
 she did a puppet show for me
the night before last 
an elaborate affair
that required ayah
to make some silk curtains 
she told this

there were once some people
who lived in an old  deserted house 
partially deserted 
and they
discovered a garden 
one of the people
discovered a garden
and they didn t know it
