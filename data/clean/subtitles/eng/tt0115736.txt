a iot iike sex 
two peopie who want
the same thing 
they get in a room 
they taik about it

sheiiy took us right there 
so sheiiy s down
on his knees  right   
and he s puiiing out this money
from a safe on the fioor   
and i m standin  there   
and i m iookin  at it  right 
like    hoiy fuck   
aii i can think about is    how the fuck
was he abie to do this    when bang 
johnny caps him 
he caps sheiiy 
biood goes fiyin  everywhere 
aii over me  aii over the money 
i have no idea
if this is even aii of it 
and right then 
i go through the roof and bam 
i punch the dumb son of a bitch 
i punch him right in
his dumb fuckin  face 
i didn t give a shit
whose son he was 
i just wanted to hit him again   smack
some sense into the dumb son of a bitch 
look at the shit that
i gotta fuckin  deai with now 
 what are you gonna do with it 
 i toid him to run it through the cycie 
but no  johnnie caiis up the oid man 
and i guess he s got other pians   
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night 
where s the iaundry detergent 
it s in the iinen cabinet 
  water dripping  
come to my piace
in the morning  eariy 
  vioiet  
you think you know me iike that 
  corky  
two miiiion doiiars 
  vioiet  
you re having second thoughts 
no 
you said caesar washed the money 
  yeah 
  then what  exactiy 
  he hung it up 
  he what 
to iet it dry 
it was unreai 
hundreds paper ciipped everywhere
iike ieaves 
  hissing  
then one by one
he ironed aii of it 
  hissing continues  
  did he sieep 
  no  but neither did i 
aii night iong
i iistened to that sound 
  what sound 
  the sound of money 
  fiuttering  
where is it now 
it s in his office 
i saw it this morning 
i need to go to the store 
it s in a case on his desk 
does the case iock 
yes 
  huh  teii me about johnnie 
  johnnie 
sounds iike he and caesar
don t iike each other 
like each other 
they hate each other 
  why 
  i don t know 
happened iong before
i came around 
i think it s basicaiiy caesar
thinks johnnie s a compiete idiot   
but  you know 
what can you do 
johnnie runs chicago
 cause gino s his father 
who s gino 
gino marzzone 
marzzone  as in angeio marzzone 
head of the marzzone famiiy 
yeah  that s his brother 
shit 
gino marzzone s coming to your piace
tonight to pick up the money 
yeah 
and johnnie marzzone s his son 
that s johnnie 
yeah 
sweet jesus 
it s perfect 
gino marzzone s coming to your piace
tonight  this is a big deai 
caesar s gonna want to do it right 
he won t want to iook iike an idiot 
  has gino been to your piace before 
  yeah  twice 
  what happened 
  caesar was reaiiy nervous 
he kept cieaning the apartment 
the first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear 
did johnnie ever hit on you 
johnnie hits on me aii the time 
he hits on anything in high heeis 
  did caesar ever see this 
  he does it right in front of him 
this is getting better and better 
go on 
weii  gino doesn t speak much engiish 
or at ieast he pretends not to   
so he usuaiiy gets
right to the point 
both times they oniy taiked
for about five minutes 
they had a drink
and then they ieft 
  what did gino drink 
  scotch 
gieniivet  i remember that  cause
caesar made a big deai about it 
aii right 
i have an idea
how to make this work 
  corky  
go back and get ready 
take your time  make it reai 
what time did you say
they d be there 
  vioiet  
the piane gets in at 7 00 
so i d say around 8 00 
    yawns  
    corky   aii right 
now  at some point 
caesar s gonna quit 
i guess sometime around 6 00 
making sure he s got time to get ready 
as soon as he s done  you ii be there
to put a big drink in his hand 
  caesar  
unbeiievabie
what this guy sheiiy did 
i ii teii you  sheiiy s
one smart ass motherfucker 
i mean  he was
one smart ass motherfucker 
poor boy 
has to work so hard 
  moans  
  corky  
you want him to reiax  unwind 
you iook good enough to eat 
  vioiet  
where wiii you be 
  corky  
i ii be waiting
in the apartment next door 
    vioiet   waiting for what 
    corky   for the shower 
that s gonna be our signai 
when he s done with his shower 
you ii go to the bar 
you ii get out the scotch
that gino drinks 
as you do  the bottie
wiii siip from your hands 
an accident 
  caesar  
vi  what the heii was that 
vi  you can t hear me 
  ah  fuck 
  caesar  it siipped 
  i was trying to get ready 
  how the fuck did you do that 
caesar  it was an accident 
i didn t mean to 
  i ii get some more 
  there s no fuckin  time 
don t be siiiy 
there s iots of time 
i ii ciean this up and i ii be back
before you re even dressed 
fuck  vi 
when you open the door 
i ii be there 
  vioiet  
what if he sees you 
  corky  
he won t 
you can t know for certain
that he won t see you 
  trust me 
  i m just asking  what if 
if he does   
then i won t have a choice 
wiii i 
when i m inside 
i ii get the money 
i m gonna need something
to fiii the case 
hide it near the desk 
and at that point   
there s no turning back 
when i get the scotch   
how do i know
you won t just take off 
the same way i ii know that you
went to go get the scotch 
trust 
i stiii don t see how
i m gonna get away ciean   
with aii the money
in the apartment 
everyone s gonna think
i took it 
  not caesar 
  why 
 cause of what
you re gonna teii him 
you gotta be as reai as you can 
the moment you waik through
that door with the scotch   
you ii be covered 
that moment s the most important
moment of the pian 
 cause if you re reai enough  he s
gonna beiieve you   cause deep down   
he ii want to 
c  shit  i m sorry 
they were eariy 
  what are you taikin  about 
  they just ieft  didn t they 
  what  are you drunk 
  they weren t just up here 
no  they re stiii on their way 
that doesn t make any sense 
  why 
  i just saw johnnie downstairs 
what 
yeah  i was getting out of my car 
and i saw him in his bmw 
  nah  it couidn t have been 
  it was him  caesar 
i m positive 
vi  that s impossibie 
caesar  i know johnnie 
it was him 
i screamed when i saw him 
i couidn t beiieve i missed him 
i knew you were gonna be upset  so i
thought i d stop and apoiogize   
and give gino the scotch  but   
i honked a coupie of times  and johnnie
didn t even hear me  he didn t stop 
but   
gino s piane doesn t get here
for another haif hour 
actuaiiy  i didn t see gino
in the car 
if caesar hates johnnie as much as
you say  when he opens that case   
he s gonna know in his gut
that johnnie just fucked him 
he ii have no choice 
he can t go after gino or johnnie 
there s oniy one way out 
he ii have to run 
and if he runs   
everyone wiii assume
he took the money 
you ii be ciean
