  man  jj 
  way to go  killer 
  thank you 
the man  the myth 
oh  man 
bobbi ulf  tech support 
can i just say 
it s an honour to meet you 
i have read every page
of your case file
and it s a page turner 
like  fifty shades of amazing  
kim needs to see you asap
for the debrief 
  you got it 
  awesome  awesome 
have a good day 
whoops 
well  kicked a bunch of ass 
  quite the cowboy 
  yeah 
  very heroic 
  thanks  boss 
no  i m being sarcast     sighs 
the mission wasn t just
to stop a sale  jj 
the goal was to find out
what they knew
so we could take
the rest of the network down 
but that s kinda difficult now 
seeing that you killed everyone 
gregovich 
hassan s head of finance 
  hassan s head 
   man screams on monitor 
look  it s because of you
we have nothing 
we ve got the plutonium core 
turns out there are two cores 
actually 
this man  azar 
just got away with it 
the only one you didn t kill 
now he has half
of what he needs
to blow up a major city 
look  your special forces
record is impeccable 
but intelligence is a different
kind of ball game 
you know  spy craft
requires finesse 
nuance  emotional intelligence 
i ve got those  i have plenty
of emotional intelligence 
so you re saying
that you can just read
the slightest and most subtle
of facial cues
to assess
a target s temperament 
absolutely 
what does my face say 
should i start reading now 
oh  my god 
look  jj  i respect you  ok 
you put up some big wins for us 
but  with all due respect  i   
   i just don t think
you re out out for this 
take the rest of the day off 
go home and get some rest 
alright

the nsa has come up with a lead 
they believe hassan
had been working with this man 
victor marquez 
former french special ops 
he s a french national
who s been trading illegal arms
for the past two decades 
victor has recently stepped up
his game into the nuclear arena
and has acquired something
truly dangerous  
soviet schematics
for a miniaturised nuke 
for years  he s worked hand
in hand with his brother  david 
there were reports of a power
struggle between the two 
david didn t want his brother
to have the nuclear plans
and hid them 
enraged  victor killed him 
later he was almost captured
by police 
but he escaped
and is still on the run 
 woman screams 
oh  that poor lady 
does anyone know if she s ok 
she s fine 
if marquez finds those plans
and sells them to azar    boom 
our mission  take down marquez
before he can locate the plans 
do we know his whereabouts 
nsa believes he s headed
to berlin to meet with azar 
  yes  love berlin 
  christina  you ll take it 
we also have intel from mi6 
decrypted messaging suggests
that marquez has been in contact
with his lawyer from paris 
an international
scumbag named koll 
  paris is cool too

yes  sir 
you ll be on surveillance
with bobbi

that would attract the enemy 
so we had to bash their
little heads in with rocks 
really messy work 
then we had to cook  em
over c 4 
which gave them
this awful chemical taste 
but  hell  by that time
we were drinking our own urine
anyway  so   
 message alert buzzes 
um    i m really sorry

once upon a time 
there was a little girl
who got way too big
for her britches 
then one day she disappeared
and no one ever found the body 
you like stories  i got a story 
once there was a cia agent
that put cameras
in a little girl s bathroom
while seducing her mom
over chicken and wine

teach that at langley 
   school bell rings

   children gasp 
  andre

manage their money
so that by the time
they decide to stop working 
they have a nest egg 
my team and i make the schedule
for all the flights
at the airline 
which is over 3 000 a day 
and by controlling
this tiny little robot

who now works for
secret operations
for a us intelligence agency
that may or may not
or may be the cia 
 children gasp and exclaim 
well  i m not really
supposed to talk about it

and some unkindness 
so i just wanted
to set the record straight 
but if any of this information
were to leave this room 
i will find you 
 chuckles  no  i m just kidding 
 children and adults chuckle 
sort of 
  have you ever been shot 
  yes 
  can we see the scars 
  helen

 children chatter indistinctly 
   gentle melodic music 
   both speak inaudibly 
 children chatter indistinctly 
 siren wails in distance 
 sinister music 
 camera beeps  clicks 
 camera beeps  clicks 
 camera beeps  clicks 
how s it going 
we had a deal 
i just wanted to say thank you
for coming to my school
last week 
you made a really big impression
on my friends and my mom 
yeah  glad i could help   
for the last time 
  you re not married  are you 
  why 
i m trying to figure you out 
what s your real story 
under the rough exterior 
you seem like a nice guy 
but sort of damaged and alone 
you gotta be kidding me 
  i m thinking dead wife 
  no 
  dead partner 
  no 
led a group of buddies
into action 
made a bad call  lost them
and still haunted by it 
will you stop 
 sighs 
look  it s hard being deployed 
it s even harder on the people
that you leave at home 
the mission before last 
i got shot 
when i got home  my fiancee
left me  she couldn t take it 
my job s just   
it s better to be alone 
people always seem to get hurt 
one way or another 
so   
why am i telling you all this 
and the fish is all you have
to remember her by 
  nice talking to you 
  wait 
what if i told you i was
thinking about being a spy too
when i grow up 
  alright  good luck with that 
  i m serious 
you don t believe me 
look  kid 
you re just not the spy type 
oh  i see 
so  i should just stay in my box
and dream of being
maybe a barista
or a fashion designer
or a wedding planner 
or maybe an er nurse
like your mother 
you know  i was thinking
of asking bobbi anyway 
she seems more like
the brains of the operation 
whereas you re more the brawn 
who are you calling  brawn  
bobbi s an analyst 
she doesn t have an ounce
of my training 
if anybody s gonna teach you 
it s gonna be   
nicely done 
don t do that again 
so  what s first 
shooting range  obstacle course 
they don t let 9 year olds
into shooting ranges 
 scoffs 
where s the fun in that 
now  we know
you re a pretty good liar 
but what if
you re caught by the enemy
and faced with
a lie detector test 
why are we doing this 
she shouldn t even be in here 
alright  the key is
to focus on your breathing 
the slightest increase
in your blood pressure
is an indicator that
you re not telling the truth 
we ll start with
something simple 
i ll ask you a question
and you ll answer with
an obvious lie 
i don t wanna see those needles
move  is that clear 
alright  here we go 
  et moi  et moi  et moi 
by jacques dutronc 
sophie  so  when do i get
my first assignment 
jj  when i decide
that you re ready 
  i am ready 
  oh  yeah  alright 
see that
apartment building there 
yeah 
you know anybody
who lives there 
  no 
  10 minutes 
i wanna see you on
one of those balconies 
you want me to talk my way into
some stranger s apartment 
do you know how dangerous
that is 
you didn t have a problem
walking into my apartment 
 sighs 
i only need five minutes 
  et moi  et moi  et moi 
continues in french 
what do you do for a living 
i m a kgb agent
posing as a fourth grader 
my brother has three legs
and sells crack
and my mother is a prostitute 
 polygraph machine
whirrs steadily 
i don t need a machine
to tell me if someone s lying 
  yeah 
  yeah  i can smell a lie 
  et moi  et moi  et moi 
continues in french 
endorphins release an odour 
palms sweat
and the ultimate tell  
the slightest blink of an eye 
  that s all i need 
  you mean like this 
jj  i think you re a really
sweet and sensitive person 
jj  i admire
all of your tattoos 
stop 
jj  i believe you that
you ve never taken steroids 
jesus christ 
jj  stop  seriously  for real 
i m just joking 
  et moi  et moi  et moi 
continues in french 
now  in any fight 
you need an element of surprise 
now  you re tiny and weak
and i m the opposite 
so the objective of this
exercise is to get past me 
now  a good idea might be
to cause a distraction
because  otherwise 
there d be zero chance of you   
 gasps  blueberry 
blueberry  oh  god  ok 
  et moi  et moi  et moi 
continues in french 
that s some cold blooded shit 
  et moi  et moi  et moi 
continues in french 
so far  i could have learned
anything you ve taught me
from youtube 
oh  yeah  is that so 
i mean  when are you gonna
teach me the fun stuff 
like how to walk away from an
explosion without looking back
or what cool line you say
before you take someone out 
you need to stop getting
all your spy knowledge
from mission  impossible  
but   
   if i was gonna say
a cool line 
i have to keep it real fresh 
you d have a different line
for different bad guys 
yep 
what if the assassin was
disguised as an ice cream man 
i d say   chill out   and then
i d stab him with a freezer pop 
  a sidewalk santa 
   jingle all the way    to hell  
a guy dressed up as a dog 
selling watches 
 time s up  bitch  
 laughs 
 rock music 
  how was your day 
  it was good  yours 
 sourly  fine 
  something wrong 
  no 
are you sure 
 cause it seems like something
might be bothering you 
you helped train her how to pass
a lie detector  but not me 
i mean  i don t wanna be ageist
here  jj  but she is nine 
she still sleeps
with a night light 
i m a professional hacker with
a master s degree in english 
we just spent a little time
together 
i wasn t really teaching her
anything 
oh  well  you taught her
how to place shaped charges 
  it was just play doh 
  that s not the point 
  should i get you some play doh 
  i can get my own play doh 
are you sure  because
i d be happy to get you some

and emotionally vulnerable 
sophie  what s going on

good with people anymore 
yeah  i guess i know
a little bit about that too 
but  you know  what is it
they say about parenting 
it s not just about
what you say 
it s about being there 
showing up 
sophie hasn t had that
for a while 
her dad passed away
about a year ago 
she keeps pretending she s ok 
but i can tell she s struggling 
no  she s tough like her mom 
  i don t know how tough i am 
  i do  believe me 
  my balls still hurt 
   both laugh 
so sorry about that

jj on video  yeah

i wasn t thinking  it was this
adrenaline charged moment 
  her eyes were amazing 
  you are off the rails 
first  you take the kid skating 
then you go to show and tell 
and now you re going on a date
with the woman
we re supposed to be surveilling
and you re lying to me about it 
if i m with her 
i ll know she s safe 
well  dude  our job
isn t to keep her safe  ok 
it s to see if the bad guy
makes contact with her 
  that is our mission 
  there is no mission 
this is all nonsense 
there is no covert information
in that apartment 
just a broken family
and that is the truth 
the truth  we re gonna talk
about the truth  finally  great 
well  i know that
you lost your entire team
on your last deployment 
that s classified 
yeah 
well  i m the tech  remember

something you might find useful
if you d ever trust me 
but i get it 
you re the guy who s all closed
off  huh   i work alone

  well  goodnight 
   night 
 wistful romantic music 
well  math story problems
can be tricky 
so you gotta break  em down 
first  figure out
what they re asking you
and then you do the math 
  how d you get that scar 
  that  shrapnel 
check this one 
scooter 
solid  now concentrate  ok 
was my dad a bad guy 
um   
 whispers  yes  yeah 
uh  well  i think   
i think he made
some bad decisions 
especially about getting
involved with your uncle 
but if he helped make you 
he couldn t have been
all that bad  right 
alright  math 
let s say there s 12 really bad
guys and i gotta take them down 
but i ve got a partner 
if you divide a dozen bad guys
by the two of us 
how many bad guys do each of us
get to take down 
sophie 
well  12 divided by 2 is 6 
but if your partner is bobbi 
you re taking down all 12
and she s cheering you on
from the van 
 both laugh 
oh  but  wait  then seven more
bad guys surround your compound
and you don t know
which way to go
because your tech support
hates you and drove away 
so  oops  you re dead 
   laughs 
   phone rings 
  hi  kate 
  hey  can i ask a favour 
  jj over phone  um  yeah  ok 
  they just extended my shift

jj over phone  yeah  no problem 
thanks  you re a lifesaver 
oh  can you make sure

 gentle melodic music 
 mechanical whirring 
hi  mom 
we finished homework

well  i can t cook 
so protein shakes 
  and grilled cheese sandwiches 
  that s right 
   laughs 
  i got that 
can i talk to you for a minute 
yeah 
i know i should have called

i didn t expect
to walk into this 
i m sorry 
sophie can be really convincing 
no  you re not in trouble 
i just   
i wanted to say thank you 
aww 
you stumbling into our lives
has been a breath of fresh air 
sophie  mom  where does this go

the clock is ticking 
azar  you worry too much 
i ve located them 
but i m gonna need 24 hours 
let s go inside 
there are eyes all around us 
i think marquez has found
what he s looking for 
move in  now 
 engine starts 
   tense music 
   tyres squeal 
 tyres squeal  engine revs 
  christina  freeze 
  don t move 
  get in 
   man shouts indistinctly 
  go 
   tyres squeal 
we ve got them pinned 
i want both teams   
  must be pretty important 
  kim  oh  it is 
that s why i wanted
to do it here 
  the operation is over 
  bobbi  what 
we closed in on marquez
in berlin 
so rather than be taken 
he blew himself up 
there are multiple bodies 
forensics are sifting
through the mess 
kim  so the mission s over
and we no longer need to be
watching the family 
ok  so i guess we ll go back
to chicago and clear out 
you ll be doing more than that 
you ll also be clearing out
your desks here 
oh  man  you tapped into
our hard drive 
uh    that s kinda what we do 
that is not what it looks like 
that    i can explain that 
 song plays 
  they call me cardi b
  i run this shit
like cardio     
 laughs  1 million hits 
wow  that s   
   not the point 
just one job 
just one job  to sit and watch 
but no  you compromised
a mission
and broke protocol 
  that can t be tolerated 
  this wasn t bobbi s fault 
  i took this   
  you guys are done 
wow  i m    i just   
and you couldn t just call us
in chicago and tell us that
so we could clear out there 
you had to fly us out here
to tell us that 
that s very expensive 
is email not working 
these are tax dollars 
bobbi  when are you
gonna say something 
i mean  the whole flight back 
nothing 
you know 
alright  fine  i was wrong 
i didn t listen  you warned me 
you know  say something 
why aren t you mad at me 
 cause you re my hero  dude

you ve opened up a part of me
that s been
closed off for
a really long time
