kind of ball game
you know spy craft
requires finesse
nuance emotional intelligence

of emotional intelligence

the slightest and most subtle
of facial cues
to assess
a targets temperament

the nsa has come up with a lead
they believe hassan
had been working with this man
victor marquez
former french special ops
hes a french national
whos been trading illegal arms
for the past two decades
victor has recently stepped up
his game into the nuclear arena
and has acquired something
truly dangerous
soviet schematics
for a miniaturised nuke
for years hes worked hand
in hand with his brother david
there were reports of a power
struggle between the two
david didnt want his brother
to have the nuclear plans
and hid them
enraged victor killed him
later he was almost captured
by police
but he escaped
and is still on the run
woman screams
oh that poor lady
does anyone know if shes ok
shes fine
if marquez finds those plans
and sells them to azar boom
our mission take down marquez
before he can locate the plans
do we know his whereabouts
nsa believes hes headed
to berlin to meet with azar
yes love berlin
christina youll take it
we also have intel from mi6
decrypted messaging suggests
that marquez has been in contact
with his lawyer from paris
an international
scumbag named koll
paris is cool too

youll be on surveillance
with bobbi
excuse me

over c4
which gave them
this awful chemical taste

children chatter indistinctly
siren wails in distance
sinister music
camera beeps clicks
camera beeps clicks
camera beeps clicks
hows it going
we had a deal
i just wanted to say thank you
for coming to my school
last week
you made a really big impression
on my friends and my mom
yeah glad i could help
for the last time
youre not married are you
why
im trying to figure you out
whats your real story
under the rough exterior
you seem like a nice guy
but sort of damaged and alone
you gotta be kidding me
im thinking dead wife
no
dead partner
no
led a group of buddies
into action
made a bad call lost them
and still haunted by it
will you stop
sighs
look its hard being deployed
its even harder on the people
that you leave at home
the mission before last
i got shot
when i got home my fiancee
left me she couldnt take it
my jobs just
its better to be alone
people always seem to get hurt
one way or another
so
why am i telling you all this
and the fish is all you have
to remember her by
nice talking to you
wait
what if i told you i was
thinking about being a spy too
when i grow up
alright good luck with that
im serious
you dont believe me
look kid
youre just not the spy type
oh i see
so i should just stay in my box
and dream of being
maybe a barista
or a fashion designer
or a wedding planner
or maybe an er nurse
like your mother
you know i was thinking
of asking bobbi anyway
she seems more like
the brains of the operation
whereas youre more the brawn
who are you calling brawn
bobbis an analyst
she doesnt have an ounce
of my training
if anybodys gonna teach you
its gonna be
nicely done
dont do that again
so whats first
shooting range obstacle course
they dont let 9yearolds
into shooting ranges
scoffs
wheres the fun in that
now we know
youre a pretty good liar
but what if
youre caught by the enemy
and faced with
a lie detector test
why are we doing this
she shouldnt even be in here
alright the key is
to focus on your breathing
the slightest increase
in your blood pressure
is an indicator that
youre not telling the truth
well start with
something simple
ill ask you a question
and youll answer with
an obvious lie
i dont wanna see those needles
move is that clear
alright here we go
et moi et moi et moi
by jacques dutronc

you didnt have a problem
walking into my apartment
sighs
i only need five minutes
et moi et moi et moi
continues in french
what do you do for a living
im a kgb agent
posing as a fourthgrader
my brother has three legs
and sells crack
and my mother is a prostitute
polygraph machine
whirrs steadily
i dont need a machine
to tell me if someones lying

et moi et moi et moi
continues in french
endorphins release an odour
palms sweat

jj stop seriously for real
im just joking
et moi et moi et moi
continues in french
now in any fight
you need an element of surprise
now youre tiny and weak
and im the opposite
so the objective of this
exercise is to get past me
now a good idea might be
to cause a distraction
because otherwise
thered be zero chance of you
gasps blueberry
blueberry oh god ok
et moi et moi et moi
continues in french
thats some coldblooded shit
et moi et moi et moi
continues in french
so far i could have learned
anything youve taught me
from youtube
oh yeah is that so
i mean when are you gonna
teach me the fun stuff
like how to walk away from an
explosion without looking back
or what cool line you say
before you take someone out
you need to stop getting
all your spy knowledge
from mission impossible
but
if i was gonna say
a cool line
i have to keep it real fresh
youd have a different line
for different bad guys
yep
what if the assassin was
disguised as an icecream man
id say chill out and then
id stab him with a freezer pop
a sidewalk santa
jingle all the way to hell
a guy dressed up as a dog
selling watches
times up bitch
laughs
rock music

a lie detector but not me

but if he helped make you
he couldnt have been
all that bad right
alright math
lets say theres 12 really bad
guys and i gotta take them down
but ive got a partner
if you divide a dozen bad guys
by the two of us
how many bad guys do each of us
get to take down
sophie
well 12 divided by 2 is 6
but if your partner is bobbi
youre taking down all 12
and shes cheering you on
from the van
both laugh
oh but wait then seven more
bad guys surround your compound
and you dont know
which way to go
because your tech support
