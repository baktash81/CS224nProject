to be executed for a crime
i never committed 
of course 
isn t all mankind in the same boat 
isn t all mankind ultimately executed
for a crime it never committed 
the difference is that all men go eventually 
but i go at 6 00 tomorrow morning 
i was supposed to go at 5 00 
but i have a smart lawyer  got leniency 
i have a tremendous yearning
to be young again 
a boy 
such happy memories
at our summer house 
uncle nikolai with his wonderful laugh 
god  he was repulsive 
then there was grandpa and grandma 
who d been married for 50 years
and still felt as deeply about one another
as the day they met 
and my own father 
a handsome and generous man 
in addition to
our summer and winter estate 
he owned a valuable piece of land 
true  it was a small piece  but he carried it
with him wherever he went 
dimitri petrovitch 
i would like to buy your land 
this land is not for sale 
someday i hope to build on it 
he was an idiot  but i loved him 
then there was mother  who made
the most delicious blintzes in the world 
of course  there was old gregor
and his son  young gregor 
oddly enough  young gregor s son
was older than old gregor 
nobody could figure out
how that happened 
my two brothers  ivan and mikhail 
used to play amusing little games
but i had a completely different concept
of myself as a child 
my first experience with death
was with one of our serfs  old nehamkin 
old nehamkin was on the roof putting up
a lightning rod when a storm broke out 
after he failed to show up for dinner 
mother went to look for him 
what is it  old nehamkin 
you re not looking well  are you okay 
you feel all right 
we laid old nehamkin to rest 
and that night 
i had a strange and vivid dream 
i knew that after that dream 
i would not grow up to be an ordinary man 
i had many conversations
with father nikolai 
who was always dressed in black
with a black beard 
for years 
i thought he was an italian widow 
every action has a cause  the universe
exists  therefore it has a cause 
it follows god created the universe 
therefore he exists 
and yet  spinoza didn t believe
in the holy trinity 
  spinoza was a jew 
  what s a jew 
you never saw a jew 
here  i have some sketches 
  there are jews 
  no kidding 
they all have these horns 
no  this is the russian jew 
the german jew has these stripes 
i recall my first mystical vision 
i was walking through the woods 
thinking about christ 
if he was a carpenter  i wonder
what he d charge for bookshelves 
suddenly   
  who are you 
  death 
what happens after we die 
is there a hell 
is there a god  do we live again 
all right  let me ask one key question 
are there girls 
you re an interesting young man 
we ll meet again 
  don t bother 
  it s no bother 
i grew to full manhood  actually 5 6  
which is technically
not full manhood in russia 
but you can still own property 
over 5 3   you can own land 
under 5 3   you need
special permission from the czar 
we were three healthy men 
my brother  ivan 
my brother  mikhail 
and myself 
finally  there was my cousin  sonja 
in addition to being the most
beautiful woman i had ever seen 
she was one of the few people
i could have deep conversations with 
boris  look at this leaf 
isn t it perfect 
and this one  look 
oh  yeah 
yes  i definitely think that
this is the best of all possible worlds 
certainly the most expensive 
isn t nature incredible 
to me  nature is   
you know  i don t know 
spiders and bugs
and then big fish eating little fish
and then plants eating   
plants and animals eating   
it s like an enormous restaurant 
that s the way i see it 
yes  but if god created it 
it has to be beautiful 
even if his plan s not apparent to us
at the moment 
sonja  what if there is no god 
boris dimitrovitch  are you joking 
what if we re just
a bunch of absurd people
who are running around
with no rhyme or reason 
but if there is no god 
then life has no meaning 
why go on living 
why not just commit suicide 
well  let s not get hysterical 
i could be wrong 
i d hate to blow my brains out and then
read in the papers they found something 
boris  let me show you
how absurd your position is 
all right 
let s say that there is no god 
and each man is free to do
exactly as he chooses 
well  what prevents you
from murdering somebody 
  murder s immoral 
  morality is subjective 
yes  but subjectivity is objective 
not in any rational scheme
of perception 
perception is irrational 
it implies imminence 
but judgment of any system
or a priori relation of phenomena
exists in any rational or metaphysical
or at least epistemological contradiction
to an abstracted empirical concept
such as being
or to be or to occur in the thing itself
or of the thing itself 
yeah  i ve said that many times 
boris  we must believe in god 
if i could just see a miracle 
just    just one miracle 
if i could see a burning bush
or the seas part
or my uncle sasha pick up a check 
we should go back downstairs 
by now  the last golden streaks
of the sunset
are vanishing behind the western hills 
soon the dark blanket of night
shall settle over us all 
hey  you ve been going
to finishing school 
hey  you    dating any russians
i should know about 
well  minskov has proposed 
and he s very sweet and wealthy
but the age difference is too great 
  i m 28 and he s 81 
  oh  that is big 
when i m 50  he ll be    103 
that s a bad age for men 
they slow up a lot 
oh  and voskovec has made
his intentions clear
but he deals in herring 
and he always smells of herring 
do you know  he even bought me
herring scented cologne 
oh  really  that s probably why
the cat follows you around 
love is everything  boris 
i want to meet some man
and scale the heights of passion 
some man who embodies
the three great aspects of love 
intellectual  spiritual and sensual 
well  then 
there s not too many of us around 
but it can be done 
  so many women settle cheaply 
  i know  poor things 
  they marry for money 
  money  well  money 
but i tell you  i feel as though
my life would be wasted
if i didn t love deeply
with a man whose mind i respected 
whose spirituality equaled mine
and who had the same 
oh  lustful appetite for sensual passion
that drives me insane 
you re an incredibly complex woman 
i guess you could say
i m half saint  half whore 
here s hoping i get the half that eats 
  boris 
  yes 
  i have a confession to make 
  yes 
  ever since you and i were little children   
  yes 
i ve been in love
with your brother  ivan 
oh  it s only nat   
ivan  you re kidding 
he can barely write his name
in the ground with a stick 
  he has true animal magnetism 
  animal magnetism 
all that talk about some perfect love 
and you re hot for ivan 
  he kissed me 
  any place i should know 
it warmed the cockles of my heart 
that s just great 
nothing like hot cockles 
i think he s going to
ask me to marry him 
but he s a gambler and a drinker 
he s got a neanderthal mentality 
don t get me wrong  i love him
like a brother  just not one of mine 
do you hear that commotion 
what is going on downstairs 
have you heard the news 
napoleon has invaded austria 
why  is he out of courvoisier 
at last  a chance
to taste the glories of battle 
well  check with me when it s over 
i ll be in the game room 
no  boris  you re going to fight 
i m gonna fight  you re gonna have
your head examined 
we leave the day after tomorrow 
fellas  i m a pacifist 
i don t believe in war 
he doesn t believe in war 
napoleon  he believes in war 
what are you going to do
when the french soldiers rape your sister 
  i don t have a sister 
  that s no answer 
who are they gonna rape 
ivan  they ll throw up 
don t disgrace me
in front of my friends 
what good is war 
we kill a few frenchmen 
they kill a few russians 
next thing you know  it s easter 
boris  you can t be serious 
you re talking about mother russia 
oh  she s not my mother 
my mother s standing right here 
and she s not gonna let her youngest baby
get shrapnel in his gums 
get away from me 
i can t believe what i m seeing 
our brother has a yellow streak
down his back 
no  it s not down  it runs across 
  boris  you re a coward 
  yes  but i m a militant coward 
boris  medals  we get medals 
take it easy  will you  ivan 
you gotta cut down on your raw meat 
he ll go and he ll fight 
and i hope they will
put him in the front lines 
thanks a lot  mom  my mother  folks 
this is crazy  i can t shoot a gun 
i was meant to write poetry 
sonja  i m not the army type 
i slept with a light on
in my room till i was 30 
i can t shower with other men 
friends  my friends 
on the eve of this glorious occasion 
i have an announcement to make 
because we go into battle 
perhaps never to see our loved ones again 
i wish to announce
that tomorrow i intend to marry 
i m going to take as my bride 
a woman i have grown up with 
anna ivanova 
  ivan   
  i m sorry  i should have told you 
i also have an announcement to make 
tomorrow  i too  get married 
wonderful 
yes  i have been proposed to
and have accepted the hand of
serge ivanonich minskov 
oh 
yes  i mean    leonid voskovec 
the herring merchant 
you  get out here 
you re the worst soldier i ever seen 
  you ignoramus 
  ignoramus  sir 
  do you want a dishonorable discharge 
  yes  sir  either that or a furlough 
  goddamn you  you love russia  don t you 
  yes  sir 
  louder 
  yes  sir 
  you like it here  don t you 
  yes  sir 
you want to make a career
out of the army  don t you 
well  let s not get carried away 
from now on  you ll clean
the mess hall and the latrine 
yes  sir 
how will i tell the difference 
okay  one  two  one  two  one  two   
yeah  three is next 
if you re having any trouble 
naturally  the war affects
the herring industry 
the ports are blockaded
and fresh shipments of the herring
become more difficult to obtain 
of course  when something
hurts herring  it hurts me 
you see  what people don t understand
is that there are hundreds
of types of herring 
each with its own interesting history 
sonja  are you okay 
oh  yes 
but i ve talked long enough 
why don t you two play 
as i have got some
important business to attend to 
a capital idea 
ready  and a one and a two and   
you stopped 
what would you think if i told you
you were one of the most
beautiful women i have ever seen 
i d think   what a mad fool he is  
and what would you say
if i suddenly put my arms around you 
i d think 
 what a mad  impetuous fool he is  
and what would you think
if i kissed you 
i d think   what a mad  impetuous 
wonderful fool he is  
  don t 
  i must 
  we just ate 
  your skin  it is so beautiful 
yes  i know  it covers my whole body 
i must have you 
no  no  not here  not on the piano 
it s a rented piano 
darling  my darling  my   
sonja 
sonja  did you see a jar of wine sauce 
  come to my quarters tomorrow at 3 00 
  i can t 
  please 
  it s immoral  what time 
so who is to say what is moral 
morality is subjective 
subjectivity is objective 
moral notions imply attributes
to substances
which exist only in relational duality 
not as an essential extension
of ontological existence 
can we not talk about sex so much 
i am terribly sorry 
  you d better go 
  sonja  please 
  no  no  i mean it  pierre 
  sonja darling  please   
men  next week we leave for the front 
the object will be to kill
as many frenchmen as possible 
naturally  they are going to try and kill
as many russians as possible 
if we kill more frenchmen  we win 
if they kill more russians  they win 
what ll we win 
what do we win  private 
imagine your loved ones
conquered by napoleon
and forced to live under french rule 
do you want them to eat that rich food
and those heavy sauces 
no 
do you want them to have
souffle every meal  and croissant 
no 
now  men  because you are all getting
a three day furlough
before going into battle 
we would like to show you
this little hygiene play 
  goodbye  i hope you had a good time 
  i did  i had a good time 
oh  what s this sore on my lip 
i better see the doctor 
doc  i have this sore on my lip 
  you have a social disease  my friend 
  oh  my god 
if you do not treat it 
you will go blind or insane 
well  men  that is the end of the play 
have a good time on your furlough 
but look after yourselves 
well  what did you think of the play 
oh  it was weak  i was never interested 
although the part of the doctor
was played with gusto and verve 
and the girl had
a delightful cameo role 
a puckish satire of contemporary mores 
a droll spoof aimed more
at the heart than the head 
as for me  i m planning to spend
the next three days in a brothel 
  care to come with me 
  no  no 
i went to a brothel once in my life 
i got hiccups 
you know  it was over like that 
besides  there s someone
in st  petersburg i d like to visit 
well  have fun 
i think you ll find the magic flute
is mozart s greatest opera 
oh  yeah  it s a hell
of an opera  isn t it 
they sell popcorn
or gumdrops or something 
we re so delighted you decided
to spend your furlough with us 
you know  you ve always
been our favorite nephew 
even though you re an incredible coward 
thank you so much  thank you 
any news of cousin sonja 
only that she and voskovec are unhappy
and that she takes lovers 
  she takes uppers 
  lovers 
oh  lovers  lovers 
hey  who is that 
that s the countess alexandrovna 
one of the most enticing woman
in st  petersburg 
ample bosoms  yes 
i d say ample for a regiment 
she s recently widowed 
and they say her husband  the count 
died in her arms
trying to satisfy
her prodigious sexual desires 
no kidding  died smiling  i bet 
who s the character with her
with the wry moustache 
that s anton ivanovich inbedkov 
her current lover 
although the way
she keeps staring at you 
i m sure i could work
something out with him 
i d let him warm her up
for a few minutes
and i could come in at the end
and finish her 
you must be careful of anton ivanovich 
  he has a furious temper 
  really 
he has killed several men in duels 
all in a jealous rage over the countess 
glad you mentioned it 
think i ll watch the opera 
oh  there is something about mozart 
i think you re probably
responding to his music 
oh  my goodness  be careful 
couldn t you be careful 
i believe    i believe   
i believe that the lobby   
i believe that the lobby of
the st  petersburg opera house
is one of the most beautiful in europe 
who is this attractive
and mysterious soldier 
boris grushenko 
ooh  i m sorry  i goosed that lady 
he has quite a sensitive
face  hasn t he 
that s just the part of me that shows 
grushenko 
isn t he the young coward
all st  petersburg is talking about 
i m not so young  i m 35 
the one who s so afraid
for his own safety
that he is reluctant
to defend his country 
he is in a bad mood  isn t he 
what s the matter 
don t you like your seats 
you must visit me for tea someday 
i m sure we d have a lot to talk about 
it s okay with me 
i ll bring the tea bags 
we could run a quick check
on your erogenous zones 
what about the dybbuk 
why do you persist
in taunting me in public 
if you so much as come
near the countess 
i ll see that you ll never see
the light of day again 
if a man said that to me 
i d break his neck 
i am a man 
well  i mean a much shorter man 
boris 
  boris dimitrovitch 
  sonja 
look at you 
you look so handsome in your uniform 
well  i got a perfect build for clothes 
i m a 28 dwarf 
and you  sonja  my god 
you look more beautiful standing here
than you do in person 
  oh  boris  i m so unhappy 
  oh  i wish you weren t 
voskovec and i quarrel frequently 
i ve become a scandal 
poor sonja 
for the past weeks 
i ve visited seretsky in his room 
why  what s in his room 
oh 
and before seretsky  alexi 
and before alexi  alegorian 
  and before alegorian  asimov   
  okay 
wait  i m still on the a s 
  how many lovers do you have 
  in the midtown area 
oh  sonja 
boris  my life is ruined  over 
i can t stand voskovec 
he s a man whose mentality
has reduced all the beauty of the world
to a small pickled fish 
sonja  what you need is somebody
to take you away from voskovec 
somebody who loves you 
somebody who s always loved you
and who s always
cared for you very deeply 
how is your brother  ivan 
oh  ivan s all right 
  yes  ivan is well 
  you know ivan is a tiger 
he went through basic training in
two weeks  they made him a major 
  and does he ever speak of me 
  sonja  he s busy 
well  he must  he must speak
of me sometimes  he must 
take it easy  will ya 
this is army property 
once he was sick  he was delirious 
he called your name out 
really  then there s hope 
look  tomorrow my regiment pulls out 
we re going to the front 
we re badly outnumbered by the french 
there s very little chance that
any of us will ever come back 
exactly what did he say about me 
sonja 
oh  now where did you say
you were going 
oh  yes  oh  yes  the war 
well    dress warmly  boris 
and have a nice time 
the idea is not to panic and run 
then they shoot you in the back 
i don t want to be trampled by a horse 
what about you  boris 
yeah  i want to be trampled by a horse 
i don t even want to fight 
think there s any difference whether
we live under the czar or napoleon 
they re both crooks 
the czar s a little taller 
boris  if you don t like napoleon
and you don t like the czar 
who do you think
should be running the country 
  you really want to know  the serfs 
  oh  the serfs 
that s right  they re the only ones
who know how to do anything 
if a fence needs putting up 
or a picture needs hanging 
it s always the serfs 
he wants the serfs to run the country 
why not the criminal element 
or the jews 
some jews are smart 
although i hear their women
don t believe in sex after marriage 
  are you married  boris 
  me  no 
  you got a sweetheart 
  no  no 
i m in love with a girl 
she s married to someone 
and she s in love with someone 
and he s married 
it s a real healthy situation 
  hey  look  boris  look  look 
  what do you got there 
i got a lock of my wife s hair  look 
a lock of her hair  she   
she s probably running around bald 
don t drop it  don t drop it 
you got a lock of your sweetheart s hair 
no  my sweetheart s married 
i got a lock of her husband s hair 
it s the best i could do 
boy  this    this army cooking
will get you every time 
there s visinksy 
he was from my village 
he was the village idiot 
yeah  what did you do  place 
oh  god is testing us 
if he s gonna test us 
why doesn t he give us a written 
wow  the battle looks completely different
when you re in the middle of it
than it does to the generals
up on the hill 
hey  get your red hots 
yeah  you got anything to drink 
oh  no  the guy with the beer
will be around in a second 
hey  fella  you got something smaller 
i just started 
we started the battle with 12 000 men 
when it was over  we had 14 survivors 
we got a message from the czar saying 
 keep up the good work  
that night as i was burying bodies 
i had another mystical experience 
mercifully  god was on our side 
yeah  i m sure things could
have gotten a lot worse if he wasn t 
it might ve rained 
grushenko 
vladimir maximovitch  you re alive 
no  i m dead  look at this hole 
  oh    does it hurt 
  i feel nothing 
you don t look so bad
for a guy who s dead 
actually better than when you were alive 
i think it agrees with you 
  do me a favor 
  sure  anything 
this engagement ring 
i was gonna give it to my girlfriend 
a surprise 
  oh  you want me to give it to her 
  no  what s the point 
  take it back to the jeweler s in smolensk 
  right 
  petroshkin  vladimir petroshkin 
  okay 
tell him i m dead 
and get the deposit back 
oh  okay  sure 
what d you give him for this 
sixteen hundred roubles 
for this  you gave him 1 600 roubles 
  look  this is a diamond 
  i know 
  two little baguettes 
  this is insane 
  i could have gotten you this ring for 1200 
  not this 
  never    never that ring 
  same ring  the exact same ring 
never  listen 
anyway  listen  take the deposit 
  go to kiev 
  right 
give it to a woman
named natasha petrovna 
  right  okay 
  get a receipt  make sure you get a receipt 
why do you need a receipt  you re dead 
  tax purposes 
  oh  good thinking 
  what happened 
  he was cleaning his pistol and it went off 
  the bullet is lodged in his heart 
  is it serious 
with proper medical care 
he could last another 10 minutes 
why  why were you cleaning your pistol 
i was going to fight a duel
to defend your honor 
a turkish cavalry officer
cast aspersions on it 
he said you were sleeping around 
i knew he was lying 
that you were pure 
oi 
yes  well  leonid 
i know i could have been
a better wife to you 
kinder 
i could have made love with you
more often  or once even 
once would have been nice 
you were a kind and loving husband 
generous  and always considerate 
what s he got  about eight minutes 
i think i m slow  he s got about three 
swimming out to the open sea 
like the great  wild herring 
i realize this must be
a great blow to you  sonja 
but you must not allow yourself
to be consumed with grief 
the dead pass on 
and life is for the living 
i guess you re right 
where do you want to eat 
let s go to rykoff s 
  no  no  not rykoff s 
  why 
i feel like meat  what do you get at rykoff s 
maybe a cheese sandwich 
  if it s not meat  it s nothing 
  it s not good for your health 
there s a tavern at the edge of the square
makes a sausage that s wonderful 
meanwhile  the war continued 
my regiment had been wiped out 
and i found myself lost
behind enemy lines 
i panicked and hid where i could 
then i fainted 
when i came to  i realized
i had made a terrible mistake 
as fate would have it 
i landed on a group of french generals 
causing their immediate surrender 
and making me a hero 
my brother ivan was not so lucky 
he was a fatality of war 
he had been bayonetted to death
by a polish conscientious objector 
you re praying for ivan 
yes  your husband 
i loved him  as you know 
i wanted you to have
some of his possessions 
how kind 
i kept his sword and gold watch 
but here 
i m giving you his moustache 
i ll cherish it 
also  some string 
ivan saved string 
i know  it was one of the reasons
why i loved him 
i understand that 
i loved him for his string  too 
anything else for me 
i thought we should divide his letters 
do you want the vowels
or the consonants 
his vowels 
you keep the consonants 
life is unbearable 
  so we meet again 
  countess alexandrovna 
i wish there was some way
i could show you my gratitude
for what you ve done for russia 
i may be able to think of something 
maybe we could meet in my room
later this evening 
as you wish  how s five minutes 
well  what have we here 
oh  still dating laughing boy 
back from the war  i see 
yes  i d have stayed longer 
but they ran out of medals 
i understand your heroism
was quite inadvertent 
you should have such an inadvertent
heroism  that s telling him 
are you gonna waste your time
conversing with this strutting ass 
careful  i think it s a trick question 
fetch my carriage  anton inbedkov 
i ll join you momentarily 
nice seeing you again  quasimodo 
my room at midnight 
  perfect  will you be there  too 
  naturally 
  until midnight  then 
  midnight 
make it a quarter to 12 00 
  midnight 
  midnight  of course 
boris  you hardly touched your blini 
oh  yes  well  i ve been sick  you know 
come in 
how do you like it 
it s all right 
i prefer something sexy  but you   
would you like some wine 
something to put you in the mood 
oh  i ve been in the mood
since the late 1700s 
you re disgusting  but i love you 
well  my disgustingness
is my best feature 
it must be lonely at the front 
how long has it been
since you ve made love to a woman 
what s today  monday  tuesday   
yeah  two years 
two years  you remember how  of course 
well  if you start me 
it ll all come back 
remember that 
yes  that was just like kissing  right 
you re the greatest lover i ve ever had 
well  i practice a lot when i m alone 
shall we say pistols at dawn 
well  we can say it 
i don t know what it means 
but we can say it 
you have insulted the honor
of countess alexandrovna 
why  i let her finish first 
  her seconds will call on you 
  seconds  i never gave her seconds 
as her fiance 
my seconds will call on your seconds 
well  my seconds will be out 
have them call on my thirds 
if my thirds are out 
go directly to my fourths 
boris  he s serious 
you must meet him on the field of honor 
i m not gonna duel with him 
he s a marksman and a killer 
  your honor is at stake 
  hey  what is this   slap boris day  
you are a war hero 
surely a duel with anton inbedkov
is nothing to fear 
look  i just don t want to waste
a good bullet  that s all 
the kid s rash

the long ones 
thank you  cousin boris 
twice removed 
by tomorrow morning 
i may be removed completely 
what is it  you look so worried 
sonja  are you scared of dying 
 scared  is the wrong word 
i m frightened of it 
interesting distinction 
if only god would give me some sign 
if he would just speak to me once 
anything  one sentence  two words 
if he would just cough 
of course there s a god 
we re made in his image 
you think i was made in god s image 
take a look at me 
you think he wears glasses 
not with those frames 
nothingness 
nonexistence 
black emptiness 
what d you say 
i was just planning my future 
why are you so preoccupied with death 
sit down with me for a second 
sonja  tomorrow morning i m gonna
fight a duel with anton inbedkov 
he s much better than i am at it 
and i ll probably be killed 
i wanted to take this time 
if i don t see you again 
  to say that i love you 
  boris   
i ve always loved you
ever since we were kids 
i was heartbroken when you loved ivan 
but i still love you 
why didn t you say something 
  would it have mattered 
  oh  of course not  darling 
if by some miracle i m not killed tomorrow 
would you marry me 
what do you think the odds are 
going to die before the harvest 
the crops  the grains 
fields of rippling wheat 
wheat  all there is in life is wheat 
sonja  here s your chance
to do something kind for a dying boy 
but i don t really love boris  i mean 
i love him  but i m not in love with him 
oh  wheat  lots of wheat 
fields of wheat 
a tremendous amount of wheat 
and yet he loves me 
and would make a devoted husband 
not too exciting  but devoted 
we d have a family  maybe not
our own  we could rent one 
i could learn to love him 
me  boris and six rented children 
or would i feel trapped 
suffocated  can t breathe 
open a window  no  no  no  not that one 
the one in the bathroom 
yellow wheat  red wheat 
wheat with feathers  cream of wheat 
poor boy  dueling with anton inbedkov 
by this time tomorrow morning 
my beloved cousin boris
will look like a swiss cheese 
promise him anything 
make him happy for a night 
oh  or would i feel trapped 
suffocated  my youth gone 
living with a swiss cheese
and rented children 
of course  i ll marry you  boris 
it would be an honor for me 
this anton inbedkov 
he is a good shot  isn t he 
  i m afraid so 
  well   
since this may be
your last night on earth 
let s go back to my room and make love 
oh  nice idea 
i ll bring the soy sauce 
at last  you re late  boris grushenko 
we thought you weren t coming 
  well  i overslept 
  can you be so relaxed and confident 
you know  i hate to shoot anybody
before i ve had my morning tea 
i get a lot of bad mail from the serfs 
i implore both of you 
come back to your senses 
there is still time to call it off 
by mutual consent  with no loss of honor 
since you put it that way 
maybe i will hop back into bed 
we ll do it now 
and to the death 
oh  no  i can t do anything to the death 
doctor s orders 
i have an ulcer condition  and dying
is one of the worst things for it 
begin 
you have been challenged  choose 
oh 
sure 
oh 
all right  i ll take these 
just one 
oh  he gets one  that was silly 
starting back to back  on my signal

  of course 
of course 
good luck  and god be with you both 
you listening 
one  two 
three  four  five 
six  seven  eight

does this come out from
dry cleaning or is this like gravy 
you must shoot 
no  no  no  i don t wanna shoot 
you must  it s the law 
well  if it s the law 
then i ll shoot in the air 
there  i fulfilled my obligation 
boris dimitrovitch 
i ve learned a great lesson here today 
yes  me too 
never shoot up in the air
when you re standing under it 
you could have killed me 
and you didn t 
how can i ever repay you 
well  you can start
by getting off my toe 
oh  i beg your pardon 
boris dimitrovitch  from this day on 
i will lead a new life 
i will modify my views 
i will preach goodness 
perhaps join the church 
i will lead a righteous life 
devote myself  as i did
in my childhood  to my singing 
he s got a great voice  hasn t he 
i should ve shot him 
so  sonja and i married 
i know pronounce you man and wife 
oh 
i m so happy 
look at the kid  she s so happy 
she s speechless 
he missed 
he missed it  he missed 
i know what s bothering you 
you re worried whether you re gonna
be a stimulating enough wife for me 
whether it s possible to live up to the
chores and obligations of married life 
but it s gonna be a cinch  i promise 
i have no bad habits at all 
granted  i have a few eccentricities 
i won t eat any food that
begins with the letter  f  
like chicken for instance 
boris  i just don t love you 
oh  sonja   
oh  i mean i love you 
but i m not in love with you 
sonja  do you even know what love means 
there are many different kinds
of love  boris 
there s love between a man and a woman 
love between a mother and a son 
two women  let s not forget my favorite 
but then there s the love
i ve always dreamed of
  ever since i was a little girl 
  yeah 
the love between
two extraordinary individuals 
sonja 
oh  don t  boris  please 
sex without love is an empty experience 
yes  but  as empty experiences go 
it s one of the best 
at first  things were
a little tense between us 
but after a while  she relaxed 
don t  not here 
soon sonja got more used to me 
sometimes she actually had fun 
like the time she baked
her first soufflé 
money was scarce 
and sonja learned to make
wonderful dishes out of snow 
sweetheart  it looks
a little rare to me 
oh  i left it in the oven
for an hour and a half 
did you   cause it looks  you know 
it s all    what s for dessert 
  a surprise  boris 
  yes  what 
a nice  big bowl of sleet 
oh  sleet  my favorite 
that s wonderful 
evenings we played music together 
and as time passed  i won her heart 
oh  boris  i ve never been
so happy in my entire life 
i love you  boris  in a deeper way
than i ever thought was possible 
really 
i want to have children with you 
  what kind 
  little children 
of course 
the big ones are mentally slower 
  i want to have three children 
  one of each 
oh  boris    boris  i m actually happy 
well  i hate to say i told you so 
but some men have it 
and some men don t 
fortunately  i have so much of it 
those next months
were the happiest time of my life 
then one day  at the height
of my sense of well being 
i suddenly and for no apparent reason
was seized with an urge
to commit suicide 
no  you re healthy 
you have a beautiful wife 
your work is going well 
  i know  but something s missing 
  what 
i don t know  i feel a void
at the center of my being 
what kind of void 
  well  an empty void 
  empty void 
yes  i felt a full void about a month ago 
but it was just something i ate 
maybe what you have
is a sickness of the soul 
  look  there s death 
  what  who 
death  he s got krapotkin 
the wine merchant 
  really 
  yeah  and a woman 
ooh  it s not mrs  krapotkin 
  you re kidding 
  no 
i always knew krapotkin
was diddling somebody else 
where are you taking krapotkin 
away  forever 
listen  if you run into my wife 
tell her i m with you 
goodbye  krapotkin 
if you get a chance  write 
father andre  holiest of holies 
aged and wise 
you are the most wrinkled man
in the entire country 
get off my beard  you little jerk 
oh 
rise  my child 
  rise 
  i m standing 
my eyesight is poor 
everyone says you re senile with age
but you re the only one
that can help me 
i don t think you re senile 
  where did you say the fish was caught 
  what fish 
didn t you say something about fish 
father  boris is trying
to commit suicide 
last week he contemplated killing himself
by inhaling next to an armenian 
tell boris this 
i have lived many years 
and after many trials and tribulations 
i have come to the conclusion
that the best thing is   
yes 
  blonde  12 year old girls 
  father   
two of them  whenever possible 
father  i counted on you 
i forgive you 
i forgive you 
yes  thank you  thank you 
your grubbiness 
as i dangled at the rope s end 
i was suddenly seized
with an urge to live 
all i could think of was sonja 
i wanted to hold her close to me 
weep tears on her shoulder
and engage in oral sex 
it was then
that i made the decision to live 
to live and become a great poet 
i should have been
a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across
the floors
of silent seas 
too sentimental 
that winter  sonja and i
had a wonderful time 
we found a new friend 
berdykov  the village idiot 
berdykov would sit smiling for days 
and stroke a little piece of velvet
while sonja would make him happy
by feeding him cookies 
we looked forward to the spring
when we could have a child of our own 
little did we know 
war  napoleon has invaded russia 
it s war  war 
oh  what about all our plans 
we were gonna be parents this year 
well  there s gonna be
a slight change in our plans 
instead of parents 
we re gonna be refugees 
well  that s terrible 
we have to take our possessions and flee 
i m very good at that 
i was the men s freestyle fleeing
champion two years in a row 
then we have to remember to burn
the food so the french don t get it 
although i know it s tough
to light borscht 
  boris 
  what 
  i have an idea 
  what 
let s assassinate napoleon 
yeah  interesting 
it s getting a little late 
you want to start knitting dinner 
  i m serious 
  what do you mean you re serious 
i mean  let s you and i kill napoleon 
sonja  you been drinking from the glass
we use for the village idiot 
it s the answer to all our problems 
no  it s not the answer  it s an answer 
and it s the wrong answer 
the correct answer is  flee  
f l e a  flee 
no  no  the french occupy moscow 
  his headquarters are there 
  sonja   
two innocent looking types like us
could work our way in to see him 
and then shoot him 
sonja  we d never get near him 
if we did  we d shoot and miss 
he s a tough target  he s very small 
boris  it s our chance to perform
a truly heroic act 
since when is murder a heroic act 
violence is justified
in the service of mankind 
  who said that 
  attila the hun 
you re quoting a hun to me 
don t you know that murder carries
with it a moral imperative
that transcends any notion
of the inherent universal free will 
oh  that is incredibly jejune 
  that s jejune 
  jejune 
you have the temerity to say that
i m talking to you out of jejune osity 
i m one of the most  june  people
in all of the russias 
i have ivan s old pistol 
sonja  political assassination doesn t work 
violence leads to violence 
he who lives by the sword 
dies by the sword 
well  i m out of clichés now 
what  are you suggesting
passive resistance 
no  i m suggesting active fleeing 
you can t run away all your life 
i know  but murder 
the most foul of all crimes 
and  not abstract murder  shooting a rifle
at an unknown enemy on the battlefield 
but standing in a closed room
with a live human being
and pulling the trigger face to face
and a famous human being 
a successful one 
one who earns more than i do 
my god  you figure napoleon 
why he s gotta be good for
10 000 francs a week  that s minimum 
that s minimum 
that s without tips or extras 
nothing like that 
and me  what am i 
he s a great man 
he thinks like the super man 
and i m just a worm  an insect 
some kind of crawling  disgusting 
creeping little vermin 
  you know you can stop me 
  i will when i disagree 
oh  sonja  who are we to kill somebody 
boris  for the first time in my life 
i feel free  weightless 
i have an exhilarating feeling
of human freedom 
it s called the guillotine 
oh  look  boris 
look  the soft golden dusk
is already transmogrifying itself
into the blue star sprinkled night 
careful   cause that gun may be loaded 
several days later 
we set out for moscow 
we took berdykov with us part way 
he was on his way to minsk 
there was a village idiots  convention
in minsk 
and berdykov was planning to attend 
village idiots from all over russia
were meeting there 
we drove through
small villages and tiny hamlets 
we had no great plan 
but when we stopped at an inn
along the way  fate provided one 
pardon me  could you tell me
who those people are behind that screen 
that s don francisco of spain
and his sister 
they re en route to meet napoleon 
don francisco  i presume 
do you know me  señor 
oh  let s just say your name
is legend in these parts 
it is 
well  perhaps not legend 
but it never fails to get a big laugh 
and you must be the don s sister 
the noted spanish countess and meeskeit 
who are you 
just a humble servant who wishes
to buy his excellency a drink 
oh  i would be honored 
waiter  a bottle of your best red wine 
please  and two straws 
two straws 
word has it the don
is en route to visit napoleon 
word travels fast 
not as fast as good news 
no news is good news 
here today  gone tomorrow 
you can lead a horse to water 
but you can t make him drink 
your turn 
we would invite you to join us
but the difference in social rank
and wealth  it makes it silly 
oh  yes  i threw this on 
it s a knockdown 
you guys know napoleon or what 
hardly 
a joke  your nothingness 
we are friends with his brother 
who is arranging the affairs of spain 
but this is our first meeting
with the great emperor 
that s all i wanted to know 
  don francisco 
  pardon me 
i m having trouble adjusting my belt 
you think you could come over here
and hold my    bosom for a while 
of course  señorita 
no  no  no  it s not what i had in mind 
it should have more cream
between the crust 
and no raisins 
  but at our last meeting  you said raisins 
  no 
if this pastry is to bear my name 
it must be richer 
more cream 
  is there time 
  very little 
my spies tell me that
my illustrious british enemy
is working on a new meat recipe
which he plans to call beef wellington 
it will never get off the ground 
we must develop the napoleon
before he develops beef wellington 
the future of europe
hangs in the balance 
yes  your highness 
we must see you  your highness 
we have reason to believe that
there is a plot to take your life 
that s why we ve made up an obscure
private from the ranks to look like you 
  look 
  how do you do  your highness 
he looks like me 
you re seeing him without his rug 
come 
just let me get this on  your highness 
and now  i take your place 
i will teach you to walk like me 
i have a great walk 
with the emperor out of the way 
all that remains is to kill don francisco 
that will destroy his highness s
stupid dreams of a treaty with spain 
then i ll sail to austria
and form an alliance with the crown 
not the king  just the crown 
they call me mad 
but one day
when the history of france is written 
they will mark my name well 
sidney applebaum 
we re here to see the emperor 
who is calling 
  who  oh  that s droll 
  droll  yes 
apparently  he s not familiar with the list
of the 100 most important  spanishers  
yes  it is only don francisco
and his sister 
yes  the  donessa  
yes  we have an appointment
with napoleon 
right  napoleon bonaparte 
the noted international tyrant 
  you  you are don francisco and his sister 
  oh  for sure 
  well  we ve had a long  a hot journey 
  a hot journey 
and our throats are parched 
they re parched 
our throats  they re parched 
  parched  we seek succor  succor  succor 
  yes  succor  succor 
yes  is succor here by any chance 
i never knew your name  madam 
oh    the boys usually
just call me juanita 
juanita 
juanita 
juanita  the emperor is a man who
appreciates magnificent women 
he ll be much taken with you 
good  i wore my flats 
we are of course all most anxious
to hear your proposal for a treaty 
oh  good 
yes  i ve given it a lot of thought
and i ve come up
with all the little details  you know 
now if i can just think of
the main points  we got something 
well  there is no time for business 
you ve had a wearing journey 
yes  well  we should say
hello to the emperor 
that s right 
shorts gets touchy if we bypass him 
there will be time for that later 
first  you ll be shown your quarters
and wined and dined in a manner
befitting spanish nobility 
oh  wonderful 
but go easy on the champagne 
the donessa has gout 
well  if you ll proceed 
your needs will be attended to 
oh  thank you 
while you re here with your sister 
should you desire
a little blonde french love dream
to be sent to your room 
it will be arranged 
good  good  maybe i ll have two
to keep the symmetry perfect 
i prefer two myself 
i prefer three 
but it s hard enough to get one 
this room big enough for you 
or would you prefer a suite 
boris    boris  i m scared 
you re scared 
i m growing a beak and feathers 
  what are we gonna do 
  i say we get out of here now 
i m not leaving here
until we shoot napoleon  here 
oh  i see  thanks  i m the hitman 
remember  you can t take any chances 
now make sure the barrel of the gun
is pressed against his head or his chest 
and don t pull the trigger  boris 
squeeze it 
hey  where did you go to finishing school 
on a pirate ship 
let s just make sure
our plans are straight 
okay  here s one 
you flirt with him 
bring him back here after dinner 
lull him into a state of satisfaction 
and i ll shoot him 
 i ll shoot him  
can you believe i m talking like this 
yes  yes  spain is quite warm
this time of year 
barcelona is warmer than madrid 
but then  the people are so different 
the barcelonians and the madridniks 
are all the ladies in spain 
as beautiful as you are  madam 
oh  well  not all 
you ve gotta have some beasts 
oh  general  do excuse me  madam 
oh  yes  yes 
take it easy  will you 
you re making a fool of yourself 
  hey  this is good champagne 
  yeah 
have you had enough 
or are you gonna drink another case 
i ll be fine 
all i need is a few solids 
a few solids 
you should drink a blotter 
oh  i believe i had the pleasure
of meeting your sister once 
my sister  which one 
  i thought you only had one 
  one  one  no 
oh  no  no  actually  well 
i have a half sister 
well  no  not exactly half 
  it s two fifths 
  oh 
ladies and gentlemen 
his imperial highness 
the emperor napoleon 
so you are don francisco 
yes  i have regards
from your brother in spain 
says you went away 
you don t write  nothing 
comes a friday night 
he never hears from you 
you took his razor 
you never returned it 
  this is an honor for me 
  no  it s a greater honor for me 
  no  a greater honor for me 
  no  it s a greater honor for me 
no  a greater honor for me 
well  perhaps you are right 
perhaps it is a greater honor for you 
and you must be don francisco s sister 
no  you must be don francisco s sister 
no  it s a greater honor for me 
i see our spanish guests
have a sense of humor 
  yeah  she s a great kidder 
  no  you re a great kidder 
no  you re don francisco s sister 
  shall we dine 
  oh  can we eat first 
your sister and his highness
seem to be getting along quite well 
do you find me attractive as a man 
yes  i think that s your best bet 
how much of your feelings for me are
because i ve conquered half of europe 
oh  i d say half my feelings 
it evens out 
i wonder if you should be
more difficult to conquer than russia 
well  i weigh less 
i ll go to your room after dinner 
good  i ll go to yours 
come in 
sonja    sonja  i ve been thinking
about this  it s murder 
what if everybody acted like this 
it d be a world full of murderers 
you know what that would do
to property values 
i know  and if everybody went
to the same restaurant
on the same evening
and ordered blintzes 
there d be chaos  but they don t 
i m telling her murder 
and she s telling me blintzes 
hey  you said yourself 
there is no right or wrong 
  it s what you choose 
  that s right  and i choose danger 
  oh  really 
  no  but it did sounded great 
oh  boris 
if only we could be children again 
yeah  i know 
preferably french children 
do you know the only truly happy person
i know is berdykov  the village idiot 
well  it s easy to be happy 
you know  if your one concern in life
is figuring out how much
saliva to dribble 
kiss me 
  which one do you want 
  give me a number eight 
number eight  that s two fours 
oh  that s an easy one 
oh  coming 
coming 
  are you alone 
  of course 
  i thought i heard voices 
  i was praying 
  i heard two voices 
  oh  i do both parts 
  champagne  from france 
  oh 
i see you brought the whole kit 
  to your eyes 
  to the bridge of your nose 
my lust knows no bounds 
shall we  to the bed 
shall we what to the bed 
forgive my haste 
we have always heard
that spanish blood is the hottest 
  i had mine cooled for the summer 
  you may set the pace 
good  good 
why don t we just sit a while
and build slowly 
you don t wanna peak too early 
you ll be back in your room
before midnight 
you are a temptress 
oh  please  excellency 
  call me napoleon 
  good  you can call me napoleon  too 
i ve never met a woman like you 
i could rest my head on your shoulder
like this forever 
yes  it sounds like it d be fun
except for the grease mark 
his excellency 
  what s that 
  oh  just a breeze 
  breeze 
  a breeze with mice 
mice  what s the difference 
if i had a woman like you
instead of my wife 
i would conquer all of europe 
  what s that 
  what    oh  that 
i think that was just
the old closet door slamming shut 
one can t be too careful 
the russian underground
would love me dead 
i take a great chance
in an occupied territory 
assassins surround me 
every day is another encounter
with death 
oh  yes  well  this is the price
one pays for political power 
yes  life at the top is hell 
which is why i relish
every minute with you 
every second means something to me 
that s why the sooner we   
the sooner we consummate
the act of love the happier i will be 
  oh  go ahead 
  i can t 
  don francisco 
  shoot 
put down that pistol  she s over 18 
you re a tyrant and a dictator 
and you start wars 
why is he reciting my credits 
  kill him 
  guards 
no 
boris  we re not here on a vacation 
well  i can t shoot him 
he s a live human being 
he ll bleed on the carpet 
give me that gun 
  oh 
  see  it s not so easy 
  why  why can t i do it 
  because it s morally wrong 
oh  i see 
well  can you define your terms 
yes  there s a moral imperative
involved here 
yeah  where   
where s the moral imperative 
don t you see  by killing napoleon 
you re actually killing yourself
because we were involved
in a kind of total absolute 
oh  come on  this isn t a total absolute 
you re being pantheistic again 
  how is that pantheistic 
  come on 
we all relate universally to a giant oneness 
oh  you wanna hit him  he s coming
to again  just give him a little shot 
yeah  good  you see  we re dealing
with an ethical question here 
oh  come on  boris  you re not
gonna quote thomas aquinas again 
absolutely  where he said 
 you must never kill a man
 particularly if it means
taking his life  
  what s the matter 
  don t you see 
and if we don t stop him 
he ll burn down half of europe 
well  maybe we ll get lucky  and he ll
do the half with our landlord in it 
  boris  for our children 
  we don t have children 
  then for our parents 
  they don t have children  either 
well  i m going back
and i m gonna kill him 
  sonja 
  i am 
no 
all right  look  pull the carriage
out front  i ll go kill him 
look at him 
if i don t kill him 
he ll make war all through europe 
but murder 
what would socrates say 
all those greeks were homosexuals 
boy  they must ve had some wild parties 
i bet they all took a house together
on crete for the summer 
a  socrates is a man 
b  all men are mortal 
c  all men are socrates 
that means all men are homosexuals 
oh  i m not a homosexual 
once  some cossacks whistled at me 
i happen to have the kind of body
that excites both persuasions 
but    you know 
some men are heterosexual
and some men are bisexual
and some men don t think about sex
at all  you know  they become lawyers 
my problem is that
i see both sides of every issue 
i m too logical 
you know  i   
the world is not logical 
if it was logical  how would old nehamkin
be younger than young nehamkin 
i knew there was something crazy
about that when i was a kid
but every time i said something 
they d smack me  so  you know   
i m just racked with guilt
and i m consumed with remorse
and stricken with suffering
for the human race 
not only that  but i m developing
a herpes on my lip here
that is really killing me 
oh  what to do 
arrest this man for murder 
fortunately  he only killed an impostor 
i didn t do anything 
hey  take it easy  will you 
you re bending my throat 
the spanish government
will hear about this 
don francisco is not a man
who takes these things lightly 
oh  there s don francisco now 
there s been a mistake  i know  i made it 
by some miracle  sonja managed
to elude the french and escape 
i  with my usual good luck  got thrown
in a damp cell to await execution 
my favorite pastime 
fortunately  it was a french jail 
so the food was not bad 
my family was allowed to visit me 
remember that nice boy next door 
raskolnikov 
  yeah 
  he killed two ladies 
no  what a nasty story 
bobick told it to me 
he heard it from
one of the karamazov brothers 
oh  he must have been possessed 
  well  he was a raw youth 
  raw youth  he was an idiot 
and he acted insulted and injured 
well  i hear he was a gambler 
  you know  he could be your double 
  oh  really  how novel 
son  for long years  i have
saved this piece of land for you 
look  it has a house on it 
it s a nice little house  too 
you haven t wasted your life  i see 
don t let any strangers come on it 
no  no strangers 
you re a major loon  you know that 
  next year   
  yes 
  i expect to build a guest house 
  oh  a little tiny guest house
with a handball court  and a little 
swimming pool for fleas or something 
yes  well  you ll want to get some rest
in your rubber bedroom now 
who are you 
i am an angel of god 
you re kidding 
fear not  boris 
you have led a just life 
and at the last minute
before the execution 
the emperor plans to pardon you 
really 
he will make a great personal show
of his generosity
and you will have learned your lesson 
but you will not be executed 
then there is a god  incredible 
moses was right 
he that abideth in truth
and will have frankincense and myrrh
smeared on his gums in abundance
and he shall dwell in the house
of the lord for six months
with an option to buy 
but the wicked man   
the wicked man shall have
all kinds of problems 
his tongue shall cleave
to the roof of his upper palate
and he shall speak like a woman 
if you watch him closely 
and he shall    he shall   
the wicked man shall be delivered
into the hands of his enemy
whether they can pay
the delivery charge or not 
and    and    wait  i have more
about the wicked man 
i shall walk through the valley
of the shadow of death 
in fact  now that i think of it 
i shall run through
the valley of the shadow of death
 cause you get out of the valley
quicker that way 
and he that hath clean hands
and a pure heart
is okay in my book 
but he that fools around
with barnyard animals
has gotta be watched 
i thank you 
all right  grushenko  come on  let s go 
you guys are late 
i ve been waiting here since 6 30 
you re awfully cheerful 
yeah  you know how it is
when you re extra brave 
probably not 
busy day  are you guys having a sale 
oh  no blindfold  that s for losers 
i like to see where the bullet hits 
i learned that during the war 
i was decorated  you know  yeah 
wonder what the emperor s doing today 
ready 
you guys want to move a little closer 
you don t wanna miss  you  know 
looks bad on the report 
aim 
boy  the emperor s
really cutting it close 
what a flair for the dramatic 
that old sly boots 
fire 
it s a very complicated situation 
cousin sonja 
i m in love with alexi  he loves alicia 
alicia s having an affair with lev 
lev loves tatiana 
tatiana loves simkin 
simkin loves me 
i love simkin  but in a
different way than alexi 
alexi loves tatiana like a sister 
tatiana s sister loves trigorian
like a brother 
trigorian s brother is having an affair
with my sister 
whom he likes physically 
but not spiritually 
natasha  it s getting a little late 
the firm of mishkin and mishkin
is sleeping with
the firm of taskov and taskov 
natasha  to love is to suffer 
to avoid suffering  one must not love 
but then one suffers from not loving 
therefore  to love is to suffer 
not to love is to suffer 
to suffer is to suffer 
to be happy is to love 
to be happy  then  is to suffer 
but suffering makes one unhappy 
therefore  to be unhappy one must love 
or love to suffer 
or suffer from too much happiness 
i hope you re getting this down 
i never want to marry 
i just want to get divorced 
oh  look  look  it s boris 
boris  boris  what happened 
  i got screwed 
  how 
i don t know  some vision came and said
that i was gonna get pardoned 
and they shot me 
you were my one great love 
oh  thank you very much  i appreciate that 
now  if you ll excuse me  i m dead 
  what s it like 
  what s it like 
you know the chicken
at tresky s restaurant 
  yeah 
  it s worse 
worse than the chicken at tresky s 
oh  well  life must go on 
the last traces of the shimmering dusk
are setting behind
the quickly darkening evening
and it s only noon 
soon we shall be covered by wheat 
did you say   wheat  
wheat 
wheat  i m dead 
they re talking about wheat 
the question is 
have i learned anything about life 
only that    only that human beings
are divided into mind and body 
the mind embraces
all the nobler aspirations 
like poetry and philosophy 
but the body has all the fun 
the important thing  i think 
is not to be bitter 
you know  if it turns out that there is a god 
i don t think that he s evil 
i think that the worst
you could say about him
is that basically he s an underachiever 
after all  you know  there are
worse things in life than death 
i mean  if you ve ever spent an evening
with an insurance salesman 
you know exactly what i mean 
the key here  i think 
is to not think of death as an end 
but think of it more
as a very effective way
of cutting down on your expenses 
regarding love   
you know  what can you say 
it s not the quantity
of your sexual relations that count 
it s the quality
