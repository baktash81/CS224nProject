people think we run around
putting out fires  but
around 70  of the calls we get
are for other types of services 
 like what 
 for example 
broken water mains 
or pet rescue  too 
even though it sounds cliché 
it s true

it s nearly 2 a m  and we re
still sealed in this building that
we came to with the firemen
earlier this evening 
to assist an elderly lady
who later attacked a policeman
and a fireman  they re both
in critical condition 
the police won t let us leave
and are giving us no explanations 
the neighbors are scared to death 
they want to go back home 
they want to know
what s going on 
guillem  do you mind if
i ask you a few quick questions 
i ve never been in such
a serious situation before 
i m an intern  i give shots 
take people s blood pressure 
i live in this building 
well  the injured are
in critical condition 
this is very serious 
the police have several bite wounds 
he s very injured 
what s obvious is that
mrs  izquierdo attacked
and bit them 
i guess
she had a fit of hysteria 
but honestly  it s hard to believe 
that   
an old lady could do
something like this to two adults 
i guess when the doctor arrives 
apart from bringing supplies
to treat the wounded 
he ll tell us what s going on 
we re locked in here  the police
are outside  we can t get out 
we have no explanations 
they know these men are here 
and we have to get them out soon 
they ve lost a lot of blood 
i can t do anything else 
stay with them  thanks 
we re going to keep on interviewing 
if you don t like something
you can cut  ok

threw on what clothes i could 
and came down here 
i have to change my clothes

 the vatican is investigating   
the possible possession
of a portuguese girl  
portugal is moved by
the case of a possessed girl
 fuck

to do with   
look 
a tape recorder 
 there s no electricity

there 
i ve finally isolated the enzyme 
the problem is that it s unstable 
it deteriorates when it
comes into contact with oxygen 
i am  however  optimistic 
if all goes well
we ll have a vaccine soon 
the analyses were successful 
what the hell is he talking about 
something unexpected has happened 
the enzyme is not only resistant
but has mutated 
it behaves much like the flu 
this leads us
to a horrible conclusion 
it might be contagious 
i don t get it 
the telegram from rome
has arrived 
the medeiros girl must die 
he s talking about the girl  pablo 
she was here 
i must eliminate her and erase
all signs of her existence 
what the hell is this guy saying

this decision should
have been made years ago 
this has all been a big mistake 
i must follow the procedures 
the ritual is very specific 
come here  stay close 
i m going to seal off the room 
the seal should keep her in 
if anything goes wrong 
may god help us
