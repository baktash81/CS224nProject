a serious situation before
im an intern i give shots
take peoples blood pressure

whats obvious is that
mrs izquierdo attacked

something like this to two adults
i guess when the doctor arrives
apart from bringing supplies
to treat the wounded

there
ive finally isolated the enzyme
the problem is that its unstable
it deteriorates when it
comes into contact with oxygen
i am however optimistic
if all goes well
well have a vaccine soon
the analyses were successful
what the hell is he talking about
something unexpected has happened
the enzyme is not only resistant
but has mutated
it behaves much like the flu
this leads us
to a horrible conclusion
it might be contagious
i dont get it
the telegram from rome
has arrived
the medeiros girl must die
hes talking about the girl pablo
she was here
i must eliminate her and erase
all signs of her existence
what the hell is this guy saying
finally my prayers
have been answered
we have to get out of here
this decision should
have been made years ago
this has all been a big mistake
i must follow the procedures
the ritual is very specific
come here stay close
im going to seal off the room
the seal should keep her in
if anything goes wrong
may god help us
wait
im going to look
no
there might be a way out
through the attic
we have to give it a try
what are you going to do
ill record whats up there
and we can look at it
pablo bring the camera down
there are really weird noises
what happened
something hit the camera
turn it on
the fucking light broke
turn it on pablo
i cant its busted
fuck what now
relax dont move
ill turn on the night vision
ok i can see you now
thats good
stick your hand out
i cant see you where are you
ok i got you
relax its me
i can see if i use the camera
get behind me and dont let go
well be ok
were going to get out
ill find the way out
dont let go ok
stay still
why
theres something
go back
dont make a sound
get down
keep quiet for gods sake
it cant see us
if it cant hear us it wont find us
lets go
run
pablo
