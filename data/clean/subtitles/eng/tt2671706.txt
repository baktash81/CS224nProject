be in one place long enough
to fix on em right as their daddy
i figured i was going searching too
as it turn out
i been hooked up with lucille
for near about as long as
your daddy been with rose
going on 16 years
sometimes i wish
id never known my daddy
he aint cared nothing about no kids
a kid to him wasnt nothing
all he wanted you to do
was learn how to walk
so he could start you to working
come to eating he ate first
anything left over thats what you got
man would sit down
eat two chickens and give you the wing
you ought to stop that pop
everybody feed their kids
no matter how hard times is
everybody care about their kids
make sure they have something to eat
only thing my daddy cared about
was getting them bales of cotton
in to mr lubin
thats the only thing
that mattered to him
sometimes i used to wonder
why he was still living
why the devil hadnt come and got him
get them bales of cotton
in to mr lubin
find out he owe him money
he should have just
went on and left
when he saw he couldnt get nowhere
thats what i wouldve done
how he gonna leave with 11 kids
and where he gonna go
he aint knew nothing but how to farm
no he was trapped
i think he knew it too
but ill say this for him
he felt a responsibility toward us
may not have treated us
like i felt he should have
but without that responsibility
he could have run off and left us
made his own way
a lot of them did
back in those days
what you talkin about
mmmmmm
they walk out their front door
and take off down one road or another
and just keep on walkin
there you go
thats what im talkin about
just keep on walking
till they come to something else
aint you never heard of nobody
having the walking blues
now thats what you call it
when you just take off like that
mmm my daddy aint had no
walking blues
what you talking about
he stayed right there with his family
but he was just as evil as he could be
my mama couldnt stand him
couldnt stand that evilness
she run off when i was about eight
she sneaked off one night
told me she was coming back for me
i aint never seen her no more
all his women run off and left him
he wasnt good for nobody
my turn come to head out
i was 14
got to sniffing around
joe canewells daughter
we had this old mule called greyboy
my daddy sent me out
to do some plowing
i got to fooling around
with joe canewells daughter
found us a nice spot
got real cozy with each other
she was about 13
so we done figured we grown anyway
so we were down there by the creek
enjoying ourselves
aint thinking about nothing
didnt know greyboy had gotten loose
wandered back to the house
and my daddy was lookin for me
so we down there enjoying ourselves
when he come up on us
surprised us
had them leather straps off that mule
commenced to whupping me
like there was no tomorrow
i jump up im mad embarrassed
i was scared of my daddy
now when he commenced
to whipping on me
quite naturally
i run to get out of the way
now i think hes mad
cause i aint done my work
but i see where hes chasing me off
so he can have the gal for himself
when i see what the matter of it was
i lost all fear of my daddy
and right there i became a man
fourteen years of age
now its my turn to run him off
i picked up them same reins
he used on me
i picked up them reins
i commenced to whupping on him
gal jump up she run off
when he turned to face me
i knew why the devil
never come and get him
cause he was the devil himself
i dont know what happened
i woke up
laying there by the creek
and blue this old dog we had
he was licking my face
both my eyes were swoll shut
i thought i was blind
i couldnt see nothing
i just laid there and cried
and i didnt know what i was gonna do
but i knew the time had come
for me to leave my daddys house
suddenly the world got big and
it was a long time before i could
cut it down to where i could handle it
part of that cutting down
was where i got to the place
where i could feel him
kicking in my blood
and i knew the only thing
that separated us
was a matter of a few years
what you got there

everybody got different
fathers and mothers

of the thing away
and you dont want to either
maybe you want to wish me
and my boy away
maybe thats what you want
well you cant wish us away
i got 18 years of my life invested in you
you ought to have stayed upstairs
in my bed where you belong
now listen to me
we can get a handle on this thing
we can talk this out
come to an understanding
all of a sudden its we
where was we at
when you were down there
rolling around
with some godforsaken woman
we shouldve
come to an understanding
before you started making
a damn fool of yourself
youre a day late and a dollar short
when it comes to
an understanding with me
rose its just that
she gives me a different idea
a different understanding about myself
i can step out of this house
and get away from the pressures
and the problems be a different man
i aint got to worry about
how ill get the roof fixed
or pay the bills or
i can just
be a part of myself
i aint never been before
what i want to know is
what i want to know
is do you plan to continue seeing her
thats all you can say to me
i could sit up in her house and laugh
you understand what im saying
i could laugh out loud and it feels good
it reaches all the way down
to the bottom of my shoes
rose i
i cant give that up
well maybe you ought to go on
and stay down there with her
if shes a better woman than me
it aint about nobody being
a better woman or nothing
rose you aint to blame
a man couldnt ask
for a better wife than youve been
im responsible for it
i done locked myself into a pattern
trying to take care of you all
that i forgot about myself
well what the hell was i there for
that was my job not somebody elses
rose listen to me
i done tried all my life to live decent
to live a clean hard useful life
i try to be a good husband to you
in every way i know how
maybe i come into the world backwards
i dont know
but youre born with two strikes on you
before you come to the plate
you got to guard it closely
always looking for the curveball
on the inside corner
you cant afford a called strike
you cant let nothing get past you
if youre going down
youre doing down swinging
everything lined up against you
what you gonna do
i fooled them rose i bunted
when i found you and cory
and a halfway decent job i was safe
couldnt nothing touch me
i wasnt gonna strike out no more
i wasnt going back to the penitentiary
i wasnt gonna
lie in the street with a bottle of wine
i was safe i had me a family
a job
i wasnt gonna get that last strike
i was standing on first base
waiting for one of them boys
to knock me in to bring me home
you should have stayed in my bed troy
then i saw the gal
she firmed up my backbone
i got to thinkin that if i tried
maybe i could steal second
you understand
you shouldve held me tight
you shouldve grabbed me and held on
i stood on first base for 18 years
and i thought well
god damn it go on for it
we aint talking about baseball
we talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman
then bringing it home to me
thats what were talking about
were not talkin about no baseball
rose youre not listening to me
im trying to explain it to you
the best way i know how
its not easy for me to admit
that ive been standing
in the same place for 18 years
well ive been standing with you
ive been right here with you troy
i got a life too
i gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you
dont you think
i ever wanted other things
dont you think
i had dreams and hopes
what about my life what about me
dont you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men
that i wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities
that i wanted someone
to make me laugh
so i could feel good
youre not the only one
whos got wants and needs
but i held on to you troy
i took all my feelings
my wants and needs and dreams
and i buried them inside you
i planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it
i planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom
and it didnt take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky
and it wasnt never gonna bloom
but i held on to you troy
i held you tighter
you was my husband
i owed you everything i had
every part of me i could find to give you
and upstairs in that bedroom
with the darkness falling in on me
i gave everything i had
to try and erase the doubt
that you wasnt the finest man
in the world
and wherever you was going
i was gonna be there with you
because you was my husband
cause thats the only way
i was gonna survive as your wife

you aint going to your daddys funeral
mama listen
i dont want to hear it cory
just get that thought out of your head
ive got to say no to him
one time in my life i got to say no
i dont got to listen to that
now i know you and your daddy
aint seen eye to eye
but i dont have to listen
to that kind of talk this morning
disrespecting your daddy
aint gonna make you a man cory
you gotta find some way
to come to that on your own
not going to your daddys funeral
aint gonna make you a man
the whole time i was growing up
living in his house
papa was like a shadow
that followed you everywhere
it weighed on you
and it sunk into your flesh
it would wrap around you and lay there
until you couldnt tell
which one was you anymore
that shadow just diggin into your flesh
trying to crawl in
trying to live through you
everywhere i looked i saw troy maxson
staring right back at me
hiding under the bed in the closet
im just saying i got to find a way
to get rid of that shadow mama
you just like him
you got him in you good
dont tell me that mama
you troy maxson all over again
i dont want to be troy maxson
i just want to be me
you cant be nobody
but who you are cory
that shadow wasnt nothing
but you growing into yourself
you either got to grow into it
or cut it down to fit you
but thats all you got to make a life with
thats all you got to measure yourself
against the world out there
your daddy wanted you to be
everything he wasnt
and at the same time
he wanted you to be everything he was
now i dont know
if he was right or wrong
but i do know
he meant to do more good
than he meant to do harm
sometimes when he touched
he bruised
and sometimes
when he took me in his arms he cut
when i first met your daddy
i thought
here is a man
i can lay down with and make a baby
thats the first thing
i thought when i seen him
i thought rose lee
heres a man
you can open yourself up to
and be filled to bursting
heres a man that can
fill up all them empty spaces
you been tipping around the edges of
when your daddy
walked through the house
he was just
so big
he filled it up
that was my first mistake
not to make him
leave some room for me
but
i wanted a house i could sing in
and thats what your daddy gave me
i didnt know to keep up his strength
i had to give up little pieces of mine
i took on his life as mine
and mixed up the pieces
so you couldnt hardly tell
which was which
it was my choice my life
and i didnt have to live it like that
but thats what life offered me
in the way of being a woman
and i took it
i grabbed it with both hands
and by the time
raynell came into the house
i didnt want to make my blessings
off of nobodys misfortune
but i took on to raynell like she was
all them babies i wanted and never had
like id been blessed
to relive a part of my life
and if the lord see fit
to keep up my strength
im gonna do her exactly
how your daddy did you
im gonna give her
the best of whats in me
