boy walking around here
smelling his piss 
thinking he gonna do
what he want to do 
irregardless of what i say 
look here  bono 
i left the commissioner s office
and went down to the a p 
that boy ain t workin  down there 
he lied to me 
t ellin  me he got his job back 
tellin  me he workin  weekend 
tellin  me he workin  after school 
mr  stawicki says
he ain t working down there at all 
cory just growing up 
he just bustin  at the seams 
tryin  to fill out your shoes 
i don t care what he doing 
when he get to the place
where he want to disobey me 
then it s time for him to move on 
bono will tell you that 
i bet he ain t never disobeyed his daddy
without paying the consequences 
i ain t never had the chance 
my daddy came on through 
but i ain t never knew him to see him 
or what he had on his mind 
or where he went 
just moving on through 
searching out the new land 
that s what the old folks used to call it 
see a fella moving around
from place to place  woman to woman 
they call it
 searching out the new land  
i can t say if he ever found it 
i come along  didn t want no kids 
i didn t know if i was gonna
be in one place long enough
to fix on  em right as their daddy 
i figured i was going searching  too 
as it turn out 
i been hooked up with lucille
for near about as long as
your daddy been with rose 
going on 16 years 
sometimes  i wish
i d never known my daddy 
he ain t cared nothing about no kids 
a kid to him wasn t nothing 
all he wanted you to do
was learn how to walk 
so he could start you to working 
come to eating  he ate first 
anything left over  that s what you got 
man would sit down 
eat two chickens  and give you the wing 
you ought to stop that  pop 
everybody feed their kids 
no matter how hard times is 
everybody care about their kids 
make sure they have something to eat 
only thing my daddy cared about
was getting them bales of cotton
in to mr  lubin 
that s the only thing
that mattered to him 
sometimes  i used to wonder
why he was still living 
why the devil hadn t come and got him 
 get them bales of cotton
in to mr  lubin  
find out he owe him money 
he should have just
went on and left
when he saw he couldn t get nowhere 
that s what i would ve done 
how he gonna leave with 11 kids 
and where he gonna go 
he ain t knew nothing but how to farm 
no  he was trapped 
i think he knew it  too 
but i ll say this for him   
he felt a responsibility toward us 
may not have treated us
like i felt he should have 
but without that responsibility 
he could have run off and left us 
made his own way 
a lot of them did 
back in those days 
what you talkin  about 
  mmm mmm 
  they walk out their front door
and take off down one road or another
and just keep on walkin  
there you go 
that s what i m talkin  about 
just keep on walking
till they come to something else 
ain t you never heard of nobody
having the walking blues 
now  that s what you call it
when you just take off like that 
mmm  my daddy ain t had no
walking blues 
what you talking about 
he stayed right there with his family 
but he was just as evil as he could be 
my mama couldn t stand him 
couldn t stand that evilness 
she run off when i was about eight 
she sneaked off one night 
told me she was coming back for me 
i ain t never seen her no more 
all his women run off and left him 
he wasn t good for nobody 
my turn come to head out 
i was 14 
got to sniffing around
joe canewell s daughter 
we had this old mule called  greyboy  
my daddy sent me out
to do some plowing 
i got to fooling around
with joe canewell s daughter 
found us a nice spot 
got real cozy with each other 
she was about 13 
so we done figured we grown anyway 
so  we were down there by the creek 
enjoying ourselves 
ain t thinking about nothing 
didn t know greyboy had gotten loose 
wandered back to the house 
and my daddy was lookin  for me 
so  we down there enjoying ourselves
when he come up on us 
surprised us 
had them leather straps off that mule 
commenced to whupping me
like there was no tomorrow 
i jump up  i m mad  embarrassed 
i was scared of my daddy 
now  when he commenced
to whipping on me 
quite naturally 
i run to get out of the way 
now  i think he s mad
 cause i ain t done my work 
but i see where he s chasing me off 
so he can have the gal for himself 
when i see what the matter of it was 
i lost all fear of my daddy 
and right there  i became a man 
fourteen years of age 
now  it s my turn to run him off 
i picked up them same reins
he used on me 
i picked up them reins 
i commenced to whupping on him 
gal jump up  she run off 
when he turned to face me 
i knew why the devil
never come and get him
 cause he was the devil himself 
i don t know what happened 
i woke up 
laying there by the creek 
and blue  this old dog we had 
he was licking my face 
both my eyes were swoll shut 
i thought i was blind 
i couldn t see nothing 
i just laid there and cried 
and i didn t know what i was gonna do 
but i knew the time had come
for me to leave my daddy s house 
suddenly  the world got big  and   
it was a long time before i could
cut it down to where i could handle it 
part of that cutting down
was where i got to the place
where i could feel him
kicking in my blood 
and i knew the only thing
that separated us
was a matter of a few years 
what you got there 
uncle gabe 
i got me a ham sandwich 
rose gave me a ham sandwich 
i lost touch with everybody
except gabriel 
but   
i hope he s dead 
i hope he found some peace 
that s a heavy story  pop 
i didn t know you left home
when you was 14 
fourteen s kinda young
to be on your own 
i don t know what i would ve done 
well  i got up from that creek 
walked on down to mobile 
i was through with farming

or pay the bills  or   
i can just
be a part of myself
i ain t never been before 
what i want to know is   
what i want to know
is do you plan to continue seeing her 
that s all you can say to me 
i could sit up in her house and laugh 
you understand what i m saying 
i could laugh out loud  and it feels good 
it reaches all the way down
to the bottom of my shoes 
rose  i   
i can t give that up 
well  maybe you ought to go on
and stay down there with her 
if she s a better woman than me 
it ain t about nobody being
a better woman  or nothing 
rose  you ain t to blame 
a man couldn t ask
for a better wife than you ve been 
i m responsible for it 
i done locked myself into a pattern 
trying to take care of you all 
that i forgot about myself 
well  what the hell was i there for 
that was my job  not somebody else s 
rose  listen to me 
i done tried all my life to live decent 
to live a clean  hard  useful life 
i try to be a good husband to you 
in every way i know how 
maybe i come into the world backwards 
i don t know 
but you re born with two strikes on you
before you come to the plate 
you got to guard it closely 
always looking for the curveball
on the inside corner 
you can t afford a called strike 
you can t let nothing get past you 
if you re going down 
you re doing down swinging 
everything lined up against you 
what you gonna do 
i fooled them  rose  i bunted 
when i found you and cory
and a halfway decent job  i was safe 
couldn t nothing touch me 
i wasn t gonna strike out no more 
i wasn t going back to the penitentiary 
i wasn t gonna
lie in the street with a bottle of wine 
i was safe  i had me a family 
a job 
i wasn t gonna get that last strike 
i was standing on first base 
waiting for one of them boys
to knock me in  to bring me home 
you should have stayed in my bed  troy 
then i saw the gal 
she firmed up my backbone 
i got to thinkin  that if i tried 
maybe i could steal second 
  you understand 
  you should ve held me tight 
  you should ve grabbed me and held on 
  i stood on first base for 18 years 
and i thought  well 
god damn it  go on for it 
we ain t talking about baseball 
we talking about you going off
and laying up with another woman 
then bringing it home to me 
that s what we re talking about 
we re not talkin  about no baseball 
rose  you re not listening to me 
i m trying to explain it to you
the best way i know how 
it s not easy for me to admit
that i ve been standing
in the same place for 18 years 
well  i ve been standing with you 
i ve been right here with you  troy 
i got a life  too 
i gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you 
don t you think
i ever wanted other things 
don t you think
i had dreams and hopes 
what about my life  what about me 
don t you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men 
that i wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities 
that i wanted someone
to make me laugh 
so i could feel good 
you re not the only one
who s got wants and needs 
but i held on to you  troy 
i took all my feelings 
my wants and needs and dreams 
and i buried them inside you 
i planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it 
i planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom 
and it didn t take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky 
and it wasn t never gonna bloom 
but i held on to you  troy 
i held you tighter 
you was my husband 
i owed you everything i had 
every part of me i could find to give you 
and upstairs in that bedroom 
with the darkness falling in on me 
i gave everything i had
to try and erase the doubt
that you wasn t the finest man
in the world 
and wherever you was going 
i was gonna be there with you 
because you was my husband 
 cause that s the only way
i was gonna survive as your wife 
you always talking about what you give
and what you don t have to give 
but you take  too  troy

and don t even know nobody s giving 
you say i take and don t give

it would wrap around you and lay there
until you couldn t tell
which one was you anymore 
that shadow just diggin  into your flesh 
trying to crawl in 
trying to live through you 
everywhere i looked  i saw troy maxson
staring right back at me 
hiding under the bed  in the closet 
i m just saying i got to find a way
to get rid of that shadow  mama 
you just like him 
you got him in you good 
  don t tell me that  mama 
  you troy maxson all over again 
i don t want to be troy maxson 
i just want to be me 
you can t be nobody
but who you are  cory 
that shadow wasn t nothing
but you growing into yourself 
you either got to grow into it 
or cut it down to fit you 
but that s all you got to make a life with 
that s all you got to measure yourself
against the world out there 
your daddy wanted you to be
everything he wasn t 
and at the same time 
he wanted you to be everything he was 
now  i don t know
if he was right or wrong 
but i do know
he meant to do more good
than he meant to do harm 
sometimes  when he touched 
he bruised 
and sometimes 
when he took me in his arms  he cut 
when i first met your daddy 
i thought 
 here is a man
i can lay down with and make a baby  
that s the first thing
i thought when i seen him 
i thought   rose lee 
 here s a man
you can open yourself up to
 and be filled to bursting 
 here s a man that can
fill up all them empty spaces
 you been tipping around the edges of  
when your daddy
walked through the house 
he was just
so big 
he filled it up 
that was my first mistake 
not to make him
leave some room for me 
but
i wanted a house i could sing in 
and that s what your daddy gave me 
i didn t know to keep up his strength 
i had to give up little pieces of mine 
i took on his life as mine
and mixed up the pieces 
so you couldn t hardly tell
which was which 
it was my choice  my life 
and i didn t have to live it like that 
but that s what life offered me
in the way of being a woman 
and i took it 
i grabbed it with both hands 
and by the time
raynell came into the house   
i didn t want to make my blessings
off of nobody s misfortune 
but i took on to raynell like she was
all them babies i wanted and never had 
like i d been blessed
to relive a part of my life 
and if the lord see fit
to keep up my strength 
i m gonna do her exactly
how your daddy did you 
i m gonna give her
the best of what s in me
