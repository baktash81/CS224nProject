i was looking through
a window at my life today
and for the first time
i saw things in a different way
in the middle of my mind
it was there all the time
never explain love
its not like anything
youve ever done
if it is there its yours to keep
and the boundaries they grow deep
never explain love
let the experience take over you
and when you do
never explain love
i was looking for a reason
i was searching for a sign
to try and understand
this relationship of mine
but i didnt need to go far
i was reading it all wrong
never explain love
its not like anything
youve ever done
if it is there its yours to keep
and the boundaries they grow deep
never explain love
let the experience take over you
and when you do
never explain love
before i knew
i almost knew it all
who needs to be rational
when love isnt practical
oh i knew this was inside
and its so wrong
its so right
whoaohoh ahh
never explain love
its not like anything
youve ever done
if it is there its yours to keep
and the boundaries they grow deep
never explain love
let the experience take over you
and when you do
never explain love
its not like anything
youve ever done
if it is there its yours to keep
and the boundaries they grow deep
