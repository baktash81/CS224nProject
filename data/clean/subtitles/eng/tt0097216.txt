  i was looking through
a window at my life today  
  and for the first time  
  i saw things in a different way  
  in the middle of my mind  
  it was there all the time  
  never explain love  
  it s not like anything
you ve ever done  
  if it is there  it s yours to keep  
  and the boundaries  they grow deep  
  never explain love  
  let the experience take over you  
  and when you do  
  never explain love  
  i was looking for a reason  
  i was searching for a sign  
  to try and understand
this relationship of mine  
  but i didn t need to go far  
  i was reading it all wrong  
  never explain love  
  it s not like anything
you ve ever done  
  if it is there  it s yours to keep  
  and the boundaries  they grow deep  
  never explain love  
  let the experience take over you  
  and when you do  
  never explain love  
  before i knew  
  i almost knew it all  
  who needs to be rational  
  when love isn t practical  
  oh  i knew this was inside  
  and it s so wrong  
  it s so right  
  whoa oh oh  ahh  
  never explain love  
  it s not like anything
you ve ever done  
  if it is there  it s yours to keep  
  and the boundaries  they grow deep  
  never explain love  
  let the experience take over you  
  and when you do  
  never explain love  
  it s not like anything
you ve ever done  
  if it is there  it s yours to keep  
  and the boundaries  they grow deep
