clears throat could you
put out the cigarette please
why
i cant breathe back here
what are you talking about
smokes going in my lungs
im doing all the work here
thank you
chuckles
can plainly see
hissing exhale
and i know
im the one
you really love
new song begins
your ruby lips
your lovely eyes
made my life romantic
when you took
advantage of me
now i see
what are you looking at
that youre
the only one for me
you speak german huh
that was russian
yeah i was stationed
in germany in the army
i could pick up a little bit
of what you were saying there
watch out for them krauts
theyre all sneaks
kennedy shouldve bombed them
when he had the chance
plus now them cuban bastards
aint they supposed
to be following us
they have the itinerary
as long as they get
to the show on time
im not worried about it
and neither should you
i aint worried about nothing
in fact when you
see me worried youll know
tony
youll know if im worried
how about some quiet time
hmm
sure
your ruby lips
chuckles
its amazing you said that
how about some quiet time
dolores my wife
used to say that all the time
well not all the time
but you know
she says it when when i
come home from work sometimes
you know shes been
with the kids all day
and shell say tony
how about some quiet time
exactly like how you said it
i mean its amazing
how is that
salty
have you ever considered
becoming a food critic
no not really
why is there money in that
im just saying you have
a marvelous way with words
when describing food
salty
so vivid
one can almost taste it
hey im just saying
its salty
and salts cheating
any cook can make things salty
to make it taste good
without the salt
with just the other flavors
thats the trick
i mean you take
the basic ingredients
we should really get going soon
if we expect
to get to pittsburgh by dinner
hmm hey
when i was in the army
i knew a guy from pittsburgh
except he called it
titsburgh
cause he said all
the women there had huge tits
thats absurd
why would women in pittsburgh
have larger breasts
than say women in new york
guess well find out huh
chuckles
hey you know
when you first hired me
my wife went out
and bought one of your records
the one about the orphans
orphans
yeah
cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire
orpheus
yeah
orpheus in the underworld
its based on a french opera
and those werent children
on the cover
those were demons
in the bowels of hell
no shit
must have been naughty kids
tony sighs
what are
what are you doing
gotta take a leak doc
here now
you want me to piss my pants
whatcha gonna do
indistinct chatter
laughing in distance
horn honks in distance
woman laughing
indistinct chatter continues
oh hey doc
good afternoon
tony clears throat
take this for any incidentals
we may need
if you want to buy something
you dont have to ask
just keep the receipts please
when it runs low let me know
oh thanks
one more thing
well be attending many events
before and after the concerts
interacting
with some of the wealthiest
and most highly educated people
in the country
it is my feeling
that your diction
however charming it may be
in the tristate area
could use some finessing
you mean diction
like in what way
like in the only way
the word is ever used
okay
your intonation inflection
your choice of words
hey i got my own problems
now i gotta worry
about what people think
about the way i talk
there are simple techniques
i can teach you that are quite
effective i can help you
ii dont need no goddamn help
people dont like
the way i talk
they can go take a shit
the profanity is another issue
speaks italian
why are you breaking my balls
because you can do better
mr vallelonga
which brings me
to one more point
as the guest of honor
ill be introduced
when entering
these intimate events
you will be introduced as well
in my humble opinion
vallelonga may be difficult
to pronounce
so i was thinking
valle would be more appropriate
chuckles
tony valle short and sweet
eh
nah
they got a problem
with vallelonga
they can call me tony lip
these are genteel people
tony the lip may be
a little
worldly for them
well then its
tony vallelonga
all these highclass people
so much smarter than me
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities
youre telling me
they cant pronounce my name
they dont like it
they can shove it up their ass
ill just wait outside
a sound compromise

whimpering
trio playing upbeat song
tony
dear dolores
this morning
i had steak and eggs
for breakfast
the band has been playing
at very ritzy joints
dr shirley and i
are getting along pretty good
but sometimes
i think he gets sad
and thats why
he drinks too much
i never knew how very beautiful
this country was
now that im seeing it i know
you wont believe
how beautiful nature is
it is as beautiful as they say
and the traffic out here
in the country is nothing
which is fine by me
right now im eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner
that tastes like ketchup
on chinese noodles
we are heading down south now
i will write you another letter
when we get down south
i love you your husband tony
ps kiss the kids for me
song ends
applause
rock and roll playing
got any family doc
not really
not really
either you do or you dont
its a long story tony
what were in a hurry now
turns down music
lets hear it
i have a brother somewhere
we used to get together
once in a while
but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch
curse of being
a musician i guess
always on the road
like a carnival worker
hmm
or a criminal
took quite the toll
on my marriage as well
youre married
was
june
good person
terrible grammar
but a kind soul
youd quite like her
june
like uh like lassies mom
unfortunately
i couldnt do a husband act
and a concert pianist act
couldnt seem to manage
both worlds
tony
kentucky fried chicken
in kentucky

chuckles

anyone with your appetite

so you could have some
ive never had fried chicken
in my life
who you bullshitting
you people love
the fried chicken

negro cooks used to make it
all the time
when i was in the army
you have a very narrow
assessment of me tony
yeah right im good
no no youre not good
youre bad
im saying just because
other negroes enjoy
certain types of music
it doesnt mean i have to
nor do we all eat the same kind of food
whoa
wait a minute
if you said
all guineas like pizza
and spaghetti and meatballs
im not gonna get insulted
youre missing the point
for you to make the assumption
that every negro
hey you want some or not
no
here come on

it
huh
it smells okay
i prefer not to get grease
on my blanket
mocking ooh im gonna get
grease on my blankey

i think youre doing
a wonderful job

id like to formally offer you
the position

chuckles
i aint going nowhere doc
ii was just going down

chuckles
tony
im sorry about last night
dont worry about it
ive been working nightclubs
in new york city my whole life
i know its a
complicated world
tony
so whered you learn
how to play like that
my mother
your mother
really
mmhmm
she taught me how to play
on an old spinet
soon as i could walk wed
travel around
the florida panhandle
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls
fortunately
a man who had seen me play
arranged for me to study
at the leningrad conservatory
of music
i was the first negro
ever accepted there
thats where they taught you
all them songs you play
actually i was trained
to play classical music
brahms franz liszt
beethoven chopin
its all i ever wanted to play
but i was persuaded
by my record company
to pursue a career
in popular music instead
they insisted that audiences
would never accept
a negro pianist
on a classical stage
wanted to turn me into just
another colored entertainer
you know the guy whos smoking
while hes playing
and sets a glass of whiskey
on his piano
and then complains
because hes not respected
like arthur rubinstein
chuckling
you dont see arthur rubinstein
putting a glass of whiskey
on his piano
i dont know
personally i think
if you stuck
to the classic stuff
it wouldve been a big mistake
a mistake
performing the music i trained
my entire life to play
trained
what are you a seal
people love what you do
anyone could sound
like beethoven or
joe pan
or them other guys you said
but your music what you do
only you can do that
thank you tony
but not everyone
can play chopin
not like i can
i love my baby
shirley the trees have shed
their leafy clothing
and their colors have faded
to grays and browns
i saw millions of trees
all dusted with snow

dolores its getting cold

that stage i go right back
to being just another nigger
to them
because that is
their true culture
and i suffer that slight alone

six years ago in 1956
nat king cole
was invited to perform
at the municipal auditorium
here in birmingham
mr cole was the first negro
asked to play
at a white establishment
in this city
as soon as he started playing
a group of men
attack him for playing
white peoples music
they pull him off stage
and beat him badly
jesus christ
