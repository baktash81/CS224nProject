bart was a good
candidate for the job
the company has
a policy of hiring
well whenever they can
hes not mr personality
okay
i mean he has kind of
an odd way about him
you know
with people but
so how long
has he been here
uh two three years
almost three now
any trouble
no no hes very smart
and very capable
thanks
youre welcome
i forgot my wallet
excuse me
i finished my shift
it was 400 am
well actually around 345 am
because jack was early
my shift is eight to four
jack is my relief
but this morning he was early
i dont really know why
youd have to ask him about that
because i didnt ask him
so i dont really know
the reason why he was early
but he was
and so i left 15 minutes
before my shift was over
and i drove home by way
of reynolds boulevard
and arena drive
and i took a right
on eighth avenue
and then a left
on jay street to number 433
which is where i live
bart right bart
and i stopped and got
some ice cream on the way home
and when i got there
i ate the ice cream
and i watched
i watched
i watched tv
and i realized
i didnt have my wallet
that i must have left it
here at the hotel
so i had to come back
and get my wallet
because a wallet
is a very important thing
that you should never lose
or leave or forget
wow
yeah
so i did
so did you find it
near the vending machines
right where i left it
such a terrible thing huh
this is a terrible thing
how old are you
23
do you have a girlfriend
no
ever had a girlfriend
no
boyfriend
no
do you think about sex
that is also
a very complicated question
yeah yeah
yeah i know believe me
and it could take me
a long time to answer it
but in case you are inquiring
for your own personal reasons
you should know that
i am not interested
in what
in any sexual activities
that involve older men like you
got it got it
what about older women
does that
get you going huh
okay so um
so you went home and you
came back for the wallet
thats the story
yes
well your coworker says
that he never saw you leave
jack
yeah
as a matter of fact
he even said
your car was
still in the parking lot
before he heard the gunshot
and that its possible
that you never left
i went home early
around 345 am
and then i came back
through the side entrance
but why bart why
why not just come in
through the front door
because the side entrance is
closer to the vending machines
okay okay i buy that
hey bart you know you got
blood on your hands right
yes i was interested
in the blood so i touched it
her blood the blood
is interesting to you
yes
look i know you got issues
yes yes i do
i know you do i know it
and its called
aspergers im an aspie
thats a psychological condition
that is normally
or abnormally characterized
by abnormalities of social
communication and interaction
an aspie tends to
approach others awkwardly
and may engage in frequent
onesided longwinded speeches
such as this one
about a specific topic
while misunderstanding
and not recognizing
the listeners
feelings or reactions
hey bart
thinks the person will stop talking
bart bart please
can you just take a breath
can you take a breath for me
and then
bart youre a very smart guy
and yet what youre saying
to me doesnt make sense
why not
why not because
because why would you
leave your wallet
near the vending machine
and if you didnt
have your wallet
how did you pay
for the ice cream
im gonna need you to come
down and identify your wife
look im sorry im sorry
its routine
but you know
its important
maybe its not her
no no no no look
i dont
i dont wanna give you
any false hope
it is her
its your wife
okay
and uh
and then im gonna have
to ask you some questions
that kid
does he know something
well you know its
she owned a gun
karen owned a gun
a handgun for protection
the hell is she doing at a hotel
in the middle of the night
the next time you speak with
him it will be with a lawyer
all right you understand
maam we just asked him
a few questions
no no no
you dont ask him anything
you cannot keep him here
and you cannot bother him
with questions
because this is a fragile boy
and you need
to understand that
and respect that
maam look
we do understand that
but you need to
no no no no buts
you stay away from my boy
honey
you know you can
tell me anything honey
you can tell me
anything in the world
and i will always
be on your side
i love you
okay were not in lov
we could pretend
like im just some
easy piece of ass
that you meet in a hotel
regularly secretly
a fuck buddy
whatever they call it
is that what she is
shut up
shut up
the rough stuff huh
is that what you wan
is that what she liked

free of charge
in the queen suites
as well as sweeteners
and nondairy creamer
yeah
but its not
the best coffee is it
and god knows whats
in those nondairy things
vegetable fats replicate
the feel of milk fats
other common ingredients
include corn syrup sweeteners
flavorings such as
french vanilla and hazelnut
and sodium caseinate
a milk protein
that is derivative from casein
that does not contain lactose
well now i know
yes
i talk too much
no you dont
and then i dont talk
hey its okay really
im socially awkward
yes you are
my brother had it
yeah only his was worse
he couldnt really
function at all
he couldnt hold a job
nothing
you do pretty well
i have to practice
i have to prepare
what to say how to behave
i watch people
and i imitate
you watch people
yes
well i study them
yeah well i guess you have
a lot of people to watch
at the hotel
yes
because otherwise i just
feel like i dont belong
yeah i know what you mean
he had it you said
your brother he had it
what happened to him
um
he was institutionalized
for a long time
i used to visit him
and every time he would beg me
to get him out of there
but we just couldnt
and then he passed away
yes people die
and thats the end
so
yeah
okay bye
bye
i sent her a text
from you she isnt coming
she isnt
no
told her you couldnt make it
had to cancel like that
so guess youll have to
settle for me
one two three four
one two three four
one two three four
one two three four
one two three
is this anything
what does this mean
that there was a camera
in the room
look i cant even tell
if its her
okay
its okay
look turn it off please
its that kid
its that kid isnt it
possibly you know
hes very savvy
with this technological shit
you know and these kids
these kids on the spectrum
you know they could also be
very violent
what are you waiting for
arrest him
for what for what
for what for spying
come on thats all i have
and i barely have that
well he might have
seen something
yeah yeah you know what
he could have seen
everything
but you know that doesnt
mean he did anything does it
look i dont wanna
cause him any trouble
yeah well hes already
in a lot of trouble
well more trouble
hes a nice enough guy
little weird
so um what did you see
what i think i saw
it looked like one of our rooms
from the hotel
yeah on his ipad
i thought it was a movie
maybe some porn
i dont know
how someone like that gets off
but it seems like
porn would be the answer
and why would you say that
because it was creepy
the way he was
just sitting there
when i found him in the room
that night
just sitting
right
like he was waiting
for a bus
its fucking weird
you know
hi there
hey
i havent seen you
for a while
how are you
well thats a very
complicated question
yeah i bet it is
anyway its good
to see you now
nice to see you too
oh they did some work in
your room today on the ac unit
so if anything has moved
sure okay
you got a light
excuse me
a match
cigarette a light
smokings not permitted
on the premises
yeah i know that
yeah due largely to studies
that have shown
that when you have smoking
and nonsmoking rooms
nicotine residues
and other chemical traces
end up in hallways
and other rooms
including
nonsmoking rooms so
bart i know that
im going outside
by the pool
i just need a match
oh
i couldnt sleep
thats too bad
yeah it happens
when i drink too much
people drink too much
yeah they do
yeah
thanks
ill be outside
if you want some company
this is a towel
what are you doing
you cant just
turn around
goddamn
we dont have a lifeguard
a what
a lifeguard
right you dont have one
no
you should
yes in the water
come
come here sit
keep me company
you scared the hell out of me
im sorry
thats okay
you were kissing a man
in that car
yeah well
okay you saw us
yeah who was that
and why were you kissing him
thats a very
complicated question
oh
i guess so
you dont have someone
a girlfriend
like that
no
its difficult huh
yes
i bet
and theres the problem
of being perceived as odd
or unsophisticated
naive clueless
unfashionable
or just plain stupid
which youre not
youre not stupid are you
no
but thats the perception
so its very difficult
for people to know
whats going on
inside that head
yes thats correct
well i wanna know
what is going on inside bart
oh boy oh boy
what did you do
oh boy oh boy
oh boy oh boy
bart its okay
bart what did you do
what did you do bart
bart its okay
im sorry
was that wrong to do that
like that
because if that was wrong
to do that like that
i apologize
and ill never do anything
like that ever again
bart its okay
come here
why dont you come here
and sit with me
its loneliness bart
loneliness
makes us do things
hes married
the man i was with
hes a married man
weve been seeing each other
for a very long time
secretly
now
things have got
confusing between us
so i dont know
before
i knew what we were doing
but now
i have no idea
what youre trying to say
neither do i
a nerkle a nerd
and a seersucker too
a what
nerd
first documentation of the word
1950 dr seuss
if i ran a zoo
used to label persons as odd
or who are thought of
as sexually unattractive
but more recently
technological proficiency
is highly prized
so the nerd
is often celebrated
as a technosexual
or even a sexy love god
now i dont know
what youre trying to say
oh boy
oh boy oh boy
are we talking about you
yes
and what are you
trying to say about you
besides being
that youre a love god
i could be your lifeguard
yeah maybe you could
i dont know
ive never had one
maybe you could
bart
i need to get some sleep
i need to sleep okay
okay
okay good night
these are very close
to the picture
and very wellmade
nice fit
would you wear those
why yes i would
i dont want something
you would wear
why not
because youre old
insurance looks okay
registration pink slip
try this one this has been
a very popular scent
are you okay
i mean this is
a really good deal
you know
if theres something
wha
whats the matter
you need to lose weight
im sorry
please dont touch my skin
i wanna smell like this
well thats a picture
yes
obesity is not just
a cosmetic problem
its a health hazard
you can touch my hair
but please just dont touch my skin
my skin is mine
also youre at a very high risk
of heart disease
diabetes stroke
high blood pressure
cancer gallstones
osteoarthritis and gout
it doesnt smell
pictures dont smell
why not
because its a picture
im not obese
well you are very
very fat
okay bye
wow
hello hamelton hotel
how can i help you
yes andrea rivera
107 please
thank you
okay hold on
hello
hello
who does that
easy with that
honey i couldnt stop them
they have a search warrant
there was nothing i could do
hey bart how you doin
you dont have to talk to him
quite the setup
you got here my man
you dont have to say anything to him
well hello
he has no right to ask you
anything do you understand
mrs bromley i could either
talk to him here
or take him downtown
look its up to you
all right talk talk
thank you
so bart this is where
you spend your time huh
yes
kind of dark
you see thats what you
dont understand you see
this is his way
of seeing the world
no no no
im sorry im sorry
im sorry im sorry
hey bart um
your hard drives empty
yes i wiped it
they were on
your computer honey
there was nothing i could do
and you wiped everything
yes
and you didnt think
of backing it up
or maybe putting it on
an external hard drive maybe
no
well see bart
i dont believe that
i dont believe you
well thats too bad
belief systems
can be very tricky
yeah they can be bart
but youre hiding something
thats what
i really believe bart
so what are you hiding
hes not hiding anything
please
bart you get a lot of sympathy
for being like this
dont you huh
you get a little free pass
and what happens when
your moms not around
what happens when shes
not there to fix it for you
how bad does it get when
you get that lonely bart
what happens when you
get that frustrated bart
does it just explode bart
all right thats enough
stop it
please mrs bromley
please sit down
now im done fucking around
with you bart
you know why because
we found your fingerprints
all over the room
so what happened bart
what happened
did she invite you up
no
well maybe she was lonely
maybe you were lonely
maybe you went up
maybe you thought
you could have sex with her
and maybe things got
a little frustrating for you
maybe got a little out of hand
maybe you hit her bart
and then what hmm
and then what happened
well bart you tell me
then i guess i just pulled
a gun from my pocket
because i always have
a gun in my pocket
and i shot her
bart
but where did i get the gun
thats what i
would like to know
bart
did i buy it
did i steal it
maybe i purchased it online
and then when i went
to have sex with her
i brought the gun
because you know
its always a good idea
to take a gun
when you go to have sex
with someone because
just in case you suffer
from impotence
or performance anxiety
and you get frustrated
and you cant do it
then you have a gun
in your pocket
and by golly
you just take it out
and shoot that person
bang bang
and then the problem
is solved
so wheres
that gun now bart
that was a joke
whats the matter with you
he doesnt have a gun
he was making a joke
yeah that was a good one bart
that was real good
but you know what maam
we have a dead woman here
and i think bart knows
something about it
thats why im not laughing
is he sick
no i dont think so
i have jack
covering for him
hes not answering his cell
thank you for your concern
really
im sure hes okay
im sure hes fine
thanks
bart
bart honey are you down there
bartholomew im coming down
okay here i come
oh honey
there you are
you didnt touch your supper
arent you hungry
im fine
mr benson called
he was worried about you
i worry too bart
i worry all the time
life is hard honey
even for the best of us
life is very hard
when your father passed
that was very hard
i know it was hard for you
it was hard for me too
and never mind the pain
i know there was
a lot of pain
and how much it hurt
that was bad very bad
but not the worst part
the worst part was
waking up in the morning
and forgetting he was gone
did you do that
you forget
and then you remember
you remember and the world ends
all over again
but you still have
to get out of bed
and make the coffee
and the toast
cause the world
doesnt really end
it just seems that way
sometimes
the world is still there
it doesnt go away
its still waiting for you
its waiting for you too honey
thats all
okay
im going
ive thought this through
so many times
its the only way its
its the only way
do you love me
do you care what happens to me
i do
you know i do
we deserve this
yes
im looking for bart
its bart um
bromley
yes sorry
im his mother
hi
and who are you
andrea
im a friend of his
really
youre his friend
well i know him
from the hotel
he doesnt work there anymore
oh im sorry
yeah
i thought
i thought he was out sick
or something
no
thats what they told me
is he home
hi bart
im fine
ive missed you
yes
at the hotel
i was wondering where you were
yes
how are you
thats a
complicated question
yeah i know
yes
i have a broken heart
you do
yes its very painful
i bet
in a 1993 study
individuals who said
that they were in love
had their brains scanned
to show neural activity
the map showed vivid colors
over the gray matter
indicating clearly that this
romantic love phenomenon
activates a flood of dopamine
in the caudate nucleus
in exactly the same way
that cocaine and nicotine
affect the brain
meaning that love
is not an emotion
as is usually thought
rather its an addiction
when these chemicals
are released in our brains
we feel giddy and euphoric
so much to the point
that we can be so in love
that we dont have the desire
to eat or to sleep
so it feels good
when you have
the drug or the love
but when its taken away
you hurt
heartbreak
yes
im sorry
addiction is
a very dangerous thing
yeah i know
believe me
people die from it
people die from love
yeah
and then thats the end
they die and thats the end
bart
fuck this
bart im sorry
im very sorry
for everything
because youre a nice person
youre very special
