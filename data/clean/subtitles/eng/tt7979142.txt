easy piece of ass
that you meet in a hotel 
regularly  secretly 
a fuck buddy 
whatever they call it 
  is that what she is 
  shut up 
shut up

i ll call 911 
bart was a good
candidate for the job 
the company has
a policy of hiring 
well  whenever they can 
he s not mr  personality 
okay 
i mean  he has kind of
an odd way about him 
you know 
with people  but   
so how long
has he been here 
uh  two  three years 
almost three now 
any trouble 
no  no  he s very smart
and very capable 
thanks 
you re welcome 
i forgot my wallet 
excuse me 
i finished my shift 
it was 4 00 a m 
well  actually around 3 45 a m 
because jack was early 
my shift is eight to four 
jack is my relief 
but this morning he was early 
i don t really know why 
you d have to ask him about that
because i didn t ask him 
so i don t really know
the reason why he was early 
but he was 
and so i left 15 minutes
before my shift was over 
and i drove home by way
of reynolds boulevard
and arena drive 
and i took a right
on eighth avenue
and then a left
on jay street to number 433 
which is where i live 
bart  right  bart 
and i stopped and got
some ice cream on the way home 
and when i got there 
i ate the ice cream 
and i watched   
i watched   
i watched tv 
and i realized
i didn t have my wallet 
that i must have left it
here at the hotel 
so i had to come back
and get my wallet
because a wallet
is a very important thing
that you should never lose
or leave or forget 
  wow 
  yeah 
so i did 
so did you find it 
near the vending machines 
right where i left it 
such a terrible thing  huh 
this is a terrible thing 
  how old are you 
  23 
  do you have a girlfriend 
  no 
ever had a girlfriend 
no 
boyfriend 
no 
do you think about sex 
that is also
a very complicated question 
yeah  yeah 
yeah  i know  believe me 
and it could take me
a long time to answer it 
but in case you are inquiring
for your own personal reasons 
you should know that
i am not interested 
in what 
in any sexual activities
that involve older men like you 
got it  got it 
what about older women 
does that
get you going  huh 
okay so  um   
so you went home  and you
came back for the wallet 
that s the story 
yes 
well  your coworker says
that he never saw you leave 
  jack 
  yeah 
as a matter of fact 
he even said
your car was
still in the parking lot
before he heard the gunshot 
and that it s possible
that you never left 
i went home early 
around 3 45 a m  
and then i came back
through the side entrance 
but why  bart  why 
why not just come in
through the front door 
because the side entrance is
closer to the vending machines 
okay  okay  i buy that 
hey  bart  you know you got
blood on your hands  right 
yes  i was interested
in the blood  so i touched it 
her blood  the blood
is interesting to you 
yes 
look  i know you got issues 
yes  yes  i do 
i know you do  i know it 
and it s called   
asperger s  i m an aspie 
that s a psychological condition
that is normally
or abnormally characterized
by abnormalities of social
communication and interaction 
an aspie tends to
approach others awkwardly
and may engage in frequent
one sided long winded speeches 
such as this one 
about a specific topic 
while misunderstanding
and not recognizing
the listener s
feelings or reactions 
  hey  bart 
     thinks the person will stop talking 
bart  bart  please 
can you just take a breath 
  can you take a breath for me 
  and then   
bart  you re a very smart guy 
and yet what you re saying
to me doesn t make sense 
why not 
why not  because   
because why would you
leave your wallet
near the vending machine 
and if you didn t
have your wallet 
how did you pay
for the ice cream 
i m gonna need you to come
down and identify your wife 
look  i m sorry  i m sorry 
it s routine 
but  you know 
it s important 
maybe it s not her 
no  no  no  no  look 
i don t   
i don t wanna give you
any false hope 
it is her 
it s your wife 
okay 
and  uh   
and then i m gonna have
to ask you some questions 
that kid   
does he know something 
well  you know  it s   
she owned a gun 
karen owned a gun 
a handgun for protection 
the hell is she doing at a hotel
in the middle of the night 
the next time you speak with
him  it will be with a lawyer 
all right  you understand 
ma am  we just asked him
a few questions 
no  no  no 
you don t ask him anything 
you cannot keep him here 
and you cannot bother him
with questions
because this is a fragile boy 
and you need
to understand that
and respect that 
ma am  look 
we do understand that 
  but you need to   
  no  no  no  no buts 
you stay away from my boy 
honey 
you know you can
tell me anything  honey 
you can tell me
anything in the world 
and i will always
be on your side 
i love you 
okay  we re not in lov 
we could pretend
like i m just some   
easy piece of ass
that you meet in a hotel 
regularly  secretly 
a fuck buddy 
whatever they call it 
  is that what she is 
  shut up 
shut up 
  the rough stuff  huh 
  is that what you wan 
is that what she liked 
did she like it rough 
shut up

in those nondairy things 
vegetable fats replicate
the feel of milk fats 
other common ingredients

i have to practice 
i have to prepare
what to say  how to behave 
i watch people 
and i imitate 
  you watch people 
  yes 
well  i study them 
yeah  well  i guess you have
a lot of people to watch 
  at the hotel 
  yes 
because otherwise i just
feel like i don t belong 
yeah  i know what you mean 
he had it  you said
your brother  he had it 
what happened to him 
um   
he was institutionalized
for a long time 
i used to visit him 
and every time he would beg me
to get him out of there 
but we just couldn t 
and then he passed away 
yes  people die 
and that s the end 
so   
yeah 
okay  bye 
bye 
i sent her a text
from you  she isn t coming 
  she isn t 
  no 
told her you couldn t make it 
had to cancel like that 
so guess you ll have to
settle for me 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three  four 
one  two  three 
is this anything 
what does this mean 
that there was a camera
in the room 
look  i can t even tell
if it s her 
okay 
it s okay 
look  turn it off  please 
it s that kid 
it s that kid  isn t it 
possibly  you know 
he s very savvy
with this technological shit 
you know  and these kids 
these kids on the spectrum 
you know  they could also be
very violent 
what are you waiting for 
arrest him 
for what  for what 
for what  for spying 
come on  that s all i have 
and i barely have that 
well  he might have
seen something 
yeah  yeah  you know what 
he could have seen
everything 
but you know  that doesn t
mean he did anything  does it 
look  i don t wanna
cause him any trouble 
yeah  well  he s already
in a lot of trouble 
well  more trouble 
he s a nice enough guy 
little weird 
so  um  what did you see 
what i think i saw 
it looked like one of our rooms 
  from the hotel 
  yeah  on his ipad 
i thought it was a movie 
maybe some porn 
i don t know
how someone like that gets off 
but it seems like
porn would be the answer 
  and why would you say that 
  because it was creepy 
the way he was
just sitting there
when i found him in the room
that night 
  just sitting 
  right 
like he was waiting
for a bus 
it s fucking weird 
you know 
hi there 
hey 
i haven t seen you
for a while 
how are you 
well  that s a very
complicated question 
yeah  i bet it is 
anyway  it s good
to see you now 
nice to see you too 
oh  they did some work in
your room today on the a c unit 
so if anything has moved   
sure  okay 
you got a light 
excuse me 
a match 
cigarette  a light 
smoking s not permitted
on the premises 
yeah  i know that 
yeah  due largely to studies
that have shown
that when you have smoking
and nonsmoking rooms 
nicotine residues
and other chemical traces
end up in hallways
and other rooms 
including
nonsmoking rooms  so   
bart  i know that 
i m going outside
by the pool 
i just need a match 
oh 
i couldn t sleep 
that s too bad 
yeah  it happens
when i drink too much 
people drink too much 
yeah  they do 
yeah 
thanks 
i ll be outside
if you want some company 
this is a towel 
what are you doing 
you can t just   
turn around 
  goddamn 
  we don t have a lifeguard 
a what 
a lifeguard 
right  you don t have one 
no 
you should 
yes  in the water 
come 
come here  sit 
keep me company 
you scared the hell out of me 
i m sorry 
that s okay 
you were kissing a man
in that car 
yeah  well   
okay  you saw us 
yeah  who was that 
and why were you kissing him 
that s a very
complicated question 
oh 
i guess so 
you don t have someone 
a girlfriend   
like that 
no 
it s difficult  huh 
yes 
i bet 
and there s the problem
of being perceived as odd
or unsophisticated 
naive  clueless 
unfashionable 
or just plain stupid 
which you re not 
you re not stupid  are you 
no 
but that s the perception 
so it s very difficult
for people to know
what s going on
inside that head 
yes  that s correct 
well  i wanna know 
what is going on inside  bart 
oh  boy  oh  boy 
what did you do 
oh  boy  oh  boy 
oh  boy  oh  boy 
  bart  it s okay 
  bart  what did you do 
what did you do  bart 
bart  it s okay 
i m sorry 
was that wrong to do that
like that 
because if that was wrong
to do that like that 
i apologize 
and i ll never do anything
like that ever again 
bart  it s okay 
come here 
why don t you come here
and sit with me 
it s loneliness  bart 
loneliness
makes us do things 
he s married 
the man i was with 
he s a married man 
we ve been seeing each other
for a very long time 
secretly 
now   
things have got
confusing between us 
so i don t know 
before 
i knew what we were doing 
but now   
i have no idea
what you re trying to say 
neither do i 
 a nerkle  a nerd 
and a seersucker too  
a what 
nerd 
first documentation of the word 
1950  dr  seuss 
if i ran a zoo 
used to label persons as odd
or who are thought of
as sexually unattractive 
but more recently 
technological proficiency
is highly prized 
so the nerd
is often celebrated
as a technosexual
or even a sexy love god 
now i don t know
what you re trying to say 
oh  boy 
oh  boy  oh  boy 
are we talking about you 
yes 
and what are you
trying to say about you 
besides being
that you re a love god 
i could be your lifeguard 
yeah  maybe you could 
i don t know 
i ve never had one 
maybe you could 
bart 
i need to get some sleep

these are very close
to the picture 
and very well made 
nice fit 
would you wear those

you need to lose weight 
i m sorry

obesity is not just
a cosmetic problem 
it s a health hazard 
you can touch my hair 
but please just don t touch my skin 
my skin is mine 
also  you re at a very high risk
of heart disease 
diabetes  stroke 
high blood pressure 
cancer  gallstones 
osteoarthritis and gout 
it doesn t smell 
pictures don t smell 
why not 
because it s a picture 
i m not obese 
well  you are very 
very fat 
okay  bye 
wow 
hello  hamelton hotel 
how can i help you 
yes  andrea rivera 
107  please 
thank you 
okay  hold on 
hello 
hello 
who does that 
easy with that 
honey  i couldn t stop them 
they have a search warrant 
there was nothing i could do 
  hey  bart  how you doin  
  you don t have to talk to him 
quite the setup
you got here  my man 
  you don t have to say anything to him 
  well  hello 
he has no right to ask you
anything  do you understand 
mrs  bromley  i could either
talk to him here
or take him downtown 
  look  it s up to you 
  all right  talk  talk 
thank you 
so  bart  this is where
you spend your time  huh 
  yes 
  kind of dark 
you see  that s what you
don t understand  you see 
this is his way
of seeing the world 
  no  no  no 
  i m sorry  i m sorry 
i m sorry  i m sorry 
hey  bart  um 
your hard drive s empty 
yes  i wiped it 
they were on
your computer  honey 
there was nothing i could do 
and you wiped everything 
yes 
and you didn t think
of backing it up
or maybe putting it on
an external hard drive  maybe 
no 
well  see  bart 
i don t believe that 
i don t believe you 
well  that s too bad 
belief systems
can be very tricky 
yeah  they can be  bart 
but you re hiding something 
that s what
i really believe  bart 
so what are you hiding 
he s not hiding anything 
please 
bart  you get a lot of sympathy
for being like this 
don t you  huh 
you get a little free pass 
and what happens when
your mom s not around 
what happens when she s
not there to fix it for you 
how bad does it get when
you get that lonely  bart 
what happens when you
get that frustrated  bart 
  does it just explode  bart 
  all right  that s enough 
  stop it 
  please  mrs  bromley 
please sit down 
now  i m done fucking around
with you  bart 
you know why  because
we found your fingerprints
all over the room 
so what happened  bart 
what happened 
did she invite you up 
no 
well  maybe she was lonely 
maybe you were lonely 
maybe you went up 
maybe you thought
you could have sex with her
and maybe things got
a little frustrating for you 
maybe got a little out of hand 
maybe you hit her  bart 
and then what  hmm 
and then what happened 
well  bart  you tell me 
then i guess i just pulled
a gun from my pocket
because i always have
a gun in my pocket 
  and i shot her 
  bart 
but where did i get the gun 
that s what i
would like to know 
  bart 
  did i buy it 
did i steal it 
maybe i purchased it online 
and then when i went
to have sex with her 
i brought the gun
because  you know 
it s always a good idea
to take a gun
when you go to have sex
with someone because   
just in case you suffer
from impotence
or performance anxiety 
and you get frustrated 
and you can t do it 
then you have a gun
in your pocket 
and  by golly 
you just take it out
and shoot that person 
bang  bang 
and then the problem
is solved 
so where s
that gun now  bart 
that was a joke 
what s the matter with you 
he doesn t have a gun 
he was making a joke 
yeah  that was a good one  bart 
that was real good 
but you know what  ma am 
we have a dead woman here 
and i think bart knows
something about it 
that s why i m not laughing 
is he sick 
no  i don t think so 
i have jack
covering for him 
he s not answering his cell 
thank you for your concern 
really 
i m sure he s okay 
i m sure he s fine 
thanks 
bart 
bart  honey  are you down there 
bartholomew  i m coming down 
okay  here i come 
oh  honey 
there you are 
you didn t touch your supper 
aren t you hungry 
i m fine 
mr  benson called 
he was worried about you 
i worry too  bart 
i worry all the time 
life is hard  honey 
even for the best of us 
life is very hard 
when your father passed 
that was very hard 
i know it was hard for you 
it was hard for me too 
and never mind the pain 
i know there was
a lot of pain 
and how much it hurt 
that was bad  very bad 
but not the worst part 
the worst part was
waking up in the morning
and forgetting he was gone 
did you do that 
you forget 
and then you remember 
you remember  and the world ends
all over again 
but you still have
to get out of bed
and make the coffee
and the toast 
 cause the world
doesn t really end 
it just seems that way
sometimes 
the world is still there 
it doesn t go away 
it s still waiting for you 
it s waiting for you too  honey 
that s all 
okay 
i m going 
i ve thought this through
so many times 
it s the only way  it s   
it s the only way 
do you love me 
do you care what happens to me 
i do 
you know i do 
we deserve this 
yes 
i m looking for bart 
it s bart  um   
bromley 
yes  sorry 
i m his mother 
hi 
and who are you 
andrea 
i m a friend of his 
really 
you re his friend 
well  i know him
from the hotel 
he doesn t work there anymore 
oh  i m sorry 
yeah 
i thought   
i thought he was out sick
or something 
no 
that s what they told me 
is he home 
hi  bart 
i m fine 
i ve missed you 
yes 
at the hotel 
i was wondering where you were 
yes 
how are you 
that s a   
complicated question 
  yeah  i know 
  yes 
i have a broken heart 
you do 
yes  it s very painful 
i bet 
in a 1993 study 
individuals who said
that they were in love
had their brains scanned
to show neural activity 
the map showed vivid colors
over the gray matter 
indicating clearly that this
romantic love phenomenon
activates a flood of dopamine
in the caudate nucleus
in exactly the same way
that cocaine and nicotine
affect the brain 
meaning that love
is not an emotion 
as is usually thought 
rather  it s an addiction 
when these chemicals
are released in our brains 
we feel giddy and euphoric 
so much to the point
that we can be so in love
that we don t have the desire
to eat or to sleep 
so it feels good
when you have   
the drug or the love 
but when it s taken away 
you hurt 
heartbreak 
yes 
i m sorry 
addiction is
a very dangerous thing 
yeah  i know 
believe me 
people die from it 
people die from love 
yeah 
and then that s the end 
they die  and that s the end
