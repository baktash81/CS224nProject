girl there was a time
when children dreaded the night
for the sleeping hours
brought visions of horror
the dark times
when those terrible sea beasts
would ravage our shores
and no ship was safe on the sea
but thanks to the hunters
those days are over
today these valiant warriors
battle the beasts far beyond the horizon
risking their lives to rid the seas
of those nightmare creatures
and the greatest of the hunting ships
is the inevitable
and the greatest of the hunters
is captain crow

this ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other

villagers  captain crow is our hero
he keeps the oceans clear
he stabs and shoots
and kills and guts
the monsters that we fear
he stabs and shoots and executes
with cannon lance and spear
cuts off their horns
and no one mourns
the monsters that we fear
so sing the hunters praises
wherever men draw breath
for hunters live the greatest lives
and die the greatest deaths
laughter
crowd applauding
sighs
hmm
laughter and chatter
hello
hello
me names maisie
maisie brumble
well its a pleasure to meet you
and youre jacob holland
who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days
is it true you done that
four in two days
dont believe everything you hear lass
four in two days scoffs
it was five
i heard
tankards clatter
i heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore
pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch
and swallow her up
but not no more
and its cause of the hunters
theres not a nobler profession i says
i come from a long line of hunters meself
is that so
aye me parents were lancers
they served on the monarch
the monarch
so theyre
aye
thats just the way for a hunter
aint it
you live a great life
and die a great death
huh come on
so uh whos looking after you then
im staying at a childrens home
in guelston up the way
except i aint staying exactly
im on the run you see
and i aint going back
cause im joining your crew
splutters
chuckles oh no you aint
a hunting ship aint no place for a kid
you joined the ship when you were me age
and look at you now
youre a weapon
against natures darkest design
it says so on page 92
look kid im clever with a spear
but ive been lucky more than once
theres no guarantee
of making it to page 92
trust me
now you should run along
right then ill talk to captain crow
thats a man with real authority grunts
do you know
where i might find captain crow
hey i i have authority
all right
you aint captain are ya
uh no but i am captain material
laughs captain material
clears throat
sorry it just sounds funny
i mean i will be captain
someday
well i intend to get on that ship
so if you dont mind
ill take it up with captain now
not captain someday
hey put me down let me go
monster hunters are supposed to be heroes
jacob and heres me saving you
evening rosie you go through guelston
aye
right let her out there and not before
if thats not too much trouble
aye
hey grunts
this is kidnapping
jacob no love its the opposite
of kidnapping whistles
dramatic music playing
jacob sighs
new friend jacob
ah just some kid
urgh horrible things children
jacob you can say that again
clanging
groans
regal music playing
man captain crow
child its full of brickleback
regal music continues
well if it isnt captain crow
and his loyal mates
your grace as you can see
the oceans have offered abundant prey
and i see youve taken
a fullgrown brickleback
a specimen like that
garners quite a bounty
but theres something i dont see
the horn of the red bluster
admiral hornagold has reported a rumor
all admiral hornagold
that you spotted the red bluster
but abandoned your pursuit
because of a certain code
the royals dont pay you
to honor such codes
they pay you to kill monsters
how many more ships will be lost
because you let the bluster slip away
king this was once a small kingdom
with a big idea
to send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores
and usher in a new era of peace
its been hundreds of years
since the dark times
but as long as the bluster lives
people will still
look to the seas with fear
so today marks the beginning of a new era
the crown will no longer
support the hunters
shes quite a sight isnt she
the imperator is the most
heavilyarmed ship ever to set sail
the royal navy will push
deep into the unknown world
and eradicate every sea beast in our path
not in that thing
she rests too low
and them fixed cannons is useless
and her captain is an ass
gasps its time
for you to leave captain
your time is up
admiral have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasnt hanging from a ceiling
dont send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that
its not built for hunting
and neither are you
i assure you
i am not afraid of those beasts
then youre a fool
and youll take
a lot of good sailors down with you
general see the hunters out
were done with them
we hunters have shed blood
while you lot hid behind walls
and drew lines on maps
youre cowards the lot of ya
general the captain
is to be placed under arrest
and the inevitable decommissioned
wwwait wait
uh your grace chuckles nervously
the uh the captain
is wellknown for his temper
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well
hes opened the seas
and made your empire
the envy of the known world
now i believe the world
still needs the hunters
so prove me wrong
give us one more try for the bluster
if we take it you keep your promise
and we continue our alliance
if the imperator takes the bluster
well you can tear down
the inevitable for scrap
and the days of the hunters will be over
either way
you win
i for one would relish the opportunity
then we have a contest
get set
go
well take the bluster
and bring it to your doorstep
the days of hunters are not over
not nearly
dramatic music playing
when we reach the dregmorr
well follow the trenches
we stay battleready clear decks
sharpened flints and fresh cartridge
the blusters hide will be plenty thick
best to use the long spears
indistinct shouting
sarah them archers wont do any good
but weve got plenty of carcass shot
captain crow well hit it with fire
then go for a sleigh ride
thats the way with something like this
jacob were ready captain
well take that red demon
for we are hunters
and we will bring all of our skill
and all of our rage down upon this beast
and there will be justice
cheering
but that will not be the end
of this great ship
for no one has sailed
beyond the dregmorr sea
no one knows what dangers lurk
in that terrible unknown
but it will be this ship
under jacob holland
that will pierce the darkness
cheering
so lets drink to a successful hunt
with many more to come
cheering and shouting
maisie ow
sailor 1 what was that
sailor 2 it came from the keg
sailor 3 what was that
jacob inhales and grunts
chuckles
you stowed away
i stowed away
sighs you stowed away
uh i
yeah
well were dropping you off
at the nearest port
were going after the bluster
we cant have a kid mucking about
captain crow whats this
the names maisie brumble
but you need no introduction
youve been swallowed whole
shot through the heart and cut to pieces
but the worms wont eat you
and hell wont take you so here you are
the right proud commander
of the secondgreatest hunting ship
what ever sailed
secondgreatest
which then may i ask is the greatest
im partial to the monarch
for its the ship me parents served on
i see
then they died heroes didnt they
aye

what if them things
aint as bad as they say
i mean the sea is their home
we went after her didnt we
what if we just left em alone
we kill them because they kill us
do i need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents
should they have just left
the monsters alone
i dont know
oh you are lost girl
your parents died heroes
i want to believe that
but maybe you can be a hero
and still be wrong
youre not making
growling
youre not making any sense
why did red swallow us
oh red is it
she not it
i think its a she and i think
she was protecting us from crow
youre giving that beast
way too much credit
he was pointing a gun at you and he
he was pointing it at you through me
because you cut them lines
i dont wanna argue about it all right
cause i dont want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters
on this island
that that i wouldnt be on
if you hadnt cut them lines
so were not arguing
so what are we doing
im going to gather supplies
ill take you to guelston

to make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunters code
blast whatever code

theyve bit him through
and drowned him too
and killed him 50 times
theyve killed him 50 times or more
and still the man fights on
and beasts expire in blood and fire
until the last is gone
so sing the hunters praises
