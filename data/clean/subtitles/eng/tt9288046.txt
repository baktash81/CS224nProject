 girl   there was a time
when children dreaded the night 
for the sleeping hours
brought visions of horror  
 the dark times
when those terrible sea beasts
would ravage our shores 
and no ship was safe on the sea  
 but thanks to the hunters 
those days are over  
 today  these valiant warriors
battle the beasts far beyond the horizon 
risking their lives to rid the seas
of those nightmare creatures  
 and the greatest of the hunting ships
is the inevitable    
 and the greatest of the hunters
is captain crow

they say the bluster moves the very sea 
aye  and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes  they say 
it s enough to make your knees wobble 
but i ain t afraid 
 cause i m on the inevitable with you lot 
this ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other 
and she s got the scars to prove it 
as do we  jacob   laughs

and every hunter s scar is a life saved 
a merchant sailor on their first voyage 
a mother 
a son 
all hunters die of the same thing

but saving jim nicklebones
was the right thing to do 
you steered me right today 
well  i m    i i m glad you see it that way 
so we ll go home 
collect our bounty  and repair the ship 
and we ll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it 
 sighs 
and then what 
what is to become of the inevitable
after i m gone 
 sighs 
through battle and wear 
every beam  block 
and spar has been replaced
since the day she was launched 
yet she lives on 
it s an eternal thing 
but i am not 
 door creaks 
come 
here is my greatness 
my father s before me 
and his father s before him 
on the day we take the red bluster 
i will make me last entry as captain 
then it ll be your time 
i ve known it since the day
i pulled you from the sea 
 soft music playing 
you d been out there for days 
but there was something in you  jacob 
a fire that wouldn t die 
then i held you 
and i knew 
the fates had brought me a son 
and that one day 
you would be captain of the inevitable 
the day you found me 
i swore i would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons 
if you would grant me this ship 
i would accept 
and it would be my honor 
 chuckles

captain crow will visit
the king and queen at first light 
and when the ship is ready 
we ll be off to kill a monster 
   crowd cheers 
  we re going after the red bluster 
so if this be our last visit
to three bridges 
i expect some right  proper debauchery 
 crowd cheers 
 sarah  go on  then 
make way for the hunters

the crown will pay well for them horns 
  so the drinks are on us 
   crowd cheers 
no one goes thirsty tonight  swabbies 
 sailor  come on  then 
 jaunty music playing 
 villagers    captain crow is our hero
he keeps the oceans clear  
  he stabs  and shoots
and kills  and guts  
  the monsters that we fear  
  he stabs  and shoots  and executes  
  with cannon  lance  and spear  
  cuts off their horns  
  and no one mourns
the monsters that we fear  
  so sing the hunters  praises
wherever men draw breath  
  for hunters live the greatest lives
and die the greatest deaths   
   laughter 
   crowd applauding 
 sighs 
hmm 
 laughter and chatter 
hello 
hello 
me name s maisie 
maisie brumble 
well  it s a pleasure to meet you 
and you re jacob holland 
who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days 
is it true you done that 
four in two days 
don t believe everything you hear  lass 
four in two days   scoffs 
it was five 
i heard   
 tankards clatter 
i heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore 
pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch 
and swallow her up 
but not no more 
and it s  cause of the hunters 
there s not a nobler profession  i says 
i come from a long line of hunters meself 
is that so 
aye  me parents were lancers 
they served on the monarch 
the monarch 
  so they re   
  aye 
that s just the way for a hunter 
ain t it 
you live a great life
and die a great death 
huh  come on 
so  uh  who s looking after you then 
i m staying at a children s home
in guelston  up the way 
except i ain t staying exactly 
i m on the run  you see 
and i ain t going back 
 cause i m joining your crew 
 splutters 
 chuckles  oh  no  you ain t 
a hunting ship ain t no place for a kid 
you joined the ship when you were me age 
and look at you now 
you re a weapon
against nature s darkest design 
it says so on page 92 
look  kid  i m clever with a spear 
but i ve been lucky more than once 
there s no guarantee
of making it to page 92 
trust me 
now  you should run along 
right  then  i ll talk to captain crow 
that s a man with real authority   grunts 
do you know
where i might find captain crow 
hey  i    i have authority 
  all right 
  you ain t captain  are ya 
uh  no  but i am captain material 
 laughs   captain material  
 clears throat 
  sorry  it just sounds funny 
  i mean  i will be captain 
  someday 
  well  i intend to get on that ship 
so  if you don t mind 
i ll take it up with captain now 
not captain someday 
hey  put me down  let me go 
monster hunters are supposed to be heroes 
 jacob  and here s me saving you 
evening  rosie  you go through guelston 
aye 
right  let her out there and not before 
  if that s not too much trouble 
  aye 
hey   grunts 
this is kidnapping 
 jacob  no  love  it s the opposite
of kidnapping   whistles 
 dramatic music playing 
   jacob sighs 
  new friend  jacob 
ah  just some kid 
urgh  horrible things  children 
 jacob  you can say that again 
 clanging 
 groans 
 regal music playing 
 man  captain crow 
 child  it s full of brickleback 
 regal music continues 
well  if it isn t captain crow
and his loyal mates 
your grace  as you can see 
the oceans have offered abundant prey 
and i see you ve taken
a full grown brickleback 
a specimen like that
garners quite a bounty 
but there s something i don t see 
the horn of the red bluster 
admiral hornagold has reported a rumor   
 all  admiral hornagold 
   that you spotted the red bluster 
but abandoned your pursuit
because of a certain code 
the royals don t pay you
to honor such codes 
they pay you to kill monsters 
how many more ships will be lost
because you let the bluster slip away 
 king  this was once a small kingdom
with a big idea 
to send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores
and usher in a new era of peace 
it s been hundreds of years
since the dark times 
but as long as the bluster lives 
people will still
look to the seas with fear 
so today marks the beginning of a new era 
the crown will no longer
support the hunters 
she s quite a sight  isn t she 
the imperator is the most
heavily armed ship ever to set sail 
the royal navy will push
deep into the unknown world
and eradicate every sea beast in our path 
not in that thing 
she rests too low 
and them fixed cannons is useless 
and her captain is an ass 
 gasps  it s time
for you to leave  captain 
your time is up 
admiral  have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn t hanging from a ceiling 
don t send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that 
it s not built for hunting 
and neither are you 
i assure you 
i am not afraid of those beasts 
then you re a fool 
and you ll take
a lot of good sailors down with you 
general  see the hunters out 
we re done with them 
we hunters have shed blood 
while you lot hid behind walls
and drew lines on maps 
you re cowards  the lot of ya 
general  the captain
is to be placed under arrest 
and the inevitable decommissioned 
w w wait  wait 
uh  your grace   chuckles nervously 
the  uh    the captain
is well known for his temper 
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well 
he s opened the seas
and made your empire
the envy of the known world 
now  i believe the world
still needs the hunters 
so prove me wrong 
give us one more try for the bluster 
if we take it  you keep your promise 
and we continue our alliance 
if the imperator takes the bluster 
well  you can tear down
the inevitable for scrap 
and the days of the hunters will be over 
either way 
you win 
i  for one  would relish the opportunity 
then we have a contest 
get set 
go 
we ll take the bluster
and bring it to your doorstep 
the days of hunters are not over 
not nearly 
 dramatic music playing 
when we reach the dregmorr 
we ll follow the trenches 
we stay battle ready  clear decks 
sharpened flints  and fresh cartridge 
the bluster s hide will be plenty thick 
  best to use the long spears 
   indistinct shouting 
 sarah  them archers won t do any good 
but we ve got plenty of carcass shot 
 captain crow  we ll hit it with fire 
then go for a sleigh ride 
that s the way with something like this 
 jacob  we re ready  captain 
we ll take that red demon 
for we are hunters 
and we will bring all of our skill
and all of our rage down upon this beast 
and there will be justice 
 cheering 
but that will not be the end
of this great ship 
for no one has sailed
beyond the dregmorr sea 
no one knows what dangers lurk
in that terrible unknown 
but it will be this ship 
under jacob holland 
that will pierce the darkness 
 cheering 
so let s drink to a successful hunt 
with many more to come 
 cheering and shouting 
   maisie  ow 
   sailor 1  what was that 
   sailor 2  it came from the keg 
   sailor 3  what was that

 sighs  you stowed away 
uh  i

at the nearest port 
we re going after the bluster 
  we can t have a kid mucking about 
   captain crow  what s this 
the name s maisie brumble 
but you need no introduction 
you ve been swallowed whole 
shot through the heart  and cut to pieces 
but the worms won t eat you 
and hell won t take you  so here you are 
the right  proud commander
of the second greatest hunting ship
what ever sailed 
second greatest 
which then  may i ask  is the greatest 
i m partial to the monarch 
for it s the ship me parents served on 
i see 
then they died heroes  didn t they 
aye 
i like this kid 
  she s all vinegar 
  but  c captain

me book says the beasts
used to come right up to shore 
that nowhere was safe 
is that true 
of course it s true 
you saw it 
it was before my time 
but everyone knows it s true 
what if them things
ain t as bad as they say 
i mean  the sea is their home 
we went after her  didn t we 
what if we just left  em alone 
we kill them because they kill us 
do i need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents 
should they have just left
the monsters alone 
i    don t know 
oh  you are lost  girl 
your parents died heroes

she was protecting us from crow 
you re giving that beast
way too much credit 
  he was pointing a gun at you  and he   
  he was pointing it at you  through me 
because you cut them lines 
i don t wanna argue about it  all right 
 cause i don t want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters
on this island 
that  that i wouldn t be on
if you hadn t cut them lines 
so we re not arguing 
so what are we doing 
i m going to gather supplies

that hurt  didn t it 
you have no idea 
 soft music continues 
 soft music fades 
 tranquil music playing 
 maisie  two lives were saved that day 
one man and one beast 
and with that  the world began to change 
no ship would ever sail
the dregmorr again 
and the mysteries beyond
would remain undisturbed 
 tranquil music continues 
 blue croaks 
 maisie  i don t think
about it much though 
red is safe 
and i have everything i need right here 
 tranquil music continues 
 music fades 
i m going to live a great life 
 jaunty sea shanty playing 
 villagers    captain crow is our hero
he keeps the oceans clear  
  he stabs  and shoots  and kills
and guts the monsters that we fear  
  he stabs  and shoots  and executes
with cannon  lance  and spear  
  cuts off their horns  and no one mourns
the monsters that we fear  
  so sing the hunters  praises
wherever men draw breath  
  for hunters live the greatest lives
and die the greatest deaths   
 instrumental sea shanty continues 
 instrumental sea shanty continues 
  so raise a glass to the sky
to crow and his missing eye  
  we ll raise a glass to the sky
and we ll drink before we die  
  captain crow  he fears no foe  
  he hunts them for their crimes  
  they ve bit him through
and drowned him too  
  and killed him 50 times  
  they ve killed him 50 times or more
and still the man fights on  
  and beasts expire in blood and fire
until the last is gone  
  so sing the hunters  praises
wherever men draw breath  
  for hunters live the greatest lives  
  and die the greatest deaths   
 instrumental sea shanty continues 
 sea shanty ends 
 adventurous music playing 
 adventurous music continues 
 tense music playing 
 tense music intensifies 
 tense music continues 
 dramatic music swells 
 dramatic music fades 
 tranquil music playing 
 dramatic music playing 
 dramatic music continues 
 dramatic music crescendos 
 adventurous music playing
