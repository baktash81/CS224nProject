has always been a deep
inscrutable mystery to me 
my principle anguish and source
of all my joys and sorrows
from my youth onward
has been the incessant 
merciless battle between
the spirit and the flesh   
and my soul is the arena
where these two armies
have clashed and met  
nikos kazantzakis
from the book
 the last temptation of christ 
this film is not based upon the gospels
but upon this fictional exploration
of the eternal spiritual conflict 
the last temptation of christ
the feeling begins 
very tender  very loving 
then the pain starts 
claws slip underneath the skin
and tear their way up   
   just before they reach my eyes 
they dig in 
and i remember 
first i fasted for three months 
i even whipped myself
before i went to sleep 
at first it worked 
then the pain came back  and the voices 
they call me by name 
jesus 
who is it  who are you 
why are you following me 
are you ready 
no more crosses  we re ready 
where is your mind 
do you hear what i m saying 
the messiah won t come that way 
what do you mean by that 
who told you 
you re a disgrace 
romans can t find anyone to make crosses 
except for you  you do it 
you re worse than them 
you re a jew killing jews 
you re a coward 
how will you ever pay for your sins 
with my life  judas 
i don t have anything else 
don t turn away  look at me 
with your life  what do you mean 
please  judas 
i don t know 
are you still taking the cross 
 yes  i am 
 no  you re not 
i won t let you 
 i won t let you 
 please  i beg you  don t get in the way 
what way 
 what s happened to you 
 i m struggling 
 with who 
 i don t know  i m struggling 
i struggle  you collaborate 
traitor 
you are the people of lsrael 
your children are watching 
you are the people of god 
he is judging us  he is watching you 
 there he is 
 kill him 
don t touch him  get away from him 
 don t you defend him 
 he s my son 
god is with us  he s judging us  fight 
god help us 
god give us strength 
come  come with me 
 this man  naked before you now 
is condemned for sedition   
    for lifting his hand against rome 
seditio
 he rallied the people to revolution 
 he promised that a messiah
would come from among the people   
    to rise up and destroy rome  
rome is nothing 
 murder   
    betrayal   
    looting and so on  and so therefore 
he is condemned to die 
 rome condemns him 
 and all the gods of rome condemn him  
god is our shield 
he is our shield 
he is our heart  he is our heart 
he is our shield  he is our shield 
he will not abandon you 
he will not abandon you 
god 
god loves me  i know he loves me 
i want him to stop  i can t take the pain 
the voices and the pain 
i want him to hate me  i fight him 
i make crosses so he ll hate me 
i want him to find somebody else 
i want to crucify every one of his messiahs 
you re sure it s god 
you re sure it s not the devil 
i m not sure 
 i m not sure of anything 
 if it s the devil  the devil can be cast out 
but what if it s god 
you can t cast out god  can you 
who s that  who s following me 
ls that you 
magdalene 
magdalene 
thank you  lord   
   for bringing me
where i did not want to go 
he must be one of god s angels 
he came down to show me the way 
who s out there 
who is it 
what are you doing here 
i want you to forgive me 
i ve done too many bad things 
i m going to the desert 
and i need you to forgive me   
   before i go  please 
i see 
you sit out there all day with the others   
   and then come in here with
your head down  saying   forgive me  
 forgive me  
it s not that easy 
just because you need forgiveness 
don t ask me to do it 
 i m sorry
 get out  go away 
look  mary   
   look at this 
god can change this 
god can save your soul 
he already broke my heart 
he took you away from me 
and i hate both of you 
hate me  blame me 
it s all my fault  but not god s 
 don t say that about god 
 who made me feel this way about god 
i know  that s why i m here 
it s why i want you to forgive me 
i ll pay my debt 
i know   
   there are some things i ve done 
and to you 
pay or go away 
don t you remember 
no  i don t remember  why should l 
nothing s changed 
say the truth 
if you want to save my soul   
   this is where you ll find it 
you know that 
you re the same as all the others 
only you can t admit it 
you re pitiful 
i hate you 
here s my body 
save it 
save it 
is that the way you show you re a man 
turn away  don t look at me 
you never had the courage to be a man 
don t look at me 
if you weren t hanging on to your mother 
you were hanging on to me 
now you re hanging on to god   
   going to the desert to hide
because you re scared 
go  whenever i see you  my heart breaks 
i do remember when we were children 
never have i felt so much tenderness
toward anyone   
   as i felt toward you then 
all i ever wanted was you 
nothing else 
what do you think i wanted 
please 
stay 
is it so bad sharing a prostitute s room 
i won t touch you 
you ll still be a virgin for the desert 
mary  i m sorry  i can t stay 
welcome  this way 
do you always pray this late at night 
it s a funeral 
the master of the monastery died 
shall i pray with you 
sleep  you must be tired 
i know who you are 
that was the man
who brought me here last night 
last night 
he was dead last night 
the master s soul has gone to heaven 
his body s work is completed 
it walked under the sun and the moon   
   over sand and stone   
   sinned  felt pain   
   yearned for heaven 
we commend his remains to our god 
flesh   
   the master no longer needs you 
melt away 
first came the wings  then the angel 
his spirit actually appeared to you 
he treated you like a royal visitor 
he recognized you for something 
he couldn t have recognized me
for anything 
i only came here to serve god  that s all 
that s all god wants from me 
i m sure of it 
think of how you re blessed 
god actually makes himself known to you 
i don t know what god wants from me 
all my life i ve wanted to hear god s voice 
i ve dedicated my life to him 
sometimes   
   l think i feel him 
but i m never really sure 
but you always know  god took you
by the hand and brought you here 
you think it s a blessing
to know what god wants 
i ll tell you what he wants 
he wants to push me over 
can t he see what s inside of me 
all my sins 
 we all sin 
 not my sins 
i m a liar  a hypocrite 
i m afraid of everything  i don t tell
the truth  i don t have the courage 
when i see a woman 
i blush and look away 
i want her  but i don t take her  for god 
and that makes me proud 
then my pride ruins magdalene 
i don t steal  i don t fight   
   l don t kill  not because i don t want to 
but because i m afraid 
i want to rebel against you 
against everything   
   against god  but   
   l m afraid 
you want to know
who my mother and father are 
you want to know who my god is 
fear 
you look inside me
and that s all you ll find 
but the more devils we have inside of us 
the more of a chance we have to repent 
lucifer is inside me 
he says to me 
 you re not the son of king david 
 you re not a man  you re the son of man 
 and more  the son of god 
and more than that  god  
do you want to ask me anything else 
everything is from god 
everything has two meanings 
jesus  my sweet jesus 
i forgive you 
leave me 
they ve gone 
you have to leave  too 
 no  i have to stay 
 no 
you ve been purified 
god has just blessed you 
the snakes came from inside you 
now you have to leave  too 
you have to go back   
   and speak to people
and share your heart 
speak to who 
to anyone who will listen 
and say what 
just open your mouth 
do you love mankind 
i see men and i feel sorry for them 
that s all 
that s enough 
 i ve got orders to kill you 
 go ahead 
tonight i was purified  i can t fight
with god anymore  here s my neck 
cut it  i m ready 
what are you 
what kind of a man are you 
what you want  i want 
that s why he brought us together 
it s god s plan 
i come to kill you and you help me 
that s god s plan 
these voices you hear  it s god s voice 
only you understand it 
you d better make me understand it  too 
i ll tell you as much as i know 
the fainting spells  the voices  the visions 
power  magic 
is there some secret 
tell me your secret 
pity 
pity for who  yourself  
pity for men 
our enemies are men 
i feel pity for everything 
donkeys   
    grass  sparrows 
 and ants  you feel pity for them  too 
yes 
everything s a part of god 
when i see an ant 
when i look at his shiny black eye   
   you know what i see 
i see the face of god 
you re not afraid of dying 
why should i be 
death isn t a door that closes  it opens 
it opens and you go through it 
if i don t kill you  what happens 
i ll speak to people 
what are you going to say 
i ll just open my mouth
and god will do the talking 
maybe god didn t send you here to kill me 
maybe he sent you here to follow me 
just so there s no mistake 
i ll go with you until i understand 
but if you stray this much   
   from the path  i ll kill you 
it s magdalene 
she deserves it 
get out of there  get out of the way 
this is not your business 
do you want to get hurt 
 did you hear what he said  idiot  move 
 no 
i don t want this 
listen to him  he doesn t want this 
well  we want it 
 why 
 we don t have to tell you why 
i ve had enough  we live in a whorehouse 
she s a jew  she works on the sabbath 
she goes with romans on the sabbath 
she broke moses  law  she dies 
who has never sinned  who 
which one of you people has never sinned 
whoever that is  come up here 
and throw these 
i have nothing to hide 
good  take this  it s bigger 
be careful  zebedee 
there is a god 
he s seen you cheat your workers 
he s seen you with that widow 
what s her name 
judith 
judith 
aren t you afraid god will paralyze you
if you lift that stone 
that your arm will wither 
that you ll lose all strength 
god has so many miracles 
what ifl say the wrong thing 
what ifl say the right thing 
come closer 
come closer  we re all a family 
come closer  so you can hear 
i have something to tell you 
who is he 
it s jesus from nazareth 
nothing good can come out of nazareth 
even the scriptures say so 
i m sorry  but   
   the easiest way to make myself clear   
   is to tell you a story 
a farmer was planting in his field 
some seed fell on the ground
and the birds ate it 
some seed fell on rocks and dried up 
but some seed    
some seed fell on rich soil   
   and grew into enough wheat
to feed a whole nation 
can you hear me 
we can hear you fine 
i m the farmer  the farmer is me 
and 2 and 2 makes 4 
another lunatic 
rabbi   
   tell me  if you re the farmer   
   and we re the stones  what s the seed 
what s the seed 
love 
love one another 
that s easy to say  maybe that s
good advice  but for some other world 
these people are starving 
first you feed them  then you talk 
i used to think god was angry  too 
but not anymore 
he used to jump on me like a wild bird
and dig his claws into my head 
but then one morning  he came to me 
he blew over me like a cool breeze
and said   stand up  
and here i am 
and you will go to hell 
these are children s stories 
how can they help us 
what are you hungry for 
what are you thirsty for  for justice 
 and bread 
 bread  too 
you re thirsty for justice 
for people to treat you fairly   
   for people to treat you with respect 
what i m telling you is   
   whoever s hungry for justice 
they are the ones who ll be blessed 
they ll be filled with bread 
they ll never be hungry again 
they ll have the real value 
the value of love 
to love  share and comfort 
they ll have the courage to do the good 
and you  you re mourning 
mourners will be blessed 
you ll have god to comfort you 
you won t need men to do it 
and the meek 
they re the ones who ll be blessed 
and the suffering  they ll be blessed  too 
and the peacemakers and the merciful   
   and the sick  and the poor 
and the outcasts   
   you ll all be blessed
because heaven is yours 
and believe me   
   believe me 
those who are laughing now   
   will be crying later 
those whose stomachs are filled now
will be hungry later 
and the rich will be poor forever 
kill them 
i didn t say death 
i said love 
i said love 
enough  come 
no  father  i m staying 
we have to work  i need you 
 come 
 i m sorry  father  i m staying  too 
not the two of you  come on 
let me come with you  i can help 
stay here 
you ll know when 
tell people about me 
james 
andrew 
move over  john 
move over  james 
i was just comfortable 
 peter wants to lay down 
 peter  there s no more room 
i m cold  i want to be by the fire 
go over by philip  we re all cold 
shut up 
rabbi  can i talk to you 
i m not like these other men 
i mean  they re good enough 
they re good men  but they re weak 
one s worse than the other 
where d you find them 
look at me 
if i love somebody  i would die for them 
if i hate somebody  i d kill them 
i could even kill somebody i loved
if they did the wrong thing 
did you hear me 
do you understand what i said 
yes  i understand 
the other day you said  if a man hit you 
you d turn the other cheek 
i didn t like that 
only an angel could do that  or a dog 
i m sorry but i m neither 
i m a free man 
i don t turn my cheek to anyone 
we both want the same thing 
we do 
 do you want freedom for lsrael 
 no 
i want freedom for the soul 
no  that s what i can t accept 
that s not the same thing 
first you free the body  then the spirit 
the romans come first 
you don t build a house from the roof down
but from the foundation up 
 the foundation is the soul 
 the foundation is the body 
that s where you must begin 
if you don t change the spirit first 
change what s inside   
   then you ll only replace the romans
with someone else  and nothing changes 
even if you re victorious 
you ll still be filled with the poison 
you ve got to break the chain of evil 
how do you change then 
with love 
 who s there 
 it s me  andrew 
is everything    
it s all right  go back to sleep 
judas and i are talking 
there s an example 
you know  the zealots
ordered me to kill you 
why did you change your mind 
i decided to wait 
for what 
i thought maybe you were the one 
to unite us  i didn t want to destroy that 
how do we know 
how could i be the messiah 
when those people were torturing
magdalene  i wanted to kill them 
and then i opened my mouth   
   and out comes the word  iove  
why  i don t understand 
i can t look to the others for answers 
all they do is follow you 
we ll go to judea and see john the baptist 
every day he tells hundreds of people
the messiah is coming  he ll know 
he ll know 
i m afraid 
stay with me 
behold 
i will raise up evil against you
out of your own house   
   and i will take your wives 
before your eyes   
   and give them to your neighbor 
and he shall lie with your wives   
   in the sight of this sun 
you may listen and listen again   
   but you will never understand 
you may look  but you will never know 
these people s wits are dulled 
their ears are deafened
and their eyes blinded   
   so they cannot see with their eyes 
nor hear with their ears   
   so that they may turn and be healed 
the lord of hosts says   on this day    
he sounds like the messiah 
no 
    l will crush the horns of the new moon
and i will spill darkness over the world 
 i will reverse your laughter 
turn it into tears     
go in front  let him see you 
 listen  it is the thunder
of many peoples     
even from behind 
i knew i had seen him before 
where 
was it a dream 
yes  it was 
but in the dream  he was dressed in white 
 you will have the smell of decay   
    and branding  instead of beauty 
your men shall fall by the sword   
    and your women
shall sit on the ground  stripped bare  
who are you 
do you recognize me 
who are you 
do you know the prophets 
what does lsaiah say 
he says   prepare the way of the lord  
 are you telling me that s you 
 i don t know  tell me 
why are you here 
to be baptized 
no  i don t dare 
if you re the master 
then you have to baptize me 
baptize me 
love  what does it mean 
love is sweet as honey 
but it s also blood 
love is action 
you want a new crop  you burn the earth 
but isn t love enough 
no  look at the world  look around you 
plague  war  corruption   
   false prophets  false idols 
worship of gold 
nothing is of value 
the tree is rotten 
you have to take the axe and cut it down 
if i was a woodcutter  i d cut 
if i was a fire  i d burn 
but i m a heart and i love
and that s all i can do 
i m a heart  also 
but i can t love what s unjust 
what i can t love  i attack 
god demands it 
 anger 
 yes  god demands anger 
anger  but we re all brothers 
you think love is god s only way 
go to the dead sea  look in the bottom 
you ll see two whores 
sodom and gomorrah 
that s god s way 
on the day of the lord   
   blood will flow from wood 
the stones of the houses will come alive
and kill their owners 
that day is here 
he gave me the axe  now i give it to you 
that s not the answer 
then what is the answer 
i don t know 
well  if you won t listen to me 
who will you listen to 
god 
the god of lsrael is the god of the desert 
if you want to speak to him 
then you ll have to go to the desert 
i ll go to ldumaea 
thank you  baptist 
be careful  god isn t alone out there 
i feel sorry for you 
you were lonely 
you cried  so i came 
i didn t call for you 
who are you 
your spirit 
my spirit 
you re afraid ofbeing alone 
you re just like adam 
he called me and i took one of his ribs   
   and made it into a woman 
you re here to trick me 
trick you 
to love and care for a woman 
to have a family  is this a trick 
why are you trying to save the world 
aren t your own sins enough for you 
what arrogance
to think you can save the world 
the world doesn t have to be saved 
save yourself 
find love 
i have love 
look   
   in my eyes 
look at my breasts 
do you recognize them 
just nod your head   
   and we ll be in my bed together 
jesus 
after ten days   
   the hunger went away 
welcome  jesus  congratulations 
you re past the small temptations
of a woman and a family 
we re both bigger than that 
 who are you 
 you don t recognize me 
i m you  i m your heart 
your heart is so greedy 
it pretends to be humble   
   but it really wants to conquer the world 
i never wanted a kingdom on earth 
 the kingdom of heaven is enough 
 you re a liar 
when you were making crosses
for the romans   
   your head was exploding
with dreams ofpower 
power over everyone 
you said it was god 
but you really wanted power 
now you can have what you want 
any country you want 
all of them 
 you could even have rome 
 liar 
step into my circle
so i can pull your tongue out 
archangel  move back 
move back  you re blinding me 
jesus 
i m the one you ve been waiting for 
remember   
   when you were a little boy   
   you cried 
 make me a god  god 
 god 
 god  make me a god   
but i was just a child then 
you are god 
the baptist knew it 
now it s time you admit it 
you are his son 
the only son of god 
join me 
together we ll rule the living and the dead 
you ll give life and you ll take life 
you ll sit in judgement 
and i ll sit next to you 
imagine how strong we d be together 
satan 
we ll see each other again 
don t be afraid  you are the one 
my work is done 
now i can die 
the lord wants me to tell you to stand up 
his day is here 
take this axe 
take this message to everyone 
please 
what do you want 
i m a foreigner 
from galilee 
i m tired 
you don t know how good this tastes 
some more wine  please 
mary   
   martha   
   l want to say that you re both blessed 
i came here  you didn t know me 
you took me in  fed me  restored me   
   and god came down
and went into my heart 
 go on 
 no 
i ve talked too much already 
silence is better 
no  it s not 
do you have a wife 
no 
how can you live like that in the desert 
tell me the truth 
don t you miss all this 
having a home  a real life 
i admit it 
i d like it  but i ll never have it 
listen  if you really want god 
don t spend your time in the desert 
he s not there  he s right here 
read your scriptures 
god does not want you to fast and pray 
he wants you to make children 
mary  you re making him uncomfortable 
he s a guest 
he knows what i m talking about 
come and help me 
it s not right to tease these men 
i wasn t teasing 
remember the baptist 
it s nothing to tease about 
 the baptist  what 
 he s dead  he was killed by herod 
you didn t know 
they say the king was drunk and cut off
the baptist s head to satisfy him 
now they say they re going to kill everyone
who was baptized 
no one forced you to be baptized 
you were baptized  too 
you begged for it  so be quiet 
i can just imagine in galilee right now 
the sea 
they say the fishing s so good you just
touch the nets and the fish jump in 
don t talk about fish 
it reminds me of my sheep 
i don t know what s happened to them 
maybe we should wait for him in galilee 
no  we promised the master
we would wait here 
that was over a month ago 
thousands of people are waiting
to see and to hear him and he s gone 
the whole movement  we look like fools 
nathaniel s right  he makes sense 
let s return to galilee 
if we go back to galilee  like peter says  
brothers 
i don t understand you 
think of the last words the baptist said 
he said   jesus of nazareth 
leave the desert  i am finished 
 you return to mankind  
how do we know he really said that 
 everybody says he did 
 but how do we know 
 even if he didn t  the words are important 
 why 
because people believe them 
and what if our master s    
what if he s the one 
what  one  
 the one 
 what do you mean  the messiah 
we don t know the baptist said that 
nobody knows 
he s not like elijah 
he s saying that the world of god
is here now 
he just meant   continue my work 
 continue to do the work i ve been doing  
right here elijah ascended to heaven 
doesn t that mean something to you 
we re waiting here 
we re waiting here 
i don t think we should go back to galilee 
i think we should wait here 
that s what i love about you  peter 
you re as steady and as solid as a rock 
nobody can change your mind 
what good are you 
master 
rabbi 
john heard your footsteps in his heart   
   in a way  and we were preparing
to welcome you 
were you baptized 
yes 
john baptized with water
and they killed him 
now i baptize with fire 
is that what the baptist told you 
i have an invitation for you 
is there a celebration 
no 
i m not inviting you to a celebration 
i m inviting you to a war 
this is my heart 
take it 
god is inside of us 
the devil is outside us 
in the world all around us 
we ll pick up an axe
and cut the devil s throat 
we ll fight him wherever he is 
in the sick   
   in the rich   
   even in the temple 
i ll lead you 
if you have sheep   
   give them away 
if you have a family   
   leave them 
i believed in love 
now i believe in this 
who s with me 
adonai 
today and tomorrow i cast out devils
and work cures 
on the third day   
   l shall be perfected 
out 
satan  leave 
satan  out 
leave him 
moses  elijah  lsaiah   
   touch my mouth   
   touch my lips 
go to the temple 
let the high priests see you 
look 
he was blind and jesus healed him  look 
he was blind and jesus healed him  look 
you don t belong at a wedding 
we re here to celebrate purity 
i m sorry  but these people are my guests 
let me explain something to you 
what do you think heaven s like 
it s like a wedding 
god s the bridegroom
and man s spirit s the bride 
the wedding takes place in heaven   
   and everyone s invited 
god s world is big enough for everyone 
nazarene  that s against the law 
then the law s against my heart 
don t touch me

brothers 
my old friends  listen to me 
it s me the prophets preached about 
god talked to me in the desert 
he gave me a secret
and told me to bring it to you 
didn t you hear me coming 
i ran here to nazareth  where i grew up 
to bring you the news 
the world of god is here now 
you work miracles 
make a miracle for us  make us believe
in you  otherwise go away 
the messiah doesn t need miracles 
he is the miracle  now he s here 
are you ready for me 
i m here to tear down everything around
you  you know what i ll replace it with 
something new 
god 
the world of god 
so take your bread and give it to the poor 
what difference does it make
what you own 
you have gold and silver  it s going to rot 
that rot is going to eat away your hearts 
all of you 
there will be a flood and a fire 
everything will be destroyed 
but there will be a new ark
riding on that fire 
and i hold the keys and i open the door 
and i decide who goes in and who doesn t 
you re my brothers from nazareth
and you re the first i invite on the ark 
don t wait  don t waste your life 
come with me 
you re the son of mary  right 
who are you to tell us about god 
he made better crosses than speeches 
go get someone from his family
to take him away  he s insane 
what are you laughing at 
everything you have will burn  soon 
get out now 
come with me to jerusalem 
see  this is what happens
when a man doesn t get married 
the semen backs up into his brain 
go home  you re a demon 
you re possessed  you re a lunatic 
this is my home 
 you should be ashamed 
 kill him  he s going to burn us 
don t touch him 
if i could touch every stone   
   if i could breathe on every branch 
they d get up and follow me 
so what s wrong with you 
come with me to jerusalem 
jerusalem is falling  i feel it 
i know it 
you see these people 
they re poor  they re blind 
they re crippled 
they re going to be our army 
we re going to need better men than this 
god will give them to me 
we re going to build a new jerusalem 
son 
come back with me  please 
who are you 
 your mother 
 i don t have a mother 
i don t have any family 
i have a father  in heaven 
don t say that to me 
who are you 
i mean  really 
who are you 
why are you crying 
didn t you see them 
what 
when he spoke to you  there were
thousands of blue wings behind him 
i swear to you  mary 
there were armies of angels 
 there were 
 thousands 
i d be happier if there weren t 
when was he buried 
three days ago 
roll away the stone 
lazarus 
lazarus 
in the name of the prophets   
   in the name of jeremiah and my father   
   in the name of the most holy god   
   l call you here 
i call you here 
lazarus 
lazarus 
adonai 
god  help me 
we came here to pray 
look at this 
the money changers 
it s for the temple tax  for the feast 
i know 
i know 
how s the exchange today 
fair  at this stall it s always fair 
making a good profit 
fair 
this is my father s house 
it is a place of worship   
   not a market 
nazarene  what are you doing 
what are you doing 
god doesn t need a palace 
he doesn t need cypress trees
or dead animals 
he doesn t need shekels 
you expect people to pay the tax
with roman coins 
they have images of false gods on them 
you want pagan gods in the temple 
all foreign coins have to be exchanged
for shekels  that is the law 
i m throwing away the law 
i have a new law and a new hope 
what 
has god changed his mind
about the old law 
no  he just thinks our hearts are ready
to hold more  that s all 
this chaos is your new law 
how can you presume  
how can i presume  i m the end of the
old law and the beginning of the new one 
 watch what you re saying 
 maybe we should go 
when i say   i   rabbi   
   l m saying  god  
that s blasphemy 
didn t they tell you 
i m the saint of blasphemy 
don t make any mistakes 
i didn t come here to bring peace 
i came to bring a sword 
talking like that will get you killed 
me killed  listen to me 
this temple will be destroyed
in three days  torn down to the ground 
there won t be one stone left
to build with 
you think god belongs only to you 
he doesn t 
god s an immortal spirit
who belongs to everybody   
   to the whole world 
you think you re special 
god is not an lsraelite 
magician  heal me 
cure us  make us rich 
heal me  do a miracle 
you want me to enter the world of god
crippled like this 
don t touch me  you re filled with hate 
get away  god won t help you 
you cure us 
or you won t leave this city alive 
you don t make demands on god 
judas  what are you doing
with this magician 
you had orders to kill him
and you haven t done it 
now he acts like a prophet
and you follow him 
did you hear what he said
back there  saul 
yes  i heard him 
we took an oath against rome 
i don t see anything against rome here 
all i see are jews against jews 
then you re not listening 
lazarus 
how do you feel 
i like the light 
what was it like 
which is better  death or life 
i was a little surprised 
there wasn t that much difference 
give me your hand 
i m not surprised 
how could they let lazarus live 
he was proof of your greatest miracle 
now there s no more proof 
that s what the zealots want 
their revolution  not yours 
you want to go back to them 
no  you re the one i follow 
you are the strongest  aren t you 
of all my friends   
   you re the strongest 
judas  my brother   
   l ve something to tell you 
i have a terrible secret from god 
 you know why i came to jerusalem 
 yes 
this is where the revolution
is going to begin 
last night lsaiah came to me 
he had a prophecy  i saw it written 
it said 
 he has borne our faults   
    he was wounded
for our transgressions   
    yet he opened not his mouth 
 despised and rejected by all   
    he went forward without resisting 
like a lamb led to the slaughter   
i don t understand 
judas  i am the lamb 
i m the one who s going to die 
die 
 you mean you re not the messiah 
 i am 
that can t be  if you re the messiah 
why do you have to die 
 listen  at first  i didn t understand  
 no  you  listen 
every day you have a different plan 
first it s love  then it s the axe 
and now you have to die 
 what good could that do 
 i can t help it 
god only talks to me a little at a time 
he tells me as much as i need to know 
 we need you alive 
 now i finally understand 
all my life i ve been followed   
   by voices   
   by footsteps   
   by shadows  and do you know
what the shadow is 
the cross 
i have to die on the cross
and i have to die willingly 
we have to go back to the temple 
after you die on the cross 
what happens then 
i come back to judge
the living and the dead 
i don t believe you 
you have to 
i m worried he s going
to change his mind again 
no  he won t 
this time we re not going
to the temple to pray 
he said he ll destroy the temple
in three days  and he ll do it 
and what if he doesn t 
 what then 
 what if he doesn t 
you won t have to worry
because we ll all be dead 
we re setting up a new government 
building a new jerusalem 
we can ask for anything we want 
first  i d like more sheep 
you know  my other sheep 
i don t even know where they are now 
this time i want a large herd  and i ll get
other shepherds to care for them 
i would just like to be able
to worship in the temple 
i mean really worship 
without roman banners and soldiers 
that s what i d like 
of course  but what else 
i ll do anything the master asks 
anything but get crucified 
 you re a coward  thomas 
 yes  i am 
you know why 
have you ever seen anyone
on a cross after two days 
you know what they look like 
they don t even have eyes 
the crows come and suck out your eyes 
and after that  you know what 
dogs come and rip your feet off 
don t talk that way 
i ve made my decision  you make yours 
and if you can t  then get out now
before we get to jerusalem 
i m ready  i have my knife 
master  i ve been talking with the others
and listening and    
some of them wanted me to ask you 
will there be angels there to meet us 
or anyone besides who s here 
master 
king of the jews 
king of the jews 
king of the jews 
jesus 
lord  i hope this is what you want 
let me die here 
please let it happen fast
while i have the strength 
i am here to set fire to the world 
in the desert  the baptist warned us 
god is coming 
well  i m telling you it s too late 
he s already here 
i m here 
i m going to baptize everybody with fire 
he s leading us  follow him 
they re all with you 
waiting for your signal  give it 
now  do it now 
please 
i m waiting  too  give me an axe 
not the cross  let me die like this 
give the sign now or we re finished 
 they ll kill us  
 we came to fight  not to die 
master  we knew it would be like this 
this is the way  do it 
judas  help me 
stay with me 
don t leave me 
i wish there was another way 
i m sorry  but there isn t 
i have to die on the cross 
i won t let you die 
you have no choice  neither do l 
remember  we re bringing
god and man together 
they ll never be together unless i die 
i m the sacrifice 
without you  there can be no redemption 
forget everything else  understand that 
no  i can t  get somebody stronger 
you promised me 
remember  you once told me   
   that if i moved one step from revolution 
you d kill me  remember 
yes 
i ve strayed  haven t l 
yes 
then you must keep your promise 
you have to kill me 
if that s what god wants  let god do it 
i won t 
he will do it through you 
the temple guards will be looking for me
where there aren t any crowds 
we ll go to gethsemane 
you ll make sure that they find me there 
i am going to die 
but after three days   
   l ll come back  in victory 
you can t leave me 
you have to give me strength 
if you were me 
could you betray your master 
no 
that s why god gave me the easier job   
   to be crucified 
what about the others 
i ll tell them tonight 
listen to me 
take this bread 
share it together 
this bread is my body 
now drink this wine 
pass the cup 
this wine is my blood 
do this to remember me 
we re not finished 
let him go 
all of you   
   l want to tell you something 
wait for me here 
father in heaven 
father on earth 
the world   
   that you ve created 
that we can see  is beautiful 
but the world you ve created 
that we can t see  is beautiful  too 
i don t know  i m sorry  father 
i don t know which is more beautiful 
this is my body  too 
together   
   we re going to die 
please  father 
i ve been with you for so long 
i never asked you to choose me 
i always did as you said 
you made many miracles for others 
you opened the red sea for moses 
you saved noah 
you took elijah to heaven
in a fiery chariot   
   and now you re asking me to be crucified 
can i ask you   
   one last time 
do i have to die 
is there any other way 
you re offering me a cup 
but i don t want to drink what s in it 
please  take it away  please  stop 
please  father  father 
please 
is this your answer 
all right 
just please give me the strength 
couldn t you stay awake with me
for just an hour 
i m sorry 
it doesn t matter 
it s too late 
welcome  rabbi 
no  you live by this  you die by it 
take me with you 
i m ready 
so  you are the king of the jews 
 king  is your word 
well  you are jesus of nazareth 
aren t you 
yes  i am 
that s what they re saying you are 
the king  the messiah 
it s also said that you do miracles 
is this good magic or bad magic 
could we have
some kind of a demonstration 
i mean  can you do a trick for me  now 
no  i m not a trained animal 
i m not a magician 
that s disappointing 
this means that you re just
another jewish politician 
do you want to know something 
you re more dangerous than the zealots 
do you know that 
say something 
you had better say something 
all right 
tell me what you tell people
on the streets 
 yes 
 yes 
the prophet daniel had a vision 
a tall statue that had a gold head
and silver shoulders 
the stomach was bronze 
the legs were iron  the feet were clay 
a stone was thrown 
the clay feet broke
and the statue collapsed 
you see  god threw the stone 
the stone is me  and rome  
and rome is the statue  yes 
so your kingdom  or your world 
will replace rome 
where is it 
my kingdom 
it s not here 
not on earth 
it wouldn t be  would it 
it s one thing to want to change
the way that people live   
   but you want to change
how they think  how they feel 
all i m saying is that change
will happen with love  not with killing 
either way  it s dangerous 
it s against rome 
it s against the way the world is 
and killing or loving  it s all the same 
it simply doesn t matter
how you want to change things 
we don t want them changed 
you do understand what has to happen 
we have a space for you up on golgotha 
three thousand skulls there by now 
probably more 
guard 
i do wish you people would go out
and count them some time 
maybe you d learn a lesson 
probably not 
i know you  i saw you with him 
you must be mistaken  it wasn t me 
it must have been someone else 
no  i m right  he is one of his followers 
 he doesn t know what he s talking about 
 he is one of his followers 
it s him  get him 
mother 
magdalene 
where are you 
mother  i m sorry for being a bad son 
father  stay with me  don t leave me 
father  forgive them 
father 
why have you forsaken me 
who are you 
i m the angel who guards you 
your father is the god of mercy 
not punishment 
he saw you and said 
 aren t you his guardian angel 
 well  go down and save him 
he s suffered enough  
remember when he told abraham
to sacrifice his son 
abraham was just about to kill the boy
with his knife when god stopped him 
so  if he saved abraham s son 
don t you think he d want to save his own 
he s tested you and he s happy with you 
he doesn t want your blood 
he said   let him die in a dream 
but let him live his life  
all the pain 
that was real 
yes  but there won t be any more 
you ve done enough 
i don t have to be sacrificed 
no  you don t 
i m not the messiah 
no  you re not 
what about the others 
don t look back there 
god gave you life  look ahead 
where are the disciples 
they became frightened and ran away 
is this the world of god 
the one i spoke about 
no  this is earth 
why has it changed so much 
it hasn t changed  you have 
now you can see its real beauty 
harmony between earth and the heart 
that s the world of god 
maybe you ll find this hard to believe   
   but sometimes we angels
look down on men and envy you 
really envy you 
what s that 
a wedding ceremony 
who s getting married 
you are 
what s wrong 
why are you crying 
i m thanking god   
   for bringing you here 
we could have a child 
we could have a child 
where are you going 
who are you going to kill 
are you going to kill god 
didn t you hear me  jesus 
there is nothing you can do 
god s killed her 
god s killed her 
god took her away when she was happy 
now she s immortal 
she won t see her love die or body decay 
i was there the whole time
he was killing her and saw what happened 
but it wasn t right 
it wasn t right for god to take her 
you didn t complain when god let you live 
you can t complain now
because he let her die 
trust god s way 
listen  there s only one woman
in the world 
one woman with many faces 
this one falls  the next one rises 
mary magdalene died   
   but mary  lazarus s sister   
   she lives 
she s magdalene with a different face 
she s carrying your greatest joy inside her 
your son 
come with me 
this is the way the savior comes 
gradually  from embrace to embrace 
from son to son 
this is the road 
i understand 
mary 
look 
rabbi  i just want to see if it s really you 
he s real  like us  don t you see 
come in 
come here 
master  i want to tell you one thing 
i m sorry about magdalene 
i won t ever leave you alone again 
i ll always protect you 
i don t want you to take the wrong road
and get lost again 
come inside  i ll cook for you
and your friend 
are you satisfied with me 
do you have any complaints 
none 
i m ashamed when i think of it 
of what 
of all the mistakes i ve made 
of all the wrong ways i looked for god 
where s mary 
she won t be back till this evening 
come inside  it s too hot out here 
come inside 
there s only one woman in the world 
go inside 
we don t have to get involved 
come on  stay out of it 
here  watch your brother 
remember to thank god for the food
and leave some for me  i ll be back soon 
 aren t you going to eat 
 i want to hear what he says 
you don t have to go there 
i lied  i stole  i cheated   
   l gambled  i whored  i drank
and persecuted  tortured and murdered 
yes  murdered 
i killed anyone
who broke the law of moses 
and i loved it  i enjoyed it 
i relished it  i reveled in it 
because i thought i was doing god s will 
i thought i was doing god s will 
and the high priest of jerusalem sent me
to damascus to scourge that city 
and on the road to damascus  just outside
the city  in the middle of the day   
   l was struck by a white light
that blinded me 
yes 
and i heard a voice say 
 saul  why are you persecuting me 
 why are you against me  
 who are you   i said 
and the voice said 
 jesus  
and he   
   made me see 
i was led helpless like a child 
into a city that i was sent to scourge 
and god sent me ananias instead   
   and he put his hands on me
and i opened my eyes   
   and i was baptized and became paul 
and now i bring the good news to you 
it s about jesus of nazareth 
he was not the son of mary 
he was the son of god 
his mother was a virgin 
and the angel gabriel came down
and put god s seed in her womb 
that s how he was born 
and he was punished for our sins 
then he was tortured and crucified 
but three days later
he rose up from the dead   
   and went up to heaven 
death was conquered 
amen 
do you understand what that means 
he conquered death 
all of our sins were forgiven   
   and now the world of god
is open to every one of us 
to everybody 
did you ever see this jesus of nazareth
after he came back from the dead 
i mean  with your own eyes 
no  but i saw a light that blinded me
and i heard his voice 
 you re a liar 
 his disciples saw him 
they were hiding in an attic 
the doors locked  and he appeared to them 
liar 
he s a liar 
wait a minute 
wait a minute  i want to talk to you 
i was never crucified  i never came back
from the dead  i m a man 
quiet 
why are you telling these lies 
what are you talking about 
i m the son of mary and joseph 
i m the one who preached in galilee 
i had followers  we marched on jerusalem 
pilate condemned me and god saved me 
no  he didn t 
who are you talking about  don t try
to tell me what happened  because i know 
i live like a man now 
i work  eat  have children 
i enjoy my life  for the first time 
i m enjoying it  do you understand me 
so don t go around telling lies about me 
or i ll tell everybody the truth 
wait just a minute 
what s the matter with you 
look around you  look at all these people 
look at their faces 
do you see how unhappy they are 
do you see how they re suffering 
their only hope is the resurrected jesus 
i don t care whether you re jesus or not 
the resurrected jesus will save the world
and that s what matters 
those are lies 
you can t save the world by lying 
i created the truth out of what
people needed and what they believed 
if i have to crucify you to save the world 
then i ll crucify you 
and if i have to resurrect you 
then i ll do that  too 
i won t let you  i ll tell everyone the truth 
go ahead  go on  tell them now 
who s going to believe you 
you started all this  now you can t stop it 
all those people who believe me
will kill you 
 no  that wouldn t happen 
 how do you know 
you see  you don t know
how much people need god 
you don t know how happy
he can make them  happy to do anything 
he can make them happy to die
and they ll die 
all for the sake of christ 
jesus christ 
jesus of nazareth 
the son of god  the messiah 
not you 
not for your sake 
you know  i m glad i met you 
because now i can forget all about you 
my jesus is much more important
and much more powerful 
thank you  it s a good thing i met you 
don t ever leave me 
i m happy here 
i remember when mary and i
planted these vines 
you know  this will all pass 
why 
are you leaving me 
we have to move on 
you ve grown old 
you ve done well 
we ve both done well 
get inside  get inside  fast 
jerusalem is on fire  it s burning 
the romans are killing everyone 
move out of the way  we were sent here 
god told us you would show yourself to us 
he said you were dying 
peter  ls that you 
i can t tell 
what happened to you 
i got old 
you got old 
this one i know 
no matter how old you get 
i know you  nathaniel 
you were the best shepherd
because you had no sheep 
rabbi 
i missed you 
and you 
they cut you 
your face 
who are you 
john 
the romans tortured me  cut my face 
i tried to tell them all about you 
then i saw jerusalem burn 
i even saw the ark of the covenant
stolen from the temple 
they destroyed the temple 
just like you said 
the ark 
there s someone else outside 
be careful  he s still angry 
judas 
judas  come in 
didn t you hear me 
i missed you so much 
he hears you  he just won t say anything 
he s been fighting in jerusalem 
look at his hands 
there s still blood on them 
judas  the master is speaking to you 
answer him 
traitor 
your place was on the cross 
that s where god put you 
when death got too close 
you got scared and you ran away   
   and you hid yourself
in the life of some man 
we did what we were supposed to do 
you didn t 
you re a coward 
don t you have any respect 
for him 
you don t understand 
understand 
you broke my heart 
sometimes i curse the day i ever met you 
we held the world in our hands 
remember what you told me 
you took me in your arms 
do you remember 
and you begged me 
 betray me  betray me 
 i have to be crucified 
 i have to be resurrected
so i can save the world 
 i am the lamb   you said 
 death is the door 
 judas  my brother  don t be afraid 
help me go through the door  
and i loved you so much 
i went and betrayed you 
and you   
   you    
what are you doing here 
what business do you have here
with women  with children 
what s good for man isn t good for god 
why weren t you crucified 
look at his wounds  judas 
they re bleeding 
you re hurting him  that s enough 
he was going to be the new covenant 
now there s no more lsrael 
no  you don t understand 
the guardian angel 
god sent a guardian angel to save me 
what angel 
look at her 
satan 
i told you we would meet again 
if you die this way  you die like a man 
you turned against god  your father 
there s no sacrifice  there s no salvation 
there s nothing you can do 
you lived this life 
you accepted it 
it s over now 
you just finish it and die 
die like a man 
father 
will you listen to me 
are you still there 
will you listen to a selfish  unfaithful son 
i fought you when you called  i resisted 
i thought i knew more  i didn t want
to be your son  can you forgive me 
i didn t fight hard enough 
father   
   give me your hand 
i want to bring salvation 
father  take me back 
make a feast  welcome me home 
i want to be your son 
i want to pay the price
