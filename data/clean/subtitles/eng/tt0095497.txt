has always been a deep
inscrutable mystery to me
my principle anguish and source
of all my joys and sorrows
from my youth onward
has been the incessant
merciless battle between
the spirit and the flesh
and my soul is the arena
where these two armies
have clashed and met
nikos kazantzakis
from the book
the last temptation of christ
this film is not based upon the gospels
but upon this fictional exploration
of the eternal spiritual conflict
the last temptation of christ
the feeling begins
very tender very loving
then the pain starts
claws slip underneath the skin
and tear their way up
just before they reach my eyes
they dig in
and i remember
first i fasted for three months
i even whipped myself
before i went to sleep
at first it worked
then the pain came back and the voices
they call me by name
jesus
who is it who are you
why are you following me
are you ready
no more crosses were ready
where is your mind
do you hear what im saying
the messiah wont come that way
what do you mean by that
who told you
youre a disgrace
romans cant find anyone to make crosses
except for you you do it
youre worse than them
youre a jew killing jews
youre a coward
how will you ever pay for your sins
with my life judas
i dont have anything else
dont turn away look at me
with your life what do you mean

god is with us hes judging us fight

come come with me
this man naked before you now
is condemned for sedition
for lifting his hand against rome
seditio
he rallied the people to revolution
he promised that a messiah
would come from among the people
to rise up and destroy rome
rome is nothing
murder
betrayal
looting and so on and so therefore
he is condemned to die
rome condemns him
and all the gods of rome condemn him
god is our shield
he is our shield
he is our heart he is our heart
he is our shield he is our shield
he will not abandon you
he will not abandon you
god
god loves me i know he loves me
i want him to stop i cant take the pain
the voices and the pain
i want him to hate me i fight him
i make crosses so hell hate me
i want him to find somebody else
i want to crucify every one of his messiahs
youre sure its god
youre sure its not the devil
im not sure
im not sure of anything
if its the devil the devil can be cast out
but what if its god
you cant cast out god can you
whos that whos following me

he came down to show me the way
whos out there

what are you doing here
i want you to forgive me
ive done too many bad things
im going to the desert
and i need you to forgive me
before i go please
i see
you sit out there all day with the others
and then come in here with
your head down saying forgive me
forgive me
its not that easy
just because you need forgiveness
dont ask me to do it
im sorry
get out go away
look mary
look at this
god can change this
god can save your soul
he already broke my heart
he took you away from me
and i hate both of you
hate me blame me
its all my fault but not gods
dont say that about god
who made me feel this way about god
i know thats why im here
its why i want you to forgive me
ill pay my debt
i know
there are some things ive done
and to you
pay or go away
dont you remember
no i dont remember why should l
nothings changed
say the truth
if you want to save my soul
this is where youll find it
you know that
youre the same as all the others
only you cant admit it
youre pitiful
i hate you
heres my body
save it
save it
is that the way you show youre a man
turn away dont look at me
you never had the courage to be a man
dont look at me
if you werent hanging on to your mother
you were hanging on to me
now youre hanging on to god
going to the desert to hide
because youre scared
go whenever i see you my heart breaks
i do remember when we were children
never have i felt so much tenderness
toward anyone
as i felt toward you then
all i ever wanted was you
nothing else
what do you think i wanted
please
stay
is it so bad sharing a prostitutes room
i wont touch you
youll still be a virgin for the desert
mary im sorry i cant stay
welcome this way
do you always pray this late at night
its a funeral
the master of the monastery died
shall i pray with you
sleep you must be tired
i know who you are
that was the man
who brought me here last night
last night
he was dead last night
the masters soul has gone to heaven
his bodys work is completed
it walked under the sun and the moon
over sand and stone
sinned felt pain
yearned for heaven
we commend his remains to our god
flesh
the master no longer needs you
melt away
first came the wings then the angel
his spirit actually appeared to you
he treated you like a royal visitor
he recognized you for something
he couldnt have recognized me
for anything
i only came here to serve god thats all
thats all god wants from me
im sure of it
think of how youre blessed
god actually makes himself known to you
i dont know what god wants from me
all my life ive wanted to hear gods voice
ive dedicated my life to him
sometimes
l think i feel him
but im never really sure
but you always know god took you
by the hand and brought you here
you think its a blessing
to know what god wants
ill tell you what he wants
he wants to push me over
cant he see whats inside of me
all my sins
we all sin
not my sins
im a liar a hypocrite
im afraid of everything i dont tell
the truth i dont have the courage
when i see a woman
i blush and look away
i want her but i dont take her for god
and that makes me proud
then my pride ruins magdalene
i dont steal i dont fight
l dont kill not because i dont want to
but because im afraid
i want to rebel against you
against everything
against god but
lm afraid
you want to know
who my mother and father are
you want to know who my god is
fear
you look inside me
and thats all youll find
but the more devils we have inside of us
the more of a chance we have to repent
lucifer is inside me
he says to me
youre not the son of king david
youre not a man youre the son of man
and more the son of god
and more than that god
do you want to ask me anything else
everything is from god
everything has two meanings
jesus my sweet jesus
i forgive you
leave me
theyve gone
you have to leave too
no i have to stay
no
youve been purified
god has just blessed you
the snakes came from inside you
now you have to leave too
you have to go back
and speak to people
and share your heart
speak to who
to anyone who will listen
and say what
just open your mouth
do you love mankind
i see men and i feel sorry for them
thats all
thats enough
ive got orders to kill you
go ahead
tonight i was purified i cant fight
with god anymore heres my neck
cut it im ready
what are you
what kind of a man are you
what you want i want
thats why he brought us together
its gods plan
i come to kill you and you help me
thats gods plan
these voices you hear its gods voice
only you understand it
youd better make me understand it too
ill tell you as much as i know
the fainting spells the voices the visions
power magic
is there some secret
tell me your secret
pity
pity for who yourself
pity for men
our enemies are men
i feel pity for everything
donkeys
grass sparrows
and ants you feel pity for them too
yes
everythings a part of god
when i see an ant
when i look at his shiny black eye
you know what i see
i see the face of god
youre not afraid of dying
why should i be
death isnt a door that closes it opens
it opens and you go through it
if i dont kill you what happens
ill speak to people
what are you going to say
ill just open my mouth
and god will do the talking
maybe god didnt send you here to kill me
maybe he sent you here to follow me
just so theres no mistake
ill go with you until i understand
but if you stray this much
from the path ill kill you
its magdalene
she deserves it
get out of there get out of the way
this is not your business
do you want to get hurt
did you hear what he said idiot move
no
i dont want this
listen to him he doesnt want this
well we want it
why
we dont have to tell you why
ive had enough we live in a whorehouse
shes a jew she works on the sabbath
she goes with romans on the sabbath
she broke moses law she dies
who has never sinned who
which one of you people has never sinned
whoever that is come up here
and throw these
i have nothing to hide
good take this its bigger
be careful zebedee
there is a god
hes seen you cheat your workers
hes seen you with that widow
whats her name
judith
judith
arent you afraid god will paralyze you
if you lift that stone
that your arm will wither
that youll lose all strength
god has so many miracles
what ifl say the wrong thing
what ifl say the right thing
come closer
come closer were all a family
come closer so you can hear
i have something to tell you
who is he
its jesus from nazareth
nothing good can come out of nazareth
even the scriptures say so
im sorry but
the easiest way to make myself clear
is to tell you a story
a farmer was planting in his field
some seed fell on the ground
and the birds ate it
some seed fell on rocks and dried up
but some seed
some seed fell on rich soil
and grew into enough wheat
to feed a whole nation
can you hear me
we can hear you fine
im the farmer the farmer is me
and 2 and 2 makes 4
another lunatic
rabbi
tell me if youre the farmer
and were the stones whats the seed
whats the seed
love
love one another
thats easy to say maybe thats
good advice but for some other world
these people are starving
first you feed them then you talk
i used to think god was angry too
but not anymore
he used to jump on me like a wild bird
and dig his claws into my head
but then one morning he came to me
he blew over me like a cool breeze
and said stand up
and here i am
and you will go to hell
these are childrens stories
how can they help us
what are you hungry for
what are you thirsty for for justice
and bread
bread too
youre thirsty for justice
for people to treat you fairly
for people to treat you with respect
what im telling you is
whoevers hungry for justice
they are the ones wholl be blessed
theyll be filled with bread
theyll never be hungry again
theyll have the real value
the value of love
to love share and comfort
theyll have the courage to do the good
and you youre mourning
mourners will be blessed
youll have god to comfort you
you wont need men to do it
and the meek
theyre the ones wholl be blessed
and the suffering theyll be blessed too
and the peacemakers and the merciful
and the sick and the poor
and the outcasts
youll all be blessed
because heaven is yours
and believe me
believe me
those who are laughing now
will be crying later
those whose stomachs are filled now
will be hungry later
and the rich will be poor forever
kill them
i didnt say death
i said love
i said love
enough come
no father im staying
we have to work i need you
come
im sorry father im staying too
not the two of you come on
let me come with you i can help
stay here
youll know when
tell people about me
james
andrew
move over john
move over james
i was just comfortable
peter wants to lay down
peter theres no more room
im cold i want to be by the fire
go over by philip were all cold
shut up
rabbi can i talk to you
im not like these other men
i mean theyre good enough
theyre good men but theyre weak
ones worse than the other
whered you find them
look at me
if i love somebody i would die for them
if i hate somebody id kill them
i could even kill somebody i loved
if they did the wrong thing
did you hear me
do you understand what i said
yes i understand
the other day you said if a man hit you
youd turn the other cheek
i didnt like that
only an angel could do that or a dog
im sorry but im neither
im a free man
i dont turn my cheek to anyone
we both want the same thing
we do
do you want freedom for lsrael
no
i want freedom for the soul
no thats what i cant accept
thats not the same thing
first you free the body then the spirit
the romans come first
you dont build a house from the roof down
but from the foundation up
the foundation is the soul
the foundation is the body
thats where you must begin
if you dont change the spirit first
change whats inside
then youll only replace the romans
with someone else and nothing changes
even if youre victorious
youll still be filled with the poison
youve got to break the chain of evil
how do you change then
with love
whos there
its me andrew
is everything
its all right go back to sleep
judas and i are talking
theres an example
you know the zealots
ordered me to kill you
why did you change your mind
i decided to wait
for what
i thought maybe you were the one
to unite us i didnt want to destroy that
how do we know
how could i be the messiah
when those people were torturing
magdalene i wanted to kill them
and then i opened my mouth
and out comes the word iove
why i dont understand
i cant look to the others for answers
all they do is follow you
well go to judea and see john the baptist
every day he tells hundreds of people
the messiah is coming hell know
hell know
im afraid
stay with me
behold
i will raise up evil against you
out of your own house
and i will take your wives
before your eyes
and give them to your neighbor
and he shall lie with your wives
in the sight of this sun
you may listen and listen again
but you will never understand
you may look but you will never know
these peoples wits are dulled
their ears are deafened
and their eyes blinded
so they cannot see with their eyes
nor hear with their ears
so that they may turn and be healed
the lord of hosts says on this day
he sounds like the messiah
no
l will crush the horns of the new moon
and i will spill darkness over the world
i will reverse your laughter
turn it into tears
go in front let him see you
listen it is the thunder
of many peoples
even from behind
i knew i had seen him before
where
was it a dream
yes it was
but in the dream he was dressed in white
you will have the smell of decay
and branding instead of beauty
your men shall fall by the sword
and your women
shall sit on the ground stripped bare
who are you
do you recognize me
who are you
do you know the prophets
what does lsaiah say
he says prepare the way of the lord
are you telling me thats you
i dont know tell me
why are you here
to be baptized
no i dont dare
if youre the master
then you have to baptize me
baptize me
love what does it mean
love is sweet as honey
but its also blood
love is action
you want a new crop you burn the earth
but isnt love enough
no look at the world look around you
plague war corruption
false prophets false idols
worship of gold
nothing is of value
the tree is rotten
you have to take the axe and cut it down
if i was a woodcutter id cut
if i was a fire id burn
but im a heart and i love
and thats all i can do
im a heart also
but i cant love whats unjust
what i cant love i attack
god demands it
anger
yes god demands anger
anger but were all brothers
you think love is gods only way
go to the dead sea look in the bottom
youll see two whores
sodom and gomorrah
thats gods way
on the day of the lord
blood will flow from wood
the stones of the houses will come alive
and kill their owners
that day is here
he gave me the axe now i give it to you
thats not the answer
then what is the answer
i dont know
well if you wont listen to me
who will you listen to
god
the god of lsrael is the god of the desert
if you want to speak to him
then youll have to go to the desert
ill go to ldumaea
thank you baptist
be careful god isnt alone out there
i feel sorry for you
you were lonely
you cried so i came
i didnt call for you
who are you
your spirit
my spirit
youre afraid ofbeing alone
youre just like adam
he called me and i took one of his ribs
and made it into a woman
youre here to trick me
trick you
to love and care for a woman
to have a family is this a trick
why are you trying to save the world
arent your own sins enough for you
what arrogance
to think you can save the world
the world doesnt have to be saved
save yourself
find love
i have love
look
in my eyes
look at my breasts
do you recognize them
just nod your head
and well be in my bed together
jesus
after ten days
the hunger went away
welcome jesus congratulations
youre past the small temptations
of a woman and a family
were both bigger than that
who are you
you dont recognize me
im you im your heart
your heart is so greedy
it pretends to be humble
but it really wants to conquer the world
i never wanted a kingdom on earth
the kingdom of heaven is enough
youre a liar
when you were making crosses
for the romans
your head was exploding
with dreams ofpower
power over everyone
you said it was god
but you really wanted power
now you can have what you want
any country you want
all of them
you could even have rome
liar
step into my circle
so i can pull your tongue out
archangel move back
move back youre blinding me
jesus
im the one youve been waiting for
remember
when you were a little boy
you cried
make me a god god
god
god make me a god
but i was just a child then
you are god
the baptist knew it
now its time you admit it
you are his son
the only son of god
join me
together well rule the living and the dead
youll give life and youll take life
youll sit in judgement
and ill sit next to you
imagine how strong wed be together
satan
well see each other again
dont be afraid you are the one
my work is done
now i can die
the lord wants me to tell you to stand up
his day is here
take this axe
take this message to everyone
please
what do you want
im a foreigner
from galilee
im tired
you dont know how good this tastes
some more wine please
mary
martha
l want to say that youre both blessed
i came here you didnt know me
you took me in fed me restored me
and god came down
and went into my heart
go on
no
ive talked too much already
silence is better
no its not
do you have a wife
no
how can you live like that in the desert
tell me the truth
dont you miss all this
having a home a real life
i admit it
id like it but ill never have it
listen if you really want god
dont spend your time in the desert
hes not there hes right here
read your scriptures
god does not want you to fast and pray
he wants you to make children
mary youre making him uncomfortable
hes a guest
he knows what im talking about
come and help me
its not right to tease these men
i wasnt teasing
remember the baptist
its nothing to tease about
the baptist what
hes dead he was killed by herod
you didnt know
they say the king was drunk and cut off
the baptists head to satisfy him
now they say theyre going to kill everyone
who was baptized
no one forced you to be baptized
you were baptized too
you begged for it so be quiet
i can just imagine in galilee right now
the sea
they say the fishings so good you just
touch the nets and the fish jump in
dont talk about fish
it reminds me of my sheep
i dont know whats happened to them
maybe we should wait for him in galilee
no we promised the master
we would wait here
that was over a month ago
thousands of people are waiting
to see and to hear him and hes gone
the whole movement we look like fools
nathaniels right he makes sense
lets return to galilee
if we go back to galilee like peter says
brothers
i dont understand you
think of the last words the baptist said
he said jesus of nazareth
leave the desert i am finished
you return to mankind
how do we know he really said that
everybody says he did
but how do we know
even if he didnt the words are important
why
because people believe them
and what if our masters
what if hes the one
what one
the one
what do you mean the messiah
we dont know the baptist said that
nobody knows
hes not like elijah
hes saying that the world of god
is here now
he just meant continue my work
continue to do the work ive been doing
right here elijah ascended to heaven
doesnt that mean something to you
were waiting here
were waiting here
i dont think we should go back to galilee
i think we should wait here
thats what i love about you peter
youre as steady and as solid as a rock
nobody can change your mind
what good are you
master
rabbi
john heard your footsteps in his heart
in a way and we were preparing
to welcome you

the devil is outside us
in the world all around us
well pick up an axe
and cut the devils throat
well fight him wherever he is
in the sick

even in the temple
ill lead you
if you have sheep

brothers
my old friends listen to me
its me the prophets preached about
god talked to me in the desert
he gave me a secret
and told me to bring it to you
didnt you hear me coming
i ran here to nazareth where i grew up
to bring you the news
the world of god is here now
you work miracles

in you otherwise go away
the messiah doesnt need miracles
he is the miracle now hes here
are you ready for me
im here to tear down everything around
you you know what ill replace it with
something new
god
the world of god
so take your bread and give it to the poor
what difference does it make
what you own
you have gold and silver its going to rot
that rot is going to eat away your hearts
all of you
there will be a flood and a fire
everything will be destroyed
but there will be a new ark
riding on that fire
and i hold the keys and i open the door
and i decide who goes in and who doesnt
youre my brothers from nazareth
and youre the first i invite on the ark
dont wait dont waste your life

to take him away hes insane
what are you laughing at
everything you have will burn soon

see this is what happens
when a man doesnt get married
the semen backs up into his brain
go home youre a demon

this is my home
you should be ashamed
kill him hes going to burn us
dont touch him
if i could touch every stone
if i could breathe on every branch
theyd get up and follow me
so whats wrong with you
come with me to jerusalem
jerusalem is falling i feel it
i know it
you see these people
theyre poor theyre blind

roll away the stone
lazarus
lazarus
in the name of the prophets
in the name of jeremiah and my father
in the name of the most holy god
l call you here
i call you here
lazarus
lazarus
adonai
god help me
we came here to pray
look at this
the moneychangers
its for the temple tax for the feast
i know
i know
hows the exchange today
fair at this stall its always fair
making a good profit
fair
this is my fathers house
it is a place of worship
not a market
nazarene what are you doing
what are you doing
god doesnt need a palace
he doesnt need cypress trees
or dead animals
he doesnt need shekels
you expect people to pay the tax
with roman coins
they have images of false gods on them
you want pagan gods in the temple
all foreign coins have to be exchanged
for shekels that is the law
im throwing away the law
i have a new law and a new hope
what
has god changed his mind
about the old law
no he just thinks our hearts are ready
to hold more thats all
this chaos is your new law
how can you presume
how can i presume im the end of the
old law and the beginning of the new one
watch what youre saying
maybe we should go
when i say i rabbi
lm saying god
thats blasphemy
didnt they tell you
im the saint of blasphemy
dont make any mistakes
i didnt come here to bring peace
i came to bring a sword
talking like that will get you killed
me killed listen to me
this temple will be destroyed
in three days torn down to the ground
there wont be one stone left
to build with
you think god belongs only to you
he doesnt
gods an immortal spirit
who belongs to everybody
to the whole world
you think youre special
god is not an lsraelite
magician heal me
cure us make us rich
heal me do a miracle
you want me to enter the world of god
crippled like this
dont touch me youre filled with hate
get away god wont help you
you cure us
or you wont leave this city alive
you dont make demands on god
judas what are you doing
with this magician
you had orders to kill him
and you havent done it
now he acts like a prophet
and you follow him
did you hear what he said
back there saul
yes i heard him
we took an oath against rome
i dont see anything against rome here
all i see are jews against jews
then youre not listening
lazarus
how do you feel
i like the light
what was it like
which is better death or life
i was a little surprised
there wasnt that much difference
give me your hand
im not surprised
how could they let lazarus live
he was proof of your greatest miracle
now theres no more proof
thats what the zealots want
their revolution not yours
you want to go back to them
no youre the one i follow
you are the strongest arent you
of all my friends
youre the strongest
judas my brother
lve something to tell you
i have a terrible secret from god
you know why i came to jerusalem
yes
this is where the revolution
is going to begin
last night lsaiah came to me
he had a prophecy i saw it written
it said
he has borne our faults
he was wounded
for our transgressions
yet he opened not his mouth
despised and rejected by all
he went forward without resisting
like a lamb led to the slaughter
i dont understand
judas i am the lamb
im the one whos going to die
die
you mean youre not the messiah
i am
that cant be if youre the messiah
why do you have to die
listen at first i didnt understand
no you listen
every day you have a different plan
first its love then its the axe
and now you have to die
what good could that do
i cant help it
god only talks to me a little at a time
he tells me as much as i need to know
we need you alive
now i finally understand
all my life ive been followed
by voices
by footsteps
by shadows and do you know
what the shadow is
the cross
i have to die on the cross
and i have to die willingly
we have to go back to the temple
after you die on the cross
what happens then
i come back to judge
the living and the dead
i dont believe you

im worried hes going
to change his mind again
no he wont
this time were not going
to the temple to pray
he said hell destroy the temple
in three days and hell do it
and what if he doesnt
what then
what if he doesnt
you wont have to worry
because well all be dead

building a new jerusalem
we can ask for anything we want
first id like more sheep
you know my other sheep
i dont even know where they are now
this time i want a large herd and ill get
other shepherds to care for them
i would just like to be able
to worship in the temple
i mean really worship
without roman banners and soldiers
thats what id like
of course but what else
ill do anything the master asks
anything but get crucified
youre a coward thomas
yes i am
you know why
have you ever seen anyone
on a cross after two days
you know what they look like
they dont even have eyes
the crows come and suck out your eyes
and after that you know what
dogs come and rip your feet off
dont talk that way
ive made my decision you make yours
and if you cant then get out now
before we get to jerusalem
im ready i have my knife
master ive been talking with the others
and listening and
some of them wanted me to ask you
will there be angels there to meet us
or anyone besides whos here

king of the jews
king of the jews

god and man together
theyll never be together unless i die

no i cant get somebody stronger
you promised me
remember you once told me
that if i moved one step from revolution
youd kill me remember
yes
ive strayed havent l
yes
then you must keep your promise
you have to kill me
if thats what god wants let god do it
i wont
he will do it through you
the temple guards will be looking for me
where there arent any crowds
well go to gethsemane
youll make sure that they find me there
i am going to die
but after three days
lll come back in victory
you cant leave me
you have to give me strength
if you were me
could you betray your master
no
thats why god gave me the easier job
to be crucified
what about the others

this bread is my body
now drink this wine
pass the cup
this wine is my blood
do this to remember me
were not finished
let him go
all of you
l want to tell you something
wait for me here
father in heaven
father on earth
the world
that youve created
that we can see is beautiful
but the world youve created
that we cant see is beautiful too
i dont know im sorry father
i dont know which is more beautiful
this is my body too
together
were going to die
please father
ive been with you for so long
i never asked you to choose me
i always did as you said
you made many miracles for others
you opened the red sea for moses
you saved noah
you took elijah to heaven
in a fiery chariot
and now youre asking me to be crucified
can i ask you
one last time
do i have to die
is there any other way
youre offering me a cup
but i dont want to drink whats in it
please take it away please stop
please father father
please
is this your answer
all right
just please give me the strength
couldnt you stay awake with me
for just an hour
im sorry
it doesnt matter
its too late
welcome rabbi
no you live by this you die by it
take me with you
im ready
so you are the king of the jews
king is your word
well you are jesus of nazareth
arent you
yes i am
thats what theyre saying you are
the king the messiah
its also said that you do miracles
is this good magic or bad magic
could we have
some kind of a demonstration
i mean can you do a trick for me now
no im not a trained animal
im not a magician
thats disappointing
this means that youre just
another jewish politician
do you want to know something
youre more dangerous than the zealots
do you know that
say something
you had better say something
all right
tell me what you tell people
on the streets
yes
yes
the prophet daniel had a vision
a tall statue that had a gold head
and silver shoulders
the stomach was bronze
the legs were iron the feet were clay
a stone was thrown
the clay feet broke
and the statue collapsed
you see god threw the stone
the stone is me and rome
and rome is the statue yes
so your kingdom or your world
will replace rome
where is it
my kingdom
its not here
not on earth
it wouldnt be would it
its one thing to want to change
the way that people live
but you want to change
how they think how they feel
all im saying is that change
will happen with love not with killing
either way its dangerous
its against rome
its against the way the world is
and killing or loving its all the same
it simply doesnt matter
how you want to change things
we dont want them changed
you do understand what has to happen
we have a space for you up on golgotha
three thousand skulls there by now
probably more
guard
i do wish you people would go out
and count them some time
maybe youd learn a lesson
probably not
i know you i saw you with him
you must be mistaken it wasnt me
it must have been someone else
no im right he is one of his followers
he doesnt know what hes talking about
he is one of his followers
its him get him
mother
magdalene
where are you
mother im sorry for being a bad son
father stay with me dont leave me
father forgive them
father
why have you forsaken me
who are you
im the angel who guards you
your father is the god of mercy
not punishment
he saw you and said
arent you his guardian angel
well go down and save him
hes suffered enough
remember when he told abraham
to sacrifice his son
abraham was just about to kill the boy
with his knife when god stopped him
so if he saved abrahams son
dont you think hed want to save his own
hes tested you and hes happy with you
he doesnt want your blood
he said let him die in a dream
but let him live his life
all the pain
that was real
yes but there wont be any more
youve done enough
i dont have to be sacrificed
no you dont
im not the messiah
no youre not
what about the others
dont look back there
god gave you life look ahead
where are the disciples
they became frightened and ran away
is this the world of god
the one i spoke about
no this is earth
why has it changed so much
it hasnt changed you have
now you can see its real beauty
harmony between earth and the heart
thats the world of god
maybe youll find this hard to believe
but sometimes we angels
look down on men and envy you
really envy you
whats that
a wedding ceremony
whos getting married
you are
whats wrong
why are you crying
im thanking god
for bringing you here
we could have a child
we could have a child
where are you going
who are you going to kill
are you going to kill god
didnt you hear me jesus
there is nothing you can do
gods killed her
gods killed her
god took her away when she was happy
now shes immortal
she wont see her love die or body decay
i was there the whole time
he was killing her and saw what happened
but it wasnt right
it wasnt right for god to take her
you didnt complain when god let you live
you cant complain now
because he let her die
trust gods way
listen theres only one woman
in the world
one woman with many faces
this one falls the next one rises
mary magdalene died
but mary lazaruss sister

i lied i stole i cheated
l gambled i whored i drank
and persecuted tortured and murdered
yes murdered
i killed anyone
who broke the law of moses
and i loved it i enjoyed it
i relished it i reveled in it
because i thought i was doing gods will
i thought i was doing gods will
and the high priest of jerusalem sent me
to damascus to scourge that city
and on the road to damascus just outside
the city in the middle of the day
l was struck by a white light
that blinded me
yes
and i heard a voice say
saul why are you persecuting me
why are you against me
who are you i said
and the voice said
jesus
and he
made me see
i was led helpless like a child
into a city that i was sent to scourge
and god sent me ananias instead
and he put his hands on me
and i opened my eyes
and i was baptized and became paul
and now i bring the good news to you
its about jesus of nazareth
he was not the son of mary
he was the son of god
his mother was a virgin
and the angel gabriel came down
and put gods seed in her womb
thats how he was born
and he was punished for our sins
then he was tortured and crucified
but three days later
he rose up from the dead
and went up to heaven
death was conquered
amen
do you understand what that means
he conquered death
all of our sins were forgiven
and now the world of god
is open to every one of us
to everybody
did you ever see this jesus of nazareth
after he came back from the dead
i mean with your own eyes
no but i saw a light that blinded me
and i heard his voice
youre a liar
his disciples saw him
they were hiding in an attic
the doors locked and he appeared to them
liar
hes a liar
wait a minute
wait a minute i want to talk to you
i was never crucified i never came back
from the dead im a man
quiet
why are you telling these lies
what are you talking about
im the son of mary and joseph
im the one who preached in galilee
i had followers we marched on jerusalem
pilate condemned me and god saved me
no he didnt
who are you talking about dont try
to tell me what happened because i know
i live like a man now
i work eat have children
i enjoy my life for the first time
im enjoying it do you understand me
so dont go around telling lies about me
or ill tell everybody the truth
wait just a minute
whats the matter with you
look around you look at all these people
look at their faces
do you see how unhappy they are
do you see how theyre suffering
their only hope is the resurrected jesus
i dont care whether youre jesus or not
the resurrected jesus will save the world
and thats what matters
those are lies
you cant save the world by lying
i created the truth out of what
people needed and what they believed
if i have to crucify you to save the world
then ill crucify you
and if i have to resurrect you
then ill do that too
i wont let you ill tell everyone the truth
go ahead go on tell them now
whos going to believe you
you started all this now you cant stop it
all those people who believe me
will kill you
no that wouldnt happen
how do you know
you see you dont know
how much people need god
you dont know how happy
he can make them happy to do anything
he can make them happy to die
and theyll die
all for the sake of christ
jesus christ
jesus of nazareth
the son of god the messiah
not you
not for your sake
you know im glad i met you
because now i can forget all about you
my jesus is much more important
and much more powerful

i remember when mary and i
planted these vines

we have to move on
youve grown old

jerusalem is on fire its burning
the romans are killing everyone

because you had no sheep
rabbi
i missed you
and you
they cut you
your face
who are you
john
the romans tortured me cut my face
i tried to tell them all about you
then i saw jerusalem burn
i even saw the ark of the covenant
stolen from the temple
they destroyed the temple
just like you said
the ark
theres someone else outside
be careful hes still angry
judas
judas come in
didnt you hear me
i missed you so much
he hears you he just wont say anything
hes been fighting in jerusalem
look at his hands
theres still blood on them
judas the master is speaking to you
answer him
traitor
your place was on the cross
thats where god put you
when death got too close
you got scared and you ran away
and you hid yourself
in the life of some man
we did what we were supposed to do
you didnt
youre a coward
dont you have any respect
for him
you dont understand
understand
you broke my heart
sometimes i curse the day i ever met you
we held the world in our hands
remember what you told me
you took me in your arms
do you remember
and you begged me
betray me betray me
i have to be crucified
i have to be resurrected
so i can save the world
i am the lamb you said
death is the door
judas my brother dont be afraid
help me go through the door
and i loved you so much
i went and betrayed you
and you
you
what are you doing here
what business do you have here
with women with children
whats good for man isnt good for god
why werent you crucified
look at his wounds judas
theyre bleeding
youre hurting him thats enough
he was going to be the new covenant
now theres no more lsrael
no you dont understand
the guardian angel
god sent a guardian angel to save me
what angel
look at her
satan
i told you we would meet again
if you die this way you die like a man
you turned against god your father
theres no sacrifice theres no salvation
theres nothing you can do
you lived this life
you accepted it
its over now
you just finish it and die
die like a man
father

will you listen to a selfish unfaithful son
i fought you when you called i resisted
i thought i knew more i didnt want
to be your son can you forgive me
i didnt fight hard enough
father

i want to bring salvation
father take me back
make a feast welcome me home
