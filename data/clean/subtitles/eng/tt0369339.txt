pedro el negro  black peter  yeah 
there s an old mexican tale
that tells of how santa claus
got so very busy looking out
for the good children
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children 
so he hired pedro 
and santa claus gave him a list
with all the names
of all the bad children 
and pedro would come every night
to check them out 
and the people  the little kids
that were misbehaving 
that were not saying their prayers 
pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows 
a little burro 
and he would come back 
and if the children
were still misbehaving 
pedro would take them away 
and nobody would ever see them again 
now  if i am being santa claus 
and you are pedro 
how do you think jolly old
santa claus would feel
if one day pedro came into his office
and said   i lost the list
