pedro el negro black peter yeah
theres an old mexican tale
that tells of how santa claus
got so very busy looking out
for the good children
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children
so he hired pedro
and santa claus gave him a list
with all the names
of all the bad children
and pedro would come every night
to check them out
and the people the little kids
that were misbehaving
that were not saying their prayers
pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows
a little burro
and he would come back
and if the children
were still misbehaving
pedro would take them away
and nobody would ever see them again
now if i am being santa claus
and you are pedro
how do you think jolly old
santa claus would feel
if one day pedro came into his office
and said i lost the list
