the outrages committed by hitlers ss are
a stain on the honor of the german army
there is widespread disgust
in the officer corps
toward the crimes committed
by the nazis
the murder of civilians
the torture and starvation of prisoners
the mass execution of jews
my duty as an officer is no longer
to save my country
but to save human lives
i cannot find one general
in a position to confront hitler
with the courage to do it
colonel stauffenberg sir
the general will be here in four hours
thank you
ill need to see him when he arrives
i find myself surrounded by men
unwilling or unable to face the truth
hitler is not only
the archenemy of the entire world
but the archenemy of germany
a change must be made
colonel my orders are to advance
to sidi mansour and hold it
thats what well do
the british are moving up from the south
patton is closing in on the coast
you know
we should have left two days ago
no colonel
we keep fighting until the final victory
north africas lost and youre going to
need these men a year from now
to defend berlin
we can serve germany or the führer
not both
its just that sort of talk
that had you sent here colonel
what i said was much worse
general
im just trying
to get these men out of here alive
what would you have me do
tell command were low on water
wed have to reroute to mezzouna
join the 21st panzer
at least then wed have a chance
and the records will show that we didnt
have enough water to reach sidi mansour
i can guarantee it
see that its done
general
up
down
hitlers leaving
now
ja fuse
colonel brandt colonel brandt
my regards to colonel stieff
cointreau
lets hope i dont get thirsty on the flight
this is tresckow
hes landed
this is general tresckow
connect me with operations
colonel brandt
colonel tresckow
im glad you arrived safely
i hate to trouble you
but it seems you have the wrong bottles
for colonel stieff
you do still have the package
oh no no no as it happens
ive been called to berlin unexpectedly
i can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up
sorry for the inconvenience colonel
yes thank you
do you think he knows
well theres only one way to find out
weve been discovered
what makes you think that
osters been arrested
the gestapo came for him last night
the gestapo could have arrested him
for anything
what do you think went wrong
we dont know
fuse temperature altitude
all i know is the damn thing didnt go off
general tresckow to see colonel brandt
the colonels expecting you sir
at ease
youll forgive me general
this little roundup
has had me writing reports all day
roundup
dissenters
another plot against the führer
who are these people
youd be surprised
now is this what youve come for
perhaps we should open it
i beg your pardon
well youve come a long way
you must be thirsty
you know i wonder how the führer
who does not partake
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty
colonel brandt
i took you for another sort general
and i you
were still in business
find a replacement for oster
theres no one we can trust not in berlin
well then stop looking in berlin
countess von stauffenberg
perhaps before you go in we could have
a word together in my office
i will see my husband now
the right hand has been amputated
above the wrist
hes missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the left hand
we couldnt save the left eye
colonel
when youre ready sir
im a soldier i serve my country
but this is not my country
i was lying out there bleeding to death
thinking if i die now
i leave nothing to my children
but shame
i know now theres only one way
to serve germany
in doing so ill be a traitor i accept that
just tell me
can these men see it through
we need to reorganize
reconsider our strategy recruit new men
thats why we want you
you understand what will happen
to my wife and children
if these men cant see it through
come and hear what they have to say
you know where to find us
enough enough im not going to listen
to another word of this
you had your chance you failed
your socalled central solution
didnt work
our only option now
is to confront hitler openly
this is a military operation
its not a military operation
its a political organization
and one thats given its military arm
too much control
in any military exercise
you have to expect
a certain measure of deviation
a measure a measure
what about total complete utter failure
gentlemen i think its time
we face the fact
that the allies are coming sooner or later
i say we sit back
and let them wipe out the nazis
and ask every living soul in europe
to pay the price use your head
carl please
im sorry ludwig
ive held my tongue too long
we must confront hitler now
force him out
and then what
i beg your pardon
when hitler is gone then what
im sorry who is this man
colonel stauffenberg
is osters replacement
hes been transferred to my office
at the war ministry
hows your uncle
hes well sir he sends his regards
he speaks very highly of you
and of you general
of course one of the things
that made oster such a great organizer
was that he kept his opinions to himself
im simply asking what you intend to do
when hitler is gone
you dont really believe you could just
walk into the reich chancellery
and command the army to end the war
yes we do
you are in the presence of men
who would have been hitlers inner circle
instead we refused colonel
the people know we put our principles
above personal gain
we have the respect of the people
and the army
then you dont need me gentlemen
those men are confusing
respect with popularity
the army swore an oath
an oath that wont just die with hitler
what are you going to do
how are you going to deal with goebbels
himmler the ss
they will wipe you out
it doesnt matter
it only matters that we act now
before we lose the war
otherwise this will always be
hitlers germany
and we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him
that is not enough for me
there has to be a chance of success
then find a way
poppy
poppy
poppys home poppys home
poppys here poppys here
mommy hes here
mom come down
poppys here
i thought we agreed
id come see you in bamberg
the children couldnt wait
the children
super
valkyrie
weve already considered valkyrie
it isnt suitable
not as its currently written
but the colonel has an idea
i think we should consider
excuse me what is valkyrie
operation valkyrie
the reserve army has thousands of men
all over berlin
valkyrie is hitlers contingency plan
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency
the sole purpose of the order
is to protect hitlers government
if hes cut off or killed
and what use is this to us
valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest
but what if the ss were staging a coup
state security is trying
to overthrow hitler
how would high command respond
we would have no choice
we would declare
a military state of emergency
exactly and initiate valkyrie
hitlers own reserve army
using hitlers own plan
will have no choice but to seize power
in berlin to prevent the ss takeover
theyll think theyre fighting
for hitlers government not against it
while we quietly put
a new government in place
but only if hes dead
thats what youre saying isnt it
how else are you going to convince people
the ss are trying to seize power
we have to kill hitler
im disappointed in you colonel
i thought a man of your background
would suggest
a more honorable approach
your plan has a few
minor obstacles colonel
firstly valkyrie would have
to be rewritten to exclude the ss
then ill need your help to get a copy
rewriting an order is one thing
distributing it is another
in this case
wed be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason
evidence requiring hitlers signature
well we can all draw straws for that job
and what about fromm
fromm who is fromm
hes the commander of the reserve army
i can put the reserve troops on alert
but only fromm can initiate valkyrie
can you get to him
were running out of time
can you get to fromm
hes a careerist pig
but one whos gone as far as he can go
in hitlers army
its no secret hes not happy about it
offer him a key position
in the new regime
make him see the light
your office is through there
i have colonel stauffenberg
for general fromm
colonel stauffenberg sir
welcome back to the war ministry
its an honor sir
youre an old woman fromm
id send you to the front
if i didnt think youd surrender
just to be montgomerys whore
the general will see you now
what is it you want
i wanted to introduce our new man
colonel stauffenberg
from africa
i id offer you my hand
but i might not get it back
id say the general has lost
more important things this morning
its about time they put somebody
with balls into this office
please sit down colonel
and you olbricht if you must
they tell me youre critical
of the war colonel
not that you dont seem
to have good reason
i am critical of indecision general
in the field
in berlin
so thats why youre here i take it to
to make decisions
ive already made my decision
im here to help others make theirs
they say when theres no clear option
the best thing is to do nothing
were at war we must act
sometimes rashly
and what rash action
did you have in mind colonel
that would be a decision
for the supreme military commander sir
a supreme commander
second only to the chancellor
if i were that man
this war would be going quite differently
well we were thinking the same thing
i dont need to remind you
that weve all sworn an oath
to the führer
having said that im going to forget
this conversation ever took place
in the strict understanding
that such talk never occurs again
under this roof
is that clear
yes sir
now you can tell your friends colonel
that i always come down on the right side
and as long as the führer is alive
you know what side that is
heil hitler
heil hitler
heil hitler
of course yes very good guess
you realize how close i am to hitler
with one word i can make you disappear
my associates dont know
weve been talking
if thats what youre afraid of
when the ss catch you
they will pull you apart like warm bread
it will be a crime
just to have known you then
i warn you dont try to contact me again
you wont report me
maybe if you had
when i first approached you
you might have been keeping your oath
now youre just as guilty as the rest of us
and you think that makes me
a sympathizer hey
give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his führer
and you think his actions
will show you his heart
it is not that simple
yes yes it is
for the last time
dont push me to make a decision
i dont have a choice its clear now
without you there is no hope of success
youre nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship
what makes you think
youll be any different
what makes you think youre stronger
than the people the reich
the very momentum of history
this is going to happen
action is inevitable
as are the consequences
when they come for me
ill do everything i can
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it
but dont delude yourself
you were involved in a crime
against your country
long before you met me
there may still be time
to redeem yourself
only god can judge us now
hitler had operation valkyrie designed
to completely secure his government
in six hours
im rewriting the order so we can seize
control of the government in three
as written
the order spreads reserve troops
across all of germanys
19 military districts
including occupied cities
like paris vienna and prague
this is a waste of resources
since all of these districts follow
orders from berlin without question
you take berlin you take germany
im rewriting valkyrie
to direct the majority
of our strongest units
to focus entirely on berlin
well surround the government quarter
occupy all ss and police barracks
once we have control of the government
well shut down all concentration camps
any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot
ive been transferred to the front
anyway it doesnt matter
you know these orders
better than anyone
thats why im putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation
beck agrees
why not olbricht
no its your plan its you
one more thing
you need to be absolutely certain
no conflicting orders get out
after the flash
it is not enough to kill hitler
we need to isolate his chain of command
and cut them off
from the outside world immediately
yes ive already considered that
i think i have just the man who can help
who is he
perhaps its better i dont say
you know god promised abraham
he would not destroy sodom
if he could find just 10 righteous men
i have a feeling that for germany
it may come down to one
lets begin
the führer adolf hitler
is dead
heil hitler general
would you excuse us please thank you
you play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully
its the only time i get to relax
youve been promoted
chief of staff for the reserve army
excuse me
congratulations
i am busy with other things
unfortunately
your nocturnal activities
dont count as service to the reich
ill refuse the promotion
youll do no such thing
tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation
but in this world i still outrank you
you will accept the promotion
youll have real access to hitler
his advisers his schedule we need this
ive looked through your changes
to valkyrie
i approve
ill need you to get hitler to sign it
now theres a man here to interview
as your adjutant
he comes highly recommended
close the door
be seated
do you know
how this war will end lieutenant
the portrait will be unhung
and the man will be hung
im engaged in high treason
with all means available to me
can i count you in
for anything sir anything at all
come come come
colonel brandt operations
colonel stauffenberg id like to review
your presentation to the führer
strictly routine
sir the contents of the colonels bag
are for the führers eyes only
i am the führers eyes lieutenant
the colonel is a member of my staff
at the war ministry
he doesnt answer to you
theyre waiting
this way
my führer
may i present colonel stauffenberg
our new chief of staff
for the reserve army
heil my führer
may i say what an honor it is
to meet an officer
who has sacrificed so much for germany
if only more of my men were like you
let this man stand
as an example to all of you
he is the ideal german officer
my führer colonel stauffenberg
was asked to come here today
to brief us on mobilizing troops
of the reserve army to
to repel the invasion
invasion
at normandy my führer
oh yes
normandy
that will not be necessary
reichsmarschall göring assures me that
everything is completely under control
thank you colonel
my führer if i may
i have an amended copy
of operation valkyrie for your approval
you know your wagner colonel
the valkyrie handmaidens of the gods
choosing who will live and who will die
sparing the most heroic
from an agonizing death
one cannot understand national socialism
if one does not understand wagner
im sure whatever changes youve made
are for the best
youre dismissed send your man home
and fromm
have some fresh tea brought in will you
i dont know what youre brewing up
and i dont want to know
but when the music stops
id be obliged if keitel found himself
without a chair
any problem on earth can be solved
with the careful application
of high explosives
the trick is not to be around
when they go off
two 975gram packs of plastit w
enough explosive to cripple a panzer
your detonators your fuses
british time pencils
this acid capsule is your trigger
when youre ready to arm
attach the detonator to the bottom
of the time pencil like so
insert the entire device
into either end of the plastit w
crush the acid capsule and youre live
when the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin
well youll want to be very far away
for you
how much time will we have
theoretically theres a 30minute delay
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the wolfs lair
id give you 10 15 minutes tops
thats hardly precise
this is stateoftheart
you can have small or precise not both
might this just be a little too small
no hitlers bunker will magnify the blast
it is constructed of reinforced concrete
steel door no windows
the air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that
will kill everyone instantly
the second charge
will be entirely redundant
if by some miracle
hitler does survive what then
we still initiate valkyrie
at that point
there will be no turning back
but well have an advantage
we have an inside man at the wolfs lair
after the flash hell cut off communication
with the outside world
while hitlers inner circle
is struggling to regroup
well have the momentum we need
to seize control in berlin
himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well
dont proceed
unless you can get them both
what
dont proceed unless youre confident
you can get both himmler and hitler
this is goerdeler isnt it
ill hold off if the decision is unanimous
but i want another man on the committee
not a politician
who
him
him
him
fine
but remember this is a military operation
nothing ever goes according to plan
ill take the children to bamberg
if i fail
theyll come for you
all of you
i know
gentlemen good morning
hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today at 100
stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present
theyre here
before arming the explosives
stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed
after the flash his inside man
will sever all communications
assuming fromm refuses to join us
olbricht would take command
of the reserve army
and initiate valkyrie
initiate valkyrie
then hell notify all district commanders
that the ss is attempting to seize power
the reserve army will arrest all ss
gestapo and nazi officials
by then stauffenberg
will have returned to berlin
and taken command of the reserve army
witzleben and i will assume the roles
of commander of the armed forces
and head of state
with berlin secured
dr goerdeler will address the nation
as our new chancellor
then god willing
we can negotiate a truce with the allies
and save europe from total destruction
this will identify you
as a member of the operation
nobody gets in or out of the perimeter
without one
gentlemen this is the most important day
of your lives
long live sacred germany
captain
what is it
an order from general olbrichts office
its calling the reserve army
for some sort of standby action
in all the military districts
including berlin
looks like a drill of some kind
send it through sergeant
sir
standby action what the hell for
the order doesnt say
assemble the men
this better not be a drill
the men are assembled
and awaiting further orders
what do you suppose
this is really all about
your man
he is now
colonel
attention
gentlemen for our first order of business
general fromm will present his plans
for the reallocation of troops from
the reserve army on the eastern front
now as you know last night
the russians launched a new offensive
against army group north ukraine
in the south poland section
general harpe was brought in
to replace model
and bring a swift end to this confrontation
himmler is not here
hence the transfer of three divisions
to fortify general harpes troops
now these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan
rather than holding any one particular
yes sir ill put that right through
connecting now
operator
direct me to the war ministry
general olbrichts office
one moment please
yes sir connecting now
general olbrichts office
himmlers not in the briefing
im ready to arm permission to proceed
hold the line
stauffenberg says himmlers not
at the briefing he wants to proceed
call beck
beck
himmler is not at the briefing
himmlers not at the briefing
already diminished reserves
no
they say no
what do you say
i say do it
attention
whatever it was colonel
i hope it was important
colonel your bag
this has been a drill youre dismissed
how dare you put the reserve army
on standby without my knowledge
damn near cost me my commission
and what in gods name made you think
you even had the authority
it was only a drill an exercise
dont lie olbricht not to me
we both know it wasnt a drill
general if i may
no you may not colonel
you may not do anything
because not only have you proved to me
you cant deliver
youve painted a target on my back
if i so much as sense you trying
to move the reserve army again
i will personally have you both arrested
do i make myself abundantly clear
yes sir
yes sir
heil hitler
heil hitler
ill hear you say it colonel
heil hitler
the point of replacing hitler
is to negotiate a truce with the allies
the allies i suspect
would be more amenable to a truce
if we offer it to them
before they get to fucking berlin
theres no point in killing hitler
unless you kill himmler too
why remove a madman
just to have a lunatic take his place
todays failure had nothing to do
with himmler and you know it
this is a military operation
in the hands of a politician nothing more
what are you suggesting
im not suggesting anything
im stating the facts as i see them
you dont have the courage to kill hitler
so you are making the task impossible
nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own
my only regret is that i waited for you
to find your backbone
i dont think im alone
when i say your judgment is in question
id like to call a vote
carl
i propose
that we relieve colonel stauffenberg
carl can i have a word with you
in private
no ludwig
if youve got something to say say it
very well i heard from the chief of police
this evening
that himmler has issued a warrant
for your arrest
you have to leave germany tonight
when we succeed
with the central solution
youll return as chancellor
disappear carl
avoid contact with anyone
good luck colonel
no more indecision
from now on
stauffenberg has full discretion
i cant issue the alert again
unless we follow through
ill do my job you just take berlin
hold on sir
ill try to connect you right now
thank you
hello
hello
hello
hello
im sorry sir there is bombing in ebingen
weve been disconnected
ebingen is a long way from bamberg
im sure your family is safe
thank you
welcome colonel
do you have a place
where i could change major
please follow me
at least put the reserve army
on standby alert
not until ive heard from stauffenberg
not until im sure
but thats not what he
noted colonel thank you
the meeting has been moved up to 1230
mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train
the führer wants to have lunch with him
yes sir
will mussolini be joining us
in the briefing sir
i only wish he were
then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity
to shoot that dago bastard
excuse me general
im expecting an important call
could you please have someone come
and get me
even if im with the führer
of course colonel
thank you sir
colonel
major freyend speaking
colonel they insist you hurry
the briefings about to begin
one moment please major
ten minutes
two for the walk one for the checkpoint
one for the bunker six to get out
plenty of time
excuse me colonel
sir the führers at the briefing
the colonel is changing major
you understand this can be difficult
of course
plenty of time
get the car
but sir
i have everything i need get the car
i can manage this
where are they going
its too hot
the briefing has been moved
to the conference hut
major my injuries
have left me hard of hearing
would you place me
as close to the führer as possible
ill see what i can do
against the red army
not only have they been advancing
from the east
but theyre coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well
as you can see my führer
if the enemy continues at this rate
the situation in the east prussian sector
is critical
lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units
and reserves are severely depleted
my führer
you remember colonel stauffenberg
as you are all aware
in the past two days alone
the 10th army has given up ancona
the 14th division has been pushed
out of livorno
army group center has already lost
28 of their 40 divisions
that is a total of almost 350000 men
since the red army first attacked
nearly a month ago
our troops have already been pushed back
to the polish border
conference hut
this compounded with the loss
of the 4th army in minsk
threatens the entire eastern perimeter
yes sir
we must consider pulling men
from army group north ukraine
as well as the romanian
and prevent further losses
unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions
at vital points along the german right
army group will be swallowed by the enemies
colonel theres a telephone call for you
in less than a fortnight
and we run the risk of losing
all the ground we have managed to gain
in the last three years our spearhead
general fellgiebel sir he says its urgent
yes general this is stauffenberg
russian air activity has proven just
as impregnable as their ground force
why
my führer
in some areas
they outnumber us seven to one
if we can afford to give ground
along the italian front i further
one thing is certain
the red army will continue
an aggressive push west
even at the expense
in order to rebuild at this
already southwest of dünaburg
and closing on army group at lake peipus
if they are not immediately withdrawn
it will be a catastrophe
get in drive
i have orders from the führer drive
drive drive
as you were
get me the war ministry
general olbricht olbricht
the call is urgent
general olbrichts office
im calling from the wolfs lair
with an urgent message
for general olbricht
something terrible has happened
the führer is
fellgiebel
sever all communications
sir
just do it
well what did he say
i couldnt be sure
well get him back on the line
sir the bomb did go off
that much was clear
fellgiebels next step will be
to sever all communications
sorry colonel no one gets in or out
we have an order from the führer
we have to get to the airfield immediately
open the gate
im very sorry sir
but my orders are to keep the gate
i just gave you an order sergeant
sir
sir excuse me
colonel stauffenberg
for field marshal keitel
colonel stauffenberg was explicit
we initiate valkyrie regardless
only fromm can initiate you know that
then tell him hitlers dead
or arrest him but do it now
sir you have to give the order
to initiate valkyrie this is our only
im not doing anything
until i hear from fellgiebel
get him back on the phone now
every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost
the risk is too great
what about stauffenberg
what about his risk
he did his part
and now youre abandoning him
field marshal sir stauffenberg here
a sergeant
kolbe sir
what
kolbe
kolbe wont let me pass the main gate
yes sir i explained that
perhaps you can
make him understand sir
everythings fine now sir thank you
open the gate
at least put the reserve army on alert
when stauffenberg returns
when he gives me confirmation
that hitler is dead then well proceed
and where are you going
the same place as you are lunch
another standby alert
send it through but keep me informed
sir another standby order
in ancient greece
you would have been killed for this
lucky for you weve evolved
assemble the men
quiet isnt it
ill see where our driver is
this is von haeften
the colonel and i are at the airfield
theres no car theres no one here
you mean to tell me
the alerts only just gone out
this is stauffenberg
get me general olbricht
whats this
explain this
someone had to do something
while you were playing dead
we dont know that hitler is not alive
this is about germany for gods sake
not you
general olbrichts office
colonel stauffenberg for you sir
this is olbricht
its been three hours olbricht
what the hell have you been doing
weve had no confirmation
that hitler was dead
damn it i saw the explosion myself
we are committed
dear god
now where is fromm is he with us
is he with us
no one has spoken to him yet
you listen to me never mind germany
never mind europe
your life is at stake now
and if you want to live through the night
youll do exactly as i say
the second you hang up the phone
initiate valkyrie in fromms name
give him the choice to join us
or place him under immediate arrest
do you understand
yes
ill be in fromms office in 15 minutes
be there when i arrive
call beck and the others
tell them its time
put me through to communications
this is general olbricht
calling on behalf of general fromm
commander of the reserve army
the führer adolf hitler is dead
a group of radicals in the ss
are attempting to seize control
of the government
initiate operation valkyrie
you have your orders pass them along
battalion attention
the führer
our führer adolf hitler
is dead
who told you the führer was dead
general fellgiebel at the wolfs lair
theres no use calling
all communication lines are down
yes get me the wolfs lair
one moment sir
wolfs lair may i connect you
yes general fromm
for field marshal keitel urgent
keitel
yes im sorry to disturb you sir
but i wonder if you could tell me
whats happening
the most incredible rumors
are circulating in berlin
i dont know what you mean
theres talk
that the führer has been assassinated
another failed attempt
the führer was never in danger
by the way
wheres your man stauffenberg
stauffenberg he
on his way back to berlin i would think
let me know when he arrives
id like a word with him
the führers fine
that is a lie adolf hitlers dead
operation valkyrie is in effect
only i can initiate valkyrie
you did
this is treason
right now the reserve armys
assuming control of berlin
are you with us or not
do you realize what youve done
the führer is alive

noted major
id like a pistol please

that will be all major
killing us wont hide your involvement
my involvement
i dont know what youre talking about
you knew and did nothing
youre as guilty as any of us
spare me lieutenant
no one will be spared
im thinking of earlier times
this is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here
a field marshal and a general declare
that they could do things better
than he who is the führer of us all
you confess to having said this
yes
my fellow germans
i speak to you tonight for two reasons
first so that you can hear my voice
and know that i am unhurt
second so that you may know
the details of a crime
without parallel in german history
a small clique of ambitious
dishonorable officers
have conspired to eliminate me
except for a few bruises and burns
i was completely untouched
i see in this the hand of providence
directing me to complete my work
look them in the eye
theyll remember you
olbricht
make ready
well we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him
safe stand
fire
stand
stauffenberg
the people know we put our principles
above personal gain
make ready
aim
safe stand
you may hand us over to the executioner
but in three months time
the disgusted and harried people
will bring you to book
and drag you alive
through the dirt in the streets
take him away
