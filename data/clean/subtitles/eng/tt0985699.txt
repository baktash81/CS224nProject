the outrages committed by hitler s ss are
a stain on the honor of the german army 
there is widespread disgust
in the officer corps   
toward the crimes committed
by the nazis   
the murder of civilians   
the torture and starvation of prisoners   
    the mass execution of jews 
my duty as an officer is no longer
to save my country 
but to save human lives 
i cannot find one general
in a position to confront hitler
with the courage to do it 
colonel stauffenberg  sir 
the general will be here in four hours 
thank you 
i ll need to see him when he arrives 
i find myself surrounded by men
unwilling or unable to face the truth 
hitler is not only
the archenemy of the entire world
but the archenemy of germany 
a change must be made 
colonel  my orders are to advance
to sidi mansour and hold it 
that s what we ll do 
the british are moving up from the south 
patton is closing in on the coast 
you know 
we should have left two days ago 
no  colonel 
we keep fighting until the final victory 
north africa s lost  and you re going to
need these men a year from now
to defend berlin 
we can serve germany or the f端hrer 
not both 
it s just that sort of talk
that had you sent here  colonel 
what i said was much worse 
general 
i m just trying
to get these men out of here alive 
  what would you have me do 
  tell command we re low on water 
we d have to reroute to mezzouna 
join the 21st panzer 
at least then we d have a chance 
and the records will show that we didn t
have enough water to reach sidi mansour 
i can guarantee it 
see that it s done 
general 
up 
down 
  hitler s leaving 
  now 
ja  fuse 
colonel brandt  colonel brandt 
my regards to colonel stieff 
cointreau 
let s hope i don t get thirsty on the flight 
this is tresckow 
he s landed 
this is general tresckow 
connect me with operations 
colonel brandt 
colonel  tresckow 
i m glad you arrived safely 
i hate to trouble you 
but it seems you have the wrong bottles
for colonel stieff 
you do still have the package 
oh  no  no  no  as it happens 
i ve been called to berlin unexpectedly 
i can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up 
sorry for the inconvenience  colonel 
yes  thank you 
do you think he knows 
well  there s only one way to find out 
  we ve been discovered 
  what makes you think that 
oster s been arrested 
the gestapo came for him last night 
the gestapo could have arrested him
for anything 
  what do you think went wrong 
  we don t know 
fuse  temperature  altitude 
all i know is the damn thing didn t go off 
  general tresckow to see colonel brandt 
  the colonel s expecting you  sir 
at ease 
you ll forgive me  general 
this little roundup
has had me writing reports all day 
  roundup 
  dissenters 
  another plot against the f端hrer 
  who are these people 
you d be surprised 
now  is this what you ve come for 
perhaps we should open it 
i beg your pardon 
well  you ve come a long way 
you must be thirsty 
you know  i wonder how the f端hrer 
who does not partake 
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty 
colonel brandt 
i took you for another sort  general 
and i you 
we re still in business 
find a replacement for oster 
there s no one we can trust  not in berlin 
well  then stop looking in berlin 
countess von stauffenberg 
perhaps before you go in  we could have
a word together in my office 
i will see my husband now 
the right hand has been amputated
above the wrist 
he s missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the left hand 
we couldn t save the left eye 
colonel 
when you re ready  sir 
i m a soldier  i serve my country 
but this is not my country 
i was lying out there bleeding to death 
thinking   if i die now 
 i leave nothing to my children
but shame   
i know now there s only one way
to serve germany 
in doing so  i ll be a traitor  i accept that 
just tell me 
can these men see it through 
we need to reorganize 
reconsider our strategy  recruit new men 
that s why we want you 
you understand what will happen
to my wife and children
if these men can t see it through 
come and hear what they have to say 
you know where to find us 
enough  enough  i m not going to listen
to another word of this 
you had your chance  you failed 
your so called  central solution 
didn t work 
our only option now
is to confront hitler openly 
this is a military operation   
it s not a military operation 
it s a political organization 
and one that s given its military arm
too much control 
in any military exercise 
you have to expect
a certain measure of deviation 
a measure  a measure 
what about total  complete  utter failure 
gentlemen  i think it s time
we face the fact
that the allies are coming  sooner or later 
i say we sit back
and let them wipe out the nazis 
and ask every living soul in europe
to pay the price  use your head 
  carl  please 
  i m sorry  ludwig 
i ve held my tongue too long 
we must confront hitler now 
force him out 
and then what 
i beg your pardon 
when hitler is gone  then what 
i m sorry  who is this man 
colonel stauffenberg
is oster s replacement 
he s been transferred to my office
at the war ministry 
  how s your uncle 
  he s well  sir  he sends his regards 
  he speaks very highly of you 
  and of you  general 
of course  one of the things
that made oster such a great organizer
was that he kept his opinions to himself 
i m simply asking what you intend to do
when hitler is gone 
you don t really believe you could just
walk into the reich chancellery
and command the army to end the war 
yes  we do 
you are in the presence of men
who would have been hitler s inner circle 
instead  we refused  colonel 
the people know we put our principles
above personal gain 
we have the respect of the people 
and the army 
then you don t need me  gentlemen 
those men are confusing
respect with popularity 
the army swore an oath 
an oath that won t just die with hitler 
what are you going to do 
how are you going to deal with goebbels 
himmler  the ss 
  they will wipe you out 
  it doesn t matter 
it only matters that we act  now 
before we lose the war 
otherwise  this will always be
hitler s germany 
and we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him 
that is not enough for me 
there has to be a chance of success 
then find a way 
  poppy 
  poppy 
  poppy s home  poppy s home 
  poppy s here  poppy s here 
mommy  he s here 
  mom  come down 
  poppy s here 
i thought we agreed
i d come see you in bamberg 
  the children couldn t wait 
  the children 
super 
valkyrie 
we ve already considered valkyrie 
it isn t suitable 
not as it s currently written 
but the colonel has an idea
  i think we should consider 
  excuse me  what is valkyrie 
operation valkyrie 
the reserve army has thousands of men
all over berlin 
valkyrie is hitler s contingency plan
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency 
the sole purpose of the order
is to protect hitler s government
  if he s cut off or killed 
  and what use is this to us 
valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest 
but what if the ss were staging a coup 
state security is trying
to overthrow hitler 
  how would high command respond 
  we would have no choice 
we would declare
a military state of emergency 
exactly  and initiate valkyrie 
hitler s own reserve army 
using hitler s own plan 
will have no choice but to seize power
in berlin to prevent the ss takeover 
they ll think they re fighting
for hitler s government  not against it 
while we quietly put
a new government in place 
but only if he s dead 
that s what you re saying  isn t it 
how else are you going to convince people
the ss are trying to seize power 
we have to kill hitler 
i m disappointed in you  colonel 
i thought a man of your background
would suggest
a more honorable approach 
your plan has a few
minor obstacles  colonel 
firstly  valkyrie would have
to be rewritten to exclude the ss 
then i ll need your help to get a copy 
rewriting an order is one thing 
distributing it is another 
in this case 
we d be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason 
evidence requiring hitler s signature 
well  we can all draw straws for that job 
  and what about fromm 
  fromm  who is fromm 
he s the commander of the reserve army 
i can put the reserve troops on alert 
but only fromm can initiate valkyrie 
can you get to him 
we re running out of time 
can you get to fromm 
he s a careerist pig 
but one who s gone as far as he can go
in hitler s army 
it s no secret he s not happy about it 
offer him a key position
in the new regime 
make him see the light 
your office is through there 
i have colonel stauffenberg
for general fromm 
colonel stauffenberg  sir 
welcome back to the war ministry 
  it s an honor  sir 
  you re an old woman  fromm 
i d send you to the front
if i didn t think you d surrender
just to be montgomery s whore 
the general will see you now 
what is it you want 
i wanted to introduce our new man 
colonel stauffenberg 
from africa 
i    i d offer you my hand 
but i might not get it back 
i d say the general has lost
more important things this morning 
it s about time they put somebody
with balls into this office 
please  sit down  colonel 
and you  olbricht  if you must 
they tell me you re critical
of the war  colonel 
not that you don t seem
to have good reason 
i am critical of indecision  general 
  in the field 
  in berlin 
so that s why you re here  i take it  to   
  to make decisions 
  i ve already made my decision 
i m here to help others make theirs 
they say when there s no clear option 
  the best thing is to do nothing 
  we re at war  we must act 
sometimes rashly 
and what rash action
did you have in mind  colonel 
that would be a decision
for the supreme military commander  sir 
a supreme commander 
second only to the chancellor 
if i were that man 
this war would be going quite differently 
well  we were thinking the same thing 
i don t need to remind you
that we ve all sworn an oath
to the f端hrer 
having said that  i m going to forget
this conversation ever took place 
in the strict understanding
that such talk never occurs again
under this roof 
  is that clear 
  yes  sir 
now  you can tell your friends  colonel 
that i always come down on the right side 
and as long as the f端hrer is alive 
you know what side that is 
heil hitler 
  heil hitler 
  heil hitler 
of course  yes  very good guess 
you realize how close i am to hitler 
with one word i can make you disappear 
my associates don t know
we ve been talking 
  if that s what you re afraid of 
  when the ss catch you 
they will pull you apart like warm bread 
it will be a crime
just to have known you then 
i warn you  don t try to contact me again 
you won t report me 
maybe if you had
when i first approached you 
you might have been keeping your oath 
now you re just as guilty as the rest of us 
and you think that makes me
a sympathizer  hey 
give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his f端hrer
and you think his actions
will show you his heart 
  it is not that simple 
  yes  yes  it is 
for the last time 
don t push me to make a decision 
i don t have a choice  it s clear now 
without you  there is no hope of success 
you re nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship 
what makes you think
you ll be any different 
what makes you think you re stronger
than the people  the reich 
  the very momentum of history 
  this is going to happen 
action is inevitable 
as are the consequences 
when they come for me 
i ll do everything i can
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it 
but don t delude yourself 
you were involved in a crime
against your country
long before you met me 
there may still be time
to redeem yourself 
only god can judge us now 
hitler had operation valkyrie designed
to completely secure his government
in six hours 
i m rewriting the order so we can seize
control of the government in three 
as written 
the order spreads reserve troops
across all of germany s
19 military districts 
including occupied cities
like paris  vienna and prague 
this is a waste of resources 
since all of these districts follow
orders from berlin without question 
you take berlin  you take germany 
i m rewriting valkyrie
to direct the majority
of our strongest units
to focus entirely on berlin 
we ll surround the government quarter 
occupy all ss and police barracks 
once we have control of the government 
we ll shut down all concentration camps 
any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot 
i ve been transferred to the front 
anyway  it doesn t matter 
you know these orders
better than anyone 
that s why i m putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation 
  beck agrees 
  why not olbricht 
no  it s your plan  it s you 
one more thing 
you need to be absolutely certain
no conflicting orders get out
after the flash 
it is not enough to kill hitler 
we need to isolate his chain of command
and cut them off
from the outside world immediately 
yes  i ve already considered that 
i think i have just the man who can help 
  who is he 
  perhaps it s better i don t say 
you know  god promised abraham
he would not destroy sodom
if he could find just 10 righteous men 
i have a feeling that  for germany 
it may come down to one 
let s begin 
 the f端hrer  adolf hitler 
 is dead  
heil hitler  general 
would you excuse us  please  thank you 
you play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully 
it s the only time i get to relax 
you ve been promoted
chief of staff for the reserve army 
  excuse me 
  congratulations 
  i am busy with other things 
  unfortunately 
your nocturnal activities
don t count as service to the reich 
  i ll refuse the promotion 
  you ll do no such thing 
tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation 
but in this world i still outrank you 
you will accept the promotion 
you ll have real access to hitler 
his advisers  his schedule  we need this 
i ve looked through your changes
to valkyrie 
i approve 
i ll need you to get hitler to sign it 
now  there s a man here to interview
as your adjutant 
he comes highly recommended 
close the door 
be seated 
do you know
how this war will end  lieutenant 
the portrait will be unhung 
and the man will be hung 
i m engaged in high treason
with all means available to me 
can i count you in 
for anything  sir  anything at all 
come  come  come 
colonel brandt  operations 
colonel stauffenberg  i d like to review
your presentation to the f端hrer 
strictly routine 
sir  the contents of the colonel s bag
are for the f端hrer s eyes only 
i am the f端hrer s eyes  lieutenant 
the colonel is a member of my staff
at the war ministry 
he doesn t answer to you 
  they re waiting 
  this way 
my f端hrer 
may i present colonel stauffenberg 
our new chief of staff
for the reserve army 
heil  my f端hrer 
may i say what an honor it is
to meet an officer
who has sacrificed so much for germany 
if only more of my men were like you 
let this man stand
as an example to all of you 
he is the ideal german officer 
my f端hrer  colonel stauffenberg
was asked to come here today
to brief us on mobilizing troops
of the reserve army to   
to repel the invasion 
invasion 
at normandy  my f端hrer 
oh  yes 
normandy 
that will not be necessary 
reichsmarschall g旦ring assures me that
everything is completely under control 
thank you  colonel 
my f端hrer  if i may 
i have an amended copy
of operation valkyrie for your approval 
you know your wagner  colonel 
the valkyrie  handmaidens of the gods 
choosing who will live and who will die 
sparing the most heroic
from an agonizing death 
one cannot understand national socialism
if one does not understand wagner 
i m sure whatever changes you ve made
are for the best 
you re dismissed  send your man home 
and  fromm 
have some fresh tea brought in  will you 
i don t know what you re brewing up 
and i don t want to know 
but when the music stops 
i d be obliged if keitel found himself
without a chair 
any problem on earth can be solved
with the careful application
of high explosives 
the trick is not to be around
when they go off 
two 975 gram packs of plastit w 
enough explosive to cripple a panzer 
your detonators  your fuses 
british time pencils 
this acid capsule is your trigger 
when you re ready to arm 
attach the detonator to the bottom
of the time pencil  like so 
insert the entire device
into either end of the plastit w 
crush the acid capsule  and you re live 
when the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin 
well  you ll want to be very far away 
for you 
  how much time will we have 
  theoretically there s a 30 minute delay 
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the wolf s lair 
i d give you 10  15 minutes  tops 
that s hardly precise 
this is state of the art 
you can have small or precise  not both 
might this just be a little too small 
no  hitler s bunker will magnify the blast 
it is constructed of reinforced concrete 
steel door  no windows 
the air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that
will kill everyone instantly 
the second charge
will be entirely redundant 
if  by some miracle 
hitler does survive  what then 
we still initiate valkyrie 
at that point 
there will be no turning back 
but we ll have an advantage 
we have an inside man at the wolf s lair 
after the flash  he ll cut off communication
with the outside world 
while hitler s inner circle
is struggling to regroup 
we ll have the momentum we need
to seize control in berlin 
himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well 
don t proceed
unless you can get them both 
what 
don t proceed unless you re confident
you can get both himmler and hitler 
this is goerdeler  isn t it 
i ll hold off  if the decision is unanimous 
but i want another man on the committee 
not a politician 
  who 
  him 
  him 
  him 
fine 
but remember  this is a military operation 
nothing ever goes according to plan 
i ll take the children to bamberg 
if i fail 
they ll come for you 
all of you 
i know 
gentlemen  good morning 
hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today at 1 00 
stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present 
  they re here 
  before arming the explosives 
stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed 
after the flash  his inside man
will sever all communications 
assuming fromm refuses to join us 
olbricht would take command
of the reserve army
  and initiate valkyrie 
  initiate valkyrie 
then he ll notify all district commanders
that the ss is attempting to seize power 
the reserve army will arrest all ss 
gestapo and nazi officials 
by then  stauffenberg
will have returned to berlin
and taken command of the reserve army 
witzleben and i will assume the roles
of commander of the armed forces
and head of state 
with berlin secured 
dr  goerdeler will address the nation
as our new chancellor 
then  god willing 
we can negotiate a truce with the allies
and save europe from total destruction 
this will identify you
as a member of the operation 
nobody gets in or out of the perimeter
without one 
gentlemen  this is the most important day
of your lives 
long live sacred germany 
  captain 
  what is it 
an order from general olbricht s office 
it s calling the reserve army
for some sort of standby action
in all the military districts 
including berlin 
looks like a drill of some kind 
send it through  sergeant 
sir 
   standby action   what the hell for 
  the order doesn t say 
assemble the men 
this better not be a drill 
the men are assembled
and awaiting further orders 
what do you suppose
this is really all about 
your man 
he is now 
colonel 
attention 
gentlemen  for our first order of business 
general fromm will present his plans
for the reallocation of troops from
the reserve army on the eastern front 
now  as you know  last night
the russians launched a new offensive
against army group north ukraine
in the south poland section 
general harpe was brought in
to replace model
and bring a swift end to this confrontation 
  himmler is not here 
  hence the transfer of three divisions
to fortify general harpe s troops 
now  these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan
rather than holding any one particular   
yes  sir  i ll put that right through 
connecting now 
  operator 
  direct me to the war ministry 
  general olbricht s office 
  one moment  please 
yes  sir  connecting now 
  general olbricht s office 
  himmler s not in the briefing 
i m ready to arm  permission to proceed 
hold the line 
stauffenberg says himmler s not
at the briefing  he wants to proceed 
call beck 
  beck 
  himmler is not at the briefing 
himmler s not at the briefing 
   already diminished reserves 
no 
they say no 
what do you say 
i say do it 
attention 
whatever it was  colonel 
i hope it was important 
colonel  your bag 
this has been a drill  you re dismissed 
how dare you put the reserve army
on standby without my knowledge 
damn near cost me my commission 
and what in god s name made you think
you even had the authority 
  it was only a drill  an exercise 
  don t lie  olbricht  not to me 
we both know it wasn t a drill 
  general  if i may   
  no  you may not  colonel 
you may not do anything 
because not only have you proved to me
you can t deliver 
you ve painted a target on my back 
if i so much as sense you trying
to move the reserve army again 
i will personally have you both arrested 
do i make myself abundantly clear 
  yes  sir 
  yes  sir 
  heil hitler 
  heil hitler 
i ll hear you say it  colonel 
heil hitler 
the point of replacing hitler
is to negotiate a truce with the allies 
the allies  i suspect 
would be more amenable to a truce
if we offer it to them
before they get to fucking berlin 
there s no point in killing hitler
unless you kill himmler  too 
why remove a madman
just to have a lunatic take his place 
today s failure had nothing to do
with himmler  and you know it 
this is a military operation
in the hands of a politician  nothing more 
  what are you suggesting 
  i m not suggesting anything 
i m stating the facts as i see them 
you don t have the courage to kill hitler 
so you are making the task impossible 
nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own 
my only regret is that i waited for you
to find your backbone 
i don t think i m alone
when i say your judgment is in question 
  i d like to call a vote 
  carl 
i propose
that we relieve colonel stauffenberg 
carl  can i have a word with you
in private 
no  ludwig 
if you ve got something to say  say it 
very well  i heard from the chief of police
this evening
that himmler has issued a warrant
for your arrest 
you have to leave germany tonight 
when we succeed
with the central solution 
you ll return as chancellor 
disappear  carl 
avoid contact with anyone 
good luck  colonel 
no more indecision 
from now on 
stauffenberg has full discretion 
i can t issue the alert again
unless we follow through 
i ll do my job  you just take berlin 
hold on  sir 
i ll try to connect you right now 
thank you 
  hello 
  hello 
hello 
hello 
i m sorry  sir  there is bombing in ebingen 
we ve been disconnected 
ebingen is a long way from bamberg 
i m sure your family is safe 
thank you 
welcome  colonel 
do you have a place
where i could change  major 
please follow me 
at least put the reserve army
on standby alert 
not until i ve heard from stauffenberg 
not until i m sure 
  but that s not what he   
  noted  colonel  thank you 
the meeting has been moved up to 12 30 
mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train 
  the f端hrer wants to have lunch with him 
  yes  sir 
will mussolini be joining us
in the briefing  sir 
i only wish he were 
then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity
to shoot that dago bastard 
excuse me  general 
i m expecting an important call 
could you please have someone come
and get me 
even if i m with the f端hrer 
  of course  colonel 
  thank you  sir 
colonel 
major freyend speaking 
colonel  they insist you hurry 
the briefing s about to begin 
one moment  please  major 
ten minutes 
two for the walk  one for the checkpoint 
one for the bunker  six to get out 
plenty of time 
excuse me  colonel 
sir  the f端hrer s at the briefing 
the colonel is changing  major 
  you understand this can be difficult 
  of course 
plenty of time 
  get the car 
  but  sir   
i have everything i need  get the car 
i can manage this 
  where are they going 
  it s too hot 
the briefing has been moved
to the conference hut 
major  my injuries
have left me hard of hearing 
would you place me
as close to the f端hrer as possible 
  i ll see what i can do 
     against the red army 
not only have they been advancing
from the east 
but they re coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well 
as you can see  my f端hrer 
if the enemy continues at this rate 
the situation in the east prussian sector
is critical 
lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units 
and reserves are severely depleted 
my f端hrer 
you remember colonel stauffenberg 
as you are all aware 
in the past two days alone 
the 10th army has given up ancona 
the 14th division has been pushed
out of livorno 
army group center has already lost
28 of their 40 divisions 
that is a total of almost 350 000 men 
since the red army first attacked
nearly a month ago 
our troops have already been pushed back
to the polish border 
conference hut 
this  compounded with the loss
of the 4th army in minsk 
  threatens the entire eastern perimeter 
  yes  sir 
we must consider pulling men
from army group north ukraine 
as well as the romanian   
   and prevent further losses 
unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions
at vital points along the german right 
  army group will be swallowed by the enemies   
  colonel  there s a telephone call for you 
     in less than a fortnight 
and we run the risk of losing
all the ground we have managed to gain
in the last three years  our spearhead   
general fellgiebel  sir  he says it s urgent 
yes  general  this is stauffenberg 
   russian air activity has proven just
as impregnable as their ground force 
  why 
  my f端hrer   
in some areas
they outnumber us seven to one 
if we can afford to give ground
along the italian front  i further   
one thing is certain 
the red army will continue
an aggressive push west 
even at the expense   
in order to rebuild at this   
   already southwest of d端naburg
and closing on army group at lake peipus 
if they are not immediately withdrawn 
it will be a catastrophe

that the f端hrer has been assassinated 
another failed attempt 
the f端hrer was never in danger 
by the way 
where s your man stauffenberg 
stauffenberg  he

i d like a word with him 
  the f端hrer s fine 
  that is a lie  adolf hitler s dead 
  operation valkyrie is in effect 
  only i can initiate valkyrie

this is treason 
right now  the reserve army s
assuming control of berlin 
are you with us or not 
do you realize what you ve done 
  the f端hrer is alive 
  i delivered the bomb myself 
i saw the blast  he is dead 
  are you with us 
  i don t believe this is happening 
  this is some kind of a joke 
  are you with us or not 
colonel  if what you say is true 
you should shoot yourself immediately 
  the rest of you are under arrest 
  no  general  you are 
i don t know where you think this is going

seal off the war ministry
per operation valkyrie

  colonel stauffenberg 
  yes

the full support of the berlin police 
you will have no interference

injuries beyond light burns and bruises 
  i m sorry 
  he resumed his work immediately 
those seriously wounded
include general schmundt 
colonel brandt and staff assistant berger 
lighter injuries were sustained
by general jodl
and generals korten  buhle 
bodenschatz  heusinger   
shortly after the attempt on his life 
the f端hrer was joined
by reichsmarschall g旦ring
and  as scheduled  received mussolini
for an afternoon briefing 
stay tuned for the f端hrer s address
to the german people 
my family 
our lines have been cut 
  i m sorry

general  sir 
we have to get you out of here

colonel mertz von quirnheim 
general olbricht  lieutenant haeften 
and the colonel

noted  major 
i d like a pistol  please 
for personal reasons 
get on with it 
  with all respect   
  that will be all  major 
killing us won t hide your involvement 
my involvement 
i don t know what you re talking about 
  you knew and did nothing 
  you re as guilty as any of us 
  spare me  lieutenant 
  no one will be spared 
i m thinking of earlier times 
this is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here 
a field marshal and a general declare
that they could do things better
than he who is the f端hrer of us all 
  you confess to having said this 
  yes 
my fellow germans 
i speak to you tonight for two reasons 
first  so that you can hear my voice
and know that i am unhurt 
second  so that you may know
the details of a crime
without parallel in german history 
a small clique of ambitious 
dishonorable officers
have conspired to eliminate me 
except for a few bruises and burns 
i was completely untouched 
i see in this the hand of providence 
directing me to complete my work 
look them in the eye 
they ll remember you 
olbricht 
make ready 
well  we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him 
safe  stand 
fire 
stand 
stauffenberg 
the people know we put our principles
above personal gain 
make ready 
aim 
safe  stand 
you may hand us over to the executioner 
but in three months  time 
the disgusted and harried people
will bring you to book
and drag you alive
through the dirt in the streets 
take him away
