their controls would freeze up
their planes would buffet wildly
and they would disintegrate
the demon lived at mach 1 on the meter
750 miles an hour
where the air could no longer
move out of the way
he lived behind a barrier through
which they said no man could ever pass
they called it the sound barrier
then they built a small plane
the x1 to try and break
the sound barrier
and men came to the high desert
of california to ride it
they were called test pilots
and no one knew their names
okay whiskey kilo 28 prepare to drop
roger ground control
this is whiskey kilo 28
lowering and launching now
mach92
hit a mild buffet there
mach95
wk 28 do you want
to declare an emergency
negative wk 28 is not
go away
lord guard and guide
the men who fly
through the great spaces
in the sky
be with them always
in the air
in darkening storms or sunlight fair
hear us when we lift our prayer
for all in peril
in the air
i was looking at the pictures on your wall
how come a fancy pilot
like slick there
doesnt have his picture up there
what do you have to do
to get your picture up there
you have to die
well yeager you old bastard
dont just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder
get your ass over here and have a drink
i got you something
you could be the first
the man who breaks the sound barrier
will be on top
youd be the one they remembered
youre the best civilian pilot around
you get that helmet
it might work
ill look like the galloping ghost in it
some people say the sound barrier
cant be broke
an engineer will tell you its an absolute
like the firmness of the earth
the sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky
the controls will freeze up
you cant budge the stick
anybody tries to break it will auger in
well now maybe it cant be broke
then again
maybe it can
maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum
how much
come on slick give us a break
nonnegotiable as usual
what do we do now
that guy in the corner
yeager is his name
hes some kind of a war hero
shot down five germans in one day
hes a naturalborn stickandrudder man
as pressliaison man for the air force
i think
any problems with him
only one
whats that
holding him back
we were just talking to slick
about the sound barrier
we feel that the x1
is ready to have a go at it
we think the x1s got the answer
to go beyond mach 1
if there is any beyond
so what do you think
ill tell you half these engineers
have never been off the ground
they might tell you that
the sound barriers a brick wall
itll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it
if you ask me
i dont believe the damn thing even exists
waitress a drink for mr yeager
no thanks i got one
so do you think
you want to have a go at it
i might
but since as you say
this sound barrier doesnt really exist
how much
how much you got
just joking
the air force is already paying me right
so when do we go
how about tomorrow morning
ill be there
see you there
how much are you paying him
i think its 283
a week
a month
well thats not bad
first fellow to break the sound barrier
gets a free steak with all the trimmings
ill have mine medium rare please
honey you ever been caught
on the desert alone
i never have
i dont think i ever will
never met the man
who could catch me out there
im half jackrabbit

more buffeting
more commotion
getting wobbly here
shes getting real active
whats that sound
he bought the farm
thats it were back to square one
wait a minute
ridley make another note would you
must be something wrong
with the machmeter
jumped plumb off the scale
gone screwy on me
you bust it well fix it
personally i think youre seeing things
could be im still going upstairs
like a bat out of hell
we did it
we finally broke the sound barrier
we did it
i want to place a longdistance call
to los angeles
who are you calling
the press
this is big news
the sound barriers been broken
no sir no press
no word of this goes beyond the flight line
whats going on this is big news
we need coverage of this
no sir sorry no press
those are orders national security
but the wars over
look pal maybe they dont want
someone to know
who
the russians maybe
but theyre our allies
well anyway someone figured it out
that way and thats the way it is
chuck youre our man
youre the fastest man alive
we want you to fly more planes for us
we want you to fly all our planes
what you been doing hedgehopping
word will get out major
maybe not to the press
or the general public
but soon every fighter jock rocket ace
and ratracer in the country
will be headed this way wanting
to push the outside of the envelope
and get to the top of the pyramid
edwards air force base
this is the place to be hon
theyre going faster farther
and higher here than anywhere else
ill tell you something else too
well climb right up that ladder
just like we did at langley
we
you mean you
hon were a team
i move up you move up
right to the top of the old pyramid
slow down gordo
come on now youre scaring the girls
youre scaring the girls you are
whos the best pilot you ever saw
whos the best pilot you ever saw
youre looking at him baby
come on cheer up
hey have i ever let you down
deke thats 62 men
in the last 36 weeks
you know what that averages
is that gus grissom from langley field
what is an ace like you
doing in a place like this
well if it aint hot dog
gordo
cooper right
yeah
gordo thinks hes one of those
hotdog pilots you hear so much about
you got a short memory
i am not one of them hotdog pilots
i am the hot dog man himself
i guess youre too shy to tell this guy
how i used to wax your tail
wax my tail
hot dog you were just in my shadow
thats where youll always be
what are you two rookies going to have
rookies
now hold on sis
you are looking
at a whole new ballgame here now
in a few years i bet youre even
going to immortalize us
by putting our pictures up there
on your wall
did i say something wrong
ill tell you we got two categories
of pilots around here
we got your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes
and we got your pudknockers
who dream about getting the hot planes
now what are you two pudknockers
going to have
scotch
you know what happened
the machine broke
not the machine its the man
he was dead before he went up
dont talk about it here
good one now fire it in here
look at old yeager
on top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years
every time somebody goes faster
he just goes up again
he stays the fastest man alive
you know
sometimes
all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting
i think
thats the crash truck
anyway
im really glad we could talk
i thought i was the only one
who had these nightmares
yeah me too
nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here
everybodys always trying to
maintain an even strain
well you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military
ill tell you one thing
the military owes me for all this
one day i expect the military
to make good
well it sure aint your average dull life
i went east for a reunion
and all my friends could talk about
was their husbands work
how dogeatdog and cutthroat it was
on madison avenue
places like that
cutthroat
i wondered how they would have felt
if each time their husband
went in to make a deal
there was a one in four chance
he wouldnt come out of the meeting
im going home to my folks in san diego
what did gordo say
he maintained an even strain
look at them
youd think they were talking about sports
men
sometimes theyre just such assholes
sometimes they sure are
handy assholes though
yeah sometimes
sometimes
you want a hot dog
im leaving gordo
look at that
yeah thats the d558 phase 2
scott crossfield
it sure as hell is jesus
he scorched that one didnt he
hes pushing the outside of the envelope
he must be going for a record
hes shooting for mach 2 i heard
on the 50th anniversary
of the wright brothers historic flight
another historic flight takes place
as scott crossfield
streaks across the skies
over the high desert in california
mach 2
almost 1500 miles per hour
and a new world record
its a field day for the press
congratulations come
from a previous record holder
as he shakes the hand
of the fastest man alive scott crossfield
and theres a comradeship of speed
to scott crossfield the fastest man alive
compliments of panchos scotty
the real test wasnt mach 2
i guess that demon lives out
at about 23 on your machmeter
yeah but mach 2 was the magic number
like 60 homers like batting400
like the fourminute mile
the press likes a nice round number
after that they dont care
until the next magic number
you need more than speed records
you need coverage
coverage
you mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras
those root weevils write history
let them write the history
and let the pilots fly the planes
pilots
you know what really makes
your rocket ships go up
the aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that
funding
thats what makes your ships go up
ill tell you something
and you guys too
no bucks no buck rogers
whoever gets the funding
gets the technology
whoever gets the technology stays on top
flyboy lets dance
ill drink to that
hell be going after crossfield soon
wont he
no he wont
hell be going after that demon
that lives in the thin air
you got any beemans
even before you hit mach 2
shell be unforgiving on you
so take it easy
wring her out a little bit this time
you got any gum
yeah i got me a stick
loan me some ill pay you back later
fair enough
thank you
okay drop her
all right here we go again
drop
number 3 coming on
got seven seconds on 150 right now
ive got you in sight chuck
going out of sight
now
mach 1
number 4
here goes mach 2
2 1
sorry scotty
you got her now buddy
you can ease it back
bring it on in
im pushing the envelope
see where that demon lives
come in chuck
say again over
do you read over
damn hes uncorked it
mayday mayday
alert all ground crews
talk to me
come in
do you read me over
im fighting bad here
im down to 25000 over tehachapi
i dont know if i can make it
back to base or not
what happened
think i bust the canopy with my head
im getting okay now
we sure chased that old demon this time
thats as fast as a man can go
whats next ridley
its called sputnik
we know sit down
and as i was saying
whoever controls
the high ground of space
will control the world
the roman empire controlled
the world because it could build roads
later the british empire was dominant
because it had ships
in the air stage we were powerful
because we had the airplane
now the communists have established
a foothold in outer space
soon theyll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us
like rocks from a highway overpass
how the hell did they get ahead of us
gentlemen i think were ready
is there a loose plug over there anywhere
here it is ill get it
senator johnsons right
this is armageddon
the decisive battle between
the forces of good and evil
were engaged in a struggle for survival
this footage was assembled from
sources operating under deep cover
at great risk
were fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men
this is secret footage
of the russian korabl rocket
and these are the german scientists
that they captured after the war
was it their german scientists
who got them up there first
no it was not senator
our germans are better
than their germans
thats titov on the right
and on the left is gagarin
no titovs on the left
gagarins on the right
they bear a great resemblance
to each other
if the soviets ever do put a man up there
it will be one of these two
most likely the one on the left
gagarin
titov
isnt that their chief designer
we know very little about him
let us see him again
heres some more of him
theyve developed a program
of stupendous dimensions
and he is clearly the genius behind it
i for one do not intend to go to sleep
by the light of a communist moon
get that moron off of there
we could have orbited
a satellite a year ago
if we had been given a green light
now we must get something up there
quick and dirty any way at all
well what
by combining our available rockets
the redstone the atlas
i agree that we could launch a pod
a pot
a pod
a capsule
now we will be in full control of this pod
it will go up like a cannonball
and come down like a cannonball
splashing down in the ocean
with a parachute to spare the life
of the specimen inside
spaceman
specimen
well what kind of specimen
a tough one
responsive to orders
i had in mind a jimp
jimp
well what the hell is a jimp
a jimp a jimpanzee senator an ape
the first american into space
is not going to be a chimpanzee
who would you put into space
mr president
we have film of some people
we think are strong candidates
wed like to run it by you
and stimulate some thinking
these are people we felt
would be excellent in the splashdown
we like the one on the right
no on the left
on the right dont embarrass me
these people are very experienced with
machinery and have their own helmets
is that a factor
as youll see
theyre quite comfortable
in conditions of flame
now this is personnel who have
very welldeveloped equilibrium
good middle ear also very nice people
very easy to work with
with some work
they could be very responsive to orders
this is my first choice
the man with the hood
since he works without eyesight
his other senses are sharpened
in space therell be little need
for eyeballing at any rate
the cannonball effect you mentioned
we were basically thinking about
putting a couple into orbit
possibly adds emotional stability
this individual combines many
plus factors that we mentioned
ease with flames comfort at heights
and agility in the splashdown phase
also he is available as of the 15th
i want test pilots
test pilots no you cant deal with them
im sure we can do better
with another type of man
any other type of man
a more manageable type
it will only complicate things
with a man we must guarantee
a safe return
mr president i think
youd be wise to reconsider
test pilots
well be heading for some air bases
not just some air bases
the one with the great test pilots
theres only one place to go
i was there once before
and i hoped id never have to go back
its a godforsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in california
a prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called edwards
theyve got a weird madmonk squadron
they live in rat shacks terrible conditions
corrugated tin bare bones low rent
this is the joint they hang out in
panchos happy bottom riding club
its called happy bottom riding club
howd it get a name like that
ask pancho
were meeting the liaison officer
they are expecting us
they whos they
the best
the best test pilots in the world
they got some kind of brotherhood
they think they got the right stuff
what stuff heroism bravery
there any snakes around here
yeah in the bushes
heroism and bravery are part of it
but seems to be more to it
what do they say it means
they dont say anything
they dont talk about it
they dont talk about it to outsiders
to each other
to outsiders they say even less
anyway theyre all here
including the ace of aces himself
whos that
yeager
never heard of him
these must be our gentlemen
from washington
scouting for astronauts
scouting for lab rabbits more likely
i didnt quite hear you
i said lab rabbits
whats that mean
it means you dont need
honesttogod pilots
what you ought to get is a lab rabbit
to curl up in your damn capsule
with its heart beating
and a wire up the kazoo
i dont hold with it
i dont either
you want a pilot to be a ballistic missile
and then splashdown
possibly get lost at sea
theres some things you cant change
some peckerwoods
got to take the beast up
and some peckerwoods got to land it
and that peckerwood is called a pilot
youre mighty right
the boys smell panic in your program
thats one thing they dont respond to
now maybe if we talk privately
to yeager and some of the other boys
thats yeager
anybody goes up in the damn things
gonna be spam in a can
yeager doesnt fit the profile
he didnt go to college
were only taking college personnel
forget about walker and crossfield
and the other civilian pilots too
the security clearance just takes
too long with those people
besides they seem
a little too independent
you mean for this space race
you dont want our best pilots
i didnt say that
we want the best pilots that we can get
yall want some whiskey
no thanks fred just a little coffee
id like a cocacola
in a clean glass
theres an old saying
never refuse a combat assignment
well there sure is a long line
of shithot rocket aces around here
hey hot dog
what the hells astronaut mean anyway
star voyager
star voyager gus grissom
i like the sound of that
now your name is
my name josé jiménez
who are we gonna get
to take on the russians
have you seen this josé jiménez
hes a crackup
i am the chief astronaut
of the united states interplanetary
my name josé jiménez
now i see you have some of
your space equipment with you
what is that called the crash helmet
oh i hope not
get that guy off
the countrys already laughing at us
this is the show i wanted you to see
who that kid
winner of five
distinguished flying crosses
and holder of the coasttocoast
nonstop supersonic flight record
from the us marine corps
major john glenn
that guy
can you tell us whats that song
straighten up and fly right
its straighten up and fly right
hes not dumb
major eddie here has a little problem
with his girlfriend
did you ever have a problem like that
when you were ten
yes i did bob
i liked a girl in my class but
the other guys liked her too
and she didnt pay attention
but i kept after her eddie
did you finally get her to notice you
yes i did
in fact i finally got her to marry me
they love the guy
delta charlie 9 you are clear to land
at 180 degrees
josé jiménez on approach
my name josé jiménez
yeah shepard i forgot
you are clear at 180 degrees
some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut
they want to make me an astronaut
oh i hope not
are you sure the navys got good pilots
they call them aviators in the navy
they say theyre better than pilots
gentlemen id like you
to meet alan shepard
id like you to meet alan shepard
just the man we came to see
youve heard about our project
were going up against the russians
its got the highest
priority
its a hazardous
undertaking in fact
its extremely hazardous
its so hazardous that
if you decide not to volunteer
it will not be held against you
in any way
sounds dangerous
it is
count me in
theres nothing to worry about
absolutely nothing
why are you doing this to me
im afraid theres no simple way
to explain that to you
thank you number 21
number 22 please
youre gonna love it
excuse me are you john glenn
scott carpenter
i recognize you from those tv shows
i like them
i had a good time doing them
i guess were both here
for the same reason
you know what theyve got planned
no let me check it out
what have you got scheduled
were not really free
to reveal all the testing
i dont get this
sending us down here
disguised as civilians
come on gus cut it out what the hell
hot dog this entire operations
supposed to be hushhush
we got topsecret orders to blend in
with the patients so shut up
there might be russian agents here
they dont look very russian to me gus
all we got here is your local gentry and
then you got navy
and marine pilots over here
none of these guys is up
to air force standards
i hear they got some 50some guys
trying out for seven spots
after they pick us three
theres only gonna be four spots
sounds right to me where do we go next
you go in that door
who are you
my name josé jiménez
you talking to us buddy
all air force pilots go in that door
when they all go in
they all look the same
but when they all come out
they all look different
hows that
fellow i said hows that
when they all come out
they all look scared
buenos dias gonzalez
buenos dias yourself
would you come this way
that guy didnt fool me a bit
that mexican guy
that guys navy all the way
theres another swabbo
ill open the box a little so you can see
dont put your fingers in there
this thing will bite them off its vicious
real swabbo sense of humor
lets see what there is
to be scared about back here
the ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines
you may begin now
the record is 91 seconds
ninetythree seconds read it and weep
terrific scott darn good
you were probably just getting warmed up
next time i doubt id win
i dont know about that
were competing with archie and jughead
let me out of here let me out
gus i got this whole thing figured out
the drill here
the drill here is to see who can drill
the brains out of nurse murch
youre nuts
she thinks were all just
miserable pudknockers
this is one fighter jock
who is not a miserable pudknocker
shes a woman
susceptible to charms like all of the rest
you want what in there
sperm
what for
sperm motility factors
yeah but nurse
how am i supposed to
the best results seem to be obtained
through fantasization
accompanied by masturbation
followed by ejaculation
that sounds easy enough
ill tell you what
if i get stuck you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit
please return it to the lab
hey cut out the humming in there
okay knock it off in there
okay glenn i know thats you
just knock it off
because im trying to concentrate in here
that was quick
theres plenty more where that came from
you want to see me again
id like to meet your wife
youre married arent you
yeah sure im married all right
happily
yeah a real stable relationship too
id like to meet your wife
tomorrow
tomorrows no good
tomorrow
i need you trudy
im talking about a whole new ball game
fresh start
this astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder
if we play our cards right
we go all the way to the top
we you mean you
i mean we
were a team
have i ever let you down
yeah
whos the best pilot you ever saw
youre looking at him
youre all set i told her you were stable
welladjusted attentive persevering
i lied
that a girl
whatd she say
she laughed
she knows you too well gordo
lets face it some women
just have a problem with men
yeah i know
at secret locations throughout america
56 of our greatest pilots
are at this moment
vying to be one of the first men
to go into space
these are the most uptodate
tests imaginable
this is the most rigorous physical testing
ever done to human beings
theyre being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent
these men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life
they will be guiding a new machine
through a hostile environment
they will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee
many are called but few will be chosen
these are men who will have to face
any danger for their country
no individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event
each man knows
that whoever survives this competition
is destined to become
a legend in his own time
here hold this
and hold this like this
when the clamp is released
the balloon inside you deflates
deflates wheres the john
two floors up gonzalez will take
you there but wait here with him
hows it going gonzalez
faster
good day commander
you prick
push the button
me and my friends think your
josé jiménez imitation is aokay
but what youre doing with it is bad
youre right youre absolutely right
you ever have any explosions doing this
all the time its a mess
tell me something else mr gonzalez
how am i doing
i think youre gonna make it
i think youre gonna be an astronaut
after a long
and unprecedented
series of evaluations
which told our medical scientists
of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight
it is my pleasure to introduce to you
seven americans
gentlemen all
virgil i gus grissom
leroy g cooper
donald k slayton
john h glenn junior
malcolm s carpenter
alan b shepard junior
walter m schirra junior
americas mercury astronauts
holy shit
smile gus were heroes
yeager ought to see this
seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers
and they havent done a thing
but show up for a press conference
following the distribution of the kits
those of you who have pm deadlines
better dash to your phones
now well have some questions
from the press please
id like to know
whether your wives and children
had anything to say about this
mine think its fine
theyre all for it
i dont think any of us could go on
with something like this
if we didnt have
pretty good backing at home
my wifes attitude towards this
has been the same
as its been all along through my flying
if its what i want to do shes behind it
and by golly my kids are too
100 percent
i dont believe this
but look at them out there
theyre eating it up
i was brought up believing
that you are placed on earth
more or less with a 5050 proposition
this is what i still believe
were placed here with certain talents
and capabilities
and its up to each one of us
to use those talents as best we can
and if we use our talents properly
i think there is a power
greater than us that will place
the opportunities in our way
when i think of orville and wilbur wright
standing on a hill
at kitty hawk north carolina
tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight
and then i think of us here today
i thank god i live in a country
where the best and finest in a man
can be brought out
id like to second some of the things
mr glenn has said here
i think that we are all very
very fortunate
that we have been
should we say blessed
with the talents for something like this
and i think that we would be most remiss
in our duty indeed
if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is
for our country
and to the world in general right now
one of our air force boys
dont you agree deke
i absolutely agree with gordo
but were not saying anything new
were just saying the same things
that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction
can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly
as far as church goes
i attend regularly
which one of you will be
the first into space
the best will be first
share it brother
fucking a bubba
this is for americas life magazine
these are the greatest pilots in america
how much do they make
70008000 a year
tops
at the most
with this one deal
im giving them 500000
split seven ways over three years
how does that sound
now i want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories
these stories will appear in life
under their own bylines
for example
by betty grissom
or by
virgil i grissom
what was that
gus
nobody calls me by that other name
gus
an astronaut named gus
whats your middle name
ivan
maybe
gus isnt so bad
might be something there
all right you can be gus
i bet for all that money
they could call you virgil
they sure could me
well whats with her
she seems snobby
i dont get it
i get it shes mrs clean marine
im going to the cape tomorrow
i wish to heck it wasnt offlimits to wives
theres so much work to do anyway
more tests
training
studying
what about after
after hours ill run a lot
im going to get up to five miles a day
theres a beautiful long beach there
its called cocoa beach
you can run forever
scott carpenter will run with me
hes a good guy
hes real philosophical
what about
the others want to get the job done and
keep the mickey mouse to a minimum
theyre good men
good men
theyll give 100 percent
when the time comes
guess they think im kind of a
gungho type
eddie attaboy
harry hairshirt
what you agree
you agree
my own wife
do you think im a dudley doright
thats me i guess
a lonely beacon of restraint
and selfsacrifice
in a squall of carcrazies
its important to america
to get a man up there first
i plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket
what is the most important thing
in rocket travel
to me the most important thing
is the blastoff
i always take a blast before i take off
otherwise i wouldnt go near it
he loves ed sullivan
four down three to go
i dont want anything to put this program
in a bad light
we have the opportunity of a lifetime
and im sorry but i wont stand by
and let other people compromise
the whole darned thing
you know and i know this could lead
to something very unfortunate
im talking about the playing around
thats going on
im talking about the young girls
im talking about the cookies
im talking about keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry
mr glenn you are way out of line
i advise you not to try to foist your
moral views on anyone else in this group
each man here has volunteered to do a job
each man is devoting long hours
of training
and doing many things above
and beyond the call of duty
such as morale tours of factories
such as bringing girls up to your room
and forgoing any orderly family life
mr glenn as long
as a man uses good sense
what he does with his wick
is his own business
im from life magazine
im not with these people
you cant go in
theyre discussing scientific problems
johns right whether we like it or not
were public figures
whether we deserve it or not
people look up to us
we have a tremendous responsibility
you cant tell a pilot what to do
when hes not flying
wait a minute you got it all wrong
the issue here aint pussy
the issue here is monkey
us we are the monkey
what gus is saying is
that were missing the point
gus is saying that we all heard rumors
they want to send a monkey up first
none of us wants them to send
a monkey up to do a mans work
what gus is saying is that
what theyre trying to do to us
is send a man up to do a monkeys work
us a bunch of
collegetrained chimpanzees
what gus is saying is that
weve got to change things around here
hes saying that we are pilots
we know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else
so what we have to do
is alter the experiment
it comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on
what gus is saying here is
that weve got to stick together on this
these tests were designed
to decondition to desensitize
to adapt out fears
since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle
all we seek from the occupants
of the capsule is data
the socalled astronaut
would merely be a redundant component
and here you can see
these chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men
and they are much more cooperative
they are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training
as far as we are concerned
the question still remains
which one will be first
the man or
the monkey
we shall see
take it easy with that
where are you putting the window
window
there is no window
no window
what about the hatch
we need a hatch with explosive bolts
that we can open ourselves
theres something you dont understand
this is the final form of the capsule
no hatch
what would happen
if the automatic controls went out
with backups checks
this would not happen
i said what would happen if it did
the pilot would have to fly it back
this is the way it is
i wonder how the press will feel about this
the press what does the press
have to say about this
do you boys know
what makes this bird go up
funding makes this bird go up
thats right no bucks
no buck rogers
and the press over there
they all want to see buck rogers
and thats us
buck rogers
you see those fellows over there
have been making us out
as the seven finest and bravest pilots
in all america
if the story would come out in the press
that we are not allowed to fly as pilots
we want a window
there could maybe be
in future capsules a window
here
no thats where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes
the hatch with the explosive
there could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule
that is a spacecraft sir
we do not refer to it as a capsule
spacecraft
a hatch with explosive bolts on the
spacecraft
and there will be pitch and yaw thrusters
to enable the occupant
the pilot
astronautpilot
the astronaut
pilot
to have some
to have
control
of the reentry procedures
we appreciate it
you wouldnt mind if we had the press
take a few photos of us would you
which one of you is going to be
the first one to be launched into space
here he is
captain ham
grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato
does he look like the kind of guy
whod put doodoo in the capsule
ham in a can
americas first astronaut look at him
you take a monkey like this
you can make him into a great astronaut
i think hes better looking than crossfield
how would you like to go up
with this guy as your copilot
theyve got a man up there its gagarin
we know sit down
all right give them a break
is it true you were ready to go
and the flight was cancelled
is it true we couldve beaten the russians
why didnt we send a man up
instead of a monkey
i think we ought to be
forthright gracious
and magnanimous and say
the russians beat the pants off us
no sense in kidding ourselves about it
but the space age has begun
and theres plenty of work
who will be the second man in space
you mean who will be
the first free man into space
we know itll be glenn just tell us when
thats a secret
im tired of being forthright
gracious and magnanimous
im tired of stupid questions
from the press
im tired of smocks
of engineers telling us what we cant do
im tired of everybody saying
we are not pilots
im tired of monkeys
most of all im sick and tired
of being second to those
those darned russians its time we
got someone up there
fucking a bubba
exactly
lets talk to them
lets get this thing on the road
im tired of messing around
well just tell em were ready
were ready to go
in these three weeks since the russian
gagarins flight surprised everybody
one wretched event
has followed another
people have begun to say
our rockets always blow up
our boys always botch it
some say this is not the time to try
desperate deeds to beat the soviets
the question really is
are we actually ready
to launch a man into space
and yet out here at this very moment
sits a rocket waiting in the night
soon one american astronaut
will climb atop that rocket
in what may be the greatest
deathdefying stunt ever broadcast
the identity of americas first astronaut
has been kept a secret
until almost the final moment
the question everyone has asked is
which one will be first
not very funny john
but i do appreciate it john
i surely do
vaya con dios josé
dear lord please dont let me fuck up
i didnt quite copy that say again please
i said everythings aokay
well thats what i thought you said
he said everything is aokay
he says everything is aokay
and there you have it
roger auto retrojettison switch
retroheater switch off

this is it ladies this is for life magazine
my god theyre going
after the diaperservice man
we dont have a diaperservice man
oh louise your lawn
why are they here
what do they want
we are here live at the house
of louise shepard
wife of astronaut al shepard
who is about to go into space
wanted to keep you informed
mrs shepard
everythings aokay
nothing to worry about
just some delays
what kind of delays
theres another hold from nasa
another delay
and alan shepard sits there
patiently waiting
what can be going through
a mans mind at this moment
i have to urinate
urinate
urinate no we did not think of that
this is only a 15minute flight
the mans been up there for hours
could he do it in his suit
it might be dangerous
to introduce liquid
into the pure oxygen of the capsule
and the pressure suit
might cause a short circuit
it could start a fire
no tell him he cannot
listen old buddy they promise
well stop at the next gas station
request that you remain
in a holding pattern till then
you sure you just want a little smidgen
about a half a cup
and nothing in it
thats fine
all right
alan had four cups of coffee
before he went to work this morning
all this waiting is driving me crazy
i had a little accident
request permission to relieve bladder
look the man has got to go
its either that or we get the lug wrench
and pry him out
do it in the suit
josé permission granted
to wet your diapers anytime son
suit thermometer says
freon flow jumping from 30 to 45
left lowerchest sensor
no shortout moving up back
well
im a wetback now
it is questionable if we can proceed
im cooler than you are why dont you
fix your problems and light this candle
hes right lets light this candle
he surely is light the candle
resume the countdown
t minus ten seconds
nine eight seven
ignition
youre on your way josé
we have liftoff and the clock is operating
i think well be able to talk
to one of the astronaut wives
if not to louise shepard herself
he has reentered the earths atmosphere
and the gforces should be building up
louise hes coming down
we almost missed this
eight
thats nine
im okay
the vice president
who is chairman of our space council
and who bears great responsibilities
in this field
the members of the house and senate
space committee
who are here today to award you
this decoration
which has gone from the ground up
what was jackie like
shes very nice
we talked about all kinds of things
my gus goes up next
i cant wait to talk to jackie after that
youll love her shes so nice
we talked about the kids
mr shepard sign here

i aint doing anymore
damn things dragging in the mud
and i cant get it up
charm gus thats pure charm
howd you like one of these

see you after outer space
you got to think ahead to the future
folks have a taste for things
that have been there
ill give you one of these dimes
im taking up so you can play with it
and dream about outer space
why dont you just make sure
you dont screw the pooch
oh god look at this
go get em deke
grissom has just reached the apex
of his flight into outer space
and will be coming down
with the valuable data
needed for the future flights
that will actually orbit the earth
he will be reentering the atmosphere now
liberty bell 7 liberty bell 7
this is hunt club 1 over
were in orbit at this time
around the capsule
are you ready to come in and hook on
roger this is hunt club 1
waiting for your okay
to come in and hook on
roger ive unplugged my suit
so im kind of warm now
hunt club 1 roger
one roger
roger blow the hatch after we hook on
all right get ready
another 15 feet to the right
if youre ready for me to blow the hatch
ill take my helmet off
say again liberty bell
waiting for your okay to hook on
who designed this
say again liberty bell we cant hear you
i cant get it off
liberty bell say again
this is hunt club 1 waiting for your okay
what happened
its all right hes okay
go for the capsule
help im sinking
get the capsule he can float in that suit
we need the data in the capsule
throw down a line
help throw down the line
hey im sinking
forget the fucking capsule
we cant pull it its full of water
hey help me over here
weve lost it
blow the cable
come back here damn it
throw a line down
i didnt do anything
i was just lying there
it just blew
the hatch just blew
it must have been a technical malfunction
the capsule was rocking around a bit
there were no loose items i dont see
how i could have hit that button
i was just lying there flat on my back
and it just blew
well what do you think
explosive hatches have been
on jet fighters for ten years
the things have been wrung inside out
subjected to trial by heat
by water by shaking pounding
we even drop them from a height
of 100 feet onto concrete
and not one of them
has ever just blown
are we going to the white house
isnt the president coming
no tickertape parade in new york
not even one in mitchell indiana
no jackie
by order of the president
of the united states
the distinguished service medal
is awarded to captain virgil i grissom
who distinguished himself by valor
above and beyond the call of duty
these actions
reflect great credit upon himself
the air force
and the united states of america
you proud boys
hey look they filled up the refrigerator
pretty good huh
pretty good
a full refrigerator
i can see this afternoon
is shaping up just great
and the rest of the day tomorrow too
what do they want me to do in here
cook
then risk my life and my kids
by dragging them across that highway
to the worst beach in florida
oh gus i wanted to eat
in the white house
i wanted to talk to jackie about
things
well look ive got to go
to the holiday inn for some
beer call with the guys
all those years of test flying
and all those times i waited
and all those times you werent there
the military promised
and now they are welshing
on that damn compact
look i am finally
mrs honorable astronaut
but they are treating me like im
honorable
mrs squirming hatch blower
i didnt do anything wrong
the hatch just blew it was a glitch
it was a technical malfunction
why in hell wont anyone believe me
i know that
gus i mean are these the goodies
is this how the military pays off
oh gus they owe you
but they owe me too
they owe me
they owe me they owe me so much
i love you
we are here with virgil i grissom
and his lovely wife betty
gus has just come back
from the second trip in space
betty how do you feel about this trip
im so proud of him
i think he was wonderful
were all proud of gus grissom
gus how do you feel about the trip
was it a success
it was aokay
my god he lost his capsule
but hes keeping his story
to recap yesterdays dramatic events
here we see americas
newest hero gus grissom
he is shouting to save the capsule first
pull that in flight test its all over for him
he screwed the pooch partner
plain and simple
sometimes you get a pooch
that cant be screwed
the presidents got his own problems
with the bay of pigs
he doesnt want
the astronauts image tarnished
nothing these guys do
is going to be called a failure
these astronauts are our davids
you think the public would know theyre
just doing what monkeys have done
you think a monkey knows hes sitting
on a rocket that might explode
these astronauts know that
ill tell you something
it takes a special man to volunteer
for a suicide mission
especially when its on tv
old gus he did all right
though the capsule was lost
our new hero
astronaut gus grissom was saved
now president kennedy has started
an even more ambitious space program
those who came before us
made certain this country
rode the first waves
of the industrial revolution
the first waves of modern invention
and the first wave of nuclear power
and this generation does not intend
to founder in the backwash
of the coming age of space
we mean to be a part of it
we mean to lead it
you know i always hated flying
when i met you you were already a pilot
so i never had a complaint coming
when you went up in those planes
me and the kids
we never had any insurance
except a couple months pay
i always hated all that talk
about insurance
the government spends
all kinds of time and money
teaching pilots how to be fearless
but they dont spend a penny
teaching you how to be
the fearless wife of a test pilot
but i guess i liked it
i guess i liked the kind of man who could
push the outside of the envelope
flyboy
but i never could stand a man
who was one of those rememberwhens
those bitter guys that just sit around
thinking about old times
if i ever see that happen
im going right out the front door
and youll never catch me
im a fearless man
but im scared to death of you
no youre not
but you ought to be
what is it
the russians have sent titov up
titovs up
how long
a day
a day a whole day
hes orbiting over our country right now
we need a man in orbit or its all over
were scrapping the redstone
and going with the atlas
you know what that means
we havent had too much luck
with that rocket
we cant take all the precautions wed like
itll be dangerous
were ready
i said itll be dangerous
i said were ready 100 percent
inside this trim
modest suburban home is annie glenn
wife of astronaut john glenn
sharing the anxiety and pride
of the world at this tense moment
but in a private and crucial way
that only she can understand
the vice president would like
to see mrs glenn
hes asking for you again
tell them no
im sorry she says no
you dont understand it is very important
the vice president must see her
we are told after the missions success
the vice president will come here
and speak with annie glenn
meanwhile john glenn waits
for the weather to clear
so he can undertake this historic mission
you know what the russians want
they want our peckers in their pockets
she still says no
didnt you tell her ill bring in abctv
nbctv cbstv
her words and mine
will be heard by millions
where are they going
i think the flights been cancelled
cancelled
thats perfect
i will go in and console her
on nationwide tv
ill pay her a sympathy call
the vice president would like to make
a sympathy call if he could
no what do you mean no
i mean no
what do you mean no
somebody get nasa on the line
im going to lean on nasa
im going right to the top
to the top
damn right
they better tell her to play ball
theres a problem with your wife
is it serious
we think it is
theres a phone hookup
weve got her on it
its me are you all right
whats wrong
johnson
wants me
on t v
the vice president
tell her to let him in with the networks
its coverage
its important john
it means a lot
listen to me
if you dont want the vice president
or the networks
or anyone else in our house thats it
as far as im concerned
they are not coming in
and i will back you up 100 percent
and you tell them that
i dont want johnson or the others
to even put a toe in our house
you tell them that astronaut john glenn
told you to say that
ill talk to you soon
you cant do that
the vice presidents head of the program
you must think of the program
you are out of line
im out of line
yes sir
i run the show here
well see about that
and im thinking of changing
the order of flight assignments
who will you get
you heard what he said
take it easy fellows
step aside pal
pilots
pansies cows
gladiolas
isnt there anybody
who can deal with a housewife
waltzing matilda
i thought hank williams wrote it
we dont know who wrote it
its australian right
who are you guys
were aborigines
who are you
me
im an astronaut
well what do you do here astronaut
im here because a buddy of mine
is getting ready to
fly overhead up in outer space
and ill be talking to him on that dish
fly over
you blokes do that too
you do that yourself
not me mate
see that old bloke there
he know
he know the moon
he know the star
and he know the milky way
hell give you a hand
he know
were gonna need all the help we can get
stand by for final tensecond count
the clock is operating
were underway
good lord ride all the way
godspeed john glenn
zerog and i feel fine
the capsule is turning around
the view is tremendous
i can see clear back
a big cloud pattern towards the cape
its a beautiful sight
roger friendship 7
you have a go at least seven orbits
roger al understand
go at least seven orbits
this is friendship 7
speed is 17500 miles per hour
and were moving into night
full moon rising
i can almost touch it
friendship 7 come in do you read
friendship 7 come in please
this sure was a short day
say again please over
that was the shortest day ive run into
kind of passes rapidly huh
i can see some lights down there
in australia gordo
where are they from
all of perth and rockingham
have turned their lights on for you
and we have a few other lights turned on
here and there
they show up very well
thank everybody for turning them on
will you
we sure will john we sure will
heading towards daybreak
lot of cloud coverage today
man its beautiful
possibly its the heat shield
its loose
if it comes off
if the heat shield comes off hell burn up
hell fry when he tries to reenter
muchea this is cape
were showing some trouble
weve got a warning light
possibly a loose heat shield
check your status lights immediately
hes coming
john can you hear me
friendship 7 come in please
try something anything
friendship 7 come in
this is friendship 7 do you read me
wait a second
i see something strange out here
oh my goodness what the heck is that
sparks and needles of some kind
all over the sky
hey let me tell you what im in up here
im in a mass of very small particles
that are brilliantly lit up
like theyre luminescent
i never saw anything like it
a shower of them coming by me now
theyre bright yellow
they swirl around the capsule
and theyre brilliantly lighted
do you think they could be alive
it sounds ridiculous
but they look like fireflies or something
maybe some air force experiment
went amuck
could our astronomers have been wrong
hello capcom do you read me
this is miraculous
could it be those fireflies
or whatever they are
of course not fireflies
roger friendship 7
will you correlate the actions
of the surrounding particles
with that of your control jets
negative
i do not think they were coming
from my control jets
ill tell you what ill try to do
ill try to get some pictures
of these little guys
sounds like a good idea
you guys probably think im nuts
theyre very beautiful
look like fireflies on a summer night
they just dance around
get out of here
get out of here you gadgets
heading into daybreak now another day
leaving the fireflies behind
i have no idea what they were
this is friendship 7
that was some night
that was really exciting
hes going into his third orbit
how much longer are you going
to keep him in the dark
what do we tell him
hes a pilot
tell him the condition of his craft
glenn is in his third orbit
and the flight is going
pretty much as planned
no human individual
has ever been so well prepared
so far the key word
on this textbook flight is operational
everything is aokay
we havent been too lucky
with the atlas rocket
some say we havent taken all
the safety precautions wed like to
is this true
no its absolutely not true
the only critical point is the reentry
if the capsule is not at the correct angle
with the blunt end and heat shield down
it will burn up
there is only one hope
it might be possible to leave
the retrorocket package
which covers the heat shield on
the straps may be strong enough
to hold the heat shield in place
but if this fails
john youre going to
flybywire for reentry
we recommend you do the best
you can to keep a zero angle over
reentry only three orbits
that is correct
do you have a reason for this
not at this time
this is the judgement of cape flight
do you have a time for going
to jettison retro over
we are not sure your landing bag
is deployed
we feel it is possible to reenter
with the retropackage on
we see no difficulty at this time
with that type of reentry
do you read
roger
understand
ill start lining up as carefully as i can
in a minute
see whether scanners will pick up
and correct it for good retrofire attitude
if not
ill correct it myself
were lined up
here we go
whats that sound
humming its him
its all right he does that
he cant hear you
hes hit the ionization blackout
no communications are possible
for a few minutes
then well know
friendship 7 this is cape do you read
this is cape do you read
friendship 7 this is cape do you read
automatic systems are not functioning
hes in flybywire
finally showed up
the one with the big engine
boy if wed only had
one of those a few years back
the bad news is the entire programs
probably going to be scrapped
from now on the astronaut boys
in houston have got the only ticket
barring of course some unforeseen event
the russians set a new record
of 114000 feet
going straight off the ground
nobody cares about
that kind of record anymore
all they want now
is capsules up in outer space
i get a feeling this plane might be able
to beat that russian record
you might be right
and here they come
looky here what i brought you
smile hon
my fellow citizens
americas mercury astronauts
welcome to houston your new home
your neighbors here and i
wed like to give you this little barbecue
texas style
since youre relocating here
to show appreciation for all youve done
mr sharp is contributing the land
the contractors the homes
and department stores the furnishings
which one are you
which ones glenn i want to meet him
hes over there
im going to the moon
i swear to god im on my way
hi little gal
damned glad to meet you too
i heard an awful lot of good things
about you gal
we got it
steak all the trimmings
just like panchos
steak tastes about the same
only theres a lot
more trimmings now gus
you know its funny
here i am i got 25000 a year
for a magazine contract
i got a free house with all the furnishings
got me a corvette
i got a free lunch from one end of america
to the other
and i aint even been up there yet
i noticed that
oh you noticed that
you noticed i hadnt been up there yet
theyre saving the best for last
yeah i guess so hot dog i guess so
just watch you dont screw the pooch
were talking to gordon cooper
he will be the next to orbit the earth
since youre the last of the original seven
and the least well known
could you begin by telling us
who was the best pilot you ever saw
who is the best pilot i ever saw
who is the best pilot i ever saw
ill tell you
ive seen a lot of them
and most of them were pictures on a wall
i said pictures on a wall
back at some place that
doesnt even exist anymore
some of them are
right here in this room
and some of them are
theyre still out there somewhere
doing what they always do
going up each day
in a hurtling piece of machinery
putting their hides out on the line
hanging it out over the edge
pushing back the outside
of that envelope and hauling it back
but there was
one pilot i once saw who i think
truly did have the right
how close did you ever come
to not hauling it back
who is the best pilot i ever saw
well youre looking at him
you got any beemans
i might have me a stick
loan me some ill pay you back later
fair enough
think i see a plane over here
with my name on it
now youre talking
hey whats that
anyone got clearance
what kind of a plane is that
aircraft on ramp did you file a flight plan
aircraft on ramp did you file a flight plan
im taking her up to wring her out a bit
any objections
its yeager
no objections
you are clear to taxi
he must have clearance right
yeah sure he must
its here someplace
now in honor of
these the greatest pilots
in the history of mankind
it gives me great pleasure great pride
to present to you
miss sally rand
stretch it stretch it
you can do it
just a little bit more
104000 here you go
christ almighty
sir over there

yeah youre damn right it is
we hate to disturb you buddy but
weve got a launch
theres millions of people watching
and we thought maybe
yep well no sweat lets go
im ready when you are john 100 percent
ten nine
go
go hot dog go
up we go into the wild blue yonder
thirty seconds and fuel is go
oxygen is go
cabin pressure on the top peg
altimeter is working
have a good ride buddy go
the sun is coming through the window
oh lord what a heavenly light
the mercury program was over
four years later
astronaut gus grissom was killed
along with astronauts white
and chaffee
when fire swept through
their apollo capsule
but on that glorious day in may 1963
gordo cooper went higher farther
and faster than any other american
twentytwo complete orbits
around the world
