their controls would freeze up 
their planes would buffet wildly   
   and they would disintegrate 
the demon lived at mach 1 on the meter   
   750 miles an hour   
   where the air could no longer
move out of the way 
he lived behind a barrier through
which they said no man could ever pass 
they called it the sound barrier 
then they built a small plane   
   the x 1  to try and break
the sound barrier 
and men came to the high desert
of california to ride it 
they were called test pilots   
   and no one knew their names

go away 
 lord  guard and guide
 the men who fly
 through the great spaces
 in the sky 
 be with them always
 in the air
 in darkening storms or sunlight fair 
 hear us when we lift our prayer
 for all in peril
 in the air  
i was looking at the pictures on your wall 
how come a fancy pilot   
   like slick there 
doesn t have his picture up there 
what do you have to do
to get your picture up there 
you have to die 
well  yeager  you old bastard 
don t just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder 
get your ass over here and have a drink 
i got you something 
you could be the first 
the man who breaks the sound barrier
will be on top 
you d be the one they remembered 
you re the best civilian pilot around 
you get that helmet 
it might work 
i ll look like the galloping ghost in it 
some people say the sound barrier
can t be broke 
an engineer will tell you it s an absolute   
   like the firmness of the earth 
the sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky 
the controls will freeze up 
you can t budge the stick 
anybody tries to break it will auger in 
well now  maybe it can t be broke 
then again   
   maybe it can 
maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum 
how much 
 150 000 
come on  slick  give us a break 
non negotiable  as usual 
what do we do now 
that guy in the corner   
yeager is his name 
he s some kind of a war hero 
shot down five germans in one day 
he s a natural born stick and rudder man 
as press liaison man for the air force 
i think   
any problems with him 
  only one 
  what s that 
holding him back 
we were just talking to slick
about the sound barrier 
we feel that the x 1
is ready to have a go at it 
we think the x 1 s got the answer
to go beyond mach 1 
if there is any beyond 
so  what do you think 
i ll tell you  half these engineers
have never been off the ground 
they might tell you that
the sound barrier s a brick wall 
it ll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it 
if you ask me 
i don t believe the damn thing even exists 
waitress  a drink for mr  yeager 
no thanks  i got one 
so  do you think
you want to have a go at it 
i might 
but since  as you say 
this sound barrier doesn t really exist   
   how much   
how much you got 
just joking 
the air force is already paying me  right 
so when do we go 
how about tomorrow morning 
i ll be there 
see you there 
how much are you paying him 
i think it s  283 
a week 
a month 
well  that s not bad 
first fellow to break the sound barrier   
   gets a free steak with all the trimmings 
i ll have mine medium rare  please

on the desert alone 
i never have 
i don t think i ever will 
never met the man

wait a minute 
ridley  make another note  would you 
must be something wrong
with the machmeter 
jumped plumb off the scale 
gone screwy on me 
you bust it  we ll fix it 
personally  i think you re seeing things 
could be  i m still going upstairs
like a bat out of hell 
we did it 
we finally broke the sound barrier 
we did it 
i want to place a long distance call
to los angeles 
who are you calling 
the press 
this is big news 
the sound barrier s been broken 
no  sir  no press 
no word of this goes beyond the flight line 
what s going on  this is big news 
we need coverage of this 
no  sir  sorry  no press 
those are orders  national security 
but the war s over 
look  pal  maybe they don t want
someone to know 
who 
the russians  maybe 
but they re our allies 
well  anyway  someone figured it out
that way  and that s the way it is 
chuck  you re our man 
you re the fastest man alive 
we want you to fly more planes for us 
we want you to fly all our planes 
what you been doing  hedgehopping 
word will get out  major 
maybe not to the press
or the general public 
but soon  every fighter jock  rocket ace 
and rat racer in the country   
   will be headed this way  wanting
to push the outside of the envelope   
   and get to the top of the pyramid 
edwards air force base 
this is the place to be  hon 
they re going faster  farther
and higher here than anywhere else 
i ll tell you something else  too 
we ll climb right up that ladder 
just like we did at langley 
we 
you mean you 
hon  we re a team 
i move up  you move up 
right to the top of the old pyramid 
slow down  gordo 
come on now  you re scaring the girls 
you re scaring the girls  you are 
who s the best pilot you ever saw 
who s the best pilot you ever saw 
you re looking at him  baby 
come on  cheer up 
hey  have i ever let you down 
deke  that s 62 men   
   in the last 36 weeks 
you know what that averages 
is that gus grissom from langley field 
what is an ace like you
doing in a place like this 
well  if it ain t hot dog 
gordo   
   cooper  right 
  yeah 
gordo thinks he s one of those
hot dog pilots you hear so much about 
you got a short memory 
i am not one of them hot dog pilots 
i am the hot dog man himself 
i guess you re too shy to tell this guy
how i used to wax your tail 
wax my tail 
hot dog  you were just in my shadow 
that s where you ll always be 
what are you two rookies going to have 
rookies 
now hold on  sis 
you are looking
at a whole new ballgame here now 
in a few years i bet you re even
going to immortalize us   
   by putting our pictures up there
on your wall 
did i say something wrong 
i ll tell you  we got two categories
of pilots around here 
we got your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes 
and we got your pudknockers
who dream about getting the hot planes 
now what are you two pudknockers
going to have 
scotch 
you know what happened 
the machine broke 
not the machine  it s the man 
he was dead before he went up 
don t talk about it here 
good one  now fire it in here 
look at old yeager 
on top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years 
every time somebody goes faster 
he just goes up again 
he stays the fastest man alive 
you know   
   sometimes   
   all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting 
i think 
 that s the crash truck  
anyway   
   i m really glad we could talk 
i thought i was the only one
who had these nightmares 
yeah  me too 
nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here 
everybody s always trying to   
    maintain an even strain  
well  you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military 
i ll tell you one thing 
the military owes me for all this 
one day i expect the military
to make good 
well  it sure ain t your average dull life 
i went east for a reunion   
   and all my friends could talk about
was their husbands  work 
how dog eat dog and cutthroat it was
on madison avenue   
   places like that 
cutthroat 
i wondered how they would have felt   
   if each time their husband
went in to make a deal   
   there was a one in four chance
he wouldn t come out of the meeting 
i m going home to my folks in san diego 
what did gordo say 
he  maintained an even strain  
look at them 
you d think they were talking about sports 
men   
sometimes they re just such    assholes 
sometimes they sure are
handy assholes  though 
yeah  sometimes   
sometimes 
you want a hot dog 
i m leaving  gordo 
look at that 
yeah  that s the d 558 phase 2 
scott crossfield 
it sure as hell is  jesus 
he scorched that one  didn t he 
he s pushing the outside of the envelope 
he must be going for a record 
he s shooting for mach 2  i heard 
on the 50th anniversary
of the wright brothers  historic flight   
   another historic flight takes place 
as scott crossfield   
   streaks across the skies
over the high desert in california 
mach 2 
almost 1 500 miles per hour   
   and a new world record 
it s a field day for the press 
congratulations come
from a previous record holder   
   as he shakes the hand
of the fastest man alive  scott crossfield 
and there s a comradeship of speed 
to scott crossfield  the fastest man alive 
compliments of pancho s  scotty 
the real test wasn t mach 2 
i guess that demon lives out
at about 2 3 on your machmeter 
yeah  but mach 2 was the magic number 
like 60 homers  like batting 400 
like the four minute mile 
the press likes a nice round number 
after that  they don t care 
until the next magic number 
you need more than speed records 
you need coverage 
coverage 
you mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras 
those root weevils write history 
let them write the history 
and let the pilots fly the planes 
pilots 
you know what really makes
your rocket ships go up 
the aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that   
funding 
that s what makes your ships go up 
i ll tell you something 
and you guys  too 
no bucks  no buck rogers 
whoever gets the funding
gets the technology 
whoever gets the technology stays on top 
flyboy  let s dance 
i ll drink to that 
he ll be going after crossfield soon 
won t he 
no  he won t 
he ll be going after that demon
that lives in the thin air 
you got any beemans 
even before you hit mach 2 
she ll be unforgiving on you 
so take it easy 
wring her out a little bit this time 
you got any gum 
yeah  i got me a stick 
loan me some  i ll pay you back later 
  fair enough 
  thank you 
okay  drop her 
all right  here we go again 
drop 
number 3 coming on 
got seven seconds on 150 right now 
i ve got you in sight  chuck 
going out of sight   
   now 
mach 1 
number 4 
here goes mach 2 
2  1 
sorry  scotty 
you got her now  buddy 
you can ease it back 
bring it on in 
i m pushing the envelope 
see where that demon lives 
come in  chuck 
say again  over 
do you read  over 
damn  he s uncorked it 
mayday  mayday 
alert all ground crews 
talk to me 
come in 
do you read me  over 
i m fighting bad here 
i m down to 25 000 over tehachapi 
i don t know if i can make it
back to base or not 
what happened 
think i bust the canopy with my head 
i m getting okay now 
we sure chased that old demon this time 
that s as fast as a man can go 
what s next  ridley 
it s called sputnik 
we know  sit down 
and as i was saying   
   whoever controls
the high ground of space   
   will control the world 
the roman empire controlled
the world because it could build roads 
later  the british empire was dominant
because it had ships 
in the air stage  we were powerful
because we had the airplane 
now the communists have established
a foothold in outer space 
soon they ll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us   
   like rocks from a highway overpass 
how the hell did they get ahead of us 
gentlemen  i think we re ready 
is there a loose plug over there anywhere 
here it is  i ll get it 
senator johnson s right 
this is armageddon 
the decisive battle between
the forces of good and evil 
we re engaged in a struggle for survival 
this footage was assembled from   
   sources operating under deep cover
at great risk 
we re fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men 
this is secret footage
of the russian korabl rocket   
   and these are the german scientists
that they captured after the war 
was it their german scientists
who got them up there first 
no  it was not  senator 
our germans are better
than their germans 
that s titov on the right
and on the left is gagarin 
no  titov s on the left 
gagarin s on the right 
they bear a great resemblance
to each other 
if the soviets ever do put a man up there 
it will be one of these two 
most likely  the one on the left 
  gagarin 
  titov 
isn t that their chief designer 
we know very little about him 
  let us see him again 
  here s some more of him 
they ve developed a program
of stupendous dimensions   
   and he is clearly the genius behind it 
i  for one  do not intend to go to sleep   
   by the light of a communist moon 
get that moron off of there 
we could have orbited
a satellite a year ago   
   if we had been given a green light 
now we must get something up there
quick and dirty  any way at all 
well  what 
by combining our available rockets 
the redstone  the atlas   
   i agree that we could launch a pod 
a pot 
a pod 
a capsule 
now  we will be in full control of this pod 
it will go up like a cannonball   
   and come down like a cannonball   
   splashing down in the ocean   
   with a parachute to spare the life
of the specimen inside 
spaceman 
specimen 
well  what kind of  specimen  
a tough one 
responsive to orders 
i had in mind a jimp 
 jimp  
well  what the hell is a  jimp  
a jimp  a jimpanzee  senator  an ape 
the first american into space
is not going to be a chimpanzee 
who would you put into space 
mr  president 
we have film of some people
we think are strong candidates 
we d like to run it by you
and stimulate some thinking 
these are people we felt
would be excellent in the splashdown 
we like the one on the right 
  no  on the left 
  on the right  don t embarrass me 
these people are very experienced with
machinery and have their own helmets 
is that a factor 
as you ll see   
   they re quite comfortable
in conditions of flame 
now this is personnel who have
very well developed equilibrium 
good middle ear  also very nice people 
very easy to work with 
with some work 
they could be very responsive to orders 
this is my first choice 
the man with the hood 
since he works without eyesight 
his other senses are sharpened 
in space there ll be little need
for eyeballing at any rate 
the cannonball effect you mentioned   
we were basically thinking about   
   putting a couple into orbit 
possibly adds emotional stability 
this individual combines many
plus factors that we mentioned 
ease with flames  comfort at heights
and agility in the splashdown phase 
also  he is available as of the 15th 
i want test pilots 
test pilots  no  you can t deal with them 
i m sure we can do better
with another type of man   
   any other type of man 
a more manageable type 
it will only complicate things 
with a man we must guarantee
a safe return 
mr  president  i think
you d be wise to reconsider 
test pilots 
we ll be heading for some air bases 
not just some air bases 
the one with the great test pilots 
there s only one place to go 
i was there once before
and i hoped i d never have to go back 
it s a god forsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in california 
a prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called edwards 
they ve got a weird  mad monk squadron 
they live in rat shacks  terrible conditions 
corrugated tin  bare bones  low rent 
this is the joint they hang out in 
pancho s happy bottom riding club 
it s called happy bottom riding club 
how d it get a name like that 
ask pancho 
we re meeting the liaison officer 
they are expecting us 
they  who s  they  
the best   
the best test pilots in the world 
they got some kind of brotherhood 
they think they got the right stuff 
what stuff  heroism  bravery 
there any snakes around here 
yeah  in the bushes 
heroism and bravery are part of it 
but seems to be more to it 
what do they say it means 
they don t say anything 
they don t talk about it 
they don t talk about it to outsiders 
to each other 
to outsiders they say even less 
anyway  they re all here 
including the ace of aces himself 
who s that 
yeager 
never heard of him 
these must be our gentlemen
from washington   
   scouting for astronauts 
scouting for lab rabbits  more likely 
i didn t quite hear you 
i said   lab rabbits  
what s that mean 
it means you don t need
honest to god pilots 
what you ought to get is a lab rabbit
to curl up in your damn capsule   
   with its heart beating   
   and a wire up the kazoo 
i don t hold with it 
i don t either 
you want a pilot to be a ballistic missile 
and then splashdown 
possibly get lost at sea 
there s some things you can t change 
some peckerwood s
got to take the beast up 
and some peckerwood s got to land it 
and that peckerwood is called a pilot 
you re mighty right 
the boys smell panic in your program 
that s one thing they don t respond to 
now maybe if we talk privately
to yeager and some of the other boys   
that s yeager 
anybody goes up in the damn thing s
gonna be spam in a can 
yeager doesn t fit the profile 
he didn t go to college 
we re only taking college personnel 
forget about walker and crossfield
and the other civilian pilots  too 
the security clearance just takes
too long with those people 
besides  they seem
a little too independent 
you mean for this space race   
   you don t want our best pilots 
i didn t say that 
we want the best pilots that we can get 
y all want some whiskey 
no  thanks  fred  just a little coffee 
i d like a coca cola 
in a clean glass 
there s an old saying 
 never refuse a combat assignment  
well  there sure is a long line
of shit hot rocket aces around here 
hey  hot dog 
what the hell s  astronaut  mean anyway 
star voyager 
star voyager gus grissom 
i like the sound of that 
now your name is 
my name  josé jiménez 
who are we gonna get

he s a crack up 
i am the chief astronaut
of the united states interplanetary   
my name  josé jiménez 
now i see you have some of
your space equipment with you 
what is that called  the crash helmet 
oh  i hope not 
get that guy off 
the country s already laughing at us 
this is the show i wanted you to see 
who  that kid 
winner of five
distinguished flying crosses   
   and holder of the coast to coast 
nonstop  supersonic flight record   
   from the u s  marine corps   
   major john glenn 
that guy 
can you tell us what s that song 
straighten up and fly right 
it s straighten up and fly right 
he s not dumb 
major  eddie here has a little problem
with his girlfriend 
did you ever have a problem like that
when you were ten 
yes  i did  bob 
i liked a girl in my class  but   
   the other guys liked her too
and she didn t pay attention 
but i kept after her  eddie 
did you finally get her to notice you 
yes  i did 
in fact  i finally got her to marry me

delta charlie 9  you are clear to land   
   at 180 degrees 
josé jiménez on approach 
my name  josé jiménez 
yeah  shepard  i forgot 
you are clear at 180 degrees 
some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut 
they want to make me an astronaut 
oh  i hope not 
are you sure the navy s got good pilots 
they call them aviators in the navy 
they say they re better than pilots 
gentlemen  i d like you
to meet alan shepard 
i d like you to meet alan shepard 
just the man we came to see 
you ve heard about our project 
we re going up against the russians 
it s got the highest   
priority 
it s a hazardous   
   undertaking  in fact 
it s extremely hazardous 
it s so hazardous that
if you decide not to volunteer   
   it will not be held against you
in any way 
  sounds dangerous 
  it is 
count me in 
there s nothing to worry about 
absolutely nothing 
why are you doing this to me 
i m afraid there s no simple way
to explain that to you 
thank you  number 21 
number 22  please 
you re gonna love it 
excuse me  are you john glenn 
scott carpenter 
i recognize you from those tv shows 
i like them 
i had a good time doing them 
i guess we re both here
for the same reason 
you know what they ve got planned 
no  let me check it out 
what have you got scheduled 
we re not really free
to reveal all the testing 
i don t get this 
sending us down here
disguised as civilians 
come on  gus  cut it out  what the hell    
hot dog  this entire operation s
supposed to be hush hush 
we got top secret orders to blend in
with the patients  so shut up 
there might be russian agents here 
they don t look very russian to me  gus 
all we got here is your local gentry  and   
   then you got navy
and marine pilots over here 
none of these guys is up
to air force standards 
i hear they got some 50 some guys
trying out for seven spots 
after they pick us three 
there s only gonna be four spots 
sounds right to me  where do we go next 
you go in that door 
who are you 
my name  josé jiménez 
you talking to us  buddy 
all air force pilots go in that door 
when they all go in   
   they all look the same 
but when they all come out   
   they all look different 
how s that 
fellow  i said how s that 
when they all come out   
   they all look scared 
buenos dias  gonzalez 
buenos dias yourself 
would you come this way 
that guy didn t fool me a bit 
that mexican guy 
that guy s navy all the way 
there s another swabbo 
i ll open the box a little so you can see 
don t put your fingers in there 
this thing will bite them off  it s vicious 
real swabbo sense of humor 
let s see what there is
to be scared about back here 
the ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines 
you may begin    now 
the record is 91 seconds 
ninety three seconds  read it and weep 
terrific  scott  darn good 
you were probably just getting warmed up 
next time i doubt i d win 
i don t know about that 
we re competing with archie and jughead 
let me out of here  let me out 
gus  i got this whole thing figured out 
the drill here   
the drill here is to see who can drill
the brains out of nurse murch 
you re nuts 
she thinks we re all just
miserable pudknockers 
this is one fighter jock
who is not a miserable pudknocker 
she s a woman 
susceptible to charms like all of the rest 
you want what in there 
sperm 
what for 
sperm motility factors 
yeah  but  nurse   
   how am i supposed to   
the best results seem to be obtained
through fantasization   
   accompanied by masturbation 
followed by ejaculation 
that sounds easy enough 
i ll tell you what 
if i get stuck  you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit 
please return it to the lab 
hey  cut out the humming in there 
okay  knock it off in there 
okay  glenn  i know that s you 
just knock it off 
because i m trying to concentrate in here 
that was quick 
there s plenty more where that came from 
you want to see me again 
i d like to meet your wife 
you re married  aren t you 
yeah  sure  i m married all right 
happily 
yeah  a real stable relationship  too 
i d like to meet your wife 
tomorrow 
tomorrow s no good 
tomorrow 
i need you  trudy 
i m talking about a whole new ball game 
fresh start 
this astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder 
if we play our cards right 
we go all the way to the top 
we  you mean you 
i mean we 
we re a team 
have i ever let you down 
yeah 
who s the best pilot you ever saw 
you re looking at him 
you re all set  i told her you were stable 
well adjusted  attentive  persevering 
  i lied 
  that a girl 
what d she say 
she laughed 
she knows you too well  gordo 
let s face it  some women
just have a problem with men 
yeah  i know 
at secret locations throughout america   
   56 of our greatest pilots
are at this moment   
   vying to be one of the first men
to go into space 
these are the most up to date
tests imaginable 
this is the most rigorous physical testing
ever done to human beings 
they re being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent 
these men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life 
they will be guiding a new machine
through a hostile environment 
they will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee 
many are called  but few will be chosen 
these are men who will have to face
any danger for their country 
no individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event 
each man knows
that whoever survives this competition   
   is destined to become
a legend in his own time 
here  hold this 
and hold this like this 
when the clamp is released 
the balloon inside you deflates 
deflates  where s the john 
two floors up  gonzalez will take
you there  but wait here with him 
how s it going  gonzalez 
faster 
good day  commander 
you prick 
push the button 
me and my friends think your
josé jiménez imitation is a okay 
but what you re doing with it is b a d 
you re right  you re absolutely right 
you ever have any explosions doing this 
all the time  it s a mess 
tell me something else  mr  gonzalez 
how am i doing 
i think you re gonna make it 
i think you re gonna be an astronaut 
after a long   
   and unprecedented
series of evaluations   
   which told our medical scientists   
   of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight   
   it is my pleasure to introduce to you   
   seven americans   
   gentlemen all 
virgil i   gus  grissom 
leroy g  cooper 
donald k  slayton 
john h  glenn  junior 
malcolm s  carpenter 
alan b  shepard  junior 
walter m  schirra  junior 
america s mercury astronauts 
holy shit 
smile  gus  we re heroes 
yeager ought to see this 
seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers   
   and they haven t done a thing
but show up for a press conference 
following the distribution of the kits 
those of you who have p m  deadlines   
   better dash to your phones 
now we ll have some questions
from the press  please 
i d like to know
whether your wives and children   
   had anything to say about this 
mine think it s fine 
they re all for it 
i don t think any of us could go on
with something like this   
   if we didn t have
pretty good backing at home 
my wife s attitude towards this
has been the same   
   as it s been all along through my flying 
if it s what i want to do  she s behind it 
and  by golly  my kids are  too 
100 percent 
i don t believe this 
but look at them out there 
they re eating it up 
i was brought up believing
that you are placed on earth   
   more or less with a 50 50 proposition 
this is what i still believe 
we re placed here with certain talents
and capabilities   
   and it s up to each one of us
to use those talents as best we can 
and if we use our talents properly   
   i think there is a power
greater than us that will place   
   the opportunities in our way 
when i think of orville and wilbur wright   
   standing on a hill
at kitty hawk  north carolina   
   tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight   
   and then i think of us here today   
   i thank god i live in a country   
   where the best and finest in a man
can be brought out 
i d like to second some of the things
mr  glenn has said here 
i think that we are all very 
very fortunate   
   that we have been 
should we say   blessed    
   with the talents for something like this 
and i think that we would be most remiss
in our duty indeed   
   if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is   
   for our country   
   and to the world in general right now 
one of our air force boys 
don t you agree  deke 
i absolutely agree with gordo 
but we re not saying anything new 
we re just saying the same things   
   that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction 
can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly 
as far as church goes   
   i attend regularly 
which one of you will be
the first into space 
the best will be first 
share it  brother 
fucking a  bubba 
this is for america s life magazine 
these are the greatest pilots in america 
how much do they make 
 7 000  8 000 a year 
  tops 
  at the most 
with this one deal
i m giving them  500 000   
   split seven ways over three years 
how does that sound 
now i want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories 
these stories will appear in life
under their own by lines 
for example   
    by betty grissom    
   or   by   
    virgil i  grissom  
what was that 
gus 
nobody calls me by that other name 
gus 
an astronaut named gus 
what s your middle name 
ivan 
maybe   
    gus  isn t so bad 
might be something there 
all right  you can be gus 
i bet for all that money
they could call you virgil 
they sure could me 
well  what s with her 
she seems snobby 
i don t get it 
i get it  she s  mrs  clean marine  
i m going to the cape tomorrow 
i wish to heck it wasn t off limits to wives 
there s so much work to do  anyway 
more tests   
   training   
   studying 
what about after 
after hours i ll run a lot 
i m going to get up to five miles a day 
there s a beautiful  long beach there 
it s called cocoa beach 
you can run forever 
scott carpenter will run with me 
he s a good guy 
he s real philosophical 
what about    
the others want to get the job done and
keep the mickey mouse to a minimum 
they re good men 
good men 
they ll give 100 percent
when the time comes 
guess they think i m kind of a   
   gung ho type 
 eddie attaboy  
 harry hairshirt  
what  you agree 
you agree 
my own wife 
do you think i m a  dudley doright  
that s me  i guess 
a lonely beacon of restraint   
   and self sacrifice
in a squall of car crazies 
it s important to america
to get a man up there first 
i plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket 
what is the most important thing
in rocket travel 
to me the most important thing   
   is the blast off 
i always take a blast before i take off 
otherwise i wouldn t go near it 
he loves ed sullivan 
four down  three to go 
i don t want anything to put this program
in a bad light 
we have the opportunity of a lifetime
and i m sorry  but i won t stand by   
   and let other people compromise
the whole darned thing 
you know and i know this could lead
to something very unfortunate 
i m talking about the playing around
that s going on 
i m talking about the young girls 
i m talking about the cookies 
i m talking about keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry 
mr  glenn  you are way out of line 
i advise you not to try to foist your
moral views on anyone else in this group 
each man here has volunteered to do a job 
each man is devoting long hours
of training   
   and doing many things above
and beyond the call of duty   
   such as morale tours of factories   
such as bringing girls up to your room 
and forgoing any orderly family life 
mr  glenn  as long
as a man uses good sense   
   what he does with his wick
is his own business 
i m from life magazine 
i m not with these people 
you can t go in 
they re discussing scientific problems 
john s right  whether we like it or not
we re public figures 
whether we deserve it or not 
people look up to us 
we have a tremendous responsibility 
you can t tell a pilot what to do
when he s not flying 
wait a minute  you got it all wrong 
the issue here ain t pussy 
the issue here is monkey 
us  we are the monkey 
what gus is saying is
that we re missing the point 
gus is saying that we all heard rumors
they want to send a monkey up first 
none of us wants them to send
a monkey up to do a man s work 
what gus is saying is that   
   what they re trying to do to us
is send a man up to do a monkey s work 
us  a bunch of
college trained chimpanzees 
what gus is saying is that
we ve got to change things around here 
he s saying that we are pilots 
we know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else 
so what we have to do
is alter the experiment 
it comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on 
what gus is saying here is
that we ve got to stick together on this 
these tests were designed   
   to decondition  to desensitize   
   to adapt out fears 
since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle   
   all we seek from the occupants   
   of the capsule is data 
the so called astronaut   
   would merely be a redundant component 
and here you can see   
   these chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men 
and they are much more cooperative 
they are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training 
as far as we are concerned 
the question still remains 
which one will be first 
the man or   
   the monkey 
we shall see 
take it easy with that 
  where are you putting the window 
  window 
there is no window 
no window 
what about the hatch 
we need a hatch with explosive bolts 
that we can open ourselves 
there s something you don t understand 
this is the final form of the capsule 
no hatch 
what would happen
if the automatic controls went out 
with backups  checks 
this would not happen 
i said  what would happen if it did 
the pilot would have to fly it back 
this is the way it is 
i wonder how the press will feel about this 
the press  what does the press
have to say about this 
do you boys know
what makes this bird go up 
funding makes this bird go up 
that s right  no bucks   
   no buck rogers 
and the press over there   
they all want to see buck rogers 
and that s us 
buck rogers 
you see  those fellows over there
have been making us out   
   as the seven finest and bravest pilots
in all america 
if the story would come out in the press   
   that we are not allowed to fly as pilots   
we want a window 
there could maybe be   
   in future capsules a window   
   here 
no  that s where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes 
the hatch with the explosive   
there could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule 
that is a spacecraft  sir 
we do not refer to it as a  capsule  
spacecraft 
a hatch with explosive bolts on the   
   spacecraft 
and there will be pitch and yaw thrusters
to enable the occupant   
the pilot 
astronaut pilot 
the astronaut   
   pilot   
   to have some   
   to have   
   control   
   of the re entry procedures 
we appreciate it 
you wouldn t mind if we had the press
take a few photos of us  would you 
which one of you is going to be
the first one to be launched into space 
here he is 
captain ham 
grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato 
does he look like the kind of guy
who d put doo doo in the capsule 
ham in a can 
america s first astronaut  look at him 
you take a monkey like this 
you can make him into a great astronaut 
i think he s better looking than crossfield 
how would you like to go up
with this guy as your copilot 
they ve got a man up there  it s gagarin 
we know  sit down 
all right  give them a break 
is it true you were ready to go
and the flight was cancelled 
is it true we could ve beaten the russians 
why didn t we send a man up
instead of a monkey 
i think we ought to be   
   forthright  gracious 
and magnanimous and say   
   the russians beat the pants off us 
no sense in kidding ourselves about it 
but the space age has begun 
and there s plenty of work 
who will be the second man in space 
you mean who will be
the first free man into space 
we know it ll be glenn  just tell us when 
that s a secret 
i m tired of being  forthright 
gracious  and magnanimous  
i m tired of stupid questions
from the press 
i m tired of smocks 
of engineers telling us what we can t do 
i m tired of everybody saying
we are not pilots 
i m tired of monkeys 
most of all  i m sick and tired
of being second to those   
   those darned russians  it s time we   
got someone up there 
fucking a  bubba 
  exactly 
  let s talk to them 
let s get this thing on the road 
i m tired of messing around 
we ll just tell  em we re ready 
we re ready to go 
in these three weeks since the russian
gagarin s flight surprised everybody   
   one wretched event
has followed another 
people have begun to say
our rockets always blow up   
   our boys always botch it 
some say this is not the time to try
desperate deeds to beat the soviets 
the question really is 
are we actually ready
to launch a man into space 
and yet out here at this very moment
sits a rocket  waiting in the night 
soon  one american astronaut
will climb atop that rocket   
   in what may be the greatest
death defying stunt ever broadcast 
the identity of america s first astronaut
has been kept a secret   
   until almost the final moment 
the question everyone has asked is 
which one will be first 
not very funny  john 
but i do appreciate it  john 
i surely do 
vaya con dios  josé 
dear lord  please don t let me fuck up 
i didn t quite copy that  say again  please 
i said  everything s a okay 
well  that s what i thought you said 
he said everything is a okay 
he says everything is a okay 
and there you have it 
roger  auto retro jettison switch 
retro heater switch    off 
retro heater switch    off 
landing bag switch    auto 
roger  landing bag switch    auto 
this is it  ladies  this is for life magazine 
my god  they re going
after the diaper service man 
we don t have a diaper service man 
oh  louise  your lawn 
why are they here 
what do they want 
we are here live at the house
of louise shepard   
   wife of astronaut al shepard 
who is about to go into space 
wanted to keep you informed 
mrs  shepard 
everything s a okay 
nothing to worry about 
just some delays 
what kind of delays 
there s another hold from nasa 
another delay 
and alan shepard sits there
patiently waiting 
what can be going through
a man s mind at this moment 
i have to urinate 
urinate 
urinate  no  we did not think of that 
this is only a 15 minute flight 
the man s been up there for hours 
could he do it in his suit 
it might be dangerous 
to introduce liquid   
   into the pure oxygen of the capsule
and the pressure suit   
   might cause a short circuit 
it could start a fire 
no  tell him he cannot 
listen  old buddy  they promise
we ll stop at the next gas station 
request that you remain
in a holding pattern till then 
  you sure you just want a little smidgen 
  about a half a cup 
  and nothing in it 
  that s fine 
all right 
alan had four cups of coffee
before he went to work this morning 
all this waiting is driving me crazy 
i had a little accident 
request permission to relieve bladder 
look  the man has got to go 
it s either that or we get the lug wrench
and pry him out 
do it in the suit 
josé  permission granted   
   to wet your diapers anytime  son 
suit thermometer says
freon flow jumping from 30 to 45 
left lower chest sensor 
no shortout  moving up back 
well   
i m a wetback now 
it is questionable if we can proceed 
i m cooler than you are  why don t you
fix your problems and light this candle 
he s right  let s light this candle 
he surely is  light the candle 
resume the countdown 
t minus ten seconds   
   nine  eight  seven   
ignition 
you re on your way  josé 
we have liftoff  and the clock is operating 
i think we ll be able to talk
to one of the astronaut wives   
   if not to louise shepard herself 
he has re entered the earth s atmosphere
and the g forces should be building up 
louise  he s coming down 
we almost missed this 
eight 
that s nine 
i m okay 
the vice president 
who is chairman of our space council   
   and who bears great responsibilities
in this field   
   the members of the house and senate   
   space committee 
who are here today to award you   
   this decoration 
which has gone from the ground up 
what was jackie like 
she s very nice 
we talked about all kinds of things 
my gus goes up next 
i can t wait to talk to jackie after that 
you ll love her  she s so nice 
we talked about the kids 
mr  shepard  sign here 
i never realized   
   a gruff  mean son of a bitch like you
could be so popular 
how d you get to go up before me 
even before  mr  clean  the marine  
charm  hot dog  pure charm 
watch this 
hey  sis  how are you doing 
so so  how are you doing 
i ain t doing anymore 
damn thing s dragging in the mud 
and i can t get it up 
charm  gus  that s pure charm 
how d you like one of these 
i can get one of those from a dime store 
not one that s been in outer space 
i m taking these up with me tomorrow 
would you like a souvenir
after i get written in history 
well  i might  if it s been in outer space 
see you after outer space 
you got to think ahead to the future 
folks have a taste for things
that have been there 
i ll give you one of these dimes
i m taking up so you can play with it   
   and dream about outer space 
why don t you just make sure
you don t screw the pooch 
oh  god  look at this 
go get  em  deke 
grissom has just reached the apex
of his flight into outer space   
   and will be coming down
with the valuable data   
   needed for the future flights
that will actually orbit the earth 
he will be re entering the atmosphere now 
liberty bell 7  liberty bell 7 
this is hunt club 1  over 
we re in orbit at this time
around the capsule 
are you ready to come in and hook on 
roger  this is hunt club 1   
   waiting for your okay
to come in and hook on 
roger  i ve unplugged my suit 
so i m kind of warm now 
hunt club 1  roger 
one  roger 
roger  blow the hatch after we hook on 
all right  get ready 
another 15 feet to the right 
if you re ready for me to blow the hatch   
   i ll take my helmet off 
say again  liberty bell 
waiting for your okay to hook on 
who designed this 
say again  liberty bell  we can t hear you 
i can t get it off 
liberty bell  say again 
this is hunt club 1  waiting for your okay 
what happened 
it s all right  he s okay 
go for the capsule 
help  i m sinking 
get the capsule  he can float in that suit 
we need the data in the capsule 
throw down a line 
help  throw down the line 
hey  i m sinking 
forget the fucking capsule 
we can t pull it  it s full of water 
hey  help me over here 
we ve lost it 
blow the cable 
come back here  damn it 
throw a line down 
i didn t do anything 
i was just lying there 
it just blew 
the hatch just blew 
it must have been a technical malfunction 
the capsule was rocking around a bit 
there were no loose items  i don t see
how i could have hit that button 
i was just lying there  flat on my back   
   and it just blew 
well  what do you think 
explosive hatches have been
on jet fighters for ten years 
the things have been wrung inside out   
   subjected to trial by heat 
by water  by shaking  pounding 
we even drop them from a height
of 100 feet onto concrete   
   and not one of them
has ever  just blown  
are we going to the white house 
isn t the president coming 
no ticker tape parade in new york 
not even one in mitchell  indiana 
no jackie 
by order of the president
of the united states   
   the distinguished service medal   
   is awarded to captain virgil i  grissom   
   who distinguished himself by valor
above and beyond the call of duty 
these actions   
   reflect great credit upon himself   
   the air force   
   and the united states of america 
you proud  boys 
hey  look  they filled up the refrigerator 
pretty good  huh 
pretty good 
a full refrigerator 
i can see this afternoon
is shaping up just great 
and the rest of the day  tomorrow  too 
what do they want me to do in here 
cook 
then risk my life and my kids    
   by dragging them across that highway
to the worst beach in florida 
oh  gus  i wanted to eat
in the white house 
i wanted to talk to jackie about   
   things 
well  look  i ve got to go
to the holiday inn for some   
   beer call with the guys 
all those years of test flying   
   and all those times i waited
and all those times you weren t there 
the military promised   
   and now they are welshing
on that damn compact 
look  i am finally
 mrs  honorable astronaut  
but they are treating me like i m   
   honorable
 mrs  squirming hatch blower  
i didn t do anything wrong 
the hatch just blew  it was a glitch 
it was a technical malfunction 
why in hell won t anyone believe me 
i know that 
gus  i mean are these the goodies 
is this how the military pays off 
oh  gus  they owe you 
but they owe me  too 
they owe me 
they owe me  they owe me so much 
i love you 
we are here with virgil i  grissom
and his lovely wife  betty 
gus has just come back
from the second trip in space 
betty  how do you feel about this trip 
i m so proud of him 
i think he was wonderful 
we re all proud of gus grissom 
gus  how do you feel about the trip 
was it a success 
it was a okay 
my god  he lost his capsule
but he s keeping his story 
to recap yesterday s dramatic events   
   here we see america s
newest hero  gus grissom 
he is shouting to save the capsule first 
pull that in flight test  it s all over for him 
he screwed the pooch  partner 
plain and simple 
sometimes you get a pooch
that can t be screwed 
the president s got his own problems
with the bay of pigs 
he doesn t want
the astronauts  image tarnished 
nothing these guys do
is going to be called a failure 
these astronauts are our davids 
you think the public would know they re
just doing what monkeys have done 
you think a monkey knows he s sitting
on a rocket that might explode 
these astronauts know that 
i ll tell you something 
it takes a special man to volunteer
for a suicide mission 
especially when it s on tv 
old gus  he did all right 
though the capsule was lost 
our new hero   
   astronaut gus grissom  was saved 
now president kennedy has started
an even more ambitious space program 
those who came before us   
   made certain this country   
   rode the first waves
of the industrial revolution   
   the first waves of modern invention   
   and the first wave of nuclear power 
and this generation does not intend   
   to founder in the backwash   
   of the coming age of space 
we mean to be a part of it 
we mean to lead it 
you know  i always hated flying 
when i met you  you were already a pilot 
so i never had a complaint coming 
when you went up in those planes 
me and the kids   
we never had any insurance
except a couple months  pay 
i always hated all that talk
about insurance 
the government spends
all kinds of time and money   
   teaching pilots how to be fearless 
but they don t spend a penny
teaching you how to be   
   the fearless wife of a test pilot 
but i guess i liked it 
i guess i liked the kind of man who could   
   push the outside of the envelope 
flyboy 
but i never could stand a man
who was one of those  remember whens  
those bitter guys that just sit around
thinking about old times 
if i ever see that happen   
   i m going right out the front door 
and you ll never catch me 
i m a fearless man 
but i m scared to death of you 
no  you re not 
but you ought to be 
what is it 
the russians have sent titov up 
titov s up 
how long 
a day 
a day  a whole day 
he s orbiting over our country right now 
we need a man in orbit or it s all over 
we re scrapping the redstone
and going with the atlas 
you know what that means 
we haven t had too much luck
with that rocket 
we can t take all the precautions we d like 
  it ll be dangerous 
  we re ready 
i said it ll be dangerous 
i said we re ready  100 percent 
inside this trim 
modest suburban home is annie glenn   
   wife of astronaut john glenn   
   sharing the anxiety and pride
of the world at this tense moment   
   but in a private and crucial way
that only she can understand 
the vice president would like
to see mrs  glenn 
he s asking for you again 
tell them no 
i m sorry  she says no 
you don t understand  it is very important 
the vice president must see her 
we are told after the mission s success   
   the vice president will come here
and speak with annie glenn 
meanwhile  john glenn waits
for the weather to clear   
   so he can undertake this historic mission 
you know what the russians want 
they want our peckers in their pockets 
she still says no 
didn t you tell her i ll bring in abc tv   
   nbc tv  cbs tv 
her words  and mine 
will be heard by millions 
where are they going 
i think the flight s been cancelled 
cancelled 
that s perfect 
i will go in and console her
on nationwide tv

the vice president s head of the program 
you must think of the program 
you are out of line 
  i m out of line 
  yes  sir 
i run the show here 
we ll see about that 
and i m thinking of changing
the order of flight assignments 
who will you get 
you heard what he said 
take it easy  fellows 
step aside  pal 
pilots 
pansies  cows 
gladiolas 
isn t there anybody
who can deal with a housewife 
waltzing matilda

we don t know who wrote it 
it s australian  right 
who are you guys 
we re aborigines 
who are you 
me 
i m an astronaut 
well  what do you do here  astronaut 
i m here because a buddy of mine
is getting ready to   
   fly overhead  up in outer space 
and i ll be talking to him on that dish 
fly over 
you blokes do that  too 
you do that yourself 
not me  mate 
see that old bloke there 
he know 
he know the moon 
he know the star 
and he know the milky way 
he ll give you a hand 
he know 
we re gonna need all the help we can get 
stand by for final ten second count 
the clock is operating 
we re underway 
good lord  ride all the way 
godspeed  john glenn 
zero g  and i feel fine 
the capsule is turning around 
the view is tremendous 
i can see clear back 
a big cloud pattern  towards the cape 
it s a beautiful sight 
roger  friendship 7 
you have a go  at least seven orbits 
roger  al  understand 
go at least seven orbits 
this is friendship 7 
speed is 17 500 miles per hour   
   and we re moving into night 
full moon rising 
i can almost touch it 
friendship 7  come in  do you read 
friendship 7  come in  please 
this sure was a short day 
say again  please  over 
that was the shortest day i ve run into 
kind of passes rapidly  huh 
i can see some lights down there
in australia  gordo 
where are they from 
all of perth and rockingham
have turned their lights on for you 
and we have a few other lights turned on 
here and there 
they show up very well 
thank everybody for turning them on 
will you 
we sure will  john  we sure will 
heading towards daybreak 
lot of cloud coverage today 
man  it s beautiful 
possibly it s the heat shield 
it s loose 
if it comes off   
if the heat shield comes off  he ll burn up 
he ll fry when he tries to re enter 
muchea  this is cape 
we re showing some trouble 
we ve got a warning light 
possibly a loose heat shield 
check your status lights immediately 
he s coming 
john  can you hear me 
friendship 7  come in  please 
try something  anything 
friendship 7  come in 
this is friendship 7  do you read me 
wait a second 
i see something strange out here 
oh  my goodness  what the heck is that 
sparks and needles of some kind
all over the sky 
hey  let me tell you what i m in up here 
i m in a mass of very small particles   
   that are brilliantly lit up 
like they re luminescent 
i never saw anything like it 
a shower of them coming by me now 
they re bright yellow 
they swirl around the capsule   
   and they re brilliantly lighted 
do you think they could be alive 
it sounds ridiculous 
but they look like fireflies or something 
maybe some air force experiment
went amuck 
could our astronomers have been wrong 
hello  capcom  do you read me 
this is miraculous 
could it be those fireflies 
or whatever they are 
of course not  fireflies 
roger  friendship 7 
will you correlate the actions
of the surrounding particles   
   with that of your control jets 
negative 
i do not think they were coming
from my control jets 
i ll tell you what i ll try to do 
i ll try to get some pictures
of these little guys 
sounds like a good idea 
you guys probably think i m nuts 
they re very beautiful 
look like fireflies on a summer night 
they just dance around 
get out of here 
get out of here  you gadgets 
heading into daybreak now  another day 
leaving the fireflies behind 
i have no idea what they were 
this is friendship 7 
that was some night 
that was really exciting 
he s going into his third orbit 
how much longer are you going
to keep him in the dark 
what do we tell him 
he s a pilot 
tell him the condition of his craft 
glenn is in his third orbit   
   and the flight is going
pretty much as planned 
no human individual   
   has ever been so well prepared 
so far the key word
on this textbook flight is  operational  
everything is a okay 
we haven t been too lucky
with the atlas rocket 
some say we haven t taken all
the safety precautions we d like to 
is this true 
no  it s absolutely not true 
the only critical point is the re entry 
if the capsule is not at the correct angle   
   with the blunt end and heat shield down 
it will burn up 
there is only one hope 
it might be possible to leave
the retro rocket package   
   which covers the heat shield  on 
the straps may be strong enough
to hold the heat shield in place 
but if this fails   
john  you re going to
fly by wire for re entry 
we recommend you do the best
you can to keep a zero angle  over 
re entry only three orbits 
that is correct 
do you have a reason for this 
not at this time 
this is the judgement of cape flight 
do you have a time for going
to jettison retro  over 
we are not sure your landing bag
is deployed 
we feel it is possible to re enter
with the retropackage on 
we see no difficulty at this time
with that type of re entry 
do you read 
roger 
understand 
i ll start lining up as carefully as i can
in a minute 
see whether scanners will pick up
and correct it for good retro fire attitude 
if not   
   i ll correct it myself 
we re lined up 
here we go 
what s that sound 
humming  it s him 
it s all right  he does that 
he can t hear you 
he s hit the ionization blackout 
no communications are possible
for a few minutes 
then we ll know 
friendship 7  this is cape  do you read 
this is cape  do you read 
friendship 7  this is cape  do you read 
automatic systems are not functioning 
he s in fly by wire   
finally showed up 
the one with the big engine 
boy  if we d only had
one of those a few years back 
the bad news is the entire program s
probably going to be scrapped 
from now on  the astronaut boys
in houston have got the only ticket 
barring  of course  some unforeseen event 
the russians set a new record
of 114 000 feet   
   going straight off the ground 
nobody cares about
that kind of record anymore 
all they want now
is capsules up in outer space 
i get a feeling this plane might be able
to beat that russian record 
you might be right 
and here they come 
looky here what i brought you 
smile  hon 
my fellow citizens   
   america s mercury astronauts 
welcome to houston  your new home 
your neighbors here and i 
we d like to give you this little barbecue   
   texas style 
since you re relocating here 
to show appreciation for all you ve done   
   mr  sharp is contributing the land   
   the contractors the homes   
   and department stores  the furnishings 
which one are you 
which one s glenn  i want to meet him 
he s over there 
i m going to the moon 
i swear to god  i m on my way 
hi  little gal 
damned glad to meet you  too 
i heard an awful lot of good things
about you  gal 
we got it 
steak  all the trimmings 
just like pancho s 
steak tastes about the same   
   only there s a lot
more trimmings now  gus 
you know  it s funny 
here i am  i got  25 000 a year
for a magazine contract 
i got a free house with all the furnishings 
got me a corvette 
i got a free lunch from one end of america
to the other   
   and i ain t even been up there yet 
i noticed that 
oh  you noticed that 
you noticed i hadn t been up there yet 
they re saving the best for last 
yeah  i guess so  hot dog  i guess so 
just watch you don t screw the pooch 
we re talking to gordon cooper 
he will be the next to orbit the earth 
since you re the last of the original seven
and the least well known   
   could you begin by telling us
who was the best pilot you ever saw 
who is the best pilot i ever saw 
who is the best pilot i ever saw 
i ll tell you 
i ve seen a lot of them 
and most of them were pictures on a wall   
i said   pictures on a wall  
back at some place that   
   doesn t even exist anymore 
some of them are   
   right here in this room 
and some of them are   
   they re still out there somewhere 
doing what they always do 
going up each day
in a hurtling piece of machinery   
   putting their hides out on the line   
   hanging it out over the edge   
   pushing back the outside
of that envelope and hauling it back 
but there was   
   one pilot i once saw who i think
truly did have the right   
how close did you ever come
to not hauling it back 
who is the best pilot i ever saw 
well  you re looking at him 
you got any beemans 
i might have me a stick 
loan me some  i ll pay you back later 
fair enough 
think i see a plane over here
with my name on it 
now you re talking 
hey  what s that 
anyone got clearance 
what kind of a plane is that 
aircraft on ramp  did you file a flight plan 
aircraft on ramp  did you file a flight plan 
i m taking her up to wring her out a bit 
any objections 
it s yeager 
no objections 
you are clear to taxi 
he must have clearance  right 
yeah  sure  he must 
it s here someplace 
now  in honor of   
   these  the greatest pilots
in the history of mankind   
   it gives me great pleasure  great pride 
to present to you   
   miss sally rand 
stretch it  stretch it 
you can do it 
just a little bit more 
104 000  here you go 
christ almighty 
sir  over there 
is that a man 
yeah  you re damn right it is 
we hate to disturb you  buddy  but   
   we ve got a launch 
there s millions of people watching 
and we thought maybe   
yep  well  no sweat  let s go 
i m ready when you are  john  100 percent 
ten    nine   
go 
go  hot dog  go 
 up we go into the wild blue yonder  
thirty seconds and fuel is go 
oxygen is go   
   cabin pressure on the top peg 
altimeter is working 
have a good ride  buddy  go 
the sun is coming through the window 
oh  lord  what a heavenly light 
the mercury program was over 
four years later 
astronaut gus grissom was killed   
   along with astronauts white
and chaffee   
   when fire swept through
their apollo capsule 
but on that glorious day in may  1963   
   gordo cooper went higher  farther   
   and faster than any other american 
twenty two complete orbits
around the world
