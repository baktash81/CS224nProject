there s no other way 
you ve got to give them the key
to everything that s yours 
otherwise  what s the point 
and  for a while  i believed
that s the kind of love i had 
     choir singing  
before i ever ran a casino 
or got myself blown up   
ace rothstein was a hell
of a handicapper  i can tell you that 
i was so good that whenever i bet 
i could change the odds   
for every bookmaker
in the country 
i m serious 
i had it down so cold   
that i was given
paradise on earth 
i was given one of the biggest casinos
in las vegas to run  the tangiers   
by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money   
 62 700 000 
i don t know all the details 
  man  2 narrating  
nobody knew all the details 
but it should ve been perfect 
i mean  he had me  nicky santoro 
his best friend  watching his ass   
and he had  ginger 
the woman he loved  on his arm 
but in the end 
we fucked it all up 
it should ve been so sweet too 
but it turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us   
were ever given anything
that fuckin  valuable again 
  ace  
at that time  vegas was a place
where millions of suckers   
flew in every year
on their own nickel   
and left behind
about a billion dollars 
but at night  you couldn t see
the desert that surrounds las vegas 
but it s in the desert where lots
of the town s problems are solved 
  nicky   got a lot of holes
in the desert   
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes 
except you gotta do it right 
i mean  you gotta have
the hole already dug   
before you show up
with a package in the trunk 
otherwise  you re talking about
a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin  
and who knows who s gonna
be comin  along in that time 
before you know it 
you gotta dig a few more holes 
you could be there
all fuckin  night 
     scatting  
  horn honking  
     scatting continues  
  ace   who could resist 
anywhere else in the country
i was a bookie  a gambler   
always lookin  over my shoulder 
hassled by cops  day and night 
but here  i m mr  rothstein 
i m not only legitimate 
but running a casino 
and that s like selling people
dreams for cash 
i hired an old casino pal 
billy sherbert  as my manager 
and i went to work 
   the casino manager  and this is
ronnie  who takes care of the card room 
  ace   for guys like me 
las vegas washes away your sins 
it s like a morality car wash 
it does for us what lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples 
and along with making us legit   
comes cash  tons of it 
i mean  what do you think we re doing
out here in the middle of the desert 
it s all this money 
this is the end resuit
of all the bright lights   
and the comp trips 
of all the champagne   
and free hotel suites 
and all the broads and all the booze 
it s all been arranged
just for us to get your money 
that s the truth about las vegas 
we re the only winners 
the players don t stand a chance 
and their cash flows
from the tables   
to our boxes
through the cage   
and into the most sacred room
in the casino 
the place where they add up
all the money   
the holy of holies 
the count room 
  now  this place was off limits 
  verify 3 000 
even i couldn t get inside 
but it was my job to keep it filled
with cash  that s for sure 
  nicky   they had so much
fuckin  money in there   
you could build a house out
of stacks of hundred dollar bills 
and the best part
was that upstairs   
  the board of directors didn t
know what the fuck was going on 
  five thousand 
i mean  to them everything
looked on the up and up 
right  wrong 
verify 5 000 
  the guys inside the counting room   
  five thousand 
were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry 
they d do short counts 
they d lose fill slips 
they d even take cash
right out of the drop boxes 
and it was up to this guy
right here   
standin  in front
of about two million dollars   
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody gettin  wise   
  the lrs or anybody 
  verify 200 
now  notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything 
somehow  somebody s always
lookin  the other way 
now  look at these guys 
they look busy  right 
they re countin  money 
who wants to bother them 
i mean  god forbid they should make
a mistake and forget to steal 
meanwhile 
you re in and you re out 
past the jag off guard
who gets an extra c note a week   
just to watch the door 
it s routine  business as usual 
in  out  hello  good bye 
and that s all there is to it 
just another fat fuck walkin  out
of the casino with a suitcase 
now that suitcase was goin 
straight to one place 
right to kansas city 
which was as close   
to las vegas as the midwest
bosses could go   
without gettin  themselves arrested 
that suitcase was all   
the bosses ever wanted 
  and they wanted it every month 
  hey  john  how was your ride 
now this old mormon fuck here   
he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month  nice and easy 
  somethin  smells good 
  yeah  they made us somethin  to eat 
the bosses would come
from all over the place 
detroit  cleveland  milwaukee   
all over the midwest 
and they would meet in the back
of this produce market in kansas city 
i mean  nobody even knew it 
one of the guys made
his mother do all the cookin  
  do you ever see that guy
jerry steriano 
  jerry steriano 
now  these old greaseballs
might not look it   
but believe me   
these are the guys
who secretly control las vegas 
mama  that man s here again 
because they control
the teamsters union 
and that s where you had to go if you
wanted to borrow money to buy a casino 
  would you put in shrimp 
  i would 
here you are  gentlemen 
nobody got a teamsters  loan
unless the guys in this room   
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases 
guys like this antique over here 
out of detroit 
or especially guys like remo gaggi 
the outfit s top boss 
you got a round figure on it 
  definitely the most
important guy in this room 
  about 20 pounds 
  that s around 700 000 
  uh huh  good 
  man   i know it s
a little early for las vegas   
  laughter  
but i do want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry 
  ace   as far as the world
was concerned   
andy stone  the head of
the teamsters  pension fund   
  was a legitimate guy 
  this is a very auspicious occasion 
  a powerful man 
  philip  if you would rise 
he even played golf
with the president 
on behalf of the teamsters 
pension fund   
  it is my pleasure to present to you   
  but andy also took orders 
and when he was told to give
a pension fund loan to philip green   
this check for  62 700 000   
for the new tangiers 
he did what he was told 
  nicky   now  here was
the perfect front man 
what the fuck else could he be 
he didn t know too much 
he didn t want to know
too much   
especially that the bosses made
the teamsters lend him the money 
he wanted to believe
the teamsters   
gave him all that fuckin  money
 cause he was smart 
i know full well how much competition
we have in this great city 
and where they got green from 
who the fuck knows 
all i know is that green was
an arizona real estate hustler   
who barely had
enough gas money   
to come and pick up
his own fuckin  check 
and of course it was
the bosses  man   
andy stone 
who gave all the orders 
not the chairman
of the fuckin  board  philip green 
i understand 
i understand 
now all they needed was   
somebody they could trust
to run the casino 
and who better than ace  i mean  he was
already in vegas a couple years   
and he had
the fuckin  place clocked 
but typical ace  give him a shot
at runnin  a casino   
and he tries
to talk you out of it 
i don t know if i could do this
even if i wanted to 
the gaming commission
would never give me a license 
i have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me 
you don t have to have a license
to work in a casino 
all you gotta do
is apply for one 
the state law says that
you can work in a casino   
while they re processing
your application 
they got a ten year backlog 
what happens when
they do find out 
why would they
want to find out 
we re puttin  a hundred million
into this desert 
why would they want to lock us out 
they ll never find out  all you gotta do
is keep changing your job title 
like  uh  from casino executive
to food and beverage chairman 
they take your application 
they put it at the bottom of the pile 
i know guys been workin  there
for 30 years  don t have a license 
it s a tough proposition  andy 
you know if i did it 
i d have to run it my way 
you got it 
i m serious  no interference 
nobody s gonna interfere
with your running the casino 
i guarantee it 
  nicky   and that s how
they got ace to take over 
they wanted him because ace ate 
slept and breathed gambling 
they worked out
a real cute job title too   
tangiers public relations director 
but the only thing he ever
directed was the casino 
he made his first bet when he was
15 years old  and he always made money 
but he didn t bet
like you or me 
you know  havin  some fun
with it  shit like that 
where the hell
did you learn how to deal 
he bet like a fuckin 
brain surgeon 
place the checks properly 
  that s the way you do it 
  yes  sir 
he had to know everything 
this guy 
he d find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew   
and that s what he d put
his money on 
even back home  years ago   
when we were first hangin  out   
he d know if the quarterback
was on coke   
i ll take columbia for 20 
  if his girlfriend was knocked up 
  twenty dimes on columbia 
he d get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals 
he even figured out
the different bounce   
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used   
on college basketball courts 
you know 
he d be workin 
on this shit day and night 
there was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn t know 
ace got down at six 
get me down at six 
season after season   
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner i ever knew 
but he was so serious
about it all   
that i don t think
he ever enjoyed himself 
but that s just the way he was 
but back then  the bosses
didn t give a fuck   
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not 
to them  he was
a cash register 
all they had to do was
ring the bell and take money 
especially remo   
who was a fuckin  degenerate
gambler who always lost   
cazzo 
  mumbles in italian  
all those fuckin  sweeps 
  unless ace made his bets 
  enough now 
ace made more money
for them on a weekend   
than i could do heisting
joints for a month 
whatever ace picked up
on the street  he told remo 
i mean  fixed fights 
doped horses   
crooked fuckin  zebras 
locked in point spreads 
he told fuckin  remo everything 
and to tell you the truth 
i don t blame him 
  hey 
  keepin  remo happy with money   
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world 
son of a bitch 
how the hell did you get
oklahoma michigan 
nobody ever had oklahoma mi  
how the hell d you do it 
well  that s why
they paid so well

nicky just hit him 
no matter how big a guy might be 
nicky would take him on 
you beat nicky with fists 
he comes back with a bat 
you beat him with a knife 
he comes back with a gun 
and if you beat him with a gun 
you better kill him   
because he ll keep coming
back and back   
until one of you is dead 
  nicky   listen 
with me protectin  ace   
he made a fortune
for the bosses 
i mean  that s
what got him to vegas 
he was a money machine 
a tremendous earner
for these guys 
as soon as he took over 
he doubled the fuckin  drop 
with ace  the casino
never saw so much money 
and the bosses 
they couldn t be happier 
  i got  700  
  don t you mess with me  
  but you know i m down  
  everybody knows i m down   
  ace   in vegas  i had to keep
a few juiced in local cowboys working 
they were close to the 
you know  good old boys 
i mean  without us  these guys 
they d still be shoveling mule shit 
ward  you ve got to keep
a cleaner space 
lf you need mr  clean 
page him  all right 
won t happen again  sam 
  mr  rothstein 
  mr  rothstein  won t
happen again  mr  rothstein 
ls this guy just another dumb fucking
white man  or what  what s the story 
  you need this guy 
  can t get rid of him 
he s juiced in 
he s the county commissioner s cousin 
i wouldn t give the bum
a mop job 
but still  i had no choice 
i had to take care of them 
these yokels ran the state 
thank you very much 
senator 
  they passed the laws 
they owned the courts 
  hi  ace  hey  i need a room 
  i had dozens of politicians
and state officials   
  the cedar room 
coming through that place
every week 
  help the senator 
get him whatever he wants 
  certainly 
why not make him happy 
   the presidential suite 
for politicians like our state senator
up there  everything was on the house 
these guys won their comp life
when they got elected   
so  hey  why not
take advantage of it 
still  the politicians came cheap 
we could handle them 
it s a whale
like k k  ichikawa   
who plays  30 000 a hand
in baccarat   
that s the one
you really gotta watch 
he plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit   
to turn out your lights 
about a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the cayman lslands 
downstairs he takes us
for two million   
and upstairs he takes free
soap  shampoo and towels 
another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms   
free private jets and
two million of our money 
but we got him back 
i had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz 
i don t know what the hell went wrong 
i m awfully sorry 
i can t understand it  these mechanical
things  you know they happen 
hey  but better here than
up there  you know what i mean 
then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with japan 
i can t believe that there s
a convention  there s no room 
we got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself 
  i m sorry you missed your plane 
  glad to get to know you 
oh  no  no gambling 
and once he was back 
he played small 
he bet 1 000 a hand 
instead of his usual 30 000 a hand 
   to the bank
with a natural lead over a five 
but i knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa   
was that they can t bet
small for long 
he didn t think of it
as winning 10 000   
he thought of it
as losing 90 000 
so  he upped his bets 
until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash 
in the casino  the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing   
and keep them coming back 
the longer they play 
the more they lose 
in the end  we get it all 
  goddamn it
trying to make it real  
  compared to what  
  sock it to me  
in vegas  everybody s
gotta watch everybody else 
six  all right 
who s gonna give me that 
since the players are looking
to beat the casino   
each and every roll 
all right 
  the dealers are watching
the players   
  six 
  fake a six 
  the boxmen are watching the dealers 
the floormen are watching
the boxmen   
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen   
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses   
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses   
i m watching the casino manager   
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all 
plus  we had
a dozen guys up there   
most of them ex cheats  who knew
every trick in the house

    ace   ginger s mission
in life was money 
  i ll be right back 
  see you  ginger 
  okay  thank you for asking 
she was a queen
around the casino 
she brought in high rollers   
and helped them spread
around a lot of money 
  hello 
  hey  ginger  how you doing 
great  and i have something for you 
you got me covered 
  and you do  thank you very much 
  take care of yourself 
  i got some lucky pills for you  andy 
  oh  yeah 
who didn t want ginger 
she was one of the best known   
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town 
smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake   
for two or three days
before sending him home broke   
to the little woman
and his bank examiners 
  you only make me glad  
  better listen  little girl  
  you re goin  walkin 
down the street  
  i ain t got no love  
any change 
oh  i hit a few games
on the way back 
but that was all bullshit 
she just pocketed the cash 
  this heart of stone  
  how you doin  tonight 
  good 
  how are you 
  uh  beat 
    ace   ginger had the hustlers code 
  take one for you 
  thank you 
  she knew how to take care of people 
and that s what vegas
is all about 
  sixty eight hundred 
  thanks 
  it s kickback city 
  have a good night 
thank you  you too 
  she took care of the dealers   
  hey  mitch 
pit bosses  floor managers   
but  mostly  she took care
of the valet parkers   
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything 
ginger took care of the parkers   
because they took care
of the security guards   
  who took care of the metro cops 
who let her operate 
  i need that stuff tonight 
  no problem 
  you are a doll 
the valet parking job
was such a money maker   
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession 
but one thing
i just could never understand   
was that she could have
everything under control   
except for her old pimp
boyfriend  lester diamond 
gin  you know i got other people
in this  they got partners 
i want you to understand
that i am looking out for you   
in this thing  okay 
you re gonna get yours back 
and you re gonna get back first  okay 
  all right  yeah 
  where you going 
where are you  you re
in that place  where are you 
  i m here 
  no  you re not 
where are you 
where are you 
i m always here for you 
  you re my woman 
  i know 
  ace   the ginger i knew wouldn t
even look at this creep 
  good luck 
  yeah 
he was a moocher 
a card cheat   
a country club golf hustler 
a scumbag 
  chasing dentists for a few bucks 
  careful 
the guy was always broke 
he always had a story 
and somehow she could never
turn him down 
the way ginger saw it  i guess 
was that lester was just an unlucky guy 
somebody had
to take care of him 
but nobody
had to take care of nicky 
lf you find any cash in there 
we ll whack it up with you 
i mean  he took care
of himself only too well 
  that s why every badge   
  i folded these things beautifully 
  back home wanted to nail him 
  i would appreciate a little respect 
  look at me  pal 
i gotta live with her 
  jesus christ 
  volare  
even after a little vacation 
they hassled him at the airport 
i mean  frank marino was there
to meet him  but so were the cops 
this time they wanted
to pinch him   
  for some diamond burglary in antwerp 
  will you help me fold these 
they were ready to blame him for
anything  no matter where it happened 
  put your things away 
  and they were usually right 
  hold it  hold it  here 
  because nicky enjoyed
being a gangster 
  and he didn t give a damn who knew it 
  come on  there we go 
look at this  beautiful 
i mean  that s what worried me 
 cause it turns out 
nicky was about to be sent to vegas 
  all right  we re clear 
  there s more 
there s a couple stuck in there 
i know there s more 
  i m telling you  they re out 
  come on 
don t get so defensive 
it could be stuck in your hair 
what s that 
huh  what s that 
there s no more 
thanks  hon 
  nicky   i couldn t wait to get
my hands on vegas 
but the bosses didn t send me
out there to have a good time 
they sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with ace 
and nobody interfered
with the fuckin  skim 
  hey 
  hey  how you doin  
hey  sammy

and this sheriff s
a real cowboy 
even the coppers aren t afraid
to bury people out in the desert here 
i don t care  i wanna get away
from back home for a while 
i m tired of that shit
back there 
look at this place 
it s made of money 
you know what the best part is 
nobody s gonna know what we re doing 
there s nobody here to see us 
everybody s back home 
nick  i gotta tell you 
i got pinched twice for no reason 
i really gotta be careful 
i m running a licensed place 
everything s legit 
don t worry about it 
i m not gonna do anything 
i m especially not gonna
involve you in anything 
  nicky  
ace saw vegas one way   
  you call this guy
and tell him i m comin  
  of course 
but i saw it another 
i saw it as untouched 
i mean  they had bookies  pimps   
and drug dealers
i could shake down 
who the fuck
were they gonna run to 
so i started gettin 
everybody in line 
best of all 
for the first time in my life   
i figured out a way
not to lose 
  ace   yeah  he had
a foolproof scheme  all right 
it wasn t very scientific 
but it worked 
when he won  he collected 
when he lost  he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves 
what were they gonna do 
muscle nicky 
  hey  how you doin  
  how you doin  
  you got that thing for me 
  what thing 
oh  nicky  i thought
you was layin  
no  no  i m takin  
i was takin  
  you sure 
  i m positive 
  i m a little confused 
  you re a little confused 
maybe if i stick your fuckin 
face through this window   
you ll get unconfused 
  gimme the fuckin  money 
  i m sorry  nick 
i didn t mean anything by it 
that s why you had it ready 
you thought i was fuckin  layin  it 
  my fuckin  head 
  smarten up 
and now nicholas santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president 
george washington was born  
  ace   but still 
it was nice and quiet for a while 
ginger and i presented
nicky and jennifer all over town   
like regular ozzie and harriets 
beautiful  you got
a beautiful swing 
  nicky   ace got my son  little nicky 
involved in little league 
turned out to be one
of the other coaches   
was a fuckin 
metro intelligence cop 
but it didn t matter 
it was all about the kids 
he s gotta realize that everything
can t be a home run that he does 
that s exactly what
i keep tellin  him   
but that s the kind of kid he is 
  ace   and nicky being nicky 
he made his presence known 
especially at the casino 
where he definitely did not work   
people got the message 
  nicky   me  that s why
the bosses sent me out here 
they wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint 
like these two fuckin 
balloon heads over here 
they were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin  grand   
  yeah  right  i m sure 
  hey  how are you 
how are you 
what are you doing here 
i m over here now 
  you re over here 
  yeah  i m over here with them 
we re waiting on carmine 
yeah  we re looking
for carmine 
he was here before  he had
a suitcase and then he left 
  carmine left 
  carmine left 
he s gone 
he s not here 
carmine s out 
i think maybe he went
across the street   
or somewhere else
or somethin  
well  listen  good luck
with the joint 
  ah  thanks  eddie 
  yeah  lots of luck 
  yeah  good luck to you too 
  hey  they forgot to sign their papers 
yeah  they don t
need those anymore 
  ace   guys from other crews
got away with a warning 
everybody else  watch out 
like these yokels here   
who never heard of nicky
or the bosses back home 
 cause they re the morons
who give you the most trouble 
even after we d catch them 
they d try sneaking back   
with beards
and wigs and fake noses 
you can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet 
like this guy 
he s bettin  lavender chips   
at 500 each with only
one little problem   
he s always guessed right 
lf he wasn t so fuckin  greedy 
he d have been tougher to spot 
but in the end 
they re all greedy 
  i got a feelin 
about the future  
  and it ain t too good
i know that  
i saw that the dealer was weak 
but he wasn t in on it 
he just wasn t
protecting his hand 
he was lifting
his hole card way too high 
now  here s this guy reading
the dealer s hole card   
and signaling his buddy
at this table 
  electronic beeping  
and that s just what
these hustlers look for 
they cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers   
the way lions
look for weak antelope

and we catch either one of you   
we re gonna break your heads 
and you won t walk out of here 
you see that fuckin  saw 
we re gonna use it  you got it

  thank you 
throw him in the alley and tell
the cops he got hit by a car 
  ace   within no time 
everything was set in place 
we got rid
of the freelance scamsters   
the per was way up 
the gods were happy 
and i decided
to complicate my life 
for a guy who likes sure things   
i was about to bet the rest
of my life on a real long shot 
we re not gettin  any younger 
don t you think it s time 
aren t you gettin  tired
of all this shit 
what  are you trying
to handicap me 
i m gonna do you one better 
i m tryin  to marry you 
you wanna marry me 
i m serious 
i wanna settle down 
i want a family 
you got the wrong girl  sam 
i know i d be a good father 
you d be a good mother 
you don t know me 
you ve known me two 
three months 
i m 43 years old 
i don t want to wait 
i know you well enough
to know that i really love you 
and i can t think
of anybody better to be with 
and i don t feel like
waiting anymore 
you know a lot of happily
married people  sam 
 cause i don t 
yeah  i know all that 
i care about you  okay 
but i just don t have those kind
of feelings for you 
i m sorry 
i m not in love with you 
  all right  all right 
  understand 
sam  i m sorry 
no  i   i  
i mean   i can grow 
as long as there s a mutual respect 
that kind of thing can grow 
i m realistic 
i can accept that 
what is love anyway 
it s a mutual respect 
it s a devotion 
it s a caring
from one person to another 
and if we could set up
some kind of foundation   
based on that mutual respect   
i feel eventually you
would care enough about me   
that i could live
with that 
lf it doesn t work out 
doesn t play out   
then what happens to me 
you know i m doing well now 
and i m gonna do even better 
and so whatever happens   
if it doesn t work out
between us   
i m gonna make sure you re okay
for the rest of your life 
and if there are kids 
especially   
i ll take care of you
better than you d ever imagine 
what are you pitching me 
just what i said 
you ll be set up   
for the rest of your life 
that i can promise you 
want to take a chance 
  applause

because he knew they all wanted

with ace  nobody ever got
a free ride  even ginger 
with her  he still
covered his bets 
they had to have the baby

in the house 
pay attention to me 
  what i m gonna tell you
is very important 
  okay 
all this stuff
doesn t mean anything 
money  this doesn t mean
anything without trust 
i have to be able
to trust you with my life 
  ace   with over a million
in cash and jewels   
tucked in a bank in vegas  only
for ginger  she was secure and happy 
she loved that shit 
but a guy in my line of work has
to have a lot of payoff cash around 
crooked cops and kidnappers 
they don t take checks 
need any help with that 
mr  collins 
so i put two million in cash
in a los angeles bank   
under the name
of mr  and mrs  tom collins 
this was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money 
  ginger laughs  
and since i d either be in jail
or locked in a closet    
when i needed the money
the most   
i gave ginger the only key to the cash
that could get me back alive 
    i ll take you there  
    i m callin   callin   
  callin  for mercy  
    i ll take you there  
    mercy  mercy  
  i ll take you there  
this is a signature card 
so once she signs those papers 
she ll be the only person   
to have total access to the box 
no one else  including myself 
that s right 
that s the way you wanted it 
  banker  
sam  let me ask you a question 
you must really trust your wife 
yeah  sure i do  why 
it s good 
it s just unusual 
tell you the truth 
so many of my clients don t 
    let me take you there  
    i ll take you there  
    ain t no smilin  faces  
    i ll take you there   
  never will i know happiness  
  ace   with ginger and the money
in place  i feit covered 
and to play it safe 
i switched job titles again   
and made myself
food and beverage director 
this way nobody would bother me
about a license 
i mean vegas was
like a dream for me 
trouble was  nicky was dreaming
his own kind of vegas 
  nicky   i put money out on the street
chargin  three points a week 
  don t make us come lookin  for you 
  juice to the fuckin  dealers 
you won t have to look
for me 
i appreciate it 
thanks  nicky 
they were degenerate gamblers 
coke freaks 
in no time i had half the dealers
in the tangiers in my pocket 
then  i started bustin  out
high stakes poker players 
  ace  
it was so obvious 
  all of nicky s half assed
mechanics were signal happy 
  i m gonna open for 500 
  ace  
signaling back and forth 
  poker player   why you cryin 
with two loaves of bread under your arm 
nicky thought nobody was watching him 
but he was wrong 
and i didn t want
any of those agents near my place 
  four aces 
  i can t believe this 
  poker player   lf i didn t have
bad luck  i wouldn t have any luck 
i wished to god nicky and
his whole crew would just get lost 
what am i gonna do 
go back home and start a war 
nicky s a made guy  and i m not 
i can t do that 
be careful  gaming agents
are all over the place 
so i m lucky  i m not allowed
to get lucky in this place 
you ve been lucky all week 
they re looking to nail you 
  nicky   ace was so fuckin  worried
about his casino   
he forgot what we were doin 
out here in the first place 
a million times i wanted to yell
in his fuckin  ear   
 this is las vegas

no  i didn t know that 
but you know what he did 
i walked over to him politely 
and he tells me to fuck myself 
  then he called me a faggot 
  what 
  i threw that cocksucker out 
  hey  come here 
you called my friend a faggot

    grunting  
  grunting continues

you apologize 
you better hope
he lets you back in 
lf you get outta line again 
i ll smash your head so hard   
you won t be able
to get that cowboy hat on 
fuckin  hick 
sammy  listen 
this guy obviously doesn t know
who he was talking to 
he doesn t know that
we re dear friends 
i mean  he s already
very sorry 
but if you could do me a favor
and let him back in   
i swear he ll never
get out of line again 
lf he does it again 
he s out for good 
i don t care what it is 
i ll never let him in the place again 
i m sorry about this  really

motherfucker  you 
you fuck me up over there 
i ll stick you in the desert 
  go over and apologize 
  nicky  i m sorry 
  roaring  
  you re dear to me
yes  sirree  
  nicky   you know 
ace could be a very touchy guy 
especially when
he got bigger in town 
like when he hired
that jonathan and david
and their tigers away from the palace   
by building them a new stage
and giving them a rolls royce 
but i ll tell you  he knew
how to bring in the crowds 
he knew all
the fuckin  angles 
he brought over the whole
 femme fatale  show from paris   
but he forgot how lazy them
european dancing broads can get 
he had to weigh  em in
once a week to make sure
they didn t blow up like balloons 
she s still eight pounds over 
  what s the reason for this 
  mr  rothstein  sir 
never mind the  sir  
why is she eight pounds over 
i m trying to use respect 
mr  rothstein is good enough for you 
well  sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them  
all you do is give me answers 
just give me the right answer 
i guess she s frightened  lf she doesn t
lose weight she may get fired 
that s right  she will get fired 
send her back to paris  
  it s been our policy  
  just stop everything 
  this woman s an institution 
  that s the problem  she s lazy 
  nicky   hey 
i gotta give the guy credit 
i mean  he does
the most obvious thing 
this is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit 
so why not take advantage  right 
so  he took bookie joints
off the street   
and then opened them up
inside the casino 
within a few years
by doing all of this   
he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him 
  ace  
between my innovations   
  look like they re taking
some cat to jail  
and nicky s dedication
to his job   
  steamboats are comin  and
they re splashing and goin   
i soon had the best
operation on the strip 
  moon is shinin 
on friends below  
you gotta watch yourself 
there s a lot of heat on you already 
why 
somebody s complainin  
i m hearing things
from security 
the sheriff s lookin 
to put you in the black book 
that black book
is a bunch of bullshit 
they got two names
from the whole country   
and one of  em
is still al capone 
lf they put you in that book 
you re gonna be in trouble 
you will not be able
to walk into a casino 
i m trying to make a living 
that s all 
i m just tellin  you 
don t say i didn t warn you 
all right 
  man   mrs  rothstein

of the gaming community 
as the head of the
tangiers gaming corporation   
it s my pleasure
to welcome sam rothstein   
to the vegas valley

charming woman you ever saw 
people loved
to be around her

  hi 
you re one of the most
gorgeous women i ve ever seen 
you re a lucky man 
mr  rothstein 
thank you 
thanks for that compliment 
he was a young kid
from the casino 
nice kid 
bright boy 
what balls on this fuckin  kid 
the next day i fired him 
ginger had that effect on people 
i think she even encouraged them 
do you wanna see this one 
ahhhh 
daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much 
  but as much as they loved her   
  oh  fabulous 
they didn t know
what really moved her 
look at this  look at this 
daddy gave me this  
and with ginger happy  i was able
to concentrate on what i knew best 
loose machines are
right back over there 
what are they doin  back there 
you can t even see  em there 
  okay  i ll  
  what about the progressives
with the high jackpots 
  well  
  these are our best machines 
they bring all the action 
  no wonder the drop is off 
  yeah  okay 
  the action is in the front 
bring  em up front 
  all right  i will 
listen to me very carefully  there are
three ways of doing things around here 
the right way  the wrong way
and the way that i do it 
  you understand 
  i do understand that 
i ll get right on it 
  and thank you 
  don t thank me  just do it 
you re the slots manager 
i shouldn t have to tell you this 
dang  you are right 
mr  rothstein  i am so sorry 
  ace   so i ended up working  
what  18 hour days 
ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of vegas 
come with me  please 
i have a better table for you 
what did you say to that
fucking jerk  anyway 
i told him i was
mrs  sam rothstein 
  chuckles   well  you might
as well get something out of it 
  ace  
well  it wasn t long   
before what i was afraid
was gonna happen happened 
nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in las vegas 
and from then on 
i couldn t be seen talking
to him anywhere in vegas or near it 
what the fuck is that
supposed to mean 
 he will be ejected from
any casino in las vegas 
and the casinos can be fined
as much as  100 000   
every time he shows up  
  you believe this shit 
  yeah  i believe it  you got banned 
 because of notorious
and unsavory reputation   
motherfucker 
ls there any way
around this 
no  there s no way 
let s say  for instance   
i wanna go in a restaurant 
which happens to be in the casino   
to get one of those
sandwiches i like 
forget it  you can t even
set foot in the parking lot 
that s how serious it is 
in other words 
i m fucked 
in so many words  yes 
it just didn t sink into his head
about the black book and what it meant 
not being able to go
into a casino is one thing   
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and fbl agent 
i mean  you re listed in there
with al capone  but nicky didn t care 
i gotta do something 
they ain t gettin  rid of me 
they re not gettin  rid of me 
i m stayin  here 
fuck  em  fuck  em 
  nicky  
so  once they pulled that shit   
i started doin  my own things
nobody ever thought of doin  
to keep an eye on things 
i brought in my kid brother 
dominick  and some desperados   
and started knockin  over
high rollers  casino bosses   
bookmakers  
anybody right here in town 
i had a good fuckin  crew goin 
for me  i ll tell you that 
i had sal fusco 
a great second story guy 
jack hardy  he worked for a safe company
before he did a six year bit 
and then there was bernie blue 
this guy can bypass any alarm for me 
it was like old times 
and i opened up my own jewelry
store too  the  gold rush  
sometimes i used to go along
on a heist  just for the fun of it 
but i didn t like the people
i was rippin  off looking at me   
so i used to turn
their fuckin  pictures around 
  what s takin  so long 
  this is a motherfucker 
  it s working 
  learn how to open these things
so you don t have to take  em 
some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them 
tell pepe if he s
switching stones on us 
he better take a camel back to nigeria 
    phone rings  
  yeah 
  they re in penthouse k 
  check in alone 
  they checked in alone 
  are they out now 
  yes  don t worry 
  all right  thanks 
  ace   he had tipsters
all over town  bellmen 
  but you got to hurry 
  yeah  okay 
  valet parkers 
  they re just checking in now 
okay  i ll tell him 
  pit bosses 
  room 1230 at the scirocco 
  1230  right 
  secretaries 
  mint condition coins 
  mint condition  all right 
and they all got
a piece of the score 
car s coming 
     hard rock  
they were very careful 
they always bypassed
the alarms  or else   
if not  they d drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer 
nicky was grabbing
everything he could 
nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him 
for nicky  las vegas
was the fucking wild west 
i just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael 
  nicky   what the fuck they expect
from me  i had to earn  didn t i 
you know  this diamond
has flaws in it 
  there s no flaws 
  i m doing this for 25 years 
you better clean your loupe 
because there s no flaws 
  nicky  
whenever we got local merch   
we d usually send it
to palm springs or arizona  l a 
i had a couple of sand niggers
out there  you know  arabs 
what  are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here 
i know his language 
forty thousand dollars 
the whole package

my bedroom into a bank vauit   
where i kept
the choice stuff 
i couldn t leave it
at the gold rush   
in case we got raided
by the cops   
or if my crew got cute 
i had the only key 
jennifer didn t give a fuck 
she used to fall asleep
on the couch watching tv 
this stuff was all mine 
i didn t send any of this back home 
actually  i couldn t  because i wasn t
even supposed to be doin  it 
the bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos   
that they didn t want anybody
makin  any waves for them 
you gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that 
  i took care of everybody 
  yeah 
that s why there was
no real organized street stuff
in vegas before i came here 
but how much cash
could i bury in my closet 
you have to understand 
and i m sure you do   
that in a venture
of this kind   
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss 
so i put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with charlie clark  ace s banker 
you will try to push it through 
won t you  mr  clark 
  yes 
  i m giving you 50 000 cash 
then i put some more money into
legitimate places  like my restaurant

a lot of jewelry 
you mean like a lot
of expensive jewelry  about how much 
you want to steal it

about a million dollars  maybe more 
well  there you go

i appreciate you takin  the time
to see a poor civil servant 
  why don t you have a seat  hmm 
  oh  thank you  sir 
i come here personally
to kind of smooth over   
any fracas
about a certain matter 
see  uh  maybe
you didn t know it   
but don ward is a very
well liked man in this town 
he s got lots of friends 
nice family and their money
go back many  many years 
now friends vote 
family and money votes 
that s important
to me and you 
and if you ll think about
our little problem along them lines  
and you ll forgive me
for sayin  it  
maybe he did not
deserve to be fired 
i m sorry  but he knew
about our getting hit   
on three big machines in a row 
and he did nothing about it 
that means  either he was in on it or he
was too dumb to see what was goin  on 
either way  i cannot have
a man like that working here 
before we point the dirty
end of the stick at old don   
we better be sure
we can prove them charges 
believe me  if i could prove it 
he would be under arrest 
are  uh  
  clears throat  
are we certain that you want
the gaming control board   
eyeballing your record and
your gangster pals like nicky santoro 
i think you re way out of line
talking to me like that 
what you re saying is libelous 
and you re in no position
to challenge my expertise 
i went way out of my way
to be very helpful to that kid 
he s weak  he s incompetent 
he jeopardizes the whole place 
there s not much more
i can do for him 
you have got me there 
  chuckles  
old don is as useless
as tits on a boar 
  coughs  
but he is my brother in law   
and i would look on it
as a personal favor   
if you d think some more
on hirin  him back 
i can t do that 
i appreciate the fact
that he s your brother in law   
and i do want to help you
and i like to do favors 
i know who you are 
but i cannot do that 
well  could there be
any position   
farther down the trough 
i m sorry 
i can t do anything 
he s too incompetent  and the bottom
line is  he cannot be trusted 
  phone ringing  
okay  thanks

  crying continues  
  nicky   no matter what the problems
were outside the count room   
it was all worth it 
the cash kept rollin  in   
and the suitcases
kept comin  and goin  
and let me tell you  the fuckin 
bottom line here is    cash 
the only problem was
that after a while   
the bosses noticed that the suitcases
were gettin  a little light 
wait a minute 
you mean to tell me   
that the money we re robbing
is being robbed 
somebody s robbing from us 
we go through all this trouble
and somebody s robbing us 
huh 
like l said  it s part of the business 
lt s considered leakage 
leakage my balls 
l want the guy who s robbing us 
  nicky   even john nash  
that s the guy who ran the scam  
he knew there wasn t much
he could do about it 
you gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal   
even if you take care
of him real well   
he s gonna steal
a little extra for himself 
makes sense  don t it 
try and make these hardheaded
old greaseballs understand that 
what s the point of skimming if we re
being skimmed  lt defeats the purpose 
huh 
they take this money because they re
my guys  so give  em some leeway 
  nicky   but the bosses
never believed in leeway   
so listen to what they do 
they put artie piscano 
the underboss of k c    
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim 
  what were you doin  
  l was with my cumma 
  what are you doin  with your cumma 
  l gave her a scheff 
the only trouble was 
piscano was a disaster 
this guy could fuck up
a cup of coffee 
  what you been doin  
  l m out there more than l m here 
and little did anybody know
where this would lead 
lf they did  they d would ve
been better off makin  fuckin  novena 
you gotta go back there
and talk to that guy 
  l never got paid my expenses
for the last trip 
  what expenses 
l m layin  money outta my own pocket 
and l never get anything back 
you gotta go back out there 
from now on  l m gonna
start keepin  records 
no records  artie  what are
you gonna do with records  pay taxes 
l keep layin  out
my own fuckin  dough 
what the hell are
we doin  over here 
you re goin  to las vegas
at my expense 
oh  fuck 
l mean  after all  
  ace   no matter how many novenas
you could make   
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next 
  l can t believe you re doing this 
  we made a deal 
lt turned out phil green 
mr  lntegrity   
had a partner
nobody knew about 
and when she showed up
and started demanding money  
  why are you doing this 
  because you re wrong 
  yes  you are 
  no  l am not wrong 
green tried to stonewall her 
l will see to it that you
do not get away with this 
so  she sued him in court 
the court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff  anna scott   
against tangiers corporation
and its president  phil green 
  oberon on behalf of mr  green 
  logan on behalf of anna scott 
  mr  oberon  you can proceed 
  thank you  judge 
l believe he was fair 
and l m delighted with the decision 
we got a problem 
lt didn t go too well 
green has to open up the books   
has to show how
he got the financing 
hey  that s not good 
  nicky   she was doin  pretty good
with her lawsuit 
but before she could start
countin  her money   
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court 
so they sent me 
can you comment on
the murder of anna scott 
  what are you talking about 
  she was found
last night shot in the head 
was this just
a real estate partnership 
her lawyer said
you were partners 
we were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago 
lt was never a partnership 
did you ever hear
of the  22 caliber killer 
  ace   now  instead of the cops
only looking at nicky   
they started looking
at green too 
and he was supposed to be
our squeaky clean front man 
l had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew   
the casino
was on the up and up 
so how often do you
really fill in for him 
green s here about
two or three times a month   
and he s busy
with real estate deals 
so in green s absence 
then  you re the boss 
l serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board 
my responsibilities are
to run the day to day operations 
so day to day  then 
you re the boss 
well  in a sense  you could say
that l am the boss   
when mr  green is away 
you could say that 
hmm  have you read this 
about mr  rothstein 
lt says   the midwest bookmaker
with mob ties   
says that he is the real boss
of the  100 million   
tangiers casino empire   
did he really say that 
why  of course he said that 
lt s right here 
has that man even filed
for his license yet 
l don t know 
we have to check the files 
without gettin  your shorts
in a knot  would you do that 
and kinda check closely   cause we may
have to kick a kike s ass outta town 
thank you

which completely absolves mr  rothstein
from any wrongdoing

  accused the state s top
gaming officials of corruption 
you promised me when you were
getting comped at my hotel 
you were asking me for copies
of your bill so you could put  em
on your expense account 
ln a wild outburst that followed
his gaming license denial   
  bullshit  bullshit 
  rothstein followed several   
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue   
until his own lawyers
and friends urged him to leave 
you have a past  l have a past 
my past is no worse than yours 
but you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment 
  newscaster  
long suspected of running
the tangiers without a license   
yesterday s hearing was
to determine whether someone
with rothstein s history   
was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post 
  ace  
fuckin  hypocrites 
  what the hell s he gonna do now 
  l don t know 
what s he doin   he knows all those
guys he yelled at are friends of ours

       rimsky korsakov 
 flight of the bumblebee   
oh  no  no  oh  no 
oh  jesus 
he s juggling 
  ace   let s not take commissioner
pat webb too seriously 
l recently challenged him to a debate
on this program  and he declined 
what are you worried about  pat 
you don t have to send me any questions 
you can ask me
anything you want 
  stone   what the hell is he doin 
on television  anyway 
he s on all night 
screamin  about how he s gonna take
his lawsuit to the supreme court 
he really must be crazy 
he s gonna go to washington with this 
he s out
of his fuckin  mind 
lt s a pity we have such hypocrisy 
some people do what they want 
other people have to pay
through the nose  such is life 
andy  go see him  tell him
maybe it s time he should quit 
  ace   first of all  what they did
was totally unconstitutional 
we re on the list to be heard before
the supreme court of the united states 
these guys don t give a fuck
about the supreme court 
they want you to walk away 
walk away  andy  you can t be serious 
how can l walk away 
don t you see what s at stake 
the old man said maybe
your friend should give in 
when the old man says  maybe  
that s like a papal bull 
not only should you quit 
you should run 
every time they mention my name
in the papers  they mention nicky too 
how the fuck
does that help 
the heat he brought down
is murder 
the police department was cooperative 
he pissed  em off 
nobody can make a move anymore 
  what are you proposing 
  l don t know  he doesn t listen to me 
maybe he should get lost
for awhile  would that be so bad 
  they ain t sendin  nicky nowhere 
  lf he took a break   
it would give everybody
time to maneuver 
l would forget about the maneuver 
l would just get out 
  sighs  
l can t do that 
  ace narrating  
as soon as andy got home 
nicky heard about our talk 
next morning  bright and early 
l get the call 
great  you know  l ve got to do
some shopping  you want to go 
  ace narrating   getting a call
from nicky wasn t easy 
even the codes didn t work 
so we figured out another act 
lf a phone s tapped  the feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes 
so on routine calls  they have
to click off after a few minutes 
  ginger   yeah  l got
a sprained fuckin  elbow 
  yeah 
  meet me at 3 00 
  at caesar s 
  100 yards down the road 
  why 
  don t ask questions  just be there 
suzy cream cheese has
the exact same outfit 
  laughs  
l saw something 
something very cute 
  f b l  agent   okay  he s out 
lt s the ant  brown unit 
and he s with the bogey 
l think it s frankie 
  ace narrating  
nicky started out before me   
because it wasn t that easy
for him to get around 
nicky couldn t even go
for a ride without changing cars   
at least six times
before he could shake all his tails 
because of the planes 
he had to use underground garages 
    tires squealing  
    slams door  
    slams door  
    slams door  
  ace narrating   meeting in the middle
of the desert always made me nervous 
lt s a scary place 
l knew about the holes
in the desert  of course 
and everywhere l looked 
there could have been a hole 
normally  my prospects
of comin  back alive   
from a meetin  with nicky
were 99 out of 100 
but this time  when l heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road   
l gave myself 50 50 
where the fuck you get off talkin 
to people behind my back 
goin  over my head 
  what people 
  what people  what d you think 
l wasn t gonna find out 
l don t even know
what you re talkin  about 
you said l m bringin  heat on you 
l gotta listen to people
because of your shit 
you re orderin  me out  you better get
your own fuckin  army  pal 
l didn t order you or anybody 
l told andy stone that you had heat 
and that was a problem 
  you want me to get out
of my own fuckin  town 
  yeah 
let the bullshit blow over
so l can run the casino 
anything goes wrong
with the casino  it s my ass 
lt s not yours  lt s my ass 
l don t know whether you know
you have your fuckin  casino
because l made that possible 
l m what counts out here 
not your fuckin  country clubs
or your fuckin  tv shows 
and what the fuck
are you doin  on tv anyhow 
l get calls from home every day 
they think you went batshit 
l m only on tv because
l gotta be able to hang around
the casino  you understand 
you could have had
the food and beverage job
without goin  on television 
you wanted to go on tv 
yeah  l wanted to go on tv 
that way l have a forum 
l can fight back 
they know they can t fuck around
with me like they could
if l was an unknown  that s right 
you re makin 
a spectacle of yourself 
me  l wouldn t even be
in this situation if it wasn t for you 
every time l meet somebody 
the question is  do l know you 
  sure  now you wanna blame
your fuckin  license on me 
  no  nicky

  25 000 for clothes and a watch 
  mm hmm 
mm hmm 
  good evening  signora  this way 
  geno 
  ace narrating  
the good part was l had amy back 
so we went home  had the housekeeper
stay over  put the kid to bed 
l calmed myself down 
and we went to dinner 
l tried to keep things
nice and civil   
but  hey 
25 000 for three suits 
that doesn t
make much sense 
first of all  he s not gonna wear
thousand dollar suits 
let s say he did 
which he won t 
how you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days 
    l m confessin   
  l mean  how could you
get fitted that fast 
l can t get fitted that fast 
and l pay twice as much 
  l bought him a watch too 
  yeah 
but even if you bought him a really nice
watch  one that he thought was nice  
he doesn t know
what the fuck a good watch is 
  say you go five  ten  twelve grand   
  yeah 
at the most 
which is impossible  for him 
plus  at the most  three suits 
1 000 apiece  that still leaves what 
  around 10 000 
  would you knock it off  sam 
  l m just trying to figure it out 
  there s nothing to figure out 
l m home 
we re working it out 
l ve been told before 
 we re working it out  
you think
that you re home   
after what you just put me
through with amy  is a favor to me 
so  counting the watch 
let s say another 4 000   
for expenses over the weekend   
of which you must have
had a good time 
l know he did 
that s for sure 
l know that fuckin  piece
of shit had a good fuckin  time 
on my money 
you might as well have fucked him 
which you probably did anyway 
you re lookin  at me
a certain way 
you re teary eyed  huh 
you re upset  you re
a good actress  you know that 
good fuckin  actress 
you can fuckin  get
that pity out of people 
l m not a john 
you understand 
you always thought l was 
but l m not  and l m not a sucker 
that fuckin  pimp cocksucker 
he s lucky l didn t
kill him last time 
lucky he s fuckin  livin  
lf you would have stayed with amy   
and you would have ran away 
he would have been fuckin  dead 
both of you  dead  dead 
  dreamin  dreams of you

she did what she did 
and l did what l had to do   
but  jesus  nicky was the worst thing
she could have done 
what if he won t stop 
  ace narrating  
lt could get us both killed 
l can back him off 
  ace narrating   she was
very convincing when she wanted to be 
and this is how
she backed him off 
  panting  
hey  ginger 
don t forget 
if you re challenged   
if he asks anything 
deny everything 
you understand  l don t want him
bringing beefs back home 
that could really cause
a serious problem 
got to be careful 
he s not dumb  you know 
you hear what l m saying  right 
l know  you don t have
to tell me that 
what  do you think l m stupid 
do l think you re stupid  no 
l think you re beautiful 
but l gotta go 
  ace narrating  
by this time  nicky had things
so fucked up on the streets   
that every time marino went back home 
the packages got smaller and smaller 
lt got to the point 
when he walked into the place   
he didn t know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed 
  gaggi   frankie 
l want to ask you something 
lt s private 
but l want you

l always tell you
the truth  remo 
frankie    the little guy   
he wouldn t be fucking
the jew s wife  would he 
because if he is 
it s a problem 
  frankie narrating  
what could l say 
l knew if l gave
the wrong answer   
nicky  ginger  ace  all of them
could have wound up gettin  killed 
because there s one thing
about these old timers 
they don t like any fucking around
with the other guys  wives 
lt s bad for business 
so l lied  even though l knew
that by lying to gaggi   
l could wind up
gettin  killed too 
  no  l ain t seen anything like that 
  are you sure 
l m positive 
remo  things are very
fucked up down there 
l know 
that s why l m asking

l wouldn t want to be jeopardizing
anything for our friends  understand 
  l understand 
  okay 
frankie  you re a good boy

  ace narrating  
by now  nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom 
vegas really got to him 
the booze  the coke  the broads 
l mean  he got sloppy 
he just wasn t
the same nicky anymore 
  you must have drank too much 
  go fuck yourself 
  ace continues   one night he had
to belt a guy three times   
before the guy
finally went down 
ln the old days  nicky would have
decked him with one shot 
you add this into the mix  
maybe just vegas got to all of us 
his crew followed him
right over the edge 
they were all tuned up
half the time on coke 
they started doing stupid things 
the worst was blue 
  hey  what do you guys want 
  police  stay in the car 
  ace narrating   he never knew
when to keep his mouth shut 
    police   drop the gun 
  fuck you 
  ace continues

who brought them either 
      house of the rising sun   
your honor  as you can see 
my clients are elderly and infirm 
any incarceration could
pose a serious health risk 
  nicky narrating  
when the bosses were arrested 
some of them were so old   
they needed doctors
at their arraignment 
  lawyer   pre trial services recommends
that bail remain as presently set 
  we re going to take a recess 
    nicky narrating   when it looked
like they could get   
25 years to life in prison
just for skimmin  a casino   
sick or no fuckin  sick  you knew
people were going to get clipped 
so  the day of the arraignment 
they had this meeting right
in the back of the courthouse 
see  when something like this happens 
you know how things are gonna work out 
lt s always better with no witnesses 
so what about andy 
he won t talk 
stone is a good kid 
stand up guy
just like his old man 
that s the way l see it 
l agree  he s solid

thursday morning before 11 00 
  lt s done 
lt s terribly important  l gotta have
a conversation with that guy  
  firing gun  
  nicky narrating  
as much as they liked him 
l mean  he wasn t one of us 
he wasn t ltalian  as far as they knew 
he could have talked 
otherwise 
stoney might still be alive 
the first one to skip
was john nance 
he found a nice  warm 
secluded place in costa rica 
  he thought nobody
would find him there 
    gunshots  
  breaks glass  
  gunshots 
furniture crashing  
  nicky narrating  
but then his kid got nabbed
by the feds for drugs 
so  naturally 
the bosses were afraid
he d come out of hiding   
just to save his kid
and give them all up 
so   
where you goin   jag off 
  nicky narrating   but  anyway 
they all had to follow 
  everybody went down 
    groans

  nicky narrating

he said they gave her
a hot dose 
ln the end  all she had left was 3 600
in mint condition coins 
no matter what the feds or the papers
might have said about my car bombing   
it was amateur night 
you could tell 
whoever it was  they put
the dynamite under the passenger side 
but what they didn t know 
what nobody outside the factory knew   
was that that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver s seat 
lt s the only thing
that saved my life 
the bombing was never authorized 
but l suspect l know who lit the fuse 
    man   hey  nicky 
    ace narrating  
and so did the powers that be 
  how are you 
  how you doin  
  nicky narrating   lt took months
for everything to calm down 
but  finally 
my guys got out on bail   
and the bosses wanted me to send
my brother dominick out to vegas 
always the dollars 
always the fuckin  dollars 
l mean  it was still way too hot
for me to even go near vegas

the town will never be the same 
after the tangiers 
the big corporations took it all over 
today it looks like disneyland 
     choir continues  
  ace narrating   and while the kids
play cardboard pirates   
mommy and daddy drop the house payments
and junior s college money   
on the poker slots 
ln the old days  dealers knew your name 
what you drank  what you played 
today  it s like checkin 
into an airport 
and if you order room service 
you re lucky if you get it by thursday 
today it s all gone 
you got a whale show up
with four million in a suitcase   
and some 25 year old hotel school kid is
gonna want his social security number 
after the teamsters
got knocked out of the box   
the corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos 
and where did the money come
from to rebuild the pyramids 
junk bonds 
still not sure 
    bell ringing  
  probable  maybe questionable 
let me know as soon
as you can find out 
  ace narrating  
but in the end  l wound up
right back where l started 
l could still pick winners   
and l could still make money
for all kinds of people back home 
and why mess up a good thing 
and that s that 
subs by tarun bansal
  man  
  sometimes l wonder why
l spend the lonely nights  
  dreaming of a song  
  the melody
haunts my memory  
  and l am once again with you  
  when our love was new  
  and each kiss an inspiration  
  ah  but that was long ago  
  and now my consolation  
  ls in the stardust of a song  
  beside a garden wall  
  when stars were bright  
  and you were in my arms  
  the nightingale
told his fairy tale  
  of paradise  
  where roses grew  
  though l dream in vain
