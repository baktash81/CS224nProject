theres no other way
youve got to give them the key
to everything thats yours
otherwise whats the point
and for a while i believed
thats the kind of love i had
choir singing
before i ever ran a casino
or got myself blown up
ace rothstein was a hell
of a handicapper i can tell you that
i was so good that whenever i bet
i could change the odds
for every bookmaker
in the country
im serious
i had it down so cold
that i was given
paradise on earth
i was given one of the biggest casinos
in las vegas to run the tangiers
by the only kind of guys that can
actually get you that kind of money
i dont know all the details
man 2 narrating
nobody knew all the details
but it shouldve been perfect
i mean he had me nicky santoro
his best friend watching his ass
and he had ginger
the woman he loved on his arm
but in the end
we fucked it all up
it shouldve been so sweet too
but it turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us
were ever given anything
that fuckin valuable again
ace
at that time vegas was a place
where millions of suckers
flew in every year
on their own nickel
and left behind
about a billion dollars
but at night you couldnt see
the desert that surrounds las vegas
but its in the desert where lots
of the towns problems are solved
nicky  got a lot of holes
in the desert
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes
except you gotta do it right
i mean you gotta have
the hole already dug
before you show up
with a package in the trunk
otherwise youre talking about
a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin
and who knows whos gonna
be comin along in that time
before you know it
you gotta dig a few more holes
you could be there
all fuckin night
scatting
horn honking
scatting continues
ace  who could resist
anywhere else in the country
i was a bookie a gambler
always lookin over my shoulder
hassled by cops day and night
but here im mr rothstein
im not only legitimate
but running a casino
and thats like selling people
dreams for cash
i hired an old casino pal
billy sherbert as my manager
and i went to work
the casino manager and this is
ronnie who takes care of the card room
ace  for guys like me
las vegas washes away your sins
its like a morality car wash
it does for us what lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples
and along with making us legit
comes cash tons of it
i mean what do you think were doing
out here in the middle of the desert
its all this money
this is the end resuit
of all the bright lights
and the comp trips
of all the champagne
and free hotel suites
and all the broads and all the booze
its all been arranged
just for us to get your money
thats the truth about las vegas
were the only winners
the players dont stand a chance
and their cash flows
from the tables
to our boxes
through the cage
and into the most sacred room
in the casino
the place where they add up
all the money
the holy of holies
the count room
now this place was offlimits
verify 3000
even i couldnt get inside
but it was my job to keep it filled
with cash thats for sure
nicky  they had so much
fuckin money in there
you could build a house out
of stacks of hundreddollar bills
and the best part
was that upstairs
the board of directors didnt
know what the fuck was going on
five thousand
i mean to them everything
looked on the upandup
right wrong
verify 5000
the guys inside the counting room
five thousand
were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry
theyd do short counts
theyd lose fill slips
theyd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes
and it was up to this guy
right here
standin in front
of about two million dollars
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody gettin wise
the lrs or anybody
verify 200
now notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything
somehow somebodys always
lookin the other way
now look at these guys
they look busy right
theyre countin money
who wants to bother them
i mean god forbid they should make
a mistake and forget to steal
meanwhile
youre in and youre out
past the jagoff guard
who gets an extra cnote a week
just to watch the door
its routine business as usual
in out hello goodbye
and thats all there is to it
just another fat fuck walkin out
of the casino with a suitcase
now that suitcase was goin
straight to one place
right to kansas city
which was as close
to las vegas as the midwest
bosses could go
without gettin themselves arrested
that suitcase was all
the bosses ever wanted
and they wanted it every month
hey john how was your ride
now this old mormon fuck here
he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month nice and easy
somethin smells good
yeah they made us somethin to eat
the bosses would come
from all over the place
detroit cleveland milwaukee
all over the midwest
and they would meet in the back
of this produce market in kansas city
i mean nobody even knew it
one of the guys made
his mother do all the cookin
do you ever see that guy
jerry steriano
jerry steriano
now these old greaseballs
might not look it
but believe me
these are the guys
who secretly control las vegas
mama that mans here again
because they control
the teamsters union
and thats where you had to go if you
wanted to borrow money to buy a casino
would you put in shrimp
i would
here you are gentlemen
nobody got a teamsters loan
unless the guys in this room
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases
guys like this antique over here
out of detroit
or especially guys like remo gaggi
the outfits top boss
you got a round figure on it
definitely the most
important guy in this room
about 20 pounds
thats around 700000
uhhuh good
man  i know its
a little early for las vegas
laughter
but i do want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry
ace  as far as the world
was concerned
andy stone the head of
the teamsters pension fund
was a legitimate guy
this is a very auspicious occasion
a powerful man
philip if you would rise
he even played golf
with the president
on behalf of the teamsters
pension fund
it is my pleasure to present to you
but andy also took orders
and when he was told to give
a pension fund loan to philip green
this check for 62700000
for the new tangiers
he did what he was told
nicky  now here was
the perfect front man
what the fuck else could he be
he didnt know too much
he didnt want to know
too much
especially that the bosses made
the teamsters lend him the money
he wanted to believe
the teamsters
gave him all that fuckin money
cause he was smart
i know full well how much competition
we have in this great city
and where they got green from
who the fuck knows
all i know is that green was
an arizona real estate hustler
who barely had
enough gas money
to come and pick up
his own fuckin check
and of course it was
the bosses man
andy stone
who gave all the orders
not the chairman
of the fuckin board philip green
i understand
i understand
now all they needed was
somebody they could trust
to run the casino
and who better than ace i mean he was
already in vegas a couple years
and he had
the fuckin place clocked
but typical ace give him a shot
at runnin a casino
and he tries
to talk you out of it
i dont know if i could do this
even if i wanted to
the gaming commission
would never give me a license
i have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me
you dont have to have a license
to work in a casino
all you gotta do
is apply for one
the state law says that
you can work in a casino
while theyre processing
your application
they got a tenyear backlog
what happens when
they do find out
why would they
want to find out
were puttin a hundred million
into this desert
why would they want to lock us out
theyll never find out all you gotta do
is keep changing your job title
like uh from casino executive
to food and beverage chairman
they take your application
they put it at the bottom of the pile
i know guys been workin there
for 30 years dont have a license
its a tough proposition andy
you know if i did it
id have to run it my way
you got it
im serious no interference
nobodys gonna interfere
with your running the casino
i guarantee it
nicky  and thats how
they got ace to take over
they wanted him because ace ate
slept and breathed gambling
they worked out
a real cute job title too
tangiers public relations director
but the only thing he ever
directed was the casino
he made his first bet when he was
15 years old and he always made money
but he didnt bet
like you or me
you know havin some fun
with it shit like that
where the hell
did you learn how to deal
he bet like a fuckin
brain surgeon
place the checks properly
thats the way you do it
yes sir
he had to know everything
this guy
hed find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew
and thats what hed put
his money on
even back home years ago
when we were first hangin out
hed know if the quarterback
was on coke
ill take columbia for 20
if his girlfriend was knocked up
twenty dimes on columbia
hed get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals
he even figured out
the different bounce
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used
on college basketball courts
you know
hed be workin
on this shit day and night
there was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didnt know
ace got down at six
get me down at six
season after season
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner i ever knew
but he was so serious
about it all
that i dont think
he ever enjoyed himself
but thats just the way he was
but back then the bosses
didnt give a fuck
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not
to them he was
a cash register
all they had to do was
ring the bell and take money
especially remo
who was a fuckin degenerate
gambler who always lost
cazzo
mumbles in italian
all those fuckin sweeps
unless ace made his bets
enough now
ace made more money
for them on a weekend
than i could do heisting
joints for a month
whatever ace picked up
on the street he told remo
i mean fixed fights
doped horses
crooked fuckin zebras
lockedin point spreads
he told fuckin remo everything
and to tell you the truth
i dont blame him
hey
keepin remo happy with money
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world
son of a bitch
how the hell did you get
oklahomamichigan
nobody ever had oklahomami

ace  while i was trying
to figure out why the guy was saying
what he was saying
nicky just hit him
no matter how big a guy might be
nicky would take him on
you beat nicky with fists
he comes back with a bat
you beat him with a knife
he comes back with a gun
and if you beat him with a gun
you better kill him
because hell keep coming
back and back
until one of you is dead
nicky  listen
with me protectin ace
he made a fortune
for the bosses
i mean thats
what got him to vegas
he was a money machine
a tremendous earner
for these guys
as soon as he took over
he doubled the fuckin drop
with ace the casino
never saw so much money
and the bosses
they couldnt be happier
i got 700
dont you mess with me
but you know im down
everybody knows im down
ace  in vegas i had to keep
a few juicedin local cowboys working
they were close to the
you know good old boys
i mean without us these guys
theyd still be shoveling mule shit
ward youve got to keep
a cleaner space
lf you need mr clean
page him all right
wont happen again sam
mr rothstein
mr rothstein wont
happen again mr rothstein
ls this guy just another dumb fucking
white man or what whats the story
you need this guy
cant get rid of him
hes juiced in
hes the county commissioners cousin
i wouldnt give the bum
a mop job
but still i had no choice
i had to take care of them
these yokels ran the state
thank you very much
senator
they passed the laws
they owned the courts
hi ace hey i need a room
i had dozens of politicians
and state officials
the cedar room
coming through that place
every week
help the senator
get him whatever he wants
certainly
why not make him happy
the presidential suite
for politicians like our state senator
up there everything was on the house
these guys won their comp life
when they got elected
so hey why not
take advantage of it
still the politicians came cheap
we could handle them
its a whale
like kk ichikawa
who plays 30000 a hand
in baccarat
thats the one
you really gotta watch
he plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit
to turn out your lights
about a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the cayman lslands
downstairs he takes us
for two million
and upstairs he takes free
soap shampoo and towels
another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms
free private jets and
two million of our money
but we got him back
i had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz
i dont know what the hell went wrong
im awfully sorry
i cant understand it these mechanical
things you know they happen
hey but better here than
up there you know what i mean
then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with japan
i cant believe that theres
a convention theres no room
we got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself
im sorry you missed your plane
glad to get to know you
oh no no gambling
and once he was back
he played small
he bet 1000 a hand
instead of his usual 30000 a hand
to the bank
with a natural lead over a five
but i knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa
was that they cant bet
small for long
he didnt think of it
as winning 10000
he thought of it
as losing 90000
so he upped his bets
until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash
in the casino the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing
and keep them coming back
the longer they play
the more they lose
in the end we get it all
goddamn it
trying to make it real
compared to what
sock it to me
in vegas everybodys
gotta watch everybody else
six all right
whos gonna give me that
since the players are looking
to beat the casino
each and every roll

the dealers are watching

and helped them spread
around a lot of money
hello
hey ginger how you doing
great and i have something for you
you got me covered
and you do thank you very much
take care of yourself
i got some lucky pills for you andy
oh yeah
who didnt want ginger
she was one of the best known
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town
smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake
for two or three days
before sending him home broke
to the little woman
and his bank examiners
you only make me glad
better listen little girl
youre goin walkin
down the street
i aint got no love
any change
oh i hit a few games
on the way back

she just pocketed the cash
this heart of stone
how you doin tonight

how are you
uh beat
ace  ginger had the hustlers code
take one for you
thank you
she knew how to take care of people
and thats what vegas
is all about
sixtyeight hundred
thanks
its kickback city
have a good night
thank you you too
she took care of the dealers
hey mitch
pit bosses floor managers
but mostly she took care
of the valet parkers
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything
ginger took care of the parkers
because they took care
of the security guards
who took care of the metro cops
who let her operate
i need that stuff tonight
no problem
you are a doll
the valet parking job
was such a moneymaker
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession
but one thing
i just could never understand
was that she could have
everything under control
except for her old pimp
boyfriend lester diamond
gin you know i got other people
in this they got partners
i want you to understand
that i am looking out for you
in this thing okay
youre gonna get yours back
and youre gonna get back first okay
all right yeah
where you going
where are you youre
in that place where are you
im here
no youre not
where are you
where are you
im always here for you
youre my woman
i know
ace  the ginger i knew wouldnt
even look at this creep
good luck
yeah
he was a moocher
a card cheat
a country club golf hustler
a scumbag
chasing dentists for a few bucks
careful
the guy was always broke
he always had a story
and somehow she could never
turn him down
the way ginger saw it i guess
was that lester was just an unlucky guy
somebody had
to take care of him
but nobody
had to take care of nicky
lf you find any cash in there
well whack it up with you
i mean he took care
of himself only too well
thats why every badge
i folded these things beautifully
back home wanted to nail him
i would appreciate a little respect
look at me pal
i gotta live with her
jesus christ
volare
even after a little vacation
they hassled him at the airport
i mean frank marino was there
to meet him but so were the cops
this time they wanted
to pinch him
for some diamond burglary in antwerp
will you help me fold these
they were ready to blame him for
anything no matter where it happened
put your things away
and they were usually right
hold it hold it here
because nicky enjoyed
being a gangster
and he didnt give a damn who knew it
come on there we go
look at this beautiful
i mean thats what worried me
cause it turns out
nicky was about to be sent to vegas
all right were clear
theres more
theres a couple stuck in there
i know theres more
im telling you theyre out
come on
dont get so defensive
it could be stuck in your hair
whats that
huh whats that
theres no more
thanks hon
nicky  i couldnt wait to get
my hands on vegas
but the bosses didnt send me
out there to have a good time
they sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with ace
and nobody interfered
with the fuckin skim
hey
hey how you doin
hey sammy

and we took a ride to talk
and then he hit me with it
what do you think about me
moving out here
whats the matter
you got a problem with that
no of course not
you mean i have your permission
sure you have my permission
but i just gotta tell you
its no joke out here
its no joke
you gotta keep a low profile
its not like back home right off
the bat they dont like guys like us
and this sheriffs
a real cowboy
even the coppers arent afraid
to bury people out in the desert here
i dont care i wanna get away
from back home for a while
im tired of that shit
back there
look at this place
its made of money
you know what the best part is
nobodys gonna know what were doing
theres nobody here to see us
everybodys back home
nick i gotta tell you
i got pinched twice for no reason
i really gotta be careful
im running a licensed place
everythings legit
dont worry about it
im not gonna do anything
im especially not gonna
involve you in anything
nicky
ace saw vegas one way
you call this guy
and tell him im comin
of course
but i saw it another
i saw it as untouched
i mean they had bookies pimps
and drug dealers
i could shake down
who the fuck
were they gonna run to
so i started gettin
everybody in line
best of all
for the first time in my life
i figured out a way
not to lose
ace  yeah he had
a foolproof scheme all right
it wasnt very scientific
but it worked
when he won he collected
when he lost he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves
what were they gonna do
muscle nicky
hey how you doin
how you doin
you got that thing for me
what thing
oh nicky i thought
you was layin
no no im takin
i was takin
you sure
im positive
im a little confused
youre a little confused
maybe if i stick your fuckin
face through this window
youll get unconfused
gimme the fuckin money
im sorry nick
i didnt mean anything by it
thats why you had it ready
you thought i was fuckin layin it
my fuckin head
smarten up
and now nicholas santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president
george washington was born
ace  but still
it was nice and quiet for a while
ginger and i presented
nicky and jennifer all over town
like regular ozzie and harriets
beautiful you got
a beautiful swing
nicky  ace got my son little nicky
involved in little league
turned out to be one
of the other coaches
was a fuckin
metro intelligence cop
but it didnt matter
it was all about the kids
hes gotta realize that everything
cant be a home run that he does
thats exactly what
i keep tellin him
but thats the kind of kid he is
ace  and nicky being nicky
he made his presence known
especially at the casino
where he definitely did not work
people got the message
nicky  me thats why
the bosses sent me out here
they wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint
like these two fuckin
balloon heads over here
they were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin grand
yeah right im sure
hey how are you
how are you
what are you doing here
im over here now
youre over here

were waiting on carmine
yeah were looking
for carmine
he was here before he had
a suitcase and then he left
carmine left
carmine left
hes gone
hes not here
carmines out
i think maybe he went
across the street
or somewhere else
or somethin
well listen good luck
with the joint
ah thanks eddie
yeah lots of luck
yeah good luck to you too
hey they forgot to sign their papers
yeah they dont
need those anymore
ace  guys from other crews
got away with a warning
everybody else watch out
like these yokels here
who never heard of nicky
or the bosses back home
cause theyre the morons
who give you the most trouble
even after wed catch them
theyd try sneaking back
with beards
and wigs and fake noses
you can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet
like this guy
hes bettin lavender chips
at 500 each with only
one little problem
hes always guessed right
lf he wasnt so fuckin greedy
hed have been tougher to spot
but in the end
theyre all greedy
i got a feelin
about the future
and it aint too good
i know that
i saw that the dealer was weak
but he wasnt in on it
he just wasnt
protecting his hand
he was lifting
his hole card way too high
now heres this guy reading
the dealers hole card
and signaling his buddy
at this table
electronic beeping
and thats just what
these hustlers look for
they cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers
the way lions
look for weak antelope

tucked in a bank in vegas only
for ginger she was secure and happy
she loved that shit
but a guy in my line of work has
to have a lot of payoff cash around
crooked cops and kidnappers
they dont take checks
need any help with that
mr collins
so i put two million in cash
in a los angeles bank
under the name
of mr and mrs tom collins
this was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money
ginger laughs
and since id either be in jail
or locked in a closet
when i needed the money

ill stick you in the desert
go over and apologize
nicky im sorry
roaring
youre dear to me
yes sirree
nicky  you know
ace could be a very touchy guy
especially when
he got bigger in town
like when he hired
that jonathan and david
and their tigers away from the palace
by building them a new stage
and giving them a rollsroyce
but ill tell you he knew
how to bring in the crowds
he knew all
the fuckin angles
he brought over the whole
femme fatale show from paris
but he forgot how lazy them
european dancing broads can get
he had to weigh em in
once a week to make sure
they didnt blow up like balloons
shes still eight pounds over
whats the reason for this
mr rothstein sir
never mind the sir
why is she eight pounds over
im trying to use respect
mr rothstein is good enough for you
well sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them
all you do is give me answers
just give me the right answer
i guess shes frightened lf she doesnt
lose weight she may get fired
thats right she will get fired
send her back to paris
its been our policy
just stop everything
this womans an institution
thats the problem shes lazy
nicky  hey
i gotta give the guy credit
i mean he does
the most obvious thing
this is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit
so why not take advantage right
so he took bookie joints
off the street
and then opened them up
inside the casino
within a few years
by doing all of this
he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him
ace
between my innovations
look like theyre taking
some cat to jail
and nickys dedication
to his job
steamboats are comin and
theyre splashing and goin
i soon had the best
operation on the strip
moon is shinin
on friends below
you gotta watch yourself
theres a lot of heat on you already
why
somebodys complainin
im hearing things
from security
the sheriffs lookin
to put you in the black book
that black book
is a bunch of bullshit
they got two names
from the whole country
and one of em
is still al capone
lf they put you in that book
youre gonna be in trouble
you will not be able
to walk into a casino
im trying to make a living
thats all
im just tellin you

ahhhh
daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much
but as much as they loved her
oh fabulous
they didnt know
what really moved her

with the high jackpots
well

they bring all the action
no wonder the drop is off
yeah okay
the action is in the front
bring em up front

listen to me very carefully there are
three ways of doing things around here
the right way the wrong way
and the way that i do it
you understand
i do understand that
ill get right on it
and thank you
dont thank me just do it
youre the slots manager
i shouldnt have to tell you this
dang you are right
mr rothstein i am so sorry
ace  so i ended up working
what 18hour days
ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of vegas
come with me please
i have a better table for you
what did you say to that
fucking jerk anyway
i told him i was
mrs sam rothstein
chuckles  well you might
as well get something out of it
ace
well it wasnt long
before what i was afraid
was gonna happen happened
nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in las vegas
and from then on
i couldnt be seen talking
to him anywhere in vegas or near it
what the fuck is that
supposed to mean
he will be ejected from
any casino in las vegas
and the casinos can be fined
as much as 100000
every time he shows up
you believe this shit
yeah i believe it you got banned
because of notorious
and unsavory reputation
motherfucker
ls there any way
around this
no theres no way
lets say for instance
i wanna go in a restaurant
which happens to be in the casino
to get one of those
sandwiches i like
forget it you cant even
set foot in the parking lot
thats how serious it is
in other words
im fucked
in so many words yes
it just didnt sink into his head
about the black book and what it meant
not being able to go
into a casino is one thing
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and fbl agent
i mean youre listed in there
with al capone but nicky didnt care
i gotta do something
they aint gettin rid of me
theyre not gettin rid of me
im stayin here
fuck em fuck em
nicky
so once they pulled that shit
i started doin my own things
nobody ever thought of doin
to keep an eye on things
i brought in my kid brother
dominick and some desperados
and started knockin over
highrollers casino bosses
bookmakers
anybody right here in town
i had a good fuckin crew goin
for me ill tell you that
i had sal fusco
a great secondstory guy
jack hardy he worked for a safe company
before he did a sixyear bit
and then there was bernie blue
this guy can bypass any alarm for me
it was like old times
and i opened up my own jewelry
store too the gold rush
sometimes i used to go along
on a heist just for the fun of it
but i didnt like the people
i was rippin off looking at me
so i used to turn
their fuckin pictures around
whats takin so long
this is a motherfucker
its working
learn how to open these things
so you dont have to take em
some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them
tell pepe if hes
switching stones on us
he better take a camel back to nigeria
phone rings
yeah
theyre in penthouse k
check in alone
they checked in alone
are they out now
yes dont worry

ace  he had tipsters
all over town bellmen
but you got to hurry
yeah okay
valet parkers
theyre just checking in now
okay ill tell him
pit bosses
room 1230 at the scirocco
1230 right
secretaries
mint condition coins
mint condition all right
and they all got
a piece of the score
cars coming
hard rock
they were very careful
they always bypassed
the alarms or else
if not theyd drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer
nicky was grabbing
everything he could
nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him
for nicky las vegas
was the fucking wild west
i just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael
nicky  what the fuck they expect
from me i had to earn didnt i
you know this diamond
has flaws in it
theres no flaws

nicky  i actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vauit
where i kept
the choice stuff
i couldnt leave it
at the gold rush
in case we got raided
by the cops
or if my crew got cute
i had the only key
jennifer didnt give a fuck
she used to fall asleep
on the couch watching tv
this stuff was all mine
i didnt send any of this back home
actually i couldnt because i wasnt
even supposed to be doin it
the bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos
that they didnt want anybody
makin any waves for them
you gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that
i took care of everybody
yeah
thats why there was
no real organized street stuff
in vegas before i came here
but how much cash
could i bury in my closet
you have to understand
and im sure you do
that in a venture
of this kind
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss
so i put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with charlie clark aces banker
you will try to push it through
wont you mr clark
yes
im giving you 50000 cash
then i put some more money into
legitimate places like my restaurant

our little problem along them lines
and youll forgive me
for sayin it
maybe he did not
deserve to be fired
im sorry but he knew
about our getting hit
on three big machines in a row

that means either he was in on it or he
was too dumb to see what was goin on
either way i cannot have
a man like that working here
before we point the dirty
end of the stick at old don
we better be sure
we can prove them charges

i went way out of my way
to be very helpful to that kid
hes weak hes incompetent
he jeopardizes the whole place
theres not much more
i can do for him
you have got me there
chuckles
old don is as useless

on hirin him back

i appreciate the fact
that hes your brotherinlaw
and i do want to help you

crying continues
nicky  no matter what the problems
were outside the count room
it was all worth it
the cash kept rollin in
and the suitcases
kept comin and goin
and let me tell you the fuckin
bottom line here is cash
the only problem was
that after a while
the bosses noticed that the suitcases
were gettin a little light
wait a minute
you mean to tell me
that the money were robbing
is being robbed
somebodys robbing from us
we go through all this trouble
and somebodys robbing us
huh
like l said its part of the business
lts considered leakage
leakage my balls
l want the guy whos robbing us
nicky  even john nash
thats the guy who ran the scam
he knew there wasnt much
he could do about it
you gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal
even if you take care
of him real well
hes gonna steal
a little extra for himself
makes sense dont it
try and make these hardheaded
old greaseballs understand that
whats the point of skimming if were
being skimmed lt defeats the purpose
huh
they take this money because theyre
my guys so give em some leeway
nicky  but the bosses
never believed in leeway
so listen to what they do
they put artie piscano
the underboss of kc
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim
what were you doin
l was with my cumma
what are you doin with your cumma
l gave her a scheff
the only trouble was
piscano was a disaster
this guy could fuck up
a cup of coffee
what you been doin
lm out there more than lm here
and little did anybody know
where this would lead
lf they did theyd wouldve
been better off makin fuckin novena
you gotta go back there
and talk to that guy
l never got paid my expenses
for the last trip
what expenses
lm layin money outta my own pocket
and l never get anything back
you gotta go back out there
from now on lm gonna
start keepin records
no records artie what are
you gonna do with records pay taxes
l keep layin out
my own fuckin dough
what the hell are
we doin over here
youre goin to las vegas
at my expense
oh fuck
l mean after all
ace  no matter how many novenas
you could make
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next
l cant believe youre doing this
we made a deal
lt turned out phil green
mr lntegrity
had a partner
nobody knew about
and when she showed up
and started demanding money
why are you doing this
because youre wrong
yes you are
no l am not wrong
green tried to stonewall her
l will see to it that you
do not get away with this
so she sued him in court
the court will now hear the matter
of the plaintiff anna scott
against tangiers corporation
and its president phil green
oberon on behalf of mr green
logan on behalf of anna scott
mr oberon you can proceed
thank you judge
l believe he was fair
and lm delighted with the decision
we got a problem
lt didnt go too well
green has to open up the books
has to show how
he got the financing
hey thats not good
nicky  she was doin pretty good
with her lawsuit
but before she could start
countin her money
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court
so they sent me
can you comment on
the murder of anna scott
what are you talking about
she was found
last night shot in the head
was this just
a real estate partnership
her lawyer said
you were partners
we were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago
lt was never a partnership
did you ever hear
of the 22 caliber killer
ace  now instead of the cops
only looking at nicky
they started looking
at green too
and he was supposed to be
our squeakyclean front man
l had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew
the casino
was on the upandup
so how often do you
really fill in for him
greens here about
two or three times a month
and hes busy
with real estate deals
so in greens absence
then youre the boss
l serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board
my responsibilities are
to run the daytoday operations
so daytoday then
youre the boss
well in a sense you could say
that l am the boss
when mr green is away
you could say that
hmm have you read this
about mr rothstein
lt says the midwest bookmaker
with mob ties
says that he is the real boss
of the 100 million
tangiers casino empire
did he really say that
why of course he said that
lts right here
has that man even filed
for his license yet
l dont know
we have to check the files
without gettin your shorts
in a knot would you do that
and kinda check closely cause we may
have to kick a kikes ass outta town

ln a wild outburst that followed
his gaming license denial

stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue
until his own lawyers
and friends urged him to leave
you have a past l have a past
my past is no worse than yours
but you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment

lm very proud to say

applauding
avalon  no no please please

theres nothing to it
lt was my pleasure
ace dont do it
rimskykorsakov
flight of the bumblebee
oh no no oh no
oh jesus
hes juggling
ace  lets not take commissioner
pat webb too seriously
l recently challenged him to a debate
on this program and he declined
what are you worried about pat
you dont have to send me any questions
you can ask me
anything you want
stone  what the hell is he doin
on television anyway
hes on all night
screamin about how hes gonna take
his lawsuit to the supreme court
he really must be crazy
hes gonna go to washington with this
hes out
of his fuckin mind
lts a pity we have such hypocrisy
some people do what they want
other people have to pay
through the nose such is life
andy go see him tell him
maybe its time he should quit
ace  first of all what they did
was totally unconstitutional
were on the list to be heard before
the supreme court of the united states
these guys dont give a fuck
about the supreme court
they want you to walk away
walk away andy you cant be serious
how can l walk away
dont you see whats at stake
the old man said maybe
your friend should give in
when the old man says maybe
thats like a papal bull
not only should you quit
you should run
every time they mention my name
in the papers they mention nicky too
how the fuck
does that help
the heat he brought down
is murder
the police department was cooperative
he pissed em off
nobody can make a move anymore
what are you proposing
l dont know he doesnt listen to me
maybe he should get lost
for awhile would that be so bad
they aint sendin nicky nowhere
lf he took a break
it would give everybody
time to maneuver
l would forget about the maneuver
l would just get out
sighs
l cant do that
ace narrating
as soon as andy got home
nicky heard about our talk
next morning bright and early
l get the call
great you know lve got to do
some shopping you want to go
ace narrating  getting a call
from nicky wasnt easy
even the codes didnt work
so we figured out another act
lf a phones tapped the feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes
so on routine calls they have
to click off after a few minutes
ginger  yeah l got
a sprained fuckin elbow
yeah
meet me at 300
at caesars
100 yards down the road
why
dont ask questions just be there
suzy cream cheese has
the exact same outfit
laughs
l saw something
something very cute
fbl agent  okay hes out
lts the ant brown unit
and hes with the bogey
l think its frankie
ace narrating
nicky started out before me
because it wasnt that easy
for him to get around
nicky couldnt even go
for a ride without changing cars
at least six times
before he could shake all his tails
because of the planes
he had to use underground garages
tires squealing
slams door
slams door
slams door
ace narrating  meeting in the middle
of the desert always made me nervous
lts a scary place
l knew about the holes
in the desert of course
and everywhere l looked
there could have been a hole
normally my prospects
of comin back alive
from a meetin with nicky
were 99 out of 100
but this time when l heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road
l gave myself 5050
where the fuck you get off talkin
to people behind my back

thousanddollar suits

which he wont
how you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days
lm confessin
l mean how could you
get fitted that fast
l cant get fitted that fast

but even if you bought him a really nice
watch one that he thought was nice
he doesnt know
what the fuck a good watch is
say you go five ten twelve grand
yeah
at the most
which is impossible for him
plus at the most three suits
1000 apiece that still leaves what
around 10000
would you knock it off sam
lm just trying to figure it out
theres nothing to figure out
lm home

you think
that youre home

lt could get us both killed

ace narrating  she was
very convincing when she wanted to be

she backed him off
panting
hey ginger

do l think youre stupid no
l think youre beautiful
but l gotta go
ace narrating
by this time nicky had things

that every time marino went back home
the packages got smaller and smaller
lt got to the point
when he walked into the place
he didnt know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed
gaggi  frankie
l want to ask you something

of course remo
l want you to tell me

l mean he got sloppy
he just wasnt
the same nicky anymore
you must have drank too much
go fuck yourself
ace continues  one night he had
to belt a guy three times
before the guy
finally went down
ln the old days nicky would have
decked him with one shot
you add this into the mix
maybe just vegas got to all of us
his crew followed him
right over the edge
they were all tuned up
half the time on coke
they started doing stupid things
the worst was blue
hey what do you guys want
police stay in the car
ace narrating  he never knew
when to keep his mouth shut
police  drop the gun

ace continues
the cops shot blue

ace narrating  to get even
nickys crew got stoned one night
and they started shooting up
the cops houses
lt got to the point where they couldnt
talk in the gold rush anymore
because the feds
put a wire in the wall
even when they talked outside
they had to cover their mouths
shit hes covering up again
because the feds
brought in lip readers
nicky found out from a teller
who owed him money
he asked me again

l didnt want to look at the guys
who brought them either
house of the rising sun
your honor as you can see
my clients are elderly and infirm
any incarceration could
pose a serious health risk
nicky narrating
when the bosses were arrested
some of them were so old
they needed doctors
at their arraignment
lawyer  pretrial services recommends
that bail remain as presently set
were going to take a recess
nicky narrating  when it looked
like they could get
25 years to life in prison
just for skimmin a casino
sick or no fuckin sick you knew
people were going to get clipped
so the day of the arraignment
they had this meeting right
in the back of the courthouse
see when something like this happens
you know how things are gonna work out
lts always better with no witnesses
so what about andy
he wont talk
stone is a good kid
standup guy
just like his old man
thats the way l see it
l agree hes solid

remo what do you think

l feel about it

thursday morning before 1100
lts done
lts terribly important l gotta have
a conversation with that guy
firing gun
nicky narrating
as much as they liked him
l mean he wasnt one of us
he wasnt ltalian as far as they knew
he could have talked
otherwise
stoney might still be alive
the first one to skip
was john nance
he found a nice warm
secluded place in costa rica
he thought nobody
would find him there
gunshots
breaks glass
gunshots
furniture crashing
nicky narrating
but then his kid got nabbed
by the feds for drugs
so naturally
the bosses were afraid
hed come out of hiding
just to save his kid
and give them all up
so
where you goin jagoff
nicky narrating  but anyway
they all had to follow
everybody went down
groans
fuck you
nicky narrating
before you knew it
anybody who knew anything
wound up gettin whacked
fires gun
groaning
woman
oh no no no
house of the rising sun
continues
ace narrating
after ginger took off
she wasnt much help to anybody
she found some pimps lowlifes
druggies and bikers in la
ln a few months they went through
all the money and all the jewels
groaning
gasps
ace narrating
after they found her body
l had a private doctor
do another autopsy
he said they gave her
a hot dose
ln the end all she had left was 3600
in mint condition coins
no matter what the feds or the papers
might have said about my car bombing
it was amateur night
you could tell
whoever it was they put
the dynamite under the passenger side
but what they didnt know
what nobody outside the factory knew
was that that model car was made with
a metal plate under the drivers seat
lts the only thing
that saved my life
the bombing was never authorized
but l suspect l know who lit the fuse
man  hey nicky
ace narrating
and so did the powers that be
how are you
how you doin
nicky narrating  lt took months
for everything to calm down
but finally
my guys got out on bail
and the bosses wanted me to send
my brother dominick out to vegas
always the dollars
always the fuckin dollars
l mean it was still way too hot
for me to even go near vegas
so l set up a meeting
with the guys way out in the sticks
l didnt want my brother to get fucked
around l mean whats right is right

sirens blaring
firemen chattering
chatter continues

groans

choir singing
choir continues
ace narrating
the town will never be the same
after the tangiers
the big corporations took it all over
today it looks like disneyland
choir continues
ace narrating  and while the kids
play cardboard pirates
mommy and daddy drop the house payments
and juniors college money
on the poker slots
ln the old days dealers knew your name
what you drank what you played
today its like checkin
into an airport
and if you order room service
youre lucky if you get it by thursday
today its all gone
you got a whale show up
with four million in a suitcase
and some 25yearold hotel school kid is
gonna want his social security number
after the teamsters
got knocked out of the box
the corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos
and where did the money come
from to rebuild the pyramids
junk bonds
still not sure
bell ringing
probable maybe questionable
let me know as soon
as you can find out
ace narrating
but in the end l wound up
right back where l started
l could still pick winners
and l could still make money
for all kinds of people back home
and why mess up a good thing
and thats that
subs by tarun bansal
man
sometimes l wonder why
l spend the lonely nights
dreaming of a song
the melody
haunts my memory
and l am once again with you
when our love was new
and each kiss an inspiration
ah but that was long ago
and now my consolation
ls in the stardust of a song
beside a garden wall
when stars were bright
and you were in my arms
the nightingale
told his fairy tale
of paradise
where roses grew
though l dream in vain
