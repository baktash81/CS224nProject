an8male narrator there are
only two ways to live your life
an8one is as though nothing is a miracle
an8the other is as though
everything is a miracle
an8i choose to believe the latter
and for good reason
an8my mother is always reminding me
an8there is often more to things
than meets the eye
an8that if we can zoom out a little
an8well realize that life
is happening for us not to us
an8and if we just allow it to
an8the ride can be beautiful
awesome and fantastic
she never said that it would be easy
look i get it it doesnt always seem
like rainbows and butterflies
chris
its hard to zoom out
in a moment like this
its hard to believe that this
was life happening for me
chris
chris please wake up
chris or for any of us
it certainly didnt feel like
there could be anything good
about this situation
but hang on
im getting ahead of myself
this story really starts
years before i was even born
players shout
whistle blows
pressure
here we go
chris with another kid
from another part of the world
whistle blows
safe
back off

whistle blows
what about jorge

bolivar

jorge gasps
chris jorge bolivar and i
could not have been further apart
i was from
a middleclass american family
jorge was practically cuban royalty
siren wails
who would have believed
that our lives and our families
would come together in a way
none of us could have imagined
the surgery looks to be a success
hes on his way to the icu right now
oh thank god
we did have to remove
the lower lobe of his left lung
hell still be able to breathe
but i need to warn you
the disease is progressive
you need to prepare yourself
for the fact
that your son most likely
wont make it to 20
we were told he wouldnt make it to 12
my advice is to not let him
exert himself too much
he just doesnt have the lung capacity
papa
were here son
youre going to be all right
youre a fighter
im a fighter
youre a fighter
chris and he was a fighter
he took every day as it came

shes fine thank god

two years ago my mom

she was driving to pick me
and my brother up from the airport
when some guy
coming home from a late night
crossed over the center divider
and hit her head on
and she went into a coma and
we didnt know if she was gonna make it
we were sitting there waiting
and it just felt like forever
and while praying for her to wake up
i made a deal with the big guy
that if she was ok
then i would do whatever i could
to make sure other people stayed safe
and so here we are
wow
thats a uh
thats a pretty deep layer sam
hmm
i think shes beautiful
you two are beautiful

chris so heres the thing
thats not what really happened
slow steady breathing
it would have been nice
hmm it would
have been more than nice
perfect wife
perfect family
all i could ever want
and more
but it turns out life had
something else in store for me
wind whistles
machinery hums
they ran every test
you can imagine on me
ct mri blood
oxygen levels the works
and everything seemed to be fine
except for one little thing
knocking at door
doctor
the mri shows bleeding
in the frontal lobe of your sons brain
there is no sign of trauma
so its possible he may have
some type of aneurism
or a bleeding arterial
venous malformation
english please
its basically a leaking blood vessel
so whats next
were planning to drain some fluid
and relieve the pressure on his brain
i dont understand
he was perfectly healthy
we just saw him last week
about two percent of the population
have this kind of issue
and never even know it
even if it leaks
its not necessarily fatal
most of the time it isnt
what do you mean most of the time
he just looks like hes sleeping
well know more in the morning
in the meantime
you should all get some rest
theres a hotel down the street
chris listen to me
its dad
i love you son
now put your hand in gods hand ok
put your hand in gods hand
good morning
doctor good morning
we should talk
christophers condition
has seriously deteriorated overnight
im afraid
theres no other way to say this
this is death
we have to do one last test on him
to verify that he is braindead
then we will take him off
all of the machines
sobs
doctor im so sorry
grace can we wait until
his brother john gets here
doctor yes of course
we can wait until youre ready
we cant actually allow for this
theyre gonna give parts of him away
like a junked car
grace honey
no im not ok with this
mom you cant agree to this can you
its what he wanted
door opens
door closes
groans
hey big little brother
usually every time were alone
you do most of the talking
im not used to this
wheres your wisecrack jokes
when i need them huh
i know i give you a hard time
most of the time
work harder study stronger
what does it even matter now huh
i am sorry
for so many things
you know its
you know its because i love you
right
chris
look i need you to hear me
i love you
and im proud
proud to be your big brother
bye buddy
mr gregory there are planes
flying all over the country tonight
because of your boy
we have matches for
all the abdominal and thoracic organs
heart lungs liver pancreas
kidneys and eyes
your son is saving five lives
will we uh
will we ever find out who they are
doctor maybe someday
who knows
maybe youll get a letter
maybe not
sometimes folks write
sometimes families meet
it isnt easy
but it can happen
only through the agency though
no names or addresses are shared
just general age sex and location
but i wouldnt expect too much
theyve all been fighting
their own battles
thank you
thank you
thank you so much for being here
clears throat
my family and i appreciate
your prayers for chris
if theres anything
you could do for us its uh
its this
before you go to sleep tonight
please call someone you love
and tell them
call a friend
or a relative
you havent talked to in a while
and dont ask them about
their grades or their cellphone bill
just tell them
how much you love them
thank you all for coming
thank you
inhales
im alive
im alive im
im alive
whos whos in here breathing for me
an angel thats all we know
ok
ok
yes
groene hart
by we are the west
the souls of the righteous
are in the hand of god
and no torment shall touch them
in the eyes of the foolish
they seem to have died
their departure
thought to be an affliction
and their going from us
to be their destruction
but they are at peace
for though in the sight of men
they were punished
their hope is full of immortality
i will always love you
oh
the nurses are calling him superman
no one can believe
how well youre recovering
i feel half my age doctor
who was he
i cant release
that kind of information
we need to know please
i will check with the organ agency
and see what theyll release
but i think we should
get you home first
thank you
doctor youre welcome
its handwritten and uh
they blacked out his name
and his signature
read it
to whoever and his family
i understand i am
the recipient of a gift
from a relative of yours
that is beyond repayment
i cannot imagine the grief
caused by your loss
and there are no words anyone can say
or write to extinguish that pain
nevertheless you have shared with me
the grandest gift i will ever receive
the gift of life
grace
honey come here
what
uh
they gave christopher a name
what is it
gabriel
the archangel of new life
and incarnation
our boy
their angel
gabriel
gabriel was
their 19yearold son christopher
he was in love with a girl named sam
the parents lost their son
and she lost her love
he was just a boy you know
he was just a boy
chris is here
hes with me
im going to take good care of him
thank you
hi
hi im grace
hi
leslie nice to meet you
chris go ahead take my eyes
theyre no use to me now
but just know that when they look
at some little children playing
ill be smiling with them
take my heart so someone else
can live and love and
with this gift know that my love
remains in this world
take my lungs so someone else can sing
and if you listen carefully
youll hear that im singing with them
im sorry i didnt have more hugs
to give and jokes to tell
i did my best to make others smile
and when i die i wont be here
ill be everywhere
so thats my story
and it didnt happen the way
any of us would have expected
