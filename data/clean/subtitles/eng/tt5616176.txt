  an8 male narrator  there are
only two ways to live your life 
  an8 one is as though nothing is a miracle 
  an8 the other is as though
everything is a miracle 
  an8 i choose to believe the latter 
and for good reason 
  an8 my mother is always reminding me 
  an8 there is often more to things
than meets the eye 
  an8 that if we can zoom out a little 
  an8 we ll realize that life
is happening for us  not to us 
  an8 and if we just allow it to 
  an8 the ride can be beautiful 
awesome and fantastic 
she never said that it would be easy 
look  i get it  it doesn t always seem
like rainbows and butterflies 
chris 
it s hard to zoom out
in a moment like this 
it s hard to believe that this
was life happening for me 
chris 
chris  please wake up 
chris  or for any of us 
it certainly didn t feel like
there could be anything good
about this situation 
but hang on 
i m getting ahead of myself 
this story really starts
years before i was even born   
   players shout 
   whistle blows 
pressure 
here we go 
chris     with another kid
from another part of the world 
   whistle blows 
  safe 
back off 
come on 
 whistle blows 
what about jorge 
  does he have the wind 
  three minutes left 
 blows whistle 
bolivar 
bolivar  come on 
you re in  i need you in midfield 
you need to put pressure on 
we need a goal  ok  we need the win 
make it happen 
  ok 
  make it happen 
let s go  boys 
yes  push it up 
get to the middle 
   whistle blows 
   jorge gasps 
chris  jorge bolivar and i
could not have been further apart 
i was from
a middle class american family 
jorge was practically cuban royalty 
 siren wails 
who would have believed
that our lives and our families
would come together in a way
none of us could have imagined 
the surgery looks to be a success 
he s on his way to the icu right now 
oh  thank god 
we did have to remove
the lower lobe of his left lung 
he ll still be able to breathe 
but i need to warn you 
the disease is progressive 
you need to prepare yourself
for the fact
that your son most likely
won t make it to 20 
we were told he wouldn t make it to 12 
my advice is to not let him
exert himself too much 
he just doesn t have the lung capacity 
papa 
we re here  son 
you re going to be all right 
you re a fighter 
i m a fighter 
you re a fighter 
chris  and he was a fighter 
he took every day as it came
as borrowed time 
hey  the phone s been ringing for you
all afternoon  george

 castro speaking spanish 
hello

unpredictable

that john and i would go
to the same college and   
do the whole roommates thing  you know 
yeah  i know 
you know what  i think i m   
i m just gonna go downstairs 
thanks for the  uh    the food

maybe he s right 
come here  your mom needs some love 
your mom needs some love 
chris  aw 
you know i can see
what you re doing 
this is kind of obvious 
i just want you to remember
that when things don t work out 
there s always a reason 
we just might not see it
in the moment   
what s the reason 
john might actually crack a smile
for once if i went to school with him 
maybe 
and maybe there s something
for you at loyola 
ah  because life is happening
for me  not to me  right 
oh  look at my smart son
listening to his mom 
yeah  you know  when you say words 
i actually hear them  it s weird 
that s very good to know 
now  i want you to call your brother
colin and tell him the good news 
yes  ma am 
go on  go on 
  i m kidding 
  i ll just go listen over here 
yeah  ok 
hey  man  what s up 
yeah  no  no  i m good 
uh  look  i was just calling
to let you know
that your better looking  more talented 
smarter little brother
is coming to loyola  so get ready 
chris  my mom was right 
i had to trust that
there was a bigger reason
things were happening
the way they were 
and same for jorge 
after all  he did make it past 20 
all the way to 30 
and he was just about
to meet his bigger reason 
lunch menus  lunch menus

 coughs 
sir 
listen  is there anything i can do to
make take off a little easier for you 
you could hold my hand 
 chuckles 
it would make it a lot easier
for me to breathe
if you were holding my hand 
i think this might actually help 
there you go 
and how s that 
one small step in the right direction 
  peanuts 
  getting warmer

when some guy
coming home from a late night
crossed over the center divider
and hit her head on 
and she went into a coma and   
we didn t know if she was gonna make it 
we were sitting there waiting
and it just felt like forever 
and while praying for her to wake up 
i made a deal with the big guy 
that if she was ok 
then i would do whatever i could
to make sure other people stayed safe 
and so  here we are 
wow 
that s a  uh   
that s a pretty deep layer  sam 
hmm

it is beautiful when you find a cause
that you re passionate about 
  that s good

that person that helps make life
so much sweeter than it already is 
the one that makes
the ordinary extraordinary 
and makes you do things
you wouldn t normally do 
and avoid some of the things
that you re supposed to do

chris  so  here s the thing 
that s not what really happened 
 slow steady breathing 
it would have been nice 
hmm  it would
have been more than nice 
perfect wife 
perfect family 
all i could ever want 
and more 
but it turns out life had
something else in store for me 
 wind whistles 
 machinery hums 
they ran every test
you can imagine on me 
ct  mri  blood 
oxygen levels  the works 
and everything seemed to be fine 
except for one little thing 
 knocking at door 
doctor 
the mri shows bleeding
in the frontal lobe of your son s brain 
there is no sign of trauma 
so it s possible he may have
some type of aneurism
or a bleeding arterial
venous malformation 
english  please 
it s basically a leaking blood vessel 
so  what s next 
we re planning to drain some fluid
and relieve the pressure on his brain 
i don t understand 
he was perfectly healthy 
we just saw him last week 
about two percent of the population
have this kind of issue
and never even know it 
even if it leaks 
it s not necessarily fatal 
  most of the time  it isn t 
  what do you mean  most of the time 
he just looks like he s sleeping 
we ll know more in the morning 
in the meantime 
you should all get some rest 
there s a hotel down the street 
chris  listen to me 
it s dad 
i love you  son 
now  put your hand in god s hand  ok 
put your hand in god s hand 
  good morning 
  doctor  good morning 
we should talk 
christopher s condition
has seriously deteriorated overnight 
i m afraid
there s no other way to say this 
this is death 
we have to do one last test on him
to verify that he is braindead 
then we will take him off
all of the machines 
 sobs 
doctor  i m so sorry 
grace  can we wait until
his brother john gets here 
doctor  yes  of course 
we can wait until you re ready 
we can t actually allow for this 
they re gonna give parts of him away 
like a junked car 
  grace  honey 
  no  i m not ok with this 
mom  you can t agree to this  can you 
it s what he wanted 
 door opens 
 door closes 
 groans 
hey  big little brother 
usually  every time we re alone 
you do most of the talking 
i m not used to this 
where s your wisecrack jokes
when i need them  huh 
i know i give you a hard time   
most of the time 
 work harder  study stronger  
what does it even matter now  huh 
i am sorry   
for so many things

heart  lungs  liver  pancreas 
kidneys  and eyes 
your son is saving five lives 
will we  uh   
will we ever find out who they are 
doctor  maybe someday 
who knows 
maybe you ll get a letter 
maybe not 
sometimes folks write 
sometimes families meet 
it isn t easy 
but it can happen 
only through the agency  though 
no names or addresses are shared 
just general age  sex  and location 
but    i wouldn t expect too much 
they ve all been fighting
their own battles 
thank you 
thank you 
thank you so much for being here 
 clears throat 
my family and i appreciate
your prayers for chris

and tell them 
call a friend 
or a relative
you haven t talked to in a while 
and don t ask them about

yes 
    groene hart 
by we are the west 
the souls of the righteous
are in the hand of god 
and no torment shall touch them 
in the eyes of the foolish 
they seem to have died 
their departure
thought to be an affliction
and their going from us
to be their destruction 
but they are at peace 
for though  in the sight of men 
they were punished 
their hope is full of immortality 
i will always love you 
oh 
the nurses are calling him superman 
no one can believe
how well you re recovering 
i feel half my age  doctor 
who was he 
i can t release
that kind of information 
we need to know  please 
i will check with the organ agency
and see what they ll release 
but i think we should
get you home first 
thank you 
doctor  you re welcome 
it s handwritten  and  uh   
they blacked out his name
and his signature 
read it 
 to whoever and his family 
i understand i am
the recipient of a gift
from a relative of yours
that is beyond repayment 
i cannot imagine the grief
caused by your loss
and there are no words anyone can say
or write to extinguish that pain 
nevertheless  you have shared with me
the grandest gift i will ever receive 
the gift of life  
grace 
honey  come here 
what 
uh   
they gave christopher a name 
what is it 
gabriel 
the archangel of new life
and incarnation 
our boy 
their angel 
gabriel 
gabriel was
their 19 year old son christopher 
he was in love with a girl named sam 
the parents lost their son
and she lost her love 
he was just a boy  you know 
he was just a boy 
chris is here 
he s with me 
i m going to take good care of him 
thank you 
  hi 
  hi  i m grace 
hi 
leslie  nice to meet you 
chris  go ahead  take my eyes 
they re no use to me now 
but just know that when they look
at some little children playing 
i ll be smiling with them 
take my heart so someone else
can live and love and   
with this gift  know that my love
remains in this world 
take my lungs so someone else can sing 
and if you listen carefully 
you ll hear that i m singing with them 
i m sorry i didn t have more hugs
to give and jokes to tell 
i did my best to make others smile 
and when i die  i won t be here 
i ll be everywhere 
so  that s my story 
and it didn t happen the way
any of us would have expected
