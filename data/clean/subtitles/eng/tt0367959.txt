does your pussy run crossways
with a puff of straight hairs
like a little explosion
hannibal
dont move
whistles blowing
the butcher tried to get the knife
while stating he would
kill everyone in the market
well
the butcher was vichy
a collaborator
with the german occupation
hes much hated
and i can deal with him
young man
if youre to be a doctor
you must be careful
with your hands
no more fighting
and never give more
than a single pass
forgive me
i came now to seek revenge
hannibal needs peace
lyre music playing
if youve pissed in my fuel tank
ill twist your head off
paul momund the butcher
ha
you owe a certain lady an apology
apologize to la japonaise
boy you must be crazy to come here
ill throw you in the river
or maybe ill split your pants
and give you something you dont want
where you dont want it
you inquired about her pussy
you speculated it ran which way
jap pussy runs crossways
you should fuck that little jap
and see for yourself huh
crossways like that
gasping
aah
or more tangential to the spine
aah
aah
aah
ooh
do you see how your mouth
stains the air
i should add that to my drawing
would you like to see it
aah aah
screaming
body hits ground
yum
wait for me
you see it was made
with a single blow
ah inspector popil
im very happy you could come
you wont remember me
but i was with the
of course
you delivered de rais to nuremburg
and sat behind him
i saw you bring the evidence
its an honor sir
what do we have here
paul momund or most of him
you have his dossier
yes
fat and ugly
he shipped jews from marseille
he fought recently
and often
last saturday night a bar fight
he had many enemies
a list please
his recent opponents
youve done nothing to this body
oh no no no monsieur
no no
the chief specifically
the odor
its not of anything you use here
it smells like that toothache remedy
yes oil of cloves
lets see the pharmacist
look
the most exquisite bits of the fish
are the cheeks
this is true for many creatures
when carving at the table
you give one cheek to madame
the other to the guest of honor
did you hear
they havent found the butchers
damned ugly head yet
distant rustling
good evening my lady
gasps
i hope you dont mind
i wouldve used a butchers knife
but the sword seemed so appropriate
not a nick in the blade
i promise you
the butcher was like butter
you didnt need to do this for me
rudeness is epidemic my lady
horn honks outside
police
they will call it murder
at worst a crime of passion
wash your hands
quickly
go
inspector popil
popil madame
popil
hannibal lecter
good evening
you fought with the butcher
paul momund in the market
now he is dead
i must ask you
to come along with me
man is your name hannibal lecter
yes
do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of paul momund
guilty knowledge
limit your responses to yes or no
no
its vanilla
he reacts to nothing
its monstrous
the butcher had been fishing
there was blood and scales
on his knife but no fish
the tape tells you all that
remarkable
no
the chef told me you brought
a splendid fish in for dinner
where did you get that fish
by fishing inspector
we keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse
ill show you if you like
my specialty is war crimes
and i know they
do not end with the war
you lost your entire family
so did i
and for you your beautiful aunt came
and made up for it all
the very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp
so when paul the butcher
spewed filth at her
i can understand if you killed him
tell me what happened hannibal
together we could
show a court there was
the very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp
do you compose verse inspector
and keep it under your pillow
now tell me inspector
did you choose war crimes
because you lost family
in the war
yes
how
some in combat
some were shipped east
did you catch who did it
no
but they were vichy
men like the butcher
yes
then we are both suspects
i can say you were
fishing with me if you like
knock on door door opens
man inspector you should see this
i told you
keep these people away
crowd chattering
its the butcher
yes sir
how long
officer ten minutes
no longer
wait here please
madame so sorry to disturb you
i was passing with the papers
um your legal residency
in france is threatened madame
we can delay the death duties
so you can stay in the house
for the time being
but inevitably the state will take it
and sell it at auction
you will have to let the staff go
good night
father mother
im the youngest student
theyve ever admitted into medical school
its a work scholarship
i think you would be pleased
death duties on my uncles estate
have finally forced the sale
of the chateau
lady murasaki
will leave for paris with me
this work scholarship means
i must spend much of my spare time
preparing bodies
for the anatomy class
my studies are fascinating
and absorb me completely
yet i still find myself thinking
about my sister
and the men who took her from me
mischa let me go
do you suppose god
intended to eat isaac
thats why he told
abraham to kill him
eat him
of course not
the angel intervenes in time
not always
i have to know about mischa
i can see their faces in my dreams
but i cant remember what they called
each other with their bloody mouths
i would give anything to remember
hannibal
memory is a knife
it can hurt you
i want to stay here with you
no
you must stay at school
popil louis
i need you to remember
who told the nazis
where the children were hidden
you must remember
i cant bear to think about it
this will help you remember
hannibal lecter
what are you doing here
the body
im a medical student now
yes i know
i have followed your progress
you repeat nothing
you hear in this room
louis coughing
popil please louis
klaus barbie shipped
the children to auschwitz
who told him
where the children were hidden
did you tell him
when they broke my fingers
i gave them pardou
pardou knew where
the children were hidden
hes mayor of belleville now
laughs
thank you louis
inspector
yes
where were the police
spits
priest praying in latin
louis no no no
please please
priest continues praying
you knew at once
what louis wanted didnt you
his crucifix to remain with his brain
not his heart
he answered your question
but you didnt answer his
where were the police when the nazis
threw the children into the trucks
praying
soft piano music playing
thunder crashes
