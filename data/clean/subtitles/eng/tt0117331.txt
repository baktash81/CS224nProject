a small boy watched helplessly as
his father was killed by the pirate leader 
the evil kabai sengh 
he jumped overboard
and was washed ashore
on a mysterious jungle island
called bengalla 
it seemed like a case of
 out of the frying pan and into the fire  
but the touganda tribesmen
meant the boy no harm 
they scooped him up
and carried him to their village 
and that night  in an ancient
ceremony of fire and drums 
the tribal shaman presented the boy
with a ring of great significance 
the boy understood that he was
destined to avenge his father s death
by fighting piracy  greed and cruelty
in all their forms 
when he grew to be a man 
he became the phantom 
  damn worthless map 
  you drive  i ll navigate 
  the map is all wrong 
  the map is good  quill 
remember its source 
it can t be wrong 
then why does it show a bridge back
there  we never crossed any bridge 
  what s he saying  morgan 
   urn around  
  we d better turn around 
  not a chance 
maybe this little quitter
needs a lesson in positive thinking 
quill  now i get it 
turn the map around 
  it s upside down  you big moron 
  you big moron 
if the map is upside down 
there ought to be a bridge up ahead 
all i see is more jungle 
oh  shit 
hey  quill  no sudden stops 
what s the big idea 
hey  take a look at that 
  what do you think  
  i don t know 
it looks like it ll hold 
but then again   
breen  styles 
  i d hate to bet my life on it  quill 
  same here 
ok 
we ll go over on foot 
all except one 
he ll stay back
and drive the truck across 
yeah  but which one 
  i knew that bridge was safe 
  come on  kid 
almost there 
the brake  use the brake 
ok  back in the truck 
well  it s on foot from here 
ok  zak  take a look  which way  
  what s his problem now  
  he says we can t go on 
  these woods are protected 
  oh  yeah  protected by who 
by a ghost 
 the ghost who walks  
i wouldn t worry about that 
  he s not taking us beyond this point 
  shoot him 
no  we may need him 
to drive the truck back
across the bridge 
tie him up and leave him here 
we can find our own way 
this is it  we re there 
everybody look around 
well  you look like an important fella 
hey  quill  up here 
  got it 
  mr drax is going to be very happy 
  what s so important about that thing 
  i don t know 
i don t like to ask drax questions 
his answers scare me 
styles 
  what the hell happened 
  he s dead 
the damn thing came alive
and choked him to death 
  it s not possible 
  tell styles 
  let s get out of here 
  what about all the other stuff 
  there s a lot of valuable junk in here 
  take it all  nobody s going to miss it 
now what 
  drums 
  i know that  what does it mean 
it don t mean nothing 
but hurry up  just the same 
devil  somebody needs us 
this place is really
giving me the creeps 
what the hell is that 
shoot him 
  oh  shit 
  run 
no 
watch him  devil 
if he moves  eat him 
  what about breen 
  tough luck  forget him 
  who was that guy  
  somebody i already killed 
  what 
  you heard me  i killed him years ago 
guess what  he s back 
at least he s behind us 
did i get him 
i don t see him 
you must have hit him 
so long  pal 
keep the truck 
  ghost who walks 
  oh  yeah 
it s ok  now 
hold on  it ll be all right 
put them in the guardhouse 
  what have you got here  poachers 
  looters  captain 
captain  you ve got a problem 
you ve got a thing out there 
a big  strange looking thing on a horse 
  with a wolf 
  get him out of here 
he s been chewing
on the wrong kind of jungle growth 
you know what he s talking about 
we both do 
not now  weeks  i m not in the mood 
 the ghost who walks  
the phantom 
it s nonsense 
according to legend  he s immortal 
he s been around for four centuries 
imagine  400 years  it isn t possible 
ouch 
  did that sting 
  yes 
good  that means it s working 
this is it 
this is what i m looking for 
the skulls of touganda 
one made of gold 
one made of silver  one made of jade 
are they valuable 
more than that  guran 
they re dangerous 
listen   hen placed together 
the three skulls harness an energy
a thousand times greater than any
force or high explosive known to man  
it s all right here in the chronicles 
 a long time ago  the touganda tribe
possessed the skulls 
 hey knew the secret
of keeping their force contained 
 heir village was attacked
by pirates of the sengh brotherhood 
 he tribe was destroyed and
the skulls were separated and lost 
 for four centuries 
there s been no trace of them   
until today 
you know  i m fine 
i m as good as new 
very well  ghost who walks 
maybe later 
yeah  maybe   
i used to come here myself  kit 
i would consult the chronicles
for guidance and wisdom 
usually when i was troubled
or confused 
or had just screwed up real bad 
i m guilty on all counts  dad 
i let that skull slip through my fingers 
don t be too hard on yourself 
we all make mistakes 
  this one gets worse   
  how so 
it was the sengh brotherhood 
i saw the spiderweb tattoo 
you turned over one of the skulls
of touganda to the sengh brotherhood 
they ve tried to get their hands
on those skulls for 400 years 
they don t have all three 
we don t know how many they have 
have you any idea what it means 
if they get control of the skulls 
  they d be invincible 
  then stop them 
you re the only one who can 
excuse me  ghost who walks 
  yes  guran 
  i thought i heard   
  were you talking to somebody  
  just to myself  i was talking to myself 
i beg your pardon 
you can t park there 
oh  miss palmer 
i didn t realise  i m very sorry 
forget it  i d throw me out  too 
if i didn t know better 
welcome back  miss palmer 
  let me help you with those things 
  thank you 
oh  diana 
mother 
  you look absolutely stunning 
  your timing couldn t be worse 
  but how are you  sweetheart 
  lily  you look marvellous 
  i ve contracted malaria  mother 
  that s nice 
  diana 
  uncle dave 
  sorry  i didn t realise it was a party 
  it s nothing 
just a palmer foundation dinner 
i m much happier to see you 
  how was the yukon 
  dave  it s cold 
what more do you want to know  
well  why don t you freshen up 
  i ll get something to eat 
  jimmy wells would love to see you 
hello  xander 
lily  why is xander drax here 
he made a very large contribution
to the foundation 
  return it 
  but he s a respected businessman 
no  lily  he s a thug 
hi  mr drax 
i had the strangest urge
a few weeks ago 
i wanted to charter a plane 
track you down in the frozen north 
charge into your tent  hut or log cabin 
sweep you off your feet 
and bring you back to new york 
really  jimmy   why didn t you 
after a few sets of tennis
and a cold gin fizz 
the urge just seemed to pass 
you re pretty
in those woodsy flannels 
you have to admit  diana   
there s magic there 
what s in the sandwich 
baloney 
mayor  commissioner 
enjoying yourselves 
  as much as i can in this monkey suit 
  wonderful  you ve outdone yourself 
  thank you  mayor 
  excuse me 
  here s the man i want to see 
  you re not welcome here  mr drax 
the police commissioner is right here 
have me arrested 
sample the canap√©s on your way out 
  for god s sake  that s not necessary 
  that s all right  i can speak for myself 
tell me  your reporters are poking
their noses into my personal affairs   
i don t understand why  do you 
yes  and you will 
when we publish our story 
why go after me 
i m just a private citizen 
you own companies
that regulate public utilities 
you control the trade unions 
influence interest rates and stock prices 
and you have involvements
with the zephro crime family 
i d say you re
a very public figure  mr drax 
i ve never heard such tall tales 
have you been talking to my ex wives 
  how much does this newspaper cost 
  two cents daily  five cents on sunday 
no  all of it  the building 
the presses  the typewriters   
  maybe i ll buy the whole damn thing 
  not everything in life is for sale 
of course it is  dave 
and i ll tell you something else 
i usually get what i want 
gentlemen  i have no axe to grind 
i m only interested in the truth 
i ve learnt something
from a source at the city library 
drax has been extensively
researching esoteric volumes 
they are normally kept
under constant lock and key 
he s interested in something
connected with this symbol 
  what does it mean 
  he s on a quest 
for a supernatural power 
these are dangerous times  dictators
are popping up all over the world 
drax already has the desire
to become one himself 
  this will provide him with the means 
  that s nonsense 
i know it s hard to fathom 
but drax believes in it 
this man must be taken seriously 
i ve traced the origin of that symbol
to a place called the bengalla jungle 
this is a ticket for the clipper 
you re not going there 
my plans were to leave tomorrow
and meet up with a captain horton 
but now    i don t know if i can turn
my back on drax for that long 
  it s just a wild goose chase  anyway 
  that s right 
a far off jungle s no place for you 
i agree  you need to stay here
and take care of things 
there you go  dave 
listen to your niece 
  let me go for you 
  i don t know  diana   
i want to go 
you were right  mr drax 
they know far too much 
all right  i ll be there   
  hey 
  call him back 
thank you  sir 
it s ray zephro  our little tootsie
is boarding the plane right now 
say the word and
i ll drag her off by her hair 
thanks  ray  but i have
another way of dealing with this 
after all  i do have friends
in that part of the world 
i ve got to go  dr fleming is here 
the librarian 
dr fleming 
thanks so much for coming 
i don t mind  it s a nice day for a walk 
yes  it certainly is  please  sit down 
so  how can i help you 
you can reassure me that my research
at the library is strictly confidential 
  of course it is 
  really   are you sure 
dave palmer has been
poking his nose into my business 
you have nothing to worry about 
mr drax  your privacy is protected 
all requests for access
to special collections come to me 
i m the only one who sees them 
well  good 
i feel a whole lot better now 
thanks for coming 
oh  one more thing  if you don t mind 
i d like your professional opinion
on something under this microscope 
sure 
here  let me hold your glasses 
  i don t see a thing 
  just turn the focus knob 
i guess you won t be
needing these any more 
  your coffee  miss 
  thanks 
guran  i m leaving 
i m going with zak  what are you
listening to   junior g man  
i wish it was  this is real

  ok 
i want to give you something
to remember me by 
i don t think that s a problem 
well  you won t find these in new york 
black pearls  they re beautiful 
they were a gift to an ancestor
by a grateful arabian prince 
  i want you to have them 
  thank you 
oh  no  not the old pearl ploy again 
that s what passes for humour
in the jungle  diana 
captain horton  diana palmer 
thank god you re all right diana 
  how did you manage to get her away  
  diana did all the work  actually 
not only is he mysterious 
he s modest  too 
old jungle saying 
 phantom is many men  
no smoking in the skull cave 
sorry  i forgot 
i received your uncle s wire  what s
so important as to bring you here 
can you identify this symbol 
you d better have a look 
well  somebody say something 
we re all mixed up
with the sengh brotherhood 
  the what 
  sengh brotherhood 
an ancient order of evil 
they started out as pirates 
nowadays  there s no telling
what they ve become 
  where did you get this 
  new york 
my uncle s newspaper
is investigating xander drax 
he s crazy  power mad 
take her back  use every man
at your disposal and give her protection 
wait 
you re going to send me away  
i m afraid so 
i came here to do a job 
and that s what i m going to do 
there s a lot more i need to know 
goodbye 
  wait a second 
  diana   
  nobody argues with the phantom and wins 
  old jungle saying 
oh  baby   
oh  it is beautiful 
i used a little toothpaste on it 
it polished up so good 
toothpaste  really  
that s nice 
you know 
i am in such a good mood right now 
i almost hate to mention this 
the happy home coming 
kind of brings a tear to the eye 
doesn t it  what went wrong 
  something you didn t count on 
  oh  really  
  and what was that 
  the phantom 
  i thought that was a superstition 
  oh  no  he s real 
and he won t die  i know 
i killed him once and he isn t dead 
  that doesn t make sense 
  look  i brought this to prove it 
see this hole  that s where
i stuck him with a 12 inch blade 
you stabbed him in the back  
i ve underestimated you  quill 
  right up to the hilt 
  that should ve done the trick 
the phantom helped diana to escape 
i think he s in love with her 
this is getting more interesting 
why do you say that 
because he could have had me   
but he picked her 
  that could only be love 
  or simply bad judgement 
  so  what should we do about him 
  do  nothing 
this is new york  i m not concerned
with some jungle hero half a world away 
here  keep the change 
hey 
not so fast  buddy boy 
this isn t real money 
you re right  that s bengalla currency 
coin of the realm
would be appreciated 
  i m afraid that s all i ve got 
  it d better not be 
all right  here   
where is it 
these are opals 
and that s   
  a star sapphire 
take all of them 
don t worry  they re real 
they ll secure your services
for the rest of the day  so wait here 
  you re kidding 
  i never kid 
god is dead 
and darkness rules the earth 
america is in financial ruin 
europe and asia
are on the brink of self annihilation 
chaos reigns 
but like i ve always said 
there is opportunity in chaos 
and so  my brothers 
i give you   
  the skull of touganda 
this skull is one of three 
when all three skulls are united 
they will produce a force
more powerful than any army on earth 
you ve only got the one 
legend has it
that if the skulls are separated 
two of the skulls
will point the way to the third 
  like i said  you ve only got   
  raymond  raymond   
ray  i know the location
of the second skull  ok  
the symbol of the sengh brotherhood 
we shall succeed where they ve failed 
the skulls will be ours  and
all of the power that comes with them 
count me out  this is wrong 
skulls  forces of darkness 
this isn t right 
i was an altar boy at saint timothy s 
so were you  charlie  this isn t right 
we weren t raised this way 
sit down  ray 
the only power i believe in
comes out of the barrel of a gun 
not from some jungle souvenirs 
come on  charlie 
you re on your own  ray 
  what 
  you re on your own 
fine  suit yourself 
but i m gone  drax 
i m taking my entire syndicate with me 
ok  if that s how you feel about it 
my bursitis is really flaring up again 
charlie  you re the new boss of bosses 
  think you can handle it 
  i ve been waiting all my life 
good man 
plans have been set for tonight 
we ll go in and get the item
while the building is closed

  what do you know about drax  
he s come across a rare artefact
connected to the sengh brotherhood 
it s an old silver skull
with precious stones for the eyes 
  i ve seen something like that before 
  you have 
yes  but it wasn t silver 
i think it was green 
green    jade  perhaps 
i mean  where did you see it

drax wants them for himself  i can t let
drax get his hands on this skull

hey  pal  give my best to mr walker 
i love new york 
we re getting close  we re almost there 
  what s that 
  where 
1 1 o clock 
that s it 
there is an island 
take her down 
we re so close now  i can feel it 
history is about to be made 
and you re all a part of it 
an unequal part  of course 
but an important part  nonetheless 
  this one is mine 
  in your dreams 
  take it easy  my brothers  stay calm 
  why do you call us brothers 
we  too  are members of the sengh
brotherhood 
nice going 
come with us 
i think us girls should stick together 
now let me see   
when was the last time
we had visitors here below the ocean 
deep in the bowels
of this uncharted volcanic island 
never  congratulations 
you pathetic doomed fools are the first 
  who are these people 
  my name is xander drax 
  what 
  x a n d e r d r a x 
xander drax 
begins and ends with the letter  x  
from new york city 
and you  sir   as long as we re making
polite introductions and chit chat 
  who might you be 
  he is the great kabai sengh 
leader of the sengh brotherhood 
direct descendant of
the evil kabai sengh   
  first leader of the sengh brotherhood 
you re a long way from new york city 
what brings you to this place 
these brought me here 
the skulls of touganda 
and what do you know
of such matters 
i know all about these skulls
and the power they contain 
once all three are united   
the two i hold   
  and the one you have there 
look  o great one 
i really wasn t in the market
for a partner 
but we have
a mutually beneficial situation here 
think of it this way 
you represent the old guard of grizzled
scallywags and peg leg petes 
i stand for the new order of things 
modern and up to date 
just the man to carry our cause
into the 20th century 
silence 
you have no bargaining power
with me  mr new york city 
i could kill you and
feed your pink ass to the sharks 
besides   
you don t have the fourth skull 
what fourth skull 
what are you talking about 
there is no fourth skull 
the fourth skull controls
the power of the other three 
without it  you ve wasted your time
and your meaningless new york lives 
wait a minute 
anything happens to us 
others will come looking 
they know where we are 
you ll have an army down your throats 
do you want that to happen 
no  that s bullshit 
nobody knows where we are 
  what are you doing 
  shut up 
spirit of adventure  my ass 
it s every man for himself 
ok  kabie  you get me out of here
or else you sleep with the fishes 
what are you going to say about that 
what s that supposed to mean 
just ancient pirate talk for
 fire the cannon  
great kabai sengh 
i m quill  a loyal follower and soldier 
look  i once killed the phantom 
join the club  many of us
have killed him over the years 
but he keeps coming back 
hey  i can see that this phantom thing
really strikes a nerve 
in that case  you re going to love this 
she is his girlfriend 
bring her here 
think of the opportunities this presents 
ransom  bait  revenge 
the phantom has good taste 
good  personal pleasure 
i overlooked that one 
so  what do you say  
the girl for the skull
and i m out of your hair 
  you pirates need to get out more 
  kabai sengh 
phantom 
let s get him 
run away 
ghost who walks 
i ll cut you off at your knee 
you re not immortal 
i know your secrets  phantom 
take them to your grave  kabai sengh 
sala  cut the rope 
  torpedoes 
  this explains all those missing ships 
you and sala can escape in here 
i ll shoot you to the surface 
those are like warheads 
if we hit anything  we re fish food 
we ll use the periscope
to make sure the path is clear 
come on 
  how are you going to get out 
  i ll be right behind you 
at last 
i ve already killed you 
no  you killed my father 
you ve got something
that belongs to me 
no 
  drax  over here 
  what is it 
these skulls are more powerful
than i imagined 
i ve harnessed the energy of the sun 
who needs a fourth skull 
i do  and i know where it is 
i ve worn it all my life  for protection 
i ve never understood
what that meant until right now 
what a cheap jungle trick 
unbelievable 
  end of the line 
  we made it 
it all began 400 years ago 
when a boy saw his father murdered
by pirates of the sengh brotherhood 
that same boy
swore an oath of vengeance 
he would fight piracy 
greed and cruelty in all its forms 
he became the first phantom 
i m his descendant  diana 
sworn to carry out his oath 
the mantle of the phantom
was passed on from father to son 
twenty phantoms came before me 
but no one knew that 
they thought he was the same phantom
and that he was immortal 
that s why they called him
 the ghost who walks  
i m not immortal  diana 
i was born right here in this cave
and educated in america 
when my father was killed 
i came back to take his place 
and one day 
your own son will take your place 
yes 
the plane for miss palmer is waiting 
ghost who walks 
thank you  guran 
  does guran know the truth 
  oh  sure  he just likes to call me that 
goodbye  devil 
take good care of your master 
i d better go 
hey  kit 
  i like her 
  thanks  dad 
well  get going 
before i go   
take off your mask 
let me see your face 
kit 
i m not really permitted
to reveal all of my secrets  diana 
you re not 
actually i am 
but only to one person 
  who s that 
  the woman i intend to marry 
  what if she refuses you 
  no one refuses the phantom 
goodbye 
leave it to my son to let the perfect
woman slip through his fingers
