hmm 
okay  let s try your voice now 
my name is katniss everdeen  i m from district 12 
   my   
  okay  take your time 
still got a lot of swelling in your vocal chords 
 my   
name is   
katniss everdeen  
i want   
i want to talk to him 
he needs time 
but  um  we re trying somethin  new today 
he s been calmer with the doctors 
but they re strangers to him 
so we re gonna test his response
on someone he remembers from home 
someone he trusts 
send her in 
hey 
prim 
how you feelin  
  she s too close 
  mmm  it s okay 
  how d you get here 
  we live in district 13 now 
it s a real place  stories are true 
you were rescued 
my family hasn t come to see me 
there was an attack on 12 
yes 
my family 
the bakery didn t survive 
it s katniss 
  it s because of katniss 
  wasn t because of her 
  she tell you to say that 
  she didn t tell me anything 
she s a liar  prim  it s a trick 
peeta  what you re saying isn t real 
she sent you here to talk to me 
  she knows you re here now 
  it s okay 
she knows    you can t trust her 
she s a monster 
she s a mutt that the capitol created to destroy us 
  get her outta there 
  do you understand me 
you have to kill her  prim  you have to kill her 
  katniss 
  she s a mutt 
this is just a conditioned response 
  kill her 
  it s not him 
she s a monster  she s a mutt 
  no  it s not him 
  she s a mutt 
there s not enough manpower coming in from 4 
i don t think that s a problem 
please  come in 
with any kind of manpower  if we   
will you excuse us for just a moment 
of course 
have a seat 
i m glad you re feeling better 
snow has to pay for what he s done 
i wanna help the rebels in any way i can 
it s hard to see peeta this way 
that s not peeta 
send me to the capitol  i ll do anything 
i can t   
i can t send you there 
we can t get into the capitol until we control district 2 
then send me to 2 
you want me to fire up our troops 
call out to the loyalists  you ve seen what i can do 
yes  i have 
i saw peeta    before we left 
and what did you think 
something selfish 
that you don t have to be jealous of him anymore 
no 
i don t stand a chance if he doesn t get better 
you ll never let him go 
what s going  on in your head 
i don t know 
that s like kissing someone who s drunk 
doesn t count 
30 minutes until touchdown 
prepare for landing 
wrap it up  cut the chatter  let s go 
this is another version of booby trapping a resource 
  right  i see 
  this one s designed to blind 
smoke clings to the eyes 
that s an application of the hummingbird trap 
you scare people so they flee in this direction
into what they think is a safe haven 
two tiered explosion 
you allow people enough time to rush in  help the wounded  then   
  a second bomb 
  right 
second one goes off here 
i guess there are no rules anymore about
what a person can do to another person 
i don t think snow used any rulebook when he hijacked peeta 
welcome to district 2  i m corporal homes 
you follow me  please 
don t worry 
it s just how the loyalists say  good morning  
president coin  we re indebted to you
for the reinforcements and the mockingjay 
but i m not sure that anyone outside of 2
knows what we ve been up against 
this is the nut 
the capitol s headquarters for all offensive operations 
it s manned by both military
and civilian personnel from district 2 
as you can see 
the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock  it s untouchable 
yesterday  we attempted to take the northeastern gate 
the enemy countered from higher up and we were forced to pull back 
we took heavy losses 
could we create a decoy  send troops towards one gate 
launch a staggered attack on another 
whose troops do you propose as a decoy  commander 
we have the mockingjay  don t underestimate her 
we could use her to erode support 
she may be able to sway some of the loyalists 
you ve been underground a long time  madam coin 
this isn t like the rest of panem 
support for the capitol runs deep here 
then there is no sacrifice too great 
we need to control the arsenal inside that fortress 
even with every district in this alliance 
we are outgunned 
i won t commit my people to a ground assault
just to pillage weapons 
commander paylor  your people have suffered
more than just about anyone else at the hands of the capitol 
which is why i won t condone a mass suicide 
if we don t take district 2  we won t get into the capitol 
would it be enough to disable the fortress    instead of taking it 
what do you have in mind 
you think of it like a wolf den 
you re not gonna fight your way in  so you ve got two choices 
you trap the wolves inside  or you flush  em out 
if we can t attack straight on 
then couldn t we use our hovercraft
to strike around it  we ll use the mountains 
we ll hit weak spots in the peaks 
we could design the bomb targets in sequence using seismic data 
trigger avalanches 
block all exits  cut off their supplies 
you make it impossible for them to launch their hovercraft 
bury them alive 
we d forfeit any chance to control the weapons 
yes  but we d face a weakened capitol 
there s civilians in there 
they should be given a chance to surrender 
could use one of the supply tunnels for the evacuees 
it s a luxury we weren t given when they firebombed 12 
there s gotta be a better way 
i suggest we try the avalanche  but leave the train tunnel alone 
civilians can escape into the square 
where our armies will be waiting for their surrender 
we should have every available medic standing by 
and if they won t surrender 
then we will need a compelling voice   
to persuade them 
red flag  this is blue leader 
form up on charlie tango  1 500 meters out 
all bombers are outbound 
what s the difference  katniss 
crushing the enemy in a mine
or blowing  them outta the sky with one of beetee s arrows 
it s the same thing 
we were under attack in district 8 
and that hovercraft wasn t filled with civilians 
doesn t matter 
even if those civilians are just mopping  floors 
they re helping the enemy 
and if they have to die  i can live with that 
no one who supports the capitol is innocent 
with that kinda thinking  you can kill whoever you want 
you can send kids off to the hunger games
to keep the districts in line 
it s war  katniss 
sometimes killing isn t personal 
figured if anyone knew that  it was you 
i  of all people  know that it s always personal 
don t worry  katniss  there ll be survivors 
let s focus on what it is you gotta say 
now  plutarch wrote a speech for you   
i m not saying that 
okay  didn t think so  let s  uh   
but just remember  you re talking to everybody 
not just the rebels  but the capitol 
the survivors in 2 
we want them to lay down their arms 
so you might wanna experiment
with a little sensitivity  warmth 
make it quick  you re exposed 
this is katniss everdeen 
speaking to all of the loyalists from the heart of district 2 
survivors  inbound 
ready  ready  guns up 
on the ready  guns up 
we gotta get you back 
here they come 
weapons tight  weapons tight 
everybody  stand by 
on the ground 
put your weapons down 
get on the ground 
put your weapons down now 
weapons down 
you  put it down 
put it   
  put your weapons down 
  drop it 
drop your weapon  you  drop it 
drop the gun 
drop it 
  hold your fire 
  stop 
stop 
  hold your fire 
  stop 
  hold your fire 
  he needs help 
hold your fire 
drop it 
give me one reason i shouldn t shoot you 
drop the gun 
i can t 
i guess that s the problem  isn t it 
we blew up your mine 
you burned my district to the ground 
we each have every reason to want to kill each other 
so if you wanna kill me  do it 
make snow happy 
i m tired of killing his slaves for him 
i m not his slave 
i am 
that s why i killed cato 
and he killed thresh 
and thresh killed clove 
it just goes around and around 
and who wins 
always snow 
i am done being a piece in his game 
district 12  district 2  we have no fight 
except the one the capitol gave us 
why are you fighting the rebels 
you re neighbors 
you re family 
these people are not your enemy 
we all have one enemy 
and that s snow 
he corrupts everyone and everything 
he turns the best of us against each other 
stop killing for him 
tonight  turn your weapons to the capitol 
turn your weapons to snow 
tonight  turn your weapons to the capitol 
turn your weapons to snow 
hold your fire 
a toast 
antonius  with our best troops crushed in the mountains
and the rebels marching on us as we speak 
what did we celebrate 
the death of the mockingjay  sir 
if peeta didn t kill her  her own arrogance did 
of course 
that s the same facile thinking
that led you to divert our best peacekeepers into district 2 
you have a habit of burying people before they re dead 
if the mockingjay were gone 
the rebels would already be using her as a martyr 
no  minister antonius 
i m afraid that is not what we were toasting at all 
sir  the rebels can be held off out   
the rebels will reach the outskirts of the capitol
in a matter of days 
we ll evacuate the outer blocks to let them in 
i want all anti aircraft defenses ready 
so we re secure from the skies 
lure them into the city 
and then our gamemakers
will make them pay for every inch with blood 
i want every camera watching 
we ll turn their advance into a celebration of suffering 
let each moment be captured for all posterity 
so  what did we toast tonight  minister antonius 
we toasted a glorious era   
coming to its bitter end 
well  there she is  the mockingjay 
oh  that speech you gave  oh  man  feel 
i mean  i still have goose bumps 
you don t mind  do you 
they cut off my supply of morphling 
there s this head doctor that comes in and sees me every day 
trying to help me adjust to reality 
like some guy from this rabbit s warren
actually knows anything about my reality 
at least 20 times in a session  he tells me that i m totally safe 
safe from the capitol 
safe from snow 
what about you  mockingjay  you feeling totally safe 
  till i got shot 
  oh  please 
the bullet didn t even touch you 
cinna saw to that  of course  your costume would be bulletproof 
so what are your injuries 
bruised ribs  bruised lung 
i m surprised they haven t found you a new lung 
i mean  i ve got two  do you want one of mine 
i mean  it s everybody s job to keep you alive 
  is that why you hate me 
  partly 
you re also a little hard to swallow 
the whole tacky romance drama
and the  defender of the hopeless  act 
even though it s not an act 
which makes it even more unbearable 
feel free to take any of this personally 
you should have been the mockingjay 
nobody else would tell you what to say 
but nobody likes me 
  they re afraid of you 
  maybe here 
but    in the capitol  you re the only thing
that they re scared of 
it s just stuff my family brought 
it s from peeta 
yeah 
they messed us up pretty good  didn t they 
we showed him footage of your speech in 2 
he had real memories of you 
that still doesn t mean i m going in there 
he s strapped down  he can t hurt you 
no  this is different  haymitch  i really don t want to 
it doesn t matter what you want  it s for peeta 
what s the harm in trying 
i watched you die 
  you look terrible 
  you ve looked better 
you re not even remotely nice to say that to me now 
i was never the nice one  you were 
when i saw you die  i remembered something 
about the bread 
i remember    you in the rain 
and i burned it on purpose 
to give it to you 
i remember my mother hitting me 
i was supposed to give it to the pig 
that was the first we d eaten in days 
why would i take a beating like that for you 
because you were kind and generous 
  and people said you loved me 
  did people say you love me 
they said that s why snow tortured you  to hurt me 
snow says that everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie 
all i know is that i would have
saved myself a lot of suffering 
if i d just given that bread to the pig 
i think the only thing left to say is  thank you  
i need to be in the capitol 
no  you have done your job 
you ve been very successful as the mockingjay 
you ve unified the districts  and now we want you to rest 
and to heal 
the last the rebels saw me  i was lying on the ground 
katniss  we won t let this momentum go to waste 
we ll shoot more propos right here in 13 
showing them that you re alive 
i should be with the troops 
it ll be like being on the front lines 
as far as the soldiers know 
you survived a bullet to the heart 
i think they ll understand why you re not with them 
when we win this war 
we ll fly you in for the surrender 
we ll need you for the ceremony 
you re very valuable to us 
i ll do whatever you need me to do 
from this day forth  in sickness and in health 
for richer or poorer 
i promise to love and cherish you each day 
i  finnick odair 
take you  annie cresta  as my wife from this day forth 
together or apart  we will always be united 
one life  one purpose  one destiny 
you may kiss the bride 
you saw peeta  didn t you 
did you tell him  hi  for me 
we re old friends  you know 
we had adjoining cells in the capitol 
we re very familiar with each other s screams 
i m going to kill snow 
nothing good is safe while he s alive 
and i can t make another speech about it 
no more cameras  no more propos 
no more games 
he needs to see my eyes when i kill him 
now you re talking 
find a way to the capitol
when everybody s looking the other way 
i hear the medics talking 
they re shipping supplies for the front line
from hangar two around midnight tonight 
medicine  painkillers 
i was gonna go steal some for myself 
but i guess i could just stay here and cover for you 
anybody can kill anybody  katniss  even a president 
you just have to be willing to sacrifice yourself 
go on 
don t you want snow to see you dance 
hey  that s her 
that s katniss everdeen 
hey  thought you were in the hospital 
i was 
come on 
what is she doing 
i don t know  it s so frustrating when she goes rogue 
this isn t just adolescent  it s insubordination 
put her on the first hovercraft back 
don t be ridiculous  she can t come back now 
she s mythic 
at the front lines  surviving a gunshot wound 
couldn t have staged it better myself 
hmm  i know 
she s going to stay where she is 
and whatever she s doing  we conceived it 
it was our plan all along 
of course it was 
mr  heavensbee  you re the gamemaker 
i want everyone to know  whatever game she s playing 
she s playing for us 
i m commander paylor of district 8 
i m a soldier  like all of you  so here s what i know 
for the first time in our lifetimes 
we re standing together with 13 districts 
from what i see here  we ve already made history 
but history doesn t stop to celebrate 
and we re facing an enemy that will not change
and will never surrender 
president snow has pulled back peacekeepers
to fortify the center of the city 
he s evacuating residents from the outer blocks 
these civilians will be confused and desperate 
you are under orders not to target them 
we re deploying medical brigades to help anyone in need 
we ll show the capitol people who we are 
to slow our advance  president snow
is building a minefield of traps
and lethal devices called  pods  
the sadistic inventions of gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths 
if our armies make it past peacekeepers and other defenses 
we ll converge in the center of the city at snow s mansion 
where we won t just unlock his gates 
but unshackle all of panem 
if we die  let it be for a cause and not a spectacle 
if we succeed  let it be for all of panem 
and let it be forever 
yes  you ve already made history 
but the future  our future  starts tomorrow at dawn 
when we march together into the capitol 
squad 451 
looks like you got your meals covered 
  trying  to be prepared 
  don t lie to me 
we ve been hunting together all our lives 
i know when you re gonna go off on your own 
you gonna leave me behind  too 
as your fellow soldier 
i suggest that you stay with your unit 
but i couldn t stop you if you wanted to come 
hawthorne  everdeen  come meet your new unit 
i m lieutenant jackson 
and i wanna introduce you to your squad 
this is second lieutenant mitchell 
best sharpshooter in panem 
these are the leeg sisters  first combat division 
and this is corporal homes 
finnick 
  are you with us 
  looks like it 
that was a short honeymoon 
yeah  well 
i guess we re gonna have to have one in the capitol 
  after we take it 
  gather  round 
squad 451  you re my unit 
lieutenant jackson is my second in command 
each one of you is elite in some form of combat 
but we are a non combat unit 
so we ll be following days behind the front line troops 
you re to be the onscreen faces of the invasion 
 the star squad  
it s been decided that you re most effective
  when seen by the masses 
  so we re not gonna fight 
you ll do whatever you re ordered to do  soldier 
it s not your job to ask questions 
yes  sir 
our instructions are to shoot propaganda footage
on the battle scarred streets of the capitol 
you were handpicked to intimidate their forces 
and inspire surrenders 
even though we ll be working on abandoned streets
miles behind the front lines 
i guarantee you  wherever they put us 
it will not be safe  this is a war zone 
it is likely that we ll encounter both active pods
and peacekeepers 
you re considered high value targets to the capitol 
in the event of capture 
you ll be given a nightlock pill 
a poison that acts immediately 
lieutenant jackson  do the honors 
i ve already briefed you on the pods 
i remind you  they are on every block 
our unit has been given a holo 
a database that contains a detailed map of the capitol
and a list of every known pod 
these pods can trigger anything from bombs
to traps to mutts 
we cannot move without this device 
there s no guarantee that our database is complete 
there could be new pods that we re not aware of 
because we don t want the gamemakers to know
we have this intel  it has a self destruct on it 
you flip this switch  say  nightlock  three times 
and it blows itself and anything within a 10 foot radius 
stay within our unit 
even with the holo 
it is likely that new pods have been set 
whatever they contain  they are meant to kill you 
ladies and gentlemen 
welcome to the 76th hunger games 
i ve never seen this place so empty 
just keep your eyes open 
got a pod  let s take cover 
shoot through those two buildings 
pollux    right here 
castor 
good 
when you re ready  katniss 
hold it  pollux  tighter 
okay 
all clear 
i don t think we can get across this minefield 
not without that holo 
we re not gonna get it off him while he s awake 
let s make sure we re on the same watch tonight 
is that peacekeepers 
451 to base 
we ve got a truck coming in from the south  over 
copy that  over 
stand down  everyone  it s friendly 
my name is peeta mellark 
my home is district 12 
my name is peeta mellark  my home is district 12 
  okay  stop 
  my name is peeta mellark 
  hold up  everyone relax 
  my home is district 12 
what are we doing  
jackson  cuff him 
soldier  this is just a precaution
till we can get everything straightened out  yeah 
my name s peeta mellark  from district 12 
they want us to add him to the propo 
show that he s on our side now 
we ll move forward a few blocks tomorrow
and shoot the new footage 
he s not in control of himself 
i say we schedule an around the clock watch on him 
the leegs till 1700  homes and mitchell till 1900 
give me a watch 
and if it really came down to it 
you think you could shoot him 
i wouldn t be shooting peeta 
i d be killing a capitol mutt 
i m not sure that kind of a comment
recommends you for the job  either  soldier 
put her in the rotation 
he s gonna try to kill me 
especially with all this going on 
it s gonna set him off 
we ll keep him contained 
why would coin do this 
here s all i know 
it was peeta that she wanted rescued from the arena 
she never liked you 
she doesn t like anybody or anything she can t control 
so she would put my life in danger 
she d deny it  but   
what 
one way or another  this war is gonna come to an end 
they promised a free election 
maybe she s starting  to see you as a threat 
nobody would think i d be a leader 
but you d throw your support to someone 
would it be her 
and if your immediate answer isn t  yes  
then you re dangerous 
she doesn t need you as a rallying cry anymore 
these propos can be done without you 
there s only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion 
die 
that s not gonna happen under my watch  katniss 
i m planning  for you to have a long life 
why  you don t owe me anything 
because you ve earned it 
we ve been here before  you know 
what 
that look 
i ve seen that look 
you re trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me 
i never wanted to kill you 
and that s not what i m doing 
i saw it with my own eyes  in the first games 
in the first games  i thought you were
trying to help the careers kill me 
after that  i always saw you    as an ally 
friend  lover   
victor   
enemy  target  mutt 
and now ally 
yeah  i ll add that to the list of words
i use to try to figure you out 
i m sorry 
i just can t tell what s real and what s made up anymore 
then ask  it s what annie does 
ask who 
us  we re your unit now 
your favorite color is green 
is that real 
yeah  that s real 
yours is orange 
not bright orange 
soft  like the sunset 
thank you 
you re a painter 
you re a baker 
you always sleep with the windows open 
you never take sugar in your tea 
you always double knot your shoelaces 
you were right 
i can t do this 
guess we re not leaving  anymore 
we re not going anywhere without that holo 
listen up 
mag s empty 
it s only for the propo 
let s move  we re headed five blocks north 
 to the citizens of the capitol 
our war is not with you  
to the citizens of the capitol 
our war is not with you 
 you will be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory  
be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory 
  you got it

hey  hey  i got you 
it s slowing down 
gamemakers are still putting on quite a show 
  451 to base  over 
  hey  we better move 
if peacekeepers didn t know where we were  they do now 
those surveillance cameras caught us 
451 to base  come in 
this is a bad spot  we need to move now 
451 to base  over 
i can t get a signal 
but i can get us back to base  everdeen  give me the holo 
everdeen  what did i just say  the holo  come on  let s go 
boggs gave it to me 
what are you talking about 
he did  he transferred security clearance to her 
i saw him 
and why would he do that 
i m on special orders from coin 
to do what 
to assassinate president snow 
i don t believe that for one second 
as your new unit commander 
i order you to transfer security clearance to me now 
i can t do that 
let s not lose our heads here 
i m not asking you again  everdeen 
give me that holo 
she s telling the truth  plutarch wants it televised 
he thinks if we could film
the mockingjay assassinating snow 
it ll make the capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high 
while we re arguing 
there s 100 peacekeepers on their way here 
boggs promised me that when the time came 
you would help me 
all right  soldier  holo s yours 
i don t think we re gonna leave any footprints 
we should move now  and those cameras outside
should be covered up by the oil 
she can t move forward like this 
her leg is too bad  we have to evacuate her 
i m sorry 
i ll stay with her 
as soon as we make contact 
we will send somebody back  i promise you 
all right  everybody  move out 
  let s get him up 
  let s go 
can you walk 
come on  this way 
get these curtains closed 
it s the leegs 
good afternoon  i m caesar flickerman 
here with our continuing coverage
of the defense of the capitol 
today  as our peacekeepers valiantly hold off the rebels 
our story takes a surprising twist 
katniss everdeen  our once favorite daughter 
has infiltrated the city
with some of the victors 
whose names are all too familiar 
finnick odair and peeta mellark 
clearly  some alliances don t last forever 
take a look at what happened just a moment ago 
when our peacekeepers cornered katniss everdeen
and her band of foolish rebels 
whatever arrogance
brought this treacherous girl back to us 
you are about to witness a great victory 
not only for the capitol  but for panem 
so there you have it 
katniss everdeen  the girl on fire 
a girl who inspired so much violence 
seems to have met a violent end herself 
stay tuned for more information  caesar flickerman  thank you 
so now that we re dead  what are we gonna do 
isn t it obvious 
the next move is to kill me 
i murdered one of our squad members 
katniss is right 
i m a mutt 
and it s only a matter of time before i snap again 
i m not in control 
i need a nightlock pill  so i can die when i need to 
if it gets to that point  i ll kill you myself 
i don t think i ever really understood
the capitol until now 
you eat like this  you ll believe anything 
so katniss everdeen  a poor unstable girl
with nothing but a small talent
with a bow and arrow  is dead 
not a thinker  not a leader 
simply a face plucked from the masses 
was she valuable 
she was extremely valuable to your rebellion
because you have no vision  no true leader among you 
you call yourselves an alliance 
but we saw what that means 
your soldiers are at each other s throats 
good evening  for those of you who don t know me 
please  allow me to introduce myself 
i am president alma coin  leader of the rebellion 
i have interrupted a broadcast from your president
in which he attempted to defame a brave young woman 
 a face picked from the masses   he called her 
plucked 
as if a leader  a true leader  could be anything else 
i had the privilege of knowing
a small town girl from the seam in district 12
who survived the hunger games and the quarter quell
and rose up and turned
a nation of slaves into an army 
dead or alive  katniss everdeen
will remain the face of this revolution 
she will not have died for nothing 
i had no idea i meant so much to her 
her vision and ours will be realized 
a free panem with self determination for all 
and in her memory  we will all find the strength
to rid panem of its oppressors 
thank you  and be safe 
snow s in his mansion  where is that 
that s us 
that s the city circle 
it s at least 70  75 blocks north 
  seventy five blocks 
  uh huh 
nobody knows we re alive  this is our chance 
these buildings  do these look over snow s gardens 
  i   
  they do 
if he goes outside at all  i could get a clear shot 
we re getting ahead of ourselves here 
whether they re looking for us or not  we are pinned down 
hit that button  scan for pods 
just about every ten steps 
yeah  that doesn t even show the new ones 
so we can t go anywhere in the streets 
and the rooftops are just as bad 
there might be another way 
my brother knows these tunnels really well 
he worked sanitation down here 
right after they made him an avox 
hey  hey 
you gonna be okay  look at me  look at me 
we re gonna get through this  i promise 
took us five years to buy his way outta here 
he didn t see the sun once 
we re too exposed here 
sir  should i call for your doctor 
  what did you say 
  shall i call for your doctor 
i hope you ve wakened me for something more urgent
than an old man s health 
they survived  i don t know how 
we picked them up on a surveillance cam 
let me see  i    i need to see for myself 
it s her 
it is her 
the arena has moved underground 
looks clear 
everybody okay 
yeah

we re gonna stop here for a bit and get some rest  yeah 
i ll take first watch 
hey  peeta  just tuck in there 
all right  settle in  everybody 
katniss  your watch 
you know  the capitol 
they used tracker jacker venom on me 
that s what the doctors in 13 said 
you were stung once  too 
real or not real 
real 
when they used the venom on me 
they would show me pictures of my life 
but some weren t real 
they changed them 
at first  they all    they all blurred together 
but now    now i can sort them out a little 
like the ones that they changed 
they have this quality   
it s like they re shiny  they ve been glossed over 
you should get some rest 
you re still trying to protect me 
real or not real 
real 
that s what you and i do 
keep each other alive 
katniss  katniss  katniss 
katniss

tigris  do you remember me 
i m with plutarch s underground 
we need your help 
clear 
i know you  you were a stylist in the games 
until snow decided i wasn t pretty enough anymore 
i m here to kill him 
gale s gonna need stitches 
i made it up 
all of it 
there is no special mission from coin 
there s only my plan 
everyone that s dead is dead because of me  i lied 
we know  we all knew 
  the soldiers from 13 
  they did  too 
do you really believe that jackson thought
you had orders from coin 
she trusted boggs and he clearly wanted you to go on 
i never meant for this to happen 
i failed  i   
i killed them  i killed finnick 
i m sorry  pollux 
i m so sorry 
glimmer  marvel  mags   
clove  wiress  rue 
what do all those deaths mean 
they mean that our lives were never ours 
there was no real life
because we didn t have any choice 
our lives belong to snow and our deaths do  too 
but if you kill him  katniss   
if you end all of this 
all those deaths  they mean something 
cinna  boggs  castor 
jackson  finnick 
they chose this 
they chose you 
you should keep these clean 
otherwise they ll get infected 
you should cuff me 
it s not safe with me yet 
i have moments when i m here 
and my memories are getting better  but   
other times it s like i m sleepwalking 
you should cuff me 
thanks 
no problem 
i can t sleep 
yeah  i haven t slept in days  either 
i should ve volunteered to take your place in the first games 
no  you couldn t have 
no  she never would have forgiven you 
she needed you to be there
and take care of her family and you did 
she can t lose you 
she really loves you 
and the way she kissed you in the quarter quell 
she never kissed me like that 
oh  just part of the show 
no  no  you won her over 
you gave up everything for her 
well  it s not gonna be an issue much longer 
i doubt all three of us are gonna make it out of this 
and if we do  then   
it s her problem who to choose  right 
yeah 
i do know that katniss will pick
whoever she can t survive without 
mortar shells  it s not ours 
peacekeepers must be shelling  the rebels outside the city 
that s not outside the city 
sun s comm  up 
there s some small arms fire  could be paylor  maybe lyme 
rebels are close 
this is it 
to all capitol citizens
more than a half mile outside the city circle 
i am announcing a mandatory evacuation 
come to the mansion 
i am promising you shelter and sanctuary 
all refugees  come to my home 
there you will be provided with food 
medicine  safety for your children 
and you will have my solemn oath
to protect you until my dying breath 
wish he d hurry up with that last part 
our enemy is not like us  they do not share our values 
they have never known our comfort
and our sophistication 
and they despise us for it  make no mistake 
they are not coming to liberate us 
they are coming to destroy our way of life 
they are coming to bury us 
is he still in the mansion 
peeta 
yeah  i recognize the room 
where is that 
about five blocks away 
we re right here  off the avenues 
mansion s here 
what about the pods 
they ll probably deactivate the pods
around here for the residents  safety 
that could work  i could get close enough 
every peacekeeper s gonna be waiting 
next to our faces on every billboard 
snow s offering shelter to all the refugees 
head straight north 
there s gonna be thousands of refugees 
just get into that stream and don t look up 
we got one shot 
let s make it count 
good luck  katniss 
thank you 
pollux 
tigris  thank you for everything you ve done 
katniss  let me come with you  okay 
i can be a good distraction  they know my face 
  no  i m not losing you again

what if peacekeepers are searching the houses 
and if he s captured

hey  i need you to lie back

fight was over after the capitol
dropped those bombs to defend the palace 
the rebels walked right in 
don t  katniss  the ointment s working 
everybody felt it 
peacekeepers  palace guards  they had kids in there  too 
it was   
it was over after that 
mom 
i remember the first time i brought you here 
and here we are 
i brought all your things 
well  i ll leave you to get settled 
sorry  ma am  can t let you pass 
let her in 
on my authority 
she has a right to anything behind that door 
that s a nice one 
the colors are lovely  of course 
but nothing says perfection like white 
i was hoping you d find your way here 
there are so many things we should discuss 
but i have a feeling your visit will be brief 
so first things first 
i wanted to tell you
how very sorry i am about your sister 
so wasteful  so unnecessary 
anyone could see the game was over by that point 
in fact  i was just about to issue an official surrender
when they released those parachutes 
you released those parachutes 
you really think i gave the order 
we both know i m not above killing children 
but i m not wasteful 
i take life for specific reasons 
and there was no reason for me to destroy
a pen full of capitol children 
none at all 
i must concede  it was a masterful move on coin s part 
the idea that i was bombing
our own helpless children to hold back the rebels   
it turned the last of my guards against me 
there was no resistance left
inside the capitol or the mansion 
do you know it aired live 
there s a particular savvy in that  isn t there 
i m sure she wasn t gunning for your sister  but   
these things happen in war 
my failure was in being so slow to grasp coin s plan 
she let the capitol and the districts destroy one another 
then she stepped in to take power with 13 s arsenal 
oh  make no mistake 
she intends to take my place now 
but i ve been watching you 
and you watching me 
i m afraid we ve both been played for fools 
i don t believe you 
oh  my dear miss everdeen 
i thought we d agreed never to lie to each other 
president coin asked for you 
you never came to see me 
i wanted to  but   
was it ours 
the bomb 
the delayed explosion 
the trap 
to draw more people in 
was that you 
i don t know 
all i know is   
that i was supposed to take care of your family 
now i m sorry i couldn t 
you can t protect anyone in an arena 
goodbye  gale 
what s this 
the remaining victors  won t you join us 
i have invited you all here for several reasons 
but first  i have an announcement 
i have taken the burden and the honor
of declaring myself interim president of panem 
interim  exactly how long is that interim 
we have no way of knowing for certain 
but it s clear that people are far too emotional right now
to make a rational decision 
we ll plan an election when the time is right 
but i have called you here for a far more important vote 
a symbolic vote 
this afternoon  we will execute snow 
hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths 
capitol officials  peacekeepers  torturers  gamemakers 
but the danger is  once we begin 
the rebels will not stop calling for retribution 
thirst for blood is a difficult urge to satisfy 
so i offer an alternative plan 
majority of four may approve it  no one may abstain 
the proposal is this 
in lieu of these barbaric executions 
we hold a symbolic hunger games 
you wanna have another hunger games
with the capitol s children 
  you re joking 
  not in the slightest 
is this plutarch s idea 
it was mine 
it balances the need for revenge
with the least loss of human life 
  you may cast your votes 
  no 
no  obviously not  this is crazy 
i think it s more than fair  snow s got a granddaughter 
i say yes 
so do i  let them have a taste of it 
you guys  this way of thinking
is what started these uprisings 
i vote  no   with peeta 
so would finnick  if he were here 
well  he s not 
  because snow killed him 
  no 
we need to stop viewing each other as enemies 
it s down to katniss and haymitch 
i get to kill snow 
i expected no less of you 
then i vote  yes  
for prim 
haymitch 
i m with the mockingjay 
that carries the vote 
excellent 
we ll announce the games tonight  after the execution 
well  it s bound to be quite the show 
oh  you look lovely as ever 
just beautiful 
finishing touches 
welcome to the new panem 
today  on the avenue of the tributes 
all of panem  a free panem 
will watch more than a mere spectacle 
we are gathered to witness
an historic moment of justice 
today  the greatest friend to the revolution
will fire the shot to end all wars 
may her arrow signify the end of tyranny
and the beginning of a new era 
mockingjay 
may your aim be as true
as your heart is pure 
no 
no 
kill him 
kill him  kill him now 
kill him 
i ll say this for you  katniss 
you don t disappoint 
well  plutarch gave me a letter for you 
i don t want it 
you never make it easy  do you 
okay  i ll read it for you 
 katniss  maybe the country was shocked tonight by your arrow 
but once again  i was not 
you were exactly who i believed you were 
i wish i could give you a proper goodbye 
but with both coin and snow dead 
the fate of the country will be decided tonight 
and i can t be seen at your side 
tonight  the 12 district leaders will call for a free election 
there s little doubt that paylor will carry it 
she s become the voice of reason 
i m sorry so much burden fell on you 
i know you ll never escape it 
but if i had to put you through it again
for this outcome  i would 
the war s over  we ll enter that sweet period
where everyone agrees not to repeat the recent horrors 
of course  we re fickle  stupid beings  with poor memories
and a great gift for self destruction 
although  who knows  maybe this time  we ll learn 
i ve secured you a ride out of the capitol 
it s better for you to be out of sight 
and when the time is right 
commander paylor will pardon you 
the country will find its peace 
i hope you can find yours 
plutarch  
what now 
home 
we go home 
i couldn t let you go without a proper goodbye 
it s your job to take care of yourself now  katniss 
promise me you ll find it 
find what 
the life of a victor 
  goodbye  effie 
  goodbye  my girl 
effie  don t be a stranger 
  take care of her 
  i will 
she s gone 
get out 
get out  prim is gone 
prim is gone 
she s dead  and she s not coming back 
get out  get out 
peeta 
hey 
you came home 
yeah 
i found these  uh  out by the edge of the forest 
it s a primrose 
so sorry  katniss 
 you ll be happy to hear that katniss  mother
has been training new medical units in the capitol 
gale has been promoted to a captain in district 2
to help keep order and security 
and i am loving every moment with my son
who reminds me every day of his father 
we ve all suffered so much 
but we owe it to their memories and to our children
to do our best with these lives 
i hope you re both finding some peace 
annie  
i solemnly swear
to the best of my ability  to preserve  protect 
and uphold the rights of every citizen of panem 
there s plutarch  right in the middle of it all 
and they say no one ever wins the games 
you love me 
real or not real 
real 
did you have a nightmare 
i have nightmares  too 
someday i ll explain it to you 
why they came 
why they won t ever go away 
but i ll tell you how i survive it 
i make a list in my head
of all the good things i ve seen someone do
