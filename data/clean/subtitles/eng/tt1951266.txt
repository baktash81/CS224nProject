my
name is
katniss everdeen
i want
i want to talk to him
he needs time
but um were trying somethin new today
hes been calmer with the doctors
but theyre strangers to him
so were gonna test his response
on someone he remembers from home
someone he trusts
send her in
hey
prim
how you feelin
shes too close
mmm its okay
howd you get here
we live in district 13 now
its a real place stories are true
you were rescued
my family hasnt come to see me
there was an attack on 12
yes
my family
the bakery didnt survive
its katniss
its because of katniss
wasnt because of her
she tell you to say that
she didnt tell me anything
shes a liar prim its a trick
peeta what youre saying isnt real
she sent you here to talk to me
she knows youre here now
its okay
she knows you cant trust her
shes a monster
shes a mutt that the capitol created to destroy us
get her outta there
do you understand me
you have to kill her prim you have to kill her
katniss
shes a mutt
this is just a conditioned response
kill her
its not him
shes a monster shes a mutt
no its not him
shes a mutt
theres not enough manpower coming in from 4
i dont think thats a problem
please come in
with any kind of manpower if we
will you excuse us for just a moment
of course
have a seat
im glad youre feeling better
snow has to pay for what hes done
i wanna help the rebels in any way i can
its hard to see peeta this way
thats not peeta
send me to the capitol ill do anything
i cant
i cant send you there
we cant get into the capitol until we control district 2
then send me to 2
you want me to fire up our troops
call out to the loyalists youve seen what i can do
yes i have
i saw peeta before we left
and what did you think
something selfish
that you dont have to be jealous of him anymore
no
i dont stand a chance if he doesnt get better
youll never let him go
whats going on in your head
i dont know
thats like kissing someone whos drunk
doesnt count
30 minutes until touchdown
prepare for landing
wrap it up cut the chatter lets go
this is another version of boobytrapping a resource
right i see
this ones designed to blind
smoke clings to the eyes
thats an application of the hummingbird trap
you scare people so they flee in this direction
into what they think is a safe haven
twotiered explosion
you allow people enough time to rush in help the wounded then
a second bomb
right
second one goes off here
i guess there are no rules anymore about
what a person can do to another person
i dont think snow used any rulebook when he hijacked peeta
welcome to district 2 im corporal homes
you follow me please
dont worry
its just how the loyalists say good morning
president coin were indebted to you
for the reinforcements and the mockingjay
but im not sure that anyone outside of 2
knows what weve been up against
this is the nut
the capitols headquarters for all offensive operations
its manned by both military
and civilian personnel from district 2
as you can see
the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock its untouchable
yesterday we attempted to take the northeastern gate
the enemy countered from higher up and we were forced to pull back
we took heavy losses
could we create a decoy send troops towards one gate
launch a staggered attack on another
whose troops do you propose as a decoy commander
we have the mockingjay dont underestimate her
we could use her to erode support
she may be able to sway some of the loyalists
youve been underground a long time madam coin
this isnt like the rest of panem
support for the capitol runs deep here
then there is no sacrifice too great
we need to control the arsenal inside that fortress
even with every district in this alliance
we are outgunned
i wont commit my people to a ground assault
just to pillage weapons
commander paylor your people have suffered
more than just about anyone else at the hands of the capitol
which is why i wont condone a mass suicide
if we dont take district 2 we wont get into the capitol
would it be enough to disable the fortress instead of taking it
what do you have in mind
you think of it like a wolf den
youre not gonna fight your way in so youve got two choices
you trap the wolves inside or you flush em out
if we cant attack straight on
then couldnt we use our hovercraft
to strike around it well use the mountains
well hit weak spots in the peaks
we could design the bomb targets in sequence using seismic data
trigger avalanches
block all exits cut off their supplies
you make it impossible for them to launch their hovercraft
bury them alive
wed forfeit any chance to control the weapons
yes but wed face a weakened capitol
theres civilians in there
they should be given a chance to surrender
could use one of the supply tunnels for the evacuees
its a luxury we werent given when they firebombed 12
theres gotta be a better way
i suggest we try the avalanche but leave the train tunnel alone
civilians can escape into the square
where our armies will be waiting for their surrender
we should have every available medic standing by
and if they wont surrender
then we will need a compelling voice
to persuade them
red flag this is blue leader
form up on charlie tango 1500 meters out
all bombers are outbound
whats the difference katniss
crushing the enemy in a mine
or blowing them outta the sky with one of beetees arrows
its the same thing
we were under attack in district 8
and that hovercraft wasnt filled with civilians
doesnt matter
even if those civilians are just mopping floors
theyre helping the enemy
and if they have to die i can live with that
no one who supports the capitol is innocent
with that kinda thinking you can kill whoever you want
you can send kids off to the hunger games
to keep the districts in line
its war katniss
sometimes killing isnt personal
figured if anyone knew that it was you
i of all people know that its always personal
dont worry katniss therell be survivors
lets focus on what it is you gotta say
now plutarch wrote a speech for you
im not saying that
okay didnt think so lets uh
but just remember youre talking to everybody
not just the rebels but the capitol
the survivors in 2
we want them to lay down their arms
so you might wanna experiment
with a little sensitivity warmth
make it quick youre exposed
this is katniss everdeen
speaking to all of the loyalists from the heart of district 2
survivors inbound
ready ready guns up
on the ready guns up
we gotta get you back
here they come
weapons tight weapons tight
everybody stand by
on the ground
put your weapons down
get on the ground
put your weapons down now
weapons down
you put it down
put it
put your weapons down
drop it
drop your weapon you drop it
drop the gun
drop it
hold your fire
stop
stop
hold your fire
stop
hold your fire
he needs help
hold your fire
drop it
give me one reason i shouldnt shoot you
drop the gun
i cant
i guess thats the problem isnt it
we blew up your mine
you burned my district to the ground
we each have every reason to want to kill each other
so if you wanna kill me do it
make snow happy
im tired of killing his slaves for him
im not his slave
i am
thats why i killed cato
and he killed thresh
and thresh killed clove
it just goes around and around
and who wins
always snow
i am done being a piece in his game
district 12 district 2 we have no fight
except the one the capitol gave us
why are you fighting the rebels
youre neighbors
youre family
these people are not your enemy
we all have one enemy
and thats snow
he corrupts everyone and everything
he turns the best of us against each other
stop killing for him
tonight turn your weapons to the capitol
turn your weapons to snow
tonight turn your weapons to the capitol
turn your weapons to snow
hold your fire
a toast
antonius with our best troops crushed in the mountains
and the rebels marching on us as we speak
what did we celebrate
the death of the mockingjay sir
if peeta didnt kill her her own arrogance did
of course
thats the same facile thinking
that led you to divert our best peacekeepers into district 2
you have a habit of burying people before theyre dead
if the mockingjay were gone
the rebels would already be using her as a martyr
no minister antonius
im afraid that is not what we were toasting at all
sir the rebels can be held off out
the rebels will reach the outskirts of the capitol
in a matter of days
well evacuate the outer blocks to let them in
i want all antiaircraft defenses ready
so were secure from the skies
lure them into the city
and then our gamemakers
will make them pay for every inch with blood
i want every camera watching
well turn their advance into a celebration of suffering
let each moment be captured for all posterity
so what did we toast tonight minister antonius
we toasted a glorious era
coming to its bitter end
well there she is the mockingjay
oh that speech you gave oh man feel
i mean i still have goose bumps
you dont mind do you
they cut off my supply of morphling
theres this head doctor that comes in and sees me every day
trying to help me adjust to reality
like some guy from this rabbits warren
actually knows anything about my reality
at least 20 times in a session he tells me that im totally safe
safe from the capitol
safe from snow
what about you mockingjay you feeling totally safe
till i got shot
oh please
the bullet didnt even touch you
cinna saw to that of course your costume would be bulletproof
so what are your injuries
bruised ribs bruised lung
im surprised they havent found you a new lung
i mean ive got two do you want one of mine
i mean its everybodys job to keep you alive
is that why you hate me
partly
youre also a little hard to swallow
the whole tacky romance drama
and the defender of the hopeless act
even though its not an act
which makes it even more unbearable
feel free to take any of this personally
you should have been the mockingjay
nobody else would tell you what to say
but nobody likes me
theyre afraid of you
maybe here
but in the capitol youre the only thing
that theyre scared of
its just stuff my family brought
its from peeta
yeah
they messed us up pretty good didnt they
we showed him footage of your speech in 2
he had real memories of you
that still doesnt mean im going in there
hes strapped down he cant hurt you
no this is different haymitch i really dont want to
it doesnt matter what you want its for peeta
whats the harm in trying
i watched you die
you look terrible
youve looked better
youre not even remotely nice to say that to me now
i was never the nice one you were
when i saw you die i remembered something
about the bread
i remember you in the rain
and i burned it on purpose
to give it to you
i remember my mother hitting me
i was supposed to give it to the pig
that was the first wed eaten in days
why would i take a beating like that for you
because you were kind and generous
and people said you loved me
did people say you love me
they said thats why snow tortured you to hurt me
snow says that everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie
all i know is that i would have
saved myself a lot of suffering
if id just given that bread to the pig
i think the only thing left to say is thank you
i need to be in the capitol
no you have done your job
youve been very successful as the mockingjay
youve unified the districts and now we want you to rest
and to heal
the last the rebels saw me i was lying on the ground
katniss we wont let this momentum go to waste
well shoot more propos right here in 13
showing them that youre alive
i should be with the troops
itll be like being on the front lines
as far as the soldiers know
you survived a bullet to the heart
i think theyll understand why youre not with them
when we win this war
well fly you in for the surrender
well need you for the ceremony
youre very valuable to us
ill do whatever you need me to do
from this day forth in sickness and in health
for richer or poorer
i promise to love and cherish you each day
i finnick odair
take you annie cresta as my wife from this day forth
together or apart we will always be united
one life one purpose one destiny
you may kiss the bride
you saw peeta didnt you
did you tell him hi for me
were old friends you know
we had adjoining cells in the capitol
were very familiar with each others screams
im going to kill snow
nothing good is safe while hes alive
and i cant make another speech about it
no more cameras no more propos
no more games
he needs to see my eyes when i kill him
now youre talking
find a way to the capitol
when everybodys looking the other way
i hear the medics talking
theyre shipping supplies for the front line
from hangar two around midnight tonight
medicine painkillers
i was gonna go steal some for myself
but i guess i could just stay here and cover for you
anybody can kill anybody katniss even a president
you just have to be willing to sacrifice yourself
go on
dont you want snow to see you dance
hey thats her
thats katniss everdeen
hey thought you were in the hospital
i was
come on
what is she doing
i dont know its so frustrating when she goes rogue
this isnt just adolescent its insubordination
put her on the first hovercraft back
dont be ridiculous she cant come back now
shes mythic
at the front lines surviving a gunshot wound
couldnt have staged it better myself
hmm i know
shes going to stay where she is
and whatever shes doing we conceived it
it was our plan all along
of course it was
mr heavensbee youre the gamemaker
i want everyone to know whatever game shes playing
shes playing for us
im commander paylor of district 8
im a soldier like all of you so heres what i know
for the first time in our lifetimes
were standing together with 13 districts
from what i see here weve already made history
but history doesnt stop to celebrate
and were facing an enemy that will not change
and will never surrender
president snow has pulled back peacekeepers
to fortify the center of the city
hes evacuating residents from the outer blocks
these civilians will be confused and desperate
you are under orders not to target them
were deploying medical brigades to help anyone in need
well show the capitol people who we are
to slow our advance president snow
is building a minefield of traps
and lethal devices called pods
the sadistic inventions of gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths
if our armies make it past peacekeepers and other defenses
well converge in the center of the city at snows mansion
where we wont just unlock his gates
but unshackle all of panem
if we die let it be for a cause and not a spectacle
if we succeed let it be for all of panem
and let it be forever
yes youve already made history
but the future our future starts tomorrow at dawn
when we march together into the capitol
squad 451
looks like you got your meals covered
trying to be prepared
dont lie to me
weve been hunting together all our lives
i know when youre gonna go off on your own
you gonna leave me behind too
as your fellow soldier
i suggest that you stay with your unit
but i couldnt stop you if you wanted to come
hawthorne everdeen come meet your new unit
im lieutenant jackson
and i wanna introduce you to your squad
this is second lieutenant mitchell
best sharpshooter in panem
these are the leeg sisters first combat division
and this is corporal homes
finnick
are you with us
looks like it
that was a short honeymoon
yeah well
i guess were gonna have to have one in the capitol
after we take it
gather round
squad 451 youre my unit
lieutenant jackson is my secondincommand
each one of you is elite in some form of combat
but we are a noncombat unit
so well be following days behind the frontline troops
youre to be the onscreen faces of the invasion
the star squad
its been decided that youre most effective
when seen by the masses
so were not gonna fight
youll do whatever youre ordered to do soldier
its not your job to ask questions
yes sir
our instructions are to shoot propaganda footage
on the battlescarred streets of the capitol
you were handpicked to intimidate their forces
and inspire surrenders
even though well be working on abandoned streets
miles behind the front lines
i guarantee you wherever they put us
it will not be safe this is a war zone
it is likely that well encounter both active pods
and peacekeepers
youre considered highvalue targets to the capitol
in the event of capture
youll be given a nightlock pill
a poison that acts immediately
lieutenant jackson do the honors
ive already briefed you on the pods
i remind you they are on every block
our unit has been given a holo
a database that contains a detailed map of the capitol
and a list of every known pod
these pods can trigger anything from bombs
to traps to mutts
we cannot move without this device
theres no guarantee that our database is complete
there could be new pods that were not aware of
because we dont want the gamemakers to know
we have this intel it has a selfdestruct on it
you flip this switch say nightlock three times
and it blows itself and anything within a 10foot radius
stay within our unit
even with the holo
it is likely that new pods have been set
whatever they contain they are meant to kill you
ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the 76th hunger games
ive never seen this place so empty
just keep your eyes open
got a pod lets take cover
shoot through those two buildings
pollux right here
castor
good
when youre ready katniss
hold it pollux tighter
okay
all clear
i dont think we can get across this minefield
not without that holo
were not gonna get it off him while hes awake
lets make sure were on the same watch tonight
is that peacekeepers
451 to base
weve got a truck coming in from the south over
copy that over
stand down everyone its friendly
my name is peeta mellark
my home is district 12
my name is peeta mellark my home is district 12
okay stop
my name is peeta mellark
hold up everyone relax
my home is district 12
what are we doing
jackson cuff him
soldier this is just a precaution
till we can get everything straightened out yeah
my names peeta mellark from district 12
they want us to add him to the propo
show that hes on our side now
well move forward a few blocks tomorrow
and shoot the new footage
hes not in control of himself
i say we schedule an aroundtheclock watch on him
the leegs till 1700 homes and mitchell till 1900
give me a watch
and if it really came down to it
you think you could shoot him
i wouldnt be shooting peeta
id be killing a capitol mutt
im not sure that kind of a comment
recommends you for the job either soldier
put her in the rotation
hes gonna try to kill me
especially with all this going on
its gonna set him off
well keep him contained
why would coin do this
heres all i know
it was peeta that she wanted rescued from the arena
she never liked you
she doesnt like anybody or anything she cant control
so she would put my life in danger
shed deny it but
what
one way or another this war is gonna come to an end
they promised a free election
maybe shes starting to see you as a threat
nobody would think id be a leader
but youd throw your support to someone
would it be her
and if your immediate answer isnt yes
then youre dangerous
she doesnt need you as a rallying cry anymore
these propos can be done without you
theres only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion
die
thats not gonna happen under my watch katniss
im planning for you to have a long life
why you dont owe me anything
because youve earned it
weve been here before you know
what
that look
ive seen that look
youre trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me
i never wanted to kill you
and thats not what im doing
i saw it with my own eyes in the first games
in the first games i thought you were
trying to help the careers kill me
after that i always saw you as an ally
friend lover
victor
enemy target mutt
and now ally
yeah ill add that to the list of words
i use to try to figure you out
im sorry
i just cant tell whats real and whats made up anymore
then ask its what annie does
ask who
us were your unit now
your favorite color is green

boggs gave it to me
what are you talking about
he did he transferred security clearance to her

to assassinate president snow
i dont believe that for one second
as your new unit commander
i order you to transfer security clearance to me now
i cant do that
lets not lose our heads here
im not asking you again everdeen
give me that holo
shes telling the truth plutarch wants it televised
he thinks if we could film
the mockingjay assassinating snow
itll make the capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high
while were arguing
theres 100 peacekeepers on their way here
boggs promised me that when the time came
you would help me
all right soldier holos yours
i dont think were gonna leave any footprints
we should move now and those cameras outside
should be covered up by the oil
she cant move forward like this
her leg is too bad we have to evacuate her
im sorry

we will send somebody back i promise you
all right everybody move out
lets get him up
lets go
can you walk
come on this way
get these curtains closed
its the leegs
good afternoon im caesar flickerman
here with our continuing coverage
of the defense of the capitol
today as our peacekeepers valiantly hold off the rebels
our story takes a surprising twist
katniss everdeen our once favorite daughter
has infiltrated the city
with some of the victors
whose names are all too familiar
finnick odair and peeta mellark
clearly some alliances dont last forever
take a look at what happened just a moment ago
when our peacekeepers cornered katniss everdeen
and her band of foolish rebels
whatever arrogance
brought this treacherous girl back to us
you are about to witness a great victory
not only for the capitol but for panem
so there you have it
katniss everdeen the girl on fire
a girl who inspired so much violence
seems to have met a violent end herself
stay tuned for more information caesar flickerman thank you
so now that were dead what are we gonna do
isnt it obvious
the next move is to kill me
i murdered one of our squad members
katniss is right
im a mutt
and its only a matter of time before i snap again
im not in control
i need a nightlock pill so i can die when i need to
if it gets to that point ill kill you myself
i dont think i ever really understood
the capitol until now
you eat like this youll believe anything
so katniss everdeen a poor unstable girl
with nothing but a small talent
with a bow and arrow is dead
not a thinker not a leader
simply a face plucked from the masses
was she valuable
she was extremely valuable to your rebellion
because you have no vision no true leader among you
you call yourselves an alliance
but we saw what that means
your soldiers are at each others throats
good evening for those of you who dont know me
please allow me to introduce myself
i am president alma coin leader of the rebellion
i have interrupted a broadcast from your president
in which he attempted to defame a brave young woman
a face picked from the masses he called her
plucked
as if a leader a true leader could be anything else
i had the privilege of knowing
a smalltown girl from the seam in district 12
who survived the hunger games and the quarter quell
and rose up and turned
a nation of slaves into an army
dead or alive katniss everdeen
will remain the face of this revolution
she will not have died for nothing
i had no idea i meant so much to her
her vision and ours will be realized
a free panem with selfdetermination for all
and in her memory we will all find the strength
to rid panem of its oppressors
thank you and be safe
snows in his mansion where is that
thats us
thats the city circle
its at least 70 75 blocks north
seventyfive blocks
uhhuh
nobody knows were alive this is our chance
these buildings do these look over snows gardens
i
they do
if he goes outside at all i could get a clear shot
were getting ahead of ourselves here
whether theyre looking for us or not we are pinned down
hit that button scan for pods
just about every ten steps
yeah that doesnt even show the new ones
so we cant go anywhere in the streets
and the rooftops are just as bad
there might be another way
my brother knows these tunnels really well
he worked sanitation down here
right after they made him an avox
hey hey
you gonna be okay look at me look at me
were gonna get through this i promise
took us five years to buy his way outta here
he didnt see the sun once
were too exposed here
sir should i call for your doctor
what did you say
shall i call for your doctor
i hope youve wakened me for something more urgent
than an old mans health
they survived i dont know how
we picked them up on a surveillance cam
let me see i i need to see for myself
its her
it is her
the arena has moved underground
looks clear
everybody okay
yeah

you were stung once too

when they used the venom on me
they would show me pictures of my life
but some werent real
they changed them
at first they all they all blurred together
but now now i can sort them out a little
like the ones that they changed

i know you you were a stylist in the games
until snow decided i wasnt pretty enough anymore
im here to kill him
gales gonna need stitches
i made it up
all of it
there is no special mission from coin
theres only my plan
everyone thats dead is dead because of me i lied
we know we all knew
the soldiers from 13
they did too
do you really believe that jackson thought
you had orders from coin
she trusted boggs and he clearly wanted you to go on
i never meant for this to happen
i failed i
i killed them i killed finnick
im sorry pollux
im so sorry
glimmer marvel mags
clove wiress rue
what do all those deaths mean
they mean that our lives were never ours
there was no real life
because we didnt have any choice
our lives belong to snow and our deaths do too
but if you kill him katniss
if you end all of this
all those deaths they mean something
cinna boggs castor
jackson finnick
they chose this
they chose you
you should keep these clean
otherwise theyll get infected
you should cuff me
its not safe with me yet
i have moments when im here
and my memories are getting better but
other times its like im sleepwalking
you should cuff me
thanks
no problem
i cant sleep
yeah i havent slept in days either
i shouldve volunteered to take your place in the first games
no you couldnt have
no she never would have forgiven you
she needed you to be there
and take care of her family and you did
she cant lose you
she really loves you
and the way she kissed you in the quarter quell
she never kissed me like that
oh just part of the show
no no you won her over
you gave up everything for her
well its not gonna be an issue much longer
i doubt all three of us are gonna make it out of this
and if we do then
its her problem who to choose right
yeah
i do know that katniss will pick
whoever she cant survive without
mortar shells its not ours
peacekeepers must be shelling the rebels outside the city
thats not outside the city
suns comm up
theres some smallarms fire could be paylor maybe lyme

to all capitol citizens
more than a half mile outside the city circle
i am announcing a mandatory evacuation

i am promising you shelter and sanctuary
all refugees come to my home
there you will be provided with food
medicine safety for your children
and you will have my solemn oath
to protect you until my dying breath
wish hed hurry up with that last part
our enemy is not like us they do not share our values
they have never known our comfort
and our sophistication
and they despise us for it make no mistake
they are not coming to liberate us
they are coming to destroy our way of life
they are coming to bury us

prim
primrose
prim
hey i need you to lie back
youre okay everythings gonna be okay
fight was over after the capitol
dropped those bombs to defend the palace
the rebels walked right in
dont katniss the ointments working
everybody felt it
peacekeepers palace guards they had kids in there too
it was
it was over after that
mom
i remember the first time i brought you here
and here we are
i brought all your things
well ill leave you to get settled
sorry maam cant let you pass
let her in
on my authority
she has a right to anything behind that door
thats a nice one
the colors are lovely of course
but nothing says perfection like white
i was hoping youd find your way here
there are so many things we should discuss
but i have a feeling your visit will be brief
so first things first
i wanted to tell you
how very sorry i am about your sister
so wasteful so unnecessary
anyone could see the game was over by that point
in fact i was just about to issue an official surrender
when they released those parachutes
you released those parachutes
you really think i gave the order
we both know im not above killing children
but im not wasteful
i take life for specific reasons
and there was no reason for me to destroy
a pen full of capitol children
none at all
i must concede it was a masterful move on coins part
the idea that i was bombing
our own helpless children to hold back the rebels
it turned the last of my guards against me
there was no resistance left
inside the capitol or the mansion
do you know it aired live
theres a particular savvy in that isnt there
im sure she wasnt gunning for your sister but
these things happen in war
my failure was in being so slow to grasp coins plan
she let the capitol and the districts destroy one another
then she stepped in to take power with 13s arsenal
oh make no mistake
she intends to take my place now
but ive been watching you
and you watching me
im afraid weve both been played for fools
i dont believe you
oh my dear miss everdeen
i thought wed agreed never to lie to each other
president coin asked for you
you never came to see me
i wanted to but
was it ours
the bomb
the delayed explosion
the trap
to draw more people in
was that you
i dont know
all i know is
that i was supposed to take care of your family
now im sorry i couldnt
you cant protect anyone in an arena
goodbye gale
whats this
the remaining victors wont you join us
i have invited you all here for several reasons
but first i have an announcement
i have taken the burden and the honor
of declaring myself interim president of panem
interim exactly how long is that interim
we have no way of knowing for certain
but its clear that people are far too emotional right now
to make a rational decision
well plan an election when the time is right
but i have called you here for a far more important vote
a symbolic vote
this afternoon we will execute snow
hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths
capitol officials peacekeepers torturers gamemakers
but the danger is once we begin
the rebels will not stop calling for retribution
thirst for blood is a difficult urge to satisfy
so i offer an alternative plan
majority of four may approve it no one may abstain
the proposal is this
in lieu of these barbaric executions
we hold a symbolic hunger games
you wanna have another hunger games
with the capitols children
youre joking
not in the slightest
is this plutarchs idea
it was mine
it balances the need for revenge
with the least loss of human life
you may cast your votes
no
no obviously not this is crazy
i think its more than fair snows got a granddaughter
i say yes
so do i let them have a taste of it
you guys this way of thinking
is what started these uprisings
i vote no with peeta
so would finnick if he were here
well hes not
because snow killed him
no
we need to stop viewing each other as enemies
its down to katniss and haymitch
i get to kill snow
i expected no less of you
then i vote yes
for prim
haymitch
im with the mockingjay
that carries the vote
excellent
well announce the games tonight after the execution
well its bound to be quite the show
oh you look lovely as ever
just beautiful
finishing touches
welcome to the new panem
today on the avenue of the tributes
all of panem a free panem
will watch more than a mere spectacle
we are gathered to witness
an historic moment of justice
today the greatest friend to the revolution
will fire the shot to end all wars
may her arrow signify the end of tyranny
and the beginning of a new era
mockingjay
may your aim be as true
as your heart is pure
no
no
kill him
kill him kill him now
kill him
ill say this for you katniss
you dont disappoint
well plutarch gave me a letter for you
i dont want it
you never make it easy do you
okay ill read it for you
katniss maybe the country was shocked tonight by your arrow
but once again i was not
you were exactly who i believed you were
i wish i could give you a proper goodbye
but with both coin and snow dead
the fate of the country will be decided tonight
and i cant be seen at your side
tonight the 12 district leaders will call for a free election
theres little doubt that paylor will carry it
shes become the voice of reason
im sorry so much burden fell on you
i know youll never escape it
but if i had to put you through it again
for this outcome i would
the wars over well enter that sweet period
where everyone agrees not to repeat the recent horrors
of course were fickle stupid beings with poor memories
and a great gift for selfdestruction
although who knows maybe this time well learn
ive secured you a ride out of the capitol
its better for you to be out of sight
and when the time is right
commander paylor will pardon you
the country will find its peace
i hope you can find yours
plutarch
what now
home
we go home
i couldnt let you go without a proper goodbye
its your job to take care of yourself now katniss
promise me youll find it
find what
the life of a victor
goodbye effie
goodbye my girl
effie dont be a stranger
take care of her
i will
shes gone
get out
get out prim is gone
prim is gone
shes dead and shes not coming back
get out get out
peeta
hey
you came home
yeah
i found these uh out by the edge of the forest
its a primrose
so sorry katniss
youll be happy to hear that katniss mother
has been training new medical units in the capitol
gale has been promoted to a captain in district 2
to help keep order and security
and i am loving every moment with my son
who reminds me every day of his father
weve all suffered so much
but we owe it to their memories and to our children
to do our best with these lives
i hope youre both finding some peace
annie
i solemnly swear
to the best of my ability to preserve protect
and uphold the rights of every citizen of panem
theres plutarch right in the middle of it all
and they say no one ever wins the games
you love me
real or not real
real
did you have a nightmare
i have nightmares too
someday ill explain it to you
why they came
why they wont ever go away
but ill tell you how i survive it
i make a list in my head
of all the good things ive seen someone do
