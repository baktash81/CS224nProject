need control arsenal inside fortress
even every district alliance
outgunned

would enough disable fortress instead taking
mind
think like wolf den
youre gon na fight way youve got two choices
trap wolves inside flush em
cant attack straight
couldnt use hovercraft
strike around well use mountains
well hit weak spots peaks

trigger avalanches
block exits cut supplies

theres civilians
given chance surrender
could use one supply tunnels evacuees
luxury werent given firebombed
