hammond  thank you 
my pleasure  my pleasure

you british cia or something 
  something like that 
  and kenny he s   
mm hmm 
  thanks 
  nah 
no  thanks for coming
along when you did 
don t thank me 
i m the one who started this shit storm 
what do you mean 
guys like me pave the way
for guys like you to wind up here 
they don t usually fight back 
most of the time  they don t
even realize what we re doing 
  why  what do you mean 
  we   
   have interests in this region 
  we 
  our countries 
the corporations
who run them have interests here 
so i show up all nice and friendly 
offering to get them
a loan to pay for our services 
which we know they can t afford 
then we build them power plants 
waterworks  freeways   
it doesn t really matter 
and when they can t
repay us the debt   
we own  em 
it s all a fuck job 
the rebel leaders said we were
trying to enslave their people
by controlling the waterworks 
and they were right 
most of those merciless
men out there   
they re just trying to
protect their children 
just like you 
so don t thank me 
i m the one who put your
family in harm s way 
least i can do is get you
out of the bloody place 
is that kan chow chicken there 
  looks like dog 
  you need your strength  jack 
they need your strength too  mate 
raisins 
seemed like a nice touch

there s no good
or bad here  there s only   
   just get your family the hell out 
come on 
get some sleep 
we leave in four hours 
you all right 
in hindsight  i probably didn t need
to bring the rice cooker 
are you kidding me 
we couldn t leave that behind 
thank you for sticking with me
the last few years
because i know
it s not what you wanted 
what you hoped for 
if my life had been
the way i wanted   
i d be in paris 
i d be in a flat in saint sulpice 
drinking wine 
sounds pretty good 
but then i wouldn t have met you 
and i wouldn t know
those beautiful girls 
and the profound   
   thing it is to be their mother 
this life   
   has been so much more   
   than anything that i could have   
   wanted or planned 
if we die here tomorrow 
it will have been worth it

daddy  will you tell me

 push harder  push harder  
and she gave me a look  like   
you know that look
mommy gives  like   
 you re in big trouble  
and then i came out 
then you came out  yep 
and then they spanked me 
well  they spank all little babies
 cause they re trying to get them to cry 
  but she didn t 
  she wasn t crying 
so they spanked you again 
and they spanked her again 
then they tried again 
  but i wasn t breathing 
  that s right 
then more doctors came rushing in 
and they brought in more machines and   
the nurse said   you might want
to turn that video camera off  
and then your dad
looked at me and said 
 you need to talk to her 
you need to tell her to breathe
because she knows your voice  
 loud  
   say it to her  
  so i started yelling 
 breathe  lucy 
 breathe  little lucy  please  
and then i did 
  yeah 
  and then you did 
then i brought you over to mommy 
and she held you
for the first time  and i said 
 don t worry little lucy  you re okay
