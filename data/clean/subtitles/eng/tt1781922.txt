dont thank me
im the one who started this shit storm
what do you mean
guys like me pave the way
for guys like you to wind up here
they dont usually fight back
most of the time they dont
even realize what were doing
why what do you mean
we
have interests in this region
we
our countries
the corporations
who run them have interests here
so i show up all nice and friendly
offering to get them
a loan to pay for our services
which we know they cant afford
then we build them power plants
waterworks freeways
it doesnt really matter
and when they cant
repay us the debt
we own em
its all a fuck job
the rebel leaders said we were
trying to enslave their people
by controlling the waterworks
and they were right
most of those merciless
men out there
theyre just trying to
protect their children
just like you
so dont thank me
im the one who put your
family in harms way
least i can do is get you
out of the bloody place
is that kan chow chicken there
looks like dog

id be in paris
id be in a flat in saintsulpice
drinking wine

but then i wouldnt have met you
and i wouldnt know
those beautiful girls
and the profound
thing it is to be their mother
this life
