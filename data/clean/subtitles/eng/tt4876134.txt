so that means there were
19000 bank robbers
who didnt do
their job correctly
who wants the fbi on their ass
nah man i say if you gonna rob a
bank make sure it aint reported
funny thing about
safe deposit boxes
aint nothing safe about them
none of the shit
in the boxes is insured
try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government
youll get the middle finger
in fine print
so who would use
a safe deposit box
stupid people
and criminals
now i aint got no problem
with stupid people
as long as their stupidity
dont hurt nobody
the owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad
who hides his income so he
doesnt have to pay child support
how you gonna do that
to your own kid
let me be clear i never steal
from people who dont deserve it
and what i steal always goes
back to those whove been harmed
that handsome black man
yeah thats me ringo
yeah ringo like the beatle
and dont start with that
john paul george shit
cause i aint got time
to get into it
what you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise
im a black chameleon baby
and im emptyhanded
cause when those aholes
discover their boxes are empty
theyll get pissed
theyll yell
at the bank manager
the bank manager might even let
him see the security footage
but he will also explain what i already
told you that shit aint insured
one thing they will not do
is report it to the fbi
cause roaches hide
from the light
and in about six months ill empty
my safe deposit box and close my account
and i will write
a few wrongs anonymously
oh my god david
pack your things
turns out im not the only
one who feels good about doing good
that little dude
his name is wick
as a kid he heard
some chinese story
about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits
theres two things you need
to know about wick
first off
he dont give up
and eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up
dude made a mint in vegas when
they decided to remodel the whole city
second hes still the same
kid i first told you about
hes still goofy as hell still has the
same haircut still looks like hes 12
and he still believes firecrackers
can chase away evil spirits
this was a drug
manufacturing plant
wick made sure no drugs would
ever come out of here again
now i wasnt there
but i think it went a little
something like this
that there is violet
right now she in a church in
some shitty eastern euro country
she just recently freed a bunch of
young girls from a sex trafficking ring
and those are some
shitty eastern euro thugs
who are about to join a long list of men
who underestimated violets girl power
yo it was like some
matrixstyle shit
now i aint saying she
defied gravity or anything
cause i wasnt there
but i do know only one person
walked out of there that day
about a year ago
we didnt know each other
that all changed with a bouquet
of flowers three bouquets
seemed our good deeds landed on
the radar of some philanthropist
it was an offer
to step up our game
why take down a street hustler when you
can go after international corruption
we became a team we tried
to come up with a cool name
the robin hoods
nah i aint going for any
name calling us no damn hoods
wick even suggested the motley
crew with a straight face
hell nah but i like
the misfits
not everyone agreed
on the name but eff that
im telling the story
so the misfits it is
anyway the next chapter in our
story started a little while ago
in a prison in los angeles
the fbi is here to extradite
inmate 272523 to mr schultzs prison
where
england
mr schultz runs
a privatized prison there
this particular inmate
richard pace broke out
and you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape
wife issues
wife issues is latin
for this prisoner
was laying pipe
to schultzs wife
and for schultz
that caused some issues
wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation
mr schultz isnt a warden
no hes a senior partner
in a multinational company
which happens to own among other
things prisons all over the planet
coming up on the right here
440 open 312
copy 21 opening now
names richard pace
you should know
come back 440
well we just got
paperwork for his immediate release
the judge apparently
threw out the charges
thats not richard pace
he is good though
this is pace this morning from the
prison exercise yard look at this
there right there
look im just spitballing here
but i think that was a drone
all right if thats the drone
whats the payload
could have been keycards it couldve
been a birthday cake with a hacksaw in it
all we know is that weve searched
this installation from top to bottom
richard pace isnt here
i dont get it if he was going
to be released in 24 hours
why break out
probably because there was
something he needed to do today
not tomorrow
you are
hanni
hanni
hanni abu assad
right
so
wheres pace
how would i know
well you bunked with him
for three months
it seems that he did
that intentionally
because you had something
to tell him something
valuable to tell him
i dont know
right
well maybe
you will feel better
talking to me in private
power went down
damn it
now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon
whats going on
look at that
i know where pace is
excuse me
hell yeah
he know where pace was
he just beat the info out of poor
hanni with a damn cell phone
turns out
hanni used to be the valet
of prince hakeem al zahrani
pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit
like travel into los angeles
once a year
for a single day of shopping
my usual
next round on the house
he also never traveled without
his highvalue collection of timepieces
thats expensiveass watches
girardjoseph grand ellava
gold platinum 23 carats
d color flawless diamonds
one of only two ever made

okay time to go
hello
hello
what you got there
prince hakeem al zahrani
its an old picture
do you want to go
and talk about this
hmm no not really
yeah he wants to go
and talk about it
jesus
its an honest living
penthouse
hold up
you dont have any
jurisdiction or authority here
you let the fbi
handle this
you heard him
knock yourself out
here you go
go to the bedroom
copy that
im going to go wash up
you go through the first door
ill go through the second
my watches are gone
how are we doing
we had some company
almost there
how we doing
we are almost there yeah
clear
hey
hey
gentlemen i had a lovely stay
your car is waiting for you
surprise
ah thank you
nice to see you again
good to see you too uh
prince al zahrani
no i made that up
this is the prince not prince
al zahrani he made that shit up
he claims to be a prince from some
country nobodys ever heard of
but that dont matter
what matters is
remember the philanthropist who
sent the flowers this is that dude
shall we
lets roll like right now
all right bring the cars
around lets go lets go
shit
thank you these are mine
so this is a con
con seems pretty inadequate
to describe what we did
we even hired the dude to
play hanni as paces cellmate
yeah we probably gon have to
give that dude some workers comp
color me minorly
impressed but why
simple we need you you dont need us
for that we needed leverage
you know what they call a serious
crime captured on multiple hotel cameras
leverage now
you need us simple
who exactly is us
me and my friends
you dont have to come with us
up to you
what are we waiting for
what the hell did pace do to
schultzs wife that was so bad
lets just say mrs schultz
isnt the one upset by it
oh oh
heres to my kidnapping whoo
kidnapping requires a element
of force no force here
youre free to go
whenever you want
theres an exit sign
right behind you
yeah well maybe ill
just pass on that one
my man
the names ringo
thats violet thats my man
wick over there
you already had a chance to meet the
con artist formerly known as prince
is this some kind of criminal organization
nah not criminal at all
just a few people trying
to do whats right
well you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what i do
oh we know
you got quite the reputation
yeah the only thing that
you better at
than stealing
peoples shit is getting caught
and escaping
youre a damn legend
how many of schultzs
prisons did he escape
by my count four give or take
four prisons
built by the same guy
i love it man we all love it
but you know who dont love it
schultz
mmmm
he dont love it at all
and that dont have nothing to do with
the rumors about you and his wife
schultz didnt come to extradite
you back to his prison
those papers were forged
he was there to kill you
judging by your contributions to society thus
far i cant say it was the wrong choice
but were giving you
a chance to turn things around
oh great lucky me
look all you have to know is we got
the same piece of shit on our shoes
werner schultz
shit doesnt even
start to explain
he even owns prisons
in the middle east
schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand
so he partnered
with the muslim brotherhood
the local terrorist organization
in some country called jazeristan
well you know schultz does build
prisons and pretty good ones
but terrorism well
thats a bit of a stretch
yeah youd think
until schultz realized
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells
yeah a hardpartying arab
by the name of jason quick
they got him
for everything
drugs possession
weapon solicitation you name it
i am back bitches
schultz just up
and let him go
turns out that jason quick is actually
jasim bin something or something
one of the top dogs
of muslim brotherhoods son
and when schultz released him
it granted him favor with this man
abu hirawa
real name is amjam
what he had to say
for all intents and purposes
bin ladens successor
so schultz
is in bed with this guy
in bed under the covers with some ky
jelly doing all kinds of freaky shit
why are you telling me
cause youre a thief
let me stop you right there
yes im a thief
but i only steal from upstanding
citizens who pay insurance
nobody gets hurt
particularly me
besides i only work alone
and if that changes and it wont
none of you will make the cut
theres millions of dollars worth
of gold in one of those locations
i like gold
terrorism generates
a lot of cash kidnappings
drugs oil theft
but its all dirty
its traceable in order
to launder the money
gold
oh yeah gold
hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in
unless theyre forced to
a prison
oh not just any old prison
your boy schultzs prison
were goin in
you want to join us
you want me to go
into a middle eastern country
one that youve been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time
that is filled with terrorists
to steal their gold
yeah
thats exactly what we want you to do
in other words something good
for once
oh thats rich thats rich
let me see
how do i put this i got it
nope
and if it makes
you feel any better
im pretty sure every
one of you is insane
especially this dude
sitting over here
excuse me we on descent
please fasten your seatbelts thanks
you know i guess i should
have asked this sooner
descent to where

where are you from
im from the states um i travel
maam
i believe you
dropped your pocketbook
thank you you know what
that is so funny
i literally just picked that up in the gift shop
i bet you did
but you know you must be more careful the
world is rife with thieves and cutpurses
dont i know it which is why i
bought the cheapest one i could
and keep my real one
close to me heart
is there anything else you
keep close to your heart
let me see um
the trials of the poor
the downtrodden tribulations
of the worlds oppressed
otherwise no not a thing
sounds like a lonely existence
no actually
its quite fulfilling and lacks little
sometimes
things are missing in our lives
and we dont even know it
things tend to stay missing if
you dont actually look for them
if you dont mind
the lady and i were having a conversation
really now thats very funny
because i thought you prefer
to drink alone
in fact if i recall
you insisted
go find your own
this one is mine
huh what did you say
shes my new friend
really
thats very interesting because actually
shes my daughter
and i dont know you friend
the gentleman he had
to run away there
but he said for his drinks
our drinks on his room thank you so much
that was a very
swift move back there
yeah well i had
quite the teacher
its good to see you hope
it really is
you too dad
so howd you end up
in abu dhabi
same way i ended up in prison
against my will
and you
im im here to meet
some philanthropist
were talking through new
innovative ways to help the refugee crisis
thats good impressive
yeah it is
and when i was in the hotel lobby
i saw another crisis developing
well old habits
yeah
hey listen
lets go for a walk shall we its been a while
yeah okay
maybe on second thoughts
very nice
pay the bill here
here you go
keep the change
have you seen your mother
shes my mom so yeah
how is she
yeah shes fine
remarried
hmm
took her a long time but she got over it
thats good
yeah
thats really good
how about you howre you doing
you married yet
no im not married
i uh
i have trouble trusting men
daddy issues
look hope i know this
sounds like a cliche
but i did it for you and it was
the right thing to do at the time
why because youre
just so wrong
yeah
it was
you know what the sad thing i mean the
real tragedy of this whole thing is
you actually believe that
but i know deep down
under all that
urbane panache and capricious
thievery youre good
just gotta find that person
yeah well thats
easier said than done
perhaps i could steal him
i have to go im sorry
i have to go prepare for this meeting
okay
its good to see you
yeah its good to see you too dad
bye
bye
okay im in
but if i do this
and this comes off
its because of what
i bring to the table
im in charge
what i say goes no exceptions
we can live with that
its why we picked you
and the split tch not even
not five ways 5050 boom boom
split of what
the money the gold
there wont be any
what do you mean there wont be any
i thought that was the point
of the story steal the gold
it is but that doesnt mean
theyll be any gold to split
well why the hell not
because its not about us
its about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism
right i get that steal
their gold stop the terrorists
to the victor goes the spoils
there are no victors pace
were never going to be able
to stop the muslim brotherhood
but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off
we do what we do to help
others never ourselves
oh my god
here we go again
if this werent so amusing
it would be sad
ciao
pace
pace pace
look im not sure how you
got hold of your information
or who told you i might even have any
interest in this act of compassion
but they were wrong
i did
i told them
i told you had a meeting about the
refugee crisis this is that meaning
oh for gods sake
dont tell me they brought you in too
no i pulled them
this is my idea
hope listen to me
if any of this is true
contact the embassy
talk to a congressman
we tried
jazeristan is
an important us ally
us centcom uses al udeid
air base to launch assaults
in the middle east america doesnt
need to ask too many questions
and jazeristan doesnt
need to find any answers
do they know about this
they know but they
dont know you know
come on darling
what am i gonna do here
this i want you to do this
look dad
we need you
i need you
just this once im asking
you not to walk out the door
i must need my head examined
yeah i feel like i should mention
something about abu hirawa
i mean its kind of his gold
were after
in arabic
hirawa means cane
and that was this gardener
oh well
thats good to know
prison hard to get into
even harder to get out of
especially with
a truckload of gold
first question
wheres the gold
we got a couple of contacts on the
inside so we know the lay of the land
but we still dont know
where the vault is
do you have surveillance
photos on this facility
yeah we have come i show you
facility is stateoftheart
one of the most modern prisons on earth
and its completely selfcontained
food water everything
wait go back
keep going keep going
keep going left
if the prisons selfsustained
i would expect theres a fully
functioning laundry on the inside
yeah right next to the kitchen
using the same venting system
thats the steam in the photo
mm right but it doesnt
does it really
because while my arabic
is little bit rusty
im pretty sure
thats a laundry truck
meaning schultz built the prison
without installing
an actual industrial laundry
just a system to generate
steam for appearances
and built a vault instead
voila now we know
where the gold is
right under the shitter
lets go to prison shall we
oh and by the way
i only fly first class
me too
ohho congratulations
next time well be sure to book
your ticket on princess air
mmhm what do you
mean next time
this entire region
is on high alert
a group like this landing at the
airport will attract attention
yeah yeah yeah
point remains the same
trains planes automobiles
im flexible
as long as its first class
hmm
why isnt anyone
saying anything
please tell me youre joking
we got to fit in
vehicles will be scrutinized
camels muhammad
will be our guide
which one is muhammad
all of them
oh
my muhammad
theres about 30 miles of virgin
desert to the border of jazeristan
well
this prison isnt going
to rob itself lets go
by the way you look great
thank you dont be cheeky
which camels mine can i get this guy
he looks friendly
whats a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this
believe me im not so nice
they didnt ask me to join because
of my pleasant disposition
so its not because
you couldnt find a date
no im very good
at finding dates
even better at losing them
you might want to change
your line of work
could increase your odds
says the thief
no i decided a long time ago
that if i cant be good
to someone
i can at least try
and be good to everyone
good philosophy
you know
they say that people
on their deathbeds
never regret
the things they did
just the things
they didnt do
this sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret
were going to do something
very dangerous here soon
if theres some
kind of connection well
it would be a shame
if we die
without
really saying our feelings
did you ever think saying how you
feel might be the reason you die
nope never crossed my mind
its not you pace
from an empirical point of view
you are a very attractive man
you see i dont date men
i kill them
one can only try
hey
hey
you okay
yeah im fine
just a little scared
yeah
well it certainly
will have its risks
uh i dont mean the prison
dad youre doing this
for the right reasons right
i mean youre not going to do
like you always do and
disappear in the final frame
do you mean
the gold
no
i mean disappear without me
oh hope
i really would like to promise
you that i really would
theres a beautiful line
i once read in a poem
a man travels far to find out
who he really is
same goes for you
hold steady
hold steady
get some rest
its a big day tomorrow
well be fine here
why cant i stay with my dad
its too risky we dont want them to be
able to kill two birds with one stone
thats comforting
really
no it was a joke
hm
well we usually dont
like to work with people
who have families
and loved ones
brings emotions into play
and emotions cloud the mind
what are you doing
you never know when you have
to improvise on weapons
all right
what do you want to do
hmm what kind of drugs
do you have
i dont drink or take drugs
really maybe you should start
just a little something
to take the edge off
if you want
i could go score some
absolutely not
thats dangerous
i was joking
god you really dont have
a sense of humor do you
dont really have time for it
not much about what i do
is very funny
me neither
you know what lets focus on
what we love about our work
okay i like to beat people up
okay cool yeah
well lets say i am a guy
and im coming at you
a dumb guy
right okay
but i have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up so
you gotta take me down in one move
whats your goto
one shot
yeah thats it
easy punch to the throat
not the jewels
no
men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk
what may bring one to his knees
might bring another one pleasure
but a solid punch
the adams apple
down in a oner
cool
hmm
you must have one badass dad
never knew him
im sorry
yeah well me too
well i for one
would like to thank him
if he hadnt abandoned you
and made you hate men so much
you wouldnt taken up my fight
thats one way to look at it
youre lucky to have
a dad like yours
he loves you a lot
yeah i guess so
still an asshole though
yeah he is
here
i thought you didnt drink
i dont
lets cheers to dads
the good and the bad
all right ladies
and gentlemen pucker up
time to move ringo
dont lose interest
up you get gather round
ladies and gentlemen
okay take a seat
the problem with gold is
well its heavy
so were gonna need a vehicle
that can handle
that kind of weight
on it
and to get it out
of the country
camels arent gonna cut it
so were going to need
some kind of transport
i can
you can what
some kind of transport
my country can provide it
princeypoo claims
that hes royalty
in a country in the gulf
i thought you said
you werent a prince
i said i wasnt that prince
but im a prince in my country

see hes a true visionary
with his instrument
you guys dont understand
he was the first rock and roll drummer
influenced every
rock drummer after him
even the way that he held his sticks
seriously
i dont joke about ringo
its better just to accept it
and dont karaoke with him
you suck you suck
how you gonna say yellow
submarine aint a real beatles song
im just saying
hes an unappreciated singer
im so glad i asked
ringo were gonna need a list
of all the outside
prison contractors
no doubt
and you certainly cant
be drilling or tumbling
were going to have
to blow the vault
hope youve had experience
with phone boxes in
the peace corps is that right
yeah
i need that skill set
and anything else i taught you
at a very inappropriate age
violet we need to find
out where schultz is
when he isnt at the prison
we need surveillance
already on it and it looks like
you guys better grab your robes
schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes
all right handsome lets go
thats what im talking about
welcome sir
there it is
watch that case
you see how heavy that was
like a fat lady
looks like schultz
is making a withdrawal
for our friend abu hirawa
we have to stop him
im sorry hope
you cant win them all
we dont know who this guy is and by
now hes just in the wind
jason quick
jason quick he looks good
he got the drugs out of his system
and he put the jihad back in
that other guy in the photo
its the vice president
of the bank of jazeristan
hes trading
the gold for cash
yeah and the bank
opens tomorrow at 1000 am

he wasnt
im sorry im not following
on the journey from is to
was all men tell the truth
a mans eyes cannot lie
not to me
especially when
i hold them in my hand
if i thought it was you
we would not be having
this conversation
ah right well
thats that then
if theres nothing else
ive got a bit of company at the moment
there is a very large
operation taking place in the near future
but you may leave
your briefcase at home
you need something much
larger for this transaction
ah right
whos my contact this time
me
you lovely
three days
all right thanks
oh shit
agreed
hirawas coming
here to get his gold
thats the bad news the piss
in our punch bowl bad news
is this guy
khairat reda is
a londonbased banker
top brass of the brotherhood and
he arrives here in three days
hirawa is the finger puppet
and this man is the hand
so we accelerate the schedule
hit the prison before they get there
uhuh we cant go into this thing
halfcocked were not ready
im ready are you ready
huh we are fully cock
cocked not cock
yes cock
yes cock for you
no cock for me
i need a drink
okay here we go
the only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly
is if the prison
isnt running smoothly
fortunately we got a few guys
on the inside
and working in the place
where we have direct control
over the prisoners
physical wellbeing
any health issue that
needs more than ten beds
well
we gotta get them out now
lets just say theyre going
to need more than that
and we walk out the front door
well maybe not
lets play that one by ear
shall we
abdullah are you aware of how many
violations you have going on here
no we just passed
inspection a few months ago
now im asking where are you buying
all of your refrigeration equipment from
pacific industries yes
theyre still in business
well you need to get them
on the phone right away
we can get some new steamers
down here get you up to code
youre with the ministry
of public health mr uh
lionel l zagred
i am
i have a friend there maybe i should
call him so i can sort this out
are you aware of the gso
the gulf standard organization
theyre responsible for all
of the food development
and standards going on
here in the gulf region
so you could only imagine how itd
probably look if such a prized institution
were to fail an inspection
now if you ask me personally
jazeristan shouldnt care
about the opinions
of other countries right
so if you want you want
to call your friend
you get him on the horn call them right away
theyre not friends
it wont be me that will be
upsetting the royal family
its my friends cousin
and i dont even know him
pacific industrial
would you happen to
have any of the
vanguard k2350
vanguard k2350 in stock please

to the dola penal
corrections institute

have someone clean this up now
well
were not sure sir
but a large number of prisoners
