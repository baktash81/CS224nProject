so  that means there were
19 000 bank robbers
who didn t do
their job correctly 
who wants the fbi on their ass 
nah  man  i say  if you gonna rob a
bank  make sure it ain t reported 
funny thing about
safe deposit boxes   
ain t nothing safe about them 
none of the shit
in the boxes is insured 
try reporting a loss to
the bank or the government 
you ll get the middle finger
in fine print 
so who would use
a safe deposit box 
stupid people 
and criminals 
now  i ain t got no problem
with stupid people 
as long as their stupidity
don t hurt nobody 
the owner of box 2504
is a deadbeat dad
who hides his income so he
doesn t have to pay child support 
how you gonna do that
to your own kid 
let me be clear  i never steal
from people who don t deserve it 
and what i steal  always goes
back to those who ve been harmed 
that handsome black man 
yeah  that s me  ringo 
yeah  ringo  like the beatle 
and don t start with that
john  paul  george shit 
 cause i ain t got time
to get into it 
what you need to pay attention
to is my masterful disguise 
i m a black chameleon  baby 
and i m empty handed 
 cause when those a holes
discover their boxes are empty 
they ll get pissed 
they ll yell
at the bank manager 
the bank manager might even let
him see the security footage 
but he will also explain what i already
told you    that shit ain t insured 
one thing they will not do
is report it to the fbi 
 cause roaches hide
from the light 
and in about six months  i ll empty
my safe deposit box and close my account 
and i will write
a few wrongs  anonymously 
oh my god  david 
pack your things 
turns out i m not the only
one who feels good about doing good 
that little dude 
his name is wick 
as a kid he heard
some chinese story
about firecrackers scaring
away evil spirits 
there s two things you need
to know about wick 
first off   
he don t give up 
and eventually he got really
good at blowing shit up 
dude made a mint in vegas when
they decided to remodel the whole city 
second  he s still the same
kid i first told you about 
he s still goofy as hell  still has the
same haircut  still looks like he s 12   
and he still believes firecrackers
can chase away evil spirits 
this was a drug
manufacturing plant 
wick made sure no drugs would
ever come out of here again 
now i wasn t there 
but i think it went a little
something like this 
that there is violet 
right now she in a church in
some shitty eastern euro country 
she just recently freed a bunch of
young girls from a sex trafficking ring 
and those are some
shitty eastern euro thugs
who are about to join a long list of men
who underestimated violet s girl power 
yo  it was like some
matrix style shit 
now i ain t saying she
defied gravity or anything 
 cause i wasn t there 
but i do know only one person
walked out of there that day 
about a year ago 
we didn t know each other 
that all changed with a bouquet
of flowers  three bouquets 
seemed our good deeds landed on
the radar of some philanthropist 
it was an offer
to step up our game 
why take down a street hustler when you
can go after international corruption 
we became a team  we tried
to come up with a cool name 
the robin hoods 
nah  i ain t going for any
name calling us no damn hoods 
wick even suggested the motley
crew  with a straight face 
hell nah  but i like
the misfits 
not everyone agreed
on the name  but eff that 
i m telling the story 
so the misfits it is 
anyway  the next chapter in our
story started a little while ago
in a prison in los angeles 
the fbi is here to extradite
inmate 272523 to mr  schultz s prison 
  where 
  england 
mr  schultz runs
a privatized prison there 
this particular inmate 
richard pace  broke out 
and you came all this way
just for a prisoner escape 
wife issues 
wife issues is latin
for this prisoner
was laying pipe
to schultz s wife 
and for schultz   
that caused some issues 
wish prisons here would
send wardens on vacation 
mr  schultz isn t a warden 
no  he s a senior partner
in a multinational company
which happens to own  among other
things  prisons all over the planet 
coming up on the right here 
440  open 312 
copy 21  opening now 
name s richard pace   
you should know 
come back 440 
well  we just got
paperwork for his immediate release 
the judge apparently
threw out the charges 
that s not richard pace 
he is good  though 
this is pace this morning from the
prison exercise yard  look at this 
there  right there 
look  i m just spitballing here 
but i think that was a drone 
all right  if that s the drone 
what s the payload 
could have been key cards  it could ve
been a birthday cake with a hacksaw in it 
all we know is that we ve searched
this installation from top to bottom 
richard pace isn t here 
i don t get it  if he was going
to be released in 24 hours 
why break out 
probably because there was
something he needed to do today   
not tomorrow 
you are   
  hanni 
  hanni 
hanni abu assad 
right 
so   
where s pace 
how would i know 
well  you bunked with him
for three months 
it seems that he did
that intentionally
because you had something
to tell him  something   
valuable to tell him 
i don t know 
right 
well  maybe   
you will feel better   
talking to me in    private 
  power went down 
  damn it 
now we got a foreign national
alone in a room with a felon 
what s going on 
look at that 
i know where pace is 
excuse me 
hell yeah 
he know where pace was 
he just beat the info out of poor
hanni with a damn cell phone 
turns out 
hanni used to be the valet
of prince hakeem al zahrani 
pace learned the prince
like to do stupid shit
like travel into los angeles
once a year
for a single day of shopping 
  my usual 
  next round on the house 
he also never traveled without
his high value collection of timepieces 
that s expensive ass watches 
girard joseph grand ellava 
gold  platinum  23 carats 
d color  flawless diamonds 
one of only two ever made 
whoo 
richard pace 
  pleased to meet you 
  nice to meet you  too 
you re kuwaiti  huh 
i have a daughter who works
in the middle east  unicef 
charitable work  children  refugees and   
something like that 
so  uh   
   how much does a watch
like that go for 
four  five mill   
oh  i m so sorry 
  i do apolo    i m so sorry 
  really 
please  please  please 
just let me  there you go 
  it s fine 
  you got some right there 
oops  i do apologize 
  if you don t mind 
  yes  okay 
my fault  i ve had
too much to drink
it s just one of those days 
okay  time to go 
hello 
hello 
what you got there 
prince hakeem al zahrani 
it s an old picture 
do you want to go
and talk about this 
hmm  no  not really 
yeah  he wants to go
and talk about it 
jesus 
it s an honest living 
  penthouse 
  hold up 
you don t have any
jurisdiction or authority here 
you let the fbi
handle this 
you heard him 
knock yourself out 
here you go 
  go to the bedroom 
  copy that 
i m going to go wash up 
you go through the first door 
i ll go through the second 
my watches are gone 
how are we doing 
we had some company 
almost there 
how we doing 
we are almost there  yeah 
clear 
  hey 
  hey 
  gentlemen  i had a lovely stay 
  your car is waiting for you 
surprise 
ah  thank you 
  nice to see you again 
  good to see you too  uh 
  prince al zahrani 
  no  i made that up 
this is the prince  not prince
al zahrani  he made that shit up 
he claims to be a prince from some
country nobody s ever heard of 
but that don t matter 
what matters is   
remember the philanthropist who
sent the flowers  this is that dude 
  shall we 
  let s roll  like right now 
all right  bring the cars
around  let s go  let s go 
shit 
thank you  these are mine 
so this is a con 
con seems pretty inadequate
to describe what we did 
we even hired the dude to
play hanni as pace s cellmate 
yeah  we probably gon  have to
give that dude some worker s comp 
color me minorly
impressed  but why 
simple  we need you  you don t need us 
for that  we needed leverage 
you know what they call a serious
crime captured on multiple hotel cameras 
leverage  now 
you need us  simple 
  who exactly is us 
  me and my friends 
you don t have to come with us 
up to you 
what are we waiting for 
what the hell did pace do to
schultz s wife that was so bad 
let s just say mrs  schultz
isn t the one upset by it 
oh  oh   
here s to my kidnapping  whoo 
kidnapping requires a element
of force  no force here 
you re free to go
whenever you want 
there s an exit sign
right behind you 
yeah  well  maybe i ll
just pass on that one 
my man 
the name s ringo 
that s violet  that s my man
wick over there 
you already had a chance to meet the
con artist formerly known as prince 
  is this some kind of criminal organization 
  nah  not criminal at all 
just a few people trying
to do what s right 
well  you got the wrong guy here
because right is not what i do 
oh  we know 
you got quite the reputation 
yeah  the only thing that
you better at
than stealing
people s shit is getting caught 
and escaping 
you re a damn legend 
how many of schultz s
prisons did he escape 
by my count  four  give or take 
four prisons 
built by the same guy 
i love it  man  we all love it 
but you know who don t love it 
  schultz 
  mm mm 
he don t love it at all 
and that don t have nothing to do with
the rumors about you and his wife 
schultz didn t come to extradite
you back to his prison 
those papers were forged 
he was there to kill you 
judging by your contributions to society thus
far  i can t say it was the wrong choice 
but we re giving you
a chance to turn things around 
oh great  lucky me 
look  all you have to know is we got
the same piece of shit on our shoes 
werner schultz 
shit doesn t even
start to explain 
he even owns prisons
in the middle east 
schultz saw dollar signs
and wanted to expand 
so he partnered
with the muslim brotherhood 
the local terrorist organization
in some country called jazeristan 
well  you know schultz does build
prisons and pretty good ones 
but terrorism  well 
that s a bit of a stretch 
yeah  you d think
until schultz realized
that he had a bargaining chip
in one of his cells 
yeah  a hard partying arab
by the name of jason quick 
they got him
for everything 
drugs  possession 
weapon solicitation you name it 
i am back  bitches 
schultz just up
and let him go 
turns out that jason quick is actually
jasim bin something or something 
one of the top dogs
of muslim brotherhood s son 
and when schultz released him 
it granted him favor with this man 
abu hirawa 
real name is am jam   
what he had to say 
for all intents and purposes 
bin laden s successor 
so       schultz
is in bed with this guy 
in bed  under the covers with some ky
jelly doing all kinds of freaky shit 
  why are you telling me 
   cause you re a thief 
let me stop you right there 
yes  i m a thief   
but i only steal from upstanding
citizens who pay insurance 
nobody gets hurt 
particularly me 
besides    i only work alone 
and if that changes  and it won t   
none of you will make the cut 
there s millions of dollars worth
of gold in one of those locations 
i like gold 
terrorism generates
a lot of cash  kidnappings 
drugs  oil  theft 
but it s all dirty 
it s traceable  in order
to launder the money   
  gold 
  oh yeah  gold 
hidden in a place that no one
wants to dare step foot in 
unless they re forced to 
a prison 
oh  not just any old prison 
your boy schultz s prison 
we re goin  in 
you want to join us 
you want me to go
into a middle eastern country 
one that you ve been explaining
for an ungodly amount of time 
that is filled with terrorists 
to steal their gold 
  yeah 
  that s exactly what we want you to do 
in other words  something good 
for once 
oh  that s rich  that s rich 
let me see   
   how do i put this  i got it 
nope 
and if it makes
you feel any better 
i m pretty sure every
one of you is insane 
especially this dude
sitting over here 
excuse me  we on descent 
please fasten your seatbelts  thanks 
you know  i guess i should
have asked this sooner 
descent to where 
to abu dhabi 
abu dhabi 
hey man  schultz s new besties 
the dudes in the grey suits 
muslim brotherhood 
they ll try to kill
you again  you know 
you change your mind 
there s a card in your left breast pocket 
  call us 
  arrivederci 
my  my  would you look at this 
taxi 
whoa 
let s roll 
why don t you take me to the best
five star hotel in    abu dhabi 
  i know just the place 
  good man 
  first time here 
  yeah  it is  yeah  it is 
  you know what 
  what 
  i think i m gonna like it here 
  yeah  you will 
hey there  give us your best
single malt whiskey  two ice cubes 
it s a good looking watch 
leon lafleur magnifique  769
working parts 
each one created by a single craftsman
at an atelier in switzerland 
i believe  only four of them
ever made in the world 
huh  impressive 
wonder how this
wallet got down here 
sorry 
huh  your wallet 
no  it s not 
and i rather drink alone 
i actually insist on it 
okay  fair play 
all right  auf wiedersehen 
good luck to yourself 
sorry 
hi  gin and tonic  please 
i don t believe it 
oh  excuse me 
i think you dropped this 
oh  thank you so much 
what a pleasure meeting you 
  yes  you too 
  where are you from 
  i m from the states  um  i travel   
  ma am 
i believe you
dropped your pocketbook 
thank you  you know what 
that is so funny 
  i literally just picked that up in the gift shop 
  i bet you did 
but you know  you must be more careful the
world is rife with thieves and cutpurses 
don t i know it  which is why i
bought the cheapest one i could   
and keep my real one   
close to me heart 
is there anything else you
keep close to your heart 
let me see  um   
the trials of the poor 
the downtrodden  tribulations
of the world s oppressed 
otherwise  no  not a thing 
sounds like a lonely existence 
no  actually 
it s quite fulfilling and lacks little 
sometimes   
things are missing in our lives
and we don t even know it 
things tend to stay missing if
you don t actually look for them 
if you don t mind 
the lady and i were having a conversation 
really now  that s very funny
because i thought you prefer
to drink alone 
in fact  if i recall 
you insisted 
go  find your own 
this one is mine 
  huh  what did you say 
  she s my new friend 
really 
that s very interesting because actually   
she s my daughter 
and i don t know you  friend 
the gentleman  he had
to run away there 
but he said for his drinks 
our drinks on his room  thank you so much 
that was a very
swift move back there 
yeah  well  i had
quite the teacher 
it s good to see you  hope 
it really is 
you too  dad 
so  how d you end up
in abu dhabi 
same way i ended up in prison 
against my will 
and you 
i m    i m here to meet
some philanthropist 
we re talking through new 
innovative ways to help the refugee crisis 
  that s good  impressive 
  yeah  it is 
and when i was in the hotel lobby 
i saw another crisis developing 
  well  old habits 
  yeah 
hey  listen 
  let s go for a walk  shall we  it s been a while 
  yeah  okay 
maybe on second thoughts   
  very nice 
  pay the bill here   
here you go 
keep the change 
have you seen your mother 
she s my mom  so  yeah 
  how is she 
  yeah  she s fine 
  re married 
  hmm 
  took her a long time  but she got over it 
  that s good 
yeah 
that s really good 
how about you  how re you doing 
you    married yet 
no  i m not married 
i  uh   
i have trouble trusting men 
daddy issues 
look  hope  i know this
sounds like a cliche 
but i did it for you and it was
the right thing to do at the time 
why  because you re
just so wrong 
yeah 
it was 
you know what the sad thing  i mean the
real tragedy of this whole thing is 
you actually believe that 
but i know deep down 
under all that
urbane panache and capricious
thievery  you re good 
just gotta find that person 
yeah  well that s
easier said than done 
perhaps  i could steal him 
i have to go  i m sorry 
i have to go prepare for this meeting 
okay 
  it s good to see you 
  yeah  it s good to see you too  dad 
  bye 
  bye 
okay  i m in 
but if i do this 
and this comes off 
it s because of what
i bring to the table 
i m in charge 
what i say goes  no exceptions 
  we can live with that 
  it s why we picked you 
and the split  tch  not even 
not five ways  50 50 boom  boom 
  split of what 
  the money  the gold 
  there won t be any 
  what do you mean there won t be any 
i thought that was the point
of the story  steal the gold 
it is  but that doesn t mean
they ll be any gold to split 
  well  why the hell not 
  because it s not about us 
it s about preventing that gold
from financing terrorism 
right  i get that  steal
their gold  stop the terrorists 
to the victor goes the spoils 
there are no victors  pace 
we re never going to be able
to stop the muslim brotherhood 
but we can try and stop
one bomb from going off 
we do what we do to help
others  never ourselves 
oh my god 
here we go again 
if this weren t so amusing   
it would be sad 
ciao 
pace 
pace  pace 
look  i m not sure how you
got hold of your information
or who told you i might even have any
interest in this act of compassion 
  but they were wrong 
  i did 
i told them 
i told you had a meeting about the
refugee crisis  this is that meaning 
oh  for god s sake 
  don t tell me they brought you in  too 
  no  i pulled them 
this is my idea 
hope  listen to me 
if any of this is true 
contact the embassy 
talk to a congressman 
we tried 
jazeristan is
an important us ally 
u s  centcom uses al udeid
air base to launch assaults
in the middle east  america doesn t
need to ask too many questions 
and jazeristan doesn t
need to find any answers 
do they know about this 
they know  but they
don t know  you know 
come on  darling 
what am i gonna do here 
this  i want you to do this 
look  dad 
we need you 
i need you 
just this once  i m asking
you not to walk out the door 
i must need my head examined 
yeah  i feel like i should mention
something about abu hirawa 
i mean it s kind of his gold
we re after 
in arabic 
hirawa means cane 
and that was this gardener 
oh well 
that s good to know 
prison  hard to get into 
even harder to get out of 
especially with
a truckload of gold 
first question 
where s the gold 
we got a couple of contacts on the
inside so we know the lay of the land 
but we still don t know
where the vault is 
do you have surveillance
photos on this facility 
yeah  we have  come  i show you 
facility is state of the art 
one of the most modern prisons on earth 
and it s completely self contained   
food  water  everything 
wait  go back 
keep going  keep going 
keep going  left 
if the prison s self sustained 
i would expect there s a fully
functioning laundry on the inside 
yeah  right next to the kitchen 
using the same venting system 
that s the steam in the photo 
mm  right  but it doesn t 
does it  really 
because while my arabic
is little bit rusty 
i m pretty sure   
that s a laundry truck 
meaning schultz built the prison
without installing
an actual industrial laundry 
just a system to generate
steam for appearances 
and built a vault instead 
voila  now we know
where the gold is 
  right under the shitter 
  let s go to prison  shall we 
oh  and by the way 
i only fly first class 
  me too 
  oh ho  congratulations 
next time we ll be sure to book
your ticket on princess air 
mm hm  what do you
mean  next time 
this entire region
is on high alert 
a group like this  landing at the
airport will attract attention 
yeah  yeah  yeah 
point remains the same 
trains  planes  automobiles 
i m flexible   
as long as it s first class 
hmm 
why isn t anyone
saying anything 
please  tell me you re joking 
we got to fit in 
vehicles will be scrutinized 
camels  muhammad
will be our guide 
  which one is muhammad 
  all of them 
  oh 
  my muhammad 
there s about 30 miles of virgin
desert to the border of jazeristan 
well  
this prison isn t going
to rob itself  let s go 
  by the way  you look great 
  thank you  don t be cheeky 
which camel s mine  can i get this guy 
he looks friendly 
what s a nice girl like you
doing in a desert like this 
believe me  i m not so nice 
they didn t ask me to join because
of my pleasant disposition 
so it s not because
you couldn t find a date 
no  i m very good
at finding dates 
even better at losing them 
you might want to change
your line of work 
  could increase your odds 
  says the thief 
no  i decided a long time ago
that if i can t be good
to someone 
i can at least try
and be good to everyone 
good philosophy 
you know   
they say that people
on their deathbeds   
never regret
the things they did 
just    the things
they didn t do 
this sounds like the start of
a conversation you may regret 
we re going to do something
very dangerous here soon 
if there s some
kind of connection  well   
it would be a shame
if we die
without
really saying our feelings 
did you ever think saying how you
feel might be the reason you die 
nope  never crossed my mind 
it s not you  pace 
from an empirical point of view 
you are a very attractive man 
you see i don t    date men 
i kill them 
one can only try 
  hey 
  hey 
you okay 
yeah  i m fine 
  just a little scared 
  yeah 
well  it certainly
will have its risks 
uh  i don t mean the prison 
dad  you re doing this
for the right reasons  right 
i mean    you re not going to do
like you always do and   
disappear in the final frame 
do you mean   
  the gold 
  no 
i mean    disappear without me 
oh  hope   
i really would like to promise
you that  i really would 
there s a beautiful line
i once read in a poem 
 a man travels far to find out
who he really is  
same goes for you 
hold steady 
hold steady 
get some rest 
it s a big day tomorrow 
  we ll be fine here 
  why can t i stay with my dad 
it s too risky  we don t want them to be
able to kill two birds with one stone 
  that s comforting 
  really 
no  it was a joke 
hm 
well  we usually don t
like to work with people
who have families
and loved ones 
brings emotions into play 
and emotions cloud the mind 
what are you doing 
you never know when you have
to improvise on weapons 
all right 
what do you want to do 
hmm  what kind of drugs
do you have 
i don t drink or take drugs 
really  maybe you should start 
just a little something
to take the edge off 
if you want 
i could go score some 
absolutely not 
that s dangerous 
i was joking 
god  you really don t have
a sense of humor  do you 
don t really have time for it 
not much about what i do
is very funny 
me neither 
you know what  let s focus on
what we love about our work 
okay  i like to beat people up 
okay  cool  yeah 
well  let s say i am a guy
and i m coming at you 
  a dumb guy 
  right  okay 
but i have a bunch of friends
waiting to back me up  so 
you gotta take me down in one move 
what s your go to 
  one shot 
  yeah  that s it 
easy  punch to the throat 
  not the jewels 
  no 
men vary in size and sensitivity
when it comes to their junk 
what may bring one to his knees
might bring another one pleasure 
but a solid punch
the adam s apple 
down in a oner 
  cool 
  hmm 
you must have one badass dad 
never knew him 
i m sorry 
yeah  well  me too 
well  i for one 
would like to thank him 
if he hadn t abandoned you
and made you hate men so much 
you wouldn t taken up my fight 
that s one way to look at it 
you re lucky to have
a dad like yours 
he loves you a lot 
yeah  i guess so 
still an asshole though 
yeah  he is 
here 
  i thought you didn t drink 
  i don t 
let s cheers to dads 
the good    and the bad 
all right  ladies
and gentlemen pucker up 
time to move  ringo 
don t lose interest 
up you get  gather round 
ladies and gentlemen 
okay  take a seat 
the problem with gold is 
well  it s heavy 
so we re gonna need a vehicle
that can handle
that kind of weight 
on it 
and to get it out
of the country 
camels aren t gonna cut it 
so  we re going to need
some kind of transport 
  i can 
  you can what

thank you very much  ringo 
by the way 
just off the topic here 
is that your given name 
yeah  given by me  in honor
of the greatest beatle 
  here we go again 
  what you mean here we go again 
what  a black man
can t like the beatles 
see  he s a true visionary
with his instrument 
you guys don t understand 
he was the first rock and roll drummer   
influenced every
rock drummer after him 
  even the way that he held his sticks 
  seriously 
i don t joke about ringo 
it s better just to accept it
and don t karaoke with him 
you suck  you suck 
how you gonna say  yellow
submarine  ain t a real beatles song 
i m just saying
he s an unappreciated singer 
i m so glad i asked 
ringo  we re gonna need a list
of all the outside
prison contractors 
no doubt 
and you certainly can t
be drilling or tumbling 
we re going to have
to blow the vault 
hope  you ve had experience
with phone boxes in
the peace corps  is that right 
  yeah 
  i need that skill set 
and anything else i taught you
at a very inappropriate age 
violet  we need to find
out where schultz is
when he isn t at the prison 
we need surveillance 
already on it  and it looks like
you guys better grab your robes 
schultz has a lunch
reservation in 45 minutes 
all right handsome  let s go 
that s what i m talking about 
welcome  sir 
there it is 
watch that case 
  you see how heavy that was 
  like a fat lady 
looks like schultz
is making a withdrawal
for our friend abu hirawa 
we have to stop him 
i m sorry  hope 
you can t win them all 
we don t know who this guy is and by
now  he s just in the wind 
jason quick 
jason quick  he looks good 
he got the drugs out of his system
and he put the jihad back in 
that other guy in the photo 
it s the vice president
of the bank of jazeristan 
he s trading
the gold for cash 
yeah  and the bank
opens tomorrow at 10 00 a m 
after that  jason boards
an afternoon flight   
at which point
he will be  in the wind  
what you got there 
what are you reading 
  i picked these up at the souk 
  okay 
  what 
  nothing 
i gave your man gold 
it s not my fault he s a thief 
  was 
  i m sorry 
was a thief  except that   
  he wasn t 
  i m sorry  i m not following 
on the journey from is to
was  all men tell the truth 
a man s eyes cannot lie 
not to me 
especially when
i hold them in my hand 
if i thought it was you 
we would not be having
this conversation 
ah  right  well   
that s that then 
if there s nothing else 
i ve got a bit of company at the moment 
there is a very large
operation taking place in the near future 
but you may leave
your briefcase at home 
you need something much
larger for this transaction 
ah  right 
who s my contact this time 
  me 
  you  lovely 
  three days 
  all right  thanks 
oh shit 
agreed 
hirawa s coming
here to get his gold 
that s the bad news  the piss
in our punch bowl bad news   
is this guy 
khairat reda is
a london based banker 
top brass of the brotherhood and
he arrives here in three days 
hirawa is the finger puppet 
and this man is the hand 
so we accelerate the schedule 
hit the prison before they get there 
uh uh  we can t go into this thing
half cocked  we re not ready 
i m ready  are you ready 
huh  we are fully cock 
  cocked  not cock 
  yes  cock 
yes  cock for you 
no cock for me 
i need a drink 
okay  here we go 
the only way this operation
is gonna run smoothly
is if the prison
isn t running smoothly 
fortunately  we got a few guys
on the inside 
and working in the place
where we have direct control
over the prisoners 
physical well being 
any health issue that
needs more than ten beds   
well   
we gotta get them out  now 
let s just say they re going
to need more than that 
  and we walk out the front door 
  well  maybe not 
let s play that one by ear 
shall we 
abdullah  are you aware of how many
violations you have going on here 
no  we just passed
inspection a few months ago 
now  i m asking  where are you buying
all of your refrigeration equipment from 
  pacific industries  yes 
  they re still in business 
well  you need to get them
on the phone right away 
we can get some new steamers
down here  get you up to code 
you re with the ministry
of public health  mr   uh   
  lionel l  zagred 
  i am 
i have a friend there  maybe i should
call him so i can sort this out 
are you aware of the gso 
the gulf standard organization 
they re responsible for all
of the food development
and standards going on
here in the gulf region 
so you could only imagine how it d
probably look if such a prized institution
were to fail an inspection 
now  if you ask me personally 
jazeristan shouldn t care
about the opinions
of other countries  right 
so if you want    you want
to call your friend 
  you get him on the horn  call them  right away 
  they re not friends 
it won t be me that will be
upsetting the royal family 
it s my friend s cousin 
and i don t even know him 
pacific industrial 
would you happen to
have any of the   
vanguard k2350 
vanguard k2350 in stock  please

as quickly as possible 
to the dola penal
corrections institute

don t have any at hand 
you just literally two seconds
ago told me you had five

but they can rush order them to
us and have them to us in a week 
mm hmm 
answer that phone  abdullah

  what if it s the royal family 
answer the phone 
hello  sir  this is pacific
industrial here

mix up we had over here on our end 
we do in fact have
the 2350 in stock 
we had an unexpected
delivery cancellation

is in the field as we speak 
would tomorrow afternoon

i can t thank you enough for this 
that s very kind of you  sir 
much appreciated  good day now 
cup of coffee

let s go check
on their progress 
okay  abdullah  you re
so angry  let s go 
age before beauty 
all these new steamers 
this has worked out famously 
abdullah  k2350 
they look the same 
but how closely
have you examined 
  not so much 
  exactly 
see  same chassis 
internal component entirely different 
no 
what are you doing 
you have to break in first 
right 
i mean    they are your steamers 
if you want to turn on 
you break  you buy 
you own the steamers 
no  no  i don t 
the royal family does 
  when can we use them 
  eh    an hour or two 
give the internal
component time to break in 
i love that you
listen to me now 
this is like we
build a relationship 
i feel like i must hug  i hug 
i m    i m sorry 
part of my culture 
i m    i m european 
  you re european 
  yes 
  finnish  from    from finland 
  oh

oh yes  now i have one more
thing for you to do 
for you to sign and then
i m out of your hair  i finish 
okay 
wow 
seemed like a good idea
a few days ago 
this is going to take
a bloody miracle 
indeed 
let s go  we ve got
a busy morning ahead 
bon appetit 
born up a tree 
it s amazing the bacteria you can
find at a local university  huh 
they really should protect it
better  you know that 
i hope there s
no harmful side effects 
sure  there shouldn t be those 
get these people
to the infirmary immediately 
and for god sakes 
have someone clean this up  now 
  well 
  we re not sure  sir 
but a large number of prisoners
and staff start showing
some sign of poisoning 
acute abdominal pain  nausea  vomiting 
it could be
some sort of overdose 
so   
all this is just a little
bit of bad weed 
should we  maybe 
call in the national police 
are you high 
yes  sir    i mean no  sir 
that would be bad idea 
check every flight  hotel 
and taxi company  find pace 
sick or ill prisoners
please report to the infirmary
immediately 
i repeat all sick
or ill prisoners 
please report to
the infirmary immediately 
okay 
  steady  hold it

yep 
hammed al zagreb  office
of poison and noxious gases 
mm 
who said anything
about noxious gases 
nobody  yet 
see i have to test every patient
and the source of contamination 
could be something

much more serious 
as i said  will not be
able to determine that
until i properly
assess the situation 
we re going to need
a hazmat cleanup immediately
