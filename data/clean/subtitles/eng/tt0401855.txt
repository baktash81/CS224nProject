this monsters aftermath
i will not tolerate this
any longer marcus
your brother must be stopped
it ends tonight
we must move quickly
before they turn
is he still here
yes
viktor he must not be harmed
i gave you my word did i not
but william must be controlled
burn the bodies
search the outbuildings
form two groups
you douse them with fuel
yes sir
marcus
stay with me
give me the torch
theyre turning
retreat to the woods
ill stay and fight you need my help
i need you alive
if you die we all die
now go
go
we found him
and
we need more men
find amelia
amelia we found william
surround him
take him down
no
leave him be
stop this youre killing him
more
william
marcus
he was not to be harmed
place him in my charge
as we agreed
or you will pay for your deceit
and you will learn your place
your sympathy for this beast
is foolish
your brother is entirely
beyond control
it will be done my way
you know well the consequences
if you murder me
or william
if you so much as speak
his name again
you will have chosen
that future for him
what is thy will my lord
lmprisonment for all time
far from you
for six centuries i was a loyal soldier
of the vampire clan
but i was betrayed
the war was not as it had seemed
in one night the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed
kraven our secondincommand
had formed a secret alliance
with lucian
ruler of the werewolf clan
to overthrow viktor our leader
but kravens lust for power
and domination had failed
viktor was not the savior
i had been led to believe
he had betrayed us all
soon the hunt will be on
for his killer
i have but one ally left
michael
the human descendant
of corvinus
neither vampire nor lycan
but a hybrid
is only a matter of time
before were found
my only hope now
is to awaken marcus
our last remaining elder
and expose the truth
before kraven tries to murder him
while hes still in hibernation
kraven knows
hes no match for him awake
perfect
this things been dead for weeks
i thought lycans went back
to their human form when they die
they do is been given
a serum to stop regression
so it can be studied
how can you tell
not quite your department i guess
i just killed them i didnt pay
much attention to their anatomy
how long can we stay here
not long
these safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe
with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active
someone could have
picked us up already
theres only about an hour
till daylight
can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise
just
okay les get what we need and go
no
im going alone
open it
marcus
the blood memories
of this wretched creature
have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds
my lord i can explain
why would i listen to your lies
when the journey to the truth
is so much sweeter
i kept his secrets
cleaned up the mess
youll go before viktor
and tell him
exactly what i tell you to
you just concentrate on your part
please
i can assist you
oh you already have
if i can plead my case
theres a chance
youll be granted sanctuary
right now youll be killed on sight
im not prepared to risk it
what am i supposed to do wait
kraven may still have men with him
youre not going alone
youre not as strong
as you might think
what
michael youre unique
theres never been a hybrid before
however ambivalent you feel about it
your powers could be limitless
but you depend on blood
you need to feed
without it youll be growing weaker
by the second use the time for that
jesus christ
and what if i dont
what if i cant
normal food could be lethal
if you dont anticipate your cravings
you will attack humans
and believe me you dont want that
on your conscience
there really is
no going back michael
im sorry
look i understand what you did
im grateful
you saved my life
i wasnt ready to die
i dont know
everythings changed
i probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head
is a lot to process all at once
look go ill be here
you just make sure you come back
sir
the innocent who witnessed
theyve been silenced
but otherwise unharmed
as ordered
show me what you have
yes sir
two death dealers were killed
we found no lycan bodies
apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition
some sort of uv round
amelia
no one survived
it seems kravens men
might have been present
but they did nothing to prevent it
and viktor
and no trace of marcus
amongst the ashes
it seems he destroyed
his own coven sir
it was never his coven
we need to go
give me a moment
there you are
how you doing
thank you
youve got to get away from me
get away from me
hello
there
michael corvin
get the men up there now
get the fuck away from me
stop stop
shit
michael oh shit
here take it
no
michael youll die
shit
can you move
we need to go
marcus
i know what youve done selene
viktor deserved his fate
and kraven was no better
kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds
and viktor
viktor deserved his fate
many times over
a terrible business
the slaying of your family
yet so much effort was spent
to conceal this matter from me
what do you suppose
viktor had to hide
or perhaps it is you selene
as the last
of your wretched family
who has something to hide
go
get in
dead or alive
you will give me what i want
you okay
hes a hybrid isnt he
yes
he wanted this why
i dont know
but we have another problem
turn off up here
shit all right get down
keep your foot on the gas
but stay down
hold on
stay down
come on
give me your hand
jesus christ
theres really no need
ill be right back
all right let me see
see
no need
area secure sir
suns setting
whas wrong
the supplies were taken
used weapons were left behind
the tavern events occurred before
dawn so they couldnt have got far
remain airborne for the moment
im sure theyll reappear
in good time
yes sir
ive seen this before
when i was a child
ive held it
when it was open like this
how is that possible
i dont know
but i know someone that might
andreas tanis
he was the official historian
of the covens
he fell from favor after documenting
what viktor considered malicious lies
of course as it turns out
he was probably telling the truth
what happened to him
he was exiled over 300 years ago
three hundred years
what makes you think
well find him now
i was the one who exiled him
looks like a monastery
it used to be
more like a prison now
tanis has been hiding there
since viktors order
well be the first people
hes seen in centuries
thas odd
what
i dont remember this gate
being here before
take this
shit
go back
gotcha
fuck
i knew it was you selene
the stench of viktors blood
still lingers in your veins
tanis
i see your aim hasnt improved
you havent changed
you dont scare me selene
well were gonna
have to work on that
we need to talk
your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than i remember
how does a vampire
have lycan bodyguards
a gift
from a most persuasive client
lucian
why would lucian
wanna protect you
because he was trading with them
uv rounds
how long have you been
in the business of killing your own
ive done whas necessary
to survive
my decision was made easy the day
your precious viktor betrayed me
betrayal was something
he did very well
viktors dead i killed him
you
kill viktor
no i think not
oh unless youve learned the truth
so your eyes are finally open
isnt it interesting how the truth
is even harder to absorb
than light
you know i tried to stop him
of course
a travesty
committing such a horrible crime
and then turning you
that was too much to take
my protests are why he put me here
careful with that dear
makes a terrible bang
open the blades and theyre active
good to know
viktor put you here for a reason
but i doubt it was
because you had moral qualms
what do you know
very little of anything im afraid
well then perhaps im mistaken
and theres no use for you at all
marcus was after this why
some history is based on truth
and others on deception
viktor was not the first of our kind
as you were led to believe
he was once human
the ruler of these lands
marcus
hes the one
the source
the first true vampire
so the legend is true
toward the end of his ruthless life
when the next breath meant more
to viktor than silver or gold
marcus came with an offer
a reprieve from sickness
and death
immortality
and in return viktor was to use
his armyturnedimmortal to help him
to do what
to defeat
the very first werewolves
a dangerous
and infectious breed
created by marcus own
flesh and blood
his twin brother william
but these werent
the lycans we know
disgusting though
your brethren may be
they at least are evolved
no these were raging monsters
never able to take
human form again
it was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage
and williams appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable
he had to be stopped
and so once viktors army
was turned
the legions of vampires
under his control
tracked down
and destroyed the animals
then captured william
and locked him away
viktors prisoner for all time
why let him live
for the very same reason that viktor
never conspired against marcus fear
he was warned that
should marcus be killed
all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave
so in viktors mind
williams death would mean
the end for all lycans
his slaves
yes
yes a clever deception
but one viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test
and so marcus was protected
at all costs
yes here we are
vampires
mortals
men loyal to alexander corvinus
the father of us all
whas this
you should know
is williams prison
the prison your father
was commissioned to build
so youve been the one keeping
a watch over this for me have you
ive been searching everywhere
for this my darling
what is it
whas wrong
she now understands
why her family was killed
but that was many years later
the winter of lucians escape
your father knew too much
or too much for viktor to risk
especially when lucian
had the key to williams cell
and im the map
yes
the only one still living
who has seen its location
oh viktor realized youd be too young
to remember explicitly
but marcus knows
that the memory
and therefore the exact location
of williams prison
is hidden away in your blood
why is marcus looking
for him now
after all this time
that i cannot answer
but i do know someone
who could stop him
perhaps i could arrange a meeting
in exchange for your discretion
of course
of course
tanis you seem anxious
why do you flee
the very sight of me
please
sit
theres no need
for this to be unpleasant
ive always rather enjoyed
your company
now youre being rude
sorry
viktor struck two keys
what do you know of them
keys
i dont know of any keys
oh yes
yes those keys
yes
well one was
one was kept in plain sight
draped around
his daughters neck
right there for you to see
and the other
kept with viktor at all times
where
within him
beneath the flesh
please please
i beg you please
please i beg you
who could stop him
perhaps i could arrange a meeting
go to pier 17
ask for lorenz macaro
how do we know tanis
isnt setting us up
hes not brave enough
to set me up
you can go
youre familiar with this then
intimately
youre alexander corvinus
there was a time
that i was known by that name
by any name
i am still your forefather
how have you stayed hidden
all these years
for centuries ive stood by
and watched the havoc
my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity
not the legacy i prayed for
the morning i watched them
enter this world
and a tiresome duty
keeping the war contained
cleaning up the mess
hiding my familys
unfortunate history
couldnt you have stopped it
yes
could you kill your own sons
you know what marcus will do
if he finds me
he finds williams prison
you need to help us stop him
you are asking me
to help you kill my son
you
a death dealer
how many innocents did you kill
in the sixcentury quest
to avenge your family
spare me
your selfrighteous declarations
you are no different from marcus
and even less noble than william
at least he cannot control
his savagery
anything ive done
can be laid at your feet
hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept
that your sons are monsters
that they create monsters
you coulïve stopped all of this
do not come groveling to me
simply because you are weaker
than your adversary
you know the devastation william
caused before he was captured
he cannot be set free
wa no wait
youre no match for him
soon brother
no
father
no
theyve gone
there there my child
you are safe now
no michael
look at me
michael
shit
please
come on
fuck
hello father
you are unwelcome in my presence
the predictable heart
that never thaws
pity it beats within such a fool
the eldest of the immortals
yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny
we are oddities of nature you and i
nothing more
this is a world for humanity
and that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons
why you stood by
for over half a millennium
as william suffered alone
in darkness
no father
i have no respect
for your petty sentiment
viktors key where is it
whatever plan you have
for william is futile
you cannot control your brother
oh i am stronger now
and our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge
youre wrong
soon youll be drowning in lycans
just like before
oh not lycans father
or vampires
a new race created in
the image of their maker
their new god
me
and a true god
has no father
you will fail
get the kit
no
please sir let us help you
the time has come my friend
find the girl
bring her to me
no wait wait
if you want marcus
youll need alexanders help
dont leave him here
did he get the pendant
yes
hes too powerful for you alone
you are the only one
older than he is
the only one stronger
you could have killed him yourself
no matter what hes become
he is my son
you are the last hope left
there is only one way
to defeat him
quickly now
before there is no more legacy
left in my veins
what will i become
the future
go now
were getting close
head back around
towards the river
i dont see a way inside
there used to be
a river entrance just there
it must be submerged now
looks like were getting wet
closer
selene
william
wait
no william stop
be still brother
is me
id no sooner harm you than myself
which way
is this it
hes already here
what is that
nothing les go
were too late
after him
get behind him
impressive
michael youre unique
theres never been
a hybrid before
your powers could be limitless
hold it oh fuck
where is he
he went right through there
all we have are uv rounds
they wont take him down
no but theyll slow him down
les go
you all right
jesus christ
but these werent
the lycans we know
no these were raging monsters
unable to take human form
ever again
what are you waiting for
shoot them
i cant not without taking her out
i cant get a shot
michael
take her down
cut us loose
were going down
william
i knew viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet
he should have killed you
with the rest of your family
an unknown chapter lies ahead
the lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred
