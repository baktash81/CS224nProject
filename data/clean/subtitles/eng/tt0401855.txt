this monster s aftermath 
i will not tolerate this
any longer  marcus 
your brother must be stopped 
it ends tonight 
we must move quickly 
before they turn 
is he still here 
yes 
viktor  he must not be harmed 
i gave you my word  did i not 
but william must be controlled 
burn the bodies 
search the outbuildings 
form two groups 
you  douse them with fuel 
  yes  sir 
  marcus 
stay with me 
give me the torch 
they re turning 
  retreat to the woods 
  i ll stay and fight  you need my help 
i need you alive 
if you die  we all die 
now  go 
go 
  we found him 
  and 
  we need more men 
  find amelia 
amelia  we found william 
surround him 
take him down 
no 
leave him be 
stop this  you re killing him 
more 
william 
marcus 
he was not to be harmed 
place him in my charge
as we agreed   
   or you will pay for your deceit 
and you will learn your place 
your sympathy for this beast
is foolish 
your brother is entirely
beyond control 
it will be done my way 
you know well the consequences
if you murder me   
   or william 
if you so much as speak
his name again   
   you will have chosen
that future for him 
what is thy will  my lord 
lmprisonment for all time 
far from you 
for six centuries i was a loyal soldier
of the vampire clan 
but i was betrayed 
the war was not as it had seemed 
in one night  the lies that had united
our kind had been exposed 
kraven  our second in command   
   had formed a secret alliance
with lucian   
   ruler of the werewolf clan   
   to overthrow viktor  our leader 
but kraven s lust for power
and domination had failed 
viktor was not the savior
i had been led to believe 
he had betrayed us all 
soon the hunt will be on
for his killer 
i have but one ally left 
michael   
   the human descendant
of corvinus 
neither vampire nor lycan   
   but a hybrid 
i s only a matter of time
before we re found 
my only hope now
is to awaken marcus   
   our last remaining elder   
   and expose the truth   
   before kraven tries to murder him
while he s still in hibernation 
kraven knows
he s no match for him awake 
perfect 
this thing s been dead for weeks 
i thought lycans went back
to their human form when they die 
they do  i s been given
a serum to stop regression   
   so it can be studied 
how can you tell 
not quite your department  i guess 
i just killed them  i didn t pay
much attention to their anatomy 
  how long can we stay here 
  not long 
these safe houses are
linked together on one mainframe   
   with motion sensors revealing
which ones are active 
someone could have
picked us up already 
there s only about an hour
till daylight 
can you make it back
to the mansion before sunrise 
  just 
  okay  le s get what we need and go 
no 
i m going alone 
open it 
marcus 
the blood memories
of this wretched creature   
   have shown me that your treachery
knows no bounds 
my lord  i can explain 
why would i listen to your lies   
   when the journey to the truth   
   is so much sweeter 
i kept his secrets 
cleaned up the mess 
you ll go before viktor   
   and tell him
exactly what i tell you to 
you just concentrate on your part 
please 
i can assist you 
oh  you already have 
if i can plead my case   
   there s a chance
you ll be granted sanctuary 
right now  you ll be killed on sight 
i m not prepared to risk it 
what am i supposed to do  wait 
kraven may still have men with him 
you re not going alone 
you re not as strong
as you might think 
  what 
  michael  you re unique 
there s never been a hybrid before 
however ambivalent you feel about it 
your powers could be limitless 
but you depend on blood 
you need to feed 
without it  you ll be growing weaker
by the second  use the time for that 
jesus christ 
and what if i don t 
what if i can t 
normal food could be lethal 
if you don t anticipate your cravings 
you will attack humans 
and believe me  you don t want that
on your conscience 
there really is
no going back  michael 
i m sorry 
look  i understand what you did 
i m grateful 
you saved my life 
i wasn t ready to die 
i don t know 
everything s changed 
i probably need a minute
to make it all fit in my head 
i s a lot to process all at once 
look  go  i ll be here 
you just make sure you come back 
sir 
the innocent who witnessed   
   they ve been silenced 
but otherwise unharmed 
as ordered 
  show me what you have 
  yes  sir 
two death dealers were killed 
we found no lycan bodies 
apparently they were using
a new kind of ammunition   
   some sort of uv round 
amelia 
no one survived 
it seems kraven s men
might have been present   
   but they did nothing to prevent it 
and viktor 
and no trace of marcus
amongst the ashes 
it seems he destroyed
his own coven  sir 
it was never his coven 
we need to go 
give me a moment 
there you are 
how you doing 
thank you 
you ve got to get away from me 
get away from me 
hello 
there 
michael corvin 
get the men up there  now 
get the fuck away from me 
stop  stop 
shit 
michael  oh  shit 
  here  take it 
  no 
michael  you ll die 
shit 
can you move 
we need to go 
marcus 
i know what you ve done  selene 
viktor deserved his fate
and kraven was no better 
kraven has already reaped
the rewards of his own misdeeds 
and viktor   
viktor deserved his fate   
   many times over 
a terrible business   
   the slaying of your family 
yet so much effort was spent   
   to conceal this matter from me 
what do you suppose
viktor had to hide 
or perhaps it is you  selene   
   as the last
of your wretched family   
   who has something to hide 
go 
get in 
dead or alive 
you will give me what i want 
you okay 
  he s a hybrid  isn t he 
  yes 
he wanted this  why 
i don t know 
but we have another problem 
turn off up here 
shit  all right  get down 
keep your foot on the gas 
but stay down 
hold on 
stay down 
come on 
give me your hand 
jesus christ 
there s really no need 
i ll be right back 
all right  let me see 
see 
no need 
area secure  sir 
sun s setting 
wha s wrong 
the supplies were taken 
used weapons were left behind 
the tavern events occurred before
dawn  so they couldn t have got far 
remain airborne for the moment 
i m sure they ll reappear   
   in good time 
  yes  sir 
i ve seen this before 
when i was a child 
i ve held it 
when it was open  like this 
how is that possible 
i don t know 
but i know someone that might 
andreas tanis 
he was the official historian
of the covens 
he fell from favor after documenting
what viktor considered malicious lies 
of course  as it turns out 
he was probably telling the truth 
what happened to him 
he was exiled over 300 years ago 
three hundred years 
what makes you think
we ll find him now 
i was the one who exiled him 
looks like a monastery 
it used to be 
more like a prison now 
tanis has been hiding there
since viktor s order 
we ll be the first people
he s seen in centuries 
  tha s odd 
  what 
i don t remember this gate
being here before 
take this 
shit 
go back 
gotcha 
fuck 
i knew it was you  selene 
the stench of viktor s blood
still lingers in your veins 
tanis 
i see your aim hasn t improved 
you haven t changed 
you don t scare me  selene 
well  we re gonna
have to work on that 
we need to talk 
your exile seems a bit more
comfortable than i remember 
how does a vampire
have lycan bodyguards 
a gift 
from a most persuasive client 
lucian 
why would lucian
wanna protect you 
because he was trading with them 
uv rounds 
how long have you been
in the business of killing your own 
i ve done wha s necessary
to survive 
my decision was made easy the day
your precious viktor betrayed me 
betrayal was something
he did very well 
viktor s dead  i killed him 
you 
kill viktor 
no  i think not 
oh  unless you ve learned the truth 
so your eyes are finally open 
isn t it interesting how the truth   
   is even harder to absorb
than light 
you know  i tried to stop him 
of course 
a travesty 
committing such a horrible crime 
and then turning you 
that was too much to take 
my protests are why he put me here 
careful with that  dear 
makes a terrible bang 
open the blades and they re active 
good to know 
viktor put you here for a reason 
but i doubt it was   
   because you had moral qualms 
  what do you know 
  very little of anything  i m afraid 
well  then  perhaps i m mistaken
and there s no use for you at all 
marcus was after this  why 
some history is based on truth   
   and others on deception 
viktor was not the first of our kind 
as you were led to believe 
he was once human   
   the ruler of these lands 
marcus   
   he s the one 
the source 
the first true vampire 
so the legend is true 
toward the end of his ruthless life   
   when the next breath meant more
to viktor than silver or gold   
   marcus came with an offer   
   a reprieve from sickness
and death 
immortality 
and in return  viktor was to use
his army turned immortal to help him 
to do what 
to defeat
the very first werewolves   
   a dangerous
and infectious breed   
   created by marcus  own
flesh and blood 
his twin brother  william 
but these weren t
the lycans we know 
disgusting though
your brethren may be   
   they at least are evolved 
no  these were raging monsters 
never able to take
human form again 
it was only later generations
that learned to channel their rage 
and william s appetite for destruction
and rampage was insatiable 
he had to be stopped 
and so once viktor s army
was turned   
   the legions of vampires
under his control   
   tracked down
and destroyed the animals   
   then captured william   
   and locked him away 
viktor s prisoner for all time 
why let him live 
for the very same reason that viktor
never conspired against marcus  fear 
he was warned that 
should marcus be killed   
   all those in his bloodline
would follow him to the grave 
so in viktor s mind   
   william s death would mean
the end for all lycans   
   his slaves 
yes 
yes  a clever deception   
   but one viktor was hardly willing
to put to the test 
and so marcus was protected   
   at all costs 
yes  here we are 
  vampires 
  mortals 
men loyal to alexander corvinus 
the father of us all 
wha s this 
you should know 
i s william s prison 
the prison your father
was commissioned to build 
so you ve been the one keeping
a watch over this for me  have you 
i ve been searching everywhere
for this  my darling 
what is it 
wha s wrong 
she now understands
why her family was killed 
but that was many years later 
the winter of lucian s escape 
your father knew too much 
or too much for viktor to risk   
   especially when lucian   
   had the key to william s cell 
and i m the map 
yes 
the only one still living
who has seen its location 
oh  viktor realized you d be too young
to remember explicitly   
   but marcus knows
that the memory   
   and therefore the exact location
of william s prison   
   is hidden away in your blood 
why is marcus looking
for him now   
   after all this time 
that i cannot answer 
but i do know someone   
   who could stop him 
perhaps i could arrange a meeting 
in exchange for your discretion 
of course 
of course 
tanis  you seem anxious 
why do you flee
the very sight of me 
please   
   sit 
there s no need
for this to be unpleasant 
i ve always rather enjoyed
your company 
now you re being rude 
sorry 
viktor struck two keys 
what do you know of them 
keys 
i don t know of any keys 
oh  yes 
yes  those keys 
  yes 
  well  one was   
one was kept in plain sight   
   draped around
his daughter s neck   
   right there for you to see 
  and the other 
  kept with viktor at all times 
  where 
within him 
beneath the flesh 
please  please 
i beg you  please 
please  i beg you 
  who could stop him 
perhaps i could arrange a meeting 
go to pier 17 
ask for lorenz macaro 
how do we know tanis
isn t setting us up 
he s not brave enough
to set me up 
you can go 
you re familiar with this  then 
intimately 
you re alexander corvinus 
there was a time
that i was known by that name 
by any name 
i am still your forefather 
how have you stayed hidden
all these years 
for centuries i ve stood by
and watched the havoc   
   my sons have wrought upon
each other and upon humanity 
not the legacy i prayed for   
   the morning i watched them
enter this world 
and a tiresome duty   
   keeping the war contained 
cleaning up the mess   
   hiding my family s
unfortunate history 
  couldn t you have stopped it 
  yes 
could you kill your own sons 
you know what marcus will do 
if he finds me 
he finds william s prison 
you need to help us stop him 
you are asking me
to help you kill my son 
you 
a death dealer 
how many innocents did you kill   
   in the six century quest
to avenge your family 
spare me
your self righteous declarations 
you are no different from marcus
and even less noble than william 
at least he cannot control
his savagery 
anything i ve done
can be laid at your feet 
hundreds of thousands have died
because of your inability to accept   
   that your sons are monsters 
that they create monsters 
you coulïve stopped all of this 
do not come groveling to me   
   simply because you are weaker
than your adversary 
you know the devastation william
caused before he was captured 
he cannot be set free 
wa  no  wait 
you re no match for him 
soon  brother 
no 
father 
no 
they ve gone 
there  there  my child 
you are safe now 
no  michael 
look at me 
michael 
shit 
please 
come on 
fuck 
hello  father 
you are unwelcome in my presence 
the predictable heart
that never thaws 
pity it beats within such a fool 
the eldest of the immortals   
   yet you have made no attempt
to seize your destiny 
we are oddities of nature  you and i 
nothing more 
this is a world for humanity 
and that petty sentiment explains
why you rejected your sons 
why you stood by
for over half a millennium   
   as william suffered alone
in darkness 
no  father 
i have no respect
for your petty sentiment 
viktor s key  where is it 
whatever plan you have
for william is futile 
  you cannot control your brother 
  oh  i am stronger now 
and our bond is greater than you
have ever wanted to acknowledge 
you re wrong 
soon you ll be drowning in lycans 
just like before 
oh  not lycans  father   
   or vampires 
a new race  created in
the image of their maker   
   their new god 
me 
and a true god   
   has no father 
you will fail 
  get the kit 
  no 
please  sir  let us help you 
the time has come  my friend 
find the girl 
bring her to me 
no  wait  wait 
if you want marcus 
you ll need alexander s help 
don t leave him here 
  did he get the pendant 
  yes 
he s too powerful for you alone 
you are the only one
older than he is   
   the only one stronger 
you could have killed him yourself 
no matter what he s become   
   he is my son 
you are the last hope left 
there is only one way
to defeat him 
quickly  now   
   before there is no more legacy
left in my veins 
what will i become 
the future 
go now 
we re getting close 
head back around
towards the river 
i don t see a way inside 
there used to be
a river entrance just there 
it must be submerged now 
looks like we re getting wet 
closer 
selene 
william 
wait 
no  william  stop 
be still  brother 
i s me 
i d no sooner harm you than myself 
which way 
is this it 
he s already here 
what is that 
nothing  le s go 
we re too late 
  after him 
  get behind him 
impressive 
michael  you re unique 
there s never been
a hybrid before 
your powers could be limitless 
hold it  oh  fuck 
  where is he 
  he went right through there 
all we have are uv rounds 
they won t take him down 
no  but they ll slow him down 
le s go 
you all right 
jesus christ 
but these weren t
the lycans we know 
no  these were raging monsters 
unable to take human form
ever again 
what are you waiting for 
shoot them 
i can t  not without taking her out 
i can t get a shot 
michael 
take her down 
cut us loose 
we re going down 
william 
i knew viktor made a mistake
by keeping you as a pet 
he should have killed you
with the rest of your family 
an unknown chapter lies ahead 
the lines that had divided the clans
have now been blurred
