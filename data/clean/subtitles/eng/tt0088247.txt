he s really moving   punching lights 
i m gonna need an ambulance
at seventh and broadway right now 
hold it 
hold on 
are you injured  are you shot

do you understand 
  do you understand 
  yes  please don t hurt me 
i m here to help you 
i m reese  sergeant tech com 
dn38 416  assigned to protect you 
you ve been targeted for termination 
this is one l 19  westbound
on olympic  approaching overland 
this is a mistake  i didn t do anything 
no  but you will 
it s very important that you live 
this isn t true  how could that man
just get up after you   
it s not a man  a machine 
a terminator 
cyberdyne systems model 101 
a machine  like a robot 
not a robot  a cyborg  
cybernetic organism 
  no  he was bleeding 
  just a second 
get your head down 
listen  the terminator s an infiltration
unit  part man  part machine 
underneath it s a hyper alloy combat
chassis  microprocessor controlled 
fully armoured  very tough 
outside it s living human tissue 
flesh  skin  hair  blood  
grown for the cyborgs 
  look  reese  i don t know   
  pay attention 
i gotta ditch this car 
the 600 series had rubber skin 
we spotted them easy 
but these are new  they look human 
sweat  bad breath  everything 
very hard to spot 
i had to wait till he moved on you
before i could zero him 
look  i am not stupid 
they cannot make things like that yet 
not yet  not for about forty years 
are you saying it s from the future 
one possible future   
from your point of view 
i don t know tech stuff 
then you re from the future  too 
is that right 
  right 
  right 
cyborgs don t feel pain 
i do  don t do that again 
  just let me go 
  listen and understand 
that terminator is out there 
it can t be bargained with 
it can t be reasoned with 
it doesn t feel pity or remorse or fear
and it absolutely will not stop 
ever  until you are dead 
can you stop it 
i don t know 
with these weapons  i don t know 
all units  ford suspect vehicle has
been found in a parking structure   
reese  why me 
why does it want me 
there was a nuclear war 
a few years from now 
all this  this whole place  everything 
it s gone  just gone 
there were survivors 
here  there 
nobody even knew who started it 
  it was the machines  sarah 
  i don t understand 
defence network computers 
new  powerful 
hooked into everything 
trusted to run it all 
they say it got smart  
a new order of intelligence 
then it saw all people as a threat 
not just the ones on the other side 
it decided our fate in a microsecond 
extermination 
did you see this war 
no  i grew up after  in the ruins 
starving  hiding from the h ks 
  h ks 
  hunter killers 
patrol machines
built in automated factories 
most of us were rounded up 
put in camps for orderly disposal 
this was burned in by laser scanner 
some of us were kept alive  to work 
loading bodies 
the disposal units ran night and day 
we were that close to going out for ever 
but there was one man
who taught us to fight 
to storm the wire of the camps 
to smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk 
he turned it around 
he brought us back from the brink 
his name was connor  john connor 
your son  sarah  your unborn son 
drive 
reese 
no  reese  no  no  they ll kill you 
you in the cadillac 
let me see your hands now 
get out of the car 
drop to your knees 
  out of the car 
  drop to the ground 
sarah  sarah  try to drink some of this 
listen  are you sure it s them 
i mean 
maybe i should look at the bodies 
no  they ve been identified
and there s no doubt 
ginger  kiddo 
  sarah  this is dr silberman 
  hi  sarah 
tell him everything reese told you 
sarah  do you feel up to that 
yeah  i guess so 
  you re a doctor 
  criminal psychologist 
  is reese crazy 
  that s what we re gonna find out 
so you re a soldier  fighting for whom 
with the 132nd under perry 
from  21 to  27 
that s the year 2027 
that s right  then i was assigned   
  this is fucking great 
     under john connor 
  who was the enemy 
  a computer defence system   
goddamn  sorry 
   built for sac norad
by cyberdyne systems 
i see 
and this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy 
killing him  in effect 
before he s even conceived 
a sort of retroactive abortion 
silberman cracks me up 
last week  a guy burned his afghan 
  he screwed it first   
  ed  shut up 
why didn t the computer
just kill connor then 
why this elaborate scheme
with the terminator 
it had no choice 
their defence grid was smashed 
we d won  taking out connor then
would make no difference 
skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence 
is that when you captured the lab
complex and found   what is it called 
the time displacement equipment 
that s right  the terminator
had already gone through 
connor sent me to intercept
and they blew the whole place 
well  how are you supposed to get back 
i can t 
nobody goes home 
nobody else comes through 
it s just him and me 
it s just him and me 
why didn t you bring any weapons 
something more advanced 
don t you have ray guns 
  ray guns 
  show me a piece of future technology 
you go naked  something about the
field generated by a living organism 
nothing dead will go 
i didn t build the fucking thing 
ok  ok  but this cyborg  if it s metal    
  surrounded by living tissue 
  oh  right 
great stuff 
i could make a career out of this guy 
see how clever it is 
it doesn t require a shred of proof 
most paranoid delusions are intricate 
but this is brilliant 
  why were the other women killed 
  records were lost in the war 
skynet knew almost nothing
about connor s mother 
her full name  where she lived 
they just knew the city 
the terminator was
just being systematic 
  let s go back   
  look  you have heard enough 
i have answered your questions 
i have to see sarah connor 
  i m afraid that s not up to me 
  then why am i talking to you 
  who is in authority here 
  please   
shut up 
you still don t get it  do you 
he ll find her  that s what he does 
that s all he does 
you can t stop him  he ll reach down
her throat and pull her fucking heart out 
  doc 
  let go of me 
he s crazy 
in technical terminology  he s a loon 
sarah  this is what they call body armour 
our tac guys wear these 
it ll stop a 12 gauge round 
this other man must ve been wearing
one under his coat  feel that 
  he punched through the windshield 
  he was probably on pcp 
broke every bone in his hand 
he wouldn t feel it 
there was this guy once   
you see this scar 
thank you 
be at least an hour
before your mother gets here 
  i can t sleep 
  try 
it may not look it 
but that couch is very comfortable 
you ll be perfectly safe 
we got 30 cops in this building 
thank you 
  good night 
  good night 
i m a friend of sarah connor 
i was told she s here  could i see her 
no  can t see her 
she s making a statement 
where is she 
it make take a while  if you wanna wait 
there s a bench over there 
i ll be back 
stay here 
watch him

i d die for john connor 
well  at least now i know

don t suppose you know who the father is
so i won t tell him to get lost 
john never said much about him 
  i know he dies before the war   
  wait 
i don t wanna know 
so was it john that sent you here 
  why 
  it was a chance to meet the legend 
sarah connor

your son gave me a message
to give to you  made me memorise it 
thank you  sarah 
for your courage through the dark years 
i can t help you with what you must
soon face  the future is not set

about what 
tell me about where you re from 
you stay down by day

because the h ks use infrared 
but they re not too bright 
john taught us ways to dust them 
that s when the infiltrators
started to appear 
the terminators were the newest 
the worst 
traversing your sector in search mode
750 metres north of your position

you were young like you are now 
you seemed just a little sad 
i used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment 
i memorised every line

what to tell you and what not to 
but i guess i have a while before you re
old enough to understand these tapes 
they re more for me at this point
just so that i can get it straight 
fill her up 
should i tell you about your father 
boy  that s a tough one 
will it effect your decision to send him
here  knowing that he is your father 
if you don t send kyle  you can never be 
god  a person could go crazy
thinking about this 
i suppose i will tell you 
i owe him that 
maybe it ll help if   
you know that in the few hours
that we had together 
we loved a lifetime s worth 
  what did he just say 
  he says you re very beautiful 
but if he doesn t
