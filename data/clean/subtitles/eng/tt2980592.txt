  okay 
  drive safe 
  bye  mom 
  you got your lunch 
  yeah 
mrs  peterson 
yes  can i  help you 
my name is david 
mrs  peterson 
i   
i knew your son caleb 
we trained together and served together
and  well  we came to be good friends 
would you like to come inside 
thank you  ma am 
so  are you sure i can t
get you anything 
maybe just some water would be nice 
how did you get here 
i ran 
i needed the exercise 
from the bus station  i mean  in town 
you ran that whole way 
yes  ma am 
here you go 
all right  thank you  ma am 
when did you get out 
well  i was discharged on wednesday
and i came straight here
from fort kennilworth 
you came straight here first thing 
yeah  i wanted to come by sooner 
but i couldn t get leave 
why 
well  i was discharged
 cause i was wounded 
i was in a military hospital for a bit 
so it wasn t really the kind of
thing you could get leave from 
but don t worry  it was just
a bit of shrapnel in my back 
i m right as rain now 
no  i meant  why did
you come here first thing 
well  like i said  me and
your son caleb  we were   
we were pretty close 
i was with him when he died 
  really 
  yes  ma am 
and one of the things he asked
was for me to check on you all 
you and your whole family here 
he wanted me to tell
you that he loved you 
he specifically wanted me
to tell each one of you that
he loved you and he was thinking
of you guys up until the end 
i said i d do that and so  here i am 
would you excuse me  please 
that s me 
right there 
well  i ll be   
i remember that day 
it wasn t my intention
to upset you  ma am 
i probably should have called first 
but i don t own a cell phone yet and 
i guess  i just wasn t thinking 
i m going to be on my way now 
but i d like it if we
could exchange e mails   
wait  no 
anna  caleb s sister  she works
nights  and she sleeps late 
and i know she would love to meet you 
would you stay a little while longer 
oh  you re not just saying
that to be polite now 
 cause you don t need to be 
no  i m not  please  stay  it s   
it s nice having you here
and i would love to hear
more about you and caleb 
well  all right 
   caleb and me  we figure that sounds 
more like a challenge
than anything else 
so  that night after he falls asleep 
we kind of crept over to his
cot with a tube of superglue 
oh  no 
we didn t do anything too bad to him 
though  we could have  you know 
hey  there you are  anna  this is david 
very nice to meet you 
caleb told me a lot about you 
david just got discharged this week 
he was a friend of your brother s 
you knew caleb 
yes  ma am 
 yes  ma am  
okay 
so  where are you staying 
well  i noticed a motel off the
highway on the way here   
no  no  no  no  you will stay
with us while you re here 
oh  no  i couldn t put you all out 
nonsense  we would love to have you 
we have plenty of room 
in fact  you can stay
in caleb s old room 
we insist 
well  i won t argue 
just for tonight  though 
well  i ve got to head to the diner 
it was really great meeting you 
likewise  very nice meeting you 
  i guess i ll see you later 
  bye 
can i show you to your room 
great 
there are clean towels in the bathroom
if you d like to freshen up 
mrs  peterson  are you sure you re
comfortable with me staying in here 
of course 
i mean  it s not like
it s going to any use 
i think it could be a good thing for us 
i m gonna go and let you get settled in 
if you need anything  just holler 
oh  my god 
fucking pussy 
oh  my god 
oh  it s okay  little baby  don t cry 
hey  there 
how was your day 
it was good 
great 
   giving him a chance 
it s that i don t like the idea of
some random guy off the
street being invited to stay
in my house with my family 
so  you knew my brother 
i did  pretty well  yeah 
he wanted me to tell
you that he loved you 
oh  thanks 
even though he says he
was friends with caleb 
he s in the photograph of caleb s squad 
you saw the photograph 
  he was not a stranger 
  you know what 
what if he has the ptsd
or whatever it s called 
some of these guys come back with
mental health problems  laura 
did you take that into account 
what if caleb had come back different 
did you take that into account 
wow  that is   
your parents are fighting about me 
yeah  they argue a lot 
you look like you got hit or something 
yeah  yeah  i got hit with
a football in gym class 
yeah  that can happen 
yeah 
no  no  you re right 
you re right  let s talk to him 
hi  great  okay 
david  we re very happy
to have you here 
i m gonna have a beer before dinner

oh  no  thank you 
mrs  peterson  i m fine 
yeah  hit this 
look out    shit 
no   
  now 
  no  i m good  but thank you 
so  that friend of your brother s 
is he sticking around 
i don t know  i hope not 
why  you said you liked him 
i said he seemed nice 
that s not the same thing 
oh  okay 
why don t you like him 
i don t not like him 
it s just  i   
i mean  you kind of knew caleb 
we ve all   
i just know mom and dad
have been trying to move on
and it s not like they don t have
enough reminders in this town 
yeah 
i don t know 
that seems pretty normal to me 
you know  like  your kid dies 
that s hard 
yeah 
guess we just don t need a walking 
breathing reminder
of him right now  you know 
yeah  totally 
i ve got to go 
hey  wait a second  wait a second 
  stop  i can t   
  what 
no  no  let s just hang out

  yes  i do 
but i m sure we can find some
time at kristen s tomorrow  okay 
stop  i have to go 
the sine is the angle of
the ship s anchor cable 
so the cable is the hypotenuse 
and what we need to find out
is the distance down
to the ocean bottom 
so that s the opposite  do you see 
not really 
so  you re kind of smart 
i guess so 
hey  how was work

david  sure i can t get you a beer 
you know  i will have one  thank you 
  i ll take one  too 
  yeah  i m sure you will

are you helping him with his homework 
well  not exactly 
hey  don t go 
stick around  be sociable 
i m kind of tired 
i think i m gonna lay down 
okay  suit yourself 
but allan  his name s allan

like  four years  but he s got a degree 
so  boom  suddenly he s
regional manager and i m not

and demanded you serve them drinks 
well  you tried to id them  but 
they threatened to cause trouble 
there was a fight

let s get started 
let s start with this 
i mean  it s a standard beretta 
i m sure you re familiar with it 
in my opinion  if you ve seen one
of these  you ve seen them all 
but this baby  this here is
a 9 millimeter witness elite 
it s a very similar weapon to
the beretta  but i prefer the recoil 
i mean  it s got
absolutely no kick at all 
you army 
yes  sir 
i m navy  myself 
yeah  that s fine 
you want the elite 
oh  i ll take  em all 
all the handguns 
no  everything  all your guns 
shit

look  man  if you ve brought
money for all of them 
i ll cut you a deal 
you can take  em all off my hands 
no  i m going to kill you 
hey  what the fuck  david 
now  you listen to me

i called the army base
that david said that he
was just discharged from 
i wanted to ask about him 
what  why would you do that 
spencer 
i need a drink 
  why  what happened 
  i m getting a drink  honey 
they found allan 
you know my boss  allan 
he d been missing from
work for a couple of days 
everybody got very worried 
so one of his friends went
over and broke into his house 
and they found him
and his girlfriend dead 
they d both taken a bunch
of prescription pills 
it was like they committed
suicide together or something 
oh  my god 
but that doesn t make any sense 
he was   
no  the guy was totally normal 
but the police are investigating 
you know  it s   
doesn t look like it was a break in 
there was no forced entries 
she    the girl    she had   
she had bruises on her body 
i don t know what that means 
anyway  we will leave it for the police
to tell us exactly what happened 
i don t know 
damn thing is this makes
me regional manager 
yeah  as soon as corporate
found out  they called me 
right away they want
me to start tomorrow 
and they re offering me allan s salary 
so   
well  that s   
yeah 
careful what you wish for 
david 
i m sorry to interrupt 
no  don t be silly  it s fine 
i m having a drink 
would you join me 
oh  sure 
i ll be right back 
  hello 
  hey  anna

need to talk to you about 
what is it 
oh  shit  fuck 
babe  i got to go  all right 
i ll call you back 
hello 
i just heard from zeke 
how are you doing 
i just don t get it 
who d want to hurt craig 
yeah  i know  can you
sit down for a second 
yeah 
so  how does this work again 
first you make a hole at the top 
so you can reach in and
scoop all the guts out 
oh  man 
your parents  knives suck 
yeah 
that s better 
do you carry that with you 
like  all the time 
oh  this thing  sure 
why 
i don t know 
just in case 
i called the army base that
david said that he was from 
they told me that david
collins died a week ago 
he was in some military
hospital in arizona 
there was a fire from oxygen tanks 
about 20 people died 
david collins was one of them 
does david have any id  credit cards 
i ve never seen him use a wallet 
what about his phone 
he has a burner  right 
why don t you check some
of the numbers he s called 
your brother knows computers 
have him look some of them up 
yeah  that s a good idea 
hey  kristen  i think that
couple s been done for a bit 
i ve got it  thanks 
call me after work  okay 
  take care of yourself 
  you  too 
do you want some advice  luke 
sure 
never let anyone pick on you 
otherwise  you ll carry it with
you the rest of your life 
those kids at school 
they re bigger than you 
yeah 
then bring a knife to school 
if they take it off of
you and beat you up 
you go around their houses at night
and burn them down with
their families inside 
what s the worst they can do 
yeah  okay 
here  you keep it 
you re giving this to me 
yeah  man  it s yours  i ve got others 
thanks 
hey 
mom and dad around 
no  they went to the store 
your mom s making pumpkin pie 
that s cool 
shit 
fuck 
fuck 
oh  my god 
hello 
hey  it s  me 
hey 
what 
they found the gun that
killed craig in your van 
yeah  it was wiped clean 
i guess they just got an
anonymous tip or something 
but you re innocent 
anna  i know  but 
then they searched my room 
and they found some
other stuff  you know 
so  it looks like i m actually
gonna be here for a little while 
i love you  all right 
yeah  i know  i gotta go 
okay 
love you  bye 
honey  you okay 
i   
my friend craig was killed today 
oh  my god  i m so sorry 
how  what happened 
he was shot  i don t know 
and they arrested zeke for it 
  zeke 
  i m sorry  honey 
but if they arrested your ex boyfriend 
it was probably for a very good reason 
we all know zeke was never
exactly a pillar of this community 
he s not my ex boyfriend 
dad  he s my boyfriend 
i never stopped seeing him 
i m 20 years old  i can date who i want 
as long as you live in
this house  you cannot 
oh  you know nothing about him  nothing 
  i know he s a drugged out punk junkie   
  really  dad 
   who started dating my daughter
when she was 17 years old 
is what i know 
right 
what about him 
everybody s best friend 
i called the military base
that he said he was from
and they told me he was dead 
that s military intelligence for you 
right  ask to see his id 
he s not david collins  okay 
we don t know who he is 
i was part of a special forces
unit when i was injured 
so they should be
providing a cover story
if any civilians ask about me 
that s a good thing 
but i did get my dog tags back 
they re right here 
i don t like to wear them because   
well  i don t know  but   
i like having them with me 
though  you know 
as for id  i don t have
a current license 
but  i ve got my documents
in my bag  should i go   
no  no  no  that won t be necessary 
anna peterson 
you owe him an apology right now 
  no fucking way 
  you watch your mouth  young lady 
i am very sorry about your friend craig 
that s a terrible thing that happened 
as far as it goes with zeke
hastings and his crew 
i have it on very good authority they re
nothing but a bunch of pot dealers 
you wanna know why zeke
was arrested for murder 
because he probably did it  that s why 
  fuck you 
  spencer 
hey  now  anna 
i m sorry  honey 
david  i m terribly sorry 
no  that s okay 
she s    she s upset 
i probably should have explained
the  special forces thing earlier 
it s just  we re not really
supposed to talk about it 
no  i understand 
i could use a drink 
how about you  david 
yes  please 
what 
hey 
i just wanted to say   
i just wanted to say how
sorry i am about craig 
he seemed like a really cool guy 
and zeke getting arrested   
again  i m very sorry 
i know you don t need me
here at this stressful time 
i m not helping  which is a shame 
because i promised caleb i would do
anything i could to help your family 
but just so you know  i ll be
moving on in a couple of days 
so  you don t need to put up
with me much longer  okay 
okay 
okay 
good 
what is this 
is this the cd you made me 
yeah 
is it done 
yeah 
well  thank you 
i can t wait to listen to it 
i want every contractor
within a 100 mile radius 
and i don t care where they come from 
kpg  ex military  whatever 
i ll need a team mobilized
by the time i land 
i ll give them the necessary
mission specs in person 
we can t risk a leak on this 
good luck 
you took a picture of david s phone 
yeah  i paid for a
reverse directory thing
to look the number up online 
it said it was this unlisted
landline of a doctor in miami 
his name s peter boddington 
except he s not a doctor anymore 
he lost his license two years ago
after performing a face lift on
a woman while he was drunk 
so  david knows the guy  i mean 
maybe it s his uncle or something 
that s what i m trying to figure out 
i need to talk to the police 
the cops found those
drugs in zeke s room 
so they think they ve got their guy 
so  what do you need me to do 
get any information you can on this guy 
do you really think david
killed craig and that other guy 
yeah  i do 
okay  i ll see if i can find anything 
thank you  luke 
i m sorry  i ll show you some
magic tricks later  just   
  hey  faggot 
  oh  whoa 
hey  what s that you re looking at 
are you looking for someone to
do your sex change operation 
you little fucking bitch   
that s right  bitches 
god damn it 
  are you okay 
  i m fine 
  mrs  peterson 
  yes  that s right 
mr  alston will see you now 
please  step inside 
  okay 
  just a second 
what happened 
this kid called me a faggot 
so i 
broke a yardstick on his face 
okay 
awesome 
i ll go in with you 
okay 
  is it this way 
  yes 
due to our school s zero
tolerance policy on violence 
i m afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son 
that s pending the
decision of the board 
but i m afraid it s fairly certain 
  but   
  i m sorry 
what did the kid call him 
what 
you know  the kid 
the one luke hit in the face 
what did he call luke 
i don t think that s relevant
to this conversation 
did he call him a faggot 
i believe that s the word that
was used  yes  but that s no excuse   
so  that makes it a hate crime 
  what 
  a hate crime 
and i d like to know how many others
have been perpetrated against
her son under your watch 
a gay student targeted with physical
violence finally defends himself 
and you re    what 
suspending him 
we could consider suspension 
no  you couldn t 
i ll be interested to see
what the board makes of you
when this is in front of the entire country 
not to mention our lawyers 
do you want to sue them 
i    i don t   
we re suing you and the school board 
i didn t even know he was gay 
what about after school detention 
for how long 
a month 
that seems fair 
after school detention 
we ll put him to work
helping the prom committee
set up for the halloween dance 
we ll agree to that 
but i do not want to
hear anything further
about this young man being harassed 
we understand each other 
i believe we do  mr   
who are you 
i m a friend of the family 
after school detention for a month 
  that s it 
  yeah 
  see you later 
  oh  david 
can i talk to you for a second 
i m going to step out into the hall
with luke for a moment  if that s okay 
oh  certainly 
so  she thinks you killed craig 
and she s trying to make a case to the
police so they ll let her boyfriend go 
  anna told you all this 
  yeah 
do you think i killed craig 
i don t care 
but that s why
she wanted me to check out
that plastic surgeon in florida 
she wanted to know what
the connection was there 
yeah  i mean  why would i
need a plastic surgeon  right 
to change your appearance 
like  the bones in your face 
and maybe scar up your fingers
so you don t have prints 
i mean  at least that s what i figured 
i know you re not really david collins 
i looked him up right
after anna said that 
so  maybe you don t want
people to know who you are 
a doctor who would do that sort
of thing is probably pretty rare 
i mean  there s probably
rules against it 
but that doctor  well 
i guess he needs the money 
so he d do that kind of work 
that s an interesting theory 
i m not going to tell anyone about it 
and nobody will believe anna 
she doesn t have anything against you 
you killed dad s boss  too  right 
i don t care  i m not
going say anything 
why not 
because we re friends 
right 
yeah  of course we are 
okay 
i just wanted you to know 
did anna tell anyone else about this 
i don t know 
her friend  kristen  maybe 
okay 
thank you 
you know  david  i really   
i wanna thank you 
i don t know what i would have
done if you hadn t been here 
and i don t    i don t
mean just for today 
i mean everything 
i am    i m really grateful 
really  mrs  peterson  it s no problem 
i ll go get the rest 
thank you  david 
excuse me  ma am  are you anna peterson 
no  no  she s working at the diner 
i m her mother 
what s she    did she do something 
no  it s fine  ma am 
but your daughter 
she put in a call to fort kennilworth
a couple of days ago asking
about a man named david collins 
yes  oh  that s right  she did 
you wouldn t happen to have seen
anyone resembling this man  would you 
this is    david 
ma am  when was the
last time you saw him 
well  he just went inside 
no 
stop the girl  get back here 
get him 
oh  shit 
  no  no  no  no 
  david  what   
what is happening  david 
who are those men 
i really am sorry about this 
mrs  peterson 
i m afraid i haven t been
fully honest with you 
what do you mean 
it would take too long to explain 
i wanted to help 
i considered it my mission to
assist you all while i was here 
there were just too many complications 
what are you talking about 
david  why are those men
trying to kill you 
it doesn t matter 
did you   
did you even know my son 
i did 
yes 
we were in the same program 
and he would understand
what i have to do here 
he s here in the   
i m sorry 
i m going in 
give me 15 seconds of cover  then hold 
fuck 
fuck 
what the   
whoa  whoa  whoa 
david 
i m really sorry about this  sir 
i think he s dead 
military police 
i m gonna need your vehicle 
what 
  are the keys in it 
  yes  but   
excuse me  are you anna peterson 
yes 
my name is major carver 
military police  i need you
to come with me  please 
okay  what s going on 
it s about david  miss peterson 
he is not who you think he is 
and we need to go now 
okay 
is everything all right 
i think so  i ll call you later  okay 
miss peterson 
  hey 
  hey 
is anna working 
she just left 
oh  yeah 
where was she going 
i m not sure exactly 
to pick up luke 
i think that she s going   
never mind 
what 
okay  copy  we re on our way 
what 
we re going to the rec
center to get your brother 
the police couldn t send a car there 
they ve got their hands full 
okay  you need to tell
me what s going on 
who are you 
what  you came here for david 
yes 
the soldier you know as david
was one of the subjects
of a medical experiment 
while we had him under study 
he killed several people and escaped 
then he burned their
bodies to confuse us 
we thought he d died
in the fire initially 
by the time we figured out what
he d done  the trail was cold 
maybe you shouldn t have tested
your procedures on a psychopath 
by all accounts 
he was an ideal soldier 
i don t know 
i need to call my brother 
mr  peterson  is that a cell phone 
didn t i say   phones off  
hand it over 
you can have it back after detention 
luke  i need you to call
me when you get this 
okay  it s important 
where are those cop cars going 
somebody attacked your
diner right after we left it 
it was called in as an explosion 
is anyone alive 
i don t know 
it s possible that he d leave
some wounded to keep them busy 
wait  where are my parents 
you haven t said anything
about my parents 
they re both dead 
he killed them before we could stop him 
i m sorry 
no 
david has neurological conditioning 
miss peterson 
designed to protect both
him and the experiment 
if he feels like his
identity may be compromised 
he s programmed to
clean up all loose ends 
i doubt he could stop himself
now even if he wanted to 
it s why we need to get you and
your brother somewhere safe 
miss peterson  we need to go 
miss peterson 
yeah  let s go get my brother 
what the hell is this 
for the fall dance  they do
this halloween maze thing 
stay close to me 
god damn it  what in the hell
