ill see you later
okay
drive safe
bye mom
you got your lunch
yeah
mrs peterson
yes can i help you
my name is david
mrs peterson
i
i knew your son caleb
we trained together and served together
and well we came to be good friends
would you like to come inside
thank you maam
so are you sure i cant
get you anything
maybe just some water would be nice
how did you get here
i ran
i needed the exercise
from the bus station i mean in town
you ran that whole way
yes maam
here you go
all right thank you maam
when did you get out
well i was discharged on wednesday
and i came straight here
from fort kennilworth
you came straight here first thing
yeah i wanted to come by sooner
but i couldnt get leave
why
well i was discharged
cause i was wounded
i was in a military hospital for a bit
so it wasnt really the kind of
thing you could get leave from
but dont worry it was just
a bit of shrapnel in my back
im right as rain now
no i meant why did
you come here first thing
well like i said me and
your son caleb we were
we were pretty close
i was with him when he died
really
yes maam
and one of the things he asked
was for me to check on you all
you and your whole family here
he wanted me to tell
you that he loved you
he specifically wanted me
to tell each one of you that
he loved you and he was thinking
of you guys up until the end
i said id do that and so here i am
would you excuse me please
thats me
right there
well ill be
i remember that day
it wasnt my intention
to upset you maam
i probably should have called first
but i dont own a cell phone yet and
i guess i just wasnt thinking
im going to be on my way now
but id like it if we
could exchange emails
wait no
anna calebs sister she works
nights and she sleeps late
and i know she would love to meet you
would you stay a little while longer
oh youre not just saying
that to be polite now
cause you dont need to be
no im not please stay its
its nice having you here
and i would love to hear
more about you and caleb
well all right
caleb and me we figure that sounds
more like a challenge
than anything else
so that night after he falls asleep
we kind of crept over to his
cot with a tube of superglue
oh no
we didnt do anything too bad to him
though we could have you know
hey there you are anna this is david
very nice to meet you
caleb told me a lot about you
david just got discharged this week
he was a friend of your brothers
you knew caleb
yes maam
yes maam
okay
so where are you staying
well i noticed a motel off the
highway on the way here
no no no no you will stay
with us while youre here
oh no i couldnt put you all out
nonsense we would love to have you
we have plenty of room
in fact you can stay
in calebs old room
we insist
well i wont argue
just for tonight though
well ive got to head to the diner

if you need anything just holler
oh my god
fucking pussy
oh my god
oh its okay little baby dont cry
hey there
how was your day
it was good
great
giving him a chance
its that i dont like the idea of
some random guy off the
street being invited to stay
in my house with my family
so you knew my brother
i did pretty well yeah
he wanted me to tell
you that he loved you
oh thanks
even though he says he
was friends with caleb
hes in the photograph of calebs squad
you saw the photograph
he was not a stranger
you know what
what if he has the ptsd
or whatever its called
some of these guys come back with
mental health problems laura
did you take that into account
what if caleb had come back different
did you take that into account
wow that is
your parents are fighting about me
yeah they argue a lot
you look like you got hit or something

a football in gym class
yeah that can happen
yeah

lets get started
lets start with this
i mean its a standard beretta
im sure youre familiar with it
in my opinion if youve seen one
of these youve seen them all
but this baby this here is
a 9millimeter witness elite
its a very similar weapon to
the beretta but i prefer the recoil
i mean its got
absolutely no kick at all
you army
yes sir
im navy myself
yeah thats fine
you want the elite
oh ill take em all
all the handguns
no everything all your guns
shit
thats what i was thinking
look man if youve brought
money for all of them
ill cut you a deal
you can take em all off my hands
no im going to kill you
hey what the fuck david
now you listen to me
one fucking second
wait wait wait
no no no no
hello

hey mom can i talk
to you for a second

what why would you do that
spencer
i need a drink
why what happened
im getting a drink honey
they found allan
you know my boss allan
hed been missing from
work for a couple of days
everybody got very worried
so one of his friends went
over and broke into his house
and they found him
and his girlfriend dead
theyd both taken a bunch
of prescription pills
it was like they committed
suicide together or something
oh my god
but that doesnt make any sense
he was
no the guy was totally normal
but the police are investigating
you know its
doesnt look like it was a breakin
there was no forced entries
she the girl she had
she had bruises on her body
i dont know what that means
anyway we will leave it for the police
to tell us exactly what happened
i dont know
damn thing is this makes
me regional manager
yeah as soon as corporate
found out they called me
right away they want
me to start tomorrow
and theyre offering me allans salary
so
well thats
yeah
careful what you wish for
david

they just found him out at the quarry
hes dead someone shot him

do they know who did it
i dont really have all the details yet

yeah of course
theres something else i
need to talk to you about
what is it
oh shit fuck
babe i got to go all right
ill call you back
hello
i just heard from zeke
how are you doing
i just dont get it
whod want to hurt craig
yeah i know can you
sit down for a second
yeah
so how does this work again
first you make a hole at the top
so you can reach in and
scoop all the guts out
oh man
your parents knives suck
yeah
thats better
do you carry that with you
like all the time
oh this thing sure
why
i dont know
just in case
i called the army base that
david said that he was from
they told me that david
collins died a week ago
he was in some military
hospital in arizona
there was a fire from oxygen tanks
about 20 people died
david collins was one of them
does david have any id credit cards
ive never seen him use a wallet
what about his phone
he has a burner right
why dont you check some
of the numbers hes called
your brother knows computers
have him look some of them up
yeah thats a good idea
hey kristen i think that
couples been done for a bit
ive got it thanks
call me after work okay
take care of yourself
you too
do you want some advice luke
sure
never let anyone pick on you
otherwise youll carry it with
you the rest of your life
those kids at school
theyre bigger than you
yeah
then bring a knife to school
if they take it off of
you and beat you up
you go around their houses at night
and burn them down with
their families inside
whats the worst they can do
yeah okay
here you keep it
youre giving this to me
yeah man its yours ive got others
thanks
hey
mom and dad around
no they went to the store
your moms making pumpkin pie
thats cool
shit
fuck
fuck
oh my god
hello
hey its me
hey
what
they found the gun that
killed craig in your van
yeah it was wiped clean
i guess they just got an
anonymous tip or something
but youre innocent
anna i know but
then they searched my room
and they found some
other stuff you know
so it looks like im actually
gonna be here for a little while
i love you all right
yeah i know i gotta go
okay
love you bye
honey you okay
i
my friend craig was killed today
oh my god im so sorry
how what happened
he was shot i dont know
and they arrested zeke for it
zeke
im sorry honey
but if they arrested your exboyfriend
it was probably for a very good reason
we all know zeke was never
exactly a pillar of this community
hes not my exboyfriend
dad hes my boyfriend
i never stopped seeing him
im 20 years old i can date who i want
as long as you live in
this house you cannot
oh you know nothing about him nothing
i know hes a druggedout punk junkie
really dad
who started dating my daughter
when she was 17 years old
is what i know
right
what about him
everybodys best friend
i called the military base
that he said he was from
and they told me he was dead
thats military intelligence for you
right ask to see his id
hes not david collins okay
we dont know who he is
i was part of a special forces
unit when i was injured
so they should be
providing a cover story
if any civilians ask about me
thats a good thing
but i did get my dog tags back
theyre right here
i dont like to wear them because
well i dont know but
i like having them with me
though you know
as for id i dont have
a current license
but ive got my documents
in my bag should i go
no no no that wont be necessary
anna peterson
you owe him an apology right now
no fucking way
you watch your mouth young lady
i am very sorry about your friend craig
thats a terrible thing that happened
as far as it goes with zeke
hastings and his crew
i have it on very good authority theyre
nothing but a bunch of pot dealers
you wanna know why zeke
was arrested for murder
because he probably did it thats why
fuck you
spencer
hey now anna
im sorry honey
david im terribly sorry
no thats okay
shes shes upset
i probably should have explained
the special forces thing earlier
its just were not really
supposed to talk about it
no i understand
i could use a drink
how about you david
yes please
what
hey
i just wanted to say
i just wanted to say how
sorry i am about craig
he seemed like a really cool guy
and zeke getting arrested
again im very sorry
i know you dont need me
here at this stressful time
im not helping which is a shame
because i promised caleb i would do
anything i could to help your family
but just so you know ill be
moving on in a couple of days
so you dont need to put up
with me much longer okay
okay
okay
good
what is this
is this the cd you made me
yeah
is it done
yeah
well thank you
i cant wait to listen to it
i want every contractor
within a 100mile radius
and i dont care where they come from
kpg exmilitary whatever
ill need a team mobilized
by the time i land
ill give them the necessary
mission specs in person
we cant risk a leak on this
good luck
you took a picture of davids phone
yeah i paid for a
reverse directory thing
to look the number up online
it said it was this unlisted
landline of a doctor in miami
his names peter boddington
except hes not a doctor anymore
he lost his license two years ago
after performing a face lift on
a woman while he was drunk
so david knows the guy i mean
maybe its his uncle or something
thats what im trying to figure out
i need to talk to the police
the cops found those
drugs in zekes room
so they think theyve got their guy
so what do you need me to do
get any information you can on this guy
do you really think david
killed craig and that other guy
yeah i do
okay ill see if i can find anything
thank you luke
im sorry ill show you some
magic tricks later just
hey faggot
oh whoa
hey whats that youre looking at
are you looking for someone to
do your sex change operation
you little fucking bitch
thats right bitches
god damn it
are you okay
im fine
mrs peterson
yes thats right
mr alston will see you now
please step inside
okay
just a second
what happened
this kid called me a faggot
so i
broke a yardstick on his face
okay
awesome
ill go in with you
okay
is it this way
yes
due to our schools zero
tolerance policy on violence
im afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son
thats pending the
decision of the board
but im afraid its fairly certain
but
im sorry
what did the kid call him
what
you know the kid
the one luke hit in the face
what did he call luke
i dont think thats relevant
to this conversation
did he call him a faggot
i believe thats the word that
was used yes but thats no excuse
so that makes it a hate crime
what
a hate crime
and id like to know how many others
have been perpetrated against
her son under your watch
a gay student targeted with physical
violence finally defends himself
and youre what
suspending him
we could consider suspension
no you couldnt
ill be interested to see
what the board makes of you
when this is in front of the entire country
not to mention our lawyers
do you want to sue them
i i dont
were suing you and the school board
i didnt even know he was gay
what about afterschool detention
for how long
a month
that seems fair
afterschool detention
well put him to work
helping the prom committee
set up for the halloween dance
well agree to that
but i do not want to
hear anything further
about this young man being harassed
we understand each other
i believe we do mr
who are you
im a friend of the family
afterschool detention for a month
thats it
yeah
see you later
oh david
can i talk to you for a second
im going to step out into the hall
with luke for a moment if thats okay
oh certainly
so she thinks you killed craig
and shes trying to make a case to the
police so theyll let her boyfriend go
anna told you all this
yeah
do you think i killed craig
i dont care
but thats why
she wanted me to check out
that plastic surgeon in florida
she wanted to know what
the connection was there
yeah i mean why would i
need a plastic surgeon right
to change your appearance
like the bones in your face
and maybe scar up your fingers
so you dont have prints
i mean at least thats what i figured
i know youre not really david collins
i looked him up right
after anna said that
so maybe you dont want
people to know who you are
a doctor who would do that sort
of thing is probably pretty rare
i mean theres probably
rules against it
but that doctor well
i guess he needs the money
so hed do that kind of work
thats an interesting theory
im not going to tell anyone about it
and nobody will believe anna
she doesnt have anything against you
you killed dads boss too right
i dont care im not
going say anything
why not
because were friends
right
yeah of course we are
okay
i just wanted you to know
did anna tell anyone else about this
i dont know
her friend kristen maybe
okay
thank you
you know david i really
i wanna thank you
i dont know what i would have
done if you hadnt been here
and i dont i dont
mean just for today
i mean everything
i am im really grateful
really mrs peterson its no problem
ill go get the rest
thank you david
excuse me maam are you anna peterson
no no shes working at the diner
im her mother
whats she did she do something

david why are those men
trying to kill you
it doesnt matter

miss peterson
hey
hey
is anna working
she just left
oh yeah
where was she going
im not sure exactly
to pick up luke
i think that shes going
never mind
what
okay copy were on our way
what
were going to the rec
center to get your brother
the police couldnt send a car there
theyve got their hands full
okay you need to tell
me whats going on
who are you
what you came here for david
yes
the soldier you know as david
was one of the subjects
of a medical experiment
while we had him under study
he killed several people and escaped
then he burned their
bodies to confuse us
we thought hed died
in the fire initially
by the time we figured out what
hed done the trail was cold
maybe you shouldnt have tested
your procedures on a psychopath
by all accounts
he was an ideal soldier
i dont know
i need to call my brother
mr peterson is that a cell phone
didnt i say phones off
hand it over
you can have it back after detention
luke i need you to call
me when you get this
okay its important
where are those cop cars going
somebody attacked your
diner right after we left it
it was called in as an explosion
is anyone alive
i dont know
its possible that hed leave
some wounded to keep them busy
wait where are my parents
you havent said anything
about my parents
theyre both dead
he killed them before we could stop him
im sorry
no
david has neurological conditioning
miss peterson
designed to protect both
him and the experiment
if he feels like his
identity may be compromised
hes programmed to
clean up all loose ends
i doubt he could stop himself
now even if he wanted to
its why we need to get you and
your brother somewhere safe
miss peterson we need to go
miss peterson
yeah lets go get my brother
