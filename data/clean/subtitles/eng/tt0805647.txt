now i remember 
 a note about witches  
see  here s the thing
about them 
they re real 
witches are as real as a rock
in your shoe 
that s the first thing
you need to know 
the second thing
you need to know 
they re here 
and they live amongst us   
   side by side  with humans 
in every big city 
in every small town 
for all you know 
a witch might be living right
next door to you right now 
they everywhere 
a witch might be a nurse 
or your teacher 
and you can bet
your sweet patootie
that friendly  little old lady
on the bus
offering you a delicious piece
of salt water taffy
is a witch 
and here s
the most important thing 
the most important thing 
witches hate children 
a witch spends all her time
thinking up ways
to destroy children 
that s all she thinks about 
 how will i squish
this horrible child  
a witch gets the same pleasure
from squishing a child
as you get from eating
a bowl of ice cream
covered in butterscotch syrup 
with whipped cream 
chopped nuts 
and a cherry on top 
my story begins
during the last month of 1968 
believe it or not 
i was once a young boy 
a boy with a mother
and a father 
we lived in chicago 
and it snows a lot
at christmastime

i m gonna make you a plate 
  now if you
feel that you can t go on  
  because all of your hope
is gone  
  and your life is filled
with much confusion  
  until happiness
is just an illusion  
  and your world around
is tumblin  down  
  darlin

don t feel like eating 
and i don t feel like wasting
all this good food 
what  you think i m supposed
to feel sorry for you 
well  i don t 
do i feel bad 
yeah 
but not sorry 
sometimes  whatever the good
lord needs to teach us
comes in ways we don t see 
but it doesn t mean
we re not supposed
to learn something 
look here 
this was my baby 
i d do anything
for her to be here right now 
but the man above
had another plan for her 
and whether it seems fair
to me or not 
it doesn t matter 
sometimes life isn t fair 
it s a hard lesson
for folks to learn
and most people don t have to
learn it this young 
but you do 
you hear me 
come on now  baby 
you got to eat something 
you like cake 
well  corn bread
is basically cake 
mmm hmm 
go on  try it 
what s his name 
it s a she 
her name is something
you can ponder 
have you come up with a name
for your mouse yet 
uh huh 
well  tell me 
don t be keeping me in suspense 
aisy 
lazy 
well  that mouse
is full of nothing but energy 
she runs all the time
in that wheel 
not  lazy  
daisy 
 daisy   oh 
i like it 
that s a perfect name for her 
close your eyes  honey 
  it s your thing
do what you wanna do  
  i can t tell you
who to sock it to  
  it s your thing  
  do what you wanna do  
  i can t tell you
who to sock it to  
and somehow  she did it 
little by little 
with a tug here
and a pull there 
she brought me
out of my sadness 
  oh  you need love now  
  just as bad as i do  
but even though
my own darkness
was being lifted 
there was another dark shadow
looming nearby 
very nearby 
i didn t know it 
but i was about to meet
my first witch 
curses 
  all right  
  lord have mercy   
raymond 
raymond 
you call these fresh 
but we just got them in 
when  last year 
look at how yellow they are 
and those brown spots
around the edges 
i m not gonna waste
good bacon drippings
on these shriveled up weeds 
can you get me some fresh greens
if you don t mind 
yes  ma am 
i ll see what we have
in the back 
you do that 
grandma  can i get these nails
to make daisy a house 
hmm 
well  these aren t galvanized 
you have to use galvanized nails
so they won t rust 
but galvanized costs
 35 cents more 
safety first 
yes  ma am 
you cut yourself
on a rusty nail 
you can get lockjaw 
yes  ma am 
and then i d have to
flush out your system
with liver oil  garlic juice 
tabasco sauce 
you wouldn t want to go
through that now  would you 
no  ma am 
good 
remember  safety first 
grandma knew how
to fix all kinds of ailments 
she learned from her grandma
how to use herbs and potions
and strange incantations
to make sick people good as new 
here in alabama 
where she grew up 
grandma was known as a healer 
galvanized 
boy 
boy 
do you like sweets 
she is tame 
very sweet 
give her a kiss 
young man 
you want those nails 
you better come on   
yes  raymond 
that s more like it 
grandma 
i need to tell you something 
not now  son 
but  grandma   
i thought
you wanted those nails 
forget it  let s just go 
yeah 
let s just go 
hey 
son 
what were you trying to tell me
in the grocery store
this morning 
you were shaking like a leaf 
don t worry about that  grandma 
i just want you to feel better 
i feel fine 
you just tell me
what you were trying to say 
looked like you were about
to have a conniption fit 
i don t know what i saw 
it was a scary lady 
she called to me 
but when she did 
when she talked 
her mouth   
was she wearing gloves 
long ones  up to her elbows 
was she wearing a hat 
it looked like she had a towel
on her head or something 
and when she talked 
did her voice
sound ugly and scratchy
like an outhouse door
swinging on a rusty hinge 
oh 
i feared this was happening 
that lady you saw in
the grocery store was no lady 
what you saw
was a witch 
a witch 
that s right 
a no good  rotten  low down 
sneaky  sneaky witch 
okay  okay 
is this you
and your church friends
trying to play a joke on me 
 cause if it is 
it s not very funny 
listen  child 
witches ain t nothing
to joke about 
i ve known children
who no longer exist
as children on this earth 
they were turned 
transformed 
taken by witches 
i can tell you about alice blue 
well  alice blue and i
were best friends 
we lived across the street
from each other 
we were like sisters 
inseparable 
we did everything together 
even our chores 
but alice was a lollygagger 
alice  quit lollygagging  girl 
it s almost suppertime 
alice did something
no child should ever do 
she took candy from a stranger 
i got so scared 
i tore out of there
like greased lightning 
and hightailed it straight home 
i never should have
left alice alone 
i knew i shouldn t have 
but i was so scared 
later that night 
when i saw alice alive 
i was as happy as a mouse
in a bucket of cheese 
but the very next morning 
all that happiness went away
because it happened 
she started turning 
alice was chicken afied 
chicken alified 
lordy 
look at the size
of that chicken 
y all seen
where alice run off to 
she s right   
there 
what you
talking about  child 
where d she go 
i tried to explain
what i saw 
but everybody was looking
at me like i was crazy 
finally 
i just shut up about it 
although  i made it a point
to visit alice
in her coop every day 
hi  alice 
alice even laid eggs 
big green ones 
biggest green eggs i ever seen 
people said they were delicious 
what about the witch 
what about her 
did she go away 
oh  my  no 
once a witch come
into your life  it never   
never   
oh  my  lord in heaven 
what am i thinking 
i just told you
we saw a witch today 
a witch in the grocery store 
and what am i doing 
sitting here
like i m blind in one eye
and can t see out the other 
wasting precious time
lollygagging 
always wondered
what grandma kept
in that locked closet 
turns out it was full of
medicinal herbs and elixirs 
and old books
about ancient healing 
now  my mom always said
grandma was sort of
a country type healer 
but now i was starting to think
she might be a voodoo priestess 
child  we need to leave 
  leave 
  that s right  leave 
it s not safe for us here 
but where we gonna go 
i ll call my cousin  eston 
have him make
a reservation for us
at the grand orleans
imperial island hotel 
he was the executive chef
there for over 30 years 
he s got pull there 
he s a star 
his cooking
put that hotel on the map 
it s the swankiest resort
in all of alabama 
you ll be telling your grandkids
about your stay in this hotel 
how do you know
we ll be safe there 
because  child 
ain t nothing
but rich white folks
at the grand orleans
imperial island hotel 
and witches
only prey on the poor 
the overlooked 
the kids they think
nobody s gonna make a fuss
about if they go missing 
go pack 
grandma  are there
witches in every city 
every city 
every state  every country 
and there s
a secret society of witches
in every country called a coven 
that s just like a rotary club
but for witches 
they all get together
in one place
and gossip about
who they put spells on 
or trade potion secrets 
and whatnot 
but most important 
they receive orders
from the grand high witch 
the grand high witch 
the grand high witch  yeah 
she s the ruler of them all 
all powerful  pure evil 
and without a stitch of mercy 
yeah  legend has it 
she was hatched
on the frozen tundra of norway 
now  take a look at that 
what  you just gonna stand there
and stare at me all day 
can i help you 
you can unload this car while
i check in to this here hotel 
yes  ma am 
here s the key 
oh  and   
no 
you keep your money  ma am 
and enjoy yourself 
i think i will 
grandma was right
about this hotel 
it sure was fancy 
she brought us
to the gulf of mexico
to get away from that witch 
but she had no idea what
we were about to step into 
be careful with the mouse 
  no 
  for god s sake 
i think you re being
extremely unreasonable 
no  deidre 
for the last time 
i will not have that woman
in my house 
oh 
she s very good company 
absolutely not  deidre 
oh  for god s sake 
bruno  your face 
obviously can t
take you anywhere 
here you are  ma am 
come on  we got our key 
we are in room 766 
sounds like a good room 
you okay  grandma 
that s the first time
you coughed
since we left the house 
can i help you  madam 
oh  you must be
eston s cousins 
yes  he insisted
that you stay in room 766 
that s the magnolia 
this is one of
our most lovely junior suites 
and aren t you
a lucky fella  hmm 
it s not every day
that a young gentleman
such as yourself is fortunate
to come and stay in such
a fine hotel as this now 
is it 
come on  gatsby 
let s go 
let s go find our room 
would you like me to show you 
  it s on the fourth floor 
  mmm 
grandma 
if we re on the fourth floor 
why is it number 7 6 6 
because the man who built
this hotel was a numerologist 
he believed
numbers have meaning 
i know a little something
about numbers 
seven and six together
means a test is coming 
two sixes mean abundance 
so  it look like
a big test might be coming 
well  hello there 
the grand orleans
imperial island hotel
welcomes you and your lovely
group of benefactresses 
uh  i would just like to say
that we applaud
your innumerable 
uh  philanthropic   
acts and  um   
and  um   
i m sorry  madam 
but the hotel has
a very strict no pet policy 
you seem like the sort of man
who loves a precious 
don t you  mister   
stringer  r  j  stringer iii 
hotel manager 
thank you
for making an exception 
  mr  r  j  the hotel manager 
  stringer 
yes  but i haven t yet   
but i didn t agree   
so  tell me something  mister   
  stringy 
  stringer 
hotel man 
  manager 
  the third 
  yeah 
  i know you love kitties 
but what do you think of   
mice 
mice 
yeah  mice 
what would you do
if there were mice
running all around
in this hotel 
well  i can assure you  madam 
there would never be any mice   
but if there were 
hypothetically 
mmm  oh  hypothetically 
yes  i suppose 
well  i would  uh   
i would call the exterminator 
exactly 
you see  girls 
he would call the exterminator 
just like any normal human
with his head screwed on right 
he would exterminate
those brats 
uh    rats 
we would exterminate the rats 
evil 
there s no other way
to describe them 
pure  unvarnished evil 
that s what witches are 
now  you see
this here cough of mine 
it was likely brought on
by a witch 
probably that one you saw
in the grocery store 
really  a witch
can make you cough 
oh  you bet
your sweet patootie they can 
grandma  how can you tell
a real witch from
well  first of all  witches
aren t really women at all 
they re demons in human shape 
that s why if you look closely
at a witch 
you ll notice the corners
of her mouth is elongated 
stretching almost
up to her ears 
and that s usually hidden
with pancake makeup 
and a real witch always
wears gloves  always 
because a real witch
doesn t have hands 
she s got claws 
claws 
and they don t have toes  ooh 
their ugly feet look like
their toes got chopped off
with an axe 
and all witches are bald 
as bald as a boiled egg 
so  they wear wigs 
and it gives them nasty sores 
 wig rash   the witches call it 
mmm  and it makes them crazy 
so  gloves 
wigs 
is that everything 
nose holes 
  nose holes 
  yeah  nostrils 
nose holes 
witches have larger nose holes
than normal people 
when they need
to sniff out a child 
those nose holes can grow out
as big as eight inches
in diameter 
but  mind you  children
smell horrible to witches 
even if the kid
just had a bath 
that makes it worse 
a freshly clean kid smells
like dog poop to a witch 
  dog poop 
  that s right 
and the cleaner the kid 
the poopier he smells
to a witch 
maybe i should
stop taking baths 
child  don t test me 
can a witch come in here
and get us while we sleep 
no 
not at all 
witches never do
silly things like
climbing drainpipes or
breaking into people s houses 
besides  they have no idea
where we are 
okay  but i m still
a little scared 
over here  come on  little man 
there we go 
get some sleep 
hmm 
really 
mmm 
the next morning 
the sun was shining
and the air was crisp
i kept quiet as a mouse
so grandma could sleep in 
and i took it upon myself
to order her
some room service breakfast 
mmm  mmm  mmm 
here s your breakfast  grandma 
scrambled eggs 
chicken fried steak 
hominy grits  pecan sticky buns 
rhubarb strawberry jam 
and a pitcher
of sweet iced tea with mint 
oh  that sure smells special 
oh  mercy  i slept in late 
phew 
well  thank you for ordering
me breakfast  darling 
i gave the room service guy
a half a dollar tip 
was that okay 
that s mighty
gentlemanly of you 
grandma  are you okay 
i m fine 
just a little tickle 
grab grandma
that glass of tea 
and listen  grandma s gonna
take it easy today 
but i want you to get outside
and run around 
go down to the water 
have fun 
i was thinking i would do
some training with daisy 
oh  well  take her with 
just don t let her get
too close to the water 
i wouldn t want
some big old sea snake
to grab ahold of her 
sea snake 
i m just joshing 
there ain t no sea snakes 
you go on now  have fun 
and don t worry about me 
i m fine 
even though i knew
grandma was kidding
about the sea snakes 
i didn t wanna take any chances 
so we stayed inside 
and wouldn t you know 
we came upon the big ballroom
where it turns out
the international society
for the prevention of cruelty
to children folks
were gonna have
their conference 
hey 
you there 
and what are you doing 
breaking and entering 
looking for a quiet spot 
for what 
training 
training what 
cool  super 
what s his name 
it s a she 
and her name is daisy 
can i hold her 
she s not too comfortable
around strangers 
can she do any tricks
or anything 
we were just about
to do some training 
wanna watch 
what time is it 
a nice lady told me
to meet her here at 12 25 
she said she would give me
six bars of swiss chocolate 
what s your name 
i m   
bruno jenkins 
i ve been looking for you
everywhere  young man 
your father is furious 
hello  mother 
this is my new friend 
nice to meet you 
look at your hands 
they re filthy 
look at your shirt 
it s a complete mess 
  come with me 
  ow 
what have you been doing 
running around
in a sausage factory 
the room
was completely empty 
a perfect place for me
and daisy to do our training 
and i figured 
if all the prevention
of cruelty to children people
showed up 
they would probably look kindly
on a young mouse trainer
who was just
going about his business 
jeez  that scared
the crap out of me 
so  here we are 
here is the le grand
imperial ballroom
or le salon grande 
as we call it 
well  actually
we call it the mural room
because of all these
beautiful murals   
i was told there is only
one door in and out  yeah 
yeah  yes 
there s  uh  only that door
there  in and out 
and which  of course 
does not make
the fire marshal very happy 
so  don t you go
starting any fires 
this room will do 
right  so   
yeah  so  if there s any   
is there anything else
  that you ladies   
  no 
  no 
  bye bye 
oh  all right 
saoirse 
secure the room 
okay  you so called ladies 
prepare for removal 
wake up 
okay  you trussed up succubines 
you may remove your gloves 
you may remove your shoes 
and   
you may remove your wigs 
they re all witches 
my blood ran cold
as i started to get real scared 
here i was 
trapped in a room with a bunch
of bald headed witches 
and the mean one 
the bald head honcho
who was standing right above me 
the one who was
giving all the orders 
as soon as i got
a good look at her 
i knew instantly
who she had to be 
she s the grand high witch 
witches 
witches 
you are a heap
of good for nothing worms 
this morning 
i m having my breakfast
and i m looking out
the window  at the beach 
and what am i seeing  hmm 
what am i seeing 
i m seeing dozens   
i m seeing hundreds   
i m seeing hundreds
of repulsive little brats
playing in the sand 
and it s putting me
right off my food 
so   
here are my orders 
i want every child
in the world   
rubbed out 
squashed  squirted 
and frittered 
your excellency

wipe out every child

a good question 
insubordinate
but a good question 
of course i have a plan 
i want each of you to return
to your pathetic little town 
and open   
a candy store 
and in this store you will sell
only the highest quality

filled with brand new 
crisp  100 bills

tastiest candy

little brat in 30 minutes 
and three drops

and proper 
it s been an awful day 
  anybody else hungry 
  ahem 
oh  and daisy used to be
a kid    a girl too 
why didn t you
say something before  darling 
because it can be very dangerous
for a mouse to talk 
most people don t understand
and they get scared 
i almost said something
the other night
when you told the story
about alice blue
getting turned into a chicken 
but i thought better of it 
so  some wicked  evil witch
mouse afied you 
yes  ma am  four months ago 
on the very same afternoon
i ran away from the orphanage 
well  what happened was 
a kind lady   
well  i thought she was kind 
anyway  she offered me
a chocolate bar 
and before i knew it  poof 
i was transformed 
then  faster than a hot knife
cuts through butter 
a panhandler scoops me up
and sells me to a pet store
so he could buy food 
yum 
i m so sorry  daisy 
mary  uh  my real name
is mary 
mary  that s a pretty name 
excuse me 
all this talk about food
is making me really hungry 
can i have one of those grapes 
so  it was
the grand high witch 
and she s in this very hotel 
we got to do something to turn
you back  make this right 
the grand high witch
has a room full of potion 
and she s gonna use it
to turn every kid in the world
into a mouse 
we have to help them 
  who is it 
  hotel maintenance 
quick  hide 
here  hop in my knitting tote 
keep your heads down 
yes 
i m sorry to bother you  ma am 
but we got a report of
a possible rodent infestation 
rodent infestation 
in a hotel this expensive 
that s crazier than
a hog on slaughter day 
yes  ma am 
it s probably nothing 
the maid who said
she saw the rodents
has a tendency to be
a bit high strung 
  mmm 
  but  to be on the safe side 
i thought
i d lay these here traps 
  if you don t mind 
  okay 
  we put them in all the rooms 
  mmm hmm 
just to be safe 
so  uh  what are they  mice 
oh  no  ma am 
maid said she saw
a swarm of huge  ugly rats 
at least a dozen of them 
goodness  a dozen 
well  it s like i said 
she has a tendency to be
a bit high strung 
fresh wisconsin cheddar 
drives them rodents plumb crazy 
they can t resist it 
mmm   
anyway  you hear any
of these traps start snapping 
give me a call 
i sure will 
that s right 
don t you know anything 
grapes can hurt a mouse 
all right  you three 
you stay away from
those traps  you hear 
if we could just get our hands
on some of that potion 
i might be able
to reverse engineer it 
make it a potion
that turns mice into children 
i always travel with
my anti hex herbs and salts 
but whoever knows where
that wicked  evil witch is 
we do  she s in room 666 
we heard her tell
all those witches
to meet her in room 666
right after dinner 
and we re in room 766 
room 666 is right below us 
good lord 
that evil sorceress is living
right beneath us 
yes  and here s what we do 
we wait for the grand high
witch to leave her room 
then we use
grandma s knitting wool
as a rope to lower me down
to the grand high witch s
balcony 
i grab a bottle of potion 
grandma hoists me back up 
she reverses the spell 
and ta da 
we re kids again 
young man  you think
all that up just now 
popped right into my head 
vile  filthy brats 
you make me puke 
hades 
it s getting so bad 
i can t even enjoy
a glass of wormwood 
she s the grand high witch 
all right 
grandma  that s the potion 
she s keeping it on ice 
yeah  it s exactly what we need 
hades  come 
we are late for tea 
teatime  perfect 
now look  all we need
is one bottle of potion 
so  grab one as fast
as you can and hurry on back 
no telling when that monster
is fixing to return 
i know you re
likely scared  baby

but ever since i was turned
into a small mouse 
little things

  a mouse 
  mmm hmm 
why on earth would i
be carrying around a mouse 
does this have anything to do
with all the rat traps
being set up
all over this hotel 
rat traps 
is this your pathetic idea
of a smoke screen 
accusing your guests
of carrying around mice
to hide the fact that this
hotel has a mouse infestation 
shh  no    shh  what 
i ll tell you this 
for what this hotel
is costing me 
i better not see a single mouse 
not even a tiny  cute one

my mistake  i m sorry 
luther 
would you please show
this lady to our finest table

  mmm 
our finest table  madam 
oh  uh  thank you  luther 
i m sure
your finest table
in this lovely establishment
is this one right here
next to the kitchen 
i always prefer
a table near the exit
so i can get out fast 
  of course 
  mmm 
check it out 
they love the soup 
have you decided 
uh  yes  i think
i ll have the jambalaya 
excellent  and would you like
something to start

looks good 
i ll have that 
i m sorry 
that soup is reserved
strictly for that group
of lady guests only 
if i may 
that large party suffers
from a severe garlic allergy 
so  they have requested their
soup be prepared garlic free 
it is very bland 
practically inedible 
i see 
that sounds disgusting 
may i suggest
the cajun spice crab creole 
it s one
of our signature dishes 
uh  sounds   
yes 
uh  the    the shrimp creole
will be fine 
you mean
the crab creole

bruno tried to explain
the situation to his mom 
hello  mother 
i m now a mouse 
  it s a mouse

mr  and mrs  jenkins
weren t really mouse people 
so  we decided it would be best
if bruno came to stay with me 
grandma  and daisy 
faster  faster 
here we go 
whee 
  cool 
  whoo hoo

how s my hair 
whoo hoo

grandma  i love being a mouse 
oh  i believe you do 
but you wanna know
something weird 
i still feel just like a boy 
but you are  darling 
life changes all of us 
i mean  look at me 
i m getting on up in the years 
but i still feel like a girl 
and i still feel like a boy 
see 
you get it 
never give up
what you are inside 
when i look at you  i don t
see whiskers and a pink nose 
i just see your eyes 
bright and beautiful 
grandma 
how long does a mouse live 
oh  an ordinary mouse
only lives about three years 
but you re no ordinary mouse 
you re a mouse person 
and a mouse person
will almost certainly live
three times longer
than an ordinary mouse 
maybe even longer 
that s great news 
i couldn t stand being
looked after by anybody else 
i ll be a very old mouse
and you ll be
a very old grandmother 
and we ll both die together 
with a little luck  darling 
but no one knows how long
their time is on this earth 
only god knows that answer 
and that is
the natural order of things 
daisy  bruno  and i
loved living with grandma 
we were one big  happy family 
where were we

ready to carry on the fight
