see what we can find 
who knows 
maybe what can find us 
no sooner than you say it 
well  it s miss marcy 
miss marcy s a beautiful 
lush blackberry bush 
we ve come across a time
or two in our travels 
what are you going to share
with us today  old friend 
juicy blackberry 
mmm 
 birds chirping 
when s the last time
you heard someone say something
that interesting 
and maybe miss marcy drops
some more berries
in the little brook 
maybe these berries
will take route
on the lake shore downstream
and bring miss marcy children
in the years to come 
i don t even know
if that s how berries work 
but it sure sounds nice 
i bet miss marcy would love
a special someone
to spruce the place up a bit 
what should we call him 
arthur 
arthur the evergreen 
i think mighty mount mansfield
would approve
of a name like that 
because there is nothing
like having the one
you hold dearest nearest
when the world turns cold 
that s the picture
we all want to paint 
thanks for going to a special
place with me  carl nargle 
cut 
and we re clear 
 sighs 
same time tomorrow 
i wouldn t miss it
for the world 
yeah 
that s it 
this is
 the world s strongest person  
almost forgot
where i was for a second 
almost 
amazing 
no other word for it 
awesome and amazing 
 chuckles 
have we never met arthur before 
there s been a pond
named arthur but never a tree 
  never a tree 
  yeah 
breaking new ground  mwah 
  oh  i forgot the milk 
  okay 
  does anything hurt 
  no  i m good 
  cramped or something 
  no 
and snow this time of year 
  oh   chuckles 
  incredible 
i never know where i m going 
you certainly got us there 
 chuckles 
so much moisture in the wind 
is it okay if i take miss marcy
and her friends to vantastic 
i think
they would appreciate that 
there you go 
they re so warm 
sorry just going to move in
right here 
  tony 
  here s coffee    with milk 
great 
tony  tony 
  katherine 
  oh  done  done 
and this is
 this afternoon in burlington  
ready  we re live 
welcome to
 this afternoon in burlington  
  and camera two 
  i m your host   
  and camera one 
  donald moore 
  stay on one  stay on one 
  it s hard to look away 
yeah  yet so many people do 
fox news is killing us 
weather channel 
  tv guide channel 
  hey  t 
  yeah 
  keep the faith 
the question is whether we want
the parade blocking access
to local
cultural establishments 
dr  bradford lenihan 
curator of burlington s
museum of art 
the burlington museum of art 
if you re a true artist
living above pittsfield
and below st  albans 
that s where your paintings are 
  yeah 
  well  i know one artist
who s got the most popular
painting show in vermont 
  and his name is carl nargle 
  yeah 
thanks 
it s just    frustrating 
i feel like sometimes
being the total package
makes it hard for people
to see the gift inside 
  we   
  mnh mnh 
i    i have an idea
that could change that 
come here 
our budget s been slashed 
and we need your help 
put me to work 
and i will sign tote bags
until my fingers turn
a rich parisian blue 
tote bags only take us so far 
we need rating ratings 
ratings only carl nargle
can deliver 
so we re going to put you on
two hours a day 
back to back 
one painting each hour 
 indistinct conversation 
so people would have a chance
to see twice as much
of my artwork 
it s  uh  katherine s idea 
katherine s idea 
well  she wants to make sure
that  uh  the station
is in good shape   
so do i 
so she can leave 
 indistinct conversation
continues in distance 
of course  as a real artist 
if i start cranking out
255 more paintings a year 
people could think  you know 
that each painting
isn t precious to me  and   
and i can t take that risk 
  we ll make do 
  sure 
but just let me know if there s
anything i can do to help 
i ll see you later 
  don t you tell me
n n n no lies woman  
   cause all you know
i ve told  
  you better leave
that midnight sneaking  
  to the one
who worked it out  
  i don t wanna hear
no back talk speaking  
  go on and shut yer mouth
  vantastic 
  vantastic 
hi  vantastic 
  so don t try to lay
no boogie woogie  
  on the king
of rock  n  roll  
  rock  n  roll
 brakes squeak 
this could be
in the burlington museum 
  no 
  it s that good  carl  yes

the burlington museum of art 
well  any building or person

custom made 
  wow  they re just the best 
  ah

brushed three times
for added loft 
must be   cause
it sure is making me hot 
like a hot pocket 
 yells

hey  number 12 s here 
  ooh

somebody s got a date 
i do  and i am excited 
does she live in an a frame
hidden away in the mountains 
 chuckles 
katherine  no 
although  she is looking
to leave pbs burlington   
mm 
which i m fine with 
you re driving a van with no
rearview mirrors and no bricks 
sounds dangerous  and i like it 
always moving forward 
just onto the next 
i wouldn t be sitting here
today if i lived any other way 
yeah  you got the best damn seat
in the best barber shop in town 
we should all be so lucky 
 both chuckle 
every forest needs
a tallest tree 
and i think we found ours
with probably the most
impressive shaft of lumber
that mount mansfield
has ever seen 
  mm hmm 
  mm 
thank you for going to
a special place with me 
carl nargle 
  cut it 
  that tree is probably too tall 
brace yourself  you are going to
get some calls about that 
sure  let me just slide you
over here a little bit 
and it started off
as a winged elm   
  uh huh 
  and then it just became
  a white oak 
  yeah  wendy get the painting 
  it s so big 
  should i put it   
put it in the van like you have
the other 6 000 times  yeah 
uh  ambrosia 
you gave me another 30 minutes 
and it would ve been a sequoia 
   chuckling  oh  my goodness 
  or a redwood 
   chuckling  yeah 
  mr  nargle 
  yeah  right over here 
  um  hi 
  oh  hi 
  hi 
  sorry 
  wow 
it    it is an honor to   
to meet you  sir 
  thank you 
  you know  when i was a kid 
my    my parents used your show
to teach me
that anything is possible   
  did they  oh 
  as long as you put
  your brushes to it  right 
   laughs 
  and now here i am 
  who    who is this 
it s  uh  ambrosia 
isn t she great 
she s absolutely fantastic 
in three  two  one 
  yeah   chuckles 
  okay 
  wait  what s going on 
  no  no  no  no 
what s happening 
nothing that
you have to worry about 
you re carl nargle 
you don t even
have to look behind you 
and i mean that literally
and figuratively 
let s    let s    let s go talk 
this is
 paint with ambrosia  
a blank canvas 
that s how we all begin 
is it intimidating 
or is it an opportunity
to create something that
the world has never seen before 
if i m being honest 
it s a little of both 
but i  for one 
am thrilled to be joining you
on this journey
of self discovery 
so let s paint 
a rock 
let s paint a rock 
when i think of rocks 
i like to think about
what s inside first 
because that s
what really matters 
uh  w    i    i have no doubt
that  uh 
a little friendly competition
will bring out
the best in you  carl 
obviously 
there s no competition
between you and ambrosia 
what i m trying to say is  uh 
the young bull is happy to learn
from the old bull 
though  inevitably 
the young bull will kill
the old bull   chuckles 
more power to ambrosia
if she can pull it    off 
that came out wrong 
i m sorry if i m interrupting 
uh  alexandra moore from
the burlington bonnet 
are you ready for the interview 
interview 
the bonnet series
on vermont state treasures 
you re number four 
tied with snow 
i left a message for you
on your cellphone 
i still haven t gotten
the hang of using
the answering machine
inside of it 
sorry  used to be you had
a person take a message for you 
  mm hmm 
  uh  well  is now a a good time
to take me to a special place
where we can talk 
carl s van 
i i m sure he s flattered 
but he s also in a relationship 
i i i was speaking
metaphorically  i   
if you mean the back
of carl s van  take a number 
uh    o or we    we could go
to your office  carl 
wow  just running through
stop signs  incredible 
are you guys okay with me
quoting you on this 
yeah  anything
to help the station 
as you may have gathered   
my office
is right over here  so   
i am a bit of a risk taker 
and i have never painted
a stump 
so i m going to do that
for my second painting 
two paintings in one hour 
not that that s a big deal 
why is that such a big deal 
nobody paints
two paintings in an hour 
it takes paint
to a whole new place 
and it s been a lot of places 
could be our  dancing with
the stars    shark tank  block 
oh  i love
 dancing with the stars  
it s my favorite show 
it s been wonderful
talking to you 
good night  everyone 
ouf 
i ve never seen him that mad 
tonight s supposed to be
our night 
  what am i supposed to do 
  i m headed to price chopper
to hang out in the beer aisle
if you want to join 
she just picked up a case of the
lonelies  make  em less lonely 
if you do it right  you don t
even have to leave the store 
every stump has roots  right 
evidence where it started 
is that a second painting 
it s a stump 
incredible 
 engine starts 
 sighs 
  lay no boogie woogie
on the king     
 dancing with the stars 
is my favorite
celebrity dance show 
 sighs 
 feedback 
 sighs 
you re entitled
to your favorite tv show 
that s what makes
this country great 
but my favorite show
is  paint with carl nargle  
 breathes deeply 
get in 
paint is a lot like life 
you got to move on from mistakes
if you re going to be happy 
which is why
  i am going to add brown 
   scoffs 
i guess jenna s going to get
her picture tonight  huh 
hm  did i ever tell you
about the time i got mine 
oh  god  please don t 
i mean  you have 
many times  too many 
it s all a blur  but i remember
it like it was yesterday 
i know 
just maybe don t this time 
this one time 
he d finished all of his chowder
and most of his bread bowl 
and then he turned to me
and he said 
you want to touch my sandals 
  do it
and i said   
more than
i ve ever wanted anything 
  do it
his socks didn t stay on
for long  either 
oh  even under the sheet 
i could tell it was impressive 
  do the hustle
and then he mounted it
on my living room wall
for everyone to see 
what do you think 
oh  carl 
a one of a kind picture
just for me 
but why are the ufo
and the stump covered in blood 
because that s art 
this is not the kind of thing
people paint on pbs 
until we paint again 
i m ambrosia 
that s a lot of blood for a ufo 
and a stump 
  chuckles 
how do i know when it s done 
 chuckles 
holy moly 
and    cut 
we re clear 
and    cut 
we re clear 
that a ufo 
you know 
half the people watching
are going to think it s   
it s real 
  ratings are in 
  what  for ambrosia 
  h    no  last week 
  oh 
you know  i was just trying
to kind of paint the opposite
  of what carl does   
  mm hmm 
and that ended up being a ufo
  covered in blood 
  oh  dear goodness 
  you re katherine 
  uh   
whoa  okay  so carl said
that you were
his reason for painting 
living  and loving 
burlington bonnet 
august 15  1993 
wow  that was  yeah 
so long ago 
  i practically forgot about that 
  did you say
   ufo covered in blood  
  yeah 
so our viewers call the station
a lot when they re upset 
  no more blood  no more ufos 
  got it  got it 
  understood 
  yes 
geez  ratings 
well  you keep
shaking things up like this 
it ll be your profile
in the burlington bonnet 
have you ever heard
of cheesepot depot 
here  i m going to load
you up a good one 
here we go 
um  i  uh   
i ve been vegan since i was 7 
really 
shouldn t be a crime in having
another relish tray  i guess 
not tonight 
i want to taste the cheese 
 chuckles 
mmm  and the meat under it   
so much 
  veal  or was it lamb 
   gurgles 
no  no  the gray one
was definitely the veal 
   grunts 
  are you okay 
  yeah 
  you want something
  to wash it down with 
  hurry 
here 
here  have some cheddar 
how is everything 
it s good 
good  thank you 
it s great  thank you 
i was thinking about
trying to do my own art 
maybe pottery 
yeah  but so good at the copier
and the faxing all the   
well  how many pages
can you fax at once 
  24 
  24 
 chuckles 
i don t even know where
the cover sheets are 
well  i could show you 
i i guess what i m trying to say
is the station s been
so good to me 
and it can do the same for you 
i think sometimes it s just
being grateful for what we have 
without getting stuck
in something
that s not working  right 
like   
like how you dated katherine
and how you don t think
about her 
yeah 
was that katherine 
i don t even   
it s funny how my eye
doesn t even go to her 
since the day
that wendy was hired  right 
that s when things ended
with katherine 
yeah 
what started as an innocent
sunset shoulder massage
in the back of a van
at the water s edge
turned into a picture
i never expected to paint 
 moaning 
i have some oils in my purse 
shut the curtains 
  yeah  they call me
  hot and nasty
  yeah  they call me
  unh
it s a good thing katherine
cheated on you first 
  yeah 
  so you don t have
  to feel guilty 
  yes 
a real man never looks back 
i don t 
thank you 
thanks so much 
d    do you want some advice 
always 
paint from your heart 
live from your heart 
  yeah 
  etch a sketch a dinosaur 
have it attack atlantis
if that s who you are 
that is exactly who i am 
actually so that s great 
   both laugh 
  yeah 
you know  and don t   
don t let fame
bring out the worst in you
or    or anyone around you 
deal 
you can help me with that 
oh  i    i  um   
i ve been offered a job
at pbs albany 
it s the same thing
i m doing now 
it s    i m just
the assistant to the gm 
katherine   
you run pbs burlington
without the gm title 
which means you should run
pbs albany with the title 
  you ready 
  let s go 
  thank you 
  yeah 
i hope you like this painting
of mount mansfield
on a cold february
late afternoon 
 gasps 
does this mean i m your muse 
i ve always wanted to be
one of those 
do you want to see what s on tv 
i actually  um  think
there might be another
teal and desert sand colored tv
at the top
of these
golden rod number five stairs 
you sure know your stair colors 
   barracuda  plays 
let s slowly
brush back his locks 
and lightly caress
the base of this neck 
i m having a hard time
finding the tv 
oh  um  i forgot 
i    i moved it into the other
room when i got a bigger bed 
oh 
slide over to his clavicle 
maybe the kisses
are even gentler here 
speaking of tvs 
i don t know if you heard this 
but they are showing  paint 
on channel 9 in rutland 
do you know what that is 
i don t get down to rutland
as much as i d like 
soft blowing in your ear canal 
there s not a highway
down there 
deeper than expected 
let s find out if the curtains
match the drapes 
  need better gas manage 
   stomach gurgles 
are you okay 
i think i m going to throw up 
okay  maybe the highway system
isn t the only thing
moving too fast 
i mean  from the   
from the meat 
i can t stop thinking about
how i have a cow inside me 
you mean the veal 
   door opens 
   vomiting 
i just want you to know
that i can t imagine tonight
being any better 
 vomits 
can you 
same 
 toilet flushes 
is this portuguese flannel 
i don t know 
i got it at the store 
i m just going to brush
my teeth super fast 
and i ll be right out 
  w well  t take your time 
  oh  no   vomits 
overlooking mount mansfield
seems impossible
because it s
the biggest thing in vermont 
but some people do 
and they fall in love
with camel s hump 
which is barely in
the top four tallest mountains 
given the choice  i guess
i d rather be mount mansfield 
thanks for going to a special
place with me  carl nargle 
and we re clear  ambrosia 
  right 
  okay 
right over here 
here we go 
careful 
tony  did you hear what i said
about camel s hump 
yeah  really moving 
it s another great one 
mr  nargle 
it s amazing
how you keep doing it 
  thank you 
  yeah 
i thought that was great 
i could take your pipe for you 
   ambrosia and wendy chuckle 
  good luck 
and in three  two   
hi  friends  and welcome to
 paint with ambrosia  
today s painting is inspired by
the heart of this station  katherine 
and as a way of saying
thank you 
i m going to paint her
a bullet train 
because once a bullet train
gets started  it s hard to stop 
are you    are you yelling at me 
yes  when i finished
my painting show yesterday 
i wanted pretzels 
no one brought me any  tony 
carl  i know it s a period
of adjustment with   
with ambrosia here  but let me
tell you what s happening 
what s happening is people need
to start doing their jobs 
which isn t going to happen
if katherine
and the rest of the staff
are watching one too many
painting shows in a row
instead of doing whatever it
is they re supposed to be doing 
i m going to keep them
to an hour break  okay  but
  that s good energy here  carl 
  thank you  i know 
  i don t want to lose it 
  i don t  either 
these are exciting times here
at the new pbs burlington 
  are these the new tote bags 
  huh 
yeah  it s only
because yours weren t selling 
let me rephrase that 
it s only because
yours    weren t    selling 
   sexual revolution  plays 
i have something for you 
  everybody  shake it
hm 
 both chuckle 
  time to be free
this dinosaur
attacking atlantis 
   laughs  yeah 
   laughs 
i m  uh    i m having a hard time
not making a lot of things
for you these days 
well  everybody s going to be
very jealous  you see 
then i will paint them all
pictures  but just   
not as awesome as this 
  but your mama lied to you
albany has a ton to offer 
i 90 and i 87 go right through
the middle of it 
the new york capital region
could use a painting show 
i i would imagine 
  and share your freak
with the rest of us  
  a beautiful thing
okay 
  okay 
  okay 
  okay  um   
  okay 
i i i have to warn you
that i ve never done
what we re about to do 
i think  so   
okay 
what is it we re about to do 
i ve never had sex
with a woman  okay 
katherine 
 gasping

 new artist gives pbs
burlington much needed boost  
i read it 
 vermonters  what if i told you
there was a new artist
who can paint circles
around carl nargle 
would that make
you want to watch 
well  one thing s for sure 
people are watching
pbs burlington
like never before
for one reason and one name
am    ambrosia  
yeah 
 after years of watching
carl nargle s paint dry 
the green mountains are alive
with the sound of creativity  
you know  uh  how about
don t    read it    maybe 
 carl is one dimensional 
antiquated  very sexiest    
 very sexist  
i think i get the idea 
  are you okay 
  yeah 
i think you know me well enough
to know i don t care
what people say about me
or what they write 
   when you re hot 
you re hot  plays 
 tires squeal

by katherine and ambrosia 
i ve already run it by me 
it s been approved 
we are live in five  four 
three  two   
on today s show  this person
will become a key chain 
let s see how 
 the whittler  
the pbs burlington pledge drive
has always brought you
the very best
in vermont public broadcasting 
but now 
for the very first time ever 
loyal viewers like you
and can bid on carl nargle
or the white hot ambrosia
painting your portrait live
while still receiving
a complimentary tote bag 
this is the
public broadcasting syndicate s
super bowl  world series 
and  real housewives
of new jersey  reunion
all rolled into one 
let the bidding begin 
 applause 
  carl is my boyfriend 
  he s not your boyfriend 
yes  he is 
that s what he told me 
thank you  sylvia and portia 
they all fall for carl 
another call for carl 
and one for ambrosia 
incredible 
how did you do that 
thank you 
jay fogarty from chittenden 
you are magic 
if you want your portrait
painted by ambrosia 
you need to bid more than  435 
and if you want your portrait
painted by carl nargle 
you need to bid more than  875
in the next 10  9  8 
7  6  5 
4  3  2  1 
  that s it 
  that s it 
no more calls 
   telephone rings 
  pbs burlington pledge drive 
  does that count 
  it s too late  isn t it 
i think it s over  right 
does that count 
yes 
yes  i m writing it down 
we re all very excited 
it s been a great day 
thank you so much for everything
you ve done for the station 
well 
jay fogerty s mother
would like to pick him up
in front of the station
in 10 minutes 
that s it 
thank you 
keep those pledges coming 
  we did it 
  it s for a good cause 
look at bridget 
lighting up the stage
with her radiant smile 
she is a winner 
pbs burlington is also smiling 
you know  mary is also a winner 
it s such a joy to paint 
they both look great 
and another great thing
about pbs burlington is   
bridget s generosity 
which kind of
puts us all to shame 
it s an honor
for me to be up here painting
someone who bid
so much more than anyone else 
thank you  bridget 
and thank you to mary 
i am so grateful 
you know  she hasn t worked in
eight years  so her bid
is actually a higher percentage
of net worth 
which  you know  feels like
the true barometer 
bridget 
she s not going to be able
to visit her grandkids
this year 
can t afford it  right 
so it s a little scary
how much this means to her 
that s    that s so sad 
but  you know 
mary had to turn off her heat 
  i ll turn off your heat 
  you never turned it on 
  never tried to 
  done 
i was already done 
how much do we raise 
almost  8 000 
how much do we need 
  a little less than  300 000 
  ah 
mary  this is for you 
i call it  rich in spirit  
i ve always wanted a laser 
bridget  are you ready 
this is for you 
i call it
 mighty mount mansfield  
on an early  surprisingly
chilly april morning 
can you see it 
why was i smiling
that whole time 
that s just the same mountain
you always paint 
that doesn t look
anything like me 
it s the same painting
as valentine s day season 8 
  the creek is smaller 
  the creek is smaller 
that is   
because  um   
carl didn t
want to ruin the surprise 
yes  you both are actually
getting two paintings 
yeah  a portrait from me and one
of carl s incredible landscapes 
we just didn t want either
of you to not get a nargle 
he was supposed
to paint my portrait 
i spent my snack allowance
for the next eight years 
i know  bridget  but did you
hear what ambrosia said 
you re going to get
a portrait by her 
as well as this painting
of mighty mount mansfield 
and   
 29 
another  20 
just    here you go 
which brings us to  74  and you
can head over to craft service
and get anything you want 
sandwiches  some raisins 
well    shit 
you know  i get so many
questions about my tote bag
every time i m in a restaurant 
what s wrong 
i know how to save the station 
let s add a little smoke
to these chimneys 
see if we can make them
even a little cozier 
i think ambrosia might be
a little jealous
if she saw you watching this 
i m just making sure
all your old tapes still play 
boy  it really takes you back 
doesn t it 
of course  this river   
look at that shirt 
it s really held up 
so it has 
and that little hamlet is where
i took you for our first date 
good memory  yeah 
great memory 
you know  i forgot how much
you used to paint
all this other stuff 
ice cream stands and
windmills and birds in flight 
now it s just mount mansfield
in every single painting 
hard not to hold on
to a dream or two 
why did you do it 
i dropped out of college for
us  and i was really great 
and then i realized that  us 
was really    really you 
and you got famous 
and then you started to treat me
like everybody else 
i mean  not bad  never bad 
just    not special 
and then someone else paid
so much attention to me 
and i made a mistake 
 music stops 
 truck squeaking 
 door rattles 
i couldn t live with myself 
so i told you 
just begged you to forgive me 
then like  a minute later 
you were having sex with wendy 
i just spent the rest of my life
watching you make everybody else
in my life
fall in love with you 
i just   
i wish i would have known
what i should have
done differently 
me  too 
guess who gets to watch
seasons 2 through 8
of  paint with carl nargle  
sounds like a dream come true 
there s a lot of   
a lot of good stuff in there 
did i do something wrong 
you did not 
oh  hey  grab a seat 
i have some exciting news
i want to talk to you about 
always nice
to hear exciting news 
ready 
i have found you
an incredible job 
what 
teaching at
the university of vermont 
where you will be passing
along your incredible skills
to students
from around the world 
i love the idea of giving back 
i mean 
that is a big honor  right 
i just think with my work here 
i m not going to have the time 
exactly 
carl  our revenues is way down
and you re making
 46 000 a year 
now  uvm will give you
a  4 000 raise 
and here s the best part 
we have 22 years of reruns
of your show 
people will
never even know you left 
it s the best of both worlds 
so i ll host  paint  
teach at uvm 
22 years of reruns
you re going to be showing 
you re turning ol  carl nargle
into a workhorse 
a damn clydesdale 
except here s the thing 
ambrosia will create the new
shows that ll bring in the kids 
your reruns will be there
for our core 65 plus audience 
you don t have to host a new
episode of  paint  ever again 
but i want to keep painting 
you will  at uvm 
50 students a day watching you 
that s a 400  bump in
the 18 to 25 demo for you 
 clears throat  yeah 
i just got a couple
of things for you to sign
saying    here you go 
right here 
saying we didn t    go ahead 
we didn t fire you
because you re old 
good  that s very good 
thank you  carl 
that s all i got 
 clears throat  i ll see you 
sure 
 door opens  closes 
carl 
hey  carl 
i just   
i wanted to say thank you 
you know  for paving the way 
i had that plate for 30 years 
yeah  no  i used
to see you parked at lums 
 home of the lumber  
you added an e to the mona lisa 
but here s the deal 
no one s waiting in line
to see the mona e  lisa 
because that s
a really dumb name 
not very original 
you never tried to get
p a i n t e r 
no  i didn t 
and a real artist would
never etch a sketch a dinosaur
and then give it to someone 
because that s really dumb  too 
carl  you used
your brush to seduce
and destroy people
who loved you 
no  i opened their car doors 
picked up every check 
and always carried
the big suitcases 
did you ever try
treating them as equals 
no 
i treated them better than me 
it s called being a gentleman 
until you moved on to the next 
because your girlfriend
made a mistake 
you re a mistake 
you re lucky i m an artist
instead of a woman
who says really mean
things to other women 
 cause i would have plenty
to say to you 
plenty 
you were an artist 
 sighs 
carl s the reason
i started working here 
him  and because quiznos
wasn t hiring 
the place has great hours 
  he is such a turd 
  come on 
you couldn t afford
to pay his salary
and keep the station going 
yeah 
sometimes you just have
no choice but to move on 
  you fill up my senses
if it were up to me  you d never
leave the back of this van 
god  that sounds like heaven 
  like a walk in the rain
what are you doing 
just committing every inch
of you to memory
so i can relive this moment
every moment
for the rest of my life 
the way you look  the way you   
even the texture of
this arm rest 
the hum of the space heater 
do you smell that 
  no 
  transmission fluid 
and there isn t much of it 
she runs pretty clean 
i just    i know i m always gonna
remember how i feel right now 
because i just   
i just always want
to feel this way 
i m ready to feel
how you feel right now 
  mm 
  that s the arm rest 
  what 
  that s the   
 clears throat 
that s the arm rest 
that s it  that s me 
oh  that s all me 
i have to ask you something
that s really hard to ask 
hello 
why didn t you
just paint the portrait 
you could just paint one amazing
portrait and blow ambrosia away 
  it s stupid 
  decided i was going to ask you
to drive me home if you
weren t going to answer me 
okay 
19 years ago 
dr  bradford lenihan
said the
burlington museum of art
lacked a painting of vermont s
highest peak  mount mansfield 
and i really  really wanted
a painting in that museum 
and 
so i started painting it 
in case he was watching 
let me guess 
dr  bradford lenihan didn t
like the way you painted it 
well  it s   
it s more complicated 
well  then i should go
if you don t think
i ll understand anything 
i don t know  i don t know 
what do you mean 
you don t know 
i    i don t   
i don t know if he ever
watched the show 
you never thought to call him
or to walk one of your
thousands of paintings
down to him
over the last 19 years 
what if he said no 
a real artist follows his heart 
no matter what the price 
you spent your whole life
playing it safe 
and now you ve lost everything 
everything 
and i have
another question for you 
 thumps 
how come we never have sex 
people tell me i m attractive 
you re very attractive 
will you just come inside 
 door closes 
the beautiful part is
we re moving on together 
and once i began teaching   
the only reason you care
about me now is because
i m the one thing you have left 
 car horn honks 
my uber is here 
i don t know what that is 
it s goodbye 
 door opens 
 door slams 
i m carl nargle  and i m going
to be your professor 
 applause 
thank you 
listen  our goal
this semester is pretty simple 
i want to help you get
what s in here
and just splash it on to there 
don t worry 
it s not rocket science 
it s harder 
 light laughter 
is it true that ambrosia s
teaching this class with you 
well  i mean  she may stop
by one of these days 
you never know
who s going to join us
or where we might be going 
so let s get there 
sorry if that came out wrong 
um   
we still want to see you  too 
thanks 
well  should we get started 
because this canvas
ain t going to paint itself 
but it would be great to know
when she was coming 
just so we could make sure
to be in class 
hey  can i ask you something 
if you were dating somebody 
like  really young
and really beautiful   
 whispering     why wouldn t you
have sex with them 
i was hoping you d talk to me
about ambrosia 
it s such a mystery 
no  actually  it s not   
i brought carl his painting
last night  and   
i imagine having sex with her
is like riding a bike 
except instead of pedaling 
you just kind of move
back and forth on the seat 
i ve ridden that kind of bike 
and i love bikes 
 crunching 
i have to be somewhere else   
now 
hi 
hey 
 sighs 
you went to carl s house
last night 
he treated you like crap 
and i cheated on him 
  do you love him 
   scoffs 
i just   
i feel like i just wasted
my whole life
not loving someone else 
 exhales deeply 
i kind of set you up to say no 
i love you 
what s this 
why  it s mount mansfield 
this  another mount mansfield 
sorry  just give me one minute
and i will paint you
the best mount mansfield
that you have ever seen 
what a show off 
oh  no 
it s so good 
 clears throat 
  if you could read
my mind  love  
  what a tale
my thoughts could tell  
  just like an old time movie
  about a ghost
from a wishing well  
  in a castle dark
  or a fortress strong
with chains upon my feet  
  you know that ghost is me
  and i will never be set free
  as long as i m a ghost
you can t see  
  if i could read
your mind  love  
  what a tale your thoughts
could tell  
 sighs 
 car horn blaring 
 car horn honking 
 horn blaring continuously 
 honking 
  the hero would be me
  but heroes often fail
 car horn blares 
  and you won t read
that book again  
  because the ending s
just too hard to take  
what s this one 
mount mansfield 
at night 
how s everything going  carl 
awesome 
carl 
the faculty s been talking 
we think what makes
the most sense is to go ahead
and pay you
for the rest of the semester
and end your class today 
we ve already spoken
with your remaining students 
and they re okay with it 
both of them 
this is  paint with ambrosia  
roygbiv 
you know  when i was a kid 
my parents told me that
that was who lived in rainbows 
today  i know better 
because there are no rainbows 
 sighs 
what if ratings go down 
tony  it is time for me to go 
 beeping 
booth 
  hey  tony  it s carl 
  carl 
tony  what happened to my show 
pbs can no longer show people
using tobacco 
what 
you smoked a pipe
in every episode 
we can t air
 paint with carl nargle  
not even a rerun 
tony  i ve got another call 
that s when you get
call waiting 
excuse me  dr  lenihan 
hello 
  mr  carl nargle 
  yeah 
to what do i owe the honor
of a visit from a living
vermont state treasure 
well  i don t know if you heard 
but i recently retired 
it was in the paper 
yeah  which means i have 4 274
paintings that could use a home 
they re mostly
of mount mansfield 
i don t know
if that would interest you 
we are always looking to
display the work of a master
here at the
burlington museum of art 
great 
someone appreciated for
their impact on the world of art
or representing something
unique to vermont 
yes  wonderful 
sadly  we just had
the walls painted 
and that s something
we re showing off  too 
you know  the beauty
of the museum itself 
  might i offer a suggestion 
  sure 
have you considered
donating them to a motel 6 
or perhaps a red roof inn 
your paintings have such warmth 
and that could really appeal
to a weary traveler on a budget 
at the very least  it would
save you quite a bit on storage 
yeah  i    i have my own barn 
so that s not   
anyway  uh  thank you so much
for your time 
dr  lenihan 
you have a magnificent museum 
  carl 
  yeah 
can i ask you a question 
yeah 
what s the image tucked away
in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul feel like
it s going to burst 
uh   
mount mansfield  i presume 
whatever that thing is 
those are the paintings
that keep us from
staring at blank walls
here at the
burlington museum of art 
well  thank you for stopping by 
always great to see
a vermont legend in the flesh 
  back through the years
i go wandering once again  
that s really good 
  back to
the seasons of my youth  
  i recall a box of rags
that someone gave us  
  and how my mama
put the rags to use  
  there were rags
of many colors  
  and every piece was small
  and i didn t have a coat
  and it was way down
in the fall  
  mama sewed the rags together
  sewing every piece with love
  she made my coat
of many colors  
ahh 
  as she sewed 
she told a story  
  from the bible she had read
  about a coat of many colors
joseph wore  
  and then she said
  perhaps this coat will bring
you good luck and happiness  
  and i just
couldn t wait to wear it  
  and mama blessed it
with a kiss  
 groans 
what s the image
tucked away in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul feel like
it s going to burst 
  although we had no money 
i was rich as i could be  
  in my coat of many colors
my mama made for me  
what s the image
tucked away in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul feel like
it s going to burst 
  so with patches
on my britches  
  and holes in both my shoes
  in my coat of many colors
what s the image
tucked away in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul
feel like it s going to burst 
  in my coat of many colors
my mama made for me  
 squeaking 
katherine  i know this probably
isn t the best time 
but if i don t say this now 
i never will 
when we first met 
i painted out of love 
  my head got turned   
  hey 
i was just on my way to the   
to the station 
uh  how you    how you been 
some highs  some lows 
you know  i never   
i never got to say sorry
for painting mount mansfield 
it was all my fault 
ambrosia  i just want to finish
what i was saying to katherine 
actually 
i    i do need to get going 
i ll be fast  katherine   
as you know 
i m better with pictures
than i am with words 
but if i could paint you one
in the form of an apology   
it s over 
ambrosia  i thought we were
being nice to each other 
now it just feels like
you re rubbing my nose in it 
no  i mean 
we re over 
she could never love me because
she never stopped loving you 
hey  carl 
beverly 
i didn t see that coming 
hold on  i m coming 
i m coming  here we go 
nice to see some old friends 
yeah  well  we never got around
to throwing them out 
  there they are 
  okay 
  and here 
  that s fine 
whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
whoa  whoa  whoa 
we need this one to air 
okay  alright 
let s roll the open
in three  two   
hey  where s ambrosia 
well  she called
and told me to let carl host 
i got something i have to say
and this
is my only way to say it 
and pbs  they need 2 new hours
of programing every day 
so we are airing  paint
with carl nargle  in five   
carl   
before you say or do anything 
you should know i m the one
that got your show canceled 
katherine  if you hadn t 
i wouldn t be here right now 
hi  i m carl nargle 
and this is  paint  
i used to always say
you got to paint from the heart
to live from the heart
without doing either 
which is why today 
i am starting with
tangerine orange 22 
why tangerine orange 22 
well   
because we all have moments
in our lives 
moments we wish
we could go back to
and live in forever 
mine is in the back of my van
on a custom made sofa bed
with a woman i barely knew 
yo  it s ambrosia  why
aren t you watching my show 
ah  just kidding 
you know what to do next   
but you know what 
it s a perfect memory 
but what made it perfect
are the imperfections
  we shared together 
  pbs burlington 
i just want to say
it s great to have carl back 
yes  it is great
to have carl back 
please hold  pbs burlington 
i m no longer terrified
watching  paint  
i agree 
carl s paintings are
less terrifying than ambrosia s 
please hold  pbs burlington 
  carl stole my newspaper 
  yes 
we re aware that carl
is stealing newspapers 
please hold  pbs burlington 
the smell of transmission fluid 
though there wasn t much of it 
she runs pretty clean 
   phone ringing 
  ambrosia 
uh  no  sorry 
  katherine 
  oh 
  it s brian hoffman 
  yes  h    hi 
from pbs sullivan 
yes  hi  brian  how are you 
i    i m just packing up
all my stuff here
and really looking forward
to monday 
we are  too  uh   
but we went back
and looked at your resume 
do you not have
a college degree 
because the truth is 
if you spend all your time
trying to paint
the perfect picture 
you re just gonna miss
the best parts of life 
i know i did 
thanks for finally going to
a special place with me 
carl nargle 
great  great  great 
you can have the show back 
anything you want 
you just have to keep painting 
no  no  that s it 
i don t have anything
left to paint 
  carl   
  thanks  tony 
  goodbye  thanks 
  carl  carl 
i ll fire ambrosia
if you just come back 
which is a joke i like to say   
 laughs     all the time 
but it s not true 
hey  everybody  here s
the star of  paint  
it s ambrosia 
 chuckles  it s   
hi 
 headset clatters 
i m tony 
i m going to show you
a whole new way to paint
for the next   
1 hour and 31 minutes 
let s    let s just have some
people looking at the bears 
well  we never did the bear   
the bears  of course  are
no color that i have here 
so i ll do it with   
paint from the heart 
live from the heart 
she took my advice 
how s everybody doing out there 
you should probably
look at this 
there  and that is   
you okay 
what s going on 
can i get a number four 
what 
number four on the chart 
i put that up in 1979
because it came with the shaver 
i had no idea what a number 12
was until you picked it 
or what a number four is now 
neither do i 
but i want it 
 clipper buzzing 
  whole lotta your love
  baby  i need
  whole lotta your love
  ooh
hi  i m carl nargle 
i never thought i d say this 
but you look better 
somehow  you did it 
you re always in my corner  sid 
thanks 
ruben  what do i owe you 
this one s on the house 
can i have it 
  what 
  my hair 
well  i m going to have to
charge you for that 
 money rustling 
i m kidding 
of course you can have it 
hold on 
you need something
to take the edge off 
no 
painting s always been my high 
but it s medical marijuana 
and you need some medicine 
and here s some gummies 
in case you need a boost 
forward  carl 
keep moving forward 
always  sid 
you spend your whole
life worrying
about the tallest peaks 
the biggest successes 
the legacy you ll leave behind 
at a certain point  you
realize it s all meaningless
without a special someone
by your side 
why are you still here 
  i know it s over
  but life goes on
  and this old world
will keep on turning  
  let s just be glad
we had some time  
  to spend together
  there s no need to
watch the bridges  
  that we re burning
  lay your head
  upon my pillow
  hold your
warm and tender body  
carl 
carl 
carl  carl 
burlington museum of art said
they wanted a painting
of mount mansfield 
19 years 
and i never had the guts
to show them one of mine 
you want to know why 
yeah  why don t you
tell me outside 
because the love of my life 
stepped out on me
with a

carl   
 crunching 
 tv playing in background 
the finest dairy products
in all of the northeast kingdom 
make it gerald milk and cheese 
meeting or exceeding your
milk and cheese needs
for 46 years   
the fire is the lead story
in the news 
  cnn 
  um  local 
when do you leave 
um  i don t 
they offered me
the assistant job
when they found out that
i don t have a college degree 
  you re not going to take it 
  mnh mnh 
i m done settling 
oh  hold on 
here s an update
on the carl nargle story 
an unnamed police source
has told channel 31 action news
that carl nargle s dna 
specifically a large portion
of his hair 
was found in the ashes 
with all of
his paintings burned 
at least we will have his locks
to remember this
vermont state treasure by 
and speaking of treasure 
every kid treasures presents 
and for six
lucky children present   
carl nargle is dead 
so he is 
good morning 
how many nargles do you have 
i was originally hired
to do graphics 
but it s more than just
the article in the paper
where you ask if a reporter
wants to have sex with carl
and you personally hosting
two live paintings shows
very poorly 
 phone ringing 
oh  well 
our overhead s way down 
so many people quitting 
there s some positives there 
one sec 
pbs burlington 
anthony  bradford lenihan 
calling with my condolences
on the passing of carl nargle 
  yeah  it s a tough day 
  i ll be brief 
i recently spoke with carl
about showing at burlington 
everything was burned
in the fire 
which means any surviving
nargles would be quite valuable 
the burlington museum of art
cannot be a complete collection
of vermont beaux arts
without at least one nargle 
and we are willing
to pay for it 
 clattering 
 laughs 
please tell me you have one 
he made jenna rich 
  he made you all rich 
  yeah 
should we go inside 
yeah 
come on   laughs 
  i wish i was dead 
  it s gonna be okay 
i say inappropriate things
when i m uncomfortable 
   spits gum 
  hey  i m mandy 
  ambrosia s mom 
  oh  hi 
aww 
  this is meemaw 
  beverly brown 
i went to school with
your meemaw 
and roll the graphic 
and take camera one 
our final guest this afternoon
is the new host of  paint  
please welcome
to the show  mary 
one of the hosts
of  paint   donald 
i m happy to announce that
thanks to a sizable donation
from our new gm  wendy 
and some technological wizardry
from our new
head of graphics  tony 
pbs burlington was able to
digitally remove
carl nargle s pipe
from his shows
so we can all watch him take us
to his special place forever 
and then roll the clip 
 slowly whirring 
put anything in my stew 
 cause i ll eat it 
i love a good stew 
feel free to draw me a letter
with your favorite stews 
always nice to hear
from people back home 
the wonders   
of technology 
 knock on door 
do you know what that s worth 
yup 
  okay 
  yes  indeed 
where do you think he is  really 
heaven 
yeah 
  you fill up my senses
  like a night in the forest
  like the mountains
in springtime  
there she is  miss marcy 
  like a walk in the rain
what are you gonna share with
us today  old friend 
looks like someone s been
working overtime 
 car door closes 
i got groceries 
you feel like grilling 
i already put it on 
  you fill up my senses
  how was school 
  oh  it was  um   
confusing and awful 
i tried to warn you years ago 
can i tell you something
really  really important 
yeah 
if i m never going to
leave here 
i think we should
probably get cable 
well  you know 
a man who has the love of
a good blackberry bush
shouldn t need cable 
what about a vcr 
i think being able
to watch a movie
while you re away could help
make this our special place 
oh  it s already
pretty great for me 
  come let me love you
what do you think 
  make the blue red 
  okay 
and what if it was
a little girl 
i like it 
just promise me
you won t become famous again 
well  i m not going
to sign it carl nargle 
he died in a barn 
sign it  barnsy  
re barnsy 
maybe  barnsy  
  maybe  blanksy  
  blanksy 
blanksy 
  meet me
in the middle of the day  
  let me hear you say
   everything s okay 
  come on out beneath
the shining sun  
  meet me in
the middle of the night  
  let me hear you say
   everything s alright 
  sneak on out beneath
the stars and run  yeah  
  oh  yeah  yes
  oh  yes
  it s king and queen
and we must go down  round  
  behind the chandelier
  where i won t have
to speak my mind  
  and you won t have to hear
  shreds of news
and afterthoughts  
  and complicated scenes
  we ll weather down
behind the light  
  and fade like magazines
  oh  yeah  yeah
  i don t believe
in superstars  
  organic food
and foreign cars  
  i don t believe
the price of gold  
  the certainty of growing old
  that right is right
and left is wrong  
  that north and south
can t get along  
  that east is east
and west is west  
  and being first
is always best  
  but i believe in love
  i believe in babies
  i believe in mom and dad
  and i believe in you
  well  i don t believe
that heaven waits  
  for only those
who congregate  
  i like to think of god
as love  
  he s down below 
he s up above  
  he s watching people
everywhere  
  he knows who does
and doesn t care  
  and i m an ordinary man
  sometimes i wonder who i am
  but i believe in love
  i believe in music
  i believe in magic
  and i believe in you
  i know with all my certainty
  what s going on
with you and me  
  is a good thing
  it s true
  i believe in you
  i don t believe virginity
  is as common
as it used to be  
  in working days
and sleeping nights  
  that black is black
and white is white  
  that superman and robin hood
  are still alive in hollywood
  that gasoline s
in short supply  
  the rising cost
of getting by  
  but i believe in love
  i believe in old folks
  i believe in children
