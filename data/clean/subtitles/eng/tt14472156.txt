see what we can find
who knows
maybe what can find us
no sooner than you say it
well its miss marcy
miss marcys a beautiful
lush blackberry bush
weve come across a time
or two in our travels
what are you going to share
with us today old friend
juicy blackberry
mmm
birds chirping
whens the last time
you heard someone say something
that interesting
and maybe miss marcy drops
some more berries
in the little brook
maybe these berries
will take route
on the lake shore downstream
and bring miss marcy children
in the years to come
i dont even know
if thats how berries work
but it sure sounds nice
i bet miss marcy would love
a special someone
to spruce the place up a bit
what should we call him
arthur
arthur the evergreen
i think mighty mount mansfield
would approve
of a name like that
because there is nothing
like having the one
you hold dearest nearest
when the world turns cold
thats the picture
we all want to paint
thanks for going to a special
place with me carl nargle
cut
and were clear
sighs
same time tomorrow
i wouldnt miss it
for the world
yeah
thats it
this is
the worlds strongest person
almost forgot
where i was for a second
almost
amazing
no other word for it
awesome and amazing
chuckles
have we never met arthur before
theres been a pond
named arthur but never a tree
never a tree
yeah
breaking new ground mwah
oh i forgot the milk

no im good
cramped or something
no
and snow this time of year
oh chuckles
incredible
i never know where im going
you certainly got us there
chuckles
so much moisture in the wind

tony tony
katherine
oh done done
and this is
this afternoon in burlington
ready were live
welcome to
this afternoon in burlington
and camera two
im your host
and camera one
donald moore
stay on one stay on one
its hard to look away
yeah yet so many people do
fox news is killing us
weather channel
tv guide channel
hey t
yeah
keep the faith
the question is whether we want
the parade blocking access
to local
cultural establishments
dr bradford lenihan
curator of burlingtons
museum of art
the burlington museum of art
if youre a true artist
living above pittsfield
and below st albans
thats where your paintings are
yeah
well i know one artist
whos got the most popular
painting show in vermont
and his name is carl nargle
yeah
thanks
its just frustrating
i feel like sometimes
being the total package
makes it hard for people
to see the gift inside
we
mnhmnh
i i have an idea
that could change that
come here
our budgets been slashed
and we need your help
put me to work
and i will sign tote bags
until my fingers turn
a rich parisian blue
tote bags only take us so far
we need rating ratings
ratings only carl nargle
can deliver
so were going to put you on
two hours a day
back to back
one painting each hour
indistinct conversation
so people would have a chance
to see twice as much
of my artwork
its uh katherines idea
katherines idea
well she wants to make sure
that uh the station
is in good shape
so do i
so she can leave
indistinct conversation
continues in distance
of course as a real artist
if i start cranking out
255 more paintings a year
people could think you know
that each painting
isnt precious to me and
and i cant take that risk
well make do
sure
but just let me know if theres
anything i can do to help
ill see you later
dont you tell me
nnnno lies woman
cause all you know
ive told
you better leave
that midnight sneaking
to the one
who worked it out
i dont wanna hear
no backtalk speaking
go on and shut yer mouth
vantastic
vantastic
hi vantastic

youre driving a van with no
rearview mirrors and no bricks

always moving forward
just onto the next
i wouldnt be sitting here
today if i lived any other way
yeah you got the best damn seat
in the best barber shop in town
we should all be so lucky
both chuckle
every forest needs
a tallest tree
and i think we found ours
with probably the most
impressive shaft of lumber
that mount mansfield
has ever seen
mmhmm
mm
thank you for going to
a special place with me
carl nargle
cut it
that tree is probably too tall
brace yourself you are going to
get some calls about that
sure let me just slide you
over here a little bit
and it started off
as a winged elm
uhhuh
and then it just became
a white oak
yeah wendy get the painting
its so big
should i put it
put it in the van like you have
the other 6000 times yeah
uh ambrosia
you gave me another 30 minutes
and it wouldve been a sequoia
chuckling oh my goodness
or a redwood
chuckling yeah
mr nargle
yeah right over here
um hi
oh hi
hi
sorry
wow
it it is an honor to
to meet you sir
thank you
you know when i was a kid
my my parents used your show
to teach me
that anything is possible
did they oh
as long as you put
your brushes to it right
laughs
and now here i am
who who is this
its uh ambrosia
isnt she great
shes absolutely fantastic
in three two one
yeah chuckles
okay
wait whats going on
no no no no
whats happening
nothing that
you have to worry about
youre carl nargle
you dont even
have to look behind you
and i mean that literally
and figuratively
lets lets lets go talk
this is
paint with ambrosia
a blank canvas
thats how we all begin
is it intimidating
or is it an opportunity
to create something that
the world has never seen before
if im being honest
its a little of both
but i for one
am thrilled to be joining you
on this journey
of selfdiscovery
so lets paint
a rock
lets paint a rock
when i think of rocks
i like to think about
whats inside first
because thats
what really matters
uh w i i have no doubt
that uh
a little friendly competition
will bring out
the best in you carl
obviously
theres no competition
between you and ambrosia
what im trying to say is uh
the young bull is happy to learn
from the old bull
though inevitably
the young bull will kill
the old bull chuckles
more power to ambrosia
if she can pull it off
that came out wrong
im sorry if im interrupting
uh alexandra moore from
the burlington bonnet
are you ready for the interview
interview
the bonnet series
on vermont state treasures
youre number four
tied with snow
i left a message for you
on your cellphone
i still havent gotten
the hang of using
the answering machine
inside of it
sorry used to be you had
a person take a message for you
mmhmm
uh well is now aa good time
to take me to a special place
where we can talk
carls van
iim sure hes flattered
but hes also in a relationship
iii was speaking
metaphorically i
if you mean the back
of carls van take a number
uh oor we we could go
to your office carl
wow just running through
stop signs incredible
are you guys okay with me
quoting you on this
yeah anything
to help the station
as you may have gathered
my office
is right over here so
i am a bit of a risktaker
and i have never painted
a stump
so im going to do that
for my second painting
two paintings in one hour
not that thats a big deal
why is that such a big deal
nobody paints
two paintings in an hour
it takes paint
to a whole new place
and its been a lot of places
could be our dancing with
the stars shark tank block
oh i love
dancing with the stars
its my favorite show
its been wonderful
talking to you
good night everyone
ouf

to hang out in the beer aisle
if you want to join
she just picked up a case of the
lonelies make em less lonely
if you do it right you dont
even have to leave the store
every stump has roots right
evidence where it started
is that a second painting

incredible
engine starts
sighs
lay no boogie woogie
on the king
dancing with the stars
is my favorite
celebrity dance show
sighs
feedback
sighs
youre entitled
to your favorite tv show
thats what makes
this country great
but my favorite show
is paint with carl nargle
breathes deeply
get in
paint is a lot like life
you got to move on from mistakes
if youre going to be happy
which is why
i am going to add brown
scoffs
i guess jennas going to get
her picture tonight huh
hm did i ever tell you
about the time i got mine
oh god please dont
i mean you have
many times too many
its all a blur but i remember
it like it was yesterday
i know
just maybe dont this time
this one time
hed finished all of his chowder
and most of his bread bowl
and then he turned to me
and he said
you want to touch my sandals
do it
and i said
more than
ive ever wanted anything
do it
his socks didnt stay on
for long either
oh even under the sheet
i could tell it was impressive
do the hustle
and then he mounted it
on my living room wall
for everyone to see
what do you think
oh carl
a oneofakind picture
just for me
but why are the ufo
and the stump covered in blood
because thats art
this is not the kind of thing
people paint on pbs
until we paint again
im ambrosia
thats a lot of blood for a ufo
and a stump
chuckles
how do i know when its done
chuckles
holy moly
and cut
were clear
and cut
were clear
that a ufo
you know
half the people watching
are going to think its
its real
ratings are in
what for ambrosia
h no last week
oh
you know i was just trying
to kind of paint the opposite
of what carl does
mmhmm
and that ended up being a ufo
covered in blood
oh dear goodness
youre katherine
uh
whoa okay so carl said
that you were
his reason for painting
living and loving
burlington bonnet
august 15 1993
wow that was yeah
so long ago

did you say
ufo covered in blood
yeah
so our viewers call the station
a lot when theyre upset
no more blood no more ufos
got it got it
understood
yes
geez ratings

24
chuckles
i dont even know where
the cover sheets are
well i could show you
ii guess what im trying to say
is the stations been
so good to me
and it can do the same for you
i think sometimes its just
being grateful for what we have
without getting stuck
in something
thats not working right
like
like how you dated katherine
and how you dont think
about her
yeah
was that katherine
i dont even
its funny how my eye
doesnt even go to her
since the day
that wendy was hired right
thats when things ended
with katherine
yeah
what started as an innocent
sunset shoulder massage
in the back of a van
at the waters edge
turned into a picture
i never expected to paint
moaning
i have some oils in my purse
shut the curtains
yeah they call me
hot and nasty
yeah they call me
unh
its a good thing katherine
cheated on you first
yeah
so you dont have
to feel guilty

a real man never looks back
i dont
thank you
thanks so much

always
paint from your heart

yeah
etch a sketch a dinosaur

oh i i um
ive been offered a job
at pbs albany

i hope you like this painting
of mount mansfield
on a cold february
late afternoon
gasps
does this mean im your muse
ive always wanted to be

there might be another
tealanddesertsandcolored tv
at the top
of these
goldenrodnumberfive stairs
you sure know your stair colors
barracuda plays
lets slowly
brush back his locks
and lightly caress
the base of this neck
im having a hard time
finding the tv
oh um i forgot
i i moved it into the other
room when i got a bigger bed
oh
slide over to his clavicle
maybe the kisses
are even gentler here
speaking of tvs
i dont know if you heard this
but they are showing paint
on channel 9 in rutland
do you know what that is
i dont get down to rutland
as much as id like
soft blowing in your ear canal
theres not a highway
down there
deeper than expected
lets find out if the curtains
match the drapes
need better gas manage
stomach gurgles
are you okay
i think im going to throw up
okay maybe the highway system
isnt the only thing
moving too fast
i mean from the
from the meat

overlooking mount mansfield
seems impossible
because its
the biggest thing in vermont
but some people do
and they fall in love
with camels hump

the topfour tallest mountains
given the choice i guess
id rather be mount mansfield
thanks for going to a special

my painting show yesterday
i wanted pretzels
no one brought me any tony
carl i know its a period
of adjustment with
with ambrosia here but let me
tell you whats happening
whats happening is people need
to start doing their jobs

is theyre supposed to be doing
im going to keep them

thank you so much for everything
youve done for the station
well
jay fogertys mother
would like to pick him up
in front of the station
in 10 minutes
thats it
thank you
keep those pledges coming
we did it
its for a good cause
look at bridget
lighting up the stage
with her radiant smile
she is a winner
pbs burlington is also smiling
you know mary is also a winner
its such a joy to paint
they both look great
and another great thing
about pbs burlington is
bridgets generosity
which kind of
puts us all to shame
its an honor
for me to be up here painting
someone who bid
so much more than anyone else
thank you bridget
and thank you to mary
i am so grateful
you know she hasnt worked in
eight years so her bid
is actually a higher percentage
of net worth
which you know feels like
the true barometer
bridget
shes not going to be able
to visit her grandkids
this year
cant afford it right
so its a little scary
how much this means to her
thats thats so sad
but you know
mary had to turn off her heat
ill turn off your heat
you never turned it on
never tried to
done
i was already done
how much do we raise
almost 8000
how much do we need
a little less than 300000
ah
mary this is for you
i call it rich in spirit
ive always wanted a laser
bridget are you ready
this is for you
i call it
mighty mount mansfield
on an early surprisingly
chilly april morning
can you see it
why was i smiling
that whole time
thats just the same mountain
you always paint
that doesnt look
anything like me
its the same painting
as valentines day season 8
the creek is smaller
the creek is smaller
that is
because um
carl didnt
want to ruin the surprise
yes you both are actually
getting two paintings
yeah a portrait from me and one
of carls incredible landscapes
we just didnt want either
of you to not get a nargle
he was supposed
to paint my portrait
i spent my snack allowance
for the next eight years
i know bridget but did you
hear what ambrosia said
youre going to get
a portrait by her
as well as this painting
of mighty mount mansfield
and
another 20
just here you go
which brings us to 74 and you
can head over to craft service
and get anything you want
sandwiches some raisins
well shit
you know i get so many
questions about my tote bag
every time im in a restaurant
whats wrong
i know how to save the station
lets add a little smoke
to these chimneys
see if we can make them
even a little cozier
i think ambrosia might be
a little jealous
if she saw you watching this
im just making sure
all your old tapes still play
boy it really takes you back
doesnt it
of course this river
look at that shirt
its really held up
so it has
and that little hamlet is where
i took you for our first date
good memory yeah
great memory
you know i forgot how much
you used to paint
all this other stuff
ice cream stands and
windmills and birds in flight
now its just mount mansfield
in every single painting
hard not to hold on
to a dream or two
why did you do it
i dropped out of college for
us and i was really great
and then i realized that us
was really really you
and you got famous
and then you started to treat me
like everybody else
i mean not bad never bad
just not special
and then someone else paid
so much attention to me
and i made a mistake
music stops
truck squeaking
door rattles
i couldnt live with myself
so i told you
just begged you to forgive me
then like a minute later
you were having sex with wendy
i just spent the rest of my life
watching you make everybody else
in my life
fall in love with you
i just
i wish i would have known
what i should have
done differently
me too
guess who gets to watch
seasons 2 through 8
of paint with carl nargle
sounds like a dream come true
theres a lot of
a lot of good stuff in there
did i do something wrong
you did not
oh hey grab a seat
i have some exciting news
i want to talk to you about
always nice
to hear exciting news
ready
i have found you
an incredible job
what
teaching at
the university of vermont
where you will be passing
along your incredible skills
to students
from around the world
i love the idea of giving back
i mean
that is a big honor right
i just think with my work here
im not going to have the time
exactly
carl our revenues is way down
and youre making
46000 a year
now uvm will give you
a 4000 raise
and heres the best part
we have 22 years of reruns
of your show
people will
never even know you left
its the best of both worlds
so ill host paint
teach at uvm
22 years of reruns
youre going to be showing
youre turning ol carl nargle
into a workhorse
a damn clydesdale
except heres the thing
ambrosia will create the new
shows thatll bring in the kids
your reruns will be there
for our core 65plus audience
you dont have to host a new
episode of paint ever again
but i want to keep painting
you will at uvm
50 students a day watching you
thats a 400 bump in
the 18to25 demo for you
clears throat yeah
i just got a couple
of things for you to sign
saying here you go
right here
saying we didnt go ahead
we didnt fire you
because youre old
good thats very good
thank you carl
thats all i got
clears throat ill see you
sure
door opens closes
carl
hey carl
i just
i wanted to say thank you
you know for paving the way
i had that plate for 30 years
yeah no i used
to see you parked at lums
home of the lumber
you added an e to the mona lisa
but heres the deal
no ones waiting in line
to see the mona e lisa
because thats
a really dumb name
not very original
you never tried to get
painter
no i didnt
and a real artist would
never etchasketch a dinosaur
and then give it to someone
because thats really dumb too
carl you used
your brush to seduce
and destroy people
who loved you
no i opened their car doors
picked up every check
and always carried
the big suitcases
did you ever try
treating them as equals
no
i treated them better than me
its called being a gentleman
until you moved on to the next
because your girlfriend
made a mistake
youre a mistake
youre lucky im an artist
instead of a woman
who says really mean
things to other women
cause i would have plenty
to say to you
plenty
you were an artist
sighs
carls the reason
i started working here
him and because quiznos
wasnt hiring
the place has great hours
he is such a turd
come on
you couldnt afford
to pay his salary
and keep the station going
yeah
sometimes you just have
no choice but to move on
you fill up my senses
if it were up to me youd never
leave the back of this van
god that sounds like heaven
like a walk in the rain
what are you doing
just committing every inch
of you to memory
so i can relive this moment
every moment
for the rest of my life
the way you look the way you
even the texture of
this arm rest
the hum of the space heater
do you smell that
no
transmission fluid
and there isnt much of it
she runs pretty clean
i just i know im always gonna
remember how i feel right now
because i just
i just always want
to feel this way
im ready to feel
how you feel right now
mm
thats the arm rest
what
thats the
clears throat
thats the arm rest
thats it thats me
oh thats all me
i have to ask you something
thats really hard to ask
hello
why didnt you
just paint the portrait
you could just paint one amazing
portrait and blow ambrosia away
its stupid
decided i was going to ask you
to drive me home if you
werent going to answer me
okay
19 years ago
dr bradford lenihan
said the
burlington museum of art
lacked a painting of vermonts
highest peak mount mansfield
and i really really wanted
a painting in that museum
and
so i started painting it
in case he was watching
let me guess
dr bradford lenihan didnt
like the way you painted it
well its
its more complicated
well then i should go
if you dont think
ill understand anything
i dont know i dont know
what do you mean
you dont know
i i dont
i dont know if he ever
watched the show
you never thought to call him
or to walk one of your
thousands of paintings
down to him
over the last 19 years
what if he said no
a real artist follows his heart
no matter what the price
you spent your whole life
playing it safe
and now youve lost everything
everything
and i have
another question for you
thumps
how come we never have sex
people tell me im attractive
youre very attractive
will you just come inside
door closes
the beautiful part is
were moving on together
and once i began teaching
the only reason you care
about me now is because
im the one thing you have left
car horn honks
my uber is here
i dont know what that is
its goodbye
door opens
door slams
im carl nargle and im going
to be your professor
applause
thank you
listen our goal
this semester is pretty simple
i want to help you get
whats in here
and just splash it on to there
dont worry
its not rocket science
its harder
light laughter
is it true that ambrosias
teaching this class with you
well i mean she may stop
by one of these days
you never know
whos going to join us
or where we might be going
so lets get there
sorry if that came out wrong
um
we still want to see you too
thanks
well should we get started
because this canvas
aint going to paint itself
but it would be great to know
when she was coming
just so we could make sure
to be in class
hey can i ask you something
if you were dating somebody
like really young
and really beautiful
whispering why wouldnt you
have sex with them
i was hoping youd talk to me
about ambrosia
its such a mystery
no actually its not
i brought carl his painting
last night and
i imagine having sex with her
is like riding a bike
except instead of pedaling
you just kind of move
back and forth on the seat
ive ridden that kind of bike
and i love bikes
crunching
i have to be somewhere else
now
hi
hey
sighs
you went to carls house
last night
he treated you like crap
and i cheated on him
do you love him
scoffs
i just
i feel like i just wasted
my whole life
not loving someone else
exhales deeply
i kind of set you up to say no
i love you
whats this
why its mount mansfield
this another mount mansfield
sorry just give me one minute
and i will paint you
the best mount mansfield
that you have ever seen
what a showoff
oh no
its so good
clears throat
if you could read
my mind love
what a tale
my thoughts could tell
just like an oldtime movie
about a ghost
from a wishing well
in a castle dark
or a fortress strong
with chains upon my feet
you know that ghost is me
and i will never be set free
as long as im a ghost
you cant see
if i could read
your mind love
what a tale your thoughts
could tell
sighs
car horn blaring
car horn honking
horn blaring continuously
honking
the hero would be me
but heroes often fail
car horn blares
and you wont read
that book again
because the endings
just too hard to take
whats this one
mount mansfield
at night
hows everything going carl
awesome
carl
the facultys been talking
we think what makes
the most sense is to go ahead
and pay you
for the rest of the semester
and end your class today
weve already spoken
with your remaining students
and theyre okay with it
both of them
this is paint with ambrosia
roygbiv
you know when i was a kid
my parents told me that
that was who lived in rainbows
today i know better
because there are no rainbows
sighs
what if ratings go down
tony it is time for me to go
beeping
booth
hey tony its carl
carl
tony what happened to my show
pbs can no longer show people
using tobacco
what
you smoked a pipe
in every episode
we cant air
paint with carl nargle
not even a rerun
tony ive got another call
thats when you get
call waiting
excuse me dr lenihan
hello
mr carl nargle
yeah
to what do i owe the honor
of a visit from a living
vermont state treasure
well i dont know if you heard
but i recently retired
it was in the paper
yeah which means i have 4274
paintings that could use a home
theyre mostly
of mount mansfield
i dont know
if that would interest you
we are always looking to
display the work of a master
here at the
burlington museum of art
great
someone appreciated for
their impact on the world of art
or representing something
unique to vermont
yes wonderful
sadly we just had
the walls painted
and thats something
were showing off too
you know the beauty
of the museum itself
might i offer a suggestion
sure
have you considered
donating them to a motel 6
or perhaps a red roof inn
your paintings have such warmth
and that could really appeal
to a weary traveler on a budget
at the very least it would
save you quite a bit on storage
yeah i i have my own barn
so thats not
anyway uh thank you so much
for your time
dr lenihan
you have a magnificent museum
carl
yeah
can i ask you a question
yeah
whats the image tucked away
in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul feel like
its going to burst
uh
mount mansfield i presume
whatever that thing is
those are the paintings
that keep us from
staring at blank walls
here at the
burlington museum of art
well thank you for stopping by
always great to see
a vermont legend in the flesh
back through the years
i go wandering once again
thats really good
back to
the seasons of my youth
i recall a box of rags
that someone gave us
and how my mama
put the rags to use
there were rags
of many colors
and every piece was small
and i didnt have a coat
and it was way down
in the fall
mama sewed the rags together
sewing every piece with love
she made my coat
of many colors
ahh
as she sewed
she told a story
from the bible she had read
about a coat of many colors
joseph wore
and then she said
perhaps this coat will bring
you good luck and happiness
and i just
couldnt wait to wear it
and mama blessed it
with a kiss
groans
whats the image
tucked away in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul feel like
its going to burst
although we had no money
i was rich as i could be
in my coat of many colors
my mama made for me
whats the image
tucked away in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul feel like
its going to burst
so with patches
on my britches
and holes in both my shoes
in my coat of many colors
whats the image
tucked away in your brain
that makes your heart ache
and your soul
feel like its going to burst
in my coat of many colors
my mama made for me
squeaking
katherine i know this probably
isnt the best time
but if i dont say this now
i never will
when we first met
i painted out of love
my head got turned
hey
i was just on my way to the
to the station
uh how you how you been
some highs some lows
you know i never
i never got to say sorry
for painting mount mansfield
it was all my fault
ambrosia i just want to finish
what i was saying to katherine
actually
i i do need to get going
ill be fast katherine
as you know
im better with pictures
than i am with words
but if i could paint you one
in the form of an apology
its over
ambrosia i thought we were
being nice to each other
now it just feels like
youre rubbing my nose in it
no i mean
were over
she could never love me because
she never stopped loving you
hey carl
beverly
i didnt see that coming
hold on im coming
im coming here we go
nice to see some old friends
yeah well we never got around
to throwing them out
there they are
okay
and here
thats fine
whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
we need this one to air
okay alright
lets roll the open
in three two
hey wheres ambrosia
well she called
and told me to let carl host
i got something i have to say
and this
is my only way to say it
and pbs they need 2 new hours
of programing every day
so we are airing paint
with carl nargle in five
carl
before you say or do anything
you should know im the one
that got your show canceled
katherine if you hadnt
i wouldnt be here right now
hi im carl nargle
and this is paint
i used to always say
you got to paint from the heart
to live from the heart
without doing either
which is why today
i am starting with
tangerine orange 22
why tangerine orange 22
well
because we all have moments
in our lives
moments we wish
we could go back to
and live in forever
mine is in the back of my van
on a custommade sofa bed
with a woman i barely knew
yo its ambrosia why
arent you watching my show
ah just kidding
you know what to do next
but you know what
its a perfect memory
but what made it perfect
are the imperfections
we shared together
pbs burlington
i just want to say
its great to have carl back
yes it is great
to have carl back
please hold pbs burlington
im no longer terrified
watching paint
i agree
carls paintings are
less terrifying than ambrosias
please hold pbs burlington
carl stole my newspaper
yes

is stealing newspapers
please hold pbs burlington
the smell of transmission fluid

all my stuff here
and really looking forward

i know its over
but life goes on
and this old world

warm and tender body
carl
carl
carl carl
burlington museum of art said
they wanted a painting
of mount mansfield
19 years
and i never had the guts
to show them one of mine
you want to know why
yeah why dont you
tell me outside
because the love of my life
stepped out on me
with a
vermont mountain express stud
i couldnt take the idea of not
being a real artist too
carl
that doesnt make you not a man
it means
you got chips
it that doesnt mean
youre not a real man
it means that i made a mistake
no not as many as me
i mean how many
how many body parts
can one man autograph
and i did drugs
thats never the answer
come on carl lets go
you have chips
or you dont have chips
do not have chips carl
the barns on fire
weve got to go
you risked your life for me
im risking my life for you
so you are
mmhmm
goodbye my love
goodbye my darling
lets go come on
tough night for mount mansfield
what drugs did you take carl
the big m
marijuana but i feel fine
i do i do
dont worry about me
i just thought youd be able to
handle it a little bit better
given the amount
of denim that you wear
i didnt
sid and ruben
kind of pushed it on me
i smoked it and then i ate
all the gummy bears
and i dont even like
gummy bears but i feel fine
its just everythings on fire
carl where is the painting
from today
you ran through
the fire to save me you nut
is it in vantastic
youre insane
100 certifiable
katherine youre crazy

in the glove compartment

that was fantastic
its on fire we got to go
laughs
mount mansfield come on
horn honks
oh perfect
horn blaring continuously
go around
go around
horn blaring in background
carl
crunching
tv playing in background
the finest dairy products
in all of the northeast kingdom
make it gerald milk and cheese
meeting or exceeding your
milk and cheese needs
for 46 years
the fire is the lead story
in the news
cnn
um local
when do you leave
um i dont
they offered me
the assistant job
when they found out that
i dont have a college degree
youre not going to take it
mnhmnh
im done settling
oh hold on
heres an update
on the carl nargle story
an unnamed police source
has told channel 31 action news
that carl nargles dna
specifically a large portion
of his hair
was found in the ashes
with all of
his paintings burned
at least we will have his locks
to remember this
vermont state treasure by
and speaking of treasure
every kid treasures presents
and for six
lucky children present
carl nargle is dead
so he is
good morning
how many nargles do you have
i was originally hired
to do graphics
but its more than just
the article in the paper
where you ask if a reporter
wants to have sex with carl
and you personally hosting
two live paintings shows
very poorly
phone ringing
oh well
our overheads way down
so many people quitting
theres some positives there
one sec
pbs burlington
anthony bradford lenihan
calling with my condolences
on the passing of carl nargle
yeah its a tough day
ill be brief
i recently spoke with carl
about showing at burlington
everything was burned
in the fire
which means any surviving
nargles would be quite valuable
the burlington museum of art
cannot be a complete collection
of vermont beauxarts
without at least one nargle
and we are willing
to pay for it
clattering
laughs
please tell me you have one
he made jenna rich
he made you all rich
yeah
should we go inside
yeah
come on laughs
i wish i was dead
its gonna be okay
i say inappropriate things
when im uncomfortable
spits gum
hey im mandy
ambrosias mom
oh hi
aww
this is meemaw
beverly brown
i went to school with
your meemaw
and roll the graphic
and take camera one
our final guest this afternoon
is the new host of paint
please welcome
to the show mary
one of the hosts
of paint donald
im happy to announce that
thanks to a sizable donation
from our new gm wendy
and some technological wizardry
from our new
head of graphics tony
pbs burlington was able to
digitally remove
carl nargles pipe
from his shows
so we can all watch him take us
to his special place forever
and then roll the clip
slowly whirring
put anything in my stew
cause ill eat it
i love a good stew
feel free to draw me a letter
with your favorite stews
always nice to hear
from people back home
the wonders
of technology
knock on door
do you know what thats worth
yup
okay
yes indeed
where do you think he is really
heaven
yeah
you fill up my senses
like a night in the forest
like the mountains
in springtime
there she is miss marcy
like a walk in the rain
what are you gonna share with
us today old friend
looks like someones been
working overtime
car door closes
i got groceries
you feel like grilling
i already put it on
you fill up my senses
how was school
oh it was um
confusing and awful
i tried to warn you years ago
can i tell you something
really really important
yeah
if im never going to
leave here
i think we should
probably get cable
well you know
a man who has the love of
a good blackberry bush
shouldnt need cable
what about a vcr
i think being able
to watch a movie
while youre away could help
make this our special place
oh its already
pretty great for me
come let me love you
what do you think
make the blue red
okay
and what if it was
a little girl
i like it
just promise me
you wont become famous again
well im not going
to sign it carl nargle
he died in a barn
sign it barnsy
rebarnsy
maybe barnsy
maybe blanksy
blanksy
blanksy
meet me
in the middle of the day
let me hear you say
everythings okay
come on out beneath
the shining sun
meet me in
the middle of the night
let me hear you say
everythings alright
sneak on out beneath
the stars and run yeah
oh yeah yes
oh yes
its king and queen
and we must go down round
behind the chandelier
where i wont have
to speak my mind
and you wont have to hear
shreds of news
and afterthoughts
and complicated scenes
well weather down
behind the light
and fade like magazines
oh yeah yeah
i dont believe
in superstars
organic food
and foreign cars
i dont believe
the price of gold
the certainty of growing old
that right is right
and left is wrong
that north and south
cant get along
that east is east
and west is west
and being first
is always best
but i believe in love
i believe in babies
i believe in mom and dad
and i believe in you
well i dont believe
that heaven waits
for only those
who congregate
i like to think of god
as love
hes down below
hes up above
hes watching people
everywhere
he knows who does
and doesnt care
and im an ordinary man
sometimes i wonder who i am
but i believe in love
i believe in music
i believe in magic
and i believe in you
i know with all my certainty
whats going on
with you and me
is a good thing
its true
i believe in you
i dont believe virginity
is as common
as it used to be
in working days
and sleeping nights
that black is black
and white is white
that superman and robin hood
are still alive in hollywood
that gasolines
in short supply
the rising cost
of getting by
but i believe in love
i believe in old folks
i believe in children
