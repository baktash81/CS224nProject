honor your parents 
they re the supreme beings
who gave you life
who sweated
and sacrificed so much
to put a roof
over your head 
food on your plate 
an epic amount of food 
the least you can do
in return is
every single thing
they ask

 be careful 
 honoring your parents

to honor yourself

it s okay  mommy is here 
what s happening to me 
what is it  what    what   
it s happened already 
what did you say 
ming 
it s time 
as you know 
our ancestor  sun yee 
had a mystical connection
with red pandas 
in fact 
she loved them so much
that she asked the gods
to turn her into one 
it was wartime 
the men were all gone 
sun yee
was desperate for a way
to protect herself
and her daughters 
then one night 
during a red moon 
the gods granted her wish 
they gave her the ability
to harness her emotions
to transform into a powerful 
mystical beast 
she was able
to fend off bandits 
protect her village 
and save her family from ruin 
sun yee passed this gift
to her daughters 
for when they came of age 
and they passed it to theirs 
but over time 
our family chose
to come to a new world 
and what was a blessing
became   
an inconvenience 
are you serious 
  no 
  mei mei  no 
  it s a curse 
  she meant it as a blessing 
you cursed us 
it s all your fault 
mei mei  stop 
listen to me  listen 
there s a cure 
really  how do you know 
because it happened to me 
why didn t you warn me 
i thought i had more time 
you re just a child 
i thought  if i watched you
like a hawk 
i d see the signs
and be able to prepare 
but it s going to be fine 
i overcame it
and you will too 
on the next red moon 
you ll undergo a ritual
that will seal
your red panda spirit
into one of these 
and then
you ll be cured for good 
just like me 
but any strong emotion
will release the panda 
and the more you release it 
the more difficult
the ritual will be 
there is a darkness
to the panda  mei mei 
you only have
one chance to banish it 
and you cannot fail 
otherwise 
you ll never be free 
let s see  the next red moon
will be the 25th 
that s a whole month away 
we ll wait it out together 
and i ll be with you
every step of the way 
not bad 
i saved wilfred 
thanks  dad 
it s only temporary  mei mei 
this way  we won t worry about
any more accidents  hmm

thank you  aunties 
your hair is so thick

what a surprise
that you all came so early 
you need all the help
you can get  ming 
so  mei mei 
you ve been managing
to keep the panda in 
  yep  totally 
  really 
what s that  lily 
well  it s a little hard
to believe
that mei mei
could control such a beast 
she s just a child 
it s true 
and if mei mei s panda
is anything like ming s   
mei mei s better
than any of us
at controlling the panda 
she passed every trigger test 
even the kitten box 
  oh 
  oh  my goodness 
  that s unbelievable 
  impressive 
she just thinks
of my love for her 
and it gives her the strength
to stay calm 
exactly 
  aw 
  how sweet 
how sweet 
anyway 
thanks for all the gifts 
but i think i ll go
to bed early 
keeping that animal
locked down

mei mei 
i know what you re doing 
i know how hard it is
to keep the beast in 
it feels so good
to let it out  so free 
but each time you do 
the stronger it gets 
and then you ll be
bound to it forever 
and the ritual will fail 
has that ever happened 
it cannot happen 
your mother and i
were close once 
but the red panda
took that away 
i couldn t bear to see
