the farm life may be it for you 
but it sure ain t for me 
i m special 
mama s gonna feel real stupid
when she finds out  won t she 
one day  the whole world s
gonna know my name 
you agree  don t you  mary 
oh  why  thank you 
i do love a good audience 
y all see me for who i really am 
what are you doing in here  mr  goose 
theda 
go on  girl 
take it 
you aren t to indulge
in any more such foolishness 
it s just dancing  mama 
it s selfish is what it is 
with all the farmhands gone 
i can t do everything around here myself 
i help 
anything for me in the post today 
no 
it says the allies have
taken control of france 
you can read it after supper 
but  mama  this could mean
the end of the war 
do as i ask  pearl 
i don t want to hear about
any more dead germans tonight 
supper s ready  daddy 
bless us  o  lord  and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty
through christ our lord  amen 
amen 
 my precious pearl 
it feels as if it has been
an eternity without you 
all we do is walk  it seems 
i never know if we ll get
to where they say we re going 
they have us chew on bouillon cubes
so we don t notice the pains in our feet 
i find it most frightening
at night in the trenches 
the mortar shells are deafening 
many soldiers have gone mad with the fear 
carnage from the gas has shown me things
i won t soon forget 
and thinking of you
has been my only reprieve 
i will always be proud
to serve my country 
but one thing this war has made clear
is that i cannot wait to return home
and begin our life together 
i never want to be away from you again 
till death do us part 
your loving husband  howard  
i ll go to town tomorrow 
pick up more medicine 
which means i get to stop by the pictures 
just don t tell mama 
they show all the best dancers
at the pictures 
i could be on the line
with those girls one day 
i know i could 
pearl 
i didn t want to waste the hot water 
the money for his medicine
is on the kitchen table 
remember to cover your face 
and don t linger close to anyone 
papers are warning of a lethal resurgence 
god forbid sickness returns to our home 
the time is now   
two bits  please 
poor johnny s heart
went pitty  pitty pat
somewhere in sunny france
he met a girl by chance
with ze naughty  naughty glance
she looked just like a kitty  kitty cat
she loved to dance and play
tho  he learned no french
when he left the trench
he knew well enough to say
oui  oui  marie
will you do zis for me 
oui  oui  marie   
did you enjoy the picture 
cigarette 
oh  go on  i don t have the bug 
you like the movies 
i like dancing 
oh  a future tiller girl 
i can see it now 
i wish 
why not  you re pretty enough 
on account of a husband  i gather 
he s overseas 
but my father s infirmed 
so i have to help at home 
i m sorry to hear that 
you want to come watch the second show 
free admission 
i m the projectionist 
i need to get going 
mama s expecting me 
but i appreciate the   
stay there for just one minute  would you 
okay 
from what you just saw 
aren t you showing it again 
ah  sure  but it s only one frame 
nobody will notice
once i splice it back together 
you know  caring for your family
during these times is admirable 
you ought to take pride in that 
but don t forget to live your life  too 
i wouldn t mind seeing you
up on that screen one day  missus   
pearl 
well  if you come back 
knock on this door 
i m always here  and  well  i can
run the pictures as much as i like 
thank you  i will 
may i have this dance 
i m married 
what took you so long 
it s a far ride  mama 
what is on your head 
found it along the road 
do not bring it inside 
it may be covered in germs 
wash your hair 
if you re lucky  it s only full of lice 
when you finish 
your father needs changing 
don t let him sit in his mess 
i saw a new picture today 
you d have liked it 
the girls were all flawless 
there s no room for even the tiniest
lack of precision in a troupe like that 
it takes absolute perfection 
what a charmed life it must be
to star in the movies 
are you still in there 
bless us  o  lord  and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty
through christ our lord  amen 
amen 
where is the rest of the money i lent you 
  there was none 
  i can count  pearl 
there are eight cents missing 
i may have gotten some hard candy
for the trip home 
that is enough  then 
you ate the candy  that was your supper 
the food i worked hard
to prepare alone is not 
but  mama  i rode all that way 
i m starving 
you may have what s left of it
in the morning 
  where are you going 
  to bed 
i did not excuse you from the table 
i know that  and i am careful 
good 
please  lord 
make me the biggest star
the world has ever known 
so that i may get far  far away
from this place 
amen 
afternoon  pearl 
hi  mitsy  i like your dress 
oh  thank you 
it feels wonderful to finally be able
to don something pretty again 
it s the first time
we ve left home in weeks 
mother is so afraid of getting ill 
mama  too 
well  we were a bit worried about
the both of you being out here all alone 
so we brought some food 
  that s very kind 
  how have you been getting on 
any new letters from howard 
oh  well 
mother has been riddled with worry 
they say no news is good news  though 
if only his pride hadn t gotten him
involved in this dreadful war 
you know we had a doctor
willing to declare him ineligible 
anyone would ve taken that opportunity 
not howard 
first  he runs off to become a farmer 
now  the army 
the lengths my brother will go
to just to spite his father 
all this isolation has been enough
to make one mad  hasn t it 
it really has 
no  we don t accept charity 
oh  for god s sake  ruth  it s just a pig 
can i share a secret with you  pearl 
mother would throttle me if she knew
i was planning on attending 
but there s a dance audition this saturday
at our church for a christmas chorus line
to bring merriment to folks
throughout the state during the holidays 
word is  they re putting together a troupe
and will be touring seven different cities
before the year ends 
don t that sound exciting 
  i would love so much to be a part of it 
  so would i 
we should go together then 
but you can t tell a soul 
i would never 
splendid  it ll be our secret 
mitsy 
i better skedaddle  we got three more pigs
to drop off this afternoon 
  saturday at 11 00 
  okay 
sister in laws have
to stick together  right 
mitsy 
  time to go 
  see you later  pearl 
bye  mitsy 
charlie  this could be it 
pearl 
pearl 
well 
i didn t expect
to see you again this soon 
have a seat 
i can t believe you get to see
the pictures every day for free 
yeah  not a bad gig  huh 
thank you 
so  to what do i owe this pleasure 
i ve been thinking a lot about
what you said to me the other day 
about not forgetting
to live my life  and  well 
there s a dance audition
coming up at the church 
oh  i like the sound of that 
so do i 
but i ve never really danced
in front of anyone before 
what if i m not perfect 
you can do anything
if you want it bad enough 
i want it 
then don t let anything stand in your way 
what would you like to see 
palace follies 
oh  come on  you saw that already 
how about something different tonight 
how about   
how about a film nobody else has seen 
okay 
i picked this one up
while i was in the service in france 
do you live in here 
i lay my head on that pillow
from time to time 
but i wouldn t say
i live anywhere in particular 
i m what more civilized people
refer to as bohemian 
i don t know what that is 
it means i can pack up and leave
whenever i want to 
sounds like a dream 
just as long as i can keep from waking up 
  what is this 
  just watch 
never seen anything like that
before now  have you 
there are all kinds of underground
stag films like this out there 
  is it legal 
  doing it  yeah 
filming it  no 
not here  anyway  it will be eventually 
people would pay an arm and a leg
to see this 
pictures like this are going
to revolutionize the industry
and i  for one  plan
on capitalizing early 
it s reality 
there s no denying
we all share a fascination
in seeing people as they truly are 
i don t like reality 
where i live  i mean 
so  leave 
it s not that easy 
well  sure it is 
there s a road right out front there
that ll take you
all the way to new york city 
one day my mother and father will be gone 
  i can do what i want then 
  what if that s too late 
the fact of the matter is  pearl 
you only get one take at this life 
and if you don t make the most of it
when you re young 
you don t get a second chance 
if only they would just die   
pardon 
nothing 
it s real nice to be able to talk
to someone for a change 
been cooped up on that farm for so long 
sometimes i worry that maybe
i m not the same as other people 
why would you ever want to be
like everybody else 
i don t know 
sometimes it just seems
more peaceful  i guess 
did you mean what you said 
about wanting to see me up on that screen 
sure  i did 
i d do anything to be up there 
well  then you ought to go overseas
when this pandemic ends 
that s what i m doing 
the arts are so much more alive in europe 
you can be whoever you want to be there 
really 
you could even be in pictures like this 
i know i d watch you 
i should go now 
thank you 
what for 
for seeing me tonight 
what are you staring at 
theda 
i m leaving soon 
i can t stay here any longer 
howard was supposed to take me away 
it d be easier for me if i didn t feel
like i was abandoning you 
you understand that 
i love you  daddy 
but this is no way to live 
pearl 
what are you doing 
talking with daddy 
we need to get him back to the house 
why do you hate me  mama 
i only want what s best 
when do i get what i want 
one day you ll understand that getting
what you want isn t what s important 
making the most of what you have is 
life rarely turns out how you expect 
you need to be prepared for that
if you ever want to be happy 
come back inside 
where are you 
stop staring at me 
how d you find that 
i am not blind
to what goes on around here 
take your dinner  stay in the bunkhouse 
but it s freezing out there 
you should ve thought of that
before putting me at risk 
isolate yourself
until we know you re not ill 
that is what s right 
there s a dance audition in town tomorrow 
  i m going to it 
  no  you re not 
  yes  i am 
  why 
find out if i m good enough 
good enough for what  pearl 
something more than this 
where does all this ungratefulness
stem from 
how is it you find our life
so beneath you 
you ve always had a roof over your head 
food in your belly 
do you not think that came
at great sacrifice from your father and i 
or do you think we are beneath you  too 
if i m meant to live out
the rest of my days with you
and daddy on this farm 
then so be it  but i m only young once 
if i go to this audition
and i don t get picked 
then i ll come home
and i ll never speak of it again  i swear 
but i have to know that i tried
or i m gonna regret it my whole life 
please  mama 
you have no idea what i m capable of 
oh  yes  i do 
i ve seen the things
you ve done in private 
when you believe no one is watching 
you think others won t notice 
you can t keep your true self
hidden forever  pearl 
they will notice eventually 
and they will be frightened  just as i am 
  you re wrong 
  am i 
then what a fine woman you hope to become 
leaving your mother alone to rot
so you can dance
with a bunch of city whores 
let alone the illness
you may contract and spread 
you ve seen what it does to your father 
that s what you want
for yourself and others 
and maybe that is what you wish for me 
  of course not 
  stop lying 
i can t stand the sound of it anymore 
it s almost as abhorrent
as your sinful behavior 
you are not well  pearl 
it s only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else 
malevolence is festering in you  i see it 
and i will not  in good conscience 
let you leave this farm again 
  you can t stop me 
  oh  yes  i can 
you don t want to know
what i could do to you 
i shoulder a burden
you will never understand 
spend my days feeding and wiping the snot
off the face of the man i married 
you dare sit there
and talk to me about regret 
i was supposed to be his wife 
not his mother 
don t you ever speak that way to me again 
do you hear me 
  i m sorry 
  no  you re not 
or you would stop all this 
here  take it 
that s what you really desire  isn t it 
perhaps i should kill him for you 
that way you don t have
to care for him any longer 
would that suit
your selfish dreams better 
then we can both go to the dance audition 
your husband is gone  so is mine 
why should we be saddled with caring
for them or the work of this farm 
what about us getting what we want 
i won t suffer for you any longer 
you want to leave  go 
but when you fail 
and you will fail 
i want you to remember what it feels like
because that s how i feel
every time i look at you 
nearly everything i ever had
has been taken from me  pearl 
what more do you want 
i just don t want
to end up like you  is all 
i hate you 
you harlot 
i won t let you flaunt
your arrogance in my face 
  you are not better than me 
  yes  i am 
i m going to be a star 
the whole world is going to know my name 
where are you going 
it s not even 6 00 a m  yet 
i have to practice my routine 
i need to be perfect
for my audition today 
you still think i m pretty enough 
oh  not much has changed
in the last 24 hours 
yes  it has 
oh  you forgot this last time 
i m glad you came back 
so am i 
let me at least drive you home 
somebody you know 
i m not really sure 
well 
it s hard to know who anyone is nowadays
with all these masks people are wearing 
wait here a minute 
daddy  i m so sorry 
i m going to get you cleaned up  okay 
i just have a guest right now 
okay  come in 
this is my father 
pleased to meet you  sir

when can we go 
  don t you think you should go check 
  no 
all right  i m sorry 
whatever that is  we can t just ignore it 
it could be your father 
for christ s sake 
it s not my father 
please don t go 
what s the matter with you 
nothing

i named each of them
after my favorite picture stars 
i ve put on so many shows
for them over the years 
it ll be sad to say goodbye 
but like they say 
 if you re not moving forward in business 
you re moving backwards  
we used to have many more animals 
but they all died 
what about your dog 
  what s its name 
  we don t have a dog 
i thought you said you did  in the cellar 
right  yeah

now s not the time to be
resting on your laurels  is it 
nice seeing you  pearl 
did i do something wrong 
then why did you just go cold on me 
i don t know what you mean 
what did you see 
i didn t see anything 
you re lying

look  i ve got to get back

what did i do wrong 
  nothing  calm down

if i didn t do anything wrong 
i don t understand 
i thought you liked me

nothing s going to keep me here

thank you for everything 
i know you ll look down on me proudly

for going on the road 
wow  you re confident 
rumor has it they may only be
taking one gal per town

well  if it s not me 
then i hope it s you  right 
it has to be me 
next

can t say i m too saddened for her 
some people just think
they re god s gift  you know 
but they always get
what s coming to them eventually 
i feel bad saying that  actually 
she s a nurse 
i don t know how to do
something like that 
oh  pearl  i m so nervous 
what if they laugh me right off stage 
i don t think i could handle that 
how are you not scared 
i guess i m just more used to the feeling 
next 
oh  lord

pearl 
pearl 
how about i take you home 
is that our pig 
should i go and fetch your mother 
how about i get you
something nice to drink 
mama was right 
i m never getting off this farm 
and where would you want to go 
  europe 
  europe 
what on earth for 
it ll be in ruins and you ll never get
howard back there  i ll tell you 
oh  come on  now 
i know you re disappointed 
but there s no sense taking it this hard 
it s just a lousy old church group 
those old dolts 
they don t know the first thing
about quality dancing 
you don t understand 
what don t i 
come on  pearl 
what s really the matter 
i don t feel well 
you re not coming down
with something  are you 
no  it s nothing like that 
oh  thank goodness 
if i snuck out of the house and ended up
bringing home nothing but the germ 
my mother and father would just kill me 
i m worried there may be something
real wrong with me  mitsy 
how do you mean 
seems like there s something missing in me
that the rest of the world has 
have you told howard 
i ve never spoken about it
out loud to anyone 
so afraid of what people might think 
pearl 
howard s your husband 
he adores you 
you shouldn t be afraid
to tell him how you feel 
i m scared of what i might say 
well  practice on me first  then 
pretend i m howard 
and you just say whatever s on your mind 
  i can t 
  yes  you can 
go on  get it all out 
  really 
  yes 
trust me 
howard   
go ahead  pearl 
i hate you so much for leaving me here 
sometimes i hope you die 
i m sorry 
i feel awful admitting that 
but it s the truth 
i was curious
about other men 
i m sure you don t want to hear
about a stranger satisfying your wife 
and i swear it was only once 
it was a mistake 
it wasn t him that i wanted 
i know that now 
and i wish things could just go back
to the way they were before 
but i don t see how they could 
not after the things i ve done 
  what else have you done  pearl 
  oh  howard 
i realize how this all must sound 
honestly  there was a time i was flattered
to have someone as handsome as you
pine over me 
you re such a good person  i know that 
i made sure to always be mindful
with your heart 
i never wanted you to feel jealous 
it s an awful feeling 
like a rot  the way it just twists
and turns at your insides 
i know that aching so well 
i feel it
whenever i see others
whose lives come easy 
because the truth is 
i m not really a good person 
pearl  i think i should just   
the reason i kept my eyes
to the ground around other men
was never to avoid hurting you 
it s because i understood
how lucky i was to have your attention 
i may be a poor farm girl  howard 
but i m not stupid 
i spotted you the moment
you came to live with us 
you worked hard like the other farmhands 
but you were different 
you re from somewhere 
a nice  comfortable place that you could
return to whenever you wanted 
i m so desperate to have that 
all my life  i ve wanted off this farm
and you were my ticket out 
so i made sure to never let you see
who i really was 
it worked like a charm  too 
then  when you finally brought me back
to your home to meet your family 
it was just as i hoped 
a life straight out of the pictures 
at least that s what it felt like to me 
and you didn t want it 
you just wanted to stay here on our farm 
and that made me so angry 
how could you  i m certain
you knew i hated it  you must ve 
how could you be so selfish and cruel
after all i ve done to make you happy 
i was even pregnant with your baby 
i never wanted to be a mother 
i loathed the feeling of it
growing inside me 
it felt like sickness 
pulling and sucking on me
like some needy animal in a barn 
how could i be responsible
for another life 
life terrifies me 
it s harsh  and bleak  and draining 
i was so relieved when it died 
it was one less weight
keeping me trapped here 
but then the war came
and you left me  too 
why did you leave me  howard 
i hate feeling like this  so pathetic 
do people like you ever feel this way 
i figure you don t 
you seem so perfect all the time 
lord must ve been generous to you 
he never answers any of my prayers 
i don t know why  what did i do 
what is wrong with me 
please  just tell me
so maybe i can get better 
i don t want to end up like mama 
i want to be dancing up on the screen
like the pretty gals in the pictures 
i want what they have so badly 
to be perfect 
to be loved from as many people
as possible 
to make up for all my time
spent suffering 
i wake in the middle of the night
and the fear washes over me 
 cause what if this is it 
what if this is right where i belong 
i m a failure 
i m not pretty
or naturally pleasant  or friendly 
i m not smart  or funny  or confident 
i m exactly what mama said i was  weak 
i don t know why  what did i do 
why wasn t my family like yours 
i hate what it feels like to be me
and not you 
i m so scared
that when you finally come home 
you ll see me and be frightened
like everyone else is 
i know what i ve done 
the bad things 
terrible  awful  murderous things 
i regret them now 
but i liked how they felt 
i wish i didn t  but i did 
at first  it was only animals
smaller than myself 
nothing with feelings 
nothing that could hurt me back 
it felt good 
killing s easier than you think 
till recently with mama
and the boy from the picture house 
they were different 
they were more meaningful 
i hurt them  so they  too  might know
what it feels like to suffer 
but poor daddy didn t deserve that 
i wish i hadn t done what i did 
mama meant well 
she had a hard life 
she only wanted a home to feel safe in 
i can see that 
i thought i hated her 
but i just want to feel safe  too 
i made such a mess of things 
i don t know how much more i can take 
i need to clean this up 
all of it 
i need to make things right
before you see me again 
maybe if i can turn this farm
into a home for us like you wanted 
things will finally be different 
i can forgive 
i can be who you want me to be
if you ll just stay with me 
would you do that  please
