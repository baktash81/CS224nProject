the farm life may be it for you
but it sure aint for me
im special
mamas gonna feel real stupid
when she finds out wont she
one day the whole worlds
gonna know my name
you agree dont you mary
oh why thank you
i do love a good audience
yall see me for who i really am
what are you doing in here mr goose
theda
go on girl
take it
you arent to indulge
in any more such foolishness
its just dancing mama
its selfish is what it is
with all the farmhands gone
i cant do everything around here myself
i help
anything for me in the post today
no
it says the allies have
taken control of france
you can read it after supper
but mama this could mean
the end of the war
do as i ask pearl
i dont want to hear about
any more dead germans tonight
suppers ready daddy
bless us o lord and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty
through christ our lord amen
amen
my precious pearl
it feels as if it has been
an eternity without you
all we do is walk it seems
i never know if well get
to where they say were going
they have us chew on bouillon cubes
so we dont notice the pains in our feet
i find it most frightening
at night in the trenches
the mortar shells are deafening
many soldiers have gone mad with the fear
carnage from the gas has shown me things
i wont soon forget
and thinking of you
has been my only reprieve
i will always be proud
to serve my country
but one thing this war has made clear
is that i cannot wait to return home
and begin our life together
i never want to be away from you again
till death do us part
your loving husband howard
ill go to town tomorrow
pick up more medicine
which means i get to stop by the pictures
just dont tell mama
they show all the best dancers
at the pictures
i could be on the line
with those girls one day
i know i could
pearl
i didnt want to waste the hot water
the money for his medicine
is on the kitchen table
remember to cover your face
and dont linger close to anyone
papers are warning of a lethal resurgence
god forbid sickness returns to our home
the time is now
twobits please
poor johnnys heart
went pitty pitty pat
somewhere in sunny france
he met a girl by chance
with ze naughty naughty glance
she looked just like a kitty kitty cat
she loved to dance and play
tho he learned no french
when he left the trench
he knew well enough to say
oui oui marie
will you do zis for me
oui oui marie
did you enjoy the picture
cigarette
oh go on i dont have the bug
you like the movies
i like dancing
oh a future tiller girl
i can see it now
i wish
why not youre pretty enough
on account of a husband i gather
hes overseas
but my fathers infirmed
so i have to help at home
im sorry to hear that
you want to come watch the second show
free admission
im the projectionist
i need to get going
mamas expecting me
but i appreciate the
stay there for just one minute would you
okay
from what you just saw
arent you showing it again
ah sure but its only one frame
nobody will notice
once i splice it back together
you know caring for your family
during these times is admirable
you ought to take pride in that
but dont forget to live your life too
i wouldnt mind seeing you
up on that screen one day missus
pearl
well if you come back
knock on this door
im always here and well i can
run the pictures as much as i like
thank you i will
may i have this dance
im married
what took you so long
its a far ride mama
what is on your head
found it along the road
do not bring it inside
it may be covered in germs
wash your hair
if youre lucky its only full of lice
when you finish
your father needs changing
dont let him sit in his mess
i saw a new picture today
youd have liked it
the girls were all flawless
theres no room for even the tiniest
lack of precision in a troupe like that
it takes absolute perfection
what a charmed life it must be
to star in the movies
are you still in there
bless us o lord and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty
through christ our lord amen
amen
where is the rest of the money i lent you
there was none
i can count pearl
there are eight cents missing
i may have gotten some hard candy
for the trip home
that is enough then
you ate the candy that was your supper
the food i worked hard
to prepare alone is not
but mama i rode all that way
im starving
you may have whats left of it
in the morning
where are you going
to bed
i did not excuse you from the table
i know that and i am careful
good
please lord
make me the biggest star
the world has ever known
so that i may get far far away
from this place
amen
afternoon pearl
hi mitsy i like your dress
oh thank you
it feels wonderful to finally be able
to don something pretty again
its the first time
weve left home in weeks
mother is so afraid of getting ill
mama too
well we were a bit worried about
the both of you being out here all alone
so we brought some food
thats very kind
how have you been getting on
any new letters from howard
oh well
mother has been riddled with worry
they say no news is good news though
if only his pride hadnt gotten him
involved in this dreadful war
you know we had a doctor
willing to declare him ineligible
anyone wouldve taken that opportunity
not howard
first he runs off to become a farmer
now the army
the lengths my brother will go
to just to spite his father
all this isolation has been enough
to make one mad hasnt it
it really has
no we dont accept charity
oh for gods sake ruth its just a pig
can i share a secret with you pearl
mother would throttle me if she knew
i was planning on attending
but theres a dance audition this saturday
at our church for a christmas chorus line
to bring merriment to folks
throughout the state during the holidays
word is theyre putting together a troupe
and will be touring seven different cities
before the year ends
dont that sound exciting
i would love so much to be a part of it
so would i
we should go together then
but you cant tell a soul
i would never
splendid itll be our secret
mitsy
i better skedaddle we got three more pigs
to drop off this afternoon
saturday at 1100
okay
sisterinlaws have
to stick together right
mitsy
time to go
see you later pearl
bye mitsy
charlie this could be it
pearl
pearl
well
i didnt expect
to see you again this soon
have a seat
i cant believe you get to see
the pictures every day for free
yeah not a bad gig huh
thank you
so to what do i owe this pleasure
ive been thinking a lot about
what you said to me the other day
about not forgetting
to live my life and well
theres a dance audition
coming up at the church
oh i like the sound of that
so do i
but ive never really danced
in front of anyone before
what if im not perfect
you can do anything
if you want it bad enough
i want it
then dont let anything stand in your way
what would you like to see
palace follies
oh come on you saw that already
how about something different tonight
how about
how about a film nobody else has seen
okay
i picked this one up
while i was in the service in france
do you live in here
i lay my head on that pillow
from time to time
but i wouldnt say
i live anywhere in particular
im what more civilized people
refer to as bohemian
i dont know what that is
it means i can pack up and leave
whenever i want to
sounds like a dream
just as long as i can keep from waking up
what is this
just watch
never seen anything like that
before now have you
there are all kinds of underground
stag films like this out there
is it legal
doing it yeah
filming it no
not here anyway it will be eventually
people would pay an arm and a leg
to see this
pictures like this are going
to revolutionize the industry
and i for one plan
on capitalizing early
its reality
theres no denying
we all share a fascination
in seeing people as they truly are
i dont like reality
where i live i mean
so leave
its not that easy
well sure it is
theres a road right out front there
thatll take you
all the way to new york city
one day my mother and father will be gone
i can do what i want then
what if thats too late
the fact of the matter is pearl
you only get one take at this life
and if you dont make the most of it
when youre young
you dont get a second chance
if only they would just die
pardon
nothing
its real nice to be able to talk
to someone for a change
been cooped up on that farm for so long
sometimes i worry that maybe
im not the same as other people
why would you ever want to be
like everybody else
i dont know
sometimes it just seems
more peaceful i guess
did you mean what you said
about wanting to see me up on that screen
sure i did
id do anything to be up there
well then you ought to go overseas
when this pandemic ends
thats what im doing
the arts are so much more alive in europe
you can be whoever you want to be there
really
you could even be in pictures like this
i know id watch you
i should go now
thank you
what for
for seeing me tonight
what are you staring at
theda
im leaving soon
i cant stay here any longer
howard was supposed to take me away
itd be easier for me if i didnt feel
like i was abandoning you
you understand that
i love you daddy
but this is no way to live
pearl
what are you doing
talking with daddy
we need to get him back to the house
why do you hate me mama
i only want whats best
when do i get what i want
one day youll understand that getting
what you want isnt whats important
making the most of what you have is
life rarely turns out how you expect
you need to be prepared for that
if you ever want to be happy
come back inside
where are you
stop staring at me
howd you find that
i am not blind
to what goes on around here
take your dinner stay in the bunkhouse
but its freezing out there
you shouldve thought of that
before putting me at risk
isolate yourself
until we know youre not ill
that is whats right
theres a dance audition in town tomorrow
im going to it
no youre not
yes i am
why
find out if im good enough
good enough for what pearl
something more than this
where does all this ungratefulness
stem from
how is it you find our life
so beneath you
youve always had a roof over your head
food in your belly
do you not think that came
at great sacrifice from your father and i
or do you think we are beneath you too
if im meant to live out
the rest of my days with you
and daddy on this farm
then so be it but im only young once
if i go to this audition
and i dont get picked
then ill come home
and ill never speak of it again i swear
but i have to know that i tried
or im gonna regret it my whole life
please mama
you have no idea what im capable of
oh yes i do
ive seen the things
youve done in private
when you believe no one is watching
you think others wont notice
you cant keep your true self
hidden forever pearl
they will notice eventually
and they will be frightened just as i am
youre wrong
am i
then what a fine woman you hope to become
leaving your mother alone to rot
so you can dance
with a bunch of city whores
let alone the illness
you may contract and spread
youve seen what it does to your father
thats what you want
for yourself and others
and maybe that is what you wish for me
of course not
stop lying
i cant stand the sound of it anymore
its almost as abhorrent
as your sinful behavior
you are not well pearl
its only a matter of time
before you hurt someone else
malevolence is festering in you i see it
and i will not in good conscience
let you leave this farm again
you cant stop me
oh yes i can
you dont want to know
what i could do to you
i shoulder a burden
you will never understand
spend my days feeding and wiping the snot
off the face of the man i married
you dare sit there
and talk to me about regret
i was supposed to be his wife
not his mother
dont you ever speak that way to me again
do you hear me
im sorry
no youre not
or you would stop all this
here take it
thats what you really desire isnt it
perhaps i should kill him for you
that way you dont have
to care for him any longer
would that suit
your selfish dreams better
then we can both go to the dance audition
your husband is gone so is mine
why should we be saddled with caring
for them or the work of this farm
what about us getting what we want
i wont suffer for you any longer
you want to leave go
but when you fail
and you will fail
i want you to remember what it feels like
because thats how i feel
every time i look at you
nearly everything i ever had
has been taken from me pearl
what more do you want
i just dont want
to end up like you is all
i hate you
you harlot
i wont let you flaunt
your arrogance in my face
you are not better than me
yes i am
im going to be a star
the whole world is going to know my name
where are you going
its not even 600 am yet
i have to practice my routine
i need to be perfect
for my audition today
you still think im pretty enough
oh not much has changed
in the last 24 hours
yes it has
oh you forgot this last time
im glad you came back
so am i
let me at least drive you home
somebody you know
im not really sure
well
its hard to know who anyone is nowadays
with all these masks people are wearing
wait here a minute

pearl
how about i take you home
is that our pig
should i go and fetch your mother
how about i get you
something nice to drink
mama was right
im never getting off this farm
and where would you want to go
europe
europe
what on earth for
itll be in ruins and youll never get
howard back there ill tell you
oh come on now
i know youre disappointed
but theres no sense taking it this hard
its just a lousy old church group
those old dolts
they dont know the first thing
about quality dancing
you dont understand
what dont i
come on pearl
whats really the matter
i dont feel well
youre not coming down
with something are you
no its nothing like that
oh thank goodness
if i snuck out of the house and ended up
bringing home nothing but the germ
my mother and father would just kill me
im worried there may be something
real wrong with me mitsy
how do you mean
seems like theres something missing in me
that the rest of the world has
have you told howard
ive never spoken about it
out loud to anyone
so afraid of what people might think
pearl
howards your husband
he adores you
you shouldnt be afraid
to tell him how you feel
im scared of what i might say
well practice on me first then
pretend im howard
and you just say whatevers on your mind
i cant
yes you can
go on get it all out
really
yes
trust me
howard
go ahead pearl
i hate you so much for leaving me here
sometimes i hope you die
im sorry
i feel awful admitting that
but its the truth
i was curious
about other men
im sure you dont want to hear
about a stranger satisfying your wife
and i swear it was only once
it was a mistake
it wasnt him that i wanted
i know that now
and i wish things could just go back
to the way they were before
but i dont see how they could
not after the things ive done
what else have you done pearl
oh howard
i realize how this all must sound
honestly there was a time i was flattered
to have someone as handsome as you
pine over me
youre such a good person i know that
i made sure to always be mindful
with your heart
i never wanted you to feel jealous
its an awful feeling
like a rot the way it just twists
and turns at your insides
i know that aching so well
i feel it
whenever i see others
whose lives come easy
because the truth is
im not really a good person
pearl i think i should just
the reason i kept my eyes
to the ground around other men
was never to avoid hurting you
its because i understood
how lucky i was to have your attention
i may be a poor farm girl howard
but im not stupid
i spotted you the moment
you came to live with us
you worked hard like the other farmhands
but you were different
youre from somewhere
a nice comfortable place that you could
return to whenever you wanted
im so desperate to have that
all my life ive wanted off this farm
and you were my ticket out
so i made sure to never let you see
who i really was
it worked like a charm too
then when you finally brought me back
to your home to meet your family
it was just as i hoped
a life straight out of the pictures
at least thats what it felt like to me
and you didnt want it
you just wanted to stay here on our farm
and that made me so angry
how could you im certain
you knew i hated it you mustve
how could you be so selfish and cruel
after all ive done to make you happy
i was even pregnant with your baby
i never wanted to be a mother
i loathed the feeling of it
growing inside me
it felt like sickness
pulling and sucking on me
like some needy animal in a barn
how could i be responsible
for another life
life terrifies me
its harsh and bleak and draining
i was so relieved when it died
it was one less weight
keeping me trapped here
but then the war came
and you left me too
why did you leave me howard
i hate feeling like this so pathetic
do people like you ever feel this way
i figure you dont
you seem so perfect all the time
lord mustve been generous to you
he never answers any of my prayers
i dont know why what did i do
what is wrong with me
please just tell me
so maybe i can get better
i dont want to end up like mama
i want to be dancing up on the screen
like the pretty gals in the pictures
i want what they have so badly
to be perfect
to be loved from as many people
as possible
to make up for all my time
spent suffering
i wake in the middle of the night
and the fear washes over me
cause what if this is it
what if this is right where i belong
im a failure
im not pretty
or naturally pleasant or friendly
im not smart or funny or confident
im exactly what mama said i was weak
i dont know why what did i do
why wasnt my family like yours
i hate what it feels like to be me
and not you
im so scared
that when you finally come home
youll see me and be frightened
like everyone else is
i know what ive done
the bad things
terrible awful murderous things
i regret them now
but i liked how they felt
i wish i didnt but i did
at first it was only animals
smaller than myself
nothing with feelings
nothing that could hurt me back
it felt good
killings easier than you think
till recently with mama
and the boy from the picture house
they were different
they were more meaningful
i hurt them so they too might know
what it feels like to suffer
but poor daddy didnt deserve that
i wish i hadnt done what i did
mama meant well
she had a hard life
she only wanted a home to feel safe in
i can see that
i thought i hated her
but i just want to feel safe too
i made such a mess of things
i dont know how much more i can take
i need to clean this up
all of it
i need to make things right
before you see me again
maybe if i can turn this farm
into a home for us like you wanted
things will finally be different
i can forgive
i can be who you want me to be
if youll just stay with me
would you do that please
i cant be all by myself anymore
its too hard
we can love each other
ill do that for you
if you really meant all that
till death do us part
itd be enough
just you and me here on this farm
all i really want is to be loved
im having such a hard time
without it lately
i should probably get going now
mother will be wondering where i am
if im not home soon
are you frightened of me
of course not pearl
do you think im sick
thank you
im happy for you
what
for getting the part
in the dance troupe you deserved it
i didnt get the part
its okay
you dont have to pretend anymore
my feelings wont be hurt
if it wasnt me
im glad it was you right
but pearl i
please
dont lie to me
well yes
thank you
its going to be real swell
dancing around the state
i hope you can come see the show sometime
you always get everything you want
youre younger and more blonde
i have to go now
youre not gonna say anything are you
i really do love howard
i know
nobody has to know
i can fix things
it can be our secret mitsy
help
help me
somebody please help
no no please
help help
help
help me please
help
please no no
i wont tell anyone
please i swear
please ill do anything you want
its not about what i want anymore mitsy
please
its about making the best of what i have
no no
no
bless us o lord
and these thy gifts
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty
through christ our lord
amen
home sweet home
