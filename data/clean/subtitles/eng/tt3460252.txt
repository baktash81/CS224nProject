about the price on her head 
how much

what d she do  kill lily langtry 
not quite 
that ten thousand s practically
in my pocket 
it s why i ain t too anxious
to be handin  out rides 
especially to professionals
open for business 
i can certainly appreciate that 
but i ain t got no designs on her 
one of my fellas over there
is worth  4 000 
another one s worth  3 000 
and one of  em s worth  1 000 
that s damn sure good enough for me

well  he done what he could 
but he couldn t make it 
get in 
  that s too bad 
yeah  it is 
me and ol  lash done rode
a lot of miles together

if i considered stupid animals
friends  which i don t 
nevertheless  i m gonna miss him 
who s this daisy domergue 
a no damn good murdering bitch 
that s who 
come on  boys  get up 
i see you ain t got mixed emotions
about bringing a woman to a rope 
by  woman   you mean her 
no  i do not have mixed emotions 
so you taking her
into red rock to hang 
you bet 
you gonna wait round to watch it 
you know i am 
i want to hear her neck snap
with my own two ears 
get up  boys 
you never wait to watch  em hang 
  get up 
my bounties never hang 
 cause i never bring  em in alive 
we talked about this in chattanooga
bringing desperate men in alive s
a good way to get yourself dead 
get in there 
  can t catch me sleeping
if i don t close my eyes 
i don t want to work that hard 
no one said the job is
supposed to be easy 
no one said it s supposed to be
that hard  neither 
get up  boys 
  but that  little lady 
is why they call him  the hangman  
when the handbill says  dead or alive  
the rest of us shoot ya in the back
from up on top of a perch somewhere 
bring ya in dead over a saddle 
  get in 
but when john ruth the hangman
catches ya 
you don t die from no bullet
in the back 
when the hangman catches you  you hang 
you overrate him  nigger 
i give ya he got guts 
but in the brains department 
he like a man who took
a high dive in a low well 
now  daisy 
i want us to work out a signal
system of communication 
when i elbow you real hard in
the face  that means  shut up  
you got it 
i got it 
get in there 
come on now  boys  get in 
  little apple blossom
  what seems to be the problem 
all the ones you tell your troubles to
  they don t really care for you
  come and tell me what you re thinking
   cause just when the boat is sinking
  a little light is blinking
  and i will come and rescue you
  lots of girls walk around in tears
  but that s not for you
  you ve been looking
all around for years
  for someone to tell your troubles to
  come and sit with me and talk a while
  let me see your pretty little smile
  put your troubles in a little pile
and i will sort them out
for you  all right 
i know we only met each other
the once before

course 
get up  boys 
got it on ya 
where 
right here

real careful with it and all 
and i can imagine you probably
don t like taking it
in and out of the envelope
all that often 
if you wouldn t mind  i d sure
appreciate seeing that again 
get in  boys 
you re right 
i don t like taking it in and out
of the envelope that much 
seeing s how you saved
my life and all   
i suppose i could let you
read it again 
 ole mary todd s calling  so i
guess it must be time for bed  
ole mary todd 
get up  boys 
that gets me

you know what this is  tramp 
it s a letter from lincoln 
letter from lincoln to him 
  get in there 
they shared a correspondence
during the war 
they was pen pals 
and this is just one of the letters 
all the stupid   
like to rip my goddamn arm off 
i didn t drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town 
you the one handed her
my goddamn letter 
i didn t give it to her 
i give it to you 
that nigger like to bust my jaw 
you ruin that letter of his 
that nigger gonna
stomp your ass to death 
and when he do  i m gonna
sit back on that wagon wheel 
watch and laugh 
how is it 
well  she ain t help it none 
but it s all right 
is that the way
niggers treat their ladies 
you ain t no goddamn lady 
hey  mr  ruth

well  seeing as how
i m half of them fellas

man knee deep in snow 
i don t want no trouble 
i just want a ride

but that ain t happened yet 
and that s when you get your star 
you got anything that can

y all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together 
well  i ll tell you what  bob 
the name s john

i ll buy you and major marquis there
dinner and booze 
  get in 
my way of saying thanks 
i don t drink with rebel renegades 
and i damn sure
don t break bread with them 
well  mr  ruth    get up  boys 
you sound like you got
a axe to grind against the cause 
 the cause  of a renegade army 
  get in 
bunch of losers gone loco 
you bet i do 
  get up there  hyah 
you wrapped yourselves up
in a rebel flag
as an excuse to kill and steal 
and this ought to interest you  warren 
in particular  emancipated blacks 
sounds like my kind of fella 
sound to me you been reading
a lot of newspapers printed
in washington  d c 
anywho  i m just trying
to let y all know how grateful i am 
i was a goner 
and y all saved me 
you want to show me
how grateful you are 
get in there 
  shut up 
goddamn it  daisy 
it s coming 
get in there  cimarron 
last piece 
does he know how famous you once was 
i don t think so 
giddyup 
black eye 
do you know who he is 
  get in 
do i know about the  30 000 reward
the confederacy put on the head
of major marquis 
come on now  boys 
them hillbillies
went nigger head hunting 
get in 
  they just never did get  em
the right nigger head  did they 
no  they didn t 
but it wasn t for lack of trying 
get in  boys  get on 
them peckerwoods
left their homes and families 
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune 
ain t none of  em found fortune 
the ones you ain t
never heard of no more 
they found me 
now  it didn t stay  30 000
the length of the war 
once passions cooled 
it dropped down to eight  then five 
get up  boys 
but i bet even when it was 5 000 
you had your share
of country boys coming to call 
you know i did 
why d they have a reward on you 
confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing  em 
get up  now 
and after i broke out of wellenbeck 
well  the south took
my continued existence
as a personal affront 
  get up 
and the cause put a reward on my head 
get in there 
what s  wellenbeck 
you ain t never heard
of wellenbeck prisoner
of war camp  west virginia 
no  reb  i ain t never heard of it 
did you bust out 
major marquis did more than bust out 
major marquis had a bright idea 
get in  now 
so bright  you got to wonder
why nobody never thought
about it before 
tell john ruth your bright idea 
well  the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling 
so i burnt it down 
there was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp 
47 men burnt to a crisp 
southern youth  farmers  sons 
cream of the crop 
and i say   let  em burn  
i m supposed to apologize
for killing johnny reb 
you joined the war
to keep niggers in chains 
i joined the war to kill
white southern crackers 
and that means killing  em
any way i can 
get in 
  shoot  em  stab  em 
drown  em  burn  em 
drop a big ol  rock on their head 
whatever it took to put
white southern crackers
in the ground 
that s what i joined the war to do 
and that s what i did 
to answer your question  john ruth 
when major marquis burned 47 men alive 
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees 
that s when the south put a reward
on the head of major marquis 
and i made them trees  mannix 
  get in 
you best believe i ain t looked back
till i crossed the northern line 
but you had a surprise waiting for you
on the northern side  didn t you 
see  once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at wellenbeck 
seems not all them boys were rebs 
why  you burn up some of your own boys 
didn t you  major 
how many burnt prisoners
they end up finding 
wasn t the final yankee death count
something like 37 
giddyup 
that s the thing about war  mannix 
people die 
so you gonna chalk it up
to  war is hell  
well  admittedly  that is
a hard argument to argue with 
but if memory serves 
your side didn t look at it that way 
i think they thought 37 white men
for one nigger
wasn t so hot a trade 
i do believe they accused you
of being a kill crazy nigger
who only joined the war
to kill white folks 
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didn t matter that much to you 
ha  get up 
and that s why they drummed
your black ass
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back 
get in 
  isn t it  major 
horseshit 
if he d have did all that  the cavalry
would ve shot him 
  get in 
well  i didn t say they could prove it 
get up 
  but they sure did
think it out loud  didn t they  major 
get up  boys 
but warren s war record was stellar 
and that s what saved his ass 
now  you killed yourself your share
of redskins in your day 
didn t you  black major 
cavalry tends to look kindly on that 
i ll tell you what the cavalry
didn t look kindly on 
giddyup 
  mannix s marauders 
that s what 
  get in 
and the fact that
erskine mannix s little boy
would talk about anybody else s behavior
during war time makes me
want to horse laugh 
don t you say anything about my daddy 
what he fought for was dignity
in defeat 
  get up there 
and against the unconditional surrender 
we weren t foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls 
we were your brothers 
get up  now 
we deserved dignity in defeat 
just how many
nigger towns did y all sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat 
my fair share  black major 
 cause when niggers are scared   o b  
that s when white folks are safe 
you gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk 
you can ride up top with o b 
you done got me talking politics 
i didn t want to 
like i said  y all 
i m just happy to be alive 
get in  now 
i think i ll scoot over here
right by this window 
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep 
and dream about how lucky i am 
get up  now 
get in there 
get in there  leche 
get in there 
what the hell is going on 
we weren t expecting
another stage tonight 
yeah  i can see you already
got another one up in here 
just got through
putting the horses away 
well  this ain t the normal line 
but we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard 
so it looks like you re stuck with us

you need two pieces of wood

two pieces of wood 
the fuckin  thing is busted 
not just one piece of wood 
give me another piece of wood 
i need a nail 
  here 
jesus 
that door s a son of a gun 
who s the idiot who broke that 
that mexican fella 
good heavens 
a woman 
out in this white hell 
you must be frozen solid  poor thing 
looks like minnie s
got her a full house 
when did you fellas arrive 
about 40 minutes ago 
that cowboy fella in the corner 
that your driver 
  no  no  he s a passenger 
the driver lit out 
said he was going to spend the blizzard
shacked up with a friend 
lucky devil 
jesus christ  that s awful 
christ almighty 
what d that mexican fella do 
soak his old socks in a pot 
i think we all felt the same way 
but were a little too polite
to say something 
he don t have that problem 
  shit 
where s the well water 
over there 
so  all three of you fellas
headed to red rock
when the blizzard stopped you 
yes  all three of us were
on that stagecoach out there 
coffee beans 
over there 
get your hand out of there 
new sheriff of red rock s
travelin  with us 
sheriff of red rock 
that ll be the day 
he s a goddamn sheriff 
i m a monkey s uncle 
good 
then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable 
so 
the new sheriff of red rock
is traveling with you 
he s lying 
he ain t sheriff of nothin  
he s a southern renegade 
he s just talking hisself
out of freezing to death is all 
what the fuck i tell you about talking 
i ll bust you in the mouth
right in front of these people 
i don t give a fuck 
you never gave your name  sir 
john ruth 
are you a lawman 
i m taking her to the law 
so you re a bounty hunter 
that s right  buster 
do you have a warrant 
yeah  course i do 
may i see it 
why 
you re supposed
to produce it upon request 
how am i supposed to know
you re not a villain 
kidnapping this woman 
without a warrant in your possession 
what s your name  buster 
well  it certainly isn t buster 
it s oswaldo mobray 
oswaldo 
i got my warrant  oswaldo 
i take it you re daisy domergue 
that s her 
  yeah 
i see 
it says here  dead or alive  
yeah  it does 
well  transporting a desperate 
hostile prisoner such as her
sounds like hard work 
wouldn t transporting her be easier
if she were dead 
well  no one said the job
was supposed to be easy 
and why is her hanging proper
so important to you 
let s just say i don t like
cheatin  the hangman 
he got to make a living  too 
well  i appreciate that 
allow me to properly
introduce myself 
i m oswaldo mobray 
the hangman in these parts 
looks like i brought you a customer 
yeah  so it would appear 
you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one
of your customers before 
i can t say i have 
  don t talk to my prisoner 
i talk to my prisoner  that s it 
you got it 
  i got it 
jolly good 
you got anything in here besides coffee
that can help warm us up 
well  the bar is open 
follow moi 
line  o b  
you re all right  you re all right 
come on  goddamn it  i m cold 
i ll feed and water the horses 
you go inside and get some hot coffee 
got some stew cooking 
should be done soon 
now  look 
no matter how bad this blizzard gets 
we still got to feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time 
so me and chris better lay out a line
from the stable to the front door
and from the front door
to the shithouse 
good idea 
come on  chris 
i ll give you a hand 
go inside  get warm 
you re doin  stable work
in a goddamn blizzard 
i offer to help  you say no 
you re right  amigo 
muchas gracias 
all right  follow me 
we re gonna drop one every ten paces 
from here to the door 
now  you re wanted for murder 
for the sake of my analogy 
let s just assume that you did it 
now  john ruth wants
to take you back to red rock
to stand trial for murder 
and if you re found guilty 
the people of red rock
will hang you in the town square 
and  as the hangman 
i will perform the execution 
and if all those things
end up taking place 
that s what civilized society
calls justice 
however 
if the relatives and the loved ones
of the person you murdered
were outside that door right now 
and after busting down that door 
they drug you out into the snow
and hung you up by the neck 
that would be frontier justice 
now  the good part
about frontier justice
is it s very thirst quenching 
the bad part is
it s apt to be wrong as right 
well  not in your case 
in your case  you d have it coming 
but other people  maybe not so much 
but ultimately 
what s the real difference
between the two 
the real difference is me 
the hangman 
to me  it doesn t matter what you did 
when i hang you  i ll get no
satisfaction from your death 
it s my job 
i hang you in red rock 
i move on to the next town 
i hang someone else there 
the man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man 
and that dispassion
is the very essence of justice 
for justice delivered
without dispassion
is always in danger

well  not yet i ain t

as the sentimental type 
and secondly  i can t imagine
sweet dave lifting his fat ass
out his chair long enough
to fetch well water
unless minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head 
let alone take a trip
to the north side 
well  that sounds a whole lot

if you don t mind my askin  
my boy 
you got a boy that lives in red rock 
  my son 
chester charles smithers 
he died out here a few years back 
forgive me  sir 
there s no forgiveness needed  son 
like i said  it was a few years back 
it was after he d served his service 
he came out here
to the hills of wyoming
to make his fortune 
never to be heard from again 
i bought him a symbolic plot
in the red rock cemetery 
and i m here to advise
a stone maker on his headstone 
was he a goner for sure 
no chance he could be livin 
the cold life
out in the woods 
it s a rough life 
but folks can learn it 
if he d have done
what he came out here to do 
he d have come home 
hold it  close it  close it 
you have to hold it closed
while i nail it shut 
well  who s the idiot
broke the damn door 
just fucking hold it closed 
orale  cabron 
hold it closed 
one more 
keep holding  keep holding 
my negro amigo 
we need two pieces of wood 
orale  cabron  all right 
there you go  motherfucker 
lot of hats  senor bob 
considering minnie s
 no hats indoors  policy 
which  if i remember correctly 
was one of them bar of iron rules 
kind of rule she d want kept up
in her absence 
you seem to have
a laissez faire attitude
when it come to the hats 
i m guilty 
i have a laissez faire attitude
about the hats 
how about we forget
about the hats today
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on 
we ll make tomorrow  no hat day  
a large black dog 
  now take my tip
  before you ship to join
his name was henry  i believe 
  the iron gang
labrador 
  don t be too gay
  in botany bay
  or else you ll surely hang
  or else you ll hang 
you ll hang  said he   
you know  my daddy   
i said that my daddy
always said that davis
a plum tree 
was a courageous man 
but he should ve put the capital
in montgomery and not richmond 
yes  sir  i agree with that 
the army in northern virginia
would ve been used
in a very different way 
i said the army
of north virginia would ve been
used in a very different way 
  they ll flog the poaching out of you
  out there in botany bay 
shut up 
do you know that nigger  sir 
i don t know that nigger 
but i know he s a nigger 
and that s all i need to know 
that nigger just ain t any nigger 
that nigger  he   
general sanford smithers 
battle of baton rouge 
inform the nigger
in the cavalry officer s uniform
that i had a division of confederates
under my command
in baton rouge 
major nigger  general smithers
wishes me to inform you   
i heard him  hillbilly 
inform this old cracker
that i was in baton rouge also 
on the other side 
that s interesting 
general smithers 
he said that he was also in
baton rouge on the other si   
captain mannix 
tell the nigger
that i don t acknowledge niggers
in northern uniforms 
you captured a whole colored command
that day 
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp  did they 
we didn t have the time or the food 
nor the inclination
to care for northern horses
and least of all   
northern niggers 
so we shot  em where they stood 
gentlemen 
gentlemen 
i know americans aren t apt
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender
get in the way of a good war 
but i strongly suggest we don t restage
the battle of baton rouge
during a blizzard
in minnie s haberdashery 
my nubian friend 
while i realize passions are high 
that was a while ago 
and if you shoot this unarmed old man 
i guarantee i will hang you by the neck
until you are dead
once we arrive in red rock 
i damn well guarantee that  too 
yeah  warren 
that s the problem with old men 
you can kick  em down the stairs
and say it s a accident 
but you can t just shoot  em 
gentlemen    since we may be
trapped here 
close together like 
for a few days 
may i suggest a possible solution 
we divide minnie s in half 
the northern side
and the southern side 
with the dinner table
operating as a
neutral territory 
we could say that the fireplace
side of the room acts as a
a symbolic representative of   
georgia 
while the bar
represents
philadelphia 
long as the bar s philadelphia   
i agree 
we still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon 
thank you 
  i help you protect your  8 000 
you help me protect my ten 
  yeah  i suppose 
one of them fellas
is not what he says he is 
what is he 
in cahoots with this one 
that s what he is 
one of them  maybe even two of them 
is here to see domergue goes free 
to accomplish that goal 
they ll kill everybody in here 
they got  em a couple of days 
so all they got to do is sit tight
and wait for a window of opportunity 
and that s when they strike 
bitch 
if you say so  john 
are you sure you
ain t just being paranoid 
our best bet is this duplicitous fella
ain t as cool a customer as daisy here 
he won t have
the leather patience it takes
to just sit here and    wait 
waiting for an opportunity
and knowing it s the right one
isn t so easy 
he can t handle it 
he ll stop waitin  
try and create his opportunity 
and that s when mr  jumpy
reveals himself 
now  what you got
to say about all this 
what do i got to say 
about john ruth s ravings 
he s absolutely right 
me and one
of them fellas is in cahoots 
we re just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep 
that s when we re gonna kill y all 
okay  everybody 
hear this 
this here is daisy domergue 
she s wanted dead or alive for murder 
 10 000 
that money s mine  boys 
don t want to share it 
and i ain t gonna lose it 
when that sun comes out 
i m taking this woman
into red rock to hang 
is there anybody here
committed to stoppin  me
from doing that 
really 
nobody got a problem with this 
i guess that s very fortunate for me 
however   
i hope you all understand
i can t just
take your word 
circumstances force me to
take
precautions 
when you say
 precautions 
why do i feel that you mean me 
because i m gonna take your gun  son 
you are 
yes  i am 
nothing personal 
  just mine 
hangman s got himself a gun  too 
i ll be dealing with his gun
after i deal with yours 
i feel kind of
naked without it 
i still got mine 
i ll protect you 
a bastard s work is never done 
john ruth 
that s right  joe gage 
now  give me the gun 
  if you want it
you re gonna have to come and take   
calm down 
take your hand away from your gun 
blink if you re calm 
he blink 
he blinked 
blink if you re gonna remain calm 
he blinked 
take his pistol 
i m real sorry about this  son 
like i said
nothing personal  just
a precaution 
pretty sneaky 
afraid the same applies to you  too 
mr    mobray 
precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose 
hand me that little bucket 
go to the outhouse 
take this bucket and   
dump it down the shithole 
why do i got to go outside 
well  your jacket s already on 
and i sorta kinda trust you 
grab the other cup 
  yeah  i got it 
after you  major 
i m gonna cut you loose while we eat 
don t get any ideas 
i ain t goin  soft on ya 
lift your ass
even one inch off that seat 
and i ll put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat 
come here 
so  domergue   
i suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck
far as you re concerned 
you don t hear me complainin   do ya 
no  i sure don t 
well  how  bout you  oswaldo 
how  bout me what 
considering all the things
i done for money 
i ain t one to judge  but
don t you feel
just the least little bad
about hangin  a woman 
well  until they invent
a trigger a woman can t pull 
if you re a hangman 
you re going to hang women 
well  hell  ozzie  i guess
i ain t never looked at it
like that before 
when it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there 
it s the only thing does the job 
you really only need
to hang mean bastards 
but mean bastards  you need to hang 
you goddamn son of a bitch 
i almost died out there 
i ain t ever    going out in that shit
ever  ever again 
you okay  o b  
i m fine 
i ll be fine 
i just need to get warm 
you want some stew  o b  
stew 
later 
that s nice 
how you doing  black major 
i ain t in the mood  chris mannix 
leave me be from your horseshit 
john ruth says
you got a lincoln letter 
i told you  jackass 
go hee haw some place else 
that s right  john 
you did say that  didn t you 
i did 
you got a letter from abraham lincoln 
the    abraham lincoln 
abraham lincoln 
the president of the united states 
of america 
wrote you a letter   
personally 
personally  as in  dear major warren  
no  personally  as in  dear marquis  
 dear marquis  
abraham lincoln 
the president of
the united states of america 
may i see it 
no  you may not 
but the way john tells it 
you weren t
just some random nigger soldier
picked from a pile of letters 
way john tells it
y all had a correspondence 
the way john tells it
y all was practically pen pals 
and a pen pal s
practically a friend 
john ruth 
you really think a nigger 
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back 
was practically friends
with the president of
the united states of america 
john ruth  i hate to be the one
to break it to you 
but ain t nobody in minnie s
haberdashery ever corresponded
with abraham lincoln 
least of all 
that nigger there 
was all that horseshit 
course it was 
good one  warren 
talk that sass  nigger 
talk that sass 
well  i guess it s true
what they say about you people 
can t trust a fuckin  word
comes out of your mouth 
what s the matter  john ruth 
i hurt your feelings 
as a matter of fact
you did 
i m the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with 
so i m gonna cut you some slack 
but you got no idea what it s like
being a black man facin  down america 
only time black folks is safe
is when white folks is disarmed 
and this letter had the desired effect
of disarmin  white folks 
call it what you want 
i call it a dirty fuckin  trick 
you want to know why i lie
about somethin  like that  white man 
got me on that stagecoach  didn t it 
well  i ll tell you
like the good lord told john 
a letter from abraham lincoln
wouldn t have had
that kind of effect on me 
i might let a whore piss on it 
i spit on it 
  good for you  sister 
warren 
goddamn it 
you leave that old man alone 
stand down  you son of a bitch 
i shared a battlefield with this man 
or would you deny me that  too 
i suppose you were there 
may i join you 
yes  you may 
damn it 
so  how s life since the war 
got both my legs 
both my arms 
i can t complain 
got a woman 
fever took her
start of this last winter 
what was her name 
betsy 
georgia gal 
augusta 
atlanta boy  augusta girl 
i used to raise kentucky horses 
and her pa was the owner
of the breedership
where i bought most of my ponies 
goddamn it 
i made a good deal on her 
took the stake he gave me
and bought a bunch of peach orchards 
set myself up pretty well 
did a hell of a lot better
than either one of my no good
brothers  that s for damn sure 
yeah  your boy come up here
a few years back 
he spoke highly of his mama  too 
you knew my boy 
did i know him 
yeah  i knew him 
you did not know my boy 
suit yourself 
did you know my son 
i know the day he died 
do you 
  no 
do you want to know what day that was 
the day
he met me 
he come up here
to do a little nigger head huntin  
by then  the reward was
 5 000 and braggin  rights 
but to battle hard rebs 
 5 000 just to cut off a nigger s head 
that s good money 
so them johnnies climbed this mountain 
lookin  for fortune 
there wasn t no fortune to be found 
all they found
was me 
all them crackers come up here
sang a different tune
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a nigger s gun 
let s just forget it 
i ll go my way  you go your n 
that s your boy chester talkin  
you re a goddamn lie 
 if you just let me go home
to my family  i swear 
i ll never set foot in wyoming again  
that s what they all said 
beggin  for his life
your boy told me
his whole life story 
and you
was in that story  general 
and when i knew me i had
the son
of the bloody nigger killer
of baton rouge   
i knew me i was gonna have some fun 
you shut your lyin  nigger lips up 
general smithers 
don t you listen to him 
he didn t know your boy 
he just heard tell
why you re here  is all 
it was cold the day i killed your boy 
and i don t mean
snowy mountain wyoming cold 
it was colder than that 
and on that cold day  with your boy
at the business end of my gun barrel 
i made him strip
right down to his bare ass 
then i told him to start walkin  
i walked his naked ass for two hours
 fore the cold collapsed him 
you never even knew my boy 
no  he didn t 
he s just a sneaky nigger
trying to get you to go for that gun 
then    he commenced to beggin  again 
but this time 
he wasn t beggin  to go home 
he knew he d never see his home again 
he wasn t beggin 
for his life  neither 
 cause he knew that was long gone 
all he wanted
was a blanket 
now  don t judge your boy too
harshly  general 
you ain t never been cold
as your boy was that day 
you d be surprised
what a man that cold
would do for a blanket 
you want to know what your boy did 
i pulled my big black pecker
out of my pants 
and i made him crawl through the snow
on all fours over to it 
f  
then i grabbed me a handful
of that black hair
at the back of his head 
and i stuck my big black johnson
right down his goddamn throat 
and it was full of blood 
so it was warm 
you bet your sweet ass it was warm 
and chester charles smithers
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could 
you re startin 
to see pictures  ain t ya 
your boy
black dude s dingus in his mouth
him sh sh shakin   him cryin  
me laughin  
and him not understandin  
but you understand  don t you  sandy 
i never did give your boy that blanket
even after all he did 
and he did everything i asked 
no blanket 
that blanket was just a
heart breakin  liar s promise 
kind of like those uniforms
the union issued those colored troops
that you chose not to acknowledge 
so what you gonna do  old man 
you gonna spend
the next two  three days
ignorin  the nigger
that killed your boy 
ign0rin  how i made him suffer 
ignoring how i made him
lick    all over my johnson 
the dumbest thing your boy ever did
was to let me know
he was your boy 
about 15 minutes has past
since we last left our characters 
joe gage volunteered to take
smithers  dead body outside 
straws were drawn
to see who d help him 
o b  lost 
chris  john ruth and oswaldo
had a vigorous debate
about the legality
of the self defense murder
that just transpired 
major marquis warren 
who was supremely confident
about the legality
of what just transpired 
ignored them 
sat at the table by himself
and drank brandy 
captain chris mannix donned
the dead general s coat
and joined oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns 
hey  ozzie 
now  you got the right idea 
let s light this place up 
john ruth held the door closed 
waiting for joe gage
and o b  to return 
bob enjoyed a manzana roja 
domergue  however 
hasn t moved from her spot
at the community dinner table
since john ruth uncuffed her 
john ruth 
can i play that guitar over there 
let s go back a bit 
your boy  black dude s dingus
in his mouth 
15 minutes ago  major warren
shot general smithers
in front of everybody 
but about 40 seconds before that 
something equally
as important happened 
but not everybody saw it 
while major warren
was captivating the crowd
with tales of black dicks
in white mouths 
somebody
poisoned the coffee 
he did everything i asked 
no blanket 
and the only one to see him do it
was domergue 
that s why this chapter is called
 domergue s got a secret  
john ruth 
can i play that guitar over there 
you come back with
anything else but a guitar 
my pistol plays a tune 
 domergue s death march  
you got it 
  listen for a moment  lads
  and hear me tell my tale
  o er the sea from england shore
  i was condemned to sail
  jury found me guilty  sir
and said the judge  said he
  for life  jim jones
  i sentence you across the stormy sea
  have no chance of mischief there
  remember what i say
  they ll flog the poaching out of you
  out there in botany bay
  waves were high upon the sea
  the winds approaching gales
  i d rather drowned in misery
  than come to new south wales
  the waves were high upon the sea
  when the pirates came along
  but the soldiers on our convict ship
  were full 500 strong
  they opened fire and somehow drove
  that pirate ship away
  i d rather join that pirate ship
  than gone to botany bay
and one dark night
  when everything is quiet in the town
  i ll kill you bastards one and all
  i ll gun the floggers down
  give them all a little shock
  remember what i say
  yet regret they sent jim jones
  in chains to botany bay 
that s the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach 
it s kinda pretty 
got another verse to it 
yeah  lots 
well  go ahead  sing it 
whatever you say  john 
  now day and night the irons clang
  and like poor galley slaves
  we toil and toil and when we die
  must fill dishonored graves
  by and by i ll break my chains
and to the bush i ll go
and you ll be dead behind me  john
  when i get to mexico 
give me that guitar 
music time s over 
turn around 
john  no 
when you get to hell  john

meant it  didn t i 
and you need to understand
you just killed the only man here
committed to gettin  you
to red rock alive 
now  one of y all
is workin  with her 
or two of y all is workin  with her 
or all y all is 
but only one of you
poisoned the coffee 
now  what charms this bitch got
make a man brave a blizzard 
kill in cold blood 
i m sure i don t know 
but john ruth s tryin 
to hang your woman 
so you kill him 
maybe 
but o b  wasn t hangin  nobody 
he damn sure wasn t 
but he sure enough
layin  over there dead
now  though  ain t he 
he damn sure is  you sons of bitches 
just like any one of us
would ve drunk that coffee 
like me  goddamn it 
now  those of y all
with your hands on the wall
don t practice in poison
need to think about that 
think about how it could ve been you
rollin  around here on this floor 
and how the man standin  next to you
would be responsible 
and i know who i got my money on 
that s right  joe gage 
i m lookin  at you 
not so fast  chris 
we ll get there 
let s slow it down 
let s slow it way down 
who made the coffee 
he did 
yeah  he did  didn t he 
yeah  he did  didn t he 
but it s the stew
that s got me thinkin  
now  how long you said
minnie been gone 
a week 
si 
see
my mama used to make stew 
and it always tasted the same 
no matter the meat 
and there was another fellow
on the plantation 
uncle charly 
he made stew  too 
and like my mama 
i ate his stew from the time
i was a whipper
till i was a full grown man 
no matter the meat 
it always tasted
like uncle charly s stew 
now  i ain t had minnie s stew
in six months  so i ain t no expert 
but that damn sure is   
minnie s stew 
so if minnie is on the north side
visitin  her mama for a week 
how d she make the stew this mornin  
and this
this is sweet dave s chair 
when i sat in it earlier 
i couldn t believe it 
nobody sits in sweet dave s chair 
this may be minnie s place 
but this is damn sure
sweet dave s chair 
and if he went to the north side
i m pretty goddamn sure
this chair be goin  with him 
what s in the chair 
just what i thought 
sweet dave s goddamn blood 
hon  
hoo hoo hoo 
so  are you actually
accusing me of murder 
way i see it  senor bob 
is whoever is workin  with her
ain t who they say they is 
and if it s you 
that means minnie and her man
ain t at her mama s 
they layin  out back there
dead somewhere 
or if it s you  little british man 
the real oswaldo mobray layin 
in a ditch somewhere
and you just a english fella
passin  off his papers 
or we go by my theory 
which is the ugliest guy did it 
which makes it you  joe gage 
so i take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned
while you were murdering the old man 
well  mi negro amigo 
during that whole incident 
i was sitting on that side of the room
playing  silent night  on the piano 
i ain t say you poisoned the coffee 
i said you didn t make the stew 
my theory is
you workin  with the man
who poisoned the coffee 
and both of y all murdered minnie 
sweet dave and whoever else
picked this bad luck day
to visit minnie s haberdashery
this mornin  
and at some point  y all intended
to bushwhack john ruth
and free daisy 
but you didn t count on the blizzard 
and you didn t count on the two of us 
that s far as i got  how am i doing 
you re a real imaginative nigger 
ain t you 
so  do you intend to murder me
based on a far fetched nigger theory 
or can you prove it  cabron 
it ain t so far fetched  senor bob 
and it s a little bit more
than a theory 
how long you say
you been workin  for minnie 
four months 
see  if you d have been here
two and a half years ago 
you d know  bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar 
minnie mention that to you 
you want to know what
that sign said  senor bob 
 no dogs or mexicans allowed  
now  minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery 
and it hung over that bar every day
till she took it down
a little over two years ago 
you know why she took it down 
she started lettin  in dogs 
now  minnie liked just about everybody 
but she sure don t
like mexicans 
so when you tell me
minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama 
well  i find that highly unlikely 
but okay  maybe 
but when you tell me
minnie mink took the haberdashery 
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world 
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn mexican 
well  that s what i meant in the barn
when i said that sure
don t sound like minnie 
now i am calling you a liar 
senor bob 
and if you lyin  
which you are
then you killed minnie 
and sweet dave 
four measly bullets 
and there goes senor bob 
but that still don t get us no closer
to which one of y all
poisoned the coffee  though 
do it  chris 
no  it sure don t 
now  one of y all poisoned this coffee
to free daisy 
if i don t hear a confession
from one of you motherfuckers
quick  fast and in a hurry 
i m gonna pour this whole pot of coffee
down that bitch s goddamn throat 
okay  time s up 
stop 
all right  i did it 
it was me  i poisoned the coffee 
i fuckin  knew it 
you gonna die now 
you murderin  bastard

he does make the setup more convincing 
i ll talk to the old man 
you three collect the bodies
and chuck  em in that well out there 
and then start unhitchin  the horses
and gettin   em in the barn
and gettin   em fed 
well  hang on  i mean 
puttin  the horses away 
that s easy enough 
but draggin  these fat bastards
up and down the mountain 
that s fuckin  impossible  mate 
well  this is a store 
so there s gotta be
a wheelbarrow around here somewhere 
start with the horses 
and as soon as i get through
with this old hickory tree 
i ll come out and help you  okay 
grab my coat  will ya 
  you re all
   a  none a 
  feelin 
  that nobody wants you
and you re looking
  for someone
  to hold your hand
  someone
  who understands
  you re by yourself
  and you re feelin 
  the world close
in on your
and you re askin    
look 
i just started workin  here 
whatever minnie did
to make y all mad   
i had nothin  to do with it 
  someone   
well  old man 
if you
was a cat 
what just happened here
would count as one of your nine lives 
do you realize how close you came
to being tossed on a pile of niggers 
and when it comes
to that pile of niggers
that we buildin  out back 
won t take nothin 
to make you general of it 
you believe that 
i expect no less 
not so fast  old man 
you might have a way out of this yet 
later today 
son of a gun
is gonna come in here 
and he s gonna have my sister with him 
and he is gonna have her in chains 
he s taking her to red rock to be hung 
do you know why 
 10 000 
that s why 
now  when he gets here

now  do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere
with me saving my sister
from a hangman s rope 
you don t 
no  i don t 
you sure you don t 
i mean  we did just kill
minnie and sweet dave 
now  you and sweet dave looked
mighty chummy over here 
i just met these people 
i don t give a damn about them 
or you  or your sister 
or any other son of a bitch
in wyoming  for that matter 
that is a good answer 
old man 
now  when they get here 
you just sit your ass in this chair 
and you don t do nothin  
you don t say nothin  
 hello  
 thank you  
 good night  
that s about it 
maybe your name 
but that s it 
 hello  
 thank you  
 good night  
and maybe my name 
  maybe your name

and don t you say nothin  
and i mean nothin  
to that bounty hunter
that s got my sister 
do you understand 
when it s safe  i ll kill him 
free my sister
and leave you be 
deal 
deal 
thank you 
during the next four hours 
jody and the boys chucked
the bodies down the well
put away the horses
tidied up around minnie s
stashed weapons for further use 
and waited for john ruth
and daisy s stage to arrive 
all right  boys 
this is it 
let s get ready 
now  remember 
it doesn t matter
if we have four men or 40 
we are still gonna be facing john ruth
chained to my sister
with a pistol pointed at her belly 
now  killin  that fella
 fore he kills my sister
ain t gonna be easy 
but you better believe that s
exactly what we gonna do 
so the name of the game here
is patience 
trapped here for two or three days 
at some point he will close his eyes 
and that s when you blow
the top of his head off 
remember  old man 
if my sister don t make it
off of this mountain alive 
neither do you 
i ll do my best 
good luck  mate 
what the hell is going on 
we weren t expecting
another stage tonight

so i done it for him 
joe gage  get your ass over
here and shut this trap door 
i m sorry  honey 
may i sit in a chair 
yes  you may 
keep your hands flat on that table 
and don t move  em 
mannix 
you sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover 
don t you see 
that nigger and john ruth
put you smack dab
in the middle of danger 
you re about to be murdered
in some nigger named minnie s house 
and you don t even know why 
i ll bite 
i m working with
all three of them fellas 
but not  cause they got
butterflies in their belly
about me  but because
we re all gang members 
the jody domingre gang 
that fella y all just killed
in the basement
was jody domingre 
my brother 
well  who the hell is jody domingre 
you want to tell him  bounty man 
he was a big bad cat worth  50 000 
and every member of his gang
was worth at least ten 
which finally explains
why you worth ten 
and what s gonna happen when
that sun comes out  nigger 
so is my brother s 15 men
coming straight here for us 
tell him  grouch 
jody got 15 men waiting in red rock 
we couldn t kill john ruth
and free daisy here 
their job was to sack the town 
kill john ruth
and free daisy there 
now  with my brother dead 
i m in charge of this gang 
right  boys 
  that s right  daisy 
and  chris  i am telling you 
you ain t done anything yet
that we can t forgive 
so  let s make a deal 
no deals  bitch 
you gonna let that nigger
speak for you  chris  
hold it  warren 
seeing as how she ain t got
nothing to sell 
i m kinda curious
about her sales pitch 
humor me 
all right    bitch 
what s    your    deal 
easy 
take your gun  shoot that nigger dead 
then we sit here all nice like
for the next two days 
when the snow melts  we go to
mexico  you go on to red rock 
get that star pinned on your chest 
hey  pete  how much can we pay him 
well  we could give him marco 
bob s real name is marco the mexican 
he s worth  12 000 
that s marco the mexican 
precisely  yeah 
now that i blowed his face off 
marco ain t worth a peso 
well  then  if i die
in the next two days 
which is more than likely 
you can have me 
under the name of english pete hicox 
i got a federal bounty
of  15 000 on my head 
it s all yours  chris 
you keep talking  pete 
you gonna talk yourself to death 
joe gage  who you be 
grouch douglass 
you heard of him 
yeah  i heard of grouch douglass 
he worth ten  just like daisy 
well  remind me
why we wouldn t just
kill all y all  cash in 
you can kill us all 
but you ll never spend a cent
of that bounty money 
and you ll never
leave this mountain alive 
 cause when that snow melts 
the rest of jody s gang 
all 15 of  em that are waiting
in red rock  are coming here 
now  let s say you shoot us all 
if you really want all that
domingre gang bounty money 
you still got to get
all our corpses into red rock 
and that ain t gonna be so easy 
 cause i doubt you can drive
a four horse team 
and that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two horse team 
so that means you re gonna have to lead
a string of horses into red rock 
and with that deep snow
after a blizzard 
you ain t gonna be able
to get away with any more than 
say  one body per horse 
so that s you leading a string
of four horses into red rock 
and with all them horses in that snow
and you all by your lonesome 
you re gonna be a mite poky 
and you re gonna run smack dab
into the domingre gang 
and again  grouch  how many is that 
15 killers strong 
and when those 15 killers
come across you
in possession of all our dead bodies 
they ain t just gonna
kill you and that nigger 
they gonna go back to red rock
and kill every son of a bitch
in that town 
you really the sheriff of red rock 
you want to save the town 
then shoot that nigger dead 
jesus christ 
you believe in jesus now  bitch 
well  good 
 cause you about to meet him 
anybody else want to make a deal 
the deal still stands  chris 
you ain t done nothing
we can t forgive 
it s all still on that nigger 
you shoot him dead  take my body 
sit out in the snow
with daisy and grou   
you cunt 
mannix 
give me my pistol 
give it here 
so  you were saying
we sit here 
all nice and friendly like 
for the next two days 
then the snow melts  you leave here 
meet up with your gang 
and hightail it to mexico 
that s the deal  right 
and i get oswaldo and joe gage 
but jody s worth  50 000 
what about his body 
you gonna make a deal
with this diabolical bitch 
i ain t saying
i m gonna make a deal with her 
we just talking 
calm down 
so what about jody s body
and the  50 000 
you re getting greedy  reb 
no deal 
we re taking jody s body back with us 
he got children 
so i kill warren  and we all friends 
no deal  tramp 
you re making the biggest
mistake of your life 
when our boys get here
in a couple of days 
they re gonna cut your nuts off 
and there won t be a stick left
in that town unburnt 
well  i guess i should be
plumb scared right now 
if you had any brains  you would be 
here s the problem  daisy 
in order for me to be scared
of your threats 
i got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members
waiting it out in red rock 
and boy  boy  i sure don t 
what i believe is 
joe gage or grouch douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was 
poisoned the coffee 
and you watched him do it 
and you watched me pour a cup 
and you didn t say shit 
i believe you are
what you ve always been 
a lying bitch who will do anything
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in red rock 
including shitting out
15 extra gang members
whenever you need be 
i believe  when it comes to what s left
of the jody domingre gang 
i m looking at  em 
right here  right now 
dead on this motherfucking floor 
goddamn right 
then you re gonna die
on this mountain  chris 
 cause my brother leads an army of men 
horseshit 
my daddy led an army 
he led a renegade army 
fighting for a lost cause 
my daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war
with nothing but their respect
in his command 
your brother s just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers 
i don t feel so good 
you still alive  white boy 
chris mannix 
if your ass ain t nailed
to the floor  wake the fuck up 
wake up  white boy 
i ain t dead yet  you black bastard 
chris mannix  i may have misjudged you 
now we ve come to the part of the story
where i blow your goddamn head off 
no  no  no  don t shoot her 
why the hell not 
john ruth 
now  john ruth was
one mighty  mighty bastard 
but the last thing
that bastard did  fore he died
was save your life 
we gonna die  white boy 
we ain t got no say in that 
but there is one thing left
we do have a say in 
and that s how we kill this bitch 
and i say shooting s too good for her 
john ruth could ve shot her
anywhere anytime along the way 
but john ruth was the hangman 
and when the hangman catches you 
you don t die by no bullet 
when the hangman catches you  you hang 
 you only need to hang mean bastards  
 but mean bastards  you need to hang  
as my first and final act
as the sheriff of red rock 
i sentence you  domergue 
to hang by the neck until death 
hang on  daisy 
i want to watch 
now  that was a nice dance 
that sure was pretty 
can i see that lincoln letter 
 dear marquis 
 i hope this letter finds you
 in good health and stead 
 i m doing fine 
 although i wish there were
more hours in a day 
 there s just so much to do 
 times are changing slowly but surely 
 and it s men like you
that will make a difference 
 your military success
is a credit not only to you 
 but your race as well 
 i m very proud
every time i hear news of you 
 we still have a long way to go 
 but hand in hand 
i know we will get there 
 i just want to let you know
you re in my thoughts 
 hopefully  our paths
will cross in the future 
 until then  i remain your friend
