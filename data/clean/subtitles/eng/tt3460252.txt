in my pocket
its why i aint too anxious
to be handin out rides

you know i am
i want to hear her neck snap
with my own two ears
get up boys
you never wait to watch em hang

my bounties never hang
cause i never bring em in alive
we talked about this in chattanooga
bringing desperate men in alives
a good way to get yourself dead
get in there
cant catch me sleeping
if i dont close my eyes
i dont want to work that hard
no one said the job is
supposed to be easy
no one said its supposed to be
that hard neither
get up boys
but that little lady
is why they call him the hangman
when the handbill says dead or alive
the rest of us shoot ya in the back
from up on top of a perch somewhere
bring ya in dead over a saddle
get in
but when john ruth the hangman
catches ya
you dont die from no bullet
in the back
when the hangman catches you you hang
you overrate him nigger
i give ya he got guts

a high dive in a low well

dinner and booze

my way of saying thanks
i dont drink with rebel renegades
and i damn sure
dont break bread with them
well mr ruth  get up boys
you sound like you got
a axe to grind against the cause
the cause of a renegade army
get in
bunch of losers gone loco
you bet i do
get up there hyah
you wrapped yourselves up
in a rebel flag
as an excuse to kill and steal
and this ought to interest you warren
in particular emancipated blacks
sounds like my kind of fella
sound to me you been reading
a lot of newspapers printed
in washington dc
anywho im just trying
to let yall know how grateful i am
i was a goner
and yall saved me
you want to show me
how grateful you are
get in there
shut up
goddamn it daisy
its coming
get in there cimarron
last piece
does he know how famous you once was
i dont think so
giddyup
black eye
do you know who he is
get in
do i know about the 30000 reward
the confederacy put on the head
of major marquis
come on now boys
them hillbillies
went nigger headhunting
get in
they just never did get em
the right nigger head did they
no they didnt
but it wasnt for lack of trying
get in boys get on
them peckerwoods
left their homes and families
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune
aint none of em found fortune
the ones you aint
never heard of no more
they found me
now it didnt stay 30000
the length of the war
once passions cooled
it dropped down to eight then five
get up boys
but i bet even when it was 5000
you had your share
of country boys coming to call
you know i did
whyd they have a reward on you
confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing em
get up now
and after i broke out of wellenbeck
well the south took
my continued existence
as a personal affront
get up
and the cause put a reward on my head
get in there
whats wellenbeck
you aint never heard
of wellenbeck prisoner
of war camp west virginia
no reb i aint never heard of it
did you bust out
major marquis did more than bust out
major marquis had a bright idea
get in now
so bright you got to wonder
why nobody never thought
about it before
tell john ruth your bright idea
well the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling
so i burnt it down
there was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp
47 men burnt to a crisp
southern youth farmers sons
cream of the crop
and i say let em burn
im supposed to apologize
for killing johnny reb
you joined the war
to keep niggers in chains
i joined the war to kill
white southern crackers
and that means killing em
any way i can
get in
shoot em stab em
drown em burn em
drop a big ol rock on their head
whatever it took to put
white southern crackers
in the ground
thats what i joined the war to do
and thats what i did
to answer your question john ruth
when major marquis burned 47 men alive
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees
thats when the south put a reward
on the head of major marquis
and i made them trees mannix
get in
you best believe i aint looked back
till i crossed the northern line
but you had a surprise waiting for you
on the northern side didnt you
see once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at wellenbeck
seems not all them boys were rebs
why you burn up some of your own boys
didnt you major
how many burnt prisoners
they end up finding
wasnt the final yankee death count
something like 37
giddyup
thats the thing about war mannix
people die
so you gonna chalk it up
to war is hell
well admittedly that is
a hard argument to argue with
but if memory serves
your side didnt look at it that way
i think they thought 37 white men
for one nigger
wasnt so hot a trade
i do believe they accused you
of being a killcrazy nigger
who only joined the war
to kill white folks
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didnt matter that much to you
ha get up
and thats why they drummed
your black ass
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back
get in
isnt it major
horseshit
if hed have did all that the cavalry
wouldve shot him
get in
well i didnt say they could prove it
get up
but they sure did
think it out loud didnt they major
get up boys
but warrens war record was stellar
and thats what saved his ass
now you killed yourself your share
of redskins in your day
didnt you black major
cavalry tends to look kindly on that
ill tell you what the cavalry
didnt look kindly on
giddyup
mannixs marauders
thats what
get in
and the fact that
erskine mannixs little boy
would talk about anybody elses behavior
during war time makes me
want to horselaugh
dont you say anything about my daddy
what he fought for was dignity
in defeat
get up there
and against the unconditional surrender
we werent foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls
we were your brothers
get up now
we deserved dignity in defeat
just how many
nigger towns did yall sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat
my fair share black major
cause when niggers are scared ob
thats when white folks are safe
you gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk
you can ride up top with ob
you done got me talking politics
i didnt want to
like i said yall
im just happy to be alive
get in now
i think ill scoot over here
right by this window
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep
and dream about how lucky i am
get up now
get in there
get in there leche
get in there
what the hell is going on
we werent expecting
another stage tonight
yeah i can see you already
got another one up in here

here
jesus
that doors a son of a gun
whos the idiot who broke that
that mexican fella
good heavens
a woman
out in this white hell
you must be frozen solid poor thing
looks like minnies
got her a full house
when did you fellas arrive
about 40 minutes ago
that cowboy fella in the corner
that your driver
no no hes a passenger
the driver lit out
said he was going to spend the blizzard
shacked up with a friend
lucky devil
jesus christ thats awful
christ almighty
whatd that mexican fella do
soak his old socks in a pot
i think we all felt the same way
but were a little too polite
to say something
he dont have that problem
shit
wheres the well water
over there
so all three of you fellas
headed to red rock
when the blizzard stopped you
yes all three of us were
on that stagecoach out there
coffee beans
over there
get your hand out of there
new sheriff of red rocks
travelin with us
sheriff of red rock
thatll be the day
hes a goddamn sheriff
im a monkeys uncle
good
then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable
so
the new sheriff of red rock
is traveling with you
hes lying
he aint sheriff of nothin
hes a southern renegade
hes just talking hisself
out of freezing to death is all
what the fuck i tell you about talking
ill bust you in the mouth
right in front of these people
i dont give a fuck
you never gave your name sir
john ruth
are you a lawman
im taking her to the law
so youre a bounty hunter
thats right buster
do you have a warrant
yeah course i do
may i see it
why
youre supposed
to produce it upon request
how am i supposed to know
youre not a villain
kidnapping this woman
without a warrant in your possession
whats your name buster
well it certainly isnt buster
its oswaldo mobray
oswaldo
i got my warrant oswaldo
i take it youre daisy domergue
thats her
yeah
i see
it says here dead or alive
yeah it does
well transporting a desperate
hostile prisoner such as her
sounds like hard work
wouldnt transporting her be easier
if she were dead
well no one said the job
was supposed to be easy
and why is her hanging proper
so important to you
lets just say i dont like
cheatin the hangman
he got to make a living too
well i appreciate that
allow me to properly
introduce myself
im oswaldo mobray
the hangman in these parts
looks like i brought you a customer
yeah so it would appear
you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one
of your customers before
i cant say i have
dont talk to my prisoner
i talk to my prisoner thats it
you got it
i got it
jolly good
you got anything in here besides coffee
that can help warm us up
well the bar is open
follow moi
line ob
youre all right youre all right
come on goddamn it im cold
ill feed and water the horses
you go inside and get some hot coffee
got some stew cooking
should be done soon
now look
no matter how bad this blizzard gets
we still got to feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time
so me and chris better lay out a line
from the stable to the front door
and from the front door
to the shithouse
good idea
come on chris
ill give you a hand
go inside get warm
youre doin stable work
in a goddamn blizzard
i offer to help you say no
youre right amigo
muchas gracias
all right follow me
were gonna drop one every ten paces
from here to the door
now youre wanted for murder
for the sake of my analogy
lets just assume that you did it
now john ruth wants
to take you back to red rock
to stand trial for murder
and if youre found guilty
the people of red rock
will hang you in the town square
and as the hangman
i will perform the execution
and if all those things
end up taking place
thats what civilized society
calls justice
however
if the relatives and the loved ones
of the person you murdered
were outside that door right now
and after busting down that door
they drug you out into the snow
and hung you up by the neck
that would be frontier justice
now the good part
about frontier justice
is its very thirstquenching
the bad part is
its apt to be wrong as right
well not in your case
in your case youd have it coming
but other people maybe not so much
but ultimately
whats the real difference
between the two
the real difference is me
the hangman
to me it doesnt matter what you did
when i hang you ill get no
satisfaction from your death
its my job
i hang you in red rock
i move on to the next town
i hang someone else there
the man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man
and that dispassion
is the very essence of justice
for justice delivered
without dispassion
is always in danger
of not being justice
amen
no offense cowboy fella
just gettin your attention
you got it
what you writin friend
only thing im qualified
to write about
whats that

what sounds peculiar
well first off minnie never struck me
as the sentimental type
and secondly i cant imagine
sweet dave lifting his fat ass
out his chair long enough
to fetch well water
unless minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head
let alone take a trip

forgive me sir
theres no forgiveness needed son
like i said it was a few years back
it was after hed served his service
he came out here
to the hills of wyoming
to make his fortune
never to be heard from again
i bought him a symbolic plot
in the red rock cemetery
and im here to advise
a stone maker on his headstone
was he a goner for sure
no chance he could be livin
the cold life
out in the woods
its a rough life
but folks can learn it
if hed have done
what he came out here to do
hed have come home
hold it close it close it
you have to hold it closed
while i nail it shut
well whos the idiot

just fucking hold it closed
orale cabron
hold it closed
one more
keep holding keep holding
my negro amigo
we need two pieces of wood
orale cabron all right
there you go motherfucker
lot of hats senor bob
considering minnies
no hats indoors policy
which if i remember correctly
was one of them bar of iron rules
kind of rule shed want kept up
in her absence
you seem to have
a laissezfaire attitude
when it come to the hats
im guilty
i have a laissezfaire attitude
about the hats
how about we forget
about the hats today
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on
well make tomorrow no hat day
a large black dog
now take my tip
before you ship to join
his name was henry i believe
the iron gang
labrador
dont be too gay
in botany bay
or else youll surely hang
or else youll hang
youll hang said he
you know my daddy
i said that my daddy
always said that davis
a plum tree
was a courageous man
but he shouldve put the capital
in montgomery and not richmond
yes sir i agree with that
the army in northern virginia
wouldve been used
in a very different way
i said the army
of north virginia wouldve been
used in a very different way
theyll flog the poaching out of you
out there in botany bay
shut up
do you know that nigger sir
i dont know that nigger
but i know hes a nigger
and thats all i need to know
that nigger just aint any nigger
that nigger he
general sanford smithers
battle of baton rouge
inform the nigger
in the cavalry officers uniform
that i had a division of confederates
under my command
in baton rouge
major nigger general smithers
wishes me to inform you
i heard him hillbilly
inform this old cracker
that i was in baton rouge also
on the other side
thats interesting
general smithers
he said that he was also in
baton rouge on the other si
captain mannix
tell the nigger
that i dont acknowledge niggers
in northern uniforms
you captured a whole colored command
that day
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp did they
we didnt have the time or the food
nor the inclination
to care for northern horses
and least of all
northern niggers
so we shot em where they stood
gentlemen
gentlemen
i know americans arent apt
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender
get in the way of a good war
but i strongly suggest we dont restage
the battle of baton rouge
during a blizzard
in minnies haberdashery
my nubian friend
while i realize passions are high
that was a while ago
and if you shoot this unarmed old man
i guarantee i will hang you by the neck
until you are dead
once we arrive in red rock
i damn well guarantee that too
yeah warren
thats the problem with old men
you can kick em down the stairs
and say its a accident
but you cant just shoot em
gentlemen since we may be
trapped here
close togetherlike
for a few days
may i suggest a possible solution
we divide minnies in half
the northern side
and the southern side
with the dinner table
operating as a
neutral territory
we could say that the fireplace
side of the room acts as a
a symbolic representative of
georgia
while the bar
represents
philadelphia
long as the bars philadelphia
i agree
we still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon
thank you
i help you protect your 8000
you help me protect my ten
yeah i suppose
one of them fellas
is not what he says he is
what is he
in cahoots with this one
thats what he is
one of them maybe even two of them
is here to see domergue goes free
to accomplish that goal
theyll kill everybody in here
they got em a couple of days
so all they got to do is sit tight
and wait for a window of opportunity
and thats when they strike
bitch
if you say so john
are you sure you
aint just being paranoid
our best bet is this duplicitous fella
aint as cool a customer as daisy here
he wont have
the leather patience it takes
to just sit here and wait
waiting for an opportunity
and knowing its the right one
isnt so easy
he cant handle it
hell stop waitin
try and create his opportunity
and thats when mr jumpy
reveals himself
now what you got
to say about all this
what do i got to say
about john ruths ravings
hes absolutely right
me and one
of them fellas is in cahoots
were just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep
thats when were gonna kill yall
okay everybody
hear this
this here is daisy domergue
shes wanted dead or alive for murder
that moneys mine boys
dont want to share it
and i aint gonna lose it
when that sun comes out
im taking this woman
into red rock to hang
is there anybody here
committed to stoppin me
from doing that
really
nobody got a problem with this
i guess thats very fortunate for me
however
i hope you all understand
i cant just
take your word
circumstances force me to
take
precautions
when you say
precautions
why do i feel that you mean me
because im gonna take your gun son
you are
yes i am
nothing personal
just mine
hangmans got himself a gun too
ill be dealing with his gun
after i deal with yours
i feel kind of
naked without it
i still got mine
ill protect you
a bastards work is never done
john ruth
thats right joe gage
now give me the gun
if you want it
youre gonna have to come and take
calm down
take your hand away from your gun
blink if youre calm
he blink
he blinked
blink if youre gonna remain calm
he blinked
take his pistol
im real sorry about this son
like i said
nothing personal just
a precaution
pretty sneaky
afraid the same applies to you too
mr mobray
precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose
hand me that little bucket
go to the outhouse
take this bucket and
dump it down the shithole
why do i got to go outside
well your jackets already on
and i sorta kinda trust you
grab the other cup
yeah i got it
after you major
im gonna cut you loose while we eat
dont get any ideas
i aint goin soft on ya
lift your ass
even one inch off that seat
and ill put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat
come here
so domergue
i suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck
far as youre concerned
you dont hear me complainin do ya
no i sure dont
well how bout you oswaldo
how bout me what
considering all the things
i done for money
i aint one to judge but
dont you feel
just the least little bad
about hangin a woman
well until they invent
a trigger a woman cant pull
if youre a hangman
youre going to hang women
well hell ozzie i guess
i aint never looked at it
like that before
when it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there
its the only thing does the job
you really only need
to hang mean bastards
but mean bastards you need to hang
you goddamn son of a bitch
i almost died out there
i aint ever going out in that shit
ever ever again
you okay ob
im fine
ill be fine
i just need to get warm
you want some stew ob
stew
later
thats nice
how you doing black major
i aint in the mood chris mannix
leave me be from your horseshit
john ruth says
you got a lincoln letter
i told you jackass
go heehaw some place else
thats right john
you did say that didnt you
i did
you got a letter from abraham lincoln
the abraham lincoln
abraham lincoln
the president of the united states
of america
wrote you a letter
personally
personally as in dear major warren
no personally as in dear marquis
dear marquis
abraham lincoln
the president of
the united states of america
may i see it
no you may not
but the way john tells it
you werent
just some random nigger soldier
picked from a pile of letters
way john tells it
yall had a correspondence
the way john tells it
yall was practically pen pals
and a pen pals
practically a friend
john ruth
you really think a nigger
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back
was practically friends
with the president of
the united states of america
john ruth i hate to be the one
to break it to you
but aint nobody in minnies
haberdashery ever corresponded
with abraham lincoln
least of all
that nigger there
was all that horseshit
course it was
good one warren
talk that sass nigger
talk that sass
well i guess its true
what they say about you people
cant trust a fuckin word
comes out of your mouth
whats the matter john ruth
i hurt your feelings
as a matter of fact
you did
im the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with
so im gonna cut you some slack
but you got no idea what its like
being a black man facin down america
only time black folks is safe
is when white folks is disarmed
and this letter had the desired effect
of disarmin white folks
call it what you want
i call it a dirty fuckin trick
you want to know why i lie
about somethin like that white man
got me on that stagecoach didnt it
well ill tell you
like the good lord told john
a letter from abraham lincoln
wouldnt have had
that kind of effect on me
i might let a whore piss on it
i spit on it
good for you sister
warren
goddamn it
you leave that old man alone
stand down you son of a bitch
i shared a battlefield with this man
or would you deny me that too
i suppose you were there
may i join you
yes you may
damn it
so hows life since the war
got both my legs
both my arms
i cant complain
got a woman
fever took her
start of this last winter
what was her name
betsy
georgia gal
augusta
atlanta boy augusta girl
i used to raise kentucky horses
and her pa was the owner
of the breedership
where i bought most of my ponies
goddamn it
i made a good deal on her
took the stake he gave me
and bought a bunch of peach orchards
set myself up pretty well
did a hell of a lot better
than either one of my nogood
brothers thats for damn sure
yeah your boy come up here
a few years back
he spoke highly of his mama too
you knew my boy
did i know him
yeah i knew him
you did not know my boy
suit yourself
did you know my son
i know the day he died
do you
no
do you want to know what day that was
the day
he met me
he come up here
to do a little nigger headhuntin
by then the reward was
5000 and braggin rights
but to battlehard rebs
5000 just to cut off a niggers head
thats good money
so them johnnies climbed this mountain
lookin for fortune
there wasnt no fortune to be found
all they found
was me
all them crackers come up here
sang a different tune
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a niggers gun
lets just forget it
ill go my way you go yourn
thats your boy chester talkin
youre a goddamn lie
if you just let me go home
to my family i swear
ill never set foot in wyoming again
thats what they all said
beggin for his life
your boy told me
his whole life story
and you
was in that story general
and when i knew me i had
the son
of the bloody nigger killer
of baton rouge
i knew me i was gonna have some fun
you shut your lyin nigger lips up
general smithers
dont you listen to him
he didnt know your boy
he just heard tell
why youre here is all
it was cold the day i killed your boy
and i dont mean
snowymountainwyoming cold
it was colder than that
and on that cold day with your boy
at the business end of my gun barrel
i made him strip
right down to his bare ass
then i told him to start walkin
i walked his naked ass for two hours
fore the cold collapsed him
you never even knew my boy
no he didnt
hes just a sneaky nigger
trying to get you to go for that gun
then he commenced to beggin again
but this time
he wasnt beggin to go home
he knew hed never see his home again
he wasnt beggin
for his life neither
cause he knew that was long gone
all he wanted
was a blanket
now dont judge your boy too
harshly general
you aint never been cold
as your boy was that day
youd be surprised
what a man that cold
would do for a blanket
you want to know what your boy did
i pulled my big black pecker
out of my pants
and i made him crawl through the snow
on all fours over to it
f
then i grabbed me a handful
of that black hair
at the back of his head
and i stuck my big black johnson
right down his goddamn throat
and it was full of blood
so it was warm
you bet your sweet ass it was warm
and chester charles smithers
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could
youre startin
to see pictures aint ya
your boy
black dudes dingus in his mouth
him shshshakin him cryin
me laughin
and him not understandin
but you understand dont you sandy
i never did give your boy that blanket
even after all he did
and he did everything i asked
no blanket
that blanket was just a
heartbreakin liars promise
kind of like those uniforms
the union issued those colored troops
that you chose not to acknowledge
so what you gonna do old man
you gonna spend
the next two three days
ignorin the nigger
that killed your boy
ign0rin how i made him suffer
ignoring how i made him
lick all over my johnson
the dumbest thing your boy ever did
was to let me know
he was your boy
about 15 minutes has past
since we last left our characters
joe gage volunteered to take
smithers dead body outside
straws were drawn
to see whod help him
ob lost
chris john ruth and oswaldo
had a vigorous debate
about the legality
of the selfdefense murder
that just transpired
major marquis warren
who was supremely confident
about the legality
of what just transpired
ignored them
sat at the table by himself
and drank brandy
captain chris mannix donned
the dead generals coat
and joined oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns
hey ozzie
now you got the right idea
lets light this place up
john ruth held the door closed
waiting for joe gage
and ob to return
bob enjoyed a manzana roja
domergue however
hasnt moved from her spot
at the community dinner table
since john ruth uncuffed her
john ruth
can i play that guitar over there
lets go back a bit
your boy black dudes dingus
in his mouth
15 minutes ago major warren
shot general smithers
in front of everybody
but about 40 seconds before that
something equally
as important happened
but not everybody saw it
while major warren
was captivating the crowd
with tales of black dicks
in white mouths
somebody
poisoned the coffee
he did everything i asked
no blanket
and the only one to see him do it
was domergue
thats why this chapter is called
domergues got a secret
john ruth
can i play that guitar over there
you come back with
anything else but a guitar
my pistol plays a tune
domergues death march
you got it
listen for a moment lads
and hear me tell my tale
oer the sea from england shore
i was condemned to sail
jury found me guilty sir
and said the judge said he
for life jim jones
i sentence you across the stormy sea
have no chance of mischief there
remember what i say
theyll flog the poaching out of you
out there in botany bay
waves were high upon the sea
the winds approaching gales
id rather drowned in misery
than come to new south wales
the waves were high upon the sea
when the pirates came along
but the soldiers on our convict ship
were full 500 strong
they opened fire and somehow drove
that pirate ship away
id rather join that pirate ship
than gone to botany bay
and one dark night
when everything is quiet in the town
ill kill you bastards one and all
ill gun the floggers down
give them all a little shock
remember what i say
yet regret they sent jim jones
in chains to botany bay
thats the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach
its kinda pretty
got another verse to it
yeah lots
well go ahead sing it
whatever you say john
now day and night the irons clang
and like poor galley slaves
we toil and toil and when we die
must fill dishonored graves
by and by ill break my chains
and to the bush ill go
and youll be dead behind me john
when i get to mexico
give me that guitar
music times over
turn around
john no
when you get to hell john
tell em daisy sent ya
mannix the coffee

against that back wall over yonder
well goddamn it

its up to you
im gettin
then get
you too señor bob
everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall
move them damn snowshoes
everybody keep your mouths shut
do like i say
you open your mouth
you gonna get a bullet
move a little sudden
a little strange
you gonna get a bullet
not a warnin not a question
a bullet
you got that
let me hear you say i got it
we have it
chris mannix come over here on this side
take this gun out my holster
point it at them
now like i said
anybody does anything
and i mean anything
you kill em
you finally decided
im tellin the truth
about bein the sheriff of red rock
i dont know about all that
but i know you aint the killer
poisoned that coffee
cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self
one of them is
give me the key give me the key
you motherfucking black bastard
youre gonna die on this mountain
and im gonna fucking laugh
when you do
whatd i say bout talkin
bastard
meant it didnt i
and you need to understand
you just killed the only man here
committed to gettin you
to red rock alive
now one of yall
is workin with her
or two of yall is workin with her
or all yall is
but only one of you
poisoned the coffee
now what charms this bitch got
make a man brave a blizzard
kill in cold blood
im sure i dont know
but john ruths tryin
to hang your woman
so you kill him
maybe
but ob wasnt hangin nobody
he damn sure wasnt
but he sure enough
layin over there dead
now though aint he
he damn sure is you sons of bitches
just like any one of us
wouldve drunk that coffee
like me goddamn it
now those of yall
with your hands on the wall
dont practice in poison
need to think about that
think about how it couldve been you
rollin around here on this floor
and how the man standin next to you
would be responsible
and i know who i got my money on
thats right joe gage
im lookin at you
not so fast chris
well get there
lets slow it down
lets slow it way down
who made the coffee
he did
yeah he did didnt he
yeah he did didnt he
but its the stew
thats got me thinkin
now how long you said
minnie been gone
a week
si
see
my mama used to make stew
and it always tasted the same
no matter the meat
and there was another fellow
on the plantation
uncle charly
he made stew too
and like my mama
i ate his stew from the time
i was a whipper
till i was a fullgrown man
no matter the meat
it always tasted
like uncle charlys stew
now i aint had minnies stew
in six months so i aint no expert
but that damn sure is
minnies stew
so if minnie is on the north side
visitin her mama for a week
howd she make the stew this mornin
and this
this is sweet daves chair
when i sat in it earlier
i couldnt believe it
nobody sits in sweet daves chair
this may be minnies place
but this is damn sure
sweet daves chair
and if he went to the north side
im pretty goddamn sure
this chair be goin with him
whats in the chair
just what i thought
sweet daves goddamn blood
hon
hoohoohoo
so are you actually
accusing me of murder
way i see it senor bob
is whoever is workin with her
aint who they say they is
and if its you
that means minnie and her man
aint at her mamas
they layin out back there
dead somewhere
or if its you little british man
the real oswaldo mobray layin
in a ditch somewhere
and you just a english fella
passin off his papers
or we go by my theory
which is the ugliest guy did it
which makes it you joe gage
so i take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned
while you were murdering the old man
well mi negro amigo
during that whole incident
i was sitting on that side of the room
playing silent night on the piano
i aint say you poisoned the coffee
i said you didnt make the stew
my theory is
you workin with the man
who poisoned the coffee
and both of yall murdered minnie
sweet dave and whoever else
picked this badluck day
to visit minnies haberdashery
this mornin
and at some point yall intended
to bushwhack john ruth
and free daisy
but you didnt count on the blizzard
and you didnt count on the two of us
thats far as i got how am i doing
youre a real imaginative nigger
aint you
so do you intend to murder me
based on a farfetched nigger theory
or can you prove it cabron
it aint so farfetched senor bob
and its a little bit more
than a theory
how long you say
you been workin for minnie
four months
see if youd have been here
two and a half years ago
youd know bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar
minnie mention that to you
you want to know what
that sign said senor bob
no dogs or mexicans allowed
now minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery
and it hung over that bar every day
till she took it down
a little over two years ago
you know why she took it down
she started lettin in dogs
now minnie liked just about everybody
but she sure dont
like mexicans
so when you tell me
minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama
well i find that highly unlikely
but okay maybe
but when you tell me
minnie mink took the haberdashery
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn mexican
well thats what i meant in the barn
when i said that sure
dont sound like minnie
now i am calling you a liar
senor bob
and if you lyin
which you are
then you killed minnie
and sweet dave
four measly bullets
and there goes senor bob
but that still dont get us no closer
to which one of yall
poisoned the coffee though
do it chris
no it sure dont
now one of yall poisoned this coffee
to free daisy
if i dont hear a confession
from one of you motherfuckers
quick fast and in a hurry
im gonna pour this whole pot of coffee
down that bitchs goddamn throat
okay times up
stop
all right i did it
it was me i poisoned the coffee
i fuckin knew it
you gonna die now

it took him too long
so i done it for him
joe gage get your ass over
here and shut this trap door
im sorry honey
may i sit in a chair
yes you may
keep your hands flat on that table
and dont move em
mannix
you sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover
dont you see
that nigger and john ruth
put you smack dab
in the middle of danger
youre about to be murdered
in some nigger named minnies house
and you dont even know why
ill bite
im working with
all three of them fellas
but not cause they got
butterflies in their belly
about me but because
were all gang members
the jody domingre gang
that fella yall just killed
in the basement
was jody domingre
my brother
well who the hell is jody domingre
you want to tell him bounty man
he was a big bad cat worth 50000
and every member of his gang
was worth at least ten
which finally explains
why you worth ten
and whats gonna happen when
that sun comes out nigger
so is my brothers 15 men
coming straight here for us
tell him grouch
jody got 15 men waiting in red rock
we couldnt kill john ruth
and free daisy here
their job was to sack the town
kill john ruth
and free daisy there
now with my brother dead
im in charge of this gang
right boys
thats right daisy
and chris i am telling you
you aint done anything yet
that we cant forgive
so lets make a deal
no deals bitch
you gonna let that nigger
speak for you chris
hold it warren
seeing as how she aint got
nothing to sell
im kinda curious
about her sales pitch
humor me
all right bitch
whats your deal
easy
take your gun shoot that nigger dead
then we sit here all nicelike
for the next two days
when the snow melts we go to
mexico you go on to red rock
get that star pinned on your chest
hey pete how much can we pay him
well we could give him marco
bobs real name is marco the mexican
hes worth 12000
thats marco the mexican
precisely yeah
now that i blowed his face off
marco aint worth a peso
well then if i die
in the next two days
which is more than likely
you can have me
under the name of english pete hicox
i got a federal bounty
of 15000 on my head
its all yours chris
you keep talking pete
you gonna talk yourself to death
joe gage who you be
grouch douglass
you heard of him
yeah i heard of grouch douglass
he worth ten just like daisy
well remind me
why we wouldnt just
kill all yall cash in
you can kill us all
but youll never spend a cent
of that bounty money
and youll never
leave this mountain alive
cause when that snow melts
the rest of jodys gang
all 15 of em that are waiting
in red rock are coming here
now lets say you shoot us all
if you really want all that
domingre gang bounty money
you still got to get
all our corpses into red rock
and that aint gonna be so easy
cause i doubt you can drive
a fourhorse team
and that wagon out there is
too heavy for a twohorse team
so that means youre gonna have to lead
a string of horses into red rock
and with that deep snow
after a blizzard
you aint gonna be able
to get away with any more than
say one body per horse
so thats you leading a string
of four horses into red rock
and with all them horses in that snow
and you all by your lonesome
youre gonna be a mite poky
and youre gonna run smack dab
into the domingre gang
and again grouch how many is that
15 killers strong
and when those 15 killers
come across you
in possession of all our dead bodies
they aint just gonna
kill you and that nigger
they gonna go back to red rock
and kill every son of a bitch
in that town
you really the sheriff of red rock
you want to save the town
then shoot that nigger dead
jesus christ
you believe in jesus now bitch
well good
cause you about to meet him
anybody else want to make a deal
the deal still stands chris
you aint done nothing
we cant forgive
its all still on that nigger
you shoot him dead take my body
sit out in the snow
with daisy and grou
you cunt
mannix
give me my pistol
give it here
so you were saying
we sit here
all nice and friendly like
for the next two days
then the snow melts you leave here
meet up with your gang
and hightail it to mexico
thats the deal right
and i get oswaldo and joe gage
but jodys worth 50000
what about his body
you gonna make a deal
with this diabolical bitch
i aint saying
im gonna make a deal with her
we just talking
calm down
so what about jodys body
and the 50000
youre getting greedy reb
no deal
were taking jodys body back with us
he got children
so i kill warren and we all friends
no deal tramp
youre making the biggest
mistake of your life
when our boys get here
in a couple of days
theyre gonna cut your nuts off
and there wont be a stick left
in that town unburnt
well i guess i should be
plumb scared right now
if you had any brains you would be
heres the problem daisy
in order for me to be scared
of your threats
i got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members
waiting it out in red rock
and boy boy i sure dont
what i believe is
joe gage or grouch douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was
poisoned the coffee
and you watched him do it
and you watched me pour a cup
and you didnt say shit
i believe you are
what youve always been
a lying bitch who will do anything
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in red rock
including shitting out
15 extra gang members
whenever you need be
i believe when it comes to whats left
of the jody domingre gang
im looking at em
right here right now
dead on this motherfucking floor
goddamn right
then youre gonna die
on this mountain chris
cause my brother leads an army of men
horseshit
my daddy led an army
he led a renegade army
fighting for a lost cause
my daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war
with nothing but their respect
in his command
your brothers just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers
i dont feel so good
you still alive white boy
chris mannix
if your ass aint nailed
to the floor wake the fuck up
wake up white boy
i aint dead yet you black bastard
chris mannix i may have misjudged you
now weve come to the part of the story
where i blow your goddamn head off
no no no dont shoot her
why the hell not
john ruth
now john ruth was
one mighty mighty bastard
but the last thing
that bastard did fore he died
was save your life
we gonna die white boy
we aint got no say in that
but there is one thing left
we do have a say in
and thats how we kill this bitch
and i say shootings too good for her
john ruth couldve shot her
anywhere anytime along the way
but john ruth was the hangman
and when the hangman catches you
you dont die by no bullet
when the hangman catches you you hang
you only need to hang mean bastards
but mean bastards you need to hang
as my first and final act
as the sheriff of red rock
i sentence you domergue
to hang by the neck until death
hang on daisy
i want to watch
now that was a nice dance
that sure was pretty
can i see that lincoln letter
dear marquis
i hope this letter finds you
in good health and stead
im doing fine
although i wish there were
more hours in a day
theres just so much to do
times are changing slowly but surely
and its men like you
that will make a difference
your military success
is a credit not only to you
but your race as well
im very proud
every time i hear news of you
we still have a long way to go
but hand in hand
i know we will get there
i just want to let you know
youre in my thoughts
hopefully our paths
will cross in the future
until then i remain your friend
