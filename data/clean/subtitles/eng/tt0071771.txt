hazen  well 
what do you think of my team 
crewe  mean 
crude but mean 
ah  i was depending on you 
you know 
well  there s
so little time left now 
it s quite a problem 
they need something
before that first game 
you have to win the first game  right 
well  that s relatively simple  mmm 
yeah  get yourself
a tune up game  you know 
a what 
a tune up game
like the pros have 
you find yourself
some hungry semipro team
that s not in your league 
you bring  em in here
and you kick the shit
out of  em 
well 
how do you think we d do
against the pros 
that team against the pros  yeah 
ha  you d have a real problem ah 
well   well  uh 
how do you think we d do
against the cons 
i didn t know the cons
had a team 
they don t  but you ve
given me an inspiration 
i ve decided  mr  crewe 
that you re gonna put one
together for me 
for that little tune up game 
you know 
and you re gonna play
quarterback 
i can t do that 
why not  they re semipro  we wouldn t have a chance  
you said so yourself 
it s a big joke 
that s why people like
to have me around 
because i have
a sense of humor 
mr  crewe 
as old mr  sam used to say 
 in this institution 
to get along 
you go along  
wait a minute 
wait a minute 
i m just gonna do what s left
of my 18 months quietly 
and i m out of here  oh  yes 
eighteen months 
but that was
to make parole 
that was before you struck
captain knauer 
your basic sentence
is from two to five years 
you could be here with us
a long time  mr  crewe 
if i get this team together 
how long do i have
to get them organized 
four weeks 
we re talkin  about
early parole  right 
i believe we are 
all right  i ll play 
what  i didn t hear you 
i ll play sir 
i ll play  sir 
history 
i read you like a book 
mr  crewe 
one more thing  what is it 
you keep knauer
off my back

mr  crewe 
i ll give you a game 
inmate 
 hit and be hit  
 anyone with any experience
or desire  
 prison football team 
sign up  
what do you think  all murmuring 
maybe i ll get annihilated 
forget it 
wait a second  hey 
here s the way
i look at it 
suppose you break your leg
or something like that 
that s six weeks easy time
in the hospital 
to me 
that s biscuits and gravy 
tell me somethin  
would they let me play tackle 
sure 
that means i spend half the time
lookin  directly across into
walkin  boss s eyes  right 
now you got it 
i always had a thing
for walkin  boss 
yeah  and walkin  boss
always had a thing for you 
hold it  hold it 
don t you guys know a good thing
when you see it 
you get a free crack
at the guards 
not to mention 
a chance to kill one of  em 
legal  bullshit 
i ain t signing that damn thing 
 all chattering 
this honky golden boy sold out
his own teammates  didn t he 
he damn sure did 
he did it once 
he ll do it again 
 men laughing 
hi hi

nate scarboro  giants 
yeah 
step into my office  thank you 
i m  uh  paul crewe  yeah  i know 
you made all pro
your last year  didn t you 
right  why d you quit 
it was a simple decision 
doc said quit football
or quit walking 
my knee had all
the operations it could take 
i figured walking
was better than sitting 
maybe i made
the wrong choice 
anyway  you got 15 guys
that re worth a damn 
the rest   
how long did hazen give you
to get  em ready 
a month 
you bought
a bill of goods 
i didn t have any choice 
and you don t have
one black player out there 
there are at least 15
in this prison
with enough experience
to make this club 
none of  em signed up 
i played eleven years
in the league 
never even got a hangnail 
i m not gonna get hurt
in this game 
i m gonna get the biggest guys
i can find and surround myself 
i know the guards  i ve watched
them play for 11 years 
i ve seen how they ve won games
and why they lost  em 
i know those bums better
than they know themselves 
you just got yourself
a job  head coach 
crewe 
great bunch of guys
you got here 
 strangled both wives
with pantyhose  
 triple murder 
including body dismemberment  
 hacked mother
with meat cleaver  
charming  charming 
nate  double check the ones
with two stars because
they re the most violent 
got any with three stars 
knauer 
warden  i think this game s
a big mistake 
hazen 
captain 
not only will you have
the chance to hone our team
to a fine edge 
you ll also have
the opportunity to learn
a great deal about life 
why is it 
do you suppose 
that i can walk
through this yard
surrounded by hate
and in total command 
 cause you got 15 gun turrets
around you that say you can 
partly  partly 
they could stop us
right now  grab us 
slit our throats 
but they don t 
we get the right person
in the right place
at the right time 
we can surprise
the shit out of  em
one game  one time

see you around  look forward to it 
 grunts 
samson  huh  aah 
samson  don t cut your hair 
what do you think 
defensively we can hold  em
to two or three touchdowns 
but we need better
pass receiving 
and more speed
in the backfield to win 
to win  heh 
i m just talking
about surviving 
who s talking about winning 
so am i 
this just isn t a football game
to the warden 
he shows you and this team up
and he s showin  up
the whole prison population 
nate  it s just a game 
all i wanna do
is come out of it alive 
it s just a game 
not to him it isn t 
it s a fear and violence
philosophy 
he s given us this chance
to be free for a few hours 
to try and be men again 
so he can destroy us 
nate  if you re thinking
about winning this game 
then you re as crazy
as he is 
well  maybe so 
but you spend
14 years in this tank 
and you begin to understand
that you ve only got
two things left
they can t sweat out of you
or beat out of you 
your balls 
and you better hang on to  em
because they re about
the only thing you re gonna have
when you get out of here
