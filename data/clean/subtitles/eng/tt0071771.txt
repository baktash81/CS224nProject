hazen well
what do you think of my team
crewe mean
crude but mean
ah i was depending on you
you know
well theres
so little time left now
its quite a problem
they need something
before that first game
you have to win the first game right
well thats relatively simple mmm
yeah get yourself
a tuneup game you know
a what
a tuneup game
like the pros have
you find yourself
some hungry semipro team
thats not in your league
you bring em in here
and you kick the shit
out of em
well
how do you think wed do
against the pros
that team against the pros yeah
ha youd have a real problemah
well well uh
how do you think wed do
against the cons
i didnt know the cons
had a team
they dont but youve
given me an inspiration
ive decided mr crewe
that youre gonna put one
together for me
for that little tuneup game
you know
and youre gonna play
quarterback
i cant do that
why not theyre semipro we wouldnt have a chance
you said so yourself
its a big joke
thats why people like
to have me around
because i have
a sense of humor
mr crewe
as old mr sam used to say
in this institution
to get along
you go along
wait a minute
wait a minute
im just gonna do whats left
of my 18 months quietly
and im out of here oh yes
eighteen months
but that was
to make parole
that was before you struck
captain knauer
your basic sentence
is from two to five years
you could be here with us
a long time mr crewe
if i get this team together
how long do i have
to get them organized
four weeks
were talkin about
early parole right
i believe we are
all right ill play
what i didnt hear you

heres the way
i look at it
suppose you break your leg
or something like that
thats six weeks easy time
in the hospital
to me
thats biscuits and gravy
tell me somethin
would they let me play tackle
sure
that means i spend half the time
lookin directly across into
walkin bosss eyes right
now you got it
i always had a thing
for walkin boss
yeah and walkin boss
always had a thing for you
hold it hold it
dont you guys know a good thing
when you see it
you get a free crack
at the guards
not to mention
a chance to kill one of em
legal bullshit
i aint signing that damn thing
all chattering
this honky golden boy sold out
his own teammates didnt he
he damn sure did

the advice
i can help you
im nate scarboro
nate scarboro giants
yeah
step into my office thank you
im uh paul crewe yeah i know
you made all pro
your last year didnt you
right whyd you quit
it was a simple decision
doc said quit football
or quit walking
my knee had all
the operations it could take
i figured walking
was better than sitting
maybe i made
the wrong choice
anyway you got 15 guys
thatre worth a damn
the rest
how long did hazen give you
to get em ready
a month
you bought
a bill of goods
i didnt have any choice
and you dont have
one black player out there
there are at least 15
in this prison
with enough experience
to make this club
none of em signed up
i played eleven years
in the league
never even got a hangnail
im not gonna get hurt
in this game
im gonna get the biggest guys
i can find and surround myself
i know the guards ive watched
them play for 11 years
ive seen how theyve won games
and why they lost em
i know those bums better
than they know themselves
you just got yourself
a job head coach
crewe
great bunch of guys
you got here
strangled both wives
with pantyhose
triple murder
including body dismemberment
hacked mother

theyre the most violent
got any with three stars
knauer
warden i think this games
a big mistake
hazen
captain
not only will you have
the chance to hone our team
to a fine edge
youll also have
the opportunity to learn
a great deal about life
why is it
do you suppose
that i can walk
through this yard
surrounded by hate
and in total command
cause you got 15 gun turrets
around you that say you can
partly partly
they could stop us
right now grab us
slit our throats
but they dont
we get the right person
in the right place
at the right time
we can surprise
the shit out of em
one game one time
we can do it

sign him up im way ahead of you
see you around look forward to it
grunts
samson huh aah
samson dont cut your hair
what do you think
defensively we can hold em
to two or three touchdowns
but we need better
pass receiving
and more speed
in the backfield to win
to win heh
im just talking
about surviving
whos talking about winning
so am i
this just isnt a football game
to the warden
he shows you and this team up
and hes showin up
the whole prison population
nate its just a game
all i wanna do
is come out of it alive
its just a game
not to him it isnt
its a fear and violence
philosophy
hes given us this chance
to be free for a few hours
to try and be men again
so he can destroy us
nate if youre thinking
about winning this game
then youre as crazy
as he is
well maybe so
but you spend
14 years in this tank
and you begin to understand
that youve only got
two things left
they cant sweat out of you
or beat out of you
your balls
and you better hang on to em
because theyre about
the only thing youre gonna have
when you get out of here
