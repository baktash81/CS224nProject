st matts ever hired
dillon
no he is its an honour
arent you honoured
i hadnt thought about it
the best quarterback money can buy
dillon lay off
dont pay any attention to him
peanuts
no problem
even in scranton a pricks a prick
you dont have to be so sensitive
come on its not required here
there was some talk about me
playing quarterback so
were you in an accident
i got into a fight
seriously
a fistfight
kind of a goingaway fight
what you mean like a rumble
yeah like a rumble
over girls and stuff
theres a place we hang out and these
motorcycle guys wanted to come in
bikers
we wouldnt let them
you didnt want them on your turf
right
everybody knows not to go
on someone elses turf
who knows what evil
lurks in the hearts of men
the shadow knows
crime does not pay
the shadow knows
mcgiv my roomie
david greene
our new quarterback
this is mac
how do you do
hi
football is a game for bug squashers
cretins and criminals dont you agree
mac wants to play but hes too frail
so we let him be student manager
thats it im going to kick
your smelly ass back to greenwich
i guess you didnt get a school tie
yet
here you can wear this one
i got extras because im always
dragging them through the soup

coach mcdevitt visited and said
you could get an alumni scholarship
good guess
how did you know
st lukes has whipped us
for three years in a row
the alumni are pissed
they want to win real bad
not too much pressure huh
i want a good seat at the back
its different from public schools
chapel three times a week
but its not that bad
no kidding
gentlemen of st matthews
welcome to the finest
preparatory school in the nation
welcome especially to our new boys
i am dr bartram your headmaster
the rest of you may
conceivably remember me
his annual joke
make the most of it
tomorrow begins the 193rd fall term
no i was not in office
when the first one began
some of you new boys may find
that academics and discipline
here are very demanding
much of what is policy here
including our cherished honour code
has been established
not by me or your teachers
but by your fellow students
to be enforced
by your own tribunal of prefects
as it has been
for the last two centuries
we judge ourselves here
and we judge ourselves
by the highest standards
you my boys are among
the elite of the nation
and we strive at st matthews
to prepare you for the responsibility
that comes with favoured position
today more than ever
this country needs an elite
that cares more for honour
than for advantage
more for service
than for personal gain
to that end
let us beseech the help of god
in whose name we pray
our father who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
decent hifi mac

well we beat st lukes
that was the grand plan
mission accomplished
the old boy network
bought us a victory
but
the joke is on us
what joke
you didnt hear the joke
all right lets hear it
true story last weekend
there was a religious revival meeting
bishop sheen
gave such a stirring address
that 10000 people
converted to catholicism
then billy graham got up and
after an hour of inspired preaching
10000 people
converted to protestantism
finally to end the programme
pat boone got up
and sang
theres a gold mine in the sky
and 20000 jews
joined the air force
whats the matter david
dont jews have a sense of humour
it turns out our golden boy here
is a lying backstabbing kike
kike
you son of a bitch
get the door
come on damn it
i dont want to fight him
come on
go ahead deny it
deny it
i dont want to fight him
its true its true
hes a heeb
come on stop it
all right enough come on
no
you going to keep your face in a book
all year
what do you expect me to say
that its no big deal
if its no big deal why didnt you
tell me in the first place
im your roommate
you never told me your religion
methodist
methodist
and all the time i didnt know
thats different
really how is it different
it just is jews are different
its not like between
methodists and lutherans
i mean jews
everything about them is different
ok lets get it out
you think jews are dirt
come on david
if you think like them admit it
say it jews are greedy
come off it come on
come on i
you know the first day i came here
i thought i was dreaming
i knew it was only for a year
but i thought man what a year
id get into harvard
its not easy when you come
from podunk public high school
you guys were my friends
we were winning games
i met sally
i didnt want to be told i couldnt
be part of it because i was a jew
can you understand that
its happened before
you could have told us
it wouldnt have made a difference

i knew that the first night i got here
when i heard how mcgivern
got his hifi he jewed him down
remember
sure
it wouldnt have made a difference
one moment please
ive graded
your takehome translations

connors especially
wrote a near flawless translation

like the rest of the class
you signed the honour code agreement
yeah
this indicates a promise not to cheat
yeah
use of a published translation
would be cheating
i didnt use anything
except a dictionary
if you say so
your translation however
was a quantum leap
over your previous efforts
maybe its because

everyone signed the honour code
so we have a rather bleak situation
confronting us
today is saturday
your next class is on monday
if the cheater does not come forward
or is not identified by then
i will be forced to fail
the entire section
need i remind you what that means
isnt that unfair
only one of us cheated
we have all been dishonoured
by this person
how can you be sure
that someone cheated sir
i prefer to keep the evidence to myself
for the time being
cant you give us another test sir
thats fair
and pretend no one cheated
but someone did cheat
whoever has done this
has robbed you of your honour
if i ignore it he will have robbed me
of mine as well
i leave it in your hands gentlemen
someone had better answer quick
someone must have seen something
yeah and then what do we do
i work my ass off for four years and
now one lying bastard ruins my life
take it easy
whoever did this admit to it
you cant let him fail the whole class
you still have time
ive got this appalling feeling
i have a good idea who did it
who
connors
you like having teeth
cleary all but accused you in french
cleary is a sick shit
and so are you you foureyed runt
ive been in more trouble
than all of you and i always admit to it
so admit to this
come here you little runt
come on come on jack
you bastards arent pinning this
on me
fine just fine
very cool mcgoo
im sorry
but this could ruin all our lives
look weve got three prefects here
you guys have got to handle this
lets sleep on it and meet tomorrow
after chapel in the founders room
whoevers guilty think it over
dillon we have to talk
weve got nothing to talk about
i know it was you
i can describe the crib sheet
thats gieraschs evidence
have you seen it since you used it
if you saw me and didnt report it
youd be in violation too
i know
but i cant let the whole class fail
hes bluffing he wont fail anybody
gierasch wouldnt bluff
david you dont understand
the way it is
you dont know what
this can do to you
my family expects me to measure up
to the impossible
i try but i cant
set it straight dillon
david david
what
look im begging you
im sorry i was a prejudiced prick
i know
its nothing to do with that
just confess
all right
nothing for nothing right
how much is it going to cost
either you tell them or ill tell them
son of a bitch
stay where you belong
all i want to know is how many of
you guys think i could have done it
you did screw up some assignments
so
what are you pulling c
what about this french test
cleary says he cheated
why wouldnt he cheat again
i told you i didnt cheat
how can we believe you
maybe we should
all right lay off
it wasnt connors
this isnt easy for me to say
i know its going to disappoint
some of you and im sorry
i should have said yesterday
i know who cheated
who
it was greene
what
yeah i saw him
youre a liar i saw him cheat
just admit it
i gave him the choice of confessing
hey hey
i saw you cheat
word of honour i saw him cheat
lets tell gierasch the situation
what
i turned him in and hes denying it
tell gierasch
we have to make the decision here
would you both trust us to be fair
of course i do
greene do you trust us
why should he
why shouldnt he
unless hes hiding something
greene
david dont do it all right
this is the way its always been done
right
this is the way its always been done
all right you guys decide
its one guys word
against the others
maybe we should go to the head
we can handle it ourselves
lets just do it
have we heard from everybody
donald
i submit dillon didnt cheat
he didnt have to
hell be fifth generation at harvard
not like greene
but like mcgivern and princeton
so
so nothings for sure mcgoo
lets go over this again
theres an objective fact
one has lied and one hasnt
david never lied
yes he did
he lied about being a jew
no one asked him
because no one had any idea
because he lied
gierasch says it was blockprinted
no way to tell who wrote it
he said the reputation of the school
is on our shoulders
screw the school what about us
we get our lives ruined
my life is screwed
if i dont get into yale
i need my grades for a scholarship
i cant tell my father i failed history
weve busted our butts
now one person is killing us
its got to be greene
rip what do you think
i dont know i mean whats
so different about him anyway
everything
its like my dad says about jews
he madly tried to ingratiate himself
bullshit
he wanted success without working
he was a senior
jesus leave the jewish stuff out
we cant because david is jewish
stupid
youre a bigot
i resent that
resent it all you want
you were the first to needle him
hey hey
i confess
i admit it you know
im an antisemite
i crack jew jokes
i think theyre greedy pushy
but you want to know something else
david greenes the first one i met
whats your point
he was a good guy
that guy wouldnt cheat
which means you think dillon did
yeah i do
that makes two of us
three
i cant believe this
i cant either
youre dumping dillon for a dirty jew
its now one am
are we going to decide
not unless we can be fair
you know he cheated
we know what jews are like
how many do you know
when did you last have one home
i only have to know one
he stole dillons place on the team
then his girl
stabbed him in the back
hes not even paying
wake up guys
cant you see whats going on here
you want to nail greene
because he knew how you feel
anyone else tired of this
yes
lets vote hands or secret ballots
secret ballots
look if we do this
we do it out in the open
ballots
as head prefect ive been asked
its the finding of the class
the majority of the class
that the guilt lies with david greene
mr greene youre requested
to turn yourself in to the headmaster
all right
ill honour your traditions
ill go to the headmaster
and ill lie
thanks buddy
goodnight
goodnight
good morning mr greene
we were wondering
if youd changed your mind
you know why im here
indeed to confess to cheating
thats right
i cheated on the history exam
no david you did no such thing
i saw dillon cheat
he was my roommate for four years
thank you mr van kelt
youre excused
david
im sorry
i did break the honour code
yes as did van kelt
but the honour code is a living thing
it cannot exist in a vacuum
we absolve you both on that account
mr dillon however is expelled
david you represent the best
of what we hope for at st matthews
please dont think of leaving
good then its settled
id like to forget this ever happened
no sir
you never will
because im staying here
every day you see me
youll remember that it happened
you used me for football
ill use you to get into harvard
excuse me
you know something
im still going to get into harvard
