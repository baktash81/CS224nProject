  the best quarterback money can buy 
  dillon  lay off 
don t pay any attention to him 
peanuts 
no problem 
even in scranton  a prick s a prick 
you don t have to be so sensitive 
come on  it s not required here 
there was some talk about me
playing quarterback  so   
  were you in an accident 
  i got into a fight 
  seriously 
  a fistfight 
  kind of a going away fight 
  what  you mean like a rumble 
  yeah  like a rumble 
  over girls and stuff 
there s a place we hang out and these
motorcycle guys wanted to come in 
  bikers 
  we wouldn t let them 
  you didn t want them on your turf

mcgiv  my roomie 
david greene 
our new quarterback 
  this is mac 
  how do you do 
hi 
football is a game for bug squashers 
cretins and criminals  don t you agree 
  mac wants to play  but he s too frail 
  so we let him be student manager 
that s it  i m going to kick
your smelly ass back to greenwich 
i guess you didn t get a school tie
yet 
here  you can wear this one 
i got extras because i m always
dragging them through the soup 
thanks 
you mind if i ask   
how did you wind up here 
  i m not supposed to talk about it 
  let me guess 
coach mcdevitt visited and said
you could get an alumni scholarship 
good guess 
how did you know 
st luke s has whipped us
for three years in a row 
the alumni are pissed 
they want to win real bad 
not too much pressure  huh 
i want a good seat at the back 
it s different from public schools 
chapel three times a week 
but it s not that bad 
no kidding 
gentlemen of st matthew s   
   welcome to the finest
preparatory school in the nation 
welcome especially to our new boys 
i am dr bartram  your headmaster 
the rest of you may
conceivably remember me 
his annual joke 
make the most of it 
tomorrow begins the 193rd fall term 
no  i was not in office
when the first one began 
some of you new boys may find
that academics and discipline
here are very demanding 
much of what is policy here 
including our cherished honour code 
has been established 
not by me or your teachers 
but by your fellow students 
to be enforced
by your own tribunal of prefects 
as it has been
for the last two centuries 
we judge ourselves here 
and we judge ourselves
by the highest standards 
you  my boys  are among
the elite of the nation 
and we strive at st matthew s
to prepare you for the responsibility
that comes with favoured position 
today  more than ever 
this country needs an elite
that cares more for honour
than for advantage 
more for service
than for personal gain 
to that end 
let us beseech the help of god 
in whose name we pray 
our father  who art in heaven 
hallowed be thy name   
  decent hi fi  mac 
  bought it from a friend back home 
  how much 
  i jewed him down to  30

  mcgivern

that was the grand plan 
mission accomplished 
the old boy network
bought us a victory 
but   
the joke is on us 
what joke 
  you didn t hear the joke 
  all right  let s hear it 
true story  last weekend 
there was a religious revival meeting 
bishop sheen
gave such a stirring address
that 10 000 people
converted to catholicism 
then billy graham got up and 
after an hour of inspired preaching 
10 000 people
converted to protestantism 
finally  to end the programme 
pat boone got up
and sang
there s a gold mine in the sky
and 20 000 jews
joined the air force 
what s the matter  david 
don t jews have a sense of humour 
it turns out our golden boy here
is a lying  back stabbing kike 
  kike 
  you son of a bitch 
get the door 
  come on  damn it 
  i don t want to fight him 
come on 
go ahead  deny it 
  deny it 
  i don t want to fight him 
it s true  it s true 
he s a heeb 
come on  stop it 
all right  enough  come on 
no 
you going to keep your face in a book
all year 
  what do you expect me to say 
  that it s no big deal 
if it s no big deal  why didn t you
tell me in the first place 
  i m your roommate 
  you never told me your religion 
  methodist 
  methodist 
  and all the time i didn t know 
  that s different 
  really  how is it different 
  it just is  jews are different 
it s not like between
methodists and lutherans 
i mean  jews 
everything about them is different 
ok  let s get it out 
you think jews are dirt 
  come on  david 
  if you think like them  admit it 
  say it  jews are greedy   
  come off it  come on 
come on  i   
you know the first day i came here 
i thought i was dreaming 
i knew it was only for a year 
but i thought  man  what a year 
i d get into harvard 
it s not easy when you come
from podunk public high school 
you guys were my friends 
we were winning games 
i met sally 
i didn t want to be told i couldn t
be part of it because i was a jew 
can you understand that 
it s happened before 
you could have told us 
it wouldn t have made a difference 
sure 
i knew that the first night i got here
when i heard how mcgivern
got his hi fi  he  jewed him down  
remember 
sure 
it wouldn t have made a difference 
one moment  please 
i ve graded
your take home translations 
they weren t all that bad 
connors  especially 
wrote a near flawless translation 
i noticed  mr connors 
like the rest of the class 
you signed the honour code agreement 
  yeah 
  this indicates a promise not to cheat 
yeah 
use of a published translation
would be cheating 
i didn t use anything
except a dictionary 
if you say so 
your translation  however 
was a quantum leap
over your previous efforts 
maybe it s because
you re such a great teacher  sir 
pick up your graded papers 
dillon  dillon  here he comes 
  a jew 
  grow up 
oh  reece  you re so mature

  nice friends

all that stuff about scranton

i was afraid you wouldn t want
to be with me  would you 
don t look at me that way 
this may be a surprise 
but you re not the first jew i ve met 
just the first who denied it 
i m the same guy  sally

  test act

  1606 
  mcgoo  declaration   
i either know this stuff now
or i ll never know it 
sack time 
are you sure your notes are right 
yeah  now all i have to do
is remember them 
please reaffirm your honour code 
this test will comprise
30  of your final grade 
you may begin 
oh  shit 
bless you 
time is up  gentlemen 
papers to the front 
well  that wasn t so hard 
was it 
my  my  mr connors  you usually
don t have this much to communicate 
you were bound to ask
the right questions sooner or later  sir 
dismissed  gentlemen 
what s with rip 
he must have gone down in flames 
  sure  and i guess you aced it 
  naturally 
you re dead  you are dead 
you are a fink  connors  you jerk 
be seated  gentlemen 
i regret to announce that
someone cheated on yesterday s exam 
everyone signed the honour code 
so we have a rather bleak situation
confronting us 
today is saturday 
your next class is on monday 
if the cheater does not come forward 
or is not identified by then 
i will be forced to fail
the entire section 
need i remind you what that means 
isn t that unfair 
only one of us cheated 
we have all been dishonoured
by this person 
how can you be sure
that someone cheated  sir 
i prefer to keep the evidence to myself
for the time being 
  can t you give us another test  sir 
  that s fair 
and pretend no one cheated 
but someone did cheat 
whoever has done this
has robbed you of your honour 
if i ignore it  he will have robbed me
of mine  as well 
i leave it in your hands  gentlemen 
  someone had better answer quick 
  someone must have seen something 
yeah  and then what do we do 
i work my ass off for four years and
now one lying bastard ruins my life 
  take it easy 
  whoever did this  admit to it 
  you can t let him fail the whole class 
  you still have time 
i ve got this appalling feeling 
i have a good idea who did it 
who 
  connors 
  you like having teeth 
cleary all but accused you in french 
cleary is a sick shit
and so are you  you four eyed runt 
i ve been in more trouble
than all of you and i always admit to it 
  so admit to this 
  come here  you little runt 
come on  come on  jack 
you bastards aren t pinning this
on me 
fine  just fine 
very cool  mcgoo 
i m sorry 
but this could ruin all our lives 
look  we ve got three prefects here 
you guys have got to handle this 
let s sleep on it and meet tomorrow
after chapel in the founders  room 
whoever s guilty  think it over 
  dillon  we have to talk 
  we ve got nothing to talk about 
i know it was you 
i can describe the crib sheet 
that s gierasch s evidence 
have you seen it since you used it 
if you saw me and didn t report it 
you d be in violation  too 
i know 
but i can t let the whole class fail 
  he s bluffing  he won t fail anybody 
  gierasch wouldn t bluff 
david  you don t understand
the way it is 
you don t know what
this can do to you 
my family expects me to measure up
to the impossible 
  i try  but i can t 
  set it straight  dillon 
  david  david 
  what 
look    i m begging you 
i m sorry  i was a prejudiced prick 
i know 
it s nothing to do with that 
just confess 
all right 
nothing for nothing  right 
how much is it going to cost 
either you tell them or i ll tell them 
son of a bitch 
stay where you belong 
all i want to know is how many of
you guys think i could have done it 
  you did screw up some assignments 
  so 
  what are you pulling  c 
  what about this french test 
  cleary says he cheated 
  why wouldn t he cheat again 
  i told you i didn t cheat 
  how can we believe you 
  maybe we should   
  all right  lay off 
it wasn t connors 
this isn t easy for me to say 
i know it s going to disappoint
some of you and i m sorry 
i should have said yesterday 
  i know who cheated 
  who 
  it was greene 
  what 
  yeah  i saw him 
  you re a liar  i saw him cheat 
  just admit it 
  i gave him the choice of confessing 
hey  hey 
i saw you cheat 
word of honour i saw him cheat 
let s tell gierasch the situation 
what 
i turned him in and he s denying it 
  tell gierasch 
  we have to make the decision here 
would you both trust us to be fair 
  of course i do 
  greene  do you trust us 
  why should he 
  why shouldn t he 
unless he s hiding something 
  greene 
  david  don t do it  all right 
this is the way it s always been done 
right 
this is the way it s always been done 
all right  you guys decide 
it s one guy s word
against the other s 
  maybe we should go to the head 
  we can handle it ourselves 
  let s just do it 
  have we heard from everybody 
donald 
i submit dillon didn t cheat 
he didn t have to 
  he ll be fifth generation at harvard 
  not like greene 
  but like mcgivern and princeton 
  so 
so  nothing s for sure  mcgoo 
let s go over this again 
there s an objective fact 
one has lied and one hasn t 
  david never lied 
  yes  he did 
  he lied about being a jew 
  no one asked him 
because no one had any idea 
because he lied 
gierasch says it was block printed 
no way to tell who wrote it 
he said the reputation of the school
is on our shoulders 
  screw the school  what about us 
  we get our lives ruined 
my life is screwed
if i don t get into yale 
  i need my grades for a scholarship 
  i can t tell my father i failed history 
we ve busted our butts 
now one person is killing us 
  it s got to be greene 
  rip  what do you think 
i don t know  i mean  what s
so different about him  anyway 
everything 
it s like my dad says about jews 
he madly tried to ingratiate himself 
  bullshit 
  he wanted success without working 
  he was a senior 
  jesus  leave the jewish stuff out 
we can t  because david is jewish 
stupid 
  you re a bigot 
  i resent that 
resent it all you want 
you were the first to needle him 
hey  hey 
i confess 
i admit it  you know 
i m an anti semite 
i crack jew jokes 
i think they re greedy  pushy 
but you want to know something else 
david greene s the first one i met 
  what s your point 
  he was a good guy 
that guy wouldn t cheat 
  which means you think dillon did 
  yeah  i do 
that makes two of us 
  three 
  i can t believe this 
  i can t either 
  you re dumping dillon for a dirty jew 
it s now one a m 
are we going to decide 
not unless we can be fair 
you know he cheated 
we know what jews are like 
how many do you know 
when did you last have one home 
i only have to know one 
  he stole dillon s place on the team 
  then his girl 
  stabbed him in the back 
  he s not even paying 
wake up  guys 
can t you see what s going on here 
you want to nail greene
because he knew how you feel 
  anyone else tired of this 
  yes 
  let s vote  hands or secret ballots 
  secret ballots 
look  if we do this 
we do it out in the open 
ballots 
as head prefect  i ve been asked   
it s the finding of the class 
the majority of the class 
that the guilt lies with david greene 
mr greene  you re requested
to turn yourself in to the headmaster 
all right 
i ll honour your traditions 
i ll go to the headmaster 
and i ll lie 
thanks  buddy 
  goodnight 
  goodnight 
good morning  mr greene 
we were wondering
if you d changed your mind 
  you know why i m here 
  indeed  to confess to cheating 
that s right 
i cheated on the history exam 
no  david  you did no such thing 
i saw dillon cheat 
he was my roommate for four years 
thank you  mr van kelt 
you re excused 
david   
i m sorry 
  i did break the honour code 
  yes  as did van kelt 
but the honour code is a living thing 
it cannot exist in a vacuum 
we absolve you both on that account 
mr dillon  however  is expelled 
david  you represent the best
of what we hope for at st matthew s 
please  don t think of leaving 
good  then it s settled 
  i d like to forget this ever happened 
  no  sir 
you never will 
because i m staying here 
every day you see me 
you ll remember that it happened 
you used me for football 
i ll use you to get into harvard 
excuse me 
you know something 
i m still going to get into harvard
