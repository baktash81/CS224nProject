 dukhovich  good for them 
family makes a man whole 
   woman screaming 
   boy crying

 dukhovich  i could have

 moreno  professor asimov 
can you please tell the court
what happened next 
then    i was taken
to one of dukhovich s internment camps 
i was there for three years
until he was finally overthrown 
arrested like the monster he is 
thank you  professor asimov 
 livitin  your honor  i request
that this entire testimony be disregarded 
without any evidence 
this is merely hearsay 
   judge  sustained 
   bangs gavel 
 reporter 1  the trial
of former belarusian president
vladislav dukhovich continued today
with emotional testimony
from many of his country s victims 
but while powerful to hear 
dukhovich s attorneys say
they are nothing more
than the lies of his enemies 
 reporter 2  long one of the world s
most brutal dictators   
 reporter 3  who stands accused
of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale 
an unprecedented level of security
is in place around the courthouse 
even the airspace
above this city is closed 
 reporter 4  so far  the prosecution
has been crippled by the lack
of any hard evidence
against dukhovich himself 
 reporter 5  numerous witnesses
who were expected
to testify have disappeared 
 reporter 3  is there anyone brave enough
to come forward with evidence
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign 
 moreno  mr  kincaid 
this is interpol s offer 
in return for your testimony
against former president dukhovich 
your wife will receive a full
pardon from all jurisdictions 
you re going to pardon an innocent woman 
that s mighty fucking white of you 
 harr  assuming we accept this arrangement
for sonia kincaid 
there s still the matter
of an agreement regarding my client 
he will receive
this letter recommending leniency 
mr  kincaid is a contract killer
facing two dozen counts
of murder in ten countries 
absent a legitimate deal 
he will never breathe free air again

these are the most highly trained officers
in europe  mr  kincaid 
we have taken every precaution

having recently survived
a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured 
  authorities are keeping dukhovich   
  interpol wishes to have a word 
quite the dust up in coventry
this morning 
but you wouldn t know anything
about that  would you 
 turns radio off 
you ve come here to lodge a complaint 
i ve come for my money

  would that be fair 
 groaning 
i come from nothing  i work all my life

about the wheels coming off this bitch
when you reach the speed limit   chuckles 
back in the day 
we wouldn t have even stolen
this piece of shit 
and we stole everything 
i remember one night   
i know all i need to know about you 
all your early arrests 
your father in and out of prison 
you following in the same footsteps 
 laughs 
did your little research  did you 
prepare for a test 
there are no surprises 
and you grew up wanting to be a cop
till you found out
wasn t no money in that shit 
so you joined the cia 
sharpened your skills 
then decided to open your own shop 
pimp yourself out to the fat cats 
i didn t even have to do
no research to know that shit 
it s written all over your punk ass 
can t wait to hear what i ll do next 
that s great 
you know  why don t   
why don t you lay back
and keep from getting spotted 
get comfortable 
that s a good idea   groans 
 sniffing 
smells like ass back here

these your electrolytes 
 darius laughing 
 laughing continues 
   siren wailing 
   indistinct chattering 
 both speaking russian 
 casoria  facial recognition
identifies this man
as michael bryce 
but you already know that 
don t you  agent roussel 
you two have a history 
long time ago 
you slipped kincaid
into our own safe house 
then brought in this   
executive protection agent 
official channels had been compromised 
what did you expect me to do 
clearly  our office security s
been breached 
the red notice stays 
you  however  can go 
i m placing you on leave 
you will surrender
your weapon and credentials 
   scoffs 
  you are going to be telling
this story for years  amelia 
from inside a very large office
or a very small cell 
well   sighs  i like my odds 
the only way bryce and kincaid
don t make it to the hague
is if they kill each other first 
 foucher  amelia 
she s making a mistake 
we need to plug our leak 
now  this bryce  do you trust him 
with something like this  yes

hector ramirez 
 chuckles  hector ramirez was an assassin 
yeah  i know  i trained him 
who was holding a knife
to my client s throat 
and you killed him

i think hector might have
a different perspective on that 
oh  is that so  well  here s the thing 
i was a triple a rated
executive protection agent 
  you just made up that triple a shit 
  no  i did not 
and if guys like you   
if sociopaths like you
weren t running around trying to kill
my clients  then no one would get hurt 
triple a  yeah  it sounds like you ought
to be selling life insurance
or fixing my fucking transmission 
or something 
 michael  well

take whatever you want  
dude wasn t there for the loot 
he wanted to hurt somebody 
slaughters the preacher 
displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see 
the bible says never to take revenge 
to leave it to the lord 
but i wasn t prepared to wait that long 
   gunshot 
   crows cawing 
so  when your moral compass
gets around to pointing at me 
yeah  you ll be pointing
at one of the good guys

 sighs forcefully 
she is 
you know  i told her today
that i forgave her 
 chuckles  really  and how d that go 
hard to tell 
you know  women don t like
to be forgiven for shit
 cause that implies they did

so  how d you and agent roussel meet 
 sniffs 
on a job 
she was   
 foreigner   i want to know what love is 
on radio 
she was working an undercover op 
very badly 
i was at a client s funeral 
massive heart attack 
i can protect someone
from bullets and explosives 
but there s nothing i can do
against indiscriminate use of mayonnaise
for 68 straight years 
technically  i was still on the payroll 
so i was in the building 
paying my respects 
amelia was there
with some of her other interpol agents 
they were hoping to bust my client s
shady and mayonnaise chugging brother 
instead of doing things nice and quiet 
they got marked  and their target runs 
oh  yeah 
leave it to interpol to turn
a really fun funeral
with lots of delicious hors d oeuvres
into a depressing carnival show
of total unprofessionalism 
  in my life     
 inaudible 
  i don t know if i can face it again  
  can t stop now  
  i ve traveled so far  
  to change this lonely life  
  i wanna know what love is  
  i want you to show me  
  i wanna feel what love is     
just kind of bumped into her 
see  that s what i m talking about 
it just happened 
you didn t plan it  deduce it 
or google running
into the girl of your dreams 
you just bumped into her 
the same way i just bumped into kurosawa 
you know  when life gives you shit 
you make kool aid 
that s not really
how that expression works 
yeah  and that s the beauty
of that motherfucker  life 
ah  yeah  well  life  i mean   
life doesn t usually give you shit 
and then turn into a beverage 
that s not    at least
where i m from  that s not how it works 
look  motherfucker 
you don t have to explain
  every goddamn thing that goes on in life 
  if it gives you lemons   
okay  you don t need a reason
for that shit 
   you would make lemonade 
just shut the fuck up 
it just doesn t work that way 
  if i can face it again  
  can t stop now  i ve traveled so far  
  to change this lonely life  
 reporter on radio 
breaking news from the hague
suggests that if a credible witness
cannot be produced

did he offer you employment then 
 darius  yes  he did 
he wanted me to take out
a political rival exiled in the uk
