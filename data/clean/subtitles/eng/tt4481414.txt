for the record i didnt wanna go to
the stupid school in the first place

agressively ignoring you
other kids answer questions
they dont get in trouble
you didnt get in trouble
for answering the questions
you yelled at the principle

how did he lose his eye
i dont know i wasnt there
just found him inside a trash can next
to the bottle of alcohol or something
he is a smart smart cat
but no one realizes that
no one understands him no one
put your name in on the top of the paper
so i know who did such a good work
i left my pen with you

okay i wanna see your work
turn around face the desk

its not just about you know guessing
dont be messy
done
let me see
okay i thought you might finish quickly
so a little something extra
done
francis adler
frank adler speaks at this
years leaders conference
francis adler mathematician
a mind for math is diane adler the missing female variable
that finally solves the navierstokes equation
renowned mathematician dead of an
apparent suicide
she is survived by a brother frank
do you know who i am
hey marys teacher
bonnie
you lied to me
okay
can you narrow it down
id like to know the truth about mary
my student
your niece
i was running ridiculously
late for a date
and my sister showed up with mary
she never showed up unannounced
she never showed up with the baby
she said she wanted to talk
she said she needed to talk
i told her i will talk to her when i
got back
i think i figured showing up late to my date
would hurt my chances of gettin laid
came home that night and
mary was on the couch
and found diane on the bathroom floor
i mean theres no way i couldve
known but
i shoulda known
6 and a half years later me and mary
are still hangin out
and what about the father
diane was so socially akward
she didnt date enough to know
a good guy from a bad guy
this particular guy didnt last for month
and no grandparents
dad died when i was eight my mom
she went virgin and she turn back on diane
when she got pregnant
why
didnt fit into her plan
she is exacting woman my mother
uncompromising
very british
do you mean british in demeanor or
no like she is
shes from england
from england yeah
so mary is a genius
look out look out
your little animals are escaping dumbass
hey you should not be laughing
you did a mean thing to a little kid
what are you gonna do about it
hey hey you okay
you good all right
how do we resolve this you know
she could be expelled
god i hope not
but if any firsttime offenders got
expelled well i guess fair is fair
are you gonna take
this serously
sure you dont bluff me i dont
bluff you
miss stevenson believes that your
child is exceptional
and has talents that our cricium
cant begin to challenge
it just so happens that im good friend
with the headmaster
of the oaks academy for
gifted education
he always said that if i find that
one in a million
and the one in a million has a
30000 tuition
mr edgar i can get your
daughter a scolarship
full ride
i wouldnt say it if i couldnt
do it
i realize putting that girl in that
setting
you know 99 times out of a 100 thats
is what you do
its the oaks its great school
i looked into it
this family has a history with
those schools
and i think the last thing that
little girl needs
is reinforcement that shes
different
trust me she knows so
i think mary i think shes gotta
be here
todays bad ending you cant
hit people
but a 12 year old bullies a 7 year old
and she stands up
do you know how important
that is to me that she did that
you know how proud i am of her
arent you
mr edgar your daughter shattered a
young boys
i know you cant hit people
that will be made
very clear i get that
but miss davis if we seperate
our leaders
if we segregate them from people
like you and me
you get congressman
so im sorry i wish i can take
you offer but mary stays
unless you kick her out
this is a mistake well never
be able to raise this child
to the level of scholarship she deserves
well she dumb her down to a
decent human being
everybody wins
you know what just
can you excuse me for just 1 minute
bring me all the piece of
paperwork we have on this girl
hey
are you sure you know what
youre doing
no
okay mary i think you have something
oud like to say to the class
you wanna hop up and say it
okay im supposed to say something
hitting people is wrong even if there bad
i wont do it again so dont be
afraid of me
okay thank you
now i can say something i wanna say
sure
before they ruined it
justins zoo was the best
art project
by far it was awesome
come on a little harder
okay
thank you thank you
theres a lady standing in front
of our door
who is it
how should i know im seven
that would be your grandmother
holy shit
an apple
its a macbook darling
top of the line with the retina display
you know who else has
a retina display
fred
mary i understand you like mathematics
so on there
you will found a great out of print book by
charles zimmer
called transitions in advanced algebra
yeah love that book
youre saying youve read it
yeah ive kinda moved on to differential
equations now
dont forget your manners
thank you grandma
thank you grandma
grandmother or evelyn will do just fine
theres so much more on there
things i know youll find
really challenging
yes but sadly its a school night
and theres homework to do
what a surprise though right
say good night to grandmother
or evelyn
good night
id kill a priest for a benadryl
still with a allergies
why have you got a cat
you dont even like cats
not my cat its marys cat
im just along for a ride
so let me guess our lovely principal
miss davis
never get on the bad side of small minded people
who have a little authority
i thought i taught you that
what are you doin here
you dont think i have a right to see
my granddaughter
i do im thrilled your seven year exhaust
of search
has finally come to a fruitful conclusion
i dont think this is appropriate time
to talk
certantly not the setting
when i was waiting a cockroach this big
tried to steal my shoe
yeah theyll take the shoe
honestly this
this god for sake mosquito ranch
was a conscious choice
i could drop you back off at the
airport
this thing is loaded with cool problems
so are you teaching
i repair boats
please
im not bad at it either
well then that explains this
they dont sell sunscreen here
i wear sunscreen
not enough and you need a hat
a big hat that shades your face and neck
youre playing russian roulette
with your skin
you look like porn producer
okay
i appreciate the advice i do
but were not here to talk about
sunscreen are we
so no more small talk thats a shame
okay the enviroment you have
created for that child
where she lives the school she attends
its substandard every bit of it
i disagree
were getting nowhere if were
not being honest with eachother
i am being honest
i see fine well im not leaving
without her
well welcome to florida
frank please listen to reason
at some point are you gonna get to
conclusion
or someone in authority are going to
spell it out for you
that the child best interest is all that
matters
youre gonna make me pull rank i will
diane didnt want you to have her
diane
diane didnt always think things through
argue with propably one of the
brightest minds on the planet
good luck going down that road
and what do you thin shed say if she saw
how her child is living now
do you honestly think shed be pleased
that shes living somewhat normal life yes
i do
shes not normal and threating her such
is negligence on a grand scale
i know your hearts in the
right place on this
but you are denying the girl her potential
i can provide for her i can enrich
her life
come on evelyn
youre gonna take that girl you are gonna
bury her in tutors
the youll lown her out to some
think tank
where she could talk nontrivial zeros
with a bunch of old russian guys
for the rest of her life
and youd bury her under a rock
look i didnt expect you to understand the
price you have to pay for greatness
i do thats why i have mary in the
first place
thats uncalled for
your sister had a laundry list
of problems
she could have solved navierstokes
and go down in the history
as one of the greatest mathematicians
of all time
but she didnt because she couldnt finish
she was weak weak like a father
and weak like
well
now if its who i think it is
kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon
youre still stubborn and vindictive
careful mother
theres an apple and tree
analogy lurking
you guys ready to order
heres an idea
stop thinking about me and you
and start thinking whats best
for a child
for any reasonable person
a clear picture will emerge
if it doesnt i suggest you call
your attorney
hell have a bucket of beer
lets go outside
no
come on its nice out
i dont care
no more math today
is there a god
i dont know
just tell me
i would if i could
but i dont know neither does anybody
else
roberta knows
no roberta has faith
and thats the great thing to have
but faiths about what you think feel
not what you know
what about jesus
love that guy do what he says
but is he god
i dont know
i have an opinion
but thats my opinion and
i could be wrong
so why would i screw up yours
use your head
but dont be afraid to believe in things
habit
there was a guy on tv who said
there was no god
the only thing different between
the things you saw on tv and roberta
is roberta loves you she tries to help
tell you what though
when we all one another
we all end up back together at the end
thats what youre asking right
yep
okay
find something else to worry about will ya
all right
okay adler grandmother and uncle
really
sure you folks dont wanna go on the hall
and settle this
no well thats a shame
mr cullen youre here for the uncle
yes i am your honor
start charging you room and board
mr highsmith youre on the wrong side
of a bay arent you
im very happy to be here your honor
for the record mrs dibbons is
representing the state of florida
child welfare department
proceed
your honor my client mrs adler
is the maternal grandmother of the child
her daughter the girls mother
was the troubled woman
who seven years ago sadly took her own
life
it was at this time that mr adler
primitively and illegally took
custody of the girl and spirited her
across eight lines
for the purpose of denying my
client custody
and theres the evidence that the
child currently lives
in unclean and unwholesome conditions
we petition to courtto grant my client
and full custoy of the child
so that she can return to the state
of massachusetts
and given the care to which
she is entitled
my client took an infant under his wing
for one reason only
it was his sisters desire
that he do so
my client has been her
constant caregiver
and your honor as far as the living
conditions
ive been in this home
its fine
i mean if we adopt standards based on
our friends aversion to palmetto bugs
we wont have a child left
side of tallahassee
all right last chance before this starts
cost a lot more money
your honor my client would
need reasonable acess to the child
so ordered
ms dibbons would you go out and
check the living conditions
on the books your honor
all right folks
drive carefully
her lawyer has a nice suit
relax frank more weights

relax
so what do you think
cool
wow you and my mom
were always together
always
oh no you dont want to look
at that one
is that you
yes
how old were you
where is this
thats cambridge university
in england
who are those people
my research colleagues
for what
mathematics of course
really
cool
so then you came to work
at the college in america
no
i married your grandfather
and i came back to america with him
and i had children
so no more math
its late
youve got a big day tomorrow
come on up up up
can i play the piano
no you cant stop dragging those feet
but its fun
come on
i have had a series of nightmares
where im fired
because of what happened
you get it
and the i try to rationalize
that everything that happened
was just alcohol
i have an addiction to fixer
guys
dr shankland this problem is
i know just copy it exactly as
you see it written
but its
exactly as written thank you
so whats this problem im
supposed to look at
i dont know
so its like a problem
mom worked on
your mother didnt work
on problems
she worked on just
one problem
just one
her entire life
most of it
look
these are millennium problems
seven great and meaningful
problems
some mathematicians have worked
their entire lives to prove them
whos the dude with the beard
thats not a dude
thats grigori perelman
he proved poincare
conjecture
the only one of the seven
proved
this
this is your mothers
problem
navi
navier stokes
no picture
she didnt solve it
no
she was close
she would have won
fields medal
and probably shared the nobel
considering what would
meant for physics
maybe ill have my picture
up here someday
if you really desire it
you can have your picture
there darling
i can help you
it takes focus and hard
work but if you succeed
your name will live forever
dont be smug seymore
well shes had plenty
of time
she traveled yesterday she
slept in a strange bed
give her a chance
at six years old she read zimmer
outstanding
how much did she comprehend
so mary
i see youre looking at
our little problem
little its big
yeah
why are you so mad all of
the sudden
im not mad im
annoyed
not with you darlin with that
pompes ass shankland
i knew that guy was gonna have
a beard before we even went in there
math teachers like to grow
beards
i should never have agreed
to this
did he reallly expect you to just
walk in and be able to dissect
some random massive
problem
not much to dissect if
you ask me
why why do you say that
it was wrong
what
wellfor starters he forgot
the negative sign on the exponent
it went downhill
from there
the problem was
unsolvable
maybe this school isnt as
great as you think it is
mary you knew that the problem
was incorect why didnt you say anything
frank says im not supposed to correct
older people
nobody like a smartass
im loaded with swag
wanna come inside
cat
frank i think this is stupid
why dont we just call evelyn and
tell her i dont wanna do this
cause as i told you evelyn didnt
order this the court did
so again what we are gonna do
tell the truth
exactly
sonner we answer these questions
sonner we get to go home
so no attitude okay
okay
frank
mary
i like evelyn
she looks like my mom
and she has a piano
but i dont wanna live
with her
shes bossy
ive heard that
hey
dont worry youre not going
anywhere
promise
i promise
hi mary im pat golding
but you can call me pat if you like
got it
do you know why youre here
i mean is anyone told you
what this is about
my grandmother wants me to live with her
and i wanna stay with frank
thats correct
im sure this is gonna be a very
scary stuff does any of it worry you
nope frank says im not going
anywhere
your uncle told you youre not
going anywhere
just 15 minutes ago
so are we done here
not quite yet
my best friend other than
frank and fred is roberta
who lives a couple house away
really whats she like
shes nice and funny
and i love her
thats nice

the ufc
the ufc is that
is that ultimate fighting
every saturday
you and your uncle watch
ultimate fighting
well you dont just
watch it
frank turns the sound down
and we do grounting voices
sometimes i attack frank
for real
which is really fun for me
if you guys knew frank
youd leave us alone
he can be pretty annoying
but hes a good person
i think
why do you say that
he wanted me before i
was smart
mr polland are you the
natural father of mary
adler
yes yes i am
and how you can be certain of this
well i always knew but
then you had me
take a dna test
i would offer that the test results has
result of evidence of that
mr polland is the father and natural
guardian of the minor
as well as an affidavit
from mr polland nominating
mrs adler the maternial grandmother
as the legal guardian of the minor
no objections
mr polland
has mrs adler offered you any
moneytory reward or
employment for coming forward today
no sir i have a job of
my own
thank you no further questions
your honor
mr polland

i couldnt just go and search
the entire country

if theres one thing here
thats sadly obvious its that
mr polland has never been a genuine
guardian of the minor
and his nomination of mrs adler is
no less disingenuous
while the state of florida gets differents
to nomination by natural parent
im inclined to side with
mr cullens laptop
at this time
thank you your honor
dont gloat
wouldnt dream of it
walk you to your car
you been so proacipate
im almost ashamed to ask
hows walter
you wouldnt believe it
if i told you
what
well your stepfather is
in montana
he bought a ranch
bullshit
exactly a man whose idea of
roughing it
is being too far from the
ice machine at the riths carlton
now owns a 1000 acres of
grass and dung
walter price is a cowboy
walter price puts brookes brother
suit to take out the garbage
he has a cowboy hat and
cowboy boots
and a horse that doesnt know
dressage
is there some logical reason
for this
midlife crisis apparently
hes 70
i know
must have been on time
delay or something
i guess i should be happy it
wasnt 25 year old coctail waitress
but than again in affair you can
explain to friends in a minute
for this you put on a pot of coffee
and hes out there right now
yessiree
ridin the range
punchin doggies

his hip
and a saddlebag full
of lipitor

calling him
thats really really funny

hotel
mary baby come on now

why did you have to tell her
that ted was testifying
because its the truth
and if i didnt
evelyn wouldve
if i was the dad of a little girl
and i never saw her
and i was in the same town
i woull visit her
well i hope youre happy
he didnt even need directions
he couldve followed
you here
speaking of man who arent
worth a damn
doesnt even wanna see what
i look like
all right
put your shoes on
were going for a ride
you too
a ride
what are we doing here
waiting
we can see that
why
because i said so
how long do we have to
stay here
as long as it takes
and keep your voice down
its a hospital
foods here
yeah food is here okay
its a boy
way to go
thats exactly how it was when you
were born
this happy
this happy
who came out and told everybody
i did
can we stay for another
mrs adler in your earlier
testimony here today
you painted a pretty dim
picture of your son
dont you think
im under oath
i take no pleasure in it
so your son is failer in life
your daughter took her life
you know youre oh for two
objection
withdrawn
if i got one for three
im in the hall of fame
you know baseball
fanway park
you know id like to go
there sometime
how often in a year did
you take diane to the baseball game
diane wasnt interested
in sports
she never wanted to go to a game
ever
i dont recall her ever
asking
just out of curiosity fenway
thats a tough ticket
where do you get yours
my husband has season tickets
and how long has he
had them
30 years
but ive only been married
to him for 20
and diane never went to
one game
what color was the dress diane
wore to prom
diane didnt attend the prom
because she didnt attend the highschool
no prom
what sports did she play
as i told you earlier she
wasnt interested in sports
did she go to camp during the summer
no
community swimming pool
we had our own pool
girl scouts
no
then what did she do with
all that time
she loved the mathematics
it was her passion
she preferred it to all
other things
all other
mrs adler whos
paul riva
he was a boy from the
neighbourhood
oh come on he was much more
than just a boy from the neighbourhood
paul was dianes first love
wasnt he
i wouldnt caracterize it that way no
and how would diane
caracterize it
diane was 17 years old at the time
she didnt know anything about
love
mrs adler
in january in 1989
didnt diane and young
mr riva run away together
he coerced her
and where did they go
vermont
and you called the police didnt you
yes
because he kidnapped her
yes
and where police found young
mr riva and diane
i told you vermont
stowe vermont
wasnt it
a resort town
stowe mountain
he took her skiing
you see kidnappers dont usually
take their victims skiing
but this is what paul did
because he and diane were
in love
no
and when they returned
you pressed kidnapping charges
you filed the lawsuit against
his parents
until paul stopped calling
diane
didnt you
yes
and diane never heard of or
saw paul riva again
did she
not to my knowledge
and how did she take it
she was upset for a while
she lost focus
she lost focus
mrs adler in march of 1999
didnt diane adler attempt to
take her own life
this episode was minor
it was nothing
i have the hospital
report in my hand
it was nothing
diane was not like
regular people
she was extrodinary
and extrodinary people come with
singular issues and needs
you have no idea of capability
she possesed
one in a billion
and you would say  fine lets throw that away
so the boy who cuts our yard can make sexy concrest
well maybe before you make that
decision you stand in my shoes
i had responsibilities which are beyond
the motherdauther relationship
the greateest discoveries which have
proved life on this planet
have come from minds rarer
than radium
without them wed still be
crawling in mud
and for your information
conselor
a year after this incident with
this boy
diane thanked me for my
intervention
she realized shed made a mistake and
she thanked me
you see diane understood shes been a
contible for a gift shed been given
and she didnt shy from it
and i think if she were here today
mr atorney
she would refute your baseless insinuations that she
would give up her brilliant future and take her own life
just because her mummy didnt get
her a little red wagon
no more questions
mr adler
where are you currently
employed
i repair boats
oh really
at which marina
i dont work at the marina
i freelance
so safe to say no health
insurance
no
about a week before your
sister took her life
what were you doing for
a living then
i was a teacher
youre being modest arent you
you were a professor at boston university
isnt that right
yes weel assistant professor
and whatd you teach
philosophy
truth and logic that sort
of thing
your attorney said that the
primary reason
that you took mary is because what your
sister wouldve wanted you to do
is that a truth
yes
so diane chad visited pinellas
county before
no
indicated she wanted her daughter
rooted and moved here
no
no
so you decided to bring mary
here didnt you
did diane had a problem with your
health plan at boston university
not to my knowledge
do you think she would want her
dauther to have access to healthcare
of course
so what do you do when a little
mary gets sick
you repair a doctors boat
objection
sustained
mary has been identified as
a math prodigy
but her formal math education
under your care
shes learning at the first grade level
isnt she
yes
and you turned out the scolarship
at the oaks
a school specialized for the education
of gifted children
yes
and diane shed be fine with that
i couldnt say
prody to mrs adler giving her one
did mary have a computer
she used mine
mr adler does dianes daughter
have her own bedroom
no
does she sleep in a bed that you bought
in a secondhand shop
yes
so the truth is mr adler
that you didnt come down here
because your sister wanted it to
and you certantly didnt come here
because it was good for mary
no it was personal
diane was a star you
werent
diane got the attention
you didnt
nobody use you got angry
and here comes mary
what a great way to get even
youve uprooted that litlle girl and brought
her here for 1 reason only
to do harm to your mother
you blamed her for your sister
no i dont
and mary to you is just a paawn
in all this
diane wanted mary
to be a kid
she wanted her to have a life
she wanted her to have friends
and to play
and to be happy
you realize the consequences of boredom
for a gifted child mr adler
they become resentful and
sullen
marys not an angry kid
really
did she not attack a child
on the school bus
a 12 year old tripped a 7 year old and
she came to his defense
did she brake the boys nose
yes
on october 16th last year were you
arrested for assault
oh my god
you have to answer the question
mr adler
a drunk idiot attacked me and i
defended myself
did you spend the night in jail
yeah
you are in way over your head here
youre depriving that girl
youre gambling with her future
and now you being presented with
an opportunity
to do right by her
does concil have a question for my client
take the high road mr adler
before shes rapidly damaged
does concil have a question
for my client or not
yes sir i do have a question
tell us is your continued guardianship
really in the best interest
of this litlle girl
yes
yes it is
i have no further questions

a brand new fred cheer

after the first few weeks i knew
i had to find a real family for her
i was in way over my head
and every day id say
todays the day
im taking her to child services
and every day shed do
something just
so unbelievably cool
her little personality was exploding
she was funny
and she was angry and she was happy
and she was
sad
and was cute
just so damn entertaining
and so i kept her
not that thats in her best interest
not that im capable of raising a child
a child that might still have a mother if id taken
the time to notice she needed me
and now six and a half years later
i finally got her to a foster family
and you know what
it was great she loved it
i thought it would be a nightmare
of abandonment and betrayal
and it turns out it was
a huge success
im fucking hero

smart sweet human being

youre smilling
roberta
baby
of all the stunts you could pull
where are they going
nowhere not yet
you two out
what is this
do you want to know
how diane told me she finished
what is this unconscionable lie
i walked in the appartment and she was
sitting on the floor
with that baby in her arms and you know what she said to me
admit it
you made this up
she said what do i do now
no
its not a completed proof
it is
no it isnt it cant be
evelyn stop
im taking mary and im raising her how i
believe diane would have wanted it
well see about this later
i realize
shes not normal but if einstein can
ride a bike so can she
let just say diane didnt tell me
which is nonsense
its a millenium problem she would
have shared it with the world
thats where your charade falls apart
if she would completed the proof
she would have published it
diane instructed me very clearly
that i was only o publish it
postmortem
she died six years ago
it wasnt her death she was
talking about
i tried to talk her out of it
but you know how diane could be
whenshe made her mind up on something
i called mit
shanklands out of his mind about the possibility
of publishing it with you
hes waiting for your call
youre gonna spend the next few years
of your life defending it
you wont have time for her
what if i say no
back to plan a
wait for me to die
i know diane was hard
i know she was angry
but something really good came out of this
evelyn
she needs you now
youre the best woman for a job
take it
it doesnt seem like diane wanted
me to have it
diane didnt always think things through
ill be outside
let me know what you wanna do
you reached the apartment of mathematics
mit
if you know your part in extension
you may dial it anytime
if you wish to speak to operator
please stay in line and someone
would be with you as soon as possible
mit mathematics how may i direct
your call
hello im sorry i cant hear
you wery well
no no
yeah there you are
yeah can i help you
yes
doctor shankland
im really sorry i
cant hear you
could you speak up please
hello
evelyn adler
for seymore shankland please
what i want you to notice is
when you compute p and n
for n congruent to four mod five
the answer is a multiple of five
the first person to notice this
was romanujan
in the beginning of 20th
century
he proved that it was a case for all
numbers congruent to four mod five
so he proved that p of five n
plus four
is congruent to zero mod seven
and p of eleven n plus six is
congruent
good
you drive like an old lady
