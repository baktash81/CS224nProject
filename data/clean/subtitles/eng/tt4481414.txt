what 
yeah  today in math 
she answered some really   
  no  that s   
  no  please 
  it s not gifted 
  really difficult questions 
right 
  just the seven year old would   
  it s trachtenberg 
  jakow trachtenberg 
  i m sorry 
spent seven years in a concentration camp 
developed the sistem to
rapidly solve problems 
it s the trachtenberg method 
but she is   
i mean    she s seven though 
i learned it when i was eight 
do i look gifted to you 
it kinda go out of note since the
invention of the calculator   
but    i can still win a drink
at the bar using it 
sorry for today 
won t happen again 
okay 
nice to meet you 
bonnie 
frank 
trachenberg method 
for the record  i didn t wanna go to
the stupid school in the first place 
and the boy in the front row acts
inappropriately for someonewho s a child 
sorry  i m still passive
agressively ignoring you 
other kids answer questions 
they don t get in trouble 
you didn t get in trouble
for answering the questions 
you yelled at the principle 
all right  you know what 
you re gonna find this interesting 
so i googled
 first graders who yelled at the principal 
and statistically you will never
believe how many kids do it 
how many 
none 
frank  i m sorry  i m really sorry 
yeah  right 
you can t show off like that in school 
i know 
you promised you wouldn t
then at the first day   
i know  i screwed up 
do you think this boat needs a test ride 
go get  fred 
don t run 
d i listen to the wind 
to the wind of my soul d
d where i will end up  well
i think only god really knows d
d i ve sat upon the setting sun d
d but never  never  never  never d
d i never wanted water ones d
d never  never  never d
fred loves to watch the sandpipers 
he thinks he d like to catch one 
but he d regret it 
fred s not the killer 
he s a lover 
would mom want me to go to school 
i can only guess 
but i will tell you that  she would
have wanted you to have friends 
idiot friends 
she d want you to have
compassion for others 
like a cat can have for a sandpiper 
but what if they don t like me 
then they re idiots 
good morning  class 
good moring  mrs  stevenson 
good morning  mary 
good morning  mrs  stevenson 
okay  good morning 
get a hold of yourself 
for my show and tell i have   
the most awesome cat
in the history of times 
not only is his name fred  but   
he has just one eye 
uno  go ahead and count   
but i promise you is always one 
how did he lose his eye 
i don t know  i wasn t there 
just found him inside a trash can next
to the bottle of alcohol or something 
he is a smart  smart cat 
but no one realizes that 
no one understands him  no one 
put your name in on the top of the paper 
so i know who did such a good work 
i left my pen with you 
pass those around guys 
okay  i wanna see your work 
turn around  face the desk 
think about how you get to the answer 
it s not just about  you know  guessing 
don t be messy 
done 
let me see 
okay  i thought you might finish quickly 
so a little something extra 
done 
francis adler
frank adler speaks at this
year s leader s conference
francis adler  mathematician
a mind for math  is diane adler the missing female variable
that finally solves the navier stokes equation 
renowned mathematician dead of an
apparent suicide
she is survived by a brother frank 
do you know who i am 
hey  mary s teacher   
bonnie 
you lied to me 
okay 
can you narrow it down 
i d like to know the truth about mary   
    my student 
your niece 
i was running ridiculously
late for a date   
and my sister showed up with mary 
she never showed up unannounced 
she never showed up with the baby 
she said she wanted to talk 
she said she needed to talk 
i told her i will talk to her when i
got back 
i think i figured showing up late to my date
would hurt my chances of gettin  laid 
came home that night and
mary was on the couch   
and found diane on the bathroom floor 
i mean  there s no way i could ve
known  but   
i shoulda known 
6 and a half years later me and mary
are still hangin  out 
and what about the father 
diane was so socially akward   
she didn t date enough to know
a good guy from a bad guy 
this particular guy didn t last for month 
and no grandparents 
dad died when i was eight  my mom   
she went virgin and she turn back on diane
when she got pregnant 
why 
didn t fit into her plan 
she is exacting woman  my mother 
uncompromising 
very british 
do you mean british in demeanor or   
  no  like she is   
  she s from england 
from england  yeah 
so mary is a genius 
look out  look out 
your little animals are escaping  dumbass 
hey  you should not be laughing 
you did a mean thing to a little kid 
what are you gonna do about it 
hey  hey  you okay 
you good  all right 
how do we resolve this  you know 
she could be expelled 
god  i hope not 
but if any first time offenders got
expelled  well i guess fair is fair 
are you gonna take
this serously 
sure  you don t bluff me  i don t
bluff you 
miss stevenson believes that your
child is exceptional 
and has talents that our cricium
can t begin to challenge 
it just so happens  that i m good friend
with the headmaster   
    of the oaks academy for
gifted education 
he always said that if i find that
one in a million   
and the one in a million has a
 30 000 tuition 
mr  edgar  i can get your
daughter a scolarship 
full ride 
i wouldn t say it  if i couldn t
do it 
i realize  putting that girl in that
setting   
you know  99 times out of a 100  that s
is what you do 
it s the oaks  it s great school 
i looked into it 
this family has a history with
those schools 
and i think the last thing that
little girl needs   
is reinforcement that she s
different 
trust me  she knows  so   
i think mary  i think she s gotta
be here 
today s bad ending  you can t
hit people 
but a 12 year old bullies a 7 year old
and she stands up 
do you know how important
that is to me that she did that 
you know how proud i am of her 
aren t you 
mr  edgar  your daughter shattered a
young boy s   
i know  you can t hit people 
that will be made
very clear  i get that 
but miss davis  if we seperate
our leaders   
if we segregate them from people
like you and me   
you get congressman 
so i m sorry  i wish i can take
you offer  but mary stays 
unless you kick her out 
this is a mistake  we ll never
be able to raise this child   
to the level of scholarship she deserves 
well    she dumb her down to a
decent human being 
everybody wins 
you know what  just   
can you excuse me for just 1 minute 
bring me all the piece of
paperwork we have on this girl 
hey 
are you sure you know what
you re doing 
no 
okay mary  i think you have something
 ou d like to say to the class
you wanna hop up and say it 
okay  i m supposed to say something 
hitting people is wrong even if the re bad 
i won t do it again  so don t be
afraid of me 
okay  thank you 
now i can say something i wanna say 
sure 
before they ruined it   
justin s zoo was the best
art project 
by far  it was awesome 
come on  a little harder 
okay 
thank you  thank you 
there s a lady standing in front
of our door 
who is it 
how should i know  i m seven 
that would be your grandmother 
holy shit 
an apple 
it s a macbook  darling 
top of the line with the retina display 
you know who else has
a retina display 
fred 
mary  i understand you like mathematics 
so  on there   
you will found a great out of print book by
charles zimmer   
called transitions in advanced algebra 
yeah  love that book 
you re saying you ve read it 
yeah  i ve kinda moved on to differential
equations now 
don t forget your manners 
thank you  grandma 
thank you  grandma 
grandmother or evelyn will do just fine 
there s so much more on there 
things i know you ll find
really challenging 
yes  but sadly it s a school night
and there s homework to do 
what a surprise though  right 
say good night to grandmother
or evelyn 
good night 
i d kill a priest for a benadryl 
still with a allergies 
why have you got a cat 
you don t even like cats 
not my cat  it s mary s cat 
i m just along for a ride 
so let me guess  our lovely principal 
miss davis 
never get on the bad side of small minded people
who have a little authority 
i thought i taught you that 
what are you doin  here 
you don t think i have a right to see
my granddaughter 
i do  i m thrilled your seven year exhaust
of search   
has finally come to a fruitful conclusion 
i don t think this is appropriate time
to talk 
certantly not the setting 
when i was waiting a cockroach this big
tried to steal my shoe 
yeah  they ll take the shoe 
honestly  this 
this god for sake mosquito ranch
was a conscious choice 
i could drop you back off at the
airport 
this thing is loaded with cool problems 
so  are you teaching 
i repair boats 
  please 
  i m not bad at it either 
well  then  that explains this 
they don t sell sunscreen here 
i wear sunscreen 
not enough  and you need a hat 
a big hat that shades your face and neck 
you re playing russian roulette
with your skin 
  you look like porn producer 
  okay 
i appreciate the advice  i do 
but we re not here to talk about
sunscreen  are we 
so no more small talk  that s a shame 
okay  the enviroment you have
created for that child   
where she lives  the school she attends
it s substandard  every bit of it 
i disagree 
we re getting nowhere if we re
not being honest with eachother 
i am being honest 
i see  fine  well  i m not leaving
without her 
well  welcome to florida 
frank  please listen to reason 
at some point  are you gonna get to
conclusion   
or someone in authority are going to
spell it out for you   
that the child best interest is all that
matters 
you re gonna make me pull rank  i will 
diane didn t want you to have her 
diane   
diane didn t always think things through 
argue with propably one of the
brightest minds on the planet 
good luck going down that road 
and what do you thin she d say if she saw
how her child is living now 
do you honestly think she d be pleased 
that she s living somewhat normal life  yes 
i do 
she s not normal  and threating her such   
is negligence on a grand scale 
i know your heart s in the
right place on this 
but you are denying the girl her potential 
i can provide for her  i can enrich
her life 
come on  evelyn 
you re gonna take that girl  you are gonna
bury her in tutors   
the you ll lown her out to some
think tank
where she could talk non trivial zeros   
with a bunch of old russian guys
for the rest of her life 
and you d bury her under a rock 
look  i didn t expect you to understand the
price you have to pay for greatness 
i do  that s why i have mary in the
first place 
that s uncalled for 
your sister had a laundry list
of problems 
she could have solved navier stokes
and go down in the history
as one of the greatest mathematicians
of all time 
but she didn t  because she couldn t finish 
she was weak  weak like a father
and weak like   
well   
now  if it s who i think it is   
kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon 
you re still stubborn and vindictive 
careful  mother 
there s an apple and tree
analogy lurking 
you guys ready to order 
here s an idea 
stop thinking about me and you   
and start thinking what s best
for a child 
for any reasonable person 
a clear picture will emerge 
if it doesn t  i suggest you call
your attorney 
he ll have a bucket of beer 
let s go outside 
no 
come on  it s nice out 
i don t care 
no more math today 
is there a god 
i don t know 
just tell me 
i would if i could 
but i don t know  neither does anybody
else 
roberta knows 
no  roberta has faith   
and that s the great thing to have 
but faith s about what you think  feel 
not what you know 
what about jesus 
love that guy  do what he says 
but is he god 
i don t know 
i have an opinion 
but that s my opinion and
i could be wrong 
so why would i screw up yours 
use your head 
but don t be afraid to believe in things
habit 
there was a guy on tv who said
there was no god 
the only thing different between
the things you saw on tv and roberta
is roberta loves you  she tries to help 
tell you what though 
when we all one another 
we all end up back together at the end 
that s what you re asking  right 
yep 
okay 
find something else to worry about  will ya 
all right 
okay  adler  grandmother and uncle 
really 
sure you folks don t wanna go on the hall
and settle this 
no  well  that s a shame 
  mr  cullen  you re here for the uncle 
  yes  i am  your honor 
start charging you room and board 
mr  highsmith  you re on the wrong side
of a bay  aren t you 
i m very happy to be here  your honor 
for the record  mrs  dibbons is
representing the state of florida
child welfare department 
proceed 
your honor  my client mrs  adler
is the maternal grandmother of the child 
her daughter  the girl s mother
was the troubled woman   
who seven years ago sadly took her own
life 
it was at this time that mr  adler
primitively and illegally took
custody of the girl and spirited her
across eight lines   
for the purpose of denying my
client custody 
and there s the evidence that the
child currently lives
in unclean and unwholesome conditions 
we petition to court to grant my client
and full custoy of the child   
so that she can return to the state
of massachusetts   
and given the care to which
she is entitled 
my client took an infant under his wing
for one reason only 
it was his sister s desire
that he do so 
my client has been her
constant caregiver 
and your honor  as far as the living
conditions   
i ve been in this home 
it s fine 
i mean  if we adopt standards based on
our friend s aversion to palmetto bugs   
we won t have a child left
side of tallahassee 
all right  last chance before this starts
cost a lot more money 
your honor  my client would
need reasonable acess to the child 
so ordered 
ms  dibbons  would you go out and
check the living conditions 
on the books  your honor 
all right  folks 
drive carefully 
her lawyer has a nice suit 
relax  frank  more weight s
put on the talent competition 
go have a cocktail

there s nothing you can say that s
make me fell good   
because i have no say in any of this

dr  shankland  this problem is   
i know  just copy it exactly as
you see it written 
but it s   
exactly as written  thank you 
so what s this problem i m
supposed to look at 
i don t know 
so  it s like a problem
mom worked on 
your mother didn t work
on problems 
she worked on just
one problem 
just one 
her entire life 
most of it 
look 
these are millennium problems 
seven great and meaningful
problems 
some mathematicians have worked
their entire lives to prove them 
who s the dude with the beard 
that s not a dude 
that s grigori perelman 
he proved poincare
conjecture 
the only one of the seven
proved 
this   
this is your mother s
problem 
na   vi   
navier  stokes 
no picture 
  she didn t solve it 
  no 
she was close 
she would have won
fields medal   
and probably shared the nobel 
considering what would
meant for physics 
maybe i ll have my picture
up here someday 
if you really desire it   
you can have your picture
there  darling 
i can help you 
it takes focus and hard
work  but if you succeed   
your name will live forever 
don t be smug  seymore 
well  she s had plenty
of time 
she traveled yesterday  she
slept in a strange bed 
give her a chance 
at six years old  she read zimmer 
outstanding 
how much did she comprehend 
so  mary   
i see you re looking at
our little problem 
little  it s big 
yeah 
why are you so mad all of
the sudden 
i m not mad  i m
annoyed 
not with you  darlin   with that
pompes ass  shankland 
i knew that guy was gonna have
a beard  before we even went in there 
math teachers like to grow
beards 
i should never have agreed
to this 
did he reallly expect you to just
walk in and be able to dissect   
some random massive
problem 
not much to dissect  if
you ask me 
why  why do you say that 
it was wrong 
what 
well   for starters  he forgot
the negative sign on the exponent 
it went downhill
from there 
the problem was
unsolvable 
maybe this school isn t as
great as you think it is 
mary  you knew that the problem
was incorect  why didn t you say anything 
frank says i m not supposed to correct
older people 
nobody like a smart ass 
i m loaded with swag 
wanna come inside 
cat 
frank  i think this is stupid 
why don t we just call evelyn and
tell her i don t wanna do this 
cause as i told you  evelyn didn t
order this  the court did 
so again  what we are gonna do 
tell the truth 
exactly 
sonner we answer these questions 
sonner we get to go home 
so  no attitude  okay 
okay 
frank 
mary 
i like evelyn 
she looks like my mom 
and she has a piano 
but i don t wanna live
with her 
she s bossy 
i ve heard that 
hey 
don t worry  you re not going
anywhere 
promise 
i promise 
hi  mary  i m pat golding 
but you can call me pat  if you like 
got it 
do you know why you re here 
i mean  is anyone told you
what this is about 
my grandmother wants me to live with her 
and i wanna stay with frank 
that s correct 
i m sure this is gonna be a very
scary stuff  does any of it worry you 
nope  frank says i m not going
anywhere 
your uncle told you you re not
going anywhere 
just 15 minutes ago 
so  are we done here 
not quite yet 
my best friend other than
frank and fred is roberta 
who lives a couple house away 
really  what s she like 
she s nice and funny 
and i love her 
that s nice 
is roberta your only
friend your age 
roberta s not my age  she s like
40  50   
30 something 
roberta s grown woman 
people my age are boring 
roberta s cool 
okay 
i don t watch tv 
but i got hooked on
spongebob 
mostly because roberta
loves it 
and on saturday nights we watch
the ufc 
the ufc  is that   
is that ultimate fighting 
every saturday 
you and your uncle watch
ultimate fighting 
well  you don t just
watch it 
frank turns the sound down 
and we do grounting voices 
sometimes i attack frank
for real 
which is really fun for me 
if you guys knew frank 
you d leave us alone 
he can be pretty annoying 
but he s a good person 
i think 
why do you say that 
he wanted me before i
was smart 
mr  polland  are you the   
natural father of mary
adler 
yes  yes  i am 
and how you can be certain of this 
well  i always knew  but
then you had me   
take a dna test 
i would offer that the test results has
result of evidence of that   
mr  polland is the father and natural
guardian of the minor 
as well as an affidavit   
from mr  polland nominating   
mrs  adler the maternial grandmother
as the legal guardian of the minor 
no objections 
mr  polland   
has mrs  adler offered you any
moneytory reward or   
employment for coming forward today 
no  sir  i have a job of
my own 
thank you  no further questions 
your honor 
mr  polland   
when was the last time you
saw mary 
i ve never seen her 
why not 
by the time i heard about diane   
passing   
the baby was gone already 
well  did you try and
find her 
best i could 
i couldn t just go and search
the entire country 
do you use a computer at work 
sure 
you know what 
help me out 
let s google  mary adler 
and see what we find 
you know what 
you better add her middle name 
it ll narrow it down 
eillen 
yeah  hit enter 
page 2 
second hit 
would you please tell the court
what you see there 
it s a newspaper article called 
not so terrible twos 
and one of them is mary
eileen adler 
same name as your daugter 
born on the same day
as your daughter 
with a photograph 
in your defense  you d
never recognize it 
  your honor  this is   
  your honor 
if there s one thing here
that s sadly obvious it s that   
mr  polland has never been a genuine
guardian of the minor
and his nomination of mrs  adler is
no less disingenuous 
while the state of florida gets differents
to nomination by natural parent 
i m inclined to side with
mr  cullen s laptop
at this time 
thank you  your honor 
don t gloat 
wouldn t dream of it 
walk you to your car 
you been so proacipate 
i m almost ashamed to ask 
how s walter 
you wouldn t believe it
if i told you 
what 
well  your stepfather is
in montana 
he bought a ranch 
bullshit 
exactly  a man whose idea of
roughing it   
is being too far from the
ice machine at the rith s carlton 
now owns a 1000 acres of
grass and dung 
walter price is a cowboy 
walter price puts brooke s brother
suit to take out the garbage 
he has a cowboy hat and
cowboy boots   
and a horse that doesn t know
dressage 
is there some logical reason
for this 
midlife crisis  apparently 
he s 70 
i know 
must have been on time
delay or something 
i guess i should be happy it
wasn t 25 year old coctail waitress 
but than again in affair you can
explain to friends in a minute 
for this  you put on a pot of coffee 
and he s out there right now 
yessiree 
ridin  the range 
punchin  doggies 
he had a six gun on
his hip   
and a saddlebag full
of lipitor 
the fastest asset management
in the west 
the man who shot liberty
mutual 
that s what i ve been
calling him 
that s really  really funny 
take her to the airport 
go home  evelyn 
or montana  rustle
some cattle 
you know   
i have no desire to
hurt you 
i hate it that we re
at odds 
we re always
at odds 
yes 
hotel 
mary  baby  come on now 
stop this  stop this now 
no 
come on out  honey 
no 
why did you have to tell her
that ted was testifying 
because it s the truth 
and if i didn t 
evelyn would ve 
if i was the dad of a little girl
and i never saw her   
and i was in the same town   
i woull visit her 
well  i hope you re happy 
he didn t even need directions 
he could ve followed
you here 
speaking of man who aren t
worth a damn 
doesn t even wanna see what
i look like 
all right 
put your shoes on 
we re going for a ride 
you too 
a ride 
what are we doing here 
waiting 
we can see that 
why 
because i said so 
how long do we have to
stay here 
as long as it takes 
and keep your voice down 
it s a hospital 
  food s here 
  yeah  food is here  okay 
it s a boy 
way to go 
that s exactly how it was when you
were born 
this happy 
this happy 
who came out and told everybody 
i did 
can we stay for another 
mrs  adler  in your earlier
testimony here today   
you painted a pretty dim
picture of your son 
don t you think 
i m under oath 
i take no pleasure in it 
so  your son is failer in life 
your daughter took her life 
you know  you re oh for two 
  objection 
  withdrawn 
if i got one for three 
i m in the hall of fame 
you know baseball 
fanway park 
you know  i d like to go
there sometime 
how often in a year did
you take diane to the baseball game 
diane wasn t interested
in sports 
she never wanted to go to a game 
ever 
i don t recall her ever
asking 
just out of curiosity  fenway 
that s a tough ticket 
where do you get yours 
my husband has season tickets 
and how long has he
had them 
30 years 
but i ve only been married
to him for 20 
and diane never went to
one game 
what color was the dress diane
wore to prom 
diane didn t attend the prom 
because she didn t attend the highschool 
no prom 
what sports did she play 
as i told you earlier  she
wasn t interested in sports 
  did she go to camp during the summer 
  no 
  community swimming pool 
  we had our own pool 
  girl scouts 
  no 
then what did she do with
all that time 
she loved the mathematics 
it was her passion 
she preferred it to all
other things 
all other 
mrs  adler  who s
paul riva 
he was a boy from the
neighbourhood 
oh  come on  he was much more
than just a boy from the neighbourhood 
paul was diane s first love 
wasn t he 
i wouldn t caracterize it that way  no 
and how would diane
caracterize it 
diane was 17 years old at the time 
she didn t know anything about
love 
mrs  adler   
in january in 1989   
didn t diane and young
mr  riva run away together 
he coerced her 
  and where did they go 
  vermont 
  and you called the police  didn t you 
  yes 
  because he kidnapped her 
  yes 
and where police found young
mr  riva and diane 
i told you  vermont 
stowe  vermont 
wasn t it 
a resort town 
stowe mountain 
he took her skiing 
you see  kidnappers don t usually
take their victims skiing 
but this is what paul did   
because he and diane were
in love 
no 
and when they returned 
you pressed kidnapping charges 
you filed the lawsuit against
his parents   
until paul stopped calling
diane 
  didn t you 
  yes 
and diane never heard of or
saw paul riva again 
did she 
not to my knowledge 
and how did she take it 
she was upset for a while 
she lost focus 
she lost focus 
mrs  adler  in march of 1999   
didn t diane adler attempt to
take her own life 
this episode was minor 
it was nothing 
i have the hospital
report in my hand 
it was nothing 
diane was not like
regular people 
she was extrodinary 
and extrodinary people come with
singular issues and needs 
you have no idea of capability
she possesed 
one in a billion 
and you would say    fine  let s throw that away 
so the boy who cuts our yard can make sexy concrest 
well maybe before you make that
decision  you stand in my shoes 
i had responsibilities  which are beyond
the mother dauther relationship 
the greateest discoveries  which have
proved life on this planet   
have come from minds rarer
than radium 
without them  we d still be
crawling in mud 
and for your information 
conselor   
a year after this incident with
this boy   
diane thanked me for my
intervention 
she realized she d made a mistake and
she thanked me 
you see  diane understood  she s been a
contible for a gift she d been given 
and she didn t shy from it 
and i think  if she were here today 
mr  atorney 
she would refute your baseless insinuations  that she
would give up her brilliant future and take her own life
just because her mummy didn t get
her a little red wagon 
no more questions 
mr  adler   
where are you currently
employed 
i repair boats 
oh  really 
at which marina 
i don t work at the marina 
i freelance 
so  safe to say  no health
insurance 
no 
about a week before your
sister took her life   
what were you doing for
a living then 
i was a teacher 
you re being modest  aren t you 
you were a professor at boston university   
isn t that right 
yes  weel  assistant professor 
and what d you teach 
philosophy 
truth and logic  that sort
of thing 
your attorney said that the
primary reason   
that you took mary is because what your
sister would ve wanted you to do 
is that a truth 
yes 
so diane chad visited pinellas
county before 
no 
indicated she wanted her daughter
rooted and moved here 
no 
no 
so you decided to bring mary
here  didn t you 
did diane had a problem with your
health plan at boston university 
not to my knowledge 
do you think she would want her
dauther to have access to healthcare 
of course 
so what do you do  when a little
mary gets sick 
you repair a doctor s boat 
objection 
sustained 
mary has been identified as
a math prodigy 
but her formal math education
under your care   
she s learning at the first grade level 
isn t she 
yes 
and you turned out the scolarship
at the oaks   
a school specialized for the education
of gifted children 
yes 
and diane  she d be fine with that 
i couldn t say 
prody to mrs  adler giving her one 
did mary have a computer 
she used mine 
mr  adler  does diane s daughter
have her own bedroom 
no 
does she sleep in a bed that you bought   
  in a secondhand shop 
  yes 
so  the truth is  mr  adler 
that you didn t come down here 
because your sister wanted it to 
and you certantly didn t come here
because it was good for mary 
no  it was personal 
diane was a star  you
weren t 
diane got the attention 
you didn t 
nobody use  you got angry 
and here comes mary 
what a great way to get even 
you ve uprooted that litlle girl and brought
her here for 1 reason only 
to do harm to your mother 
you blamed her for your sister 
no  i don t 
and mary to you is just a paawn
in all this 
diane wanted mary   
to be a kid 
she wanted her to have a life 
she wanted her to have friends   
and to play   
and to be happy 
you realize the consequences of boredom
for a gifted child  mr  adler 
they become resentful and
sullen 
mary s not an angry kid 
really 
did she not attack a child
on the school bus 
a 12 year old tripped a 7 year old and
she came to his defense 
  did she brake the boy s nose 
  yes 
on october 16th last year  were you
arrested for assault 
oh  my god 
you have to answer the question 
mr  adler 
a drunk idiot attacked me and i
defended myself 
did you spend the night in jail 
yeah 
you are in way over your head here 
you re depriving that girl 
you re gambling with her future   
and now you being presented with
an opportunity   
  to do right by her 
  does concil have a question for my client 
take the high road  mr  adler   
  before she s rapidly damaged 
  does concil have a question   
  for my client or not 
  yes  sir  i do have a question 
tell us  is your continued guardianship
really in the best interest
of this litlle girl 
yes 
yes  it is 
i have no further questions 
mr  jim emeliot has come up with
a brand new fred cheer 
fred personally asked me if i
would tell you it 
let s hear it 
s o c k i t sock it to me 
freddy   
sock it 
sock it 
tell r and d  they got a winner 
that s exactly what i said 
s o c k i t  sock it to me 
freddy 
they wanna cut a deal 
highsmith called me first thing
this morning 
why would he do that 
i don t understand 
just listen  listen to me  man 
  mary would be put in fostering situation 
  no 
come on  frank 
  it wouldn t be a court appointed foster family 
  cullen  i told you no

  we can cherry pick   
from the cream of the crop 
muturally approved 
just hear me out 
tampa 
i insisted  and they agreed 
no more than a half an hour
from your front door 
now  she would attend the oaks 
it s a great school 
and visiting rights for the grandmother 
but she was gonna get that anyway 
right  and on her 12th birthday  frank
she can go back into court   
  no 
  and decide then   
where she wants to live and who 
you supposed to be on my team 
why are you bringing me this deal 
other than i m required to
by a law 
you like this deal 
i love this deal 
they think they re gonna lose 
yeah 
they do 
you think we re gonna lose 
yes 
i do  frank 
i gotta go put my kids to bed 
i ll do whatever you want me to do 
but  if we leave this up to
that judge   
nick knows  he s a old school 
frank 
does he like your mother  no 
does he like her income 
does he like her health plan 
does he like her home 
you better believe it 
i ve been in his courtroom 
a hundred times 
and if it s a coin toss   
look at me 
if it s a coin toss   
that old boy is going
to side with the money 
so  do me a favor  frank 
just meet the family 
see how it feels 
it s all i ask 
d fly away litlle prety bird d
d fly  fly away d

on one hand  good challenging scool   
on the other   
foster people 
they can watch sitcoms with her 
take her to olive garden 
teach her to say 
 irregardless

that she is better off than she was 
goodbye  frank

designing a water pump that leaks
or putting it someone no human being can reach 
how you design something you

gotta be devious or clueless 
right 
after the first few weeks  i knew
i had to find a real family for her 
i was in way over my head 
and every day i d say 
 today s the day    
  i m taking her to child services  
and every day she d do
something just   
so unbelievably cool 
her little personality was exploding 
she was funny 
and she was angry  and she was happy 
and she was   
sad 
and was cute 
just so damn entertaining 
and so i kept her 
not that that s in her best interest 
not that i m capable of raising a child 
a child that might still have a mother if i d taken
the time to notice she needed me 
and now  six and a half years later   
i finally got her to a foster family
and you know what 
it was great  she loved it 
i thought it would be a nightmare
of abandonment and betrayal 
and it turns out it was
a huge success 
i m fucking hero 
  frank   
  no  bonnie   
i appreciate everything you ve done 
just   
  hey

you know  she needs time 
just give me 5 minutes with her 
i let you inside and then
we re gonna betray her trust and have
even bigger problem

i got him  he s home 
what 
he s at the apartment right now 
i got him 
for real 
yeah  he s home kicking around his
ping pong ball 
why did you leave me there 
because i thought i was bad
for you 
and then it dawned on me 
if mary is this amazing   
smart  sweet human being   
then i must be doing something right 
you re smilling 
roberta 
baby 
of all the stunts you could pull 
  where are they going 
  nowhere  not yet 
you two  out 
  what is this 
  do you want to know   
how diane told me she finished 
what is this unconscionable lie 
i walked in the appartment and she was
sitting on the floor   
with that baby in her arms and you know what she said to me 
  admit it 
you made this up 
  she said   what do i do now  
  no 
  it s not a completed proof   
it is 
no  it isn t  it can t be 
evelyn  stop 
i m taking mary and i m raising her how i
believe diane would have wanted it 
  we ll see about this later 
  i realize   
she s not normal  but if einstein can
ride a bike so can she 
let just say diane didn t tell me 
which is nonsense 
it s a millenium problem  she would
have shared it with the world 
that s where your charade falls apart 
if she would completed the proof 
she would have published it 
diane instructed me very clearly 
that i was only o publish it

what i want you to notice is
when you compute p and n
for n congruent to four mod five   
the answer is a multiple of five 
the first person to notice this
was romanujan 
in the beginning of 20th
century   
he proved that it was a case for all   
numbers congruent to four mod five 
so  he proved that p of five n
plus four   
is congruent to zero mod seven   
and p of eleven n plus six is
congruent   
good
