  maybe i like garbage 
  c mon  nobody likes garbage 
anyway  this girl wasn t bad looking

  why 
guys laugh when you talk dirty 
they think you re cute 
if you get a reputation 
you get no respect  you understand 
you get no respect 
i gotta use a bad word

you see  they don t remember you 
they remember the rep  you understand 
hey  you got a boyfriend

  somethin  like that 
  night  rocky 
  night  marie  take care 
  hey  rocky 
  yo 
  screw you  creepo 
yeah  who are you to give advice  creepo 
who are you 
  are the doctor s reports confirmed 
  definitely 
it says that green has suffered a severely
cracked third metacarpal in his left hand 
we can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you re set on fighting green 
hey  it ain t just green  what about
all the time apollo has invested 
  i believe we can find a solution 
  solution nothin  
find me another contender in a flash 
jergens 
don t play games with my client  he s
done a million dollars  worth of publicity   
   and has made contractual obligations 
  he s not going to be embarrassed 
  i contacted ernie roman s manager 
  ernie is fighting in france that week 
  buddy shaw  he s ranked fifth 
went to california and gained 50 pounds 
i got hold of every worthwhile contender   
   and they all say five weeks
isn t enough time to get into shape 
shape nothin   man  they afraid  they
know everybody s gonna see the fight 
none of  em can whip me 
they re makin  excuses   
   so they don t get whipped
in front of the whole world 
all i can say is i m a good promoter 
i ve promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world   
   and i ve broken my ass over this 
but i don t know what the hell else to do 
i do 
without a ranked contender 
what this fight is gonna need is a novelty 
this is the land of opportunity  right 
so apollo creed on january 1 gives
a local underdog fighter an opportunity 
a snow white underdog  and i m gonna
put his face on this poster with me 
and i ll tell you why 
because i m sentimental 
like a lot of other people in this country 
there s nothing they d like better than
to see apollo creed give a local boy   
   a shot at the world title
on this country s biggest birthday 
now that s the way i see it 
and that s the way it s gonna be 
apollo  i like it 
it s very american 
no  jergens  it s very smart 
 jergens laughs 
  what is it

years ago  this guy was fightin  
i think it was around philadelphia 
he was left handed 
his arm was facin  towards new jersey 
and that s south 
so they called him southpaw 
you see  southpaw  south jersey   
   south camden  southpaw   
you know what i mean 
things worked out for the best 
you never got a chance 
being left handed 
well  that s absolutely true 
you know  watch out  watch out

rocky  i ve got a proposition
i d like to make to you 
  about sparrin  
  i beg your pardon 
i know you re lookin  for sparrin  partners
and i wanna say i m very available 
  i m sure you are 
  absolutely  it would be an honour 
and you know what 
i wouldn t take no cheap shots 
  i d really be a good sparrin  partner 
  you don t understand me  rocky 
my proposition s this  would you be
interested in fighting apollo creed   
   for the world
heavyweight championship 
  no 
  listen  rocky   
   apollo s seen you fight 
he likes you  he wants to fight you 
well  it s just that  you see  uh 
i fight in clubs  you know 
i m really a ham and egger  this guy is
the best  it wouldn t be such a good fight 
but thank you very much 
you know  i appreciate it 
rocky  do you believe that america
is the land of opportunity 
yeah 
apollo creed does 
and he s gonna prove it to the world
by giving an unknown a shot at the title 
and that unknown is you 
he picked you  rocky 
rocky  it s the chance of a lifetime 
you can t pass it by 
what do ya say 
all right  that s enough pictures 
we wanna ask apollo a few questions 
how do you like
the city of brotherly love 
well  just bein  in philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic 
beautiful people in a beautiful city
wishin  me the best 
i love my philadelphia brothers 
i m proud to be an american 
apollo  why did you agree to fight a man
who has virtually no chance of winning 
look  if history proves one thing   
american history proves that
everybody s got a chance to win 
didn t you guys ever hear of
valley forge or bunker hill 
it is a coincidence that
you re fighting a white man   
    on the most celebrated day
in us history 
i don t know  is it a coincidence that he s
fightin  a black man on the same day 
right on  tell the truth  brother

tell me  rocky  just between us   
    where did you get
the name  ltalian stallion

   that what happened to you is freak luck 
  yeah  freak luck 
  ain t it true  look at the other guys 
they re good fighters 
they re colourful  they got good records 
they fight their guts out for peanuts

  freak luck is a strange thing 
  yeah  sure it is  can i sit down 
yeah  sure 
  what the hell are those 
  oh  they re domestic turtles 
the one on top is cuff and
the other is link  the rest are marbles 
yeah  they make good soup  do they 
anyway  look  i m here to warn ya   
   that you gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title 
because  i don t know  like the bible says 
you ain t gonna get a second chance 
  yeah  all right 
  you thought of that  huh 
well  what you need is a manager 
a manager  listen to me 
i know  because i ve been
in this racket for 50 years 
  50 years  huh 
  50 years  god  i ve seen it all 
all of it  you know what i done 
  what 
  i have done it all 
you shoulda seen me when
i knocked giny russel outta the ring 
outta the goddamn ring  i tell ya 
september 14  1923 
and it was the same night that
firpo knocks dempsey outta the ring 
  the same night  who gets the publicity 
  dempsey

  cos he was champ 
no  because he had a manager 
i had nothin   man

that fight with sailor mike 
i got the clippin  here  a good fight 
read that 
well  it doesn t matter 
anyway  he put this vegetation on my ear 
ah  rocky marciano 
you know  you kinda remind me
of the rock  do you know that 
  you really think so 
  that s right  you move like him 
and you got heart  like he did 
yeah  i got heart 
but i ain t got no locker  do i  mick 
uh    anyway  you know   
   when i begun in this business  kid   
look  i wanna make a suggestion 
don t drink that piss before a fight 
it s no good for ya 
you don t mind my sayin     
anyway  when i started this racket 
pugs like us  we was treated like dogs 
for  10  you gotta tear somebody s throat
out  but i never had no management 
one time  this son of a bitch
that i fought  he put a nail right there 
  in his thumb 
  yeah  in the glove 
and he punched
so many holes in my face   
   i had this spit shootin  outta my cheeks 
can you imagine that 
when i tell you what i looked like
when i was in my prime   
i want ya to look at somethin  
will ya look at that 
that s the way i looked
before these guys got at me

that was the trouble 
now i got all this knowledge 
i got it up here and i wanna give it to you 
i wanna take care of you  i wanna make
sure all this shit that happened to me

uh  well  my friend 
the guy over there  he let me in one day 
i hit the beef and i kinda liked it 
since i ve become a challenger 
the owner don t mind neither
