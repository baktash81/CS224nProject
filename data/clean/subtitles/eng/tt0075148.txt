who talked like that you know just one
what you doin
thatll make your teeth yellow
i like yellow teeth
and your breath like garbage
maybe i like garbage
cmon nobody likes garbage
anyway this girl wasnt badlooking
but guys never took her serious
you see
they never took her out for a date
why
guys laugh when you talk dirty
they think youre cute
if you get a reputation
you get no respect you understand
you get no respect
i gotta use a bad word
whore you understand whore
you see if you use dirty words
you maybe end up becomin a whore
come on rocky im 12
hey that dont matter youre 12
you dont really have to be one
you just act like one and thats it  boom
you get a bad rep you understand
20 years from now people are
gonna say do you remember marie

hung down at the atomic hoagie shop
oh yeah now i remember her
you see they dont remember you
they remember the rep you understand
hey you got a boyfriend

hey rocky
yo
screw you creepo
yeah who are you to give advice creepo
who are you
are the doctors reports confirmed
definitely
it says that green has suffered a severely
cracked third metacarpal in his left hand
we can cancel the fight indefinitely
if youre set on fighting green
hey it aint just green what about
all the time apollo has invested
i believe we can find a solution
solution nothin
find me another contender in a flash
jergens
dont play games with my client hes
done a million dollars worth of publicity
and has made contractual obligations
hes not going to be embarrassed
i contacted ernie romans manager
ernie is fighting in france that week
buddy shaw hes ranked fifth
went to california and gained 50 pounds
i got hold of every worthwhile contender
and they all say five weeks
isnt enough time to get into shape
shape nothin man they afraid they
know everybodys gonna see the fight
none of em can whip me
theyre makin excuses
so they dont get whipped
in front of the whole world
all i can say is im a good promoter
ive promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world
and ive broken my ass over this
but i dont know what the hell else to do
i do
without a ranked contender
what this fight is gonna need is a novelty
this is the land of opportunity right
so apollo creed on january 1 gives
a local underdog fighter an opportunity
a snowwhite underdog and im gonna
put his face on this poster with me
and ill tell you why
because im sentimental
like a lot of other people in this country
theres nothing theyd like better than
to see apollo creed give a local boy
a shot at the world title
on this countrys biggest birthday
now thats the way i see it
and thats the way its gonna be
apollo i like it
its very american
no jergens its very smart
jergens laughs

rocky do you believe that america
is the land of opportunity

apollo creed does
and hes gonna prove it to the world
by giving an unknown a shot at the title
and that unknown is you
he picked you rocky
rocky its the chance of a lifetime
you cant pass it by
what do ya say

we wanna ask apollo a few questions
how do you like
the city of brotherly love
well just bein in philadelphia
makes me feel patriotic
beautiful people in a beautiful city
wishin me the best
i love my philadelphia brothers
im proud to be an american
apollo why did you agree to fight a man
who has virtually no chance of winning
look if history proves one thing
american history proves that
everybodys got a chance to win
didnt you guys ever hear of
valley forge or bunker hill
it is a coincidence that
youre fighting a white man
on the most celebrated day
in us history

about this shot that you got at the title
because i dont know like the bible says
you aint gonna get a second chance
yeah all right
you thought of that huh

in this racket for 50 years
50 years huh

all of it you know what i done
what
i have done it all
you shoulda seen me when
