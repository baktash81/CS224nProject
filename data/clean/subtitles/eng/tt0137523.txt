this is it ground zero
do you have a speech for the occasion
with a gun barrel between your teeth
you speak only in vowels
i cant think of anything
for a second i forget about
tylers controlled demolition thing
and i wonder how clean that gun is
its getting exciting now
that old thing
how you always hurt the one you love
well it works both ways
we have frontrow seats
for this theater of mass destruction
the demolitions committee
of project mayhem
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives
in two minutes
primary charges will blow base charges
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble
i know this because tyler knows this
two and a half
think of everything weve accomplished
suddenly i realize that all of this
the gun the bombs the revolution
has got something to do
with a girl named marla singer
bob bob had bitch tits
this was a support group
for men with testicular cancer
the big moosie slobbering all over me
that was bob
were still men
yes were men
men is what we are
bob had had his testicles removed
then hormone therapy
he developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high
and his body upped the oestrogen
that was where i fit
theyll have to drain my pecs again
between those huge sweating tits
that hung enormous
the way youd think of gods as big
ok you cry now
no wait back up let me start earlier
for six months i couldnt sleep
i couldnt sleep
with insomnia nothings real
everythings far away
everythings a copy of a copy
of a copy
when deep space exploration ramps up
itll be the corporations that name everything
the ibm stellar sphere
the microsoft galaxy
the planet starbucks
i need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags
it must have been tuesday
he had on his cornflower blue tie
you want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade
prioritize these heres your flight coupons
call me if theres any snags
he was full of pep
must have had his grande latte enema
like so many others i had become
a slave to the ikea nesting instinct
yes id like to order
the erika pekkari dust ruffles
please hold
anything clever
like a coffee table in the shape of a yinyang
i had to have it
the klipsk personal office unit
the hovetrekke home exerbike
or the ohamshab sofa
with the strinne green stripe pattern
even the ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentallyfriendly unbleached paper
id flip through catalogues and wonder
what kind of dining set
defines me as a person
i had it all even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections
proof that they were crafted by the honest
hardworking indigenous peoples of
please hold
wherever
we used to read pornography
now it was the horchow collection
no you cant die of insomnia
what about narcolepsy
i nod off i wake up in strange places
i have no idea how i got there
you need to lighten up
can you please just give me something
red and blue tuinals lipstickred seconals
no you need healthy natural sleep
chew some valerian root
and get more exercise
hey come on
im in pain
you wanna see pain
swing by first methodist tuesday nights
see the guys with testicular cancer
thats pain
i always wanted three kids
two boys and a girl
mindy wanted two girls and a boy
we never could agree on anything
well i she
she had her first child last week
a girl
with with her with her new husband
fuck
thank god you know
im glad for her
she deserves
everyone lets thank thomas
for sharing himself with us
thank you thomas
i look around this room
and i see a lot of courage
and that gives me strength
we give each other strength
its time for the oneonones
so lets all of us follow thomass example
and really open ourselves up
could you find a partner
and this is how i met the big moosie
his eyes already shrinkwrapped in tears
knees together those awkward little steps
my name is bob
bob
bob had been a champion bodybuilder
you know that chest expansion programme
on latenight tv
that was his idea
i was a juicer
you know using steroids
diabonal and
wisterol
oh they use that on racehorses
for christ sakes
and now im bankrupt
im divorced
my two grown kids
wont even return my phone calls
strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big rubbery one
go ahead cornelius
you can cry
and then something happened
i let go
thats really good
lost in oblivion
dark and silent and complete
i found freedom
losing all hope was freedom
its ok
babies dont sleep this well
i became addicted
if i didnt say anything
people always assumed the worst
they cried harder then i cried harder
now were going to open the green door
the heart chakra
i wasnt really dying
i wasnt host to cancer or parasites
i was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around
imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light
it moves over your body healing you
now keep this going remember to breathe
and step forward
through the back door of the room
where does it lead
to your cave
step forward
into your cave
thats right
youre going deeper into your cave
and youre going to find
your power animal
slide
every evening i died
and every evening i was born again
resurrected
bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too
being there pressed against his tits
ready to cry
this was my vacation
and she
ruined everything
this is cancer right
this chick marla singer
did not have testicular cancer
she was a liar
she had no diseases at all
i had seen her at free and clear
my blood parasites group thursdays
then at hope
my bimonthly sicklecell circle
and again at seize the day
my tuberculosis friday night
marla
the big tourist
her lie reflected my lie
and suddenly i felt nothing
i couldnt cry so once again
i couldnt sleep
next group after guided meditation
after we open our heart chakras
when its time to hug
im gonna grab that bitch
marla singer and scream
marla you liar
you big tourist i need this now get out
i hadnt slept in four days
well just let that dry
when you have insomnia
youre never really asleep
and youre never really awake
to begin tonights communion
chloe would like to say a few words
oh yeah chloe
chloe looked the way meryl streeps skeleton
would look if you made it walk around
being extra nice to everybody
well im still here
but i dont know for how long
thats as much certainty
as anyone can give me
but ive got some good news
i no longer have any fear of death
but i am in a pretty lonely place
noone will have sex with me
im so close to the end
and all i want is to get laid for the last time
i have pornographic movies
in my apartment
and lubricants and amyl nitrite
thank you chloe
everyone lets thank chloe
thank you chloe
now lets ready ourselves
for guided meditation
youre standing at the entrance of your cave
you step inside your cave and you walk
if i did have a tumor id name it marla
marla
the scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it
but you cant
deeper into your cave as you walk
you feel a healing energy all around you
now find your power animal
slide
ok lets partner up
pick someone special to you tonight
hey
we need to talk

and theres free coffee
look this is important
these are my groups
ive been coming for over a year
why do you do it
i dont know
when people think youre dying
they listen to you instead of
instead of waiting for their turn to speak
yeah yeah
share yourself completely
look you dont want to get into this
it becomes an addiction
really
im not kidding i cant cry
if another faker is present and i need this
you gotta find somewhere else to go
candystripe a cancer ward
its not my problem
no wait a second hold on
well split up the week ok

lets not make a big thing out of it
hows this for not making a big thing
hey marla
marla
maybe we should exchange numbers
should we
we might wanna switch nights
ok
this is how i met marla singer
marlas philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment
the tragedy she said was that she didnt
it doesnt have your name
who are you cornelius rupert
travis any of the stupid names
you give each night
you wake up at seatac
sfo lax
you wake up at ohare
dallas fort worth
bwi
pacific mountain central
lose an hour gain an hour
the checkin for that flight
isnt for another two hours sir
this is your life
and its ending one minute at a time
you wake up at air harbor international
if you wake up at a different time
in a different place
could you wake up as a different person
everywhere i travel
tiny life
singleserving sugar and cream
single pat of butter
the microwave cordon bleu hobby kit
shampooconditioner combos
samplepackage mouthwash
tiny bars of soap
the people i meet on each flight
theyre singleserving friends
between takeoff and landing
we have our time together
thats all we get
welcome
on a long enough time line
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero
i was a recall coordinator
my job was to apply the formula
the infant went through the windshield
a new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph
the rear differential locks up
the teenagers braces
are stuck to the ashtray
might make a good antismoking ad
the car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside
now should we initiate a recall
the father must have been huge
see where the fat burned to the seat
the polyester shirt
very modern art
take the number of vehicles in the field a
multiply it by the probable rate of failure b
multiply the result by
the average outofcourt settlement c
a x b x c
equals x
if x is less than the cost of a recall
we dont do one
are there a lot of these kinds of accidents
you wouldnt believe
which car company do you work for
a major one
every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing
i prayed for a crash or a midair collision
anything
life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip
if you are seated in an emergency exit row
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties
listed on the safety card please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you
its a lot of responsibility
wanna switch seats
no im not sure
im the man for that particularjob
an exitdoor procedure at 30000ft
the illusion of safety
yeah i guess so
you know why
they put oxygen masks on planes
so you can breathe
oxygen gets you high
in a catastrophic emergency
you take giant panic breaths
suddenly you become euphoric docile
you accept your fate
its all right here
emergency water landing 600mph
blank faces calm as hindu cows
thats
thats an interesting theory
what do you do
what do you mean
what do you do for a living
why so you can pretend youre interested
ok
you have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh
we have the exact same briefcase
soap
sorry
i make and i sell soap
the yardstick of civilization
and this is how i met
tyler durden
did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice you can make napalm
no i did not is that true
thats right
one can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items
really
if one was so inclined
tyler you are by far the most interesting
singleserving friend i have ever met
everything on a plane is singleserving
oh i get it very clever
thank you
hows it working out for you
what
being clever
great
keep it up then right up
a question of etiquette
as i pass do i give you the ass or the crotch
how i came to live with tyler is
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage
was it ticking
throwers know modern bombs dont tick
sorry throwers
baggage handlers
but when a suitcase vibrates
the throwers have got to call the police
my suitcase was vibrating
nine times out of ten
its an electric razor
but every once in a while
its a dildo
its company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo
we have to use the indefinite article
a dildo never
your dildo
i dont own
i had everything in that suitcase
my ck shirts
my dknyshoes my ax ties
never mind
hey thats my car
home was a condo on the 15th floor
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals
the walls were solid concrete
a foot of concrete is important
when your nextdoor neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume
or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night
i suppose these things happen
theres nothing up there
you cant go into the unit police orders
do you have somebody you can call
how embarrassing
a houseful of condiments and no food
the police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out
letting out just a little bit of gas
that gas could have filled the condo
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days
then the refrigerators compressor
could have clicked on
yeah
i can hear you breathing
if you ask me now
i couldnt tell you why i called him
hello
whos this
tyler
who is this
we met we met on the airplane
we had the same suitcase
the clever guy
oh yeah right
i called a second ago there was no answer
im at a payphone
yeah i 69d you i never pick up my phone
so whats up
well
youre not gonna believe this
you know it could be worse
a woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car
theres always that i dont know
when you buy furniture
you tell yourself thats it
thats the last sofa ill need
whatever happens
that sofa problem is handled
i had it all
i had a stereo that was very decent
a wardrobe that was getting very respectable
i was close to being complete
shit man now its all gone
all gone
all gone
do you know what a duvet is
a comforter
its a blanket
just a blanket why do guys
like you and i know what a duvet is
is this essential to our survival
in the huntergatherer sense
no
what are we then
i dunno consumers
right were consumers
we are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
murder crime poverty
these things dont concern me
what concerns me are celebrity magazines
television with 500 channels
some guys name on my underwear rogaine
viagra olestra
martha stewart
fuck martha stewart
shes polishing the brass on the titanic
its all going down
so fuck off with your sofa units
and strinne green stripe patterns
i say never be complete
i say stop being perfect
i say lets evolve
let the chips fall where they may
but thats me and i could be wrong
maybe its a terrible tragedy
its just stuff not a tragedy
you did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living
fuck youre right i dont smoke
my insurance is probably gonna cover it so
what
the things you own end up owning you
do what you like man
oh its late
hey thanks for the beer
yeah man
i should find a hotel
what
what
a hotel
yeah
just ask man
what are you talking about
oh god three pitchers of beer
and you still cant ask
what
you called me
because you needed a place to stay
oh hey no no no
yes you did so just ask
cut the foreplay and just ask man
would would that be a problem
is it a problem for you to ask
can i stay at your place
yeah
thanks
i want you to do me a favor
yeah sure
i want you to hit me as hard as you can
what
i want you to hit me as hard as you can
let me tell you a little bit about tyler durden
tyler was a night person
while the rest of us slept he worked
he had one parttime job as a projectionist
a movie doesnt come all on one big reel
it comes on a few
someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment
that one reel ends and the next one begins
you can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen
in the industry we call them cigarette burns
thats the cue for a changeover
he flips the projectors movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea
why would anyone want this shitjob
because it affords him
interesting opportunities
like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films
so when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet
thats when youll catch a flash
of tylers contribution to the film
nobody knows that they saw it but they did
nice big cock
even a hummingbird
couldnt catch tyler at work
tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious pressman hotel
he was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry
do not watch i cannot go when you watch
apart from seasoning the lobster bisque
he farted on meringues
and as for the cream of mushroom soup
go ahead tell em
you get the idea
you just want me to hit you
come on do me this one favor
why
i dont know never been in a fight you
no but thats a good thing
you cant know yourself if you havent
i dont wanna die without any scars
come on hit me before i lose my nerve
oh god this is crazy
so go crazy let it rip
i dont know about this
i dont either
who gives a shit noones watching
what do you care
this is crazy you want me to hit you
thats right
where like in the face
surprise me
this is so fucking stupid
motherfucker
he hit me in the ear
well jesus im sorry
ow christ
why the ear man
i fucked it up
no that was perfect
no its all right
it really hurts
right
hit me again
no you hit me come on
we should do this again sometime
wheres your car
what car
i dont know how tyler found that house
but he said hed been there for a year
it looked like it was waiting to be torn down
most of the windows were boarded up
there was no lock on the front door from
when the police or whoever kicked it in
the stairs were ready to collapse
i didnt know if he owned it or was squatting
neither would have surprised me
yep thats you
thats me thats the toilet good
yeah thanks
what a shithole
nothing worked
turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out
there were no neighbors
just warehouses and a paper mill
that fart smell of steam
the hamstercage smell of wood chips
what have we here
hey guys
hey
every time it rained we had to kill the power
by the end of the first month
i didnt miss tv
i didnt even mind the warm stale refrigerator
can i be next
all right man
lose the tie
at night tyler and i were alone
for half a mile in every direction
rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures
everything wooden swelled and shrank
everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on
the previous occupant had been a shutin
hey man what are you reading
listen to this its an article written
by an organ in the first person
i am jacks medulla oblongata
without me
jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing
theres a whole series of these
i am jills nipples
i am jacks colon
i get cancer i kill jack
after fighting everything else
in life got the volume turned down
what
you could deal with anything
have you finished those reports
if you could choose
who would you fight
id fight my boss probably
really
yeah why who would you fight
id fight my dad
i dont know my dad
i mean i know him but
he left when i was like six years old
married this other woman
and had some other kids
he did this every six years
he changes city and starts a new family
fuckers setting up franchises
my dad never went to college
so it was real important that i go
that sounds familiar
so i graduate call him up longdistance
and say dad now what
he says get ajob
same here
now im 25 make my yearly call again
dad now what
he says i dunno get married
you cant get married
im a 30yearold boy
were a generation of men raised by women
im wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need
most of the week we were ozzie and harriet
but every saturday night
we were finding something out
we were finding out more and more
that we were not alone
it used to be that when i came home angry
or depressed id just clean my condo
polish my scandinavian furniture
i should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company
i should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit
but i wasnt
the premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient
monday mornings
i just thought about next week
can i get the icon in cornflower blue
absolutely
efficiency is priority no1 people
because waste is a thief
i showed this to my man here
you liked it didnt you
you can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick
it was right in everyones face
tyler and i just made it visible
it was on the tip of everyones tongue
tyler and i just gave it a name
come on youve gotta go home
turn off the jukebox lock the back
every week
tyler gave the rules that he and i decided
gentlemen
welcome to fight club
the first rule of fight club is
you do not talk about fight club
the second rule of fight club is
you do not talk about fight club
third rule of fight club
someone yells stop goes limp taps out
the fight is over fourth rule
only two guys to a fight
fifth rule
one fight at a time fellas
sixth rule no shirts no shoes
seventh rule
fights will go on as long as they have to
and the eighth and final rule
if this is your first night at fight club
you have to fight
this kid from work ricky
couldnt remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black
but ricky was a god for ten minutes
when he trounced
the maitre d of a local food court
sometimes all you could hear were the flat
hard packing sounds over the yelling
or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed
stop
you werent alive anywhere
like you were there
but fight club only exists in the hours
between when fight club starts and ends
even if i could tell someone
they had a good fight
i wouldnt be talking to the same man
who you were in fight club
is not who you were outside of it
a guy came to fight club for the first time
his ass was a wad of cookie dough
after a few weeks he was carved out of wood
if you could fight any celebrity
who would you fight
alive or dead
doesnt matter whod be tough
hemingway you
shatner id fight william shatner
we all started seeing things differently
everywhere we went
we were sizing things up
i felt sorry for guys packed into gyms
trying to look like how calvin klein
or tommy hilfiger said they should
is that what a man looks like
oh selfimprovement is masturbation
now selfdestruction
excuse me
fight club wasnt about winning or losing
it wasnt about words
the hysterical shouting was in tongues
like at a pentecostal church
is that it
stop
when the fight was over nothing was solved
but nothing mattered
cool
afterwards we all felt saved
hey man how about next week
how about next month
irvine youre in the middle
new guy you too
sometimes tyler spoke for me
he fell down some stairs
i fell down some stairs
fight club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails
ok any historical figure
id fight gandhi
good answer
how about you
lincoln
lincoln
big guy big reach
skinny guys fight till theyre burger
fuck
hey even the mona lisas falling apart
hello

its for men only
like the testicle thing
look this is a bad time
ive been going to debtors anonymous
theyre really fuckedup people
im on my way out
me too ive got a stomach full of xanax
i took what was left of a bottle
it might have been too much
picture marla singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment
this isnt a forreal suicide thing
this is probably a cryforhelp thing
so youre staying in tonight then
do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death
do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone
have you ever heard a death rattle before
tylers door was closed id been here for
two months and his door was never closed
you wont believe this dream
i had last night
i can hardly believe anything about last night
what are you doing here

fuck you
oh youve got some fuckedup friends
limber though
silly cooze
i come in last night phones off the hook
guess whos on the other end
i knew the story before he told me
have you ever heard a death rattle before
do you think itll live up to its name
or will it just be a death hairball
prepare to evacuate soul
ten
nine eight
how could tyler of all people
think it was a bad thing
that marla singer was about to die
five
four
hang on
you got here fast
did i call you
the mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic
oh dont worry its not a threat to you
oh fuck
somebody called the cops
hey wheres 513

used to be a charming lovely girl
she has lost faith in herself
miss singer let us help you

you have every reason to live
shes infectious human waste
miss singer
good luck trying to save her

unfuckingbelievable
he was obviously able to handle it
you know what i mean you fucked her

youre not into her are you
no god not at all
i am jacks raging bile duct
are you sure you can tell me
believe me im sure
put a gun to my head and spray my brains
thats good
shes a predator posing as a house pet
stay away
the shit that came out of
this womans mouth i had never heard
my god
i havent been fucked like that
since grade school
how could tyler not go for that
the other night
he was splicing sex organs into cinderella
marla doesnt need a lover
just a caseworker
or a wash
this isnt love its sport fucking
she invaded my support groups
and now my home
hey hey sit down
now listen
i cant have you talking to her about me
why would i
say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody were done
now promise me you promise
ok
yeah i promise
promise
i just said i promise what
thats three times you promised
if only i had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch marla singer die
none of this would have happened
harder yes oh harder harder
i could have moved to another room
on the third floor
where i might not have heard them
but i didnt
what are you doing
just going to bed
wanna finish her off
no no thank you
ive found a cigarette
who were you talking to
shut up
i became the calm little center of the world
i was the zen master
i wrote little haiku poems
i emailed them to everyone
is that your blood
some of it yeah
you cant smoke in here
take the rest of the day off
come back monday with some clean clothes
get yourself together
i got right in everyones hostile face
yes these are bruises from fighting
yes im comfortable with that
i am enlightened
you give up the condo life give up
all your flaming worldly possessions
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area
and you have to come home to this
hello
this is detective stern with the arson unit
we have some new information about
the incident at your former condo
yes
i dont know if youre aware but someone
sprayed freon into your frontdoor lock
they used a chisel to shatter the cylinder
no i wasnt aware of that
i am jacks cold sweat
does this sound strange to you
yes sir strange very strange
the dynamite
dynamite
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride
do you know what this means
no what does it mean
it means it was homemade
im sorry this is just coming
as quite a shock to me sir
whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion
the gas was just a detonator
who would go and do that
ill ask the questions
tell him
tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions
excuse me are you there
i am listening
its hard to know what to make of this
have you recently made enemies who might
have access to homemade dynamite
enemies
reject civilization
especially material possessions
son this is serious
yes i know its serious
i mean that
yes its very serious
look nobody takes this
more seriously than me
that condo was my life ok
i loved every stick of furniture in that place
that was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed
it was me
id like to thank the academy
is this not a good time for you
just tell him you fucking did it
tell him you blew it all up
thats what he wants to hear
are you still there
wait are you saying that im a suspect
no i may need to talk to you so you
let me know if youre gonna leave town
ok
ok
except for their humping
tyler and marla were never in the same room
my parents pulled this exact same act
for years
the condom is the glass slipper
of our generation
you slip one on when you meet a stranger
you dance all night
then you throw it away
the condom i mean not the stranger
what
i got this dress at a thrift store for 1
it was worth every penny
its a bridesmaids dress
someone loved it intensely
for one day
then tossed it
like a christmas tree
so special
then
bam
its on the side of the road
tinsel still clinging to it
like a sex crime victim
underwear inside out
bound with electrical tape
well then it suits you
you can borrow it sometime
get rid of her
what you get rid of her
dont mention me
i am six years old again
passing messages between parents
i really think its time you left
dont worry im leaving
not that we dont love your visits
you are such a nutcase i cant keep up
gotta get off
thanks bye
gotta get off of this merrygoround
gonna get need to get
gotta get
you kids
why do you still waste time with her
ill say this about marla
at least shes trying to hit bottom
and im not
feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken
what are we doing tonight
tonight we make soap
really
to make soap first we render fat
the salt balance has to be just right
so the best fat for soap comes from humans
wait what is this place
a liposuction clinic
pay dirt
richest creamiest fat in the world
fat of the land
no dont pull it dont pull it
oh god
give me another one
as the fat renders
the tallows float to the surface
like in boy scouts
its hard to imagine you as a boy scout
keep stirring
once the tallow hardens
you skim off a layer of glycerin
add nitric acid youve got nitroglycerin
then add sodium nitrate and sawdust
youve got dynamite
yeah with enough soap
one could blow up just about anything
tyler was full of useful information
people found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river
you know why
no
human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river
bodies burnt
water permeated the ashes to create lye
this is lye the crucial ingredient
once it mixed with the melted body fat
a white soapy discharge crept into the river
may i see your hand please
what is this
this is a chemical burn
it will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar
meditation worked for cancer
it could work now
dont shut the pain out
oh god
the first soap was made from heroes ashes
like the first monkey shot into space
without pain or sacrifice
we would have nothing
i tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh
stop it
this is your pain this is your burning hand
im going to my cave
to find my power animal
no dont deal with this
the way those dead people do come on
i get the point
no youre feeling premature enlightenment
its the greatest moment of your life
and youre off somewhere else
i am not
shut up
our fathers were our models for god
if our fathers bailed
what does that tell you about god
listen to me you have to consider
the possibility that god does not like you
he never wanted you
in all probability he hates you
this is not the worst thing that can happen
we dont need him
i agree
fuck damnation fuck redemption
we are gods unwanted children so be it
im getting water
you can use water and make it worse or
or use vinegar to neutralize the burn
please let me up
first you have to give up
first you have to know not fear
know that some day youre gonna die
you dont know how this feels
its only after weve lost everything
that were free to do anything
ok
congratulations
youre one step closer to hitting the bottom
tyler sold his soap
to department stores at 20 a bar
god knows what they charged
this is the best soap
why thank you susan
it was beautiful
we were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them
he was wearing his yellow tie
i didnt wear a tie to work any more
the first rule of fight club
is dont talk about fight club
im halfasleep again
i must have left it in the copy machine
the second rule is this yours
pretend youre me
make a managerial decision
you find this what would you do
well i gotta tell you
id be very very careful
who you talk to about that
because the person who wrote that
is dangerous
and this buttondown oxfordcloth psycho
might just snap
and then stalk from office to office
with an armalite ar10 carbine gaspowered
semiautomatic weapon
pumping round after round
into colleagues and coworkers
this might be someone
youve known for years
someone very very close to you
tylers words coming out of my mouth
and i used to be such a nice guy
or maybe you shouldnt bring me
every piece of trash you pick up
compliance and liability
my tits gonna rot off
will you excuse me i need to take this
what do you mean
i need you to check for a lump in my breast
go to a hospital
i cant afford to waste money on a doctor
i dont know about this marla

waiting tables
slaves with white collars
advertising has us chasing cars and clothes
working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we dont need
were the middle children of history
no purpose or place
we have no great war
no great depression
our great war is a spiritual war
our great depression is our lives
weve all been raised
on television to believe
that one day wed be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars
but we wont
were slowly learning that fact
and were very very pissed off

is you do not ask questions sir
the victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight
it will take dedication and commitment
and most of all cooperation
streets are safer now
there is hope in the inner city however
i gotta take a piss
these are the first steps in a long journey
that is why we have created project hope
bob
project hope will be ajoint effort
between the police and community leaders
it will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime
wrap it around the top of his hacky sack
his balls are ice cold
hi youre gonna call off
your rigorous investigation
you will publicly state
there is no underground group or
these guys are gonna take your balls
theyll send one to the new york times
and one to the la times
look
the people you are after
are the people you depend on
we cook your meals we haul your trash
we connect your calls
we drive your ambulances
we guard you while you sleep
do not fuck with us
ball check

youre stalking elk
through the grand canyon forests
around the ruins of rockefeller center
youll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life
youll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the sears tower
and when you look down
youll see tiny figures pounding corn
laying strips of venison
in the empty carpool lane
of some abandoned superhighway
feel better champ
and then
tyler

from a fight the night before
i was always just one step behind tyler
his name is robert paulsen

hello i need you to arrest me
i am the leader of a terrorist organization
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city
in the metropolitan area
we had probably 200 members
chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already
this is a tightlyregimented organization
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership
go to the house ok 1537 paper street
thats our headquarters
in the back buried in the garden
youll find the body of robert paulsen
in the basement
youre gonna find some bathtubs
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin
i believe the plan is to blow up
the headquarters
of these credit card companies
and the trw building
why these buildings
why credit card companies
if you erase the debt record
then we all go back to zero
youll create total chaos
