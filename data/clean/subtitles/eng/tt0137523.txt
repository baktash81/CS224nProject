this is it  ground zero 
do you have a speech for the occasion 
with a gun barrel between your teeth 
you speak only in vowels 
i can t think of anything 
for a second  i forget about
tyler s controlled demolition thing
and i wonder how clean that gun is 
it s getting exciting now 
that old thing 
how you always hurt the one you love 
well  it works both ways 
we have front row seats
for this theater of mass destruction 
the demolitions committee
of project mayhem
wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives 
in two minutes 
primary charges will blow base charges
and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble 
i know this because tyler knows this 
two and a half 
think of everything we ve accomplished 
suddenly i realize that all of this 
the gun  the bombs  the revolution 
has got something to do
with a girl named marla singer 
bob  bob had bitch tits 
this was a support group
for men with testicular cancer 
the big moosie slobbering all over me 
that was bob 
we re still men 
yes  we re men 
men is what we are 
bob had had his testicles removed 
then hormone therapy 
he developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high
and his body upped the oestrogen 
  that was where i fit   
  they ll have to drain my pecs again 
  between those huge sweating tits
that hung enormous 
the way you d think of god s as big 
ok  you cry now 
no  wait  back up  let me start earlier 
for six months  i couldn t sleep 
i couldn t sleep 
with insomnia  nothing s real 
everything s far away 
everything s a copy of a copy
of a copy 
when deep space exploration ramps up 
it ll be the corporations that name everything 
the ibm stellar sphere 
the microsoft galaxy 
the planet starbucks 
i need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags 
it must have been tuesday 
he had on his cornflower blue tie 
you want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade 
prioritize these  here s your flight coupons 
call me if there s any snags 
he was full of pep 
must have had his grande latte enema 
like so many others  i had become
a slave to the ikea nesting instinct 
yes  i d like to order
the erika pekkari dust ruffles 
  please hold 
  anything clever 
like a coffee table in the shape of a yin yang 
i had to have it 
the klipsk personal office unit 
the hovetrekke home exerbike 
or the ohamshab sofa
with the strinne green stripe pattern 
even the ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally friendly unbleached paper 
i d flip through catalogues and wonder
 what kind of dining set
defines me as a person  
i had it all  even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections 
proof that they were crafted by the honest 
hard working  indigenous peoples of   
  please hold 
    wherever 
we used to read pornography 
now it was the horchow collection 
  no  you can t die of insomnia 
  what about narcolepsy 
i nod off  i wake up in strange places 
i have no idea how i got there 
  you need to lighten up 
  can you please just give me something 
red and blue tuinals  lipstick red seconals   
no  you need healthy  natural sleep 
chew some valerian root
and get more exercise 
hey  come on 
  i m in pain 
  you wanna see pain 
swing by first methodist  tuesday nights 
see the guys with testicular cancer 
that s pain 
i always wanted three kids   
two boys and a girl 
mindy wanted two girls and a boy 
we never could agree on anything 
well  i    she   
she had her first child last week 
a girl 
with    with her    with her new husband 
fuck 
thank god  you know   
i m glad for her 
she deserves   
everyone  let s thank thomas
for sharing himself with us 
thank you  thomas 
i look around this room 
and i see a lot of courage 
and that gives me strength 
we give each other strength 
it s time for the one on ones 
so let s all of us follow thomas s example
and really open ourselves up 
could you find a partner 
and this is how i met the big moosie 
his eyes already shrink wrapped in tears 
knees together  those awkward little steps 
  my name is bob 
  bob 
bob had been a champion bodybuilder 
you know that chest expansion programme
on late night tv 
that was his idea 
i was a juicer 
you know  using steroids 
diabonal and
wisterol 
oh  they use that on racehorses 
for christ sakes 
and now i m bankrupt 
i m divorced 
my two grown kids
won t even return my phone calls 
strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big  rubbery one 
go ahead     cornelius 
you can cry 
and then    something happened 
i let go 
that s really good 
lost in oblivion 
dark and silent and complete 
i found freedom 
losing all hope was freedom 
it s ok 
babies don t sleep this well 
i became addicted 
if i didn t say anything
people always assumed the worst 
they cried harder    then i cried harder 
now we re going to open the green door 
the heart chakra   
i wasn t really dying 
i wasn t host to cancer or parasites 
i was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around 
imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light 
it moves over your body  healing you 
now keep this going  remember to breathe
and step forward
through the back door of the room 
where does it lead 
to your cave 
step forward
into your cave 
that s right 
you re going deeper into your cave 
and you re going to find
your power animal 
slide 
every evening i died 
and every evening i was born again 
resurrected 
bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too 
being there  pressed against his tits 
ready to cry 
this was my vacation 
and she
ruined everything 
this is cancer  right 
this chick  marla singer 
did not have testicular cancer 
she was a liar 
she had no diseases at all 
i had seen her at free and clear 
my blood parasites group  thursdays 
then at hope 
my bimonthly sickle cell circle 
and again  at seize the day 
my tuberculosis  friday night 
marla 
the big tourist 
her lie reflected my lie 
and suddenly  i felt nothing 
i couldn t cry  so once again 
i couldn t sleep 
next group  after guided meditation 
after we open our heart chakras 
when it s time to hug 
i m gonna grab that bitch 
marla singer  and scream 
marla  you liar 
you big tourist  i need this  now  get out 
i hadn t slept in four days 
we ll just let that dry   
when you have insomnia 
you re never really asleep 
and you re never really awake 
to begin tonight s communion 
chloe would like to say a few words 
oh  yeah  chloe 
chloe looked the way meryl streep s skeleton
would look if you made it walk around
being extra nice to everybody 
well  i m still here 
but i don t know for how long 
that s as much certainty
as anyone can give me 
but i ve got some good news 
i no longer have any fear of death 
but    i am in a pretty lonely place 
no one will have sex with me 
i m so close to the end 
and all i want is to get laid for the last time 
i have pornographic movies
in my apartment 
  and lubricants and amyl nitrite 
  thank you  chloe 
everyone  let s thank chloe 
thank you  chloe 
now  let s ready ourselves
for guided meditation 
you re standing at the entrance of your cave 
you step inside your cave and you walk   
if i did have a tumor  i d name it marla 
marla 
the scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it 
but you can t 
  deeper into your cave as you walk 
you feel a healing energy all around you 
now find your power animal 
slide 
ok  let s partner up 
pick someone special to you tonight 
hey 
  we need to talk 
  sure 
  i m onto you 
  what 
yeah  you re a faker  you re not dying 
sorry 
in the tibetan philosophy  sylvia plath
sense of the word  i know we re all dying 
  but you re not dying the way chloe is 
  so 
so you re a tourist 
i ve seen you  i saw you at melanoma 
i saw you at tuberculosis 
i saw you at testicular cancer 
i saw you practising this 
  practising what 
  telling me off 
is it going as well as you hoped     rupert 
i ll expose you 
go ahead  i ll expose you 
come together  let yourselves cry 
oh  god  why are you doing this 
it s cheaper than a movie
and there s free coffee 
look  this is important 
these are my groups 
i ve been coming for over a year 
  why do you do it 
  i don t know 
when people think you re dying 
they listen to you instead of   
instead of waiting for their turn to speak 
yeah  yeah 
share yourself    completely 
look  you don t want to get into this 
  it becomes an addiction 
  really 
i m not kidding  i can t cry
if another faker is present  and i need this 
you gotta find somewhere else to go 
candystripe a cancer ward 
it s not my problem 
no  wait a second  hold on 
we ll split up the week  ok 
you take lymphoma and tuberculosis 
you take tuberculosis 
my smoking doesn t go over at all 
ok  good  fine 
testicular cancer should be no contest 
technically  i have more right to be there 
you still have your balls 
  you re kidding 
  i dunno  am i 
no  no 
  what do you want 
  i ll take the parasites 
you can t have both 
take the blood parasites 
  i want brain parasites 
  i ll take the blood but i want brain dementia 
  i want that 
  you can t have the whole brain 
so far  you have four  i only have two 
ok  take both the parasites  they re yours 
now we both have three   
hey  you left half your clothes 
  what  are you selling those 
  yes 
i m selling some clothes 
so  we each have three  that s six 
what about the seventh day 
i want bowel cancer 
the girl had done her homework 
no  no  i want bowel cancer 
that s your favorite too 
  tried to slip it by me  eh 
  look  we ll split it 
take the first and third sunday 
deal 
looks like this is goodbye 
let s not make a big thing out of it 
how s this for not making a big thing 
hey  marla 
marla 
maybe we should exchange numbers 
should we 
  we might wanna switch nights 
  ok 
this is how i met marla singer 
marla s philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment 
the tragedy  she said  was that she didn t 
it doesn t have your name 
who are you  cornelius  rupert 
travis  any of the stupid names
you give each night 
you wake up at seatac 
sfo  lax 
you wake up at o hare 
dallas fort worth 
bwi 
pacific  mountain  central 
lose an hour  gain an hour 
the check in for that flight
isn t for another two hours  sir 
this is your life 
and it s ending one minute at a time 
you wake up at air harbor international 
if you wake up at a different time 
in a different place 
could you wake up as a different person 
everywhere i travel 
tiny life 
single serving sugar and cream 
single pat of butter 
the microwave cordon bleu hobby kit 
shampoo conditioner combos 
sample package mouthwash 
tiny bars of soap 
the people i meet on each flight 
they re single serving friends 
between takeoff and landing 
we have our time together 
that s all we get 
welcome 
on a long enough time line 
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero 
i was a recall coordinator 
my job was to apply the formula 
the infant went through the windshield 
a new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph 
the rear differential locks up 
the teenager s braces
are stuck to the ashtray 
might make a good anti smoking ad 
the car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside 
now  should we initiate a recall 
the father must have been huge 
see where the fat burned to the seat 
the polyester shirt 
very modern art 
take the number of vehicles in the field  a 
multiply it by the probable rate of failure  b 
multiply the result by
the average out of court settlement  c 
a x b x c
equals x 
if x is less than the cost of a recall 
we don t do one 
are there a lot of these kinds of accidents 
you wouldn t believe 
which car company do you work for 
a major one 
every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing 
i prayed for a crash or a midair collision 
anything 
life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip 
 if you are seated in an emergency exit row
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties
listed on the safety card  please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you  
it s a lot of responsibility 
wanna switch seats 
no  i m not sure
i m the man for that particularjob 
an exit door procedure at 30 000ft 
the illusion of safety 
yeah  i guess so 
you know why
they put oxygen masks on planes 
  so you can breathe 
  oxygen gets you high 
in a catastrophic emergency 
you take giant panic breaths 
suddenly you become euphoric  docile 
you accept your fate 
it s all right here 
emergency water landing  600mph 
blank faces  calm as hindu cows 
that s   
that s an interesting theory 
  what do you do 
  what do you mean 
what do you do for a living 
why  so you can pretend you re interested 
ok 
you have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh 
we have the exact same briefcase 
soap 
  sorry 
  i make and i sell soap 
the yardstick of civilization 
and this is how i met   
tyler durden 
did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice  you can make napalm 
  no  i did not  is that true 
  that s right 
one can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items 
  really 
  if one was so inclined 
tyler  you are by far the most interesting
single serving friend i have ever met 
  everything on a plane is single serving   
  oh  i get it  very clever 
thank you 
how s it working out for you 
  what 
  being clever 
great 
keep it up  then  right up 
a question of etiquette 
as i pass  do i give you the ass or the crotch 
how i came to live with tyler is   
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage 
  was it ticking 
  throwers know modern bombs don t tick 
  sorry  throwers 
  baggage handlers 
but when a suitcase vibrates 
the throwers have got to call the police 
  my suitcase was vibrating 
  nine times out of ten
it s an electric razor 
but    every once in a while
it s a dildo 
it s company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo 
we have to use the indefinite article 
a dildo  never
your dildo 
i don t own   
i had everything in that suitcase 
my ck shirts 
my dknyshoes  my ax ties 
never mind 
hey  that s my car 
home was a condo on the 15th floor
of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals 
the walls were solid concrete 
a foot of concrete is important
when your next door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume 
or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects
blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night 
i suppose these things happen 
there s    nothing up there 
you can t go into the unit  police orders 
do you have somebody you can call 
how embarrassing 
a houseful of condiments and no food 
the police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out
letting out just a little bit of gas 
that gas could have filled the condo 
1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days 
then the refrigerator s compressor
could have clicked on 
yeah 
i can hear you breathing   
if you ask me now 
i couldn t tell you why i called him 
  hello 
  who s this 
  tyler 
  who is this 
we met    we met on the airplane 
we had the same suitcase 
the clever guy 
oh  yeah  right 
i called a second ago  there was no answer 
  i m at a payphone 
  yeah  i  69 d you  i never pick up my phone 
so what s up 
well 
you re not gonna believe this 
you know  it could be worse 
a woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car 
there s always that  i don t know 
when you buy furniture 
you tell yourself  that s it 
that s the last sofa i ll need 
whatever happens 
that sofa problem is handled 
i had it all 
i had a stereo that was very decent 
a wardrobe that was getting very respectable 
i was close to being complete 
  shit  man  now it s all gone 
  all gone 
all gone 
do you know what a duvet is 
  a comforter 
  it s a blanket 
just a blanket  why do guys
like you and i know what a duvet is 
is this essential to our survival
in the hunter gatherer sense 
no 
what are we  then 
i dunno  consumers 
right  we re consumers 
we are by products of a lifestyle obsession 
murder  crime  poverty 
these things don t concern me 
what concerns me are celebrity magazines 
television with 500 channels 
some guy s name on my underwear  rogaine 
viagra  olestra 
  martha stewart 
  fuck martha stewart 
she s polishing the brass on the titanic 
it s all going down 
so fuck off with your sofa units
and strinne green stripe patterns 
i say never be complete 
i say stop being perfect 
i say let s evolve 
let the chips fall where they may 
but that s me  and i could be wrong 
maybe it s a terrible tragedy 
it s just stuff  not a tragedy   
you did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living 
fuck  you re right  i don t smoke 
my insurance is probably gonna cover it  so   
what 
the things you own end up owning you 
do what you like  man 
oh  it s late 
  hey  thanks for the beer 
  yeah  man 
i should find a hotel 
what 
what 
  a hotel 
  yeah 
  just ask  man 
  what are you talking about 
oh  god  three pitchers of beer
and you still can t ask 
what 
you called me
because you needed a place to stay 
  oh  hey  no  no  no 
  yes  you did  so just ask 
cut the foreplay and just ask  man 
would    would that be a problem 
is it a problem for you to ask 
  can i stay at your place 
  yeah 
thanks 
  i want you to do me a favor 
  yeah  sure 
i want you to hit me as hard as you can 
what 
i want you to hit me as hard as you can 
let me tell you a little bit about tyler durden 
tyler was a night person 
while the rest of us slept  he worked 
he had one part time job as a projectionist 
a movie doesn t come all on one big reel 
it comes on a few 
someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment
that one reel ends and the next one begins 
you can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen 
in the industry  we call them cigarette burns 
that s the cue for a changeover 
he flips the projectors  movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea 
why would anyone want this shitjob 
because it affords him
interesting opportunities 
like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films 
so when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet 
that s when you ll catch a flash
of tyler s contribution to the film 
nobody knows that they saw it but they did 
nice  big cock 
even a hummingbird
couldn t catch tyler at work 
tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious pressman hotel 
he was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry 
do not watch  i cannot go when you watch 
apart from seasoning the lobster bisque 
he farted on meringues 
and as for the cream of mushroom soup   
go ahead  tell  em 
you get the idea 
  you just want me to hit you 
  come on  do me this one favor 
  why 
  i don t know  never been in a fight  you 
  no  but that s a good thing 
  you can t know yourself if you haven t 
i don t wanna die without any scars 
  come on  hit me  before i lose my nerve 
  oh  god  this is crazy 
so go crazy  let it rip 
  i don t know about this 
  i don t either 
who gives a shit  no one s watching 
what do you care 
this is crazy  you want me to hit you  
that s right 
  where  like  in the face 
  surprise me 
this is so fucking stupid 
motherfucker 
he hit me in the ear 
  well  jesus  i m sorry 
  ow  christ 
  why the ear  man 
  i fucked it up 
no  that was perfect 
no  it s all right 
it really hurts 
right 
hit me again 
no  you hit me  come on 
we should do this again sometime 
  where s your car 
  what car 
i don t know how tyler found that house
but he said he d been there for a year 
it looked like it was waiting to be torn down 
most of the windows were boarded up 
there was no lock on the front door from
when the police  or whoever  kicked it in 
the stairs were ready to collapse 
i didn t know if he owned it or was squatting 
neither would have surprised me 
yep  that s you 
that s me  that s the toilet  good 
yeah  thanks 
what a shithole 
nothing worked 
turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out 
there were no neighbors 
just warehouses and a paper mill 
that fart smell of steam 
the hamster cage smell of wood chips 
what have we here 
  hey  guys 
  hey 
every time it rained  we had to kill the power 
by the end of the first month 
i didn t miss tv 
i didn t even mind the warm  stale refrigerator 
can i be next 
all right  man 
lose the tie 
at night  tyler and i were alone
for half a mile in every direction 
rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures 
everything wooden swelled and shrank 
everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on 
the previous occupant had been a shut in 
hey  man  what are you reading 
listen to this  it s an article written
by an organ in the first person 
 i am jack s medulla oblongata 
without me 
jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing  
there s a whole series of these 
 i am jill s nipples  
   i am jack s colon  
   i get cancer  i kill jack  
after fighting  everything else
in life got the volume turned down 
what 
  you could deal with anything 
  have you finished those reports 
if you could choose 
who would you fight 
i d fight my boss  probably 
really 
  yeah  why  who would you fight 
  i d fight my dad 
i don t know my dad 
i mean  i know him  but   
he left when i was like  six years old 
married this other woman
and had some other kids 
he did this every six years 
  he changes city and starts a new family 
  fucker s setting up franchises 
my dad never went to college 
  so it was real important that i go 
  that sounds familiar 
so i graduate  call him up long distance
and say   dad  now what  
  he says   get ajob  
  same here 
now i m 25  make my yearly call again 
 dad  now what  
he says   i dunno  get married  
you can t get married 
i m a 30 year old boy 
we re a generation of men raised by women 
i m wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need 
most of the week  we were ozzie and harriet 
but every saturday night 
we were finding something out 
we were finding out more and more
that we were not alone 
it used to be that when i came home angry
or depressed  i d just clean my condo 
polish my scandinavian furniture 
i should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company 
i should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit 
but i wasn t 
the premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient 
monday mornings 
i just thought about next week 
can i get the icon in cornflower blue 
absolutely 
efficiency is priority no 1  people 
because waste is a thief 
i showed this to my man here 
you liked it  didn t you 
you can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick 
it was right in everyone s face 
tyler and i just made it visible 
it was on the tip of everyone s tongue 
tyler and i just gave it a name 
come on  you ve gotta go home 
turn off the jukebox  lock the back 
every week 
tyler gave the rules that he and i decided 
gentlemen 
welcome to fight club 
the first rule of fight club is
you do not talk about fight club 
the second rule of fight club is
you do not talk about fight club 
third rule of fight club 
someone yells stop  goes limp  taps out 
the fight is over  fourth rule 
only two guys to a fight 
fifth rule 
one fight at a time  fellas 
sixth rule  no shirts  no shoes 
seventh rule 
fights will go on as long as they have to 
and the eighth and final rule 
if this is your first night at fight club
you have to fight 
this kid from work  ricky 
couldn t remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black 
but ricky was a god for ten minutes
when he trounced
the maitre d  of a local food court 
sometimes  all you could hear were the flat 
hard  packing sounds over the yelling 
or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed   
stop 
you weren t alive anywhere
like you were there 
but fight club only exists in the hours
between when fight club starts and ends 
even if i could tell someone
they had a good fight 
i wouldn t be talking to the same man 
who you were in fight club
is not who you were outside of it 
a guy came to fight club for the first time 
his ass was a wad of cookie dough 
after a few weeks  he was carved out of wood 
if you could fight any celebrity 
who would you fight 
  alive or dead 
  doesn t matter  who d be tough 
hemingway  you 
shatner  i d fight william shatner 
we all started seeing things differently 
everywhere we went 
we were sizing things up 
i felt sorry for guys packed into gyms 
trying to look like how calvin klein
or tommy hilfiger said they should 
is that what a man looks like 
oh  self improvement is masturbation 
now  self destruction   
excuse me 
fight club wasn t about winning or losing 
it wasn t about words 
the hysterical shouting was in tongues
like at a pentecostal church 
  is that it 
  stop 
when the fight was over  nothing was solved 
but nothing mattered 
cool 
afterwards  we all felt saved 
hey  man  how about next week 
how about next month  
irvine  you re in the middle 
new guy  you too 
sometimes  tyler spoke for me 
he fell down some stairs 
i fell down some stairs 
fight club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails 
ok  any historical figure 
i d fight gandhi 
good answer 
  how about you 
  lincoln 
lincoln 
big guy  big reach 
skinny guys fight till they re burger 
fuck 
hey  even the mona lisa s falling apart 
hello 
where have you been the last eight weeks 
marla 
  how did you find me 
  you left a forwarding number

she invaded my support groups
and now my home

  yeah  i promise 
  promise 
  i just said  i promise  what   
  that s three times you promised 
if only i had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch marla singer die 
none of this would have happened

i could have moved to another room 
on the third floor
where i might not have heard them 
but i didn t 
  what are you doing 
  just going to bed 
wanna finish her off 
  no  no  thank you 
  i ve found a cigarette 
  who were you talking to 
  shut up 
i became the calm little center of the world 
i was the zen master 
i wrote little haiku poems 
i e mailed them to everyone 
is that your blood 
some of it  yeah 
you can t smoke in here 
take the rest of the day off 
come back monday with some clean clothes 
get yourself together 
i got right in everyone s hostile face 
 yes  these are bruises from fighting  
 yes  i m comfortable with that  
 i am enlightened  
you give up the condo life  give up
all your flaming worldly possessions 
move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area 
and you have to come home to this 
  hello 
  this is detective stern with the arson unit 
we have some new information about
the incident at your former condo 
yes 
i don t know if you re aware  but someone
sprayed freon into your front door lock 
they used a chisel to shatter the cylinder 
no  i wasn t aware of that 
i am jack s cold sweat 
does this sound strange to you 
yes  sir  strange  very strange 
  the dynamite
  dynamite 
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride 
  do you know what this means 
  no  what does it mean 
it means it was home made 
i m sorry  this is just coming
as quite a shock to me  sir 
whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion 
  the gas was just a detonator 
  who would go and do that 
  i ll ask the questions 
  tell him 
tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions 
excuse me  are you there 
i am listening 
it s hard to know what to make of this 
have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home made dynamite 
  enemies 
  reject civilization 
especially material possessions 
  son  this is serious 
  yes  i know it s serious 
  i mean that 
  yes  it s very serious 
look  nobody takes this
more seriously than me 
that condo was my life  ok 
i loved every stick of furniture in that place 
that was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed 
  it was me 
  i d like to thank the academy 
  is this not a good time for you 
  just tell him you fucking did it 
tell him you blew it all up 
that s what he wants to hear 
  are you still there 
  wait  are you saying that i m a suspect 
no  i may need to talk to you  so you
let me know if you re gonna leave town 
  ok 
  ok 
except for their humping 
tyler and marla were never in the same room 
my parents pulled this exact same act
for years 
the condom is the glass slipper
of our generation 
you slip one on when you meet a stranger 
you    dance all night 
then you throw it away 
the condom  i mean  not the stranger 
what 
i got this dress at a thrift store for  1 
it was worth every penny 
it s a bridesmaid s dress 
someone loved it intensely
for one day 
then tossed it 
like a christmas tree 
so special 
then
bam 
it s on the side of the road 
tinsel still clinging to it 
like a sex crime victim 
underwear inside out 
  bound with electrical tape 
  well then  it suits you 
you can borrow it sometime 
get rid of her 
  what  you get rid of her 
  don t mention me 
i am six years old again 
passing messages between parents 
  i really think it s time you left 
  don t worry  i m leaving 
  not that we don t love your visits 
  you are such a nutcase  i can t keep up 
gotta get off
thanks  bye 
gotta get off of this merry go round
gonna get  need to get   
gotta get   
you kids 
why do you still waste time with her 
i ll say this about marla 
at least she s trying to hit bottom 
and i m not 
feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken 
what are we doing tonight 
tonight    we make soap 
really 
to make soap  first we render fat 
the salt balance has to be just right
so the best fat for soap comes from humans 
  wait  what is this place 
  a liposuction clinic 
pay dirt 
richest  creamiest fat in the world 
fat of the land 
no  don t pull it  don t pull it 
  oh  god 
  give me another one 
as the fat renders 
the tallows float to the surface 
like in boy scouts 
  it s hard to imagine you as a boy scout 
  keep stirring 
once the tallow hardens 
you skim off a layer of glycerin 
add nitric acid  you ve got nitroglycerin 
then add sodium nitrate and sawdust 
you ve got dynamite 
yeah  with enough soap 
one could blow up just about anything 
tyler was full of useful information 
people found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river 
  you know why 
  no 
human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river 
bodies burnt 
water permeated the ashes to create lye 
this is lye  the crucial ingredient 
once it mixed with the melted body fat 
a white soapy discharge crept into the river 
may i see your hand  please 
what is this 
this is a chemical burn 
it will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar 
meditation worked for cancer 
it could work now 
  don t shut the pain out 
  oh  god 
the first soap was made from heroes  ashes 
like the first monkey shot into space 
without pain or sacrifice 
we would have nothing 
i tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh 
stop it 
this is your pain  this is your burning hand 
i m going to my cave
to find my power animal 
no  don t deal with this
the way those dead people do  come on 
  i get the point 
  no  you re feeling premature enlightenment 
it s the greatest moment of your life 
and you re off somewhere else 
i am not 
shut up 
our fathers were our models for god 
if our fathers bailed 
what does that tell you about god 
listen to me  you have to consider
the possibility that god does not like you 
he never wanted you 
in all probability  he hates you 
this is not the worst thing that can happen 
we don t need him 
  i agree 
  fuck damnation  fuck redemption 
we are god s unwanted children  so be it 
  i m getting water 
  you can use water and make it worse or   
  or use vinegar to neutralize the burn 
  please let me up 
first  you have to give up 
first  you have to know  not fear 
know that some day  you re gonna die 
you don t know how this feels 
it s only after we ve lost everything
that we re free to do anything 
ok 
congratulations 
you re one step closer to hitting the bottom 
tyler sold his soap
to department stores at  20 a bar 
god knows what they charged 
  this is the best soap 
  why  thank you  susan 
it was beautiful 
we were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them 
he was wearing his yellow tie 
i didn t wear a tie to work any more 
 the first rule of fight club
is don t talk about fight club  
i m half asleep again 
i must have left it in the copy machine 
 the second rule     is this yours 
pretend you re me 
make a managerial decision 
you find this  what would you do 
well  i gotta tell you 
i d be very  very careful
who you talk to about that 
because the person who wrote that
is dangerous 
and this button down  oxford cloth psycho
might just snap
and then stalk from office to office
with an armalite ar10 carbine gas powered
semiautomatic weapon 
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co workers 
this might be someone
you ve known for years 
someone very  very close to you 
tyler s words coming out of my mouth 
and i used to be such a nice guy 
or maybe you shouldn t bring me
every piece of trash you pick up 
  compliance and liability 
  my tit s gonna rot off 
will you excuse me  i need to take this 
  what do you mean 
  i need you to check for a lump in my breast 
  go to a hospital 
  i can t afford to waste money on a doctor 
i don t know about this  marla 
please 
she didn t call tyler  i m neutral in her book 
that s nice 
taking food to mrs haniver and mrs raines 
where are they  exactly

goddamn it 
an entire generation pumping gas 
waiting tables 
slaves with white collars 
advertising has us chasing cars and clothes 
working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don t need 
we re the middle children of history 
no purpose or place 
we have no great war 
no great depression 
our great war is a spiritual war 
our great depression is our lives 
we ve all been raised
on television to believe
that one day we d be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars 
but we won t 
we re slowly learning that fact 
and we re very  very pissed off

is you do not ask questions  sir 
the victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight 
it will take dedication and commitment
and  most of all  cooperation 
streets are safer now 
there is hope in the inner city  however   
i gotta take a piss 
these are the first steps in a long journey 
that is why we have created project hope 
bob 
project hope will be ajoint effort
between the police and community leaders 
it will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime 
  wrap it around the top of his hacky sack 
  his balls are ice cold 
hi  you re gonna call off
your rigorous investigation 
you will publicly state
there is no underground group or
these guys are gonna take your balls 
they ll send one to the new york times
and one to the la times 
look 
the people you are after
are the people you depend on 
we cook your meals  we haul your trash 
we connect your calls 
we drive your ambulances 
we guard you while you sleep 
do not fuck with us 
ball check 
bob  you re this way 
let s go 
i am jack s inflamed sense of rejection 
hey 
yeah 
i felt like putting a bullet in every panda
that wouldn t screw to save its species

of some abandoned superhighway

i ve ever heard 
  is it true about fight club in miami 
  is mr durden building an army 
i was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu 
everywhere i went 
i felt i d already been there 
it was like following an invisible man 
the smell of dried blood 
dirty  bare footprints circling each other 
that aroma of old sweat  like fried chicken 
the feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before 
i was always just one step behind tyler 
his name is robert paulsen   
welcome back  sir 
how have you been 
do you know me 
is this a test  sir

hello  i need you to arrest me 
i am the leader of a terrorist organization
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city 
in the metropolitan area 
we had probably 200 members 
chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already 
this is a tightly regimented organization
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership 
go to the house  ok  1537 paper street 
that s our headquarters 
in the back  buried in the garden 
you ll find the body of robert paulsen 
in the basement 
you re gonna find some bathtubs
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin 
i believe the plan is to blow up
the headquarters
of these credit card companies
and the trw building 
why these buildings 
why credit card companies 
if you erase the debt record 
then we all go back to zero 
you ll create total chaos
