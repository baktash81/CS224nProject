yo ho yo ho a pirate s life for me 
we extort  we pilfer  we filch and sack 
drink up
quiet  missy 
cursed pirates sail these waters 
you don t want to bring them
down on us now  do ya 
  mr  gibbs that will do 
  she was singing about pirates 
bad luck to be singing about pirates with us
mired in this unnatural fog  mark my words 
consider them marked 
on your way 
aye  lieutenant 
it s bad luck to have a woman on board  too 
even a miniature one 
i think it d be rather exciting
to meet a pirate 
think again  miss swann 
vile and dissolute creatures 
the lot of them 
i intend to see to that any man who sails
under a pirate flag or   
   wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves 
a short drop and a sudden stop 
lieutenant norrington 
i appreciate your fervor 
but i m   i m concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter 
my apologies  governor swann 
  actually  i find it all fascinating 
  yes  that s what concerns me 
look  a boy 
there s a boy in the water 
man overboard 
haul him aboard 
he s still breathing 
mary  mother of god 
what happened here 
it s most likely the powder magazine 
merchant vessels run heavily armed 
a lot of good it did them 
everyone s thinking it 
i m just saying it   pirates 
there s no proof of that 
it was probably an accident 
  rouse the captain immediately 
  aye  sir 
heave to and take in sail 
launch the boats 
elizabeth i want you to accompany the boy 
he ll be in your charge 
take care of him 
it s ok 
my name s elizabeth swann 
will turner 
i m watching over you  will 
  you re a pirate 
  has he said anything 
his name is william turner 
that s all i found out 
take him below 
elizabeth 
are you alright 
  are you decent 
  yes  yes 
still abed at this hour 
it s a beautiful day 
i have a gift for you 
  oh  it s beautiful 
  isn t it 
may i inquire as to the occasion 
does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter 
go on 
actually  i  uh   
i had hoped you might wear
it for the ceremony today 
the ceremony 
captain norringtons
promotion ceremony 
i knew it 
commodore norrington
he s about to become 
fine gentleman  don t you think 
he fancies you 
elizabeth 
how s it coming 
it s difficult to say 
i m told it s the latest
fashion in london 
well  women in london must ve
learned not to breathe 
m lord  you have a visitor 
ah  mr  turner 
good to see you again 
good day  sir 
i have your order 
the blade is folded steel  that s gold
filigree laid into the handle 
if i may 
perfectly balanced  the tang is
nearly the full width of the blade 
impressive  very impressive 
ah  now  commodore norrington is
going to be very pleased with this 
do pass my compliments
on to your master 
i shall 
a craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated 
  ah  elizabeth  you look absolutely stunning 
  will 
so good to see you 
  i had a dream about you last night 
  about me 
elizabeth  is that entirely
proper for you to    
about the day we met 
do you remember 
how could i forget  miss swann 
will  how many times must
i ask you to call me elizabeth 
at least once more 
miss swann  as always 
there  see  at least the boy has
a sense of propriety 
now  we really must be going 
farewell 
good day  mr  turner 
come along 
good day   
   elizabeth 
what 
hold up there  you 
it s a shilling to tie up your
boat at the dock 
and i shall need to
know your name 
what d ye say to three shillings
and we forget the name 
welcome to port royal  mr  smith 
two paces front 
right about turn 
present   
   arms 
this dock is off limits to civilians 
i m terribly sorry  i didn t know 
if i see one   
   i shall inform you immediately 
apparently there s some sort of a high toned
and fancy to do up at the fort  eh 
how could it be that two upstanding gentlemen
such as yourselves did not merit an invitation 
someone has to make sure this
dock stays off limits to civilians 
it s a fine goal to be sure but
it seems to me that a   
a ship like that makes this one
here a bit superfluous  really 
ah  the dauntless is the power
in these waters  true enough 
but there s no ship that can match
the interceptor for speed 
i ve heard of one  supposed to be
very fast  nigh un catchable   
 the black pearl 
well   there s no real ship that
can match the interceptor 
  the black pearl is a real ship 
  no  no it s not 
  yes  it is  i ve seen it 
  you ve seen it 
  yes 
  you haven t seen it 
yes  i have 
you ve seen a ship with black sails   
   that s crewed by the damned and
captained by a man so evil   
   that hell itself spat him back out 
  no 
  no 
but i have seen a ship
with black sails 
oh  and no ship that s not crewed by
the damned and captained by a man so evil   
   that hell itself spat him
back out could possibly   
   have black sails therefore couldn t
possibly be any other   
   ship than the black pearl 
is that what you re saying 
no 
like i said  there s no real ship
that can match the interceptor
hey 
you 
get away from there  you don t
have permission to be aboard there  mate 
i m sorry  it s just it s such
a pretty boat   ship 
  what s your name 
  smith or   smithy  if you like 
what s your purpose in
port royal  mr  smith 
yeah  and no lies 
well  then  i confess  it is my intention
to commandeer one of these ships 
pick up a crew in tortuga  raid  pillage  plunder
and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out 
i said no lies 
i think he s telling the truth 
if he were telling the truth 
he wouldn t have told us 
unless  of course  he knew you wouldn t
believe the truth even if he told it to you 
may i have a moment 
  you look lovely  elizabeth 
  yes 
i apologize if i seem forward but i   
must speak my mind 
this promotion throws into sharp
relief that which i have   
   not yet achieved 
a marriage to a fine woman 
you have become a fine
woman  elizabeth 
i can t breathe 
yes  i m a bit nervous myself 
   and then they made me their chief 
elizabeth 
elizabeth 
the rocks 
sir  it s a miracle she missed them 
  will you be saving her then 
  i can t swim 
pearl of the kings navy you are 
do not lose these 
what was that 
i got her 
  not breathing 
  move 
never would have thought of that 
clearly you ve never been to singapore 
where did you get that 
on your feet 
elizabeth 
  are you alright 
  yes  i m fine 
  shoot him 
  father 
commodore  do you really
intend to kill my rescuer 
i believe thanks are in order 
had a brush with the east india
trading company  did we 
pirate 
hang him 
keep your guns on him  men 
gillette  fetch some irons 
  well  well    jack sparrow  isn t it 
  captain jack sparrow  if you please  sir 
  well  i don t see your ship   captain 
  i m in the market as it were 
  he said he d come to commandeer one 
  told ya he was telling the truth 
these are his  sir 
no additional shots nor powder 
a compass that doesn t point north 
and i half expected it
to be made of wood 
you are  without doubt  the worst
pirate i ve ever heard of 
but you have heard of me 
commodore  i really must protest 
carefully lieutenant 
pirate or not this man saved my life 
one good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness 
though it seems enough
to condemn him 
indeed 
finally 
no  don t shoot 
i knew you d warm up to me 
commodore norrington  my effects  please   
   and my hat 
commodore 
  elizabeth  it is elizabeth isn t it 
  it s miss swann 
miss swann  if you d be so kind 
come  come  dear  we don t have all day 
now if you d be very kind 
easy on the goods  darling 
you re despicable 
sticks and stones  love  i saved your
life  you saved mine  we re square 
gentlemen  m lady 
you will always remember this as
the day that you almost caught   
   captain jack sparrow 
  now  will you shoot him 
  open fire 
on his heels 
gillette  mr  sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows   
   i would hate for him to miss it 
search upstairs 
look lively  men 
right where i left you 
not where i left you 
you re the one they re hunting 
the pirate 
you seem somewhat familiar 
have i threatened you before 
i make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates 
ah  well  then it would be a shame to
put a black mark on your record 
so  if you ll excuse me   
do you think this wise  boy   
   crossing blades with a pirate 
you threatened miss swann 
only a little 
you know what you re doing 
i ll give you that  excellent form   
   but how s your footwork 
if i step here   
very good 
now i step again 
ta 
that is a wonderful trick 
except once again you are
between me and my way out 
and now you have no weapon 
who makes all these 
i do 
and i practice with them   
   three hours a day 
you need to find yourself a girl  mate 
or  perhaps the reason you practice three
hours a day is that you already found one   
   and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet 
you re not a eunuch  are you 
i practice three hours a day 
so that when i meet a pirate   
   i can kill it 
you cheated 
pirate 
  move away 
  no 
  please  move 
  no 
i cannot just step aside
and let you escape 
this shot is not meant for you 
excellent work  mr  brown  you ve assisted
in the capture of a dangerous fugitive 
just doing my civic duty  sir 
well  i trust you ll always remember
this as the day that captain   
   jack sparrow almost escaped 
take him away 
  can you smell it 
  come here  boy 
  want a nice juicy bone 
  come here  boy 
you can keep doing that forever 
the dog is never going to move 
oh  excuse us if we haven t resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet 
there you go  miss 
it s a difficult day for you  i am sure 
i suspected commodore norrington would propose but   
   i must admit i wasn t entirely prepared for it 
well  i meant you being threatened
by that pirate  sounds terrifying 
oh  yes  it was terrifying 
but the commodore proposed 
fancy that 
now that s a smart match  miss 
if it s not too bold to say 
it is a smart match 
he s a fine man 
the sort any woman should dream of marrying 
well  that will turner 
he s a fine man too 
that is too bold 
well  begging your pardon  miss 
it was not my place 
  has my daughter given you an answer yet 
  no  she hasn t 
well  she has had a very trying day 
ghastly weather  don t you think 
bleak  very bleak 
what s that 
cannon fire 
return fire 
i know those guns 
  it s the pearl 
  black pearl 
i ve heard stories  she s been preying on
ships and settlements for near ten years 
  never leaves any survivors 
  no survivors 
then where do the stories
come from  i wonder 
governor 
barricade yourself in my office 
that s an order 
don t 
hello  chump 
  up there 
  girl 
miss swann  they ve come to kidnap you 
  what 
  you re the governors daughter 
they haven t seen you  hide and the
first chance you get  run to the fort 
gotcha 
  it s hot  it s on me 
  come on 
we know you re here  poppet 
poppet 
come out 
we promise we wont hurt you 
we will find you  poppet 
you ve got something of
ours and it calls to us 
the gold calls to us 
gold calls   
 ello  poppet 
  parley 
  what 
parley  i invoke the right of parley 
according to the code of the brethren  set down
by the pirates morgan and bartholomew   
   you have to take me to your captain 
i know the code 
if an adversary demands parley you
can do them no harm until   
   the parley is complete 
to blazes with the code 
she wants to be taken to the captain 
and she ll go without a fuss 
we must honor the code 
say goodbye 
goodbye 
  come on 
  elizabeth 
outta my way  scum 
my sympathies friend  you ve
no manner of luck at all 
come on  doggy 
it s just you and me now 
it s you and ol  jack  come on 
come on  good boy 
that s it  good boy  come on 
bit closer  bit closer 
that s it  that s it  doggy 
come on you filthy  slimy  mangy cad 
no  no  no  no  no 
i didn t mean it  i didn t   
this ain t the armory 
well  well  well 
look what we have here twigg 
captain jack sparrow 
last time i saw you  you were all
alone on a godforsaken island 
shrinking into the distance 
his fortunes aren t improved much 
worry about your own
fortunes  gentlemen 
the deepest circle of hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers 
so there is a curse 
that s interesting 
you know nothing of hell 
that s very interesting 
i didn t know we were
takin  on captives 
she s invoked the right of parley
with captain barbossa 
  i am here to negotiate   
  you will speak when spoken to 
and ye ll not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley 
aye  sir 
my apologies  miss 
captain barbossa  i am here to negotiate
the cessation of hostilities   
   against port royal 
there are a lot of long words in there  miss 
we re naught but humble pirates 
  what is it that you want 
  i want you to leave and never come back 
i m disinclined to acquiesce to your request   
   means no 
very well 
i ll drop it 
me holds are burstin  with swag and
that bit of shine matters to us 
  why 
  it s what you ve been searching for 
i recognized the ship  i saw it eight years
ago on the crossing from england 
did ya now 
fine 
well  i suppose if it is worthless then
there s no point in me keeping it 
you have a name  missy 
elizabeth    turner 
i m a maid in the
governors household 
miss turner    
bootstrap 
and how does a maid come to
own a trinket such as that 
family heirloom  perhaps 
i didn t steal it if that s what you mean 
very well  you hand it over and we ll put your
town to our rudder and never return 
our bargain 
still the guns and stow  em  signal the men  set the flags   
wait  you have to take me to shore 
according to the code of the order of the brethren   
first  your return to shore was
not part of our negotiations   
   nor our agreement so
i must do nothing 
and secondly  you must be a pirate for
the pirates code to apply and you re not
and thirdly  the code is more what you d
call  guidelines  than actual rules 
welcome aboard the black pearl 
miss turner 
they ve taken her 
they ve taken elizabeth 
mr  murtogg  remove this man 
we have to hunt them down 
we must save her 
and where do you propose we start 
if you have any information concerning
my daughter  please  share it 
that jack sparrow 
he talked about the black pearl 
mentioned it  is more what he did 
ask him where it is 
make a deal with him
he could lead us to it 
no   
the pirates who invaded this fort left
sparrow locked in his cell ergo    
   they are not his allies 
governor  we will establish
their most likely course   
that s not good enough 
mr  turner  you are not a military
man  you are not a sailor 
you are a blacksmith and this is
not the moment for rash actions 
do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here   
   who cares for elizabeth 
  you  sparrow 
  aye 
you are familiar with that ship 
the black pearl 
  i ve heard of it 
  where does it make berth 
where does it make berth 
have you not heard the stories 
captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants
sailed from the dreaded isla de muerta 
it s an island that cannot be found except
by those who already know where it is 
the ships real enough 
therefore it s anchorage must be
a real place  where is it 
  why ask me 
  because you re a pirate 
and you want to turn pirate
yourself  is that it 
never 
  they took miss swann 
  oh  so it is that you ve found a girl 
i see 
well  if you re intending to brave all  hasten
to her rescue and so win fair lady s heart   
   you ll have to do it alone  mate 
i see no profit in it for me 
  i can get you out of here 
  how s that  the keys run off 
i helped build these cells 
these are half pin barrel hinges 
with the right leverage and
a proper application of strength   
   the door will lift free 
  what s your name 
  will turner 
that will be short for william 
i imagine 
good  strong name  no doubt 
named for your father  aye 
yes 
well  mr  turner 
i ve changed me mind 
if you spring me from this cell 
i swear on pain of death   
   i shall take you to the black
pearl and your bonny lass 
do we have an accord 
  agreed 
  agreed  get me out 
hurry  someone will
have heard that 
not without my effects 
we re going to steal a ship 
that ship 
commandeer 
we re going to commandeer that ship 
nautical term 
one question about your business boy 
or there s no use going 
this girl  how far are you
willing to go to save her 
  i d die for her 
  oh  good 
no worries  then 
this is either madness or brilliance 
it s remarkable how often
those two traits coincide 
everyone stay calm 
we are taking over the ship 
aye  avast 
this ship cannot be crewed by two men 
you ll never make it out of the bay 
son 
i m captain jack sparrow  savvy 
commodore 
sir  they ve taken the dauntless 
they ve taken the ship 
sparrow and turner 
they ve taken the dauntless 
rash  turner  too rash 
he is without doubt the worst
pirate i have ever seen 
here they come 
bring her around 
bring her around 
search every cabin  every hold 
down to the bilges 
  sailors  back to the interceptor  now 
  quickly men 
thank you  commodore  for
getting us ready to make way 
we d have a hard time
of it by ourselves 
set top sails and clear up this mess 
with the wind a quarter astern 
we wont catch them 
we don t need to catch them just
get them in range of the long nines 
men  come about 
run out the guns 
we open fire on our own ship  sir 
i d rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate 
commodore  he s disabled
the rudder chain  sir 
abandon ship 
that s got to be the best
pirate i ve ever seen 
so it would seem 
when i was a lad living in england 
my mother raised me by herself 
after she died  i came out here 
looking for my father 
is that so 
my father  will turner 
and in jail it was only after you learned
my name that you agreed to help 
since that s what i wanted 
i didn t press the matter 
i m not a simpleton  jack 
you knew my father 
i knew  im 
probably one the few who knew
him as william turner 
everyone else just called him
bootstrap or bootstrap bill 
  bootstrap 
  good man  good pirate 
  i swear you look just like him 
  it s not true 
he was a merchant sailor  a good 
respectable man who obeyed the law 
he was a bloody pirate  a scallywag 
my father was not a pirate 
put it away  son 
it s not worth you getting beat again 
you didn t beat me 
you ignored the rules of engagement 
in a fair fight  i d killed you 
and that s no incentive for
me to fight fair  is it 
now as long as you re just
hanging there  pay attention 
the only rules that really
matter are these 
what a man can do and
what a man can t do 
for instance you can accept that your
father was a pirate and a good man   
   or you can t 
but pirate is in your blood  boy  so you ll
have to square with that someday 
and me  for example 
i can let you drown 
but i can t bring this ship into tortuga
all by me onesies  savvy 
so   
can you sail under the
command of a pirate   
   or can you not 
tortuga 
tortuga 
more importantly  it is indeed a sad life
that has never breathed deep
the sweet proliferous bouquet that is tortuga  savvy 
what do you think 
it ll linger 
i ll tell you mate 
if every town in the world were like this one   
   no man would ever feel unwanted 
scarlett 
not sure i deserved that 
giselle 
who was she 
what 
i may have deserved that 
curse you for breathing 
you slack jawed idiot 
mother s love 
jack 
you should know better then to wake
a man when he s sleeping 
  it s bad luck
  ah  fortunately i know how to counter it 
the man who did the waking buys 
the man who was sleeping  a drink 
the man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to a proposition   
    from the man who did the waking 
aye  that ll about do it 
blast  i m already awake 
that was for the smell 
keep a sharp eye 
now  what s the nature of
this venture you are in 
i m going after the black pearl 
i know where it s going to be
and i m going to take it 
jack  it s a fool s errand 
well  you know better than me
the tales of the black pearl 
that s why i know what
barbossa is up to   
   all i need is a crew 
from what i hear tell of captain barbossa 
he s not a man to suffer fools
nor strike a bargain with one 
well  then i say it s a very good
thing i m not a fool then  aye 
prove me wrong  what makes ye think
barbossa will give up his ship to you 
let s just say it s a matter of leverage  aye 
the kid 
that is the child of bootstrap bill turner 
his only child  savvy 
is he now 
leverage says you   
   i think i feel a change in the wind says i 
i ll find us a crew   
   there s bound to be some sailors
on this rock crazy as you 
one can only hope 
take what you can   
give nothing back 
you ll be dinin  with the captain 
and he requests you wear this 
well  you may tell the captain that i am
disinclined to acquiesce to his request 
he said you d say that 
he also said if that be the case   
   you ll be dinin  with the crew   
   and you ll be naked 
fine 
there s no need to stand on ceremony 
nor call to impress anyone 
you must be hungry 
try the wine 
and the apples 
one of those next 
it s poisoned 
there would be no sense to
be killing ye miss turner 
then release me  you have your trinket 
i m of no further value to you 
  you don t know what this is  do ye 
  it s a pirate medallion 
this is aztec gold 
one of 882 identical pieces they delivered
in a stone chest to cortés himself 
blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies 
but the greed of cortés was insatiable 
so the heathen gods placed upon
the gold a terrible curse 
any mortal that removes but
a piece from that stone chest   
   shall be punished for eternity 
i hardly believe in ghost stories
anymore  captain barbossa 
aye 
that s exactly what i thought when
we were first told the tale 
buried on an island that
cannot be found except   
   for those who know where it is 
find it  we did 
there be the chest   
   inside be the gold 
we took them all 
spent them and traded them 
we frittered them away   on drink
and food and pleasurable company 
the more we gave them away 
the more we came to realize   
   the drink would not satisfy 
food turned to ash in our mouths   
   and all the pleasurable company in
the world could not slake our lust 
we are cursed men  miss turner 
compelled by greed we were 
and now we are consumed by it 
there is one way we
can end our curse 
all the scattered pieces of the
aztec gold must be restored   
   and the blood repaid 
thanks to you we have the final piece 
and the blood to be repaid 
that s why there s no sense
to be killing you   
yet 
apple 
i m curious  after killing me what is
it you are planning on doing next 
look 
the moonlight shows us
for what we really are 
we are not among the living
and so we cannot die 
but neither are we dead 
for too long i ve been parched with
thirst and unable to quench it 
too long i ve been starving
to death and haven t died 
i feel nothing  not the wind on my
face nor the spray of the sea 
nor the warmth of a woman s flesh 
you best start believing in
ghost stories miss turner   
you re in one 
what are ye looking at 
back to work 
feast your eyes  captain 
all of them  faithful hands before the mast 
every man worth his salt 
and crazy to boot 
so this is your able bodied crew 
  you  sailor    cotton  sir 
  mr  cotton 
do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders
and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death 
  mr  cotton  answer man 
he s a mute  sir  poor devil had his tongue cut
out  so he trained the parrot to talk for him 
no one s yet figured how 
mr  cotton s    parrot 
same question 
wind in the sails 
wind in the sails 
  mostly  we figure  that means  yes  
  o course it does  satisfied 
well  you ve proved they re mad 
and what s the benefit for us 
anamaria 
  i suppose you didn t deserve that one either 
  no  that one i deserved 
  you stole my boat 
  actually   
borrowed  borrowed without permission 
  but with every intention of bringing it back to you 
  but you didn t 
  you ll get another one
  i will 
  a better one 
  a better one 
  that one 
  what one 
that one 
aye  that one 
  what say you 
  aye 
no  no  no  no  no  it s frightful bad
luck to bring a woman aboard  sir 
it d be far worse not to  however 
how can we sail to an island
that nobody can find   
   with a compass that doesn t work 
aye  the compass doesn t point north   
   but we re not trying to find north  are we 
  we should drop canvas  sir 
  she can hold a bit longer 
what s in your head that s put you
in such a fine mood  captain 
we re catching up 
time to go  poppet 
dead men tell no tales 
puts a chill in the bones how many honest
sailors have been claimed by this passage 
how is it that jack came by that compass 
not a lot known about jack sparrow
before he showed up in tortuga   
   with a mind to go after the treasure
of the isla de muerta 
that was before i met him 
back when he was captain of the black pearl 
what 
he failed to mention that 
well  he plays things close to the vest now 
and a hard learned lesson it was 
see three days out on the venture the
first mate comes to him and says   
   everything s an equal share as should
be the location of the treasure too 
so  jack gives up the bearings 
that night there was a mutiny 
they marooned jack on an
island and left him to die 
but not before he d gone
mad with the heat 
so that s the reason for all the   
reason s got nothing to do with it 
now will  when a pirate is marooned
he is a given a pistol with a single shot 
one shot 
well it won t do much good
hunting or to be rescued 
but after three weeks of starvin 
belly and thirst that pistol   
   starts to look real friendly 
but jack  he escaped the island
and he still has that single shot 
oh  but he won t use it though  save for
one man  his mutinous first mate 
  barbossa 
  aye 
  how did jack get off the island 
  well  i ll tell you 
he waded out into the shallows and
he waited there three days and three nights   
till all manner of sea creature came
and acclimated to his presence 
and on the fourth morning   
he roped himself a couple of sea turtles 
rushed them together and made a raft 
  he roped a couple of sea turtles 
  aye  sea turtles 
what did he use for rope 
human hair   
   from my back 
let go of the anchor 
let go of the anchor  sir 
young mr  turner and
i are to go ashore 
captain  what if the worst should happen 
  keep to the code 
  aye  the code 
  ten years of hoarding swag 
  and now we re finally getting to spend it 
once we re quit of the
curse we ll be rich men 
and you can buy an eye that actually
fits and is made of glass 
this one does splinter
something terrible 
stop rubbing it 
what code is gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen 
pirate s code 
any man who falls behind is left behind 
no heroes amongst thieves  eh 
you know for having such a bleak outlook on
pirates you re well on your way to becoming one 
sprung a man from jail  commandeered
a ship of the fleet   
sailed with a buccaneer crew out of tortuga 
and you re completely
obsessed with treasure 
that s not true  i m not
obsessed with treasure 
not all treasure is silver and gold  mate 
gentlemen  the time has come 
salvation is nigh 
  our torment is near at end 
  elizabeth 
for ten years we ve been tested and
tried and each man jack of you here   
has proved his mettle a hundred times
over and a hundred times again 
suffered i have 
punished we were  the lot of us
disproportionate to our crime 
here it is 
the cursed treasure of cortés himself 
every last piece that went
astray we have returned   
save for this 
  jack 
  not yet 
we wait for the opportune moment 
when s that 
when it s of greatest profit to you 
may i ask you something 
have i ever given you reason
not to trust me 
do us a favor  i know it s difficult
for you but please stay here   
and try not to do anything stupid 
and who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods 
  us 
  and whose blood must yet to be paid 
hers 
you know the first thing i m goin 
to do after the curse is lifted   
   eat a whole bushel of apples 
begun by blood  by blood undone 
sorry  jack  i m not going
to be your leverage 
that s it 
waste not 
did it work 
i don t feel no different 
how do we tell 
you re not dead 
no 
  he shot me 
  it didn t work 
  the curse is still upon us 
  yes 
you  maid  your father  what was his name 
was your father william turner 
  no 
  where s his child 
the child that sailed from
england eight years ago 
the child in whose veins flows
the blood of william turner 
where 
you two  you brought us the wrong person 
no  she had the medallion 
she s the proper age 
she said her name was
turner  you heard her 
stupid blighter 
you brought us here for nothing 
i won t take questions and no second guesses 
not from the likes of you  master twigg 
who s to blame  every decision you ve
made has led us from bad to worse 
it was you who sent bootstrap to the depths 
and it s you who brought us here in the first place 
any coward here dare challenge me 
let him speak 
i say  we cut her throat
and spill all her blood 
  just in case 
  yeah 
the medallion  she s taken it 
well  after her 
you pack of ingrates 
the oars have gone missing 
find them 
you 
  you re supposed to be dead 
  am i not 
  parley 
  that s the one  parley  parley 
parley 
damned to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley 
that would be the french 
  not more pirates 
  welcome aboard  miss elizabeth 
  mr  gibbs 
  hey  boy  where be jack 
jack 
jack sparrow 
he fell behind 
keep to the code 
weigh anchor 
hoist the sails 
make quickly 
how the blazes did you
get off that island 
when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land 
you forgot one very important thing mate   
i m captain jack sparrow 
ah  well  i won t be making
that mistake again 
  gents  you all remember captain jack sparrow 
  yeah 
kill him 
the girl s blood didn t work  did it 
hold your fire 
you know whose blood we need 
i know whose blood ye need 
what sort of a man trades
a man s life for a ship 
pirate 
  here  let me 
  thank you 
you said you gave barbossa
my name as yours  why 
i don t know 
i m sorry  blacksmith s hands 
i know they re rough 
no   i mean yes 
they are but   
   but don t stop 
elizabeth   
it s yours 
i thought i d lost it the
day they rescued me 
it was a gift from my father 
he sent it to me 
why did you take it 
because i was afraid
that you were a pirate 
that would ve been awful 
it wasn t your blood they needed   
it was my father s blood   
my blood 
the blood of a pirate 
i m so sorry  please forgive me 
so you expect to leave me standing on some
beach with nothing but a name and your word   
   it s the one i need and watch
you sail away on my ship 
no  i expect to leave you standing on
some beach with absolutely no name   
   at all  watching me sail away on my ship
and then i ll shout the name back to you 
savvy 
but that still leaves us with the problem
of me standing on some beach with naught
   but a name and your word
it s the one i need 
of the two of us i am the only one
who hasn t committed mutiny 
therefore my word is the
one we ll be trusting 
although  i suppose i should be
thanking you because in fact   
   if you hadn t betrayed
me and left me to die   
   i would have an equal share
in that curse same as you 
funny ol  world  innit 
captain  we re coming
up on the interceptor 
i m having a thought here  barbossa 
what say we run up a flag of truce 
i scurry over to the interceptor   
   and i negotiate the return
of your medallion  aye 
what say you to that 
now you see  jack  that s exactly the
attitude that lost you the pearl 
people are easy to search
when they re dead 
lock him in the brig 
hands aloft to loose t gallants  with this
wind she ll carry every sail we ve got 
  what s happening 
  the black pearl  she s gaining on us 
this is the fastest ship
in the caribbean 
you can tell them that
after they ve caught us 
  we re shallow on the draft  right 
  aye 
well  then can t we lose them
amongst those shoals 
we don t have to outrun them
long  just long enough 
lighten the ship 
stem to stern 
anything that we can afford to lose   
see that it s lost 
apparently there s a leak 
haul on the main brace 
make ready the guns 
and run out the sweeps 
we re gonna need that 
  it was a good plan up  till now 
  gibbs 
we have to make a stand 
we must fight 
  load the guns 
  with what 
anything  everything 
anything we have left 
load the guns 
take shot and langrage 
nails and crushed glass 
with a will 
the pearl is going to luff up on our port quarter 
she ll rake us without ever presenting a target 
lower the anchor on the right side 
  on the starboard side 
  it certainly has the element of surprise 
  you re daft  lady  you both are 
  daft like jack 
lower the starboard anchor 
do it ye dogs or it s you we ll
load into the cannons 
let go 
they re clubhaulin  
hard aport 
rack the starboard oars 
hard aport 
keep us steady now 
now 
  fire 
  fire 
stop blowing holes in my ship 
  we could use a few more ideas  lass 
  your turn 
we need us a devil s dowry 
  we ll give them her 
  she s not what they re after 
the medallion 
strike yer colors ya bloomin  cockroaches 
hands  grapples  at the ready 
prepare to board 
koehler and twigg go to the powder magazine  
and the rest of you bring me the medallion 
hey  below 
thanks very much 
jack 
bloody empty 
that s not very nice 
where s the medallion 
wretch 
  ah  where s dear william 
  will 
  will 
  elizabeth 
monkey 
i can t move it 
elizabeth 
  why thank you  jack 
  you re welcome 
not you  we named the monkey jack 
  gents  our hope is restored 
  yeah 
if any of you so much as thinks the word parley 
i ll have your guts for garters 
will   
you ve got to stop it 
stop it 
welcome back  miss  you took
advantage of our hospitality last time 
it holds fair now that
you return the favor 
barbossa 
will 
she goes free 
  what s in your head  boy 
  she goes free 
you ve only got one shot
and we can t die 
don t do anything stupid 
you can t   i can 
like that 
  who are you 
  no one  he s no one 
a distant cousin of my aunt s
nephew twice removed 
lovely singing voice  though 
eunuch 
my name is will turner 
my father was bootstrap bill turner 
his blood runs in my veins 
he s a spitting image of ol  bootstrap
bill come back to haunt us 
on my word do as i say or
i ll pull this trigger   
and be lost to davy jones  locker 
  name your terms  mr  turner 
  elizabeth goes free 
yes  we know that one 
anything else 
and the crew  the crew
are not to be harmed 
agreed 
go on  walk the plank 
barbossa  you lying bastard 
you swore she d go free 
don t dare impugn me honor  boy 
i agreed she d go free it was you who failed   
   to specify when or where 
though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine  don t it lads 
so i ll be having that
dress back before you go 
i always liked you 
it goes with your black heart 
ooh  it s still warm 
off you go 
come on 
too long 
i really had rather hoped
we were past all this 
jack  jack 
did ya not notice 
that be the same little island that we made you governor of on our last little trip 
i did notice 
perhaps you ll be able to conjure
up another miraculous escape 
but i doubt it 
off you go 
last time you left me
a pistol with one shot 
by the powers  you re right  were
be jack s pistol  bring it forward 
seeing as there s two of us  a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols 
it ll be one pistol as before
and you can be the gentleman   
   and shoot the lady and
starve to death yourself 
that s the second time i ve had to watch
that man sail away with my ship 
but you were marooned on this island before  weren t you 
so we can escape in the same way you did then 
to what point and purpose  young missy 
the black pearl is gone 
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice   
unlikely  young mr  turner will be dead
long before you can reach him 
but you re captain jack sparrow 
you vanished from under the eyes of
7 agents of the east india company 
you sacked nassau port
without even firing a shot 
are you the pirate
i ve read about or not 
how did you escape last time 
last time   i was here a grand
total of three days  alright 
last time   
   the rumrunners used this island as a cache 
came by and i was able
to barter a passage off 
from the looks of things  they ve
long been out of business 
probably have your bloody friend
norrington to thank for that 
so that s it then 
that s the secret grand adventure
of the infamous jack sparrow 
you spent three days lying
on a beach  drinking rum 
welcome to the caribbean  love 
we re devils and black sheep
and really bad eggs 
drink up me  earties yo ho 
yo ho yo ho a pirate s life for me 
i love this song 
really bad eggs 
when i get the pearl back 
i m gonna teach it to the whole crew 
and we ll sing it all the time 
and you ll be positively the most
fearsome pirate in the spanish main 
not just the spanish main  love 
the entire ocean   
the entire world 
wherever we want to go  we ll go 
that s what a ship is  you know 
it s not just a keel and a hull and a deck
and sails that s what a ship needs   
but what a ship is   
what the black pearl really is   
   is freedom 
jack   
it must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island 
oh  yes 
but the company is infinitely
better than last time  i think 
and the scenery has definitely improved 
mr  sparrow  i m not entirely sure that i ve   
   had enough rum
to allow that kind of talk 
i know exactly what you mean  love 
to freedom 
to the black pearl 
no  not good 
stop  not good 
what are you doing  you burned
all the food  the shade  the rum 
yes  the rum is gone 
why is the rum gone 
one  because it is a vile drink that turns even
the most respectable men into complete scoundrels 
two  that signal is over a thousand feet high 
the entire royal navy is out looking for me 
do you really think that there is even the
slightest chance that they won t see it 
but why is the rum gone 
just wait  captain sparrow 
you give it one hour  maybe two  keep
a weather eye open and you will see   
   white sails on that horizon 
must ve been terrible for you to be trapped here  jack 
must ve been terrible for you   
well it bloody is now 
there ll be no living
with her after this 
  but we ve got to save will 
  no 
you re safe now 
we will return to port royal immediately
not go gallivanting after pirates 
then we condemn him to death 
the boy s fate is regrettable 
but then so is his decision
to engage in piracy 
to rescue me  to prevent anything
from happening to me 
if i may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion 
the pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle 
it s very unlikely she ll be
able to make good time 
think about it 
the black pearl 
the last real pirate threat
in the caribbean  mate 
how can you pass that up 
by remembering that i serve others 
mr  sparrow  not only myself 
commodore  i beg you  please do this 
for me   as a wedding gift 
elizabeth  are you accepting
the commodore s proposal 
i am 
a wedding 
i love weddings  drinks all around 
i know  clap him in irons  right 
mr  sparrow 
you will accompany these fine
men to the helm and provide us   
   with the bearing to isla de muerta 
you will then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase   
 silent as the grave  
do i make myself clear 
inescapably clear 
shiver me timbers 
cotton  ere says you missed a bit 
you knew william turner 
ol  bootstrap bill   we knew him 
never sat well with bootstrap
what we did to jack sparrow 
the mutiny and all 
he said it wasn t right with the code 
that s why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you as it were 
he said we deserved to be cursed   
   and remain cursed 
  stupid blighter
  good man 
but as you can imagine   
that didn t sit too well
with the captain 
that didn t sit too well with the captain 
at all  tell him what barbossa did 
i m telling the story 
so   
what the captain did   
he strapped a cannon to
bootstraps  bootstraps 
the last we saw of ol  bill turner   
he was sinking to the crushing black
oblivion of davy jones  locker 
 course it was only after that   
we learned we needed his
blood to lift the curse 
that s what you call ironic 
bring him 
i don t care for the situation 
any attempt to storm the cave
could turn to an ambush 
not if you re the one doing the ambushing 
i go in to convince barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats 
you and your mates return to the dauntless and blast the
bejesus outta them with your little cannons  aye 
what do you have to lose 
nothing i d lament being rid of 
now  to be quite honest with you   
there s still a slight risk for those aboard the dauntless
which includes the future mrs  commodore 
sorry  but for your own safety 
i don t care what the commodore
ordered  i have to tell him 
  the pirates   they cannot be killed 
  don t worry  miss  he s already informed of that 
a little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story 
this is jack sparrow s doing 
no reason to fret  it s just a prick of
the finger and a few drops of blood 
no mistakes this time  he s only
half turner  we spill it all 
guess there is reason to fret 
beg your pardon 
begun by blood   
excuse me 
   by blood un   
jack 
  it s not possible 
  not probable 
  where s elizabeth 
  she s safe  just like i promised 
she s all set to marry norrington 
just like she promised 
and you get to die for her 
just like you promised
so we re all men of our word really 
except for elizabeth who
is  in fact  a woman 
shut up  you re next 
you don t want to be doing that  mate 
no  i really think i do 
your funeral 
  why don t i want to be doing it 
  well  because   
because the hms dauntless 
pride of the royal navy   
is floating just offshore   
waiting for you 
what are we doing here 
pirates come out   
unprepared and unawares 
we catch them in the crossfire   
send them down to see old hobb 
i know why we re here 
i mean   
why aren t we doing what it was what
mr  sparrow said we should do 
  with the cannons and all 
  because it was mr  sparrow who said it 
you think he wasn t telling the truth 
just hear me out  mate 
you order your men to row out to the
dauntless  they do what they do best 
robert s your uncle fannie s your aunt 
there you are with two ships 
the makings of your very own fleet 
 course you ll take the grandest as
your flagship and who s to argue 
but what of the pearl 
name me captain 
i ll sail under your colors 
i ll give you ten percent of me plunder   
   and you get to introduce yourself as   
   commodore barbossa  savvy 
i suppose in exchange you want
me not to kill the whelp 
no  no  not at all by all
means  kill the whelp 
just not yet 
wait to lift the curse   
until the opportune moment 
for instance   
after you ve killed norrington s men   
every    last    one 
you ve been planning this
from the beginning 
ever since you learned my name 
yeah 
i want fifty percent of your plunder 
  15 
  40 
  25 
and i ll buy you the hat 
a really big one   
commodore 
we have an accord 
all hand s to the boats 
apologies  you give the orders 
gents  take a walk 
not to the boats 
hold fire 
this is just like what the
greeks done at troy 
except they was in a
horse instead of dresses 
wooden horse 
a moment  please 
elizabeth 
i just want you to know i   i believe you
made a very good decision today 
couldn t be more proud of you 
but you know  even a good decision
if made for the wrong reasons   
   can be a wrong decision 
lieutenant 
elizabeth 
are you there 
elizabeth  are you even listening to me 
oh  what have you done 
stop that 
i already feel like a fool 
you look nice  though 
i look nice 
i must admit  jack 
i thought i had ye figured 
it turns out that you re
a hard man to predict 
me  i m dishonest  and a dishonest
man you can always trust to be   
   dishonest 
honestly  it s the honest
ones you want to watch out for 
because you can never predict when they re
going to do something incredibly   
   stupid 
you re off the edge of the map  mate 
here there be monsters 
roger that 
what would you pick to eat first 
i think we should decide now 
just so we re ready
when the time comes 
what was that 
it s elizabeth 
make for the ship  move 
you can t beat me jack 
that s interesting 
couldn t resist  mate 
sorry 
so what now  jack sparrow  will
it be two immortals locked in   
an epic battle until judgment
day and trumpets sound 
or you could surrender 
all of you with me  will is in that
cave and we must save him 
ready  and heave 
please  i need your help  come on 
any port in the storm 
cotton s right  we ve got the pearl 
  what about jack  you re just going to leave him 
  jack owes us a ship 
  there s the code to consider
  the code 
you re pirates  hang the
code and hang the rules 
they re more like guidelines anyway 
bloody pirates 
  oy 
  what 
  is it supposed to be doing that 
  they re stealing our ship 
bloody pirates 
come on 
ah  me eye 
i m gonna teach you
the meaning of pain 
you like pain 
try wearing a corset 
  whose side is jack on 
  at the moment 
no fair 
ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot 
he didn t waste it 
i feel   
   cold 
parley 
the ship is ours  gentlemen 
we should return to the dauntless 
your fiancé will be wanting
to know you re safe 
if you were waiting for the
opportune moment   
   that was it 
now if you ll be so kind  i d be much
obliged if you d drop me off my ship 
i m sorry  jack 
they done what s right by them 
can t expect more than that 
jack sparrow   
captain 
captain jack sparrow 
   for your willful commission
of crimes against the crown 
said crimes being numerous in
quantity and sinister in nature 
the most grievous of these
to be cited herewith 
piracy  smuggling   
this is wrong 
commodore norrington is bound
by the law  as are we all 
   impersonating an officer of
the spanish royal navy   
   impersonating a cleric of
the church of england   
   sailing under false colors  arson 
kidnapping  looting  poaching   
   brigandage  pilfering  depravity 
depredation and general lawlessness 
and for these crimes you have been
sentenced to be on this day   
   hung by the neck until dead 
may god have mercy on your soul 
governor swann 
commodore 
elizabeth 
i should have told you every day
from the moment i met you   
i love you 
marines 
can t breathe 
elizabeth 
move 
i thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill conceived escape attempt   
   but not from you 
on our return to port royal 
i granted you clemency 
and this is how you thank me 
by throwing in your lot with him 
he s a pirate 
and a good man 
if all i have achieved here is that
the hangman will earn two pairs   
of boots instead of one 
so be it 
at least my conscience
will be clear 
you forget your place  turner 
it s right here 
between you and jack 
  as is mine 
  elizabeth 
lower your weapons 
for goodness  sake put them down 
so this is where your
heart truly lies  then 
it is 
well  i m actually feeling
rather good about this 
i think we ve all arrived at
a very special place  eh 
spiritually  ecumenically 
grammatically 
i want you to know that
i was rooting for you  mate 
know that 
elizabeth   
it would never have worked
between us  darling 
i m sorry 
will   
nice hat 
men 
this is the day that you will always
remember as the day that you   
idiot 
he has nowhere to go
but back to the noose 
sail ho 
what s your plan of action 
sir 
perhaps on the rare occasion 
pursuing the right course   
   demands an act of piracy   
piracy itself can be
the right course 
mr  turner 
i will accept the consequences
of my actions 
this is a beautiful sword 
i would expect the man who made
it to show the same care and   
   devotion in every
aspect of his life 
thank you 
commodore 
what about sparrow 
well  i think we can afford to give
him one day s head start 
so  this is the path you ve chosen  is it 
after all   he is a blacksmith 
no 
he s a pirate 
i thought you were supposed
to keep to the code 
we figured they were more
actual   guidelines 
thank you 
captain sparrow 
   the black pearl is yours
