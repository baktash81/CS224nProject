yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me
we extort we pilfer we filch and sack
drink up
quiet missy
cursed pirates sail these waters
you dont want to bring them
down on us now do ya
mr gibbs that will do
she was singing about pirates
bad luck to be singing about pirates with us
mired in this unnatural fog mark my words
consider them marked
on your way
aye lieutenant
its bad luck to have a woman on board too
even a miniature one
i think itd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate
think again miss swann
vile and dissolute creatures
the lot of them
i intend to see to that any man who sails
under a pirate flag or
wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves
a short drop and a sudden stop
lieutenant norrington
i appreciate your fervor
but imim concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter
my apologies governor swann
actually i find it all fascinating
yes thats what concerns me
look a boy
theres a boy in the water
man overboard
haul him aboard
hes still breathing
mary mother of god
what happened here
its most likely the powder magazine
merchant vessels run heavily armed
a lot of good it did them
everyones thinking it
im just saying itpirates
theres no proof of that
it was probably an accident
rouse the captain immediately
aye sir
heave to and take in sail
launch the boats
elizabeth i want you to accompany the boy
hell be in your charge
take care of him
its ok
my names elizabeth swann
will turner
im watching over you will
youre a pirate

his name is william turner
thats all i found out
take him below
elizabeth
are you alright
are you decent
yes yes
still abed at this hour
its a beautiful day
i have a gift for you
oh its beautiful
isnt it
may i inquire as to the occasion
does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter
go on
actually i uh
i had hoped you might wear
it for the ceremony today
the ceremony
captain norringtons
promotion ceremony
i knew it
commodore norrington
hes about to become
fine gentleman dont you think
he fancies you
elizabeth
hows it coming
its difficult to say
im told its the latest
fashion in london
well women in london mustve
learned not to breathe
mlord you have a visitor
ah mr turner
good to see you again
good day sir
i have your order
the blade is folded steel thats gold
filigree laid into the handle
if i may
perfectly balanced the tang is
nearly the full width of the blade
impressive very impressive
ah now commodore norrington is
going to be very pleased with this
do pass my compliments
on to your master
i shall
a craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated
ah elizabeth you look absolutely stunning
will
so good to see you
i had a dream about you last night
about me
elizabeth is that entirely
proper for you to
about the day we met
do you remember
how could i forget miss swann
will how many times must
i ask you to call me elizabeth
at least once more
miss swann as always
there see at least the boy has
a sense of propriety
now we really must be going
farewell
good day mr turner
come along
good day
elizabeth
what
hold up there you
its a shilling to tie up your
boat at the dock
and i shall need to
know your name
what dye say to three shillings
and we forget the name
welcome to port royal mr smith
two paces front
right about turn
present
arms
this dock is off limits to civilians
im terribly sorry i didnt know
if i see one
i shall inform you immediately
apparently theres some sort of a high toned
and fancy to do up at the fort eh
how could it be that two upstanding gentlemen
such as yourselves did not merit an invitation
someone has to make sure this
dock stays off limits to civilians
its a fine goal to be sure but
it seems to me that a
a ship like that makes this one
here a bit superfluous really
ah the dauntless is the power
in these waters true enough
but theres no ship that can match
the interceptor for speed
ive heard of one supposed to be
very fast nigh uncatchable
the black pearl
welltheres no real ship that
can match the interceptor
the black pearl is a real ship
no no its not
yes it is ive seen it
youve seen it
yes
you havent seen it
yes i have
youve seen a ship with black sails
thats crewed by the damned and
captained by a man so evil
that hell itself spat him back out
no
no
but i have seen a ship
with black sails
oh and no ship thats not crewed by
the damned and captained by a man so evil
that hell itself spat him
back out could possibly
have black sails therefore couldnt
possibly be any other
ship than the black pearl
is that what youre saying
no
like i said theres no real ship
that can match the interceptor
hey
you
get away from there you dont
have permission to be aboard there mate
im sorry its just its such
a pretty boat  ship
whats your name
smith orsmithy if you like
whats your purpose in
port royal mr smith
yeah and no lies
well then i confess it is my intention
to commandeer one of these ships
pick up a crew in tortuga raid pillage plunder
and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out
i said no lies
i think hes telling the truth
if he were telling the truth
he wouldnt have told us
unless of course he knew you wouldnt
believe the truth even if he told it to you
may i have a moment
you look lovely elizabeth
yes
i apologize if i seem forward but i
must speak my mind
this promotion throws into sharp
relief that which i have
not yet achieved
a marriage to a fine woman
you have become a fine
woman elizabeth
i cant breathe
yes im a bit nervous myself
and then they made me their chief
elizabeth
elizabeth
the rocks
sir its a miracle she missed them
will you be saving her then
i cant swim
pearl of the kings navy you are
do not lose these
what was that
i got her
not breathing
move
never would have thought of that
clearly youve never been to singapore
where did you get that
on your feet
elizabeth
are you alright
yes im fine
shoot him
father
commodore do you really
intend to kill my rescuer
i believe thanks are in order
had a brush with the east india
trading company did we
pirate
hang him
keep your guns on him men
gillette fetch some irons
well well jack sparrow isnt it
captain jack sparrow if you please sir
well i dont see your shipcaptain
im in the market as it were
he said hed come to commandeer one
told ya he was telling the truth
these are his sir
no additional shots nor powder
a compass that doesnt point north
and i half expected it
to be made of wood
you are without doubt the worst
pirate ive ever heard of
but you have heard of me
commodore i really must protest
carefully lieutenant
pirate or not this man saved my life
one good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness
though it seems enough
to condemn him
indeed
finally
no dont shoot
i knew youd warm up to me
commodore norrington my effects please
and my hat
commodore
elizabeth it is elizabeth isnt it
its miss swann
miss swann if youd be so kind
come come dear we dont have all day
now if youd be very kind
easy on the goods darling
youre despicable
sticks and stones love i saved your
life you saved mine were square
gentlemen mlady
you will always remember this as
the day that you almost caught
captain jack sparrow
now will you shoot him
open fire
on his heels
gillette mr sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows
i would hate for him to miss it
search upstairs
look lively men
right where i left you
not where i left you
youre the one theyre hunting
the pirate
you seem somewhat familiar
have i threatened you before
i make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates
ah well then it would be a shame to
put a black mark on your record
so if youll excuse me
do you think this wise boy
crossing blades with a pirate
you threatened miss swann
only a little
you know what youre doing
ill give you that excellent form
but hows your footwork
if i step here
very good
now i step again
ta
that is a wonderful trick
except once again you are
between me and my way out
and now you have no weapon
who makes all these
i do
and i practice with them
three hours a day
you need to find yourself a girl mate
or perhaps the reason you practice three
hours a day is that you already found one
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet
youre not a eunuch are you
i practice three hours a day
so that when i meet a pirate
i can kill it
you cheated
pirate
move away
no
please move
no
i cannot just step aside
and let you escape
this shot is not meant for you
excellent work mr brown youve assisted
in the capture of a dangerous fugitive
just doing my civic duty sir
well i trust youll always remember
this as the day that captain
jack sparrow almost escaped
take him away
can you smell it
come here boy
want a nice juicy bone
come here boy
you can keep doing that forever
the dog is never going to move
oh excuse us if we havent resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet
there you go miss
its a difficult day for you i am sure
i suspected commodore norrington would propose but
i must admit i wasnt entirely prepared for it
well i meant you being threatened
by that pirate sounds terrifying
oh yes it was terrifying
but the commodore proposed
fancy that
now thats a smart match miss
if its not too bold to say
it is a smart match
hes a fine man
the sort any woman should dream of marrying
well that will turner
hes a fine man too
that is too bold
well begging your pardon miss
it was not my place
has my daughter given you an answer yet
no she hasnt
well she has had a very trying day
ghastly weather dont you think
bleak very bleak
whats that
cannon fire
return fire
i know those guns
its the pearl
black pearl
ive heard stories shes been preying on
ships and settlements for near ten years
never leaves any survivors
no survivors
then where do the stories
come from i wonder
governor
barricade yourself in my office
thats an order
dont
hello chump
up there
girl
miss swann theyve come to kidnap you
what
youre the governors daughter
they havent seen you hide and the
first chance you get run to the fort
gotcha
its hot its on me
come on
we know youre here poppet
poppet
come out
we promise we wont hurt you
we will find you poppet
youve got something of
ours and it calls to us
the gold calls to us
gold calls
ello poppet
parley
what
parley i invoke the right of parley
according to the code of the brethren set down
by the pirates morgan and bartholomew
you have to take me to your captain
i know the code
if an adversary demands parley you
can do them no harm until
the parley is complete
to blazes with the code
she wants to be taken to the captain
and shell go without a fuss
we must honor the code
say goodbye
goodbye
come on
elizabeth
outta my way scum
my sympathies friend youve
no manner of luck at all
come on doggy
its just you and me now
its you and ol jack come on
come on good boy
thats it good boy come on
bit closer bit closer
thats it thats it doggy
come on you filthy slimy mangy cad
no no no no no
i didnt mean it i didnt
this aint the armory
well well well
look what we have here twigg
captain jack sparrow
last time i saw you you were all
alone on a godforsaken island
shrinking into the distance
his fortunes arent improved much
worry about your own
fortunes gentlemen
the deepest circle of hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers
so there is a curse
thats interesting
you know nothing of hell
thats very interesting
i didnt know we were
takin on captives
shes invoked the right of parley
with captain barbossa
i am here to negotiate
you will speak when spoken to
and yell not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley
aye sir
my apologies miss
captain barbossa i am here to negotiate
the cessation of hostilities
against port royal
there are a lot of long words in there miss
were naught but humble pirates
what is it that you want
i want you to leave and never come back
im disinclined to acquiesce to your request
means no
very well
ill drop it
me holds are burstin with swag and
that bit of shine matters to us
why
its what youve been searching for
i recognized the ship i saw it eight years
ago on the crossing from england
did ya now
fine
well i suppose if it is worthless then
theres no point in me keeping it
you have a name missy
elizabeth turner
im a maid in the
governors household
miss turner
bootstrap
and how does a maid come to
own a trinket such as that
family heirloom perhaps
i didnt steal it if thats what you mean
very well you hand it over and well put your
town to our rudder and never return
our bargain
still the guns and stow em signal the men set the flags
wait you have to take me to shore
according to the code of the order of the brethren
first your return to shore was
not part of our negotiations
nor our agreement so
i must do nothing
and secondly you must be a pirate for
the pirates code to apply and youre not
and thirdly the code is more what youd
call guidelines than actual rules
welcome aboard the black pearl
miss turner
theyve taken her
theyve taken elizabeth
mr murtogg remove this man
we have to hunt them down
we must save her
and where do you propose we start
if you have any information concerning
my daughter please share it
that jack sparrow
he talked about the black pearl
mentioned it is more what he did
ask him where it is
make a deal with him
he could lead us to it
no
the pirates who invaded this fort left
sparrow locked in his cell ergo
they are not his allies
governor we will establish
their most likely course
thats not good enough
mr turner you are not a military
man you are not a sailor
you are a blacksmith and this is
not the moment for rash actions
do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here
who cares for elizabeth
you sparrow
aye
you are familiar with that ship
the black pearl
ive heard of it
where does it make berth
where does it make berth
have you not heard the stories
captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants
sailed from the dreaded isla de muerta
its an island that cannot be found except
by those who already know where it is
the ships real enough
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place where is it
why ask me
because youre a pirate
and you want to turn pirate
yourself is that it
never
they took miss swann
oh so it is that youve found a girl
i see
well if youre intending to brave all hasten
to her rescue and so win fair ladys heart
youll have to do it alone mate
i see no profit in it for me
i can get you out of here
hows that the keys run off
i helped build these cells
these are half pinbarrel hinges
with the right leverage and
a proper application of strength
the door will lift free
whats your name
will turner
that will be short for william
i imagine
good strong name no doubt
named for your father aye
yes
well mr turner
ive changed me mind
if you spring me from this cell
i swear on pain of death
i shall take you to the black
pearl and your bonny lass
do we have an accord
agreed
agreed get me out
hurry someone will
have heard that
not without my effects
were going to steal a ship
that ship
commandeer
were going to commandeer that ship
nautical term
one question about your business boy
or theres no use going
this girl how far are you
willing to go to save her
id die for her
oh good
no worries then
this is either madness or brilliance
its remarkable how often
those two traits coincide
everyone stay calm
we are taking over the ship
aye avast
this ship cannot be crewed by two men
youll never make it out of the bay
son
im captain jack sparrow savvy
commodore
sir theyve taken the dauntless
theyve taken the ship
sparrow and turner
theyve taken the dauntless
rash turner too rash
he is without doubt the worst
pirate i have ever seen
here they come
bring her around
bring her around
search every cabin every hold
down to the bilges
sailors back to the interceptor now
quickly men
thank you commodore for
getting us ready to make way
wed have a hard time
of it by ourselves
set top sails and clear up this mess
with the wind a quarter astern
we wont catch them
we dont need to catch them just
get them in range of the long nines
men come about
run out the guns
we open fire on our own ship sir
id rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate
commodore hes disabled
the rudder chain sir
abandon ship
thats got to be the best
pirate ive ever seen
so it would seem
when i was a lad living in england
my mother raised me by herself
after she died i came out here
looking for my father
is that so
my father will turner
and in jail it was only after you learned
my name that you agreed to help
since thats what i wanted
i didnt press the matter
im not a simpleton jack
you knew my father
i knew im
probably one the few who knew
him as william turner
everyone else just called him
bootstrap or bootstrap bill
bootstrap
good man good pirate
i swear you look just like him
its not true
he was a merchant sailor a good
respectable man who obeyed the law
he was a bloody pirate a scallywag
my father was not a pirate
put it away son
its not worth you getting beat again
you didnt beat me
you ignored the rules of engagement
in a fair fight id killed you
and thats no incentive for
me to fight fair is it
now as long as youre just
hanging there pay attention
the only rules that really
matter are these
what a man can do and
what a man cant do
for instance you can accept that your
father was a pirate and a good man
or you cant
but pirate is in your blood boy so youll
have to square with that someday
and me for example
i can let you drown
but i cant bring this ship into tortuga
all by me onesies savvy
so
can you sail under the
command of a pirate
or can you not
tortuga
tortuga
more importantly it is indeed a sad life
that has never breathed deep
the sweet proliferous bouquet that is tortuga savvy
what do you think
itll linger
ill tell you mate
if every town in the world were like this one
no man would ever feel unwanted
scarlett
not sure i deserved that
giselle
who was she
what
i may have deserved that
curse you for breathing
you slack jawed idiot
mothers love
jack
you should know better then to wake
a man when hes sleeping
its bad luck
ah fortunately i know how to counter it
the man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink
the man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to a proposition
from the man who did the waking
aye thatll about do it
blast im already awake
that was for the smell
keep a sharp eye
now whats the nature of
this venture you are in
im going after the black pearl
i know where its going to be
and im going to take it
jack its a fools errand
well you know better than me
the tales of the black pearl
thats why i know what
barbossa is up to
all i need is a crew
from what i hear tell of captain barbossa
hes not a man to suffer fools
nor strike a bargain with one
well then i say its a very good
thing im not a fool then aye
prove me wrong what makes ye think
barbossa will give up his ship to you
lets just say its a matter of leverage aye
the kid
that is the child of bootstrap bill turner
his only child savvy
is he now
leverage says you
i think i feel a change in the wind says i
ill find us a crew
theres bound to be some sailors
on this rock crazy as you
one can only hope
take what you can
give nothing back
youll be dinin with the captain
and he requests you wear this
well you may tell the captain that i am
disinclined to acquiesce to his request
he said youd say that
he also said if that be the case
youll be dinin with the crew
and youll be naked
fine
theres no need to stand on ceremony
nor call to impress anyone
you must be hungry
try the wine
and the apples
one of those next
its poisoned
there would be no sense to
be killing ye miss turner
then release me you have your trinket
im of no further value to you
you dont know what this is do ye
its a pirate medallion
this is aztec gold
one of 882 identical pieces they delivered
in a stone chest to cortés himself
blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies
but the greed of cortés was insatiable
so the heathen gods placed upon
the golda terrible curse
any mortal that removes but
a piece from that stone chest
shall be punished for eternity
i hardly believe in ghost stories
anymore captain barbossa
aye
thats exactly what i thought when
we were first told the tale
buried on an island that
cannot be found except
for those who know where it is
find it we did
there be the chest
inside be the gold
we took them all
spent them and traded them
we frittered them awayon drink
and food and pleasurable company
the more we gave them away
the more we came to realize
the drink would not satisfy
food turned to ash in our mouths
and all the pleasurable company in
the world could not slake our lust
we are cursed men miss turner
compelled by greed we were
and now we are consumed by it
there is one way we
can end our curse
all the scattered pieces of the
aztec gold must be restored
and the blood repaid
thanks to you we have the final piece
and the blood to be repaid
thats why theres no sense
to be killing you
yet
apple
im curious after killing me what is
it you are planning on doing next
look
the moonlight shows us
for what we really are
we are not among the living
and so we cannot die
but neither are we dead
for too long ive been parched with
thirst and unable to quench it
too long ive been starving
to death and havent died
i feel nothing not the wind on my
face nor the spray of the sea
nor the warmth of a womans flesh
you best start believing in
ghost stories miss turner
youre in one
what are ye looking at
back to work
feast your eyes captain
all of them faithful hands before the mast
every man worth his salt
and crazy to boot
so this is your ablebodied crew
you sailor  cotton sir
mr cotton
do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders
and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death
mr cotton answer man
hes a mute sir poor devil had his tongue cut
out so he trained the parrot to talk for him
no ones yet figured how
mr cottons parrot
same question
wind in the sails
wind in the sails
mostly we figure that means yes
ocourse it does satisfied
well youve proved theyre mad
and whats the benefit for us
anamaria
i suppose you didnt deserve that one either
no that one i deserved
you stole my boat
actually
borrowed borrowed without permission
but with every intention of bringing it back to you
but you didnt
youll get another one
i will
a better one
a better one
that one
what one
that one
aye that one
what say you
aye
no no no no no its frightful bad
luck to bring a woman aboard sir
itd be far worse not to however
how can we sail to an island
that nobody can find
with a compass that doesnt work
aye the compass doesnt point north
but were not trying to find north are we
we should drop canvas sir
she can hold a bit longer
whats in your head thats put you
in such a fine mood captain
were catching up
time to go poppet
dead men tell no tales
puts a chill in the bones how many honest
sailors have been claimed by this passage
how is it that jack came by that compass
not a lot known about jack sparrow
before he showed up in tortuga
with a mind to go after the treasure
of the isla de muerta
that was before i met him
back when he was captain of the black pearl
what
he failed to mention that
well he plays things close to the vest now
and a hard learned lesson it was
see three days out on the venture the
first mate comes to him and says
everythings an equal share as should
be the location of the treasure too
so jack gives up the bearings
that night there was a mutiny
they marooned jack on an
island and left him to die
but not before hed gone
mad with the heat
so thats the reason for all the
reasons got nothing to do with it
now will when a pirate is marooned
he is a given a pistol with a single shot
one shot
well it wont do much good
hunting or to be rescued
but after three weeks of starvin
belly and thirst that pistol
starts to look real friendly
but jack he escaped the island
and he still has that single shot
oh but he wont use it though save for
one man his mutinous first mate
barbossa
aye
how did jack get off the island
well ill tell you
he waded out into the shallows and
he waited there three days and three nights
till all manner of sea creature came
and acclimated to his presence
and on the fourth morning
he roped himself a couple of sea turtles
rushed them together and made a raft
he roped a couple of sea turtles
aye sea turtles
what did he use for rope
human hair
from my back
let go of the anchor
let go of the anchor sir
young mr turner and
i are to go ashore
captain what if the worst should happen
keep to the code
aye the code
ten years of hoarding swag
and now were finally getting to spend it
once were quit of the
curse well be rich men
and you can buy an eye that actually
fits and is made of glass
this one does splinter
something terrible
stop rubbing it
what code is gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen
pirates code
any man who falls behind is left behind
no heroes amongst thieves eh
you know for having such a bleak outlook on
pirates youre well on your way to becoming one
sprung a man from jail commandeered
a ship of the fleet
sailed with a buccaneer crew out of tortuga
and youre completely
obsessed with treasure
thats not true im not
obsessed with treasure
not all treasure is silver and gold mate
gentlemen the time has come
salvation is nigh
our torment is near at end
elizabeth
for ten years weve been tested and
tried and each manjack of you here
has proved his mettle a hundred times
over and a hundred times again
suffered i have
punished we were the lot of us
disproportionate to our crime
here it is
the cursed treasure of cortés himself
every last piece that went
astray we have returned
save for this
jack
not yet
we wait for the opportune moment
whens that
when its of greatest profit to you
may i ask you something
have i ever given you reason
not to trust me
do us a favor i know its difficult
for you but please stay here
and try not to do anything stupid
and who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods
us
and whose blood must yet to be paid
hers
you know the first thing im goin
to do after the curse is lifted
eat a whole bushel of apples
begun by blood by blood undone
sorry jack im not going
to be your leverage
thats it
waste not
did it work
i dont feel no different
how do we tell
youre not dead
no
he shot me
it didnt work
the curse is still upon us
yes
you maid your father what was his name
was your father william turner
no
wheres his child
the child that sailed from
england eight years ago
the child in whose veins flows
the blood of william turner
where
you two you brought us the wrong person
no she had the medallion
shes the proper age
she said her name was
turner you heard her
stupid blighter
you brought us here for nothing
i wont take questions and no second guesses
not from the likes of you master twigg
whos to blame every decision youve
made has led us from bad to worse
it was you who sent bootstrap to the depths
and its you who brought us here in the first place
any coward here dare challenge me
let him speak
i say we cut her throat
and spill all her blood
just in case
yeah
the medallion shes taken it
well after her
you pack of ingrates
the oars have gone missing
find them
you
youre supposed to be dead
am i not
parley
thats the one parley parley
parley
damned to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley
that would be the french
not more pirates
welcome aboard miss elizabeth
mr gibbs
hey boy where be jack
jack
jack sparrow
he fell behind
keep to the code
weigh anchor
hoist the sails
make quickly
how the blazes did you
get off that island
when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land
you forgot one very important thing mate
im captain jack sparrow
ah well i wont be making
that mistake again
gents you all remember captain jack sparrow
yeah
kill him
the girls blood didnt work did it
hold your fire
you know whose blood we need
i know whose blood ye need
what sort of a man trades
a mans life for a ship
pirate
here let me
thank you
you said you gave barbossa
my name as yours why
i dont know
im sorry blacksmiths hands
i know theyre rough
noi mean yes
they are but
but dont stop
elizabeth
its yours
i thought id lost it the
day they rescued me
it was a gift from my father
he sent it to me
why did you take it
because i was afraid
that you were a pirate
that wouldve been awful
it wasnt your blood they needed
it was my fathers blood
my blood
the blood of a pirate
im so sorry please forgive me
so you expect to leave me standing on some
beach with nothing but a name and your word
its the one i need and watch
you sail away on my ship
no i expect to leave you standing on
some beach with absolutely no name
at all watching me sail away on my ship
and then ill shout the name back to you
savvy
but that still leaves us with the problem
of me standing on some beach with naught
but a name and your word
its the one i need
of the two of us i am the only one
who hasnt committed mutiny
therefore my word is the
one well be trusting
although i suppose i should be
thanking you because in fact
if you hadnt betrayed
me and left me to die
i would have an equal share
in that curse same as you
funny ol world innit
captain were coming
up on the interceptor
im having a thought here barbossa
what say we run up a flag of truce
i scurry over to the interceptor
and i negotiate the return
of your medallion aye
what say you to that
now you see jack thats exactly the
attitude that lost you the pearl
people are easy to search
when theyre dead
lock him in the brig
hands aloft to loose tgallants with this
wind shell carry every sail weve got
whats happening
the black pearl shes gaining on us
this is the fastest ship
in the caribbean
you can tell them that
after theyve caught us
were shallow on the draft right
aye
well then cant we lose them
amongst those shoals
we dont have to outrun them
long just long enough
lighten the ship
stem to stern
anything that we can afford to lose
see that its lost
apparently theres a leak
haul on the main brace
make ready the guns
and run out the sweeps
were gonna need that
it was a good plan up till now
gibbs
we have to make a stand
we must fight
load the guns
with what
anything everything
anything we have left
load the guns
take shot and langrage
nails and crushed glass
with a will
the pearl is going to luff up on our port quarter
shell rake us without ever presenting a target
lower the anchor on the right side
on the starboard side
it certainly has the element of surprise
youre daft lady you both are
daft like jack
lower the starboard anchor
do it ye dogs or its you well
load into the cannons
let go
theyre clubhaulin
hard aport
rack the starboard oars
hard aport
keep us steady now
now
fire
fire
stop blowing holes in my ship
we could use a few more ideas lass
your turn
we need us a devils dowry
well give them her
shes not what theyre after
the medallion
strike yer colors ya bloomin cockroaches
hands grapples at the ready
prepare to board
koehler and twigg go to the powder magazine
and the rest of you bring me the medallion
hey below
thanks very much
jack
bloody empty
thats not very nice
wheres the medallion
wretch
ah wheres dear william
will
will
elizabeth
monkey
i cant move it
elizabeth
why thank you jack
youre welcome
not you we named the monkey jack
gents our hope is restored
yeah
if any of you so much as thinks the word parley
ill have your guts for garters
will
youve got to stop it
stop it
welcome back miss you took
advantage of our hospitality last time
it holds fair now that
you return the favor
barbossa
will
she goes free
whats in your head boy
she goes free
youve only got one shot
and we cant die
dont do anything stupid
you canti can
like that
who are you
no one hes no one
a distant cousin of my aunts
nephew twice removed
lovely singing voice though
eunuch
my name is will turner
my father was bootstrap bill turner
his blood runs in my veins
hes a spitting image of ol bootstrap
bill come back to haunt us
on my word do as i say or
ill pull this trigger
and be lost to davy jones locker
name your terms mr turner
elizabeth goes free
yes we know that one
anything else
and the crew the crew
are not to be harmed
agreed
go on walk the plank
barbossa you lying bastard
you swore shed go free
dont dare impugn me honor boy
i agreed shed go free it was you who failed
to specify when or where
though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine dont it lads
so ill be having that
dress back before you go
i always liked you
it goes with your black heart
ooh its still warm
off you go
come on
too long
i really had rather hoped
we were past all this
jack jack
did ya not notice
that be the same little island that we made you governor of on our last little trip
i did notice
perhaps youll be able to conjure
up another miraculous escape
but i doubt it
off you go
last time you left me
a pistol with one shot
by the powers youre right were
be jacks pistol bring it forward
seeing as theres two of us a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols
itll be one pistol as before
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady and
starve to death yourself
thats the second time ive had to watch
that man sail away with my ship
but you were marooned on this island before werent you
so we can escape in the same way you did then
to what point and purpose young missy
the black pearl is gone
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice
unlikely young mr turner will be dead
long before you can reach him
but youre captain jack sparrow
you vanished from under the eyes of
7 agents of the east india company
you sacked nassau port
without even firing a shot
are you the pirate
ive read about or not
how did you escape last time
last timei was here a grand
total of three days alright
last time
the rumrunners used this island as a cache
came by and i was able
to barter a passage off
from the looks of things theyve
long been out of business
probably have your bloody friend
norrington to thank for that
so thats it then
thats the secret grand adventure
of the infamous jack sparrow
you spent three days lying
on a beach drinking rum
welcome to the caribbean love
were devils and black sheep
and really bad eggs
drink up me earties yo ho
yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me
i love this song
really bad eggs
when i get the pearl back
im gonna teach it to the whole crew
and well sing it all the time
and youll be positively the most
fearsome pirate in the spanish main
not just the spanish main love
the entire ocean
the entire world
wherever we want to go well go
thats what a ship is you know
its not just a keel and a hull and a deck
and sails thats what a ship needs
but what a ship is
what the black pearl really is
is freedom
jack
it must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island
oh yes
but the company is infinitely
better than last time i think
and the scenery has definitely improved
mr sparrow im not entirely sure that ive
had enough rum
to allow that kind of talk
i know exactly what you mean love
to freedom
to the black pearl
no not good
stop not good
what are you doing you burned
all the food the shade the rum
yes the rum is gone
why is the rum gone
one because it is a vile drink that turns even
the most respectable men into complete scoundrels
two that signal is over a thousand feet high
the entire royal navy is out looking for me
do you really think that there is even the
slightest chance that they wont see it
but why is the rum gone
just wait captain sparrow
you give it one hour maybe two keep
a weather eye open and you will see
white sails on that horizon
mustve been terrible for you to be trapped here jack
mustve been terrible for you
well it bloody is now
therell be no living
with her after this
but weve got to save will
no
youre safe now
we will return to port royal immediately
not go gallivanting after pirates
then we condemn him to death
the boys fate is regrettable
but then so is his decision
to engage in piracy
to rescue me to prevent anything
from happening to me
if i may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion
the pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle
its very unlikely shell be
able to make good time
think about it
the black pearl
the last real pirate threat
in the caribbean mate
how can you pass that up
by remembering that i serve others
mr sparrow not only myself
commodore i beg you please do this
for meas a wedding gift
elizabeth are you accepting
the commodores proposal
i am
a wedding
i love weddings drinks all around
i know clap him in irons right
mr sparrow
you will accompany these fine
men to the helm and provide us
with the bearing to isla de muerta
you will then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase
silent as the grave
do i make myself clear
inescapably clear
shiver me timbers
cotton ere says you missed a bit
you knew william turner
ol bootstrap billwe knew him
never sat well with bootstrap
what we did to jack sparrow
the mutiny and all
he said it wasnt right with the code
thats why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you as it were
he said we deserved to be cursed
and remain cursed
stupid blighter
good man
but as you can imagine
that didnt sit too well
with the captain
that didnt sit too well with the captain
at all tell him what barbossa did
im telling the story
so
what the captain did
he strapped a cannon to
bootstraps bootstraps
the last we saw of ol bill turner
he was sinking to the crushing black
oblivion of davy jones locker
course it was only after that
we learned we needed his
blood to lift the curse
thats what you call ironic
bring him
i dont care for the situation
any attempt to storm the cave
could turn to an ambush
not if youre the one doing the ambushing
i go in to convince barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats
you and your mates return to the dauntless and blast the
bejesus outta them with your little cannons aye
what do you have to lose
nothing id lament being rid of
now to be quite honest with you
theres still a slight risk for those aboard the dauntless
which includes the future mrs commodore
sorry but for your own safety
i dont care what the commodore
ordered i have to tell him
the piratesthey cannot be killed
dont worry miss hes already informed of that
a little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story
this is jack sparrows doing
no reason to fret its just a prick of
the finger and a few drops of blood
no mistakes this time hes only
halfturner we spill it all
guess there is reason to fret
beg your pardon
begun by blood
excuse me
by blood un
jack
its not possible
not probable
wheres elizabeth
shes safe just like i promised
shes all set to marry norrington
just like she promised
and you get to die for her
just like you promised
so were all men of our word really
except for elizabeth who
is in fact a woman
shut up youre next
you dont want to be doing that mate
no i really think i do
your funeral
why dont i want to be doing it
well because
because the hms dauntless
pride of the royal navy
is floating just offshore
waiting for you
what are we doing here
pirates come out
unprepared and unawares
we catch them in the crossfire
send them down to see old hobb
i know why were here
i mean
why arent we doing what it was what
mr sparrow said we should do
with the cannons and all
because it was mr sparrow who said it
you think he wasnt telling the truth
just hear me out mate
you order your men to row out to the
dauntless they do what they do best
roberts your uncle fannies your aunt
there you are with two ships
the makings of your very own fleet
course youll take the grandest as
your flagship and whos to argue
but what of the pearl
name me captain
ill sail under your colors
ill give you ten percent of me plunder
and you get to introduce yourself as
commodore barbossa savvy
i suppose in exchange you want
me not to kill the whelp
no no not at all by all
means kill the whelp
just not yet
wait to lift the curse
until the opportune moment
for instance
after youve killed norringtons men
every last one
youve been planning this
from the beginning
ever since you learned my name
yeah
i want fifty percent of your plunder
15
40
25
and ill buy you the hat
a really big one
commodore
we have an accord
all hands to the boats
apologies you give the orders
gents take a walk
not to the boats
hold fire
this is just like what the
greeks done at troy
except they was in a
horse instead of dresses
wooden horse
a moment please
elizabeth
i just want you to know ii believe you
made a very good decision today
couldnt be more proud of you
but you know even a good decision
if made for the wrong reasons
can be a wrong decision
lieutenant
elizabeth
are you there
elizabeth are you even listening to me
oh what have you done
stop that
i already feel like a fool
you look nice though
i look nice
i must admit jack
i thought i had ye figured
it turns out that youre
a hard man to predict
me im dishonest and a dishonest
man you can always trust to be
dishonest
honestly its the honest
ones you want to watch out for
because you can never predict when theyre
going to do something incredibly
stupid
youre off the edge of the map mate
here there be monsters
roger that
what would you pick to eat first
i think we should decide now
just so were ready
when the time comes
what was that
its elizabeth
make for the ship move
you cant beat me jack
thats interesting
couldnt resist mate
sorry
so what now jack sparrow will
it be two immortals locked in
an epic battle until judgment
day and trumpets sound
or you could surrender
all of you with me will is in that
cave and we must save him
ready and heave
please i need your help come on
any port in the storm
cottons right weve got the pearl
what about jack youre just going to leave him
jack owes us a ship
theres the code to consider
the code
youre pirates hang the
code and hang the rules
theyre more like guidelines anyway
bloody pirates
oy
what
is it supposed to be doing that
theyre stealing our ship
bloody pirates
come on
ah me eye
im gonna teach you
the meaning of pain
you like pain
try wearing a corset
whose side is jack on
at the moment
no fair
ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot
he didnt waste it
i feel
cold
parley
the ship is ours gentlemen
we should return to the dauntless
your fiancé will be wanting
to know youre safe
if you were waiting for the
opportune moment
that was it
now if youll be so kind id be much
obliged if youd drop me off my ship
im sorry jack
they done whats right by them
cant expect more than that
jack sparrow
captain
captain jack sparrow
for your willful commission
of crimes against the crown
said crimes being numerous in
quantity and sinister in nature
the most grievous of these
to be cited herewith
piracy smuggling
this is wrong
commodore norrington is bound
by the law as are we all
impersonating an officer of
the spanish royal navy
impersonating a cleric of
the church of england
sailing under false colors arson
kidnapping looting poaching
brigandage pilfering depravity
depredation and general lawlessness
and for these crimes you have been
sentenced to be on this day
hung by the neck until dead
may god have mercy on your soul
governor swann
commodore
elizabeth
i should have told you every day
from the moment i met you
i love you
marines
cant breathe
elizabeth
move
i thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill conceived escape attempt
but not from you
on our return to port royal
i granted you clemency
and this is how you thank me
by throwing in your lot with him
hes a pirate
and a good man
if all i have achieved here is that
the hangman will earn two pairs
of boots instead of one
so be it
at least my conscience
will be clear
you forget your place turner
its right here
between you and jack
as is mine
elizabeth
lower your weapons
for goodness sake put them down
so this is where your
heart truly lies then
it is
well im actually feeling
rather good about this
i think weve all arrived at
a very special place eh
spiritually ecumenically
grammatically
i want you to know that
i was rooting for you mate
know that
elizabeth
it would never have worked
between us darling
im sorry
will
nice hat
men
this is the day that you will always
remember as the day that you
idiot
he has nowhere to go
but back to the noose
sail ho
whats your plan of action
sir
perhaps on the rare occasion
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy
piracy itself can be
the right course
mr turner
i will accept the consequences
of my actions
this is a beautiful sword
i would expect the man who made
it to show the same care and
devotion in every
aspect of his life
thank you
commodore
what about sparrow
well i think we can afford to give
him one days head start
so this is the path youve chosen is it
after allhe is a blacksmith
no
hes a pirate
i thought you were supposed
to keep to the code
we figured they were more
actualguidelines
thank you
captain sparrow
the black pearl is yours
