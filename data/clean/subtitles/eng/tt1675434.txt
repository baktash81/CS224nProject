unbelievable
youd better believe it
this dude nosebled on a white
board and asks 30 000 euros for it
tell me driss why do you think
people are interested in art
i dont know its a business

hi philippe
how are you doing
you summoned me im here
im listening
whats so important
i didnt summon you
cant you guess
who is this guy
everybodys worried
yvonne told me hes unstable
brutal
he hit a neighbour
philippe you know better than
me you have to be careful
you cant let anybody come
at your place
especially given your condition
in this case
im not quite sure you know
who youre dealing with
go on
i have contacts in the police
hes not al capone but
hes not mother theresa either
hes just out of prison
6 months for robbing a jewelry
if at least he was qualified
but i hear he sucks
be careful you know guy from
the suburbs have no mercy
thats it
thats what i want
no mercy no pity in french
he often hands me the phone
you know why he just forgets
so youre right he doesnt really
feel any empathy for me
but hes tall strong healthy
and not as dumb as you think
so for now given my condition
like you say
i dont give a damn about where
he comes from and what hes done
as you want
thats all you wanted to say
hey magalie
do you have a minute
no not really
i just want to show you
something really fast
what is it
dont freak out youll see
one minute thats it
deal
so
so i have a bathtub

exactly why not
go ahead
start undressing
oh youre gonna play it naughty
i like that
im taking off my clothes
no problem
what
where are you going

we dont even have to use the salts
what are you looking at
im always anxious in the morning
when the mail arrives
as apollinaire once said
quote
im desperate when i dont hear from you
wait

i was at  as apollinaire once said
quote im desperate when i dont hear from you
you might not get it but this
is an intimate time
nope i dont get it

ill shut it down if you explain
theres nothing to explain
hes sending letters
letters
to whom
to women usually
tell me who is it
theres one in particular
eleonore
who is eleonore
ive never seen her
how come
thats how epistolary relationships work
it means they write letters
they only communicate by mail
im not stupid i got it
are those the blue letters
what a seducer
hes epistoling like a boss
what about you
isnt there someone
even albert the gardener
not at all
come on i noticed
he always has a smile for you
am i right
am i right or not
stop it now its ridiculous
so did he get some or what
what are you talking about
did he plant his own cucumber
what
i cant believe you
albert albert

soon trust me
fuck
hello
are you ok
do you need music
stay calm
calm down philippe
philippe
hey philippe
try to relax
breathe slowly
can you hear me
slowly
youre gonna be ok
i need air
air
the fresh air feels great
what time is it
i dont know around 4 am
i havent been out in paris by
this time of the day in a long time
what happened
medication side effect
doctors call these ghost pains
i rather say that im a frozen steak
thrown in a burning pan
i dont feel anything but its still painful
it has to stop there must be
something that will relieve you
yup this could relieve me
well were all a little sick
when it comes to this
i might even be sicker than you
by the way i meant to ask you
about the ladies
can you
how does it work
i have to adapt
but concretely
can you do it or not
i dont know if youre aware but i have
no feelings between my neck and my toes
so you cant
its complicated
i can but im not always
the one to decide when
also theres pleasure to be
found elsewhere
really
you cant imagine
i sure cant
what do you mean
the ears for instance
what about the ears
its a very sensitive
erogenous area
so you get your ears licked
i couldnt have thought about that
philippe
hit that it will help
what is this bullshit
come on it cant get any worse
hit it
come on harder
alright lets share
more
a bit more
enough for tonight
sorry to bring this back but im
really curious about the ear thing
so if you have red ears it means
youre turned on
thats it
sometimes i even wake up with
hard lobes
both of them
i met my wife alice when we were
studying political sciences we were 20
she was tall and elegant
joyful bright eyes
i saw pictures at your place
its the blonde one right
not bad
we had an incredible story together
i wish you the same
god i loved her so much
then she got pregnant once twice
she had five miscarriages
finally the doctors gave a diagnosis
she didnt have much longer
we decided to adopt anyway
sir
please
please
yes
i want
im gonna have a tarte tatin
but cooked all the way
because the chocolate cake had a problem
it was all fluid inside
flowing everywhere it was weird
thats what a micuit is supposed to do sir
thats why
yes
im still gonna have a tarte tatin
i always liked competition
extreme sports speed
going faster higher
i had it all with paragliding
i got high could see everything
and breathe
i was raised with the conviction i was
good enough to pee on the whole world
id like to drink something
my mouth feels dry
thats one of the side effects
when you smoke  weed
what are the other ones
it makes you hungry
and chatty
and then a day of bad weather
a day i shouldnt have gone paragliding
but you did
maybe to to share alices pain
because i knew she wouldnt make it
in the end two broken cervicals
and only my head left to get high
the pain didnt take my mind away
my true disability is not having
to be in a wheel chair
its having to be without her
what do the doctors say
you know with the recent progress
theyre gonna keep me alive until 70
with massages and medication
its expensive
but im a rich tetraplegic
i would shoot myself
well you cant even do that
when youre tetraplegic
oh shit thats right
thats tough man
what day are we today
i dont know the 8th or the 9th
so its official
what
you did it
your trial is over
so im hired
of course youre hired
can i count on you
yeah
good
then give me the faberge egg back
its a gift from alice
she got me one each year we were
together i have 25 of them
theyre really important to me
i dont know what do you
i didnt do it
what kind of egg is that
nina
what are you doing here
hurry up get in the car
put your seatbelt on
how are you
how is school
why dont you answer my texts
i was busy
so tell me who did you talk to on the phone
a cop he wanted to talk to mom
i faked her voice and told him
someone was going to pick him up
did you find my egg
did you find it or not
i dont care about your stupid egg
i didnt find it anyway
what did you tell them
nothing i had nothing to tell them
i only had 30 grams you know the law
they couldnt do anything
they kept me in custody and
eventually had to let me go
do you want to have a sandwich
im not getting in this car
cool it
let me go
shut up whos taking you home
whos taking you home
get lost
its none of your business
get lost
her polished eyes are carved in delicate minerals
and in this strange and symbolic nature
and in this strange
and symbolic
nature
how boring is that
where the pure angel merges
with the antic sphynx
i never know if sphynx takes
a i or a y
im so bored by all this
its a i
do you really have to go through this bullshit
a sphynx daisies angels
would you care for a guy telling you this
of course some use a more basic method
whats next
what does eleonore look like
i dont know i dont care
its intellectual emotional
it comes before the physical
relationship for me
intellectual alright but  what
if she looks like a dog
youd be having an intellectual
relationship with a dog
very elegant
really
what else
bravo
how long has it been going on
hes such a pain in the ass
six months
six months
and youve never seen her
she really might be ugly or fat
or even disabled
you should add that after the poem
by the way how much do you weigh
write it
thanks a lot for your
useful advice driss
lets get back to it
where was i
i think a sphynx was eating daisies
running in the fields doing weird stuff
lets see
strange and symbolic nature
and in this strange and symbolic nature
you have to call her
where the pure angel merges with
the antic sphynx
im telling you
call her
spot it driss
im better at written communication
unbelievable
alright but im gonna look for her
phone number it stresses me out
hey

i might be naive but i still hope
i have something more than my bank account
she spent 6 months reading your goddamn
poems and she likes it
shes weird dont worry
im sure she doesnt give a damn
about the chair
thats true
plus guys from the north drink so much
theyre all beating their ladies
shell see theres no risk with you
jerk
thats good thinking though right
yeah whatever
the photo is a good test
if she sends hers back its a good sign
you can send a picture of you
with the chair but not too obvious
you dont have to send a telethonlike picture
drooling and all
looking like shit
alright alright

shush yourself
hes a tree
a singing tree
in german
stop shushing me
its in german anyway

since you cant really do anything
besides driving your chair over her
driss dont you think youre exaggerating
yvonne
yvonne
well
she might need a light admonition
a light one
shes 16 dressing and painting
her face outrageously
shes also making out with the
annoying dude all over the house
but thats none of my business
its her education
what i have a problem with is
how she despises everyone
how she talks to me to you
what are we slaves
so if you let me ill give her
a lesson right now
alright i get it let me take care of it
then take care of it
fast
im gonna break something
hes painting  what is he painting

so that i can finally see her face
the boy looks like you
adama
yes
i saw him earlier
i think if i had crossed him in the street
i could have told he was your brother
thats weird
why
because hes not my brother
really
its complicated
is he your brother or not
ok i get it
lets go
my parents
theyre not really my parents
theyre my uncle and my aunt
they came to get me in senegal
when i was 8
they couldnt have children so they
went to see a brother who had a load of them
they took the elder
me
i was called bakary
thats my real name
but there were several bakarys in the
neighbourhood so they called me idriss
somehow it turned into driss
then what
then out of nowhere my mother
i mean my aunt
she got pregnant twice
then my uncle died
and then there were other guys
other children
i told you its complicated
about adama dont you think he
needs a light admonition
he came to get you didnt he
driss
i think its the end of the road
you werent going to push a disableds
chair your whole life anyway
and since you worked well youll
get unemployment again
enough
