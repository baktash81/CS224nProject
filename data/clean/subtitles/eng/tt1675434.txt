  you d better believe it 
this dude nosebled on a white
board and asks 30 000 euros for it 
tell me driss  why do you think
people are interested in art 
  i don t know  it s a business

i ll take it 
really 
hi  philippe 
how are you doing 
you summoned me  i m here 
i m listening 
what s so important 
i didn t  summon  you   
can t you guess 
who is this guy 
everybody s worried 
yvonne told me he s unstable 
brutal 
he hit a neighbour 
philippe  you know better than
me you have to be careful 
you can t let anybody come
at your place 
especially given your condition   
in this case   
i m not quite sure you know
who you re dealing with 
go on   
i have contacts in the police 
he s not al capone  but   
he s not mother theresa either 
he s just out of prison 
6 months for robbing a jewelry 
if at least he was qualified   
but i hear he sucks 
be careful  you know guy from
the suburbs have no mercy 
that s it 
that s what i want 
no mercy    no pity in french 
he often hands me the phone 
you know why  he just forgets 
so you re right  he doesn t really
feel any empathy for me 
but he s tall  strong  healthy 
and not as dumb as you think 
so for now  given my  condition 
like you say   
i don t give a damn about where
he comes from and what he s done 
as you want 
that s all you wanted to say 
hey  magalie 
  do you have a minute 
  no  not really 
i just want to show you
something really fast 
  what is it 
  don t freak out  you ll see 
  one minute  that s it 
  deal 
  so 
  so i have a bathtub 
see 
  really fascinating   
  yeah 
  so what 
  i was thinking   
we could take a bath 
it s big  there s enough room 
i have bath salts  shower gel   
alright 
why not  after all 
exactly  why not 
go ahead 
  start undressing 
  oh you re gonna play it naughty 
i like that 
i m taking off my clothes 
no problem 
what 
where are you going 
you agreed 
we don t even have to use the salts 
what are you looking at 
i m always anxious in the morning 
when the mail arrives 
as apollinaire once said   
quote   
 i m desperate when i don t hear from you   
wait 
i m lost  you re going too fast 
i was at    as apollinaire once said     
quote  i m desperate when i don t hear from you   
you might not get it  but this
is an intimate time 
  nope  i don t get it 
  give it back 
i ll shut it down if you explain 
there s nothing to explain 
he s sending letters 
letters 
  to whom 
  to women  usually 
tell me  who is it 
there s one in particular 
eleonore 
who is eleonore 
i ve never seen her 
how come 
that s how epistolary relationships work 
it means they write letters
they only communicate by mail 
i m not stupid  i got it 
are those the blue letters 
what a seducer 
he s  epistoling  like a boss
what about you 
isn t there someone 
even albert  the gardener 
  not at all 
  come on  i noticed 
he always has a smile for you 
am i right 
  am i right or not 
  stop it now  it s ridiculous 
  so did he get some or what 
  what are you talking about 
  did he plant his own cucumber 
what 
  i can t believe you   
  albert  albert   
  soon 
  no 
soon  trust me 
fuck 
hello   
are you ok 
do you need music 
stay calm 
calm down  philippe 
philippe 
hey  philippe 
try to relax 
breathe slowly 
can you hear me 
slowly 
you re gonna be ok 
i need air 
air 
the fresh air feels great 
  what time is it 
  i don t know  around 4 am 
i haven t been out in paris by
this time of the day in a long time 
what happened 
medication side effect 
doctors call these  ghost pains  
i rather say that i m a frozen steak
thrown in a burning pan 
i don t feel anything  but it s still painful 
it has to stop  there must be
something that will relieve you 
yup  this could relieve me 
well  we re all a little sick
when it comes to this   
i might even be sicker than you 
by the way  i meant to ask you 
about the ladies   
can you    
how does it work 
i have to adapt 
but concretely   
can you do it or not 
i don t know if you re aware  but i have 
no feelings between my neck and my toes 
so you can t 
it s complicated 
i can  but i m not always
the one to decide when 
also  there s pleasure to be
found elsewhere 
really 
you can t imagine 
i sure can t 
what do you mean 
the ears  for instance 
what about the ears 
it s a very sensitive 
erogenous area 
so you get your ears licked 
i couldn t have thought about that 
philippe 
  hit that  it will help 
  what is this bullshit 
come on  it can t get any worse 
hit it 
come on  harder 
alright  let s share 
more 
  a bit more 
  enough for tonight 
sorry to bring this back  but i m
really curious about the ear thing 
so if you have red ears  it means
you re turned on 
that s it 
sometimes i even wake up with
hard lobes 
both of them 
i met my wife alice when we were
studying political sciences  we were 20 
she was tall and elegant 
joyful bright eyes 
i saw pictures at your place 
it s the blonde one  right 
not bad 
we had an incredible story together 
i wish you the same 
god i loved her so much 
then she got pregnant once  twice   
she had five miscarriages 
finally the doctors gave a diagnosis 
she didn t have much longer 
we decided to adopt anyway 
sir 
please 
please 
yes 
i want   
i m gonna have a tarte tatin 
but cooked all the way 
because the chocolate cake had a problem 
it was all fluid inside   
flowing everywhere  it was weird 
that s what a  mi cuit  is supposed to do  sir 
  that s why 
  yes 
i m still gonna have a tarte tatin 
i always liked competition 
extreme sports  speed   
going faster  higher   
i had it all with paragliding 
i got high  could see everything 
and breathe 
i was raised with the conviction i was 
good enough to pee on the whole world 
i d like to drink something 
my mouth feels dry 
that s one of the side effects
when you smoke  weed  
  what are the other ones 
  it makes you hungry   
and chatty 
and then a day of bad weather 
a day i shouldn t have gone paragliding 
but you did 
maybe to to share alice s pain 
because i knew she wouldn t make it 
in the end  two broken cervicals 
and only my head left to get high 
the pain didn t take my mind away 
my true disability is not having
to be in a wheel chair 
it s having to be without her 
what do the doctors say 
you know  with the recent progress 
they re gonna keep me alive until 70 
with massages and medication 
it s expensive    
but i m a rich tetraplegic 
i would shoot myself 
well  you can t even do that
when you re tetraplegic 
oh shit  that s right 
that s tough  man 
what day are we today 
i don t know  the 8th or the 9th   
so it s official 
  what 
  you did it 
your trial is over 
  so i m hired 
  of course you re hired 
  can i count on you 
  yeah 
good 
then give me the  faberge  egg back 
it s a gift from alice 
she got me one each year we were
together  i have 25 of them 
they re really important to me 
i don t know  what do you   
i didn t do it 
what kind of egg is that 
nina 
  what are you doing here 
  hurry up  get in the car 
put your seatbelt on 
how are you 
how is school 
why don t you answer my texts 
i was busy 
so tell me  who did you talk to on the phone 
a cop  he wanted to talk to mom 
i faked her voice and told him
someone was going to pick him up 
did you find my egg 
did you find it or not 
i don t care about your stupid egg 
i didn t find it anyway 
what did you tell them 
nothing  i had nothing to tell them 
i only had 30 grams  you know the law 
they couldn t do anything 
they kept me in custody and
eventually had to let me go 
do you want to have a sandwich 
  i m not getting in this car 
  cool it 
  let me go 
  shut up  who s taking you home 
  who s taking you home 
  get lost 
  it s none of your business 
  get lost 
her polished eyes are carved in delicate minerals 
and in this strange and symbolic nature   
 and in this strange 
 and symbolic 
   nature 
  how boring is that 
 where the pure angel merges
with the antic sphynx 
i never know if  sphynx  takes
a  i  or a  y  
i m so bored by all this 
it s a  i  
do you really have to go through this bullshit 
a sphynx  daisies  angels   
would you care for a guy telling you this 
of course  some use a more basic method 
what s next 
what does eleonore look like 
i don t know  i don t care 
it s intellectual  emotional 
it comes before the physical
relationship for me 
intellectual alright  but  what
if she looks like a dog 
you d be having an intellectual
relationship with a dog 
very elegant 
really 
what else 
bravo 
how long has it been going on 
he s such a pain in the ass 
six months 
six months 
and you ve never seen her 
she really might be ugly  or fat 
or even disabled 
you should add that after the poem  
 by the way  how much do you weigh   
write it 
thanks a lot for your
useful advice  driss 
let s get back to it 
where was i 
i think a sphynx was eating daisies 
running in the fields  doing weird stuff 
let s see   
 strange and symbolic nature 
and in this strange and symbolic nature   
you have to call her 
  where the pure angel merges with
the antic sphynx   
i m telling you 
call her 
spot it  driss 
i m better at written communication 
unbelievable 
alright  but i m gonna look for her
phone number  it stresses me out 
hey 
she s from the north    that s not good 
leave this envelope 
never has a  miss france  come from the north 
they usually look like crap over there 
give the envelope back now 
she wrote her phone number  god damn it 
it s a sign  she wants you to call her 
please  let it go 
she wrote her phone number  philippe 
what do you think  it means  call me  
 i want to lick your ear lobe  
  of course  philippe 
  you re not calling her  are you 
she doesn t give a shit about poetry 
six fucking months of poetry   
he s bonkers 
  call me  i want you   
  i won t talk to her 
  i m gonna check if she has a weird accent 
northern accent sucks  
put down the phone 
  she wants a piece of philippe 
  she s gonna have some 
hello 
nice voice  for a start 
hello   
  no 
  no 
  hello   
  improvise  talk about daisies and shit   
  eleonore 
  it s philippe 
well i   
i m calling you because i really
wanted to hear your voice 
and so far  your  hello  already
fills me with joy 
hold on  i m gonna get her 
stop with you complicated sentences 
  hello 
  eleonore  it s philippe 
philippe 
igen szerettem volna írni
egy levelet  aztán   
i was writing you a letter 
and i thought  why not simply call her 
don t forget to ask about her weight 
  pardon me 
  nothing 
i m grieving 
i want to cry 
i m afraid 
lord give me peace   
exactly  that s it 
i can t corner you 
  how great that you love  rimbaud  
  sorry 
  i was first in line 
  eleonore 
i m glad 
yes  i am 
  what a big mouth    he can t be stopped 
  i m sending you kisses 
everyone kisses  licking ears and all 
good   so what s up 
there s good news and less good news 
  what about the good part 
  116 lbs 
  116 lbs   that s really good 
unless she s three feet tall 
on the other hand   
she wants a picture 
  so 
  come on 
good evening 
can i see your tickets 
  good evening 
  it s over here 
  perfect 
  have a good night 
  good night to you 
  we ll be just here if you re looking for us   
we re not going to move 
especially him 
wait   
what do you think women want 
i don t know 
a cute  charming  elegant man   
no kidding 
they want money  security 
ask this dude 
and you have all that 
i might be naive  but i still hope
i have something more than my bank account  
she spent 6 months reading your goddamn
poems  and she likes it 
she s weird  don t worry 
i m sure she doesn t give a damn
about the chair 
that s true 
plus guys from the north drink so much
they re all beating their ladies 
she ll see there s no risk with you 
jerk 
that s good thinking though  right 
yeah  whatever 
the photo is a good test 
if she sends hers back it s a good sign 
you can send a picture of you
with the chair  but not too obvious 
you don t have to send a telethon like picture   
drooling and all   
looking like shit 
alright  alright 
he has a problem 
a big one 
shush yourself 
he s a tree   
a singing tree 
in german 
stop shushing me 
it s in german anyway 
as if it wasn t enough 
you re crazy 
oh man 
  how long does it last 
  four hours 
fuck 
you looked damn fine in the old times 
which one 
this one 
there s also this one   
i like it a lot 
the chair is not obvious 
but you can see something is going on 
and you look really good 
  are we doing this 
  i don t know 
didn t you have a blast on the phone 
i did 
is that all 
  i had a fucking blast 
  so 
so we re sending this goddamn picture 
that s what i m talking about 
let s do it 
give me a cigarette 
don t you ever knock 
are you painting 
  yes  get out 
  you re kidding me 
ha ha  painting  did you learn how to
read as well 
i told you to get out of here 
or what  you ll beat me  is that
how women are treated in your country 
you re out of your mind 
fuck off 
  i ll leave when i want 
  right 
  see  i m deciding to leave now 
  leave 
god damn it 
replace this picture with 
the other one 
please post it yourself 
and be discreet 
as you want 
now throw the other picture in the thrash 
i m loosing it 
she s driving me crazy 
  what s wrong 
  your daughter is 
  i was painting   
  you were    what 
yes  whatever  i wanted to tell you   
she needs to cool it   
otherwise i will slap her 
  alright  cool it a little 
  no  i m not cooling anything 
am i not your arms and your legs 
yes 
well i want to be your hands too 
so she can get what she deserves 
since you can t really do anything
besides driving your chair over her 
driss  don t you think you re exaggerating 
yvonne 
yvonne   
well   
she might need a light admonition 
a light one 
she s 16  dressing and painting
her face outrageously 
she s also making out with the
annoying dude all over the house 
but that s none of my business 
it s her education 
what i have a problem with is
how she despises everyone 
how she talks to me  to you 
what are we  slaves 
so if you let me  i ll give her
a lesson right now 
alright  i get it  let me take care of it 
then take care of it 
fast 
i m gonna break something   
he s painting   what is he painting 
i have no idea 
get up  philippe 
fits you like a charm 
right 
you need to respect the people working for me 
it s unacceptable  do you understand 
i think she doesn t  toughen up 
by the way i don t want to see this
dude here anymore 
  god i get it  leave me alone 
  i won t leave you alone 
do i need to drive my chair
over you to make you obey me 
that s it  we re getting there 
  you did that 
  yeah 
i love it 
i m not saying i would hang it
at my place   
but it s   
how much do you think we ll get from it 
we ll see 
we ll see more or less 
it s   
  what the hell 
  what 
  i wasn t gonna use the tongue 
  you re retarded 
can t you go faster 
i can t run in these conditions 
  i m at the maximum 
  the maximum    it s way too slow 
i can do 9 miles per hour

i imagine her getting up   
and turning around   
so that i can finally see her face 
the boy looks like you 
  adama 
  yes 
i saw him earlier 
i think if i had crossed him in the street 
i could have told he was your brother 
that s weird 
why 
because he s not my brother 
really 
it s complicated 
is he your brother or not 
ok  i get it 
let s go 
my parents   
they re not really my parents 
they re my uncle and my aunt 
they came to get me in senegal
when i was 8 
they couldn t have children  so they 
went to see a brother who had a load of them 
they took the elder 
me 
i was called bakary 
that s my real name 
but there were several bakarys in the 
neighbourhood so they called me idriss    
somehow it turned into driss 
then what 
then out of nowhere my mother   
i mean my aunt   
she got pregnant twice 
then my uncle died 
and then there were other guys 
other children 
i told you it s complicated 
about adama  don t you think he
needs a light admonition 
he came to get you  didn t he 
driss 
i think it s the end of the road 
you weren t going to push a disabled s 
chair your whole life anyway 
and since you worked well  you ll
get unemployment again 
enough 
let s go 
come on 
yeah
