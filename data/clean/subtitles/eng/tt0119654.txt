thats just very funny to me
yall aint laughing though
okay lets get going

edwards what happened

may i ask why you felt
little tiffany deserved to die
she was the only one
that seemed dangerous
howd you figure that
i was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the light
but hes just working out
howd i feel if somebody bust
my ass while im on the treadmill
then i saw this snarling beast
i noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized
hes not snarling
hes sneezing
aint no threat there
then i saw tiffany
8yearold white girl
middle of the ghetto
bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books
she about to start some shit
those books are
way too advanced for her
if you ask me shes up to something
id appreciate it if you
eased up about it
or do i owe her an apology
good shot though right
he has a problem with authority
so do i
but this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot boss
thats gotta be tough enough
lets hope you know what youre doing
gentlemen congratulations
youre everything we expect
from years of government training
if youll just follow me
we have one more test to administer
an eye exam
where are you going
what the hell is all this
in the 1950s the government
started an underfunded agency
with the laughable purpose
of establishing contact
with a race not of this planet
look at the end of this device
everyone thought the agency
was a joke except the aliens
who made contact on march 2 1961
outside new york
there were nine of us the first night
seven agents one astronomer
and a dumb kid whod gotten lost
you brought that tall man some flowers
this way
they were a group
of intergalactic refugees
wanted earth as an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet
you ever see casablanca
same thing except no nazis
we agreed and concealed
all evidence of their landing
so these are real flying saucers
and the worlds fair was a coverup
why hold it in queens
more nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret
not to change the subject but when
was the last time you got a cat scan
six months ago its company policy
make another appointment
tell your boy zed i had
an absolutely wonderful time
and thank you for everything
but show me the door
all right im getting some coffee
you want some
no thank you im fine
how you doing
hi kay
thats not decaf is it
viennese cinnamon
dont tell me we only got powdered
stuff for cream i hate it
well thats good good good
you guys getting along all right
dont work too hard
sure you dont want some coffee
heres the deal
at any given time there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet
most of them here in manhattan
most of them are decent
just trying to make a living
cab drivers
not as many as youd think
humans for the most part
dont have a clue dont want one
theyre happy they think
they have a good bead on things
people are smart
they can handle it
a person is smart
people are dumb panicky
dangerous animals and you know it
1500 years ago everybody knew
the earth was
the centre of the universe
500 years ago everybody knew
the earth was flat
and 15 minutes ago you knew that
people were alone on this planet
imagine what youll know
tomorrow
whats the catch
the catch
the catch is you will sever
all human contact
nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere
ever
ill give you to sunrise
to think it over
is it worth it
yeah its worth it
if youre strong enough
whats up pops
im in
because theres some
nextlevel shit going on here
before yall beam me up
theres a few things to understand
first off you chose me
so you recognize the skills
i dont want nobody calling me
son or kid or sport cool
cool whatever slick
but i need to tell you something
about all your skills
as of right now
they mean precisely
as of right now
they mean precisely
dick

took a police report and writ down
everything i said
not believing one thing i said
sort of poking fun at me
he asked me  if he was murdered
how was he able to walk
back in the house
i gotta admit to you that
that one got me stumped
i tell you i know edgar
and that wasnt edgar
it was like something was
wearing edgar
like a suit
an edgar suit
dude was that ugly
before he was an alien
im sorry
go on
anyway
i come to and hes gone
he say anything
yes he asked me for some water
some sugar water
sugar water
i remember that right
i thought that that was odd
that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water
or regular water
tap water
all right beatrice
there was no alien
the flash of light was not a ufo
gas was trapped in a thermal pocket
and refracted the light from venus
wait a minute
that thing erases her memory
and you just make up a new one
a standardissue neuralizer
that weakass story is
the best you came up with
all right on a more personal note
edgar ran off with an old girlfriend
youll stay with your mama
and decide youre better off
yeah because he never
appreciated you anyway
in fact you know what
you kicked him out
and now that hes gone
youll go in town
find yourself some nice dresses
get yourself some shoes
find somewhere you could get a facial
and hire a decorator to come
in here quick because damn
when do i get my own flashy
memory messerupper
when you grow up

a green spectral trail
and craves sugar water
that was on jeopardy last night

bugs thrive on carnage tiger
they consume infest destroy
live off the death of other species
you were stung as a child right
