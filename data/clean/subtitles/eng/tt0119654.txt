your boy  captain america  here

of the best  sir  
 with honours  
he s just really excited   
   and has no clue why we re here 
that s just very funny to me 
y all ain t laughing  though 
okay  let s get going 
wanna get down on this 
edwards  what happened 
hesitated 
may i ask why you felt
little tiffany deserved to die 
she was the only one
that seemed dangerous 
how d you figure that 
i was gonna pop this guy
hanging from the light   
   but he s just working out 
how d i feel if somebody bust
my ass while i m on the treadmill 
then i saw this snarling beast 
i noticed he had a tissue
in his hand and realized   
   he s not snarling 
he s sneezing 
ain t no threat there 
then i saw tiffany 
8 year old white girl 
middle of the ghetto   
   bunch of monsters at night
with quantum physics books 
she about to start some shit 
those books are
way too advanced for her 
if you ask me  she s up to something 
i d appreciate it if you
eased up about it 
or do i owe her an apology 
good shot  though  right 
he has a problem with authority 
so do i 
but this kid ran down
a cephalopoid on foot  boss 
that s gotta be tough enough 
let s hope you know what you re doing 
gentlemen  congratulations 
you re everything we expect
from years of government training 
if you ll just follow me 
we have one more test to administer 
an eye exam 
where are you going 
what the hell is all this 
in the 1950s  the government
started an underfunded agency   
   with the laughable purpose
of establishing contact   
   with a race not of this planet 
look at the end of this device 
everyone thought the agency
was a joke  except the aliens   
   who made contact on march 2  1961
outside new york 
there were nine of us the first night 
seven agents  one astronomer   
   and a dumb kid who d gotten lost 
you brought that tall man some flowers 
this way 
they were a group
of intergalactic refugees 
wanted earth as an apolitical zone
for creatures without a planet 
you ever see casablanca 
same thing  except no nazis 
we agreed and concealed
all evidence of their landing 
so these are real flying saucers
and the world s fair was a cover up 
why hold it in queens 
more nonhumans arrive every year
and live among us in secret 
not to change the subject  but when
was the last time you got a cat scan 
  six months ago  it s company policy 
  make another appointment 
tell your boy zed i had
an absolutely wonderful time   
   and thank you for everything 
but show me the door 
all right  i m getting some coffee 
you want some 
no  thank you  i m fine 
how you doing 
hi  kay 
  that s not decaf  is it 
  viennese cinnamon 
don t tell me we only got powdered
stuff for cream  i hate it 
well  that s good  good  good 
you guys getting along all right 
don t work too hard 
sure you don t want some coffee 
here s the deal 
at any given time  there are
around 1500 aliens on the planet 
most of them here in manhattan 
most of them are decent 
just trying to make a living 
  cab drivers 
  not as many as you d think 
humans  for the most part 
don t have a clue  don t want one 
they re happy  they think
they have a good bead on things 
people are smart 
they can handle it 
a person is smart 
people are dumb  panicky 
dangerous animals  and you know it 
1500 years ago  everybody knew
the earth was   
   the centre of the universe 
500 years ago  everybody knew
the earth was flat 
and 15 minutes ago  you knew that
people were alone on this planet 
imagine what you ll know   
   tomorrow 
  what s the catch 
  the catch 
the catch is  you will sever
all human contact 
nobody will ever know
you exist anywhere   
   ever 
i ll give you to sunrise
to think it over 
is it worth it 
yeah  it s worth it 
if you re strong enough 
what s up  pops 
i m in   
   because there s some
next level shit going on here 
before y all beam me up 
there s a few things to understand 
first off  you chose me 
so you recognize the skills 
i don t want nobody calling me
 son  or  kid  or  sport   cool 
cool  whatever  slick 
but i need to tell you something
about all your skills 
as of right now 
they mean precisely   
as of right now 
they mean precisely   
   dick 
  purpose of trip 
  diplomatic mission 
duration of stay 
lunch 
any fruits or vegetables 
you wanna stay away from that guy 
he s grouchy 
three hours in customs
after a 17 trillion mile trip   
   will make anyone cranky 
what government branch
do we report to 
  none  they ask too many questions 
  who pays for this 
we hold patents on a few gadgets we
confiscated from out of state visitors 
velcro  microwave ovens  liposuction 
this is a fascinating gadget 
it ll replace cds soon  i ll have to
buy the white album again 
that s fun  a universal translator 
we re not even supposed to have it 
human thought is so primitive 
it s looked upon   
   as an infectious disease
in some galaxies 
that kind of makes you proud 
what s this 
just be calm 
relax 
watch your head 
someone get him some ice 
look out  move  just move
when it s coming at you 
damn 
i ll pay for that 
this thing caused
the 1977 new york blackout 
practical joke

observation 
the heart of our endeavour 
meet the twins  blblup and bob 
this map shows the location
of every alien on earth 
some are under constant surveillance 
everyone on those screens is an alien 
in public  they re as normal

you ll get the idea 
oh  man 
doesn t make any sense  right

from now on   
   you ll have no identifying
marks of any kind 
you will not stand out in any way 
your entire image is crafted   
   to leave no lasting memory
with anyone you meet 
you are a rumour 
recognizable only as   
   déjà vu and dismissed
just as quickly 
you don t exist 
you were never born 
anonymity is your name 
silence  your native tongue 
you re no longer part of the system 
you are above the system  over it 
beyond it

between you and me

  lemonade 
oh  yes  please 
the chief of police came
to the house   
   and did an investigation 
took a police report and writ down
everything i said   
   not believing one thing i said 
sort of poking fun at me 
he asked me    if he was murdered   
   how was he able to walk
back in the house  
i gotta admit to you that
that one got me stumped 
i tell you  i know edgar 
and that wasn t edgar 
it was like something was
wearing edgar 
like a suit   
   an edgar suit 
dude was that ugly
before he was an alien 
i m sorry 
go on 
anyway   
   i come to and he s gone 
he say anything 
yes  he asked me for some water 
some sugar water 
sugar water 
i remember that right 
i thought that that was odd   
   that he asked me for sugar water
and not lemonade or ice water   
   or regular water   
   tap water 
all right  beatrice 
there was no alien 
the flash of light was not a u f o 
gas was trapped in a thermal pocket
and refracted the light from venus 
wait a minute 
that thing erases her memory 
and you just make up a new one 
a standard issue neuralizer 
that weak ass story is
the best you came up with 
all right  on a more personal note   
   edgar ran off with an old girlfriend 
you ll stay with your mama   
   and decide you re better off 
yeah  because he never
appreciated you anyway 
in fact  you know what 
you kicked him out 
and now that he s gone   
   you ll go in town 
find yourself some nice dresses 
get yourself some shoes 
find somewhere you could get a facial 
and hire a decorator to come
in here quick because    damn 
when do i get my own flashy   
   memory messer upper 
when you grow up 
please  not green 
oh  damn

a green spectral trail   
   and craves sugar water 
that was on jeopardy last night 
damn  alex said it was   
zed  we have a bug 
so   
what  we don t like bugs 
bugs thrive on carnage  tiger 
they consume  infest  destroy 
live off the death of other species 
you were stung as a child  right 
lmagine a giant cockroach
with unlimited strength   
   a massive inferiority complex 
and a real short temper   
   is terrorizing manhattan island
in a new edgar suit 
that sound like fun 
what s the move 
with a bug in town 
we ll watch the morgues 
where do you want
contestant number 3 
just leave it there 
what s with the cat

the first body was normal

push it aside 
notice anything strange 
stomach  liver  lungs   
nope  all fine 
they re all missing 
of course 
that s obviously
the first thing i noticed 
what i was pointing out
is the fact that there are no   
   pieces   
   of them left 
you know  so they re intact   
   wherever they are whole 
that we can be sure of 
have we met before 
i m having a feeling of déjá vu 
  yeah  me too 
  really 
wanna know what i think 
don t tell him 
he s under enough stress 
i don t think it s a real body 
i think it s some kind of
transport unit for something else 
the question is  what 
is this freaking you out 
no  girl 
you know what i like to do sometimes
when it s late 
dr  white 
excuse me 
what do you think 
interesting  she got
a  queen of the undead  thing going
