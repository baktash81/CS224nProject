and we ve got a good one 
my friends 
top of the ninth here at chukchansi
park  and a beautiful night 
we can actually feel
that fall is finally an its way 
it s a rather crisp 107 degrees  but dry 
we ve got 15 000 sweaty and bloated
people all pumped up on churros   
rooting on our fresno grizzlies 
and brad  this is why i love
announcing minor league baseball   
because i get to say names
like  river cats    
or the  rancho cucamonga quakes  
i don t have to ever say boring names
like  tigers   or  red sox   or  cubs  
okay  we got a little
break in the action   
as they re having
a little meeting on the mound 
artie  do you know what time it is 
i sure do  brad 
it s time for artie s kiss cam 
thank you  gwen 
let s see what kind of young lovers
we got at the ballpark tonight 
all right  there s a kiss 
well  you know one thing when you see
a kiss like that  they re married 
wait  wait  we ve got a proposal 
 will you marry me  clara  love  nate  
there s our young romeo now 
and he has scored 
brad  that is what
you young people would call a  hottie  
he s got britney spears
and he s about to give her the ring   
and he goes the other way 
i can t believe what i am seeing   
and i m sure she s
got a great  personality   but  oh my 
i thought jerry garcia was dead 
what s he doing
in the stands marrying him 
here at chukchansi park 
love is blind  and apparently so is nate 
all right  let s get back to the action
as the meeting breaks up on the mound 
here s the situation 
first and third  two outs 
and here s the pitch 
swing and a miss  diaz fires down to third 
they ve picked him off third 
  you re out 
  ballgame aver 
i ll tell you  myers is
getting an earful   
and as my mom used to say 
 there s no cure for dumb  
gwen  we won 
and that closes out
the last game of the season 
the grizzlies take
the sacramento river cats   
by a score of three to one 
we ll be right back with a happy recap 
that is a bad way to end a game 
artie  mr  decker

look  artie  i know you re upset
about getting kicked in your career   
but we need to focus  buddy 
our grandchildren are going to love me 
  what about me 
  that s your problem 
welcome 
  new people 
  hello 
these are my parents 
they re going to watch the kids this week 
welcome to healthy tiger 
all healthy pan asian food 
what s that 
no msg  no gluten  no sodium 
just healthy food 
i m drooling already 
pan asian  just like me 
my mother s japanese 
my father s chinese   
my kids are korean
and they go to hebrew day school 
oy vey
come on  yeah 
how do you ruin chinese food 
okay 
we seem to have an empty chair 
no  no  that chair is for carl 
  who s carl 
  barker s friend 
how nice  when s he coming 
he s already here 
hi  carl  you look great 
did you get a haircut 
tell him 
carl is barker s imaginary friend 
he s a kangaroo 
maybe we should have eaten
at the outback 
kids  go wash your hands 
come on  carl 
bye  farty 
he s in a real
 testing the boundaries  phase 
plus  he s also a little constipated 
now  you re talking my language 
i have some stuff that will blow his mind 
they used it to blast out the chunnel 
thank you  lord arthur 
now  do you have any
special instructions for us 
like  what the kids like to do 
what they like to eat 
yes  mom  great  thank you 
first of all  they don t eat any sugar 
no carvel 
that s the saddest thing
i ve ever heard in my life 
we have tried to introduce
just a little bit of sugar   
and it was like going off the rails
of the crazy train 
my gosh 
and there s another subject
i d like to discuss 
sure  anything 
your language 
he won t curse  i ll
break his freaking arm 
that s great  but that s not what i meant 
you see  there s a way
that we talk to our kids 
for instance  where you would say  no    
we would say 
 consider the consequences  
or where you would say   don t    
we would say   maybe you should try this  
or where you would say   
 quit your whining 
you re giving me a headache    
we would say   use your words  
you see  that way  the child feels
that he has value  he has worth 
he is heard 
it s a way 
let s order 
great 
that s very good  but if you stay
inside the lines  it looks better 
here  look at mine  see 
dad  we don t really worry about lines 
honey  draw whatever
your imagination tells you 
but what s the point
of having lines if you re just going to    
artie 
that s beautiful 
that s absolutely beautiful 
it s very avant garde 
  picasso 
  exactly 
you didn t finish your dinner 
you know the great thing about chinese   
i mean  pan asian food 
is that if you mush it all up it s   
what happened 
  what did you do 
  i don t know

this was my favorite time of the day 
right after school 
why  what did you do 
we used to go to my friend heidi s house   
put on her mother s clothes 
blast music and smoke 
mom 
don t smoke  don t smoke 
oh  lulu  that was so great 
honey  you re really
starting to take control   
and literally holding the reins 
okay  turner   
would you like to share 
good work  turner 
awesome 
super job  lulu  see you next week 
thank you 
that was really awesome 
i take it you re turner s grandfather 
hi 
i m artie decker 
cassandra 
you seem to be having some trouble
embracing our program  am i right 
well  let me say first 
that i have professional experience
in this area 
oh  wonderful 
where did you receive your degree 
oh  no degree  no 
i speak for a living 
i m a baseball announcer 
little different than a phd
in speech therapy from yale  right 
right  yeah 
that s a point well taken 
but on the other hand 
i sat here for almost an hour   
and i saw these kids
do everything but speak 
so  are you training them to be mimes 
because a lot of those jobs
are being shipped overseas 
 i m walking  but there s wind 
 but there s no wind   you know 
okay  i am employing
the houghton method 
now these kids  they re under
too much pressure to speak   
so we make it very clear that in
here  they need not say a word 
they re currently in a movement phase 
yeah  i saw that 
they re moving everything but their lips 
and he wears these ear buds all the time 
what s that about 
he is listening to the words
that he has trouble with   
and then when
he s comfortable  he can repeat them 
and it s helping him a lot 
how can you tell 
listen  i haven t seen the kid in a year   
and frankly  i don t see
any improvement at all 
what i see is my grandson is now flight 38
from salt lake 
hey  turner 
cassandra s just telling me
how great you re doing 
she sees so much improvement  it s great 
sometimes i shouldn t move my lips 
i m sorry 
that s not bad 
 not bad  
she looks like a 12 year old widow 
  i do 
  you do 
but that s perfect
for a classical music program 
well  what about this 
this is perfect for someone
with a cute little hiney 
i love it 
mom  it s for a concert 
not to meet the fleet 
hey  it s an audition 
and all auditions are alike 
 get their attention  
you sell the sizzle  not the steak 
that s how i got all
those weather girl jobs 
so  are you a trained meteorologist 
trained 
oh  honey  i had a tight
dress and a pointer 
i used to sing my forecasts 
as a matter of fact  sometimes your mom
used to sing them with me on tv 
mom  you never even told me that 
i mentioned it 
remember our winter song 
that was our best one 
no  i don t remember that one 
sure you do 
we sang it 1 000 times 
i love you  come on  please 
no one s watching 
only for you 
ready 
button up your overcoat
in the wintry breeze
take good care of yourself
 cause it s nine degrees 
good job  mom 
do the spin 
okay 
i ll never shop at bloomingdale s again 
you still got it  kiddo 
that was great 
all right  now   
you ve got to try this on 
i m dying to see this on you 
  okay 
  okay 
mom  she cannot wear
a cocktail dress to the audition 
i d like to feel that
you re listening to me 
oh  i m sorry  honey 
did you say something 
no  no 
look at this  this is a hot little number 
oh  not for her  for me 
cue the band 
hey  what are you doing 
guarding the door 
can i go in 
not today  sir 
is he crying 
he doesn t cry  he makes the face 
i didn t mean to upset him 
you should ve used your exit shoes 
my what 
exit shoes  to walk away
and not use a red voice 
and a red voice is    
super mad sounding 
you shouldn t use it  never 
that s why you have a cool toolbox 
it s where you keep your cool blue voice 
your exit shoes and your repair squares 
where did you learn all this 
preschool 
you mean  there are more kids like you 
i m doomed  all right  i m going in there 
what s in it for me 
thank you 
the little capitalist 
hi  there 
all right  so i am taking a repair
square out of my cool toolbox   
to say in my blue voice  that i am sorry 
so  are we good now 
no 
  would you like five dollars 
  no 
an unopened package
of men s size 34 underwear

hi 
what did you do 
i just got here 
you gave them cake

hello  lave 
i can t wait for
you to get here  me little rabbit 
not now  my 
did he have a tattoo 
harper 
mom  you lied to me 
yogurt is not like ice cream 
no  honey 
baby 
  my favorite 
  harper 
this perfectly sums up
your entire approach to parenting 
we had an approach 
i don t know 
would artie and
turner like to continue watching saw 
you must be mistaken 
saw  rated r for strong graphic violence 
nudity and language 
no 
why did he give them cake 
because he does what he wants
and she defends him 
where are the kids now 
oh  i put them
on the treadmill until they calm down 
i told you my parents cauldn t handle this 
maybe it s just a case
of first day  worst day 
hey  you better hurry up 
you re going to miss your flight 
honey  i don t think
that i should go today 
maybe i should go tomorrow morning 
okay  yeah 
we  ll still have four days together 
okay 
you look good in cake 
what in the world is wrong with you 
what did i say 
what did i say to you 
just talk to me  don t yell 
i said   artie 
this is a second chance for us  
i said   artie  please behave  
i said   artie  i really want
those kids to love us  
or can t you remember
all the way back to yesterday 
okay  that s what i did 
when the cake
went in their mouths they loved me 
yeah  and now alice
doesn t want to leave us alone with them 
she doesn t trust us 
she said that 
on the phone to phil 
i accidentally overheard her
when i was listening at the door 
she thinks we re a pair of knuckleheads 
especially you 
it s the bottom of the ninth  artie 
we re going to lose the game 
shape up 
wonderful 
bravo 
harper  that was wonderful 
i stunk 
you most certainly did not 
wasn t she wonderful 
no 
this will not be good enough
for your audition 
you must practice more 
when my daughter underperforms 
i shun her 
this girl should be shunned 
practice  practice  practice 
gee whiz 
wasn t she the villain
in the last james bond movie 
sweetie  don t listen to her 
you know back in amarillo 
when artie was announcing there   
i got this audition
to be the local weather girl 
well  i was so uptight 
artie took me out the night before and we
both got bombed 
and the next day i got the job 
so  you re saying i should drink 
no  no  no  i m not saying that 
i am saying that perhaps you could relax 
you could go out with your friends 
you could have some fun friday night 
you know 
friday  i was invited to a   
no 
no  no  no 
i have three more days 
i have to practice  i have to   
i have to practice every second 
doctor schveer 
yes 
perhaps we got off on the wrong foot 
but i would like to let you know that   
if you ever speak
to my granddaughter like that again   
there will be nothing left of you 
but some red hair and an accent 
is that clear  comrade 
thank you  here you go 
carcinogens 
oh  the first one just laid a base 
this is the real thing 
i m at the ballpark 
he likes baseball 
yeah  he likes lots of things 
he likes sports 
he likes science  he likes movies 
he likes cake 
touché 
he s just hidden behind that    stutter 
well  you know  kids have a way
of working these things out 
no  they don t  dad 
that s why there s prison 
all right  guys  bring it in 
bring it in  get all those hands in there 
come on 
everybody on three  one  two  three   
let s have fun 
i am so excited about this 
let s play 
he s pitching 
yeah 
he has a good arm 
like mom  like son 
yeah  right 
no  you had a hose 
but then you hit puberty
and you got all girlie on me 
well  gee  dad 
i m so sorry that i hit puberty 
i was so proud of you back then 
you were usually the only girl out there 
you used to stand up to those stinky boys 
do you remember that summer
when you worked for me in the booth   
keeping score and doing stats 
you were so cute  sitting there
scrunched over your little pencil 
you never saw that ball coming  did you 
you could have yelled  incoming 
i was on the air 
i didn t want to start a panic 
you do love that job 
  yeah 
  yeah 
yeah  i do 
batter up 
this is that bully kid 
yeah  ivan 
i would so like to see
turner strike him out 
strike 
strike one 
hey  he is really good  he s really good 
way to go  turner 
turner simmons on the mound   
a young cuban prospect
who escaped on a raft 
he s facing ivan  a miserable child
who is loathed and despised by everyone 
dad 
swing and a miss  strike two 
one more strike and it s back
to the dugout
for this eight year old bullfrog 
dad   
the yearbook said
ivan is  most likely to do time  
simmons looks at him 
he shakes it off 
here s the pitch 
strike three 
you re out of there 
lights out  alice 
way to go  turner  way to look 
blue  blue  that s three strikes 
one  two  three  out of there 
time 
it s okay 
this is my dad and he s new here 
oh  okay  there are no outs in this game 
no outs  how is that possible 
they hit until they get on base 
  seriously 
  seriously 
dad  why don t we just sit down 
all right 
but you know that s kind of stupid 
because if you just think of the song   
 cause it s one  two 
three strikes  you re out   
at the old ball game
not   
until you get a hit
he s right 
i hate these games  what s the point 
the point is for the kids
to enjoy the game without competition 
yeah  but competition is the game 
you know  it s like life 
let me ask you something 
i mean  how do you even
know who s winning 
in this league  we don t keep score 
every game ends in a tie 
oh  no 
no agony of defeat  just
the thrill of a tie 
it s good they don t keep score 
yeah   cause your kid stinks 
oh  i will bust you up 
the old guy s right  it s boring 
see 
it is not boring 
they re children and they re having fun 
and there s plenty of time
in their lives to keep score 
  and you are out 
  no  i m not 
oh  yeah  turner  you struck him out 
  no  i didn t 
  yes  you did 
  you re out 
  no  i m not 
  you re out 
  no  i m not 
  three strikes  you re out 
  no  i m not 
barker  what s going on 
farty is going crazy 
again 
  you re out 
  no  you re out 
ivan  no hitting 
use your words 
yes  mom 
i m angry that you said i was out 
well  it s not boring anymore 
how is this artie s fault 
all i saw was
that little monster grab a baseball bat   
and hit your father in his   
special place 
well  you didn t see what led up to it 
  it was my fault 
  oh  honey 
you threatened her violin teacher 
she says  threatened  
i say  defended my granddaughter  
  phil 
  hey 
hey  we won  i won 
i won  can you believe it

  daddy won 
  congrats  dad 
so  they re
giving me the award tomorrow night 
when are you getting here 
you don t know
what s going on here  it s madness 
we can t leave our children

us the chance to do it 
you have been on our backs 
especially your dad s   
ever since we got here 
okay  take his side 
because you always do anyway 
and for a good reason 
because after your kids grow up 
your husband is the one who stays 
alice  i know

but  honey  there s no such thing 
and frankly  you need to show phil   
he s not just their father

do you know that 
carl told me to do it 
i don t think carl is being
a very good friend to you 
for a kangaroo 
he s something of a thrill seeker 
and i think it s time
that you start telling carl what to do 
one other thing 
i was supposed to   
watch after you today

i m sorry 
so  farty would appreciate it   
if when we get home

i want my 20 bucks back 
he s just a little boy

not him  turner 
what are you talking about 
i m talking about turner
and that brilliant advice you gave him 
hey 
i have to ask  did you hit him back 
  no 
  why not 
b because i hit him f first 
then he   
he started screaming
and s someone helped him fight me 
two against one  how big was this other   
it was his little sister 
she did this 
turner  this is all my fault 
when i said stand
up for yourself  i didn t mean hitting 
all right  listen 
oh  boy  the older i get 
the lower the floor gets 
turner  can i share something with you 
just between me and you 
no one else knows this 
this is just two guys talking 
when i was your age 
i was very shy because i was short 
i didn t talk to anybody 
and my self esteem   
you know  the way
i feel about myself  was really bad 
do you ever feel that way 
yeah  well  you know what  you shouldn t 
because you re a great kid 
all right  i want to play you something 
hey  house  i want to play something 
okay 
okay 
now  the first time i heard this   
i knew right away that
i had found my voice 
i knew that i had to become
a baseball announcer 
and once i knew that   
it didn t matter what anybody
else thought or said about me 
sh sh shot heard round the w world 
right  the shot heard round the world 
let me tell you about it 
it s 1951  long time ago 
brooklyn dodgers 
new york giants 
and they hated each other 
l like luke s skywalker and d darth vader 
worse 
well  the baseball season ends
and they re tied 
now  this one game would decide   
who would go to the world series
against the great new york yankees 
biggest game in the history of new york 
bottom of the ninth inning  two outs 
the giants are losing 4 to 2   
and a batter
named bobby thomson comes up to bat 
bobby thomson
up there swinging 
he s had two out of three 
a single and a double  and billy cox is   
close your eyes  close your eyes  come on 
close your eyes and you can see it 
bobby hitting at  292 
lockman without
too big of a lead at second 
but he  ll be running like the wind
if thomson hits one 
branca throws 
there s a long drive 
it s gonna be  i believe   
the giants win the pennant 
the giants win the pennant 
the giants win the pennant 
the giants win the pennant 
bobby thomson hits into the lower
deck of the left field stands 
the giants win the pennant   
and they re going crazy 
they re going crazy 
and home 
i don t believe it 
i do not believe it 
the giants won it by a score of 5 to 4   
and they re picking bobby thomson up 
and carrying him off the field 
that s what gave me my dream 
now the big dream 
of course  was to announce for the giants 
d did you 
no  but   
y you still might 
you never know 
c c can i h hear it again 
sure 
bobby thomson
up there swinging 
he s had two out of three 
a single and a double 
and billy cox is playing

we come home and she s 16 
boys  go in the house 
turner  turn off the alarm  please 
you know  you re not supposed
to be back until tomorrow 
well  we were just so curious   
as to why barker was nearly
killed this morning at the x games 
get your taser ready 
that s not right 
barker was at a play date
this morning with artie 
yeah 
i was in a little bind   
and i had to take him
with me on some business 
what business did you have
at the x games 
yeah  artie  what business 
aren t we forgetting
the most serious issue here 
what issue 
the death of an imaginary kangaroo 
he s imaginary 
yes 
you can go 
would someone please explain
what happened to carl 
we were playing kick the can   
and it started to rain 
so we all came indoors   
and i was helping
harper get dressed for her party 
a party  you re throwing a party 
no  dad  i m going to a party 
no  dad  i m going to a party 
for a boy who likes her 
a boy  what boy 
the night before your audition 
are you kidding 
i told her she could go 
it s ridiculous  it is out of the question 
maybe it s ridiculous for me to spend
all my time practicing the violin   
never doing anything else
and auditioning for a school tomorrow   
where i m never going to do anything else
the whole rest of my life 
well  she s using her words 
harper  harper 
i cannot allow you to take a talent   
a gift to which you have
dedicated so much time and effort   
and throw it away on a whim 
i hate you and i wish
anyone else was my mother 
maybe not those words 
thanks  mom and dad 
i couldn t have
gotten through the week without you 
i say we head for the airport right now 
don t even take our clothes
we just skedaddle 
i followed you for 35 years  artie 
wherever you needed to be 
that s where i was 
no complaints 
well  some 
but this week   
this week was supposed to be about
us and our grandchildren 
not you 
not you 
did you have to go to that audition 
it s not one of my better moments 
for one wonderful hour   
we weren t the  other  grandparents 
there you are 
you okay 
i ve had better mommy days 
you know  it may not have been
horrible to let her go to that party 
i know 
i just walked into that
scene and i freaked 
i can t believe my parents killed carl 
well  i was thinking about that 
you know  they didn t kill
carl  only barker could do that 
and it somehow took us
not being here for him to do it 
so  what s your point 
maybe we coddle him too much 
maybe he needed a little tough love   
to let go of his imaginary friend 
but  phil  that would make my father right 
yeah  we can t have any of that 
harper 
i could come back 
no  no  no  it s okay 
i m going to check on barker 
thanks  phil 
i m sorry 
for what 
narrow it down for me  dad 
for this week 
for almost getting barker hurt today 
i just feel terrible about that 
what were you even doing there 
i was on an audition 
because the grizzlies fired me 
what 
why didn t you tell us 
because it s humiliating 
why would they do that 
you re so good at that job 
maybe not good enough 
alice   
your mom was really hoping   
that this trip would help bring
her closer to her grandchildren 
and she and harper have developed
a relationship that s kind of great   
and i don t want
to see that end just because i screwed up 
what about you 
don t you want a relationship
with your grandchildren 
of course i do 
i mean   
like an hour
before you came home  it was really good 
it s just that sometimes   
i don t feel   
what 
welcome  here 
what happened to us  dad 
how old were you when harper was born 
twenty six 
did you know what you were doing 
no 
i was 23 when you came along 
and i was terrified  because you didn t
come with any instructions 
and i thought i was doing okay 
because unlike my father 
i wasn t constantly telling you   
what an annoying little waste
of time you were   
and believe me  i m cleaning that up 
and i thought that we were
actually having fun 
me and the weather girl   
and the cutest little girl you ever saw 
traveling around the country 
but then years go by 
and your daughter goes off to college   
and she doesn t come home
for thanksgiving or christmas 
or summers 
or ever 
and you get these clues  this inkling   
that perhaps all those years
she wasn t having such a good time   
and that maybe she thought
you didn t do such a good job 
and that really hurts  doesn t it 
yes 
so  little girl 
i have to give you three put ups 
  no  dad 
  please 
it s okay 
harper  turner  barker 
they re great kids
and you re a really good mother 
yeah 
i m basking in the glow
of my children s affection 
harper  she didn t mean anything 
i mean  she s 12 
get ready  it s going to get a lot worse 
only  don t let her turn her back on you 
because that will break your heart 
harper 
no 
barker has a special request
for tomorrow  before the audition 
and it involves all of us 
carl  your two favorite things were milk
and tofu dogs 
now  you can have both forever 
grandma  thanks for decorating the box 
oh  honey  it was my pleasure 
carl   
can artie say something nice for carl 
me 
how do you   
i m sorry  carl 
he died so young 
how do you say goodbye
to somebody you could never say hello to 
it s hard 
i didn t get to see carl very often 
but then again  nobody else did 
except for barker   
which is what made him so special 
carl wasn t just barker s friend 
he was a part of him 
and that made him a part of all of us 
carl  you will forever be in our hearts 
keep on hopping  buddy 
okay 
alice  you take harper backstage 
we ll grab some seats 
barker  turner  you re with us 
  good luck 
  knock them dead 
thanks 
break a leg 
bye  dad 
don t applaud  that s that woman 
good evening 
welcome family  friends
and distinguished judges   
to the atlanta performing arts center 
i am doctor schveer 
we have 74 amazingly talented musicians   
all vying for one position
at this prestigious conservatory 
so  without further ado i give you
chet halloran on the saxophone
yeah  go chet 
hang on a second  honey 
you know 
when you were just five years old   
we took you to that
little music school for the first time 
and all the other kids
they were just banging on things 
one kid tried to play another kid 
but from that very first day  you played 
and not just played   
you had this look
of such fulfillment on your face 
and i said to your dad 
 whatever it takes    
 whatever we have to do  i always 
 want to see that look on her face  
lately  i m not seeing it 
so  honey  do you
really not want to switch schools again 
okay 
what do you say we ditch this audition 
really 
yeah  it s okay 
mommy  i didn t mean what i said 
oh  baby 
i wouldn t want anyone else to be my mom 
and i love you 
that s good
because you re my only daughter 
and you know 
i don t really understand the boys 
i know  how weird are they 
yeah  yeah 
hi  baby 
we regret to inform you
of a slight change in our program 
harper simmons has forfeited her slot   
and her future 
since the next performer is warming up   
we re going to have to take
a 10 minute break 
hey  what s going on 
she s not going to audition 
you re not disappointed in me  are you 
oh  no  no  no  that s
not even a possibility 
is this is all my fault  it is  isn t it 
i came 3 000 miles
to ruin my granddaughter s life 
it s not your fault 
  really 
  it was our choice 
i love you 
here  take my picture  phil 
get in there 
where s turner 
you  kid 
turner 
bobby thomson  up there swinging 
he s had two out of three 
a single and a double   
and billy cox is playing him
right an the third base line 
one out  last of the ninth  branca pitches 
bobby thomson takes a strike
called on the inside corner 
bobby hitting at  292 
he s had a single and a double 
and he drove in the giants
first run with a long fly to center 
lockman without
too big of a lead at second   
but he  ll be
running like the wind if thomson hits one 
branca throws 
there s a long drive 
it s gonna be  i believe   
the giants win the pennant 
the giants win the pennant 
the giants win the pennant 
the giants win the pennant   
and they re going crazy 
they re going crazy 
and home 
i don t believe it  i don t believe it 
i do not believe it 
bobby thomson hit a line drive   
into the lower deck of
the left field stands 
and the place is going crazy 
the giants won it by a score of 5 to 4   
and they re picking bobby thomson up
and carrying him off the field 
yeah  yeah 
i saw it  i saw it  artie 
call me grandpa 
my big boy  how on earth    
grandpa taught me 
your father was wrong 
so was yours 
oh  al 
how much would it
embarrass you if i kissed you right now 
i think a lot 
as soon as we get home 
okay  i look forward to it 
dr  schveer  i shun you 
you are shunned 
my friends  it s taken me over 35 years
to say these words   
it s opening day for the giants
and we ve got a capacity crowd 
giants are out in the field 
there s charlie  the naz  naznic   
batting  290  takes his
stance at the plate 
yes  art  let s see
if naz can get his team out of a jam 
okay  turner  here s the action 
naz swings 
he gets some wood on that one 
hard drive to barker simmons 
it s through his legs 
walters has it  no  walters loses it 
sherman s got a glove down 
no  he stopped to pick his nose 
now  douglas is sitting down
and taking off his shoes   
because his mom said to me
before the game   
 sometimes he s in another world  
sherman still working
on that thing in his nose 
man  that must be really packed in there 
you betcha 
naz rounds second  heads for third 
sherman has the booger 
sherman has the booger 
i don t believe it  i do not believe it 
the other players are coming over
to examine it 
i can see it from here 
you could take
an aerial photograph of that thing 
i m sure there s going
to be orange slices in the locker room   
and a couple of tissues 
meanwhile  naz scores 
and that is another home run 
the giants are still leading  34 to 27 
what a first inning 
you re telling me 
i hope the second inning is shorter
because grandpa needs a bathroom break 
go barker 
our next batter is coming
up to the plate 
he s number three  barker simmons 
yeah  barker 
young man with incredible
power  three foot four and 45 pounds 
he hits it to shortstop  oh  it s through 
barker heading towards first base 
no  he makes a right turn 
he makes a right turn 
barker  go back 
he s going the wrong way

the loud pushy parents 
and the crying kids
