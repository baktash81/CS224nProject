helen
hi michael
been a long time
are you behind all this
yes im glad you came
its not like i had a choice
sorry about that
i had you put on the vital list
i thought it was important to have you a part of this team
why
ive been keeping up with the work
that youve been doing with professor barnhardt
what does it have to do with this
ill have to crashbrief you
in the conference room
object 07493
was first spotted just beyond jupiters orbit
by the spaceguard program
it was notable for the fact
that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse
but rather it had a hyperbolic orbit
and was shooting through our solar system
the object is moving at speeds of up to
three times 10 to the seventh meters per second
at first it was projected to pass
millions of miles outside of earths orbit
however we soon discovered that
the object was not following
a gravitationally free fall trajectory
as such
its path was recalculated
it was at this time a crisis response team
was activated
and everything you see around you
was set in motion
can we launch a missile to intercept it
the militarys attempting to do just that
in fact they may launch several
but given the speed at which
this object is moving
our chances of success are slim at best
why dont they evacuate the area
we simply do not have enough time
the affected area contains
some eight million inhabitants
the best we can do is to plan for the aftermath
how long do we have
seventyeight minutes
hey what did the cops want anyway
well theres gonna be
a big storm tonight
and
they needed some scientists to help out
you know with
planning stuff
so um
pretty soon youre all gonna go down
to the basement okay
i already told isabel
i havent seen anything on tv about
jacob just
just do it all right
all right i should go
wait um can we talk
just a little bit longer
were having dinner now
i really should go
you know i love you very much
okay bye helen
is that a cell phone
can i borrow it
what are the odds of an asteroid
making impact on manhattan
astronomical plus theres no light signature
then it cant be an asteroid
a primordial black hole perhaps
you know what that would mean
whatever it is if this object is moving
at three times 10 to the seventh meters per second
there will be no aftermath
if they cant stop it before it hits
there will be nothing left but dust
it will sterilize the earth
this is all theater
theyre sayin we lost launch capabilities
what does that even mean
the missiles disabled
disabled by what
they dont know
but they can restore it right
theres a fallback they have to launch
object impact in seven
our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
six five
thy kingdom come thy will be done
four
on earth as it is in heaven
three two
one
where is it
could they have made a mistake
wait
roger that
theyre saying the objects still on its approach
well then where is it
its slowing down
i see it
radiation levels are slightly elevated
but its not dangerous
im getting a lot of electrostatic interference
yeah me too
did you feel that
feel what
i feel it
its close
checkmate 06 who has tactical command here
this is 2917 i need to know
who has jurisdiction on this site
checkmate 03 this is gator 23
were blind here
checkmate 06 actual
do you copy over
what the hell is that thing
i need the rules of engagement now
target is advancing
repeat target is advancing
sniper team leaders come back
do not fire
its coming right at us
hold your fire hold your fire
do we engage
do not fire
fire fire
cease fire
all stations cease fire cease fire
dont shoot do not shoot
we need a medic
klaatu barada nikto
we need that dna swab
dna swab now
its soaking through
whats the o2 stat
get me the o2 stat
go no one else
lets go
what am i supposed to do now
do i start an iv
no we dont know its physiology
for all we know the fluids may kill it
what do i do what do i do
its blood is red it must have hemoglobin
okay shes right start the drip
okay i cant find a vein
it doesnt have any veins
look for a central line site then
its going into cardiac arrest defib
yeah get in there now go go
clear
are you okay
the monitor shorted out
heart rate is stabilizing its stabilizing
what now what now
do you have a surgeon
normally for a gunshot
wed be using a general anesthetic
but as we dont know
how the patient will react
i have opted for a local
im making the first incision now
no explosions
so far so good
pale flesh
the texture
something akin to
what
whale blubber
im taking a specimen now
lets pack that on ice and chopper it
to a genomics lab for dna mapping
id like a sample of that as well
i am entering the wound
and
my god
what is this imim sorry
imim a little taken aback
whats wrong
nothings wrong
thats the thing its all so familiar
the outer layer of the flesh
is exotic its strange
but as i go deeper
theres muscle vein nerve bone
im extracting
the bullet
this gray flesh
it seems to be just falling away
its its removing itself
i think i need to keep extracting it
yes continue
can you explain any of this
its dreaming
any signs of neural activity
it lit up the fmri
like times square
get help
code white subject is conscious
help
its looking at you
try saying something to it
my name is dr helen benson
were trying to help you
you have nothing to fear from us
help you nothing to fear
global markets are panicked
in early trading this morning
in response to the crisis in central park
trading has been halted on the new york stock exchange
the nikkei and the hang seng
as manhattan prepares for a massive evacuation
in other cities around the world
people are voluntarily evacuating population centers
fearing that the sphere in central park
may be the vanguard
of an impending alien invasion
the president and the vice president
have been taken to separate
and secure locations
until this situation has some kind of resolve
i am the eyes and the ears of the presidency
so what do we know
madam secretary
we lost contact with one of our dscs3
listening satellites
orbiting earth
what is that image
are you saying the sphere in central park isnt the only one
in fact we have intelligence
that smaller spheres have landed
at other locations around the world
do we have briefings on that
and where are these spheres right now
how is that even possible
i think were asking the wrong questions
what questions should we be asking
well lets start with this
where is our satellite
we lost contact with it
in the scheme of things
the loss of one satellite
isnt necessarily our concern
dscs3 stands for
defense systems communications satellite
remember what it communicates with
they were able to access our defense mainframe
via that satellite
thats how they temporarily shut down
our missile defenses and entered our airspace
we have changed all the codes
and on top of that
there is a vast amount of vital intelligence
on that mainframe
they know everything about us now
and we know nothing about them
almost nothing
the fact that they chose
to disable our defenses tells us
something about their intentions
madam secretary
we brought in several specialists
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being
this is our chief geneticist
dr hideo ikegawa
this is our chief astrobiologist
dr helen benson
hello
doctor
the being is in a nascent state
the dna samples weve taken seem to represent
three distinct life forms
three different dna types
yes including the beings brain
the body tissue is human
as far as we can tell
the gray flesh encasing it
is organic material
some kind of bioengineered space suit
what it resembles oddly enough
is placental tissue
which makes sense given that placentas
a lifesupport system
and that basically in order to survive
in our environment
the being had to be born here
in its human form
they mustve come here in the past
and obtained a dna sample from a human subject
now since that birth
the being has grown exponentially
this is one hour after surgery
three hours
six hours
how much can you tell us about it
by decoding its dna
um you dont understand
these are the dead sea scrolls
geneticists
are gonna be studying this code for generations
no they arent
this code is the property of the us government
its very existence is classified
i wanna see it
water
bring him up
does it actually speak our language
or does it just parrot what its heard
no it seems to already understand our language
theyve compromised our satellites
they know everything about us
mr driscoll
my name is regina jackson
im the secretary of defense
of the united states of america
this body will take some getting used to
ive been sent here to determine who
or what you represent
and what your intentions are
it feels unreal to me
alien
itll take time to adapt
what were you before you were human
different
different how
it would only frighten you
do you have a name
klaatu
do you represent a civilization
i represent a group of civilizations
where is this group of civilizations
all around you
what is your purpose in coming here
there is a gathering of world leaders
not far from here
i will explain my purpose to them
im afraid thats not possible
perhaps you should explain yourself
to me instead
do you speak for the entire human race
i speak for the president of the united states
now please tell me
why have you come to our planet
your planet
yes
this is our planet
no it is not
weve decided to sedate him
and move him to a more secure location
are you going to interrogate him
thats a possibility
madam secretary as scientists
we cant consent to this
he says he wants to speak to the un
history has lessons to teach us
about first encounters
between civilizations
as a rule the lessadvanced civilization
is either exterminated or enslaved
im thinking of pizarro and the incas
columbus and the native americans
and the list goes on
unfortunately in this case
the lessadvanced civilization is us
this is a representative
of an extraterrestrial civilization
this is the most important discovery
in the history of mankind
it may well be the last discovery
in the history of mankind
we need to know what theyre planning
and we need to know now
so you wanna drug him
interrogate him im sorry
we wont do that you understand
i understand completely
of course if you wont do it
well have to call in someone who will
well im sure you can find
someone who will help you with
ill do it
helen
ill do it
that wont be necessary doctor
weve already prepared the solution for you
i just need a syringe
i want to apologize to you
it seems we got off to a bad start
it seems we did
were going to transport you
to a different facility
for better medical care
no you are not
excuse me
i am leaving
i cant allow you to do that
it is not up to you
this is a military installation
youre surrounded by hundreds of soldiers
theres no leaving here
i have done nothing wrong
you invaded our airspace
that automaton that emerged from the sphere
it attacked our troops
it acted to defend me
it activates in the presence of violence
dr benson please
run
its done
if youll come with us maam
keep moving please
im going to ask you
a series of control questions
are you currently in a seated position
yes
are you human
my body is
do you feel pain
my body does
are you aware of an impending attack
on the planet earth
you should let me go
ill repeat the question
what gate did you use to enter this base
east loading door
how do i get there
100 yards left from the back of this building
is there a security code
fourfourbravothreezero
what size is that suit
fortytwo long
take it off
attention all security personnel
report to your designated posts
all civilian personnel
report to operations immediately
im leaving you now
no
put every arm of the government
military law enforcement federal state and local
on high alert
if the media gets word that weve lost the being
use a cover story
we cant risk a panic
call him an escaped convict
use every surveillance satellite
every drone aircraft
every freeway camera
use every resource weve got
attention all scheduled trains
into and out of penn station
to manhattan are canceled
due to the security perimeter
in central park
excuse me excuse me
we are committed to providing you
with quality service
thank you
we ask that our passengers
remain calm and orderly
during these difficult circumstances
any disturbance will be subject
to immediate arrest by transit police
lets go
back off
dont push me
look im warning you
i dont
just give me the ticket
im not giving you anything just
give me the
whats the matter with you
hey
go and get him
we have a man down
unrest is causing leaders around the world
to criticize the us response
to the arrival of the spheres
reactions from both national
and international religious communities
have been varied
while some have responded with hope and measured optimism
most religious communities
have considered recent events
to be apocalyptic
at gatherings and prayer vigils
in virtually every major city
many see the arrival
of the central park sphere
as a sign of a new era
or perhaps even the end of the world
leaders around the world are protesting
the uss decision
to deny foreign scientists
full access to the being
have you done your homework
schools canceled on account of the aliens
they say its an invasion
well theyre wrong
what makes you so sure
i just know
dont get that
jacob

i am out of control
anyone got any other ideas
why are people running
we should stay and fight
they didnt come here to hurt us
well we should kill em anyway
just to make sure
dont say that
thats what dad wouldve done
i think he wouldve looked for a different way
he wouldve fought
i like to think i knew him pretty well
i knew him too longer than you
what do you think
of what
should people run
or should we stay and fight
neither
what should we do then
theres nothing you can do
this is it pull in here
mcdonalds
where are you going
jacob where are you going
to the bathroom
where is the boys father
hes dead
how did he die
he was in the army
so the boy wishes his soldier father were here
to rescue the world from the aliens
the boy wishes his father were here
for a lot of reasons
aliens being the least of them
he wasnt even that kind of a soldier
he was an engineer
he went over there to build
not to fight
and his mother
she died when he was a baby
i married his father and a year ago
he was killed
why did you come here
i came to save the earth
from what
hes here
and number 44 fortyfours ready
your tea grandfather
thank you
are you one of them
one of who
no never mind sorry
youve been out of contact
for a long time
i had a dangerous assignment
this is hostile territory
ive noticed
i was hoping i could reason with them
im afraid they are not a reasonable race
ive been living amongst them
for seventy years now
i know them well
and
any attempt to intercede with them
would be futile
they are destructive
and they wont change
is that your official report
the tragedy is they know
whats going to become of them
they sense it
but they cant seem to do anything about it
its decided then
ill begin the process as soon as possible
we should make preparations
for our departure
im staying
you cant stay here
i can and i will
if you stay youll die
i know
this is my home now
you yourself called them a destructive race
thats true
but still there is another side
you see i i love them
this is a very strange thing
iii cant find a way to explain it to you
for many years i
i cursed my luck for being sent here
human life is difficult
but as this life is coming to an end
i consider myself lucky
to have lived it
copy that base
no sudden movements no aggressive actions
no matter what happens no gunfire
track is in place sir

were just giving him a ride
where

the forest
stay here
i want you to lock the door okay
and dont open it for anyone but me
im serious
helen whats going on
were getting images of these spheres
from all over the world
okavango gobi baku
which of our agencies gathered this intel
maam none of them
we pulled these off the internet
is that them
no
its us
those are ordinary cephalopods
squid octopus
i dont like him hes weird and
why are we driving him around anyway
um
its complicated
is he comin home with us
no no
well what if you decide you like him
and he wants to move in
no its not like that
god no
listen to me
no one is moving in
you dont understand
whatever you wait for him im goin home
jacob
jacob
what is the matter with you
these spheres now appear to be leaving
in the same mysterious manner as they came
hopefully this mass exodus
will bring an end to the panic and unrest
weve been seeing around the world
the only sphere that
doesnt appear to be leaving
is the giant sphere in central park
you think we scared em off
theyre not afraid of us
i need to get back to the city
not until you tell me whats going on
did you do that
yes
jacob get in the car
hes one of them
please get in the car
get in the car
i need to know whats happening
this planet is dying
the human race is killing it
so youve come here to help us
no i didnt
you said you came to save us
i said i came to save the earth
you came to save the earth
from us
you came to save the earth from us
we cant risk the survival of this planet
for the sake of one species
what are you saying
if the earth dies you die
if you die the earth survives
there are only a handful of planets
in the cosmos
that are capable of supporting complex life
you cant do this
this one cant be allowed to perish
we can change
we can still turn things around
weve watched weve waited
and hoped that you would change
please
its reached the tipping point
we have to act
please
well undo the damage youve done
and give the earth a chance to begin again
dont do this
please we could change
we can change
the decision is made
the process has begun
oh god
adam 85 confirming
104 central
it wont make any difference helen
even if they arrest me
even if they kill me
the process will continue
both of you hands on the car right now
is that a child in the car
yes
this is hp28
im on i67
i have the fbi suspect in custody
along with one adult female
and one child
awaiting instructions
70140 roger
tell the child to get out of the car
get the kid out of the car
honey come on
okay you two over there

the pain will only last a moment
you killed him you killed him
jacob jacob
let me finish
you killed him you killed him
shh shh come here
you killed him
all right sit down
he killed him
shh
he killed him
hell be all right
i dont understand
youre gonna kill us all
but you saved him
he was an obstacle
i meant him no harm
you could stop this couldnt you
if you wanted to
i tried to reason with you
i tried to speak with your leaders
those arent our leaders
you wanna speak to one of our leaders
ill take you to one
let me take you
get in the car
maybe they were just collecting specimens
from our planet
its not our planet
that what he said to me in the hospital
an ark
excuse me
its an ark
so are all the other spheres
theyre saving as many species
as they can
if the sphere is an ark then what comes next is
the flood
karl were here
okay lets get you settled
thats a nobel prize
he won it for his work
in biological altruism
probably still be in his desk drawer
if i hadnt gotten it framed for him
you tired
just a little
close but no
i wouldnt
he wont mind
hes one of them
you shouldnt be helping him
we should stop him
for just this once
i need you to trust me
is it possible
i have so many questions to ask you
its bach
its beautiful
so were not so different after all
i wish that were true
so is it a machine or a living thing
its both or neither
what do you mean neither
it seems to be some sort of
siliconebased hybrid
were calling it gort
genetically organized robotic technology
oh the military and their acronyms
weve used every diagnostic method available
mri thermal imaging pet scan
but it was impervious
so we attempted
a roboticallyassisted exploration
using a diamond drill
and
the drill bit fractured
itll take 24 hours to fix it robotically
colonel we dont have 24 hours
send somebody in there
to fix that drill
food and fuel hoarding
have led to shortages
which erupted into looting incidents
throughout asia and south america
outbreaks of rioting
and unrest in such cities
as guangdong china london and chicago
due to the shortages of such basic commodities
as fuel food and drinking water
many point to the central park sphere as
amidst the chaos in the
new yorknewjersey areas
local police are looking for an escaped convict
whose name is not being released
authorities believe that he is
a significant threat to the public
and are asking for any information
that could lead to his capture
if you have seen this man
please contact the number on your screen below
there must be alternatives
you must have some technology that can solve our problem
your problem is not technology
the problem is you
you lack the will to change
then help us change
i cannot change your nature
you treat the world
as you treat each other
but every civilization reaches
a crisis point eventually
most of them dont make it
yours did how
our sun was dying
we had to evolve in order to survive
so it was only when your world
was threatened with destruction
that you became what you are now
yes
well thats where we are
you say were on the brink of destruction
and youre right
but its only on the brink
that people find the will to change
only at the precipice do we evolve
this is our moment
dont take it from us
we are close to an answer
whats wrong
jacob can you get your boots on
he cant get caught
what do i do
change his mind
not with reason but with yourself
its too late for that
jacob
down here hes here
down here down here
what are you doing
hes here
what are you doing
im trying to help them thats why i called them
what
i told them where we are
jacob you didnt
we shouldnt be helping him
jacob im trying to help us
we should kill him
thats what dad wouldve done
you fight me on everything
on everything
if my dad were here
but he isnt here hes gone
jacob
weve extracted the female
returning to base

you are clear to engage
you are go to take out the target
roger that
please dont hurt me
thanks
i dont know where we are
can you help me get home
this way
hes come here to exterminate us hasnt he
you cant stop him
the only chance we have is
if he changes his mind
