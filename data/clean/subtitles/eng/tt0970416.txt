it s the only known organism
that lives in sulfuric acid 
that s right  and  
  yes  miss rouhani 
  deinococcus radiodurans 
um  first discovered in 1956   
  breeding inside of drums of radioactive waste 
  that s correct 
so  pompejana  thiobacillus  deinococcus  
which of these three
would most likely survive   
in the extreme environment of the
jupiter moon callisto  and why 
tom  can you get the lights  please 
that s your lab report question
for this week 
and it s due in my box
by midnight on friday

helen  do you have any idea
why this is happening to us 
  no 
  well  think 
  what do we have in common 
  what do you do for a living  yusef 
  i m a nuclear physicist 
  i m an astronomer 
  geologist 
  i m an astrobiologist

no  microbiology 
theories of life beyond earth 
  all right  so we re all scientists 
  no  not me 
  i m a civil engineer 
  put it all together  and what do you get 
i ve participated in government mobilizations
like this before 
war games in preparations for certain scenarios 
  is that what you think this is 
  no 
whatever it is  it s not a game 
no  keep those vehicles moving  let s go 
your attention  please

  your attention  please 
  thank you 
make your way directly across the courtyard
to the main barracks 
  helen 
  hi  michael 
  been a long time 
  are you behind all this 
  yes  i m glad you came 
  it s not like i had a choice 
sorry about that 
i had you put on the vital list 
  i thought it was important to have you a part of this team 
  why 
i ve been keeping up with the work
that you ve been doing with professor barnhardt 
what does it have to do with this 
i ll have to crash brief you
in the conference room 
object 07 493   
was first spotted just beyond jupiter s orbit
by the spaceguard program 
it was notable for the fact
that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse 
but rather  it had a hyperbolic orbit   
and was shooting through our solar system 
the object is moving at speeds of up to
three times 10 to the seventh meters per second 
at first  it was projected to pass
millions of miles outside of earth s orbit 
however  we soon discovered that   
the object was not following
a gravitationally free fall trajectory 
as such 
its path was recalculated 
it was at this time a crisis response team
was activated   
and everything you see around you
was set in motion 
can we launch a missile to intercept it 
the military s attempting to do just that 
in fact  they may launch several 
but given the speed at which
this object is moving 
our chances of success are slim at best 
  why don t they evacuate the area 
  we simply do not have enough time 
the affected area contains
some eight million inhabitants 
the best we can do is to plan for the aftermath 
how long do we have 
seventy eight minutes 
hey  what did the cops want anyway 
well  there s gonna be   
a big storm tonight 
and   
they needed some scientists to help out 
you know with   
planning stuff 
so  um 
pretty soon  you re all gonna go down
to the basement  okay 
  i already told isabel 
  i haven t seen anything on tv about  
jacob  just  
just do it  all right 
all right  i should go 
wait  um  can we talk   
just a little bit longer 
we re having dinner now 
i really should go 
you know  i love you very much 
okay  bye  helen 
is that a cell phone 
can i borrow it 
what are the odds of an asteroid
making impact on manhattan 
  astronomical  plus  there s no light signature 
  then it can t be an asteroid 
  a primordial black hole  perhaps 
  you know what that would mean 
whatever it is  if this object is moving   
at three times 10 to the seventh meters per second 
there will be no aftermath 
if they can t stop it before it hits 
there will be nothing left but dust 
it will sterilize the earth 
this is all theater 
they re sayin  we lost launch capabilities 
what does that even mean 
  the missile s disabled 
  disabled by what 
  they don t know 
  but they can restore it  right 
there s a fallback  they have to launch 
object impact in seven 
  our father  who art in heaven  hallowed be thy name 
  six  five 
  thy kingdom come  thy will be done 
  four 
  on earth as it is in heaven 
  three  two 
one 
where is it 
  could they have made a mistake 
  wait 
roger that 
they re saying the object s still on its approach 
well  then where is it 
  it s slowing down 
  i see it 
radiation levels are slightly elevated 
but it s not dangerous 
i m getting a lot of electrostatic interference 
yeah  me too 
did you feel that 
feel what 
i feel it 
it s close 
checkmate 0 6  who has tactical command here 
this is 29 17  i need to know
who has jurisdiction on this site 
checkmate 0 3  this is gator 2 3 
we re blind here 
checkmate 0 6  actual 
do you copy  over 
what the hell is that thing 
i need the rules of engagement now 
target is advancing 
repeat  target is advancing 
sniper team leaders  come back 
  do not fire 
  it s coming right at us 
  hold your fire  hold your fire 
  do we engage 
  do not fire 
  fire  fire 
  cease fire 
  all stations  cease fire  cease fire 
don t shoot  do not shoot 
we need a medic 
klaatu  barada  nikto 
we need that d n a  swab 
d n a  swab now 
  it s soaking through 
  what s the o2  stat 
get me the o2  stat 
go  no one else 
let s go 
what am i supposed to do now 
do i start an i v  
no  we don t know its physiology 
for all we know  the fluids may kill it 
  what do i do  what do i do 
  its blood is red  it must have hemoglobin 
  okay  she s right  start the drip 
  okay  i can t find a vein 
  it doesn t have any veins 
  look for a central line site then 
it s going into cardiac arrest  defib 
  yeah  get in there now  go  go 
  clear 
  are you okay 
  the monitor shorted out 
heart rate is stabilizing  it s stabilizing 
what now  what now 
do you have a surgeon 
normally for a gunshot 
we d be using a general anesthetic 
but as we don t know
how the patient will react 
i have opted for a local 
i m making the first incision    now 
no explosions 
so far  so good 
pale flesh 
the texture  
something akin to  
what 
whale blubber 
i m taking a specimen now 
let s pack that on ice and chopper it
to a genomics lab for d n a  mapping 
i d like a sample of that as well 
i am entering the wound 
and  
my god 
what is this  i m i m sorry 
i m i m a little taken aback 
  what s wrong 
  nothing s wrong 
that s the thing  it s all so familiar 
the outer layer of the flesh
is exotic  it s strange 
but as i go deeper 
there s muscle  vein  nerve  bone 
i m extracting   
the bullet 
this gray flesh 
it seems to be just falling away 
it s   it s removing itself 
i think i need to keep extracting it 
yes  continue 
can you explain any of this 
it s dreaming 
any signs of neural activity 
it lit up the f m r i 
like times square 
get help 
code white  subject is conscious 
help 
it s looking at you 
try saying something to it 
my name is dr  helen benson 
we re trying to help you 
you have nothing to fear from us 
help you  nothing to fear 
global markets are panicked
in early trading this morning   
in response to the crisis in central park 
trading has been halted on the new york stock exchange 
the nikkei and the hang seng   
as manhattan prepares for a massive evacuation 
in other cities around the world 
people are voluntarily evacuating population centers 
fearing that the sphere in central park   
may be the vanguard
of an impending alien invasion 
the president and the vice president   
have been taken to separate
and secure locations 
until this situation has some kind of resolve 
i am the eyes and the ears of the presidency 
  so  what do we know 
  madam secretary 
we lost contact with one of our d s c s  3
listening satellites   
  orbiting earth 
  what is that image 
  are you saying the sphere in central park isn t the only one 
  in fact  we have intelligence   
that smaller spheres have landed
at other locations around the world 
do we have briefings on that 
and where are these spheres right now 
  how is that even possible 
  i think we re asking the wrong questions 
what questions should we be asking 
well  let s start with this 
where is our satellite 
  we lost contact with it 
  in the scheme of things 
the loss of one satellite
isn t necessarily our concern 
d s c s  3 stands for
defense systems communications satellite 
remember what it communicates with 
they were able to access our defense mainframe
via that satellite 
that s how they temporarily shut down
our missile defenses and entered our airspace 
  we have changed all the codes 
  and on top of that 
there is a vast amount of vital intelligence
on that mainframe 
they know everything about us now 
  and we know nothing about them 
  almost nothing 
the fact that they chose
to disable our defenses tells us   
something about their intentions 
madam secretary 
we brought in several specialists   
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being 
this is our chief geneticist 
dr  hideo ikegawa 
this is our chief astrobiologist 
dr  helen benson 
  hello 
  doctor 
the being is in a nascent state 
the d n a  samples we ve taken seem to represent
three distinct life forms 
three different d n a  types 
yes  including the being s brain 
the body tissue is human 
as far as we can tell 
the gray flesh encasing it
is organic material 
some kind of bioengineered space suit 
what it resembles  oddly enough 
is placental tissue 
which makes sense  given that placenta s
a life support system 
and that basically  in order to survive
in our environment 
the being had to be born here   
in its human form 
they must ve come here in the past
and obtained a d n a  sample from a human subject 
now  since that birth 
the being has grown exponentially 
this is one hour after surgery 
three hours 
  six hours 
  how much can you tell us about it   
  by decoding its d n a  
  um  you don t understand 
these are the dead sea scrolls 
geneticists   
  are gonna be studying this code for generations 
  no  they aren t 
this code is the property of the u s  government 
its very existence is classified 
i wanna see it 
water 
  bring him up 
  does it actually speak our language 
or does it just parrot what it s heard 
no  it seems to already understand our language 
they ve compromised our satellites 
they know everything about us 
mr  driscoll 
my name is regina jackson 
i m the secretary of defense
of the united states of america 
this body will take some getting used to 
i ve been sent here to determine who
or what you represent   
and what your intentions are 
it feels unreal to me 
alien 
it ll take time to adapt 
what were you    before you were human 
different 
different how 
it would only frighten you 
  do you have a name 
  klaatu 
do you represent a civilization 
i represent a group of civilizations 
  where is this group of civilizations 
  all around you 
what is your purpose in coming here 
there is a gathering of world leaders
not far from here 
i will explain my purpose to them 
i m afraid that s not possible 
perhaps you should explain yourself
to me instead 
do you speak for the entire human race 
i speak for the president of the united states 
now  please  tell me 
why have you come to our planet 
  your planet 
  yes 
this is our planet 
no  it is not 
we ve decided to sedate him
and move him to a more secure location 
  are you going to interrogate him 
  that s a possibility 
madam secretary  as scientists 
we can t consent to this 
he says he wants to speak to the u n 
history has lessons to teach us
about first encounters   
between civilizations 
as a rule  the less advanced civilization
is either exterminated or enslaved 
i m thinking of pizarro and the incas 
columbus and the native americans 
and the list goes on 
unfortunately  in this case 
the less advanced civilization is us 
this is a representative
of an extraterrestrial civilization 
this is the most important discovery
in the history of mankind 
it may well be the last discovery
in the history of mankind 
we need to know what they re planning 
and we need to know now 
so you wanna drug him 
interrogate him  i m sorry 
  we won t do that  you understand 
  i understand completely 
of course  if you won t do it 
we ll have to call in someone who will 
well  i m sure you can find
someone who will help you with  
  i ll do it 
  helen 
i ll do it 
that won t be necessary  doctor 
we ve already prepared the solution for you 
i just need a syringe 
i want to apologize to you 
it seems we got off to a bad start 
  it seems we did 
  we re going to transport you   
to a different facility
for better medical care 
no  you are not 
excuse me 
  i am leaving 
  i can t allow you to do that 
  it is not up to you 
  this is a military installation 
you re surrounded by hundreds of soldiers 
there s no leaving here 
i have done nothing wrong 
you invaded our airspace 
that    automaton that emerged from the sphere 
it attacked our troops 
it acted to defend me 
it activates in the presence of violence 
dr  benson  please 
run 
it s done 
if you ll come with us  ma am 
keep moving  please 
i m going to ask you
a series of control questions 
are you currently in a seated position 
yes 
are you human 
my body is 
do you feel pain 
my body does 
are you aware of an impending attack   
on the planet earth 
you should let me go 
i ll repeat the question 
what gate did you use to enter this base 
  east loading door 
  how do i get there 
100 yards left from the back of this building 
is there a security code 
four four bravo three zero 
what size is that suit 
  forty two long 
  take it off 
attention  all security personnel 
report to your designated posts 
all civilian personnel
report to operations immediately 
i m leaving you now 
no 
put every arm of the government  
military  law enforcement  federal  state and local  
on high alert 
  if the media gets word that we ve lost the being  
  use a cover story 
we can t risk a panic 
call him an escaped convict 
use every surveillance satellite 
every drone aircraft 
every freeway camera 
use every resource we ve got 
attention  all scheduled trains   
into and out of penn station
to manhattan are canceled   
due to the security perimeter
in central park 
excuse me  excuse me 
we are committed to providing you
with quality service 
thank you 
we ask that our passengers
remain calm and orderly   
during these difficult circumstances 
any disturbance will be subject
to immediate arrest by transit police 
let s go 
  back off 
  don t push me 
  look  i m warning you 
  i don t  
  just give me the ticket 
  i m not giving you anything  just  
give me the  
what s the matter with you 
  hey 
  go and get him 
  we have a man down 
  unrest is causing leaders around the world   
to criticize the u s  response
to the arrival of the spheres 
reactions from both national   
and international religious communities
have been varied 
while some have responded with hope and measured optimism 
most religious communities   
have considered recent events
to be apocalyptic 
at gatherings and prayer vigils
in virtually every major city 
many see the arrival
of the central park sphere   
as a sign of a new era 
or perhaps even the end of the world 
leaders around the world are protesting
the u s  s decision   
to deny foreign scientists
full access to the being 
have you done your homework 
school s canceled on account of the aliens 
  they say it s an invasion 
  well  they re wrong 
  what makes you so sure 
  i just know 
don t get that 
  jacob

why are people running 
we should stay and fight 
they didn t come here to hurt us 
well  we should kill  em anyway 
just to make sure 
  don t say that 
  that s what dad would ve done 
  i think he would ve looked for a different way 
  he would ve fought 
i like to think i knew him pretty well 
i knew him too  longer than you 
  what do you think 
  of what 
should people run 
or should we stay and fight 
  neither 
  what should we do then 
there s nothing you can do 
this is it  pull in here 
mcdonald s 
where are you going 
  jacob  where are you going 
  to the bathroom 
where is the boy s father 
he s dead 
  how did he die 
  he was in the army 
so the boy wishes his soldier father were here   
to rescue the world from the aliens 
the boy wishes his father were here
for a lot of reasons 
aliens being the least of them 
he wasn t even that kind of a soldier 
he was an engineer 
he went over there to build 
  not to fight 
  and his mother 
she died when he was a baby 
i married his father  and    a year ago 
he was killed 
why did you come here 
i came to save the earth 
  from what 
  he s here 
and number 44  forty four s ready 
your tea  grandfather 
thank you 
are you one of them 
one of who 
no  never mind  sorry 
you ve been out of contact
for a long time 
i had a dangerous assignment 
this is hostile territory 
i ve noticed 
i was hoping i could reason with them 
i m afraid they are not a reasonable race 
i ve been living amongst them
for seventy years now 
i know them well 
and 
any attempt to intercede with them
would be futile 
they are destructive 
and they won t change 
is that your official report 
the tragedy is  they know
what s going to become of them 
they sense it 
but they can t seem to do anything about it 
it s decided then 
i ll begin the process as soon as possible 
we should make preparations
for our departure 
i m staying 
you can t stay here 
i can  and i will 
if you stay  you ll die 
i know 
this is my home now 
you yourself called them a destructive race 
that s true 
but still  there is another side 
you see  i   i love them 
this is a very strange thing 
i i i can t find a way to explain it to you 
for many years  i  
i cursed my luck for being sent here 
human life is difficult 
but as this life is coming to an end 
i consider myself lucky   
to have lived it 
copy that  base 
no sudden movements  no aggressive actions 
no matter what happens  no gunfire

stay here 
i want you to lock the door  okay 
and don t open it for anyone but me 
i m serious 
helen  what s going on 
we re getting images of these spheres
from all over the world

  which of our agencies gathered this intel 
ma am  none of them 
we pulled these off the internet 
is that    them 
no 
it s us 
those are ordinary cephalopods 
squid  octopus 
i don t like him  he s weird  and

  um  
it s complicated 
is he comin  home with us 
no  no 
well  what if you decide you like him

god  no 
listen to me 
no one is moving in 
you don t understand 
  whatever  you wait for him  i m goin  home 
  jacob 
jacob 
what is the matter with you 
these spheres now appear to be leaving   
in the same mysterious manner as they came 
hopefully  this mass exodus
will bring an end to the panic and unrest   
we ve been seeing around the world 
the only sphere that
doesn t appear to be leaving   
is the giant sphere in central park 
you think we scared  em off 
they re not afraid of us 
i need to get back to the city 
not until you tell me what s going on 
  did you do that 
  yes 
  jacob  get in the car 
  he s one of them 
please  get in the car 
get in the car 
i need to know what s happening 
this planet is dying 
the human race is killing it 
so you ve come here to help us 
no  i didn t 
you said you came to save us 
i said i came to save the earth 
you came to save the earth   
from us 
you came to save the earth from us 
we can t risk the survival of this planet
for the sake of one species 
  what are you saying 
  if the earth dies  you die 
if you die  the earth survives 
there are only a handful of planets
in the cosmos   
that are capable of supporting complex life 
  you can t do this 
  this one can t be allowed to perish 
we can change 
we can still turn things around 
we ve watched  we ve waited
and hoped that you would change 
  please 
  it s reached the tipping point 
  we have to act 
  please 
we ll undo the damage you ve done
and give the earth a chance to begin again 
don t do this 
please  we could change 
we can change 
the decision is made 
the process has begun 
oh  god 
adam 85 confirming 
10 4  central 
it won t make any difference  helen 
even if they arrest me 
even if they kill me 
the process will continue 
both of you  hands on the car  right now

  yes

along with one adult female
and one child 
  awaiting instructions

i don t understand 
you re gonna kill us all 
but you saved him 
he was an obstacle 
i meant him no harm 
you could stop this  couldn t you 
if you wanted to 
i tried to reason with you 
i tried to speak with your leaders 
those aren t our leaders 
you wanna speak to one of our leaders 
i ll take you to one 
let me take you 
get in the car 
maybe they were just collecting specimens
from our planet 
it s not our planet 
that what he said to me in the hospital 
an ark 
  excuse me 
  it s an ark 
so are all the other spheres 
they re saving as many species
as they can 
  if the sphere is an ark  then what comes next is  
  the flood 
karl  we re here 
okay  let s get you settled 
that s a nobel prize 
he won it for his work
in biological altruism 
probably still be in his desk drawer
if i hadn t gotten it framed for him 
  you tired 
  just a little 
close  but no 
i wouldn t  
he won t mind 
he s one of them 
you shouldn t be helping him 
we should stop him 
for just this once 
i need you to trust me 
is it possible 
i have so many questions to ask you 
it s bach 
it s beautiful 
so we re not so different after all 
i wish that were true 
so is it a machine  or a living thing 
  it s both  or    neither 
  what do you mean  neither 
it seems to be some sort of
silicone based hybrid 
we re calling it gort  
genetically organized robotic technology 
oh  the military and their acronyms 
we ve used every diagnostic method available  
m r i   thermal imaging  pet scan 
but it was impervious 
so we attempted   
a robotically assisted exploration
using a diamond drill 
  and 
  the drill bit fractured 
it ll take 24 hours to fix it robotically 
colonel  we don t have 24 hours 
send somebody in there
to fix that drill 
food and fuel hoarding
have led to shortages 
which erupted into looting incidents
throughout asia and south america 
outbreaks of rioting   
and unrest in such cities
as guangdong  china  london and chicago   
due to the shortages of such basic commodities
as fuel  food and drinking water 
many point to the central park sphere as  
amidst the chaos in the
new york newjersey areas 
local police are looking for an escaped convict
whose name is not being released 
authorities believe that he is
a significant threat to the public   
and are asking for any information
that could lead to his capture 
if you have seen this man 
please contact the number on your screen below 
there must be alternatives 
you must have some technology that can solve our problem 
your problem is not technology 
the problem is you 
  you lack the will to change 
  then help us change 
i cannot change your nature 
you treat the world
as you treat each other 
but every civilization reaches
a crisis point eventually 
  most of them don t make it 
  yours did  how 
our sun was dying 
we had to evolve in order to survive 
so it was only when your world
was threatened with destruction   
that you became what you are now 
  yes 
  well  that s where we are 
you say we re on the brink of destruction 
and you re right 
but it s only on the brink   
that people find the will to change 
only at the precipice do we evolve 
this is our moment 
don t take it from us 
we are close to an answer 
what s wrong 
jacob  can you get your boots on 
he can t get caught 
  what do i do 
  change his mind 
not with reason  but with yourself 
it s too late for that

you have to let me talk to him

and i don t think he wants to do this 
we have the situation under control 
madam secretary  general quinn

our pilots launched a salvo
of sidewinder air to air missiles   
  into the heart of the mass 
  and 
every strike made it larger 
and this mass  
where is it heading 
everywhere
