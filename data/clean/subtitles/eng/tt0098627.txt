beats living with mom and dad

setting my goals and working hard

it was the clumsy approach it worked
you are going to want
to borrow my apartment
no but thank you thats sweet
but i cant do that to you thank you
if she finds out you live with your folks
you will embarrass yourself
yeah i know but i cant do that to you
it is the cockroaches isnt it
well
they scatter when the lights go on
yimr parker mr lomax will see you now
i feel lucky
no i only want the maserati
if it comes in that jet black
look if you cant do it for me
ill just have to take my business
to another dealer
yeah
so paint it i mean how hard
can this whole thing be
right
all right see thats better
see how easy it is to do business with me
no trade strictly cash
right
all right good
gentlemen what have you got for me
as you may or may not know mr lomax
larry and i have been i mean working
where is he going
i dont know
what are we supposed to do
bet that thing moves huh jesus
put that back
its a beautiful boat
you gentlemen were saying
yes well
as you might have heard
larry and i have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system
right
thanks
sir its a very big job
a big job we have been working hard
a very big job
ive been at it for quite some time
weekends also
weekends late and
why dont you show him
thank you
weve got something
you should know about
got them both there
yes page 28 and 41
you sure these figures are accurate
yes
positive
yes sir mr lomax
bernie
call me bernie
i mean my father is mr lomax right
okay bernie
yes its all there in black and white
we both worked on this one bern
e
bernie
papers
right here bernie
if anything has to go
i am glad its my vision
and not the old joystick
you know what i mean
thats computer ink sir
oh no you are wrong look
there are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written
you didnt take into consideration
that its normal
especially when using
a fluctuating col index to combine
iook here a package containing
shortterm and straight life policies
in an overall insurance portfolio
now you are wasting my time
richard worked on that part sir
that is true bernie
but if you were to look at the back page
where the policy indexes are
youll notice that the remaining policies
are dated after
the policy holder died bernie
you are right
you are absolutely right
gentlemen this is good work
very very good work
thank you bernie
i hate to say this but it appears
as if somebody is trying
to defraud the company
perhaps we should check back records
somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy
no smoking
gentlemen how long have you two
been working here
nineteen months and a week
i am not really sure
a little longer i think
longer i was here before you
no richard i trained you
i came here in january
you came the end of may
i trained you
whatever
what i am saying is that
i think there is a big future here
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves
thank you
but id like to go over these numbers
with you
just to make sure
that youve gotten everything
the only trouble is if someone is trying to
like you said
smoke it past the wrong guy
id like to just keep it confidential
i mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags
no absolutely not
if you would like well work late
yes i mean well work weekends
weekends are very good for me
weekends good idea
give us plenty of time together
no distractions
it is labor day
i got an idea

today was my last day at work
i am going back to college
we could still have
this weekend together right
i am spending it with my folks
are your folks in town
no
is this the intimate evening
i promised you or what
you think theres anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks
hey want to throw her in
how you doing
id invite you to my apartment
but i have five roommates
and they are all at home
doing their hair right now
thats a lot of hair but its clean i like that
its either that or living with my parents
and i dont think thats a good idea
i cant blame you whod want
to live with their folks thats no good
do you have any roommates
no roommates no none
why dont we go to your place
come on baby youre not a woman
are you tell me the truth
okay
why are you tiptoeing
because
the people who live downstairs
theyre very light sleepers
they get angry when i walk
why are you whispering
am i
yes
i am thats because of the walls
they are too thin
make yourself at home
thank you
look at this teak
i mean this whole apartment
sort of 60s style
yeah i know
ive been meaning to redo that for years
no i love it i mean its very hip
i think you have done the place beautifully
i like it its home
you know its a side of you
i never would have expected
im very impressed
are you
yeah
about what
this apartment has got to be expensive
so obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that
is dump the word you are groping for
you didnt like hymies hunan
its a fourstar dive
it was great i loved it
its just that some men
would try to impress women by
pretending to be something they are not
i absolutely agree thats a terrible way
to begin a relationship
pretending to be something you are not
oh god
you dont have to answer this
if you dont want to
but how do you afford a place like this
i dont like to brag
i just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money
but ive made some wise investments
i dabble in the stock market
and of course my parents
were rather well off
do you want to sit
they passed away
yes
they must have been young
oh yeah
i feel i can trust you
they were in a train accident
yeah i mean i dont know
what it was with trains
but they just always liked to travel in trains
i am sorry
how awful for you
yeah
you know i always thought trains
were so much safer than planes
well actually a plane
fell on the train

questions we dont know the answers to
now obviously bernie felt
he owed us something here
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company

not to grant him his final wish
all i am saying is
why dont we just pretend he didnt die
