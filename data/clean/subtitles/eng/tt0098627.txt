to park a car in manhattan every month 
  more than my rent 
  i mean  it s only fair 
his car is a bit bigger than your apartment 
so my apartment is small  it s dark 
it s hot  it s in a high crime area 
beats living with mom and dad 
all right  enough 
it s just until i can afford something decent 
something without
wall to wall cockroaches 
all i have to do is just keep
setting my goals and working hard   
  i ll be fine 
  you are so naive 
  i m sorry 
  excuse me 
go ahead  oh  god 
i hope your aunt feels better 
  what 
  i said   
she said   i hope your aunt feels better  
my aunt  the sick aunt  yes  she is fine

i ll be back 
and i lose again 
i won  i have a date 
  you are kidding 
  no 
gwen and i  thursday night 
8 00 p m   dinner 
  fabulous 
  it was the clumsy approach  it worked 
you are going to want
to borrow my apartment 
no  but thank you  that s sweet 
but i can t do that to you  thank you 
if she finds out you live with your folks 
you will embarrass yourself 
yeah  i know  but i can t do that to you 
it is the cockroaches  isn t it 
  well   
  they scatter when the lights go on 
 y i mr  parker  mr  lomax will see you now 
i feel lucky 
no  i only want the maserati
if it comes in that jet black 
look  if you can t do it for me   
i ll just have to take my business
to another dealer 
yeah 
so paint it  i mean how hard
can this whole thing be 
right 
all right  see  that s better 
see how easy it is to do business with me 
no trade  strictly cash 
right 
all right  good 
gentlemen  what have you got for me 
as you may or may not know  mr  lomax   
larry and i have been  i mean  working 
  where is he going 
  i don t know 
what are we supposed to do 
bet that thing moves  huh  jesus 
  put that back 
  it s a beautiful boat 
you gentlemen were saying   
yes  well 
as you might have heard   
larry and i have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system 
  right 
  thanks 
sir  it s a very big job 
a big job  we have been working hard 
a very big job 
i ve been at it for quite some time 
weekends also 
  weekends  late  and   
  why don t you show him 
thank you 
we ve got something
you should know about 
  got them both there 
  yes  page 28 and 41 
you sure these figures are accurate 
  yes 
  positive 
yes  sir  mr  lomax 
bernie 
call me bernie 
i mean my father is mr  lomax  right 
okay  bernie 
  yes  it s all there in black and white 
  we both worked on this one  bern 
 e  
bernie 
  papers 
  right here  bernie 
if anything has to go 
i am glad it s my vision   
and not the old joystick 
you know what i mean 
that s computer ink  sir 
oh  no  you are wrong  look 
there are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written 
you didn t take into consideration
that it s normal   
especially when using
a fluctuating col index to combine   
iook here  a package containing
short term and straight life policies   
in an overall insurance portfolio 
now you are wasting my time 
richard worked on that part  sir 
that is true  bernie 
but if you were to look at the back page 
where the policy indexes are   
you ll notice that the remaining policies   
are dated after
the policy holder died  bernie 
you are right 
you are absolutely right 
gentlemen  this is good work 
very  very good work 
thank you  bernie 
i hate to say this  but it appears
as if somebody is trying   
to defraud the company 
perhaps we should check back records 
somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy 
no smoking 
gentlemen  how long have you two
been working here 
  nineteen months and a week 
  i am not really sure 
  a little longer  i think 
  longer  i was here before you 
no  richard  i trained you 
i came here in january 
you came the end of may 
i trained you 
whatever 
what i am saying is that
i think there is a big future here   
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves 
thank you 
but i d like to go over these numbers
with you   
just to make sure
that you ve gotten everything 
the only trouble is if someone is trying to   
like you said
 smoke it past the wrong guy    
i d like to just keep it confidential 
i mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags 
no  absolutely not 
if you would like  we ll work late 
  yes  i mean we ll work weekends 
  weekends are very good for me 
weekends  good idea 
give us plenty of time together 
no distractions 
it is labor day 
i got an idea 
how would you two like to come
to my house at the beach 
  me 
  us 
yeah  hampton island 
ever been there  well  you will love it 
when we re not working 
there are distractions 
there are women  swimming 
boating  famous people

  okay 
good  it s settled 
we are going to have a good time 
i guarantee 
my secretary will write down
the directions   
  give you the ferry schedule 
  the ferry schedule 
it s the only way to get there 
unless you have a boat  i don t know 
i have never even been on a boat 
i was once on the staten island ferry
with my folks   
whatever  you come out friday night 
you ll have a great time  i guarantee it 
i ll even drive you back to the city myself
on monday  okay 
we don t know what to say  bernie 
you don t have to say anything 
if you two uncovered what i think
you uncovered   
old bernie here owes you both a great deal 
i mean it sincerely 
now get out of here  go on 
he loves us 
the man absolutely loves us 
you have to kill them  vito

how do you propose to handle it 
let s make it a murder suicide job  all right 
okay  gentlemen 
i ll plant some money  fake a note 
and they can take the rap and   
i won t even have to change the books

thanks for dinner  vito 
i got to go powder my nose 
forget the accident with the two guys 
take care of lomax 
he s getting too careless   
too greedy 
besides   
he s screwing my girlfriend 
but you said we were going to
spend the weekend at the beach 
you heard the conversation 
what am i supposed to do about it 
  bernie 
  what 
i told vito i was going to spend
some time with my mother 
i have to see you  bernie 
cut it out 
  what s wrong with you  wait a minute 
  what 
  i have an idea 
  what 
you are on  9 00 friday night 
i ll be at the apartment 
just use your key  all right 
i ll wear something special 
i bet you never had sweet and sour
matzo balls before 
no 
  i am glad you finally asked me out 
  you are 
i wish you had asked me out sooner 
today was my last day at work 
i am going back to college 
we could still have
this weekend together  right 
i am spending it with my folks 
  are your folks in town 
  no 
is this the intimate evening
i promised you  or what 
you think there s anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk   
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks 
  hey  want to throw her in 
  how you doing 
i d invite you to my apartment 
but i have five roommates 
and they are all at home
doing their hair right now 
that s a lot of hair  but it s clean  i like that 
it s either that or living with my parents 
and i don t think that s a good idea 
i can t blame you  who d want
to live with their folks  that s no good 
  do you have any roommates 
  no  roommates  no  none 
why don t we go to your place 
come on  baby  you re not a woman 
are you  tell me the truth 
okay 
why are you tiptoeing 
because   
the people who live downstairs 
they re very light sleepers 
they get angry when i walk 
why are you whispering 
  am i 
  yes 
i am  that s because of the walls 
they are too thin 
  make yourself at home 
  thank you 
look at this teak 
i mean this whole apartment 
sort of  60s style 
yeah  i know 
i ve been meaning to redo that for years 
no  i love it  i mean  it s very hip 
i think you have done the place beautifully 
i like it  it s home 
you know  it s a side of you
i never would have expected 
i m very impressed 
  are you 
  yeah 
about what 
this apartment has got to be expensive 
so obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that   
is  dump  the word you are groping for 
you didn t like hymie s hunan 
  it s a four star dive 
  it was great  i loved it 
it s just that some men
would try to impress women by   
pretending to be something they are not 
i absolutely agree  that s a terrible way
to begin a relationship 
pretending to be something you are not 
oh  god 
you don t have to answer this
if you don t want to   
but how do you afford a place like this 
i don t like to brag 
i just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money   
but i ve made some wise investments 
i dabble in the stock market 
and of course my parents
were rather well off 
do you want to sit 
they passed away 
yes 
they must have been young 
oh  yeah 
i feel i can trust you 
they were in a train accident 
yeah  i mean i don t know
what it was with trains   
but they just always liked to travel in trains 
i am sorry 
  how awful for you 
  yeah 
you know  i always thought trains
were so much safer than planes 
well  actually  a plane   
fell on the train

of the  y i sunday times book section 
i know  alice  but he won t bend on it 
he says there s no interest
in the subject matter 
pardon me  what s the book about 
whether sherlock holmes
and dr  watson were secretly married 
  eyes  nose  and breasts 
  how much 
a little tuck here  little sand there 
a little lift there

these people 
where did all these people come from 
floating party  happens every weekend 
  like a drink 
  no  thanks 
yeah  i d love some champagne  thanks 
hey  bernie  what a radical party 
got to move your workout
to late tomorrow afternoon  b 
liza s maid is over for the weekend 
and i had to give her your regular time 
thanks  klaus  i got it 
see you  bern

we have to call the police 
here 
  some of the biggest producers 
  yeah 
hello  is this the police  yes   
i got an idea 
i know it s going to sound funny 
but just hear me out 
no  why is the hair on the back of
my neck starting to stand up 
okay  now  we could call the police 
we could do that   
but you know where we d be
spending our weekend   
in some hot police station answering
questions we don t know the answers to 
now  obviously bernie felt
he owed us something here   
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company 
that s why he invited us out here
for the weekend in the first place 
it d be almost disrespectful
not to grant him his final wish 
all i am saying is 
why don t we just pretend he didn t die 
just for a bit 
i don t believe i am hearing this 
i loved that man  he loved me 
i know he loved you 
he d want this
