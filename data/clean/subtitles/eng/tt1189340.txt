can you do that pal
im backing boss
here we go

there we go
now listen theyve uh
put some heavy charges on you louis
the das probably gonna ask
for no bail
no bail
i said theyre gonna ask for it
when was the last time you
were arrested
never
so if i check your your record
youd find parking tickets
are you gonna get me out of here
im gonna try louis
are you the prosecutor who used
to have the roulets case
haller
son of a bitch
rules are rules
i wanted this one
okay okay ill go quletly
but after todays hearing
if you dont object
depends
you going for no bail
that wont change with the prosecutor
not after what your guy did
if he didnt
sure if
bailey picked him in her home
with blood all over him
i love it when you get sarcastic
can i at least see the arrest report
fine you get it from whomever
takes over
no favours on this one
hows hayley today
shes good
good
ill pick her up the usual time
on saturday
because of the seriousness of the
offence
the financial resources of
the accused
the state requests no bail
your honour theres no way
the state can
claim that my client is a flight risk
hes not
with resources like this man has
flight is always a risk
are there any priors
no your honour
then im gonna reduce
the risk of flight
by ordering him to wear
a tracer anklet
and im gonna set bail at 1 million
judge have you seen the photo
ms mcpherson bail is set
thank you judge
mick feel compel to thank me
and speak good of me
cos this ones gonna be the
money im telling you
well see well see
alright this is the lawyer
right there cecil dobbs
hey mick dont forget our deal
possibilty but
oh hes here now
ill talk to you later
cecil dobbs
mr haller
depressing to see the boy caught
up in that cattle call
the boy
i represented the family for a long time
listen my advice is let val fix you
up the bond
and you take the boy home
well we were thinking of putting
up property
theres the windsors beach house
mothers name is windsor
her second husbands name
hes dead now
assessing the house could take days
and trust me you dont want the boy
in the clean cringing that long
so tap val
take louis to your office
ill meet you there at 4
here let me give you
my business card
oh boy
oh media
yeah thatll be on us
mrs windsors sensitive about
the press
i guess theres not much we can

too short
alright lets make it a grand
deal
thats yours
so i can expense this right
of course
absolutely
thank you sticks
thank you
you know mr haller
you werent my choice
i bet i wasnt
firms like yours must have
some heavy hitters on call
we do but louis insisted
frankly ive never heard of you
but uh maybe i should have
did you say i was louis choice
yes he read about a case you had
i need a hundred grand upfront
working on 550 an hour
another hundred if we go to trial
more if we goes pass a week
appeals we start over
i take it thats not a problem
no

where are we headed now
we gotta go meet sticks at jims
the same spot
hmhm
alright
there he is
there we go
eight for me two for you
thank you sticks
anytime
hmhm
hey hey my tape
you dont look good girl
thanks
something new
booked on possession of coke
plus the usual
i know its dumb its
a guy paid me with it and i had
it on me when i went to the next
and the next was a cop
yeah
look cant you get me into
one of those
rehab places that get you straight
we did a pretrial rehab last time
the das never gonna go for it again
you may have to do some
jail time gloria
micky i cant
yes you can yes you can
hey they have programs in jail too
now look youve had a long run
maybe after this youll get on
with your life
yeah
housewife of the year thats me
maybe i can turn some
tricks for the pta
its not funny
id like to see that
alright alright give it to me
alright i uh
i did a guy at the travellers lodge
at santa monica
a guy who paid you with
coke instead of money
yeah and he had a shovel
of coke in there i saw
do you know him
no
he reached me from my website
he was uh
no hes mexican or something
did you screen him
oh i screened them all
okay with what his drivers licence
his passport it was uh
his name uh
his names hector
hector what
um
whats his last name
think gloria think
hector arande moyas
whatd you get if you run a trace
hes a fugitive from a grand jury
down in florida
the da wants him for drug trafficking
and leslie they want him a lot
and your girls looking to trade
she gives you his hotel
and room number
shell also testify on the coke
no location only
you guys take it from there
my best guess is that hector
hasnt checked out yet
and in exchange
you drop all charges
all she does is a prechild rehab
the facility at the
usc med would be nice
or i can take it to the feds
theyll cut this deal in a minute
alright you fucking asshole
after you
youd go head first
id give it a shot if i was
gonna do it
why
star points
youre so vain
nobody cares if you kill yourself
itll look cool
what do you think the last thing
thatd go through your mind
would be
your asshole
mr haller
louis good morning
thank you
its just a start
this is frank levin
franks my investigator
louis roulet
good to meet you
were in here
got a tracer anklet
a present from your friend
mr valenzuela by order of the court
as if id go any place
before this things over
gentlemen welcome
mr dobbs
mr haller
good to see you this is frank levin
mr levin is my investigator
his fees are in addition to mine
of course
gentlemen this is mary windsor
shes louis mother
mr haller
mrs windsor
pleasure to meet you
how do you do
im fine thank you
this is frank levin my investigator
how do you do
the charges against
my son are ridiculous
so is that woman
heres a cheque for you mr haller
this is going to have to come
from your son mrs windsor
you can give him the money
he can write the cheque
but it must come from him
hes my client
and i have to be clear from the start
i cant thank you enough
for being here
sincerely its good to know
that youre gonna be there
when we need you
but not now is that it
no maam the da can make you
testify about what you hear
attorney priviledge does
not cover you
ill see you at home
shes not used to being
told what to do
i can believe that
so how fast can i go to trial
i want this behind me
are you sure
you can stretch it out
and enjoy your freedom
most clients choose to
guilty clients you mean
okay then i insist on
going to trial right away
or perhaps
it never goes to trial at all
my firm can bring uh
considerable influence to bear
oh dont kid yourself cecil
theres no way the states
dropping these charges
as a matter of fact
theyve already upped them
to pronegotiating position
there wont be any negotiating
no plea bargain no nothing
im not going to jail
for something i didnt do
im innocent
and if there is a trial i wanna
take the stand and tell the jury
that im innocent
now if thats a problem
we can part company right now
time to tell me what happened
i was having a drink at
the association
the association
its the bar on 6th street
the one with a lot of young women
right good for pickups
whats the file say
about the girl frank
uh regina campo
known as reggie 26 years old
part time actress
part time office temp
and hoping to retire after
suing my client
did you know her before
last night louis
no ive seen her around but
we never spoke she was
always with another guy
last night too
i got it that she wasnt too
into her date
she brushed by me on
her way to the bathroom
and she basically just laid her
address on me on a napkin
she said she could get rid
of him by 10
do you still have it
what she wrote down
no i didnt keep the napkin
check that file see if the
police report has any of this
frank here has already
worked us a little miracle
he uh happened to score us
a copy of the discovery file
everything the da has
they would have had
to turn it over eventually
but it wouldve taken a while
no they dont have the other guy
they dont even have the bar
so what all theyve got is
louis shows up at her apartment
and she gets beaten
that is such bullshit
just keep telling me your story
okay
i got there early
and uh waited until he came out
did you see what he was driving
a blue mustang
alright so he comes out you go in
she saw it was me
and opened the door
uh the hallway was tight
so i had to
walk pass her you know
so she closed the door
so my back was to her and um
that was it
what was it
she hit me with something
i got down
and everything got black fast
show me where she hit you
right here
still hurts
and that blow knocked you out
next i know 2 faggots were
sitting on me holding me down
police report has it homosexual
couple from across the hall
theyre dressed like faggots
i stand corrected
faggot couple from across the hall
go on louis
i was still foggy when the cops came
my names officer maxwell i just
need to ask you a few questions
can you tell me your name please
reggie campo
do you know this gentleman
you met him before
no
and thats when i saw shed set me up
set it up how
she put blood on my hand
my left hand
he said he was gonna rape me
and kill me
and then he said he was gonna
come back here and rape me again
you said she left the door
open a crack
did you happen to see her face
not all of it
mainly her eye
wait her left eye
yes
alright so she already
had the injuries
to the right side of her face
she opens the door
conceals that from him
and as he enters
she she clobbers him
so our case is what
she beat herself up
if she already had the injuries
she either did just that or
she had a boyfriend do it
she must have i mean she saw
louis maserati his watch
its known the family has money
ill weight you should be filing in
civil court the moment this is over
lets hear the police report
hows reggie telling
okay according to the victim
she was at home alone when the suspect
presented himself at the door
as someone she knew
upon letting him in
she was immediately struck
does it say he knocked her down
yes there was a
struggle that continued
from the hallway to the stairs
he held the victim by the neck
and forced her down
suspect maintained the position
behind her
holding a knife against
the left side of her throat
thats not my knife
are his prints all here frank
well stands to reason
if she put blood on his hand
she put his prints on the knife
i just told you though
that isnt my knife
keep talking frank
as ms campo ran for the stairs
they fought and she kept
the intruder backwards
realising her attacker had her
cornered she fought free and
seized a nearby bottle of vodka
and thats when she clogged him
thats her story
those are all lies
look if everything
shes saying is a lie
then this is going to
be the easiest case ever
but you swear its all lies
all of it
are you sure theres not anything
that youre not telling me
nothing
why did he choose you mick
rich kid spoiled as shit
never heard the word no
yeah but the damn thing is
the way he tells his story frank
just quite enough to be true
i dont know mick
this kid feels wrong to me
but ill check out his story
all of it you know the rules
start at the association bar
and then this regina campo
the way he said she came on to her
sounds like a pro
yeah write it down
also mr uh mr mustang
alright now i still dont get
how that works
what he and reggie got into some
rough train then he punched her
unless he was in on it
meaning he hit her afterwards
bingo
jesus mick are you starting
to think louis is innocent
he just might
besides you know my father always
said about an innocent client
no ive never heard this hi
he said theres no client
as scary as an innocent man
thats right
cos if you screw up and
he goes to prison
youre never gonna be able
to live with yourself
so theres only one verdict
you can put on the board baby
and thats an ng
what do you say mags
frank if you let a man drive
home in this condition
i think that i can charge you both
ill take him to his house
how are you gonna get home
earl could pick up the
car for me in the morning
i came with friends whoo
later
thank you baby
no no i got this
i insist
what
moonlight becomes you
youre not doing me any good haller
hey mick
jesus frank what couldnt wait
wanna watch a movie
we caught a break
the owner had a camera system
set up last month
i had the security tape
transferred to a disk
so i could manipulate
i know this place
alright theres our boy louis
and i would like you to meet
ms reggie campo
and theres mr mustang
are you sure
i wouldnt have popped a grand
for the tape if i wasnt sure
now watch
reggie gets up
goes to the ladies room
mr mustang chats up the bartender
so thats where he goes
and give reggie her chance
watch her
wait thats not how he said
it went down
he said she gave him
her address on a napkin
okay hold on hoss hold on
let her go pee okay here she comes
theres your napkin
now watch this
she and mr mustang decided
its time to split
look look look at his hand
look at his watch
so hes left handed thats no good
facial blows are from the left
this guys right handed
mick you havent been
drinking enough
you said you knew the association
you would realise this shot is
into the mirror behind the bar
cos thats where the owner set up the
camera so he could watch his register
everything is backwards
and mr mustang punches with his left
yeah you proud of yourself frank
i really really am
but not just about this
that feeling i had about reggie
that she was selling it
i did a little bit of research
shes our girl
you tell me the cops dont have this
how can they theres only
one and its not a copy
then make a copy
what youre gonna give
it to the prosecutor
yeah a new guy named ted minton
hes gonna hand over
the discovery file
oh poor bunny
hes not gonna know what hit him
how long til you think
your mans back
i dont know
probably just a few more minutes
mr haller
there he is
sorry to keep you waiting
the discovery file
i hope this will be worth your while
kinda light
you have somewhere we can play this
what else do you have
what else do i have
come on minton
lets cut the bullshit here
alright not only your
socalled victim a prostitute
but i have her soliciting
my guy on video
you think the jurys gonna see this
and think he had to rape her at
knife point just to have sex with her
no
are you listening to what im saying
yes and it doesnt change the
offer im prepared to make
offer
you going forward
we will drop down to
assault with the deadly
attempted sexual battery
guidelines put that on
7 years maybe hell do 4
what am i missing here
hey frank
whats up
look here
these files look identical to me
alright theres something were
missing and were not seeing it
well heres the discovery file i got
from my clerk in the das office
and this is the one i got from minton
reggie campo
reggie
heres the door chain
uhmhmm
come on its the same
wow wow wow
here we go here we go here we go
son of a bitch
they switched up the files
this is a different knife
hmhm
ive been taking care of this
guy for 10 years
and he set me up
well hes off the christmas list
hes on the shit list
good shot eddie
thank you jack
looks a little short to me
you guys finish up
ill see you later
theyve closed down anyway
alright
louis
so what happened did you see minton
oh i saw him
we need to talk
you lied to me louis
you didnt tell me you were
paying reggie campo for sex
i dont go lookin surprised couldve
easily told me that in cecils office
i dont want my mother to find out
cecil tells her everything
oh so you decided to keep
from me the one thing
that couldve made this trial go away
huh
is that what minton said
no more trial
i said could have
if that had been the only
lie you told me
what do you mean
recognise that
its a picture of your knife
the one you had on you
when you went to reggies
the one the cops have
thats why ted minton didnt focus
to answer shit why should he
when hes got a knife
with her blood and your initial
that wasnt the knife that was
in the file
thats right it wasnt
the file frank got is what
we call a loaded deck
the cops use it to set us up to make
us think they didnt have anything
when in fact theyve got enough
to put your golf playing ass
away for 20 years big boy
why did you lie about the knife
louis why would you lie
about anything
everything you tell mes confidential
attorney client priviledges
alright i didnt lie i said the
knife in the picture wasnt mine
i said it twice and
nobody listened to me
what are you now the goddamn lawyer
you said it wasnt yours
what you shouldve said was
i had a knife mick
but this isnt it
you brought a weapon to a
meeting with a prostitute
you tell me
how the hell am i supposed
to make that look like she set you up
i did not do this
its custom made
its a razor tip
its got your initials engraved
on the handle
i always carry it
we show homes to people we dont know
theres one time
my mother was showing a place
it was in bel air so she
thought it was okay to go alone
he was there
who was there
the man who raped her
when she didnt come back
i went to the house and found her
thats when she stopped
showing property
and i started carrying a knife
always
your mother will have to testify

hey you okay
whereve you been today
ive been trying to call you
ive been to san quentin
to see jesus martinez
about what happened after
he left donna renterias apartment
after he killed her
he didnt kill her frank
he went there
he had sex
flushed the condom down the toilet
wiped his his prick on a pink
towel and then he went home
but he didnt kill her
come on mick weve been
through this a hundred times
the real killer
she lets him in
maybe uh he faked like
he was martinezs friend
and acted like he had an appointment
like the guy in the bar
right he comes in he punches her
he tries to snuff her out
shes not gonna be lucky
like reggie campo
cos this time
the bitch pulls a knife
he takes her and dings her
over the table
puts on a condom and rapes her
and when hes done
she was stabbed over and over
52 times while he worked something
out of his sick goddamn mind
do i have to tell you
what kind of knife it was
a short blade folding knife
just like roulets
okay okay lets take it a
little bit easier on that okay
why frank why didnt i listen
now listen
listen i got a baseball bat
if you really wanna beat yourself up
no
i dont wanna beat myself up son
of a bitch told me he didnt do it
alright there was the dna
and there was the knife
that he ditched
but there was no way i was
gonna listen to him
there was no way i would
believe that he didnt do it
i couldnt believe him
i couldnt believe that i actually
could represent an innocent man
just like my father warned me about
mick come on
they all said they didnt do it
you know that
so what did i do
i get him to plead
i get his sister to beg him to plead
cos he got no case
so i gave him the best deal i can
you know i feel pretty
goddamn good about it
cos hey i got the son
of a bitch off death row
i got him 15 years
instead of the needle
yeah
i showed him roulets picture
okay
roulet is using martinez
as the other guy in the bar
like mr mustang in this case
so hes not just getting off
and killing women
its seeing somebody else do
the time thats his mo
what did martinez say
enough
enough for me to know
i gotta i gotta find
what you gotta do
is find a way to put roulet in
renterias apartment the night
she was murdered
thats what you gotta do
i have to find a way
to make it right frank
i gotta make it right
well you cant bring him to
the cops cos hes your client
and you cant take him to the
da cos youll lose your licence
worse any evidence we found
would be inadmissible
attorney client priviledge
itll ruin any case that we
could ever have against him
thats why the
son of a bitch hired me
hes got me in his trick bag
you got one client in jail
for what your other client did
what are you gonna do mick
hey mick you okay buddy
frank frank listen to me i got it
what
you know how roulet said all
well find on him
is parking tickets right
right
listen i dont buy that anymore
now there are others
other girls he did
renteria and campo i mean
they look too much alike
like their sisters
and the injury to the
right side of their face
is too similar man
this guys got a type frank
there are other cases out there
and you could find them
alright you gotta do this i cant
im his lawyer
okay okay im on it
alright i gotta take this
maggie hey
hey did you get my voicemail
uh ive been up at san quentin
to see an old client
hows hayley
shes good
shes got soccer this weekend
saturday right
hmhm
i look forward to it
great talk later
if youre wondering how i got in
im in real estate so if i
wanna get into a friends house
no were not friends
youre my client
im your lawyer
my lawyer
see thats exactly what
i wanted to remind you of
im about to go on trial
and yet
i cant reach you
now i found out where
you were all day
heard you tell maggie
you shit
you went to see jesus martinez
and i know what you talked about
donna renteria
youre right mick
i killed her
there no reason i shouldnt tell
my own lawyer
since its all confidential
attorney client priviledge
isnt that what you told me
its time for you to go louis
alright
thats a cute picture
of your daughter hayley
shes very pretty
shes got soccer
practice tomorrow right
dont
dont what
you think youre the first client to
ever threaten me with my family huh
all i said was shes pretty
are you scared louis
because where you are right now
youre in a very dangerous place
and so in conclusion
what this case is about
what this case is all about
is a predator
on that night of march 6th
louis roulet was out stalking
his prey
now youre going to hear from the
victim herself about her lifestyle
one that we would not condone
but remember
anyone
anyone
can be a victim of a violent crime
this case is clear
its straight forward
a man attacked a woman in her home
in order to rape and kill her
and it is only by the grace of god
that shes here to tell her story
ladies and gentlemen
my name is michael haller
and im representing louis roulet
now mr minton
doesnt wanna use the
word prostitute
for the woman who was
supposed to be louis victim
he neednt worry
because this case isnt about
how she makes her money
this case is about her actions
how she saw a young man with
signs of wealth
as a ticket out of the life
she was in
and chose to target him
now what she didnt count on
was you
how you put two and two together
and let your common sense tell you
who the real predator is
in this case
thank you for your time
the court will adjourn until monday
and the state will
call its first witness
go hayley go turn turn turn
left foot left foot
hey mick

he asked for me
okay okay thats true man
thats true

i would lie about this
give me a little respect
give me a little credit
im not gonna lie about
this kind of shit
the police checked the tracer
that you put on roulet
it says he was no way
near franks house
so maybe it wasnt him mick

so maybe it wasnt him
nobody can beat the tracer huh
it was him roulet killed frank
val it was roulet
i dont like
i dont like the way youre
following me
i dont like the way you
corner me man

kid loose so he could murder frank
crazy roulet killed frank
mick im sorry about frank

that couldve taken it off him
being married to you sucked

alright listen
whoever came to the door
thats your killer
okay you get me a copy of the tape
im gonna get it to you right away
how is it going with the case
you getting somewhere
yeah uh we did catch a break
we found a bullet casing in
the room from a 22
thats good frank levin owned a 22
youll find it registered to him
yeah we did yeah but uh
it wasnt a woodsman
a what
a colt woodsman
its an old antique job
thats the gun that killed him
morning mick
its too bad about frank levin
got any idea who did it
yeah im pretty certain i do
mr talbot
you were with ms campo on
the night of march 6th
yupe we went on a date
to the association
then i took her back to her place
for another date
and did you have sexual relations
about four hundred bucks worth
and she earned every single cent
what time did you leave her apartment
oh i dont know uh
about 5 minutes before 10
did she say whether she
had another appointment
oh no no she acted like
she was done for the night
objection your honour
i dont think mr talbots qualified
to interpret
ms campos thinking or plans
i mean she acted satisfied
sustained go on mr minton
when you left mr talbot
what condition was she in
was she hurt
no she was fine
she did not look like this
man
what kind of sick bastard
that did something like that
answer the question
no
no we made pleasurable
and consensual love
i mean thats what lifes
all about right
that i paid her
mr talbot are you a right handed
or left handed
left
left
yeah
isnt it true that before you left
ms campos apartment
she asked you to repeatedly strike
her in the face with your left fist
your honour mr hallers
just muddying
the water with outrageous statements
part of the defense theory
your honour
the witness can answer
im sorry
can you repeat the question
this is by your hand isnt it
mr talbot
admit it this whole thing
is a setup
by you and ms campo
framing my client
louis roulet isnt it
i never hit her or any other woman
you understand
do you know a prostitute named
shaquille barton
working name is uh
shaquilla shackles
yeah yeah i seen her once
and if i brought her in here
and she say yes mr talbot
he he did strike me
with his left fist in my face
shed be lying
i tried shaquilla once
im not into that rough stuff
im a missionary man
with a strong left
am i on trial here
not yet
good afternoon detectives
what can i do for you
this warrant is bullshit
well its good enough
to search your house
it wouldve been smart if youd
told me that you had a woodsman
theres one registered to you
lets go for a drive
alright
lets bag the box
cant do ballistics on a box can you
modern technology
so uh why didnt you
report this stolen
i dont know
maybe i should have
you think
still and all were gonna have
a look around the place huh
go crazy you got the warrant
alright start with the couch
sir
stand up
hey you know
we got a history on the piece
turns out
it once belonged to micky cowen
the gangster from the 40s
i know my father
he uh represented him
got him off for using it
for self defence so
micky made him the present of it
nice present
pearl handle collectors piece
how sweet
you know that uh
that micky cowen shooting
its its pretty famous
it turns out that the county
still has the evidence on storage
the bullet
you can match the casing from
a slug thats 50 years old
it would be easier with
the gun but
yeah
how long will ballistics take
hey mick
i got something for you
you asked me to find
out that witness name
is it corliss
dwayne geoffrey corliss right
hes just low life type
not much came up
but sometimes he goes by dj
with punctuation and when
you read it that way
tell me
well hes played the
courtroom snitch a lot
here and in arizona
both times
they got him early release
alright this could be good
all i gotta do is find him
they put him on a pretrial
rehab at usc
i just got lucky
there she is
how are you sweety
you alright
alright listen
im actually not in here about you
i need you to do something for me
keep moving
lets go lets go
stay on the wall all the way down
thats the bucks boys lets go
stay on the line
corliss right
i only came to say what is required
rusky ready for the line
you dont know me
you talk to the da
he can get a way
to get both of us out
step through
so haller you had an
interesting visitor last night
worry about yourself ted
youre dying the death
of a thousand razors
up there and you dont even know it
one last witness your honour
the prosecution calls regina campo
its true that i uh
lied to the police
i knew the defendant
when he came to the door
ms campo
why did you lie
because im scared
i didnt think the
police would believe me
and i wanted to make sure
they arrested him
cos hes an animal
do you regret your decision now
yes
if it helps him get free
and do this to somebody else
objection
thats prejudiciary your honour
sustained
i have no further
questions for ms campo
your witness mr haller
ms campo
have you engaged to an attorney
to sue louis roulet for the events
that happened on the eve of march 6th
no i havent
have you talked to an attorney
i havent hired anyone
no have you talked to one
about a possible lawsuit
it was nothing more than talk
did you ask him if you
could sue him for damages
i thought what you say
to lawyers is private
if you wish you can tell the jurors
i think id like to keep it private
good
lets talk about the night
at the association bar
have you ever seen louis roulet
before that night
yes there and other places
ever noticed that he wore
a rolex watch
no
or that he drove one of 2 vehicles
a maserati and a range rover
i never saw him driving
and what made you approach him
i saw him leave with girls uh
who do what i do
with prostitutes
then go to a hotel or one of
their apartments right
i dont know where
well how do you know they left
maybe they just went out for a smoke
because i saw them getting
in his car
and drive away
no wait a minute
you just testified that you
had never seen mr roulet drive
now youre saying that yes you did
see mr roulet get in his car
and leave with a
prostitute like yourself
which one is it
i saw him get in his car but i
didnt know what kind of car it was
you know the difference between
a maserati and a range rover
one is small one is big i guess
okay
the other women
had left with louis
when you saw them again
did any of them ever have
injuries or any of them beaten
i dont know i didnt ask
but girls in your profession
you do talk to each other
about customers right
you warned each other
if someones a freak or something
yeah usually
and did any of them
ever warned you or have
one bad thing to say about
louis roulet
no
no one
so you believed youd be safe
i thought he was a known quantity
and i needed the money so
so you thought he could
solve your problems with money
no
no
isnt that why youre sitting here
because you zeroed in on him
no
i mean yes but it wasnt like that
he attacked me i swear
and alright
lets pause that right there
just to confirm this is you
right ms campo
yes
what was on the napkin
my name and address
and your price
yes 400
its a hard line of work
yes and dangerous
in fact havent you told
your friends many times
that you were looking for a way out
im not proud of what i do
i know
and isnt it true
and nothing will be
easier to understand
that you saw louis roulet
and his money as that way out
no thats not what this is about
are you not listening to me
no further questions your honour
mr minton
do you have another witness for us
minton looks worried
not worried enough
no
the state rests your honour
then the defense will call
its first witness after lunch
yes i recognise this knife
its the one that my son has
carried with him for protection
for the last 4 years almost exactly
why would he need protection
realtors alone in the house
are sometimes robbed or
hurt
and raped or murdered
has louis ever been
the subject to such crime
oh no
but he knew someone who was
raped and robbed by a man
louis found her
it was terrible
so the first thing he did afterwards
was getting himself a knife
to carry it with him at all times
thank you ms windsor
i have no further questions
your honour
your witness mr minton
ms windsor
you seemed pretty exact
about when it was your son
started carrying around this
this weapon
a five inch folding knife
yes i am
the incident took
place on june 9th 2007
was it in the newspapers
do you somehow remember it because
the police came to talk to louis
no there was no police investigation
then how do you
remember the exact date
were you given it before
your testimony here today
i remember the date because
ill never forget the date
i was attacked
and louis wont forget it either
he found me in the house tied up
my clothes were ripped
it was traumatic for him
mr minton
is there anything else
you wish to ask
no your honour
ive been thinking about those
thousand razors
weve had an offer
you spend 6 months in the county jail
like i told you from the beginning
no deals no bargaining im innocent
save it you make the call
i dont give a shit
you got my answer
yes i do
ill pass it along
you do that
oh louis
tomorrow
im putting you on the stand
im ready
oh youd better be
hey earl
theres something
i need you to get for me
your honour the defense
calls louis ross roulet
i knocked uh she looked
through her side window
and saw that it was me
and opened the door
then i walked pass her towards
the living room
what happened next
something hit me from behind
i blacked out
i have no idea for how long
is that all
when i woke up uh
two guys were sitting on me
telling me not to move
i couldnt anyway i was
i was scared
but you had blood on your sweater
and on your left hand
someone put it there because i didnt
you didnt strike mscampo
with your left fist
no
threatened to rape her
no
threatened to kill her
no i am not that guy
i
do you have any idea what its like
to be accused of something like this
to sit there
and listen to people tell lies
about you about you having done
something this sick and depraved
call you an animal
talk about your sex life
humiliate you
listen i understand the process
i know i had to sit there
and better be qulet
and wait my chance
but if guilty people have rights
then what about innocent people
i am innocent
im innocent and
i want this behind me
i have no further questions
your honour
according to you
ms campo punched
herself
or she had
someone she had never met
violently and visciously beat
her as a part of a set up
all i know is that i didnt
and this knife that you always carry
how did she know shed find it
on you as part of the set up
guess she couldnt could she
i never take it out
i never show it to anyone
so she must have just found
it in my pocket after
she or whoever knocked me out
isnt that right
i would prefer if i ask the questions
okay
mr roulet id like you to take uh
take a look at this photo
tell me again
do you think
regina campo would or could
have done this to herself
i dont know who did it
but it wasnt me
nobody deserves that to happen
what do you mean by deserves
do you mean crimes of violence
only comes down to a woman
getting what she deserves
i mean no matter what she does
or who she is
no woman deserves that
i have nothing further your honour
mr roulet youre excused
thank you
the defense rests your honour
before deciding to rest this case
the state would like to take
the night your honour
for what purpose
to consider a rebuttal witness
what witness is he talking about
i have no idea
the court will adjourn
til 10 oclock tomorrow
morning bill
morning
im gonna go grab some coffee
you want some
no man im off caffeine

mr minton
does the state have any rebuttal
the state intends to call
dwayne geoffrey corliss
as a rebuttal witness your honour
judge who is this witness
and why wasnt i told about
him until now
bailiff
remove the jury
a fair question
mr minton
dwayne corliss is
a cooperating witness
who spoke with mr roulet in custody
following arrest
thats a lie
i didnt speak to anyone
qulet mr roulet
mr haller control your client
let me take it from here
judge i share my clients outrage
how long has the state been
sitting on this testimony
mr corliss just came forward
yesterday your honour
yesterday
this is incredible
do you want to go back
and talk to him
given the time id allow it
no thank you though judge
i think we all know what this is
mr mintons putting
a jailhouse snitch on the stand
and everything he says will be a lie
thats groundless your honour
i want my objection noted
then im going to rule
he can testify
call the jury in
may i ask one indulgence your honour
may i step into the hallway and
make a call to an investigator for
whatever good it may do
at this late date
thank you your honour
yupe im here
come into the court house at
exactly 1015 with the printouts
mr corliss
are you incarcerated at this time
um
no now im just in the courtroom
but you are currently being held in
a jail ward at usc hospital correct
yeah since i got arrested
for burglary and drug possession
thats right
now
do you know the defendant

then we were together in the tank
when we came for first appearances

yeah
talk about how bad are the cigarettes
anything else
uh you know what are you in for
like that
and did he say what he was in for
he said for giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved
those were his words
for giving a bitch
exactly what she deserved

else promised you
anything in exchange for
your testimony today
no
just the right thing to do
thank you your honour
how many times have you
been arrested mr corliss
about 7 times in la
couple more in phoenix
and new york
if you wanna count those
yeah so you know how the
system works i would say
i tried to survive
does that sometimes mean
ratting out fellow inmates
your honour i object
take a seat mr minton
i gave you leeway for
bringing this witness in

what im asking you is how
many times have you snitched
on a fellow inmate
this makes me four
this makes your fourth time
four times youve testified
for the prosecution
against a fellow inmate
makes you a popular man mr corliss

come up to you
and they tell you the
crimes theyve committed
so you can come in here and
testify against them
people talk to me im a friendly guy
youre a friendly guy
and youre saying you and
my client were friends
louis roulet
so he just said to you
what you just told us and
told the jury that
that he gave a woman
what she deserved

back to talking about cigarettes

told me he did it before
he said the other time
he killed the bitch
got away with it then
can get away with it now

well
like he told me the details
of the other one
that he killed
she was a dancer
at some club

sexy snake tattoo
wrapped around her body
did he say anything else
hm no

snake girl stuff was it
how does he know this louis

thats okay
you can take your time
well make it through it
a man frederick bentley
wrongly convicted of rape
was released saturday after
conclusive dna results
cleared him of the crime
the case was bolstered at trial by
a testimony from an informant
dj corliss in may 7th
who would claimed
bentley bragged to him about
the rape
while together in a holding cell
thats enough
thank you
mr corliss
were you charged with perjury
in this incident dj
no i was not
is that because the prosecution
was complicit to your confession
judge
were you promised the same
thing here mr corliss
to say that louis roulet bragged
to you in the holding cell
isnt that what happen
you lie then
you lie now
