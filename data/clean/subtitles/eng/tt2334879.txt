what time does my wife get in 
  eighteen forty five 
  wake me if civilisation ends 
  welcome home  sir 
  thank you 
hummingbird  you are released 
tell me we don t have the best job
in the world 
i believe the number one source
of violence in our world is poverty 
now  we were poor in my neighbourhood 
sometimes we couldn t even eat 
and my best friend ricky 
he had it worse than us 
one day things got
so desperate for ricky   
   he made a plan
to rob the corner store 
and i told my mother about it 
you know what she did 
she had him over 
cooked him a full meal   
   and told him that he could stay with us
as long as he wanted 
and it was then that i realised
that if you feed a man   
you take away his propensity
for violence 
come on  we re gonna be late 
hey  hey  hey 
no  no  no  that s    no  that s not   
that s not   
this is not happening right now 
clyde  we ve had this conversation 
my boss does not like squirrels 
it s a bird feeder 
will you at least look at me
when i m talking to you 
look  man  i like squirrels personally 
but you re getting me in trouble 
do you see this 
you know what this is 
hey  we gonna need backup 
we re working  come on 
  we have any more robitussin 
  yes  sir  in the car 
no  i ll get it  it s all right 
quiet night 
we re under attack by squirrels 
they re organised
and they have the numbers 
little stinkers trying to get
into the feeder 
  morning 
  hey  roy 
this isn t the most glamorous job
in the world 
look  i appreciate it very much 
  yeah  we ll be there in 10 minutes 
  as leaders  we have a choice 
we can sit back
and let the same cycle of war   
   continue in the middle east
or we can do something about it 
you know how much money
we ve spent on the war since 2001 
over a trillion dollars 
could you imagine if you had   
it s gonna be a busy morning  boys 
   education  food  health care
and infrastructure in the middle east 
now  we ve begun historic talks
with the republic of iran s   
   newly elected president  al sharif   
   to build peace throughout his region 
america can t do this alone 
we need the full financial support
of all of our allies 
but what we can do
is take the first step 
therefore  i m announcing today   
   that all u s  troops will be removed
from the middle east 
let s not repeat the same mistakes
that we made in the past 
and lord knows 
i ve made some mistakes myself 
instead  i ask you
to stand with me today 
sign this treaty  let s end
this debilitating pattern of violence   
   and let s show the world that the pen
is truly mightier than the sword 
thank you 
president sawyer delivered what can
only be described as a historic speech   
     earlier today in geneva 
  here 
  let s go live   
  you changed your hair 
last week 
i m gonna be late tonight 
i love you very much 
good morning  sir 
john  what do you think
of the president s proposal 
i don t know  it s good
to have less enemies  i guess 
you re a military man 
you don t think he s putting us at risk 
that s a little above my pay grade 
if you feel that way   
     why didn t you run against him 
  no  no  no 
that s one job i never wanted 
i like my office 
i like my constituents 
i like being a thorn in the side
of the administration 
but i think voters today
want somebody cool 
oh  come on  mr  speaker 
i think you re pretty cool 
he went to bed at 8 and watched   
the president has a call scheduled
with the speaker at 9 30 
  i should be there for that  shouldn t i

in case of a deadlock

  john

i will owe you so much more
than just candlelight dinner 
  i ll make a call 
  perfect  thank you  you re the best 
   a truly historic handshake 
what president sawyer is proposing
to iranian president al sharif   
   is withdrawing all american troops
across the entire middle east   
   and for that he ll ask
his g8 partners for help 
it s all about money

  hey  tom 
  hey  buddy 
so how is your blog coming along 
nobody says  blog  anymore  john 
what do you mean 
they don t say  blog  
  i just learned  blog  
  hi  hi 
just for 20 seconds 
act like you don t hate me 
  i m carol finnerty 
  hi  john 
  carol 
  cale 
oh  my god  carol wilkes 
actually  i m carol finnerty now 
you re deputy special agent finnerty 
oh  you re jenna s favour 
this is emily 
this is em  my daughter 
my father is a very special man 
it s nice to meet you 
i paid her to say that 
  let s get started 
  okay 
i don t know  just   
sorry  i gotta ask 
you didn t marry jim finnerty
from sigma chi  did you 
  that guy was   
  an asshole  yes  he was 
this is my colleague 
special agent todd 
standard secret service
protocol requires   
   a two agent review for every interview 
you re not to look at agent todd 
  i m sorry  i just looked at him 
  you re only to look at me 
so we just    okay 
the subject is john cale 
born 1980 
grew up in the district of columbia   
   graduated hill high in 1999 
looks like you ve bounced
from job to job 
mechanic  limo driver  construction 
is my credit score in there 
yes  and you should be ashamed
of yourself 
it s a recession  okay 
married melanie schopp in 2002   
   and had a child six months later 
filed for divorce in 2005 
so you did three tours
in afghanistan   
   and you were wounded
in the kunar province 
  yes  ma am 
  you received a silver star   
   for pulling a corporal dawson
from a burning humvee 
there was an ied attack 
humvee flipped  we were taking fire 
so i grabbed him 
  why 
  i was a little concerned   
   that he was getting
a little too warm in there 
it s funny to me  you still think glib
is the way to go here 
corporal dawson is the nephew
of the speaker of the house   
   and when you were discharged
a year ago   
   he got you a job
with the capitol police 
actually  on his protection detail 
if special agent todd
keeps making those sounds   
     i m gonna start looking at him 
  will you give us a second  please  ryan 
john  why do you want to be
in the secret service 
i can t think of a more important job
than protecting the president 
okay  this job requires
a university degree 
you dropped out of gw
after our first semester there 
  you don t finish things 
  check the file  carol 
two years in college night school 
a certificate of graduation
should be in there 
great 
yeah  john  you barely maintained
a c average 
i m sorry  i didn t have
our little study sessions   
   like we used to back in the day 
did i 
evaluations from your senior officers 
 cale frequently does not complete
his field reports on time  
nothing to do
with protecting someone 
 sergeant cale demonstrates
a lack of respect for authority  
 sergeant cale has raw potential
but seems determined not to realise it  
you can keep reading that 
that is not me anymore 
i m not the kid
you used to know in college 
i ve buttoned up every single thing
that i have to to qualify for this job 
i have 10 times more experience
than any ivy league kid 
it s not just about experience  i would
need to depend on you every day 
what do you want me to do 
i ll start at the   
i ll start at the bottom 
just give me a chance 
i m sorry 
did you get the job 
  yeah  i think i got a shot 
  really 
you know how it is 
they gotta go talk
amongst themselves and   
these    look  these things 
they can be really political 
good morning

   of other exciting sights
to show you guys 
follow me this way 
now  does anyone wanna guess
how old the white house is 
  yes 
  two hundred and twenty two years old 
that s very accurate 
construction began in 1792   
   on what was then called
the president s house 
now  article 1  section 8
of the u s  constitution set forth   
   that a district of no more than
10 miles square   
   should house the new seat
of government  does anyone know why 
so no one state could claim
the president s house 
right again 
you re a real keener  aren t you 
now  the founders were crafty   
hey  so you can tell me the truth 
do you get picked on a lot in school

now 
and that is an order 
yes  sir 
now  not too many people
realise this   
   but the white house
is actually three buildings 
the east wing
where you guys came in   
   the west wing  which houses
the oval and executive offices   
   and we re about to enter the residence 
which is the famous building that   
   got blown up in independence day 
  what s in there 
that s the president s home theatre 
membership has its privileges 
right this way
through the double doors  please 
there s still lots more to see 
you got a visitor 
hey 
  could you stay with the tour 
  yeah 
thank you 
the white house is big 
including below ground levels 
it s six storeys tall   
   with 132 rooms  412 doors 
147 windows  28 fireplaces   
   and 35 bathrooms 
the grounds contain a tennis court 
a basketball court   
   a putting green  a jogging track
and a swimming pool 
  and where s the peoc

emergency operations centre

  emily cale 
emily cale  go ahead

  how i look on that thing 
i wasn t ready for a press conference 
how do you expect 22 arab nations
with different regional   
   and religious interests
to agree on a single treaty   
   especially given the newly
erupting conflicts   
   between the shiites and the sunnis
in southern pakistan 
tough question 
to be honest with you  i don t know 
whether they ll agree or not   
   i m not sure  but i gotta try 
the day we stop believing
different people can come together   
   is the day we ve given up on the world 
i m not ready to 
what i am ready to do
is give a little girl   
   a shout out on her youtube blog

we have got hundreds   
as you can see 
the military s moving into position

my name is martin james walker 
chief of the presidential detail
of the secret service 
my men currently control the
white house and the 61 hostages within

   of sending you out of here 
so let s just keep it professional  okay

   the united states federal reserve
holds in excess of  400 million in cash

   which you will leave fuelled and
otherwise empty on runway one niner 
i d like to know how you plan
on getting from the white house

without being killed 
we have eyes in the sky 
if i see a single sniper   
   within 10 miles of this place 
i am going to kill   
   four cabinet members   
   and in a particularly nice
touch of irony   
   the director
of homeland security himself 
is president sawyer alive 
  yes 
  i want proof of life 
you got two hours
or i will execute him myself   
   on the south lawn
of the white house 
jesus  the head of his own detail

secret service member

we need to find out how walker
found these guys 
  john  you ve gotta turn on the news

i m so sorry 
what you are seeing really is
just amazing footage   
   captured by an extremely brave
young girl by the name of emily cale 
now  these are the first images coming
to us from inside the white house   
   from inside this hostage situation 
the images have gone viral  they ve
had more than a hundred million   
wait  cale  cale  listen 
we re all walking out of here together 
okay 
i gotta go get her 
  captain 
  yes  sir 
get me facial recognition
on everyone in that video now 
   very brave young girl
named emily cale 
the hostages include the nine girls   
   from watkins charter school
in louisville   
   five cabinet members as well   
   and also  understandably 
a very emotional roger skinner 
and from what i understand now   
i got the president a scrambled
satphone to call his family with 
he keeps it in his bedside table
in the residence  see if it s still there 
no  no 
vadim  would you be kind enough
to confirm your last name for me  please 
  let s go 
  they re in the residence 
go  that s them in the residence 
easy 
   and the faces of the terrorists 
you gotta be shitting me 
so we are going to put those faces
up on screen right now   
in here 
as we put these faces up on screen 
we are sure that we will   
   no doubt learn the names
of the men who are   
   holding the white house hostage 
these men are clearly not al qaeda 
we are positive
that the fbi will have   
   those images out 
so again  these are images   
   captured by a brave young girl   
how many more ways can you guys
screw this thing up 
hey 
how you like your chair 
you comfortable  mr  skinner 
let me ask you a question 
where do you come up with
all the ideas for your show 
  i   
  you got guys who do that for you 
because  believe me 
i got some good ideas 
hey 
give it to me 
congratulations  asshole 
you just made us all famous 
when they come for us 
you re gonna die first 
get away from me 
  you understand 
  get away from me 
sir  we have facial recognition
coming up right now 
carl killick 
this guy s a right wing sociopath 
first arrested at age 12 
tried to blow up his local post office   
   because they employed
too many african americans 
last seen with conrad cern 
i saw that guy at the capitol 
he runs a white power hate blog
against president sawyer 
  lovely 
  jesus  skip tyler 
king of the hackers 
worked for the nsa 
was fired for rewriting
nuclear launch coordinates   
   to target apple headquarters 
he was unhappy
with their music sharing polices 
walker s been after this guy forever 
and emil stenz  ex delta force 
highly decorated 
i m afraid we know this guy too 
  how 
  unfortunately  that s classified 
well  i hereby declassify it 
now  you wanna share it with the group 
stenz did off the books wetwork
for us in pakistan   
was part of a black bag
cia operation 
when the sawyer administration
came in  the new secretary of defence   
   shut down the operation
and disavowed its assets   
   including stenz 
his identity was compromised 
he wound up spending two years
in a taliban controlled prison 
  no wonder he s pissed at us 
  it s the threat matrix 
every day the secret service
does a rundown   
   of threats against the president 
every one of these guys was on it 
it s like walker used
it as a shopping list 
sir  delta force is 15 minutes out 
all right  general  i want them prepped
for an attack on the white house   
     as soon as i give the word 
  sir  please  please 
only the president can give that order 
the president is behind enemy lines
and compromised 
i m calling the cabinet together
to invoke the 25th 
gel  behind this  eli 
what if this were even a coup d état 
come on  that s just nonsense 
why isn t the military doing anything 
you gotta understand 
this is a very difficult situation   
   for the pentagon  there are hostages 
you can t bring the big guns out   
   because there s a class
of little schoolgirls still inside 
  martin 
  good morning  boys

did i spend 15 goddamn years
running this place or did you  
this guy is losing it 
what do we care if he gets the president 
we made a deal 
cale was right 
this is not about ransom 
walker has cancer 
his doctors gave him
less than three months 
he has a golf ball sized tumour
on his frontal lobe 
jesus christ 
i think he s on a suicide mission 
  you ready 
  yes 
  what do you think you re doing 
  if anybody can talk him down

you re doing this for kevin 
i swear to god

you make them pay
for what they did to our boy

the rest of her life in a federal prison 
you have 19 minutes

  general 
  your boss took the white house   
   and your man inside
got the president killed 
  carol  calm down

he built this because he didn t want
the press to see him in his swim trunks 
  any chance this leads out of here 
  no  listen  i gotta stop for a second 
what  you all right 
that s not good  is it 
  stenz worked for the cia  right 
  right 
if we can track the way
that walker contacted   
   these guys 
we can figure out how to stop them 
  how do you propose we do that 
  keep an eye on caulfield 
wait  what 
hi  i m carol 
i m not supposed to talk to you
right now 
run a database search
on the guys in that building 
cia  nsa  everything you ve got 
okay  listen  walker s not doing
this for the money  trust me 
  there is something else going on 
  i can t do that  ma am 
on the worst day that our country
has ever had   
   you could be the key
to figuring all of this out 
   could otherwise not accomplish that
is take back the white house 
i m gonna have to get that out 
when did you become a doctor
all of a sudden 
look  just talk to me  get my mind off it 
talk to me about your daughter 
emily 
she s completely in love with you 
  she even tried to get me to vote for you 
  you didn t vote for me 
your daughter s smart 
you should listen to her 
she was like 3 when i enlisted 
and to be honest with you   
   i was probably just running
from my marriage 
right after i deployed 
emily was watching tv   
   and there was coverage on
the troops in afghanistan 
she swears to me that she saw me 
after that point 
she became obsessed with politics 
and that s when she first saw you 
the man that was gonna
bring daddy home 
and when i finally did come home 
i realised that   
   i m not her hero anymore 
so i guess i just figured that i d try
to help protect the man that is 
well  if she saw you today  cale 
she d be proud of you 
you know how when they re young
and they come running up to you   
   and they hug you
and they re shouting  daddy    
   and all of a sudden  one day 
that just stops 
yeah 
i d give anything for that hug
just one more time

you don t know walker  john 
he was a dinosaur 
the man still used a pager 
oh  shit

i need to address the nation 
general  get on with the joint chiefs 
we need to move our troops into
the middle east to stabilise the region 
you wanna move troops in 
when they find out that we almost
launched a nuclear attack   
   there s gonna be chaos 
we have to contain it 
  can i ask you a question 
  of course  yeah 
when did you and walker
cook this whole thing up 
  excuse me 
  how d it go 
you gave walker the launch codes
and he made you president 
you can prove this 
well  walker had to get the launch codes
from somewhere   
   and you were the only person
with those codes 
and i found this pager
in walker s pocket 
i only know one other person
that uses one of these 
that doesn t prove anything 
two old guys use old technology 
so what 
why don t you call the return number
on that  carol 
would have been better
if the evidence had been destroyed   
   in the air strike that you ordered 
you re a goddamn traitor  sir 
you dim little shit 
i hired you out of pity
and this is how you repay me 
tomorrow  when people find out
that your precious president   
   helped a maniac
open the nuclear football

going to believe  you or me 
you  you would be a nobody
