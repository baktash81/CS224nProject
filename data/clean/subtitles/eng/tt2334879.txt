beats dupont circle sir
what time does my wife get in
eighteen fortyfive
wake me if civilisation ends
welcome home sir
thank you
hummingbird you are released
tell me we dont have the best job
in the world
i believe the numberone source
of violence in our world is poverty
now we were poor in my neighbourhood
sometimes we couldnt even eat
and my best friend ricky
he had it worse than us
one day things got
so desperate for ricky
he made a plan
to rob the corner store
and i told my mother about it
you know what she did
she had him over
cooked him a full meal
and told him that he could stay with us
as long as he wanted
and it was then that i realised
that if you feed a man
you take away his propensity
for violence
come on were gonna be late
hey hey hey
no no no thats no thats not
thats not
this is not happening right now
clyde weve had this conversation
my boss does not like squirrels
its a bird feeder
will you at least look at me
when im talking to you
look man i like squirrels personally
but youre getting me in trouble
do you see this
you know what this is
hey we gonna need backup
were working come on
we have any more robitussin
yes sir in the car
no ill get it its all right
quiet night
were under attack by squirrels
theyre organised
and they have the numbers
little stinkers trying to get
into the feeder
morning
hey roy
this isnt the most glamorous job
in the world
look i appreciate it very much
yeah well be there in 10 minutes
as leaders we have a choice
we can sit back
and let the same cycle of war
continue in the middle east
or we can do something about it
you know how much money
weve spent on the war since 2001
over a trillion dollars
could you imagine if you had
its gonna be a busy morning boys
education food health care
and infrastructure in the middle east
now weve begun historic talks
with the republic of irans
newly elected president alsharif
to build peace throughout his region
america cant do this alone
we need the full financial support
of all of our allies
but what we can do
is take the first step
therefore im announcing today
that all us troops will be removed
from the middle east
lets not repeat the same mistakes
that we made in the past
and lord knows
ive made some mistakes myself
instead i ask you
to stand with me today
sign this treaty lets end
this debilitating pattern of violence
and lets show the world that the pen
is truly mightier than the sword
thank you
president sawyer delivered what can
only be described as a historic speech
earlier today in geneva
here
lets go live
you changed your hair
last week
im gonna be late tonight
i love you very much
good morning sir
john what do you think
of the presidents proposal
i dont know its good
to have less enemies i guess
youre a military man
you dont think hes putting us at risk

if you feel that way
why didnt you run against him
no no no
thats one job i never wanted
i like my office
i like my constituents
i like being a thorn in the side
of the administration
but i think voters today
want somebody cool

the president has a call scheduled
with the speaker at 930

my father is a very special man
its nice to meet you
i paid her to say that
lets get started
okay
i dont know just
sorry i gotta ask
you didnt marry jim finnerty
from sigma chi did you
that guy was
an asshole yes he was
this is my colleague
special agent todd
standard secret service
protocol requires
a twoagent review for every interview
youre not to look at agent todd
im sorry i just looked at him
youre only to look at me
so we just okay
the subject is john cale
born 1980
grew up in the district of columbia
graduated hill high in 1999
looks like youve bounced
from job to job
mechanic limo driver construction
is my credit score in there
yes and you should be ashamed
of yourself
its a recession okay
married melanie schopp in 2002
and had a child six months later
filed for divorce in 2005
so you did three tours
in afghanistan
and you were wounded
in the kunar province
yes maam
you received a silver star
for pulling a corporal dawson
from a burning humvee
there was an ied attack
humvee flipped we were taking fire
so i grabbed him
why
i was a little concerned
that he was getting
a little too warm in there
its funny to me you still think glib
is the way to go here
corporal dawson is the nephew
of the speaker of the house
and when you were discharged
a year ago
he got you a job
with the capitol police
actually on his protection detail
if special agent todd
keeps making those sounds
im gonna start looking at him
will you give us a second please ryan
john why do you want to be
in the secret service
i cant think of a more important job
than protecting the president
okay this job requires
a university degree
you dropped out of gw
after our first semester there
you dont finish things
check the file carol
two years in college night school
a certificate of graduation
should be in there
great
yeah john you barely maintained
a c average
im sorry i didnt have
our little study sessions
like we used to back in the day
did i
evaluations from your senior officers
cale frequently does not complete
his field reports on time
nothing to do
with protecting someone
sergeant cale demonstrates
a lack of respect for authority
sergeant cale has raw potential
but seems determined not to realise it
you can keep reading that
that is not me anymore
im not the kid
you used to know in college
ive buttoned up every single thing
that i have to to qualify for this job
i have 10 times more experience
than any ivy league kid
its not just about experience i would
need to depend on you every day
what do you want me to do
ill start at the
ill start at the bottom
just give me a chance
im sorry
did you get the job
yeah i think i got a shot
really
you know how it is
they gotta go talk
amongst themselves and
these look these things
they can be really political

how old the white house is
yes
two hundred and twentytwo years old
thats very accurate
construction began in 1792
on what was then called
the presidents house
now article 1 section 8
of the us constitution set forth
that a district of no more than
10 miles square
should house the new seat
of government does anyone know why
so no one state could claim
the presidents house
right again
youre a real keener arent you
now the founders were crafty
hey so you can tell me the truth
do you get picked on a lot in school
no i dont
its a gift certificate for a massage
i could use one
martin its its been
i know for me too ted

carol you keep this up 20 years
from now youre gonna look like me

in southern pakistan
tough question
to be honest with you i dont know

touch of irony
the director
of homeland security himself

very brave young girl

the hostages include the nine girls
from watkins charter school

a very emotional roger skinner

i got the president a scrambled
satphone to call his family with
he keeps it in his bedside table
in the residence see if its still there
no no
vadim would you be kind enough
to confirm your last name for me please
lets go

up onscreen right now
in here
as we put these faces up onscreen
we are sure that we will
no doubt learn the names
of the men who are
holding the white house hostage
these men are clearly not al qaeda
we are positive
that the fbi will have
those images out
so again these are images
captured by a brave young girl
how many more ways can you guys
screw this thing up

talk to me about your daughter
emily
shes completely in love with you

you didnt vote for me
your daughters smart
you should listen to her
she was like 3 when i enlisted
and to be honest with you
i was probably just running
from my marriage
right after i deployed
emily was watching tv
and there was coverage on
the troops in afghanistan
she swears to me that she saw me
after that point
she became obsessed with politics
and thats when she first saw you
the man that was gonna
bring daddy home
and when i finally did come home
i realised that
im not her hero anymore
so i guess i just figured that id try
to help protect the man that is
well if she saw you today cale
shed be proud of you
you know how when theyre young
and they come running up to you
and they hug you
and theyre shouting daddy
and all of a sudden one day

when did you and walker
cook this whole thing up
excuse me
howd it go
you gave walker the launch codes

from somewhere

with those codes

in walkers pocket
i only know one other person
that uses one of these
that doesnt prove anything
two old guys use old technology
