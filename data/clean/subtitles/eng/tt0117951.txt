choose a family 
choose a fucking big television 
choose washing machines  cars 
compact disc players 
and electrical tin openers 
choose good health 
low cholesterol 
and dental insurance 
choose fixed interest
mortgage repayments 
choose a starter home 
choose your friends 
choose leisurewear
and matching luggage 
choose a three piece suite
on hire purchase
in a range of fucking fabrics 
choose d i y  and wondering who
you are on a sunday morning 
choose sitting 
watching mind numbing 
spirit crushing game shows 
stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth 
tommy  go 
choose rotting away at the end of it 
pissing your last in a miserable home 
an embarrassment to the selfish 
fucked up brats that you ve
spawned to replace yourself 
choose your future 
choose life 
  here comes johnny yen again  
  with the liquor and drugs  
but why would i want to do
a thing like that 
  he s gonna do another striptease  
i chose not to choose life 
i chose something else 
and the reasons 
there are no reasons 
who needs reasons
when you ve got heroin 
  yeah  something called love  
  well  that s like
hypnotizing chickens  
 goldfinger s  better than  dr  no  
both of them are a lot better
than  diamonds are forever  
a judgment reflected
in its relatively poor showing
at the box office 
in which field  of course 
 thunderball  was a notable success 
people think it s all
about misery and desperation
and death and all that shite 
which is not to be ignored 
fuck off 
doss cunt 
but what they forget
is the pleasure of it 
wild hands like me 
you prick 
otherwise we wouldn t do it 
  do you want me to do it 
  yeah 
beaut as the driven snow 
that shit  danny 
after all 
we re not fucking stupid 
well  at least  we re not
that fucking stupid 
take the best orgasm you ever had 
multiply it by 1 000 and
you re still nowhere near it 
that beats any meat injection 
that beats any fucking cock
in the world 
when you re on junk  you have
only one worry  scoring 
when you re off it  you worry
about all sorts of other shite 
got no money 
can t get drunk 
got money 
drinking too much 
can t get a girl 
no chance of a ride 
got a girl 
too much hassle 
you have to worry about bills 
about food 
about some football team
that never wins 
about human relationships
and all of the things that don t matter
when you ve got a sincere
and truthful junk habit 
i d say  in those days 
he was a muscular actor 
with all the presence of someone
like cooper or lancaster 
but combined with a sly wit   
   to make him a formidable
romantic lead 
closer in that respect to cary grant 
aah 
  hey  man 
where d ya get that lotion   
  your skin starts itching
once you buy the gimmick  
  about something called love  
  love  love  love  
  well  that s like
hypnotizing chickens  
the only drawback  or at least
the principal drawback 
is that you have to endure
cunts telling you   
 no way would i poison my body
with that shite  
all the fucking chemicals 
no fucking way 
it s a waste of your life  mark 
poisoning your body with that shite 
every chance you ve had  son 
you ve blown it 
stuffing your veins with that filth 
from time to time  even i
have uttered the magic words 
never again  swanney 
i m off the scag 
are you serious 
yeah  no more 
i m finished with that shite 
it s up to you 
i m going to get it sorted out 
get off it for good 
i sure have heard that one before 
the sick boy method 
well  it really worked for him  eh 
he s always been lacking
in moral fiber 
he knows a lot about sean connery 
that s hardly a substitute 
you need one more hit 
no  i don t think so 
for the long night that lies ahead 
we called him mother superior
on account of the length of his habit 
of course i d have another shot 
after all  i had work to do 
relinquishing junk  stage one 
preparation 
for this you will need one
room  which you will not leave 
soothing music 
tomato soup  10 tins of 
mushroom soup  8 tins of
for consumption cold 
ice cream  vanilla 
one large tub of 
magnesia  milk of  one bottle 
paracetamol  mouthwash  vitamins 
mineral water 
lucozade  pornography 
one mattress 
one bucket for urine  one
for feces  and one for vomitus 
one television 
one bottle of valium  which
i procured from my mother 
who is  in her own domestic
and socially acceptable way 
also a drug addict 
and now i m ready 
all i need is one final hit
to soothe the pain while
the valium takes effect 
mikey  hi 
yeah  it s mark renton 
look  could you help me out 
this was typical of mikey forrester 
what the fuck are these 
under the normal run of things
i would have had nothing to do
with the cunt 
but this was not
the normal run of things 
opium suppositories 
ideal for your purposes 
slow release 
bring you down gradually 
custom fucking designed
for your needs 
i want a fucking hit 
that s all i ve got  man 
take it or leave it 
are you feeling better now 
for all the good they ve done me 
i might as well have
stuck them up my arse 
heroin makes you constipated 
the heroin from my last hit
is fading away 
the suppositories have yet to melt 
ohh 
i m no longer constipated 
i fantasize about massive
pristine convenience 
brilliant gold taps 
virginal white marble 
a seat carved from ebony 
a cistern full of chanel no  5 
and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll 
but under the circumstances 
i ll settle for anywhere 
ohh 
fuck 
ohh  oh 
ahh 
yes  a fucking godsend 
and now 
now i m ready 
the downside of coming off junk
was i knew i would mix
with my friends
in a state of full consciousness 
it was awful 
they reminded me of myself 
i could hardly bear to look at them 
take sick boy  for instance 
he came off junk at the same time 
not because he wanted to 
just to annoy me 
just to show me
how easily he could do it 
thereby downgrading
my own struggle 
sneaky fucker  don t you think 
when i wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself 
he insisted on telling me once again
about his unifying theory of life 
it s certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life 
what do you mean 
well  at one point 
you ve got it 
then you lose it 
and it s gone forever 
all walks of life 
georgie best  for example 
had it  lost it 
or david bowie  or lou reed 
lou reed  some of his
solo stuff s not bad 
no  it s not bad  but it s not
great either  is it 
in your heart  you kind of know
that although it sounds all
right  it s actually just shite 
so who else 
charlie nicholas  david niven 
malcolm mclaren  elvis presley 
okay  okay  so what is the point
you re trying to make 
all i am trying to do  mark 
is to help you understand
that  the name of the rose 
is merely a blip
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory 
and what about  the untouchables  
i don t rate that at all 
despite the academy award 
that means fuck all 
it s a sympathy vote 
so we all get old  we can t hack
it anymore  and that s it 
yeah 
that s your theory 
yeah 
beautifully fucking illustrated 
give me the gun 
give me the gun 
do you see the beast 
have you got it in your sights 
clear enough  miss moneypenny 
this should present
no significant problems 
aah  no 
fuck  aah 
for a vegetarian  rents 
you re a fucking evil shot 
no  get off 
without heroin 
i attempted to lead a useful
and fulfilling life as a good citizen 
  good luck  spud 
  cheers  cowboy 
remember  if they think you re
not trying  you re in trouble 
first hint of that 
they ll be on to the dhss 
 this cunt is not trying  
and your giro is
fucking finished  right 
but then again  try too hard   
you might get the fucking job 
exactly 
nightmare 
it s a tightrope  spud 
it s a fucking tightrope 
see  i just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats 
i get all nervous 
i can t answer the questions 
i m a footballer  and i get
nerves on the big occasion  man 
try some of this  spud 
yeah  a little dab of speed
is just the ticket  man 
no  i went to craigy 
craig newton 
i just put down royal edinburgh
college to help get the job 
there s too much discrimination
in this town 
they re both schools 
we re all in this together 
i want to put across the general
idea rather than the details 
people get hung up on details 
which school did i go to 
how many grades did i get 
it could be six 
could be none 
it s not important 
what is important is that i am  yes 
mr  murphy  do you mean that you
lied on your application 
no 
yes  only to get my foot in the door 
showing initiative and that 
you were referred by
the department of employment 
there was no need for you to get
your  foot in the door  
as you put it 
cool  whatever you say  man 
sorry 
you re the man 
the dude in the chair 
i am merely here 
but obviously i m here 
mr  murphy 
what exactly attracts you
to the leisure industry 
in a word  pleasure 
like  my pleasure
in other people s leisure 
do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses 
oh  yes   cause i m a bit
of a perfectionist  actually 
yes  i am 
see  for me  it s got to be the
best  or it s nothing at all 
like  if things get a bit dodgy 
i cannot be bothered 
but i ve got good vibes about
this interview thing today 
seems to me like
it s going pretty well 
thank you  mr  murphy 
we ll let you know 
the pleasure was mine 
spud had done well 
i was proud of him 
he fucked up good and proper 
you had to hand it to spud 
picture the scene 
the other fucking week 
doing the fucking volley 
me and tommy playing pool 
i m playing like
paul fucking newman by the way 
giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime 
so it comes to the last shot 
the deciding ball
of the whole tournament 
i m on the black 
and he s in the corner 
looking all fucking biscuit arsed 
when this hard cunt comes in 
obviously fucking
fancied himself  like 
starts staring at me 
looking at me 
right fucking at me 
as if to say 
 come ahead  square  go  
you know me 
i m not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother 
at the end of the day 
i m the cunt with the pool cue 
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted 
so i squares up  casual like 
what does the hard cunt do 
or the so called hard cunt 
shites it 
puts down his drink  turns 
and gets the fuck out of there 
and after that 
well  the game was mine 
and that was it 
that was begbie s story 
at least that was begbie s
version of the story 
but a couple of days later
i got the truth from tommy 
you always got the truth from tommy 
it was one of his major weaknesses 
he never told lies 
he never took drugs 
and he never cheated on anyone 
it was wednesday morning 
we were in the volley playing pool 
that much is true 
but begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash 
he s got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue 
never mind pot a ball 
i m doing my best to lose 
you know 
trying to humor him  like 
but it s not doing any good 
every time i touch a ball 
i seem to pot something 
every time begbie goes near
the table  he fucks it up 
oh  fuck s sake 
so he s got the hump  right 
but finally i manage to set it
up so all he has to do
is to pot the black to win one game
to salvage a little bit of pride
and maybe not kick
my head in  right 
so he s on the black 
pressure shot 
and it all goes wrong  big time 
fuck 
aah 
he picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him 
can you believe it 
the cunt hasn t glanced
in our direction 
fuck off 
he was going to chib him 
i tell you 
then i thought he was going to do me 
the beggar s fucking psycho  man 
but he s a mate  you know 
so what can you do 
can i borrow this 
what indeed could one do 
just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved 
begbie didn t do drugs  either 
he just did people 
that s what he got off on 
his own sensory addiction 
nobody move 
that lassie got glassed 
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it 
who the fuck are you 
yes 
ohh 
oh  tom 
oh  my god 
oh  lizzy 
oh  lizzy 
oh  tom  come in me 
and as i sat watching
the intimate
and highly personal video 
stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends 
i realized that something important
was missing from my life 
  leave no track  
  don t look back  
  all i desire  
  temptation  
i read it in  cosmopolitan  
it s an interesting theory 
actually  it s a nightmare 
i ve been desperate for a shag 
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun 
you should try it with tommy 
what  and deny myself the only
pleasure i get from him 
did i tell you about my birthday 
what happened 
he forgot 
useless motherfucker 
what are you two talking about 
football 
what are you talking about 
shopping 
the situation was becoming serious 
young renton noticed the haste
with which the successful 
in the sexual sphere 
as in all others 
segregated themselves
from the failures 
  i can t break away  
  keep us from temptation  
  keep us from temptation  
heroin had robbed renton
of his sex drive 
but now it returned with a vengeance 
and as the impotence of
those days faded into memory 
grim desperation took a hold
in his sex crazed mind 
his post junk libido  fueled
by alcohol and amphetamine 
taunted him remorselessly with
his own unsatisfied desire 
dot  dot  dot 
  you think that you re right now  
  temptation  
  you re gonna face it tonight now  
  temptation  
  oh  give me a breakdown  
  temptation  
  because it s time for a shakedown  
  temptation  
  temptation  
  temptation  
and with that 
mark renton had fallen in love 
excuse me 
i don t mean to harass you 
but i was very impressed
with the capable manner
in which you dealt with that 
i was thinking to myself 
 this girl s special  
thanks 
  what s your name 
  diane 
  where are you going  diane 
  i m going home 
  where s that 
  it s where you live 
great 
what 
i ll come back with you 
but i m not promising anything 
do you find that this approach
usually works 
or  let me guess 
you ve never tried it before 
in fact  you don t normally
approach girls  am i right 
the truth is that you re
a quiet  sensitive type 
but if i m prepared to take a chance 
i might just get to know the inner you 
witty  adventurous  passionate 
loving  loyal 
taxi 
a little bit crazy 
a little bit bad 
but  hey  don t us girls
just love that 
well  what s wrong  boy 
cat got your tongue 
i left something 
are you getting in or not  pal 
do you understand 
i expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover 
generous but firm 
what 
failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations
will result in swift resumption
of a non sex situation 
right 
diane 
shh 
what 
shut up 
wake up  spud 
wake up 
sex 
casual sex 
tommy  let s put the tape on 
now 
i want to watch ourselves
while we re screwing 
so let s see what i m missing 
not much 
pushed forward again 
and there s the captain 
archie gemmill 
picking it up from the outside 
i think he wants to go himself 
he s gonna go 
he s going all the way 
and he scores 
oh  what a magnificent goal 
gemmill at his very best 
what a penetrating goal that was 
i haven t felt that good
since archie gemmill scored
against holland in 1978 
you can t sleep here 
  what 
  out 
come on 
no argument  you can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home 
it s up to you 
and don t make any noise 
jesus 
what do you mean   it s gone  
  where has it gone  tommy 
  it ll be here somewhere 
i might have returned it by mistake 
returned it 
where 
the video shop  tommy 
the fucking video shop 
so every punter in edinburgh
is jerking off to our video 
oh  god  tommy  i feel sick 
  oh  you ve got green eyes  
  oh  you ve got blue eyes  
  oh  you ve got gray eyes  
  and i ve never seen anyone  
hi 
hello

  quite like you before  
fuck 
eh

like some coffee 
aye 
you must be mark 
aye  that s me 
you re a friend of diane s 
more of a friend of a friend  no

flatmates 
i must remember that one 
morning 
good morning  spud 
gail 
mr  houston  mrs  houston 
good morning  spud  sit down
and have some breakfast 
i m sorry about last night 
by the way 
that s all right 
i slept fine on the sofa 
i had a bit much to drink 
i had a bit of an accident 
don t worry  son 
these things happen 
it does a man good to cut loose
once in a while 
this one could do with being
tied up once in a while 
i ll put the sheets in the machine 
no  no  no  i ll wash them 
  there s no need 
  it s no problem 
it s no problem for me 
i d rather take care of it myself 
honestly  it s no problem 
really  no 
spud  they re my sheets 
i don t see why not 
because it s illegal 
that s why not 
what  holding hands 
not holding hands 
in that case  you can do it 
you were quite happy to do
a lot more last night 
you were quite happy to do
a lot more last night 
yeah  and that s what s illegal 
do you know what they d do
to me inside 
they cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet 
calm down 
you re not going to jail 
well  that s very easy
for you to say  diane 
  can i see you again 
  certainly not 
if you don t see me again 
i ll tell the police 
i ll see you around then 
now what 
we re going for a walk 
what 
a walk 
where 
there 
are you serious 
well  what are you waiting for 
tommy 
this is not natural  man 
it s the great outdoors 
it s fresh air 
look  tommy  we know you re
getting a hard time off lizzy 
but there s really no need
to take it out on us 
doesn t it make you proud
to be scottish 
it s shite being scottish 
we re the lowest of the low 
the scum of the fucking earth 
the most wretched 
miserable  servile 
pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization 
some people hate the english 
i don t 
they re just wankers 
we  on the other hand 
are colonized by wankers 
we can t even find a decent
culture to be colonized by 
we re ruled by effete arseholes 
it s a shite state of affairs
to be in  tommy 
and all the fresh air in the world
won t make any fucking difference 
sorry  man 
i m sorry 
no  i appreciate it  tommy 
at or around this time 
spud  sick boy  and i made
a healthy  informed 
democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible 
it took about 12 hours 
it looks easy  this 
but it s not 
it looks like a doss 
like a soft option 
but living like this 
it s a full time business 
ursula andress 
the quintessential bond girl 
that s what everyone says 
the embodiment  right 
of his superiority to us 
beautiful  exotic 
highly sexual 
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him 
shite 
i mean  let s face it  mate 
she d shag one punter
from edinburgh 
she d shag
the whole fucking lot of us 
well done 
i knew he was gonna do that 
lizzy s gone  mark 
she s gone and fucking dumped me 
it was that videotape
and that iggy pop business
and other sorts of shit 
she told me where to go
and no fucking mistake 
i said to her 
 is there any chance
of getting back together  
but no way  no fucking way 
honor blackman  a k a 
pussy galore  right 
what a total fucking misnomer 
i mean  i wouldn t touch her
with yours 
i want to try it  mark 
you re always going on about how
it s the ultimate hit 
better than sex 
come on  man 
i m a fucking adult 
i can find out for myself 
i ve got the money 
personality  i mean 
that s what counts  right 
personality 
that s what keeps a relationship
going through the years 
like heroin 
i mean  heroin s got great
fucking personality 
  nightclubbing  
  we re nightclubbing  
  we re walking through town  
  nightclubbing  
swanney taught us
to respect
the national health service 
for it was the source
of much of our gear 
we stole drugs  we stole
prescriptions  or bought them 
sold them  swapped them 
forged them  photocopied them 
or traded drugs with
cancer victims  alcoholics 
old age pensioners 
aids patients  epileptics 
and bored housewives 
we took morphine  diamorphine 
cyclizine  codeine 
temazepam  nitrazepam 
phenobarbitone 
sodium amytal 
dextropropo xyphene  methadone 
nalbuphine  pethidine 
pentazocine  buprenorphine 
dextromoramide  chlormethiazole 
the streets are awash
with drugs you can have
for unhappiness and pain 
and we took them all 
fuck it  we would have injected
vitamin c
if only they d made it illegal 
pardon me 
may i use your bathroom 
thank you 
you re a psycho 
hey  rent boy  no fucking smack 
but the good times
couldn t last forever 
no  god  no 
oh  my god  no 
please  no 
i think allison
had been screaming all day 
but it hadn t really registered before 
she might have been screaming
for a week for all i knew 
it had been days
since i heard anyone speak 
though someone must have said
something in all that time 
surely to fuck 
someone must have 
  allison  allison 
  help me  please 
calm down 
everything s going to be just fine 
nothing could have been further
from the truth 
in point of fact  nothing was
going to be just fine 
on the contrary 
everything was going to be bad 
bad 
i mean everything was gonna be
even worse than it already was 
no 
fuck 
jesus christ 
no 
no 
it wasn t my baby 
she wasn t my baby 
baby dawn  she wasn t mine 
spud s  swanney s 
sick boy s 
i don t know 
maybe allison knew 
maybe not 
i wished i could think of
something to say 
something sympathetic 
something human 
say something  mark 
fucking say something 
i m cooking up 
cook us up a shot  rents 
i need a hit 
and so she did 
i could understand that 
to take the pain away 
so i cooked up 
and she got a hit 
but only after me 
that went without saying 
well  at least we knew
who the father was now 
it wasn t just the baby
that died that day 
something inside sick boy
was lost and never returned 
something inside sick boy
was lost and never returned 
it seemed he had no theory
with which to explain a moment
like this 
nor did i 
our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything 
pile misery upon misery 
heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile 
then squirt it into a stinking 
purulent vein 
and do it all over again 
keep on going  getting up 
going out  robbing 
stealing  fucking people over 
propelling ourselves with longing
towards the day
that it would all go wrong 
because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal 
you never have enough 
no matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over 
you always need to get up
and do it all over again 
sooner or later  this kind
of thing was bound to happen 
because shoplifting
is theft  which is a crime 
and despite what you may believe 
there is no such entity
as victimless crime 
heroin addiction
may explain your actions 
but it does not excuse them 
mr  murphy 
you are a habitual thief 
devoid of regret and remorse 
in sentencing you
to six months imprisonment 
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again 
mr  renton  i understand
that you have entered
into a program of rehabilitation
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin 
the suspension of your sentence
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program 
should you stand guilty
before me again 
i shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence 
thank you  your honor 
with god s help  i ll conquer
this terrible affliction 
what can you say 
well  begbie had a phrase for it 
it was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt 
well  i hope you learnt
your lesson  son 
oh  my son  i thought
i was gonna lose you there 
you re nothing but trouble
to me  but i still love you 
you better clean up your act 
cut that shite out forever 
you listen to francis 
he s talking sense 
fucking right i am 
see  inside  you wouldn t last
two fucking days 
there s better things
than the needle  rents 
choose life 
i remember
when you were a wee baby 
oh  mama s little baby loves 
  shortening  shortening  
  mama s little baby loves
shortening bread  
i m sorry  mrs  murphy 
that wasn t any fair 
spud going down and not me 
well  it s not our fault 
your boy went down
because he was a smack head 
and if that s not your fault 
then i don t know what is 
that was that fucking cunt 
i ll get the drinks 
aye 
i wished i d gone down
instead of spud 
here i was surrounded by my
family and my so called mates 
and i ve never felt so alone 
never in all my puff 
since i was on remand 
they ve had me on this program 
the state sponsored addiction 
three sickly sweet doses
of methadone a day
instead of smack 
but it s never enough 
and at the moment 
it s nowhere near enough 
i took all three this morning 
and now i ve got 18 hours

lifestyle leasing agency 
oh  yes  it s a beautifully
converted victorian townhouse 
ideally located in a quiet road 
near to the local shops and transport 
this one s two bedrooms
and a kitchen diner 
fully fitted in excellent
decorative order 
lots of storage space 
and all mod cons 
and it s going at  320 a week 
i settled in not too badly
and kept myself to myself 
sometimes  i thought about the guys 
but mainly i didn t miss them at all 
after all  this was boomtown 
where any fool could make cash
from chaos and plenty did 
i ve got a beautifully converted
victorian townhouse 
i quite enjoyed the sound of it all 
profit  loss  margins 
takeovers  lending  letting 
subletting  subdividing 
cheating  scamming 
fragmenting  breaking away 
who s got the keys
to telegraph road 
there was no such thing as
society  and even if there was 
i most certainly had nothing
to do with it 
for the first time in my adult
life  i was almost content

and somewhere to live 
school is fine at the moment 
i m not pregnant

  till someone said   i know
this place off burditt road   
  it was on the 15th floor  
  it had a board across the door  
  it took an hour to pry it off
and get inside  
  it smelt as if someone had died  
  the living room was full of flies  
  the kitchen sink was blocked  
it s me 
  the bathroom sink not there at all  
franks

diane was right 
the world is changing 
music is changing 
drugs are changing 
even men and women are changing 
1 000 years from now 
there ll be no guys
and no girls  just wankers 
sounds great to me 
it s just a pity no one told begbie 
fuck 
fuck 
you see  if you ask me 
we re heterosexual by default 
not by decision 
it s just a question of who you fancy 
it s all about aesthetics 
and it s fuck all to do with morality 
fuck 
but you try telling begbie that 
look  i m not a fucking bufty 
let s face it 
it could have been wonderful 
fucking listen to me 
you piece of junkie shit 
a joke s a fucking joke 
you mention that again 
and i ll cut you up 
you understand 
since i last saw him 
sick boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher
and was here  he said 
to mix business and pleasure 
setting up  contacts  
as he constantly informed me 
for the great scag deal that
was going to make him rich 
good chips 
i can t believe you did that 
i got a good price for it 
rents  i need the money 
it was my fucking telly 
well  if i d known you were
going to get so humpty 
i wouldn t have bothered 
fucking rented  anyway 
you going to eat that 
have you got a passport 
why 
i met this bloke 
runs a hotel  a brothel 
loads of contacts 
does a nice sideline
in punting british passports
to foreigners 
get you a good price 
and why would i want
to sell my passport 
it was just an idea 
i had to get rid of them 
sick boy didn t do his drug
deal  and he didn t get rich 
instead  he and begbie
hung around my bed sit
looking for things to steal 
i decided to put them in
the worst place in the world 
  sandman goes  two in tow  
  wet and dumb  
  coming down again  
they weren t paying any rent 
so when my boss
found two suckers who would 
sick boy and begbie were bound
to feel threatened 
yep  lots of storage 
all mod cons 
320 quid a week 
  aah 
  aah 
and that was that 
but by then we had another
reason to go back 
tommy 
tommy knew he d got the virus  like 
but he never knew
he d gone full blown 
what was it 
pneumonia or cancer 
no  toxoplasmosis 
sort of like a stroke 
how s that 
he wanted to see lizzy again 
she wouldn t let him near the house 
so he bought her a present 
brought her this kitten 
i bet lizzy told him where to stick it 
exactly   i m not wanting
that cat   she says 
get the fuck  right 
so there s tommy stuck
with this kitten 
you can imagine what happened 
to those of us gathered here today 
thomas mckenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives 
  what 
  thomas was a son 
the thing was neglected 
pissing and shitting all over the place 
tommy s lying about 
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers 
he never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit 
a loving man with a great lust for life 
neither did i 
what is it 
fucking horrible 
it s like an abscess in your brain 
fucking hell 
then what happened 
he starts getting these headaches 
so he just uses more smack 
you know  for the pain  like 
and then he has a stroke 
a fucking stroke 
just like that 
gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later 
he d been dead for ages
before the neighbors
complained about the smell
and got the police
to break down the door 
tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit 
he has gone from us 
but we have many things
to remember him by 
the kitten was fine 
would you all please rise now
for the committal 
  did you think
i would leave you crying  
  when there s room
on my horse for two   
  climb up here  tommy 
don t be dying  
  i can go just as fast with two  
  when we grow up 
we ll both be soldiers  
  and our horses will not be toys  
  and i wonder if we ll remember  
  when we were two little boys  
  tommy 
  tommy 
did you tell him yet 
on you go 
what 
there s this mate of swanney s 
you know the guy 
mikey forrester 
aye 
well  he s come into some gear 
a lot of gear 
how much gear 
about two kilos  so he tells me 
he got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week 
where he met two russian sailors 
they re fucking carrying
this stuff for sale 
there and then  like 
so he wakes up the next morning 
realizes what he s done 
gets very fucking nervous 
he wants rid of this  right 
so 
so he met me  and i offered
to take it off his hands
at a very reasonable price 
with the intention
of punting it on myself
to a guy i know in london 
ho ho ho ho 
we ve just come back
from tommy s funeral 
and you re talking about a scag deal 
aye 
what was your price 
  four grand 
  you haven t got four grand 
we re  2 000 short 
well  that s tough 
look  every cunt knows you ve
been saving up down in london 
i m sorry 
i do not have two grand 
aye  you fucking do 
i ve seen your bank statement 
for fuck s sake 
 2  133 
two kilos 
what is that  10 years 
mikey forrester 
russian sailors 
what the fuck are you boys on  eh 
spud  you ve already been to jail 
what s the deal  you like it
so much you want to go back 
i just want the money  mark 
if everybody keeps their mouth shut 
there ll be no cunt going to jail 
there were a lot
of possibilities running
through my mind about
what might happen in london 
things i didn t want to talk
to anyone about 
ideas best kept to myself 
no one told me
when we bought the scag 
some lucky punter
would have to try it out 
begbie didn t trust spud 
sick boy was too careful these days 
so i rolled up my sleeve 
i spiked my vein 
and i did what had to be done 
it s good 
oh  it s really fucking good 
mmm  ohh 
yeah  that hit was good 
i promised myself another one
before i got to london 
just the one like 
for old time s sake 
just to piss begbie off 
this was his nightmare 
the dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams
being perpetrated with three
of the most useless
and unreliable fuck ups in town 
i knew what was going on in his mind 
any trouble in london  and
he would dump us immediately 
one way or another 
he had to 
if he got caught with a bagful of scag 
on top of that armed robbery shit 
he was going down for 15 to 20 
begbie was hard 
but not so hard
that he didn t shite it
off 20 years in sultan 
this was to be my final hit 
but let s be clear about this 
there s final hits and final hits 
what kind was this to be 
did you bring the cards 
  what 
  the cards 
the last thing i told you
was to mind the cards 
well  i ve not brought them 
fucking boring after a while
without the cards 
i m sorry 
  bit fucking late 
  why didn t you bring them 
 cause i fucking told you
to bring them  you doss cunt 
christ 
these are your friends  right 
these are the guys i told you about 
  well  is he here 
  yeah  he s here 
you didn t get followed 
did you 
we didn t get followed 
okay 
all right 
aye 
straightaway he clocked us
for what we were 
small time wasters
with an accidental big deal 
excuse me  gentlemen 
so how much would you like for this 
 20 000 
well  i don t think it s worth
much more than   15 000 
this was a real drag to him 
he didn t need to negotiate 
what the fuck were we going
to do if he didn t buy it 
sell it on the streets 
fuck that 
well    19 000 
i m terribly sorry 
i can t go to   19 000 
well  fucking   16 000  then 
okay 
well  fucking   16 000 it is  then 
these  gentlemen 
are  2 000 bundles 
here s two 
that s four 
we settled on  16 000 
he had more in the suitcase 
but it was better than nothing 
thank you very much  gentlemen 
i d like to say it s been
a pleasure haggling with you 
fucking brand new 
by the way 
okay 
  yes 
  yes 
fucking   
and just for a moment 
it felt really great 
like we were in it together 
like friends 
like it meant something 
a moment like that
can touch you deep inside 
but it doesn t last long 
not like  16 000 
but it doesn t last long 
not like  16 000 
so what about you  spud  any
investments on the horizon
