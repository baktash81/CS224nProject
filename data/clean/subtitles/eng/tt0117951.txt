choose a family
choose a fucking big television
choose washing machines cars
compactdisc players
and electrical tin openers
choose good health
low cholesterol
and dental insurance
choose fixedinterest
mortgage repayments
choose a starter home
choose your friends
choose leisurewear
and matching luggage
choose a threepiece suite
on hire purchase
in a range of fucking fabrics
choose diy and wondering who
you are on a sunday morning
choose sitting
watching mindnumbing
spiritcrushing game shows
stuffing fucking junk food
into your mouth
tommy go
choose rotting away at the end of it
pissing your last in a miserable home
an embarrassment to the selfish
fuckedup brats that youve
spawned to replace yourself
choose your future
choose life
here comes johnny yen again
with the liquor and drugs
but why would i want to do
a thing like that
hes gonna do another striptease
i chose not to choose life
i chose something else
and the reasons
there are no reasons
who needs reasons
when youve got heroin
yeah something called love
well thats like
hypnotizing chickens
goldfingers better than dr no
both of them are a lot better
than diamonds are forever
a judgment reflected
in its relatively poor showing
at the box office
in which field of course
thunderball was a notable success
people think its all
about misery and desperation
and death and all that shite
which is not to be ignored
fuck off
doss cunt
but what they forget
is the pleasure of it
wild hands like me
you prick
otherwise we wouldnt do it
do you want me to do it
yeah
beaut as the driven snow
that shit danny
after all
were not fucking stupid
well at least were not
that fucking stupid
take the best orgasm you ever had
multiply it by 1000 and
youre still nowhere near it
that beats any meat injection
that beats any fucking cock
in the world
when youre on junk you have
only one worry scoring
when youre off it you worry
about all sorts of other shite
got no money
cant get drunk
got money
drinking too much
cant get a girl
no chance of a ride
got a girl
too much hassle
you have to worry about bills
about food
about some football team
that never wins
about human relationships
and all of the things that dont matter
when youve got a sincere
and truthful junk habit
id say in those days
he was a muscular actor
with all the presence of someone
like cooper or lancaster
but combined with a sly wit
to make him a formidable
romantic lead
closer in that respect to cary grant
aah
hey man
whered ya get that lotion
your skin starts itching
once you buy the gimmick
about something called love
love love love
well thats like
hypnotizing chickens
the only drawback or at least
the principal drawback
is that you have to endure
cunts telling you
no way would i poison my body
with that shite
all the fucking chemicals
no fucking way
its a waste of your life mark
poisoning your body with that shite
every chance youve had son
youve blown it
stuffing your veins with that filth
from time to time even i
have uttered the magic words
never again swanney
im off the scag
are you serious
yeah no more
im finished with that shite
its up to you
im going to get it sorted out
get off it for good
i sure have heard that one before
the sick boy method
well it really worked for him eh
hes always been lacking
in moral fiber
he knows a lot about sean connery
thats hardly a substitute
you need one more hit
no i dont think so
for the long night that lies ahead
we called him mother superior
on account of the length of his habit
of course id have another shot
after all i had work to do
relinquishing junk stage one
preparation
for this you will need one
room which you will not leave
soothing music
tomato soup 10 tins of
mushroom soup 8 tins of
for consumption cold
ice cream vanilla
one large tub of
magnesia milk of one bottle
paracetamol mouthwash vitamins
mineral water
lucozade pornography
one mattress
one bucket for urine one
for feces and one for vomitus
one television
one bottle of valium which
i procured from my mother
who is in her own domestic
and socially acceptable way
also a drug addict
and now im ready
all i need is one final hit
to soothe the pain while
the valium takes effect
mikey hi
yeah its mark renton
look could you help me out
this was typical of mikey forrester
what the fuck are these
under the normal run of things
i would have had nothing to do
with the cunt
but this was not
the normal run of things
opium suppositories
ideal for your purposes
slow release
bring you down gradually
customfuckingdesigned
for your needs
i want a fucking hit
thats all ive got man
take it or leave it
are you feeling better now
for all the good theyve done me
i might as well have
stuck them up my arse
heroin makes you constipated
the heroin from my last hit
is fading away
the suppositories have yet to melt
ohh
im no longer constipated
i fantasize about massive
pristine convenience
brilliant gold taps
virginalwhite marble
a seat carved from ebony
a cistern full of chanel no 5
and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll
but under the circumstances
ill settle for anywhere
ohh
fuck
ohh oh
ahh
yes a fucking godsend
and now
now im ready
the downside of coming off junk
was i knew i would mix
with my friends
in a state of full consciousness
it was awful
they reminded me of myself
i could hardly bear to look at them
take sick boy for instance
he came off junk at the same time
not because he wanted to
just to annoy me
just to show me
how easily he could do it
thereby downgrading
my own struggle
sneaky fucker dont you think
when i wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself
he insisted on telling me once again
about his unifying theory of life
its certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life
what do you mean
well at one point
youve got it
then you lose it
and its gone forever
all walks of life
georgie best for example
had it lost it
or david bowie or lou reed
lou reed some of his
solo stuffs not bad
no its not bad but its not
great either is it
in your heart you kind of know
that although it sounds all
right its actually just shite
so who else
charlie nicholas david niven
malcolm mclaren elvis presley
okay okay so what is the point
youre trying to make
all i am trying to do mark
is to help you understand
that the name of the rose
is merely a blip
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory
and what about the untouchables
i dont rate that at all
despite the academy award
that means fuck all
its a sympathy vote
so we all get old we cant hack
it anymore and thats it
yeah
thats your theory
yeah
beautifully fucking illustrated
give me the gun
give me the gun
do you see the beast
have you got it in your sights
clear enough miss moneypenny
this should present
no significant problems
aah no
fuck aah
for a vegetarian rents
youre a fucking evil shot
no get off
without heroin
i attempted to lead a useful
and fulfilling life as a good citizen
good luck spud
cheers cowboy
remember if they think youre
not trying youre in trouble
first hint of that
theyll be on to the dhss
this cunt is not trying
and your giro is
fucking finished right
but then again try too hard
you might get the fucking job
exactly
nightmare
its a tightrope spud
its a fucking tightrope
see i just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats
i get all nervous
i cant answer the questions
im a footballer and i get
nerves on the big occasion man
try some of this spud
yeah a little dab of speed
is just the ticket man
no i went to craigy
craig newton
i just put down royal edinburgh
college to help get the job
theres too much discrimination
in this town
theyre both schools
were all in this together
i want to put across the general
idea rather than the details
people get hung up on details
which school did i go to
how many grades did i get
it could be six
could be none
its not important
what is important is that i am yes
mr murphy do you mean that you
lied on your application
no
yes only to get my foot in the door
showing initiative and that
you were referred by
the department of employment
there was no need for you to get
your foot in the door
as you put it
cool whatever you say man
sorry
youre the man
the dude in the chair
i am merely here
but obviously im here
mr murphy
what exactly attracts you
to the leisure industry
in a word pleasure
like my pleasure
in other peoples leisure
do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses
oh yes cause im a bit
of a perfectionist actually
yes i am
see for me its got to be the
best or its nothing at all
like if things get a bit dodgy
i cannot be bothered
but ive got good vibes about
this interview thing today
seems to me like
its going pretty well
thank you mr murphy
well let you know
the pleasure was mine
spud had done well
i was proud of him
he fucked up good and proper
you had to hand it to spud
picture the scene
the other fucking week
doing the fucking volley
me and tommy playing pool
im playing like
paul fucking newman by the way
giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime
so it comes to the last shot
the deciding ball
of the whole tournament
im on the black
and hes in the corner
looking all fucking biscuitarsed
when this hard cunt comes in
obviously fucking
fancied himself like
starts staring at me
looking at me
right fucking at me
as if to say
come ahead square go
you know me
im not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother
at the end of the day
im the cunt with the pool cue
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted
so i squares up casual like
what does the hard cunt do
or the socalled hard cunt
shites it
puts down his drink turns
and gets the fuck out of there
and after that
well the game was mine
and that was it
that was begbies story
at least that was begbies
version of the story
but a couple of days later
i got the truth from tommy
you always got the truth from tommy
it was one of his major weaknesses
he never told lies
he never took drugs
and he never cheated on anyone
it was wednesday morning
we were in the volley playing pool
that much is true
but begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash
hes got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue
never mind pot a ball
im doing my best to lose
you know
trying to humor him like
but its not doing any good
every time i touch a ball
i seem to pot something
every time begbie goes near
the table he fucks it up
oh fucks sake
so hes got the hump right
but finally i manage to set it
up so all he has to do
is to pot the black to win one game
to salvage a little bit of pride
and maybe not kick
my head in right
so hes on the black
pressure shot
and it all goes wrong bigtime
fuck
aah
he picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him
can you believe it
the cunt hasnt glanced
in our direction
fuck off
he was going to chib him
i tell you
then i thought he was going to do me
the beggars fucking psycho man
but hes a mate you know
so what can you do
can i borrow this
what indeed could one do
just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved
begbie didnt do drugs either
he just did people
thats what he got off on
his own sensory addiction
nobody move
that lassie got glassed
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it
who the fuck are you
yes
ohh
oh tom
oh my god
oh lizzy
oh lizzy
oh tom come in me
and as i sat watching
the intimate
and highly personal video
stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends
i realized that something important
was missing from my life
leave no track
dont look back
all i desire
temptation
i read it in cosmopolitan
its an interesting theory
actually its a nightmare
ive been desperate for a shag
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun
you should try it with tommy
what and deny myself the only
pleasure i get from him
did i tell you about my birthday
what happened
he forgot
useless motherfucker
what are you two talking about
football
what are you talking about
shopping
the situation was becoming serious
young renton noticed the haste
with which the successful
in the sexual sphere
as in all others
segregated themselves
from the failures
i cant break away
keep us from temptation
keep us from temptation
heroin had robbed renton
of his sex drive
but now it returned with a vengeance
and as the impotence of
those days faded into memory
grim desperation took a hold
in his sexcrazed mind
his postjunk libido fueled
by alcohol and amphetamine
taunted him remorselessly with
his own unsatisfied desire
dot dot dot
you think that youre right now
temptation
youre gonna face it tonight now
temptation
oh give me a breakdown
temptation
because its time for a shakedown
temptation
temptation
temptation
and with that
mark renton had fallen in love
excuse me
i dont mean to harass you
but i was very impressed
with the capable manner
in which you dealt with that
i was thinking to myself
this girls special
thanks
whats your name
diane
where are you going diane
im going home
wheres that
its where you live
great
what
ill come back with you
but im not promising anything
do you find that this approach
usually works
or let me guess
youve never tried it before
in fact you dont normally
approach girls am i right
the truth is that youre
a quiet sensitive type
but if im prepared to take a chance
i might just get to know the inner you
witty adventurous passionate
loving loyal
taxi
a little bit crazy
a little bit bad
but hey dont us girls
just love that
well whats wrong boy
cat got your tongue
i left something
are you getting in or not pal
do you understand
i expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover
generous but firm
what
failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations
will result in swift resumption
of a nonsex situation
right
diane
shh
what
shut up
wake up spud
wake up
sex
casual sex
tommy lets put the tape on
now
i want to watch ourselves
while were screwing
so lets see what im missing
not much
pushed forward again
and theres the captain
archie gemmill
picking it up from the outside
i think he wants to go himself
hes gonna go
hes going all the way
and he scores
oh what a magnificent goal
gemmill at his very best
what a penetrating goal that was
i havent felt that good
since archie gemmill scored
against holland in 1978
you cant sleep here
what
out
come on
no argument you can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home
its up to you
and dont make any noise
jesus
what do you mean its gone
where has it gone tommy
itll be here somewhere
i might have returned it by mistake
returned it
where
the video shop tommy
the fucking video shop
so every punter in edinburgh
is jerking off to our video
oh god tommy i feel sick
oh youve got green eyes
oh youve got blue eyes
oh youve got gray eyes
and ive never seen anyone

thats all right
i slept fine on the sofa
i had a bit much to drink

once in a while
this one could do with being
tied up once in a while
ill put the sheets in the machine
no no no ill wash them
theres no need
its no problem
its no problem for me
id rather take care of it myself
honestly its no problem
really no
spud theyre my sheets
i dont see why not
because its illegal
thats why not
what holding hands
not holding hands
in that case you can do it
you were quite happy to do

a walk
where
there
are you serious
well what are you waiting for
tommy
this is not natural man
its the great outdoors
its fresh air
look tommy we know youre
getting a hard time off lizzy
but theres really no need
to take it out on us
doesnt it make you proud
to be scottish
its shite being scottish
were the lowest of the low
the scum of the fucking earth
the most wretched
miserable servile
pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization
some people hate the english
i dont
theyre just wankers
we on the other hand
are colonized by wankers
we cant even find a decent
culture to be colonized by
were ruled by effete arseholes
its a shite state of affairs
to be in tommy
and all the fresh air in the world
wont make any fucking difference
sorry man
im sorry
no i appreciate it tommy
at or around this time
spud sick boy and i made
a healthy informed
democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible
it took about 12 hours
it looks easy this
but its not
it looks like a doss
like a soft option
but living like this
its a fulltime business
ursula andress
the quintessential bond girl
thats what everyone says
the embodiment right
of his superiority to us
beautiful exotic
highly sexual
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him
shite
i mean lets face it mate
shed shag one punter
from edinburgh
shed shag
the whole fucking lot of us
well done
i knew he was gonna do that
lizzys gone mark
shes gone and fucking dumped me
it was that videotape
and that iggy pop business
and other sorts of shit
she told me where to go
and no fucking mistake
i said to her
is there any chance
of getting back together
but no way no fucking way
honor blackman aka
pussy galore right
what a total fucking misnomer
i mean i wouldnt touch her
with yours
i want to try it mark
youre always going on about how
its the ultimate hit
better than sex
come on man
im a fucking adult
i can find out for myself
ive got the money
personality i mean
thats what counts right
personality
thats what keeps a relationship
going through the years
like heroin
i mean heroins got great
fucking personality
nightclubbing
were nightclubbing
were walking through town
nightclubbing
swanney taught us
to respect
the national health service
for it was the source
of much of our gear
we stole drugs we stole
prescriptions or bought them
sold them swapped them
forged them photocopied them
or traded drugs with
cancer victims alcoholics
oldage pensioners
aids patients epileptics
and bored housewives
we took morphine diamorphine
cyclizine codeine
temazepam nitrazepam
phenobarbitone
sodium amytal
dextropropo xyphene methadone
nalbuphine pethidine
pentazocine buprenorphine
dextromoramide chlormethiazole
the streets are awash
with drugs you can have
for unhappiness and pain
and we took them all
fuck it we would have injected
vitamin c
if only theyd made it illegal
pardon me
may i use your bathroom
thank you
youre a psycho
hey rent boy no fucking smack
but the good times
couldnt last forever
no god no
oh my god no
please no
i think allison
had been screaming all day
but it hadnt really registered before
she might have been screaming
for a week for all i knew
it had been days
since i heard anyone speak
though someone must have said
something in all that time
surely to fuck
someone must have
allison allison
help me please
calm down
everythings going to be just fine
nothing could have been further
from the truth
in point of fact nothing was
going to be just fine
on the contrary
everything was going to be bad
bad
i mean everything was gonna be
even worse than it already was
no
fuck
jesus christ
no
no
it wasnt my baby
she wasnt my baby
baby dawn she wasnt mine
spuds swanneys
sick boys
i dont know
maybe allison knew
maybe not
i wished i could think of
something to say
something sympathetic
something human
say something mark
fucking say something
im cooking up
cook us up a shot rents
i need a hit
and so she did
i could understand that
to take the pain away
so i cooked up
and she got a hit
but only after me
that went without saying
well at least we knew
who the father was now
it wasnt just the baby
that died that day
something inside sick boy
was lost and never returned
something inside sick boy
was lost and never returned
it seemed he had no theory
with which to explain a moment
like this
nor did i
our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything
pile misery upon misery
heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile
then squirt it into a stinking
purulent vein
and do it all over again
keep on going getting up
going out robbing
stealing fucking people over
propelling ourselves with longing
towards the day
that it would all go wrong
because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal
you never have enough
no matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over
you always need to get up
and do it all over again
sooner or later this kind
of thing was bound to happen
because shoplifting
is theft which is a crime
and despite what you may believe
there is no such entity
as victimless crime
heroin addiction
may explain your actions
but it does not excuse them
mr murphy
you are a habitual thief
devoid of regret and remorse
in sentencing you
to six months imprisonment
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again
mr renton i understand
that you have entered
into a program of rehabilitation
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin
the suspension of your sentence
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program
should you stand guilty
before me again
i shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence
thank you your honor
with gods help ill conquer
this terrible affliction
what can you say
well begbie had a phrase for it
it was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt
well i hope you learnt
your lesson son
oh my son i thought
i was gonna lose you there
youre nothing but trouble
to me but i still love you
you better clean up your act
cut that shite out forever
you listen to francis
hes talking sense
fucking right i am
see inside you wouldnt last
two fucking days
theres better things
than the needle rents
choose life
i remember
when you were a wee baby
oh mamas little baby loves
shortening shortening
mamas little baby loves
shortening bread
im sorry mrs murphy
that wasnt any fair
spud going down and not me
well its not our fault
your boy went down
because he was a smackhead
and if thats not your fault
then i dont know what is
that was that fucking cunt
ill get the drinks
aye
i wished id gone down
instead of spud
here i was surrounded by my
family and my socalled mates
and ive never felt so alone
never in all my puff
since i was on remand
theyve had me on this program
the statesponsored addiction
three sickly sweet doses
of methadone a day
instead of smack
but its never enough
and at the moment
its nowhere near enough
i took all three this morning
and now ive got 18 hours
to go till my next shot
and a sweat on my back
like a layer of frost
i need to visit the mother
superior for one hit
one fucking hit to get us

decorative order

but mainly i didnt miss them at all
after all this was boomtown
where any fool could make cash
from chaos and plenty did

victorian townhouse
i quite enjoyed the sound of it all
profit loss margins
takeovers lending letting
subletting subdividing
cheating scamming
fragmenting breaking away

society and even if there was
i most certainly had nothing
to do with it
for the first time in my adult
life i was almost content

1000 years from now
therell be no guys
and no girls just wankers
sounds great to me
its just a pity no one told begbie
fuck
fuck
you see if you ask me
were heterosexual by default
not by decision
its just a question of who you fancy
its all about aesthetics
and its fuckall to do with morality
fuck
but you try telling begbie that
look im not a fucking bufty
lets face it
it could have been wonderful
fucking listen to me
you piece of junkie shit
a jokes a fucking joke
you mention that again
and ill cut you up
you understand
since i last saw him
sick boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher
and was here he said
to mix business and pleasure
setting up contacts
as he constantly informed me
for the great scag deal that
was going to make him rich
good chips
i cant believe you did that
i got a good price for it
rents i need the money
it was my fucking telly
well if id known you were
going to get so humpty
i wouldnt have bothered
fucking rented anyway
you going to eat that
have you got a passport
why
i met this bloke
runs a hotel a brothel
loads of contacts
does a nice sideline
in punting british passports
to foreigners
get you a good price
and why would i want
to sell my passport
it was just an idea
i had to get rid of them
sick boy didnt do his drug
deal and he didnt get rich
instead he and begbie
hung around my bedsit
looking for things to steal
i decided to put them in
the worst place in the world
sandman goes two in tow
wet and dumb
coming down again
they werent paying any rent
so when my boss
found two suckers who would
sick boy and begbie were bound
to feel threatened
yep lots of storage
all mod cons
320 quid a week
aah
aah
and that was that
but by then we had another
reason to go back
tommy
tommy knew hed got the virus like
but he never knew
hed gone fullblown
what was it
pneumonia or cancer
no toxoplasmosis
sort of like a stroke
hows that
he wanted to see lizzy again
she wouldnt let him near the house
so he bought her a present
brought her this kitten
i bet lizzy told him where to stick it
exactly im not wanting
that cat she says
get the fuck right
so theres tommy stuck
with this kitten
you can imagine what happened
to those of us gathered here today
thomas mckenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives
what
thomas was a son
the thing was neglected
pissing and shitting all over the place
tommys lying about
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers
he never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit
a loving man with a great lust for life
neither did i
what is it
fucking horrible
its like an abscess in your brain
fucking hell
then what happened
he starts getting these headaches
so he just uses more smack
you know for the pain like
and then he has a stroke
a fucking stroke
just like that
gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later
hed been dead for ages
before the neighbors
complained about the smell
and got the police
to break down the door
tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit
he has gone from us
but we have many things
to remember him by
the kitten was fine
would you all please rise now
for the committal
did you think
i would leave you crying
when theres room
on my horse for two
climb up here tommy
dont be dying
i can go just as fast with two
when we grow up
well both be soldiers
and our horses will not be toys
and i wonder if well remember
when we were two little boys
tommy
tommy
did you tell him yet
on you go
what
theres this mate of swanneys
you know the guy
mikey forrester
aye
well hes come into some gear
a lot of gear
how much gear
about two kilos so he tells me
he got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week
where he met two russian sailors
theyre fucking carrying
this stuff for sale
there and then like
so he wakes up the next morning
realizes what hes done
gets very fucking nervous
he wants rid of this right
so
so he met me and i offered
to take it off his hands
at a very reasonable price
with the intention
of punting it on myself
to a guy i know in london
ho hohoho
weve just come back
from tommys funeral
and youre talking about a scag deal
aye
what was your price
four grand
you havent got four grand
were 2000 short
well thats tough
look every cunt knows youve
been saving up down in london
im sorry
i do not have two grand
aye you fucking do
ive seen your bank statement
for fucks sake
2 133
two kilos
what is that 10 years
mikey forrester
russian sailors
what the fuck are you boys on eh
spud youve already been to jail
whats the deal you like it
so much you want to go back
i just want the money mark
if everybody keeps their mouth shut
therell be no cunt going to jail
there were a lot
of possibilities running
through my mind about
what might happen in london
things i didnt want to talk
to anyone about
ideas best kept to myself
no one told me
when we bought the scag
some lucky punter
would have to try it out
begbie didnt trust spud
sick boy was too careful these days
so i rolled up my sleeve
i spiked my vein
and i did what had to be done
its good
oh its really fucking good
mmm ohh
yeah that hit was good
i promised myself another one
before i got to london
just the one like
for old times sake
just to piss begbie off
this was his nightmare
the dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams
being perpetrated with three
of the most useless
and unreliable fuckups in town
i knew what was going on in his mind
any trouble in london and
he would dump us immediately
one way or another
he had to
if he got caught with a bagful of scag
on top of that armedrobbery shit
he was going down for 15 to 20
begbie was hard
but not so hard
that he didnt shite it
off 20 years in sultan
this was to be my final hit
but lets be clear about this
theres final hits and final hits
what kind was this to be
did you bring the cards
what
the cards
the last thing i told you
was to mind the cards
well ive not brought them
fucking boring after a while
without the cards
im sorry
bit fucking late
why didnt you bring them
cause i fucking told you
to bring them you doss cunt
christ
these are your friends right
these are the guys i told you about
well is he here
yeah hes here
you didnt get followed
did you
we didnt get followed
okay
all right
aye
straightaway he clocked us
for what we were
smalltime wasters
with an accidental big deal
excuse me gentlemen
so how much would you like for this
well i dont think its worth
much more than  15000
this was a real drag to him
he didnt need to negotiate
what the fuck were we going
to do if he didnt buy it
sell it on the streets
fuck that
well  19000
im terribly sorry
i cant go to  19000
well fucking  16000 then
okay
well fucking  16000 it is then
these gentlemen
are 2000 bundles
heres two
thats four
we settled on 16000
he had more in the suitcase
but it was better than nothing
thank you very much gentlemen
id like to say its been
a pleasure haggling with you
fucking brandnew
by the way
okay
yes
yes
fucking
and just for a moment
it felt really great
like we were in it together
like friends
like it meant something
a moment like that
can touch you deep inside
but it doesnt last long
not like 16000
but it doesnt last long
not like 16000
