make sense of things too great   
   or too terrifying to believe 
this is the legend of the ghost rider 
story goes that
every generation has one 
some damned soul 
cursed to ride the earth   
   collecting on the devil s deals 
many years ago  a ghost rider was
sent to the village of san venganza   
   to fetch a contract
worth 1000 evil souls 
but that contract was so powerful   
   he knew he could never let
the devil get his hands on it 
so he did what no rider
has ever done before 
he outran the devil himself

   sometimes they re true

  greatest stunt rider of all time   
   but what we don t know is how
much longer can blaze cheat death 
  critics call it pay per view suicide

mack  the monkey show 
  with no regard for his own life 
they call him mr  invincible 
and he ll have to be at his next jump

the world s greatest stuntman

but i m good  thanks for the water

did i say something funny 
ironic 
we re big on irony around here 
  it s out by the shed 
  thanks 
it does 
what 
you re wondering if your bike
looks normal  it does 
and to answer your other questions 
last night did happen   
   it wasn t a dream   
   and it will happen again 
who are you 
question is  who are you 
you are the rider 
the ghost rider 
get used to it  kid 
it ll be a lot easier 
if you don t  i got a nice cozy spot
picked out for you 
they ve seen you now 
they ll be waiting for you 
you ll need my help 
you expect to last the night 
last time i let a stranger help me
it didn t pan out so good 
this ain t something
you can run from  kid 
this day has been coming
since you made that deal 
congratulations 
your chances
just went from none to slim 
sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link   
   between what happened
here in downtown   
   and the broken spoke massacre
in the desert 
i m roxanne simpson on scene 
and we re out 
  captain dolan 
  no comment 
is it true they found a connection
between the massacre   
   and last night s victim
here at the city train yards 
no comment 
off the record  captain 
off the record 
piss off 
the rider is the devil s bounty hunter 
sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell 
sterilize that for me 
sterilize 
in the boiling water 
right  okay 
a little confused 
during the day you ll be normal 
but at night   
   in the presence of evil   
   the rider takes over 
i remember now 
last night 
there was some punk   
   and i could see all the wrong
he d ever done   
   and i turned it all against him 
the penance stare 
it sears the souls of the wicked 
it s the ghost rider s greatest weapon 
all the riders have it 
have there been others
with my  ghost rider  problem 
been a few 
last one was 150 years ago   
   in a little town
called san venganza 
nice town 
nice people 
till a stranger came along
making promises   
   one deal at a time 
consumed by greed 
they turned on one another   
   until the village of san venganza
drowned in its own blood   
   their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place 
what s this have to do
with blackheart 
blackheart 
he sent you after blackheart 
and others 
the hidden 
fallen angels cast out of heaven
by saint michael himself 
they hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days 
you better hang around here  kid 
they can t come
onto hallowed ground 
thanks 
and thanks for the info 
i feel much better now that i know
i m the devil s bounty hunter 
  where you going 
  somebody i gotta see 
that s a bad idea 
it wouldn t be my first 
why d you do it 
why d you make the deal 
i was a kid 
what d you get in return 
heartache 
oh  my god 
it s hard to describe the destruction
here this morning 
can i get you people
to stand back  please 
i don t know  it seems like
something supernatural 
could you tell us about
the good samaritan 
well  i ll never forget him 
that s for sure 
he was tall  broad shoulders 
and thin  really thin  like bony 
and he had this rad chopper 
it was all flames and stuff 
oh  and his face was a skull
and it was on fire 
 on fire  
yeah  like 
like that much fire 
and i know it sounds weird 
but it looked okay on him 
i mean  it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off 
not sure what to add to that 
i m roxanne simpson on scene 
thanks 
  roxie   
  don t 
now  hold on a second 
let me apologize 
  last night was inexcusable 
  no apologies 
see  you did me a favor last night   
   because you made me think
of then and now 
and when you left 
yeah  it hurt like hell 
but you know what  i got over it   
   and i went to college 
i got a great job 
but you  johnny   
   you re just the same 
oh  better paid  more fans   
   but you re still just a carny 
yeah 
oh  man 
my dad was right 
you were just a phase 
that went well 
hey  captain  i got something 
 end of days 
the host can gain control
of the possessing spirit   
   through concentration on
and manipulation of   
   the fire element
that exists within man  
i am speaking to the fire element
within me 
give me control
over the possessing spirit 
  hi 
  hi 
hey  i hope you don t mind 
your lift was open 
i came to apologize 
i m leaving town tonight   
   and i didn t want what i said today
to be the last words between us 
  that s okay 
  no  it s not 
it was cruel and totally untrue 
and i feel really terrible about it 
please  don t  it s okay 
is something burning 
oh  that must be coming from outside 
neighbor s hibachi 
bill  he just got it 
i still have that one 
you what 
i have that one too 
i remember that day 
there were a dozen people
waiting in line   
   and you went through
a whole roll of quarters 
look at my face 
you can tell i was just terrified   
   that my dad was gonna
come in any second 
okay  i just   
it s just    i think i should
walk you to your car 
see  it s not great timing 
you almost kill yourself
on the highway   
   so you can ask me out
and then you don t show 
then you keep my picture   
   but when i kiss you  you try to
shove me out the door  what s 
what s going on 
don t you care about me at all 
johnny 
you know you can talk to me 
you can tell me anything 
please 
you wouldn t believe me anyway 
try me 
you ll think i m crazy 
maybe i am crazy 
i hope i m crazy 
in my job  i ve seen and heard
just about everything 
so there is nothing you can tell me
that s gonna surprise me 
off the record 
yeah 
i sold my soul to the devil 
and now i have to spare you 
  spare me from what 
  the devil  on account i work for him 
that s why i couldn t make it to dinner 
because you were
working for the devil 
well  yeah  i m his bounty hunter 
but it only happens at night 
like it is right now 
whenever i m around evil   
evil people  evil spirits 
  i change into   
what 
just a great big monster 
but i am learning to   
i m getting control of it 
i m trying to 
so tonight  you ll   
i believe so 
which is why it s probably
a very good idea   
   that you run on home now  roxie 
you re serious 
so this is your excuse 
for the past  for last night 
for everything 
the way i see it is
i ve got a couple of choices 
i could either accept that you really
believe what you re telling me is true   
   and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital 
you see  now that   
or i realize that you d rather
make up ridiculous stories   
   than be honest with me   
   and i walk out of that door   
   forever 
  don t move 
  hands up 
hands where we can see them 
right over your head 
johnny blaze 
yeah 
captain jack dolan 
this is officer edwards 
you re coming with us 
okay 
let s try this again 
what about him 
you remember him 
this guy was three years
from retirement   
   never harmed a fly 
in fact  neither did
most of the corpses turning up   
   since you came home 
you son of a bitch 
  i didn t kill anybody 
  bullshit 
okay  let s take a breather 
  it s warm in here 
  warm 
yeah  i m burning up  aren t you 
a little 
you want a cigarette 
okay 
mind if i do 
okay  that was weird 
look  johnny 
i m not asking for your help 
i m asking you to help yourself 
i watch a lot of tv
and i know what you re doing 
good cop  bad cop 
but you re both good cops 
and you provide
a very  very important civil service 
in fact  when i finish my stunt career   
   i intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman 
so i d love to help you 
but i didn t kill anybody 
jesus christ 
you gotta let me go 
the real killer s out there 
  lookie here 
  but you re making a mistake 
what ve we got 
come on  move your ass 
blaze  riding up to meet us 
oh  god  oh  please  please 
you don t wanna put me in there 
sorry  the ritz was booked 
oh  god

what s he gotta do with this 
remember that contract
the stranger made   
   with the people of san venganza 
the story goes that slade
was sent there to collect all the souls 
but what he found there was so evil   
   that he took the contract
and rode off 
he stole it 
keep mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it 
some people say
he was buried with it 
  was he 
  i don t know

lately  he s been reading
these really weird books

roxanne 
mack 
roxanne

i have no soul to burn 
i guess the caretaker
forgot to mention that  huh 
surprise 
he sent you to bring me back 
i m not going back 
i like it here 
he thinks you re better than me 
i don t know who s more pathetic 
you or him

and maybe i ll spare your girl s life 
and  johnny

contract of san venganza 
hell on earth 
now  you re gonna have to trust me 
and why is that 
he may have my soul   
   but he doesn t have my spirit 
any man who s got the guts
to sell his soul for love   
   got the power to change the world 
you didn t do it for greed 
you did it for the right reason 
maybe that puts god on your side 
to him  that makes you dangerous 
makes you unpredictable 
that s the best thing
you can be right now 
san venganza s 500 miles from here 
we better get moving 
 we  
i got one last ride left in me 
carter slade 
can you keep up 
let s ride 
stick to the shadows 
this is end of the trail for me 
i got nothing left 
i could only change one more time 
and i was saving it for this 
god knows i ve made
my share of mistakes 
been trying to make things right
ever since 
guess all i can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance 
thank you

i made the deal 
i m the only one
who can walk in both worlds 
i m ghost rider

come on  you son of a bitch 
all of your world   
   all of your souls   
   will be mine now 
  throw me the gun 
  it s out 
throw it 
how does it feel to have
all that evil inside of you 
all their power 
all their souls 
a thousand souls to burn 
look into my eyes 
your souls are stained
by the blood of the innocent 
feel their pain 
  father  the son and the holy spirit 
kill you 
stop it 
oh  god 
monster 
i m not afraid 
congratulations  johnny 
you upheld your end of the bargain 
it s time i take back
the power of the ghost rider 
you get your life back 
the love you ve always wanted 
you can start a family of your own 
there are more deals to be made 
more people willing to give their souls
for what they desire 
let someone else carry this curse 
you re free now 
after all   
   a deal s a deal 
no 
i m gonna own this curse   
   and i m gonna use it against you 
whenever innocent blood is spilt   
   it ll be my father s blood   
   and you ll find me there 
a spirit of vengeance   
   fighting fire with fire 
i will make you pay for this 
you can t live in fear 
no 
so where will you go now 
wherever the road takes me  i guess 
my daddy once said   if you don t
make a choice  the choice makes you  
yeah  but why do your choices
always keep us apart 
sure wish things could have
turned out different 
no  this is what you are 
this is what
you always were meant to be 
you got your second chance 
go out there and make the best of it 
it s said that the west
was built on legends   
   and that legends are
a way of understanding   
   things greater than ourselves 
forces that shape our lives 
events that defy explanation 
individuals whose lives
