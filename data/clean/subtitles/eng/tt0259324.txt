make sense of things too great
or too terrifying to believe
this is the legend of the ghost rider
story goes that
every generation has one
some damned soul
cursed to ride the earth
collecting on the devils deals
many years ago a ghost rider was
sent to the village of san venganza
to fetch a contract
worth 1000 evil souls
but that contract was so powerful
he knew he could never let
the devil get his hands on it
so he did what no rider
has ever done before
he outran the devil himself
the thing about legends is
sometimes theyre true

what
youre wondering if your bike
looks normal it does
and to answer your other questions
last night did happen
it wasnt a dream
and it will happen again
who are you
question is who are you
you are the rider
the ghost rider
get used to it kid
itll be a lot easier
if you dont i got a nice cozy spot
picked out for you
theyve seen you now
theyll be waiting for you
youll need my help
you expect to last the night
last time i let a stranger help me
it didnt pan out so good
this aint something
you can run from kid
this day has been coming
since you made that deal
congratulations
your chances
just went from none to slim
sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link
between what happened
here in downtown
and the broken spoke massacre
in the desert
im roxanne simpson on scene
and were out
captain dolan
no comment
is it true they found a connection
between the massacre
and last nights victim
here at the city train yards
no comment
off the record captain
off the record
piss off
the rider is the devils bounty hunter
sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell
sterilize that for me
sterilize
in the boiling water
right okay
a little confused
during the day youll be normal
but at night
in the presence of evil
the rider takes over
i remember now
last night
there was some punk
and i could see all the wrong
hed ever done
and i turned it all against him
the penance stare
it sears the souls of the wicked
its the ghost riders greatest weapon
all the riders have it
have there been others
with my ghost rider problem
been a few
last one was 150 years ago
in a little town
called san venganza
nice town
nice people
till a stranger came along
making promises
one deal at a time
consumed by greed
they turned on one another
until the village of san venganza
drowned in its own blood
their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place
whats this have to do
with blackheart
blackheart
he sent you after blackheart
and others
the hidden
fallen angels cast out of heaven
by saint michael himself
they hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days
you better hang around here kid
they cant come
onto hallowed ground
thanks
and thanks for the info
i feel much better now that i know
im the devils bounty hunter
where you going
somebody i gotta see
thats a bad idea
it wouldnt be my first
whyd you do it
whyd you make the deal
i was a kid
whatd you get in return
heartache
oh my god
its hard to describe the destruction
here this morning
can i get you people
to stand back please
i dont know it seems like
something supernatural
could you tell us about
the good samaritan
well ill never forget him
thats for sure
he was tall broad shoulders
and thin really thin like bony
and he had this rad chopper
it was all flames and stuff
oh and his face was a skull
and it was on fire
on fire
yeah like
like that much fire
and i know it sounds weird
but it looked okay on him
i mean it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off
not sure what to add to that
im roxanne simpson on scene
thanks
roxie
dont
now hold on a second
let me apologize
last night was inexcusable
no apologies
see you did me a favor last night
because you made me think
of then and now
and when you left
yeah it hurt like hell
but you know what i got over it
and i went to college
i got a great job
but you johnny
youre just the same
oh better paid more fans
but youre still just a carny
yeah
oh man
my dad was right
you were just a phase
that went well
hey captain i got something
end of days
the host can gain control
of the possessing spirit
through concentration on
and manipulation of
the fire element
that exists within man
i am speaking to the fire element
within me
give me control
over the possessing spirit
hi
hi
hey i hope you dont mind
your lift was open
i came to apologize
im leaving town tonight
and i didnt want what i said today
to be the last words between us
thats okay
no its not
it was cruel and totally untrue
and i feel really terrible about it
please dont its okay
is something burning
oh that must be coming from outside
neighbors hibachi
bill he just got it
i still have that one
you what
i have that one too
i remember that day
there were a dozen people
waiting in line
and you went through
a whole roll of quarters
look at my face
you can tell i was just terrified
that my dad was gonna
come in any second
okay i just
its just i think i should
walk you to your car
see its not great timing
you almost kill yourself
on the highway
so you can ask me out
and then you dont show
then you keep my picture
but when i kiss you you try to
shove me out the door whats
whats going on
dont you care about me at all
johnny
you know you can talk to me
you can tell me anything
please
you wouldnt believe me anyway
try me
youll think im crazy
maybe i am crazy
i hope im crazy
in my job ive seen and heard
just about everything
so there is nothing you can tell me
thats gonna surprise me
off the record
yeah
i sold my soul to the devil
and now i have to spare you
spare me from what
the devil on account i work for him
thats why i couldnt make it to dinner
because you were
working for the devil
well yeah im his bounty hunter
but it only happens at night
like it is right now
whenever im around evil
evil people evil spirits
i change into
what
just a great big monster
but i am learning to
im getting control of it
im trying to
so tonight youll
i believe so
which is why its probably
a very good idea
that you run on home now roxie
youre serious
so this is your excuse
for the past for last night
for everything
the way i see it is
ive got a couple of choices
i could either accept that you really
believe what youre telling me is true
and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital
you see now that
or i realize that youd rather
make up ridiculous stories
than be honest with me
and i walk out of that door
forever
dont move
hands up
hands where we can see them
right over your head
johnny blaze
yeah
captain jack dolan
this is officer edwards
youre coming with us
okay
lets try this again
what about him

from retirement

whats really going on
carter slade
legend has it he was
a texas ranger man of honor
but he got greedy
found himself locked up
waiting on the gallows
stranger came to see him
offering freedom
slade made a deal
ended up a ghost rider
whats he gotta do with this
remember that contract
the stranger made
with the people of san venganza
the story goes that slade
was sent there to collect all the souls
but what he found there was so evil
that he took the contract
and rode off
he stole it
keep mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it
some people say
he was buried with it
was he
i dont know
what i do know is that blackheart is
coming and hell do anything to get it
thats why its important for you to
stay away from friends and family
anybody he can use against you
because he will
roxanne
johnny
johnny
god
sorry sorry
maam you gave me a start
im looking for johnny
yeah you and me both
have you heard from him

but i heard he got in trouble
he got arrested yeah what for
yeah well if this gets out in
the press his career is over
yeah trust me his careers
the least of it
you know you seem like a nice lady
and youre pretty and all
but we were riding the gravy train
on biscuit wheels
then you showed up
everything went to hell
so why dont you go back
to wherever it is you came from
i cant go back not now
then tell me what the hells going on
you wouldnt believe me if i told you
look you dont know me
but i love him
so if theres anything you know
that can help anything
lately hes been reading
these really weird books
and theyre messing with his mind
hes writing stuff down and staying up
late and he does it over here
you can go through this stuff
and i dont know if it means anything
wheres roxanne
dude whereve you been
everybodys out looking
where is she
shes out looking for you
jesus
not even close
you have his heart
now im gonna break it
roxanne
mack
roxanne
look into my eyes
your penance stare
doesnt work on me
i have no soul to burn
i guess the caretaker
forgot to mention that huh
surprise
he sent you to bring me back
im not going back
i like it here
he thinks youre better than me
i dont know whos more pathetic
you or him
now listen to me and try to get it
through that thick skull of yours
you dont work for my father anymore
you work for me
get the contract from the caretaker
bring it to me in san venganza
and maybe ill spare your girls life
and johnny
dont make me wait
figured youd be back bonehead
wheres the contract
i cant end this without it
just gonna have to dig
this whole damn place up myself
its not there kid
contract of san venganza
hell on earth
now youre gonna have to trust me
and why is that
he may have my soul
but he doesnt have my spirit
any man whos got the guts
to sell his soul for love
got the power to change the world
you didnt do it for greed
you did it for the right reason
maybe that puts god on your side
to him that makes you dangerous
makes you unpredictable
thats the best thing
you can be right now
san venganzas 500 miles from here
we better get moving
we
i got one last ride left in me
carter slade
can you keep up
lets ride
stick to the shadows
this is end of the trail for me
i got nothing left
i could only change one more time
and i was saving it for this
god knows ive made
my share of mistakes

guess all i can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance

fighting fire with fire
i will make you pay for this
you cant live in fear
no
so where will you go now
wherever the road takes me i guess
my daddy once said if you dont
make a choice the choice makes you
yeah but why do your choices
always keep us apart
sure wish things could have
turned out different
no this is what you are
this is what
you always were meant to be
you got your second chance
go out there and make the best of it
its said that the west
was built on legends
and that legends are
a way of understanding
things greater than ourselves
forces that shape our lives
events that defy explanation
individuals whose lives
