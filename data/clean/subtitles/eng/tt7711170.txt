your destination in four days
sorry
the next storm
is already developing
the lucky winners
of this past weekends
super lottery draw
hungry to know the meaning
and origin
of every new word she heard
fascinated by old buildings
and dying towns
her wit was
as there were
necessary obstacles
to her ideal life of animals
and plants and perhaps
not been an easy journey
not since she was 12
and had fled
from her adoptive parents
she would turn 42
that autumn
a whole lifetime to explore
sometimes the details didnt
seem to jive of course
sometimes names
were changed
chronologies
were inconsistent
as a freelance
graphic designer
move
