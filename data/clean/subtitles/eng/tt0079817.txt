hey butkus come here
butkus come here boy
what did you do today
huh
did you bark at
anybody today
yo adrian sometimes i look at butkus
and i dont think hes a normal canine
well what do you
think he is
i dont know
he just dont look like a
regular dog to me sometimes
you know when i look
inside there
earlier today i was down at
apollo creeds palatial gym
and as usual the world champion was not
at a loss for words about rocky balboa
look i know a lot of people out
there want to see me in a rematch
with a timid fellow who calls
himself the italian stallion
but this man does not have the honor to
meet me in the ring or is it scallion
now listen in fairness
apollo whats his name
what is your name
rocky balboa did
officially retire
yeah the bums hiding the bums
running he doesnt want to face me
hes scared
you know it and i know it
apollo i think theres
more here than meets the eye
youve been under close scrutiny ever
since that splitdecision victory
a lot of reporters apollo including
me thought it was an even draw
thats your opinion
and youre entitled to it
but now im ready
to have a rematch
to prove that this lucky club
fighter and thats what he was lucky
does not have the skill
to last five minutes in the ring
with a superior athlete like me
the mans running the mans hiding
the man doesnt want to face me
so i say to you rocky balboa
or whatever your name is
that i want
the american people to know
i want
the whole world to know
that im ready willing and
able to meet you anywhere
any place any time i will meet
and defeat this socalled fighter
who calls himself
the italian stallion
if the man only has the guts
to give me a call
and you can call me collect
call me balboa
this would be a legitimate rematch
the boxer against the puncher
and i think everyone wants to see
them back in the ring together
but theres only one problem
where is rocky balboa
ugly bum
you know
i was thinking that
i aint supposed to
do no commercials and
i aint supposed to
work in no meat house
im supposed to be
a fighter
but you gave that up
yeah
i think im becoming
a nobody again too
in whose eyes
not mine
in mine
in here
well get by
thats just it
i dont want you to get by
the hard way you know
i want you to have
good things
i want the kid to
have good things
well have them
i just think we need
them now dont you
rocky please
you dont have
to prove anything
adrian its all i know
i dont want you to do it
its all i know
adrian
you know
i never asked you to stop
being a woman you know
please im asking you please
dont ask me to stop being a man
please
i think we ought to
knock his block off
absolutely
rocky
im sorry
well
lets do it
apollo has a site been
chosen for the rematch
this fight will be held in
the philadelphia spectrum
cause i want this mans
hometown to see this
i want all of philadelphia
i want all of america
i want the whole world to see me
destroy this man after two short rounds
because after this fight
hes gonna have to donate whats
gonna be left of his body to science
but there wont be much
that i can guarantee you
rocky what do you think about the
fight taking place in the spectrum
well im very happy
about that
why
well its only about 10 minutes
from my house the spectrum
apollo a lot of people say
that you lost the first fight
a victim of
the southpaw jinx
did fighting a
lefthander throw you off
southpaw jinx nothing
last time i took the fight too lightly
and this man was just plain lucky
but this time this time you
all will see the real apollo creed
the world is gonna see
the real apollo creed
lightning fast and hard to catch
no playing no jiving just business
all right looks like
hes got a good chance
rocky do you think you have a
chance this time against apollo
i dont know
he looks pretty mad
me and mick
were gonna try our best
his lungs hes
gonna punch out
now whos that
al capone
i wouldnt sweat you
look here look here a lot of people
may not like me and thats okay
but come november apollo creed will
provide the ultimate gala spectacle
on thanksgiving in front
of this mans home crowd
im gonna drop him
like a bad habit
rocky your pay for the
fight is very substantial
what are you gonna
do with the money
well the first thing i gotta do
is i gotta pay the rent you know
and then well i made
this list on the way over
i was just thinking
of things to do
id like to get a couple
of hats and a motorcycle
and a couple of quarts of perfume
for adrian she likes to smell good
and some muppet toys you know
ernie and big bird and that frog
whats his name
kermit or something
i dont know
and i thought maybe
a statue for the church
and i think a snow cone
machine for you paulie
you like snow cones
dont you
yeah
rocky got anything derogatory
to say about the champ
derogatory
yeah hes great
how about some clowning shots apollo
yeah
does this look like
a circus to you man
come november
youre mine
hes very upset
well
see how smooth
he moves there
see how he pumps
that jab into your eye
yeah
you got guts to go back
in the ring with him kid
thanks a lot mick
your styles too
easy to figure out
i mean lefthanded fighters
theyre the worst you know
they lead with
their face mostly
trying to throw that big
left rights no damn good
they ought to
outlaw southpaws
yeah why didnt you
tell me this before
i didnt want to hurt
your feelings now look
to pull this miracle off
you gotta change everything
you gotta learn to be
a righthanded fighter
now this will confuse apollo
and itll protect that bad eye
i cant learn how to
fight righthanded no more
whats cant there aint no
cants theres no cants
now he will beat you uglier
than you are now
now listen you start
fighting righthanded
and then you change
suddenly
and thatll make history
but first you gotta get speed
demon speed speeds what we
need we need greasy fast speed
now ill show you a trick how
to get some speed in them legs

now listen i want you
to try listen to me
i want you to try to
chase this little chicken
