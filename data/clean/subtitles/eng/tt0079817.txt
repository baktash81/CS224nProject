hey  we can get the same money
for the two top contenders 
why go after balboa

because there s still a lot of
people out there that think he won

accusing me of having the fight fixed 
accusing me of being a fake 
and insulting my kids
at school  that s why 
you want to hear the truth 
yeah 
i want to hear the truth 
the truth is that last time
he was damn lucky

how s life in the bowl  you
gotta exercise once in a while 
would you like a little snacklet
or something  here you go 
come on  cuff  hey  link 
what  you drowning down there 
hey  want to hear some tv 
want to hear some tv 
the los angeles rams  the rams
defeated the buccaneers in overtime 
13 to 10  on frank
corell s 45 yard field goal 
hey  butkus  come here 
butkus  come here  boy 
what did you do today 
huh 
did you bark at
anybody today 
yo  adrian  sometimes i look at butkus
and i don t think he s a normal canine 
well  what do you
think he is 
i don t know 
he just don t look like a
regular dog to me sometimes 
you know  when i look
inside there 
earlier today i was down at
apollo creed s palatial gym 
and  as usual  the world champion was not
at a loss for words about rocky balboa 
look  i know a lot of people out
there want to see me in a rematch
with a timid fellow who calls
himself the italian stallion 
but this man does not have the honor to
meet me in the ring  or is it scallion 
now  listen  in fairness 
apollo    what s his name 
what is your name 
   rocky balboa did
officially retire 
yeah  the bum s hiding  the bum s
running  he doesn t want to face me 
he s scared 
you know it and i know it 
apollo  i think there s
more here than meets the eye 
you ve been under close scrutiny ever
since that split decision victory 
a lot of reporters  apollo  including
me  thought it was an even draw 
that s your opinion
and you re entitled to it 
but now i m ready
to have a rematch 
to prove that this lucky club
fighter  and that s what he was  lucky 
does not have the skill
to last five minutes in the ring
with a superior athlete like me 
the man s running  the man s hiding 
the man doesn t want to face me 
so i say to you  rocky balboa 
or whatever your name is 
that i want
the american people to know 
i want
the whole world to know 
that i m ready  willing  and
able to meet you anywhere 
any place  any time  i will meet
and defeat this so called fighter 
who calls himself
the italian stallion 
if the man only has the guts
to give me a call 
and you can call me collect 
call me  balboa 
this would be a legitimate rematch 
the boxer against the puncher 
and i think everyone wants to see
them back in the ring together 
but there s only one problem 
where is rocky balboa 
ugly bum 
you know 
i was thinking that
i ain t supposed to
do no commercials and
i ain t supposed to
work in no meat house 
i m supposed to be
a fighter 
but you gave that up 
yeah 
i think i m becoming
a nobody again  too 
in whose eyes 
not mine 
in mine 
in here 
we ll get by 
that s just it 
i don t want you to get by
the hard way  you know 
i want you to have
good things 
i want the kid to
have good things 
we ll have them 
i just think we need
them now  don t you 
rocky  please   
you don t have
to prove anything 
adrian  it s all i know 
i don t want you to do it 
it s all i know 
adrian 
you know 
i never asked you to stop
being a woman  you know 
please  i m asking you  please 
don t ask me to stop being a man 
please 
i think we ought to
knock his block off 
absolutely 
rocky 
i m sorry 
well   
let s do it 
apollo  has a site been
chosen for the rematch 
this fight will be held in
the philadelphia spectrum 
 cause i want this man s
hometown to see this 
i want all of philadelphia 
i want all of america 
i want the whole world to see me
destroy this man after two short rounds 
because after this fight 
he s gonna have to donate what s
gonna be left of his body to science 
but there won t be much 
that i can guarantee you 
rocky  what do you think about the
fight taking place in the spectrum 
well  i m very happy
about that 
why 
well  it s only about 10 minutes
from my house  the spectrum 
apollo  a lot of people say
that you lost the first fight 
a victim of
the southpaw jinx 
did fighting a
left hander throw you off 
southpaw jinx nothing 
last time  i took the fight too lightly 
and this man was just plain lucky 
but this time    this time you
all will see the real apollo creed 
the world is gonna see
the real apollo creed 
lightning fast and hard to catch 
no playing  no jiving  just business 
all right  looks like
he s got a good chance 
rocky  do you think you have a
chance this time against apollo 
i don t know 
he looks pretty mad 
me and mick 
we re gonna try our best 
his lungs he s
gonna punch out 
now  who s that 
al capone 
i wouldn t sweat you 
look here  look here  a lot of people
may not like me  and that s okay 
but come november  apollo creed will
provide the ultimate gala spectacle 
on thanksgiving  in front
of this man s home crowd 
i m gonna drop him
like a bad habit 
rocky  your pay for the
fight is very substantial 
what are you gonna
do with the money 
well  the first thing i gotta do
is i gotta pay the rent  you know 
and then  well  i made
this list on the way over 
i was just thinking
of things to do 
i d like to get a couple
of hats  and a motorcycle 
and a couple of quarts of perfume
for adrian  she likes to smell good 
and some muppet toys  you know 
ernie and big bird and that frog 
what s his name 
kermit or something 
i don t know 
and i thought maybe
a statue for the church 
and i think a snow cone
machine for you  paulie 
you like snow cones 
don t you 
yeah 
rocky  got anything derogatory
to say about the champ 
 derogatory  
yeah  he s great 
how about some clowning shots  apollo 
yeah 
does this look like
a circus to you  man 
come november 
you re mine 
he s very upset 
well   
see how smooth
he moves there 
see how he pumps
that jab into your eye 
yeah 
you got guts to go back
in the ring with him  kid 
thanks a lot  mick 
your style s too
easy to figure out 
i mean  left handed fighters
they re the worst  you know 
they lead with
their face mostly 
trying to throw that big
left  right s no damn good 
they ought to
outlaw southpaws 
yeah  why didn t you
tell me this before 
i didn t want to hurt
your feelings  now  look 
to pull this miracle off 
you gotta change everything 
you gotta learn to be
a right handed fighter 
now  this will confuse apollo 
and it ll protect that bad eye 
i can t learn how to
fight right handed no more 
what s  can t   there ain t no
 can ts   there s no  can ts  
now  he will beat you uglier
than you are now 
now  listen  you start
fighting right handed 
and then you change
suddenly 
and that ll make history 
but first you gotta get speed 
demon speed  speed s what we
need  we need greasy  fast speed 
now  i ll show you a trick how
to get some speed in them legs

is how we always used to train
in the old days

as rocky balboa prays in his corner 
the champion dancing over in his corner 
we re just seconds away from the
fight of the century  superfight ii 
and there s the bell 
and the champion
comes over in a hurry now 
and throws a couple of
rights and lefts out there 
he starts to take
command early here 
and now  he kind of moves his feet
along the side of the ring now 
rocky s holding that right
hand  he s fighting right handed 
i don t believe it  the southpaw
from philly is fighting right handed 
rocky  rocky

another right and another right
thrown by the champion 
three good right
hands bang at balboa 
they re in the corner 
and there s left to right 
here comes balboa
coming back at him 
a left and a right to the head 
and now back off of the ropes 
balboa appears to
be getting hit often 
but he seems to be
in pretty good condition 
a hard right hand thrown by
the champion  another right 
balboa is in trouble now 
he s in trouble 
taking rights and lefts as
the champion begins to open up 
it was a tremendous
right hand  balboa is down 
down goes balboa

we see apollo hit that bad left
eye  remember  from the first fight 
that s the eye that was cut the last
time  balboa getting up rather unsteadily 
go get him 
go after him  kid

yeah 
and the champion starts to move
in again  going right  left 
he s taking those punches pretty well 
and now balboa just comes right back 
tossed the ref right
into the ring post 
coming out now 
he wants at him 
balboa s tagged  left  left  and
right combinations by the champion 
another left  he s leaning
back  but there s the bell 
there s the end
of the round

bad blood between these two 
good round
