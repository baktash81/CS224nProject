i remember    a time of chaos   
   ruined dreams    this wasted land 
but most of all 
i remember the road warrior   
   the man we called max 
to understand who he was 
you have to go back to another time   
   when the world was powered
by the black fuel   
   and the deserts sprouted great cities
ofpipe and steel 
gone now    swept away 
for reasons long forgotten 
two mighty warrior tribes went to war   
   and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all 
without fuel they were nothing 
they d built a house of straw 
the thundering machines sputtered
and stopped 
their leaders talked    and talked   
and talked   
   but nothing could stem the avalanche 
their world crumbled   
the cities exploded 
a whirlwind of looting   
   a firestorm of fear 
men began to feed on men 
on the roads it was a white line nightmare 
only those mobile enough to scavenge   
   brutal enough to pillage would survive 
the gangs took over the highways   
   ready to wage war for a tank of juice 
and in this maelstrom of decay   
   ordinary men were battered
and smashed 
men like max   
   the warrior max 
in the roar of an engine 
he lost everything   
   and became a shell of a man   
   a burnt out  desolate man   
   a man haunted by the demons
of his past 
a man who wandered out
into the wasteland 
and it was here    in this blighted place   
   that he learned to live again 
don t hurt the snake  put it down   
   gently  gently    nice 
now the iron 
the gun 
down  down  turn around 
looks like i ve got myself
some gasoline  eh 
v8  eh 
booby trapped 
touch those tanks and boom 
booby trap  back up 
oh  you crafty little man  you 
you re quick    very quick 
never seen a man beat the snake before 
who are you 
reflexes    that s what you ve got 
me    l ve got brains 
a fella    a quick fella   
   might have a weapon under there 
i d have to pin his head to the panel 
don t play me the fool 
gas  fuel  gasoline 
thousands of gallons of it 
  as much as you want 
  where  where 
20 miles from here 
pumping it  they are  refining 
  a huge tanker full 
  crap 
no  it s true 
it s not self service  no 
it s too hard for me   
   but a man of your ingenuity   
where 
kill me and you ll never find out 
good dog 
nice doggy  eh 
well  there it is 
four days i was up here 
me and the snakes   
playing mah jong  taking tea   
   watching  thinking   
   how was i going to get in
and get the gas 
day and night it s pumping 
fuel to burn 
they ve got the lot 
power  lights  you name it 
you can bet your life they mean to keep it 
thirty of them in there 
arrows  flame throwers  guns 
no place for man or reptile  i thought 
then this trash arrived   
   as moths to a flame 
round and round  attack  attack   
   like angry ants 
mad with the smell of gasoline 
in the tanker  that s where they keep it 
thousands of gallons 
as much as you want 
if anyone s gonna get in there 
it s gonna be you 
me    l m gonna feed the snakes 
a man lives by his word  i reckon 
i ve kept mine  eh 
we had a deal  i show you the gas
and you let me go  right 
the arrangement was i wouldn t kill you 
after all i ve done for you   
i reckon you got a bargain  don t you 
attack  my vermin  attack 
onward  bring me the fuel 
for the glory of humungus 
for the great glory of humungus 
smegma crazies to the left 
the gate  gayboy berserkers to the gate 
i am your lord 
attack  my vermin  attack 
thank you  thank you  thank you 
save it 
i m just here for the gasoline 
as much as you like 
just take me back there 
show your weapons and come forward 
steady now 
take it real easy 
that s as far as you go 
turn around 
nathan  nathan  it s nathan 
lose them 
open the gate 
hurry up with that damned stretcher 
hey  that s fine  that s fine 
just stay there 
cover him  cover him 
come on  quick  quick 
oh  what a waste 
watch his leg 
you and your handiwork 
he didn t stand a chance 
i warned him  you all heard me 
 madness   i said 
 we can escape  take our gas   he said 
get that machine inside 
close the damned gate 
who are you 
how did you get through out there 
look  i want some answers 
where did you find him 
two or three miles down the road
left for dead  we had a deal 
there were three other vehicles 
did you see them 
they re heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble 
he said if i brought him back
you d give me some gas 
  now there s not much time 
  there was a woman in the car 
she s dead 
  what did they do 
  it was quick 
i just want my gas
and i want to get out of here 
for all we know he s one of them 
give him nothing 
she s right  he s a parasite 
trading in human flesh  mercenary trash 
  we had an arrangement 
  what do you mean 
you talk to this man 
try something  try something 
if you had a contract  it was with him 
and it died with him 
get rid of him 
left 
got to hand it to you  treasure 
the last of the v8 interceptors 
a piece of history 
would have been a shame to blow it up 
here they come  close the gates 
they re coming back 
hold your fire  he comes in peace 
for christ s sake  hold your fire 
greetings from the humungus 
the lord humungus 
the warrior of the wasteland 
the ayatollah of rock and roller 
i am gravely disappointed 
again you have made me unleash my dogs
of war 
look at what remains
ofyour gallant scouts 
why  because you re selfish 
you hoard your gasoline 
don t listen to him 
now  my prisoners say   
   you plan to take your gasoline
out of the wasteland 
you sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle 
a rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas 
what a puny plan 
look around you 
this is the valley of death 
see 
nothing can escape 
the humungus rules the wasteland 
give them nothing  blow it up 
humungus will not be defied 
wez  wez 
i ve got it  i ve got it 
quiet  quiet  no more games 
no more games 
we re here for a purpose 
we come with an offer 
no  no more talk 
we go in  we kill 
we ll kill them 
be still my dog of war 
i understand your pain 
we ve all lost someone we love 
but we do it my way 
losers wait 
we do it my way 
fear is our ally    the gasoline will be ours 
then  you shall have your revenge 
take him away 
there has been too much violence 
too much pain 
none here are without sin 
but i have an honorable compromise 
just walk away 
give me the pump   
   the oil   
   the gasoline   
   and the whole compound 
and i ll spare your lives 
just walk away  i will give you
safe passage in the wasteland 
just walk away and there will be an end
to the horror 
i await your answer 
you have one full day to decide 
we ll never walk away 
never 
you heard what he said 
it sounds reasonable 
we don t have to die 
all we have to do is walk away 
no  we ve worked too hard 
it s simple  all we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives 
look  if we walk out there 
they ll slaughter us 
they ll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs 
don t listen to them 
all right  this is it 
i ll talk to this humungus 
he s a reasonable man   
   open to negotiation 
he promised us safe passage 
he gave his word 
and let us suppose he keeps it   
   and we walk away from here
with our lives  what then 
but remember 
remember one thing 
that is more than just a tanker of gas 
that is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines 
that s 2 000 miles from here 
how do you expect us to get it there 
drag it 
if we have to  yes  there s always a way 
but the first step 
defend the fuel 
words 
just words 
you d die for a pipe dream 
we fight for a belief  i stay 
i wish it could have worked  pappagallo 
you can t expect to compete with that 
every day we get weaker
while they get stronger  it s finished 
i m sorry 
two days ago i saw a vehicle
that could haul that tanker 
if you wanna get out of here   
you talk to me 
okay  so that s my offer 
i deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker   
   you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as i can carry 
we lost eight good people this morning 
what s he got in mind 
now  to do the job
i need five gallons of diesel   
   and some high octane gasoline 
think of it as a down payment 
and that s the last we ll ever see of him 
he has to come back for his wheels 
what have we got to lose 
you ve got yourself a deal 
my vehicle and all the juice i can carry 
come on  dog

clean women 
nail polish  perfume

we re going to crash or crash through 
now  at this point  that s all they want 
the tanker 
so they ll come straight after us 
so we ll use that to punch our way out   
   which will give all of you a very 
very good chance 
now  don t hesitate 
once you re outside there 
split up and go as hard as you can 
now  200 miles to the north   
   there s a place with a bridge
called powder river 
that s our rendezvous 
give us till sunset 
if we haven t made it by then    keep going 
good enough for me to build 
but not to ride

and so began thejourney north   
to safety   
   to our place in the sun 
among us we found a new leader 
the man who came from the sky   
   the gyro captain 
and just as pappagallo had planned   
   we traveled far beyond the reach
of men on machines 
the juice  the precious juice 
was hidden in the vehicles 
as for me  i grew to manhood   
   and in the fullness of time 
i became the leader   
   the chief of the great northern tribe
