i remember a time of chaos
ruined dreams this wasted land
but most of all
i remember the road warrior
the man we called max
to understand who he was
you have to go back to another time
when the world was powered
by the black fuel
and the deserts sprouted great cities
ofpipe and steel
gone now swept away
for reasons long forgotten
two mighty warrior tribes went to war
and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all
without fuel they were nothing
theyd built a house of straw
the thundering machines sputtered
and stopped
their leaders talked and talked
and talked
but nothing could stem the avalanche
their world crumbled
the cities exploded
a whirlwind of looting
a firestorm of fear
men began to feed on men
on the roads it was a whiteline nightmare
only those mobile enough to scavenge
brutal enough to pillage would survive
the gangs took over the highways
ready to wage war for a tank of juice
and in this maelstrom of decay
ordinary men were battered
and smashed
men like max
the warrior max
in the roar of an engine
he lost everything
and became a shell of a man
a burnt out desolate man
a man haunted by the demons
of his past
a man who wandered out
into the wasteland
and it was here in this blighted place
that he learned to live again
dont hurt the snake put it down
gently gently nice
now the iron
the gun
down down turn around
looks like ive got myself
some gasoline eh
v8 eh
boobytrapped
touch those tanks and boom
boobytrap back up
oh you crafty little man you
youre quick very quick
never seen a man beat the snake before
who are you
reflexes thats what youve got
me lve got brains
a fella a quick fella
might have a weapon under there
id have to pin his head to the panel
dont play me the fool
gas fuel gasoline
thousands of gallons of it
as much as you want
where where
20 miles from here
pumping it they are refining
a huge tanker full
crap

its not selfservice no
its too hard for me
but a man of your ingenuity
where
kill me and youll never find out
good dog
nice doggy eh
well there it is
four days i was up here
me and the snakes
playing mahjong taking tea
watching thinking
how was i going to get in
and get the gas
day and night its pumping
fuel to burn
theyve got the lot
power lights you name it
you can bet your life they mean to keep it
thirty of them in there
arrows flamethrowers guns
no place for man or reptile i thought
then this trash arrived
as moths to a flame
round and round attack attack
like angry ants
mad with the smell of gasoline
in the tanker thats where they keep it
thousands of gallons
as much as you want
if anyones gonna get in there
its gonna be you
me lm gonna feed the snakes
a man lives by his word i reckon
ive kept mine eh
we had a deal i show you the gas
and you let me go right
the arrangement was i wouldnt kill you
after all ive done for you
i reckon you got a bargain dont you
attack my vermin attack
onward bring me the fuel
for the glory of humungus
for the great glory of humungus
smegma crazies to the left
the gate gayboy berserkers to the gate
i am your lord
attack my vermin attack
thank you thank you thank you
save it
im just here for the gasoline
as much as you like
just take me back there
show your weapons and come forward
steady now
take it real easy
thats as far as you go
turn around
nathan nathan its nathan
lose them
open the gate
hurry up with that damned stretcher
hey thats fine thats fine
just stay there
cover him cover him
come on quick quick
oh what a waste
watch his leg
you and your handiwork
he didnt stand a chance
i warned him you all heard me
madness i said
we can escape take our gas he said
get that machine inside
close the damned gate
who are you
how did you get through out there
look i want some answers
where did you find him
two or three miles down the road
left for dead we had a deal
there were three other vehicles
did you see them
theyre heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble
he said if i brought him back
youd give me some gas
now theres not much time
there was a woman in the car
shes dead
what did they do
it was quick
i just want my gas
and i want to get out of here
for all we know hes one of them
give him nothing
shes right hes a parasite
trading in human flesh mercenary trash
we had an arrangement
what do you mean
you talk to this man
try something try something
if you had a contract it was with him
and it died with him
get rid of him
left
got to hand it to you treasure
the last of the v8 interceptors
a piece of history
would have been a shame to blow it up
here they come close the gates
theyre coming back
hold your fire he comes in peace
for christs sake hold your fire
greetings from the humungus
the lord humungus
the warrior of the wasteland
the ayatollah of rock and roller
i am gravely disappointed
again you have made me unleash my dogs
of war
look at what remains
ofyour gallant scouts
why because youre selfish
you hoard your gasoline
dont listen to him
now my prisoners say
you plan to take your gasoline
out of the wasteland
you sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle
a rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas
what a puny plan
look around you
this is the valley of death
see
nothing can escape
the humungus rules the wasteland
give them nothing blow it up
humungus will not be defied
wez wez
ive got it ive got it
quiet quiet no more games
no more games
were here for a purpose
we come with an offer
no no more talk
we go in we kill
well kill them
be still my dog of war
i understand your pain
weve all lost someone we love
but we do it my way
losers wait
we do it my way
fear is our ally the gasoline will be ours
then you shall have your revenge
take him away
there has been too much violence
too much pain
none here are without sin
but i have an honorable compromise
just walk away
give me the pump
the oil
the gasoline
and the whole compound
and ill spare your lives
just walk away i will give you
safe passage in the wasteland
just walk away and there will be an end
to the horror
i await your answer
you have one full day to decide
well never walk away
never
you heard what he said
it sounds reasonable
we dont have to die
all we have to do is walk away
no weve worked too hard
its simple all we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives
look if we walk out there
theyll slaughter us
theyll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs
dont listen to them
all right this is it
ill talk to this humungus
hes a reasonable man
open to negotiation
he promised us safe passage
he gave his word
and let us suppose he keeps it
and we walk away from here
with our lives what then
but remember
remember one thing
that is more than just a tanker of gas
that is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines
thats 2000 miles from here
how do you expect us to get it there
drag it
if we have to yes theres always a way
but the first step
defend the fuel
words
just words
youd die for a pipe dream
we fight for a belief i stay
i wish it could have worked pappagallo
you cant expect to compete with that
every day we get weaker
while they get stronger its finished
im sorry
two days ago i saw a vehicle
that could haul that tanker
if you wanna get out of here
you talk to me
okay so thats my offer
i deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker
you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as i can carry
we lost eight good people this morning
whats he got in mind
now to do the job
i need five gallons of diesel
and some highoctane gasoline
think of it as a down payment
and thats the last well ever see of him
he has to come back for his wheels
what have we got to lose
youve got yourself a deal

and so began thejourney north
to safety
to our place in the sun
among us we found a new leader
the man who came from the sky
the gyro captain
and just as pappagallo had planned
we traveled far beyond the reach
of men on machines
the juice the precious juice
was hidden in the vehicles
as for me i grew to manhood
and in the fullness of time
i became the leader
the chief of the great northern tribe
