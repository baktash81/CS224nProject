life fades
vision dims
remains memories
remember time chaos
ruined dreams wasted land
remember road warrior
man called max
understand go back another time
world powered black fuel
deserts sprouted great cities ofpipe steel
gone swept away
reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior tribes went war
touched blaze engulfed
without fuel nothing theyd built house straw
thundering machines sputtered stopped
leaders talked talked talked
nothing could stem avalanche
world crumbled cities exploded
whirlwind looting
firestorm fear
men began feed men
roads whiteline nightmare
mobile enough scavenge
brutal enough pillage would survive
gangs took highways
ready wage war tank juice
maelstrom decay
ordinary men battered smashed
men like max
