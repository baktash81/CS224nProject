to offer the world   
   if you could just get people
to see it 
then you know exactly how it felt   
   to be me 
go ahead  flint 
what is the number one problem
facing our community today 
untied shoelaces 
which is why i ve invented
a laceless alternative foot covering 
spray on shoes 
  voila 
  they re so nifty 
how you gonna get them off  nerd 
what a freak 
he wants to be smart  but that s lame 
i wanted to run away that day 
but you can t run away
from your own feet 
not every sardine is meant
to swim  son 
i don t understand
fishing metaphors 
  what did i say 
  don t worry 
honey  i think your shoes
are wonderful 
everyone just thinks i m a weirdo 
so 
people probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too 
but that never stopped them 
i was saving this
for your birthday  but here 
a professional grade lab coat 
just like the real guys wear 
it fits perfect 
the world needs
your originality  flint 
you just have to grow into it 
and i know that you re gonna do
big things someday 
from that moment on   
   i was determined
to invent something great 
remote control television 
and  the pitch is in 
eventually 
hair un balder 
flying car 
monkey thought translator 
  hungry  hungry  hungry 
  how wise 
no  steve  no  no  no  no  no 
no  please  leave it   
ratbirds 
hey  what s going on  little guy 
flint lockwood 
my dream was to help
my hometown   
   a tiny island hidden under
the  a  in  atlantic    
   called swallow falls 
we were famous for sardines   
   until the day the baby brent
sardine cannery closed for good 
right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines   
   are super gross 
soon  all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted 
poached  fried  boiled  dried 
candied and juiced 
life became gray and flavorless 
but when all seemed lost 
i stared at defeat   
   and found hope 
my name is flint lockwood 
and i was about to invent
a machine   
   that turns water   
   into food 
steve  my best friend
and trusted colleague 
steve 
can i count on your help 
can 
i knew i could 
button  on 
memory  activate 
blueprints  awesome 
begin nano mutation 
radiation matrix  secure 
computer  boot 
coolness enhancement  complete 
engage coffee break 
networking power grid 
beginning conversion of water   
   into food 
hydrating protein matrix 
calibrating flavor panel 
priming chow plopper 
uploading cool machine voice 
cheeseburger 
everyone is going to love this 
flint 
sorry  dad 
steve  keep working 
scanning hand 
that s a really weird dude 
re energizing tower unit 
jeez  see you  dad 
flint 
don t you think it s time to give up
this inventing thing  get a real job 
no  why 
well  all your technology stuff 
it just ends in disaster 
the ratbirds  yes  they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate 
but i took care of that problem
and disposed of them 
billy  just play dead 
flint  you don t keep throwing your net
where there aren t any fish 
  what 
  i want you to work full time   
   at the tackle shop 
  the tackle shop  dad  no 
tackle is a good career 
please  i m so close with this one 
i just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it ll work 
and then you could sell food
in the shop   
   and then everyone won t have to eat
sardines anymore 
it is going to be so awesome 
i m sorry  son 
no more inventing 
dad  i know i can do this 
and mom did too 
it had been almost 10 years
since mom died   
   and dad still didn t understand me
like she did 
come on  let s open the shop 
tim and son
sardine bait and tackle 
you feeling it 
look out  baby brent 
baby brent sardines 
hand packed in swallow falls 
as your mayor  i know it s time to put
our sardine canning past behind us   
   and look to the future 
sardine tourism 
that s why 
without consulting anyone   
   i spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp   
   which i will be unveiling today   
   at noon 
featuring a live appearance
by baby brent himself 
what is up  everybody 
  hey 
  hey  it s baby brent 
what you doing  stacking cans
with me on them as a baby 
anyways  who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon   
   at the mayor s unveiling thing 
i ll be using these bad boys
to help save the town 
all right  you guys 
sardines  yeah 
  swallow falls forever 
  what a delight 
listen  you    maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling 
you know  dad  why don t you
go ahead  i ll hold down the fort here 
really  you sure you can handle it 
yeah  dad 
i m pretty sure i ll be fine 
all right  then 
i ll be back in half an hour  skipper 
okay  bye 
this hellhole is too small
for me  brent 
i wanna be big 
i want people to look at me and say 
 that is one big mayor  
and that s why this has to work 
it has to work 
otherwise  i m just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town   
   full of tiny sardine sucking
knuckle scrapers 
but not me  right 
oh  not you  brent  no 
you ve always been like a son to me 
hey  everybody 
under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans 
we just need 17 000 more gigajoules 
  an attraction so   
  go  go  go

now we re over to swallow falls   
   where our intern
is on her first day on the job 
or should i say  first gray on the job 
looks pretty cloudy there  intern 
hello  sam sparks  i m america 
it s swallow falls degrees and   
well  let s just go to the mayor 
thank you and welcome 
national television audience

those of you in the splash zone 
look out 
yeah 
cheeseburger 
flint lockwood

i m in the middle of a   
well  looks like things in swallow falls
are sardine to get better  for   
what just happened to me 
sorry 
no 
you re under arrest  flint lockwood 
thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to sardine land 
come on 
i really shouldn t be running

jump  jump  jump  run  run 
jump  jump  run 
  it s a good thing no one got hurt 
  flint lockwood 
i didn t get hurt  but that does

oh  my gosh  i am so sorry 
are you okay 
  i didn t get a chance to   
  it s okay  it s just pain 
sorry  i m not myself today 
my whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket 
wait a minute 
what is going on with your feet 
spray on shoes 
they don t come off 
cool 
this could solve
the untied shoes epidemic 
what are they made of  some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive 
yeah 
exactly 
i mean   
wow  they re shiny  i m sam 
  flint 
  steve 
  is that a monkey thought translator 
  steve 
incredible 
did you make all of this stuff 
  you hit me with a rocket 
  you kicked me in the face 
i said i was sorry 
do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game 
i spent my entire life building up
to that moment 
you get one shot at the show 
and if you don t make it   
   it s back to cleaning
the barometers 
cheese 
but that could only mean   
excited  excited 
my machine works 
it really works 
your machine 
is that what that rocket was 
do you like it 
i love it 
this is just amazing 
look at this 
this is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history 
hey  aren t you a weathergirl 
manny  get your camera 
this just in  our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more 
thanks  patrick  okay  everybody 
you are not gonna believe this one   
   but i am standing
in the middle of a burger rain 
you may have seen
a meteor shower   
   but you ve never seen a shower
meatier than this 
for a town stuck eating sardines 
this is totally manna from heaven 
this tastes significantly better
than sardines 
this is going to be big 
this food weather
was created intentionally   
   by meek ish backyard tinkerer
flint lockwood 
flint lockwood 
hi 
you re under arrest
for ruining sardine land 
flint  those burgers were awesome 
the producer called and he was like 
 everybody loves that food weather  
  food weather 
  what 
this could be bigger
than sardine land 
  can you make it rain food again 
  no 
  i don t know if l   
  you re gonna do it again 
you gotta be kidding 
please  please  please 
  yes 
  no 
  give me one more chance 
  we know this was an accident 
  i know 
  cheeseburgers from the sky   
   that s not natural 
my invention could save
the whole town 
you will be so proud of me  dad 
plus   
   there s a girl here 
can you look me in the eye and
tell me you ve got this under control   
   and it s not gonna end up
in a disaster 
yes 
i ve got this under control 
and it s not gonna end in disaster 
  all right 
  thanks  dad 
  oh  sure 
  okay  so  sam   
   this is where the magic happens 
lick  lick  lick 
lick  lick  lick 
welcome  flint 
you seriously spend
a lot of time alone 
what 
so here s how it works 
water goes in the top 
and food comes out the bottom 
when you shot it
into the stratosphere   
   you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer 
that s actually
a really smart observation 
i mean   
the clouds probably have water
in them   
   which  i guess  is why
you shot it up there in the first place 
right  right  that s why i did that 
  on purpose 
  right  yeah 
  right 
  of course 
okay 
the machine uses a principle
of hydro genetic mutation 
water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation   
   which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want 
so   
  pizza 
  yes 
  mashed potatoes 
  yes 
  peas 
  yes  that s also a food 
  steak  apples 
  yes 
  apple sauce  blt 
  yes 
  i said any kind of food 
  chicken wings 
think about what you re saying 
and if it s a food  yes 
  baloney 
  baloney  that is a food 
  how about jell o 
  do you like jell o 
i love jell o 
i love jell o too 
oh  and peanut butter  right 
oh  no  no  no 
i am severely allergic to peanuts 
hey  me too 
  what s it called 
  peanut allergy 
  no  the machine 
  of course 
it s called the flint lockwood
diatonic super mutating   
   dynamic food replicator 
or  for short 
the fldsmdfr 
fliminadifiser 
fldsmdfr 
fliminubahdibferer 
fli 
suh 
fdiferf 
manny  make sure you get this 
he s gonna make the food now 
now 
well  the thing is  i can t   
   wait to show you
this hilarious internet video 
what 
fight the power 
what is this 
it s so cute 
pushing  folding  connecting 
taping  turning 
painting  switching 
staring 
motivating 
  placing button 
  i can t believe i ve been watching this   
   for three hours 
  i know 
it s working 
what do you guys want for breakfast 
  gummi bears 
  whoa  steve  no 
we both know how you get
around gummi bears 
how about   
   eggs 
  and toast 
orange juice 
  and bacon 
  bacon 
what are you doing 
nothing 
to the computer 
so you re sure this is safe 
don t worry  i have a dangeometer
that lets us know   
   if the food is going
to over mutate 
what happens
if the food over mutates 
i don t know 
but that ll never happen 
all right  this probably
won t explode 
what 
bacon 
those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning   
   because a breakfast system
is on its way to swallow falls 
my forecast 
sunny side up 
  yeah 
  yeah 
flint  my boy  can you do lunch 
all right  here s the skinny 
you keep making it rain
the snackadoos   
   weathergirl provides
free advertising   
   i have taken out
a very high interest loan   
   to convert this podunk town
into a tourist food topia 
all you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day   
   every day
for the foreseeable future   
   and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island   
   as a must see cruise destination 
and everyone  everywhere   
   is going to love your invention 
do you think so 
i know so 
now that s what i call
poultry in motion 
mr  lockwood 
may i please have waffles 
  falafels 
  jellybeans 
  avocado 
  coming right up 
leftovers 
not a problem with flint lockwood s
latest invention  the outtasighter   
   so named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight   
   and therefore  out of mind 
jellybeans 
awesome 
  blt 
  doughnuts 
pie 
gummi bears 
  fish 
  crème brulee

he d also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner

this saturday   
   for the grand opening
of chew and swallow   
   a town that is truly a la mode

flint  this is the best breakfast ever 
that s it 
researching  role playing 
dialing 
waiting 
  sam sparks 
  hanging up 
regretting  re psyching

like you do as friends 
oh  my  what s that 
jell o s my favorite 
you never made a request  so   
   i made one for you 
flint 
flint 
join me 
but how did you    
i made it rain jell o  then i gathered
it up with the outtasighter   
   and then i brought it here
and pressed it   
   into a gigantic custom carved plastic
tupperware mold i made  no big deal 
everything s made of jell o 
this piano  those sconces   
   that ghetto blaster  that jell o 
that aquarium   
   that venus de milo
with your face on it   
   next to a michelangelo s david
that also has your face 
come on  sam 
what are you waiting for 
nothing 
yeah 
cannonball 
belly flop 
why did i do that 
  so jell o 
  right  right  right 
it s a solid  it s a liquid   
   it s a visco elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains  but you eat it 
i mean   
   it tastes good 
  why do you do that 
  do what 
say something super smart
and then bail from it 
can you keep a secret 
no 
but this time  sure  yeah 
okay  well  it was a really
long time ago  but i  too  was   
   a nerd 
too 
when i was a little girl   
   i wore a ponytail  i had glasses   
   and i was totally obsessed
with the science of weather 
other girls wanted a barbie 
i wanted a doppler weather
radar 2000 turbo 
but all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song 
it wasn t even clever 
four eyes  four eyes
you need glasses to see
go on 
so i got a new look   
   gave up the science y
smart stuff   
   and i was never
made fun of again 
and i still need these glasses 
but i never wear them 
  i ll bet you look great with glasses on 
  i m not   
and on they go 
  what 
  nothing 
wait 
it s a jell o scrunchie 
and now  the reveal 
wow 
i mean  you were okay before   
   but now   
   you re beautiful 
no  i m not  i can t go out in public
like this 
well  why not 
i mean  this is the real you  right 
smart 
bespectacled 
who wouldn t wanna see that 
you know  i ve never met anyone
like you  flint lockwood 
me either 
but about you 
flint  you have a call
flint  you have a call
is your phone ringing 
that s weird 
someone must ve changed my ring 
oh  it s the mayor 
do you mind if i take this 
no  no  no 
  go ahead  take it  that s fine 
  i m sorry  it s important

  flint lockwood 
  earl 
so no roof 
yep  you just hold out your plate 
and i even made it rain
your favorite 
meat 
okay 
so you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow 
well  the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon 
he said my invention
saved the town 
aren t you proud of me 
well   
   doesn t this steak look
a little big to you 
yeah  it s a big steak  i mean  every
steak is not exactly the same size 
did you even hear what i just said 
son  look around 
i m not sure this is good for people 
maybe you should think about
turning this thing off 
it s making everybody happy 
everybody except you 
when are you gonna accept
that this is who i am   
   instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop 
well   
   you seem like you know
what you re doing  then 
i guess i ll just get out of your way 
get with the times  man 
i mean  there s no pleasing
that guy 
he just wants to take anything good
i do and just smoosh it 
these are big hot dogs 
man 
i mean  this isn t that bad 
  is it  steve 
  yellow 
you re right  steve 
the dangeometer is in the yellow 
i don t know what to do 
i do   
   declare these hot dogs
to be delicious 
oh  no 
how did you get in here 
tomorrow s the big day  flint 
the entire town s fate is resting
on your food weather 
i m thinking pasta 
some light apps 
i know you won t let us down 
well  mr  mayor  i think there s
something you should see 
what 
this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week 
and this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today 
the machine uses
microwave radiation   
   to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food 
the more we ask it to make 
the more clouds it takes in   
   the more radiation it emits  the more
these molecules could over mutate 
i think that s why the food
is getting bigger 
here s what i heard 
 science  science  science  bigger  
and bigger is better 
everyone s gonna love
these new portion sizes 
i know i do 
my dad thinks i should turn it off 
geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers  flint 
but what if things go   
who needs the approval
of one family member   
   when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances 
not to mention that little cutlet 
sam sparks 
and me 
i ve always felt that you were
like a son to me  flint 
and i m gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon   
   save the town   
   and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are 
so here s the cheese 
you can keep it going   
   get everything
you ve ever wanted   
   and be the great man
i know you can be 
or you can turn it off   
   ruin everything   
   and no one will ever like you 
it s your choice 
choice 
choice 
choice 
choice 
choice 
okay 
i mean  bigger is better   
   right 
oh  yeah 
spaghetti  asparagus  celery 
garlic bread  meatball  shrimp 
  looks safe to me 
  and sanitary too 
who s hungry 
welcome  tourists 
to chew and swallow 
that is one big mayor 
delight in our nacho cheese
hot springs 
allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want   
   in our completely
unsupervised kid zone 
i ve got jellybeans for teeth
