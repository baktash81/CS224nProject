to offer the world
if you could just get people
to see it
then you know exactly how it felt
to be me
go ahead flint
what is the number one problem
facing our community today
untied shoelaces
which is why ive invented
a laceless alternative foot covering
sprayon shoes
voila
theyre so nifty
how you gonna get them off nerd
what a freak
he wants to be smart but thats lame
i wanted to run away that day
but you cant run away
from your own feet
not every sardine is meant
to swim son
i dont understand
fishing metaphors
what did i say
dont worry
honey i think your shoes
are wonderful
everyone just thinks im a weirdo
so
people probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too
but that never stopped them
i was saving this
for your birthday but here
a professionalgrade lab coat
just like the real guys wear
it fits perfect
the world needs
your originality flint
you just have to grow into it
and i know that youre gonna do
big things someday
from that moment on
i was determined
to invent something great
remote control television
and the pitch is in
eventually
hair unbalder
flying car
monkey thought translator
hungry hungry hungry
how wise
no steve no no no no no
no please leave it
ratbirds
hey whats going on little guy
flint lockwood
my dream was to help
my hometown
a tiny island hidden under
the a in atlantic
called swallow falls
we were famous for sardines
until the day the baby brent
sardine cannery closed for good
right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines
are super gross
soon all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted
poached fried boiled dried
candied and juiced
life became gray and flavorless
but when all seemed lost
i stared at defeat
and found hope
my name is flint lockwood
and i was about to invent
a machine
that turns water
into food
steve my best friend
and trusted colleague
steve
can i count on your help
can
i knew i could
button on
memory activate
blueprints awesome
begin nanomutation
radiation matrix secure
computer boot
coolness enhancement complete
engage coffee break
networking power grid
beginning conversion of water
into food
hydrating protein matrix
calibrating flavor panel
priming chow plopper
uploading cool machine voice
cheeseburger
everyone is going to love this
flint
sorry dad
steve keep working
scanning hand
thats a really weird dude
reenergizing tower unit
jeez see you dad
flint
dont you think its time to give up
this inventing thing get a real job
no why
well all your technology stuff
it just ends in disaster
the ratbirds yes they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate
but i took care of that problem
and disposed of them
billy just play dead
flint you dont keep throwing your net
where there arent any fish
what
i want you to work fulltime
at the tackle shop
the tackle shop dad no
tackle is a good career
please im so close with this one
i just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and itll work
and then you could sell food
in the shop
and then everyone wont have to eat
sardines anymore
it is going to be so awesome
im sorry son
no more inventing
dad i know i can do this
and mom did too
it had been almost 10 years
since mom died
and dad still didnt understand me
like she did
come on lets open the shop
tim and son
sardine bait and tackle
you feeling it
look out baby brent
baby brent sardines
handpacked in swallow falls
as your mayor i know its time to put
our sardinecanning past behind us
and look to the future
sardine tourism
thats why
without consulting anyone
i spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp
which i will be unveiling today
at noon
featuring a live appearance
by baby brent himself
what is up everybody
hey
hey its baby brent

an attraction so
go go go
what are you doing flint lockwood
just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully sir

a tomfool
you see my beautiful angel son cal
whats up
i love him so much
this is my only son
i want him to have a bright future
a future in which you dont ruin
our towns day
with one of your
crazy science thingies
well thats all behind me
you see this contact lens lockwood
this contact lens represent you
all right
and my eye represents my eye
okay
i got my eye on you
oh my gosh a jaywalker
hey
and ive arranged for live coverage
from a major network
and their most experienced
professional reporter
oh just send the intern
shes cute and shes super perky
well those are the only things we look
for in a tv weatherperson intern
how would you like to do a weather
report from a rinkydink island
in the middle of the ocean
as a favor to my cousin
really

temporary
professional meteorologist

and his flaming hoop of glory
those of you in the splash zone
look out
yeah
cheeseburger
flint lockwood
just a second
im in the middle of a
well looks like things in swallow falls
are sardine to get better for
what just happened to me
sorry
no
youre under arrest flint lockwood
thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to sardine land
come on
i really shouldnt be running
with these
jump jump jump run run
jump jump run
its a good thing no one got hurt
flint lockwood
i didnt get hurt but that does
not mean that im not still mad at you
oh my gosh i am so sorry
are you okay
i didnt get a chance to
its okay its just pain
sorry im not myself today
my whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket
wait a minute
what is going on with your feet
sprayon shoes
they dont come off
cool
this could solve
the untied shoes epidemic
what are they made of some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive
yeah
exactly
i mean
wow theyre shiny im sam
flint
steve
is that a monkey thought translator
steve
incredible
did you make all of this stuff
you hit me with a rocket
you kicked me in the face
i said i was sorry
do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game
i spent my entire life building up
to that moment
you get one shot at the show
and if you dont make it
its back to cleaning
the barometers
cheese
but that could only mean
excited excited
my machine works
it really works
your machine
is that what that rocket was
do you like it
i love it
this is just amazing
look at this
this is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history
hey arent you a weathergirl
manny get your camera
this just in our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more
thanks patrick okay everybody
you are not gonna believe this one
but i am standing
in the middle of a burger rain
you may have seen
a meteor shower
but youve never seen a shower
meatier than this
for a town stuck eating sardines
this is totally manna from heaven
this tastes significantly better
than sardines
this is going to be big
this food weather
was created intentionally
by meekish backyard tinkerer
flint lockwood
flint lockwood
hi
youre under arrest
for ruining sardine land
flint those burgers were awesome
the producer called and he was like
everybody loves that food weather
food weather
what
this could be bigger
than sardine land
can you make it rain food again
no
i dont know if l
youre gonna do it again
you gotta be kidding
please please please
yes
no
give me one more chance
we know this was an accident
i know
cheeseburgers from the sky
thats not natural
my invention could save
the whole town
you will be so proud of me dad
plus
theres a girl here
can you look me in the eye and
tell me youve got this under control
and its not gonna end up
in a disaster
yes
ive got this under control
and its not gonna end in disaster
all right
thanks dad
oh sure
okay so sam
this is where the magic happens
lick lick lick
lick lick lick
welcome flint
you seriously spend
a lot of time alone
what
so heres how it works
water goes in the top
and food comes out the bottom
when you shot it
into the stratosphere
you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer
thats actually
a really smart observation
i mean
the clouds probably have water
in them
which i guess is why
you shot it up there in the first place
right right thats why i did that
on purpose
right yeah
right
of course
okay
the machine uses a principle
of hydrogenetic mutation
water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation
which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want
so
pizza
yes
mashed potatoes
yes
peas
yes thats also a food
steak apples
yes
apple sauce blt
yes
i said any kind of food
chicken wings
think about what youre saying
and if its a food yes
baloney
baloney that is a food
how about jello
do you like jello
i love jello
i love jello too
oh and peanut butter right
oh no no no
i am severely allergic to peanuts
hey me too
whats it called
peanut allergy
no the machine
of course
its called the flint lockwood
diatonic supermutating
dynamic food replicator
or for short
the fldsmdfr
fliminadifiser
fldsmdfr
fliminubahdibferer
fli
suh
fdiferf
manny make sure you get this
hes gonna make the food now
now
well the thing is i cant
wait to show you
this hilarious internet video
what
fight the power
what is this
its so cute
pushing folding connecting
taping turning
painting switching
staring
motivating
placing button
i cant believe ive been watching this
for three hours
i know
its working
what do you guys want for breakfast
gummi bears
whoa steve no
we both know how you get
around gummi bears
how about
eggs
and toast
orange juice
and bacon
bacon
what are you doing
nothing
to the computer
so youre sure this is safe
dont worry i have a dangeometer
that lets us know
if the food is going
to overmutate
what happens
if the food overmutates
i dont know
but thatll never happen
all right this probably
wont explode
what
bacon
those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning
because a breakfast system
is on its way to swallow falls
my forecast
sunny side up
yeah
yeah
flint my boy can you do lunch
all right heres the skinny
you keep making it rain
the snackadoos
weathergirl provides
free advertising
i have taken out
a very highinterest loan
to convert this podunk town
into a tourist foodtopia
all you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day
every day
for the foreseeable future
and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island
as a mustsee cruise destination
and everyone everywhere
is going to love your invention
do you think so
i know so
now thats what i call
poultry in motion
mr lockwood
may i please have waffles
falafels
jellybeans
avocado
coming right up
leftovers
not a problem with flint lockwoods
latest invention the outtasighter
sonamed because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight
and therefore out of mind
jellybeans
awesome
blt
doughnuts
pie
gummi bears
fish
crème brulee
a pizza stuffed inside a turkey

flint this is the best breakfast ever
thats it
researching roleplaying
dialing
waiting
sam sparks
hanging up
regretting repsyching
saying what im doing
flint
hi sam how are you thats nice
i was wondering if you would like
to go on a da
activity with me tomorrow
okay
great bye meet me in the forest
nailed it gotta go steve
keep an eye on the lab for me
steve
foster still at the plate
and nobody out
where are we going
oh nowhere
i just thought itd be nice
for the two of us
to go on a walk together
like you do as friends
oh my whats that
jellos my favorite
you never made a request so
i made one for you
flint
flint
join me
but how did you
i made it rain jello then i gathered
it up with the outtasighter
and then i brought it here
and pressed it
into a gigantic customcarved plastic
tupperware mold i made no big deal
everythings made of jello
this piano those sconces
that ghetto blaster that jello
that aquarium
that venus de milo
with your face on it
next to a michelangelos david
that also has your face
come on sam
what are you waiting for
nothing
yeah
cannonball
belly flop
why did i do that
so jello
right right right
its a solid its a liquid
its a viscoelastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains but you eat it
i mean
it tastes good
why do you do that
do what
say something super smart
and then bail from it
can you keep a secret
no
but this time sure yeah
okay well it was a really
long time ago but i too was
a nerd
too
when i was a little girl
i wore a ponytail i had glasses
and i was totally obsessed
with the science of weather
other girls wanted a barbie
i wanted a doppler weather
radar 2000 turbo
but all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song
it wasnt even clever
foureyes foureyes
you need glasses to see
go on
so i got a new look
gave up the sciencey
smart stuff
and i was never
made fun of again
and i still need these glasses
but i never wear them
ill bet you look great with glasses on
im not
and on they go
what
nothing
wait
its a jello scrunchie
and now the reveal
wow
i mean you were okay before
but now
youre beautiful
no im not i cant go out in public
like this
well why not
i mean this is the real you right
smart
bespectacled
who wouldnt wanna see that
you know ive never met anyone
like you flint lockwood
me either
but about you
flint you have a call
flint you have a call
is your phone ringing
thats weird
someone mustve changed my ring
oh its the mayor
do you mind if i take this
no no no
go ahead take it thats fine
im sorry its important
i should be going too its getting late
im just gonna step outside
dad you came
i have so much to tell you
do i look all right
you look great come on lets go
dad i almost kissed a girl
its baby brent you know
it was the coolest thing hi
i should be on the list
hey brian
what youre letting that guy in
that guys a nerd
hey hows it going
oh thank you thank you so much
thank you
a toast
to flint and his delicious steaks
oh thanks thank you
very nice place
oh wow thank you
flint lockwood
earl
so no roof
yep you just hold out your plate
and i even made it rain
your favorite
meat
okay
so you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow
well the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon
he said my invention
saved the town
arent you proud of me
well
doesnt this steak look
a little big to you
yeah its a big steak i mean every
steak is not exactly the same size
did you even hear what i just said
son look around
im not sure this is good for people
maybe you should think about
turning this thing off
its making everybody happy
everybody except you
when are you gonna accept
that this is who i am
instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop
well
you seem like you know
what youre doing then
i guess ill just get out of your way
get with the times man
i mean theres no pleasing
that guy
he just wants to take anything good
i do and just smoosh it
these are big hot dogs
man
i mean this isnt that bad
is it steve
yellow
youre right steve
the dangeometer is in the yellow
i dont know what to do
i do
declare these hot dogs
to be delicious
oh no
how did you get in here
tomorrows the big day flint
the entire towns fate is resting
on your food weather
im thinking pasta
some light apps
i know you wont let us down
well mr mayor i think theres
something you should see
what
this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week
and this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today
the machine uses
microwave radiation
to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food
the more we ask it to make
the more clouds it takes in
the more radiation it emits the more
these molecules could overmutate
i think thats why the food
is getting bigger
heres what i heard
science science science bigger
and bigger is better
everyones gonna love
these new portion sizes
i know i do
my dad thinks i should turn it off
geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers flint
but what if things go
who needs the approval
of one family member
when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances
not to mention that little cutlet
sam sparks
and me
ive always felt that you were
like a son to me flint
and im gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon
save the town
and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are
so heres the cheese
you can keep it going
get everything
youve ever wanted
and be the great man
i know you can be
or you can turn it off
ruin everything
and no one will ever like you
its your choice
choice
choice
choice
choice
choice
okay
i mean bigger is better
right
oh yeah
spaghetti asparagus celery
garlic bread meatball shrimp
looks safe to me
and sanitary too
whos hungry
welcome tourists
to chew and swallow
that is one big mayor
delight in our nachocheese
hot springs
allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want
in our completely
unsupervised kid zone
ive got jellybeans for teeth
and when the fun is done
gaze upon the sunset
cresting over mount leftovers
from which were protected
by a presumably indestructible dam
weve got people here today
from all around the world
from as far as china
to west virginia
also i think theres
some canadians here
you need to look at this
why arent you on tv
youre supposed
to be broadcasting this
theres a problem
the foods getting bigger
i know its great bigger portion sizes
everyone loves it
im not sure were doing
the right thing here
what if weve bitten off more
than we can chew
for the first time in my life everybody
loves something that ive done
why cant you just be
happy for me
and go say the weather
or something jeez
and without further ado
our towns hero
and my metaphorical son
flint lockwood
yeah flint
thank you thank you everyone

manny patch us through
go
cute report nancy
hey hey foureyes
can it patrick
we are about to be in the epicenter
of a perfect food storm
its going to spread
across the globe
ive calculated the coriolis
acceleration of the storm system
first itll hit new york
then paris
then the jiayuguan pass
in eastern china
and in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck
flint
flint
hey dad
what are you doing
well i tried to help everybody
but instead i ruined everything
im just a piece of junk
so i threw myself away
along with all these
dumb inventions
this is junk
this is junk
this is junk
oh son listen when your boat is
when its listing
and if its not running
you know
dont worry dad i get it
mom was wrong about me
im not an inventor
i shouldve just quit when you said
well
when it rains you put on a coat
dad you know i dont understand
fishing metapho
what
my coat
come on steve
weve got diem to carpe

redesigning virtualizing
cutting
welding forging
wiring
helping
testing
yes
flying car 2
now with wings
hey i had a weird dream
like this once
i have a macaroni
on my head
run
no school
still nothing nothing in the bottom of
the third inning
everyone
i want to apologize
especially to you sam
but i have a plan
this flash drive contains a kill code
i will fly up into that food storm
plug it into the machine
and shut it down forever
while you guys evacuate
the island using brea
this is all his fault get him
there he is get him
get flint
lets rock his car back and forth
hey
this mess were in
is all our faults
me i didnt even protect
my own son
look im as mad at flint as you are
in fact when he gets out of that car
im gonna slap him in the face
i know flint lockwood made the food
but it was madetoorder
and now its time for all of us
to pay the bill
thank you earl
sorry
its okay
lets go build some boats
yeah
im gonna go build a boat
im coming with you
youre gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm
i cant let you do this alone
oh sam im so sorry
are you kidding
well i just thought that we
no
okay
you are going to need a copilot
youre a pilot too
yes i am also a particle physicist
really
no that was a joke
i am also a comedian
lets do this thing
im coming too
brent thats okay
no its not okay
ive been coasting on my fame
since i was a baby
but it was all just an illusion
maybe up there
ill find out who i really am
the cars pretty full so
yeah
brent
okay
good luck son
steve
peasoup fog
manny hit the wipers
theres massive gastroprecipitation
accumulated around the machine
its almost as if its
inside a giant meatball
water goes in the top
a food hurricane
comes out the bottom
glad im wearing a diaper
anybody order pizza
hold on
the pizzas chasing us
sentient food thats impossible
unless its molecular structures
mutated into super food
thats been genetically engineered
to protect the fldsmdfr
pizza
pizza pizza pizza
that was close i mean can you
imagine if we lost this kill code
tims tackle shop
dad
youre okay great
i need a favor the fate of the world
depends on it
okay then skipper
what do you need
go into my lab get on my computer
and email a file to my cell phone
all right
want me to drive
yeah okay
youre a lot better than me
okay heres the plan
sam and i will enter the meateroid
through the intake here
which should lead us straight
