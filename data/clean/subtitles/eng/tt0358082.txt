kind of cute  ain  t it 
  good morning  tim 
  good morning  mr  bigweld  sir 
tim  who closed the front gate 
well  i just thought since   
we never shut the gate  tim 
shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas 
see  every day  robots come here
from hither and yon   
   bringing us new ideas 
and i listen to
every single one of them 
so remember  whether a bot is made
of new parts  old parts or spare parts   
   you can shine
no matter what you re made of 
he s talking to me  dad 
he sure is  son  he sure is 
okay  folks  let s get to inventing 
you know  i love to tinker   
    but all the tinkering in the world isn  t
useful unless it starts with a good idea 
so look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need 
one idea will lead to another 
and before you know it   
   you ve done it 
see a need  fill a need 
that s it  dad  i have to look for   
   a need 
easy  now

  i don t wanna die 
i was just kidding 
just put your head between your legs 
yeah 
there goes my stop 
i tell you  the things that fall off me   
it s embarrassing 
sorry

stick with me  i know this town
like the back of my hand 
hey  that s new 
excuse me  can i help you 
sorry  l

  that s me 
well  hey  tim 
who closed the gate 
it s never supposed to be   
yeah  okay  what do you want 
i d like to see mr  bigweld 
i m an inventor 
oh  why didn t you say so 
stand back 
thanks 
what 
i got you  you see  because you were
all excited and then  boom 
all right  i had my laugh  go on in 
now  that s funny 
the second time 
you really think i m gonna let you in 
but i m not 
sorry  kid  nobody gets in 
company rules 
company ru     well  then
how do they hire new inventors 
they don t  those days are over 
my advice  come back two years ago 
then the job is yours 
so remember  whether a bot is made
of new parts  old parts or spare parts   
   you can shine
no matter what you re made of 
my goodness 
what a remarkable legacy 
concern for the common robot 
you don t come across old fashioned
values like that anymore  friends 
and for good reason 
there s no money in it 
hello  memo to bigweld 
we re not a charity 
that s why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair 
he s a relic 
so i don t wanna hear another 
 where s bigweld  
we ll see him next month at the
bigweld ball  he always goes to that 
now  let s get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny   
   out of
mr  and mrs  average knucklehead 
what s our big ticket item 
upgrades  people  upgrades 
that s how we make the dough 
now  if we re telling robots that no matter
what they re made of  they re  fine    
   how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves   
   to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better 
therefore  i ve come up
with a new slogan 
 why be you when you can be new  
i gotta tell you  i think it s brilliant   
   but  honestly  i d like to hear
what you employees think about this 
  hear  hear 
  out of the ballpark  ratchet 
just don t look down 
hey 
get off 
go on  get off 
get off of   
cappy  you haven t said a word 
  it gave me chills 
  thank you  thank you 
  but   
  but 
i m just wondering 
why would robots buy new upgrades   
   if parts are so much cheaper 
oh  right  well  that s easy 
because as of today 
we are no longer making spare parts 
do you know what i call robots
who can t afford upgrades  scrap metal 
you see them on the streets 
misshapen and rust covered 
they turn your insides out 
you wanna run home and scrub yourself 
now  cappy  i want your department
to push our new slogan 
in fact  i m moving you
into the office right next to mine 
we ll be working very 
very closely together on this one 
  wort that be fun 
  oodles 
  oh  so sorry  l   
  what the    
sir  i am a young inventor  and it has
been my dream to come to robot city   
   and to present my ideas
to mr  bigweld 
who doesn t seem to be here 
gee  no  no  but while he s away 
he left me in charge 
oh  well  then let me show you
what this can do 
i have a better idea  why don t you
let me show you what it can do 
it can do this 
so how did it go 
what the heck
is going on around here 
some highly polished jerk
is sitting in bigweld s chair 
and you re sitting
on the sidewalk  magnetized 
listen  i ll be back 
and i m gonna get to the bottom of this 
when you pick a lost cause 
you really commit 
where do they make dreamers like you 
get lost  freak 
all right  break time 
all right  break time s over 
chop chop 
look who s here 
  hi  mom 
  hi  sweetie  how s my boy 
great  i did just what you told me 
no more spare parts 
in a couple of weeks  those broken down
losers out there will be scrap metal 
you will be up to your bloomers
in broken elbow junk 
such a good boy 
and after you finish off bigweld   
   there will be nobody
out there to fix them 
exactly 
you wanna swing that one
by me again 
idiot  those outmodes look up to him 
  suppose he decides to come back 
  oh  come on  mom 
  he s not gonna be trouble where he is 
  what are you afraid of 
grow some bolts 
or do you want to end up
like your father 
hey  son  good to see you 
think what it would mean 
not bigweld industries

sitting by the phone   
   waiting for his brilliant son
to call

my first day was 
i know it s not your problem 
if you burden your friends 
you won t have any 
what are you  a fortune cookie 
 that s what friends

an embarrassment 
a way to rebel against your parents   
   a desperate cry for help 
the list is endless 
let s just stick with friend 
you know  even though you had
a discouraging day  remember

big  creaky door 
perfect 
look at this 
this is bigweld s actual workshop 
i recognize it from his old tv show 
could you keep it down 
we re not supposed to be here 
do you know what these are 
these are bigweld s
original invention designs 
  that s his own writing 
  this is strange 
how come it just stops in the middle 
look at this 
remember  he used to have
these on his show 
rodney  i don t know
how to tell you this  but   
why are they so dusty 
wait  don t 
this is much more elaborate
than the ones on his show 
rodney  what do we do 
i don t know 
this is kind of a first for me 
  yeah 
  it s him 
  who s the king of the beach 
  are you all right 
well  considering i m an old fat guy
who just crashed to the floor   
   i m fantastic 
now  who the heck are you 
i m rodney 
oh  i thought you were
the dominoes delivery boy 
come on  let s set them up again 
only bigger 
sir  is this what you ve
been working on 
this is why no one sees you 
young man 
nobody likes a chatterbox 
but there s a terrible crisis 
mr  bigweld 
we need to talk 
son  i ve gotta tell you 
you re making a lousy first impression 
please  sir  he is your biggest fan 
in fact  he s an inventor just like you 
  well   
  show him that thing you made 
a device  a doohickey 
a thingamajig 
now  don t be scared 
show mr  bigweld what you can do 
go on  it s okay 
is that what it s supposed to do 
it gets nervous under pressure   
son  let me give you
a good piece of advice 
  yes 
  give up 
what  you re telling me to quit 
i said  give up  
but  quit  works just as good 
is that what you did 
is that why you re sitting here   
   letting ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes 
kid  sometimes you just gotta know
when you re licked 
but you re bigweld 
you can fix anything 
i used to think so 
to me  having the company
was all about making life better 
with ratchet  it was making money
that came first 
i became old fashioned  an outmode 
go home  kid 
if he beat me  he s gonna beat you 
the world you re looking for
no longer exists  you missed it 
find some other foolish dream 
now  if you ll excuse me 
i m very  very   
   very busy 
yeah  i can see that 
all i ever wanted
was to grow up to be like him 
help  open the door 
open the door 
close the door  close the door 
wow  look at all these parts 
it s a smorgasbord 
look at that  so many things
i ve wanted all my life

let me look  please  i can t bear it 
no peeking  now  it s a surprise 
oh  you are a wicked boy 
and look

has any mother ever had a better son 
by the way  i found out
who s been fixing those outmodes 
so tomorrow  these babies   
   are gonna chop him up
along with all his buddies   
   and every other walking pile of junk
