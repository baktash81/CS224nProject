this here is the front gate
kind of cute ain t it
good morning tim
good morning mr bigweld sir
tim who closed the front gate
well i just thought since
we never shut the gate tim
shutting this gate means
shutting out fresh ideas
see every day robots come here
from hither and yon
bringing us new ideas
and i listen to
every single one of them
so remember whether a bot is made
of new parts old parts or spare parts
you can shine
no matter what youre made of
hes talking to me dad
he sure is son he sure is
okay folks lets get to inventing
you know i love to tinker
but all the tinkering in the world isn t
useful unless it starts with a good idea
so look around for a need and start
coming up with ideas to fill that need
one idea will lead to another
and before you know it
youve done it
see a need fill a need
thats it dad i have to look for
a need
easy now
hey there sport
oh hi

hey thats new
excuse me can i help you
sorry l
hey youre tim from the tv show

stand back
thanks
what
i got you you see because you were
all excited and then boom
all right i had my laugh go on in
now thats funny
the second time
you really think im gonna let you in
but im not
sorry kid nobody gets in
company rules
company ru well then
how do they hire new inventors
they dont those days are over
my advice come back two years ago
then the job is yours
so remember whether a bot is made
of new parts old parts or spare parts
you can shine
no matter what youre made of
my goodness
what a remarkable legacy
concern for the common robot
you dont come across oldfashioned
values like that anymore friends
and for good reason
theres no money in it
hello memo to bigweld
were not a charity
thats why old fat face
no longer sits in the big chair
hes a relic
so i dont wanna hear another
wheres bigweld
well see him next month at the
bigweld ball he always goes to that
now lets get down to the business
of sucking every loose penny
out of
mr and mrs averageknucklehead
whats our bigticket item
upgrades people upgrades
thats how we make the dough
now if were telling robots that no matter
what theyre made of theyre fine
how can we expect them to feel
crummy enough about themselves
to buy our upgrades
and make themselves look better
therefore ive come up
with a new slogan
why be you when you can be new
i gotta tell you i think its brilliant
but honestly id like to hear
what you employees think about this
hear hear
out of the ballpark ratchet
just dont look down
hey
get off
go on get off
get off of
cappy you havent said a word
it gave me chills
thank you thank you
but
but
im just wondering
why would robots buy new upgrades
if parts are so much cheaper
oh right well thats easy
because as of today
we are no longer making spare parts
do you know what i call robots
who cant afford upgrades scrap metal
you see them on the streets
misshapen and rustcovered
they turn your insides out
you wanna run home and scrub yourself
now cappy i want your department
to push our new slogan
in fact im moving you
into the office right next to mine
well be working very
very closely together on this one
wort that be fun
oodles
oh so sorry l
what the
sir i am a young inventor and it has
been my dream to come to robot city
and to present my ideas
to mr bigweld
who doesnt seem to be here
gee no no but while hes away
he left me in charge
oh well then let me show you
what this can do
i have a better idea why dont you
let me show you what it can do
it can do this
so how did it go
what the heck
is going on around here
some highly polished jerk
is sitting in bigwelds chair
and youre sitting
on the sidewalk magnetized
listen ill be back
and im gonna get to the bottom of this
when you pick a lost cause
you really commit
where do they make dreamers like you
get lost freak
all right break time
all right break times over

this is strange
how come it just stops in the middle
look at this
remember he used to have
these on his show
rodney i dont know

go on its okay
is that what its supposed to do
it gets nervous under pressure
son let me give you
a good piece of advice
yes
give up
what youre telling me to quit
i said give up
but quit works just as good
is that what you did
is that why youre sitting here
letting ratchet turn robots
like my father into outmodes
kid sometimes you just gotta know
when youre licked
but youre bigweld
you can fix anything
i used to think so
to me having the company
was all about making life better
with ratchet it was making money
that came first
i became oldfashioned an outmode
go home kid
if he beat me hes gonna beat you
the world youre looking for
no longer exists you missed it
find some other foolish dream
now if youll excuse me

very busy

look at that so many things
ive wanted all my life
