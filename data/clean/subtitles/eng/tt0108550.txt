all burger barns are built identical

there can be
a whole new restaurant there

i might be wearin  one of them
uniforms  flippin  some burgers   
saltin  some fries

to have that happen 
  if you guys would give it a chance   
  l l   
i just was saying that
it wasn t something that
i should be doing for myself 
look  they use canola oil  okay 
you know what canola oil is 
you probably don t 
  no 
  they probably don t even sell it
at lamson s grocery 
  no 
  it s cutting edge 
  it creates a crispier french fry and   
  well  that s   
and a more unique product 
and burger barn    forget wendy s 
forget burger king  forget mcdonald s 
that s  like  old hat 
burger barn s cutting edge 
i mean  l i could really
stand behind it  there s   
it s an innovative place  you know 
they created the salad bar   
which is now mimicked by every
single fast food chain in america 
  yeah 
  they came up with that 
fifteen different toppings
for each salad 
and two different kinds of lettuce 
and it s  you know 
it s all that you care to eat 
  i mean   
  yeah 
you either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager   
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain
