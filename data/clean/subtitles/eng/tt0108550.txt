thats like old hat
burger barns cutting edge
i mean li could really
stand behind it theres
its an innovative place you know

single fastfood chain in america

fifteen different toppings
for each salad
and two different kinds of lettuce
and its you know
its all that you care to eat
i mean
yeah
you either go from clerk to fry cook
