the way we felt about each other 
i thought we were invincible 
someone once said   if you want
something very badly  set it free   
 if it comes back to you 
it s yours for ever   
 if it doesn t 
it was never yours to begin with   
i knew one thing 
i was david s to begin with 
and he was mine 
light up my life   
we met in high school  david was
a senior and i was a freshman 
after glee club  he d drive me and
my best friend home from school 
i used to watch him
in the rear view mirror 
i fell in love with his eyes 
when i was 19 david proposed to
me on the pier at paradise cove 
our parents were against it 
they said we were too young 
we didn t know each other 
but david said that a life
without risk is like no life at all 
so we eloped 
i graduated from architecture school
and got a job at a small firm 
diana helped support us
by selling real estate 
i spent all my free time
working on a design of my own 
it summed up everything about
architecture that really mattered 
it was my dream house 
d 
have i ever told you i love you 
no 
  i do 
  still 
always 
we had our differences 
he d take his clothes off and leave
them on the floor  it made me crazy 
what do you think this is 
leaving your shoes on the table 
  i don t need to do your laundry 
  i ll pick it up  don t get violent 
  what about this 
  now  you put that down 
  you re gonna hurt somebody 
  i m gonna hurt somebody 
you re outta your mind 
ok  now  fine 
goddamn it 
now  come on  let s just relax 
  did i hurt you 
  no  i m all right 
  i m sorry 
  really  you were kidding 
d  your pants are on fire 
you have no idea 
we had no money  so for entertainment
david showed me architecture he liked 
but sometimes i d have to ask 
 why are we looking at
a stupid car wash  
and he d just say   no  not stupid  
 don t just use your eyes  
he made me look at things
differently 
david  this is a steal  it just came in 
nobody knows about it yet 
it s beautiful 
build a house here 
you d make a name for yourself 
because the house will be brilliant 
being by david murphy 
i found an incredible piece of property
in santa monica  by the ocean 
it was the perfect site
for david s house 
we ll borrow the money 
these leverage stockbroker buyout
guys  you should see the junk they buy 
they would go crazy
for a house of yours 
it was brilliant  even though
i didn t understand a word of it 
we had to economise
for the loan payments 
but it was our future
and i got to build my house 
and then the recession hit 
the real estate market dried up 
i hadn t closed a sale in six months 
construction fell to its lowest point
in years 
people were being laid off everywhere 
and i was one of them 
  i feel really bad about this 
  i don t understand  what happened 
the bank has called in
the demand note 
can they do that 
you don t have any income right now 
so they could attach your assets 
what assets 
your house 
gotta keep up those payments 
i m sorry 
david  i m scared 
we don t have any money 
what are we gonna do 
i ll wait tables or drive a cab
or something  i don t know 
i ll take care of you 
make it go away 
i was desperate 
we stood to lose everything 
the house i d been building 
even our own home 
i swallowed my pride and borrowed
 5 000 from my father 
it wasn t enough 
we needed  50 000 
  d   
  what

  in another life  have a good time 
  thanks 
who is that guy shackleford 
someone who works for me 
someone i trust 
he killed someone once 
tell me  where do you see
yourself in  say  ten years 
well  i wouldn t mind being
a billionaire like yourself 
nice shot  i mean beyond money 
what would satisfy you completely 
let you sleep well 
are you saying you re not satisfied 
who is 
i am 
she mean it 
i hope so 
well then  you may not have won
in vegas  but you re a lucky man 
i got money  i got security 
i have businesses 
but you have something
that i just don t have 
i guess there s limits
to what money can buy 
not many 
well  some things aren t for sale 
such as 
well  you can t buy people 
that s naive  diana 
i buy people every day 
in business  maybe  but not
when real emotions are involved 
what are you saying 
you can t buy love  isn t that a cliché 
  it s absolutely true 
  is it 
what do you think 
  i agree with diana 
  you do 
well  let s test the cliché 
suppose i were to offer
you one million dollars   
   for one night with your wife 
i d assume you re kidding 
let s pretend i m not 
what would you say 
he d tell you to go to hell 
i didn t hear him 
i d tell you to go to hell 
that s a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical 
but let s say that
there were real money behind it 
i m not kidding 
a million dollars  the night would pass 
but the money could last a lifetime 
think of it 
a million dollars 
a lifetime of security  for one night 
and don t answer right away 
but consider it 
seriously 
we re positive  ok 
then you ve answered my question 
and you ve proved your point 
there are limits to what money can buy 
it s late and i hate to admit it 
but i have a meeting 
may i have one dance 
of course  with your permission 
i think you d better
get on to that meeting 
you don t want to miss out
on your next billion 
understood 
i wouldn t part with her either 
goodnight 
can t sleep 
no 
me neither 
i just keep thinking about it 
it s so weird  isn t it 
yeah 
david  i think you want me to do it 
what are you talking about 
don t be ridiculous 
maybe we should just talk about it 
well  i don t want you to do it 
  but you d let me do it 
  no 
why  do you wanna do it 
no 
but i would  i d do it for you 
for me 
i can t believe we re even
talking about this 
think about what this money could do
for us  what it could do for our future 
you could finish your house 
you could pay your dad back 
get rid of our debts 
after all  it wouldn t mean anything 
it s just my body 
it s not my mind 
it s not my heart 
you think we could
do something like that 
we both slept with other people
before we were married  right 
yeah 
so we just have to look at it like that 
i slept with bubba aruzio  if i can
do that  i can sleep with anyone 
  you slept with bubba 
  you knew 
no  i didn t know that  when 
when you were off sleeping
with that slut olivia daigle 
  olivia deagle  and she wasn t a slut 
  excuse me  olivia beagle 
i do love you 
  she wasn t a slut 
  yes  she was 
no  she wasn t   
   unfortunately 
thank god we can laugh about it 
yeah 
that s easy to say now  after   
we just have to forget
it ever happened 
and never discuss it  not even once 
because nothing will have happened 
nothing that matters  anyway 
we have a brilliant script  very special 
it s a comeback vehicle for diana ross 
and billy ray cyrus 
kind of  a star is born    
so your first screenplay
sold for half a million 
  shoulda been two 
  except our lawyer caved in on us 
  that won t happen again 
  we re gonna get a lawyer that s tough 
someone that ll step on
his grandmother for us 
mr green  a david murphy
wants to speak to you urgently 
put him on the speaker 
this is an old college buddy 
it ll only take a second 
  jeremy 
  davey  i m in a meeting  what s up 
listen  we need you to close a deal 
  what kind of deal 
  a very big deal 
big deal  go on 
we re in vegas at the hilton  we met
john gage  you know who he is 
sure i know who he is  he s
a billionaire  and a major poon hound 
he is 
go on 
  he offered us a million dollars 
  a million dollars 
for what  your kidneys 
for one night with diana 
what do you mean  one night  like   
yes 
could you excuse me for a second 
let me get this straight 
he offered you a million dollars for a
night with your wife  your wife diana 
and you agreed  i don t know
what to say  how could you do that 
how could you negotiate without me 
never negotiate without your lawyer 
for a woman like diana  i could have
gotten you at least two million 
obviously  you don t wanna
get screwed and then screwed 
stay  please  this is damage control 
  two seconds  eat cookies 
  no  we ve heard enough 
  you re hired 
  you re our man  we love your style 
gladys  check the gentlemen s
schedules  call me next week 
  great 
  see you then 
  thanks for coming 
  no  thank you 
ok  david  before we go any further 
let s get the moral issue out of the way 
  leave that to us 
  no  i was referring to my fee  i get 5  
would you elaborate
on the verification clause 
verification  that means you pay  even
if the relationship isn t consummated 
you mean if i m impotent 
it s important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies 
i can live with that 
the  john garfield clause  
that s if you die in the act 
i have no problem with that either 
can i have your pen 
  you re pretty good  you know 
  thank you 
you should come work for me 
we have a deal 
a million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning 
so   
so   
so   
you can go 
gentlemen  i think it s time
for men of good will
to take leave of one another 
it s all right 
i don t bite 
so   
what  should i go undress 
cheer up  find a more creative way
to think about this  ok 
just look at it like an episode of  the
dating game  that went a bit awry 
  it s gonna be ok   
  ladies and gentlemen

do it for your own reasons 
or don t do it 
  you don t know him 
  i know he didn t stop you 
and if you were mine   
   i wouldn t share you with anyone 
you have no right to judge david 
you re the one who has to buy women 
you think i have to buy women 
why me  then

heads we do

turn the boat around  go home 
no hard feelings

it s your party 
it s my lucky dollar  so i can t lose 
trust me 
nothing s gonna happen
you don t choose 
  i love you 
  i love you 
i told myself it was over 
like a dream that vanishes
in the morning light 
and in time  enough time

  alta vista 
  that s right  murphy property 
we ve been a little late on
the payments  we want to settle up 
i don t think that s possible 
  what do you mean 
  the mortgage is two months in default
and it appears that the property
is in contract to another party 
  to another party  who 
  that s privileged information 
how can that be  we called
specifically for an extension 
the extension expired two days ago 
if you don t make a payment 
the bank can repossess 
without prior notice  can they do that 
they don t have to give us a warning 
but  in fact  an attempt was
made to call you on the 3rd 
a registered letter  return receipt
requested  was attempted on the 4th 
  apparently there was no one home 
  we were out of town 
well  i am sorry 
but you snooze  you lose 
 you snooze  you lose  
 you snooze  you lose  
  it s an expression

you have no reason to be jealous 
i hate him 
  tell me what happened on that boat

  why 
   cause i wanna know 
all right  i ll tell you 
the man was a fucking stallion

it s a lie  i would never do this
for myself  it was all for you 
don t lie to me 
you were attracted to him

i have a question for you 
excuse me  is there something
you d like to share with us 
i was just saying
that you re an amazing woman 
and beautiful 
and talented

  you re full of surprises  aren t you

i didn t know whether
you like big ones or little ones 
you re so beautiful  come here 
i didn t have much time
to do anything else 
but it s a start 
dance 
i should go 
i remember once when i was young 
and i was coming back from
a movie or something 
i was on the subway 
there was a girl sitting across from me 
she was wearing this dress that
was buttoned clear up right to here 
she was the most beautiful thing
i d ever seen 
and i was shy then 
so when she would look at me 
i would look away 
then  afterwards 
when i would look back 
she would look away 
then i got to where i was gonna get
off  and got off  the doors closed 
and as the train was pulling away 
she looked right at me
and gave me the most incredible smile 
it was awful 
i wanted to tear the doors open 
i went back every night 
same time  for two weeks 
but she never showed up 
that was 30 years ago 
and i don t think there s a day
that goes by that i don t think about her 
i don t want that to happen again 
just one dance 
you wanted the driver s side   
i want a word with you  gage 
what you don t know is
we got a secret  me and diana 
we re invincible 
  diana  i need to talk   
  tomorrow might be a better time 
tomorrow might be better  you think 
johnny baby 
i got a suggestion for you 
you know that emblem you got 
the gryphon  the eagle 
i don t think it s a good idea 
i got a better idea 
how about the cuckoo  because   
i m talking to you for a second 
the cuckoo is interesting 
it doesn t have its own nest 
so it moves into the nest of other birds
and destroys their eggs 
david  stop

and even that won t assure you a job 
louis kahn 
died in a men s room in penn station 
for days  no one claimed the body 
look at that  is that beautiful 
the money men did not weep 
because the great ones
are impossible to deal with 
they re a pain in the ass  because they
know that if they do their jobs properly 
if they just this once get it right 
they can actually lift the human spirit 
take it to a higher place 
  what is this 
  a brick 
good  what else 
a weapon 
louis kahn said   even a brick
wants to be something  
a brick wants to be something 
it aspires 
even a common  ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is 
wants to be something better than it is 
that is what we must be 
see you on friday 
a brick wants to be something 
i bet it doesn t want to be a lawyer 
  what are you doing here 
  i missed you 
  i missed you  too 
  thanks 
  how you doin  
  i m good 
i m getting it together 
she wants a divorce 
she wants her freedom 
if you don t contest it 
you get everything 
the land  the money  everything 
where is she 
hi  everybody  i m billy connolly 
goodbye  everybody 
you may wonder what you re doing
here  sitting in the blazing sun 
as the smell of the zoo
wafts past your nostrils 
the reason you are here
is because you are loaded 
may i say how brilliant it is
to see so many people
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species 
every year  we have this unique way
of making money for the cause 
we auction animals 
we bid as high as we possibly can 
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts 
let s start the show with a bang  we ve
got a superstar as our first animal 
ladies and gentlemen  the hippo 
the animal itself
is far too big and angry to bring along 
look at this guy 
thousands and thousands of pounds
of aggressive  hostile cellulite 
weighs slightly less
than the average school bus 
and look at that magnificent beastie 
to put him in a better light 
to relieve you of some serious money   
thank you very much 
   we have a kissy kissy picture 
isn t that nice 
ladies and gentlemen  i couldn t dream
of starting the bid below  10 000 
  now  i know it s a lot of money   
  30 
 30 000  ladies and gentlemen 
call me a sentimental old fool 
do i hear 35 
  35 
   35 000 
  40 
   40 000 
45 000 
  50 
   50 000 
i can t believe it  that s extraordinary 
50 000 once 
50 000 twice  ladies and gentlemen   
one million dollars 
i m sorry 
one million dollars 
did you say one million dollars  sir 
yeah 
ladies and gentlemen 
one million dollars 
would anybody care to top that 
ladies and gentlemen 
i didn t think so 
in that case  sir  i believe you re
the proud owner of a hippo 
congratulations 
hello  diana 
the next animal to take the stand
is an ostrich   
i really wanted you to have that money 
i really wanted you to have that hippo 
maybe you two would like
a moment alone 
so   
  how are you   
  i hear you re teaching   
  sorry 
  go ahead 
yeah  i m teaching 
you know  it doesn t pay much  but
at least i get to talk about architecture 
you know how i love
to talk about architecture 
don t leave  ladies and gentlemen 
it s just a shower 
a cheque book
makes an ideal umbrella 
do we have a dolphin 
have we a dolphin and an octopus 
how about tropical fish 
i know  you re running home
for more cash 
come on  ladies and gentlemen 
you can find the money 
to hell  i m gone 
i have to talk to you
about what happened 
  don t 
  no  i have to 
just hear me out 
i think the mistake i made in vegas
was thinking that i could
forget what we did 
i thought we were invincible 
now i know that the things that people
in love do to each other  they remember 
and if they stay together 
it s not because they forget 
it s because they forgive 
i was just   
i was just so afraid
that you wanted him 
no  actually  i was afraid
you were right to want him 
i thought he was the better man 
and i know now he s not 
he s just got more money 
i think we should talk 
i am very happy 
shackleford 
have you ever seen me like this 
can t say that i have 
  diana s the reason 
  enough for any man 
she is the best of them  absolutely 
you are the best of them 
 the best of them  
you said i m the best of them 
you are 
i don t understand 
shackleford 
could you explain it to her 
what 
i could do that  sir 
but i feel ms murphy
would rather hear it from you 
ok  all right 
she s the best of
the million dollar club  obviously 
   million dollar club  
  now you ve got it 
you told me you d
never done that before 
how many members
would you say there are 
  members 
  yeah 
  worldwide

i think a couple of dozen 
remember the one
that wouldn t stop hiccuping 
  what 
  the waitress from oklahoma 
every time you came near her 
she would convulse in hiccups 
yeah  i had forgotten  quite a night 
the best thing of it is that
you know if you re sexually compatible
right from the start 
shackleford  would you stop the car 
thank you  john 
goodbye 
goodbye 
here 
for luck 
  take care of him

seven years ago  david proposed
to me at paradise cove 
i wanted to go there to remember
and start over
