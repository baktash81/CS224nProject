the way we felt about each other
i thought we were invincible
someone once said if you want
something very badly set it free
if it comes back to you
its yours for ever
if it doesnt
it was never yours to begin with
i knew one thing
i was davids to begin with
and he was mine
light up my life
we met in high school david was
a senior and i was a freshman
after glee club hed drive me and
my best friend home from school
i used to watch him
in the rearview mirror
i fell in love with his eyes
when i was 19 david proposed to
me on the pier at paradise cove
our parents were against it
they said we were too young
we didnt know each other
but david said that a life
without risk is like no life at all
so we eloped
i graduated from architecture school
and got a job at a small firm
diana helped support us
by selling real estate
i spent all my free time
working on a design of my own
it summed up everything about
architecture that really mattered
it was my dream house
d
have i ever told you i love you
no
i do
still
always
we had our differences
hed take his clothes off and leave
them on the floor it made me crazy
what do you think this is
leaving your shoes on the table
i dont need to do your laundry
ill pick it up dont get violent
what about this
now you put that down
youre gonna hurt somebody
im gonna hurt somebody
youre outta your mind
ok now fine
goddamn it
now come on lets just relax
did i hurt you
no im all right
im sorry
really you were kidding
d your pants are on fire
you have no idea
we had no money so for entertainment
david showed me architecture he liked
but sometimes id have to ask
why are we looking at
a stupid car wash
and hed just say no not stupid
dont just use your eyes
he made me look at things
differently
david this is a steal it just came in
nobody knows about it yet
its beautiful
build a house here
youd make a name for yourself
because the house will be brilliant
being by david murphy
i found an incredible piece of property
in santa monica by the ocean
it was the perfect site
for davids house
well borrow the money
these leverage stockbroker buyout
guys you should see the junk they buy
they would go crazy
for a house of yours
it was brilliant even though
i didnt understand a word of it
we had to economise
for the loan payments
but it was our future
and i got to build my house
and then the recession hit
the realestate market dried up
i hadnt closed a sale in six months
construction fell to its lowest point
in years
people were being laid off everywhere
and i was one of them
i feel really bad about this
i dont understand what happened
the bank has called in
the demand note
can they do that
you dont have any income right now
so they could attach your assets
what assets
your house
gotta keep up those payments
im sorry
david im scared
we dont have any money
what are we gonna do
ill wait tables or drive a cab
or something i dont know
ill take care of you
make it go away

thanks
who is that guy shackleford
someone who works for me
someone i trust
he killed someone once
tell me where do you see
yourself in say ten years
well i wouldnt mind being
a billionaire like yourself
nice shot i mean beyond money
what would satisfy you completely
let you sleep well
are you saying youre not satisfied
who is
i am
she mean it
i hope so
well then you may not have won
in vegas but youre a lucky man
i got money i got security
i have businesses
but you have something
that i just dont have
i guess theres limits
to what money can buy
not many
well some things arent for sale
such as
well you cant buy people
thats naive diana
i buy people every day
in business maybe but not
when real emotions are involved
what are you saying
you cant buy love isnt that a cliché
its absolutely true
is it
what do you think
i agree with diana
you do
well lets test the cliché
suppose i were to offer
you one million dollars
for one night with your wife
id assume youre kidding
lets pretend im not
what would you say
hed tell you to go to hell
i didnt hear him
id tell you to go to hell
thats a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical
but lets say that
there were real money behind it
im not kidding
a million dollars the night would pass
but the money could last a lifetime
think of it
a million dollars
a lifetime of security for one night
and dont answer right away
but consider it
seriously
were positive ok
then youve answered my question
and youve proved your point
there are limits to what money can buy
its late and i hate to admit it
but i have a meeting
may i have one dance
of course with your permission
i think youd better
get on to that meeting
you dont want to miss out
on your next billion
understood
i wouldnt part with her either
goodnight
cant sleep
no
me neither
i just keep thinking about it
its so weird isnt it
yeah
david i think you want me to do it
what are you talking about
dont be ridiculous
maybe we should just talk about it
well i dont want you to do it
but youd let me do it
no
why do you wanna do it
no
but i would id do it for you
for me
i cant believe were even
talking about this
think about what this money could do
for us what it could do for our future
you could finish your house
you could pay your dad back
get rid of our debts
after all it wouldnt mean anything
its just my body
its not my mind
its not my heart
you think we could
do something like that
we both slept with other people
before we were married right
yeah
so we just have to look at it like that
i slept with bubba aruzio if i can
do that i can sleep with anyone
you slept with bubba
you knew
no i didnt know that when
when you were off sleeping
with that slut olivia daigle
olivia deagle and she wasnt a slut
excuse me olivia beagle
i do love you
she wasnt a slut
yes she was
no she wasnt
unfortunately
thank god we can laugh about it
yeah
thats easy to say now after
we just have to forget
it ever happened
and never discuss it not even once
because nothing will have happened
nothing that matters anyway
we have a brilliant script very special
its a comeback vehicle for diana ross
and billy ray cyrus
kind of a star is born
so your first screenplay
sold for half a million
shoulda been two
except our lawyer caved in on us
that wont happen again
were gonna get a lawyer thats tough
someone thatll step on
his grandmother for us
mr green a david murphy
wants to speak to you urgently
put him on the speaker
this is an old college buddy

he offered you a million dollars for a
night with your wife your wife diana

leave that to us
no i was referring to my fee i get 5
would you elaborate
on the verification clause
verification that means you pay even
if the relationship isnt consummated
you mean if im impotent
its important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies
i can live with that
the john garfield clause
thats if you die in the act
i have no problem with that either

the mortgage is two months in default

is in contract to another party
to another party who
thats privileged information
how can that be we called
specifically for an extension
the extension expired two days ago
if you dont make a payment
the bank can repossess
without prior notice can they do that

made to call you on the 3rd
a registered letter return receipt

i have something i wanna show you
i didnt know whether

youre so beautiful come here
i didnt have much time
to do anything else
but its a start
dance
i should go
i remember once when i was young
and i was coming back from
a movie or something
i was on the subway
there was a girl sitting across from me
she was wearing this dress that
was buttoned clear up right to here
she was the most beautiful thing
id ever seen
and i was shy then
so when she would look at me
i would look away
then afterwards
when i would look back
she would look away
then i got to where i was gonna get
off and got off the doors closed
and as the train was pulling away
she looked right at me
and gave me the most incredible smile
it was awful
i wanted to tear the doors open
i went back every night
same time for two weeks
but she never showed up
that was 30 years ago
and i dont think theres a day
that goes by that i dont think about her
i dont want that to happen again
just one dance
you wanted the drivers side
i want a word with you gage
what you dont know is
we got a secret me and diana
were invincible
diana i need to talk
tomorrow might be a better time

johnnybaby

you know that emblem you got
the gryphon the eagle
i dont think its a good idea
i got a better idea

and destroys their eggs

and even that wont assure you a job
louis kahn
died in a mens room in penn station
for days no one claimed the body
look at that is that beautiful
the money men did not weep
because the great ones
are impossible to deal with
theyre a pain in the ass because they
know that if they do their jobs properly
if they just this once get it right
they can actually lift the human spirit
take it to a higher place
what is this
a brick
good what else
a weapon
louis kahn said even a brick
wants to be something
a brick wants to be something
it aspires
even a common ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is
wants to be something better than it is
that is what we must be
see you on friday
a brick wants to be something
i bet it doesnt want to be a lawyer
what are you doing here
i missed you
i missed you too
thanks
how you doin
im good
im getting it together
she wants a divorce
she wants her freedom
if you dont contest it
you get everything
the land the money everything
where is she
hi everybody im billy connolly
goodbye everybody
you may wonder what youre doing
here sitting in the blazing sun
as the smell of the zoo
wafts past your nostrils
the reason you are here
is because you are loaded
may i say how brilliant it is
to see so many people
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species
every year we have this unique way
of making money for the cause
we auction animals
we bid as high as we possibly can
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts
lets start the show with a bang weve
got a superstar as our first animal
ladies and gentlemen the hippo
the animal itself
is far too big and angry to bring along
look at this guy
thousands and thousands of pounds
of aggressive hostile cellulite
weighs slightly less
than the average school bus
and look at that magnificent beastie
to put him in a better light
to relieve you of some serious money
thank you very much
we have a kissykissy picture
isnt that nice
ladies and gentlemen i couldnt dream
of starting the bid below 10000
now i know its a lot of money
30
30000 ladies and gentlemen
call me a sentimental old fool
do i hear 35
35
