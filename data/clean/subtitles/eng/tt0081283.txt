hey

the family s privacy 
i think it is
a very private matter 
i tell you my dreams

a psychiatrist are you

i believe in dreams 
sometimes i want to know
what s happening when you re awake 
something s making you nervous 
maybe i need a tranquilizer 
tranquilizer 
what do you think 
you look like something
out of the body snatchers 
it s not my impression
that you need a tranquilizer 
what is this 
a clock 
you can tell the time 
but i can t 
so you know when
the hour s up 
right 
50  55 minutes

how does it feel 
how does it feel 
yes

valerie isn t just
living away from home   
she s gone

worrying s just wasted energy

between control
and lack of feeling

we could see how it goes 
that was dumb 
now start over 
this is conrad jarrett 
i d love to  when 
i didn t see you 
what do you think 
fine 
rawlins used to have
great scotch pines 
they look like
skeletons this year 
hi  what do you think 
it s very nice 
what is wrong 
ask him what s wrong 
maybe you won t have to
hear it from carol lazenby 
hear what 
i quit the swim team 
carol thought i knew 
it happened over a month ago 
quit  when 
where have you been every night 
nowhere 
the library mostly 
i didn t think it mattered 
that was meant for me 
it s important to hurt me  right 
you have that backwards 
do i embarrass you
in front of friends 
 poor beth believes
every lie her son tells  
i didn t lie 
you did when
you came home at 6 30 
if the lying s starting again 
i can t stand it 
then go to europe 
she only gives a fuck because
someone else knew about it first 
she never came
to the hospital   
because she s busy going
to goddamn spain and portugal 
she doesn t care if i m hung up
by the balls out there 
they may talk like this
at the hospital   
but we re not at the hospital 
you never came to the hospital 
she had the flu
and couldn t come inside 
she would ve visited buck
in the hospital 
buck never would ve been
in the hospital 
that is enough 
i won t do it again 
what in hell has happened 
somebody better go up there 
he walks all over us   
then you apologize to him 
you ve been apologizing to him   
since he returned from the hospital 
i m trying to
goddamn understand him 
don t talk to me   
the way he talks to you 
let s not fight  okay 
no fighting  okay 
please 
let s go upstairs 
i want to talk to you 
i didn t mean any of it 
please don t be mad 
i m trying to
understand what happened 
i don t know what happened 
i didn t mean it 
tell her i m sorry  will you 
why don t you 
god  i can t 
i can t talk to her 
why not 
it doesn t change anything 
it doesn t change
the way she looks at me 
she was hurt because
you quit the team 
i don t mean just now 
i don t mean just today 
explain it to me 
i can t  you don t see things 
what things 
what things 
i want you to tell me 
can t you see she hates me 
she doesn t hate you 
you re right 
she doesn t 
please leave me alone 
do you think dr  berger s helping you 
it s not his fault 
i ll be downstairs if you need me 
tuesday everything was hunky dory 
you re the doctor 
don t take refuge
in one liners  okay 
because that pisses me off 
okay  okay 
everything was fine   
till you had the fight
with your mother 
i don t blame her 
she s got her reasons 
it s impossible   
after all the shit i ve pulled 
what shit have you pulled 
i m talking about proportion 
now  what shit 
you can find one example 
don t say you tried suicide 
what have you done lately 
i ll never be forgiven for that 
never 
you can t get out
the blood in her towels   
and in her rug 
everything
had to be pitched 
the bathroom tile
had to be regrouted 
she fired the maid   
because she couldn t dust right 
if you think i ll forgive   
she s gonna forgive me   
what 
i think i just figured
something out 
what 
who it is who can t forgive who 
 berger 
a real problem has a real solution 
 conrad 
i ve heard this before 
doesn t make it any less true 
i m so tired 
that s some secret
you ve been keeping 
so what do i do now 
recognize her limitations 
like she can t love me 
no  like she can t
love you enough 
don t blame her
for not loving you   
more than she s able 
she loves my father 
she loved my brother 
it s me 
we re back to
the rotten kid routine 
she can t love you
because you re unlovable 
how come your dad loves you 
he feels responsible 
besides  he loves everybody 
the guy s got no taste 
he loves you  but he s wrong 
look   
maybe she can t express it   
the way you d like 
maybe she s afraid
to show her feelings 
what do you mean 
there s someone
besides your mother   
you ve got to forgive 
you mean me 
for trying to off myself 
don t stare 
what for 
why don t you let yourself
off the hook 
what did i do 
what did i do 
we ll talk thursday 
come on 
time s up 
what did i do 
you know the rules 
what rules 
think about it 
just think about it 
jesus 
say  after going to a new high   
it falls to 1121 4   
and then rallies on good volume 
i order to buy 4 000 
if i get the 4 000 at 1133 4 
i know something s wrong 
but suppose i order
to buy the 4 000 shares   
and i plug in at 1133 4   
i get 2 000 at 114 
500 at 1141 4   
and the rest on the way up 
then i know i m right 
i m going to peel off here 
see you later 
 voice echoing 
suppose the order to buy   
 beth s voice 
you let him walk all over us   
and you apologize 
 man s voice 
500 at 114   
 conrad s voice 
dad  you don t see things 
 beth 
you ve been apologizing   
since he returned from the hospital 
tell her to stop it 
buck never would ve
been in the hospital 
she hates me 
i want to be clear 
that s good 
in the car 
i was thinking   be clear  
i suppose that s what
psychiatry s about 
being precise and clear 
and honest  of course 
i m not a great believer
in psychiatry 
okay 
what happens here
is between you and him   
and i respect that 
he s better 
i can see that 
i just don t believe in psychiatry   
as a panacea for everybody 
neither do i 
i wish i knew what
i was doing here 
you said you could shed
some light on some things 
i meant in terms of conrad 
i knew something was wrong   
even before he tried suicide 
but i thought that   
it s clear that he s very smart 
he s always been
an  a  student 
naturally  i thought
intelligent people   
could work out their problems 
but you still feel responsible 
yeah  sure i do 
it s hard not to 
it was just luck that
i happened to be there   
when he tried it 
we both could ve been away 
you think of yourself
as a lucky man 
no  no  no 
i used to think that
i was a lucky person   
before the accident 
i guess the whole of life   
is nothing but an accident   
what happens to you 
that sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter 
yeah  maybe 
maybe i am drifting a little 
i can see the two of them   
drifting away from me   
and i just stand watching 
what would you want
to do about that 
something 
i don t know what 
i feel like
i m sitting on a fence 
they re on opposite sides
of this fence 
yeah    no 
i don t know 
i see her not being able
to forgive him 
for what 
i don t know exactly 
being too much like her 
people always think that
she and buck are    were alike 
but it s really she and conrad 
they were the only two   
that didn t cry at the funeral 
it s not easy for me to admit this   
but  um   
she didn t   
his mother doesn t
show him much affection 
i m not trying
to put her down 
did she give buck
much affection 
god  yes 
she loved buck 
bucky got so much 
what she felt for him was special 
he was her first born 
and you 
i loved buck 
i mean your wife s affection 
for me 
yes 
she s very   
no  there s no problem
with her for me 
we ve been married
nearly 21 years 
everybody loves beth 
for conrad  it s been difficult 
he didn t talk about that 
we don t know what happens here 
it doesn t come up 
i guess that s what it is 
it s private here  isn t it 
mm hmm 
very private 
i think i know why i came here 
i think i came here
to talk about myself 
okay  why don t we 
hi 
 car buzzer alarm 
calvin 
 buzzing continues 
what s the matter 
this will sound strange 
what i m going to say
will sound strange 
what happened 
come inside 
could we talk about
buck s funeral 
what 
it ll seem trivial 
but it s on my mind 
i d like to talk about it 
when i was getting dressed
for buck s funeral   
what could getting dressed
for buck s funeral   
have to do with anything 
i was wearing a blue shirt 
you said   wear a white shirt
and other shoes  
it was nothing  but
it seemed to stay with me 
what difference did it make   
what i wore to buck s funeral 
hear me out  beth 
no one would listen to that 
i just want to talk about it 
why do you want to remind me 
because i ve wondered what
it mattered what i wore 
i was crazy that day 
we were going
to our son s funeral 
you were worried about
what i wore on my feet 
it sticks with me   
and i wanted to
tell you about it

when he passes exams 
i can t respond
when someone says   
 i did something
great  love me  
he wants to know
you don t hate him 
mothers don t hate their sons 
is that what he told you 
you accept what he says
with no questions 
i m trying to
keep this family   
what does everyone
want from me 
listen  we all just
want you to be happy 
happy 
yes 
you tell me
the definition of happy 
first  be sure your kids are safe   
that nobody s been hit by a car   
or drowned in your swimming pool 
then tell me how to be happy 
i m turning in 
dinner was good 
really good 
it s early  you tired 
it was a rough week 
your grandmother
wasn t too tough on you

good night 
 sobbing 
calvin

calvin  what did you say 
 sighing 
tell me 
you are beautiful 
and you are unpredictable 
but you re so cautious 
you re determined  beth   
but you know something 
you re not strong 
i don t know
if you re really giving 
tell me something 
do you love me 
do you really love me 
i feel the way i ve always
felt about you 
we would ve been all right   
if there hadn t been any mess 
but you can t handle mess 
you need everything neat and easy 
i don t know 
maybe you can t love anybody 
it was so much buck 
it s as if you buried
all your love with him 
i don t understand that 
maybe it wasn t even buck 
maybe it was just you 
maybe  finally  it was
the best of you that you buried 
but whatever it was   
i don t know who you are 
i don t know what
we ve been playing at 
so i was crying 
because i don t know
if i love you anymore 
and i don t know
what i ll do without that 
 door slams 
dad 
the yard looks smaller
without leaves 
dad  what happened 
your mother s
going away for a while 
where 
why 
back to houston 
i don t know 
why  what   
i know why 
it s me  isn t it 
no 
it s my fault 
don t do that to yourself 
it s nobody s fault 
things happen 
people don t always have answers 
i don t know why
i m yelling at you 
you should do
that more often 
haul my ass a little 
get after me 
like you did for him 
he needed it 
you didn t 
you were always
so hard on yourself 
i never had the heart 
oh  dad  don t 
well  it s the truth 
i never worried about you 
i just wasn t listening 
i wasn t sending
many signals then 
you couldn t do anything 
i should ve got
a handle on it somehow 
i used to figure you had
a handle for everything 
you knew it all 
you always made us feel
everything would be all right 
i ve thought about that
a lot lately 
i really admire you for it 
don t admire people too much
