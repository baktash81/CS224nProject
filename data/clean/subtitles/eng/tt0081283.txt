by the balls out there
they may talk like this
at the hospital

youre the doctor
dont take refuge
in oneliners okay
because that pisses me off
okay okay
everything was fine
till you had the fight
with your mother
i dont blame her
shes got her reasons
its impossible
after all the shit ive pulled
what shit have you pulled
im talking about proportion
now what shit
you can find one example
dont say you tried suicide
what have you done lately
ill never be forgiven for that
never
you cant get out
the blood in her towels
and in her rug
everything
had to be pitched
the bathroom tile
had to be regrouted
she fired the maid
because she couldnt dust right
if you think ill forgive
shes gonna forgive me
what
i think i just figured
something out
what
who it is who cant forgive who
berger
a real problem has a real solution
conrad
ive heard this before
doesnt make it any less true
im so tired
thats some secret
youve been keeping
so what do i do now
recognize her limitations
like she cant love me
no like she cant
love you enough
dont blame her
for not loving you
more than shes able
she loves my father
she loved my brother
its me
were back to
the rotten kid routine
she cant love you
because youre unlovable
how come your dad loves you
he feels responsible
besides he loves everybody
the guys got no taste
he loves you but hes wrong
look
maybe she cant express it
the way youd like
maybe shes afraid
to show her feelings
what do you mean
theres someone
besides your mother
youve got to forgive
you mean me
for trying to off myself
dont stare
what for
why dont you let yourself
off the hook
what did i do
what did i do
well talk thursday
come on
times up
what did i do
you know the rules
what rules
think about it
just think about it
jesus
say after going to a new high
it falls to 11214
and then rallies on good volume
i order to buy 4000
if i get the 4000 at 11334
i know somethings wrong
but suppose i order
to buy the 4000 shares
and i plug in at 11334
i get 2000 at 114
500 at 11414
and the rest on the way up
then i know im right
im going to peel off here
see you later
voice echoing
suppose the order to buy
beths voice
you let him walk all over us
and you apologize
mans voice
500 at 114
conrads voice
dad you dont see things
beth
youve been apologizing
since he returned from the hospital
tell her to stop it
buck never wouldve
been in the hospital
she hates me
i want to be clear
thats good
in the car
i was thinking be clear
i suppose thats what
psychiatrys about
being precise and clear
and honest of course
im not a great believer
in psychiatry
okay
what happens here
is between you and him
and i respect that
hes better
i can see that
i just dont believe in psychiatry
as a panacea for everybody
neither do i
i wish i knew what
i was doing here
you said you could shed
some light on some things
i meant in terms of conrad
i knew something was wrong
even before he tried suicide
but i thought that
its clear that hes very smart
hes always been
an a student
naturally i thought
intelligent people
could work out their problems
but you still feel responsible
yeah sure i do
its hard not to
it was just luck that
i happened to be there
when he tried it
we both couldve been away
you think of yourself
as a lucky man
no no no
i used to think that
i was a lucky person
before the accident
i guess the whole of life
is nothing but an accident
what happens to you
that sounds like
the philosophy of a drifter
yeah maybe
maybe i am drifting a little
i can see the two of them
drifting away from me
and i just stand watching
what would you want
to do about that
something
i dont know what
i feel like
im sitting on a fence
theyre on opposite sides
of this fence
yeah no
i dont know
i see her not being able
to forgive him
for what
i dont know exactly
being too much like her
people always think that
she and buck are were alike
but its really she and conrad
they were the only two
that didnt cry at the funeral
its not easy for me to admit this
but um
she didnt
his mother doesnt
show him much affection
im not trying
to put her down
did she give buck
much affection
god yes
she loved buck
bucky got so much
what she felt for him was special
he was her firstborn
and you
i loved buck
i mean your wifes affection
for me
yes
shes very
no theres no problem
with her for me
weve been married
nearly 21 years
everybody loves beth
for conrad its been difficult
he didnt talk about that
we dont know what happens here
it doesnt come up
i guess thats what it is
its private here isnt it
mmhmm
very private
i think i know why i came here
i think i came here
to talk about myself
okay why dont we
hi

bucks funeral

id like to talk about it
when i was getting dressed
for bucks funeral
what could getting dressed
for bucks funeral
have to do with anything
i was wearing a blue shirt
you said wear a white shirt
and other shoes
it was nothing but
it seemed to stay with me
what difference did it make
what i wore to bucks funeral

no one would listen to that
i just want to talk about it
why do you want to remind me
because ive wondered what
it mattered what i wore

tell you about it

you blame me
for everything
cant you see
beyond yourself

im just honest
stop being honest
and start being generous
think about him
what does he expect from me
he wants a hug
when he passes exams
i cant respond
when someone says
i did something
great love me
he wants to know
you dont hate him
mothers dont hate their sons
is that what he told you
you accept what he says
with no questions
im trying to
keep this family
what does everyone
want from me
listen we all just
want you to be happy

if youre really giving
tell me something

i feel the way ive always
felt about you
we wouldve been all right
if there hadnt been any mess
but you cant handle mess
you need everything neat and easy
i dont know
maybe you cant love anybody
it was so much buck
its as if you buried
all your love with him
i dont understand that
maybe it wasnt even buck
maybe it was just you
maybe finally it was
the best of you that you buried
but whatever it was
i dont know who you are
i dont know what
weve been playing at
so i was crying
because i dont know
if i love you anymore
and i dont know
what ill do without that
door slams
dad
the yard looks smaller
without leaves

your mothers
going away for a while
where
why
back to houston
i dont know
why what
i know why
its me isnt it
no
its my fault
dont do that to yourself
its nobodys fault
things happen
people dont always have answers
i dont know why
im yelling at you
you should do
that more often
haul my ass a little
get after me
like you did for him
he needed it
you didnt
you were always
so hard on yourself
i never had the heart
oh dad dont
well its the truth
i never worried about you
i just wasnt listening
i wasnt sending
many signals then
you couldnt do anything
i shouldve got
a handle on it somehow
i used to figure you had
a handle for everything
you knew it all
you always made us feel
everything would be all right
ive thought about that
a lot lately
i really admire you for it
dont admire people too much
