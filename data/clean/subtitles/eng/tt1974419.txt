i think youre perfect
i would never
say youre fat
but that doesnt mean
that someone else wont
understand
i see 20 or 30 girls
come in here every day
mostly from small towns
with big dreams
because some guy named chad
in the food court told them
they were beautiful
enough to be a model
and theyre all good
you
youre going to be great
some girls crack
under the pressure
but if you do okay
then we are off
to new york
youll work with
all the top designers
international
success
so the first thing
we need to do
is get you some pictures
that are a little less
amateur hour
no offence
jack macarthur is in town

i had to pull
some strings
but i sent him
your polaroids
and he has agreed to
do a test with you
how does that sound
it sounds great

sounds good
well theres just
a teensy bit of paperwork
ill need a copy of
your drivers license
and a voided check
and i can
take those right now
when did you graduate
from high school
im actually still
kind of working on it

in georgia the sky

makes being
a person down on earth
feel really small
you could feel
small here too
do you
sometimes
when i was a kid
i would sneak out
onto the roof at night
i thought the moon
looked like a big round eye
and i would look up
and id say
do you see me
i would stay out
there for hours
sometimes id fall
asleep just dreaming
about what
what i would be
what was that
i could never
figure it out
i cant sing
i cant dance
i cant write
no real talent
but im pretty

shave my jaw
i had a slight
eyebrow lift
new nose cheeks
inner and outer lipo
oh and they
pinned my ears

thats all right
we can just sit
over there
now set the teeth
and stretch
the nostril wide
hold hard the breath
and bend up
every spirit to
his full height
on on
and so on
and so forth
wow
did you always
wanna be an actor
well performing
always came naturally
to me
because
im a creator
all right
i build i make
its in my blood
so whether
im designing
a collection
or creating
a character
its all the
same right
i went out for
a film last week
oh yeah
how did it go
they said my face
didnt match my voice
well you can
fix your face
no dont do that
why not
because you can
always tell
when beauty
is manufactured
and if you
arent born beautiful
you never will be
thats terrible
no its true
i dont think you
can always tell
dean
were having a little
debate over here
and we need
your expertise
okay

shes fine
yes yes
thats exactly the word
that i was looking for
shes fine right
you can sit down
now thanks
thank you dean
now look at jesse
nothing fake
nothing false
a diamond
in a sea of glass
true beauty
is the highest
currency we have
now without it
she would be nothing
i think
youre wrong
excuse me
i said i think
youre wrong
so are you gonna
tell me that
its whats inside
that counts
yeah thats exactly
what i think
well i think
you wouldnt have
even stopped to look
beauty isnt everything
its the only thing
hey lets
get out of here
i wanna go
so go
what are you
doing here
what are you
is that what you want
you wanna be like them
i dont wanna be them
