i go to this guy
in beverly hills 
  andrew 
  dr  andrew 
she is in love with him 
of course i love him 
look at me 
he calls me
the bionic woman 
is that a compliment 
i hear your parents
are dead 
that must be
really hard for you 
do you have
other family 
no 
no one at all 
you must have
a boyfriend 
all she really
wants to know is 
who are you fucking 
sorry 
what 
isn t that
what everyone
wants to know 
a pretty new girl
walks into a room 
everyone s head turns 
looks her up and down 
wondering 
 who is she fucking 
 who could she fuck 
 and how high can she climb 
and is it higher than me  
i don t   
i don t know 
i just got to town 
so i don t know

he found me online 
be careful with that 
you re very fit 
thank you 
you re also
very young 
i think you re perfect 
i would never
say you re fat 
but that doesn t mean
that someone else won t 
understand 
i see 20 or 30 girls
come in here every day 
mostly from small towns
with big dreams
because some guy named chad
in the food court told them
they were beautiful
enough to be a model 
and they re all good 
you   
you re going to be great 
some girls crack
under the pressure 
but if you do okay 
then we are off
to new york 
you ll work with
all the top designers 
international
success 
so the first thing
we need to do
is get you some pictures
that are a little less
amateur hour 
no offence 
jack macarthur is in town 
do you know him 
no 
get to know him 
i had to pull
some strings 
but i sent him
your polaroids 
and he has agreed to
do a test with you 
how does that sound 
it sounds great 
it sounds   
sounds good 
well  there s just
a teensy bit of paperwork 
i ll need a copy of
your driver s license
and a voided check 
and i can
take those right now 
when did you graduate
from high school 
i m actually still
kind of working on it 
i need a parental
consent form 
you can go 
parental
consent form 
just one
signature there for
parental consent 
one little signature
and we re off 
when someone asks 
i want you to say

always 19 
eighteen

no one s going
to believe that 
honey 
people believe
what they are told 
hi

i bought you
flowers  but

anything about my
pictures

cool  that s cool 
come on 
don t forget me when
you re all famous now 
in georgia  the sky
is also this big 
makes being
a person down on earth
feel really small 
you could feel
small here  too 
do you 
sometimes 
when i was a kid 
i would sneak out
onto the roof at night 
i thought the moon
looked like a big round eye 
and i would look up
and i d say 
 do you see me  
i would stay out
there for hours 
sometimes i d fall
asleep just dreaming 
about what 
what i would be 
what was that 
i could never
figure it out 
i can t sing 
i can t dance 
i can t write 
no real talent 
but i m pretty 
and i can make
money off pretty 
so   
i think you re probably
good at a lot of things

a loaded baked potato
with a side of broccoli 
a pan seared halibut
served with rice

apparently  they think she
is gonna be this giant star 
jack shoots me
all the time 
that s not gonna last

who wants sour milk when

my surgeon  dr  andrew 
he pointed out a lot
of other problems
with my body 
so i had them
shave my jaw 
i had a slight
eyebrow lift 
new nose  cheeks 
inner and outer lipo 
oh  and they
pinned my ears 
why 
so i could wear
a ponytail 
didn t it hurt 
anything worth having
hurts a little 
besides  nobody likes
the way they look 
i do 
are you jesse 
mmm hmm 
they wanna
see you 
i already
had my fitting 
i m just the
messenger 
you 
i ve decided you re
gonna close the show 
    pry through
the portage of the head    
hi 
    like a brass cannon  
i want you to
meet my friend 
this is dean 
hi 
your name s bean 
no  dean 
dean 
dean  yeah 
dean  nice to meet you 
nice to
meet you  too 
well  come  join us 
have a drink 
sit down 
i don t think
there s room
for two 
that s all right 
we can just sit
over there 
 now set the teeth
 and stretch
the nostril wide 
 hold hard the breath
 and bend up
every spirit to
his full height 
 on  on  
and so on
and so forth 
wow 
did you always
wanna be an actor 
well  performing
always came naturally
to me
because
i m a creator 
all right 
i build  i make 
it s in my blood 
so whether
i m designing
a collection
or creating
a character 
it s all the
same  right 
i went out for
a film last week 
oh  yeah 
how did it go 
they said my face
didn t match my voice 
well  you can
fix your face 
no  don t do that 
why not 
because you can
always tell
when beauty
is manufactured 
and if you
aren t born beautiful 
you never will be 
that s terrible 
no  it s true 
i don t think you
can always tell 
dean 
we re having a little
debate over here 
and we need
your expertise 
okay 
you know
gigi  right 
well  i mean 
we just met 
will you stand up
so that he can take
a look at you 
go on  stand up 
well 
well  what 
what do you think 
do you think she is
beautiful 
i don t know 
i mean   
yeah  i guess
she s fine 
yes  yes 
that s exactly the word
that i was looking for 
she s fine  right 
you can sit down
now  thanks 
thank you  dean 
now look at jesse 
nothing fake 
nothing false 
a diamond
in a sea of glass 
true beauty
is the highest
currency we have 
now  without it 
she would be nothing 
i think
you re wrong 
excuse me 
i said  i think
you re wrong 
so are you gonna
tell me that
it s what s inside
that counts 
yeah  that s exactly
what i think 
well  i think
you wouldn t have
even stopped to look 
beauty isn t everything 
it s the only thing 
hey  let s
get out of here 
i wanna go 
so go 
what are you
doing here 
what are you 
is that what you want 
you wanna be like them 
i don t wanna be them
