that s all there is  
well  i m retired 
and my wife is dead 
as you can imagine  that s
given me some time on my hands 
my wife s been gone
for three and a half years 
i miss her in every way 
and retirement 
that is an ongoing 
relentless effort in creativity 
at first  i admit
i enjoyed the novelty of it 
sort of felt like
i was playing hooky 
i used all the miles i d saved
and traveled the globe 
the problem was  no matter where
i went  as soon as i got home 
the nowhere to be thing
hit me like a ton of bricks 
i realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving 
get up  get out of the house 
and go somewhere 
anywhere 
come rain or shine 
i m at my starbucks by 7 15 
excuse me 
mind if we join you 
no 
hey  how are you 
can t explain it  but it makes
me feel part of something 
these guys today 
they re not numbers guys 
don t talk figures
with them 
how do i spend
the rest of my days 
you name it 
golf  books  movies  pinochle 
tried yoga  learned to cook 
bought some plants 
took classes in mandarin 
xiang xin wo 
wo shen me dou shiguo le 
translation     believe me 
i ve tried everything  
and then  of course 
there are the funerals 
so many more
than i could imagine 
the only traveling i do
these days
is out to san diego
to visit my son and his family 
they re great 
i love them to pieces 
but to be honest  i think
i probably relied on them
way more than i should 
don t get me wrong 
i m not an unhappy person 
quite the contrary 
i just know there s a hole in
my life  and i need to fill it 
soon 
which brings me to today
when i was leaving the market
and caught your flyer
out of the corner of my eye 
hmm 
 seniors  be an intern  
ben 
i thought that was you 
hi 
hey 
what d you find 
i think an internet place
is looking for senior interns 
am i reading this right 
let me see 
 applicants must be
over 65 years of age   
have organizational skills  a
genuine interest in e commerce  
whatever that is   
    and a roll up your sleeves
attitude  
aboutthefit  com  isn t that
the outfit that was   
yeah  yeah  yeah 
they bought one of those
old factories in red hook 
my daughter says they
sell clothes on the internet 
how that works 
i have no idea 
well  you have to
upload the application 
that could be challenging 
listen to this   
 cover letters
are so old fashioned 
show us who you are
with a cover letter video 
upload your video
to youtube or vimeo using
 mov   avi 
or a  mpg file 
we look forward to
meeting you  
well 
i guess that s meeting me 
i swear i don t even know
what language that was 
what are you doing tonight 
ben 
a frozen lasagna 
well   
i could make a little salad 
turn it into a dinner for two 
like we did that time
and never did again 
you know that was
over five months ago 
oh  yeah  no  no  we got to
do that again  for sure 
but okay
if we take a rain check 
you re awful cute 
you know that 
no  i didn t 
well  it s true  you are 
so i ll see you 
don t take too long 
doll 
you re not
getting any younger 
i know  i know  i know 
all right 
so here i am  applying to be
one of your interns
because the more
i think about this idea 
the more tremendous
i think it is 
i love the idea of having
a place i can go every day 
i want the connection 
the excitement 
i want to be challenged 
and i guess i might even
want to be needed 
the tech stuff might
take a bit to figure out 
i had to call
my 9 year old grandson
just to find out
what a usb connector was 
but i ll get there 
eager to learn 
also  i want you to know i ve
been a company man all my life 
i m loyal  i m trustworthy 
and i m good in a crisis 
and i love that
you re right here in brooklyn 
i ve lived here all my life 
and lately i feel
i may not be hip enough
to live in brooklyn 
so this could help with that 
too 
i read once 
musicians don t retire 
they stop when
there s no more music in them 
well  i still have music in me 
absolutely positive about that 
  this is a world premiere  
  this is a world premiere  
  this is a world premiere  
  as i look around me  
  so many  many
want to down me  
  but ain t no   
never drown me  
  in front of a dirty
double mirror they found me  
  and i love myself  
  the world is a ghetto
with guns and picket signs  
  i love myself  
  but they can do what they want
whenever they want  
  i don t mind  
  i love myself  
  he said i got to get up  
  life is more than suicide  
  i love myself  
  one day at a time

of the silk chiffon

 talent acquisition  
  i m all about that bass  
   bout that bass  no treble  
  i m all about that bass 
 bout that bass  
okay 
you guys have to remember 
the homepage
has to read in a glance 
right 
also  you have to get back like this
if you want to see what looks
like if you re  like  over 35 
okay 
so i can t read anything 
but if i could 
what do you want me to see 
 five girls  one shirt 
or  check out the fit  
well  both  but
what i really want you to see
is the shirt worn by
five different body types 
okay  then
you got to make me see that 
try making the photo grid
bigger 
i love that five 
can we make it more graphic 
yeah  that s cool 
maybe hero
the girl in the red shirt 
jules

it is going to
fly out of here 
i needed you to sign off
on this  like  two hours ago 
i know  i know 
but can you try 
yep 
mia 
tell me that thing again 
oh  40  of our visitors
don t go past the homepage 
which isn t so bad 
yeah 
but we should fix that 
okay  here you go 
i love it 
great  and it s up 
okay 
thanks  everybody 
thanks 
thank you 
let s go over
the pitch for friday 
okay  so   
the antoinette dress 
major screw up
by the vendor 
there s gonna be a couple of
interviews today  ben 
we want to make sure that
we both find the right fit 
business as usual
is not really our motto 
so we hope
you have some fun here 
this is the first time we re
hiring senior interns 
so some of
our intern questions
may not exactly fit
your profile 
but we re gonna go for it
anyway  okay 
fire away 
okay  good 
where d you go to school 
i went to northwestern 
hey  my brother
went to northwestern 
probably not
at the same time 
probably not 
he graduated in 2009 
class of  65 
wow 
what was your major 
do you remember 
and after northwestern
you went on to    
i went to work
for dex one 
okay  and they made    
phonebooks 
i was in charge of
overseeing
the printing
of the physical phonebook 
i did that for over 20 years 
and before that 
i was their
v p  of sales and advertising 
so  do they still
make phonebooks 
i mean  doesn t everyone
just google numbers 
i believe they do  but before google
that was how you got a number 
oh  no  no 
yeah  i    i get it 
so 40 years
at the phonebook company 
that is amazing 
seriously 
okay  benjamin 
now  i m gonna ask you one of
our more telling questions
for all of our interns 
so i want you to  like 
this is the one
to really think about  okay 
and   
and take your time 
where do you see yourself
in 10 years 
when i m 80 
yeah  sure 
yeah  whatever 
um   
wait 
did not realize you were 70 
that s  uh    that question just
doesn t work for you  does it 
should we just scratch that one
and just move on 
it s your call  justin 
okay  that one s gone 
you look great  by the way 
so great 
and you re clearly more than
qualified for this job 
you re actually  like 
way overqualified 
and we were so impressed 
you had great interviews 
great video 
you nailed it  ben 
congrats 
you re an intern 
hey 
hi 
i need you for two minutes 
uninterrupted 
okay 
remember a few weeks ago 
we talked about
the senior intern program 
no 
really  we had a   
we had a whole  big conversation
about it 
we did 
okay  remind me 
seniors in high school
or college 
no  no  no  no 
seniors in life 
older people 
hold on  what 
i told you i felt like we needed
to do an outreach program 
you definitely seemed to be
liking the idea 
so i set it in motion 
it s gonna be great 
hold  please 
you re hiring
senior citizen interns 
there s been
a ton of research on this 
and the results
are actually incredible 
i mean  imagine having an intern
with a lifetime of experience 
as opposed to
somebody who spent
the last four years of their
life playing beer pong 
do they eventually
want jobs here 
no  darling 
they re all retired 
they    they just want
the experience 
and i would like one
to work directly with you 
wait  cameron  no 
first of all 
i m not great with older people 
you know how i am
with my parents 
this could be   
why do i
have to have one 
because you have to
set the tone 
now  would you prefer
a man or a woman 
there s a great
72 year old woman  really cute 
that s like the same age
as my mom 
that s too weird 
that s fine 
there s a man everyone loves 
he seems amazing 
i watched his video
with the whole group 
people were crying 
okay  this is not going to work 
in my opinion 
but how long
do i have to do this for 
minimum 
six weeks or we ll be sued 
i know we never
talked about this 
yeah  we did 
for real 
he starts tomorrow 
mm 
back in action 
thank god 
new interns  welcome to atf 
we all work on this one floor 
and that is because
we are all about
communication and teamwork 
no one
has a private office 
not even our founder and ceo 
jules ostin 
who is actually
right over there 
she loves to ride her bike
through the office 
that woman does not
like to waste time 
plus 
she counts it as exercise 
that s adorable 
yeah 
mm hmm 
hey  how you doing 
i m davis 
hi  davis 
ben whittaker 
exciting place  huh 
oh  my god 
they had one opening for a
regular age intern  no offense 
i got it 
i m so psyched 
i m pretty psyched
myself 
all right 
a few words about jules 
she started about the fit
only 18 months ago 
this whole idea was hatched
at jules  kitchen table
right here in brooklyn 
jules tried everything on
that she sold 
described the fit herself 
and apparently it worked 
she was online
in four months 
she started with 25 employees 
she s now up to 216 
with you 4  220 
wow 
hey  ben  are you gonna
wear a suit every day 
you bet 
confident 
i like how you roll 
i like it a lot 
we just hit a record high
of 2 500 likes on instagram 
yeah 
and that s what we do
when something good
happens around here 
new interns  grab a seat
at one of the intern tables
over there 
check your e mail  you may find
that you ve been assigned
to one particular person
or one particular team 
or you might just be
a floater 
it s all good 
okay 
let me instagram this 
moment in time 
gray is the new green 
take a seat 
thanks 
got one 
 welcome ben 
your internship will be
directly with our founder 
jules ostin  
oh 
i m in the photo studio 
floater 
love 
hey  ben 
what d you get 
looks like i m gonna be
a personal intern 
nice  to 
jules ostin 
unfortunate 
hang in there 
 hi ben 
i have secured an appointment
for you to meet with
jules ostin today at 3 55 p m 
please be prompt as jules has
another meeting at 4 00 p m  
hmm 
all right 
i m going to merchandising 
beautiful 
it s perfect 
yes  i ll try to
have her there at 5 00 
um  no  wait 
i booked her with a vendor
at 5 15 
i m sorry 
i ll call you back 
yes  hello 
hi 
i m ben whittaker 
i have a 3 55 appointment
with ms  ostin 
3 55 
i thought she was meeting with
her new intern 
that s me 
how you doing 
i m sorry  uh 
how are you an intern 
w    it s the new
senior intern program 
it just started today 
oh  my god 
um   
how old are you 
70  you 
i m 24 
i know  i look older 
it s the job 
it ages you 
which won t be great
in your case 
sorry 
i actually thought
you looked younger 
yeah  right 
any tips
before i go in 
just talk fast 
she hates slow talkers 
maybe that s just
when i talk slow 
don t dawdle in any way 
just keep it moving 
and don t forget
to blink 
blink 
yeah 
she hates when people don t
blink  it weirds her out 
but it s 3 57 
this meeting that she s in
just took up like two of your
f    they re out  go  go  go 
okay  thanks 
go  yeah 
what 
oh  yeah  i m here 
hi  jules 
i m ben 
your new intern 
i m glad you also
see the humor in this 
be hard not to 
so  ben   
i was gonna say
what is a nice guy like you
doing at
a place like this 
but cameron
gave me the drill 
so can i just
be honest with you 
please 
i m not gonna have
a lot for you to do 
that s the truth 
and you being assigned to me
is kind of just
for me to set an example
for the rest of the team 
if you ask me  i think
that you d be much better off
working in creative
or marketing 
it s a little bit
slower pace 
maybe a little bit
easier to grasp 
if you requested to transfer 
we can make that happen 
if that s
what you d prefer 
you ll be happier  believe me 
i am not so fun to work for 
that s what i gather 
but i can get along with anyone 
and i m here to
learn about your world 
give help where i can 
so   
so 
you don t want to transfer 
not really  sir 
i m terribly sorry 
excuse me 
okay 
well  then  looks like
you re stuck with me 
great  i m excited 
i will e mail you when
i have something for you to do 
or i could just stop by
a few times a day  check in    
i ll e mail you 
also  don t feel like
you have to dress up 
i mean 
we re super cas here 
well  i m comfortable in a suit 
if it s okay 
no  it s fine 
old school 
exactly 
at least
i ll stand out 
i don t think you need a suit
to do that 
true 
well  i think we did it
in less than two minutes 
i ll wait to
hear from you 
okay 
want the door
open or closed 
doesn t matter 
open  actually 
you ll get used to me 
look forward to it 
hi

hi 
okay  so they want to know
what customers bought
who didn t come back
so they can spot a problem
if there is one  right 
yeah  but
i don t understand how to   
all right  well  here s
what i think we should do 
ben 
we should go   
ben  hey  look 
here she comes 
watch how
she won t even   
hey  beck 
what s up 
you look
really nice to   
how long can a woman
be mad at you for 
well  it kind of
depends on what you did 
well  first of all 
nothing on purpose 
we were going out
for a minute 
i thought she was cool 
i really liked her 
but then i sort of
accidentally   
slept with her roommate 
that doesn t help 
i didn t know
she was her roommate 
i met her out 
how would i know that 
hey  nikki 
ben  tell me 
i don t know this stuff 
you re older 
you ve been through
a lot 
i mean  you    i mean 
you have a lot of experience 
how long do you think
she ll be mad at me for 
jay  i have zero experience
with women 
and i can tell you  there s
no coming back from that one 
i mean  i assume
you talked to her  apologized 
told her
how much she means to you 
well  you know   
you didn t talk to her 
what did you do 
send her a tweet 
no  of course not 
i  like  texted her
a billion times 
she didn t answer 
so then i e mailed her 
but it was like 
a nice e mail 
it was a long one 
well thought out 
subject line i wrote 
 i m sooorry  
with like a ton of o s 
so it was like 
 i m sooorry  
with a sad emoticon
where he s crying
at the side of
its little cheek 
i should probably actually
just talk to her  huh 
obviously 
can t imagine
it would hurt 
oh  did yesterday s numbers
come in 
yeah 
we could do it that way 
too 
i noticed my intern
sure keeps busy 
mr  congeniality 
he s a very big hit 
everybody loves him 
okay 
do not look at that desk 
it s like
the office junk drawer 
it s just gonna
drive you crazy 
you just did that 
what  are you
preparing for surgery 
okay  seriously 
like 
how did this even happen 
no  no  i i can set it up 
she s just in a meeting 
hi 
something i can help you with 
yes  jules spilled soy sauce
on her saint laurent jacket 
can you take it
to the photo studio 
there s lots of cleaners
and stuff in there 
sure 
where is it 
she s wearing it 
they would like us
to consider the possibility   
okay 
   of  uh  meeting with
some  uh  potential ceos 
wow 
i did not
see that coming 
w why  uh   
am i too inexperienced
at running a business 
i i didn t go to harvard 
my    my methods
aren t by the book 
i mean 
isn t that how we got here 
really 
i need adult supervision 
could we be doing better 
we hit our five year goal
in nine months 
exactly 
jules  we can t keep up
with our own success 
you know that 
you re an hour late
to every meeting 
we have a name for it   
jules standard time 
and look  i get it  there s only
so many hours in the day 
we re all playing catchup 
our tech guys work until
2 00  3 00 in the morning 
customer service
is slammed 
we re running out of
inventory 
we ve got shipping issues
and programming problems 
and    and the bigger we get 
the more complicated
it s gonna get 
but isn t this
what a startup is 
what 
say it  what is everyone
so worried about 
that it s all going too fast 
and it could get away from us 
our investors just think
that a seasoned ceo
could take some things
off your plate 
that s all  just free you up
to do what you do great 
you come up with the ideas 
and let somebody else
make the trains run on time 
but  cameron 
this new person 
they are going to
want to do things their way 
technically
be my boss 
i mean 
how can i do what i do
if i have to
report to someone else 
run every idea i have
by this person 
can you
see that working 
well 
gilt groupe brought in a ceo 
how are they doing 
i mean  get me ceo lessons 
you know 
uh  excuse me 
i apologize 
but becky said you needed
something taken care of
on your jacket 
oh  right 
thank you  ben

of potential ceos 
let s just take a look
at the list 
explore it 
then decide 
baby steps 
ben

going on in there 
i couldn t say 
you were in there
a long time 
i can t hear a thing 
psst

about me to her

on my way  boss

that s great 
i hear you typing 
that s better 
so  we ve been studying
women under 40
who sleep less than
six hours a night 
and what d you find out 
it s interesting 
it seems like
they re 38  more likely
to experience major weight gain
compared to women who slept
seven hours a night 
are you kidding me 
you know i haven t slept
in two years 
well  i can t change
the facts  dear 
mom  you know what  i m rushing into the

the material on atwood 
yeah  i did 
uh  he had a great run at
travelocity and citigroup   
and i get it 
he s major 
he is 
and the best thing about him
is he s been watching us 
and he loves what we re doing 
but he s only one of the names
on the list 
so if you don t like him 
we move on 
but  jules 
try to be open 
he s supposed to
be brilliant

mark zuckerberg
never brought in a ceo

call me after

word travels fast 
pretty short meeting 
yeah  i hated him 
really  what happened 
i thought he was a condescending 
sexist know it all
who did not seem to get
what we do at all 
and  honestly  i think
he would run our business
in a completely inorganic way
that would lose us
all the customers
we have killed ourselves to get 
oh  and i think
that he would replace us
as soon as
he got the chance 
oh  and   
the man never blinked 
an olympian non blinker 
okay  then 
yeah 
see you in the a m  
be there or be square

oh  i m asking you 
okay  okay 
benjamin   
we made some progress 
very big day
for the intern team 
it was great 
i mean  she yelled at me 
but   
she yells at me
all the time  too 
right 
it was communication 
yeah 
it was a breakthrough 
yeah 
whoo 
oh  you want one too 
yeah 
okay 
okay  boys  i m possibly
meeting jay z and or beyoncé 
and i m in a blouse

have to keep doing that 
oh  force of habit 
here you go 
swiped these
from the tech fridge

sure  thanks 
cheers 
cheers 
i noticed
a couple hours ago 
you had a meeting
with another possible ceo 
i saw him arrive 
how d that go 
it was going well   
until he called us   
i believe the term he used
was a  chick site  
and i didn t hear
anything he said after that 
apparently  selling clothes
makes us a  chick site  
i mean  really 
how is this not legit 
i couldn t agree more 
i find that surprising 
really 
sexism in business 
so   
what did you do for work  ben 
before you retired 
i was a v p 
for dex one 
phonebooks 
yeah 
i was in charge of printing 
and before that i ran
sales and advertising 
big jobs 
wasn t this a factory
that used to make phonebooks 
no  what 
yeah 
what 
this is
where you worked 
for almost 40 years 
yeah 
for twenty some years
i sat right by that window 
that was my office 
it was
a few steps up back then 
we d look out
over the whole factory 
our printing presses
were in that corner 
that s why the floor dips
back there 
no way 
i know everything
about this building 
or used to 
you know the sycamores on
the other side of the building 
yeah 
the big ones 
yeah  the big ones 
i love them 
yeah  i remember
the day they were planted 
is it totally weird
being back here 
well 
it feels like home 
it s    remodeled  but   
home 
so you re on facebook 
huh 
well  i ve been trying to
figure it out 
i joined
about 10 minutes ago 
well  better late than never 
you want some help 
i d love some  but  really 
you ve got better things to do 
no 
i need a diversion 
you have a photo of yourself 
no  i need one 
if you want to look up
all those hotties
from high school  you do 
say cheese 
cheese 
that s cute 
okay 
i just need to send that to you 
uh  all right 
so there are all these questions
for your profile
that you can answer
if you want to or not 
like religious views 
political views   
people who inspire you   
jules ostin 
i m not trying to
brownnose you 
but i ve been in business
a long time 
and i ve never run across
anyone quite like you 
you do inspire  jules 
i just knew 
at the end of the day 
that a woman
with a glass of wine
and a laptop
had real shopping potential 
and if you could actually
promise her things would fit   
see 
that s what i mean 
okay 
mm 
you have a favorite quote 
i do 
 you re never wrong
to do the right thing  
who said that  you 
yeah 
but i m pretty sure
mark twain said it first 
okay

i graduated from penn 
i have a business degree 
but i never seem to do
anything right around here 
and you re like 50 years older
than me and you re deaf 
i happen to think you do
a lot of things right 
you do so much 
i know 
i know that 
mm hmm 
but she doesn t 
i mean  i bust my ass for her
14 hours a day 
and she never notices 
oh  oh  my god 
i hate
girls who cry at work 
how  bout if you 
just as an experiment 
try letting me help you 
a lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted
once you re out from under
this mountain of worry 
and maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour
once in a while 
see your friends 
have a little fun 
mm hmm  i can offer
my assistance in this area 
i would love to 
actually 
i just don t want her to think
that i can t do my job
and i need an intern
to help me 
okay  you re not gonna
want to hear this 
but i heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night
gain 38  more weight
than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night 
what  
i leave here at 11 00 
i get back at 7 00 
i sleep like five hours a night 
and now i m gonna get fat 
let s get through this stuff 
let s do it together 
let s clean slate it 
let s just do it 
yes 
very nice  st  louis 
ah  suede jacket in d c 
i cannot believe how well
that sweater is doing 
i m so happy 
beautiful  miami  thank you 
oh  look at chicago 
she put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from houston 
okay  let s see
what she does at checkout 
she s not
buying them either 
okay  maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots 
mm hmm 
knock knock 
hey 
hi  i took a look
at the data purchase patterns 
uh  should i come back 
no  no  come on in 
that was fast 
well 
i enlisted becky s help 
it seems the most expensive
place you re advertising
is actually bringing you
the customers who are
spending the least 
and the channels
you re least investing in
are adding enormous value
in segments that currently
appear to have low value
but actually have
the highest spending potential 
that s what i could tell
so far 
oh  ben  can you  like 
deal with that for me 
maybe come up with
a better plan 
i mean 
if you have the time 
happy to 
the man spent 40 years
in business 
yeah  no  i get it 
and  jules  becky
was a huge help in this 
you know she has
a business degree from penn 
i know 
i mean  i forgot 
but i know 
i ll say something
to her 
that would be very nice 
hey  how s it goin  up here
in first class 
busy  i see
you found an apartment 
no 
my two weeks are up 
i m movin  in
with my cousin 
excellent 
in philadelphia 
davis

pocket squares  handkerchiefs 
okay  what s the deal
with the handkerchief 
that one
i just don t get at all 
okay  it s essential 
that your generation
doesn t know that is criminal 
the best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it 
ask jason about this 
women cry  davis 
we carry it for them 
one of the last vestiges
of the chivalrous gent 
oh  well  then

to san francisco 
if you want the company 
i d love to go 
really 
definitely 
guess what  ben 
yes 
today 
my dad s gonna be ariel 
it s his turn 
oh  that s good  right 
really good 
you guys think
finding a ceo is a big deal 
here  the big negotiation
is who gets to be ariel
when we re playing
 little mermaid  
and for the record 
it s never been my turn 
mnh mnh 
so this is huge for me 
i m excited 
i get to comb my hair with a fork   
   play with gadgets and gizmos aplenty 
daddy 
this is jules 
so  guys  how long
till we get it fixed 
i mean  if you can t zoom in 
you probably won t buy 
yeah  the first couple
hours are already down 23  
oh  boy 
okay 
i will be there in like   
two minutes 
   two minutes 
we re on it 
ben  do you have the info
on friends shopping together 
yeah 
thank you 
this is jules 
what s wrong 
oh  mom  hi 
um  i just found out
that the zoom link   
um  the button that you click on
to zoom in on a photo 
isn t working 
that doesn t sound like such a big deal 
well  actually  it is 
um   
it s what people use to get
a closer look at what   
everybody zooms in 
i guess i don t go to your
website enough to know that 
oh  typing and ringing 
yeah  sorry 
oh  it s the warehouse 
mom  i m sorry 
can i call you back 
no need 
okay  love you 
yep 
who says  yep 
to  i love you  
hi  alonzo 
hi  jules 
not good news 
what  okay 
lay it on me 
in a routine check
by the sanitation department 
they found one bedbug 
no 
unfortunately  yes 
we sent out 4 800 boxes
yesterday 
we have to get them all back 
shut down the warehouse   
ugh 
   spray for bedbugs 
then we can start shipping
again 
nightmare 
nightmare 
okay  here we are 
okay 
let me just finish this e mail 
no 
no 
no  no  no 
hey  guys 
thanks for coming 
i know the zoom is broken 
and i don t mean to
pull anyone off of that 
but i need a favor 
i accidentally sent an e mail
to the wrong person 
and she s at work
right now 
and i know she doesn t check
her personal e mail
until she gets home
at 5 30 
so i have until then
to figure out how to delete it 
because if this person sees
this e mail  it ll be horrible 
and on top of that 
she has a minor heart condition 
i think this could
possibly be not good for that 
so i am counting on
your good graces and brilliance
to figure out
a way to save my ass 
truthfully  jules 
it s pretty impossible
to hack into a server 
techie  2  and you don t
know her password 
no idea 
jules  i think there s only
one thing we can do 
what  tell me 
i m dying 
me and the boys take off 
we break into your mom s house 
and we steal her computer 
break into her house
and steal the computer 
are you kidding me 
that s freaking genius 
you will reach your destination
in 300 yards 
little does gps lady know
she is an accomplice to a crime 
the woman has a heart condition 
think of it as a good deed 
i never thought you d be a bad
influence on me  whittaker 
oh  relax  fellas  this is
gonna be a piece of cake 
the key
is under a flowerpot 
we go in  we delete 
we disappear 
she doesn t have an alarm 
right 
nope 
she does not 
what if there s  like 
a password on the e mail  hmm 
then
we take the computer 
jules said she d buy her
a new one  so it s a win win 
you will reach your destination
in 100 yards 
this is like
an  oceans  movie 
ben s the old guy
with the big glasses 
his name is elliott gould 
yeah  and  jason  you re clooney

generation of  you go  girl  
we had oprah

trying to figure it out 
they re still dressing
like little boys 
they re still playing
video games 
well  they ve gotten great 
so   
i love video games 
oh  boy 
how  in one generation 
have men gone from
guys like jack nicholson
and harrison ford to   
take ben  here 
a dying breed 
you know 
look and learn  boys

my boss  kind of 
i mean a lot of people

most people have bosses 
jules  it s simple 
if you think townsend
is gonna be good for you
and good for the company 
then do it 
and if not   
exactly 
just because
i came all way here

doesn t mean anything 
i agree

it s a thing i do before i land 
we re good now 
jules 
yeah 
you hear that 
uh huh  i hear it  i m up 
are you okay 
this alarm going off
is not a good omen
about this guy 
it s a sign  ben 
oh  i m pretty sure it s not 
so you haven t
taken a xanax  yet 
you told me
to wait a few hours 
you travel
with your own robe 
yeah 
ladies and gentlemen 
a smoke alarm went off
in one of the rooms 
but the problem
has been taken care of 
our sincerest apologies 
oh  yeah 
100 people  2 elevators 
definitely a sign 
well 
thanks for escorting me back 
mm hmm 
you want to see my room 
oh  nice 
i mean 
do you actually want to come in 
i have a tea kettle 
we could have tea or   
i m ridiculously nervous
about tomorrow 
you can lie down 
i know you re tired 
i ll sit in the chair 
here you go 
i thought you were gonna
sit in a chair 
please let me be here 
i need to lie down  too 
we don t have to talk about work
or anything 
all right 
what should we talk about 
marriage 
will you tell me
about your wife 
she was great  right 
she was 
molly was her name 
she was
a middle school principal 
beloved 
so perfect 
long marriage 
not long enough 
42 years 
wow 
what was that like 
you know when people say
they want to grow old together 
mm hmm 
well  we did that 
we met when we were 20 
well  i was 20 
she was 19 
and what was amazing
is she never really changed 
that s a hard thing
to pull off 
she handled life
like it was easy 
always 
even when it wasn t 
god  i envy that 
are you hungry 
we have  um   
gummy bears  chocolate chips 
pringles 
yup 
i m just gonna bring
the whole thing 
you know those are
like 15 bucks each 
benjamin  i run a very big
internet company 
let s go crazy 
okay 
so   
so   
yeah  so   
i got a weird one
for you 
matt is cheating on me 
wait a minute 
you know about this 
what does that mean 
wait 
you know about this 
i saw them together 
oh  my god  when 
yesterday 
i m    i m sorry 
i mean  it was an accident
that i saw them  but i did 
yesterday 
then it is
still going on 
how long have you known 
for like 18 days 
she s a mom
at paige s school 
it s still so hard
for me to grasp 
i i was in the kitchen
making sandwiches 
and his phone was there 
he was upstairs
with paige 
and h he was getting
all these text messages 
and i don t know why 
but i read them 
it was not good 
does he know you know 
no 
 cause  honestly  i m   
i m not ready   
to deal with it 
i would like to be
a little less devastated 
if that is possible 
it s classic  though 
isn t it 
the successful wife 
the husband feels like
his manhood is threatened 
so he acts out 
girlfriend  i guess 
makes him feel more like a man 
sometimes i m not sure
i know how to do that 
hold on  hold on  hold on 
wait a minute  wait a minute 
you re not actually taking the
rap for any of this  are you 
no  no  no 
he is the one
doing something wrong 
i get that 
monogam ish
is not what i m after 
i i m just   
i m taking a sec   
and i m hoping that it s just
a horrible lapse in judgment
and not  like  love 
and once
he moves through this 
we will eventually
be able to be okay again 
what do you think
about that 
clearly you don t think
that s a possible thing 
it    it would be unusual 
i get that 
i get not everybody
could do that  but   
everybody s not us 
i have faith in us
because   
i believe
he still loves me 
and  you know  we ve been
going through so much that   
god  i wish your expressions
weren t so transparent 
some couples do survive
these things  you know 
i googled it     staying
together after the affair  
and a lot of couples 
i mean  a lot stay together 
and anyway 
there is something to be said
about moving through it
and focusing on us
and not on the affair 
i don t want to
give up on him 
i know him 
and i know he knows better 
but i am only human 
and i am so mad at him 
you know  so much
has happened to us so fast 
i think   
part of me
was even expecting this 
like  you know  he was
the more successful one
when we started out 
no  i didn t know that 
yeah  he was 
he was a rising star 
and he bowed out
so that i could do this 
he was amazing 
it was all his idea 
i m sure that s why
i m even considering
this whole ceo thing 
thinking maybe
someone else coming in
will help me
get my life back on track 
okay  that   
that s it 
i hate to be the feminist here 
between the two of us 
but you should be able to have
a huge career and be who you are
without having to accept that
your husband is having an affair
as some kind of payback 
right on 
i mean it 
me  too 
but such is life 
my friend 
no  it isn t 
not always 
and i m not so sure
i d be so forgiving 
i am not so forgiving 
i m saying that i could
potentially be forgiving 
but don t think that i
don t feel what s going on here 
it s crushing 
and when i think of paige   
oh  don t 
also  if we got divorced 
he d remarry 
maybe not to this girl 
but someone 
and we both know i m not easy 
so i could be  like  single
forever  which means that   
forgive me  but this does
keep me up
in the middle of the night 
oh 
what 
that i don t want to
be buried alone 
paige ll be
with her husband 
and matt ll be
with his new family 
and i will be
buried with strangers 
i will buried in the strangers
singles section of the cemetery 
not that that is a reason
to stay together 
but it s just  you know 
a scary sidebar 
let s take that one
off your plate right now 
you can be buried with
me and molly 
i happen to have space 
okay 
oh 
thank you so much 
that is   
and to think
i didn t even want to hire you 
the one time
i don t have my hanky 
you want to   
watch tv 
just for
a few minutes 
yeah  sure  i would 
even though
the planned merger has   
     were meant for me  
  and i was meant
for you  
  nature patterned you  
  and when she was done  
  you were
all the sweet things  
  rolled up in one  
  you re like  
  a plaintive melody  
  that never lets me free  
  but i m content  
  the angels
must have sent you  
  and they meant you  
  just for me  
airport  please 
so  did we like him 
he said
all the right things 
he said that no one knows
about the fit like me 
that he doesn t want to remove
the soul of the company 
he said that
he doesn t have a plan 
he wants to watch us
and see what works 
he was polite and respectful
and super smart 
and i hired him 
seriously 
yeah 
you did it
right in the room 
he told me to sleep on it
and that we d talk tomorrow 
but i said
the job was his 
we shook hands on it 
you know if  uh  we disagree 
he s the tiebreaker 
of course 
he s the ceo 
yeah  duh 
hi 
hey 
you smell minty 
i just made mint tea 
so   
yes  no 
i did it 
i liked him 
a lot 
and  uh   
i offered him the job 
wow  really 
yeah 
and you re okay
with it 
yeah 
i think
it ll be good for us 
do we have any  like  real
booze  like vodka or something 
yeah 
did  good for us 
mean   
about the fit   
or us 
you and me us 
i figure if someone else can
call some of the shots at work 
then maybe   
we can get back to
where we were 18 months ago 
they say you can t put the genie
back in the bottle 
but we can try  right 
hey 
hi 
wait  you live here 
yeah  ben s been putting me up
until i can find a place 
oh  should i let him know
that you re here 
that s okay 
i ll ring 
okay 
fiona  
jules 
come on in 
i m just on my way
to work 
ben s right in here 
i ll let you two talk 
see you 
mm hmm 
hi 
wow 
you and fiona  huh 
who knew 
she s a great gal 
she surprised me last night 
she brought over dinner 
it s brand new 
congratulations 
i love her 
yeah 
so  i was ready kind of early
this morning  since about 4 00 
and matt and paige left an hour
ago for a field trip
so i thought i d come by 
i hope that s okay 
yeah 
i just wanted to say   
i slept on it 
i haven t called townsend
yet  but   
i still feel like
it s the right thing to do 
well   
i didn t
sleep so well myself 
over this 
you remember the day
i drove you to the warehouse 
you were giving me the
wrong directions and all that 
yeah  i remember 
okay  well  i stood in the back 
and i watched you
show the workers
how to fold
and box the clothes 
i knew then
that was why atf was a success 
no one else
is ever gonna have
that kind of commitment
to your company  jules 
to me  it s pretty simple 
about the fit needs you 
and if you don t mind me saying 
you need it 
someone may come in
with more experience than you 
but they re never gonna know
what you know 
i never had anything like this
in my life 
not many people do 
this big  beautiful 
exciting thing that you created 
it s a dream 
isn t it 
and you re gonna
give that up
in the hopes that your husband
will stop having an affair 
i don t see
how that adds up 
you should feel nothing but
great about what you ve done 
and i d hate to see you let
anyone take that away from you 
i guess
you came over here
because you wanted to hear
some of this 
yes 
and maybe also
because you re my   
intern 
well  i was gonna say
intern best friend 
but there s no need to get
all sentimental about it
even though we could potentially
be buried together 
can t get closer
than that 
it s moments like this
when you need
someone you know
you can count on 
so thank you 
i like your house
so much by the way 
thanks 
so 
shall we 
okay 
welcome back 
you two 
jules  i have something cool
to show you

a customer service call
about a bride whose bridesmaids 
dresses showed up in gray 
and we had the vendor
remake them overnight
and put them on a plane

much better if you ll let me
