thats all there is
well im retired
and my wife is dead
as you can imagine thats
given me some time on my hands
my wifes been gone
for three and a half years
i miss her in every way
and retirement
that is an ongoing
relentless effort in creativity
at first i admit
i enjoyed the novelty of it
sort of felt like
i was playing hooky
i used all the miles id saved
and traveled the globe
the problem was no matter where
i went as soon as i got home
the nowheretobe thing
hit me like a ton of bricks
i realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving
get up get out of the house
and go somewhere
anywhere
come rain or shine
im at my starbucks by 715
excuse me
mind if we join you
no
hey how are you
cant explain it but it makes
me feel part of something
these guys today
theyre not numbers guys
dont talk figures
with them
how do i spend
the rest of my days
you name it
golf books movies pinochle
tried yoga learned to cook
bought some plants
took classes in mandarin
xiang xin wo
wo shen me dou shiguo le
translation believe me
ive tried everything
and then of course
there are the funerals
so many more
than i could imagine
the only traveling i do
these days
is out to san diego
to visit my son and his family
theyre great
i love them to pieces
but to be honest i think
i probably relied on them
way more than i should
dont get me wrong
im not an unhappy person
quite the contrary
i just know theres a hole in
my life and i need to fill it
soon
which brings me to today
when i was leaving the market
and caught your flyer
out of the corner of my eye
hmm
seniors be an intern
ben
i thought that was you
hi
hey
whatd you find
i think an internet place
is looking for senior interns
am i reading this right
let me see
applicants must be
over 65 years of age
have organizational skills a
genuine interest in ecommerce
whatever that is
and a rollupyoursleeves
attitude
aboutthefit com isnt that
the outfit that was
yeah yeah yeah
they bought one of those
old factories in red hook
my daughter says they
sell clothes on the internet
how that works
i have no idea
well you have to
upload the application
that could be challenging
listen to this
cover letters
are so oldfashioned
show us who you are
with a coverletter video
upload your video
to youtube or vimeo using
mov avi
or a mpg file
we look forward to
meeting you
well
i guess thats meeting me
i swear i dont even know
what language that was
what are you doing tonight
ben
a frozen lasagna
well
i could make a little salad
turn it into a dinner for two
like we did that time
and never did again
you know that was
over five months ago
oh yeah no no we got to
do that again for sure
but okay
if we take a rain check
youre awful cute
you know that
no i didnt
well its true you are
so ill see you
dont take too long
doll
youre not
getting any younger
i know i know i know
all right
so here i am applying to be
one of your interns
because the more
i think about this idea
the more tremendous
i think it is
i love the idea of having
a place i can go every day
i want the connection
the excitement
i want to be challenged
and i guess i might even
want to be needed
the tech stuff might
take a bit to figure out
i had to call
my 9yearold grandson
just to find out
what a usb connector was
but ill get there
eager to learn
also i want you to know ive
been a company man all my life
im loyal im trustworthy
and im good in a crisis
and i love that
youre right here in brooklyn
ive lived here all my life
and lately i feel
i may not be hip enough
to live in brooklyn
so this could help with that
too
i read once
musicians dont retire
they stop when
theres no more music in them
well i still have music in me
absolutely positive about that
this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere
as i look around me
so many many
want to down me
but aint no
never drown me
in front of a dirty
doublemirror they found me
and i love myself
the world is a ghetto
with guns and picket signs
i love myself
but they can do what they want
whenever they want
i dont mind
i love myself
he said i got to get up
life is more than suicide
i love myself
one day at a time

you guys have to remember
the homepage
has to read in a glance
right
also you have to get back like this
if you want to see what looks
like if youre like over 35
okay
so i cant read anything
but if i could
what do you want me to see
five girls one shirt
or check out the fit
well both but
what i really want you to see
is the shirt worn by
five different body types
okay then
you got to make me see that
try making the photo grid
bigger
i love that five
can we make it more graphic
yeah thats cool
maybe hero
the girl in the red shirt
jules

it is going to
fly out of here
i needed you to sign off

yeah
but we should fix that
okay here you go
i love it
great and its up
okay
thanks everybody
thanks
thank you
lets go over
the pitch for friday
okay so
the antoinette dress
major screwup
by the vendor
theres gonna be a couple of
interviews today ben
we want to make sure that
we both find the right fit
business as usual
is not really our motto
so we hope
you have some fun here
this is the first time were
hiring senior interns
so some of
our intern questions
may not exactly fit
your profile
but were gonna go for it
anyway okay
fire away
okay good
whered you go to school
i went to northwestern
hey my brother
went to northwestern
probably not
at the same time
probably not
he graduated in 2009
class of 65
wow
what was your major
do you remember
and after northwestern
you went on to
i went to work
for dex one
okay and they made
phonebooks
i was in charge of
overseeing
the printing
of the physical phonebook
i did that for over 20 years
and before that
i was their
vp of sales and advertising
so do they still
make phonebooks
i mean doesnt everyone
just google numbers
i believe they do but before google
that was how you got a number
oh no no
yeah i i get it
so 40 years
at the phonebook company
that is amazing
seriously
okay benjamin
now im gonna ask you one of
our more telling questions
for all of our interns
so i want you to like
this is the one
to really think about okay
and
and take your time
where do you see yourself
in 10 years
when im 80
yeah sure
yeah whatever
um
wait
did not realize you were 70
thats uh that question just
doesnt work for you does it
should we just scratch that one
and just move on
its your call justin
okay that ones gone
you look great by the way
so great
and youre clearly more than
qualified for this job
youre actually like
way overqualified
and we were so impressed
you had great interviews
great video
you nailed it ben
congrats
youre an intern
hey
hi
i need you for two minutes
uninterrupted
okay
remember a few weeks ago
we talked about
the senior intern program
no
really we had a
we had a whole big conversation
about it
we did
okay remind me
seniors in high school
or college
no no no no
seniors in life
older people
hold on what
i told you i felt like we needed
to do an outreach program
you definitely seemed to be
liking the idea
so i set it in motion
its gonna be great
hold please
youre hiring
senior citizen interns
theres been
a ton of research on this
and the results
are actually incredible
i mean imagine having an intern
with a lifetime of experience
as opposed to
somebody who spent
the last four years of their
life playing beer pong
do they eventually
want jobs here
no darling
theyre all retired
they they just want
the experience
and i would like one
to work directly with you
wait cameron no
first of all
im not great with older people
you know how i am
with my parents
this could be
why do i
have to have one
because you have to
set the tone
now would you prefer
a man or a woman
theres a great
72yearold woman really cute
thats like the same age
as my mom
thats too weird
thats fine
theres a man everyone loves
he seems amazing
i watched his video
with the whole group
people were crying
okay this is not going to work
in my opinion
but how long
do i have to do this for
minimum
six weeks or well be sued
i know we never
talked about this
yeah we did
for real
he starts tomorrow
mm
back in action
thank god
new interns welcome to atf
we all work on this one floor
and that is because
we are all about
communication and teamwork
no one
has a private office
not even our founder and ceo
jules ostin
who is actually
right over there
she loves to ride her bike
through the office
that woman does not
like to waste time
plus
she counts it as exercise
thats adorable
yeah
mmhmm
hey how you doing
im davis
hi davis
ben whittaker
exciting place huh
oh my god
they had one opening for a
regularage intern no offense
i got it
im so psyched
im pretty psyched
myself
all right
a few words about jules
she started about the fit
only 18 months ago
this whole idea was hatched
at jules kitchen table
right here in brooklyn
jules tried everything on
that she sold
described the fit herself
and apparently it worked
she was online
in four months
she started with 25 employees
shes now up to 216
with you 4 220
wow
hey ben are you gonna
wear a suit every day
you bet
confident
i like how you roll
i like it a lot
we just hit a record high
of 2500 likes on instagram
yeah
and thats what we do
when something good
happens around here
new interns grab a seat
at one of the intern tables
over there
check your email you may find
that youve been assigned
to one particular person
or one particular team
or you might just be
a floater
its all good
okay
let me instagram this
moment in time
gray is the new green
take a seat
thanks
got one
welcome ben
your internship will be
directly with our founder
jules ostin
oh
im in the photo studio
floater

a personal intern
nice to
jules ostin
unfortunate
hang in there

jules ostin today at 355 pm
please be prompt as jules has
another meeting at 400 pm
hmm

um no wait
i booked her with a vendor
at 515
im sorry
ill call you back
yes hello
hi
im ben whittaker
i have a 355 appointment
with ms ostin
i thought she was meeting with
her new intern
thats me
how you doing
im sorry uh
how are you an intern
w its the new
senior intern program
it just started today
oh my god
um
how old are you
70 you
im 24
i know i look older
its the job
it ages you
which wont be great
in your case
sorry
i actually thought
you looked younger
yeah right
any tips
before i go in
just talk fast
she hates slow talkers
maybe thats just
when i talk slow
dont dawdle in any way
just keep it moving
and dont forget
to blink
blink
yeah
she hates when people dont
blink it weirds her out
but its 357
this meeting that shes in
just took up like two of your
f theyre out go go go
okay thanks
go yeah
what
oh yeah im here
hi jules
im ben
your new intern
im glad you also
see the humor in this
be hard not to
so ben
i was gonna say
what is a nice guy like you
doing at
a place like this
but cameron
gave me the drill
so can i just
be honest with you
please
im not gonna have
a lot for you to do
thats the truth
and you being assigned to me
is kind of just
for me to set an example
for the rest of the team
if you ask me i think
that youd be much better off
working in creative
or marketing
its a little bit
slower pace
maybe a little bit
easier to grasp
if you requested to transfer
we can make that happen
if thats
what youd prefer
youll be happier believe me
i am not so fun to work for
thats what i gather
but i can get along with anyone
and im here to
learn about your world
give help where i can
so
so
you dont want to transfer
not really sir
im terribly sorry
excuse me
okay
well then looks like
youre stuck with me

were super cas here
well im comfortable in a suit
if its okay
no its fine
old school
exactly

to do that
true
well i think we did it
in less than two minutes
ill wait to
hear from you

hi

what customers bought
who didnt come back
so they can spot a problem
if there is one right
yeah but
i dont understand how to
all right well heres
what i think we should do
ben
we should go
ben hey look
here she comes
watch how
she wont even
hey beck
whats up
you look
really nice to
how long can a woman
be mad at you for
well it kind of
depends on what you did
well first of all
nothing on purpose
we were going out
for a minute
i thought she was cool
i really liked her
but then i sort of
accidentally
slept with her roommate
that doesnt help
i didnt know
she was her roommate
i met her out
how would i know that
hey nikki
ben tell me
i dont know this stuff
youre older
youve been through
a lot
i mean you i mean
you have a lot of experience
how long do you think
shell be mad at me for
jay i have zero experience
with women
and i can tell you theres
no coming back from that one
i mean i assume
you talked to her apologized
told her
how much she means to you
well you know
you didnt talk to her
what did you do
send her a tweet
no of course not
i like texted her
a billion times
she didnt answer
so then i emailed her
but it was like
a nice email
it was a long one
well thought out
subject line i wrote
im sooorry
with like a ton of os
so it was like
im sooorry
with a sad emoticon
where hes crying
at the side of
its little cheek
i should probably actually
just talk to her huh
obviously
cant imagine
it would hurt
oh did yesterdays numbers
come in
yeah
we could do it that way
too
i noticed my intern
sure keeps busy
mr congeniality
hes a very big hit
everybody loves him
okay
do not look at that desk
its like
the office junk drawer
its just gonna
drive you crazy
you just did that
what are you
preparing for surgery
okay seriously
like
how did this even happen
no no ii can set it up
shes just in a meeting
hi
something i can help you with
yes jules spilled soy sauce
on her saint laurent jacket
can you take it
to the photo studio
theres lots of cleaners
and stuff in there
sure
where is it
shes wearing it
they would like us
to consider the possibility
okay
of uh meeting with
some uh potential ceos
wow
i did not
see that coming
wwhy uh
am i too inexperienced
at running a business
ii didnt go to harvard
my my methods
arent by the book
i mean
isnt that how we got here
really
i need adult supervision
could we be doing better
we hit our fiveyear goal
in nine months
exactly
jules we cant keep up
with our own success
you know that
youre an hour late
to every meeting
we have a name for it
jules standard time
and look i get it theres only
so many hours in the day
were all playing catchup
our tech guys work until
200 300 in the morning
customer service
is slammed
were running out of
inventory
weve got shipping issues
and programming problems
and and the bigger we get
the more complicated
its gonna get
but isnt this
what a startup is
what
say it what is everyone
so worried about
that its all going too fast
and it could get away from us
our investors just think
that a seasoned ceo
could take some things
off your plate
thats all just free you up
to do what you do great
you come up with the ideas
and let somebody else
make the trains run on time
but cameron
this new person
they are going to
want to do things their way
technically
be my boss
i mean
how can i do what i do
if i have to
report to someone else
run every idea i have
by this person
can you
see that working
well
gilt groupe brought in a ceo
how are they doing
i mean get me ceo lessons
you know
uh excuse me
i apologize

something taken care of

well your dad and i
are finally putting together
all our research
at the hospital
thats great
i hear you typing
thats better
so weve been studying
women under 40
who sleep less than
six hours a night

it seems like
theyre 38 more likely
to experience major weight gain
compared to women who slept
seven hours a night
are you kidding me
you know i havent slept
in two years
well i cant change
the facts dear
mom you know what im rushing into the

hey how we doing
did you look over
the material on atwood
yeah i did
uh he had a great run at
travelocity and citigroup
and i get it
hes major
he is
and the best thing about him
is hes been watching us
and he loves what were doing
but hes only one of the names
on the list
so if you dont like him
we move on
but jules

to do

that smells so good
good
word travels fast
pretty short meeting
yeah i hated him
really what happened
i thought he was a condescending
sexist knowitall
who did not seem to get
what we do at all
and honestly i think
he would run our business
in a completely inorganic way
that would lose us
all the customers
we have killed ourselves to get
oh and i think
that he would replace us
as soon as
he got the chance
oh and
the man never blinked
an olympian nonblinker
okay then
yeah
see you in the am
be there or be square
im sorry
hey dont be

yourself a year and a half ago

a collar
these are hiphop people
dress to impress lewis
go to the rack
find a boyfriend shirt
that fits
bring the hair down if you can
tuck in the shirt
why doesnt anybody
tuck anything in anymore
oh im asking you
okay okay
benjamin
we made some progress
very big day
for the intern team
it was great

right
it was communication

you know you dont actually
have to keep doing that
oh force of habit
here you go
swiped these
from the tech fridge
oh nice going
you want a slice
sure thanks
cheers
cheers
i noticed
a couple hours ago
you had a meeting
with another possible ceo
i saw him arrive
howd that go
it was going well
until he called us
i believe the term he used
was a chick site
and i didnt hear
anything he said after that
apparently selling clothes
makes us a chick site
i mean really
how is this not legit
i couldnt agree more
i find that surprising
really
sexism in business
so
what did you do for work ben
before you retired
i was a vp
for dex one
phonebooks
yeah
i was in charge of printing
and before that i ran
sales and advertising
big jobs
wasnt this a factory
that used to make phonebooks
no what
yeah
what
this is
where you worked
for almost 40 years
yeah
for twentysome years
i sat right by that window
that was my office
it was
a few steps up back then
wed look out
over the whole factory
our printing presses
were in that corner
thats why the floor dips
back there
no way
i know everything
about this building
or used to
you know the sycamores on
the other side of the building
yeah
the big ones
yeah the big ones
i love them
yeah i remember
the day they were planted
is it totally weird
being back here
well
it feels like home
its remodeled but
home
so youre on facebook
huh
well ive been trying to
figure it out
i joined
about 10 minutes ago
well better late than never
you want some help
id love some but really
youve got better things to do

no i need one
if you want to look up
all those hotties
from high school you do
say cheese
cheese
thats cute
okay
i just need to send that to you
uh all right
so there are all these questions
for your profile
that you can answer
if you want to or not
like religious views
political views
people who inspire you
jules ostin
im not trying to
brownnose you
but ive been in business
a long time
and ive never run across
anyone quite like you
you do inspire jules
i just knew
at the end of the day
that a woman
with a glass of wine
and a laptop
had real shopping potential
and if you could actually
promise her things would fit
see
thats what i mean
okay
mm
you have a favorite quote
i do
youre never wrong
to do the right thing
who said that you
yeah
but im pretty sure
mark twain said it first

and at first i dont know
i thought
maybe this wasnt gonna work
but i was wrong
let me get
one of those
no no no
no
jules no explanation necessary
please
no actually one is because
i am usually better than this
the truth is
something about you
makes me feel calm
or more centered or something
and ii could use that
obviously
i hope youll accept my apology
and come back to work for me
if you want
and im not just saying this
because
i screwed up this morning
but i was thinking that
id like to bring you up to
my area next to becky
i know you can handle more work
if youd like more i
oh god i cant tell you
how much i hate
that i jumped the gun
and i made you feel

back to the office

actually
do you mind driving
i dont technically have a license

this is crazy ben
two desks

i like this arrangement
uh becky i want you to let ben
give you a hand okay
and cc him
on all my emails
did we get
yesterdays numbers
uh yes we did
i saw them here
here you go
thanks
and i need to go over the data
on customer purchase patterns
let ben take a look
at that too
actually let ben
take a look at that first
okay
dont worry becky
backups good
ping me
when cameron gets in
hey
becky
ive been here nine months ben
and shes never asked me
to take a look at anything
for her ever okay
i hear you
thats frustrating
i mean totally
i graduated from penn
i have a business degree
but i never seem to do
anything right around here
and youre like 50 years older
than me and youre deaf
i happen to think you do
a lot of things right
you do so much
i know
i know that
mmhmm
but she doesnt
i mean i bust my ass for her
14 hours a day
and she never notices
oh oh my god
i hate
girls who cry at work
how bout if you
just as an experiment
try letting me help you
a lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted
once youre out from under
this mountain of worry
and maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour
once in a while
see your friends
have a little fun
mmhmm i can offer
my assistance in this area
i would love to
actually
i just dont want her to think
that i cant do my job
and i need an intern
to help me
okay youre not gonna
want to hear this
but i heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night
gain 38 more weight
than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night
what
i leave here at 1100
i get back at 700
i sleep like five hours a night
and now im gonna get fat
lets get through this stuff
lets do it together
lets cleanslate it
lets just do it
yes
very nice st louis
ah suede jacket in dc
i cannot believe how well
that sweater is doing
im so happy
beautiful miami thank you
oh look at chicago
she put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from houston
okay lets see
what she does at checkout
shes not
buying them either
okay maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots
mmhmm
knockknock
hey
hi i took a look
at the data purchase patterns
uh should i come back
no no come on in
that was fast
well
i enlisted beckys help
it seems the most expensive
place youre advertising
is actually bringing you
the customers who are
spending the least
and the channels
youre least investing in
are adding enormous value
in segments that currently
appear to have low value
but actually have
the highest spending potential
thats what i could tell
so far
oh ben can you like
deal with that for me
maybe come up with
a better plan
i mean
if you have the time
happy to
the man spent 40 years
in business
yeah no i get it
and jules becky
was a huge help in this
you know she has
a business degree from penn
i know
i mean i forgot
but i know
ill say something
to her
that would be very nice
hey hows it goin up here
in firstclass
busy i see
you found an apartment

with the handkerchief
that one
i just dont get at all

that your generation

whats wrong
oh mom hi
um i just found out
that the zoom link
um the button that you click on
to zoom in on a photo
isnt working
that doesnt sound like such a big deal
well actually it is
um
its what people use to get
a closer look at what
everybody zooms in
i guess i dont go to your
website enough to know that
oh typing and ringing
yeah sorry
oh its the warehouse
mom im sorry
can i call you back
no need
okay love you
yep
who says yep
to i love you
hi alonzo
hi jules
not good news
what okay
lay it on me
in a routine check
by the sanitation department
they found one bedbug

unfortunately yes
we sent out 4800 boxes
yesterday
we have to get them all back
shut down the warehouse
ugh

then we can start shipping
again
nightmare
nightmare
okay here we are
okay
let me just finish this email
no
no
no no no
hey guys
thanks for coming
i know the zoom is broken
and i dont mean to
pull anyone off of that
but i need a favor
i accidentally sent an email
to the wrong person
and shes at work
right now
and i know she doesnt check
her personal email
until she gets home
at 530
so i have until then
to figure out how to delete it
because if this person sees
this email itll be horrible
and on top of that
she has a minor heart condition
i think this could
possibly be not good for that
so i am counting on
your good graces and brilliance
to figure out
a way to save my ass
truthfully jules
its pretty impossible
to hack into a server
techie 2 and you dont
know her password
no idea
jules i think theres only
one thing we can do
what tell me
im dying
me and the boys take off
we break into your moms house
and we steal her computer
break into her house
and steal the computer
are you kidding me
thats freaking genius
you will reach your destination
in 300 yards
little does gps lady know
she is an accomplice to a crime
the woman has a heart condition
think of it as a good deed
i never thought youd be a bad
influence on me whittaker
oh relax fellas this is
gonna be a piece of cake
the key
is under a flowerpot
we go in we delete
we disappear
she doesnt have an alarm
right
nope
she does not
what if theres like
a password on the email hmm
then
we take the computer
jules said shed buy her
a new one so its a winwin
you will reach your destination
in 100 yards
this is like
an oceans movie

how guys fit in you know
they still seem to be
trying to figure it out
theyre still dressing
like little boys
theyre still playing
video games
well theyve gotten great
so
i love video games
oh boy
how in one generation
have men gone from
guys like jack nicholson
and harrison ford to
take ben here
a dying breed
you know
look and learn boys

oh im pretty sure its not
so you havent
taken a xanax yet
you told me
to wait a few hours
you travel
with your own robe
yeah
ladies and gentlemen
a smoke alarm went off
in one of the rooms
but the problem
has been taken care of
our sincerest apologies
oh yeah
100 people 2 elevators
definitely a sign
well
thanks for escorting me back
mmhmm
you want to see my room
oh nice
i mean
do you actually want to come in
i have a tea kettle
we could have tea or
im ridiculously nervous
about tomorrow
you can lie down
i know youre tired
ill sit in the chair
here you go
i thought you were gonna
sit in a chair
please let me be here
i need to lie down too
we dont have to talk about work
or anything
all right
what should we talk about
marriage
will you tell me
about your wife
she was great right
she was
molly was her name
she was
a middleschool principal
beloved
so perfect
long marriage
not long enough
42 years
wow
what was that like
you know when people say
they want to grow old together
mmhmm
well we did that
we met when we were 20
well i was 20
she was 19
and what was amazing
is she never really changed
thats a hard thing
to pull off
she handled life
like it was easy
always
even when it wasnt
god i envy that
are you hungry
we have um
gummy bears chocolate chips
pringles
yup
im just gonna bring
the whole thing
you know those are
like 15 bucks each
benjamin i run a very big
internet company
lets go crazy
okay
so
so
yeah so
i got a weird one
for you
matt is cheating on me
wait a minute
you know about this
what does that mean
wait
you know about this
i saw them together
oh my god when
yesterday
im im sorry
i mean it was an accident
that i saw them but i did
yesterday
then it is
still going on
how long have you known
for like 18 days
shes a mom
at paiges school
its still so hard
for me to grasp
ii was in the kitchen
making sandwiches
and his phone was there
he was upstairs
with paige
and hhe was getting
all these text messages
and i dont know why
but i read them
it was not good
does he know you know
no
cause honestly im
im not ready
to deal with it
i would like to be
a little less devastated
if that is possible
its classic though
isnt it
the successful wife
the husband feels like
his manhood is threatened
so he acts out
girlfriend i guess
makes him feel more like a man
sometimes im not sure
i know how to do that
hold on hold on hold on
wait a minute wait a minute
youre not actually taking the
rap for any of this are you
no no no
he is the one
doing something wrong
i get that
monogamish
is not what im after
iim just
im taking a sec
and im hoping that its just
a horrible lapse in judgment
and not like love
and once
he moves through this
we will eventually
be able to be okay again
what do you think
about that
clearly you dont think
thats a possible thing
it it would be unusual
i get that
i get not everybody
could do that but
everybodys not us
i have faith in us
because
i believe
he still loves me
and you know weve been
going through so much that
god i wish your expressions
werent so transparent
some couples do survive
these things you know
i googled it staying
together after the affair
and a lot of couples
i mean a lot stay together
and anyway
there is something to be said
about moving through it
and focusing on us
and not on the affair
i dont want to
give up on him
i know him
and i know he knows better
but i am only human
and i am so mad at him
you know so much
has happened to us so fast
i think
part of me
was even expecting this
like you know he was
the more successful one
when we started out
no i didnt know that
yeah he was
he was a rising star
and he bowed out
so that i could do this
he was amazing
it was all his idea
im sure thats why
im even considering
this whole ceo thing
thinking maybe
someone else coming in
will help me
get my life back on track
okay that
thats it
i hate to be the feminist here
between the two of us
but you should be able to have
a huge career and be who you are
without having to accept that
your husband is having an affair
as some kind of payback
right on
i mean it
me too
but such is life
my friend
no it isnt
not always
and im not so sure
id be so forgiving
i am not so forgiving
im saying that i could
potentially be forgiving
but dont think that i
dont feel whats going on here
its crushing
and when i think of paige
oh dont
also if we got divorced
hed remarry
maybe not to this girl
but someone
and we both know im not easy
so i could be like single
forever which means that
forgive me but this does
keep me up
in the middle of the night
oh
what
that i dont want to
be buried alone
paigell be
with her husband
and mattll be
with his new family
and i will be
buried with strangers
i will buried in the strangers
singles section of the cemetery
not that that is a reason
to stay together
but its just you know
a scary sidebar
lets take that one
off your plate right now
you can be buried with
me and molly
i happen to have space
okay
oh
thank you so much
that is
and to think
i didnt even want to hire you
the one time
i dont have my hanky
you want to
watch tv
just for
a few minutes
yeah sure i would
even though
the planned merger has
were meant for me
and i was meant
for you
nature patterned you
and when she was done
you were
all the sweet things
rolled up in one
youre like
a plaintive melody
that never lets me free
but im content
the angels
must have sent you
and they meant you
just for me
airport please
so did we like him
he said
all the right things
he said that no one knows
about the fit like me
that he doesnt want to remove
the soul of the company
he said that
he doesnt have a plan
he wants to watch us
and see what works
he was polite and respectful
and super smart
and i hired him
seriously
yeah
you did it
right in the room
he told me to sleep on it
and that wed talk tomorrow
but i said
the job was his
we shook hands on it
you know if uh we disagree
hes the tiebreaker
of course
hes the ceo
yeah duh
hi
hey
you smell minty
i just made mint tea
so
yes no
i did it
i liked him
a lot
and uh
i offered him the job
wow really
yeah
and youre okay
with it
yeah
i think
itll be good for us
do we have any like real
booze like vodka or something
yeah
did good for us
mean
about the fit
or us
youandme us
i figure if someone else can
call some of the shots at work
then maybe
we can get back to
where we were 18 months ago
they say you cant put the genie
back in the bottle
but we can try right
hey
hi
wait you live here
yeah bens been putting me up
until i can find a place
oh should i let him know
that youre here
thats okay
ill ring
okay
fiona
jules
come on in
im just on my way
to work
bens right in here
ill let you two talk
see you
mmhmm
hi
wow
you and fiona huh
who knew
shes a great gal
she surprised me last night
she brought over dinner
its brandnew
congratulations
i love her
yeah
so i was ready kind of early
this morning since about 400
and matt and paige left an hour
ago for a field trip
so i thought id come by
i hope thats okay
yeah
i just wanted to say
i slept on it
i havent called townsend
yet but
i still feel like
its the right thing to do
well
i didnt
sleep so well myself
over this
you remember the day
i drove you to the warehouse
you were giving me the
wrong directions and all that
yeah i remember
okay well i stood in the back
and i watched you
show the workers
how to fold
and box the clothes
i knew then
that was why atf was a success
no one else
is ever gonna have
that kind of commitment
to your company jules
to me its pretty simple
about the fit needs you
and if you dont mind me saying
you need it
someone may come in
with more experience than you
but theyre never gonna know
what you know
i never had anything like this
in my life
not many people do
this big beautiful
exciting thing that you created
its a dream
isnt it
and youre gonna
give that up
in the hopes that your husband
will stop having an affair
i dont see
how that adds up
you should feel nothing but
great about what youve done
and id hate to see you let
anyone take that away from you
i guess
you came over here
because you wanted to hear
some of this
yes
and maybe also
because youre my
intern
well i was gonna say
internbest friend
but theres no need to get
all sentimental about it
even though we could potentially
be buried together
cant get closer
than that
its moments like this
when you need
someone you know
you can count on
so thank you
i like your house
so much by the way
thanks
so
shall we
okay
welcome back
you two
jules i have something cool
to show you
do you remember taking
a customerservice call
about a bride whose bridesmaids
dresses showed up in gray
and we had the vendor
remake them overnight
and put them on a plane

the silk chiffon
antoinette dress

but it was actually me
i got lost
its a confusing world
out there
and who i am

i love you and i will do so
much better if youll let me
