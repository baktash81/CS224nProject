five years 
five  wow 
every day  nights  weekends 
it s been very consuming 
do you have
a relationship  dan  family 
just trying to get
a better sense of who you are 
when it started  i was
seeing someone  but  you know 
with the nature of the work
and the hours   
i wasn t a very good partner 
five years 
and it could all go away 
just vanish in the face
of these allegations 
i can certainly imagine
an ambitious young man
like yourself
spends years
with his head buried
in some terrible spectacle 
gets frustrated
with the process 
sees an opportunity
to get the truth out faster 
maybe crosses a line 
i m assuming this is
the most important thing
  you ve ever been a part of 
  i didn t do it 
or i can see
an equally ambitious senator
encouraging you
to do something 
now would be
a good time to tell me 
that did not happen 
what i did  i did on my own 
i acted alone 
you ever sleep  bro 
i used to  got in the way of work 
anything in that bag
contain the real names
of cia officers 
assets or partners 
or any information
that would be in violation
of the agreement between
the central intelligence agency
and the united states senate 
  have a good night  jay 
  you  too  dan 
so  you did steal the document 
i did not steal it 
i relocated it 
everyone has their own words 
the language is built
to choose sides 
now  why did you relocate it 
they could send you
to jail  dan 
i think i should
start at the beginning 
  mcdonough  you dan jones 
  yeah 
  denis mcdonough 
  hi 
thank you so much
for meeting me 
come on in  yeah 
absolutely 
so  thanks for coming in 
uh  tell me your story 
my second day of grad school
was september 11th 
i was headed to a lecture 
and everything just    stopped 
the next day  i changed all my
classes to national security 
good man 
so  what s the long term plan 
where do you see yourself
in ten years 
are you running for office 
oh  uh  no 
no politics for me 
i think i d be more effective
behind the scenes 
somewhere i can
really make a difference 
so  what about before harvard 
uh  what d you fill up
your days with then 
teach for america
for three years in baltimore 
seventh graders 
i read that you taught
high school spanish
in saint paul  minnesota 
after college 
and lbj s first job
was teaching
at the mexican school
in south texas 
knowing how
to deal with children
is a highly useful skill
when working on the hill 
but from my perspective
as senate staff 
i would wait until
things turn around up here 
i think senator daschle
would say the same thing 
go get some real world
experience in counterterrorism 
in    foreign policy 
try the cia  try fbi 
have them teach you what they
don t teach you in a classroom 
then you can come back here  and   
help us fix all the things that
bush and cheney are breaking 
mcdonough 
yes  senator  uh  one second 
the boss  here 
keep in touch  huh 
  thank you very much for your time 
  absolutely 
mcdonough  i do not have
that information right now 
but i can certainly get that
for you in the next 15 
yeah 
in regards to
the bomb plots in germany 
three men were arrested
in medebach
with 1 500 pounds
of hydrogen peroxide
and 26 military grade
detonators 
the cia suspects
the islamic jihad union   
excuse me 
uh  can i borrow you
for a minute  dan 
uh  senator would
like to see you 
yeah  of course 
  morning  dan 
  morning  senator 
have you seen the story today
in the new york times 
  no  senator  i have not 
  evidently  the cia destroyed
tapes of interrogations
of al qaeda detainees 
did the intel committee know
there were tapes 
no  this is the first
i ve heard of it 
so  i want to find out
what was on the tapes
and why they were destroyed 
we want you to lead
the investigation  dan 
but if the tapes were
destroyed  how do we   
they re saying
they have written records 
thousands of pages 
let s see about that 
i want you to find out
exactly what they have
and read every word of it 
this report on the
destruction of tapes by the cia
  has been two years in the making 
  thank you 
the findings
are very troubling 
but it will remain classified 
based on these revelations 
a larger study into
the entire cia detention
and interrogation program
is clearly in order 
all in favor  say  yay  
  mr  whitehouse 
  yay 
  mr  burr 
  yay 
  mr  rockefeller 
  yay 
mr  chambliss 
  nay 
  mr  risch 
i think
this is a waste of time 
now  i know you voted
against this  saxby   
but you already had
your tapes investigation 
yes  but the rest of us
voted to go further  14 to one 
it s our job
to provide oversight 
all during the campaign 
you got candidate obama saying
how he wanted to be the first
post partisan president 
saxby  you know me 
it s my intention
that this report be seen
as coming from the entire
intelligence committee 
not just the democrats 
so  who takes the lead 
well  i was thinking dan jones 
he spent four years doing
counterterrorism at the fbi 
he s already got
the security clearances 
the rules are the same
as the tapes investigation 
no politics  no bias 
and the senator
isn t interested
in opinions or theories 
just facts 
based on what
you found out already 
this could go to
a pretty dark place 
you need to keep your
personal feelings out of it 
that s the first thing
republicans are gonna look for 
no talking to the press
or your girlfriend
or any family members 
nobody outside of
the committee 
you re gonna get
a team of six   
three republicans 
three democrats   
but there can t be
any republican sentences
or democratic paragraphs 
and how long do we have 
we re hoping you can
wrap it up in a year or so 
you re gonna have to keep the
senators updated on your work 
nobody wants any surprises 
there s a covert cia off site
in virginia 
you start tomorrow 
  jones  right 
  sean 
  hi  dan 
  sean murphy from the agency 
  let s go inside 
  okay 
identification  gentlemen 
the room we ve designated is a scif 
no phone reception  no photos   
you know the drill   
lead walls 
and  per the agreement 
the room is off limits
to everyone
  except committee personnel 
  absolutely 
no one inside
without your permission 
  and the computers 
  right here 
your own dedicated server 
air gapped workstations 
we ll be updating
the database as we go 
the files will be loaded
on here as we collect them
  from across the agency 
  great 
we ll want all relevant
documents as soon as possible 
  well  we got to vet it first 
  vet 
there s a lot to   
director panetta
agreed to give us
everything pertaining
to the program 
wh who would be 
who would be vetting it 
it s a big agency 
we got to make sure
you don t get anything
you re not supposed to 
make yourself at home 
there s    no printer 
no paper 
no documents are allowed
to leave the room
without cia approval 
paper has a way of getting
people in trouble at our place 
i think at some point
we re gonna need a printer 
and paper 
at our place   
paper s how
we keep track of laws 
okay 
   calling this
an obvious terrorist attack
based on very
preliminary information 
the information that
intelligence officials
are getting   
you re not gonna like this 
   a possible
hijacked plane  and of course
the the very horrifying video
of the plane   
we confirmed some of the names 
the hijackers 
two of the guys from
the malaysia meetings 
the san diego guys 
they took down flight 77 
pentagon 
   the coordination
that took place
to have two planes
hit the towers   
attention  everyone  please 
we have reason to believe
the counterterrorism center
is a potential target 
we re asking all personnel
to evacuate  immediately 
jim miklaszewski
there from the pentagon 
of course  the president
has the authority
to scramble
military  uh  forces 
and  uh  this is a case 
obviously 
in which  uh  retaliation 
if indeed it proves to be
a terrorist incident 
will be contemplated 
we also have to work  though 
sort of  the the dark side 
if you will 
we ve got to spend time
in the shadows
in in the intelligence world 
uh  a lot of
what needs to be done here
will have to be done quietly 
without any discussion   
fucking warned them 
august 6th
presidential briefing 
 bin ladin determined
to strike in u s  
  flashing red lights 
  and before that 
in july  what did we say 
 there will be
significant terrorist attacks
against the united states in
the weeks and months to come  
it s not your fault 
it is a mean  nasty  dangerous 
uh  dirty business out there 
and we have to operate
in that arena 
but we need to make certain
that we have not
tied the hands  if you will 
of our intelligence community 
counterterrorism director black
and i saw president bush
at camp david this weekend 
and the president gave me
his word that there will be
no changes in cia leadership as
a result of tuesday s attacks 
we will look forward now 
not waste time second guessing
or looking for blame 
going forward  we will be
the tip of the spear
in the battle against al qaeda 
as i said
to the president  two weeks 
we ll have flies walking
across al qaeda eyeballs 
i ve asked chief counsel rizzo
here to walk us through
where we are from
a legal standpoint 
the president has issued
a memorandum of notification
giving cia the power to capture
and detain suspected terrorists
on the battlefield 
detain them where 
are we bringing them
to the u s  
we re really not
in the prison business
  over in counterterrorism 
  look 
the budget for counterterrorism
last week was what 
 600 million 
the budget this week is
whatever you need it to be 
and we are in whatever business
it takes to get the job done 
initially  cia legal
stated that any facility used
to hold detainees
had to meet the requirements
of the u s  bureau of prisons 
but then deputy director pavitt
thought that was
gonna be too limiting 
so  who came up
with the black sites 
not totally clear 
my guess is either
a senior officer
at counterterr    ctc 
or alec station bin laden unit
decided black sites
were the best option 
well  did the cia
tell the state department
they were making deals
to hold people on foreign soil 
where was secretary of state
powell in all this 
well  i found a memo 
the cia s general counsel   
said the decision was made
not to tell powell
about the program 
because   
 he would blow his stack
if he were to be briefed
on what was going on  
well  who decided that 
someone inside the white house 
mm hmm 
what about interrogations 
president bush s memoranda
just authorized
capturing and detaining 
it didn t say anything
about interrogations 
and who gave them permission
to play that role 
nobody  it looks like
it started with legal at ctc 
do you want me to brief senator mccain
on this  i know he s interested 
the republicans just
pulled out of the study  dan 
good morning 
where is everybody 
attorney general holder
opened a criminal investigation
into the cia 
as a result  the agency
won t allow any of their people
to be interviewed
for our report 
the republicans don t see
how we can move forward 
so they re out 
so  does this mean we stop 
i mean  the committee
voted to investigate 
the senator says we keep going 
but we can t actually talk
to anyone who was involved
  in the program 
  right  according to cia legal 
cia personnel is
only speaking to doj 
and is doj gonna
share their findings 
i mean  can we work with them 
i ve reached out
to the special prosecutor 
i m waiting to hear back 
okay  but if nobody who
actually worked on the program
is going to talk to us 
how do we investigate 
so  we have the files 
their e mails and cables 
their memos 
we have to use
their own communications
to tell the story 
do you have any idea
how hard that s gonna be 
the tapes investigation
took two years  dan 
and this is about a lot more
than what was on the tapes 
uh  we don t even know
what this is 
right  but we do know
who it starts with 
we go one detainee at a time 
you speak english 
my name is ali soufan 
i m with the fbi 
you re under arrest 
  you understand 
  no  where are you taking me 
your wound is infected 
but we re going to
take good care of you 
i want to show you something 
he s talking to
someone off screen 
he s calling him mukhtar 
you know who that is 
mukhtar 
a man who lost his mind 
no  not him 
khalid sheikh mohammed 
abu zubaydah confirmed
that ksm is the leader
of all al qaeda operations
outside of afghanistan 
he trained the hijackers 
we re calling him
the mastermind 
outstanding 
hats off
to the bin laden group 
whichever one of
your people did this 
i want to call them and
congratulate them in person 
who was it 
wasn t our guy 
what  who got it 
fbi is working zubaydah 
an fbi guy got this 
yes  ali soufan 
uh  they used him
in the cole investigation 
he s part of their counterterrorism group 
he speaks arabic 
i don t care who speaks arabic 
this is not just
a criminal investigation 
we are gathering
intelligence here 
that is what we do 
the fbi is looking at the past 
we need to stop attacks
in the future 
i want cia in the room
with this guy  okay 
i want cia
in the room with zubaydah 
so  who do we have
who can work on him 
cia runs sources 
people who cooperate 
that s not these guys 
every second we are not
draining the detainee s brain 
we are rolling the dice 
we need our people in the room 
we need to be the ones
asking the questions now 
i heard from someone
over in technical services 
a woman named miriam 
about a couple of
air force psychologists
who came in and pitched a whole
new approach to interrogations 
jim mitchell and bruce jessen 
miriam says mitchell
has the special sauce 
zubaydah didn t
tell us everything 
because we stopped short
of where we needed to go 
sere stands for survival 
evasion  resistance and escape 
it s a program to help prepare
u s  special forces
for whatever they might
encounter if captured 
now  i have over 14 000 hours
observing sere
interrogation techniques 
bruce here
has more than that   
uh  observing 
as opposed to    
i took a course in conducting
interrogations as well 
i worked with volunteers
in actual simulations 
we feel we can reverse engineer
these sere techniques
to induce learned helplessness 
can you explain
what that means 
 reverse engineer  
instead of using
these techniques
to protect our people 
we use them to achieve
compliance in the detainees 
our plan involves  uh 
using individual assessments
of detainees to create
a program designed to induce
debility  dependency and dread 
  we call these the three  d s 
  three  d s 
and there s science
to back this up 
oh  yes  yes  sir 
excuse me  dr  mitchell 
can you elaborate on  uh  the
techniques you ll be employing 
absolutely 
the  uh  the attention grasp 
walling 
facial hold 
the facial slap or insult slap 
cramped confinement 
wall standing 
stress positions 
sleep deprivation 
waterboarding 
use of insects 
and mock burials 
well  from my perspective 
this seems like it could be
a potential game changer 
but  of course   
it s up to director rodriguez 
i think if we re serious about
stopping the next threat 
we need to put on
our big boy pants
and provide the authorities
these guys need 
these approaches might   
raise some eyebrows at defense 
well  we re not at defense 
we re at the cia 
besides  you just said 
we use this sere stuff
on our guys all the time 
i don t see a problem 
shortly after
the cia s decision
to engage dr  mitchell 
abu zubaydah was moved
to a cell that was lit
24 hours a day 
loud noise was fed into
his cell to disrupt his sleep 
what about the guy
who got him talking 
ali soufan 
wait  he s fbi  not cia 
so  we can ask him
questions  right 
no rule against that 
we can try 
there s only
one interrogation technique
that works  rapport building 
you get close to these guys 
and they open up 
but the cia
didn t believe that 
just look at abu zubaydah 
well  you got him to talk 
how d you do that 
i walked in one day and
played him a tape of himself 
most of it was
of a phone conversation 
uh  we had tapped his phones 
but he forgot to hang up
at the end of the call 
so we had all this
background noise of his house 
then my partner walked in
with a big box
full of cassette tapes 
we told him we had bugged
his safe house 
we had been listening
for months 
we knew everything 
so lying was pointless 
he looked at
the box full of tapes and   
and all all the tapes
were blank 
of course they were 
but he didn t know that 
so  he talked 
uh  what happened when
the contractors showed up 
who the fuck is this 
dr  mitchell
is an air force psychologist 
and he s developed
a new method of interrogation 
why why do we need
a new method 
he s not telling you
everything 
we think he knows more 
we put him at number three
or number four
in al qaeda leadership 
he probably knows
the next move 
do you speak arabic  jim 
does gary here 
don t need to 
c can i ask you something 
have you ever interrogated
any sort of extremist before 
  know much about al qaeda 
  no 
have you ever interrogated
any sort of terrorist before 
  no 
  any sort of criminal 
no 
have you ever interrogated
anyone before 
it s not important 
he s a human 
i m a psychologist 
he knows a secret 
and i m gonna get him
to tell that secret to gary 
what what are you going
to do to him that isn t   
what am i gonna do 
what is jim gonna do 
jim s gonna do what works 
let s go  shitbird 
move it  asshole 
help  please 
you can t just shave
a muslim man 
do you know what that means 
he s going to shut down 
got to humiliate him 
right off the bat 
same reason
we took away his clothes 
why the loud music 
sleep deprivation 
we stop the music
when he starts talking 
then he can sleep 
tired people tell the truth 
learned helplessness 
you re familiar with
dr  martin seligman 
seligman did
an experiment with dogs 
he put them in a cage
with a barrier
running down the middle 
and one side of the cage
was electrified
and the other wasn t 
at first 
when he shocked the dogs 
they d jump over the barrier
to get away 
and then
he electrified both sides 
there was no escape 
no belief they could
change anything 
he d open the door to the cage 
they wouldn t even leave 
it s learned helplessness 
that s what we re
gonna instill in this man 
you ll see 
a coffin 
you re gonna kill him 
let s call it
a confinement box 
i got this one 
and i got a smaller one 
and you re gonna
put him in there 
with these  which  based on
my evaluation  he hates 
are you out of your mind 
we don t do this 
you know this is
against the law 
the most senior people
have signed off on it 
we re putting him on trial 
how are we gonna build
a case against him 
who says he s getting a trial 
i wanted to arrest him
right there on the spot 
  i told the bureau that 
  what d they say 
they briefed director mueller 
and told me to get the hell
out of there  so i did 
  when was that 
  late may  mid may or   
 cause i m finding records
that say that mitchell left
a little while later 
early june 
for r   r and some meetings
at headquarters 
but we had one
high value detainee in custody 
abu zubaydah 
and after mitchell left 
the cia put him in isolation 
and didn t ask him
a single question for 47 days 
are you fucking kidding me 
the whole country was
on red alert that summer 
if they were so concerned
about the next attack 
why d they stop
asking questions 
right  it doesn t
make any sense 
once the psychologist
showed up 
almost nothing did anymore 
the cia said
zubaydah was involved
in every major
terrorist operation
carried out by al qaeda 
they told the president
he was number three or four
in the organization 
yes  that was
my understanding as well 
and the claim that
zubaydah was a major player
was the main justification they
gave to the justice department
for needing to go harder 
they were certain
he knew about the next attack 
but last night i found this 
turns out zubaydah wasn t three
or four in the organization 
he wasn t part of
al qaeda leadership at all 
they only had one source
calling him that 
and that source later admitted
he was lying 
so  they exaggerated who he was
to the president
and the department of justice
in order to get legal approvals
for these new techniques 
is that what you re saying 
i think that s a possibility 
the program
really starts with him 
have you guys
used this thing before 
the waterboard 
no  it s a navy thing 
but we watched a video 
we tested it on each other 
just to get a feel
for the experience 
is it safe 
yes 
  monarch to the kingdom
of the dead     
who are
the operatives inside the u s  
i don t know 
  infamous     
when is the next attack 
i don t know 
one  two  three  four  five 
six  seven  eight  nine 
10  11 
12  13  14 
15  16  17  18 
19  20  21  22 
23  24  25  26 
when is the next attack 
who are the operatives
inside the u s  
anything in that bag
contain the real names
of cia officers 
assets or partners 
or any information that would
violate the agreement between
the central intelligence agency
and the united states senate 
  all good 
  all right  good night 
  have a good night  jay 
  get home safe 
good night 
dan jones 
do i know you 
no  but i think i can help you 
  help help me with what 
  the eit program 
that s what you re
looking into  isn t it 
i need to know
i won t be named  anywhere 
i m still with the agency 
my even being here with you 
talking  is   
what was your involvement 
office of medical services 
black sites 
  so  you re a doctor 
  physician s assistant 
the american
medical association
won t allow doctors
to be involved 
they take an oath  do no harm 
we re the next best thing 
i was there
when the contractors arrived 
they made tapes of the
abu zubaydah interrogations 
but there s a 21 hour period
where the transcripts
are missing    nothing 
they were using the waterboard 
zubaydah lost consciousness 
he was choking to death 
drowning 
not just thinking
he was drowning 
he was actually
fucking drowning 
i was told that the waterboard
was only gonna be used
as a last resort 
the contractors did
an assessment of the prisoner 
  and they made a call   
  what kind of assessment 
th they bounced him
off the walls a few times
and then strapped him down and
poured water down his throat 
we understand this is
a different approach 
  but it s based on science 
  science 
oh  come on  what science 
  have you seen their science 
  they believe the waterboard
is working here
to create compliance 
well  of course they do 
they re the ones who get
to decide when it s used 
and they re also the ones who
get to decide if it s working 
how is that even ethical 
the people we re dealing with
weaponized daily life 
would you like to talk about
the ethics of that 
we re here to make sure
that nothing like that
ever happens again 
they re training their people
to resist
traditional interrogations
in the back of a cave
somewhere 
so we need to change
our approach
before another bomb goes off
or another building falls down 
okay  okay 
what is gonna happen when one
of our soldiers gets captured
and takes out a card with
the geneva convention on it
and wants to be treated
like a human being 
you think his captors
aren t gonna remember
the way these people
were treated here 
  and for what 
  do you have a kid at home 
we re not gonna get beat again 
besides the chief of station 
did you report your concerns
up the chain of command 
we got a cable from
director rodriguez
telling us to stop putting
our objections in writing 
no paper trail 
i told them if they were gonna
keep using the new techniques 
i wanted out 
i wasn t the only one 
guys were choking up 
it s all in the e mails 
as early as november 2001 
the cia s legal team
circulated a memorandum
describing
a novel legal defense
for their officers
who might engage in torture 
come on  they actually
called it torture 
the cia 
they just forgot
we have laws against that 
yes  sir 
mitchell and jessen renamed it
 enhanced interrogation 
to help sell it 
but the agency was
talking about doing it
before they even had
a single detainee 
my question  senator  is 
how did the cia know
they needed
to torture prisoners
before they even had one 
that didn t come from
cheney and addington 
seems like it happened
the other way around 
the cia took it
to the bush white house
and john yoo at
the office of legal counsel 
so  here s where we re at 
the crime of torture 
as described in section 2340 
requires that the defendant   
in this case  an interrogator   
intends to cause
severe pain or suffering 
but in this case  that s not
the interrogator s intent 
right  the intent is to gain
intel  save american lives 
but  john 
what if the techniques
the interrogator employs
do nonetheless
cause pain and suffering 
how do we deal with that 
well  the key phrase is
 severe pain or suffering  
but 2340 never actually defines
the term  severe  
we found this definition
in a medicare statute 
severe pain or suffering 
 acute symptoms that place the
individual in serious jeopardy
  and are hard to endure  
  meaning 
to constitute torture 
the damage done must rise
to the level of organ failure 
impairment of bodily function 
or death 
so  basically  if someone dies 
we re doing it wrong 
if the president
deemed it necessary
to    crush the testicles
of a child
to stop a plane
from crashing into a building 
to save american lives 
there is no law or treaty
that could stop him 
i can make
the same argument for
gouging out a prisoner s eyes
or dousing him with acid 
in our opinion 
if it provides unique
intelligence that saves lives 
and doesn t cause
any lasting harm 
then it s legal
for the president to order it 
what do we mean
when we say  unique  
intelligence that couldn t have
been obtained any other way 
and you ve discussed
all of this
with the white house  i assume 
and 
did they tell bush what
they were gonna do to zubaydah 
  no 
  and national security advisor rice   
  where was she in all this 
  national security advisor rice
was told about the program 
but she was also told
the president
would not be briefed 
who tells the president s
national security advisor
not to brief the president 
cheney and addington 
according to cia records  bush
wasn t told about the program
until april of 2006 
four years later 
and the records we found state
that when the president was
finally told about the program 
he expressed discomfort
with the image of a detainee
chained to the ceiling 
wearing a diaper 
and forced to go
to the bathroom on himself 
how long till you can
get this thing done  dan 
we ve got to get this out 
what about this guy 
gul rahman 
captured in peshawar 
november 2002 
he s not at gitmo 
he s he s not anywhere 
gul rahman 
gul   
no  they didn t tell
the committee about him 
he s detainee number 24 
hq says he knows
operational detail
about al qaeda 
the guy s an asshole 
threw his food at us  he
threatened to kill the guards 
i ve asked headquarters
to approve the application
of the enhanced measures
for this detainee 
and the request
has been approved 
  oh  great  we haven t had any luck loosening him up 
  mm 
come on 
ran him up and down the hall 
beat the crap out of him   
nothing 
even been trying this thing
they call short shackling 
chain a dude s hands
to a bolt on the floor 
then you chain his feet
to the same bolt 
farmers call it hog tying 
i think 
he finally admitted
to something 
what was that 
that he was who we said he was 
gul rahman 
what you want to do first is
take away his sense of control 
if you like  i could spend
some time showing you
how to achieve this
with the enhanced techniques 
great 
we got another 30 guys here
to deal with 
i heard you told the doctor
you were cold 
  the beautiful people  
    the beautiful people  
    ah  
  the beautiful people  
    the beautiful people  
    ah     
senator  do you have
a few minutes this morning 
absolutely  come on in  dan 
the senator is
needed on the floor for a vote 
uh  give her five minutes 
did you sleep last night  dan 
uh  senator  a prisoner died 
  there s no time  
  to discriminate 
hate every motherfucker  
  that s in your     
gul rahman 
they thought he was maybe
working for an afghan warlord
or that he knew something
about an attack 
  did he 
  no  he died before they found out
anything besides his name 
dumped cold water on him
one night
and found him dead in his cell
in the morning 
the autopsy said hypothermia 
  where did you get this from 
  inspector general s report 
cia did their own investigation
into the death of gul rahman 
the officer in charge
was recommended
for a performance bonus 
they promoted him 
he s still out there
in the field 
well  are you accusing the cia
of murder  dan 
because that sounds like
where this is going 
we have proof
the deputy director
coached the officer in charge
how to cover up what happened 
told him to be careful
what he put in writing 
so  why would they need
to cover it up
if they were following
standard operating procedure 
why didn t they tell
the committee 
why didn t they tell you 
i m gonna need to review
all this personally 
it s very disconcerting 
 disconcerting  
 very disconcerting  
dan  you need to be
careful here 
you re getting
emotionally involved 
they fucking killed a guy  and
nobody was held accountable 
w we don t know
he was a terrorist 
  we barely even know his name 
  i understand 
and what you need
to understand is that
her name is going
on this report  not yours 
senate staff doesn t
have to run for reelection 
but she does 
their legal argument said eits
wouldn t cause lasting harm 
so how long is gul rahman
gonna be dead for 
are you guys seeing
this panetta review 
it just showed up 
i don t understand 
looks like the cia did
their own investigation 
it confirms everything
we ve been finding 
so  what are you
gonna do with it 
hopefully  nothing 
special prosecutor durham 
please 
i ve already left
several messages 
it s dan jones again from
the intelligence committee 
how are you 
good  i just wanted
to check in again to see
if the special prosecutor
is available
to meet on the cia probe 
it can be off the record 
i just want to compare notes 
yeah  same number 
thank you 
you know  we got to think back
to the period after 9 11 
we didn t even know who hit us 
we didn t know that
khalid sheikh mohammed was
the mastermind of 9 11
or the operational commander
of al qaeda 
and then we started rounding up
these terrorists 
we caught abu zubaydah 
we caught  uh 
ramzi bin al shibh and ksm 
and these guys provided us
information under questioning
by the cia that stopped
a number of terrorist attacks 
they were pl planning
to blow up
the u s  consulate
in karachi  pakistan 
  shit 
  they were planning to blow up
our marine camp in djibouti   
  good morning 
  khalid sheikh mohammed was
indicted in new york for trying
to blow up airplanes in 1995 
the cia already knew about him 
they knew he was close
to bin laden 
they knew about him before
zubaydah ever identified him 
how long have you been here 
also  according to this cable   
a few hours   
a cia officer in islamabad
began working someone
they call asset x 
x claimed to have
direct access to ksm 
but was eventually turned away
when he asked for money 
  how much money 
  few thousand bucks 
two years later  after
they ve been putting him off 
putting him off  putting him
off  they finally pay him 
and almost immediately
he sends a text
to his cia handler saying 
 i m with ksm  
it had nothing to do
with the waterboard 
  good morning 
  good morning 
one  two  three 
four  five  six   
who are you
working with in the u s  
   seven  eight  nine 
10  11   
we have your kids 
     12  13  14  15 
    yankee doodle  keep it up  
  16  17   
    yankee doodle dandy     
it will stop if you talk 
  and with the girls be handy 
yankee doodle     
where is the next attack 
canary wharf  canary wharf 
  stuck a feather in  
  his hat and called it     
okay  here s the problem 
we already know about
the heathrow
and canary wharf plots 
he knows that 
it s in his goddamn notebook 
we asked about plots
in the u s   not london 
  he s fucking with you again 
  to be honest 
i ve never met a resistor
like this guy 
he s a super resistor 
he lied to you
to make you stop 
he just tells us shit
he knows we already have 
that s all he does 
then that s
what we re learning 
that s what the waterboard
is giving us 
we now know he s lying 
i thought it was meant
to give us the truth 
and    the truth is he s lying 
headquarters says we go again 
the chief of interrogations
ordered the rectal rehydration
of ksm 
not for health reasons 
but as a way of showing total
control over the detainee 
even though
rectal rehydration was never
an approved technique 
total control isn t
chaining the guy to the wall 
keeping him awake for days 
and threatening his family 
you need to shove a tube
up his ass 
this right here
is the rest of your life
unless you start telling the truth 
then they went back
to waterboarding him 
 when a medical officer
pressed on ksm s    
  wait  where are you 
  next page 
 when a medical officer
pressed on ksm s abdomen 
he expressed water
from his mouth and nose  
so  he was swallowing
all the water 
 on march 17th 
the waterboard technique
began to evolve  
interrogators used their hands
to maintain
a pool of water
over ksm s nose and mouth 
who are
the operatives inside the u s  
issa    issa   
issa al britani 
where is the next attack 
m montana 
we got something 
ksm told interrogators he sent
abu issa al britani to the u s 
to recruit african american
muslims in montana
to blow up gas stations
and start forest fires 
montana 
muslims in montana 
the fbi had serious doubts
as well 
later  ksm admitted
he just told them
what they wanted to hear
to make it stop 
so  did they get anything
actionable from him at all 
anything that saved lives 
they waterboarded him
183 times  and then concluded
ksm may never be
forthcoming or honest 
everything they got from him
was either a lie
or something they already had 
well  okay 
so my first question is 
if it works  why do you need
to do it 183 times 
maybe when
the report comes out 
people will finally see that 
well  let s worry about getting
it right  getting it done 
we can worry about
changing the world later 
sorry i m late 
it s okay 
  barely slept 
  want some coffee 
hey  can i ask you something 
you ever  uh  have dreams 
you know  about the stuff
that s in the report 
yeah  i have one
where i m drowning 
i can t move my arms or legs 
i can t breathe 
  that wakes me up 
  last night i dreamt
i was trapped in
one of those confinement boxes 
they just left me there 
daniel jones  right 
  do i know you 
  i just wanted to tell you to your face
that i think you
and that report are garbage 
  excuse me   
  you weren t there 
so you don t know
what worked and what didn t
or what we were up against 
you may not realize 
but we were trying
to protect this country
from people who want to destroy
everything we believe in 
you may not realize it 
but we re trying to do
the exact same thing 
your bullshit report will
never see the light of day 
special prosecutor
durham  please 
it s dan jones  calling again
about the justice department
investigation of the cia 
we really need to meet 
you have 
okay  what are their findings 
fuck 
nothing 
no indictments at all 
no charges against
jose rodriguez or gina haspel
for destroying the tapes 
nothing against the cia
for torturing people 
nothing against
jim pavitt and the others
for providing misinformation 
nothing at all 
doj says they don t have
enough admissible evidence
to convict anyone 
you go after the contractors 
and they re indemnified 
you go after
the head of counterterrorism 
and he d just say
he was following orders
from the cia director 
you go after the director 
and he   
well  he would just cite
the president 
then the white house
would claim national security 
doj at least share
what they found 
no 
they won t turn anything over 
we re the only ones
still looking at this 
dan 
dan 
you know a cia officer
testified before congress
in 1978 regarding the use of
coercive physical interrogation
techniques in latin america 
and the officer said
the techniques result
in false answers and have
proven to be ineffective 
and before latin america 
they did it in vietnam 
they knew it didn t work   
dan  i need
to tell you something 
   and they did it again 
don t even listen
to their own fucking people 
i m leaving the study 
i    i got a job offer 
and i can t turn it down 
i m sorry  but don t you see
what this is doing to you 
to all of us 
i mean  my kids
are at home growing up 
and i m down here reading about
how they put a power drill
against one guy s head
and and how they pulled
another guy s arms
out of his sockets 
and i just    this is
how i m spending my sundays 
and my saturdays 
this is how i spend every day 
i just    i i i i can t 
um    i m gonna leave
after thanksgiving 
okay  i understand 
okay 
thanksgiving 
that gives us   
that gives us a couple months 
dan  it s november 
thanksgiving is next week 
how many pages have
we written so far  thousands 
we don t even know
if this is ever gonna come out 
the tapes investigation
never did 
it s still classified 
you just said it yourself 
the cia knew
this shit didn t work in 1978 
and it didn t stop them
from doing it again 
look  we ve been down here
for two years  dan 
in this basement 
nobody s waiting for us
to come out 
   shocking photos that
apparently show u s  troops
abusing detainees in a prison
outside baghdad 
we have a problem 
both myself and the president
have gone on record
saying we do not
torture people 
he just made a statement
for the u n  s goddamn
day in support
of victims of torture 
wh what what did he say 
 the united states
does not torture 
it s against our laws
and it s against our values 
i have not authorized it 
and i will not authorize it  
i m not sure where
that leaves either of us 
so  here s the deal 
some new lawyer over at olc 
jack goldsmith 
is saying there are issues
with the john yoo memo 
legal issues 
yeah  and there s
the inspector general s report 
allegations of
war crimes and torture 
throws the whole
program under the goddamn bus 
what s it say 
 the inspector general finds
that eits are inconsistent
with the
public policy positions
the united states has taken
regarding human rights  
blah  blah  blah 
 the program  as implemented 
diverges sharply from how the
cia has described   blah  blah 
 there is also little evidence
that the waterboard
is effective
in gaining information  
look  guys  director tenet
wants to pause the program 
you know  i retired
from the air force
just a couple of months
before 9 11 
22 years 
and then
i wake up that morning 
and i turn on the news and   
see what s happening 
a lot of people just went back
to their coffee and cornflakes 
but jim wanted
to do something
to keep people safe 
we are going right back to the
national security council today
and asking to have
the program recertified 
as many techniques as possible 
we have a plan 
thank you  thank you 
jones 
yes  senator 
on the sunday talk shows 
former defense secretary
donald rumsfeld
and former vice president
dick cheney
argued enhanced interrogation
techniques played a major role
in leading up to the raid
on bin laden s compound 
no  that s not right 
that s not what happened 
  it was not torture 
  i ll look into it 
and  uh  i would strongly
recommend that we continue it 
at the heart of the controversy
is a process called
waterboarding 
okay  here s what
the cia is claiming 
they got bin laden after using
eits against detainees 
they say it all started in 2002
with abu zubaydah
and a detainee they called
 riyadh the facilitator  
who tipped them off
to abu ahmed al kuwaiti 
who had ties to bin laden 
that s not what happened 
the truth is the cia
was on al kuwaiti s phones 
e mails  identity  long before
they captured any detainees 
before they even had
an eit program 
zubaydah told us al kuwaiti had
nothing to do with bin laden 
same with ksm
and and the others 
but now we have former
cia director michael hayden
on the radio saying
this all came from eits 
and former attorney general
mukasey is out there saying
ksm broke like a dam
after waterboarding 
where is he saying that 
wall street journal 
i found a memo 
it s from a few months back 
in march 
it s called
 the public roll out  
the memo states the agency
wanted their pr people
to connect the bin laden raid
to intel obtained via eits
before it even happened 
so    if the cia got bin laden 
then who cares
what else it did 
if it saved lives  there s
no need for accountability 
exactly  they lied to bush
about the program 
now they re lying
to president obama 
this document about bin laden
and  uh  the role of eits 
it just isn t true 
you want me to get you
the white house 
let s do that 
it s very clear to us
the eits did not lead
to bin laden 
the cia is misrepresenting
the operation 
i m sure you see that 
don t you 
mcdonough   i m not
sure i understand  senator 
the mission was a success 
that s the headline here 
this is a crucial moment
in our nation s history 
i want to make certain that the
agency isn t manipulating it
to sanitize
their own past actions 
i will let
the national security advisor
know your concerns  senator 
  thank you 
  thank you  senator feinstein 
that s it 
they don t care
the story is wrong 
well  i don t think we can look
to the white house for support 
what the hell just happened 
the cia just got
the president reelected 
that s what happened 
it was the
greatest manhunt of all time 
you think you know the story 
but hold on to your seats 
zero dark thirty 
the riveting new film 
brings you the hunt
for osama bin laden
as it has never been
seen before 
this is it 
the last guy we have 
number 119  muhammad rahim 
captured june 2007 
we kept rahim awake
for 138 hours straight 
used the attention grasp 
facial hold 
dietary manipulation 
abdominal slaps 
stress positions 
we even offered him a towel
to wear if he cooperated 
gave us nothing 
he said that 
if we hurt him 
he d just make things up
to get us to stop 
and then he said
he was at our mercy
and we could kill him
if we wanted 
what s the point
of moving forward
without the waterboard 
it s like trying to play
baseball without the bat 
we ve been going at him
for 60 days now 
not getting anywhere 
the problem is
that ctc hasn t given us
any good intel
to question him about 
we don t have any leverage 
hold on 
you re the psychologists 
you told me you were
gonna get us intel 
now you re saying
we need to give it to you 
i m thinking we improve his
treatment for a week or two 
give him some hope 
and then we go back at him hard
and create
a sense of helplessness 
or we could try recruiting him 
tell him he can be
a cia agent if he talks 
the fbi does that 
we re not the fbi 
we don t do that 
the way the science works is
we only get the intel after   
after what 
why are so many of these guys
still lying to us
after you work on them 
where s the special sauce 
you have to make this work 
it s only legal if it works 
the cia s questioning
of muhammad rahim
resulted in
zero intelligence reports 
on april 21  2008 
the agency convened
an after action review
of his interrogation 
senator  i just want to point
out that this is the first time
the agency stopped
and evaluated
the effectiveness
of the program 
and they concluded that 
in the future 
cia interrogators should use
rapport building 
they even suggested
asking other agencies 
law enforcement 
and even other countries
about effective
interrogation methods 
so   
for the past six years 
there s been a steady stream
of cia personnel   
directors  deputies  analysts   
coming over here and telling me
what an amazing success
eits have been 
somehow not even one of them
managed to mention that part 
how many detainees have been
through the program in total 
at least 119 
the agency admits
a quarter of them
should never
have been detained 
the eit program never worked 
not on anyone 
today  we are gathered
to approve
the committee s study of
the cia detention
and interrogation program 
i would like to thank
daniel jones
and his small staff
who prepared this study 
clerk  would you call the roll 
  mr  udall

the motion passes 
the report will now be sent
to the cia for final comments 
i  john owen brennan 
do solemnly swear to tell
the truth  the full truth 
and nothing but the truth 
so help me god 
thank you  mr  brennan 
i look forward
to hearing your testimony 
i am honored
to appear before you today
as the president s nominee
for director of the cia 
i d like to say from
the beginning that honesty   
truthfulness    was a value
inculcated in me
growing up in new jersey by
my parents  owen and dorothy 
now  none of us
are perfect beings 
i am far from perfect 
but i will be honest
with this committee
and do everything possible
to meet your legitimate needs
and requirements 
mr  brennan 
i ve long believed that our
government has an obligation
to the american people to face
its mistakes transparently 
to help the public understand
the nature of those mistakes 
and to correct them 
the enhanced interrogation
techniques were brutal 
and  perhaps most importantly 
they did not work 
now  the cia has
a responsibility
to correct any inaccurate
information it provided
to the previous white house 
the department of justice 
congress and the public 
so  here s my question 
do you agree that the cia
has this responsibility 
and i d appreciate
a yes or no answer 
yes  senator 
absolutely 
office of the chief of staff 
mr  mcdonough is
in a meeting right now 
according to the latest nbc
news wall street journal poll 
the president s
approval rating is at 44  
that s up three points since march   
excuse me  mr  mcdonough 
  director brennan is here 
  oh 
there he is 
  congratulations  mr  director 
  thank you 
welcome  come on in 
thank you 
thank you
and thank president obama 
i ll let him know 
speaking of  uh 
he wanted me to ask you
if there s any new information
on the drone strikes
of april 29th 
we can confirm
that the al qaeda planner
abu sulayman al jazairi
has been killed 
unfortunately  we also believe
that there were between five
and ten civilian casualties 
shit 
well  i ll let
the president know 
what about the
intelligence committee report 
we need to talk about that 
john  w we gave the cia
until february
to come up with its response 
it s now may 
i ve got senator feinstein
all over my phone sheet 
i don t want to be the one
who has to push on this 
but the president would really
like to get this behind us 
and 
we acknowledge that
the detention and interrogation
program had shortcomings
and that the agency
made mistakes 
the most serious of those
occurred early on
and stemmed from the fact
that we were unprepared 
now  as you know  we part ways
on some key points 
according to our review 
indications are that
interrogations of
detainees upon whom
the enhanced interrogation
techniques were used
did produce unique intelligence
that helped
thwart attack plans 
capture terrorists 
and saved lives 
excuse me  intelligence
gathered from eits   
and that intelligence
continues to inform
our counterterrorism efforts 
it led us to bin laden 
now  it s one thing
to disapprove of the program 
i i welcome that conversation 
but it s something else
altogether
to say that it was
mismanaged and ineffective 
excuse me  director brennan 
the report is
based on cia records 
cia officers themselves
called it ineffective 
cia officers 
well  you didn t speak to any
cia officers in the program 
did you  dan 
your lawyers would not
make them available to us
because of the department
of justice s criminal inquiry 
we also disagree with
the study s characterization of
how the cia briefed congress 
the white house and the press 
now  we have documentation
that certainly proves that 
excuse me  sir  what documents 
if the director is referencing
cables or e mails
we were never shown 
then that s a violation
of our agreement 
everything was supposed
to have been provided to us 
do we just give
the committee access
to the entire
cia computer system 
is that where this goes 
dan gets to read every e mail 
gets to see every document 
every relevant document
or e mail  yes 
i have always supported
the intelligence community 
i broke with my own party
to support the drone program 
but what this report
makes very clear
is a real need for oversight
and accountability 
you asked for our response 
and we gave it to you 
we looked in the mirror 
now  uh  we made mistakes 
there were abuses  and those
abuses have been addressed 
but i i vehemently disagree
with the narrative
that you re trying
to string together here 
it lacks context 
it does not paint
an accurate picture
of the work that was done 
let s go 
senator  john brennan s
name is in that report 
he was director tenet s
chief of staff
and then
deputy executive director
when the program started 
  he grew up at the agency 
  he claims to have
  spoken out against the eit program   
  where 
i just spent five years
looking at their e mails 
i never found anything
to suggest that s true 
well  we knew
this wasn t going to be easy 
they have their own narrative 
and they re gonna stick to it 
maybe we could come up
with some middle ground 
  find some common language 
  i thought our job
was to provide oversight
and accountability 
not middle ground 
i have a question for you 
do you work for me
or for the report 
and i d encourage you to think
about that before answering 
mcdonough 
dan 
dan jones 
there he is 
look at you  chief investigator
of the largest study
the senate s ever conducted 
my god  how you doing 
it s good to see you
in the fresh air 
  yeah 
  it s so funny 
i was just thinking
the other night 
do you remember that time
you came and saw me 
right after
you got out of school 
you said go get
intel experience 
wait till the dems
got the senate back 
and look at you now 
working for the
senate intelligence committee
for dianne feinstein 
you told me once you wanted
to make a difference 
i hope you still
get that chance 
  what does that mean 
  what does that mean 
it means  dan  get out of the
senator s head about the cia 
you re not doing yourself
any favors 
have you read the report 
it s 7 000 pages  dan 
the bible tells the history
of mankind in less than that 
look  buddy 
we re gonna get the cia
to sit down with you 
tell you
their side of the story 
it would help
if you would listen 
the study seems
to most seriously diverge
from the facts by asking
the reader to believe
the cia withheld information
from the executive branch
and congress 
we d like to see that
removed from the report 
after the photos of
abu ghraib came out in 2004 
deputy director mclaughlin
appeared before congress 
in front of you  and said
the cia is not authorized
to do anything like what
you ve seen in those photos 
but what they were doing
was even worse 
then in 2005 
senator rockefeller
called for a review
of the program 
and the deputy chief
of counterterrorism
got nervous
where that might lead 
so he sent a message
to senior leadership
discussing the need
to manage the situation 
he said   we either get out
and sell  or we get hammered 
congress reads it 
cuts our authorities 
messes up our budget 
we need to make sure
the impression of
what we do is positive  
this is the deputy chief
of counterterrorism 
that all stays in 
we fundamentally disagree
with the assertion
that the program was
poorly managed and executed
and that unqualified officers
imposed brutal conditions 
used unapproved techniques  and
were rarely held accountable 
what about mitchell and jessen 
mitchell s phd thesis
was on diet and exercise
for controlling hypertension 
jessen s dissertation
was on family therapy 
something called
family sculpting 
where you make clay figures
of your family members 
  no  how much were they paid 
  they had no experience
in real world interrogations 
no science
to back up their claims 
they were allowed to assess
the effectiveness
of their own program
without providing
any scientific evidence 
how much in total
did the u s  taxpayers
give them for their work 
over  80 million 
the agency also disagrees that
the detention and interrogation
program did not produce
unique intelligence
that disrupted plots
and saved lives 
for instance 
the identity of josé padilla 
the  dirty bomber  
if we hadn t stopped padilla 
this entire area
would be radioactive today 
josé padilla 
padilla found the instructions
for his dirty bomb online 
in in an article entitled
 making and owning an h bomb
is the kind of challenge
real americans seek  
it says 
 fill two buckets with uranium
and swing them above your head
as fast as possible  
it was a joke 
as far as we can tell 
everything they attribute
to eits they already had 
from other sources 
from foreign governments 
from other methods 
they claim they saved lives 
but what they really did
was make it impossible
to prosecute
a mass murderer like ksm 
because if what we did to him
ever came out in a court
of law  the case is over 
the guy planned 9 11 
and instead of going to jail
for the rest of his life 
the cia turned him into
a recruiting tool
for a war we re still fighting 
stop meeting with them 
this is a remarkable document
you ve created 
truly 
it will provide
an enduring history 
whether it comes out or not 
what does that mean   w whether
it comes out or not  
what does she mean 
what does that mean 
we ve been working on this
thing for nearly five years 
yes  and it is still
our word against theirs 
she s gonna need
more than that 
this is jones 
hey  dan  this is evan tanner 
um  i hear rumors the report
might not be coming out now 
a lot of pushback
from the agency 
  they re calling it  flawed  
  who told you that 
dan  i m the
national security reporter
for the new york times 
do you have any thoughts 
it s not
my place to talk about rumors 
no  i didn t think you would 
i was wondering
if you might want to comment 
uh  it can be off the record 
i just think we can
help each other here 
you know i can t do that 
and here s what we know
about caroline krass 
20 years
in the executive branch 
including the
office of legal counsel
where she worked with john yoo 
guys  this
confirmation s a done deal 
we re not gonna stop it 
but it is a public hearing 
and it just seems like
there s an opportunity
to say something 
wh what are you
looking for  senator 
i don t know  something
to move the study forward 
to break us
out of this stalemate 
any ideas 
senator  there is a document 
you ever sleep  bro 
i used to 
got in the way of work 
anything in that bag contain
the real names of cia officers 
assets or partners 
or any information
that would be in violation
of the agreement between
the central intelligence agency
and the united states senate 
  have a good night  jay 
  you  too  dan 
the committee
will come to order 
today  we are gathered
for the confirmation hearing
of caroline krass to be
general counsel of the cia 
welcome  ms  krass 
i m honored to be here
before the committee 
and i d like to take this
moment to acknowledge my family
and thank them
for their support 
thank you 
uh  before we begin 
i would like to remind members
not to discuss
classified topics
or ask questions which require
a classified answer 
with that said 
i turn to senator udall 
ms  krass 
nice to see you again 
we had a chance
to sit down last week
and discuss the senate s study
on the detention
and interrogation program 
you told me you found the study
to be hard reading 
also  last week 
a number of articles appeared
discussing
the one year anniversary
of the vote to approve
the committee s study 
and in one of those articles 
the cia claimed to have found
significant errors 
now  i got to tell you  i don t
believe that is accurate 
in fact 
i m more confident than ever
in the factual accuracy
of the committee s study 
i want to say that again 
i m more confident than ever 
it appears that the cia
performed their own study
of the eit program  initiated
by former director panetta 
and the findings
in that review
are entirely consistent
with our committee s report 
but amazingly conflicts with
the cia s official response
to that report 
so  why is a review
the cia conducted internally 
and never revealed to congress 
so different from
the cia s formal response
to the committee s report 
do you have an answer for that 
um  not at this time 
if i wanted the public to know
about the panetta review 
i would have told them myself 
we hear that the republicans
are gonna censure udall
for that performance 
but the review
proves our point 
they found
the same things we did 
the agency didn t know
how or where to hold people 
didn t know
how to interrogate people 
and  more importantly 
the cia did give it to us 
i don t know
if it was an accident
or it was a whistle blower 
well  if it was
a whistle blower 
you may have just exposed them 
not to mention yourself 
we got something here 
the director
has asked me here today
in my capacity
as agency legal counsel 
what we have to discuss
has serious implications 
all right 
we have proof that the staff
of the senate
intelligence committee
illegally gained access
to the cia s computer network
and obtained
classified documents 
what kind of proof 
we found the document
in question
on daniel jones s computer 
we did not provide it to him
or to the committee 
if he didn t hack us 
how did it get there 
we feel that jones and his team
need to be disciplined 
immediate dismissal
is in order 
at a minimum  i would think 
john  are you saying that you
broke into the computer system
of the united states senate 
we never gave you clearance
on that document 
it was classified  yet
you chose to make it public 
we ve made our investigation
and our findings
known to the white house 
you re fucking kidding me 
they re saying i broke into
the most top secret
computer system in the world 
  brennan and eastman came over   
  eastman 
eastman s name is in the report
over a thousand times 
  that s not a conflict 
  dan 
they filed a criminal referral
against you 
they want you gone 
h how did the agency
come to the conclusion
that i m a hacker 
h how do they even know
what s on my computer 
they say
they conducted a search 
of the united states senate 
the whole reason
this committee was established
in the first place
was to stop the cia
from spying on u s  citizens 
the senator is talking
to harry reid about
  that very thing   
  did they go into that room 
that room is off limits  did
they go into that fucking room 
i don t know 
i don t know 
i do know that the republicans
are gonna run with this 
they re gonna use it
to discredit the report 
they re gonna
use it to discredit you 
dan  they re accusing you
of breaking the law 
you re gonna need a lawyer 
there s a saying at the agency 
 admit nothing 
deny everything 
make counteraccusations  
that s what they re doing 
the cia is
investigating you for   
they re the ones who
should be investigated  not me 
mr  jones 
mr  clifford will see you now 
our computer system
isn t even connected
to the cia mainframe 
so did i just
go over to langley
and break in on a weekend 
seems unlikely 
so what evidence do they have 
a document 
a document 
what kind of a document 
i can t tell you that 
because  what  it s classified 
i was tasked
to lead an investigation
into a cia program
they started after 9 11 
what they called
enhanced interrogation 
and i assume your work
is critical of the agency 
you know  dan  a lot of people
in this country
felt the cia was
justified in doing
whatever they had to do
to keep us safe 
i have friends
who lost people that day 
and a lot of people watch 24
on thursday nights
and hear jack bauer say 
 i don t want to bypass
the constitution 
but these are
extraordinary circumstances  
just before  you know 
he s sticks a knife in them
and makes them give up a plot 
it it doesn t work that way 
well  as
winston churchill said 
 history is written
by the victors  
churchill didn t really
say that  hermann goring did 
and what he said was 
 we will go down in history
either as the world s
greatest statesmen
or its worst villains  
so your report is
gonna determine that 
statesmen or villains 
how long have you been
working on this project  dan 
five years 
five years 
and it could all go away 
just vanish in the face
of these allegations 
i can certainly imagine
an ambitious young man
like yourself spends years
with his head buried
in some terrible spectacle 
gets frustrated
with the process 
sees an opportunity
to get the truth out faster 
maybe crosses a line 
i m assuming this is
the most important thing
  you ve ever been a part of 
  i didn t do it 
or i can see
an equally ambitious senator
encouraging you
to do something 
now would be
a good time to tell me 
that did not happen 
what i did  i did on my own 
i acted alone 
  so you did steal the document 
  i did not steal it 
  you needed it to   
  i relocated it 
i put it in a safe 
if they had a way
of destroying tapes 
  then surely they could get   
  everyone has their own words 
the language is built
to choose sides 
now  why did you relocate it 
documents had a way of
disappearing off the server 
for instance  in 2010 
over 800 documents
just vanished
without any explanation 
so you had computer issues
all along 
who else knew
what was on the computers 
well  the cia hired an outside
firm to vet the documents 
centra 
and caci was also involved 
  who are they 
  contractors 
but jim pavitt
is on their board 
former deputy director
of operations for the cia 
jim pavitt  during the program 
jim pavitt 
and is he named in the report 
can t tell me 
so they can t destroy
the document 
then they can go after
the next best thing  you 
make you a zealot 
anything you touch is tainted 
i could see the agency saying
that this is a violation
of the espionage act  the   
computer fraud and abuse act 
uh  who knows what else 
and if they file
a charge against me 
how long could i go away for 
i don t know 
20 years  maybe more 
i did not hack into
the cia computer system 
i mean  my com    my computer
skills stop at microsoft word 
they probably know that 
let me ask you something 
how much does
a senate staffer make 
at my level 
about about a hundred grand 
any retirement  savings 
family money 
no 
so  we should discuss
my retainer 
  how much is that 
   30 000 to start 
and if it goes to trial 
add a zero 
nothing could make them happier
than knowing you re
sitting here talking to me 
that s what they want  dan 
make you bleed money
all over my floor 
do you want my expert opinion 
for free 
you don t really have
a legal problem 
you have a sunlight problem 
i m sure you know people
who can help you solve it 
daniel jones 
i didn t think
you d ever return my calls 
does your boss know
you re talking to
a guy with a byline
and a tape recorder 
there s something going on
i think you should look into 
it involves the agency 
okay  is it that report
you ve been working on 
the one that
never quite comes out 
computers  it has to do with
the hacking of computers 
all right  whose 
the united states senate 
someone hacked into the senate 
no shit  okay 
you have any idea if it was
foreign or domestic 
uh  all right  yes  you   
sorry  you said
it was the agency 
so what what does the cia
have to do with
u s  senate computers 
evan  you re the
national security reporter
for the new york times 
you can figure it out 
all right 
hmm 
morning  senator 
you wanted to see me 
you know anything about this 
 computer searches at center
of dispute on cia detentions  
you have any idea
how that ended up
  in the new york times 
  yeah  i saw that 
it looks accurate 
senator mccain is already
calling the cia a rogue agency 
what are your thoughts on
someone like
edward snowden  dan 
w well  senator  i know
how you feel about leaks 
i think he s a traitor 
plain and simple 
it s my job
to provide oversight
with the tools of governance 
not lights and cameras
and headlines 
do you want me to resign 
no 
but i think i might need you
to write me a speech 
senator feinstein claimed today
on the senate floor
that the cia hacked
the senate intelligence
committee s computers
to thwart an investigation
into past practices 
can you respond to that 
well  first 
we in no way  shape or form
tried to thwart
the release of the report 
uh  we want that behind us 
as far as this allegation
that the cia
somehow hacked into
the senate computer system 
nothing could be
further from the truth 
we just wouldn t do that 
it s beyond
the scope of reason 
thank you 
i understand
your position  senator 
and i am aware of
director brennan s comments 
did you hear what lindsey
graham said this morning 
about the agency
breaking into our computers 
 the legislative branch
should declare war on the cia 
heads should roll 
people should go to jail  
is that what you want 
send people to jail 
we do have jails for a reason 
the justice department
investigated the cia 
and they decided
not to prosecute 
it s their call  not ours 
now  when this administration
took office 
we faced
the very real possibility
of economic collapse 
we had a decision to make 
do we spend our political
capital on going around
trying to find people to blame 
or do we solve the problem 
maybe the way
to solve the problem
is to hold people accountable 
do you ever wonder
why history repeats itself 
well  i think
maybe it s because
we don t always listen
the first time 
senator  the people at the
agency    they have families 
there are children
who might lose a parent 
years ago  some radical group
put a bomb in the flower box
outside of my daughter s
bedroom window  right out here 
had it been any warmer out 
it would have exploded 
and then there was the time
that i found harvey milk
shot to death in his office 
i i think i m aware of
the risks of public service 
president obama
ended the torture program
three days after taking office 
the eits  what the cia did   
that is not our mess 
no  it s not 
but that s not the question
we re asking  is it 
the question we re asking is 
who is going to clean it up 
so let s do that 
right after director brennan
apologizes to me and my staff 
the inspector general is here 
go ahead in 
in regards to the cia
search of senate computers 
we ve looked into the matter
and have recommended
that the department of justice
begin a criminal investigation 
good 
so have we 
dan jones 
lead senate investigator 
not the senate staff 
the cia 
us 
are are you accusing me or
my staff of breaking the law 
my understanding is
that five cia employees
entered a room
that was off limits 
on whose orders 
senator feinstein
is right to call this
a violation of
the separation of powers 
the cia cannot spy
on the u s  congress 
as inspector general 
i m gonna have to launch
a full investigation
into the agency s actions 
am i going to jail 
no  they re
dropping the charges 
you re going back to work 
take the most important
findings  finish the summary   
no more than 400 pages 
i m going to ask the committee
to vote to release it 
mcdonough 
so  you saw they voted 
11 to three 
they want to release
an executive summary 
that thing goes out 
it puts my people in danger 
who are out there
in a dangerous world today 
trying to do their jobs 
pulls the rug
out from under them 
anything that you feel
puts your people in harm s way
stays classified 
my concern is this 
if if the senate puts out
a small pile of pages
and the press goes nuts 
then everybody s gonna want
to see a bigger pile of pages 
you keep saying the president
wants to turn the page 
well  then turn the page 
close the damn book 
senator feinstein
has asked the white house
to head up final comments
and redactions 
she wants us
right in the middle of it 
and 
and i think that s exactly
where you want us 
you ll have the pen 
leadership specified
that we should redact
anything that could result in
legal exposure
for officers in the field 
past or present 
basically  if there s
any questions  black it out 
you see this 
what the   
fuck is this 
good afternoon  where s marcy 
conference room 
early the next week 
wednesday 
yeah  that ll work 
and you get me the agenda 
thank you 
imagine you pick up a book 
and  blank  turns water
into wine on page 237 
and on page 71
 blank  heals a leper 
and on page 295
 blank  rises from the dead 
how do you know the blanks
are all the same person 
i thought that the cia
agreed to using pseudonyms 
they did  but now even
the fake names are gone 
and the dates 
the entire story is gone 
i hope you took
your strong pills today 
mcdonough  isn t it enough
to know what actually happened 
do we need to know the names
of the people involved 
but the actual names
aren t in the report 
someone could figure out
who our people are
based on their pseudonyms 
you know  i found
a photo of my husband
on the internet
linking him to me 
secrecy is very hard
to maintain 
i believe you introduced
your husband publicly
at your confirmation hearing 
it was on c span 
some of these people   
they are out there
in the world  right now 
yes  they are 
there s an officer
from alec station
mentioned 41 times
in 500 pages 
in 1998  her team
missed the bombing
of the u s  embassy
in kenya and tanzania 
1999  they missed the bombing
of the marriott hotel
in islamabad 
in 2000  she was made aware
of two al qaeda operatives
who arrived in los angeles 
fbi officers  working within
the bin laden unit 
requested permission
to investigate 
that s not how
we want to play it 
the cia knew
they were on american soil
and didn t do anything 
al mihdhar then left the states
to play a key role
in the bombing of the uss cole 
before returning to hijack
flight 77 with al hazmi
and crash into the pentagon 
and you want to
protect this person s identity 
we d also like to redact
the pseudonyms
of the contractors 
dr  mitchell was already quoted
by name in the new yorker 
he was handing out brochures
at professional conferences
telling people
he worked for the cia 
if we are protecting
the identities of cia staff 
we need to protect
our contractors as well 
mitchell and jessen were given
a contract by the agency
for a program that didn t work 
the cia also agreed
to a five million dollar
indemnification clause
for their company that covered 
among other expenses 
criminal prosecution 
you know  i kept
the rag we used on ksm 
you should ebay that bad boy
when this is all over 
make a mint 
an internal cia memo concluded
that mitchell and jessen  have
both shown blatant disregard
for the ethics shared by almost
all of their colleagues  
the pseudonyms for
the contractors need to stay 
mcdonough  guys  we ve been
at this for months 
what about the
locations of the black sites 
the country names 
we made commitments
to those countries
to maintain their secrecy 
no country names 
not open to negotiating
these points 
we need to consider
the morale of the cia here 
now  we we publish this report 
  there s a very good chance we could lose them 
  lose them 
what does that mean 
what about the morale
of all the people at the agency
who spoke out
against the program 
what about them 
people who sent cables back
from black sites
saying they wanted
to be transferred
because they were disgusted by
what was being done 
all right  uh  look 
we have   
dan more than anyone   
have worked to uncover
the truth about this
when no one else would 
we will not allow this
to be covered up
by the executive branch 
president obama
called it torture 
bush and cheney
wouldn t do that 
he signed an executive order
getting rid of it 
now  just imagine  god forbid 
there s another
terrorist attack on our watch 
there won t be another democrat
in the white house
for 20 years 
i d also like
to talk about the redactions
concerning ksm 
cory gardner 
the republican challenger 
will be the next
united states senator
from the state of colorado 
defeating the democratic
incumbent  mark udall 
a major  major win
for the republicans 
chris frates is standing by
in colorado 
this is huge
for  uh  colorado  wolf 
this is the first time
a republican has won
the senate race state wide
in colorado since 2002 
big night for colorado 
and a big night for control
of the united states senate 
she s expecting you 
so  i just got a call
from secretary of state kerry 
he thinks that 
with the release of the report 
that the coalition against isil
could collapse 
isn t that a bit convenient 
  he calls you just before   
  dan 
wh where did kerry get
his intel on this  the cia 
  is it credible 
  embassies could be attacked 
hostages could be killed 
it s just another stall tactic 
he suggested giving the report
to the president 
so that it could be released
later  when hostilities cease 
you lose control of the
committee in a week  senator 
yes  i am aware of what happens
when the republicans
are in the majority  dan 
look  i want to get this report
out as much as anyone 
but i have known him
a long time 
i tend to believe him 
nobody else is gonna
tell this story 
  dan  the senator has a luncheon 
  if we stop now 
aren t we a part
of the cover up 
strong pills  senator 
i think you should go home
and get some rest 
you look tired 
marcy  if i could
have five minutes 
of course 
did you ever meet a guy
called greg craig 
just in pa    white house
counsel when obama took office 
  just in passing 
  right 
so  right after he got elected 
the president asked craig
to come up with a plan
to deal with
the aftermath
of the torture program 
so  he got secretary of defense
gates  janet napolitano 
hillary clinton   
serious people    in a room 
and he asked for
their recommendation 
  and 
  a and the consensus
was that the president
should appoint
an independent
bipartisan commission
into interrogations
and detainee treatment 
like a deep dive into
what worked and what didn t
and    who was responsible 
you know  like what they did
after 9 11 
and like what you ve been
trying to do 
so why didn t they do that 
well  evidently 
the president listened closely
to the recommendation 
he then thought about it 
and then he said no 
he d spent an entire campaign
saying he was post partisan 
so going after
the bush administration
flew in the face of all that 
and right then  everyone in
that room changed their minds 
they sided with the president 
no independent commission 
everyone except craig 
because he thought
it was too important 
you couldn t just
torture people 
lie about it 
and then hide it from history 
a few months later 
craig was gone 
and this mess
wound up with the senate 
and you 
well  the president must have
known that  by doing that 
he was making it
next to impossible 
uh  he came from the senate 
dan  they sent you off
to build a boat 
but they had no intention
of sailing it 
they probably didn t think
you d get as far as you did 
let me ask you a question 
if the cia knew
that torture didn t work 
why did they continue to do it 
after 9 11 
everyone was scared   
   scared it might
happen again 
and the cia would be blamed
if it did 
or maybe they were ashamed 
you know  how come
the most sophisticated
intelligence organization
on earth
couldn t keep
its own people safe 
but fear and shame don t make
for better policy decisions 
and the fact that
the people who we captured
didn t look like us or
believe the same things we do
made it that much easier
to do the things we did 
so once
the cia program started 
they had to keep
telling people it worked 
even if it wasn t true 
their own position was that
if it didn t work 
it was illegal 
so they misrepresented
the results 
if we had your report 
we would print it tomorrow 
all of it 
the senator said
she would release
  a summary of the report 
  really 
over the objections of the cia
and the white house 
you really think
that s gonna happen 
if i gave it to you 
what would happen 
some people will think
you re a hero 
and some will probably think
you re a traitor 
look at edward snowden 
no  if it s gonna come out 
it s gonna come out
the right way 
what if it doesn t 
then i didn t do my job 
i m sorry 
sorry 
mcdonough  so  with
the affordable care act
behind us  the president
would like to begin
a serious discussion
about immigration reform 
now  obviously
we ve had some setbacks
in both the house
and the senate 
uh  so strategy has become
paramount    unity as well 
so  we would like to  uh 
really start talking about   
excuse me  mr  mcdonough 
i would like to discuss
the report on the cia
and the white house s position 
that s not the topic
of this particular caucus 
uh  the president
would like to discuss   
our country
did things the nazis did 
things that made us
condemn other regimes 
and the position
of this administration
is to suppress
this information 
to keep the people
who did these things safe 
i can assure you that is not
the position of
this administration  senator 
you worked with john brennan
at the
national security council 
now  i understand that brennan
gave this president
his first security briefing
when he took office 
and now cia director brennan
is working closely with the
president on the drone program 
you know  it s funny 
every time
i go over to the cia 
they claim i m doing
the senate s bidding 
and every time i come here 
you claim i m doing
the cia s bidding 
i only have a few days left
in my term here 
and if there isn t a plan to
release the report before i go 
i m prepared to read it
on the floor of the senate 
and either the white house
or the republicans
will have to stop me 
mcdonough 
what would you have us do 
now  we go after
bush and cheney on this 
what s to prevent
the republicans
from coming back at us and
trying to repeal health care 
uh  we go after the cia 
uh  maybe they say 
 okay  well  immigration reform
is off the table  
maybe it s gun control 
now  democracy is messy   
but let s just think
how many countries
there are in the world
where a report like this
could even get done 
i would like us to be more than
the country
that did the report 
i d like us to be the country
that made it public 
and that is what i intend
to see happen 
i yield the floor
to the senior senator
from california 
over the past six years 
a small team of investigators
pored over more than
6 3 million pages
of cia records
to complete this report 
it shows that
the cia s actions a decade ago
are a stain on our values
and on our history 
the release of
this 500 page summary
cannot remove that stain 
but it can and does say
to our people and the world
that america is big enough
to admit when it s wrong
and confident enough
to learn from its mistakes 
releasing this report is
an important step toward
restoring our values
and showing the world
that we are  in fact 
a just and lawful society 
there are those who will
seize upon the report and say 
 see what the americans did  
and they will try to use it
to justify evil actions
or to incite more violence 
we cannot prevent that 
but history will judge us
by our commitment to
a just society governed by law
and the willingness
to face an ugly truth
and say  never again  
thank you 
i now yield the floor
to the senator from arizona 
john mccain 
what might come as a surprise
is how little these practices
did to aid our efforts to bring
9 11 culprits to justice
and to find and prevent
terrorist attacks
today and tomorrow 
that could be a real surprise 
since it contradicts
the many assurances
provided by
intelligence officials 
on the record and in private 
that enhanced interrogation
techniques were indispensable
in the war against terrorism 
i think it s an insult to
the many intelligence officers
who have acquired
good intelligence
without hurting
or degrading prisoners
to assert we can t win this war
without such methods 
yes  we can  and we will 
but in the end 
torture s failure to serve
its intended purpose
isn t the main reason
to oppose its use 
this question isn t about
our enemies  it s about us 
it s about who we were  who we
are  and who we aspire to be 
it s about how we represent
ourselves to the world 
our enemies act
without conscience 
we must not 
senator dianne feinstein today
exposed the cia s now extinct
enhanced interrogation
techniques 
the thing that strikes me about
what the senate
was doing today   
dianne feinstein 
jay rockefeller   
is they were doing
everything they can
to make sure
this doesn t happen again 
because by going public
like this   
dan 
you did well 
thank you 
thank you 
 we re gonna be on you
if you try to do this
