five years
five wow
every day nights weekends
its been very consuming
do you have
a relationship dan family
just trying to get
a better sense of who you are
when it started i was
seeing someone but you know
with the nature of the work
and the hours
i wasnt a very good partner
five years
and it could all go away
just vanish in the face
of these allegations
i can certainly imagine
an ambitious young man
like yourself
spends years
with his head buried
in some terrible spectacle
gets frustrated
with the process
sees an opportunity
to get the truth out faster
maybe crosses a line
im assuming this is
the most important thing
youve ever been a part of
i didnt do it
or i can see
an equally ambitious senator
encouraging you
to do something
now would be
a good time to tell me
that did not happen
what i did i did on my own
i acted alone
you ever sleep bro
i used to got in the way of work
anything in that bag
contain the real names
of cia officers
assets or partners
or any information
that would be in violation
of the agreement between
the central intelligence agency
and the united states senate
have a good night jay
you too dan
so you did steal the document
i did not steal it
i relocated it
everyone has their own words
the language is built
to choose sides
now why did you relocate it
they could send you
to jail dan
i think i should
start at the beginning
mcdonough you dan jones
yeah
denis mcdonough
hi
thank you so much
for meeting me
come on in yeah
absolutely
so thanks for coming in
uh tell me your story
my second day of grad school
was september 11th
i was headed to a lecture
and everything just stopped
the next day i changed all my
classes to national security
good man
so whats the longterm plan
where do you see yourself
in ten years
are you running for office
oh uh no
no politics for me
i think id be more effective
behind the scenes
somewhere i can
really make a difference
so what about before harvard
uh whatd you fill up
your days with then
teach for america
for three years in baltimore
seventhgraders
i read that you taught
high school spanish
in saint paul minnesota
after college
and lbjs first job
was teaching
at the mexican school
in south texas
knowing how
to deal with children
is a highly useful skill
when working on the hill
but from my perspective
as senate staff
i would wait until
things turn around up here
i think senator daschle
would say the same thing
go get some realworld
experience in counterterrorism
in foreign policy
try the cia try fbi
have them teach you what they
dont teach you in a classroom
then you can come back here and
help us fix all the things that
bush and cheney are breaking
mcdonough
yes senator uh one second
the boss here
keep in touch huh
thank you very much for your time
absolutely
mcdonough i do not have
that information right now
but i can certainly get that
for you in the next 15
yeah
in regards to
the bomb plots in germany
three men were arrested
in medebach
with 1500 pounds
of hydrogen peroxide
and 26 militarygrade
detonators
the cia suspects
the islamic jihad union
excuse me
uh can i borrow you
for a minute dan
uh senator would
like to see you
yeah of course
morning dan
morning senator
have you seen the story today
in the new york times
no senator i have not
evidently the cia destroyed
tapes of interrogations
of al qaeda detainees
did the intel committee know
there were tapes
no this is the first
ive heard of it
so i want to find out
what was on the tapes
and why they were destroyed
we want you to lead
the investigation dan
but if the tapes were
destroyed how do we
theyre saying
they have written records
thousands of pages
lets see about that
i want you to find out
exactly what they have
and read every word of it
this report on the
destruction of tapes by the cia
has been two years in the making
thank you
the findings
are very troubling
but it will remain classified
based on these revelations
a larger study into
the entire cia detention
and interrogation program
is clearly in order
all in favor say yay
mr whitehouse
yay
mr burr
yay
mr rockefeller
yay
mr chambliss
nay
mr risch
i think
this is a waste of time
now i know you voted
against this saxby
but you already had
your tapes investigation
yes but the rest of us
voted to go further 14 to one
its our job
to provide oversight
all during the campaign
you got candidate obama saying
how he wanted to be the first
postpartisan president
saxby you know me
its my intention
that this report be seen
as coming from the entire
intelligence committee
not just the democrats
so who takes the lead
well i was thinking dan jones
he spent four years doing
counterterrorism at the fbi
hes already got
the security clearances
the rules are the same
as the tapes investigation
no politics no bias
and the senator
isnt interested
in opinions or theories
just facts
based on what
you found out already
this could go to
a pretty dark place
you need to keep your
personal feelings out of it
thats the first thing
republicans are gonna look for
no talking to the press
or your girlfriend
or any family members
nobody outside of
the committee
youre gonna get
a team of six
three republicans
three democrats
but there cant be
any republican sentences
or democratic paragraphs
and how long do we have
were hoping you can
wrap it up in a year or so
youre gonna have to keep the
senators updated on your work
nobody wants any surprises
theres a covert cia offsite
in virginia
you start tomorrow
jones right
sean
hi dan
sean murphy from the agency
lets go inside
okay
identification gentlemen
the room weve designated is a scif
no phone reception no photos
you know the drill
lead walls
and per the agreement
the room is offlimits
to everyone
except committee personnel
absolutely
no one inside
without your permission
and the computers
right here
your own dedicated server
airgapped workstations
well be updating
the database as we go
the files will be loaded
on here as we collect them
from across the agency
great
well want all relevant
documents as soon as possible
well we got to vet it first
vet
theres a lot to
director panetta
agreed to give us
everything pertaining
to the program
whwho would be
who would be vetting it
its a big agency
we got to make sure
you dont get anything
youre not supposed to
make yourself at home
theres no printer
no paper
no documents are allowed
to leave the room
without cia approval
paper has a way of getting
people in trouble at our place
i think at some point
were gonna need a printer
and paper
at our place
papers how
we keep track of laws
okay
calling this
an obvious terrorist attack
based on very
preliminary information
the information that
intelligence officials
are getting
youre not gonna like this
a possible
hijacked plane and of course
thethe very horrifying video
of the plane
we confirmed some of the names
the hijackers
two of the guys from
the malaysia meetings
the san diego guys
they took down flight 77
pentagon
the coordination
that took place
to have two planes
hit the towers
attention everyone please
we have reason to believe
the counterterrorism center
is a potential target
were asking all personnel
to evacuate immediately
jim miklaszewski
there from the pentagon
of course the president
has the authority
to scramble
military uh forces
and uh this is a case
obviously
in which uh retaliation
if indeed it proves to be
a terrorist incident
will be contemplated
we also have to work though
sort of thethe dark side
if you will
weve got to spend time
in the shadows
inin the intelligence world
uh a lot of
what needs to be done here
will have to be done quietly
without any discussion
fucking warned them
august 6th
presidential briefing
bin ladin determined
to strike in us
flashing red lights
and before that
in july what did we say
there will be
significant terrorist attacks
against the united states in
the weeks and months to come
its not your fault
it is a mean nasty dangerous
uh dirty business out there
and we have to operate
in that arena
but we need to make certain
that we have not
tied the hands if you will
of our intelligence community
counterterrorism director black
and i saw president bush
at camp david this weekend
and the president gave me
his word that there will be
no changes in cia leadership as
a result of tuesdays attacks
we will look forward now
not waste time secondguessing
or looking for blame
going forward we will be
the tip of the spear
in the battle against al qaeda
as i said
to the president two weeks
well have flies walking
across al qaeda eyeballs
ive asked chief counsel rizzo
here to walk us through
where we are from
a legal standpoint
the president has issued
a memorandum of notification
giving cia the power to capture
and detain suspected terrorists
on the battlefield
detain them where
are we bringing them
to the us
were really not
in the prison business
over in counterterrorism
look
the budget for counterterrorism
last week was what
600 million
the budget this week is
whatever you need it to be
and we are in whatever business
it takes to get the job done
initially cia legal
stated that any facility used
to hold detainees
had to meet the requirements
of the us bureau of prisons
but then deputy director pavitt
thought that was
gonna be too limiting
so who came up
with the black sites
not totally clear
my guess is either
a senior officer
at counterterr ctc
or alec station bin laden unit
decided black sites
were the best option
well did the cia
tell the state department
they were making deals
to hold people on foreign soil
where was secretary of state
powell in all this
well i found a memo
the cias general counsel
said the decision was made
not to tell powell
about the program
because
he would blow his stack
if he were to be briefed
on what was going on
well who decided that
someone inside the white house
mmhmm
what about interrogations
president bushs memoranda
just authorized
capturing and detaining
it didnt say anything
about interrogations
and who gave them permission
to play that role
nobody it looks like
it started with legal at ctc
do you want me to brief senator mccain
on this i know hes interested
the republicans just
pulled out of the study dan
good morning
where is everybody
attorney general holder
opened a criminal investigation
into the cia
as a result the agency
wont allow any of their people
to be interviewed
for our report
the republicans dont see
how we can move forward
so theyre out
so does this mean we stop
i mean the committee
voted to investigate
the senator says we keep going
but we cant actually talk
to anyone who was involved
in the program
right according to cia legal
cia personnel is
only speaking to doj
and is doj gonna
share their findings
i mean can we work with them
ive reached out
to the special prosecutor
im waiting to hear back
okay but if nobody who
actually worked on the program
is going to talk to us
how do we investigate
so we have the files
their emails and cables
their memos
we have to use
their own communications
to tell the story
do you have any idea
how hard thats gonna be
the tapes investigation
took two years dan
and this is about a lot more
than what was on the tapes
uh we dont even know
what this is
right but we do know
who it starts with
we go one detainee at a time
you speak english
my name is ali soufan
im with the fbi
youre under arrest
you understand
no where are you taking me
your wound is infected
but were going to
take good care of you
i want to show you something
hes talking to
someone offscreen
hes calling him mukhtar
you know who that is
mukhtar
a man who lost his mind
no not him
khalid sheikh mohammed
abu zubaydah confirmed
that ksm is the leader
of all al qaeda operations
outside of afghanistan
he trained the hijackers
were calling him
the mastermind
outstanding
hats off
to the bin laden group
whichever one of
your people did this
i want to call them and
congratulate them in person
who was it
wasnt our guy
what who got it
fbi is working zubaydah
an fbi guy got this
yes ali soufan
uh they used him
in the cole investigation
hes part of their counterterrorism group
he speaks arabic
i dont care who speaks arabic
this is not just
a criminal investigation
we are gathering
intelligence here
that is what we do
the fbi is looking at the past
we need to stop attacks
in the future
i want cia in the room
with this guy okay
i want cia
in the room with zubaydah
so who do we have
who can work on him
cia runs sources
people who cooperate
thats not these guys
every second we are not
draining the detainees brain
we are rolling the dice
we need our people in the room
we need to be the ones
asking the questions now
i heard from someone
over in technical services
a woman named miriam
about a couple of
air force psychologists
who came in and pitched a whole
new approach to interrogations
jim mitchell and bruce jessen
miriam says mitchell
has the special sauce
zubaydah didnt
tell us everything
because we stopped short
of where we needed to go
sere stands for survival
evasion resistance and escape
its a program to help prepare
us special forces
for whatever they might
encounter if captured
now i have over 14000 hours
observing sere
interrogation techniques
bruce here
has more than that
uh observing
as opposed to
i took a course in conducting
interrogations as well
i worked with volunteers
in actual simulations
we feel we can reverse engineer
these sere techniques
to induce learned helplessness
can you explain
what that means
reverse engineer
instead of using
these techniques
to protect our people
we use them to achieve
compliance in the detainees
our plan involves uh
using individual assessments
of detainees to create
a program designed to induce
debility dependency and dread
we call these the three ds
three ds
and theres science
to back this up
oh yes yes sir
excuse me dr mitchell
can you elaborate on uh the
techniques youll be employing
absolutely
the uh the attention grasp
walling
facial hold
the facial slap or insult slap
cramped confinement
wall standing
stress positions
sleep deprivation
waterboarding
use of insects
and mock burials
well from my perspective
this seems like it could be
a potential game changer
but of course
its up to director rodriguez
i think if were serious about
stopping the next threat
we need to put on
our big boy pants
and provide the authorities
these guys need
these approaches might
raise some eyebrows at defense
well were not at defense
were at the cia
besides you just said
we use this sere stuff
on our guys all the time
i dont see a problem
shortly after
the cias decision
to engage dr mitchell
abu zubaydah was moved
to a cell that was lit
24 hours a day
loud noise was fed into
his cell to disrupt his sleep
what about the guy
who got him talking
ali soufan
wait hes fbi not cia
so we can ask him
questions right
no rule against that
we can try
theres only
one interrogation technique
that works rapport building
you get close to these guys
and they open up
but the cia
didnt believe that
just look at abu zubaydah
well you got him to talk
howd you do that
i walked in one day and
played him a tape of himself
most of it was
of a phone conversation
uh we had tapped his phones
but he forgot to hang up
at the end of the call
so we had all this
background noise of his house
then my partner walked in
with a big box
full of cassette tapes
we told him we had bugged
his safe house
we had been listening
for months
we knew everything
so lying was pointless
he looked at
the box full of tapes and
and allall the tapes
were blank
of course they were
but he didnt know that
so he talked
uh what happened when
the contractors showed up
who the fuck is this
dr mitchell
is an air force psychologist
and hes developed
a new method of interrogation
whywhy do we need
a new method
hes not telling you
everything
we think he knows more
we put him at number three
or number four
in al qaeda leadership
he probably knows
the next move
do you speak arabic jim
does gary here
dont need to
ccan i ask you something
have you ever interrogated
any sort of extremist before
know much about al qaeda
no
have you ever interrogated
any sort of terrorist before
no
any sort of criminal
no
have you ever interrogated
anyone before
its not important
hes a human
im a psychologist
he knows a secret
and im gonna get him
to tell that secret to gary
whatwhat are you going
to do to him that isnt
what am i gonna do
what is jim gonna do
jims gonna do what works
lets go shitbird
move it asshole
help please
you cant just shave
a muslim man
do you know what that means
hes going to shut down
got to humiliate him
right off the bat
same reason
we took away his clothes
why the loud music
sleep deprivation
we stop the music
when he starts talking
then he can sleep
tired people tell the truth
learned helplessness
youre familiar with
dr martin seligman
seligman did
an experiment with dogs
he put them in a cage
with a barrier
running down the middle
and one side of the cage
was electrified
and the other wasnt
at first
when he shocked the dogs
theyd jump over the barrier
to get away
and then
he electrified both sides
there was no escape
no belief they could
change anything
hed open the door to the cage
they wouldnt even leave
its learned helplessness
thats what were
gonna instill in this man
youll see
a coffin
youre gonna kill him
lets call it
a confinement box
i got this one
and i got a smaller one
and youre gonna
put him in there
with these which based on
my evaluation he hates
are you out of your mind
we dont do this
you know this is
against the law
the most senior people
have signed off on it
were putting him on trial
how are we gonna build
a case against him
who says hes getting a trial
i wanted to arrest him
right there on the spot
i told the bureau that
whatd they say
they briefed director mueller
and told me to get the hell
out of there so i did
when was that
late may midmay or
cause im finding records
that say that mitchell left
a little while later
early june
for r  r and some meetings
at headquarters
but we had one
highvalue detainee in custody
abu zubaydah
and after mitchell left
the cia put him in isolation
and didnt ask him
a single question for 47 days
are you fucking kidding me
the whole country was
on red alert that summer
if they were so concerned
about the next attack
whyd they stop
asking questions
right it doesnt
make any sense
once the psychologist
showed up
almost nothing did anymore
the cia said
zubaydah was involved
in every major
terrorist operation
carried out by al qaeda
they told the president
he was number three or four
in the organization
yes that was
my understanding as well
and the claim that
zubaydah was a major player
was the main justification they
gave to the justice department
for needing to go harder
they were certain
he knew about the next attack
but last night i found this
turns out zubaydah wasnt three
or four in the organization
he wasnt part of
al qaeda leadership at all
they only had one source
calling him that
and that source later admitted
he was lying
so they exaggerated who he was
to the president
and the department of justice
in order to get legal approvals
for these new techniques
is that what youre saying
i think thats a possibility
the program
really starts with him
have you guys
used this thing before
the waterboard
no its a navy thing
but we watched a video
we tested it on each other
just to get a feel
for the experience
is it safe
yes
monarch to the kingdom
of the dead
who are
the operatives inside the us
i dont know
infamous
when is the next attack
i dont know
one two three four five
six seven eight nine
10 11
12 13 14
15 16 17 18
19 20 21 22
23 24 25 26
when is the next attack
who are the operatives
inside the us
anything in that bag
contain the real names
of cia officers
assets or partners
or any information that would
violate the agreement between
the central intelligence agency
and the united states senate
all good
all right good night
have a good night jay
get home safe
good night
dan jones
do i know you
no but i think i can help you
helphelp me with what
the eit program
thats what youre
looking into isnt it
i need to know
i wont be named anywhere
im still with the agency
my even being here with you
talking is
what was your involvement
office of medical services
black sites
so youre a doctor
physicians assistant
the american
medical association
wont allow doctors
to be involved
they take an oath do no harm
were the next best thing
i was there
when the contractors arrived
they made tapes of the
abu zubaydah interrogations
but theres a 21hour period
where the transcripts
are missing nothing
they were using the waterboard
zubaydah lost consciousness
he was choking to death
drowning
not just thinking
he was drowning
he was actually
fucking drowning
i was told that the waterboard
was only gonna be used
as a last resort
the contractors did
an assessment of the prisoner
and they made a call
what kind of assessment
ththey bounced him
off the walls a few times
and then strapped him down and
poured water down his throat
we understand this is
a different approach
but its based on science
science
oh come on what science
have you seen their science
they believe the waterboard
is working here
to create compliance
well of course they do
theyre the ones who get
to decide when its used
and theyre also the ones who
get to decide if its working
how is that even ethical
the people were dealing with
weaponized daily life
would you like to talk about
the ethics of that
were here to make sure
that nothing like that
ever happens again
theyre training their people
to resist
traditional interrogations
in the back of a cave
somewhere
so we need to change
our approach
before another bomb goes off
or another building falls down
okay okay
what is gonna happen when one
of our soldiers gets captured
and takes out a card with
the geneva convention on it
and wants to be treated
like a human being
you think his captors
arent gonna remember
the way these people
were treated here
and for what
do you have a kid at home
were not gonna get beat again
besides the chief of station
did you report your concerns
up the chain of command
we got a cable from
director rodriguez
telling us to stop putting
our objections in writing
no paper trail
i told them if they were gonna
keep using the new techniques
i wanted out
i wasnt the only one
guys were choking up
its all in the emails
as early as november 2001
the cias legal team
circulated a memorandum
describing
a novel legal defense
for their officers
who might engage in torture
come on they actually
called it torture
the cia
they just forgot
we have laws against that
yes sir
mitchell and jessen renamed it
enhanced interrogation
to help sell it
but the agency was
talking about doing it
before they even had
a single detainee
my question senator is
how did the cia know
they needed
to torture prisoners
before they even had one
that didnt come from
cheney and addington
seems like it happened
the other way around
the cia took it
to the bush white house
and john yoo at
the office of legal counsel
so heres where were at
the crime of torture
as described in section 2340
requires that the defendant
in this case an interrogator
intends to cause
severe pain or suffering
but in this case thats not
the interrogators intent
right the intent is to gain
intel save american lives
but john
what if the techniques
the interrogator employs
do nonetheless
cause pain and suffering
how do we deal with that
well the key phrase is
severe pain or suffering
but 2340 never actually defines
the term severe
we found this definition
in a medicare statute
severe pain or suffering
acute symptoms that place the
individual in serious jeopardy
and are hard to endure
meaning
to constitute torture
the damage done must rise
to the level of organ failure
impairment of bodily function
or death
so basically if someone dies
were doing it wrong
if the president
deemed it necessary
to crush the testicles
of a child
to stop a plane
from crashing into a building
to save american lives
there is no law or treaty
that could stop him
i can make
the same argument for
gouging out a prisoners eyes
or dousing him with acid
in our opinion
if it provides unique
intelligence that saves lives
and doesnt cause
any lasting harm
then its legal
for the president to order it
what do we mean
when we say unique
intelligence that couldnt have
been obtained any other way
and youve discussed
all of this
with the white house i assume
and
did they tell bush what
they were gonna do to zubaydah
no
and national security advisor rice
where was she in all this
national security advisor rice
was told about the program
but she was also told
the president
would not be briefed
who tells the presidents
national security advisor
not to brief the president
cheney and addington
according to cia records bush
wasnt told about the program
until april of 2006
four years later
and the records we found state
that when the president was
finally told about the program
he expressed discomfort
with the image of a detainee
chained to the ceiling
wearing a diaper
and forced to go
to the bathroom on himself
how long till you can
get this thing done dan
weve got to get this out
what about this guy
gul rahman
captured in peshawar
november 2002
hes not at gitmo
heshes not anywhere
gul rahman
gul
no they didnt tell
the committee about him
hes detainee number 24
hq says he knows
operational detail
about al qaeda
the guys an asshole
threw his food at us he
threatened to kill the guards
ive asked headquarters
to approve the application
of the enhanced measures
for this detainee
and the request
has been approved
oh great we havent had any luck loosening him up
mm
come on
ran him up and down the hall
beat the crap out of him
nothing
even been trying this thing
they call short shackling
chain a dudes hands
to a bolt on the floor
then you chain his feet
to the same bolt
farmers call it hogtying
i think
he finally admitted
to something
what was that
that he was who we said he was
gul rahman
what you want to do first is
take away his sense of control
if you like i could spend
some time showing you
how to achieve this
with the enhanced techniques
great
we got another 30 guys here
to deal with
i heard you told the doctor
you were cold
the beautiful people
the beautiful people
ah
the beautiful people
the beautiful people
ah
senator do you have
a few minutes this morning
absolutely come on in dan
the senator is
needed on the floor for a vote
uh give her five minutes
did you sleep last night dan
uh senator a prisoner died
theres no time
to discriminate
hate every motherfucker
thats in your
gul rahman
they thought he was maybe
working for an afghan warlord
or that he knew something
about an attack
did he
no he died before they found out
anything besides his name
dumped cold water on him
one night
and found him dead in his cell
in the morning
the autopsy said hypothermia
where did you get this from
inspector generals report
cia did their own investigation
into the death of gul rahman
the officer in charge
was recommended
for a performance bonus
they promoted him
hes still out there
in the field
well are you accusing the cia
of murder dan
because that sounds like
where this is going
we have proof
the deputy director
coached the officer in charge
how to cover up what happened
told him to be careful
what he put in writing
so why would they need
to cover it up
if they were following
standard operating procedure
why didnt they tell
the committee
why didnt they tell you
im gonna need to review
all this personally
its very disconcerting
disconcerting
very disconcerting
dan you need to be
careful here
youre getting
emotionally involved
they fucking killed a guy and
nobody was held accountable
wwe dont know
he was a terrorist
we barely even know his name
i understand
and what you need
to understand is that
her name is going
on this report not yours
senate staff doesnt
have to run for reelection
but she does
their legal argument said eits
wouldnt cause lasting harm
so how long is gul rahman
gonna be dead for
are you guys seeing
this panetta review
it just showed up
i dont understand
looks like the cia did
their own investigation
it confirms everything
weve been finding
so what are you
gonna do with it
hopefully nothing
special prosecutor durham
please
ive already left
several messages
its dan jones again from
the intelligence committee
how are you
good i just wanted
to check in again to see
if the special prosecutor
is available
to meet on the cia probe
it can be off the record
i just want to compare notes
yeah same number
thank you
you know we got to think back
to the period after 911
we didnt even know who hit us
we didnt know that
khalid sheikh mohammed was
the mastermind of 911
or the operational commander
of al qaeda
and then we started rounding up
these terrorists
we caught abu zubaydah
we caught uh
ramzi bin alshibh and ksm
and these guys provided us
information under questioning
by the cia that stopped
a number of terrorist attacks
they were plplanning
to blow up
the us consulate
in karachi pakistan
shit
they were planning to blow up
our marine camp in djibouti
good morning
khalid sheikh mohammed was
indicted in new york for trying
to blow up airplanes in 1995
the cia already knew about him
they knew he was close
to bin laden
they knew about him before
zubaydah ever identified him
how long have you been here
also according to this cable
a few hours
a cia officer in islamabad
began working someone
they call asset x
x claimed to have
direct access to ksm
but was eventually turned away
when he asked for money
how much money
few thousand bucks
two years later after
theyve been putting him off
putting him off putting him
off they finally pay him
and almost immediately
he sends a text
to his cia handler saying
im with ksm
it had nothing to do
with the waterboard
good morning
good morning
one two three
four five six
who are you
working with in the us
seven eight nine
10 11
we have your kids
12 13 14 15
yankee doodle keep it up
16 17
yankee doodle dandy
it will stop if you talk
and with the girls be handy
yankee doodle
where is the next attack
canary wharf canary wharf
stuck a feather in
his hat and called it
okay heres the problem
we already know about
the heathrow
and canary wharf plots
he knows that
its in his goddamn notebook
we asked about plots
in the us not london
hes fucking with you again
to be honest
ive never met a resistor
like this guy
hes a super resistor
he lied to you
to make you stop
he just tells us shit
he knows we already have
thats all he does
then thats
what were learning
thats what the waterboard
is giving us
we now know hes lying
i thought it was meant
to give us the truth
and the truth is hes lying
headquarters says we go again
the chief of interrogations
ordered the rectal rehydration
of ksm
not for health reasons
but as a way of showing total
control over the detainee
even though
rectal rehydration was never
an approved technique
total control isnt
chaining the guy to the wall
keeping him awake for days
and threatening his family
you need to shove a tube
up his ass
this right here
is the rest of your life
unless you start telling the truth
then they went back
to waterboarding him
when a medical officer
pressed on ksms
wait where are you
next page
when a medical officer
pressed on ksms abdomen
he expressed water
from his mouth and nose
so he was swallowing
all the water
on march 17th
the waterboard technique
began to evolve
interrogators used their hands
to maintain
a pool of water
over ksms nose and mouth
who are
the operatives inside the us
issa issa
issa albritani
where is the next attack
mmontana
we got something
ksm told interrogators he sent
abu issa albritani to the us
to recruit african american
muslims in montana
to blow up gas stations
and start forest fires
montana
muslims in montana
the fbi had serious doubts
as well
later ksm admitted
he just told them
what they wanted to hear
to make it stop
so did they get anything
actionable from him at all
anything that saved lives
they waterboarded him
183 times and then concluded
ksm may never be
forthcoming or honest
everything they got from him
was either a lie
or something they already had
well okay
so my first question is
if it works why do you need
to do it 183 times
maybe when
the report comes out
people will finally see that
well lets worry about getting
it right getting it done
we can worry about
changing the world later
sorry im late
its okay
barely slept
want some coffee
hey can i ask you something
you ever uh have dreams
you know about the stuff
thats in the report
yeah i have one
where im drowning
i cant move my arms or legs
i cant breathe
that wakes me up
last night i dreamt
i was trapped in
one of those confinement boxes
they just left me there
daniel jones right
do i know you
i just wanted to tell you to your face
that i think you
and that report are garbage
excuse me
you werent there
so you dont know
what worked and what didnt
or what we were up against
you may not realize
but we were trying
to protect this country
from people who want to destroy
everything we believe in
you may not realize it
but were trying to do
the exact same thing
your bullshit report will
never see the light of day
special prosecutor
durham please
its dan jones calling again
about the justice department
investigation of the cia
we really need to meet
you have
okay what are their findings
fuck
nothing
no indictments at all
no charges against
jose rodriguez or gina haspel
for destroying the tapes
nothing against the cia
for torturing people
nothing against
jim pavitt and the others
for providing misinformation
nothing at all
doj says they dont have
enough admissible evidence
to convict anyone
you go after the contractors
and theyre indemnified
you go after
the head of counterterrorism
and hed just say
he was following orders
from the cia director
you go after the director
and he
well he would just cite
the president
then the white house
would claim national security
doj at least share
what they found
no
they wont turn anything over
were the only ones
still looking at this
dan
dan
you know a cia officer
testified before congress
in 1978 regarding the use of
coercive physical interrogation
techniques in latin america
and the officer said
the techniques result
in false answers and have
proven to be ineffective
and before latin america
they did it in vietnam
they knew it didnt work
dan i need
to tell you something
and they did it again
dont even listen
to their own fucking people
im leaving the study
i i got a job offer
and i cant turn it down
im sorry but dont you see
what this is doing to you
to all of us
i mean my kids
are at home growing up
and im down here reading about
how they put a power drill
against one guys head
andand how they pulled
another guys arms
out of his sockets
and i just this is
how im spending my sundays
and my saturdays
this is how i spend every day
i just iiii cant
um im gonna leave
after thanksgiving
okay i understand
okay
thanksgiving
that gives us
that gives us a couple months
dan its november
thanksgiving is next week
how many pages have
we written so far thousands
we dont even know
if this is ever gonna come out
the tapes investigation
never did
its still classified
you just said it yourself
the cia knew
this shit didnt work in 1978
and it didnt stop them
from doing it again
look weve been down here
for two years dan
in this basement
nobodys waiting for us
to come out
shocking photos that
apparently show us troops
abusing detainees in a prison
outside baghdad
we have a problem
both myself and the president
have gone on record
saying we do not
torture people
he just made a statement
for the uns goddamn
day in support
of victims of torture
whwhatwhat did he say
the united states
does not torture
its against our laws
and its against our values
i have not authorized it
and i will not authorize it
im not sure where
that leaves either of us
so heres the deal
some new lawyer over at olc
jack goldsmith
is saying there are issues
with the john yoo memo
legal issues
yeah and theres
the inspector generals report
allegations of
war crimes and torture
throws the whole
program under the goddamn bus
whats it say
the inspector general finds
that eits are inconsistent
with the
public policy positions
the united states has taken
regarding human rights
blah blah blah
the program as implemented
diverges sharply from how the
cia has described blah blah
there is also little evidence
that the waterboard
is effective
in gaining information
look guys director tenet
wants to pause the program
you know i retired
from the air force
just a couple of months
before 911
22 years
and then
i wake up that morning
and i turn on the news and
see whats happening
a lot of people just went back
to their coffee and cornflakes
but jim wanted
to do something
to keep people safe
we are going right back to the
national security council today
and asking to have
the program recertified
as many techniques as possible
we have a plan
thank you thank you
jones
yes senator
on the sunday talk shows
former defense secretary
donald rumsfeld
and former vice president
dick cheney
argued enhanced interrogation
techniques played a major role
in leading up to the raid
on bin ladens compound
no thats not right
thats not what happened
it was not torture
ill look into it
and uh i would strongly
recommend that we continue it
at the heart of the controversy
is a process called
waterboarding
okay heres what
the cia is claiming
they got bin laden after using
eits against detainees
they say it all started in 2002
with abu zubaydah
and a detainee they called
riyadh the facilitator
who tipped them off
to abu ahmed alkuwaiti
who had ties to bin laden
thats not what happened
the truth is the cia
was on alkuwaitis phones
emails identity long before
they captured any detainees
before they even had
an eit program
zubaydah told us alkuwaiti had
nothing to do with bin laden
same with ksm
andand the others
but now we have former
cia director michael hayden
on the radio saying
this all came from eits
and former attorney general
mukasey is out there saying
ksm broke like a dam
after waterboarding
where is he saying that
wall street journal
i found a memo
its from a few months back
in march
its called
the public rollout
the memo states the agency
wanted their pr people
to connect the bin laden raid
to intel obtained via eits
before it even happened
so if the cia got bin laden
then who cares
what else it did
if it saved lives theres
no need for accountability
exactly they lied to bush
about the program
now theyre lying
to president obama
this document about bin laden
and uh the role of eits
it just isnt true
you want me to get you
the white house
lets do that
its very clear to us
the eits did not lead
to bin laden
the cia is misrepresenting
the operation
im sure you see that
dont you
mcdonough  im not
sure i understand senator
the mission was a success
thats the headline here
this is a crucial moment
in our nations history
i want to make certain that the
agency isnt manipulating it
to sanitize
their own past actions
i will let
the national security advisor
know your concerns senator
thank you
thank you senator feinstein
thats it
they dont care
the story is wrong
well i dont think we can look
to the white house for support
what the hell just happened
the cia just got
the president reelected
thats what happened
it was the
greatest manhunt of all time
you think you know the story
but hold on to your seats
zero dark thirty
the riveting new film
brings you the hunt
for osama bin laden
as it has never been
seen before
this is it
the last guy we have
number 119 muhammad rahim
captured june 2007
we kept rahim awake
for 138 hours straight
used the attention grasp
facial hold
dietary manipulation
abdominal slaps
stress positions
we even offered him a towel
to wear if he cooperated
gave us nothing
he said that
if we hurt him
hed just make things up
to get us to stop
and then he said
he was at our mercy
and we could kill him
if we wanted
whats the point
of moving forward
without the waterboard
its like trying to play
baseball without the bat
weve been going at him
for 60 days now
not getting anywhere
the problem is
that ctc hasnt given us
any good intel
to question him about
we dont have any leverage
hold on
youre the psychologists
you told me you were
gonna get us intel
now youre saying
we need to give it to you
im thinking we improve his
treatment for a week or two
give him some hope
and then we go back at him hard
and create
a sense of helplessness
or we could try recruiting him
tell him he can be
a cia agent if he talks
the fbi does that
were not the fbi
we dont do that
the way the science works is
we only get the intel after
after what
why are so many of these guys
still lying to us
after you work on them
wheres the special sauce
you have to make this work
its only legal if it works
the cias questioning
of muhammad rahim
resulted in
zero intelligence reports
on april 21 2008
the agency convened
an afteraction review
of his interrogation
senator i just want to point
out that this is the first time
the agency stopped
and evaluated
the effectiveness
of the program
and they concluded that
in the future
cia interrogators should use
rapport building
they even suggested
asking other agencies
law enforcement
and even other countries
about effective
interrogation methods
so
for the past six years
theres been a steady stream
of cia personnel
directors deputies analysts
coming over here and telling me
what an amazing success
eits have been
somehow not even one of them
managed to mention that part
how many detainees have been
through the program in total
at least 119
the agency admits
a quarter of them
should never
have been detained
the eit program never worked
not on anyone
today we are gathered
to approve
the committees study of
the cia detention
and interrogation program
i would like to thank
daniel jones
and his small staff
who prepared this study
clerk would you call the roll
mr udall
yay

the motion passes
the report will now be sent
to the cia for final comments
i john owen brennan
do solemnly swear to tell
the truth the full truth
and nothing but the truth
so help me god
thank you mr brennan
i look forward
to hearing your testimony
i am honored
to appear before you today
as the presidents nominee
for director of the cia
id like to say from
the beginning that honesty
truthfulness was a value
inculcated in me
growing up in new jersey by
my parents owen and dorothy
now none of us
are perfect beings
i am far from perfect
but i will be honest
with this committee
and do everything possible
to meet your legitimate needs
and requirements
mr brennan
ive long believed that our
government has an obligation
to the american people to face
its mistakes transparently
to help the public understand
the nature of those mistakes
and to correct them
the enhanced interrogation
techniques were brutal
and perhaps most importantly
they did not work
now the cia has
a responsibility
to correct any inaccurate
information it provided
to the previous white house
the department of justice
congress and the public
so heres my question
do you agree that the cia
has this responsibility
and id appreciate
a yes or no answer
yes senator
absolutely
office of the chief of staff
mr mcdonough is
in a meeting right now
according to the latest nbc
newswall street journal poll
the presidents
approval rating is at 44
thats up three points since march
excuse me mr mcdonough
director brennan is here
oh
there he is
congratulations mr director
thank you
welcome come on in
thank you
thank you
and thank president obama
ill let him know
speaking of uh
he wanted me to ask you
if theres any new information
on the drone strikes
of april 29th
we can confirm
that the al qaeda planner
abu sulayman aljazairi
has been killed
unfortunately we also believe
that there were between five
and ten civilian casualties
shit
well ill let
the president know
what about the
intelligence committee report
we need to talk about that
john wwe gave the cia
until february
to come up with its response
its now may
ive got senator feinstein
all over my phone sheet
i dont want to be the one
who has to push on this
but the president would really
like to get this behind us
and
we acknowledge that
the detention and interrogation
program had shortcomings
and that the agency
made mistakes
the most serious of those
occurred early on
and stemmed from the fact
that we were unprepared
now as you know we part ways
on some key points
according to our review
indications are that
interrogations of
detainees upon whom
the enhanced interrogation
techniques were used
did produce unique intelligence
that helped
thwart attack plans
capture terrorists
and saved lives
excuse me intelligence
gathered from eits
and that intelligence
continues to inform
our counterterrorism efforts
it led us to bin laden
now its one thing
to disapprove of the program
ii welcome that conversation
but its something else
altogether
to say that it was
mismanaged and ineffective
excuse me director brennan
the report is
based on cia records
cia officers themselves
called it ineffective
cia officers
well you didnt speak to any
cia officers in the program
did you dan
your lawyers would not
make them available to us
because of the department
of justices criminal inquiry
we also disagree with
the studys characterization of
how the cia briefed congress
the white house and the press
now we have documentation
that certainly proves that
excuse me sir what documents
if the director is referencing
cables or emails
we were never shown
then thats a violation
of our agreement
everything was supposed
to have been provided to us
do we just give
the committee access
to the entire
cia computer system
is that where this goes
dan gets to read every email
gets to see every document
every relevant document
or email yes
i have always supported
the intelligence community
i broke with my own party
to support the drone program
but what this report
makes very clear
is a real need for oversight
and accountability
you asked for our response
and we gave it to you
we looked in the mirror
now uh we made mistakes
there were abuses and those
abuses have been addressed
but ii vehemently disagree
with the narrative
that youre trying
to string together here
it lacks context
it does not paint
an accurate picture
of the work that was done
lets go
senator john brennans
name is in that report
he was director tenets
chief of staff
and then
deputy executive director
when the program started
he grew up at the agency
he claims to have
spoken out against the eit program
where
i just spent five years
looking at their emails
i never found anything
to suggest thats true
well we knew
this wasnt going to be easy
they have their own narrative
and theyre gonna stick to it
maybe we could come up
with some middle ground
find some common language
i thought our job
was to provide oversight
and accountability
not middle ground
i have a question for you
do you work for me
or for the report
and id encourage you to think
about that before answering
mcdonough
dan
dan jones
there he is
look at you chief investigator
of the largest study
the senates ever conducted
my god how you doing
its good to see you
in the fresh air
yeah
its so funny
i was just thinking
the other night
do you remember that time
you came and saw me
right after
you got out of school
you said go get
intel experience
wait till the dems
got the senate back
and look at you now
working for the
senate intelligence committee
for dianne feinstein
you told me once you wanted
to make a difference
i hope you still
get that chance
what does that mean
what does that mean
it means dan get out of the
senators head about the cia
youre not doing yourself
any favors
have you read the report
its 7000 pages dan
the bible tells the history
of mankind in less than that
look buddy
were gonna get the cia
to sit down with you
tell you
their side of the story
it would help
if you would listen
the study seems
to most seriously diverge
from the facts by asking
the reader to believe
the cia withheld information
from the executive branch
and congress
wed like to see that
removed from the report
after the photos of
abu ghraib came out in 2004
deputy director mclaughlin
appeared before congress
in front of you and said
the cia is not authorized
to do anything like what
youve seen in those photos
but what they were doing
was even worse
then in 2005
senator rockefeller
called for a review
of the program
and the deputy chief
of counterterrorism
got nervous
where that might lead
so he sent a message
to senior leadership
discussing the need
to manage the situation
he said we either get out
and sell or we get hammered
congress reads it
cuts our authorities
messes up our budget
we need to make sure
the impression of
what we do is positive
this is the deputy chief
of counterterrorism
that all stays in
we fundamentally disagree
with the assertion
that the program was
poorly managed and executed
and that unqualified officers
imposed brutal conditions
used unapproved techniques and
were rarely held accountable
what about mitchell and jessen
mitchells phd thesis
was on diet and exercise
for controlling hypertension
jessens dissertation
was on family therapy
something called
family sculpting
where you make clay figures
of your family members
no how much were they paid
they had no experience
in realworld interrogations
no science
to back up their claims
they were allowed to assess
the effectiveness
of their own program
without providing
any scientific evidence
how much in total
did the us taxpayers
give them for their work
over 80 million
the agency also disagrees that
the detention and interrogation
program did not produce
unique intelligence
that disrupted plots
and saved lives
for instance
the identity of josé padilla
the dirty bomber
if we hadnt stopped padilla
this entire area
would be radioactive today
josé padilla
padilla found the instructions
for his dirty bomb online
inin an article entitled
making and owning an hbomb
is the kind of challenge
real americans seek
it says
fill two buckets with uranium
and swing them above your head
as fast as possible
it was a joke
as far as we can tell
everything they attribute
to eits they already had
from other sources
from foreign governments
from other methods
they claim they saved lives
but what they really did
was make it impossible
to prosecute
a mass murderer like ksm
because if what we did to him
ever came out in a court
of law the case is over
the guy planned 911
and instead of going to jail
for the rest of his life
the cia turned him into
a recruiting tool
for a war were still fighting
stop meeting with them
this is a remarkable document
youve created
truly
it will provide
an enduring history
whether it comes out or not
what does that mean wwhether
it comes out or not
what does she mean
what does that mean
weve been working on this
thing for nearly five years
yes and it is still
our word against theirs
shes gonna need
more than that
this is jones
hey dan this is evan tanner
um i hear rumors the report
might not be coming out now
a lot of pushback
from the agency
theyre calling it flawed
who told you that
dan im the
national security reporter
for the new york times
do you have any thoughts
its not
my place to talk about rumors
no i didnt think you would
i was wondering
if you might want to comment
uh it can be off the record
i just think we can
help each other here
you know i cant do that
and heres what we know
about caroline krass
20 years
in the executive branch
including the
office of legal counsel
where she worked with john yoo
guys this
confirmations a done deal
were not gonna stop it
but it is a public hearing
and it just seems like
theres an opportunity
to say something
whwhat are you
looking for senator
i dont know something
to move the study forward
to break us
out of this stalemate
any ideas
senator there is a document
you ever sleep bro
i used to
got in the way of work
anything in that bag contain
the real names of cia officers
assets or partners
or any information
that would be in violation
of the agreement between
the central intelligence agency
and the united states senate
have a good night jay
you too dan
the committee
will come to order
today we are gathered
for the confirmation hearing
of caroline krass to be
general counsel of the cia
welcome ms krass
im honored to be here
before the committee
and id like to take this
moment to acknowledge my family
and thank them
for their support
thank you
uh before we begin
i would like to remind members
not to discuss
classified topics
or ask questions which require
a classified answer
with that said
i turn to senator udall
ms krass
nice to see you again
we had a chance
to sit down last week
and discuss the senates study
on the detention
and interrogation program
you told me you found the study
to be hard reading
also last week
a number of articles appeared
discussing
the oneyear anniversary
of the vote to approve
the committees study
and in one of those articles
the cia claimed to have found
significant errors
now i got to tell you i dont
believe that is accurate
in fact
im more confident than ever
in the factual accuracy
of the committees study
i want to say that again
im more confident than ever
it appears that the cia
performed their own study
of the eit program initiated
by former director panetta
and the findings
in that review
are entirely consistent
with our committees report
but amazingly conflicts with
the cias official response
to that report
so why is a review
the cia conducted internally
and never revealed to congress
so different from
the cias formal response
to the committees report
do you have an answer for that
um not at this time
if i wanted the public to know
about the panetta review
i would have told them myself
we hear that the republicans
are gonna censure udall
for that performance
but the review
proves our point
they found
the same things we did
the agency didnt know
how or where to hold people
didnt know
how to interrogate people
and more importantly
the cia did give it to us
i dont know
if it was an accident
or it was a whistleblower
well if it was
a whistleblower
you may have just exposed them
not to mention yourself
we got something here
the director
has asked me here today
in my capacity
as agency legal counsel
what we have to discuss
has serious implications
all right
we have proof that the staff
of the senate
intelligence committee
illegally gained access
to the cias computer network
and obtained
classified documents
what kind of proof
we found the document
in question
on daniel joness computer
we did not provide it to him
or to the committee
if he didnt hack us
how did it get there
we feel that jones and his team
need to be disciplined
immediate dismissal
is in order
at a minimum i would think
john are you saying that you
broke into the computer system
of the united states senate
we never gave you clearance
on that document
it was classified yet
you chose to make it public
weve made our investigation
and our findings
known to the white house
youre fucking kidding me
theyre saying i broke into
the most top secret
computer system in the world
brennan and eastman came over
eastman
eastmans name is in the report
over a thousand times
thats not a conflict
dan
they filed a criminal referral
against you
they want you gone
hhow did the agency
come to the conclusion
that im a hacker
hhow do they even know
whats on my computer
they say
they conducted a search
of the united states senate
the whole reason
this committee was established
in the first place
was to stop the cia
from spying on us citizens
the senator is talking
to harry reid about
that very thing
did they go into that room
that room is offlimits did
they go into that fucking room
i dont know
i dont know
i do know that the republicans
are gonna run with this
theyre gonna use it
to discredit the report
theyre gonna
use it to discredit you
dan theyre accusing you
of breaking the law
youre gonna need a lawyer
theres a saying at the agency
admit nothing
deny everything
make counteraccusations
thats what theyre doing
the cia is
investigating you for
theyre the ones who
should be investigated not me
mr jones
mr clifford will see you now
our computer system
isnt even connected
to the cia mainframe
so did i just
go over to langley
and break in on a weekend
seems unlikely
so what evidence do they have
a document
a document
what kind of a document
i cant tell you that
because what its classified
i was tasked
to lead an investigation
into a cia program
they started after 911
what they called
enhanced interrogation
and i assume your work
is critical of the agency
you know dan a lot of people
in this country
felt the cia was
justified in doing
whatever they had to do
to keep us safe
i have friends
who lost people that day
and a lot of people watch 24
on thursday nights
and hear jack bauer say
i dont want to bypass
the constitution
but these are
extraordinary circumstances
just before you know
he ssticks a knife in them
and makes them give up a plot
itit doesnt work that way
well as
winston churchill said
history is written
by the victors
churchill didnt really
say that hermann goring did
and what he said was
we will go down in history
either as the worlds
greatest statesmen
or its worst villains
so your report is
gonna determine that
statesmen or villains
how long have you been
working on this project dan
five years
five years
and it could all go away
just vanish in the face
of these allegations
i can certainly imagine
an ambitious young man
like yourself spends years
with his head buried
in some terrible spectacle
gets frustrated
with the process
sees an opportunity
to get the truth out faster
maybe crosses a line
im assuming this is
the most important thing
youve ever been a part of
i didnt do it
or i can see
an equally ambitious senator
encouraging you
to do something
now would be
a good time to tell me
that did not happen
what i did i did on my own
i acted alone
so you did steal the document
i did not steal it
you needed it to
i relocated it
i put it in a safe
if they had a way
of destroying tapes
then surely they could get
everyone has their own words
the language is built
to choose sides
now why did you relocate it
documents had a way of
disappearing off the server
for instance in 2010
over 800 documents
just vanished
without any explanation
so you had computer issues
all along
who else knew
what was on the computers
well the cia hired an outside
firm to vet the documents
centra
and caci was also involved
who are they
contractors
but jim pavitt
is on their board
former deputy director
of operations for the cia
jim pavitt during the program
jim pavitt
and is he named in the report
cant tell me
so they cant destroy
the document
then they can go after
the next best thing you
make you a zealot
anything you touch is tainted
i could see the agency saying
that this is a violation
of the espionage act the
computer fraud and abuse act
uh who knows what else
and if they file
a charge against me
how long could i go away for
i dont know
20 years maybe more
i did not hack into
the cia computer system
i mean my com my computer
skills stop at microsoft word
they probably know that
let me ask you something
how much does
a senate staffer make
at my level
aboutabout a hundred grand
any retirement savings
family money
no
so we should discuss
my retainer
how much is that
30000 to start
and if it goes to trial
add a zero
nothing could make them happier
than knowing youre
sitting here talking to me
thats what they want dan
make you bleed money
all over my floor
do you want my expert opinion
for free
you dont really have
a legal problem
you have a sunlight problem
im sure you know people
who can help you solve it
daniel jones
i didnt think
youd ever return my calls
does your boss know
youre talking to
a guy with a byline
and a tape recorder
theres something going on
i think you should look into
it involves the agency
okay is it that report
youve been working on
the one that
never quite comes out
computers it has to do with
the hacking of computers
all right whose
the united states senate
someone hacked into the senate
no shit okay
you have any idea if it was
foreign or domestic
uh all right yes you
sorry you said
it was the agency
so whatwhat does the cia
have to do with
us senate computers
evan youre the
national security reporter
for the new york times
you can figure it out
all right
hmm
morning senator
you wanted to see me
you know anything about this
computer searches at center
of dispute on cia detentions
you have any idea
how that ended up
in the new york times
yeah i saw that
it looks accurate
senator mccain is already
calling the cia a rogue agency
what are your thoughts on
someone like
edward snowden dan
wwell senator i know
how you feel about leaks
i think hes a traitor
plain and simple
its my job
to provide oversight
with the tools of governance
not lights and cameras
and headlines
do you want me to resign
no
but i think i might need you
to write me a speech
senator feinstein claimed today
on the senate floor
that the cia hacked
the senate intelligence
committees computers
to thwart an investigation
into past practices
can you respond to that
well first
we in no way shape or form
tried to thwart
the release of the report
uh we want that behind us
as far as this allegation
that the cia
somehow hacked into
the senate computer system
nothing could be
further from the truth
we just wouldnt do that
its beyond
the scope of reason
thank you
i understand
your position senator
and i am aware of
director brennans comments
did you hear what lindsey
graham said this morning
about the agency
breaking into our computers
the legislative branch
should declare war on the cia
heads should roll
people should go to jail
is that what you want
send people to jail
we do have jails for a reason
the justice department
investigated the cia
and they decided
not to prosecute
its their call not ours
now when this administration
took office
we faced
the very real possibility
of economic collapse
we had a decision to make
do we spend our political
capital on going around
trying to find people to blame
or do we solve the problem
maybe the way
to solve the problem
is to hold people accountable
do you ever wonder
why history repeats itself
well i think
maybe its because
we dont always listen
the first time
senator the people at the
agency they have families
there are children
who might lose a parent
years ago some radical group
put a bomb in the flower box
outside of my daughters
bedroom window right out here
had it been any warmer out
it would have exploded
and then there was the time
that i found harvey milk
shot to death in his office
ii think im aware of
the risks of public service
president obama
ended the torture program
three days after taking office
the eits what the cia did
that is not our mess
no its not
but thats not the question
were asking is it
the question were asking is
who is going to clean it up
so lets do that
right after director brennan
apologizes to me and my staff
the inspector general is here
go ahead in
in regards to the cia
search of senate computers
weve looked into the matter
and have recommended
that the department of justice
begin a criminal investigation
good
so have we
dan jones
lead senate investigator
not the senate staff
the cia
us
areare you accusing me or
my staff of breaking the law
my understanding is
that five cia employees
entered a room
that was offlimits
on whose orders
senator feinstein
is right to call this
a violation of
the separation of powers
the cia cannot spy
on the us congress
as inspector general
im gonna have to launch
a full investigation
into the agencys actions
am i going to jail
no theyre
dropping the charges
youre going back to work
take the most important
findings finish the summary
no more than 400 pages
im going to ask the committee
to vote to release it
mcdonough
so you saw they voted
11 to three
they want to release
an executive summary
that thing goes out
it puts my people in danger
who are out there
in a dangerous world today
trying to do their jobs
pulls the rug
out from under them
anything that you feel
puts your people in harms way
stays classified
my concern is this
ifif the senate puts out
a small pile of pages
and the press goes nuts
then everybodys gonna want
to see a bigger pile of pages
you keep saying the president
wants to turn the page
well then turn the page
close the damn book
senator feinstein
has asked the white house
to head up final comments
and redactions
she wants us
right in the middle of it
and
and i think thats exactly
where you want us
youll have the pen
leadership specified
that we should redact
anything that could result in
legal exposure
for officers in the field
past or present
basically if theres
any questions black it out
you see this
what the
fuck is this
good afternoon wheres marcy
conference room
early the next week
wednesday
yeah thatll work
and you get me the agenda
thank you
imagine you pick up a book
and blank turns water
into wine on page 237
and on page 71
blank heals a leper
and on page 295
blank rises from the dead
how do you know the blanks
are all the same person
i thought that the cia
agreed to using pseudonyms
they did but now even
the fake names are gone
and the dates
the entire story is gone
i hope you took
your strong pills today
mcdonough isnt it enough
to know what actually happened
do we need to know the names
of the people involved
but the actual names
arent in the report
someone could figure out
who our people are
based on their pseudonyms
you know i found
a photo of my husband
on the internet
linking him to me
secrecy is very hard
to maintain
i believe you introduced
your husband publicly
at your confirmation hearing
it was on cspan
some of these people
they are out there
in the world right now
yes they are
theres an officer
from alec station
mentioned 41 times
in 500 pages
in 1998 her team
missed the bombing
of the us embassy
in kenya and tanzania
1999 they missed the bombing
of the marriott hotel
in islamabad
in 2000 she was made aware
of two al qaeda operatives
who arrived in los angeles
fbi officers working within
the bin laden unit
requested permission
to investigate
thats not how
we want to play it
the cia knew
they were on american soil
and didnt do anything
almihdhar then left the states
to play a key role
in the bombing of the uss cole
before returning to hijack
flight 77 with alhazmi
and crash into the pentagon
and you want to
protect this persons identity
wed also like to redact
the pseudonyms
of the contractors
dr mitchell was already quoted
by name in the new yorker
he was handing out brochures
at professional conferences
telling people
he worked for the cia
if we are protecting
the identities of cia staff
we need to protect
our contractors as well
mitchell and jessen were given
a contract by the agency
for a program that didnt work
the cia also agreed
to a five million dollar
indemnification clause
for their company that covered
among other expenses
criminal prosecution
you know i kept
the rag we used on ksm
you should ebay that bad boy
when this is all over
make a mint
an internal cia memo concluded
that mitchell and jessen have
both shown blatant disregard
for the ethics shared by almost
all of their colleagues
the pseudonyms for
the contractors need to stay
mcdonough guys weve been
at this for months
what about the
locations of the black sites
the country names
we made commitments
to those countries
to maintain their secrecy
no country names
not open to negotiating
these points
we need to consider
the morale of the cia here
now wewe publish this report
theres a very good chance we could lose them
lose them
what does that mean
what about the morale
of all the people at the agency
who spoke out
against the program
what about them
people who sent cables back
from black sites
saying they wanted
to be transferred
because they were disgusted by
what was being done
all right uh look
we have
dan more than anyone
have worked to uncover
the truth about this
when no one else would
we will not allow this
to be covered up
by the executive branch
president obama
called it torture
bush and cheney
wouldnt do that
he signed an executive order
getting rid of it
now just imagine god forbid
theres another
terrorist attack on our watch
there wont be another democrat
in the white house
for 20 years
id also like
to talk about the redactions
concerning ksm
cory gardner
the republican challenger
will be the next
united states senator
from the state of colorado
defeating the democratic
incumbent mark udall
a major major win
for the republicans
chris frates is standing by
in colorado
this is huge
for uh colorado wolf
this is the first time
a republican has won
the senate race statewide
in colorado since 2002
big night for colorado
and a big night for control
of the united states senate
shes expecting you
so i just got a call
from secretary of state kerry
he thinks that
with the release of the report
that the coalition against isil
could collapse
isnt that a bit convenient
he calls you just before
dan
whwhere did kerry get
his intel on this the cia
is it credible
embassies could be attacked
hostages could be killed
its just another stall tactic
he suggested giving the report
to the president
so that it could be released
later when hostilities cease
you lose control of the
committee in a week senator
yes i am aware of what happens
when the republicans
are in the majority dan
look i want to get this report
out as much as anyone
but i have known him
a long time
i tend to believe him
nobody else is gonna
tell this story
dan the senator has a luncheon
if we stop now
arent we a part
of the coverup
strong pills senator
i think you should go home
and get some rest
you look tired
marcy if i could
have five minutes
of course
did you ever meet a guy
called greg craig
just in pa white house
counsel when obama took office
just in passing
right
so right after he got elected
the president asked craig
to come up with a plan
to deal with
the aftermath
of the torture program
so he got secretary of defense
gates janet napolitano
hillary clinton
serious people in a room
and he asked for
their recommendation
and
aand the consensus
was that the president
should appoint
an independent
bipartisan commission
into interrogations
and detainee treatment
like a deep dive into
what worked and what didnt
and who was responsible
you know like what they did
after 911
and like what youve been
trying to do
so why didnt they do that
well evidently
the president listened closely
to the recommendation
he then thought about it
and then he said no
hed spent an entire campaign
saying he was postpartisan
so going after
the bush administration
flew in the face of all that
and right then everyone in
that room changed their minds
they sided with the president
no independent commission
everyone except craig
because he thought
it was too important
you couldnt just
torture people
lie about it
and then hide it from history
a few months later
craig was gone
and this mess
wound up with the senate
and you
well the president must have
known that by doing that
he was making it
next to impossible
uh he came from the senate
dan they sent you off
to build a boat
but they had no intention
of sailing it
they probably didnt think
youd get as far as you did
let me ask you a question
if the cia knew
that torture didnt work
why did they continue to do it
after 911
everyone was scared
scared it might
happen again
and the cia would be blamed
if it did
or maybe they were ashamed
you know how come
the most sophisticated
intelligence organization
on earth
couldnt keep
its own people safe
but fear and shame dont make
for better policy decisions
and the fact that
the people who we captured
didnt look like us or
believe the same things we do
made it that much easier
to do the things we did
so once
the cia program started
they had to keep
telling people it worked
even if it wasnt true
their own position was that
if it didnt work
it was illegal
so they misrepresented
the results
if we had your report
we would print it tomorrow
all of it
the senator said
she would release
a summary of the report
really
over the objections of the cia
and the white house
you really think
thats gonna happen
if i gave it to you
what would happen
some people will think
youre a hero
and some will probably think
youre a traitor
look at edward snowden
no if its gonna come out
its gonna come out
the right way
what if it doesnt
then i didnt do my job
im sorry
sorry
mcdonough so with
the affordable care act
behind us the president
would like to begin
a serious discussion
about immigration reform
now obviously
weve had some setbacks
in both the house
and the senate
uh so strategy has become
paramount unity as well
so we would like to uh
really start talking about
excuse me mr mcdonough
i would like to discuss
the report on the cia
and the white houses position
thats not the topic
of this particular caucus
uh the president
would like to discuss
our country
did things the nazis did
things that made us
condemn other regimes
and the position
of this administration
is to suppress
this information
to keep the people
who did these things safe
i can assure you that is not
the position of
this administration senator
you worked with john brennan
at the
national security council
now i understand that brennan
gave this president
his first security briefing
when he took office
and now cia director brennan
is working closely with the
president on the drone program
you know its funny
every time
i go over to the cia
they claim im doing
the senates bidding
and every time i come here
you claim im doing
the cias bidding
i only have a few days left
in my term here
and if there isnt a plan to
release the report before i go
im prepared to read it
on the floor of the senate
and either the white house
or the republicans
will have to stop me
mcdonough
what would you have us do
now we go after
bush and cheney on this
whats to prevent
the republicans
from coming back at us and
trying to repeal health care
uh we go after the cia
uh maybe they say
okay well immigration reform
is off the table
maybe its gun control
now democracy is messy
but lets just think
how many countries
there are in the world
where a report like this
could even get done
i would like us to be more than
the country
that did the report
id like us to be the country
that made it public
and that is what i intend
to see happen
i yield the floor
to the senior senator
from california
over the past six years
a small team of investigators
pored over more than
63 million pages
of cia records
to complete this report
it shows that
the cias actions a decade ago
are a stain on our values
and on our history
the release of
this 500page summary
cannot remove that stain
but it can and does say
to our people and the world
that america is big enough
to admit when its wrong
and confident enough
to learn from its mistakes
releasing this report is
an important step toward
restoring our values
and showing the world
that we are in fact
a just and lawful society
there are those who will
seize upon the report and say
see what the americans did
and they will try to use it
to justify evil actions
or to incite more violence
we cannot prevent that
but history will judge us
by our commitment to
a just society governed by law
and the willingness
to face an ugly truth
and say never again
thank you
i now yield the floor
to the senator from arizona
john mccain
what might come as a surprise
is how little these practices
did to aid our efforts to bring
911 culprits to justice
and to find and prevent
terrorist attacks
today and tomorrow
that could be a real surprise
since it contradicts
the many assurances
provided by
intelligence officials
on the record and in private
that enhanced interrogation
techniques were indispensable
in the war against terrorism
i think its an insult to
the many intelligence officers
who have acquired
good intelligence
without hurting
or degrading prisoners
to assert we cant win this war
without such methods
yes we can and we will
but in the end
tortures failure to serve
its intended purpose
isnt the main reason
to oppose its use
this question isnt about
our enemies its about us
its about who we were who we
are and who we aspire to be
its about how we represent
ourselves to the world
our enemies act
without conscience
we must not
senator dianne feinstein today
exposed the cias now extinct
enhanced interrogation
techniques
the thing that strikes me about
what the senate
was doing today
dianne feinstein
jay rockefeller
is they were doing
everything they can
to make sure
this doesnt happen again
because by going public
like this
dan
you did well
thank you
thank you
were gonna be on you
if you try to do this
subtitles by explosiveskull
if pain was a color
to paint on you
your heart would be
the color blue
