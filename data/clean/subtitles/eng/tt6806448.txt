whats the matter with you lot
sir the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency
when she proves
to be less of a security risk
if someone leaves a back door open
its a bit daft not to try and use it
whats daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut
yeah well my point still stands
if you cant break out
of a shitty prison like this
then youre seriously slipping mum
you cheeky bugger
speaking of breaking out

time flies
when were apart
what is your skin care regimen
because you look
like a young shirley temple
whispers go go go go go
daddy who is this guy
well this guy is uh locke
and he works for the cia
your dad and i are old friends
were not old friends
actually were um
were best friends heres the half heart
i dont know what that is
we got some ink together as well
we did not get ink together
oh we didnt
no we did not
huh interesting
we never got ink together
well i seem to remember
getting a little something like this
at one point on my body
jesus
christ
i miss our playful banter
you have one minute
to tell me what you want
before i knock one of your lungs loose
you and i are after the same thing
say hello to the ct17 virus
its a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions
affectionately codenamed the snowflake
what does the snowflake do
oh nothing much
just uh liquefies your internal organs
basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup
she is nine
seen worse
where
game of thrones janets house
ive never heard of it
a lannister always pays his debts
youre never going over there again
locke but theres a new
wrinkle in the case rebecca
the specifics
sighs are all in the brief
there you go
shes ready becca
shes nine shes nine
this is the only unit of ct17
in existence
and this snowflake is now in the hands of
a rogue mi6 operative in london
dad are all spies that pretty
no she is unusually attractive
and deadly
last night she was part of an mi6 team
tasked with securing the virus
she then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad
she stabbed one guy
in the chest using a brick
do you know how hard that is
to stab someone using a brick
get to the point
the point is
theres no sharp edge
how did she get an entire brick
into another persons chest
she either had to be really strong
or the other person
had to have been like
born without like bones
get to the larger point
she stole the snowflake
she went totally offgrid
whos this
thats the scientist
we believe created the virus
great where do i find him
hes offgrid too
impossible to find maybe dead
youre very helpful locke
and youre the worlds best tracker
im sure youll figure something out
oh no no no
im dss youre cia i dont work for you
your boss loaned you out
you do now dickface
whatd you just call me
hey hey hey
lets just settle down all right
weve already got a black site
running in london
theres an operative there
top of his game
hell be your contact
i dont need anybody else i work alone
we got bigger problems
than your fragile ego
or the fact that a moment ago
i most definitely shit my pants
the entire world
is at stake here all right
this thing gets out
were looking at a lot of
liquefied organs
and i mean like everywhere
and not just yours and mine

mr nobody
mr nobody
little joke for you loeb
what do uh cia operatives
and baseballs have in common
people cheer when you hit them with a bat
no
they are two things
i dont give a toss about
that works too
agent loeb the weapon shes stolen
is not like anything weve ever seen
its a programmable disease
that can target any dna sequence
with a 100 mortality rate
inside 72 hours
if mi6 finds her
theyre gonna treat her like a traitor
mi6 agent 1 we need you
to surrender the virus
what is your location
what you think i killed them
agent loeb but if you help us find her
if you bring us the virus
well grant her immunity
weve set up a black site here in london
youve got everything you
could need at your disposal
and were bringing in an asset
from the states to assist you
i dont need anybody
maybe not mr shaw
but she does
inhales deeply
my guys in
my guys in too
hey is your guy gonna freak out
when he finds out who my guy is
i mean didnt they just do
a job together in new york
didnt they just destroy
the dss field office in la
by throwing each other through it
i dont know look
i dont know about your guy
but my guy
hes gonna get this
hes gonna pull this off you know why
weve been best friends
our whole goddamn lives
well my guy beat the shit out of me
at a bar in krakã³w 17 years ago
and he doesnt even remember me
so we all have our histories
anyway its the fate of the world here
its the fate of the world
the planets population is in their hands
serious stuff
i mean youd think
theyd be able to put aside
any petty rivalries to save the world
slurping mmm mmm
no fucking way
no fucking way
im not working with this guy

showerhead clatters
grenade rattling
grenade beeps dies

scientist the director called
he ordered a new baseline for you
he has everything
ready for you in medical
director on speakers
distorted perfection is
a painful process brixton
in ourselves and in the
pursuit of a perfect world
humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself
eteon will carve out
all human weakness
brixton screaming
and replace it
with mechanical perfection
and you will lead the way
im gonna ask you a question
its not what you think it is
do you like to dance
smacks lips what the electric slide
the macarena no i dont
no no no i was thinking
about the tango
where it takes two
yeah dont know that one
must be different generations
laughing
yeah well either way the music started
so lets see what kind of rhythm you have
wheres the virus
look i told you
ive no idea what youre talking about
okay that hurt
you just stepped on my toes
that didnt feel good
lets try it again
i think youre better than that
wheres the virus
i didnt ask to dance
and why should i talk to you
youre not cia
no how do you know that
where shall i start
theres two types of cia agents
intelligence and espionage
those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil
thats what intelligence agents look like
you look like you could
pick up a building
but espionage is about blending in
and about being subtle
and there is nothing subtle about you
yeah
thats good
im impressed
i didnt kill anybody
i know you didnt
how do you know that then
because you can learn a lot
about somebody when you fight them
and when we fought
you werent fighting to kill me
you were fighting to run away
but either way the world thinks that
youre a murderer and a thief
so youre not going anywhere
or getting any goddamn phone call
until you give me some real answers
you have no idea what is happening here
then tell me help me understand
i cant youre wasting my time
then i cant either
youre wasting time
virus gets in the wrong hands
thats it its game over
cell phone ringing
chuckles
ringing continues
does that mean its time for curls
just like the cia
always flexing the wrong muscle
you know the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body
maybe you should try exercising that
a little bit more
theres more wisdom in your body
than in your deepest philosophies
ooh let me guess that bruce lee
chuckles no nietzsche
cause im flexing this
and all of that
come here
if she moves i want you to shoot her
woman yeah he cant shoot me
yeah not allowed
in the face

i want you to shoot her
two times right in that face
okay

brixton update
ive hacked the mainframe
of every news agency and outlet
brixton how many do we control
tech hundred and seventyfour
broadcasts 2000 odd
brixton double it
i want 100 control of this story
tech standard frame job
no standard will not do
i need something special for these guys
so listen up narrative
hobbs shaw big guy
little guy have been idd
theyve been blamed for
the recent attacks on the cia
they shared a prison cell
where they hatched a plan
to start their reign of terror
just got real
inaudible news broadcast
hattie who the hell are these guys
shaw eteon theyre a secret tech cult
with a mercenary army
and plenty of dark money
and delusions of saving the world
by augmenting the human race
brixton thats it
apparently they control the media as well
heard rumors about these people
everybody thinks theyre a myth
shaw ive seen it firsthand
how real they are
if you dont fit into their plans
youve already dug your own grave
all right lets get to the
nearest lockdown facility
hey no no no you dont get it do you
brixtons a tierone assassin
best ive ever seen i know him
he aint never gonna stop
until he gets that virus
and besides thats my sister
family business
is your name shaw no
then shes going nowhere with you
when it comes to the fate of the world
it becomes my business
i dont care if shes your sister
that woman aint going anywhere
where are you going
im going away
i dont have time for your
alpha male shit right now
youre both idiots
you clearly cant work together
and so youre absolutely useless to me
so im gonna go find the man
who can help me get this thing
out of my system
see ya
hobbs you mean this man
i was tracking him before the attack
hes hard to find but i think
i got a hell of a lead
russian newspaper
not just any old paper
theres only one place
in london that sells that
andreiko speaking russian
thank you see you tomorrow
speaking russian
thats a bit optimistic
grunts
call the director
line ringing
director distorted
well well deckard shaw
how complicated for you
not really
hes also working with dss luke hobbs
director hobbs we have a history
theyre formidable
small fry
ill eliminate the two of them
get the asset back asap
director you get the girl
extract the virus
and reprogram it for phase one
we use that weapon to eliminate the weak
and anyone who would get in our way
were building
the perfect system brixton
hobbs and shaw can be
considerable assets for eteon
turn them
turn em
sorry i dont follow
director i want them turned
i want them working for the cause
understood
they cant be turned
director what makes you so certain
the last time we asked
i got shot in the face
that makes me very certain
so i suggest
that we take another approach
which is why
director im not asking brixton
you show them the consequences of refusal
or perhaps ill show them to you
is that a threat
director id remember
who youre relying on
for your survival
all for the cause
look honey i have to talk
to you about something
its very important right now
remember how we spoke about
what would happen if things went sideways
we called it a code red
well its happening
is there anything i can do
you need to stay home
youre gonna be safe there
as a matter of fact weve got the cia
listening in on this call right now
watch this hi locke
everybodys safe everybodys great
im actually at uh our old diner here
its super weird being here
without you guys
think its closed
thank you brother
honey ive already talked to aunt lisa
she knows exactly what to do
im gonna be home as soon as i can
love you
i love you back
goodbye
luke hobbs and deckard shaw
while hobbs is an agent in the american
tell us everything you know about this
my god
when were you exposed
hattie about 30 hours ago
then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact
so we need to neutralize it
no it is not that easy
its not programmed to any dna sequence
its fatal to everyone
in 42 hours the capsules will dissolve
and she will be infected
then the virus will go airborne
we are talking global
contamination within a week
why in the hell would you
create something like that
because i thought i was one of them
eteon
they told me they wanted to
save the world through science
i believed in their cause
i developed the snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines
a panacea for the whole world
but they redeveloped it into
a programmable apocalypse
to attack the weakest of us
those not worthy of eteons
vision of the future
for a scientist
you seem incredibly stupid
well im a twotimes nobel prize winner
but whos counting
all right you said
the virus is programmable
so reprogram it
i cant reprogram it in a host
just tell us how to get
this thing out from me
well there are two options
and the first is easy
go
finally
you kill her
excuse me
oh and burn the body of course
of course
of course
no i mean really burn it
really burn it
to ash
to ash
beyond all recognition
lets assume that thats not an option
shall we genius
yeah it doesnt work for us
option number two
there is a machine
that could preserve her life
and extract the virus
that shouldve been option number one
because its impossible to get to
well decide whats impossible
where is it
its in the eteon laboratory
where the snowflake was developed
a secret darktech complex
fortified by an army
in the most godforsaken
part of the planet
but if you go there
all three of you will die
so basically what youre saying is
she dies no matter what
well who needs a drink
i know just the place
funk music playing
wow look at all these
somebodys overcompensating
if anything im undercompensating
hobbs and a teenytiny one
chuckles just your size
shaw used it for a job over in italy
shame we didnt need
a weightlifting bus driver
wouldve given you a call
laughs
drink
yeah ill take a little one
ill write to someone in moscow
an old friend
yeah we have a long history
she and her crew are paying
a visit to some locals
particular russian criminal element
they have things that were gonna need
considering your history with friends
how many bullets you put
in this ones head
they can set us up with gear
and i dont hear any other ideas
you know as well as i do
getting out of this country
is gonna be extremely difficult
we have every major intelligence agency
already hunting us down
hattie and theres the fact
that you disgraced mi6
when you betrayed your team
dont believe everything
they tell you hat
smile
camera shutter clicks
no regular back channels
arent gonna work this time
were gonna have to
do our best to blend in
hattie hide in plain sight
thats why well be flying commercial
commercial were gonna get spotted
too easy at
camera shutter clicks
dont worry that peasized brain
i handled it
cloned our cell phone signals
around the world

deckard shaw
margarita

margarita i got your list
its long
i asked for a house on a runway
not sure a dozen russians
in duct tape were on the list
well give me more than threehour notice
and i wouldnt have to
resort to such extremes
not sure three hours has anything to do
with your extremes margarita
margarita quã mierda deckard
eteon could you pick
a harder place to break into
we need to find the c17
viral extraction machine
could be anywhere
that facility is three square miles
of research labs
yeah and its a powder keg
packed with munitions
weve gotta pull a mick jagger
this sounds like a fun game
were not getting you on the inside no
when deck and i were kids
wed spend our time
coming up with these grifts
a mick jagger was a job
that required one person to showboat
to draw all the eyes while
the others made the music
a typical inside job
guys you heard andreiko
they have to use the extraction machine
so theyll take me right to it
no i can do it
we can do it
so now the only question is
how to ring eteons dinner bell
oh i can handle that part
but first lets get you geared up
these are your halo parachutes
earbuds for encrypted communication
scorpion evo 3 with optical sights
ultrathin bulletresisting kevlar
infrared cameras for seeing through walls
and last but not least
compact hydrogen detonator
put it in the right spot
itll blow the place skyhigh
how do i look
looks a little tight
how you holding up
you know if things go south in there
you cant leave me alive

do you wash the blood off your hands
before you count your money
or is it afterwards
dismissed
you dont get it do you
you know the weak deal with money
we deal with evolutionary change
change that sometimes require
acts of violence
like killing innocent people with viruses
only the weak ones
were dealing with the future
of the planet
things that money cannot buy
oh like your soul back
my soul
your brother took my soul
the boys in the lab made me a new one
now thats progress
guard groans
brixton welcome to the
extraction room miss shaw

electricity crackling

theyre lunatics
visionaries
visionaries of a future
a bigger future a brighter future
you remember the data they gave us man

shock to the system

the truth is
he was just looking for a new crew
and i was the only one
to see through those lies
hobbs sighs
so the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into
just got bigger and more dangerous
then eventually he knew
and he was okay with
