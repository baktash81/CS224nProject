come on  she s 71 years old 
what s the matter with you lot 
sir  the prisoner will
only be allowed more leniency
when she proves
to be less of a security risk 
if someone leaves a back door open 
it s a bit daft not to try and use it 
what s daft is paying
one of the screws to leave it open
but not paying them enough
to keep their mouth shut 
yeah  well  my point still stands 
if you can t break out
of a shitty prison like this 
then you re seriously slipping  mum 
you cheeky bugger 
speaking of breaking out 
where s my birthday cake

robbing banks 
you used to give
your little scams code names 
 laughing  do you remember 
  oh  what was that one  um   
  the  keith moon  
magdalene   chuckles  yeah  that s right 
it was called the  keith moon 
because it   
shaw  it involved
lots of explosive percussion
and permanent ear damage 
 hard rock music playing 
 laughing 
that s my boy 
no wonder we left the family business 
magdalene  she loves you  you know

 magdalene laughs 
  all right 
  man  lucas rebecca hobbs 
i haven t seen you in forever 
 rebecca  
do you even age  how long s it been 
  six months 
  time flies 
when we re apart 
what is your skin care regimen 
because you look
like a young shirley temple 
 whispers  go  go  go  go  go 
daddy  who is this guy 
well  this guy is  uh  locke 
and he works for the cia 
your dad and i are old friends 
  we re not old friends 
  actually  we re  um   
we re best friends  here s the half heart 
i don t know what that is 
we got some ink together as well 
we did not get ink together 
  oh  we didn t 
  no  we did not 
  huh  interesting 
  we never got ink together 
well  i seem to remember
getting a little something like this
at one point on my body 
  jesus 
  christ 
i miss our playful banter 
you have one minute
to tell me what you want
before i knock one of your lungs loose 
you and i are after the same thing 
say hello to the ct 17 virus 
it s a programmable bioweapon
of biblical proportions 
affectionately code named  the snowflake  
what does the snowflake do 
oh  nothing much 
just  uh  liquefies your internal organs 
basically turns your body
into a giant bag of hot soup 
she is nine 
  seen worse 
  where 
game of thrones  janet s house 
i ve never heard of it 
a lannister always pays his debts 
you re never going over there again 
locke  but there s a new
wrinkle in the case  rebecca 
the specifics   
 sighs  are all in the brief 
there you go 
  she s ready  becca 
  she s nine  she s nine 
this is the only unit of ct 17
in existence 
and this snowflake is now in the hands of
a rogue mi6 operative in london 
dad  are all spies that pretty 
no  she is unusually attractive 
and deadly 
last night she was part of an mi6 team
tasked with securing the virus 
she then proceeded to kill
her entire black ops squad 
she stabbed one guy
in the chest using a brick 
do you know how hard that is 
to stab someone using a brick 
  get to the point 
  the point is
there s no sharp edge 
how did she get an entire brick
into another person s chest 
she either had to be really strong
or the other person
had to have been  like 
born without  like  bones 
get to the larger point 
she stole the snowflake 
  she went totally off grid 
  who s this 
that s the scientist
we believe created the virus 
great  where do i find him 
he s off grid too 
impossible to find  maybe dead 
you re very helpful  locke 
and you re the world s best tracker 
i m sure you ll figure something out 
oh  no  no  no 
i m dss  you re cia  i don t work for you 
your boss loaned you out 
you do now  dickface 
  what d you just call me 
  hey  hey  hey 
let s just settle down  all right 
we ve already got a black site
running in london 
there s an operative there 
top of his game 
he ll be your contact 
i don t need anybody else  i work alone 
we got bigger problems
than your fragile ego 
or the fact that a moment ago
i most definitely shit my pants 
the entire world
is at stake here  all right 
this thing gets out 
we re looking at a lot of
liquefied organs 
and i mean  like  everywhere 
and not just yours and mine 
uh    he knows i can see him  right 
he knows nothing  jon snow 
 sam chuckles 
so what s it gonna be  becky 
you gonna partner up 
  i m in 
  of course you are 
do you remember what i told you in rwanda 
   it still burns  
  no  the other thing 
   stop watching me sleep  
  i said 
   we are not friends at all  
  we re best friends 
  and to watch your back 
  can i wash your back  yeah 
  oh  i remember 
  watch your back 
lot of back  i got you 
hey  same old hobbs  huh 
same old locke 
all right  who s on the case 
 indistinct announcement on pa 
mr  shaw 
whatever it is  i ain t buying it 
you don t know what i m selling 
or who i am 
cia 
  how could you   
  sunglasses  cloudy day 
sensible shoes 
 stammers  i have fallen arches 
and i don t have
a lot of choice in what i   
anyway  i m agent loeb 
and i need to talk to you
about our shared interest 
hey  how d you find me 
i got a tip from an acquaintance of yours 
mr  nobody 
mr  nobody 
little joke for you  loeb 
what do  uh  cia operatives
and baseballs have in common 
people cheer when you hit them with a bat 
no 
they are two things
i don t give a toss about 
that works too 
agent loeb  the weapon she s stolen
is not like anything we ve ever seen 
it s a programmable disease
that can target any dna sequence
with a 100  mortality rate
inside 72 hours 
if mi6 finds her 
they re gonna treat her like a traitor 
mi6 agent 1  we need you
to surrender the virus 
what is your location 
what  you think i killed them 
agent loeb  but if you help us find her 
if you bring us the virus 
we ll grant her immunity 
we ve set up a black site here in london 
you ve got everything you
could need at your disposal 
and we re bringing in an asset
from the states to assist you 
i don t need anybody 
maybe not  mr  shaw 
but she does 
 inhales deeply 
  my guy s in 
  my guy s in too 
hey  is your guy gonna freak out
when he finds out who my guy is 
i mean  didn t they just do
a job together in new york 
didn t they just destroy
the dss field office in la
by throwing each other through it 
i don t know  look 
i don t know about your guy 
but my guy 
he s gonna get this 
he s gonna pull this off  you know why 
we ve been best friends
our whole goddamn lives 
well  my guy beat the shit out of me
at a bar in krakã³w 17 years ago 
and he doesn t even remember me 
so we all have our histories 
anyway  it s the fate of the world here 
it s the fate of the world 
the planet s population is in their hands 
serious stuff 
i mean  you d think
they d be able to put aside
any petty rivalries to save the world 
 slurping  mmm  mmm 
  no fucking way 
  no fucking way 
i m not working with this guy 
i been there  done that 
the minute he gets involved 
you can kiss goodbye to any finesse 
because she hulk here
only knows how to smash 
and mr  arson here only knows
how to blow shit up 
  the fact is   
  and the fact is   
     no offense   
     oh  no offense   
     this guy s a real asshole 
     this guy s a real asshole 
that s  uh   sumbitch 
in your native tongue 
that d be  wanker  in your native tongue 
are you finished blubbering 
you sound like a giant tattooed baby

while you re still
putting on your baby oil 
  good luck  slick 
   snaps fingers 
that s it  you just reminded me 
that s exactly why
i hate working with you 
it s your voice 
it s your nasally  prepubescent 
harry potter voice 
every time you speak 
just imagine this for a second 
it s like dragging my balls
across shattered glass 
  and it hurts 
  well  for me 
it s not your voice 
it s your face 
your big  stupid face 
looking at it makes me feel
like god is projectile vomiting
right in my eyes 
and it burns 
it really burns 
what you gonna do now 
throw a bit of furniture 
for your information  i was gonna
take this chair and turn it sideways
and shove it right down your throat 
of course you are 
 cause that s your answer to everything 
smash a hole through every problem
in a massive truck 
  that s not gonna work here 
  ah  i think it ll work fine 
cia agent  guys 
why don t you two take a seat
and we ll talk through this 
me and you  us  i ve been down this road 
it s a total waste of time 
for once  i couldn t agree with you more 
yeah  well  i m doing this my way 
if anyone s got a problem with that 
i suggest you come out here and stop me 
i m not going in there 
well  i m not going in there 
smart lads 
hobbs  all right

 computer trills

 hip hop music playing

 groans  look    whoa  hold on 
 grunting 
 mercs groaning 
stop 
 both grunting 
jeez 
 grunting 
 grunting 
hey  no

 distorted  perfection is
a painful process  brixton 
in ourselves and in the
pursuit of a perfect world 
humanity must evolve
before it destroys itself 
eteon will carve out
  all human weakness   
   brixton screaming 
   and replace it
with mechanical perfection 
and you will lead the way 
i m gonna ask you a question 
it s not what you think it is 
do you like to dance 
 smacks lips  what  the electric slide 
the macarena  no  i don t 
no  no  no  i was thinking
about    the tango 
  where it takes two 
  yeah  don t know that one 
must be different generations 
 laughing 
yeah  well  either way  the music started 
so let s see what kind of rhythm you have 
  where s the virus 
  look  i told you 
i ve no idea what you re talking about 
okay  that hurt 
you just stepped on my toes 
that didn t feel good 
let s try it again 
i think you re better than that 
  where s the virus 
  i didn t ask to dance 
and why should i talk to you 
you re not cia 
no  how do you know that 
where shall i start 
there s two types of cia agents 
intelligence and espionage 
those guys over there
can barely lift a pencil 
that s what intelligence agents look like 
you look like you could
pick up a building 
but espionage is about blending in
and about being subtle 
and there is nothing subtle about you 
yeah 
that s good 
  i m impressed 
  i didn t kill anybody 
i know you didn t 
how do you know that  then 
because you can learn a lot
about somebody when you fight them 
and when we fought 
you weren t fighting to kill me 
you were fighting to run away 
but either way  the world thinks that
you re a murderer and a thief 
so you re not going anywhere
or getting any goddamn phone call
until you give me some real answers 
you have no idea what is happening here 
then tell me  help me understand 
i can t  you re wasting my time 
then i can t either   
you re wasting time 
virus gets in the wrong hands 
that s it  it s game over 
 cell phone ringing 
 chuckles 
 ringing continues 
does that mean it s time for curls 
just like the cia 
always flexing the wrong muscle 
you know  the mind is the
strongest muscle in the body 
maybe you should try exercising that
a little bit more 
 there s more wisdom in your body
 than in your deepest philosophies  
ooh  let me guess  that bruce lee 
 chuckles  no  nietzsche 
 cause i m flexing this 
and all of that 
come here 
if she moves  i want you to shoot her 
woman  yeah  he can t shoot me 
  yeah  not allowed 
  in the face 
you can t  not in the face 
you d go to prison 
you can shoot her right in the face 
no  you can t  you d go to prison  sorry 
i want you to shoot her
two times right in that face 
  okay 
  yeah

shaw  eteon  they re a secret tech cult 
with a mercenary army
and plenty of dark money 
and delusions of saving the world
by augmenting the human race 
brixton  that s it 
apparently they control the media as well 
heard rumors about these people 
everybody thinks they re a myth 
shaw  i ve seen it firsthand
how real they are 
if you don t fit into their plans 
you ve already dug your own grave 
all right  let s get to the
nearest lockdown facility   
hey  no  no  no  you don t get it  do you 
brixton s a tier one assassin 
best i ve ever seen  i know him 
he ain t never gonna stop
until he gets that virus 
and besides  that s my sister 
family business 
is your name shaw  no 
then she s going nowhere with you 
when it comes to the fate of the world 
it becomes my business 
i don t care if she s your sister 
that woman ain t going anywhere   
  where are you going 
  i m going away 
i don t have time for your
alpha male shit right now 
you re both idiots 
you clearly can t work together
and so you re absolutely useless to me 
so i m gonna go find the man
who can help me get this thing
out of my system 
  see ya 
  hobbs  you mean this man 
i was tracking him before the attack 
he s hard to find but i think
i got a hell of a lead 
russian newspaper 
not just any old paper 
there s only one place
in london that sells that 
 andreiko speaking russian 
thank you  see you tomorrow 
 speaking russian 
that s a bit optimistic 
 grunts 
call the director 
 line ringing 
director   distorted 
well  well  deckard shaw 
how complicated for you 
not really 
he s also working with dss  luke hobbs 
director  hobbs  we have a history 
they re formidable 
small fry 
i ll eliminate the two of them 
get the asset back asap 
director  you get the girl 
extract the virus
and reprogram it for phase one 
we use that weapon to eliminate the weak
and anyone who would get in our way 
we re building
the perfect system  brixton 
hobbs and shaw can be
considerable assets for eteon 
turn them 
 turn  em  
sorry  i don t follow 
director  i want them turned 
i want them working for the cause 
understood 
they can t be turned 
director  what makes you so certain 
the last time we asked 
i got shot in the face 
that makes me very certain 
so  i suggest
that we take another approach 
which is why   
director  i m not asking  brixton 
you show them the consequences of refusal 
or perhaps i ll show them to you 
is that a threat 
director  i d remember
who you re relying on
for your survival 
all for the cause 
look  honey  i have to talk
to you about something 
it s very important right now 
remember how we spoke about
what would happen if things went sideways 
we called it a  code red  
well  it s happening 
is there anything i can do 
you need to stay home 
you re gonna be safe there 
as a matter of fact  we ve got the cia
listening in on this call right now 
watch this  hi  locke 
everybody s safe  everybody s great 
i m actually at  uh  our old diner here 
it s super weird being here
without you guys 
think it s closed 
thank you  brother 
honey  i ve already talked to aunt lisa 
she knows exactly what to do 
i m gonna be home as soon as i can 
  love you 
  i love you back 
goodbye 
luke hobbs and deckard shaw 
while hobbs is an agent in the american   
tell us everything you know about this 
my god 
  when were you exposed 
  hattie  about 30 hours ago 
then the capsules containing
the virus are still intact 
so we need to neutralize it 
no  it is not that easy 
it s not programmed to any dna sequence 
it s fatal to everyone 
in 42 hours  the capsules will dissolve 
and she will be infected 
then the virus will go airborne 
we are talking global
contamination within a week 
why in the hell would you
create something like that 
because i thought i was one of them 
eteon 
they told me they wanted to
save the world through science 
i believed in their cause 
i developed the snowflake
to be a carrier for vaccines 
a panacea for the whole world 
but they redeveloped it into
a programmable apocalypse 
to attack the weakest of us 
those not worthy of eteon s
vision of the future 
for a scientist 
you seem incredibly stupid 
well  i m a two times nobel prize winner 
but who s counting 
all right  you said
the virus is programmable 
so    reprogram it 
i can t reprogram it in a host 
just tell us how to get
this thing out from me 
well  there are two options 
and the first is easy 
  go 
  finally 
  you kill her 
  excuse me 
oh  and burn the body  of course 
  of course 
  of course 
no  i mean really burn it 
  really burn it 
  to ash 
  to ash 
  beyond all recognition 
let s assume that that s not an option 
shall we  genius 
yeah  it doesn t work for us 
option number two 
there is a machine
that could preserve her life
and extract the virus 
that should ve been option number one 
because it s impossible to get to 
we ll decide what s impossible 
where is it 
it s in the eteon laboratory
where the snowflake was developed 
a secret dark tech complex
fortified by an army
in the most godforsaken
part of the planet 
but if you go there 
all three of you will die 
so basically what you re saying is
she dies no matter what 
well  who needs a drink 
i know just the place 
 funk music playing 
wow  look at all these 
somebody s overcompensating 
if anything  i m under compensating 
hobbs  and a teeny tiny one 
 chuckles  just your size 
shaw  used it for a job over in italy 
shame we didn t need
a weightlifting bus driver 
  would ve given you a call 
   laughs 
drink 
yeah  i ll take a little one 
i ll write to someone in moscow 
an old friend 
yeah  we have a long history 
she and her crew are paying
a visit to some locals 
particular russian criminal element 
they have things that we re gonna need 
considering your history with friends 
how many bullets you put
in this one s head 
they can set us up with gear 
and i don t hear any other ideas 
you know as well as i do
getting out of this country
is gonna be extremely difficult 
we have every major intelligence agency
already hunting us down 
hattie  and there s the fact
that you disgraced mi6
when you betrayed your team 
don t believe everything
they tell you  hat 
smile 
 camera shutter clicks 
no  regular back channels
aren t gonna work this time 
we re gonna have to
do our best to blend in 
hattie  hide in plain sight 
that s why we ll be flying commercial 
commercial  we re gonna get spotted
  too easy at   
   camera shutter clicks 
don t worry that pea sized brain 
i handled it 
cloned our cell phone signals
around the world 
should buy us at least 48 hours 
we ll pick up new gear
when we get to moscow 
should get us past the
wandering eyes at the airport 
this is probably the only thing
that s gonna fit 
fit what  a smurf 
i think that s one of my old ones 
i apologize in advance
if it s a little loose around the balls 
 laughs 
okay  what do we got  tough guy  come on 
shaw  i ve created new identities
and altered your biometric profiles
so the airport scanners don t recognize
your faces or your fingerprints 
you re sarah atkins 
you work in insurance 
hello 
 trills 
  thank you 
  thanks 
shaw  i m franz gruber 
i m a freelance architect 
avid mountain climber

they ve stopped him for what  exactly 
whatever it is 
it s gonna involve rubber gloves
and a body cavity search 
let s go 
 dog barking 
hands on your head  oxmaul 
hattie  can t believe you did that 
he was gonna slow us down 
 passengers chattering 
we can t pull this off  we both know it 
it s bad enough
i got this thing in my blood
that s gonna kill me and everyone else 
but were you seriously gonna
break this mysterious machine
out of some high security
death virus complex
and magically get it to work 
frankly  that sounds completely   
you still wear that silly thing 
didn t know you still had that 
put the pin back in 
you haven t changed 
wish i could say the same about you 
hey  you re gonna be okay 
we re gonna make this work 
it s what we do 
and what if we don t 
what if the only option is for you to   
it s not happening 
hi  i m here  i m michael 
hi  yeah 
hello  all right 
oh  yeah  let s see  where s my seat 
f one  f two   
f you 
hey 
you are an asshole 
you were quicker than i thought 
yup  because i have a secret weapon 
people actually like me 
you wouldn t understand that
because you don t have any friends 
i love your babushka 
 gasps 
 seat squeaks 
couldn t have booked an emergency row
for a little bit more legroom  huh 
not everybody has hobbit legs like you 
hey  look  in case you didn t realize 
i couldn t give a damn about your comfort 
so why don t you be a good elephant 
suck up another kilo of peanuts 
put your chair back and relax 
all right  listen 
don t ever tell me to relax  all right 
don t tell me to do anything 
any time you ever say anything 
it makes me want to take my boot
and shove it so far up your ass 
you re gonna be spitting out
shoelaces all week 
hey  you know what the problem is 
i ll tell you the problem  this job 
this job requires stealth 
and you    look at you 
i mean  granted  it s not your fault 
but you re too obvious 
you stick out  like balls on a bulldog 
dangling down in all the wrong places 
seemingly harmless 
and the next thing you know 
they re trying to impregnate your sister 
 scoffs  what 
  impregnate your sister 
  you heard 
oh 
now i get it 
you do  good  i m glad 
  hobbs  mmm hmm 
  yeah  i m glad 
  i m very glad 
  you actually think that
i m going through all this effort 
on this mission 
trying to save the world 
by the way  for a fourth time 
because i m really good at it 
you think i m going through all of this
just so i can do the horizontal hula 
sexy  sexy time with your sister 
not all  most 
let me break it down for you  frodo 
this ain t 1955 anymore  all right 
despite the fact that that girl
sleeping right there is related to you 
she s still one of the toughest 
baddest  most capable women
i ve ever encountered in my entire life 
and if she chooses to look the way
of this big  brown 
well endowed  tattooed mountain of a man 
then guess what 
i m gonna let her climb this mountain
over and over and over again 
you stay away from her 
i see what you re doing 
you think i m stupid 
of course i think you re stupid 
but you know what  i ll do you a favor 
i ll knock that dumb
right out of your skull 
you just say the word  jack 
you know what i wanna do 
i wanna do an irish jig
on your arse ugly face at 30 000 feet 
  oh  30 000 feet

is air and opportunity 
 inhales sharply  and there goes the air 
  bring it on  don ho

i want our property
out of that girl s blood 
no  the virus is too dangerous  i can t 
brixton  humans must evolve  professor 
without eteon s upgrades 
the human body s
really not worth that much 
maybe 11 pence worth of magnesium 
couple of pence worth of calcium 
little bit of iron 
not worth much 
i d say  all in all 
probably about three pound 
three pound fifty  max 
the entirety of a man s worth 
small change 
you re gonna reprogram that virus for me 
 stammers  i won t 
 screams 
 rock music playing 
 muffled grunting 
 glass smashes 
 yells indistinctly 
hobbs  ah  your friend s
a russian mobster 
shaw  this girl steals
from russian mobsters 
actually  she steals from everyone 
it s kind of her thing 
deckard shaw 
margarita 
oh  i did not see that coming 
i wish i didn t see that at all 
me too 
margarita  i got your list 
it s long 
i asked for a house on a runway 
not sure a dozen russians
in duct tape were on the list 
well  give me more than three hour notice 
and i wouldn t have to
resort to such extremes 
not sure three hours has anything to do
with your extremes  margarita 
margarita  quã  mierda  deckard 
eteon  could you pick
a harder place to break into 
we need to find the c 17
viral extraction machine 
could be anywhere 
that facility is three square miles
of research labs 
yeah  and it s a powder keg
packed with munitions 
we ve gotta pull a mick jagger 
this sounds like a fun game 
we re not getting you on the inside  no 
when deck and i were kids 
we d spend our time
coming up with these grifts 
a  mick jagger  was a job
that required one person to showboat
to draw all the eyes while
the others made the music 
a typical inside job 
guys  you heard andreiko 
they have to use the extraction machine 
so they ll take me right to it 
no  i can do it 
we can do it 
so now the only question is
how to ring eteon s dinner bell 
oh  i can handle that part 
but first  let s get you geared up 
these are your halo parachutes 
earbuds for encrypted communication 
scorpion evo 3 with optical sights 
ultra thin bullet resisting kevlar 
infrared cameras for seeing through walls 
and last but not least 
compact hydrogen detonator 
put it in the right spot 
it ll blow the place sky high 
how do i look 
looks a little tight 
how you holding up 
you know  if things go south in there 
you can t leave me alive 
we re gonna get you out of there 
let me tell you something else 
 the key to immortality
 is first living a life
worth remembering  
  is that more nietzsche 
  nah 
  that s bruce lee 
   laughing 
come on 
brixton  how d you find her 
margarita  you ve heard about me 
i m good at my job 
brixton  was she alone 
yeah 
if you re lying to me 
i will cut your heart out 
do you understand 
i d be afraid if i had one 
 airplane engine humming 
now that s a ride 
what a ride 
i got shotgun 
  i got shotgun 
  no  no  no  don t start 
i got shotgun 
we re entering the drop zone 
  are you ready 
  yeah  i m ready 
  on my three 
  okay 
  one 
  uh uh 
  shaw   yelps  you asshole 
  whoo 
hobbs  nobody tells me what to do 
 indistinct chatter 
so  i m intrigued 
do you wash the blood off your hands
before you count your money
or is it afterwards 
dismissed 
you don t get it  do you 
you know  the weak deal with money 
we deal with evolutionary change 
change that sometimes require
acts of violence 
like killing innocent people with viruses 
only the weak ones 
we re dealing with the future
of the planet 
things that money cannot buy 
oh  like your soul back 
my soul 
your brother took my soul 
the boys in the lab made me a new one 
now  that s progress 
 guard groans 
brixton  welcome to the
extraction room  miss shaw 
get her ready 
it won t be long 
hobbs  i tell you 
we ain t gonna want to be here
when this thing goes off 
 device beeps 
looks like she s 400 yards through there 
looks like they re holding her
in some sort of medical pod 
timer s set for 45 minutes 
we get in and get out 
blow this death factory to pieces 
remember the hallway 
no guns 
hobbs  right  those guys have to be alive 
because at the end of the hallway
the retinal scanner needs
a match to open the door 
  pick a door 
  i m right there 
nope  that s my door 
what s the matter with you 
 scanner trills  beeping 
i made a mistake  this is your door 
oh  no  no backsies  what s the matter

i just dreamt they killed you
before i woke up 
pretty disappointed right now 
it s a little elaborate  i must admit 
old school interrogation technique
we picked up in black ops 
shock will kill a man in three 
do you remember that  deck 
yeah  i remember
a lot of things from back then 
i reckon you ve only got
four shocks in you  boys 
yeah  i think we could take five 
 five   well  all right 
   electricity crackling 
   both groaning 
 both panting 
you had to open your big mouth  didn t ya 
i thought it was a cool thing
to say in the moment 
 hattie grunts 
 man groaning 
do you remember
when we were real brothers 
task force black 
do you remember that  deck 
man  we ended up
seeing the worst in people 
worst in our countries  our leaders 
our enemies  our friends 
you don t know the meaning
of that word anymore 
but don t worry about it  neither does he 
he shoots them right in the head 
but in your case  i thought
it was hell of a good idea 
big man  you still talking 
i said i thought it was
a hell of a good   
   electricity crackling 
   grunts 
 both groaning 
   grunts 
  oh 
shit 
 chuckles 
you know  it s funny how
humanity s hate for each other
is stronger than
its own self preservation 
which is why we re here 
remember eight years ago  deck 
when eteon asked us to join their mission 
oh  you mean their death cult 
  they re lunatics 
  visionaries 
visionaries of a future 
a bigger future  a brighter future 
you remember the data they gave us  man 
what with environmental damage 
capitalism  terrorism 
humanity wipes itself out by 2096 
now  that is scary to me 
but if we fulfill eteon s vision 
you save their world 
you don t save the world with genocide 
genocide  schmenocide 
you know what this virus is 
this virus is a necessary
shock to the system 
   electricity crackling 
   groans 
 muffled scream 
 both groaning 
 gasping 
whoo  that s three 
 snickers 
i love this thing 
told you then  i m telling you now 
your metrics are off 
one good reason 
you assume the worst in people 
people cannot be trusted
to do the right thing 
look at the two of you 
the fate of the world is in your hands 
and you can t even get along 
but you know all about
doing the right thing 
don t you  shaw  yeah 
little souvenir  huh  bro 
you come to kill me 
i ll do the same every time 
what d you expect  a shiatsu 
 chuckles 
anyone talking to you 
your mama 
   electricity crackling 
   groaning 
  yeah 
   both grunt 
 laughs 
brixton  i get it  you re still mad 
you re upset because 
hey  when you wouldn t turn 
they asked me to come and kill you
and  of course  i had to
because you knew too much 
but i think about that night a lot 
i think about it 
because what i realize now
that i did not realize then
is that when you shot me 
you gave me a gift 
look at me  i m black superman 
bulletproof  new spine 
and the more machine i become 
the more humane i am 
this is what you wanna fight for 
i m giving you another chance
to join us  deckard 
and the boss wants big mouth as well 
if not  i kill you both 
which  honestly  i d love to do 
you know eteon 
you know what they re capable of 
they rebuilt me  dismantled him 
made it look like he killed his own team 
even your own sister    disowned you 
just say the word  bro 
say the word and all of this goes away 
your sister lives  his daughter lives 
we get you some upgrades 
and we go on to saving the world 
what s it to be 
join the evolution of man 
or die with the weak 
just get it done 
 scoffs

started coming around again 
taking a real interest in his sons 
the truth is 
he was just looking for a new crew 
and i was the only one
to see through those lies 
 hobbs sighs 
so the jobs my dad pulled
me and my brothers into
just got bigger and more dangerous 
then eventually he knew 
and he was okay with 
getting me and my brothers killed 
so i turned him in 
or you protected your family 
so after i put him away 
i left samoa and i never came back 
well  at least one good thing came out
of me jamming that thing into my hand
