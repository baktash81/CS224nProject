i was 
i was afraid
that you wouldn t be mature
enough to understand 
annie  when you connect with
someone the way that we connected
when you find a soul mate the
way that we found each other
then nothing else matters 
i thought you were old
enough to understand that 
i mean  you made me think you
could handle this  annie 
i mean  this
is ridiculous 
i mean 
it s me  charlie 
the same guy that you ve been talking
to every day and every night

she was assaulted
by her alleged
boyfriend three days ago 
she hasn t
got a boyfriend 
well  apparently
on saturday

  gail 
  ah  this is special agent doug tate with the fbi 
  hi 
fbi 
 doug  well  any time
a crime is committed
against a child
using the internet
and the suspect
is a traveler
someone from out of
state  they call us in 
look  annie  i know
you ve had a rough day 
but i need to ask you a couple of questions 
you feel up for it 
do we have
to do this now 
trust me  the sooner we start
this investigation  the better 
gail  do we still have the clothes
she was wearing that night

mrs  cameron
i would like to talk to annie alone 
could you please just  
look  i ve had
enough of this 
this is our daughter 
we wanna be with her 
 gail  you ve got to
understand that right now
annie s a victim of a crime and you
and your wife are just witnesses 
that s why we interview
everybody separately
so as not to contaminate
anyone s testimony 
now if you can just give
annie and i a second alone
and then i ll come
back to your house
and we can all
sit down and talk 
fair enough 
 lynn  so how long
will this take 
well  it depends if we get enough
genetic material to run a profile 
and if there is 
how long 
right now  there s
a nationwide backlog 
in illinois alone  we ve
got 2 000 unopened kits
sitting in freezers
waiting to be processed 
some people have been
waiting a year 
  what    how is that possible 
we ll run this through
the fbi facilities

a month on the outside

the family computer

i got you a new cell 
now  you have
to promise me
that you re not

i m gonna have
to check the bills 
and if i find out that
you ve tried to contact him
i m gonna have
to take it back 
okay

i m still glad 
i want this
to be a place
for you to feel
safe and comfortable
talking about anything 
i just wanna
be helpful to you 
you think
i need help 
i think that what you ve been
through must be very difficult 
you know  what s
the big deal 
there are girls
at my school
who ve had sex
with half the football team 
i lose my virginity
and my parents
make a federal case
out of it 
literally 
i think they re
more concerned
that you may have
been in danger
more than anything else 
danger 
that s  cause
they don t know him 
you know 
the thing is
i bet my dad would
really like him
if they d met 
you know  before 
what is it about him you think
your father would like 
he s sweet  and smart 
and really funny 
and gives great advice and
which  by the way  worked 
i i made the team
because of him 
you think that s the only
reason you made the team 
because of his advice 
and not your own ability 
well  he s older 
he s been playing longer 
what d you think
about him being older 
at first i thought
he was 16  okay 
and then  all of a sudden
he s 20 and i m like  what 
and then we kept talking
and i was  like 
what s the big deal 
he gets me  you know 
he s not judgmental 
he s encouraging 
and despite my age difference
he still loves me 
and he thinks
i m beautiful 
what d you think
about him
not being honest
about his age 
you know 
charlie said that
when you connect
like we did
when you find
that soul mate
that s the only thing
to think about 
don t you believe that when
two people are in love
nothing else matters 
i can understand how strong
those feelings are  annie 
but  there are reasons why
girls your age and men his
aren t supposed
to be together 
whatever 
he loves me 
i know he does 
and he s dying
to call me or email me
but he knows it s no  safe
thanks to my parents
and the fbi 
i just  
what 
i just hope he s okay 
 suspense music 
what  he go to lunch early 
he went home 
said he wasn t feeling well 
hello 
will  it s agent tate 
i wanted to give
you an update 
now  look  the motel
didn t give us much 
he paid cash
for the room 
he told the manager
he lost his wallet 
he even ordered a credit
card right in front of him 
the  uh  the cell phone was prepaid 
it was purchased in st  louis 
he paid cash for that 
too  whoever he is 
so his name s not
charles hightower 
yeah  not that
we can tell 
i found seven of them living
in the u s  so far
but none of  em
fit the description 
there  s nothing that even
confirms he s from california
we  uh  we actually traced his ip
address to the czech republic 
what 
it seems he s running some
sort of ghost program 
it s a software
that basically bounces
his ip address from
one server to another
all over the world 
sir 
sorry  i don t understand 
what does that mean 
it means he s good
at what he s doing 
but don t worry  don t worry 
this is exactly how it starts 
you need to go on through 
go get your stuff 
yeah  one minute  please 
what about the car 
anything 
hang up the phone  sir 
it was an airport rental 
he must ve swapped the plates

offenders in the neighborhood

i need you to look
through them 
why 
in case one of them s charlie

 suspense music 
 annie  i ve gotta
get out of my house 
how come  what s
happening at home 
you know  they think i m stupid
for meeting up with him 
going back to his hotel 
they said that 
my dad looks at me
like i m an idiot 
he wants to kill charlie 
that s all he talks about 
getting his hands on him 
well  what would you do if
he got in touch with you
have you thought about what
you would say to him 
i just wanna talk to him 
hear his voice 
see how his mom s doing 
and his little dog 
see how we re gonna
make this work 
i just wanna talk to him
about what happened 
we haven  i really
talked about that
about what happened
in the motel 
are we supposed to 
in my experience 
it helps  it really does 
but only if you re ready 
li  s kind of weird 
you know 
like it wasn t really
happening to me 
like i was watching it
from above 
sometimes when you can t
physically escape from a situation
where you feel frightened
or threatened
you find a way to remove or
distance yourself psychologically 
it s a way
of protecting yourself 
does that make sense 
still have ten minutes 
yeah  well 
i ll see you later 
 al  chicago has a very
strong sense of history 
kinda like when they bought marshall
fields  turned it into a macy s 
they lost half
their client base 
 will  it s a fine line 
you want a fresh look
but you don t want to alienate
your loyal customers 
we loved what you

my problem is you lied to me  sweetheart 
from the second that you knew he

you lied 
why didn t you come and
talk to me or your mother
and say what was going on 
when you found out
for the first time  what  
what were you thinking 
you didn t know then that
something was wrong 
when you  you met him in the mall
and saw him for the first time
what do you do  you don t call me

how annie s doing 
you know i can t discuss her

she s my daughter 
a minor 
if she needed
an appendectomy
you d need my signature
for surgery  right 
therapy is different

none of this makes
sense to me

starting to  
what s going on 
i cannot stop
thinking about it 
i m driving my car
whatever  in the office 
in a meeting
and i think about him
on top of her 
the other night i had this dream 
i d got him 
i was beating
the life out of him 
i was on top of him
and i was punching him
and punching him
and his face was caving in
there was blood
going everywhere
and i could actually
taste it 
i woke up  i found i d actually
chewed the inside of my mouth 
it s my own blood
i was tasting 
what if they did catch him and they put him in jail him 
how would that make you feel 
good  relieved 
angry 
why angry 
because i d still
want to rip
his fucking head off
and now i couldn t 
what else are you
angry about 
i m angry i didn t know
what was going on 
i m angry that annie
lied to me 
that i didn t know the extent
of her intimacy with him 
that i couldn t  
what 
stop it 
we can t control what happens
to us or our loved ones 
what happens when annie
goes to college 
what are you saying 
people get hurt 
there s only
so much we can do
to protect ourselves 
our children 
the only thing
we can do
is we can be there
for each other
when we do fall down 
to pick each other up

 doug 
okay  good news 
we ran the dna
from his shirt
through the national database 
and we actually
found a match 
that s  that s incredible 
so what happens now 
you arrest him 
 doug 
it s not that easy 
while the dna is
on the database
it s still a john doe  we
don t know who it belongs to 
i don t
understand 
well  there were
other cases  will
three of them  where
rapes were reported 
we were able to recover
genetic material
from the victim
and the crime scene 
the dna profile
is the same 
it s just that we don t know
who it belongs to 
so he s done this before 
  yes  he has 
   lynn  oh  my god 
well  he s had other girlfriends before 
i told you that 
these weren t
girlfriends  annie 
these were minors
who reported a rape 
well  dna can be wrong 
the odds of these four samples
not coming from the same person
are in the hundreds of millions 
it s the same guy 
now  look  we  uh  we
don t normally do this 
we  re very careful
with victim information 
but i m hoping there
might be some kind
of connection between
all four of you girls 
maybe you went to
the same camp together
you shopped
at the same mall 
i can t give you their names
but i was hoping that
you might take a look
at their pictures 
 lynn  wait a minute 
i don t know if this is a good idea 
no  no  i want 
i want to  yeah 
all right  annie  do
you know this girl

it looks that way  yeah 
look  on the upside  will there s
more information for us

evidence for us 
the investigation is seeing
a real breakthrough 
i bet the agent in st 
louis said the same thing
to some family
about seven months ago 
i understand your
frustration  will  i do

you were two 
peter was scared to death
the first time he went in 
he screamed and cried so
much  he didn t stop 
he was fine in the
bath  but pool   
not you 
you were fearless 
i remember 
you were amazing 
came in with me and almost
immediately started laughing
and playing and
splashing around 
you just had
this confidence 
it wasn t just swimming 
you just had this  
trust  in things  people 
the world 
it was who you were 
no fear 
god  i loved that 
i was so proud of it 
i envied it 
and i was so afraid that you d
lose it as you grew up 
that confidence 
that faith 
but you didn t 
and then i failed you 
it was my job to make
sure you didn t lose it 
to keep you safe 
what am i if i
can t protect you 
and to see you lose
that confidence
to see you
question yourself 
that the idea would
even occur to you
to want to hurt yourself 
or for you to think
for one minute
that you weren t
as beautiful  
i don t know if you can
ever forgive me  annie
