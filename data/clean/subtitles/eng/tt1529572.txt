she calls charlie
at a motel where she
was sexually assaulted
the man is at least
35 years old

hi
fbi
doug well any time
a crime is committed
against a child
using the internet
and the suspect
is a traveler
someone from out of
state they call us in
look annie i know
youve had a rough day
but i need to ask you a couple of questions
you feel up for it

yeah i guess
mr cameron
mrs cameron
i would like to talk to annie alone
could you please just
look ive had
enough of this
this is our daughter
we wanna be with her
gail youve got to
understand that right now
annies a victim of a crime and you
and your wife are just witnesses
thats why we interview
everybody separately
so as not to contaminate
anyones testimony
now if you can just give
annie and i a second alone
and then ill come
back to your house
and we can all
sit down and talk
fair enough
lynn so how long
will this take
well it depends if we get enough
genetic material to run a profile
and if there is
how long
right now theres
a nationwide backlog
in illinois alone weve
got 2000 unopened kits
sitting in freezers
waiting to be processed
some people have been
waiting a year
what  how is that possible
well run this through
the fbi facilities
so two weeks
a month on the outside

this wasnt rape
now that guy is 20 years
older than she is
he groomed her for weeks just
to get her into the motel room
and shes armed with what
the eighthgrade biology
and the expectation that the
world is a decent place
im gonna fucking

no more of this bullshit
good
is there
any more coffee
grab another coffee
will hey
i got you a new cell
now you have
to promise me
that youre not
gonna try and call him
or text him
with this new number
remember what tate
said about the old one
that if he tries to call you on
that you tell us immediately
im gonna have
to check the bills
and if i find out that
youve tried to contact him
im gonna have
to take it back
okay
so what do i just start
talking like tony soprano
boy i hope not
chuckles softly
im glad you came
yeah well my parents
said i had to
well even so
im still glad
i want this
to be a place
for you to feel
safe and comfortable
talking about anything
i just wanna
be helpful to you
you think
i need help
i think that what youve been
through must be very difficult
you know whats
the big deal
there are girls
at my school
whove had sex
with half the football team
i lose my virginity
and my parents
make a federal case
out of it
literally
i think theyre
more concerned
that you may have
been in danger
more than anything else
danger
thats cause
they dont know him
you know
the thing is
i bet my dad would
really like him
if theyd met
you know before
what is it about him you think
your father would like
hes sweet and smart
and really funny
and gives great advice and
which by the way worked
ii made the team
because of him
you think thats the only
reason you made the team
because of his advice
and not your own ability
well hes older
hes been playing longer
whatd you think
about him being older
at first i thought
he was 16 okay
and then all of a sudden
hes 20 and im like what
and then we kept talking
and i was like
whats the big deal
he gets me you know
hes not judgmental
hes encouraging
and despite my age difference
he still loves me
and he thinks
im beautiful
whatd you think
about him
not being honest
about his age
you know
charlie said that
when you connect
like we did
when you find
that soul mate
thats the only thing
to think about
dont you believe that when
two people are in love
nothing else matters
i can understand how strong
those feelings are annie
but there are reasons why
girls your age and men his
arent supposed
to be together
whatever
he loves me
i know he does
and hes dying
to call me or email me
but he knows its no safe
thanks to my parents
and the fbi
i just
what
i just hope hes okay
suspense music
what he go to lunch early
he went home
said he wasnt feeling well
hello
will its agent tate
i wanted to give
you an update
now look the motel
didnt give us much
he paid cash
for the room
he told the manager
he lost his wallet
he even ordered a credit
card right in front of him
the uh the cell phone was prepaid
it was purchased in st louis
he paid cash for that
too whoever he is
so his names not
charles hightower
yeah not that
we can tell
i found seven of them living
in the us so far
but none of em
fit the description
there s nothing that even
confirms hes from california
we uh we actually traced his ip
address to the czech republic
what
it seems hes running some
sort of ghost program
its a software
that basically bounces
his ip address from
one server to another
all over the world
sir
sorry i dont understand
what does that mean
it means hes good
at what hes doing
but dont worry dont worry
this is exactly how it starts
you need to go on through
go get your stuff
yeah one minute please
what about the car
anything
hang up the phone sir
it was an airport rental
he mustve swapped the plates
gary
will look im ill have
to call you back okay
seriously is
my conversation
that much of a threat
to security
thank you sir
is it over
yeah you missed
a pretty good fight
lynn when they do real
housewives of chicago
i am so auditioning

i talked to jennie
brittanys really upset

but it went to voice mail
did you eat
have a look
at this a second
you wont believe this
typing
what is this
this is the national
sex offenders registry
theres perverts all over
wilmette not just chicago
see this all
these red dots
theyre everywhere
oh my god
this guy here is literally
three blocks away on linden

lynn pervert tracker
what is this
its a group
i met with today
will supposed to be the best in the country
they hunt predators
today it says
theyre in new jersey
you were in new jersey today

suspense music
annie ive gotta
get out of my house
how come whats
happening at home
you know they think im stupid
for meeting up with him
going back to his hotel
they said that
my dad looks at me
like im an idiot
he wants to kill charlie
thats all he talks about
getting his hands on him
well what would you do if
he got in touch with you
have you thought about what
you would say to him
i just wanna talk to him
hear his voice
see how his moms doing
and his little dog
see how were gonna
make this work
i just wanna talk to him
about what happened
we haven i really
talked about that
about what happened
in the motel
are we supposed to
in my experience
it helps it really does
but only if youre ready
li s kind of weird
you know
like it wasnt really
happening to me
like i was watching it
from above
sometimes when you cant
physically escape from a situation
where you feel frightened
or threatened
you find a way to remove or
distance yourself psychologically
its a way
of protecting yourself
does that make sense
still have ten minutes
yeah well
ill see you later
al chicago has a very
strong sense of history
kinda like when they bought marshall
fields turned it into a macys
they lost half

and his face was caving in
there was blood
going everywhere

want to rip
his fucking head off

what are you saying

thats enough
annie
what
you can tell everybody
about my life
about me having sex and who

not to tell him
thats the only
thing i asked
thank you dad
i hope you guys
have an awesome time
lynn honey
please please stay
annie
no no let me go
doug
okay good news
we ran the dna
from his shirt
through the national database
and we actually
found a match
thats thats incredible
so what happens now
you arrest him
doug
its not that easy
while the dna is
on the database
its still a john doe we
dont know who it belongs to
i dont
understand
well there were
other cases will
three of them where
rapes were reported
we were able to recover
genetic material
from the victim
and the crime scene
the dna profile
is the same
its just that we dont know
who it belongs to
so hes done this before
yes he has
lynn oh my god
well hes had other girlfriends before
i told you that
these werent
girlfriends annie
these were minors
who reported a rape
well dna can be wrong
the odds of these four samples
not coming from the same person
are in the hundreds of millions
its the same guy
now look we uh we
dont normally do this
we re very careful
with victim information
but im hoping there
might be some kind
of connection between
all four of you girls
maybe you went to
the same camp together
you shopped
at the same mall
i cant give you their names
but i was hoping that
you might take a look
at their pictures
lynn wait a minute
i dont know if this is a good idea
no no i want
i want to yeah
all right annie do
you know this girl
shes from cleveland
shes fifteen years old
