nanny gilbertine is so tired of
the boo boo book  she could just gag 
boo boo 
all right  all right 
  one fine and sunny day 
baby boo s nanny henrietta said
 baby boo  today you shall go
on a wonderful adventure    
   you will see the many 
many sights of the big city    
  after a lovely breakfast
they walked down the lane to the corner 
where they boarded a big  blue bus   
  they were on their way to the big city   
  baby boo felt very grown up indeed 
for this was his first trip
away from mother and father   
did l tell you 
  baby s having his picture taken today 
  oh  say hello to old willy for me 
old willy isn t doing it 
l ve hired downtown baby photographers 
he s photographed cotwell babies
since the depression 
old willy hasn t had a picture
in the paper in over 20 years 
everyone we know has had
their baby s picture in the paper 
baby bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown 
l can t count the number of times l ve been
asked why we re keeping our baby a secret 
you re right 
the only way to quiet such talk is to have our
small minded friends open up their papers
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city 
  get out  come on 
  come on  let s go  l said move it 
move it 
off with the fuzzy pink and blue sweaters 
nice and slow 
  ed  does it matter who wears pink or blue 
  no 
cotwell    cotwell    where is that little   
dinner with the westfalls tonight 
don t forget to do your breathing exercises
dr phillips suggested 
  l have a breathing scheduled at 11 
  bless your soul 
have a wonderful day 
bing 
what did you forget 
oh  my pen  thank you  andrews

darling  you know how
l hate games in the morning

while dada s gone  burble  burble 
won t it be exciting when he can understand
the wonderful things we say to him 
bye bye  bye bye 
he can t look too butch 
but he can t look too feminine 
he has to look angelic  like a little prince 
that would suggest blue 
blue  won t that look like we re trying to
match his eyes  won t it be too obvious 
l see lots of babies with
blue eyes and blue outfits 
what kind of babies 
rich babies  pretty babies 
  regular babies  lmportant babies 
  regular babies 
baby bink is not a regular baby 
buff  buff  buff  buff  buff

photographer de babe 
entirely at your service 
you were expecting us 
  thank you 
  excuse me 
whoa  look at this place 
eddie 
we ain t here to nick no bric a brac 
we re here for the hit of a lifetime 
you wanna be a shoplifter  go to jc penney 
you think we can get away with this 
no  l m here because l ve got
a wild curiosity about the electric chair 
sorry 
what a gorgeous baby 
you must be so proud 
l m mrs cotwell 
l am mr charlie 
shall we begin 
mr francis  if you will go to the vehicle
and retrieve my light meter 
l m going to be rich 
l want individual photos of baby bink 
baby bink  what
an absolutely delightful name 
  lt s a pet name for bennington 
  certainly 
l want individual photos of baby bink 
and then a portrait of the two of us 
whatever you wish  however you wish 
you photographed
the children of many of my friends 
those pictures are forever appearing
in newspapers and magazines 
lt is true 
  his picture s never been published 
  that cannot be 
lt s true 
l am sure in the not so distant future
this little fellow will be very well known 
l want your very best  l want art 
l want you to set a new standard
for beauty in baby photography 
l so welcome the challenge  madame 
and  to that end  may l ask one small favor 
may l have some time alone with the child 
oh  l need his complete attention 
the great bond between you and your son 
his love for you  will distract him 
l need to study his marvelous little features 
to learn how best to photograph him 
he does well with persons
he is not intimate with 
does he 
he s a friendly boy  but he may not like   
excellent 
madame  if l might make a suggestion 
your garment du jour  while
extremely magnificent  is so colorful 
l am afraid it will dominate the photograph
and detract from your natural beauty 
l knew this outfit was wrong 
l ll be back in 15 minutes 
take all the time you need 
lf he gets cranky 
read him his book 
how invaluable 
thank you 
mr andrews  get the winter wardrobe 
  but  madam   
  hurry  gilbertine 
there you go 
take the book 
bink really deserves this moment
in the spotlight 
lt s too bad the baby pictures
don t go on the front page 
  ma am 
  yeah 
we gotta make this fast 
l m sorry it took so long 
where s bink 
eddie 
you re a smart guy  how do you tell
the front from the back on these diapers 
are there pockets in the front 
  very funny  the front and back are the same 
  then it probably don t make no difference 
put him in them regular baby clothes  that
fruit suit s a dead giveaway he s a rich kid 
come on  good boy 
ed 
how do l know this milk
won t burn the kid s throat 
lf that matters 
try it on some skin first 
what s the matter with you 
l better let it cool down 
you like that 
eddie 
watch the baby 
very good  now see if it works the other way 
lt works 
put him in the bedroom 
the more he sleeps  the less attention
he draws from the neighbors 
  and keep an eye on him 
  here you go  kid 
that little doo doo machine
is my retirement money 
all right 
nappy nap time  little jerk 
go to sleep real nice
cos mr teddy bear over here 
he s been up all night drinking with
the barbie dolls and he needs his rest 
all right  drink your milk 
take your nap 
drink your milk  take your nap 
  eddie

eddie  what else did mary s little lamb do 
didn t he put humpty dumpty
back together again

there was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning 
a baby missing from
a department store care center 
another  at three o clock  at the zoo 
shortly after that at a downtown park 
and a final report not long ago at   
  a building under construction 
  yeah  that s right 
he s doing everything in the book 
l know where he is 
  before returning home for supper 
nanny and baby boo stopped at
the old soldiers  home to visit mr tinsel   
that s where he is 
come on over 
lt s the kid  on television  the one that   
come on  that s it  come on 
  this is the army  mr jones

and send for backup 
hey  eddie  you sure you don t wanna

oh  that s a good idea 
we get the living hell

three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth 
what chance have we got of strolling into
that alley and coming out with anything less
  than 140 years in prison

we walk away while we re still ahead 
we took a lickin  and kept on tickin

  or a convenience store once in a while 
you know  one thing l learned from all this 
l ain t never gonna have any kids of my own 
yeah  seeing as you burnt down the only tree
in your forest  l wouldn t worry about it 
why don t you shut up 
l don t wanna ever hear another word
about that rotten  snake bit baby 
l m serious 
l m hearing that little vermin in my thoughts 
l wanna erase him from my mind 
did you hear that 
  yeah 
  you know what it sounds like 
he s back 
you dirty  no good little stool pigeon 
you re surrounded  throw down the boo boo 
and put your hands over your heads 
this is the end of the story 
good night  sweetheart
