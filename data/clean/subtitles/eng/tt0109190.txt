their babys picture in the paper
baby bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown
l cant count the number of times lve been
asked why were keeping our baby a secret

the only way to quiet such talk is to have our
smallminded friends open up their papers
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city

for beauty in baby photography
l so welcome the challenge madame
and to that end may l ask one small favor
may l have some time alone with the child

l need to study his marvelous little features
to learn how best to photograph him
he does well with persons

hes a friendly boy but he may not like
excellent
madame if l might make a suggestion
your garment du jour while

since the media broke the story
calls have come in
there was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning
a baby missing from
a department store care center
another at three oclock at the zoo
shortly after that at a downtown park
and a final report not long ago at
a building under construction
yeah thats right
hes doing everything in the book
l know where he is
before returning home for supper
nanny and baby boo stopped at
the old soldiers home to visit mr tinsel

and send for backup
hey eddie you sure you dont wanna
go check to see if they left the money
oh thats a good idea
we get the living hell

three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth
what chance have we got of strolling into
that alley and coming out with anything less
than 140 years in prison

this is the end of the story
good night sweetheart
