but i ll listen anyway 
in english  please 
others are listening 
1975 
the cold war 
in a gymnasium in grozny 
a soviet olympic wrestler
named sasha fyorodovich chenkov
meets for the first time
the only female chess grand master
of her era 
anka nurekyova 
within a month  they were married 
and within a year  a child 
one month more 
the child was back
in the same hospital 
sick with fever 
and within days after that 
the child suddenly was dead 
yes  a child was dead 
and  yes  a child was buried 
but the chenkov baby was alive
and became the property of another man 
a master spy who had devised
the greatest plan
a russian patriot could ever invent 
a plan to destroy america 
it had all started
with an american named
lee harvey oswald 
in 1959  he emigrated to russia 
three years later  he returned home 
but the man who came back to america
was in fact a russian spy named alek 
on november 22nd  1963 
alek became the first success
of the new program
and a hero of the soviet union 
the spymaster was now given the go ahead
to create many more like alek 
scores of agents  males and females 
to be substituted for americans 
i pledge allegiance to the flag   
at an abandoned monastery 
chenkov and other boys and girls
learned english
long before they learned russian 
drilled in idiom 
idiosyncrasy and
ideology 
and by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming 
the spymaster made warriors of iron 
unquestioning and unbreakable 
who crossed first 
who crossed last 
you re killing me  man 
when does the good fairy come in 
never 
it s a story without hope 
chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting american family 
there was an accident 
the family died 
chenkov was sent to america
to live a complete lie
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within 
day x 
the long awaited mission is here 
chenkov will travel to new york city
to kill the president of russia
at the funeral of
the american vice president 
chenkov is ka 12 
   ka  
  cold war legend 
highly trained russian sleeper agents
inserted into american society
to sabotage and assassinate 
supposedly they d wait years to strike 
decades  even 
mm  supposedly 
  what s the matter ted  you don t believe in moles 
  i believe in moles  all right 
just not the bogeyman 
especially if the plan is
to kill their own president 
this guy s selling smoke 
wrap it up  ev 
so a russian agent is going to kill
the russian president  is that it 
mm hm  okay 
thank you very much 
and what would you like
in return for that information 
i simply wish to help you do
what you need to do

their missiles to the field

on the ground  mr  president 
mr  president  i strongly recommend
we go from defcon 4 to defcon 2 
at least at our forward bases 
do it 
and since the russians have deployed 
we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options 
it s not on the table 
it s not a deterrent

the man we thought was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous 
president matveyev is alive 
we re going to russia 
what you are seeing
are live pictures of
russian president matveyev
arriving at the airport outside of moscow 
this is astonishing 
according to his doctors 
president matveyev s mistaken death
is attributed to a temporary paralysis
from a toxin derived from spider venom 
a recap for those who may not
have been following the events of the day   
at least i was right 
i had a feeling we d lost you
back there in north korea 
i could see how moved you were
by mike s little white knight routine 
you were supposed to recruit him  ev 
not fall in love with him 
that s why i told orlov to pick him up 
by the way  how is mike 
orlov is dead 
well  that s good news 
saved me the trouble 
i had to practically twist his arm
to get him to blow your cover at the cia 
you see  he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive 
but you needed somebody
to take the blame 
i m the patsy 
and i m the hero 
congratulations  ev 
you re about to become famous

she won t talk  she s trained not to talk 
no matter what we do to her 
if we re gonna find these people 
we gonna find them ourselves

the moment orlov walked in 
so did i 
we just didn t know what it was 
  winter did 
  winter 
you expect me to believe that winter
was gonna launch the missiles
and you saved the world 
i would like you to believe that  yeah 
that s a big accusation 
well 
he s dead now
so he can t defend himself 
i guess you ll just have to
decide for yourself 
how many more like you are there 
like me 
none 
like him 
more than you or i can handle alone 
you really think a trained soviet agent
couldn t kill the russian president
at point blank range if she wanted to 
or you  for that matter 
i could ve killed you at the funeral
and i didn t 
you surrendered to me
because i gave you no choice 
you know better 
i had a choice 
you know better 
if i did believe you 
and i m not saying for a second
that i do  but if i did 
nobody else would 
well  maybe you can
think of a way around that 
they took everything from me 
i ll kill them
