my name is
oleg vassilyevich orlov
i have cancer
im moved
a defector with cancer
are you selling secrets for chemo

by damning myself
it is that i no longer
have anything to fear
russia is also dying
but unlike me shes not dead
oleg vassily orlov
shows up in 1993
in novosibirsk oblast siberia
he was on victor barisovskys
staff there

scan says hes truthful on the cancer
prior to 93
russia was once strong powerful
nothing
he doesnt exist
and she will be again
when things have been set back
on the correct path
i have somewhere i need to be mr orlov
so if you wouldnt mind
getting to the point
i came here to tell you a story
i dont like stories
but ill listen anyway
in english please
others are listening
the cold war
in a gymnasium in grozny
a soviet olympic wrestler
named sasha fyorodovich chenkov
meets for the first time
the only female chess grand master
of her era
anka nurekyova
within a month they were married
and within a year a child
one month more
the child was back
in the same hospital
sick with fever
and within days after that
the child suddenly was dead
yes a child was dead
and yes a child was buried
but the chenkov baby was alive
and became the property of another man
a master spy who had devised
the greatest plan
a russian patriot could ever invent
a plan to destroy america
it had all started
with an american named
lee harvey oswald
in 1959 he emigrated to russia
three years later he returned home
but the man who came back to america
was in fact a russian spy named alek
on november 22nd 1963
alek became the first success
of the new program
and a hero of the soviet union
the spymaster was now given the goahead
to create many more like alek
scores of agents males and females
to be substituted for americans
i pledge allegiance to the flag
at an abandoned monastery
chenkov and other boys and girls
learned english
long before they learned russian
drilled in idiom
idiosyncrasy and
ideology
and by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming
the spymaster made warriors of iron
unquestioning and unbreakable
who crossed first
who crossed last
youre killing me man
when does the good fairy come in
never
its a story without hope
chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting american family
there was an accident
the family died
chenkov was sent to america
to live a complete lie
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within
day x
the longawaited mission is here
chenkov will travel to new york city
to kill the president of russia
at the funeral of
the american vice president
chenkov is ka 12
ka
cold war legend
highly trained russian sleeper agents
inserted into american society
to sabotage and assassinate
supposedly theyd wait years to strike
decades even
mm supposedly
whats the matter ted you dont believe in moles
i believe in moles all right
just not the bogeyman
especially if the plan is
to kill their own president
this guys selling smoke
wrap it up ev
so a russian agent is going to kill
the russian president is that it
mmhm okay

the man we thought was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous

russian president matveyev
arriving at the airport outside of moscow
this is astonishing
according to his doctors
president matveyevs mistaken death
is attributed to a temporary paralysis
from a toxin derived from spider venom
a recap for those who may not
have been following the events of the day
at least i was right
i had a feeling wed lost you
back there in north korea
i could see how moved you were
by mikes little whiteknight routine
you were supposed to recruit him ev
not fall in love with him
thats why i told orlov to pick him up
by the way how is mike
orlov is dead
well thats good news
saved me the trouble
i had to practically twist his arm
to get him to blow your cover at the cia
you see he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive
but you needed somebody
to take the blame
im the patsy
and im the hero
congratulations ev
