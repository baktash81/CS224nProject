and he will continue to do so
because this is the best deal
of his miserable life
groans
what is that
what the fuck is happening
isnt it obvious
i claimed my reward
i had experienced
everything afforded to man
and still
i wanted more
i chose liminal
i chose sensation
but the cenobites
their tastes were not what i imagined
they preyed on my nerves
pulling them in random cycles
stopping just enough
groans
so i could never grow numb
i dont know what they promised you
knowledge love
i sought pleasure
but all they have to give
is pain
its a trick

once a threshold has been crossed
all you can do is search
for greater thresholds
not him i never chose him
and yet he is chosen
marked
gifts cannot be ungiven
only exchanges can be made
i was told that the box is in my hands
if not me another
right
not him
riley what are you doing
perhaps youd prefer
another
anything is better than this
perhaps we were wrong
about you
youve never sought sensation
your whole life
every conquest
all your pleasures
lie in power
power
for your efforts
we offer the leviathan configuration
riley riley hold on hold on
i tried to stop you remember
yeah
just put the fucking thing down
just put the fucking thing down
okay
give it to me
trevor grunts
riley shudders
groaning
panting
breathing heavily
our power lies in dominance
in the sovereignty of anguish
laughs
groans
and now
it will be yours to wield
gasps
groans
no
pinhead you will know our finest gift
voight no
oh yes
we have such sights to show you
go

pinhead lament lore
laudarant
liminal lazarus leviathan
what would you ask of us
matt riley
riley look at me
take my hand
take me home
no
ive seen your rewards
i know my brothers gone
i dont want anything from you
nothing
then you have chosen
a life of regret
knowing everything youve done
everyone youve hurt
and lost
your suffering has barely begun
you chose to live to carry that weight
bitter and brief
you have chosen
the lament configuration
what just happened in there
i made a choice
colin it was the right one
