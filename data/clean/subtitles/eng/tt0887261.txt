 shudders 
oh  my god

trevor  that s him 
in the flesh
such as it is 
but then he already knew that 
didn t you 
trevor 
riley  you knew 
you knew 
you put that thing in my hands
and you knew 
how could you do that 
why would you do that 
sorry 
oh  my god 
how could you do that 
he was just doing what i paid him to 
and he will continue to do so
because this is the best deal
of his miserable life 
 groans 
what is that 
what the fuck is happening 
isn t it obvious 
i claimed my reward 
i had experienced
everything afforded to man 
and still 
i wanted more 
i chose liminal 
i chose sensation 
but the cenobites 
their tastes were not what i imagined 
they preyed on my nerves 
pulling them in random cycles 
stopping just enough   
 groans 
   so i could never grow numb 
i don t know what they promised you 
knowledge  love 
i sought pleasure 
but all they have to give
is pain 
it s a trick 
all of it 
open it 
don t 
trevor  what are you doing  man 
letting them in 
no  don t 
 machinery creaking

 shudders 
no 
your chains can t reach me here 
tell your god i ve got its disciples 
its priest 
what did you think  i built a fortress 
i built a cage 
and i m not letting any of you go
until it makes me right again 
you reject our gift 
fuck your gift 
fuck you 
now take it out of me 
remarkable 
all this   
all for us 
no  not for you 
for me 
i get what i want 
then let us in
to address your displeasure 
what are you doing 
isn t it obvious 
wait   groans

i don t want it anymore 
 shudders 
 screams 
colin 
colin 
 screams 
 screams echoing 
stop 
voight  just take it out 
i don t want it anymore 
just let me die  i m begging you 
just   
just let me die 
there is no retreat 
once a threshold has been crossed 
all you can do is search
for greater thresholds 
not him  i never chose him 
and yet he is chosen 
marked 
gifts cannot be ungiven 
only exchanges can be made 
i was told that the box is in my hands 
if not me  another 
right 
  not him 
  riley  what are you doing 
perhaps you d prefer   
another 
anything is better than this 
perhaps we were wrong
about you 
you ve never sought sensation 
your whole life 
every conquest 
all your pleasures
lie in power 
power 
for your efforts 
we offer the leviathan configuration 
riley  riley  hold on  hold on 
i tried to stop you  remember 
yeah 
just put the fucking thing down 
just put the fucking thing down 
okay 
give it to me 
   trevor grunts 
   riley shudders 
 groaning 
 panting 
 breathing heavily 
our power lies in dominance 
in the sovereignty of anguish 
 laughs 
 groans 
and now 
it will be yours to wield 
 gasps 
 groans 
no   
pinhead  you will know our finest gift 
  voight  no 
  oh  yes 
we have such sights to show you 
go 
no 
i ll be fine  okay 
just finish it 
pinhead  lament  lore 
laudarant 
liminal  lazarus  leviathan 
what would you ask of us 
matt  riley   
riley  look at me 
take my hand 
take me home 
no 
i ve seen your rewards   
i know my brother s gone 
i don t want anything from you 
  nothing 
  then you have chosen   
a life of regret 
knowing everything you ve done 
everyone you ve hurt
and lost 
your suffering has barely begun 
you chose to live  to carry that weight 
bitter and brief 
you have chosen
the lament configuration 
what just happened in there 
i made a choice 
colin  it was the right one
