but i m gonna kill myself 
i just thought that someone should know 
i don t know how this works 
i m probably gonna jump off an
overpass in front of a semi  so   
or a u haul  not a bus  i m not gonna
be a dick and make people watch 
but it has to be big  it s
gotta be so big that it just   
done  kills me  lights out 
 cause if it just maims me and i m
like    well  how s that good for anyone 
then i gotta find a nurse to smother me  how
am i gonna get across  smothering  if i m   
we don t need to get caught up in the minutia  i
just thought that an adult    you should know 
wow  this is  uh 
a lot to take in  nadine 
i    i wish i knew
what to say 
well  i was actually just drafting
my own suicide note just now 
 dear everybody  
as some of you know 
i have 32 fleeting minutes of happiness
per school day during lunch 
which has been eaten up
again and again
by the same   
especially
badly dressed student 
and i finally thought 
you know what 
i would rather have
the dark  empty nothingness 
i really would 
it sounds    relaxing 
 have a nice life
without me  fuckers  
you are so gonna get fired
when i actually do it 
well  not for sure 
but i can dream 
let me start from the beginning 
around second grade
i had a realization 
there are two types
of people in this world 
the people who radiate confidence
and naturally excel at life   
yes  yes 
and the people who hope all those
people die in a big explosion 
all right 
knock  em dead  kiddo 
my brother darian was a winner from
day one and had about a million fans 
bye 
his biggest one    my mother 
  bye  sweetheart 
oh  check it out 
okay  boss lady 
see you tonight 
nadine  we re not
doing this again 
you promised 
now get out of the car 
well  that s it 
you could say my mother and i
weren t exactly peas in a pod 
oh  no 
and the only one who could
handle either of us    was dad 
hey  hey  hey  hey  dad had
a nearly impossible task   
having to manage us both 
all right now 
i know kids can be mean 
but if you get a chance 
fart into their backpacks 
i wish you were small 
then i d at least have
one person to have lunch with 
instead  the most attention i got
at school was from these three 
nobody likes you  you suck
and you re gonna get aids 
over here  run 
my childhood had become
a raging dumpster fire 
and i couldn t take one more second of this
intolerable  unlivable nightmare of a   
excuse me 
and then  out of the clear blue 
an angel appeared 
can you move  please 
she was dressed like
a small  elderly gentleman 
and her breath smelled
of sweetarts 
you want to hold him 
but don t squash him 
hi  guy 
if you want  you can be
his other mom with me 
really 
i gonna be your other mom
and take such good care of you 
i accidentally suffocated him two
hours later in my pencil box 
but i had finally made
my first friend 
we told each other things we
never thought we d say out loud 
once  my grandpa s pajama flap
accidentally came open
and i saw his wiener
and got real sad 
my mom has to take medicine or she ll
get upset and buy too much at the mall 
it s true 
it turned out krista s life
wasn t perfect either 
i m walking away  okay  what am i  your
mother  am i supposed to babysit   
but we got each other through 
play with this 
we could play with
mrs  penguin  hee hee 
for the next few years 
and then  some extremely
fucked up shit happened 
oh  my god 
i knew it 
it s really just the hair 
it s not that bad 
you can just grow it out 
are you even up there 
hey  move 
i got to pee 
darian  meanwhile 
just got better looking 
and that asshole knew it 
that night i picked up
some cheeseburgers with my dad 
what do i have that s any good  tell me 
what have i ever had 
you have a lot  you have love

dad

with the details 
so    let s just say the next
few years were complete shit 
oh  god

god  what if you actually did that  what
if you lost your virginity in a petland 
i think it d be kind of nice 
all the little tropical fish watching 
it d be kind of spiritual 
oh  my god  would you please look at
that stupid shirt my brother s wearing 
oh  you can see his nipples 
how does he not realize
that all that does is scream 
 i have a body complex
worse than a girl  
how much does he
even work out now

you should have seen him  he had a conniption
 cause my mom won t by him creatine anymore
since it fucks up your kidneys 
i was like

what does mom expect  you to win
people over with your personality  
hey  so  uh

but yesterday when you were giving
your lecture  you were like

north seceded from the union  
you meant to say the south seceded  you
accidentally said the exact opposite 
i didn t want to raise my hand and be all 
 excuse me  these kids are pretty confusable  
just thought maybe
you d want to know 
oh 
hey

  yeah

and you probably don t recall 
but  uh  was there any point during
it when you thought to yourself

you were effing the whole thing up

look on the bright side 
you know 
i mean  maybe they ll get married and then
my best friend will be a part of my family 
helpful  thank you 
it really bothers me she s not
giving you rides anymore though 
i m gonna have to talk to her about that 
no  you re not 
i can t drive you every morning  it puts me
on the freeway late and adds 40 minutes 
if you do that  i will do something
equally terrible to you 
i will tell everyone on facebook that
you pluck your nipples  how about that 
oh 
look  just tell me what you
want to hear and i ll say it 
mom    i want to make
you feel better 
what can i say to do that 
i don t know 
here s what i do
when i m feeling down 
i get very quiet and very still 
and i say to myself   
everyone in the world is as
miserable and empty as i am 
there s just better pretending 
try it sometime 
might bring you some peace 
hey  uh  do you guys
know where erwin kim is 
i guess he hangs out
around here sometimes 
yeah  he s working on
his project for sff 
sf what 
the student film festival 
right 
yeah 
sff 
hey  um  i gotta talk to you
about some homework 
i didn t need to talk to you
about homework  i lied 
are you enjoying my company 
you re a barrel of monkeys 
you never told me
if you have a wife 
you should date my mother 
her last boyfriend turned out
to be an internet perv 
she s very  very fragile 
very  um   
 oh  save me  
men like that  right  though   cause
at the end of the day they all wanna   
all wanna be a hero 
everyone just wants to feel
important in life 
thing is  no matter
how important they are 
there s always gonna be
someone more important 
people get so uptight about that 
oh  no  they re better than me 
it s like  god 
they don t realize
important doesn t matter 
it s confidence  when confidence
breaks into the room   
it wins every single time 
doesn t matter if it s real or pulling
it straight out of their ass 
people are dumb 
they don t know the difference 
you know what 
i m gonna go ahead
and i m gonna tell you the real reason
i m having lunch with you today 
you see  i don t  uh    i don t really
have any friends at the moment 
and to be completely honest
with you  i m not interested 
at all  my entire generation
is a bunch of mouth breathers 
they literally have a seizure if you
take their phone away for a second 
they can t communicate
without emojis 
they actually think that the world wants
to know that they are  eating a taco  
exclamation point  smiley face  smiley
face  smile    like we give a fuck 
i am an old soul 
i like old music and old movies
and even old people 
bottom line is i have nothing in
common with the people out there 
and they have nothing
in common with me 
nadine 
max 
maybe   
nobody likes you 
you re a dick 
maybe nobody likes you  huh 
you re always    you re always in a shit
mood  you re a really shitty teacher 
you put zero effort
into everything you do 
and there s no way you re proud of that 
look at you  look at   
like  you do nothing  look at your hair 
you don t even   
you don t do your hair  cause you
don t have any hair  you re bald 
you know what  you know
why you re not married 
because bald men are gross and disgusting  and
especially the ones that make  45 000 a year 
what 
i ve been doing this 23 years
and   
you re the first person to
ever underestimate my salary 
that made me feel good 
i mean  that    that part 
what are you doing 
i m giving you half my cookie 
why 
make you feel better 
jesus 
guess what 
you re my favorite student 
does that help
