but im gonna kill myself
i just thought that someone should know
i dont know how this works
im probably gonna jump off an
overpass in front of a semi so
or a uhaul not a bus im not gonna
be a dick and make people watch
but it has to be big its
gotta be so big that it just
done kills me lights out
cause if it just maims me and im
like well hows that good for anyone
then i gotta find a nurse to smother me how
am i gonna get across smothering if im
we dont need to get caught up in the minutia i
just thought that an adult you should know
wow this is uh
a lot to take in nadine
i i wish i knew
what to say
well i was actually just drafting
my own suicide note just now
dear everybody
as some of you know
i have 32 fleeting minutes of happiness
per school day during lunch
which has been eaten up
again and again
by the same
especially
badly dressed student
and i finally thought
you know what
i would rather have
the dark empty nothingness
i really would
it sounds relaxing
have a nice life
without me fuckers
you are so gonna get fired
when i actually do it
well not for sure
but i can dream
let me start from the beginning
around second grade
i had a realization
there are two types
of people in this world
the people who radiate confidence
and naturally excel at life
yes yes
and the people who hope all those
people die in a big explosion
all right
knock em dead kiddo
my brother darian was a winner from
day one and had about a million fans
bye
his biggest one my mother
bye sweetheart
oh check it out
okay boss lady
see you tonight
nadine were not
doing this again
you promised
now get out of the car
well thats it
you could say my mother and i
werent exactly peas in a pod
oh no
and the only one who could
handle either of us was dad
hey hey hey hey dad had
a nearly impossible task
having to manage us both
all right now
i know kids can be mean
but if you get a chance
fart into their backpacks
i wish you were small
then id at least have
one person to have lunch with
instead the most attention i got
at school was from these three
nobody likes you you suck
and youre gonna get aids
over here run
my childhood had become
a raging dumpster fire
and i couldnt take one more second of this
intolerable unlivable nightmare of a
excuse me
and then out of the clear blue
an angel appeared
can you move please
she was dressed like
a small elderly gentleman
and her breath smelled
of sweetarts
you want to hold him
but dont squash him
hi guy
if you want you can be
his other mom with me
really
i gonna be your other mom
and take such good care of you
i accidentally suffocated him two
hours later in my pencil box
but i had finally made
my first friend
we told each other things we
never thought wed say out loud
once my grandpas pajama flap
accidentally came open
and i saw his wiener
and got real sad
my mom has to take medicine or shell
get upset and buy too much at the mall
its true
it turned out kristas life
wasnt perfect either
im walking away okay what am i your
mother am i supposed to babysit
but we got each other through
play with this
we could play with
mrs penguin hee hee
for the next few years
and then some extremely
fuckedup shit happened
oh my god
i knew it
its really just the hair
its not that bad
you can just grow it out
are you even up there
hey move
i got to pee
darian meanwhile
just got betterlooking
and that asshole knew it

youre a barrel of monkeys
you never told me
if you have a wife
you should date my mother
her last boyfriend turned out
to be an internet perv
shes very very fragile
very um
oh save me
men like that right though cause
at the end of the day they all wanna
all wanna be a hero
everyone just wants to feel
important in life
thing is no matter
how important they are
theres always gonna be
someone more important
people get so uptight about that
oh no theyre better than me
its like god
they dont realize
important doesnt matter
its confidence when confidence
breaks into the room
it wins every single time
doesnt matter if its real or pulling
it straight out of their ass
people are dumb
they dont know the difference
you know what
im gonna go ahead
and im gonna tell you the real reason
im having lunch with you today
you see i dont uh i dont really
have any friends at the moment
and to be completely honest
with you im not interested
at all my entire generation
is a bunch of mouthbreathers
they literally have a seizure if you
take their phone away for a second
they cant communicate
without emojis
they actually think that the world wants
to know that they are eating a taco
exclamation point smiley face smiley
face smile like we give a fuck
i am an old soul
i like old music and old movies
and even old people
bottom line is i have nothing in
common with the people out there
and they have nothing
in common with me
nadine
