my generation
we were born into war
indistinct chatter over comms
giant monsters attacked
our world
roars
we called em kaiju
roars
they came through the breach
a gateway to another dimension
at the bottom
of the pacific ocean
they were sent by an alien race
on the other side
the precursors
we fought back
building our own monsters
jaegars giant robots
so big they needed
two pilots to run em
my father was one of them
he sacrificed himself
to help save the world
i am not my father
whoa
ooh yeah
whoops
its been ten years
since we won the war
and closed the breach
most of the worlds recovered
but a few coastal cities
never did
and the world is still
picking up the pieces
wizzy boy make me dance
daddy yo
make me dance
but some of us
live better in a broken world
snoring
and squatting in half a mansion
is better than paying
for some crappy apartment
now in the relief zones
you have to get creative
you have to hustle
or somebody else
might eat your breakfast
and your cookies
sniffs
and your damn hot sauce
you know out here
we place a different value
on things
the pan pacific defense corps
usually looks the other way
as long as you dont go poking
around where you dont belong
say like a
decommissioned
jaeger scrapyard
big risks mean big reward
and nothing pays more
than stolen jaeger tech
plenty of nutcases out here
trying to slap together
their own jaegers
indistinct chatter on comms
but they need
the parts to do it
so if you can steal
what no one else can steal
you can live like a king
scanner beeping
are you sure its in here
power cores are stripped
before they get decommissioned
but sometimes they miss
the tertiary plasma capacitors
and thats a big score
this ones still
holding a charge
oh
you better hope so
okay
lets just calm down
lets not get excited
im just playing the odds here
you cheated barada in juarez
skipped out on chau
in hong kong

a misunderstanding

pilots doesnt make any sense
well maybe shes not the only
one that doesnt belong here
wow see nate i know
you have a problem with me
but come on
shes just a kid

you make stronger connections

that we can work together
well the war ended
ten years ago man
you just need to let that go
just woosah
yyou have to understand
your enemys ob
you have
whipped cream sprays
whipped cream sprays
sorry mate
you have to understand
your enemys objective
to know youve defeated em
we still dont
no
i can help you out with that
see im thinking it has
something to do with them
sending giant monsters
to kick the crap out of us
no no no
the precursors wouldnt send
kaiju to flatten a few cities
if they were trying
to wipe us all out
all right look nate i dont
have a problem with you man
but i had to make a choice
it was between
your pretty face and prison
i chose your pretty face
oh well im touched
and how many damn toppings
do you need
leave my toppings be man
dont mess with
my damn toppings
so the cadets got like what
couple of months
before they graduate
six
okay ill tell you what
every time you want to say
something soldiery to em
ill just nod or like
yep what he said
and then before you know it
they get to be pilots
and i get to get back to my life
great
boom
it may happen
sooner than you think
how so
big dog and pony show tomorrow
shao and her team
are presenting
this new drone program
they have
could make us all obsolete

firm grip you got there uh
hand hard very shake
thank you for having us
ranger lambert and i will get you set up maam
thats a much better
look on you
guess its better than
prison stripes barely
chuckles
iim sorry is this him
itits got to be him right
youre stackers kid
hey uh im newt
i was uh i was a big fan
of your fathers
amazing speech writer
by the way
did you ever hear his one where
he canceled the apocalypse
newton
hermann
i was hoping youd be
tagging along
i could use your help on
an experiment im working on
now this will
only take a moment
i know how busy you are
yeah
dont want to impose
but uh
aw come on
you cant impose on me
i mean weve been inside
each others heads right
weve saved the world
weve drifted with a kaiju
you know if we hadnt
yanked that intel
out of that kaijus brain
raleigh wouldve never
been able to close the breach
now that was you
and that was me
technically more me
but any chance we could
make this quick or
um deployment
huh
of jaegers
deploying them into battle
it takes takes too much time
the amount of damage
a kaiju can inflict
before theyve ev
ah here
i think ive found a solution
hermann you know i can
never read your uh
uh rocket thrusters huh
yeah no
no theres no fuel
in the world
with that kind of
boosttomass ratio chuckles
from this world
no
iis that kaiju blood
exactly
ive discovered kaiju blood
is highly reactive
when its combined
with rare earth elements
cerium lanthanum gadolinium
i realize that pal okay
yyou cant be fooling around
with this stuff
youre gonna blow yourself up
uh
now no one knows more about
kaiju morphology than you
okay
and if you could just take a look please
no hermann i got to stop you
look none of this matters
once my boss drones
are approved
deployment time
thats gonna be a nonissue
within a year buddy were
gonna have drones everywhere
so you wont help me
look why dont we talk about
it over dinner at my place
okay you can
finally meet alice
i dont need
a hot meal newton
what i need is a solution
to a very specific problem
hey
watch beeps
ah thats me bud
im sorry duty calls
its been nice catching up
newton
i um
i still get nightmares
about what we saw
when we drifted with
that disgusting kaiju brain
yeah
but it was a hell
of a rush wasnt it
dr geizler time to go
okay okay
you and dr gottleib were close werent you
during the war
oh uh
we shared lab yes okay
speak english your mandarin
makes you sound like an idiot
ii know im terrible
uh yes we shared
a lab together
what were you and dr gottlieb talking about
oh some crazy idea
he had about
thruster pods
on a on a jaeger
until secretary general mori makes her
recommendation at the council summit
i cant afford a misstep
no more contact with him
until after the vote
oh well chuckles the mans
completely harmless uh
speaks mandarin
uh okay
could you say that again
and this time about 80 slower
i said dont make me question
your loyalty understand
ay chuckles
whats to question
i look i barely
talk to the guy anyway
then it wont be a problem
and work on your mandarin
i do not like to repeat
myself
in any language
liwen
my drones are the next step
in jaeger evolution
the system i designed
processes commands
through a quantum data core
this means that a single pilot
can operate the drone remotely
from anywhere in the world
as soon as the council
approves deployment
based on secretary general
moris final report
the days of struggling
to find and train
drift compatible pilots
will be a thing of the past
and you think a bunch of desk
jockeys are better than us
we are not here
to shut you down
cooperation between
our programs
has never been more vital
if there are any questions
yeah i got a question right over here
clamoring
we are pilots
not a bunch of office workers
and now were shouting
theres no need to shout
clamoring continues
jake
well that was slick
so how long until all this is
shut down so i can go home
i dont trust the tech
not yet at least
well it looks
pretty good to me
remote systems can be
hacked or compromised
no youve got
the key vote right
so there you go
its your decision
i wish i could just
go ahead and approve them
nearly half the council
is backing liwen
they arent going to like
my decision
who cares what they like
and what they dont like
ill tell you what
im gonna go with you
for moral support
plus i want to get
out of this place
im glad you offered
because i already requested
gipsy avenger as honor guard
at the council summit
look you know
gipsys nates ride
his copilot works for
liwen now he needs a new one
one that you already know
is drift compatible
all right
ill do it
i got your back
but i want to be there
when you tell nate
cause i just want
to see his face
hes gonna be so pissed
hes just gonna
stand there like
yeah i dont think
you belong in a jaeger jake
get out of my jaeger
im handsome and sexy
mako chuckles
he is handsome
he is sexy

meh i post one jaeger
at your funeral
laughs
maybe half a jaeger
chuckles
i heard thats where
they found amara
in half a jaeger
it was a whole jaeger
it just wasnt very big
viktoriya
bigger is better
scoffs
what did you say
am i saying that right
yep
ah
whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
guys
i worked every day of my life
to be here
you didnt do anything
you were just picked up
off the street like garbage
grunting
guys come on
hey hey
hey whoa whoa whoa
you know where i learned that
on the streets
you big dumb
ranger on deck
coughs
she jumped me
she doesnt belong here
i dont care
you know when i first joined
the corps i was just like you
worse i was nobody
but that woman
we laid to rest today
mako mori she said
whoever you are
the minute you enter this
program you join a family
and no matter what they do
no matter how stupid
they may act sometimes
you forgive em
and you move on
so you start believing that
in here
and youll start believing
in a jaeger
jules
hey
marshals looking for you guys
says gottlieb found something
it isnt something
its somewhere
severnaya zemlya
off siberias taymyr peninsula
whats in zemlya
gottlieb
well nothing anymore
a facility roughly
in this location
was used to manufacture jaeger
power cores earlier in the war
but it was decommissioned years ago
why would
mako be trying to tell us
about an abandoned factory
in the middle of nowhere
sir permission
to take gipsy avenger
to see what the hells
out there
footfalls pounding
female voice
scanning
sighs looks like
makos message was a dead end
this place is abandoned
no no wait a second
im getting
some weird readings
alarm blaring
incoming
take out his legs
shouts
alarm blaring
we got to get out of here
grunts
plasma cannon
think we pissed him off
good
you remember our old move
hell yeah
he looks hurt
go for his power core
ah
groaning
shouts
female voice
warning
shouts
robotic groaning
over speakers
pilots of obsidian fury
get the hell out
of your connpod
what the hell is that
its definitely kaiju
a secondary brain used to
control the hindquarters
howd they get into our world
there hasnt been a breach
in ten years
sensors wouldve picked it up
i dont think
there was a breach
kaiju flesh
has a distinct radioactive
halflife signature
particular to the anteverse
this specimen does not
wait so youreyoure saying
that its from our universe
the genetic fingerprints
indicate distinctly terrestrial
modification techniques
probably engineered
from kaiju flesh left over
from the war
precursors didnt do this
humans did
suresh
oh my god
that hunk of slimy crap
was piloting obsidian fury
amara
we got to get a look inside
inside
that things part kaiju
come on guys when are we
ever gonna get a chance
to see something
like this again
never
never would be good
you guys can stay here
im going
no amar amara
guys guys
we should not be in here
liquid dripping
whoa
its fused all the way
through the system
like muscle tissue
jinhai thats how it was able
to move like it did
cool
yeah cool
working with boobs is sounding
better and better
shine your light over here
suresh oh yeah lets just
go yank on the guts
of the weirdass kaiju killbot
what is it
i think its some sort of
sizzles
screams
jinhai
i told you
not to yank on those
go get help go
suresh
man we are so screwed
muffled this goes way past
what she did
quan
the decision has been made
security will take it
from here
were done
lock beeps
is jinhai okay
hes got some scarring
but yeah hell live
marshal put him on probation
meilin and suresh too
they blink wrong
all of em are out
no its not their fault
i talked them into it
im sorry i tried to talk
to the marshal but
youre dismissed
from the program
never belonged here anyway
really
you know i used to say
the same thing a long time ago
but i actually didnt
want to be here
still dont
whyd you sign up
we were at war
and my dad
was leading the charge
and i thought
maybe i could see more of him
maybe even drift with him
well one night
me and nate got into it
it was over something stupid
i cant even remember what
so i climbed in an old mark 4
just to show him i didnt
need him to be a great pilot
thats pretty dumb
yeah
how fard you get
about seven steps well take or leave
how far did you get
about two steps then
i blacked out from the strain
and the first thing i saw
when i woke up was my dad
just standing right
in front of me looking stern
whwhatd he say
he said i was
out of the program
he said i didnt deserve
to be in a jaeger
look he said a lot of things
a year later my dad was gone
and i didnt get a chance
to prove him wrong
more importantly i didnt get
a chance to prove it to myself
you listen to me
dont let what other people
think of you
define who you are
you wont like
where that takes you
do you understand
and keep your head up
and you might just be
as goodlooking as me
in this type of situation
scoffs laughs
seriously
this face is is set up well
beauty is a burden
chuckles
youll be all right
shao industries
what
obsidian fury has tech in it
made by shao industries
thats impossible
jules and her team
scanned every centimeter
of that jaeger
insulating metamaterials
wound counterclockwise
in the shunt cabling
shaos the only company
that winds them that way
amara are you sure about what
youre telling me right now
yes
yeah
i stole a ton to make scrapper
i thought
it might be important
yeah
lock beeps
thank you
gottlieb
shao industries
they dont even have
a bio division
yeah not that we know of
cabling could have been stolen
just like in amaras jaeger
were gonna need more than that
to connect fury to shao
what about newt
hed have access
to the internal records
the shipping manifests
jake all right
go see him
keep a low profile
i have a mission
finally
well take what we know
to the marshal
announcement over speakers

the building is secure maam
no visitors without the proper credentials
i dont want anyone interfering
with deployment
what is it

it really wasnt very hard to
reallocate a little over here
and a little over there
and slip in a little kaiju
surprise without you noticing
distorted
especially since you always thought
you were the smartest person in the room
in about a second im going to be
stop wait wait wait
gunshot
newts not in control

it isnt him
its the precursors
they must have infected
his mind

gottlieb
jake thank god
were under attack
you need to force liwen

itit was newt
the precursors
theyve infected him
theyre controlling his mind
gottlieb can you get him
to disable the drones
no he got away
tires screeching
gottlieb shut em down

the breaches are closed
i repeat

alarm beeping
oh no
oh no what
three kaiju
have gotten through
south korea russian coast
and east china sea
two cat 4s and a cat 5
jake
copy that
get back to the dome
were gonna need
all the help we can get
urgent chatter
you girls okay
yes maam
yes maam
groans loudly
all right what do we got
the reports are
still coming in
but drones took out jaegers and
shatterdomes across the rim
all right how many jaegers
do we have here
operational
gipsy avenger barely
thats it  yeah
okay we need more jaegers
up and running or this is
gonna be a short fight
even if we can
all of our other pilots
are either dead
or severely injured
okay okay
one disaster at a time
lets just focus
on those jaegers
smallie come over here
i need you to help jules
with the repairs
can you do that
i thought i was kicked out
im kicking you back in
shes pretty good
at turning junk into jaegers
you good with that
hell yeah
right we got a lot of work to do
and not a lot of time
we got incoming
aircraft approaching
i brought some help
hakuja shrikethorn
and the big fella raijin
i took the liberty of
assigning the designations
well the spiky guy
and the big idiot
are moving away from the cities
and towards the ocean
what does that mean
maybe theyre trying
to link up with hakuja
in the east china sea
yeah i bet newt would know
what theyre up to
if we can get it out of him
yeah wed have
to find him first
any jaegers closer
to those kaiju than us
what was left of the chindo
and the sakhalinsk domes
tried to intercept
emphasis on tried
im afraid were on our own
theres got to be
something here
something in
the east china sea
maybe thats not
where theyre headed
pull up a map of
kaiju movement from the war
pushing data to main display
what do you know
something we dont
you said we need to understand
our enemys objective
to know weve beaten them
what if the kaiju
werent blindly attacking
our cities during the war
what if we were
just in their way
beeping
well right here
mount fuji japan
extrapolate for hakuja
shrikethorn and raijin
mount fuji but why
rare earth elements
huh
mount fuji is a volcano
rich in rare earth elements
kaiju blood reacts
extremely violently
with rare earth elements
is the basis of
my fuelthruster experiments
excuse me
oh that sounds bad
thats bad right
very mount fujis active
a geological pressure point
based on the bloodtomass
ratio of the kaiju
the reaction would cause
a cascade event
igniting the ring of fire
around the pacific rim
billions of tons
of toxic gas and ash
will spew into the atmosphere
wiping out all life
and finish terraforming
the earth for the precursors
we cant let em
reach mount fuji
im gonna check with jules
for jaeger repairs
even if we had
a hundred jaegers
theres no way
to intercept in time
what about your thruster pods
gottlieb oh no no no no
theyre not theyre not ready
can they be
well in theory
if it um
maybe withwith your help
gottlieb what does that mean
in theory
today
it means yes
female voice power partially
restored in sectors two
saber athena guardian bravo
and bracer phoenix
are good to go
its not a lot to work with
if liwen can patch
some fury tech into gipsy
that might help
alarm blares
okay
prep everything we got for deployment
okay
dont get yourself killed
you either
well thats confusing
lets just stay focused
we got four jaegers against
two category 4s and a fiver
its better than just gipsy
we still need pilots
we have em
oh shit
if my dad was here hed
probably give you a big speech
make you feel invincible
im not my father
im not a hero like he was
like raleigh becket
and mako mori
but they didnt start out
that way
they started out as cadets
just like you
we remember them as giants
because they stood tall
because they stood together
it doesnt matter
who your parents are
where you came from
who believed in you
and who didnt
we are a family now
and we are earths
last defense
this is our time this is our
chance to make a difference
