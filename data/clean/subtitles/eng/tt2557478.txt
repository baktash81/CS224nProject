my generation   
we were born into war 
 indistinct chatter over comms 
giant monsters attacked
our world 
 roars 
we called  em kaiju 
 roars 
they came through the breach 
a gateway to another dimension
at the bottom
of the pacific ocean 
they were sent by an alien race
on the other side   
the precursors 
we fought back 
building our own monsters 
jaegars    giant robots 
so big they needed
two pilots to run  em 
my father was one of them 
he sacrificed himself
to help save the world 
i    am not my father 
  whoa  
    ooh  yeah  
   whoops 
it s been ten years
since we won the war
and closed the breach 
most of the world s recovered 
but a few coastal cities
never did 
and the world is still
picking up the pieces 
  wizzy boy  make me dance  
  daddy yo  
    make me dance   
  but some of us
live better in a broken world 
   snoring 
and squatting in half a mansion
is better than paying
for some crappy apartment 
now  in the relief zones 
you have to get creative 
you have to hustle 
or somebody else
might eat your breakfast 
and your cookies 
 sniffs 
and your damn hot sauce 
you know  out here 
we place a different value
on things 
the pan pacific defense corps
usually looks the other way
as long as you don t go poking
around where you don t belong 
say  like a   
decommissioned
jaeger scrapyard 
big risks mean big reward 
and nothing pays more
than stolen jaeger tech 
plenty of nutcases out here
trying to slap together
their own jaegers 
 indistinct chatter on comms 
but they need
the parts to do it 
so  if you can steal
what no one else can steal   
   you can live like a king 
 scanner beeping 
are you sure it s in here 
power cores are stripped
before they get decommissioned 
but sometimes they miss
the tertiary plasma capacitors 
and that s a big score 
this one s still
holding a charge 
oh 
you better hope so 
okay 
let s just calm down 
let s not get excited 
i m just playing the odds here 
you cheated barada in juarez 
skipped out on chau
in hong kong 
now  that was
a misunderstanding 
and stole from me   
in my own backyard 
now i m stealing for you 
circle of life 
we good 
you deliver   
and yeah   
we re good 
okay

lay it on me 
what do i got to do

something here 
  now i m not so sure 
   vik chuckles 
how am i supposed to drift
in this thing 
it smells like feet 
i didn t ask for
your excuses  cadet 
you putting her
up against kaiju
that almost killed veteran
pilots doesn t make any sense 
well  maybe she s not the only
one that doesn t belong here 
wow  see  nate  i know
you have a problem with me 
but come on 
she s just a kid 
so were we 
that s the point 
you make stronger connections
when you re young 
and that kind of bond makes
for a better drift pilot 
yeah  i remember the pitch 
thanks 
ryoichi  renata  you re up 
show our new recruit
how it s done 
 jet engine whooshing

mm hmm 
we got to show them
that we can work together 
well  the war ended
ten years ago  man 
you just need to let that go 
just    woosah 
y you have to understand
your enemy s ob   
  you have   
   whipped cream sprays 
   whipped cream sprays 
  sorry  mate 
you have to understand
your enemy s objective
to know you ve defeated  em 
  we still don t 
  no 
i can help you out with that 
see  i m thinking it has
something to do with them
sending giant monsters
to kick the crap out of us 
no  no  no 
the precursors wouldn t send
kaiju to flatten a few cities
if they were trying
to wipe us all out 
all right  look  nate  i don t
have a problem with you  man 
but i had to make a choice 
it was between
your pretty face and prison 
i chose your pretty face 
oh  well  i m touched 
and how many damn toppings
do you need 
leave my toppings be  man 
don t mess with
my damn toppings 
so the cadets got  like  what 
couple of months
before they graduate 
  six 
  okay  i ll tell you what 
every time you want to say
something soldiery to  em 
i ll just nod  or like 
 yep  what he said  
and then  before you know it 
they get to be pilots 
  and i get to get back to my life 
  great 
boom 
it may happen
sooner than you think 
how so 
big dog and pony show tomorrow 
shao and her team
are presenting
this new drone program
they have 
could make us all obsolete 
sounds like my
 get out of jail free  card 
you know  you can front
all you want 
but you and i both know
you could ve been great 
 engine rumbling 
ms  shao  marshall quan 
it s an honor to meet you 
sorry   chuckles 
she doesn t do
the whole hand shaking thing 
dr  newton geiszler 
head of research
and development
for shao industries 
that s a nice firm 
firm grip you got there  uh   
hand hard very shake 
thank you for having us 
ranger lambert and i will get you set up  ma am 
that s a much better
look on you 
guess it s better than
prison stripes  barely 
 chuckles 
i i m sorry  is this him 
it it s got to be him  right 
you re stacker s kid 
hey  uh  i m newt 
i was  uh  i was a big fan
of your father s 
amazing speech writer 
by the way 
did you ever hear his one where
he canceled the apocalypse 
  newton 
  hermann 
i was hoping you d be
tagging along 
i could use your help on
an experiment i m working on 
now  this will
only take a moment 
  i know how busy you are 
  yeah 
don t want to impose 
but  uh   
aw  come on 
you can t impose on me 
i mean  we ve been inside
each other s heads  right 
we ve saved the world 
we ve drifted with a kaiju 
you know  if we hadn t
yanked that intel
out of that kaiju s brain 
raleigh would ve never
been able to close the breach 
now  that was you
and that was me 
technically more me 
but any chance we could
make this quick or    
  um  deployment 
  huh 
of jaegers 
deploying them into battle 
it takes  takes too much time 
the amount of damage
a kaiju can inflict
before they ve ev   
ah  here 
i think i ve found a solution 
hermann  you know i can
never read your  uh   
uh  rocket thrusters  huh 
yeah  no 
no  there s no fuel
in the world
with that kind of
boost to mass ratio   chuckles 
from this world 
no 
i is that kaiju blood 
exactly 
i ve discovered kaiju blood
is highly reactive
when it s combined
with rare earth elements   
cerium  lanthanum  gadolinium 
i realize that  pal  okay 
y you can t be fooling around
with this stuff 
you re gonna blow yourself up 
uh   
now  no one knows more about
kaiju morphology than you 
  okay 
  and if you could just take a look  please 
no  hermann  i got to stop you 
look  none of this matters 
once my boss  drones
are approved 
deployment time 
that s gonna be a non issue 
within a year  buddy  we re
gonna have drones everywhere 
so you won t help me 
look  why don t we talk about
it over dinner at my place 
okay  you can
finally meet alice 
i don t need
a hot meal  newton 
what i need is a solution
to a very specific problem 
  hey 
   watch beeps 
ah  that s me  bud 
i m sorry  duty calls 
it s been nice catching up 
newton 
i  um   
i still get nightmares
about what we saw
when we drifted with
that disgusting kaiju brain 
yeah 
but    it was a hell
of a rush  wasn t it 
dr  geizler  time to go 
okay  okay 
you and dr  gottleib were close  weren t you 
during the war 
oh  uh   
we shared lab yes okay 
speak english  your mandarin
makes you sound like an idiot 
i i know  i m terrible 
uh  yes  we shared
a lab together 
what were you and dr  gottlieb talking about 
oh  some crazy idea
he had about
thruster pods
on a  on a jaeger 
until secretary general mori makes her
recommendation at the council summit 
i can t afford a misstep 
no more contact with him   
until after the vote 
oh  well   chuckles  the man s
completely harmless  uh   
   speaks mandarin 
  uh  okay 
could you say that again 
and this time about 80  slower 
i said don t make me question
your loyalty  understand 
ay   chuckles 
what s to question 
i    look  i barely
talk to the guy anyway 
then it won t be a problem 
and work on your mandarin 
i do not like to repeat
myself 
in any language 
liwen 
my drones are the next step
in jaeger evolution 
the system i designed
processes commands
through a quantum data core 
this means that a single pilot
can operate the drone remotely
from anywhere in the world 
as soon as the council
approves deployment 
based on secretary general
mori s final report 
the days of struggling
to find and train
drift compatible pilots
will be a thing of the past 
and you think a bunch of desk
jockeys are better than us 
we are not here
to shut you down 
cooperation between
our programs
has never been more vital 
if there are any questions 
  yeah  i got a question right over here 
   clamoring 
we are pilots 
not a bunch of office workers 
and now we re shouting 
there s no need to shout 
 clamoring continues 
jake 
well  that was slick 
so  how long until all this is
shut down so i can go home 
i don t trust the tech 
not yet  at least 
well  it looks
pretty good to me 
remote systems can be
hacked or compromised 
no  you ve got
the key vote  right 
so there you go 
it s your decision 
i wish i could just
go ahead and approve them 
nearly half the council
is backing liwen 
they aren t going to like
my decision 
who cares what they like
and what they don t like 
i ll tell you what 
i m gonna go with you 
for moral support 
plus  i want to get
out of this place 
i m glad you offered 
because i already requested
gipsy avenger as honor guard
at the council summit 
look  you know
gipsy s nate s ride 
his copilot works for
liwen now  he needs a new one 
one that you already know
is drift compatible 
all right 
i ll do it 
i got your back 
but i want to be there
when you tell nate 
 cause i just want
to see his face 
he s gonna be so pissed 
he s just gonna
stand there like 
 yeah  i don t think
you belong in a jaeger  jake 
get out of my jaeger 
i m handsome and sexy  
 mako chuckles 
he is handsome 
he is sexy 
thank you  jake

 sniffles  sighs 
  what is it 
  a message  from mako 
gottlieb  she was trying
to send it from her copter
right before it went down 
it s a data package 
high density 
obsidian fury
was jamming comms 
how could her signal
get through 
quan 
it didn t 
  at least not intact 
  so it s gone 
gottlieb  well   gone  is
relative in the digital realm 
by running a modified
fractal algorithm 
i might be able to reconstruct
a few megabytes 
there 
is that a kaiju 
i m checking against
ppdc kaiju archives 
 computer buzzes loudly 
no match against the database 
keep looking 
whatever this is 
it was important to her 
i want to know why 
and i want to know who was
piloting that rogue jaeger 
 indistinct chatter 
hey 
 chuckles 
sorry i m  uh  i i m late 
i i thought you were
still in sydney 
the council has approved drone deployment
in an emergency session 
oh 
uh   
that s great 
thought you d be a little
more enthusiastic  doc 
yeah  no  i m i m pumped 
this is great 
uh  it s just
the timing of everything 
with the attack and all 
  feels a little   
  i was there 
i know what happened 
and it wouldn t have   
if our drones had been in the field 
automated voice 
neural connection terminated 
now everyone sees that 
yeah 
uh  i guess they do 
which means the attack was positive   
all things considered 
if you look at it sideways
and you squint 
then maybe you could say that 
uh  i m sorry  what are you   
what    what s going on here 
the council expects full deployment
within 48 hours 
 inhales 
48 is a   
i ve worked my whole life for this 
get it done 
okay 
yeah 
not a problem 
that that ll be fine 
48 hours  no way we ll be ready 
y you don t think
there s a way 
all right  well 
then you re fired 
okay  how about that 
or maybe you re promoted 
i don t know 
we ll see how it goes 
just get it done 
 frustrated groan 
give me this 
 sighs 
    i want to know what love is  plays loudly 
  hey  honey

 groans  god  things were

 volume lowers     this
mountain i must climb     
all those people

my boss almost got killed 
that could ve been bad 
maybe 
i guess  i don t know 
that would ve been great 
actually 
that one is all over me 
i mean  i can t get
a break from her 
i m ranting

   echoing heartbeat 
reporter 
hundreds of police officers   
they re calling it
obsidian fury 
there s never been a rogue
like this 
meilin 
news feed said
they were posting a dozen
jaegers at the memorial 
when i die  i want that many
to send me off 
your pop s gonna make you work
with boobs when you wash out 
jaegers do not show up
when the boob guy dies 
wait  your dad

he s a plastic surgeon 
he doesn t just work with   
i m not gonna wash out 
i m gonna be a pilot 
still  you die 
meh  i post one jaeger
at your funeral 
 laughs 
  maybe half a jaeger 
   chuckles 
i heard that s where
they found amara 
in half a jaeger 
it was a whole jaeger 
it just wasn t very big 
viktoriya 
bigger is better 
 scoffs 
what did you say 
am i saying that right 
yep 
  ah 
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa 
  whoa  whoa  whoa 
  guys 
i worked every day of my life
to be here 
you didn t do anything 
you were just picked up
off the street like garbage 
   grunting 
  guys  come on 
hey  hey 
  hey  whoa  whoa  whoa 
  you know where i learned that 
on the streets 
you big  dumb   
ranger on deck 
   coughs 
  she jumped me 
she doesn t belong here 
i don t care 
you know  when i first joined
the corps  i was just like you 
worse  i was nobody 
but that woman
we laid to rest today 
mako mori  she said 
 whoever you are 
 the minute you enter this
program  you join a family 
 and no matter what they do 
no matter how stupid
they may act sometimes    
    you forgive  em
and you move on  
so you start believing that 
in here 
and you ll start believing
in a jaeger 
jules 
hey 
marshal s looking for you guys 
says gottlieb found something 
it isn t something 
it s somewhere 
severnaya zemlya 
off siberia s taymyr peninsula 
what s in zemlya 
gottlieb 
well  nothing anymore 
a facility roughly
in this location
was used to manufacture jaeger
power cores earlier in the war 
  but it was decommissioned years ago 
  why would
mako be trying to tell us
about an abandoned factory
in the middle of nowhere 
sir  permission
to take gipsy avenger
to see what the hell s
out there 
 footfalls pounding 
female voice 
scanning 
 sighs  looks like
mako s message was a dead end 
this place is abandoned 
no  no  wait a second 
i m getting
some weird readings 
   alarm blaring 
  incoming 
  take out his legs 
   shouts 
   alarm blaring 
  we got to get out of here 
 grunts 
plasma cannon 
  think we pissed him off 
  good 
you remember our old move 
hell yeah 
he looks hurt 
go for his power core 
ah 
 groaning 
 shouts 
female voice 
warning 
 shouts 
 robotic groaning 
 over speakers  
pilots of obsidian fury 
get the hell out
of your conn pod 
what the hell is that 
it s definitely kaiju 
a secondary brain used to
control the hindquarters 
how d they get into our world 
there hasn t been a breach
in ten years 
sensors would ve picked it up 
i don t think
there was a breach 
kaiju flesh   
has a distinct radioactive
half life signature 
particular to the anteverse 
this specimen does not 
wait  so  you re you re saying
that it s from our universe 
the genetic fingerprints
indicate distinctly terrestrial
modification techniques 
probably engineered
from kaiju flesh left over
from the war 
precursors didn t do this 
humans did 
suresh 
oh  my god 
that hunk of slimy crap
was piloting obsidian fury 
amara 
we got to get a look inside 
inside 
that thing s part kaiju 
come on  guys  when are we
ever gonna get a chance
to see something
like this again 
never 
never would be good 
you guys can stay here 
i m going 
no  amar    amara 
guys  guys 
we should not be in here 
 liquid dripping 
whoa 
it s fused all the way
through the system 
like    muscle tissue 
jinhai  that s how it was able
to move like it did 
  cool 
  yeah  cool 
working with boobs is sounding
better and better 
shine your light over here 
suresh  oh  yeah  let s just
go yank on the guts
of the weird ass kaiju killbot 
what is it 
  i think it s some sort of   
   sizzles 
   screams 
  jinhai 
i told you
not to yank on those 
go get help  go 
suresh 
man  we are so screwed 
 muffled   this goes way past
what she did 
quan 
the decision has been made 
security will take it
from here 
we re done 
 lock beeps 
is jinhai okay 
he s got some scarring 
but yeah  he ll live 
marshal put him on probation 
meilin and suresh  too 
they blink wrong 
all of  em are out 
no  it s not their fault 
  i talked them into it 
  i m sorry  i tried to talk
to the marshal  but   
you re dismissed
from the program 
never belonged here anyway 
really 
you know  i used to say
the same thing a long time ago 
but i actually didn t
want to be here 
still don t 
why d you sign up 
we were at war 
and my dad
was leading the charge
and i thought   
maybe i could see more of him 
maybe even drift with him 
well  one night 
me and nate got into it 
it was over something stupid 
i can t even remember what 
so i climbed in an old mark 4
just to show him i didn t
need him to be a great pilot 
that s pretty dumb 
  yeah 
  how far d you get 
  about seven steps  well  take or leave 
  how far did you get 
about two steps  then
i blacked out from the strain 
and the first thing i saw
when i woke up was my dad 
just standing right
in front of me  looking stern 
wh what d he say 
he said i was
out of the program 
he said i didn t deserve
to be in a jaeger 
look  he said a lot of things 
a year later  my dad was gone 
and i didn t get a chance
to prove him wrong 
more importantly  i didn t get
a chance to prove it to myself 
you listen to me 
don t let what other people
think of you
define who you are 
you won t like
where that takes you 
do you understand 
and keep your head up 
and you might just be
as good looking as me
in this type of situation 
   scoffs  laughs 
  seriously 
this face is  is set up well 
beauty is a burden 
 chuckles 
you ll be all right 
shao industries 
what 
obsidian fury has tech in it
made by shao industries 
that s impossible 
jules and her team
scanned every centimeter
of that jaeger 
insulating metamaterials
wound counterclockwise
in the shunt cabling 
shao s the only company
that winds them that way 
amara  are you sure about what
you re telling me right now 
yes 
yeah 
i stole a ton to make scrapper 
i thought
it might be important 
yeah 
   lock beeps 
  thank you 
gottlieb 
shao industries 
they don t even have
a bio division 
yeah  not that we know of 
cabling could have been stolen 
just like in amara s jaeger 
we re gonna need more than that
to connect fury to shao 
what about newt 
he d have access
to the internal records 
  the shipping manifests   
  jake  all right 
go see him 
keep a low profile 
i have a mission 
finally 
we ll take what we know
to the marshal 
 announcement over speakers
in mandarin 
the building is secure  ma am 
no visitors without the proper credentials 
i don t want anyone interfering
with deployment 
what is it 
i ll be in my office 
okay 
this isn t fair 
i m sorry 
you don t deserve this 
it was my fault 
this is on me 
amara 
the next jaeger you build   
make it a big one 
 helicopter blades whirring 
automated voice 
system online 
and we have delivery
at 100   people 
  system online 
  a hundred percent 
that s the way
that it s done  okay 
  i told you we could do it  and we did it 
   beeping 
automated voice 
malfunction 
i m losing uplink to drone 375 
  why 
  malfunction 
   burke grunting 
  why  figure out why 
quan  we ll take what we know
to the council in person 
prep a transport 
give me a second 
the drones in the field are malfunctioning 
stop the ones coming in from deploying 
 electricity crackling 
  get to gipsy  go 
   alarm wailing 
 drone roaring 
 over p a   
all pilots 
man your jaegers
and engage hostiles 
 drone squeals 
okay  you got this 
you cool 
yeah  super cool 
just  uh  just stay calm 
doctor geiszler  shao s looking for you 
i i know  i m heading up 
i m heading right   
hermann 
uh  what are you doing here 
how d you get in here 
i do have ppdc credentials 
and besides 
everyone else seems
a little bit preoccupied
with the killer drones
your boss just set off 
 grunts 
   amplified panting 
   muffled shouting  screaming 
  she used you 
  no 
  she lured you with money and a fancy title 
  no  no way 
and while you were
basking in the glow 
she took your research
and she twisted it 
help me stop her  newton 
help me save the world
like old times 
all right  technically  uh 
you were helping me last time 
  let s get that straight 
  fine 
help me help you
save the world 
what do you say 
well  i say  um  i say   
don t shoot 
uh     speaks mandarin 
goddamn it 
why can t i get this language 
  what s happening  
  amara  are those jaegers 
no  they re drones
from shao industries 
what are they doing 
i don t know 
they just went crazy 
hey  clear the deck now 
get back to your quarters
right now 
  yes  sir  go  go  go 
  go  go 
go  get the hell out of here 
come on 
   screams 
  come on 
come on  come on 
get up 
 alarm wailing 
really  now 
  the girl from ipanema 
playing over elevator speakers 
 gottlieb coughing 
 coughing loudly 
hermann  a little help 
   elevator bell dings 
  next time  why don t you learn
how to use a gun 
take that 
  vile  vile individual 
   newt laughs 
 panting 
  thank you  newton 
  yeah 
i d hug you if i didn t
have a rule about
  public displays of affection 
  it s fine 
  oh  to hell with it 
  okay  all right 
if you re done groping me 
let s take care
of the drones  right 
  mm 
  okay 
 alarm beeping 
  shut down all systems  now 
   woman screams 
everyone  get out of the lab
or i will shoot you 
i will shoot you twice 
  always knew you d go nuts 
  you re officially fired  get out 
what do we do 
how do we stop this 
  there s a back door  hermann 
  to what 
to the drone subroutine 
i added a subroutine just
in case i want to get in here
  and poke around down the road 
  oh  sneaky bastard 
   laughs  i know  right 
   computer whirring 
 alarm beeping 
what did you just do 
what i ve been planning
the last ten years 
i m ending the world 
   panicked shouting 
   alarm beeping 
where the hell are my pilots  
sitrep 
breaches detected  multiple locations 
it s the drones  sir 
 over p a   
all pilots  breaches detected 
drones in the field
are opening multiple breaches
across the pacific rim 
 quan yelling 
why 
why would you do this 
why would i do this  mm 
well  i guess i wouldn t 
well  not normally 
not really my style 
yeah  no  i don t know  maybe
i hate you all for treating me
like an insignificant
little joke of a man 
maybe that s why he did it 
hermann    i did it 
uh  see   chuckles 
there you go 
there s the problem 
i m just not feeling
totally myself these days 
you 
   beep 
   electrical whirring 
precursors 
very good  hermann 
you figured it out 
and as usual  a step behind 
newton  you are a good man 
  no  uh  hermann 
  you must stop 
no  there s no point
in fighting them 
  you must fight back 
  i m not strong enough  hermann 
  please  newton  you must 
  i am not strong enough 
 distorted  
he is not strong enough 
none of you are strong enough 
 normal voice  
i m sorry  hermann 
they re in my head 
let him go 
you re not going to ruin my life s work 
oh  hey  boss 
 panicked shouting 
 drone roars 
man  go  go  go  go 
go  go  go  go  go 
what the hell
are you doing here 
  i told you to get to quarters 
  all the doors are blocked 
what do we do  
how did you do it without me knowing 
i mean  38  of your company
is fully automated 
it really wasn t very hard to
reallocate a little over here
and a little over there 
and slip in a little kaiju
surprise without you noticing 
 distorted  
especially since you always thought   
you were the smartest person in the room 
in about a second  i m going to be 
  stop  wait  wait  wait 
   gunshot 
newt s not in control
of himself 
it isn t him 
it s the precursors 
they must have infected
his mind
when we drifted with the kaiju 
shut up 
security  find and detain dr  geiszler 
if he tries to resist  put a bullet in his head 
you stay here  we re gonna
try and get to gipsy 
you ready for this 
  no  you 
  no 
  on three 
  great 
one  two   
gottlieb  over radio  
hello  anyone there 
gottlieb 
jake  thank god 
we re under attack 
you need to force liwen
  to shut down the drones 
  it isn t her 
it isn t liwen 
it it was newt 
the precursors 
they ve infected him 
they re controlling his mind 
gottlieb  can you get him
to disable the drones 
no  he got away 
 tires screeching 
gottlieb  shut  em down 
i ve penetrated the subroutine 
it it s trying to lock you out 
feedback loop 
 roaring 
jake  gottlieb 
what the hell is going on 
  gottlieb 
   amara gasps 
 roars 
gottlieb  shut  em down
or we re gonna die 
 roaring 
shut  em down 
   drone roaring 
   electrical whirring 
yes 
 kaiju growling 
 roaring 
liwen has disabled the drones 
the breaches are closed 
i repeat 
the breaches are closed 
 alarm beeping 
oh  no 
 oh  no  what 
three kaiju
have gotten through 
south korea  russian coast 
and east china sea 
two cat 4s and a cat 5 
jake 
copy that 
get back to the dome 
we re gonna need
all the help we can get 
 urgent chatter 
you girls okay 
  yes  ma am 
  yes  ma am 
 groans loudly 
all right  what do we got 
the reports are
still coming in 
but drones took out jaegers and
shatterdomes across the rim 
all right  how many jaegers
do we have here 
operational 
gipsy avenger  barely 
  that s it    yeah 
  okay  we need more jaegers
up and running or this is
gonna be a short fight 
even if we can 
all of our other pilots
are either dead
or severely injured 
okay  okay 
one disaster at a time 
let s just focus
on those jaegers 
smallie  come over here 
i need you to help jules
with the repairs 
  can you do that 
  i thought i was kicked out 
i m kicking you back in 
she s pretty good
at turning junk into jaegers 
you good with that 
  hell yeah 
  right  we got a lot of work to do
and not a lot of time 
we got incoming 
 aircraft approaching 
i brought some help 
hakuja  shrikethorn 
and the big fella  raijin 
i took the liberty of
assigning the designations 
well  the spiky guy
and the big idiot
are moving away from the cities
and towards the ocean 
  what does that mean 
  maybe they re trying
to link up with hakuja
in the east china sea 
yeah  i bet newt would know
what they re up to 
if we can get it out of him 
yeah  we d have
to find him first 
any jaegers closer
to those kaiju than us 
what was left of the chin do
and the sakhalinsk domes
tried to intercept   
emphasis on  tried  
i m afraid we re on our own 
there s got to be
something here 
something in
the east china sea 
maybe that s not
where they re headed 
pull up a map of
kaiju movement from the war 
pushing data to main display 
what  do you know
something we don t 
you said we need to understand
our enemy s objective
to know we ve beaten them 
what if the kaiju
weren t blindly attacking
our cities during the war 
what if we were
just in their way 
 beeping 
well  right here 
mount fuji  japan 
extrapolate for hakuja 
shrikethorn and raijin 
mount fuji  but why 
  rare earth elements 
  huh 
mount fuji is a volcano
rich in rare earth elements 
kaiju blood reacts
extremely violently
with rare earth elements
is the basis of
my fuel thruster experiments 
excuse me 
oh  that sounds bad 
that s bad  right 
very  mount fuji s active 
a geological pressure point 
based on the blood to mass
ratio of the kaiju 
the reaction would cause
a cascade event 
igniting the ring of fire
around the pacific rim 
billions of tons
of toxic gas and ash
will spew into the atmosphere 
wiping out all life 
and finish terraforming
the earth for the precursors 
we can t let  em
reach mount fuji 
i m gonna check with jules
for jaeger repairs 
even if we had
a hundred jaegers 
there s no way
to intercept in time 
  what about your thruster pods 
  gottlieb  oh  no  no  no  no 
they re not  they re not ready 
  can they be 
  well  in theory 
if it  um   
maybe  with with your help 
gottlieb  what does that mean 
 in theory  
today   
it means yes 
female voice  power partially
restored in sectors two   
saber athena  guardian bravo 
and bracer phoenix
are good to go 
it s not a lot to work with 
if liwen can patch
some fury tech into gipsy 
that might help 
   alarm blares 
  okay 
  prep everything we got for deployment 
  okay 
don t get yourself killed 
you either 
well  that s confusing 
let s just stay focused 
we got four jaegers against
two category 4s and a fiver 
it s better than just gipsy 
we still need pilots 
we have  em 
oh  shit 
if my dad was here  he d
probably give you a big speech 
make you feel invincible 
i m not my father 
i m not a hero like he was 
like raleigh becket
and mako mori 
but they didn t start out
that way 
they started out as cadets 
just like you 
we remember them as giants
because they stood tall 
because they stood together 
it doesn t matter
who your parents are 
where you came from 
who believed in you
and who didn t 
we are a family now 
and we are earth s
last defense
