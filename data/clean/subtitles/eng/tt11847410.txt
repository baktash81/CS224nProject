your dad and i support that
thank you
theres just one thing
anna were you tired a lot
before the incident
chuckles
lol
you called it the incident
um
no i guess im just
always tired
i mean i guess thats what
caffeine is for
right
what do you do
when you get tired
sleep for like
14 hours straight
ooh i really like watching
early seasons
of the kardashians
the og hidden hills shit
that is my vibe
whats this youre just
gonna fax that to my mom or
fax
vada yes fax
what are you a time traveler
from the 80s
laughs
i mean i had my suspicions
when i saw those sneakers
but now im pretty convinced
touche
touche
look i know this whole
therapy thing is weird
and can be uncomfortable
but everything that you say
in here is confidential
and side note i actually do
really like your shoes
theyre very cool
no i know thank you
are there things that you dont
feel comfortable talking
to your parents about that
maybe you wanna share with me
yeah
my porn addiction
okay
im so sorry im
laughs when i get nervous
i make really inappropriate
jokes so my bad
you dont have to be sorry
and you dont
have to be nervous
well i know that my parents
are worried about me
and they think i need help
but i get it
and thats fine
but i personally am fine
like i feel like im really
good at managing my emotions
its
what do you mean by that
im just very chill
like a very lowkey person
so when it comes to emotional
stuff or drama im like
okay is this
really productive
yeah i get it
but you know just because
it doesnt necessarily mean
that someones being dramatic
because theyre emotional
you know for a lot of people
they need to fully experience
their emotions
in order to process
what theyve been through
so that they can begin to heal
its actually really healthy
to show your emotion
i know most people
come in here crying
about their cheating husbands
vada i wanna talk about you
i wanna know how that
shooting at your school
has made you feel
i feel
sighs
its okay
i mean it makes sense
i want you to track
how youre feeling
using this worksheet
so theres questions on there
thatll guide you
you dont have to overthink it
its just basically there to
hold space for you to
to understand whatever
emotions may come up
all you have to do
is try and feel
thats it
no matter what
those feelings are
then you can bring it back next
session and well go through it
or you know
you can fax it to me
if thats easier for you
patricia she said you were incredibly
bright and smart and funny
veda wait
is she in love with me
oh whats the point of
goin to therapy
if theyre just gonna tell their
parents everything they said after
honey she didnt
tell me anything
she gave me a general assessment
of how the session went
thats all
amelia she thought you were doing really well
considering what you
went through

on their hands
we want real change
we want real leadership
honest politics that make
our schools a safe place
for us to learn and grow
and we want it

on a bridge somewhere and
then to hear like how freaked

everything you put them through

okay i
like im sorry for like
calling you and dumping
all of this on you
