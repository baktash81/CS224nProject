of the largest eight
in the world

right 
what do you do

14 hours straight 
ooh  i really like watching
early seasons
of the kardashians 
the og hidden hills shit 
that is my vibe 
what s this  you re just

what are you  a time traveler
from the  80s 
 laughs 
i mean  i had my suspicions
when i saw those sneakers 
but now i m pretty convinced 
touche 
touche 
look  i know this whole
therapy thing is weird
and can be uncomfortable 
but everything that you say
in here is confidential 
and  side note  i actually do
really like your shoes 
they re very cool 
no  i know  thank you 
are there things that you don t
feel comfortable talking
to your parents about that
maybe you wanna share with me 
yeah 
my porn addiction 
okay 
i m so sorry  i m   
 laughs  when i get nervous 
i make really inappropriate
jokes  so  my bad 
you don t have to be sorry 
and you don t
have to be nervous 
well  i know that my parents
are worried about me
and they think i need help 
but i get it 
and that s fine 
but i personally am fine 
like i feel like i m really
good at managing my emotions 
it s   
what do you mean by that 
i m just very chill 
like a very low key person 
so when it comes to emotional
stuff or drama i m like
 okay  is this
really productive  
yeah  i get it 
but you know  just because   
it doesn t necessarily mean
that someone s being dramatic
because they re emotional 
you know  for a lot of people 
they need to fully experience
their emotions 
in order to process
what they ve been through 
so that they can begin to heal 
it s actually really healthy
to show your emotion 
i know most people
come in here crying
about their cheating husbands 
vada  i wanna talk about you 
i wanna know how that
shooting at your school
has made you feel 
i feel   
 sighs 
it s okay 
i mean  it makes sense 
i want you to track
how you re feeling
using this worksheet 
so there s questions on there
that ll guide you 
you don t have to overthink it 
it s just basically there to
hold space for you to   
to understand whatever
emotions may come up 
all you have to do
is try and feel 
that s it 
no matter what
those feelings are 
then you can bring it back next
session and we ll go through it 
or you know 
you can fax it to me 
if that s easier for you 
 patricia  she said you were incredibly
bright  and smart  and funny 
 veda  wait 
is she in love with me 
oh  what s the point of
goin  to therapy 
if they re just gonna tell their
parents everything they said after 
honey  she didn t
tell me anything 
she gave me a general assessment
of how the session went 
  that s all 
   amelia  she thought you were doing really well 
considering what you
went through 
  excuse me 
   patricia  amelia

 somber music playing 
we won t live our lives scared
to go to school every day 
we can t accept a world
in which the federal government
thinks american high school
students getting gunned down
in their classrooms
isn t a priority 
we won t accept that our leaders
have nra money in their pockets
and our blood
on their hands 
we want real change 
we want real leadership 
honest politics that make
our schools a safe place
for us to learn and grow 
and we want it
before it s too late 
can i have some wine

 okay  they don t have tusks 
but like at least 
they re alive   you know 
it s so messed up 
no  and then it makes me think
about the uh  what s his name

apparently  he s like
some trophy hunter 
but the thing about that one is
like i don t know
if i have the right to be mad
about that 
 cause i don t know
if it s true or not 
so every time i see it 
i m like   is this real 
or is it like this fake news  
like   can i trust this meme  
can you be honest with me
for like 2 5 seconds 
  am i being annoying

worried about you 
when i didn t hear back

i felt like i had to call
your mom 
 cause the last time
i had seen you 
you had literally done drugs
at school 
so i was like   okay  cool 
maybe she s like having
a serotonin drop from hell
and she s like suicidal
on a bridge somewhere and   
then to hear like how freaked
your family was all night 
i just   
i don t know  i hoped that
whatever you went and did was worth
everything you put them through 
but  you know what 
i m guessing uh  it s more likely
you were with mia reed somewhere 
acting like nothing happened 
why re you being like this 
because i ve
waited for you  vada 
for a month 
i ve given you space and love to heal 
but i ve been dealing with this
my own way 
you haven t dealt with
anything  that s the problem 
all i wanna do is try
my hardest to stop this
from ever happening again 
like why is that so hard
for you to understand 
that s not fucking fair  nick 
none of this is fair  vada 
yeah  yeah 
mmm hmm  go be with mia 
she s gonna save the world
with her hot ass 
fuck you  nick 
wow

he s just hurtin  
i think we all are 
he was so cruel about it 
yeah  but you know 
he s under a lot of pressure 
he has to be the face of this 
just act brave  but  well 
he s scared  too 
you know 
fear makes people act crazy 
okay  i   
like i m sorry for like
calling you and dumping
all of this on you 
especially  because it s
been the hardest on you 
it s hard on everyone 
i think for me  you know 
when it hurts too much 
i think about
how this can t be for nothing 
like  oh  we won t even let
this be for not    like  it   
it can t be for nothing 
you know 
fuck  yeah 
tell me about your brother 
i just wanna know
more about him 
he was  uh  real quiet
when you first met him 
he watched everything now 
you know 
like  he d be like 
 oh  that girl is gonna go home
with that guy
and that guy is gonna go home
with that girl and    
like  he was always right 
he was funny 
like always making me laugh 
he  uh   
he sounds dope

to say like   
i just   
i know he s still with me 
he s not gonna let me
go back and be sad 
he s not gonna let me go
forward and freak out 
he keeps me here 
he keeps me calm 
i think he s definitely
still here
