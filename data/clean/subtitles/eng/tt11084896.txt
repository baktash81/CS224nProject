 zoetrope tinkling 
 spirit whinnying 
 cora  maybe father was wrong
taking lucky from you 
 jim  no  he was right 
i couldn t keep her mother safe 
how was i supposed to keep her safe 
what happened to milagro was an accident

a hundred times before
with her eyes closed 
  ugh

well 
the apple doesn t fall far from the tree 
she s just not safe here

and that didn t work out 
 spirit whinnies

what she needs now more than anything
is her father

i couldn t bear it
if anything happened to her 
cora  i don t know what i m doing 
 snoring 
 wolf howling 
   whinnying in distance 
   gasps

 whinnying continues 
 insects chittering 
 whinnying continues

 horse whinnies 
  oh

hello  little brave one 
 horses whinnying in distance 
what s wrong 
all right  boys  let s round  em up 
  i told you boys we d get the rest of  em 
  leave them alone 
   man 1  you take that one 
   man 2  come on  boys

 hendricks

you can t do this 
 hendricks 
ain t no first class on this train 
 exclaims 
yeah  i got you now  boy 
stop  those horses aren t yours 
these horses are none of your business 
but thank you for leading me
straight to them 
 man 1  watch out for that stallion 
hendricks  we gotta go
if we re gonna make that boat 
change of plans  boys 
the crazy one stays here 
get off me 
hurry it up  let s go 
spirit  wait  spirit 
   panting 
   rooster crowing 
 nickers 
spirit 
we can t do this alone 
all right  boy 
let s go get help 
pru  i need your help 
so  you want us to get on our horses 
ride all night to stop a speeding train 
take down a band of dirty  old thieves
and release a herd of wild horses 
yeah  maybe 
lucky  that s crazy 
but if we don t try 
spirit s herd is gone forever 
you know what they do to horses up north 
they work them to death 
okay  let me show you
exactly how impossible it is 
hendricks and his men are headed
for a boat up here at the docks
on a speeding train 
and we re down here with horses 
it s too far 
what if we take a shortcut
over this big  pointy thingy 
 pru 
that big pointy thing is heck mountain 
   hawk screeches 
  it s impossible to cross on horseback 
that s a full day
and most of the night s ride 
and  even if by some miracle
we did make it 
how are we supposed to get the horses off
of a moving train 
if a train traveling at 25 miles an hour
has to stop every 100 miles 
aunt cora was right 
i do need to know this 
uh  what now 
the train has to stop
to refill water along the way 
if we cut over the mountain  we can
beat the train to this water depot at 
noon tomorrow 
  whoa  what s the ridge of regret 
  you don t wanna know 
   ukulele strumming 
  from what i hear 
there s a lot of dangers
lurking around those parts 
dangers that only those with good fortune
return from 
return from 
i ve heard tales 
the most treacherous and merciless
creatures hiding in the shadows 
creatures you wouldn t believe 
there s a moose  and he s a waitin  
but he doesn t know what he s waitin  for 
 bellows 
uh  how is she 
 abigail  and they say
at the bottom of a bridge is a shifty fox
who s just sitting there being shifty 
and then there s a possum
that just hangs out lighting matches 
 cackling maniacally 
 gasps  whoa 
abigail  not near the map 
i think what abigail is trying to say is
it s way too dangerous 
if you re not gonna help me 
spirit and i will be fine on our own 
you know  pru  you re right 
we would never be able to save those poor 
innocent  beautiful horses 
  i smell rule breaking 
   brays 
uh oh 
   abigail  hey  lucky  wait up 
   pru  lucky 
  lucky  wait for us 
  you changed your mind 
no  i still think this is a terrible idea 
but 
but 
this is miradero 
out here  we stick together 
thanks  guys 
you can thank us after we make it
over that big  pointy thing 
   abigail  heck mountain 
   hawk screeches 
we d better hurry up if we wanna make it
to the water depot before noon tomorrow 
  ooh  easy  boy 
  okay 
keep your heels down  shoulders back 
eyes where you want him to go 
yeah  but  like  not so 
   roars  you re liable to cramp 
  i know  i know 
hold on  spirit  careful 
careful 
when you trust yourself 
your horse will too 
he ll know exactly what you re thinking 
then you ll be joined up 
 joined up  
that s my favorite trail song 
 groans 
  when the trail gets rough
i ve got my pal and that s enough  
  join up  join up  
  it s easier than ever
when we do things together  
  join up  join up  
  heels down in the saddle
with my very best friend  
  nothing beats having someone
you can trust to the end  
  we just listen to each other
and together make it through  
  we join up  join up  
 whistling 
we all heard about that time
that you liberated a monkey from the zoo 
 pru chuckles  the birthday that flooded 
 abigail  or the time you  accidentally 
locked the math tutor in the closet
and couldn t get him out 
  i did get in trouble for that one 
   both laugh 
he really talks about me that much 
sometimes my dad pretends
he has to go to the bathroom
just to get your dad
to stop talking about you 
   moose bellows 
  see 
i told you there was a moose waiting 
 pru  here it is  we cross this bridge
and then it s a straight shot
up the mountain to the water depot 
 lucky 
is it supposed to move that much 
 pru  it s fine 
suspension bridges are built
to support incredible weights 
   abigail  gulp 
   lucky  oh   chuckles nervously 
 abigail  echoing  now what 
now i decide not to die
falling into a canyon 
but instead go home and have
my dad kill me for even attempting this 
  and just give up 
   sighs 
i m sorry  lucky  we tried  we really did 
but we don t have a choice 
no  give me a minute 
i ll figure out a different way 
   abigail  take your time 
  what 
  what 
  boomerang and i ll just wait over here 
  what  how did she

the great pru granger
can t handle a little jump

a better view of where we are 
 pru  that was the scariest thing
i have ever seen 
 abigail

uh  i m guessing this is
the ridge of regret   
 echoing 
 abigail  i regret it already
