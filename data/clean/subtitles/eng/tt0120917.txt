for someone of your age   
adjusting to life
in the private sector 
hey  kronk  can you
top me off  pal  be a friend 
  now  about you finding new work 
that s that s gonna be tough 
  hit him on the head 
  more broccoli

spring chicken  and i mean that
in the best possible way 
what  a llama 
he s supposed to be dead 
yeah  weird 
let me see that vial 
this isn t poison 
this is extract of llama 
you know  in my defense 
your poisons all look alike 
you might think about
relabeling some of them 
take him out of town
and finish the job now 
  what about dinner 
  kronk  this is kind of important 
  how about dessert 
  well  i suppose there s time
for dessert

takes care of my problem 
scary jungle  right 
oh  a leaf 
oh  it might attack me 
oh  it s a scary tree 
i m afraid 
please  never find my way 
i m the emperor  and as such   
i m born with an innate
sense of direction 
okay  where am i 
help me 
help me  help me 
  too late 
  okay  that was the freakiest thing
i ve ever seen 
what do you want 
oh  for me 
why  i don t know what to say 
  ow 
  hit the road  bucky 
ow  huh  huh 
huh  uh oh 
no  no 
no  no  no  no 
no  no  no  don t 
ha 
no 
you killer jaguars   
whoa 
don t worry  your highness 
i got ya  you re safe now 
maybe i m just new to this whole
rescuing thing  but this  to me   
might be considered kind of
a step backwards  wouldn t you say 
no  no  no  it s it s okay  this this
is all right  we can figure this out 
  i hate you 
  no 
ow  ow 
ow  ow 
i don t know about you 
but i m getting all funned out 
  uh oh 
  don t tell me 
  we re about to go over
a huge waterfall 
  yep 
  sharp rocks at the bottom 
  most likely 
bring it on 
your highness 
your highness  can you hear me 
oh  boy 
come on  breathe 
breathe 
oh  why me 
all right 
for the last time 
it was not a kiss 
well  whatever you call it 
it was disgusting 
and if you would ve done what i ordered
you to do in the first place   
we all could ve been spared
your little kiss of life 
but now that you re here 
you will take me back to the palace 
i ll have yzma change me back  and then
i ll start construction on kuzcotopia 
  oh  yeah 
  okay  now look   
i think we got off
on the wrong foot here 
i just think if you really
thought about it   
you d decide to build your home
on a different hilltop 
and why would i do that 
because   
deep down  i think you ll realize
that you re forcing an entire village   
out of their homes
just for you 
and that s bad 
well  yeah 
uh  nobody s that heartless 
  now take me back 
  what  wait  wait 
how can you be this way 
all you care about
is building your summer home and
filling it with stuff for you 
uh  yeah  doy  me 
everyone else in the kingdom gets it 
you re the only one that doesn t seem
to be with the program  eh  pacha 
you know what  someday 
you re gonna wind up all alone   
and you ll have no one
to blame but yourself 
thanks for that  i ll log that away 
now  for the final time   
i order you to take me
back to the palace 
looks to me like
you re stuck out here   
because unless you change your mind 
i m not taking you back 
because unless you change your mind 
i m not taking you back 
me  me  me 
huh  what 
i didn t do anything  i didn t   
somebody s throwing stuff  you gonna
build a fire or what  what s going on 
he s never gonna
change his mind 
how am i ever gonna
get out of here 
and so  it is with
great sadness   
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince   
taken from us so tragically   
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday 
  poor little guy 
  his legacy will live on
in our hearts   
  he never had a chance 
  for all eternity 
well  he ain t gettin  any deader 
back to work 
kronk  darlin  
i must admit you had me worried   
when you mixed up those poisons 
but now that kuzco is dead 
all is forgiven 
ah  oh  yeah  yeah 
he s    he s dead  all right 
i mean  you can t get much deader
than he    than he is right now 
unless  of course 
we killed him again 
i suppose 
  hey  look  the royal dresser s here 
  kronk 
  i should tell you right now
i m kind of hard to fit 
  kronk 
i wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist 
kuzco is dead  right 
tell me kuzco s dead 
i need to hear these words 
  do you need to hear
all those words exactly 
  he s still alive 
well  he s not as dead
as we would ve hoped 
  kronk 
  i just thought i d give you the
heads up in case kuzco ever came back 
  he can t come back 
  yeah  that would be kind of awkward   
especially after
that lovely eulogy 
you think  you and i
are going out to find him 
if he talks  we are through 
now let s move 
tipo  what is it 
i had a dream that dad was tied to a log
and was careening out of control   
down a raging river of death 
  all right  all right  it s okay  shh 
  it was awful 
it s okay  it s okay  tipo  calm down 
it was just a dream  your dad s fine 
he just went back
to see the emperor 
oh  like you told him to 
 cause you re always right 
that s right  well  in my dream 
dad had to kiss a llama 
yeah  like that
would ever happen 
  it could 
  nuh uh 
  yeah huh

and maybe i might  you know  l i might

  and you re all right with that 
yes

don t shake unless you mean it 
all right 
let s get you
back to the palace 
oh  by the way  thanks 
no  thank you

  you re gonna leave me here 
well  i was gonna have
you imprisoned for life 
but i kind of like this better 
i thought you were
a changed man 
oh  come on  i had to say something
to get you to take me back to the city 
  so all of it was a lie 
  well  yeah  no  wait 
uh  yeah  yeah 
it all was a lie  toodles

this poor little guy

okay  so i ll admit
this was a good idea 
when will you learn that
all my ideas are good ones 
that s funny  because i thought that
you going into the jungle by yourself   
being chased by jaguars  lying to me
to take you back to the palace
were all really bad ideas 
oh  yeah  anything sounds bad
when you say it with that attitude 
hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple

 just leave me alone 
the peasant at the diner 
he didn t pay his check 
he s the peasant who i saw leaving
the city who disappeared into the crowd
with kuzco on the back of his cart 
he must have taken him back to his
village  so if we find the village 
we find him   
and if we find him  we find kuzco 
oh  yeah 
it s all comin  together 
  yzma 
  what 
this had better be good 
so there we were standing on the cliff 
and the ground started to rumble 
and just as it started to go 
he grabbed me before i fell 
do you believe that 
you know  call me crazy for following
this guy all the way out here   
but as much as he tries to deny it 
i know there s some good in him 
besides  i couldn t just
leave him out here all alone 
he s a lousy llama 
i mean 
a really lousy llama 
hey  listen  pacha  you know

   you owe me a new acorn  
  squeak  squeak  squeak 
squeak  squeaker   
  squeakin  
  i m so proud of you guys 
in the quiet time of evening
when the stars assume their patterns
and the day has made his journey
and we wondered just what happened
to the life we knew
before the world changed
when not a thing i had
was true
but you were kind to me
and you reminded me
that the world
is not my playground
there are other things that matter
and what is simple needs protecting
or my illusions all would shatter
but you stayed
in my corner
the only world i know
was upside down
and now the world and me
we know you carry me
you see the patterns
in the big sky
those constellations look
like you and i
just like the patterns
in the big sky
we could be lost
we could refuse to try
but we made it through
in the dark night
who would those lucky guys
turn out to be
but that unusual blend
of my funny friend and me
i m not as clever as i thought i was
i m not the boy
i used to be because
you show me somethin  different
you show me somethin  pure
i always seemed so certain
but i was really never sure
but you stayed
and you called my name
when others would have walked out
on a lousy game
and look who made it through
but your funny friend and me
  you see the patterns in the big sky
  yeah  yeah  yeah
those constellations look
like you and i
that tiny planet
and the bigger guy
i don t know whether
i should laugh or cry
 just like the patterns in the big sky
  we ll be together
we ll be together
till the end this time
you don t know
you don t know
 don t know the answer or the reason why
 we ll stick together
we ll stick together
till the day we die
if i had to do this all
a second time
