no time to waste lets go
hey tiny i want to get out of this
body wouldnt you now lets go
build your summerhouse
somewhere else
you wanna run that
by me again
i cant let you go back
unless you change your mind
and build your summer home
somewhere else
i got a little secret for you
come here no closer
i dont make deals
with peasants
then i guess i cant
take you back
fine i dont need you
i can find my own way back
i wouldnt recommend it its a little
dangerous if you dont know the way
nice try pal
no really im telling you
there are jaguars and snakes
and quicksand
im not listening
im not kidding
listen you cannot go in there
ow still not listening
aw you
fine fine go ahead
if theres no kuzco
theres no kuzcotopia
takes care of my problem
scary jungle right
oh a leaf
oh it might attack me
oh its a scary tree
im afraid
please never find my way
im the emperor and as such
im born with an innate
sense of direction
okay where am i
help me
help me help me
too late
okay that was the freakiest thing
ive ever seen
what do you want
oh for me
why i dont know what to say
ow
hit the road bucky
ow huh huh
huh uhoh
no no
no no no no
no no no dont
ha
no
you killer jaguars
whoa
dont worry your highness
i got ya youre safe now
maybe im just new to this whole
rescuing thing but this to me
might be considered kind of
a step backwards wouldnt you say
no no no itsits okay thisthis
is all right we can figure this out
i hate you
no
ow ow
ow ow
i dont know about you
but im getting all funned out
uhoh
dont tell me
were about to go over
a huge waterfall
yep
sharp rocks at the bottom
most likely
bring it on
your highness
your highness can you hear me
oh boy
come on breathe
breathe
oh why me
all right
for the last time
it was not a kiss
well whatever you call it
it was disgusting
and if you wouldve done what i ordered
you to do in the first place
we all couldve been spared
your little kiss of life
but now that youre here
you will take me back to the palace
ill have yzma change me back and then
ill start construction on kuzcotopia
oh yeah
okay now look
i think we got off
on the wrong foot here
i just think if you really
thought about it
youd decide to build your home
on a different hilltop
and why would i do that
because
deep down i think youll realize
that youre forcing an entire village
out of their homes
just for you
and thats bad
well yeah
uh nobodys that heartless
now take me back
what wait wait
how can you be this way
all you care about
is building your summer home and
filling it with stuff for you
uh yeah doy me
everyone else in the kingdom gets it
youre the only one that doesnt seem
to be with the program eh pacha
you know what someday
youre gonna wind up all alone
and youll have no one
to blame but yourself
thanks for that ill log that away
now for the final time
i order you to take me
back to the palace
looks to me like
youre stuck out here
because unless you change your mind
im not taking you back
because unless you change your mind
im not taking you back
me me me
huh what
i didnt do anything i didnt
somebodys throwing stuff you gonna
build a fire or what whats going on
hes never gonna
change his mind
how am i ever gonna
get out of here
and so it is with
great sadness
that we mourn the sudden departure
of our beloved prince
taken from us so tragically
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday
poor little guy
his legacy will live on
in our hearts
he never had a chance
for all eternity
well he aint gettin any deader
back to work
kronk darlin
i must admit you had me worried
when you mixed up those poisons
but now that kuzco is dead
all is forgiven
ah oh yeah yeah
hes hes dead all right
i mean you cant get much deader
than he than he is right now
unless of course
we killed him again
i suppose
hey look the royal dressers here
kronk
i should tell you right now
im kind of hard to fit
kronk
i wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist
kuzco is dead right
tell me kuzcos dead
i need to hear these words
do you need to hear
all those words exactly
hes still alive
well hes not as dead
as we wouldve hoped
kronk
i just thought id give you the
headsup in case kuzco ever came back
he cant come back
yeah that would be kind of awkward
especially after
that lovely eulogy
you think you and i
are going out to find him
if he talks we are through
now lets move
tipo what is it
i had a dream that dad was tied to a log
and was careening out of control
down a raging river of death
all right all right its okay shh
it was awful
its okay its okay tipo calm down
it was just a dream your dads fine
he just went back
to see the emperor
oh like you told him to
cause youre always right
thats right well in my dream
dad had to kiss a llama
yeah like that
would ever happen
it could
nuhuh

squeak squeak squeak

squeakin
im so proud of you guys
in the quiet time of evening
when the stars assume their patterns
and the day has made his journey
and we wondered just what happened
to the life we knew
before the world changed
when not a thing i had
was true
but you were kind to me
and you reminded me
that the world
is not my playground
there are other things that matter
and what is simple needs protecting
or my illusions all would shatter
but you stayed
in my corner
the only world i know
was upsidedown
and now the world and me
we know you carry me
you see the patterns
in the big sky
those constellations look
like you and i
just like the patterns
in the big sky
we could be lost
we could refuse to try
but we made it through
in the dark night
who would those lucky guys
turn out to be
but that unusual blend
of my funny friend and me
im not as clever as i thought i was
im not the boy
i used to be because
you show me somethin different
you show me somethin pure
i always seemed so certain
but i was really never sure
but you stayed
and you called my name
when others would have walked out
on a lousy game
and look who made it through
but your funny friend and me
you see the patterns in the big sky
yeah yeah yeah
those constellations look
like you and i
that tiny planet
and the bigger guy
i dont know whether
i should laugh or cry
just like the patterns in the big sky
well be together
well be together
till the end this time
you dont know
you dont know
dont know the answer or the reason why
well stick together
well stick together
till the day we die
if i had to do this all
a second time
