  matter of the heart  
by bonnie tyler
  you feel defeated  
  but you re acting proud  
  would you try to hide   
  she doesn t care
how you re comin  on  
  you know all that matters  
  is that your love is strong  
  it s a matter of the heart  
  it s a matter of the soul  
  you know a good love
only starts  
  when you start
to lose control  
  if she s calling out
your name  
  and she needs you
in the night  
  you gotta run
into the flames  
it s been a while 
  nice 
  i think so  too 
  you ve got to take her in your
arms  and let her know  
look  jake  if packard
knew i was here with you   
i mean  people are afraid
of him for a reason 
people are afraid because
guys like packard
prey on fear and weakness 
well  i just think he s crazy 
  all the tales you told  
  ready to believe  
try and be brave
against packard 
and he might kill you 
or he might let you go 
courage isn t easy to come by 
those goons with him
all the time 
they re just scared 
so am i 
keri  listen 
there s gonna come a time
when you ll have
to take a stand 
that s when you ll
free yourself of him 
no sooner
