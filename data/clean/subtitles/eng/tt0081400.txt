think found answernow dirk
go
new projections based theory reported positions slightly important
failed take account smoke stuck
cracked titanic went dwn
built scale model titanic perfectly weighted balanced exact propation
two hundred experiments ranged road one tenth degree
landed exactly submarsbles looking
without smoke chimney hit completely different position
four hundred times repeated process
every time landed within inch spot
every single time
read titanic almost miles south east lies
miles got move entire salvage operation new location
thats got easy change cant leave fog miles ocean
know titanic could dead center area passing
well find work way back
find back better take gamble
cant worse
know im right new position im sure
hope
couple weeks water submarsble crew come hunting spear
looks like passed something metalic metal detector gives signal

titanic sank ice rip huge hole hull
suppose float hole still
well cant going pack special metal plates
maker point
goinng fill lower compartment synthetic foam
pump hoses placed position submarsble cruise
foam goes water hole forced
giving us thousand tons lift
foam bring titanic surface
going need additional lift supplied tanks
filled hydrogen gas high pressure anchored ttitanics hull
explosives charges placed sea bottom around hull theyre detonated
hull released loose bottom suction
titanic comes surface
raise hold another press conference
thank much
sure cant tell us something mineral byzanium
mean fit whole operation
argument give informationn
people says powerful plutonium true
