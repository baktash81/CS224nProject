the president is right  they need to be told 
  we go public on this thing what did 
nobody is talking about going public 
  it is secret or not secret 
you can trust these people 
  i don t trust any body 
this russian thing its paper whole
project blow sky high 
let us worry about that
when it happens 
jesus  i can t believe it happens 
let me get this straight 
you re saying there s an american on the island of svardlov 
and you can not locate it 
and where the hell this svardlov 
  there s a small island near the arctic circle 
well every country has done an exploration 
there claim for its own 
the russians even put their troops 
time to time
and now you re telling us  you ve lost this man
and you may ve lost them to some russians 
telling you we have a diviation
with plan 
a man is four days over due
at the pickup point 
why don t you let us handle it 
we do that kind of stuff all the time 
man had to be a mining engineer 
  so why re  you telling us now 
because if there is an incident
we ll need all the help we can get 
gentlemen  if you follow me   how the hell
that we get ourself into a crap like this 
i ve engineer this thing
and i will take the blame 
what is this project  jim 
  the sicilian project 
we believe it could be
the ultimate defense system 
i know you all familiar with laser technology 
that s what we involved with  
each one of those lights is a power station 
each station  when activated    
will project a beam
from ground to infinity 
these beams finally connect make
an invisible screen  like a wall 
no missile can penetrate it 
  is this theory you talking about  or does it work 
yes it works 
there is only one problem 
in order to install the system to make it function
we need a self contain power source a large one 
the success of our project is depends upon our
locating a specific mineral  byzanium 
byzanium 
i never never heard of it 
i surprises very few people have it 
  and you think there may be some one svardlov is that it 
that s all we think 
  so we sent a man in 
hope you get him out 
because if you don t  if the russians pick him up   
we re  going to be scraping on kremlin next for five years 
washington central  this is unit 23
requesting toll service at jefferson memorial 
the sicilian project 
  yes  captain that s what kgb calls it 
would you read me that report again 
please 
americans interested in rare minerals 
may be related to military operations 
code name  the sicilian project 
  what could be so precious   
that americans risk this kind of adventure 
are you a chess player 
i played it when i was a student why 
do you know isaac boleslavsky 
of course i know him 
he was a great chess master 
may be the greatest of them all 
many of the significant variations in the game
were invented by boleslavsky    
and one of them
was called the sicilian defense 
all right   marganin  lets leave it for now 
we talk again tomorrow  
you know  there wasn t for dirk pitt we were be back at square one
and that mining engineer
who streached out dead on a russian island 
  who is dirk pitt 
all of suddenly he s involved  in the sicilian project
not never heard of him 
used to be a navy man 
after his service he took early retirement
and since then he and i have tackle quiet a few things together 
he works for you 
  well sometimes he does  sometimes not 
depends on the job 
looks like something that can t be done 
chances are take a crack at it  
otherwise dump down 
you mean he only works when he feels like it 
yes it right 
pardon my expression at him
but it sounds like pain in the ass 
welcome home 
good to see you 
bring a stretcher 
where are you going 
see the man you brought in 
  later 
how is he 
  lousy  he got a hole in him that big 
we have patched him up before we left norway  but he
has lost lot of blood and was fainted flat 
he still talk can he 
i have to ask him some questions 
may be you didn t understood me 
we ve  to get this guy to the hospital as fast as we can 
come on  gene  we go 
the mine had been empty he said  but he was sure
byzanium there once 
they took out five hundred pounds 
maybe half a ton that stuff 
that means russians got it 
no  he said mine was worked by americans 
he found tools
and equipments that was shipped from colorado    
and a copy of
rocky mountain news with a date of 1911 
1911 
  and he found a corpse frozen stiff 
someone had the burned his name into on wood
and left it with the body 
this is sergeant jake hobart 
united states army    
frozen in a storm 
february 10  1912 
are you telling me the army sent a guy up there  seventy years ago
to get a half a ton of byzanium 
i am not telling you anything  i am just repeating
which koplin told me 
what happened to you 
gave up only three hours ago 
i was stopped  sorry 
the expression on your face like 
it look like somebody has stole your candy 
i wish i could tell you 
just give me the head lines 
you got the names and places 
can i even do that 
i thought you were a nice 
a scholar and a scientist    
home at six  pipe and slippers 
now you suddenly turned into charlie chan 
this is not funny 
who said it was funny 
i said that it was funny 
there is just solid five years of work
they toilet flushed 
have you ever heard
from someone named dirk pitt 
who 
  dirk pitt 
ring a bell 
no i don t think so 
why do you ask 
oh its just a name 
its not important 
well there is little life
in that old guy after all 
you got to put the worm on the hook 
no i can t do that part
  what kind of a fisher person are you 
i m a dynamite fisher person 
i just can t put the worm in the hooky 
very funny 
i have got a bad conscience 
i told a lie 
  what about 
about dirk pitt 
i do know him 
i met him when i first came to washington 
he was with the navl intelligence there 
why didn t you tell me  you do not know 
  i do not know 
i guess you took me by surprise 
i havn t heard his name for long time 
you date with him 
  no  nothing like that 
now  he was too high for me 
what does that mean 
  just that   he takes up all the air in a room 
dirk pitt what kind of a name is that 
sounds like a pirate 
dr seagram 
are you dr seagram 
i must bring you back to washington 
admiral sandecker orders  
i don t believe it 
you got to be kidding 
how did he know we were here 
  i told him 
brilliant  we ll bring him with us next time 
the hobart file  mention the name brewster 
arthur brewster    
a con man and a minning expert 
in 1910 he discovered byzanium on the island of svardlov
and he took at right to the u s army 
even then he saw it might have
military possibilities 
so they gave him some money and some army engineers
to help   
and he hired a norwegian whaler 
the ship delievers brewster  jake hobart
and rest of the colorado minners to the island 
makes a date to pick him up after
they have mined the byzanium 
what happened 
  the ship picked them up on schadule 
the only problem was two days out of sailing
they spot a russian cruiser tailing them 
but brewster sticks to his plan
and the whaler drops him off    
on the coast of scotland   north of aberdeen
and they started by land 
plan was to get the ore to southampton
and send it home by commercial ship 
did they make it 
they gave them pretty good shots 
but the russian agents comming on their heels 
they fought the running gun battle all the way
from aberdeen to southampton 
some how  brewster made it
and he have the ore with him  
what happened to the other men 
  all dead  except one    
a man named southby 
matter of fact the final report brewster
sent home to the u s army  was only    
thank god for southby 
  then what 
he put the ore in a vault
and he saw how it was loaded into the ship 
and on april 10th  1912 the ship sailed 
southampton to new york 
right 
brewster started home on the titanic 
so that s where we are 
spent five years on research
and development    
we come from bad to worse 
we need 200 ounces of minerals
we can t find    
and if we do find
where is it 
its at the bottom of the atlantic ocean 
but atleast we know where it is now its now just some  place
its in one spot waiting for us to come and get 
you re talking about 12 500 feet under water 
more than two miles down 
we can t get divers down that deep 
that s right sir  we can t get the divers
down to the titanic 
which leaves us with only one choice 
  and what s that 
we don t go to the mountain 
the mountain comes to us 
are you talking about raising the titanic  
yeah 
can it be done 
the ship that big  down that deep 
its never done before  no question about that 
but we did raise that nuclear submarine
a couple of year ago 
that was not nearly as large
and was third on the depth 
admiral  i am not saying
that s gotta be easy 
the chance of success is low and the cost
will be high  but it is not impossible 
if we get full cooperation from the navy 
what if you did have navy cooperation
and you get the funding 
we would have a chance 
lots of  problems and lots of risks 
we have submarsibles that can go down that deep
but we do not know for how long 
we ve other in developing
they can go even deeper 
but they have not been tested
so every trip would be a gamble 
but if we re lucky    
we could make nuclear warfare obsolete 
what about a  jim 
  it would be a stunner 
the biggest marine salvage operation
any body s heard of 
dirk says he can handle it
i am willing to go to the president
do my best to push him through 
seems we are back to you  captain pitt 
well like jim said    
it is the biggest job with the highest stakes
anybody ever dreamed of 
how can you turn it down 
have any time for an old friend 
i don t believable this 
my god  where did you from 
  i don t know 
well as you can see  nothing surprises me  i am    
perfectly calm and under control 
come on  lets go have a cup of coffee 
  i can not  i m late    
i ve dropping somebody of 
he is not good enough for you 
you never thought anybody was good enough for me 
including for yourself 
i was right 
you look treffic 
  thank you 
so to you  i thought you had left washington
so what do you do 
fooling around 
  don t give me that  you were gotta fix the world 
yes  but it was five years ago 
i discovered that they had me out numbered 
not you  i don t believe that 
  you can believe it 
well i got to go 
it s good to see you 
goodbye 
  take care 
funny  you don t look like a scientist 
how a scientist suppose to look like 
i don t know  but when i would see you walking on the street 
i think you    
a country club tennis player 
i never take you for a scientist 
well that makes us even 
i wouldn t take you for a pirate 
here he comes
that did not take long 
it never takes long to say no 
now it does not takes long to say yes either 
  yeah  we ll see 
good afternoon  admiral 
we re in buisness 
good to see you again  how are you doin 
  good 
don t try to hide behind that beard    
i know you any place
  it just keeping me warm 
they warned me you re
the boss of this operation    
as he told you what we after this time 
i don t know no idea  silent sam  
that s allright  i like that 
i get us there 
i ll keep the coffee hot
and you two can handle the tricky stuff 
what makes you think there gone be some tricky stuff 
  it has to be 
nobody hires you for your good looks 
sorry  this is dr seagram 
captain joe burke and chief walker 
good to meet you 
what s operation here 
  yes  we got some nice toys 
i was thinking  i may be able to speed things up by feeding
all navy navigational and meteorological data    
in my computer database 
  i know that sounds very interesting 
good  you can reach me through out
admiral sandecker at the office 
fine  now if you ll excuse me 
i have got three days work to do before lunch 
bye  dirk 
see you later  take it easy 
let us first set some things right 
this is captain burke s operation    
he is an extremly competent navy officer
and i don t think he needs your help 
as for me  i took this job
on two conditions 
one  that i handle a salvage end of it my way 
and two  that you stay out of my way 
will you remember that 
  if you re trying to make me  so appear  it won t work 
this project is too important 
  good  let s keep that in mind
the royal mail ship titanic 
where is she now and how do we
get her up  that is our problem 
this was her course  that orange line 
a southwest track from southampton
to her final radio position  
latitude at 41 degrees 46 minutes north  longitude 50 degrees
15 minutes west that s where she sank 
did the two rescue ships
report conflicting positions 
that s right 
you can see more clearly 
here in this inlargement 
the titanic thought she was here 
carpathia had her here and mount temple here 
so this will be our starting point right 
in the middle of this triangle 
so one way or another we are in the nball park 
the trouble is sir could winned up being a demn
big ball park  
we re talking about miles under water 
maybe more 
everything at that depth  is a mystery 
that how could a wound up couple of miles
from where she disappeared 
or ten 
  let s hope not 
dr  silverstein group will be handling
  the location problems 
our submarsables will work in concentric
circles around that point  as targeted 
let me emphasize again the importance
of  security 
only those who need to know
have been briefed of this operation 
you will be operating under the direct control of the cno here 
through cinclant fleet 
any further questions  admiral 
all right  thank you very much 
gentlemen  that s all 
we got all the stuff from the white star line 
engineering drawings and a complete stuctural design for the titanic 
good  how about a crew list yes we got that too
  and i think may be we lucked out  
one of the survivors is a man named bigalow 
he was junior third officer in charge of cargo
and he is living in england  some place in cornwall 
its an odd thing you know  i had a few ships
shot out under me  more than my share 
three in the war of 1914 1918
and two in 1939 1945    
but all any body ever asked 
me about the titanic 
and now i am doing the same thing 
  and you re lucky you came to the right man 
as i said  it was cargo hold number nine 
d deck on port side 
you sure of that location 
  no question about it 
we all saw that vault  when it was loaded on board 
and we saw the passenger who owned it 
not lightly to forget him   
a bushy beard and eyes like a fox 
even if he had got a gun at me the
way he did  i would remember him 
the gun buisness  you said  that happened
when the titanic was already goin down 
lifeboats in the water 
only half filled    
people scrambling all over 
it was pitiful 
i was on my way up to the boat deck
to give a hand    
when this crazy little fellow
shoved a gun in my face 
wanted to go to cargo hold number nine    
and if i wouldn t take him 
he shoot me in my tracks 
that s what he said 
well i was a young fellow than   
wanted to live as long as i could 
so i took him 
when turned down number nine was the only hold
not already flooded 
once he got in there spoted what he was looking for 
he was happy 
when i have nightmares about that lovely ship
going down i always see that crazy old man with the gun 
that was the last time you saw him 
there in the hold 
that s right he wouldn t leave 
he went up to that vault of his  a huge thing    
8 foot square  and that he did as if he was the dog 
muttering to himself 
you remember what he said 
  same thing over and over 
thanks to god for    
southby  thank god for southby 
its must be a pretty quiet life for a man like you
god help a man who can t live by himself 
we all end up in a single way 
sooner or later 
there he is  the owner himself 
i had already missed you 
what do you want a whiskey or a nice point of bitter 
  just a moment  sarah 
this is sarah martin dale   a women of substance 
a beauty and a worm heart 
and this is captain pitt 
of the united states navy 
retired  like myself 
retired might early   if i may say so 
keep your hands off him sarah
and give us two large pink gin 
full measure and don t skim 
sarah talk big    
fact is she is frightened silly of men 
those of us who know her best 
suspect she still a maiden 
my god  the man s got off 
come along to the rear 
this is my titanic collection 
all its left 
in memories 
what a lovely thing she was
standing as high in the water 
is one of your skyscrapers 
longer than two football fields    
and furnishing to mach the finest mentions
in england 
she was one of her kind 
no question about it    
and god himself  they said 
couldn t sink her 
then in two hours she was gone   
and fifteen hundred souls with her 
i took the flag of her before she was gone 
if you manage to bring her up again    
may be you put it back 
where it belongs 
control  this is deep quest at 8000 feet 
searching section 22 
visibility fair  negative contact  out 
this is turtle  depth 9200 feet 
no contact  out 
this is starfish at 10000 feet 
conducting sonar search section 24  no contacts 
depth 
  11420 feet 
6000 pound per square inch 
one of these days the water gonna squash us
like bug 
what are you grumble about  marker 
  there are plenty of reasons to grumble 
hang around down here in this chunk canned
looking for what 
we re looking for what ever is down here
guys  i just spoil your fun 
we re going up  pitt s comming in 
oh good  maybe he found
what he was looking for 
marine air base one to three 
three marine 
wind direction 220 degrees with 18 knots 
roger  220 to 18 knots 
helo three you re cleared
any thing happened down there 
  no  nothing yet 
which brings up a point  i think
the sub crew should be told what they re looking for  
helps moral 
  it sounds like a good idea 
why don t we hold a briefing this afternoon 
  we have a visitor  did you notice 
yeah  i spotted a the russian flag as we comming in 
  looks like a marine research vessel 
i means its only may be got a half of dozen gun cruise
men on board 
they re just nosing around 
they don t know not what we are looking for 
  not yet  anyway 
deep quest  this is star fish 
have sonar contact in section 26 at depth 12700 feet 
request permission to investigate 
this is deep quest  negative 
maintain present depth 
you are only certified to 12000 feet 
we will checked it out 
here turtle  3470 meter depth 
section 23 searched without contact 
starfish  this is deep quest  request you conduct sonar
search section 33 at maximum depth of 12000 feet 
this is starfish  roger  out 
this is starfish  approaching 12000 feet 
contiinuing sonar search over 
this is control do not exceed 12000 feet depth limit   out 
lieutenant 
control  this is star fish 
bridge control 
  this bridge 
star fish reprts she is flooding 
we re trying to get more information 
release the batteries pass 
  batteries pass away 
control  this is star fish  we fill up 
we try to surface 
i repeat  this is starfish  we flooding 
we try to surface 
we are broken 
starfish  this is control  
we lost contact 
where is turtle 
in a water 11000 feet  heading
through the starfish position 
this is turtle 
we have starfish visual contact 
she is going down fast 
they got to lose the weight 
we have taken too much of water 
  press the panic switch  release the ball 
release the ball  
  that i try 
control  star fish is just imploded 
request permission to surface 
yes  klink 
come on up 
doctor silverstein and i have
reviewed the data 
oh bullshit  i ve heard that story a dozen times 
while you were busy here screwing around with your computers
we been out there for five weeks we had found nothing 
meanwhile  i just lost three men 
i think they found the answer now dirk 
go on 
the new projections based on a theory that all the
reported positions were slightly off  and most important
we failed to take into account that smoke stuck
cracked  it off the titanic went dwn 
we built a scale model of the titanic 
perfectly weighted and balanced in exact propation 
in two hundred experiments ranged road
down no more than one tenth of a degree    
and it landed exactly
where your submarsbles have been looking 
then we did it without smoke chimney
we hit a completely different position 
four hundred times we repeated this process    
and every time it landed within inch
same spot  
every single time 
this we read of the titanic
almost 10 miles south east lies 
10 miles 
  we got to move the entire salvage operation to this new location 
that s  not got be too easy change 
can t leave fog over 10 miles of ocean 
for all we know the titanic could be dead center
in area we by passing
if it is  we ll find it
if we work way back   
find it as we are back    
  we better take the  gamble 
we can t do any worse than we re doing 
i know i m right
about this new position  i m sure of it 
i hope so 
not a couple of weeks under water and the
submarsble crew will come after you with a hunting spear 
looks like we passed something metalic 
the metal detector gives a signal 
ok stay on itl 
give us a fix 
there  just below us 
  roger  now we hoover here 
stay on the magnetometer 
report if you see anything 
wait a minute 
  what  have you saw something 
yes i think so  but its got three o clock 
see that funny shape there 
it is clamped between two rocks 
ok stand by   we will use the mechanical arm 
here we come 
got it 
what it is 
looks like some kind of horn 
may i  doctor bird 
  yes  certainly 
please 
presented the graham farley
by the grateful management of the white star line 
now the white star did some checking through
their records and it turns out that graham farley    
was the  musician for three years on a ship 
called olympic  then he was transferred 
graham farley was cornet player in the titanic s
orchestra 
are you sure 
  no question  its all documented 
that means we re looking in the right place 
atleast we re getting close 
it also means that the titanic
must be in excellent condition 
wait a minute  don t break
out the champagne yet 
we step in the right direction 
but we re not looking for cornets    
that s we re looking for a ship 900 feet long
we still can t find it 
where the hell is she 
she disappear 
very disturbing 
are all these sources totally reliable 
  absolutely 
is such a defense system possible 
put that question to our
military scientists in moscow 
they say it is feasible but it would
take very strong power source 
and you say that power source
locked in a cargo hold of the titanic 
all signs points to it 
i believe it 
bridge  radio 
  bridge i  we hear 
captain  we picking up interference on the vhf 
roger  you take me on 
yes sir
there s not much pattern to it sounds like
static  it is only on 1 frequency 
keep on it 
call me back when it stops 
what the hell is all about 
  picking up some kind of a strange inteferance at night 
carpentar hear it too 
but not as clearly as we do 
they all crazy on seacliff 
they have found something 
i ve no idea  but the
big bounce in sonar
seacliff  its pitt  what s up 
this is seacliff  i think we re smelling something 
running through the metal detector 
good  stay out there 
we are coming over 
seacliff  this is deep quest 
we having in sight at 9 o clock 
this is seacliff  roger you have
sonar contact with the target 
roger  come in strong and getting stronger 
there it is 
straight ahead 
bohannon  can you identify 
no idea what it is 
there are about ten layers of marine animals 
it is a smoke stack chimney  
  cool 
bulls eye 
looks like seagram was right for once 
control  this is deep quest 
we have just spoted a smoke stack
chimney 
mark our position 
this is control  roger 
position marked  out 
what do you think 
  i think may be we got a get lucky 
seacliff  anything over there 
  negative 
keep your eyes open 
lets stance this 
what gives to the metal detector 
  nothing ahead 
wait a minute  what the hell is that 
its a straight drop to nowhere 
control  this is deep quest 
the ocean floor just disappeared 
we re going down until we find it again 
you gentlemen think what i am thinking 
she is down in this hole   no wonder
we couldn t find her 
we got something 
deep quest  this is seacliff 
  look at that 
we getting strong signals on all equipment 
  roger  so do we 
slowly this way 
the metal detector ripped of its tack 
deep quest  this is a seacliff  i
think we re on something  right ahead 
roger  you sure on 
hold on 
i think we hit the jackpot 
holly christ    
are you absolutely certain 
no question  a direct report
to our ship standing by there 
all right  here is what we do 
see that the press gets the story 
only one paper    
and make sure that admiral sandecker s name
is prominent in the list of facts 
just the story titanic  
no  the byzanium too 
let s see what kind of explanation
they come up with yes sir 
this story from today s washington star 
the titanic  which sank on her maiden voyage
on april 14  1912  has been found    
over 2 miles down at the
bottom of atlantic 
no official announcements yet 
but one thing is certain    
the imaginations of
millions of people will be stimulated 
in world history
there is only one titanic    
rumors say that the navy
plans to raise her 
why would they doing this
we do not know    
but we understand that a defense plan 
called the sicilian project    
and a little known mineral 
powerful than uranium    
with the unusual name byzanium 
this is sandor vanocur  in washington 
of course i wrote that story 
why shouldn t i 
the information came in and i wrote it up 
that s my job 
what about my job 
it s look like i gave you that information 
everybody will think that 
  who cares what anybody thinks 
you know you didn t tell me anything
and so do i 
i didn t even connnected with you 
i still do not know what you up to 
you trying to tell me  that the story
just flew inside the window 
no  i am not telling you 
that i have lots of sources 
that s what i mean  who told you 
   i can t tell  you that i won t tell you that
you have to  its crictical if there is a leak 
we have to stop 
what do you mean by a leak 
i do not even know what you re talking about 
the hell you don t  it was a secret 
that s what i am telling you nobody know about  it
hardly anybody know about  it 
it has to be somebody on a  inside who told you 
busby  nicholson 
how about your old friend  pitt 
did he tell you 
so what s its all about 
that s what this is really about  
it about pitt 
oh christ sake    
  it isn t you know it 
you have been looking for an excuse to  unkown
ever since you met him ever since
i don t give a demn about him    probably you
don t  you can t get him out from your head 
what so let us just straight once
and for all 
i lived with him for two years
and i was crazy about him 
that s treffic  its just treffic  if you were so demn
crazy about him why didn t you stay with him 
because i was stupid 
i m sorry 
i m sorry  i didn t mean it 
sir  after all this time
not the titanic completely rusted away to nothing 
we don t think so 
at a depth of more than 2 miles    
there is less oxygen  the water is much colder    
and there re fewer destructive
marine organisms 
she may be surprisingly soundl 
the titanic she sank because the ice rip the
huge hole in her hull 
now how she suppose to float
with the hole still there 
well she can t  so we re going to pack it with
special metal plates   
and maker point   
we re goinng to fill her lower compartment
with synthetic foam 
we pump in through hoses
placed it position by our submarsble cruise 
as the foam goes in  the water
in the hole is forced out     
giving us 22 thousand tons up lift 
will all that foam bring the titanic
to the surface 
no  we going need additional lift now
this will be supplied by these tanks    
filled with hydrogen gas under high pressure 
an anchored to the ttitanic s hull 
then explosives charges will be placed on the
sea bottom around the hull and once they re detonated
the hull will be  released  loose
from the bottom suction 
and the titanic will comes to the surface 
if and when you raise it  then what 
  then  we will hold another press conference 
thank you all very much 
are you sure you can t tell us something
about this mineral  byzanium 
i mean how does it
fit in this whole operation 
no argument i give you all
the informationn i have on that
people says its more powerful than plutonium 
is that true 
i ve no further comment on it 
  what about the sicilian project 
is it really a code name
for a defense system 
or super bomb with biggest warhead yet 
no comments 
  is it true that byzanium could fuel a bomb    
a thousand times more powerful
than bomb of hiroshima 
that s it  gentlemen 
i ve given you everything i can for now 
what do you think of it  vinnie 
  doesn t sound like any code ever heard 
you know the tapes remake
at a much higher intensity    
than the once i ve recorded
and connects with the carpentar 
yes make sure think that the signal 
whatever it is  orignates here on the denver 
demn sure it does 
any word from naval inteligence 
sandecker says we will have
a report by tomorrow 
what s it say about him 
  marker  he s allright 
he has a good record 
he served as a civilian technition in vietnam 
he got captured 
spent two years
in a prisoner camp    
and another one years in japan to get over that 
married to a japanese girl 
yes that what he said  only she was not japanese 
she grew up in nam dinh 
her family still lives in haiphong and her brother
in the north vietnamese army intelligence 
how the hell we missed that one 
its painted over 
we were supposed to miss 
so they finally let you come
down with us 
i thought you d never make it 
  neither did i 
there is no time like the first time 
how do i look to you 
nothing like i expected 
we got to have a problem with that one 
let s take a look 
it hangs from a stack 
we gonna need a help 
try deep quest 
deep quest  this is turtle  we need some help
with this hydrogen tank  its hangs on a stack 
this is deep quest can do 
be right there 
well i let s do it 
make the mechanical arms ready 
this is deep quest  we re hooked up 
  this is turtle you pull  we pushl 
its moving 
it feels like it stuck on something 
deep quest asks for help 
keep the arm still 
son of a bitch 
  they are stuck in that window 
come on  baby 
come on  you pretty little thing 
get some dady out of there 
come on    
iindicates electrical fire
on the left 
battery acid  put your mask on 
we are on to state of entangled 
acid s running out of the batteries 
i was half of power
on the panel 
can we break out these power lanterns 
well  knock off the power 
we re going up 
bohannon  move on over here
and standby deep quest 
roger  we are on our way 
how s look down there 
  not good 
seagram picked a lousy day
to go to sight scene 
he is a scientist  who the hell authorise
him for sumersbile duty 
how bad is it 
  or they got themselves trapped in to that sky like a cork in the bottle 
we are fighting time 
we lost almost all batteries power    
and they are going to be running out of air 
they have about six hours left 
what re choices 
  no choices 
if we can t cut loose that  submarsible    
we have to bring up the titanic 
  six hours  how we do that 
target date two weeks away 
our target date just got changed 
here s all we got to do 
eighty charges  each one containing
a hundred pounds of explosives    
at these key points under the hold 
why re you shaking your head 
shaking my head  i am shaking all over 
those charges are double what we planned 
if anything goes wrong we loose four men  but if
we do not bring him up  we lose him anyway 
they got two chances to die
and one to live 
all right now we re going to detonate
 the starboard charge first 
eight seconds later  first one on the port side 
another eight seconds back to starboard 
we alternate the explosions
all the way to holds    
so we setup rocking motion like you do
with a car stuck in the mud 
would it not be better to put an extra large charge
right on to bow 
then we shake it loose 
  too dangerous 
this way we start the right movement
with less risk to the men 
carbon dioxide rising up 
can we get some more air 
  no we can not 
moving it down to save energy 
the less we talk  the longer we go 
  exactly 
everybody just sit down
and relaxed 
ok  arm it 
control  this is seacliff  explosives secured 
all clear 
  roger 
control  this is turtle  all charges secured 
seacliff  turtle  this is control 
get the hell out of there 
moving out 
this is turtle  estimated arrival area 
13 05  we re leaving the titanic 
start the countdown 
  start the countdown  i i sir 
all stations  t minus 50 
activating hydrogenium generators 
twelve  eleven  ten  nine    
eight  seven six  five    
four  three  two  one 
  start 
heavens  what is it 
  trying to blast us loose 
can they do it 
  they re going to blow hell out of this sub 
it just laying there 
move  you bastard  move 
what the hell is going on 
  late hits last two charges just went off 
something happening 
 something moving down there 
isn t that a beauty 
son of a bitch
it s incredible 
there she is 
but where the hell is deep quest 
the explosives must have her released 
there she is 
we can not did our service 
head covers just as jammed as the others 
i got to need dynamite
to get you out of that mass 
yes  just forget it 
keep the pump running 
we got to wait until we go to new york
 to get the right equipment 
what happens 
where does the carpentar gone 
this  
freighter have a trouble 
we re in trouble 
we need that ship 
we can not ignore this distress call 
  you wanna talk about distress 
we got navy weather forecasting a
force 12 storm the russians are looking down out throats   
we are on a ship never learn
how to do but sink  that s distress 
from the russian ship  they re asking for permission
to send a man over here captain prevlov 
what s that all about 
well they re offering give us a hand
in case the weather gets bad 
permission granted  captain prevlov
come aboard 
admiral  you sure we want to do this 
why not 
we might listen what he got to say 
welcome to the titanic  captain 
our time is precious 
so i ll come straight to the point 
we re offering you the safety of our ship 
my helicopter can carry ten men at a time 
very nice of you  what happens
to the titanic if we accept your offer 
an empty ship on an open seas 
  what is the russian word for piracy 
no  it s not question of piracy 
it is the international law of maraine salvage 
hell with it 
we know about the byzanium 
stolen from a mine on russian territory 
you must trust me  gentlemen  what i tell you that we re 
determined to take back what is morally and legaly ours 
mikhail kurkov is a torpido ship 
if her captain gets no signal from me
eight minutes from now   
he will sink this ship  that we re standing on 
what if do to get byzanium  then what 
it is worthless if you do not    
  a sicilian defense system 
no  its not worthless at all 
if this byzanium will
produce a superior weapon    
then russia must have it to guaranty the security
of our people 
we arm ourselves only    
to protect us 
the clock is keep ticking  gentlemen 
all right  prevlov  i make it fast 
we knew you re comming aboard here today
we knew your plan would be exactly 
this is pitt  bring on a surprise package 
well  i will prove it to you 
like i said 
you do not have much choice  captain 
i see 
gentlemen    
we have him 
no water 
  sealed tight 
watch out 
and here is arthur brewster 
sank with the titanic 
all right lets get those boxes out of there
and get them open up 
just like the others 
debris 
doesn t makes sense 
  a dead man and seven boxes of crap 
arthur brewster s papers 
listen  we know that byzanium existed 
we know that brewster had it 
it must be some place 
we worked sweat come up with nothing 
three men dead whole the sicilian project
in the junk box 
how the hell that we blow this thing 
there must be some kind of answer 
but i could not find what it is 
i am just as disappointed as you re  gene 
i hate to quit on anything  
but sometimes you have no choice 
if it make you feel any better    
i will tell you something i didn t want
to admit even to myself 
if we had found the byzanium 
i am not sure we could hung on to it 
i don t think we could tagged it 
for defensive only  and made it stick 
we got the president s assuare for that 
  yes  right but    
presidents do not stay on office forever
and even if they did circumstances change 
what is that mean 
  i means that    
if the government falls
in the middle east or somewhere    
they start bombing pakistan or some where else   
it effects all of usl 
what this got to do with
the sicilian project 
nothing 
maybe    
i am just saying that somewhere in the world
in some think tank right now   
they re figureing out a way to build a
byzaniumbom bomb 
why  if you knew that   
in god s name why
 did you go along with this whole operation 
because i believed in what we were trying to do 
and if it did not work defensively    
if somebody was going to make a byzanium bomb    
i wanted it to be us 
he thinks just like you do 
i don t understand that kind of thinking 
you are both couple of cynics 
you think its some kind of lousy game 
if i thought the way sandecker does
i wouldn t started the demn project on a first place 
i m glad we didn t find the stuff 
ok 
but i am not got to let you wriggle
 off the hooks so easy 
not now 
take a look at this 
its a postcard 
i saw it 
that s right  a british postcard 
we all saw it 
brewster must bought it stuck it in his suitcase
never mailed it 
take a look at the fine print on the back 
come on  read it 
typical country church and grave yard in county of hampshire
near the village southby 
twenty miles from southampton 
we were wrong 
we thought it was a man 
but it is a place 
thank god for southby 
and this is the one 
 jake hobart 
i will get the shawls 
excuse me 
jackpot 
would you like us to dig him up 
  i do not know 
you will have to ask doctor seagram
that question 
it is your decision  gene 
whether you like it or not 
wouldn t you want us to dig him up 
no 
what s so funny 
i knew a girl once  
  i bet you did 
years later i came back to her 
she says  what has happened to you 
i thought you got to change the world 
what do you said 
  i said they have me out numbered 
is that my lesson for the day 
no more lessons
