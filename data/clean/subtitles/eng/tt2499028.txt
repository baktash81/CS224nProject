referring steep vertical canyons drop offs
thousands technical canyons existed
remained accessible
climbing skill equipment
tunnel goes east entrance zion

old days could stop tunnel
could look canyon
saw amazing things windows

nearly decade
mike written first book
deep canyon zion national park
captured attention young climber
named dennis turville
year canyon dennis planned
descend dropped feet within half mile
hazardous obstacles lurking darkness
pine creek considered tomb

needed full climbing gear wet suit pools
might probably
brought last missing piece
equation climbing buddy dean

sent shivers back
made wan na
every time went first descent
canyon canyon canyon
without anybody around see anywhere
sometimes walked zion narrows afterwards
packs ropes clanking pieces iron
people would look us pretty funny
could see questions forming head
didnt dare ask
good
accessing terrain could follow
dennis explored canyons solitude nearly years
remember pouring minute topos
really look skinny little canyons
ones actual contour crosses creek
names impressions
canyon went
trolls treat felt like bunch
trolls carrying packs canyon
treat fun
felt reason name
climbers name climbing routes
naming canyon routes
whatever felt like
first ones
right
canyons led toward others
getting increasingly difficult
longer harder get harder get
found challenges
found techniques match problems
realized
special thing
intensely enjoyable
rigorous wasnt everybody
work began
fourth edition guidebook

started thinking know
maybe room another type guide
thisll add little flavor
little adventure canyon hike
walking boring canyon

canyoneering ripped obscurity
zion national park witnessed first wave participants
lot local folks known slot canyons
zion number years
advent internet
sudden information
large numbers people
think guidebooks internet appeared
roughly time
coupled together
created firestorm canyoneering interest
called standard mode
want little friction drop
thats called vertaco
textbook way
ive seen students come top way
add friction thats okay
go
ive come
go top
theres kinds different ways thatll work
like somewhat idiot proof
recreationalists arrived
try new sport
young professional guide phoenix arizona
assembled teaching group
called american canyoneering association
people started publishing guidebooks
made huge difference amount traffic
canyons number people got
sudden theyre accessible
felt like canyoneering gon na get enough promotion
wanted
become canyoneer
help become safe
safe efficient solutions right
establishing aca
rich carlson made living bringing clients
climbing mountaineering excursions
outdoor enthusiast throughout life
rich discovered canyoneering late
experiencing solitude sports formative years
one early adventure
rich found precarious situation
well time wasnt thinking
going canyon
something technical
thinking hike
would little bit scrambling
naive oversight year old rich
climbed without considering ability
reverse move
going canyon realizing couldnt go
oh shit moment coming back
assuming would easy go back
came back
point saw two drops
stuck
realized man someone could get killed
ready yeah
finally managed get got back car
thinking stupid
stupid never
okay whos
feel like part job instill respect
great things sport
beauty adventure
also instill risks sport
going canyon easier going mountain
rappel
know rappel
rappelling isnt big deal
thats simplest part canyoneering
canyoneers easily get deeper
doodoo rock climber
rock climber go first
get point cant go higher
partner lowers
canyon start downhill
first rappel pull rope
cant deal whats front
youre screwed
lots lots problems canyons
pools water may may head
mud log jams
need ready whatever might run
canyons teach quite quickly
theyre hard enough
theyre long enough
mean enough
youre
live society stuck
office somewhere behind computer something
people want challenge
gives readers chance enjoy something new
world live
always looking something weekends
currently theres lot people
havent developed outdoors sense
theres lot us raised outdoors
weve got parents like camping
hiking hunting fishing whatever
theres people going
sofa canyon
something goes wrong
cant find thing inside
able deal effectively situation
knew people would get canyons
get trouble
knew coming
inevitable hard
see road gon na happen
us say want adventure
secretly hoping dont find
hmm
well thought would little easier find
said would difficult find dark
still light
say
dirt road going

thats thrill comes
overcome barrier
put
lot fun
little chilly last night

im thinking rain may turned people around
changed minds
steves introduction canyon thrills
gotten shaky start
annual trip
zion national park father stumbled brochure
directions remote canyon
didnt know anything
quite illprepared
come
knew would various places
scramble small waterfalls
point really didnt know
considered canyoneering
tried hard keep everything dry
took length rope could string packs
shuttle across pools
probably looked ridiculous
got cold one period time
take cotton tshirt
put backpack
mean warmer without shirt
despite awkward start
steve father garnered enough interest
devote free time pursuit
newfound hobby
well wasnt pretty
without climbing experience
developing necessary skills
would become lasting endeavor
dont pull hard
knock head
completing canyon
realized needed develop technique
learn little technical aspects
going canyon
knew would want
graduate canyons
okay
realized need get training
okay bring hands behind
okay right lean forward
put hands shoulders
watch rock
okay
lean forward
offering unique curriculum
canyoneering technique safety
richs course filled students eager
try sport
jumps log
runs around back side tree
following success classes
another innovation
stirred fledgling community
one first things aca accomplished
development rating system
first component numeric
goes one two three four
thats related difficulty terrain
rope work involved
class one canyon canyon hike
class two canyon considered
maybe intermediate canyon
got scrambling involved
class three canyons canyons involve rappelling
class four canyon something
lets call advanced
expert canyon
second component alpha character b c
primarily dry canyon
class b canyon one thats got water
basically current
class c canyon canyon
thats got flowing water
aca rating system accepted instantly
standard canyoneering
even mike recognizing significance
included latest guidebook
published tehcnical slot canyon guide
responded growing need adventure
including canyons require rope traverse
canyon listing rating
readers could choose undertaking based
desired level challenge
rope comes rope bag
passes rappel ring
set rope length
people get canyoneering
theyre two kinds information
one kind information technical skills need
another set information need
canyons
part american way things
point right direction ill figure
course feel like technical information
important two
get technical skills
go looking canyons
look good
thing warm
old fashioned way
wax back cut paste
works damn good
dont care
people probably think im funny hell
using old method
fast
computer
cut
thats one size want right
country theres lot cedar mesa
sandstone
lets see one
big enough
right biggest problem space
space store room books
neither books great sellers
years ago
mother rented top part
closed made separate apartment
mess
old office right
everythings filled
typical bachelor guess
lived years
little apartment plus office
got books
kind extra bedroom want
im gon na
forget guest bedroom guess
take bed
stack books
heroic author
author thats use course
great man viciously malign
slimy article mark kelsey
dont know

said hell nobody used go
went past memorial day
one weekends
cars stacked parked
everybody going
slot canyons thats note made outside
slots small
doesnt take much ruin
ive seen lot last years
results sickening
anyway
first attempt edge earth canyon
told everyone tell anybody

really wanted canyon
hadnt descended
maybe first people ever see
wed pretty seriously sure
seeing anybody else
youre talking canyon
called edge earth map
one gon na know youre talking
knew early eventually people going
find fun running canyons
rappelling pools
overcoming challenges
seeing beauty canyons
going become popular
werent gon na hurry along
looks like storm water
knew much
finding online
eventually picking guidebooks
drive want see firsthand
ive seen local canyons much
ive barely touched whats utah
slot canyons nice get
somewhere squeeze get
think thats unlike la
knowing tight canyons get
adds different element excitement
exploring utahs narrowest slot canyons
steves scrambling brought
unknown territory
right woo
thats hard start morning
using opposing walls support
discovered stemming
climbing technique crucial traversing tight canyons
inadvertently steve stumbled
advanced canyon terrain
initially werent far deck
kept moving along
get point may feet
deck
id never done anything like
didnt know getting
im getting little
dont really like
anybody party slip
like going kill
youre certainly gon na get stuck
trapped
wow
getting dropping sand
relief canyon
hair raising
look back go
good kind scary great time
something fathers going
even people circle
canyoneering friends dont think something
would want
knowing got canyon
without much difficulty
youll think canyons
element excitement
check canyons greater difficulty
right foot go ahead move
shelf thats six inches
nope

go
almost okay
switch left hand back
position comfortable
um nope okay
left hand right ledge
right hand ledge
drop maybe foot
half
put left hand
could actually walk okay
youre good
okay
pretty dumb things
young rock climber
see people dumb things
youre right handed
right hand break strand
id rather see leaning rock
sitting brace secure
like kid saying
son ive ive done
dont go stupid things
let help pass conversation
kids dont listen ya
dont expect many people
coming ranks climbing
canyoneering listen either
need learn
tail lets go ahead start
three inches tail
stick finger inside girth hitch
youll happier youre using finger
instead thumb though
okay
take end piece put piece
end piece back
got first
op got ta start
aca teaches set skills
refer tools toolbox
everybody something
generally looks like
starting rip
hard skills heres tie knot
heres rig rope
heres set anchor
soft skills things like common sense judgment
arent easy teach
mentioned classroom morning
thats way always teach
see students panic mode
go like okay
works
heres tools toolbox
hope weve given enough information
point right direction
skills appropriate
kinds situations
person standing
top cliff
making decision knows
main canyons done
everybody knows get
guidebook comes
youre always looking
natural evolution
getting difficult
dangerous
case go back canyon
well know turn
whoa
look
bear tracks
three little toes right
earth getting canyon
everybody wants first man
reach top everest
every person every canyoneer wants
first one make descent
canyon
first slot big drops
think climb
looks like swimmer right
could get walk bench ways
think running room
yeah
well theres trees water
well go back get bench
looks like theres two anchors two maybe
one thing enjoy first
make public put map
enjoy
consider guess small group
people enjoy first go
danger
dont know hells
got tree
anchor
see places build anchor something
looks like business
whoa little steep right
maybe
little bit scary
know two three quick hops
youre
getting little past comfort level
dont like
perfect
whoa
got little tree thats good news
uh dont anchors
think gon na
one big rappel
think get bench walk
thats kind looks like
gon na something
might use little rope
go back rim tree
come
thats im thinking right
oh hell
hell look
first
number canyoneers continued rise
even remote corners wilderness
show evidence visitors
back pine creek days didnt think
would become
thought would eventually become popular
cool
edge earth distinctive pour
call monster pour
image side uhaul van
tell feelings like
day first saw image
used say even
im gon na take canyon
gon na go labor day weekend
gon na see soul five days
would hard time
thats miss
people think canyoneering began
discovered internet
canyoneering wouldnt even possible
without internet
came term people
decided call canyonista
theyre climbers
dont background
get hyped gear
notoriety canyons
especially guidebook says
canyon tough guys
okay guys ready
hey okay
theres reason anyone
break leg rappel
rappel infinitely safe thing
complete idiot
break leg rappel
oh shit matt
holy shit
im rolling whoa whoa
canyoneering lot people come
ideas techniques
one person look theyll say
wow thats really cool technique
people look
say holy crap thats dangerous
canyoneering fun
biggest concern would
somebody else looks video
perception
somebody looks laughs
inside theyre thinking man guy lucky
okay
somebody looking thinking
hold beer let give try
problem
people lot people
going canyons today
thats good rest us
good canyons
good government agencies

people calling quits going home early

rendezvous guided events
theyre opportunity selfreliant canyoneers
get together selfreliant canyoneers
folks really well
people showing
eight oclock departure
tell everybody theyre equally responsible
become cats
nobodys able hurt
guys brings good point
already running late
think lets make decisions
one group
two group
whats plan attack
whos top playing around
pretty much one group
im comfortable move quickly enough
im finish headlamps
done
im confident
playing always challenge
gon na efficient
gon na better efficient
okay lets go
look back
take deep breath heavy sigh
attendees assembled
us
richs arizona rendezvous geared
successful week
couldnt make event
find adventure closer home
woohoohoo yeah
thats hoohoo
going deep
oh beginning amazing
many times could canyon

local hour drive away
ive probably little santa anita
times perhaps
woohoo got woohoo
think tired canyons
yeah definitely wanted graduate
something little bit bigger
bigger rappel different challenges
certainly getting canyons necessary
build anchors
gon na clip onto bolt go
steady regiment
home base canyoneering
steves desire exotic adventures mounting
next trip utah
would settle local terrain
desperate quest thrills
steve primed opportunity
even recognizing chance floodwaters set
landslide canyon
remember last time
bunch boulders needed moved
thats thought would work
favorite rappel section buried
rocks debris
steve sees challenge restore canyon
original condition
think key stone move right
probably weighs pounds
know much fun go channel
walk underneath chalk stone come
pool underneath
movement
little concerned
particularly steve climbed underneath big rock
dislodging large boulders
probably anywhere pound
little exciting little disconcerting
worried
look look go
blows
initially started move beyond
would consider simple canyons
difficult canyons
moved ladder certain level
certain comfort zone
went beyond move areas
comfortable wasnt
explore
really need leave one rung
let people equipped climb
next rung continue
element want move
difficult canyons require skills
think everybody sense adventure
outdoors always wants challenge
feel takes
get actually
exciting find youre made
overcome
hat
comfortable starting
difficult canyons
happy see
long things safely
started bigger nastier canyons
started thinking intellectually
kinds problems could run
get cold
pack selfdestructs
rope cut
things could happen
one end spectrum
things like somebodys tshirt got stuck
rappelling device
life threatening problem
needs addressed way
end spectrum
youve got things like
go canyon
pull rock top arm
boulder smashed left hand
constant fear running bolts
rope chopped rockfall
started inventing ways dealing
problems
climbers used bat hooks long time
simply little cshaped hooks
able engineer way rock
without placing number bolts
simply climbing little holes
would also way climbing canyons
ever got stuck bad weather
injury something else
later years went
number people died
hadnt thoughtful enough
figure questions
hm shutter speed
lets see hold
theres thing
may thats long ago
hike doable experienced hikers
water level low
added considerable difficulty
hmm
easy route back canyon
tough navigate
dark
well scrambling
kidding
allow six eight hours hike
six eight hours
ive never done less five
always five
idea would taken long
lets read
well well year old lady made
help
six eight hours
well year old lady
thats never exercised life
maybe tough
anyway
oh lets see
say
im gon na write thing
theyd spent money
like cccs back
made trails
would last long time
anyway heres sign
well exactly sign
theyre saying descend black hole
thats ridiculous
wellprepared people something
little bit overkill
guess theyre trying save
come rescue people
dont know many times theyve
one girl alpine american fork
somewhere northern utah know
got drowned
big flood
big storm near bridges national monument
friday friday afternoon suppose
came saturday morning
flood came eight oclock recall
caught right worst possible place
could flood
lost one girl teenage girl
thats
theyre afraid people gon na come
illprepared people gon na come
attempt theyll drag
anyway
supposed
five day adventure lifetime
david fleischer kim ellis helped lead group
teenage hikers salt lake city
one zions treacherous narrow canyons
foreboding canyon
kolob creek first explored
dennis friends
couldnt known time
canyon would become setting tragedy
years later
boy scout group attempted descent
first rappel
theyre water normally
one inch two inches deep
swift right
could hardly keep footing
im
right obviously much water
excess water arriving
nearby reservoir
group found canyon unusual form
describe look like
safe
wouldnt hear noise
youd hear nice babbling little brook
little trickle water going
understand okay well
dont go couple little drops
see like maybe leave rope someplace
didnt
went
point time
giving lot thought
made decision maybe aware
conditions gon na face downstream
rappelling turbulent water
group leader david fleischer caught whirlpool
still connected rope
brave hasty effort rescue partner
kim ellis jumped pool
chaos ellis hit head rock wall
disappeared water
decision made right
lets get canyon
try continue turn around
lose second person unnecessary
believing difficult
retreat canyon
rattled fleischer ordered group proceed
less hundred feet ellis vanished
descending another churning pool
fleischer pulled powerful hydraulics
david fleischer kim ellis drowned
raging waters
six survivors could wait hope rescue
wanted take kids canyon bad
completely forgot
unfortunate couple people lost lives
especially unfortunate
didnt happen
errors judgment made
zion grounds
first influx canyoneers
park would also witness steady increase accidents
response park managers went work
developing sophisticated rescue procedures focused
extracting victims inaccessible canyons
average backcountry rescues summer
national park plenty chances
perfect skills
course want good
want good search rescue
want improve high angle techniques
use
wan na improve emergency medical skills
feel like weve got advanced
highly competent search rescue team park
thats really message wan na get across
get hurt one slot canyons
youre gon na
wed rather people recognize
feel like theres highly competent rescue team
zion go push limits
guys go get something bad happens
believe strongly concept wilderness
part concept wilderness
idea people go
make good decisions
dont gon na pay
want people ready solve problems
want people ready take care
definitely dont want people
feel like somebodys gon na take care
make mistakes
hope people continue look
tools toolbox
ability solve problems
also hope people continue understand
zion simply outdoor playground
national park wilderness
guys know isnt guided trip
responsible right
think important part job
facilitate experiences
boss
encourage people
become selfreliant canyoneers
goal step back let solve problems
let make decisions
start getting little nervous large group
okay someones go ahead next person
rappel
okay rope
right ever next
high expectations former students
confident give solid skill set
toolbox
rope okay
thank steve

youre fine
im fine
screwed
thinking dodged bullet
extreme amount luck involved
part relieved happy see
happy see safe
another part wanted kick ass
jigger huh
okay im still pissed
well
following success
first technical guide
mike set create second volume
hoping include new offerings updated book
turned challenging canyons
last well three four years
continuing get difficult canyons
maybe ive got many difficult canyons
edition
would nice first get thing
thats everybody wants
want first descent something
took get didnt
mikes opportunity challenge arrived
form high stemming
narrow bottom passage
vshaped canyons force canyoneer high ground
climber might place protection fall
smooth canyon walls offer little support
mikes adventures reach new heights
consequences
extreme course x slot canyons
thats definitely lifethreatening
x r actually part kind
wall rock climbing rating
basically boils
risk involved canyon
x canyon might
difficult exposed rock climbing
might canyon
thats got long sections commitment
rappel pull rope
choice finish canyon
mikes updated version
technical canyoneering guide
included dozen r x rated canyons
theres people want extend adventure
going canyons
ones gon na
even attempt r x rated canyons
guess thats reason added
want go far possibly
thats hitting limit people
absolute limit
one person could make argument
shouldnt published
keep people away
people say yeah sooner later
people gon na hear em
community service publish
make clear
difficult high risk canyons
hopefully theyll sense
work way
start simple rappelling simple slots
work point
youre lot chimney work
think fair warning
long people fact understand rating system
importantly
theyve actually done honest assessment
skills
people couple easy canyons say
okay whats next wan na jump
something big
need pay dues
jump big ones
okay let think second
growing resume canyon descents
steve progressed serious endeavors
expanding knowledge base gained
early canyoneering classes
sharpened skills guidance
experienced partners
thank youre belayer
bottom yeah
want keep arms locked
walk arms
pushing wall
pushing wall bend
sliding hands body
uh yeah work
work em
okay sliding
dont pull push
pulling
oh okay
oh yeah nice
ive got
poifect
im
part team
difficult canyons traversed ease efficiency
steve advanced hazardous ratings
biggest challenge still eluded
walls low point
marked meters map
climb left north little ridge
top route find northeast
overlook lower end middle fork
planning x canyon
think initially theres
theres anxiety
getting
immediately wrap canyon tightens
youll start high stemming
meters
certainly canyon requires high stemming
youre putting lot line
skills
dont youre wrong canyon
knowing youre getting
think important
knowing something youre going
comfortable
cause committing canyon
complete
safely
far evolving walk canyons
x slots
mean natural progression
youre looking new adventure
everybodys looking new adventure
natural progression walking
x slots
yeah readers come along im sure
got halfway canyon
turn back
bit slots
thats middle slot
xx slot
good one
anyway went come back
right hand side wall
climbed
right id hate go back
looks pretty tough
okay
think turns
starts get pretty nasty looking
dark menacing fracture
scorpion west listed guidebook
difficult canyon author ever seen
climbing one piece without helmet
none us helmets
getting difficult spot
slipped fell
fell pack
head hit rock behind something
wasnt far know
bleeding like dolt
nobody took picture
high ground
group encountered green moss covering walls
without friction sandstone
already treacherous adventure become deadly
think getting exhausted
know hot summer
getting tired point
decided much us
fatigued hours
relentless high stemming
mike group turned back
book mike deemed canyon impossible
without aid climbing hardware
first incomplete canyon
well dont really animosity
whatever toward canyon
didnt make thats
dont cry spilt milk whatever say
mean started getting close
first time
pays something difficult
pays young little stupid
like younger mountainclimbing
big glaciers big crevasses going alone
kind stupid
got ta retire sooner later
difficult stuff
id rather live die old age
bottom one frankly
hes starting reach limit
comfortably safely
think recognizes great
concern goes ratings go
know hes fully capable
theres always risk factor goes
comfortable youre
point realize
maybe shouldnt
maybe thats call dont
long ways
idea x canyon stemming
certainly woke night
gon na risking great injury
fail
im feeling good absolutely
think theres nesting birds
live right
looks tight
lots right away
gee thats like foot wide
crazy
dude whole thing moving
really
oh dont like
oh poop
saw move
pack heavy
something happens thats going way
someone tires cant proceed
part two someone fall

hope well youre planning
youre planning strong team
theres gon na ifs
right
wow really bottom drop away
would say probably feet
hard get clear picture bottom
im gon na say thats
im forced go little bit
getting little mossy
wet
certainly looks moist
part right
think needs little water come back life
got ta get higher
dont wan na rely handhold
got charlie horse
im getting workout
elbows starting feel abraded
sections think actually see
bottom maybe little psychological well
think point crosses less fun
challenge enjoy challenge
keep developing skills
think fun diminished
turn looks like wider bottom
looks like make little bit sand
bottom maybe grass
hopefully well walking little bit
move forward
get stemming little bit
let bodies recuperate
see guess really didnt see bottom
thought
maybe fantasizing look
see golden wall
suspect walking point
whew
think gon na walking another yards
canyon relent
guess im gon na wait see sure
thought opening
still tight
end stemming section
long section kelsey describes
hour half stemming
point way exit
dont want continue stemming
