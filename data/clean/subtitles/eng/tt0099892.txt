why not 
i only have 12 catalogues left 
okay 
i ll take care of this 
how you doing 
well  i m not feeling very good  mr  waturi 
what s new  you never feel good 
well  that s a problem 
  i have a doctor s appointment today 
  another doctor s appointment 
what s this dede tells me
about the catalogues 
  i only have 12 
  how d you let that happen 
  i told you 
  when 
three weeks ago  then two weeks ago 
did you tell me last week 
no 
  why not 
  i thought you knew 
not good enough  joe 
not nearly good enough 
  i put you in charge of the entire library 
  this room 
i gave you carte blank in here 
you put the orders in the printer  not me 
you re not competent to put orders
into the printer  it s a very technical job 
  you were going to explain it to me 
  better than that 
i was going to make you
assistant manager 
i want to make you assistant manager 
but you re not flexible  you re inflexible 
  i don t feel inflexible 
  you re inflexible  totally 
another doctor s appointment 
you re always going to the doctor 
  i don t feel good 
  so what 
you think i feel good 
nobody feels good 
after childhood  it s a fact of life 
i feel rotten  so what 
i don t let it bother me
or interfere with my job 
what do you want from me 
you re like a child  what s the lamp for 
isn t there enough light in here for you 
fluorescents affect me 
they make me feel blotchy and   
      puffy  i thought this light 
  get rid of it 
this is not your bedroom  joe 
this is an office 
if you treat this like a job instead
of a welfare hospital  you ll shape up 
i want those catalogues 
  then  please  order them 
  watch yourself 
think about what i just said 
you ve got to get yourself
into a flexible frame   
   or else you are no place 
and take that light off the desk 
  i will 
  do it now 
good 
  why do you let him talk to you like that 
  like what 
  what s wrong with you 
  i don t feel good 
  what s the matter with you 
  i don t know 
i don t know 
mr  banks 
dr  ellison will see you now 
how are you feeling  mr  banks 
the same  i feel puffy and blotchy 
i never have any energy 
i keep getting sore throats 
i just don t feel very good 
how long have you felt this way 
pretty much since
i left the fire department 
on and off since then  about eight years 
what did you do in the fire department 
you know  i put out fires 
was it dangerous 
yeah  there was some pretty rough stuff 
but i came out of it okay 
the hard part was when i started
never feeling good and had to quit 
i ve gotten the results of your tests 
i have cancer 
no 
something is wrong
with my blood or urine 
they re fine 
but there is something 
  tell me 
  you have a brain cloud 
brain cloud 
a black fog of tissue
running down the center of your brain 
it s very rare 
it ll spread at a regular rate 
it s very destructive 
and it s incurable 
yes 
how long 
six months 
you can count on it being about that 
it s not painful 
your brain will simply fail 
followed abruptly by your body 
you can depend on at least
four or five months of perfect health 
what are you talking about 
i don t feel good now 
that s the ironic part 
mr  banks  you re a hypochondriac 
nothing is wrong that has
anything to do with your symptoms 
i think your experiences
in the fire department were traumatic 
you experienced the imminent possibility
of death several times 
  yeah 
  you survived 
the cumulative anxiety of those brushes
with death left you habitually fearful   
   about your physical person 
i m not sick except for a terminal disease 
which has no symptoms  that s right 
it was because of your insistence
on so many tests that we discovered it 
what ll i do 
if you have any savings 
you might think about taking a trip 
  a vacation 
  i have no savings 
a few hundred bucks 
i spent everything i had on doctors 
perhaps you ll want a second opinion 
brain cloud 
i knew it  i didn t know it  but i knew it 
what am i going to do 
you have some time left  mr  banks 
you have some life left 
my advice to you is 
live it well 
no 
you were wrong 
he was wrong 
who said that  i didn t say that 
if i said that  i would have been wrong 
i would have been wrong  isn t that right 
i m not arguing that with you 
i m not arguing that with you 
i m not arguing that with you 
let me call you back 
i got something here 
don t say anything
until we finish our conversation 
you were at lunch three hours 
about that 
where s my friend  where is my friend 
mr  waturi 
mr  waturi 
hello 
this is company property 
don t touch that 
  what are you doing 
  i m opening or closing the main drain 
you shouldn t be touching that 
nothing happened 
do you know how long i wondered
what would happen if i did that 
  what s wrong with you 
  brain cloud 
never mind  listen  mr  waturi 
i quit 
  today 
  that s right 
that s great  don t come looking
for a reference from me 
okay  i won t 
robinson crusoe 
you blew this job 
romeo and juliet 
the odyssey 
you blew this job 
ukulele 
i worked here four and a half years 
the work i did
i probably could have done in six months 
that leaves four years left over 
four years 
if i had them now   
like gold in my hand 
here 
for you 
good bye  dede 
you re going 
if you re leaving  leave 
you ll get your check  and i promise you 
you ll be easy to replace 
  i should say something 
  what are you muttering 
this life    life  what a joke 
this situation  this room   
you should just go 
you look terrible  mr  waturi 
you look like a bag of shit
stuffed in a cheap suit 
but no one could look good
under these zombie lights 
i can feel them sucking the juice
out of my eyeballs 
suck  suck 
 300 a week 
for  300 a week i ve lived in this sink 
this used rubber 
  watch it  there s a woman here 
  don t you think i know that 
don t you think i m aware
there s a woman here 
i can smell her like a flower 
i can taste her like sugar on my tongue 
i m 20 feet away  i can hear the fabric
of her dress when she moves 
but i haven t done anything about it 
i go every day not doing  not saying   
   not taking the chance for  300 a week 
and  frank  the coffee  it stinks 
it tastes like arsenic 
if the lights don t give you a headache 
you must be dead 
so  let s arrange the funeral 
you better go  i m telling you 
  you re telling me nothing 
  i m telling you 
why  i ask myself  have i put up with you 
i can t imagine 
but i know  it s fear 
yellow  freaking fear 
i ve been too afraid to live my life 
so i sold it to you   
   for  300 dollars a week 
you re lucky i don t kill you 
you re lucky i don t rip your throat out 
but i m not going to 
maybe you re not so lucky   
   because i m going to leave you here 
mr  wahoo waturi 
what could be worse than that 
  dede 
  yeah 
  how about dinner tonight 
  okay 
wow  what a change 
who am i  that s the real question 
who am i  who are you 
what other questions are there  really 
if you want to understand the universe 
embrace it  the door is you 
  me 
  you  me 
  you are really intense 
  am i 
yeah  i guess i am  i was 
  what do you mean 
  i mean  a long time ago 
in the beginning i was full
of piss and vinegar  nothing got me down 
i wanted to know 
know what 
everything 
but then i had some experiences 
i talked to this guy
and he says i got scared 
of what 
have you ever been scared 
i guess so  sure 
what scared you 
lots of things 
at the moment  you scare me a little 
me  why should i scare you 
i don t know 
there s something going on with you 
this morning you were like a lump 
and now you re   
how do you feel 
i feel great 
see  you never feel great 
no  i never do 
what s funny 
i feel great  that is very funny 
where are you 
i m right here 
i wish i was where you are 
no  you don t 
did i ever tell you
that the first time i saw you   
   i felt i had seen you before 
wait a minute 
what d you do 
i bribed them to sing a song to drive us
insane and make our hearts burst 
what happened to you 
what happened to you that you re so alive 
i can see it 
there s something wrong with my brain 
it s not catching 
but i have just five or six months to live 
  what 
  i m going to die 
and i m just so appreciative of my life 
  i got to go 
  please  don t 
i got to go home  you may have quit 
but i have the job in the morning 
i really want you to stay 
  you re going to die 
  but so what 
stay tonight 
tomorrow will take care of itself 
i can t handle it  joe 
sorry 
i forgot my bag 
joe banks  mr  joe banks 
have i come at a bad time 
yes  no 
  i don t know how to answer that question 
  can i come in to talk 
you re not dressed 
doesn t bother me if it doesn t bother you 
not a nice place you have  joe 
mind if i call you joe 
dingy 
dismal  shabby  dinky 
not much 
it s a sign of tremendous sophistication   
   that you haven t demanded my name   
   or asked me what i m doing here 
my name is samuel harvey graynamore 
  joe banks 
  oh  i know 
trying to see the hero in there 
what 
you dragged two kids down
a six story burning staircase 
that was brave 
then you went back for the third kid 
that was heroic  you re a hero 
that was a long time ago 
  yes  it was 
  how do you know my name 
i know all about you 
all i could learn in 24 hours  anyway 
peanuts 
  quit your job 
  yeah 
sounded like a dumb job  no family 
good for you 
families are a pain in the neck 
what do you know about superconductors 
  nothing 
  me  neither 
i own a company that dominates
the world market for superconductors 
really 
sit down 
dr  ellison   
   you were at his office yesterday 
yes 
he told me your news 
he thought that you and i
might be able to help each other 
got any whiskey 
nope 
i want to hire you  joe banks 
i want to hire you to jump into a volcano 
you know   
   i do have some whiskey 
there s an island in the south pacific
called waponi woo 
the name means 
 the little island with the big volcano   
the waponis are a cheerful people
who live simply fishing and picking fruit 
their one fear is that big volcano 
they call it the big woo 
they believe   
   that an angry fire god in the volcano
will sink the island   
   unless once every 100 years
he is appeased 
it s been 99 years 
11 months  and 11 days   
   since the fire god got his propers 
and the waponis are scared 
how is the god appeased 
of his own free will 
a man has to jump into the volcano 
none of the waponis are anxious
for the honor of jumping into the big woo 
  so  what do you do 
  what 
you do some trading 
there s a mineral on that island 
mr  banks  called bubureau 
there isn t anywhere else
you can find more than a gram 
i ve looked 
because without bubureau 
i can t make superconductors 
i tried to get mineral rights
from the waponis but   
   i have nothing they want 
but they do want a hero  mr  banks 
they ll give me the mineral rights
if i find them one 
why would i jump into a volcano 
from your actions in the fire department 
i think you have the courage 
you do 
is it more gutsy to twice traverse
a staircase in flames   
   or to make a one time leap
into the mouth of a smoking volcano 
damned if i know  kimosabe 
i know when you make those kinds of calls 
you re up in high country 
from your doctor  you re on your way out 
you have no money  i checked 
want to wait it out in this apartment 
that sounds grim to me 
not the way i d want to go  i ll tell you 
these are yours if you take the job 
it s 20 days from today
before you d have to jump into the volcano 
you could shop today 
get yourself clothes for an adventure 
then tomorrow  a plane to l a 
first class  naturally 
you ll stay at the best hotel 
the next day you board a yacht 
my competitors often watch the airports 
my yacht s a beauty  gourmet chef 
sail to the south pacific in 15 days 
waponis come out to meet you 
a total red carpet situation 
you re a hero  like charles lindbergh 
wine  women  and song
in the sweetest paradise you ever saw 
then   
   you jump into the volcano 
live like a king  die like a man  i say 
what do you say 
i ll do it 
here s my card 
and your plane ticket  american 
noon out of kennedy tomorrow 
i have an american express gold card

that s an important topic to me  mr    
  banks 
  clothes make the man  i believe that 
you say you want to buy clothes 
but you don t know what kind 
you leave it hanging in the air
like i ll fill in the blanks 
that s like asking me who you are 
and i don t know who you are 
i don t want to know 
it s taken me all my life to find out
who i am  and i am tired now

wait a minute  i m coming back

i m totally untrustworthy 
i m a flibbertigibbet 
come on  let s get out of here 
i have some luggage 
then  follow me 
  i ve never been to l a  before 
  you re kidding  what do you think

  yes 
there s a painting of mine right there 
that s terrific 
where do you get your ideas 
you have to understand something
about art 
it comes from some place 
nice view 
it s like looking down on the stars 
would you like to hear one of my poems 
 long ago  the delicate tangles of his hair
 covered the emptiness of my hands 
  want to hear it again 
  okay 
 long ago
 the delicate tangles of his hair
 covered the emptiness of my hands 
what s wrong 
you ever think about killing yourself  
what 
why would you do that 
why shouldn t i 
some things take care of themselves 
they re not your job 
maybe not even your business 
i like your poem 
i m a grown woman
and i live on my father s money 
the restaurant that had my painting up
is my father s restaurant 
listen to me 
if you have a choice
between killing yourself  and   
   doing something you re scared of doing   
   why not do the thing
you re scared of doing 
you mean stop taking money
and leave l a  
see  you know
what you re scared of doing 
why don t you do it  see what happens 
you must be tired 
i don t mind talking 
i do 
this is one of those conversations
where we re open   
   and sharing our thoughts
and it s all bullshit   
   and a lie 
and it doesn t cost you anything 
look  i don t know you 
i don t think i know anybody 
i can see that you re angry 
i m very troubled 
i m not ready to   
there s only so much time  and   
   you want to use it well 
so  i m here  talking to you

as he loves money 
can i ask you something 
why are you dressed like jungle jim 
i could change 
do you think this is inappropriate
for the boat 
no  it s fine 
we better go 
i have a guy taking your trunks

  yeah 
that outfit is wearing you  felix 
why are you calling me felix 
my name is joe 
i m calling you felix
because i do what i want 
hello  angelica 
hello  patricia 
do you know where daddy is 
we never know where our father is
and always suspect the other one knows 
but it s all phone calls and telegrams 
eh  angelica 
well  you re in a rotten mood 
the sunshine gets me down 
where are you going 
dad says not to tell you  goes with
my theory  power makes you paranoid 
well  get ready to heave  felix 
my name is joseph or joe 
all right  joe  get ready  we re leaving 
  wish me luck 
  good luck 
you re shaking 
i am 
here you go 
that looks delicious 
we eat well aboard the tweedle dee 
  the tweedle dee 
  that s the name of the boat 
so  we re going to the island
of waponi woo 
  i guess so 
  why 
  you don t know 
  no 
  have you been there 
  no 
all i know is the name means
 little island with the big volcano    
   and the people  the waponis 
like orange soda 
they like orange soda 
 1 800 years ago a roman galley
with a crew of jews and druids   
     got caught in a storm off carthage 
 they were swept 1 000 miles off course   
     and ended up
on the wrong side of africa 
 trying to return to rome 
they sailed into the south pacific   
     and colonized a lightly populated
polynesian island   
     which they named waponi woo 
 thus was born the waponi culture   
     a mix of polynesian  celtic  hebrew 
and latin influences 
 the waponi are known to have
a peculiar love of orange soda   
     and no sense of direction   
why did you talk so snotty
back on the dock 
because you work for my father 
and i m angry with my father 
why are you angry with him 
because he s never around 
if you re angry  why do you work for him 
i don t work for him 
my transport of you is strictly a favor 
you do favors for people you re mad at 
i don t work for him 
he s giving me this boat for taking you 
he s got two of them 
there s a tweedle dum  too 
that makes everything okay  then 
yes  it does 
is this okay 
sure 
the boys sleep in the hull 
dagmar usually sleeps on deck 
so you have things to yourself 
i m in the little stateroom 
great 
i m sorry i was rude on the dock 
it s okay 
did you sleep with my sister 
no 
actually  she s my half sister 
no  i didn t 
  you like to fish 
  sure 
tomorrow we ll do some fishing 
this is the light switch 
did mike show you
how to work the bathroom 
yeah 
do you want me to turn it off while i go 
okay 
i love my sister 
even though she s screwed up 
i love my father 
even though i never see him   
   and he s not great when i do see him 
i m nervous about this trip 
neither you nor my father
will tell me anything 
but it s more than that 
i ve always kept clear of my father s stuff
since i was on my own   
   and he s pulled me back in 
he used this boat
to get me to work for him   
   which i swore i d never do 
i feel ashamed   
   because i had a price 
he named it 
and now i know that about myself 
i could treat you like i did on the dock 
but that would be   
   me kicking myself for selling out 
which isn t fair to you 
doesn t make me feel any better 
i don t know your situation 
but i wanted you to know mine 
not just to explain some rude behavior   
   but because   
   we re on a little boat for a while and   
   i m soul sick 
you ll see that 
like my sister  she s soul sick  too 
if you d slept with her   
   i d have known something about you 
but you didn t 
you didn t 
and i believe you 
i m glad you believe me 
have you slept on a boat before 
no 
it really effects your dreams 
i look forward to it  though the dreams
sometimes shake me up 
okay 
good night 
i m leaving you on this island 
  that s right 
  for how long 
for the rest of my life 
i can t imagine that 
  are you used to this 
  what 
the ocean  the stars 
you never get used to it 
that s why i want this boat 
all i want to do is sail away 
where would you go 
away from the things of man 
do you believe in god 
i believe in myself 
what s that mean 
i have confidence in myself 
i ve been doing some soul searching lately 
know what i found out 
i have no interest in myself 
i start thinking about myself 
i get bored out of my mind 
what does interest you 
i don t know 
courage  courage interests me 
so  you ll spend the rest of your life
on an island in the south pacific 
till now i ve lived on a tiny island
called staten island 
commuted to this job in a shut up room 
pumped in air  no sunshine   
   despicable people 
now that i have some distance from
the situation  i find that unbelievable 
your life seems unbelievable to me 
but all of this life seems so   
   unbelievable to me 
my father says the whole world is asleep 
everyone you know  everyone you see 
everyone you talk to 
only a few people are awake   
   and they live in a state
of constant  total amazement 
i have six months to live 
the waponis believe they need
a human sacrifice or the island will sink 
your father hired me
to jump into the volcano 
what 
you re not gonna make me say that again 
are you 
no 
well 
aren t you going to say anything 
i don t know what to say 
you say you re dying  and going
to jump into a volcano  my mind is blank 
i can understand that 
is it catching 
no  no  no 
good night  i ll see you in the morning 
it s weird today  huh

  good morning  mr  banks

you worried 
we ll be okay  the hatches and sails
are down  we re ahead of the game 
what exactly is a typhoon 
you know   
   i think you re going to find out 
mayday  this is the tweedle dee 
latitude  10 degrees  8 minutes south 
longitude  approximately 150 degrees 
18 minutes west 
  we are in severe distress 
  what should i do 
don t go on deck 
the engines  check on dagmar 
mayday 
dagmar  is everything okay

take care of patricia 
150 degrees  18 minutes west 
severe distress 
no way is anyone getting this 
  how s dagmar

the main boom doesn t look secure 
it looks like it s going to bust loose

i might as well go out in style 
we are the children of children   
   and we live as we are shown 
now  a change has come 
the waponis like this soda
and no one will jump into the big woo 
they traded with this man 
your father  for a hero 
we have no hero of our own 
i am the tobi  i cannot be the hero 
it is my place to hope for my people 
the woo calls 
none of my people say 
 i ll go to my end for all of you   
i don t have any people of my own  chief 
i m my only hope for a hero 
once more 
i will call upon the waponis for a hero 
the woo wants his flesh 
take me to   
   the volcano 
is there a ceremony or anything 
no  you just jump in

i have wasted my entire life
and now i m going to die 
i have a chance to die like a man 
i have to take it 
i love you

we ll take this leap and we ll see 
that s life 
i saw the moon when we were out on
the ocean  shining down on everything 
i ve been miserable so long 
years of my life  wasted 
been a long time coming here to meet you 
a long time  on a crooked road 
did i ever tell you   
   the first time i saw you   
   i felt like i d seen you before 
you re not jumping without me 
so  what are we hoping for here 
a miracle 
a miracle 
i love you

this is it 
this is it 
give me your hand 
i love you  too 
patricia 
why aren t you dead 
why aren t you dead 
i don t know 
  the volcano 
  we jumped in and it blew us out 
that s impossible 
i d say  at least it s a miracle 
there goes waponi woo 
god  we really lucked out 
yeah  but   
but what 
i hate to mention it 
but we re in the middle of nowhere 
we re going to drown 
no  we re not  we re going to be all right 
i don t know how 
but we re going to be all right

what s the matter 
  i still have a problem 
  what 
i have a brain cloud 
a brain cloud 
what is that 
well  it s   
maybe i should get a second opinion 
you didn t get a second opinion
about something called a brain cloud 
i just felt 
what are you  a hypochondriac 
i was  not now 
nothing is wrong with you 
dr  ellison said 
so some quack told you   
  dr  ellison

dr  ellison doesn t have any other patients 
my father owns dr  ellison 
why would he

  who 
  my father 
you mean  he set me up 
  yeah 
  no 
i don t have a brain cloud 
couldn t they think of something better
than  a brain cloud  
my whole life i ve been a victim 
i ve been a dupe  a pawn 
my throat is closing up 
no  joe  your whole life is ahead of you 
that s true 
that s good news 
i suppose so 
  it s great 
  yeah  that s good 
i m relieved  that s great  i m saved 
but   
what is it now 
we re on a raft  no land in sight 
i don t know 
it ll always be something with you 
won t it 
yeah 
i ll tell you one thing 
wherever we go  whatever we do
