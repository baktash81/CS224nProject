definitely need a shower
come on ill take you home
show me your hands
very good now open the door
put your hands on your head
behind your head
face the front of the vehicle

damn
muse will you take these things off
shit you put them on so tight
i like realism
you never know whos watching brian
nice crib sergeant its a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated
aint it eddie fisher built this house
for elizabeth taylor in the 50s
you see even the cops
are hollywood in hollywood
okay here he is
fresh from torettos hot rod heaven
that was an 80000 vehicle officer
you told him what happened
he knows
send the bill to johnny tran
the kids giving me attitude
it doesnt speak well
for policefbi relations tanner
i walk in the door and the guys already
all right all right
well talk okay lets talk about it
muse why dont you make us
four iced cappuccinos please
come on
regular or decaf sarge
decaf i think
four hijackings in two months
and we have nothing
the dvd players and digital cameras
are worth 12 million
which brings the grand total
to 6 million plus
were in the political crosshairs now brian
thats why youre undercover
you want that detective badge fast kid
and you want to know something
the fbi can help
if you come through for us
what does the truckdriver say
he gave us the same mo
three honda civics precision driving
the same green neon glow
from under the chassis
lab says the skidmarks came back
the same mashamoto zx tires
so we know its somebody
in the streetracing world
if we dont make this case the truckers
will take matters into their own hands
i tell them were close
are you going to make me a liar
look what do we know
we know this world
revolves around toretto right
im not saying that hes the one
thats popping these trucks
but i can guarantee he knows who is
its just a matter of time until i win
you want time buy the magazine
we dont have time
just get me something i can use
is harry cooperating
like a guy thatll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesnt
what kind of vibe
is he getting from toretto
hes scared of him
but he doesnt think hes jacking trucks
hes too controlled for that
wait
not that i want to contradict
harrys fine judge of character
but toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death
hes got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain
do not turn your back on him
tanner im gonna need another car
what about parts and service
hold off on it
dom i dont know what to do with it
all right what the hell is this
what do you got there
this is your car
my car
i said a 10second car not a 10minute car
you could push this across the finish line
or tow it
you couldnt even tow that
across the finish line
no faith
i have faith in you
but this isnt a junkyard
this is a garage
pop the hood
pop the hood
pop the hood
2jz engine no shit
and what did i tell you
i retract my previous statement
you know what
this will decimate all
after you put about 15000 in it

okay you stand watch
yo dominic
theres no engines

to buy anything
what
we got a wolf pack
its johnny tran
and hes coming your way really fast
all right we got company spilner
come on move
let me ask you a question ted
do you see anything wrong here
no
we got no engines do we
no
do we
no
a couple of nissan sr20 motors

one week before race wars huh
yeah probably
youre a smart fence ted
maybe too smart
what are you feeling lance
40weight
50weight
a 40weight sounds nice
where are they ted
where are they
enough
where are they
theyre in a warehouse
theyre in a warehouse man
ted
kiss my shoes
lets go get our engines
my superiors are flying in from dc
in two days
i want something to show
weve got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth
automatic weapons
priors on every one of these asian punks
a garage full of dvd players
and generally psychotic behavior
tell me why we shouldnt move
on tran now and figure it out later
because all we have is behavior
let me get hard evidence
because what we have now is just
what we have is probable cause
and truckers arming themselves for some
good oldfashioned vigilante mayhem
tell us about hector brian
latinos with spear guns give me a break
hectors still working on the engines
but the tires dont match
will somebody give me a cigarette
get him a cigarette
dont give him one
i thought you quit
i did just give me one
get him a cigarette
no
tell me about toretto
i told you
i think hes too controlled for this
going suicidal on semitrucks no way
maybe vince but hes too dumb to do it
i think the kid sisters blurring your vision
what did you say
i dont blame you
id get off on her surveillance photos too
knock it off
what are you going native on me brian
have you read torettos file lately
yeah i memorized that file
read it again
no better still take a look at these
remember i told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death
toretto did this
with a threequarterinch torque wrench
hes a model of selfcontrol
i need a few more days
i need a few more days
got a tr7 here
with a ballbearing upgrade
what its going to do is
its going to spool up really quick
i got this set up for 24 psi
got it
you got big plans tonight
yeah were going out to dinner
you break her heart ill break your neck
thats not gonna happen
i want to show you something
me and my dad built her
nine hundred horses of detroit muscle
its a beast
you know what she ran in palmdale
no what
nine seconds flat
god
my dad was driving
so much torque
the chassis twisted coming off the line
barely kept her on the track
so whats your best time
ive never driven her
why not
it scares the shit out of me
thats my dad
he was coming up
in the pro stockcar circuit
last race of the season
a guy named kenny linder
came up from inside in the final turn
he clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120
i watched my dad burn to death
i remembered hearing him scream
but the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew
they said it was me who was screaming
i saw linder about a week later
i had a wrench and i hit him
and i didnt intend to keep hitting him
but when i finished i couldnt lift my arm
hes a janitor at a high school
he has to take the bus to work every day
and they banned me
from the tracks for life
i live my life a quartermile at a time
nothing else matters
not the mortgage not the store
not my team and all their bullshit
for those 10 seconds or less
im free
so how is it anyways
that the gang came to be
what
the gang
the gang
no they dont call themselves a gang
what do they call themselves
theyre a team
they call themselves a team
all right how did the team come to be
well thats a whole lot of history
ive got time
okay vince grew up with my brother
actually he didnt ever actually grow up
as you can tell
but they were friends as kids
and letty she just lived down the street
always into cars though
ever since she was like 10 years old
so naturally you know
my brother always had her attention
and then she turned 16
and then she had doms attention
yeah its funny how that works isnt it
yeah
how does jesse fit into the whole thing
jesse well jesse and leon just sort of
showed up one night and never ever left
its just the way my brother is you know
doms like
hes like gravity
everything just gets pulled to him
even you
no
no
the only thing that pulled me in was you
being friends with your brother
is just a bonus
thats good
thats good its nice to come first
every once in a while
want to go for a drive
yeah
the hijackers have hit again
bilkins has decided that were gonna move
on johnny tran and his guys at 1700
unless you say otherwise
if you agree just say yes
yeah
who is that
its just a wrong number
yes sir yeah i know but
yeah yes sir
yeah i got it
the dvd players were purchased legally
all weve got are a couple
of lowrent weapons charges
and some outstanding speeding tickets
so theyre out
yeah
father bailed them out

i can expect from you oconner
youre gonna put this on me
i can put it on whoever i want to
perks of the job
no you cant put this on me
no wait a minute let me tell you
i dont care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens

or you might want to think
about another career
