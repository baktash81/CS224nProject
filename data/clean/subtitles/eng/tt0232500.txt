he usually doesn t like anybody 
  he s a complicated guy 
  yeah  what about you 
  i m simpler 
  you re a shitty liar 
well  i ll take that as a compliment 
  but there s a problem 
  what s that 
you need to get some sleep 
and you definitely 
definitely need a shower 
come on  i ll take you home 
show me your hands 
very good  now open the door 
put your hands on your head 
behind your head 
face the front of the vehicle 
walk backwards towards the rear 
take two steps to your right 
stop right there 
  what did i do 
  shut up  he s clean  sarge 
damn 
muse  will you take these things off 
  shit  you put them on so tight 
  i like realism 
you never know who s watching  brian 
nice crib  sergeant  it s a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated 
ain t it  eddie fisher built this house
for elizabeth taylor in the  50s 
you see  even the cops
are hollywood in hollywood 
okay  here he is 
fresh from toretto s hot rod heaven 
that was an  80 000 vehicle  officer 
  you told him what happened 
  he knows 
  send the bill to johnny tran 
  the kid s giving me attitude 
it doesn t speak well
for police fbi relations  tanner 
  i walk in the door and the guy s already   
  all right  all right 
we ll talk  okay  let s talk about it 
muse  why don t you make us
four iced cappuccinos  please 
  come on 
  regular or decaf  sarge 
decaf  i think 
four hijackings in two months 
and we have nothing 
the dvd players and digital cameras
are worth  1 2 million   
   which brings the grand total
to  6 million plus 
we re in the political crosshairs now  brian 
that s why you re undercover 
you want that detective badge fast  kid 
and you want to know something 
the fbi can help 
if you come through for us 
what does the truckdriver say 
he gave us the same m o  
three honda civics  precision driving   
   the same green neon glow
from under the chassis 
lab says the skidmarks came back
the same  mashamoto zx tires 
so  we know it s somebody
in the street racing world 
if we don t make this case  the truckers
will take matters into their own hands 
i tell them we re close 
are you going to make me a liar 
look  what do we know 
we know this world
revolves around toretto  right 
i m not saying that he s the one
that s popping these trucks   
   but i can guarantee he knows who is 
it s just a matter of time until i win   
you want time  buy the magazine 
we don t have time 
just get me something i can use 
is harry cooperating 
like a guy that ll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn t 
what kind of vibe
is he getting from toretto 
he s scared of him 
but he doesn t think he s jacking trucks 
  he s too controlled for that 
  wait 
not that i want to contradict
harry s fine judge of character   
   but toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death 
he s got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain 
do not turn your back on him 
tanner  i m gonna need another car 
  what about parts and service 
  hold off on it 
dom  i don t know what to do with it 
all right  what the hell is this 
what do you got there 
  this is your car 
  my car 
i said a 10 second car  not a 10 minute car 
you could push this across the finish line 
or tow it 
you couldn t even tow that
across the finish line 
no faith 
i have faith in you 
but this isn t a junkyard 
  this is a garage 
  pop the hood 
  pop the hood 
  pop the hood 
 2jz engine  no shit 
  and what did i tell you 
  i retract my previous statement 
  you know what 
this will decimate all
after you put about  15 000 in it 
or more 
if we have to overnight parts from japan 
  we ll put it on my tab at harry s 
  yes 
i gotta get you racing again
so i can make some money off your ass 
there s a show down in the desert
called race wars 
that s where you ll do it 
when you re not working at harry s 
you re working here 
if you can t find the right tool
in this garage  mr  arizona   
   you don t belong near a car 
he owns you now 
tell me what you think about this 
koni adjustables 
gonna save us about 2 pounds 
and they re gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot 
all right 
this is your basic layout of the car 
and that s pretty much
what it could look like when it s finished 
red  green 
  you should be going to mit or something 
  yeah  right

  add

he s a cop 
he s a cop 
you a cop 
let s go for a little ride 
walk 
okay  you stand watch 
yo  dominic 
there s no engines 
what are they planning on racing with 
hopes and dreams 
i don t know  but they re sneaky as shit   
   and they ve got enough money
to buy anything 
what 
we got a wolf pack 
it s johnny tran 
and he s coming your way really fast 
all right  we got company  spilner 
come on  move 
let me ask you a question  ted 
  do you see anything wrong here 
  no 
  we got no engines  do we 
  no 
  do we 
  no 
a couple of nissan sr20 motors
will pull a premium   
     one week before race wars  huh 
  yeah  probably 
you re a smart fence  ted 
maybe too smart 
what are you feeling  lance 
40 weight 
50 weight 
a 40 weight sounds nice 
where are they  ted 
  where are they 
  enough 
  where are they 
  they re in a warehouse 
they re in a warehouse  man 
ted 
kiss my shoes 
let s go get our engines 
my superiors are flying in from d c  
in two days 
i want something to show 
we ve got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth   
   automatic weapons 
priors on every one of these asian punks   
   a garage full of dvd players
and generally psychotic behavior 
tell me why we shouldn t move
on tran now and figure it out later 
because all we have is behavior 
let me get hard evidence 
because what we have now is just   
what we have is probable cause 
and truckers arming themselves for some
good old fashioned vigilante mayhem 
  tell us about hector  brian 
  latinos with spear guns  give me a break 
hector s still working on the engines 
but the tires don t match 
will somebody give me a cigarette 
  get him a cigarette 
  don t give him one 
  i thought you quit 
  i did  just give me one 
  get him a cigarette 
  no 
tell me about toretto 
i told you 
i think he s too controlled for this 
going suicidal on semi trucks  no way 
maybe vince  but he s too dumb to do it 
  i think the kid sister s blurring your vision 
  what did you say 
i don t blame you 
i d get off on her surveillance photos  too 
knock it off 
what  are you going native on me  brian 
have you read toretto s file lately 
  yeah  i memorized that file 
  read it again 
no  better still  take a look at these 
remember i told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death 
toretto did this
with a three quarter inch torque wrench 
he s a model of self control 
i need a few more days 
i need a few more days 
got a tr7 here 
with a ball bearing upgrade 
what it s going to do is 
it s going to spool up really quick 
  i got this set up for 24 psi 
  got it 
you got big plans tonight 
yeah  we re going out to dinner 
you break her heart  i ll break your neck 
that s not gonna happen 
i want to show you something 
me and my dad built her 
nine hundred horses of detroit muscle 
it s a beast 
  you know what she ran in palmdale 
  no  what 
nine seconds flat 
  god 
  my dad was driving 
so much torque 
the chassis twisted coming off the line 
barely kept her on the track 
  so  what s your best time 
  i ve never driven her 
why not 
it scares the shit out of me 
that s my dad 
he was coming up
in the pro stock car circuit 
last race of the season 
a guy named kenny linder
came up from inside  in the final turn 
he clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120 
i watched my dad burn to death 
i remembered hearing him scream 
but the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew 
they said it was me who was screaming 
i saw linder about a week later 
i had a wrench  and i hit him 
and i didn t intend to keep hitting him 
but when i finished  i couldn t lift my arm 
he s a janitor at a high school 
he has to take the bus to work every day 
and they banned me
from the tracks for life 
i live my life a quarter mile at a time 
nothing else matters 
not the mortgage  not the store   
   not my team and all their bullshit 
for those 10 seconds or less   
   i m free 
so  how is it  anyways 
that the gang came to be 
  what 
  the gang 
the gang 
no  they don t call themselves a gang 
  what do they call themselves 
  they re a team 
  they call themselves a team 
  all right  how did the team come to be 
well  that s a whole lot of history 
  i ve got time 
  okay  vince grew up with my brother 
actually  he didn t ever actually grow up 
as you can tell 
but they were friends as kids 
and letty  she just lived down the street 
always into cars  though 
ever since she was  like  10 years old 
so  naturally  you know 
my brother always had her attention 
  and then she turned 16   
  and then she had dom s attention 
yeah  it s funny how that works  isn t it 
yeah 
how does jesse fit into the whole thing 
jesse  well  jesse and leon just sort of
showed up one night and never  ever left 
it s just the way my brother is  you know 
dom s like   
he s like gravity 
everything just gets pulled to him 
even you 
no 
no 
the only thing that pulled me in was you 
being friends with your brother
is just a bonus 
that s good 
that s good  it s nice to come first
every once in a while 
want to go for a drive 
  yeah 
  the hijackers have hit again 
bilkins has decided that we re gonna move
on johnny tran and his guys at 17 00 
unless you say otherwise 
if you agree  just say yes 
  yeah 
  who is that 
it s just a wrong number 
yes  sir  yeah  i know  but   
yeah  yes  sir 
yeah  i got it 
the dvd players were purchased legally 
all we ve got are a couple
of low rent weapons charges   
   and some outstanding speeding tickets 
  so  they re out 
  yeah 
father bailed them out 
is this the kind of intelligence
i can expect from you  o conner 
  you re gonna put this on me 
  i can put it on whoever i want to 
  perks of the job 
  no  you can t put this on me   
no  wait a minute  let me tell you 
i don t care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens 
you ve got 36 hours to crack this bastard   
   or you might want to think
about another career 
it s toretto  brian 
it always has been toretto 
tran and hector are   
they re just fumes 
i know you ve been lying to me
