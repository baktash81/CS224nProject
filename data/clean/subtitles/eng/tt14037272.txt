welcome
make yourself at home
would you please um
respect my house
and take off your shoes
its my house no shoes
okay
so
you play dominoes
no
damn
whered you learn to fight
my father was a grand master
up in okla
so i grew up in his dojo
where he taught me how to fight
physically and spiritually
youre gonna have to survive
the dungeon
whatever it takes
i just wanna get home
to my daughter
bones well youre inside
the system now soldier
this place was designed to break
black and brown bodies like you
and you fell right in
so if you have any hope of ever
seeing your little girl again
you gonna need to do two things
the first one is forget about
that outside world
including your little girl
cause holding onto that
unreality
will get you killed
in this reality
and secondly
youre gonna have to survive
the dungeon
i can help you do that
why should i trust you
or anybody else
in this system
you cant
you mind if i use
your bathroom og
call me bones
its your bathroom now
mind the curtain
wherere we going
our new work assignment
keep moving
get to work
bones
now this area right here
this entire place used to be
used to break up circuit boards
that the warden would resell
now we get to use it
to spar here
they got us locked up
like animals
now we gotta fight like em
see youre different from a lot
of the catch
that run through this place
thats why when the warden
asked why i helped you
i told him its cause
you reminded me
of a young man
i knew a long time ago
now no matter what
in order to survive this place
youre going have to fight
the warden is gonna throw
your ass inside that dungeon
whether you like it or not
and whether you live or die
depends on what you know
now let me help you
do me the favor
and show me what you got
bones thats the
mexican mob over there
la familia
then youve got the
dragon nation
ruthless
nobody fucks with them
and youve met the
aryan brotherhood
aka the klan
with your encounter with
mongul their uh leader
yall gonna be good friends
now youve met my man freeway
hes crew is the black mafia
his style is a combination of
almost every style
but his nature is formless
so he calls himself freeway
thats crazy
combine other styles
hes good at that
i taught him
thats enough thats enough
now im gonna share something
with you
that ive rarely seen or said
you got all the heart
in the world
but if youre gonna survive
the dungeon tomorrow night
youre gonna need some skill
what do you mean tomorrow
every friday
is spent here in that dungeon
let me show you
what will help you
it starts with this
surrender
surrender
accept where you are
accept this reality
dungeon time
laughing
thumping

take them to the dungeon
i gotta go meet the warden
gina

im prepared
to fight for your freedom
freedom
yeah
theres been a lot of intel
coming out
about too many
new private prisons
and a lack of prisoners
to keep them filled
and some cities are so desperate
to keep these institutions open
and the extra boost it gives
to the local job economy
they are creating a new system
one of supply and demand
of live human bodies
mostly our people
black and brown people
mr savage
i need you to stay strong okay
we can fight this corrupt system
together
i just need you to trust me
im in here
they have physical custody
of my body
they own me
therefore
i must do what they say

janette i was able to use
the video on the chip you gave me
to get the state authorities
involved
and to bring the corruption
in this facility
to their attention
and i think you should know
the commissioner
hes in custody too
you see its hard to regulate
these corporate
prison institutions
we just have no control over
these private penitentiaries
so your evidence pushes the case
for regulation
i mean regardless
of what the men
inside these walls have done
theyre still human beings
and they deserve
to be treated as such
the state has also agreed
to give you a full pardon
i i coordinated
with the secretarys office
for you to be released today
thank you
the state has also agreed
to take care of your daughters
medical costs
i mean its the least
they can do for you right
maybe
do you need a ride

i wouldnt care if i was alive
thats what you gave me
the will
to wanna be alive again

even say thank you for
