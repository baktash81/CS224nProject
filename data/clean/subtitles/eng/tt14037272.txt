i served in the 77th wolf pack 
you and your squad

you play dominoes 
no 
damn 
where d you learn to fight 
my father was a grand master
up in okla 
so i grew up in his dojo
where he taught me how to fight 
physically and spiritually 
you re gonna have to survive
the dungeon 
whatever it takes 
i just wanna get home
to my daughter 
bones  well  you re inside
the system now  soldier 
this place was designed to break
black and brown bodies like you
and you fell right in 
so if you have any hope of ever
seeing your little girl again 
you gonna need to do two things 
the first one is forget about
that outside world 
including  your little girl 
 cause holding onto that
unreality
will get you killed
in this reality 
and secondly 
you re gonna have to survive
the dungeon 
i can help you do that 
why should i trust you
or anybody else
in this system 
you can t 
you mind if i use
your bathroom  og 
call me  bones  
it s your bathroom now 
mind the curtain 
where re we going 
our new work assignment 
keep moving 
get to work 
bones 
now this area right here 
this entire place used to be
used to break up circuit boards
that the warden would re sell 
now we get to use it
to spar here 
they got us locked up
like animals 
now we gotta fight like  em 
see you re different from a lot
of the catch
that run through this place 
that s why when the warden
asked why i helped you 
i told him it s  cause
you reminded me
of a young man
i knew a long time ago 
now no matter what 
in order to survive this place 
you re going have to fight 
the warden is gonna throw
your ass inside that dungeon
whether you like it or not
and whether you live or die 
depends on what you know 
now let me help you 
do me the favor
and show me what you got 
bones  that s the
mexican mob over there 
la familia 
then you ve got the
dragon nation 
ruthless 
nobody fucks with them 
and you ve met the
aryan brotherhood 
aka the klan 
with your encounter with
mongul  their uh  leader 
y all gonna be good friends 
now you ve met my man freeway 
he s crew is the black mafia 
his style is a combination of
almost every style 
but his nature is formless 
so he calls himself  freeway  
that s crazy 
combine other styles 
he s good at that 
i taught him 
that s enough  that s enough 
now i m gonna share something
with you
that i ve rarely seen or said 
you got all the heart
in the world 
but if you re gonna survive
the dungeon tomorrow night 
you re gonna need some skill 
what do you mean tomorrow 
every friday 
is spent here in that dungeon 
let me show you
what will help you 
it starts with this 
surrender 
surrender 
accept where you are 
accept this reality 
dungeon time

i graduated cum laude from
howard university school of law 
i m hihgly capable 
i m prepared
to fight for your freedom 
freedom 
yeah 
there s been a lot of intel
coming out
about too many
new private prisons
and a lack of prisoners
to keep them filled 
and some cities are so desperate
to keep these institutions open
and the extra boost it gives
to the local job economy 
they are creating a new system 
one of supply and demand
of live human bodies 
mostly our people 
black and brown people 
mr  savage 
i need you to stay strong  okay 
we can fight this corrupt system
together 
i just need you to trust me 
i m in here 
they have physical custody
of my body 
they own me 
therefore 
i must do what they say
when they say 
janette  listen  if
you    if you need anything 
call me 
i am goin 
to do everything i can
to get you out of here

he was determined
to take the dark path 
what makes you think
i ain t gonna go dark

the commissioner 
he s in custody  too 
you see it s hard to regulate
these corporate
prison institutions 
we just have no control over
these private penitentiaries 
so your evidence pushes the case
for regulation 
i mean regardless
of what the men
inside these walls have done 
they re still human beings
and they deserve
to be treated as such 
the state has also agreed
to give you a full pardon 
i    i coordinated
with the secretary s office
for you to be released today

the state has also agreed
to take care of your daughter s
medical costs
