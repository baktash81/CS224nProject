senator i suggest you remember that when the nasa
wants funding they call me
when the cia is going to take out a target
they ask first for my permission
when the president wants to know
which members of congress are politically vulnerable
in terms of oh lets say undiscovered criminal conduct
im on their memory dials
usa agency say they have been monitoring the blast
but in fact this was a covert military strike
no nation has yet claimed ownership
the cia is up my ass about this mystery
raid in the middle east
so its time to come clean was the unit involved
uh im not sure maam
all right guys this is how you do a decepticon
head kill shot
as director of national intelligence
im a really big fan of intelligent answers
ii cant really tell you definitively
these autobots are like teenage kids
they like to sneak out of the house once in a while
colonel lennox are you in command or are you not

ive never seen him so upset
optimus you remember charlotte mearing
our director of national intelligence
hes in a bad mood
hes a not want to talka to anybody today
what is this
the silent treatment
weve seen that and this is not that
definitely not  this is worse
prime make something of yourself
hes pissed
you lied to us
everything humans know of our planet
we were told had all been shared
so why was this found in human possession
we were in the dark on this also
it was director only clearance at sector 7 until now
the bag  which bag
hermes birkin green ostrich
oh my god
this is a secret few men knew
and fewer still remain alive
allow me to please introduce to you
two of nasas founding mission directors
and astronaut dr buzz aldrin
one of the first two men to step foot on the moon sir
optimus prime
from a fellow space traveler
its a true honor
the honor is mine
our entire space race of the 1960s
it appears was in response to an event
our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship
no survivors on board
we were sworn to secrecy by our commander in chief
this was a mission you will never speak of
i understand sir
a total of 35 people knew the real plan at nasa
soviets managed to land unmanned probes
somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod
we believe the russians deduced
that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly
believed they had it mastered and harnessed it at chernobyl
we went on six missions in all
we took hundreds of photos and samples
we locked them away forever
and the moon program was shut down
where did you search the crash hold
the ships name was the ark
i watched it escape cybertron myself
it was carrying an autobot
technology which would have won us the war
and its captain
who was this captain  the great sentinel prime
the technologys inventor
he was commander of the autobots
before me
its imperative that i find it
before the decepticons learn of its location
our autobot space craft has the ability to get there
and you must pray its in time
hi im here to see carly spenser

they say sentinel was the einstein of his civilization
so were going to keep these locked up
until we know what were dealing with
right now no one gets access
no one  this morning a guy recognized me
he told me to warn you
hes talking about the dark side of the moon
then they killed him  wait a minute you mentioned the moon

shes my girlfriend
what is this like a date
she knows all about the autobots okay
she knows bumblebee and comes from a military family
i can vouch for her
hey i have an idea
how bout we get back to the important topics
like the fact i almost had my face cut off by a decepticon
as a tax payer i can lodge a complaint as a matter of fact
okay listen
one of the software engineers at sams office was murdered today
he was involved in nasas lunar mapping probe
heres the thing colonel lennox
we cannot entrust national security to teenagers
unless i missed the policy paper
are we doing that now
no good
i dont care who you are
if you breathe a word of what youve seen here
you will do time for treason
do you understand me
ill take my orders from the autobots
i know them i dont know you
you will
sentinel prime
he seems to run on energon and hes out of it
hes in a sort of a sleep mode
let us begin
its the great matrix of leadership
he holds the only thing in the
universe that can repower a transformers spark
this is incredible
sentinel prime
we bid you return
revenge
no  hold your fire
no sentinel  hold your fire
it is i optimus prime
it is all right
you are safe
theres nothing to fear
we are here
you are home sentinel
the war
the war
the war was lost
cybertron is now but a barren wasteland
we have taken refuge here on planet earth
its human race is our allies
my ship
we came under fire
the pillars
where are the pillars
you saved five of them
including the control pillar
only five
we once had hundreds
excuse me gentlemen may i ask
what is this technology youre looking for
it is the ability to reshape the universe
together the pillars form a space bridge
i designed and i alone can control it
it defied your laws of physics
to transport matter through time and space
youre talking about a teleportation device arent you
yes for resources for refuges
refuges or troops of soldiers
weapons maybe bombs
a means of an instant strike
thats its military function isnt it
it is our technology
and it must be returned
yes if humans say so
you cant just bring weapons
of mass destruction into our atmosphere
kind of have to declare customs first
a little formality called paperwork
kinda separates us from the animals
i will overlook your condescending tone
if you heave the gravity of mine
the decepticons must never know the space bridge is here
for in their hands
it would mean the end of your world
totaly nightmare file
so the investigation is open
we sent agents to your office
and for the time being
were going to send you home with autobot protection
wh who do i need to speak to
to get you guys to understand i can help
i can contribute
hey we can all help you tell me what you know
i can tell you all the fun planets ive been
get off my desk please
aw you pulling out guns okay cant help you on that
oh my god
what do you envision for me i go back home now
i go back to work i make copies i mean
this is a unit for veteran
intelligence officers and special forces
not for boys who once owned special cars
thats a bit harsh isnt it maam
dont call me maam im not a maam
but youre a woman arent you
sooo
are those yours
yeah cia
i only ask because i also have a medal
from the president

no one gets to work with the autobots unless i approve it
youre breaking my chain of command
come on lets go
youve done what you can for them
with all due respect young man
i appreciate what you did

oh i believe it i tell ya sammy we feel the same way
the disrespect on this rock is criminal
we should do something about it
bee
i need to know why theyre killing humans
what say we call in the expert
my next guest is a former american intelligence operative
who has dared to speak out
regarding our alleged military alliance
with what many describe
as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries
he is the author of the best selling book codename hero
for our special agent seymour simmons
bill big fan great to be here
now agent simmons
you would have us believe that it is in our best centuries
to formally take sides in this so called alien civil war
well the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast so
i wouldnt exactly want to call it a toss up
these decepticons are lethal
but polls show half the world
would feel safer with the autobots completely gone
get them out of here
we dont need them here
i feel safer when i sleep with a hand grenade
it doesnt mean im always right
thank you heres a fact we obtained documents that show you were
fired by the intelligence committee  chuck im doing the interview

world war 2 is over
youre about to see one of the biggest soviet secrets
america first to send men to the moon
but ussr first to send camera
in 1959 our lunar 3
take picture of the dark the shadow side
sees nothing
but in 1963 lunar 4 sees   strange rocks
yeah  around the ship
hundreds of them
here show picture
with some drag marks
ive seen these these arent rocks
these are pillars
alien pillars for a space bridge
we know about them because the autobots have five of these
the decepticons must have
raided the ship before apollo 11 ever got there
took the pillars and hid them
well that doesnt make sense the decepticons have the ship
they have all those pillars
why would they leave several
of these if hes the only one that can use them
unless
hes the one thing they still need
we got to meet up with sentinel
rendezvous with him and keep him safe
mearing i just picked up sentinel optimus is 10 minutes behind
were coming in fast now
mr witwicky i thought i made it clear to you
that i did not want you calling this phone
listen the whole thing has been a set up since the beginning
decepticons wanted optimus to find sentinel
because only optimus could revive him
but we have the space bridge
mearing you have five pillars
i just learned that they have hundreds
youre doing exactly what they wanted you to do
what do i need to say to you
the decepticons are coming for sentinel prime
were going to nest

you gotta be kidding me  i
cant go into details now mom i have to find her
sam were having a family meeting
family meeting
you may not know this but your
father and i were not always this perfectly happy

he moved heaven and earth to find me
would he say what you said
say it
i would follow you to the end of time
does that suck or what  no
bad syfy dope
i want you guys to get as far away from here as you can
you understand
i love you
oh my master
such a brilliant scheme
so when sentinel left cybertron
it was to defect
he was meant to rendezvous with me here on earth
before fate waylaid us both
the only way to revive him
we needed prime and his matrix
excellent strategy
so he is now your partner master
he is my greatest triumph
so impressive
commencing transport
stop no no no sentinel
forgive me
here we are
fight us now
autobots retreat
why sentinel why
for cybertron
for our home
what war destroyed we can rebuild
but only if we join with the decepticons
no its not the only way
this is our home
we must defend the humans
so lost you are optimus
on cybertron we were gods
and here they call us machines
let the humans serve us
or perish
youre lucky i didnt kill you
in time youll see
its not over
and if i were him
i wouldnt let you out of my sight for one second
its funny i was just thinking on the way over here
i really could use some advice from dylan
and there he is can i speak to you  welcome
please sit down have a drink
you know what i dont need a drink
or a car or a job
i just need to speak to my girlfriend alone
is that okay with you mr inappropriate
excuse me
whats going on  ill tell you outside
i really think i can help you sam
i remember a talk i had with my dad once about tough choices
nows not the time ill set something up though
cause that was way back when my dads firm was in charge
of budget review and accounting for nasa
you see the thing that he taught me was
when its not your war
you join the side thats going to win
too direct or was it just me
certainly not you sir
youre mine
get help someone get help  sam i cant get out
goodnight  goodnight mr dylan
sam get me out of here
help
get help
hes young he will learn
get me out  goodnight
this was a fun night
you really think youre the
first man ever asked to join a noble alien cause
who are you
you know why weve not
been back to the moon since 1972
because these two
they came to my dad and
they told him to do some creative accounting
make it way to expensive to ever go back
so he and others shut
down the american and russian space programs
and theyve been our clients ever since
you helped to kill people
you think they give you a choice
besides its not like i personally participated
i am a liaison
i liaise
its hostile take over time sam
sam
let her go
sam
ive had my eye on you for years sam
youre the one spy ive never been
able to provide as the one close to the autobots
sam dont do what he wants
yes he will
they all do
you should be smarter you understand me
the time it takes you to blink
they will do it to her and they will do it to me
so you show a little respect
when someone offers you a job
wrist
you are to track down optimus prime
because youre the one human he trusts
you will ask one question
how does he intend to fight back
strategies tactics everything
has a nasty little bite doesnt it
its very high tech
it lets us see
what you see hear what you hear
and it attacks your nervous system
so if you so much as try and signal
i know what to tell you sam
relationships have consequences
i am here because my father
she is here because of you
stop stop stopstop
soundwave if you please
sam
do your job
shell be safe i give you my word
ill kill you
you have my word
combatant commands are now at defcon 1
approximately 200 decepticons are in hiding
energon detectors have been
triggered as far away as south america and china
the un just received an encrypted audio file
they say its from the leaders of the autobots
defenders of earth
we have come for your natural resources
to rebuild our damaged planet
when we have transported all we needed
we will leave your world in peace
for such peace to exist
you must immediately exile the autobot rebels you have harbored
non negotiable
renounce the rebels
we await your reply
well debrief you in transit
yeah i really dont see how i can be of any help
i mean you guys seem pretty busy
we can just do this another time i think
i have underestimated you at every turn
youhawhat
you warned us that they were using humans
and you knew that sentinel was the key
director
oh who am i hey youre the expert
im just a walking security risk
are you all right
yes
no youre not youre sweating  no im fine
im fine im sweating because im nervous
im nervous because you
got me in here for this information okay
im a twitter junkie i blog everything
i cant keep secrets
oh you wouldnt dare  thats the truth im telling you
you wouldnt dare
director i got a call for you at 15
what are you doing
nothing what are you doing
get away from me
its been a remarkable series of events today at the capitol
just moments ago legislation was
passed to exile the autobots from american shores
the us military alliance with them is officially over
the words of the house and the  yeah
authority leaders responds to todays resolution
what  we cannot in good conscious invite
they cant do this you gotta tell them they cant do that
okay its official its a go people
these are our allies
the autobots fought for us they fought with us
and where are we now
facing an enemy invasion
with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more
if theres more you know
anything at all about the enemies intentions
nows the time to tell
autobots have no way of leaving this planet
that is where youre wrong
its name is the xanthium
it bought the second wave of autobots
and its been under nasas care and study ever since
weve linked it with a decommissioned shuttle
to maintain military control until theyre gone
gonna be 10000 pounds of torque
on this cheaper cheep oh not my thing
you damage this delays all me mates
thats your wreckers
they take care of the xanthium
we dont let them off the base much
because theyre assholes
you gotta pull that you nancy wanker
its torqued to kill them
calm down
epps  you are ridiculous thats you
hello man
what are you doing here im retired from the air force
can you let my hand go
what the hell was that
i went on to just consult and run interference for them
no more combat
or alien shooting at my ass
i got a dream job
kicking the autobots out
do you believe this is happening
where do you think is taking them
any planet but here
i want to talk to whoevers in charge here
charlotte mearing
agent simmons
former agent simmons so
i see you survived washington
washington egypt heartbreak
i survived i will survive
theyre bringing everybody in kid
putting all the intel on the table
and if you think that putting 9 autobots
is going to solve a damn thing
its out of my hands
moving up in the world huh
your booty looks excellent
you ever say word to anyone
about what happened that night in quantico
ill cut your heart out
you already did
sammy listen to me
dont let them exile us
dont let them take us sam
its a decepticon trap
checked the nitrogen were booting out of here
optimus
what your leaders say is true
this was all my fault
i told them whom to trust
i was so wrong
it doesnt make your fault
it makes you human for a change
remember this
you may loose your faith in us
but never in yourselves
i need to know how youre going to fight back
i know theres a strategy
i know youre coming back with reinforcements
something i know theres a plan
you can tell me no other human will ever know
there is no plan
we just do what they want
how are we going to live with ourselves
you are my friend sam
you always will be
but your leaders have spoken
from here
the fight will be your own
make it short
were loading up
all right hustle up
when we do whatever we can
make it like it was
you will always be my friend
sam
i gotta be going on
years from now theyre gonna ask us
where were you when they took over the planet
were gonna say
we just stood by and watched
you should really look at this as a partnership
you have to stand on the side of progress
if you want to be a part of history
go launch in5432
1zero
the word is you got it
i always get what i want sam
we just needed to be sure
sure of what
that they would go without a fight
say again  detecting a foreign object
we all work for the decepticons now
i need your help to track a phone call
its a man on this phone hes the head of the human operation
and hes holding carly hostage
sit down dont move
im watching him drive up right now
the call was placed inroute
im hacking into the phones camera right now
there that is thats a live stream from the camera
someplace hold on i can triangulate this
okay its chicago cell site
there i got it
trump tower chicago lower penthouse
were on
im going  youre sure
she is out there without any help
i can be there in 15 hours
youre not going alone
still got my nest friends out there
well round them up
find your girlfriend and bring this guy in
why are you helping me
cause that asshole killed my friends too
they said they were here for our resources
to rebuild their planet
yes really one resource in particular
one unique to our planet
us
youre very smart
you see they cant rebuild without a slave labor force
how many rocks up there in the universe offer 6 billion workers
what are you talking about
we cant transport people
theyre not shipping people
theyre shipping their planet here
oh my god
whats sentinel doing here
watch
theyre spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now
in just a few hours
theyre going to launch them into orbit
and bring cybertron into our atmosphere
the red one there controls the rest
he triggers that it starts the whole thing
be gone insect operative your work is done
your excellency
youre such a dick
you want this to happen
i want to survive i want 40 more years
you think i asked for this
i inherited a client
yeah and when cybertrons here and were all their slaves
i guess theyll still need a human leader
get this straight you want to survive you listen to me
it is time for the slaves of earth
to recognize their masters
seal off the city
get the dogs out of here now get them in the back
i guess they didnt tell you about this part did they
you think im at every meeting
they promised im safe
they said im safe
lets roll
dont have a signal reading
its not working
move back
theres a ring of alien ships around chicago
our high range bombers were just knocked out of the sky
they cant get through enemy air defenses over the city
our satellites have been jammed
we have no way to monitor the enemies movement
all nest teams are on stand down
only have troops at air force base move out
10 minutes from the battle zone
we have special forces trying to gain access to the city
an infantry is staging at the perimeter
excuse me excuse me it just doesnt make sense
cant we get any eyes in there at all
they keep shooting down our drones
they want us blind
but we do have a couple of minidrones were gonna try
well if we can man these uav drones
can we try to redirect them toward trump tower
the kid witwicky was on his way to chicago
set some point man human ops there
before the decepticons
listen if i know anything i know this
that kid is an alien bad news magnet
my god
we came here to find her in the middle of all that
are we really going out there epps
im not going in there
no ones going in
i am
with or without you ill find her
youre gonna get yourself killed sam
is that what you want
is that what you want
you came all the way out here to get yourself killed
huh listento me what im saying
shes here because of me do you understand
listen if you go in this building
thats if shes even still alive
theres no way youre going to be able to even reach her
well what would you suggest i do
its over
im sorry but its over
no
woah incoming
we will kill them all
wreckers kill him
this is going to hurt a lot
your leaders will now understand
decepticons will never leave your planet alone
and we needed them to believe we had gone
for today in the name of freedom
we take the battle to them
i saw your ship blow up
the ship we were never in the ship
we designed the damn thing didnt we
we were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate
splashed down back in the atlantic just as planned
we aint going no where
yeah no ones exiling us
the autobots are just staying right here
were going to help you win this war
theyre surrounding the city to make a fortress
so that no one can see what theyre up to inside
our only chance is the element of surprise
i think i know where to look
minidrones on approach trump tower
youre telling me sams headed into that
poor kid
probably never got close
your gonna fly this thing right
what does what is that what is that
so so
so you so so can fly
that feels terrible
were right behind you
all right
were going in
the citys secure
the humans cannot stop us
as the afternoon falls
the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position
this is the victory i promised you so many years ago
where we rebuild cybertron
together
i have gained to work with you that my planet may survive
i will never work for you
and you would be wise to remember the difference
oh im so sick of this im sick of waiting

days when our allies turn against us
but the day will never come
that we forsake this planet
and its people
