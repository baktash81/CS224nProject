senator  i suggest you remember that when the nasa
   wants funding they call me 
when the cia is going to take out a target 
they ask first for my permission 
when the president wants to know
which members of congress are politically vulnerable 
in terms of oh  let s say undiscovered criminal conduct 
i m on their memory dials 
usa agency say they have been monitoring the blast 
but in fact this was a covert military strike 
no nation has yet claimed ownership 
the cia is up my ass about this mystery   
  raid in the middle east 
so it s time to come clean  was the unit involved 
uh  i m not sure  ma am 
all right guys  this is how you do a decepticon   
   head kill shot 
as director of national intelligence 
i m a really big fan of intelligent answers 
i   i can t really tell you definitively 
these autobots are like teenage kids 
they like to sneak out of the house once in a while 
colonel lennox  are you in command or are you not

oh  good they re here 
my name s que  i do hope you have answers for him 
i ve never seen him so upset 
optimus  you remember charlotte mearing 
our director of national intelligence 
he s in a bad mood 
he s a not want to talk a to anybody today 
what is this 
the silent treatment 
we ve seen that  and this is not that 
  definitely not    this is worse 
prime  make something of yourself 
he s pissed 
you lied to us 
everything humans  know of our planet
we were told had all been shared 
so why was this found in human possession 
we were in the dark on this also 
it was director only clearance at sector 7  until now 
  the bag    which bag 
hermes birkin  green ostrich 
oh my god 
this is a secret few men knew 
and fewer still remain alive 
allow me to please introduce to you 
two of nasa s founding mission directors 
and astronaut  dr  buzz aldrin 
one of the first two men to step foot on the moon  sir 
optimus prime 
from a fellow space traveler 
it s a true honor 
the honor is mine 
our entire space race of the 1960 s   
   it appears was in response to an event 
our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship 
no survivors on board 
we were sworn to secrecy by our commander in chief 
this was a mission you will never speak of 
i understand  sir 
a total of 35 people knew the real plan at nasa 
soviets managed to land unmanned probes 
somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod 
we believe the russians deduced
that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly 
believed they had it mastered and harnessed it at chernobyl 
we went on six missions in all 
we took hundreds of photos and samples 
we locked them away forever 
and the moon program was shut down 
where did you search the crash hold 
the ships name was the ark 
i watched it escape cybertron myself 
it was carrying an autobot
technology which would have won us the war 
and its captain 
  who was this captain    the great sentinel prime 
the technology s inventor 
he was commander of the autobots 
before me 
it s imperative that i find it
before the decepticons learn of its location 
our autobot space craft has the ability to get there 
and  you must pray it s in time 
hi  i m here to see carly spenser

those are my brass knuckles 
that s my anklet  do i have to take that off too 
and my toe rings 
all the unofficials clear the floor 
we have ten minutes until attempted contact 
we ve taken possession of
the five devices that were hidden in the ship of sentinel prime 
they re some kind of prototype autobot technology 
they say sentinel was the einstein of his civilization 
so we re going to keep these locked up 
    until we know what we re dealing with 
right now no one gets access 
  no one    this morning a guy recognized me 
he told me to warn you 
he s talking about the dark side of the moon 
  then they killed him    wait a minute  you mentioned the moon 
yeah  dark side of the moon 
but why would the decepticons want to kill humans 
i thought their war was with the autobots 
and that is when he made his first quick list of time report 
that s what i want  
who s the chick  okay 
excuse me  colonel lennox 
director mearing 
this is sam witwicky 
  a civilian c     i know his name  colonel 
i want to know who gave him clearance 
who gave me clearance  how about optimus prime 
when he touched down in suburbia looking for my house 
this is the national intelligence director 
in case you   
  hi    disrespecting a federal officer 
that ought to get you somewhere  who s she 
she s my girlfriend 
what is this like a date 
she knows all about the autobots  okay 
she knows bumblebee  and comes from a military family 
i can vouch for her 
hey  i have an idea 
how bout we get back to the important topics 
like the fact i almost had my face cut off by a decepticon 
as a tax payer i can lodge a complaint as a matter of fact 
okay  listen 
one of the software engineers at sam s office was murdered today 
he was involved in nasa s lunar mapping probe 
here s the thing  colonel lennox 
we cannot entrust national security to teenagers 
unless i missed the policy paper 
are we doing that now 
no  good 
i don t care who you are 
if you breathe a word of what you ve seen here 
you will do time for treason 
do you understand me 
i ll take my orders from the autobots 
i know them  i don t know you 
you will 
sentinel prime 
he seems to run on energon  and he s out of it 
he s in a sort of a sleep mode 
let us begin 
it s the great matrix of leadership 
he holds the only thing in the
universe that can repower a transformers spark 
this is incredible 
sentinel prime 
we bid you return 
revenge 
  no    hold your fire 
  no  sentinel    hold your fire 
it is i  optimus prime 
it is all right 
you are safe 
there s nothing to fear 
we are here 
you are home  sentinel 
the war 
the war 
the war was lost 
cybertron is now but a barren wasteland 
we have taken refuge here on planet earth 
its human race is our allies 
my ship 
we came under fire 
the pillars 
where are the pillars 
you saved five of them 
including the control pillar 
only five 
we once had hundreds 
excuse me  gentlemen  may i ask 
what is this technology you re looking for 
it is the ability to reshape the universe 
together the pillars form a space bridge 
i designed and i alone can control it 
it defied your laws of physics
to transport matter through time and space 
you re talking about a teleportation device  aren t you 
yes  for resources  for refuges 
refuges or troops of soldiers 
weapons  maybe bombs 
a means of an instant strike 
that s its military function  isn t it 
it is our technology 
and it must be returned 
yes  if humans say so 
you can t just bring weapons
of mass destruction into our atmosphere 
kind of have to declare customs first 
a little formality called paperwork 
kinda separates us from the animals 
i will overlook your condescending tone
if you heave the gravity of mine 
the decepticons must never know the space bridge is here 
for in their hands   
    it would mean the end of your world 
totaly nightmare file 
so the investigation is open 
we sent agents to your office 
and for the time being 
we re going to send you home with autobot protection 
wh   who do i need to speak to 
to get you guys to understand i can help 
i can contribute 
hey  we can all help  you tell me what you know 
i can tell you all the fun planets i ve been 
get off my desk  please 
aw  you pulling out guns  okay  can t help you on that 
oh  my god 
what do you envision for me  i go back home now 
i go back to work  i make copies  i mean   
this is a unit for veteran
intelligence officers and special forces 
not for boys who once owned special cars 
that s a bit harsh  isn t it ma am 
don t call me ma am  i m not a ma am 
but you re a woman  aren t you 
sooo 
are those yours 
yeah  cia 
i only ask because i also have a medal 
from the president 
yeah 
great  so it s not that complicated  right 
no one gets to work with the autobots unless i approve it 
you re breaking my chain of command 
come on  let s go 
you ve done what you can for them 
with all due respect  young man 
i appreciate what you did 
but you re not a soldier 
you re a messenger  you ve always been a messenger 
he s a hero 
bee  you take the freight elevator  i ll see you up there 
ah  this blows 
  that lady officially kicked us out    yeah 
witness protection program sucks 
yeah  but we re a whole
lot safer with big yellow and his cannons 
that dog can t protect crap 
bee 
you couldn t sleep 
yeah  me too 
i don t believe she called me a messenger 
do you believe that  after everything i ve done  i m a messenger 
oh  i believe it  i tell ya  sammy  we feel the same way 
the disrespect on this rock is criminal 
we should do something about it 
bee 
i need to know why they re killing humans 
what say we call in the expert 
my next guest  is a former american intelligence operative
who has dared to speak out
regarding our alleged military alliance 
    with what many describe
as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries 
he is the author of the best selling book   code name hero  
for our special agent  seymour simmons 
bill  big fan  great to be here 
now  agent simmons 
you would have us believe that it is in our best centuries
to formally take sides in this so called alien civil war 
well  the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast  so 
i wouldn t exactly want to call it a toss up 
these decepticons are lethal 
but polls show half the world
would feel safer with the autobots completely gone 
get them out of here 
we don t need them here 
i feel safer when i sleep with a hand grenade 
it doesn t mean i m always right 
thank you  here s a fact  we obtained documents that show you were
  fired by the intelligence committee    chuck  i m doing the interview 
down sized  bill  budget cuts

    future tech  assassinations  that kind of stuff 
oh  apollo 
dutch

unlike the final days of cybertron 
i ve wondered what might have been 
if you had fought the final battle 
instead of me 
never morn the past  young warrior 
thanks to you  our race survives 
you were our leader  sentinel 
it is your right to lead us again 
in a world i do not know

  quick    very 
here s their reconnaissance order 
it say s nasa launched in 2009 
see  forensics show wang may have messed with the code
preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon
which is also the dark side 
freaking awesome 
they pay for trade us  intimidate us 
    coerce us to do their dirty work 
and once they re done 
dushhhh 
the double tap cerebellum 
so he was working for the decepticons 
i don t think this is about the decepticons 
looking for something on the moon

world war 2 is over 
you re about to see one of the biggest soviet secrets 
america first to send men to the moon 
but u s s r  first to send camera 
in 1959 our lunar 3 
take picture of the dark  the shadow side 
see s nothing 
  but in 1963 lunar 4 sees         strange rocks 
  yeah    around the ship 
hundreds of them 
here  show picture 
with some  drag marks 
i ve seen these  these aren t rocks 
these are pillars 
alien pillars for a space bridge 
we know about them because the autobots have five of these 
the decepticons must have
raided the ship before apollo 11 ever got there 
took the pillars and hid them 
well that doesn t make sense  the decepticons have the ship 
they have all those pillars 
why would they leave several   
    of these if he s the only one that can use them 
unless   
he s the one thing they still need 
we got to meet up with sentinel 
rendezvous with him  and keep him safe 
mearing  i just picked up sentinel  optimus is 10 minutes behind 
we re coming in fast  now 
mr  witwicky i thought i made it clear to you 
that i did not want you calling this phone 
listen  the whole thing has been a set up since the beginning 
decepticons wanted optimus to find sentinel 
because only optimus could revive him 
but we have the space bridge 
mearing  you have five pillars 
i just learned that they have hundreds 
you re doing exactly what they wanted you to do 
what do i need to say to you 
the decepticons are coming for sentinel prime

i would follow you to the end of time 
  does that suck or what    no 
bad syfy dope 
i want you guys to get as far away from here as you can 
you understand 
i love you 
oh  my master 
such a brilliant scheme 
so  when sentinel left cybertron 
   it was to defect 
he was meant to rendezvous with me here on earth 
before fate waylaid us both 
the only way to revive him 
   we needed prime and his matrix 
excellent strategy 
so he is now your partner  master 
he is my greatest triumph 
so impressive 
commencing transport 
stop  no  no  no sentinel 
forgive me 
here we are 
fight us now 
autobots  retreat 
why sentinel  why 
for cybertron 
for our home 
what war destroyed  we can rebuild 
but only if we join with the decepticons 
no  it s not the only way 
this is our home 
we must defend the humans 
so lost you are  optimus 
on cybertron we were gods 
and here they call us machines 
let the humans serve us 
or perish 
you re lucky i didn t kill you 
in time  you ll see 
it s not over 
and if i were him 
   i wouldn t let you out of my sight for one second 
it s funny i was just thinking on the way over here 
i really could use some advice from dylan 
  and there he is  can i speak to you    welcome 
please sit down  have a drink 
you know what  i don t need a drink 
or a car  or a job 
i just need to speak to my girlfriend alone 
is that okay with you  mr  inappropriate 
excuse me 
  what s going on    i ll tell you outside 
i really think i can help you  sam 
i remember a talk i had with my dad once  about tough choices 
now s not the time  i ll set something up  though 
 cause that was way back when my dad s firm was in charge
of budget review and accounting for nasa 
you see the thing that he taught me was   
when it s not your war 
you join the side that s going to win 
too direct  or was it just me 
certainly not you  sir 
you re mine 
  get help  someone get help    sam  i can t get out 
  goodnight   goodnight mr  dylan 
sam  get me out of here 
help 
get help 
he s young  he will learn 
  get me out    goodnight 
this was a fun night 
you really think you re the
first man ever asked to join a noble alien cause 
who are you 
you know why we ve not
been back to the moon since 1972 
because these two 
they came to my dad and
they told him to do some creative accounting 
make it way to expensive to ever go back 
so he and others  shut
down the american and russian space programs 
and they ve been our clients ever since 
you helped to kill people 
you think they give you a choice 
besides  it s not like i personally participated 
i am a liaison 
i liaise 
it s hostile take over time  sam 
sam 
let her go 
sam 
i ve had my eye on you for years  sam 
you re the one spy i ve never been
able to provide as the one close to the autobots 
sam  don t do what he wants 
yes he will 
they all do 
you should be smarter  you understand me 
the time it takes you to blink 
they will do it to her  and they will do it to me 
so you show a little respect 
when someone offers you a job 
wrist 
you are to track down  optimus prime 
because you re the one human he trusts 
you will ask one question 
how does he intend to fight back 
strategies  tactics  everything 
has a nasty little bite  doesn t it 
it s very high tech 
it lets us see
what you see  hear what you hear 
and it attacks your nervous system 
so if you so much as try and signal 
i know what to tell you  sam 
relationships have consequences 
i am here because my father 
she is here because of you 
stop  stop  stop   stop 
soundwave  if you please 
sam 
do your job 
she ll be safe  i give you my word 
i ll kill you 
you have my word 
combatant commands are now at defcon 1 
approximately 200 decepticons are in hiding 
energon detectors have been
triggered as far away as south america and china 
the u n  just received an encrypted audio file 
they say it s from the leaders of the autobots 
defenders of earth 
we have come for your natural resources 
to rebuild our damaged planet 
when we have transported all we needed 
we will leave your world in peace 
for such peace to exist 
you must immediately exile the autobot rebels you have harbored 
non negotiable 
renounce the rebels 
we await your reply 
we ll debrief you in transit 
yeah i really don t see how i can be of any help 
i mean you guys seem pretty busy 
we can just do this another time  i think 
i have underestimated you at every turn 
you  ha   what 
you warned us that they were using humans

director i got a call for you at 15 
what are you doing 
nothing  what are you doing 
get away from me 
it s been a remarkable series of events today at the capitol 
just moments ago legislation was
passed to exile the autobots from american shores 
the u s  military alliance with them is officially over 
  the words of the house and the      yeah 
  authority leaders responds to today s resolution 
  what    we cannot in good conscious invite   
they can t do this  you gotta tell them they can t do that 
okay  it s official  it s a go people 
these are our allies 
the autobot s fought for us  they fought with us 
and where are we now 
facing an enemy invasion 
with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more 
if there s more you know 
anything at all about the enemies intentions 
now s the time to tell 
autobots have no way of leaving this planet 
that is where you re wrong 
its name is the xanthium 
it bought the second wave of autobots 
and it s been under nasa s care and study ever since 
we ve linked it with a decommissioned shuttle 
to maintain military control until they re gone 
gonna be 10 000 pounds of torque
on this cheaper cheep    oh  not my thing 
you damage this delays all me mates 
that s your wreckers 
they take care of the xanthium 
we don t let them off the base much 
because they re assholes 
you gotta pull that you nancy wanker 
it s torqued to kill them 
calm down 
  epps    you are ridiculous  that s you 
hello  man 
 what are you doing here  i m retired from the air force 
can you let my hand go 
what the hell was that 
i went on to just consult and run interference for them 
no more combat
or alien shooting at my ass 
i got a dream job 
kicking the autobots out 
do you believe this is happening 
where do you think is taking them 
any planet but here 
i want to talk to whoever s in charge here 
charlotte mearing 
agent simmons
former agent simmons  so 
i see you survived washington 
washington  egypt  heartbreak 
i survived  i will survive 
they re bringing everybody in  kid 
putting all the intel on the table 
and if you think that putting 9 autobots 
is going to solve a damn thing   
it s out of my hands 
moving up in the world  huh 
your booty looks excellent 
you ever say word to anyone
about what happened that night in quantico 
i ll cut your heart out 
you already did 
sammy  listen to me 
don t let them exile us 
don t let them take us  sam 
it s a decepticon trap 
checked the nitrogen  we re booting out of here 
optimus 
what your leaders say is true 
this was all my fault 
i told them whom to trust 
i was so wrong 
it doesn t make your fault 
it makes you human for a change 
remember this 
you may loose your faith in us 
but never in yourselves 
i need to know how you re going to fight back 
i know there s a strategy 
i know you re coming back with reinforcements 
something  i know there s a plan 
you can tell me  no other human will ever know 
there is no plan 
we just do what they want 
how are we going to live with ourselves 
you are my friend  sam 
you always will be 
but your leaders have spoken 
from here 
the fight will be your own 
make it short 
we re loading up 
all right  hustle up 
when we do whatever we can 
make it like it was 
you will always be  my friend 
sam 
i gotta be going on 
years from now  they re gonna ask us 
where were you when they took over the planet 
we re gonna say 
we just stood by and watched 
you should really look at this as a partnership 
you have to stand on the side of progress
if you want to be a part of history 
go launch in  5   4   3  2
1   zero 
the word is  you got it 
i always get what i want  sam 
we just needed to be sure 
sure of what 
that they would go without a fight 
  say again    detecting a foreign object 
we all work for the decepticons now 
i need your help to track a phone call 
it s a man on this phone  he s the head of the human operation 
and he s holding carly hostage 
sit down  don t move 
i m watching him drive up right now 
the call was placed in route 
i m hacking into the phone s camera right now 
there that is  that s a live stream from the camera 
someplace  hold on i can triangulate this 
okay  it s chicago cell site 
there  i got it 
trump tower  chicago  lower penthouse 
we re on 
  i m going    you re sure 
she is out there without any help
i can be there in 15 hours 
you re not going alone 
still got my nest friends out there 
we ll round them up 
find your girlfriend and bring this guy in 
why are you helping me 
 cause that asshole killed my friends  too 
they said they were here for our resources 
to rebuild their planet 
yes  really one resource in particular 
one unique to our planet 
us 
you re very smart 
you see they can t rebuild without a slave labor force 
how many rocks up there in the universe offer 6 billion workers 
what are you talking about 
we can t transport people 
they re not shipping people 
they re shipping their planet here 
oh  my god 
what s sentinel doing here 
watch 
they re spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now 
in just a few hours 
they re going to launch them into orbit 
and bring cybertron into our atmosphere 
the red one there  controls the rest 
he triggers that  it starts the whole thing 
be gone insect operative  your work is done 
your excellency 
you re such a dick 
you want this to happen 
i want to survive  i want 40 more years 
you think i asked for this 
i inherited a client 
yeah  and when cybertron s here and we re all their slaves
i guess they ll still need a human leader 
get this straight  you want to survive you listen to me 
it is time for the slaves of earth
to recognize their masters 
seal off the city 
get the dogs out of here now  get them in the back 
i guess they didn t tell you about this part  did they 
you think i m at every meeting 
they promised i m safe 
they said i m safe 
let s roll 
don t have a signal reading 
it s not working 
move back 
there s a ring of alien ships around chicago 
our high range bombers were just knocked out of the sky 
they can t get through enemy air defenses over the city 
our satellites have been jammed 
we have no way to monitor the enemies movement 
all nest teams are on stand down 
only have troops at air force base  move out 
10 minutes from the battle zone 
we have special forces trying to gain access to the city 
an infantry is staging at the perimeter 
excuse me  excuse me  it just doesn t make sense 
can t we get any eyes in there at all 
they keep shooting down our drones 
they want us blind 
but we do have a couple of mini drones we re gonna try 
well if we can man these uav drones 
   can we try to redirect them toward  trump tower 
the kid  witwicky was on his way to chicago 
set some point man human ops there 
before the decepticons 
listen  if i know anything  i know this 
that kid is an alien bad news magnet 
my god 
we came here to find her in the middle of all that 
are we really going out there  epps 
i m not going in there 
no one s going in 
i am 
with or without you  i ll find her 
you re gonna get yourself killed  sam 
is that what you want 
is that what you want 
you came all the way out here to get yourself killed 
huh  listen   to me what i m saying 
she s here because of me  do you understand 
listen  if you go in this building 
that s if she s even still alive 
there s no way you re going to be able to even reach her 
well what would you suggest i do 
it s over 
i m sorry  but it s over 
no 
woah  incoming 
we will kill them all 
wreckers  kill him 
this is going to hurt a lot 
your leaders will now understand 
decepticons will never leave your planet alone 
and we needed them to believe we had gone 
for today  in the name of freedom 
we take the battle to them 
i saw your ship blow up 
the ship  we were never in the ship 
we designed the damn thing  didn t we 
we were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate 
splashed down back in the atlantic  just as planned 
we ain t going no where 
yeah  no ones exiling us 
the autobots are just staying right here 
we re going to help you win this war 
they re surrounding the city to make a fortress 
so that no one can see what they re up to inside 
our only chance is the element of surprise 
i think i know where to look 
mini drones on approach  trump tower 
you re telling me  sam s headed into that 
poor kid 
probably never got close 
your gonna fly this thing  right 
what does  what is that  what is that 
so  so 
so you so  so can fly 
that feels terrible 
we re right behind you 
all right 
we re going in 
the city s secure 
the humans cannot stop us 
as the afternoon falls 
the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position 
this is the victory i promised you so many years ago
where we rebuild cybertron 
together 
i have gained to work with you that my planet may survive 
i will never work for you 
and you would be wise to remember the difference
