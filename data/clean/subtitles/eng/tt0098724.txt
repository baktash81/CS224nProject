man
what kind of thoughts about garbage
i just ive gotten real concerned over
whats gonna happen with all the garbage
i mean weve got so much of it
you know i mean we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually
the last time i started feelin this way
is when that barge was stranded
and you know it was goin around
the island and nobody would claim it
do you remember that
yes i remember
do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern
yeah yeah
you see the other night
john was taking out the garbage
and he kept spilling things
out of the container
and that made me
i started imagining like
a garbage can that produces garbage
and it doesnt stop it keeps producing
garbage and it keeps overflowing
and you know what would you do
to try to stop something like that
ann do you see any pattern here
what do you mean
well last week we were talking about
your obsession with
the families of airline fatalities
now were talking about your
concern over the garbage problem
yeah so
well if you think about it i think
youll see the object of your obsession
is invariably something negative
which you have no control over
yeah but how many people do you think
run around obsessing over
how great and how happy things are
you know i mean maybe they do
but i dont think theyre in therapy
anyway bein happy isnt all that great
i mean the last time
i was really happy i got so fat
i mustve put on 25 pounds
i thought john was gonna have a stroke
so what are you worried about
what am i looking at here
is this a mistake
depends on your point of view
i dont think so in fact
im gonna tell you a little secret
as soon as you get a ring on your finger
you start getting spectacular attention
from the opposite gender
thats bullshit
seriously i wish i had
super bowl seats for every time
some filly had come up and talked to me
without the slightest provocation
its just marvellous
that happened before you got married
no no no
it never happened before i got married
if id known id have bought a ring
when i was 18 and saved myself
laughs yeah right
a lot of time and money
no i wish somebodyd clued me in
im tellin you
its too weird
oh shit i gotta be someplace
so racquetball thursday right
how about 730
yeah fine see you later bye
byebye
woman yes sir
janet
reschedule kirkland for uh friday 130
yes sir
all right
therapist are you still
keeping these thoughts from john
ann yeah
are you afraid of his finding you silly
at thinking these things
no its not that its just
im really angry at him right now
why
he invited this college friend of his to
stay at our house and didnt even ask me
im gonna say yes of course but
you know it just wouldve
been nice to have been asked
what upsets you about that
i guess it makes me angry
because i cant justify bein angry
its his house he pays the mortgage
yes but he asked you to quit your job
and you do have housework
yeah i have housework thats true
this unexpected guest notwithstanding
how are things with john
oh theyre fine
ex cept for im going through this thing
where i dont want him to touch me but
when did you begin having this feeling
well last week
i dont know i just i got this
really strange feelin and ugh
just didnt want him to touch me
prior to this feeling were you
comfortable with contact with john
oh yeah sure yeah
ex cept for well
ive never really been that much into sex
i mean i like it and everything but
you know i just dont think
its such a big deal and
i wouldnt miss it you know kinda thing
but lately ive just been kinda curious
about how things have slacked off
perhaps he senses
your hesitance at being touched
but thats the weird thing
because he started not touching me
before i started feelin like that
ah
i mean im sure he probably wishes
that i would initiate things once in a while
and i would ex cept for
it just never occurs to me and
well the few times
i have felt like it i was by myself
did you do anything
what do you mean
did you masturbate
oh
oh oh
god no
no mmmm
i take it from your response
that you never masturbate
well i tried once
it just seems so stupid
i dont know it just seemed like
a dumb thing to do and
god and then i started worrying that my
dead grandfather was watching me and
sighs
it seemed so stupid especially when you
dont know what to do with the garbage
oh so it was recently
when you tried this
oh well it was kind of recently
but not real recently
i am just not up to
havin a guest in the house
i gotta go i gotta go to the office
i gotta get back to the office
i only get one today gee how ex citing
i already skipped one meeting
i gotta get back
look john if you wanna leave leave
my life doesnt revolve around these
little gettogethers dont flatter yourself
dont feel like you gotta treat me with
kid gloves tell me how you really feel
listen i got a friend comin into town
an old friend i havent seen in years
from what i can tell
i think hes a little lost
i think i may have
to spend a little time with him
mmhm
meaning well have to cool it for a while
yeah
yeah
i wish youd quit
that bartending job of yours
why
i hate the thought
of all those guys hittin on you
laughs i can handle it
im sure
besides the money is good
and some of the guys are cute
and you are in no position to be jealous
who said i was jealous
i did
you know id like to do it
at your house sometime
i must admit the idea of doin it in my
sisters bed gives me a perverse thrill
i wish i could just come right out
and tell everyone anns a lousy lay
the beautiful the popular
ann bishop millaney
could be risky
how about i just start a rumour then
no no i mean doin it at my house
afraid of gettin caught
yeah
you should be
can i meet this friend of yours
who graham
i gotta tell you we were very close
many years ago but i
i think were very different now
doorbell
yes
ann uh my name is graham dalton
oh yeah sure
may i use your bathroom
uhhuh come on in
where is it
oh back there to the left im sorry
do you like strawberries
i brought you some
thank you thats real sweet
hi um john millaney please
this is his wife
thats all right thank you
well
that was quick
false alarm
have a seat
im sorry we dont let people
smoke in the house
but if youd like to we could go outside
oh no no no no no no no i
i can wait im
do you have any other things
yes
oh you mean to bring in no
i do have some other things but i dont
this is all i need to stay here
have you ever been on television
television no no
why
i was just curious
graham thats an unusual name
yeah yeah l uh i guess it is
my mother is a complete anglophile
anything british
makes her drool like a baby
so she you know i think she heard
the name in a movie or something
shes a prisoner of public television now
how do you like being married
i like it just fine
what about it do you like i
i dont mean to be critical im curious
no no no no thats ok uh
well you know the cliche
about the security of it
well thats true
and um we own this house
its a nice house and
john was just made junior partner
and i really like that
you know i like the fact that hes just not
you know freelance or whatever
yes
so how long has it been
since youve seen john
nine years
nine years
yeah i was surprised he invited me
to stay here until i found a place
didnt you know him very well
oh no i knew him very well
john and i
were very much alike
really
thats kinda hard to believe
i mean you just seem so different now
yeah well i would imagine
we are pretty different now
im ready to use the bathroom finally
ok
graham i gotta tell you i almost
called the cops when i saw you today
i thought to myself
this couldnt possibly be the same guy
that once held private services in
the back of the chapel on a weekly basis
you did that
everybody has a past thats mine so
so whats with the getup
somebody die or
ann john
im sorry did im sorry
no no no
nobody died
so
i mean
what do you think the greeksd
think of this rather sombre attire
i dont know
dinner was very good
yeah it wasnt bad honey
usually ann achieves a kinda critical
mass with the salt but uh tonight was
i always tell her you can always
add more but you cant take it away
yeah you say that dont you
so do you have family here
mm
mother father my sister
sister older or younger
younger
are you close
im sorry im im prying again im sorry
were you prying before
i was grilling ann about your marriage
howd it go
well i very well uh
so i was asking about your sister
yeah well
we get along all right its just that uh
well i think shes an extrovert
i just think shes loud
she probably wouldnt agree
no i mean definitely wouldnt agree
so listen are you gonna
see elizabeth while youre here
uh i dont know
whos elizabeth
a girl graham dated in school
well after the chapel episodes
she still lives here
to the best of my knowledge
so graham and i
were talking about apartments
and i told him that theyve got lovely
little apartments in the garden district
and they got nice garage apartments
theres critical crime in that district
oh john come on that is not true
no there are
i dont know what kind of place youre
lookin for theres plenty of apartments
in any one place
im sorry
no i just right now i have one key
you know everything i own is in the car
i like that
if i get an apartment thats two keys
if i get a job you know i might have
to open or close thats more keys
i buy some stuff im afraid its gonna
get ripped off and i get more keys
i just like having the one key its clean
you dont have to worry about losin em
get rid of the car when you get
the apartment still one key
i like having the car you know
the cars important you gotta be mobile
in case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry
yeah or go someplace in a hurry
ex cuse me
do you want some help
no no really im fine
theres not that much to do
graham do you pay taxes
yeah i pay taxes
yeah i pay taxes what do you mean
you dont pay taxes youre a liar
im not a liar
liars are the secondlowest form
of human being on the planet
ann whats the first
lawyers
oh thats you honey
annie why dont you go with graham
to hunt for apartments
show him how the citys changed
would you mind graham
no id love that
id like that too lets do that
all right how about tomorrow

john great idea
phone rings

as you can see
theres plenty of room for two
no itll just be me
are you a student
no
you can hang
a shower curtain in the bath
make sure you put somethin
in the tub so you wont fall
you said about 350
yeah and uh plus
the first and the last months rent

not for 350
how about 400
i could live with that i could live with that
ok its a deal
all right
ready
yeah
john
in here
well aint you a picture
well do you like it
its lovely is it for me
yeah its for you
is that for me
yeah thats for you
youre amazing dear
ann can i tell you something personal
its up to you
can i tell you something personal
yeah yeah
well you gotta go first
ok
i think that um
i think that sex is overrated
i think that people place
far too much importance on it
and i think that stuff about women
wantin it just as bad as men is crap
i think they want it i just dont think they
want it for the reason men think they do
im getting confused
do you understand what im
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah i remember reading somewhere
that men learn to love
the person that theyre attracted to
and that women become more and more
attracted to the person that they love
god thats thats beautiful
thats really beautiful i like that
oh im just quoting
so are you gonna
tell me something personal
do you want me to
yeah yeah i do
i dont want it to be
something gross about some scar
i want it to be something
really personal about yourself
all right ok
im impotent
youre what
lmpotent
clears throat you are
yeah i mean like well i cant
i cant get an erection
in the presence of another person
so for all practical purposes
im impotent
does that bother you
no
does it make you feel selfconscious
not usually
no uh
yeah im selfconscious
not in the same way
that you are though
me me you think im selfconscious
well
i been watching you i watch you eat
you know i watch you speak
watch you move and i see somebody
who is extremely aware
of people looking at you
my therapist
youre in therapy
arent you
no i no im not
i was a miserable failure in therapy
so you dont believe in therapy
no i believe in it for some people
i dont know it was
you know silly for me
i was confused going in
so i just formed my own theory
that you should never take advice
from someone
that doesnt know you intimately
well i know my therapist intimately
youve had sex with your therapist
no
no no
oh no im sorry thats what i meant
somebody youve had sex with
oh
im i dont understand
i mean how would you know
i mean you know how
oh no i wasnt always impotent
oh oh ok
so let me see you said um
you said that i should never take advice
from someone that
i havent had sex with right
basically
right
and uh we havent had sex
right
no
so i guess from your own advice
i shouldnt take your advice
i wouldnt
you wouldnt ok
ann all right
drive safely
yeah right
therapist how was your weekend
ann it was ok
did you confront john about the visitor
the visitor
the friend of johns
that was staying at your house
graham
graham
yeah i mean no
that actually
turned out to be interesting
you know i was expecting him
to be just like john
you know cos they went
to school together and everything
you know talking about getting drunk
together and secret handshakes and
he turned out to be
really this character
hes kind of arty
but ok
is he still at your house
no no no hes gone
so wheres he from
i dont know he uh used to live
in new york and philadelphia
i think he just kinda travels around
must be nice
so whats he like is he like john
no i dont think john likes him any more
says he thinks hes gotten kinda strange
is he strange i mean
no i mean if i saw him
on the street i might think so
but after talkin to him
id just say hes kinda unusual
mmhm so whats he look like
why
i just wanna know is all
why so you can go after him
jesus ann get a life
i just asked what he looked like
besides even if i decide
to fuck his brains out
what business is that of yours
why do you have to say that
say what
you know what
you say it just to irritate me
i say it because its descriptive
he doesnt strike me as a person
who would go in for that kinda thing
ann you always underestimate me
i wonder why
i think youre afraid to put us in the same
room youre afraid hed be drawn to me
really cynthia
i dont think hes your type
my type
how would you know what my type is
oh i have a pretty good idea
ann you dont have a clue
look i dont even know
why were discussin this
i mean ill just go over
and call him myself
he doesnt have a phone
well ill call him when he does
he wont
what are you talkin about
he doesnt like to talk on the phone
hes not getting a phone
oh please
ok so give me the zen masters address
ill think of a reason to stop by
please just let me talk to him first
why just gimme the address
you wont even have to be involved
i dont feel right just giving you the
address so you can go over there and
and what
do whatever it is you do
do whatever it is you do
listen to the way you talk
i talk fine
thank you i was still smoking that
whatd you lose
that goddamn pearl earring

i have to go to work
graham what is the most unusual
location youve ever masturbated in
well
l um
one time i was flying from
los angeles to um to new york
and i was you know
it was a really crowded flight and i was
i was sitting in the middle
i didnt get a window i didnt get an aisle
it was really funny
and i was i was just bored
my magazines were just boring
i think i had like a womans magazine
and they touch on a lot of sexual issues
and stuff and i was thinking to myself
god thats what i need i need a little
something to take my mind off this trip
so i was just you know
just thinking away and then i just
i just did it on the plane
just between these two people
knocking at door
nobody knew
graham how were you able
to not betray what was going on
to the people around you
well you know
i have really strong muscles
its open
hi
hello ann
i hope im not botherin you
no no
i wouldve phoned you busy
no no i can finish later
i just wanted to see what
the apartment looked like with furniture
yeah well im afraid
theres not much to see
im sort of cultivating
this minimalist vibe
you could use a bookshelf
yeah yeah you think so
theyre you know
theyre all library books
what are these
uh those are videotapes
i can see that of what
its a personal project
ive been workin on
what kind of personal project
what
what kind of personal project
uh a personal project
like anyone elses personal project
mines just a little more
personal i guess
whos donna
what
donna it says donna here on the tape
donna was a girl i knew in florida
oh you went out with her
no not really
why do these tapes
all have womens names on em
well i enjoy interviewing
women more than men

the interviews are about sex
sex
what about sex
uh everything about sex
like what
what theyve done what they do
what they want to do but are afraid to ask
for what they wouldnt do even if asked
anything i can think of oh your ice

she usually calls me loud
yeah she called you that too
so uh what are you doin here
you want me to leave
no i just wanna know why youre here
well like i said ann is my sister
sisters talk you can imagine the rest
no i think its probably better
if i dont characterise that conversation
that i didnt hear
i dont have any idea really what you
or ann said about me or anything else
do you want some iced tea
sure
i dont have any lemons
the last time i saw ann she left here
very confused id say and upset
she still is
so are you here to make me feel bad
for makin her feel bad
no
she didnt tell you why she was upset
no
thanks
so i dont understand
what made you wanna come here
i cant imagine ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me
yeah well see um i dont really
listen to ann when it comes to men
i mean look at john for christs sake
but then you went to school
with him didnt you
youre probably friends or somethin
no
no i think john is a liar
i think youre right
so come on i came all the way over here
to find out what got ann so spooked
why dont you tell me what happened
spooked the videotapes
are what got ann so spooked
oh
i think i get it
oh yeah what do you get
if ann got freaked out by these
they must be somethin sexual
are these tapes of you
havin sex with these girls
no not exactly
either you are or you arent which is it
why dont you let me tape you
doin what
talking
about what
about sex your sexual history
sexual preferences
what makes you think id discuss that
nothing
and you just wanna ask me questions
i just wanna ask you questions
thats all
thats all
is this how you get off tapin women
talkin about their sexual experiences
yes
would anyone else see the tape
absolutely not nobody else
sees the tapes ex cept for me
how long will it take
well that depends on you
one woman used up only three minutes
and another used three twohour tapes
how do we start
i turn on the camera and you start talking
do i sit or stand
what do you prefer
id prefer to sit
are you ready
ok im recording
so tell me your name
cynthia patrice bishop
you can speak in a normal voice
ok
so describe for me
your first sexual experience
um
first sexual experience
or first time i had intercourse
first sexual experience
whispers sexual experience
i was uh eight
and uh
is this the kinda thing that yeah ok
i was eight years old and um
michael green who was also eight
asked if he could watch me take a pee
and i said he could
if i could watch him take one too
so we went to the woods
behind my house
and i got this feeling he was chickenin
out cos he kept sayin ladies first
so i pulled down
my little panties and urinated
and he ran away before i even finished
was it a topic of conversation
between you after that
no he kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer
and then his family moved away
to cleveland actually
what a shame
when did you finally see a penis
when i was 14
so whatd you think
was it what you expected it to be
no not really i
i didnt i sorta pictured it um
i didnt think it would have
veins or ridges or anything
i just thought it would be smooth
like a test tube
its weird thinking about it now
the organ itself seemed like
a separate thing a separate entity to me
i mean when he finally pulled it out
and i could look at it and touch it
i forgot that there was a guy attached to it
i remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me
what did he say
he said my hand felt good
then what happened
and
then i started movin my hand
and then he stopped talkin
buzzer
yeah

what if this tape
gets into the wrong hands
the wrong hands john we are not
talking about military secrets here
theyre just tapes he makes
so he can sit around and get off
and he doesnt have sex
with any of them they just talk
they just sit around and talk
i could almost understand it
if he had sex with them i mean almost
why doesnt he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or somethin
doesnt work he has to know the people
he has to be able to interact with them
interact
whatever that means
did you have to masturbate
in front of him
i felt like it goddamn you and ann
make such a big deal out of this
you told ann about this
she is my sister
i tell her almost everything
i wish you hadnt
its just something id prefer
she didnt have to know about
shes a grownup she can handle it
ann
ann is just very
hung up
it just wasnt a smart thing to do
oh god

broadcast these things

why
youre asking me why
im married to you
and you want out of this marriage
i think you could tell me that
fuck you fuck you
all right
can you tell me where you went
i drove around
then i went over to grahams
grahams
graham
goddamn that son of a bitch
the backstabbin son of a
oh mr honesty huh
mr apostle of truth
well i know you didnt fuck him
did you make one of
these goddamn videotapes
annie answer me goddammit
goddammit answer me did you
yes i did
ah
god
dont you touch him
ok im gonna
footsteps
what
hello
john what the hell are you doing here
what are you doing
graham ok im recording
tell me your name
ann bishop millaney
so what do you wanna talk about
what do you usually talk about
sex
ok lets talk about sex
do you have sex
not very often no
when you do who usually initiates it
he does
is the sex satisfying
i dont know
i dont know i dont know what you mean
do you have orgasms
i dont think so
i mean i guess since im not sure
that ive never had one
have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband
here we go
here we go
why dont we stop
no
i dont wanna stop
have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband
ive thought about it
did you act on it
no
why not
because thats how cynthia thinks
i hate it when i have feelings that she has
it bothers me when i think about men
because i know thats the way she thinks
what other men have you thought about
i thought about you
have you thought about me
yes
what did you think
i thought about what you would
look like having an orgasm
id like to know
what i look like havin an orgasm
can you do that
give a woman an orgasm
yes
could you do that for me
no
why not
because i cant
cant or wont
i cant because i wont
you said you werent always impotent
no yeah thats correct
so you have had sex
yes
so what happened
was it so bad it turned you off or
no that wasnt the problem
what was the problem
i was the problem i was a
i was a pathological liar
or i am i should say
the lying is
lying is like alcoholism
youre continually recovering
so thats it
you lied
that was part of it
so what else happened
well at that time uh i
i used to express my feelings nonverbally
and often scared people
that were close to me
are you still like that
no
no
so youre never gonna make love again
i dont i havent made any plans so
if you were in love with me would you
im not in love with you
but if you were
i cant answer that
why not
i told you
but i dont understand
ann forget about the sex you know i
im not the same person that i was
even remotely you know
im different in so many ways
itd have a profound effect on the way that
i relate to other people communicate
this for instance the way she and i are
talking it could never have been possible
she the way she
she and i are talking
she whos she
im sorry i was
that isnt what i was
shes elizabeth is that who it is
is that the girl that john
talked about is that who it is
i guess i im sorry
so youre still in contact with her
with elizabeth
no im
what do you think elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes
i cant imagine her
bein too understanding
but youre gonna tell her about them
right since you dont lie any more
as i said i dont know
what im gonna do exactly
i mean perhaps i wont do anything
so you just came back here
so that you could think about it
no i moved back here for some
a sense of closure you know
resolution of some sort
i wanted somebody who was very
important to me to understand that
thats thats pathetic
i mean you cant just
oh my god graham
you just cant walk up to her
and show her youve changed
like its some gift or somethin
and look what youve changed into
nine years nine years
and this is what you come up with
is this what you wanna be
the rest of your life
why are you doin this
can you tell me that
why are you doin this to yourself
are you gonna answer me
please dont do that
why not
dont do that
i wanna ask a few questions like why
do you tape women talkin about sex
why do you do that
can you tell me why
come on im just gonna keep askin
i dont find turning the tables
very interesting
well i do tell me why graham
why
what
what what do you want me to tell you
tell me why why
ann you dont even know who i am you
dont have the slightest idea who i am
am i supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment
and just hope that its coherent
that it makes some sort of sense to you
it doesnt make any sense to me
you know i was there
i dont have the slightest idea who i am
and im supposed
to be able to explain it to you
and why you tell me why
why do i have to explain myself to you
because maybe i can help you
help me with what
your problem
my problem do i have a problem
i look around me in this town and i see
john and cynthia and you and i
i feel comparatively healthy
youve got a problem
youre right
ive got a lot of problems
but they belong to me
you think theyre yours but theyre not
everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem
anybody that comes in contact with you
i didnt wanna be
part of your problem but i am
im leavin my husband
and maybe i would have anyway
but the fact is that im doin it now
and part of its because of you
youve had an effect on my life
this isnt supposed to happen
ive spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didnt happen
you know i never told you this
cos i knew itd crush you
but now
i fucked elizabeth
before you broke up
before you were havin trouble even
shes no saint
she was good in bed
she could keep a secret
thats about all i can say about her
john i gotta make a call
man yeah sure
ringing tone
kirklands office

just one moment please

anyway as ive always said
work is critical
i can be happy without a marriage but if
you take away my work thats different
