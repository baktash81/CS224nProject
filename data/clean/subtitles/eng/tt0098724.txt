 man 
what kind of thoughts about garbage 
i just    i ve gotten real concerned over
what s gonna happen with all the garbage 
i mean  we ve got so much of it 
you know  i mean  we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually 
the last time    i started feelin  this way
is when that barge was stranded
and  you know  it was goin  around
the island and nobody would claim it 
  do you remember that 
  yes  i remember 
do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern 
yeah  yeah 
you see  the other night
john was taking out the garbage 
and he kept spilling things
out of the container 
and that made me   
i started imagining  like 
a garbage can that produces garbage 
and it doesn t stop  it keeps producing
garbage  and it keeps overflowing 
and  you know  what would you do
to try to stop something like that 
  ann  do you see any pattern here 
  what do you mean 
well  last week we were talking about
your obsession with
the families of airline fatalities 
now we re talking about your
concern over the garbage problem 
yeah    so 
well  if you think about it  i think
you ll see the object of your obsession
is invariably something negative
which you have no control over 
yeah  but how many people do you think
run around obsessing over
how great and how happy things are 
you know  i mean  maybe they do 
but i don t think they re in therapy 
anyway    bein  happy isn t all that great 
i mean  the last time
i was really happy  i got so fat 
i must ve put on 25 pounds 
i thought john was gonna have a stroke 
  so  what are you worried about 
  what am i looking at here 
  is this a mistake 
  depends on your point of view 
i don t think so  in fact 
i m gonna tell you a little secret 
as soon as you get a ring on your finger 
you start getting spectacular attention
  from the opposite gender 
  that s bullshit 
seriously  i wish i had
super bowl seats for every time
some filly had come up and talked to me
without the slightest provocation 
  it s just marvellous 
  that happened before you got married 
no  no  no 
it never happened before i got married 
if i d known  i d have bought a ring
when i was 18 and saved myself   
 laughs  yeah  right 
   a lot of time and money 
no  i wish somebody d clued me in 
i m tellin  you 
it s too weird 
oh  shit  i gotta be someplace 
  so  racquetball thursday  right 
  how about 7 30 
  yeah  fine  see you later  bye 
  bye bye 
   woman  yes  sir 
  janet 
reschedule kirkland for  uh  friday  1 30 
  yes  sir 
  all right 
 therapist  are you still
keeping these thoughts from john 
 ann  yeah 
are you afraid of his finding you silly
at thinking these things 
no  it s not that  it s just   
  i m really angry at him right now 
  why 
he invited this college friend of his to
stay at our house and didn t even ask me 
i m gonna say yes  of course  but   
you know  it just would ve
been nice to have been asked 
what upsets you about that 
i guess it makes me angry
because i can t justify bein  angry 
it s his house  he pays the mortgage 
yes  but he asked you to quit your job 
and you do have housework 
yeah  i have housework  that s true 
this unexpected guest notwithstanding 
how are things with john 
oh  they re fine 
ex cept for i m going through this thing
where i don t want him to touch me  but   
when did you begin having this feeling 
well    last week 
i don t know  i just    i got this
really strange feelin   and    ugh   
just didn t want him to touch me 
prior to this feeling  were you
comfortable with contact with john 
oh  yeah  sure  yeah 
ex cept for    well   
i ve never really been that much into sex 
i mean  i like it and everything  but   
you know  i just don t think
it s such a big deal  and   
i wouldn t miss it  you know  kinda thing 
but lately i ve just    been kinda curious
about how things have slacked off 
perhaps he senses
your hesitance at being touched 
but that s the weird thing 
because he started not touching me
before i started feelin  like that 
ah 
i mean  i m sure he probably wishes
that i would initiate things once in a while 
and i would  ex cept for
it just never occurs to me  and   
well  the few times
i have felt like it i was by myself 
did you do anything 
what do you mean 
did you masturbate 
oh 
oh  oh 
god  no 
no  mm mm 
i take it from your response
that you never masturbate 
well    i tried once 
it just seems so stupid 
i don t know  it just seemed like
a dumb thing to do  and   
god  and then i started worrying that my
dead grandfather was watching me  and   
 sighs 
it seemed so stupid  especially when you
don t know what to do with the garbage 
oh  so it was recently
when you tried this 
oh  well  it was kind of recently 
but not    real recently 
i am just not up to
havin  a guest in the house 
i gotta go  i gotta go to the office 
i gotta get back to the office 
i only get one today  gee  how ex citing 
i already skipped one meeting 
i gotta get back 
look  john  if you wanna leave  leave 
my life doesn t revolve around these
little get togethers  don t flatter yourself 
don t feel like you gotta treat me with
kid gloves  tell me how you really feel 
listen  i got a friend comin  into town 
an old friend i haven t seen in years 
from what i can tell 
i think he s a little lost 
i think i may have
to spend a little time with him 
mm hm 
meaning we ll have to cool it for a while 
  yeah 
  yeah 
i wish you d quit
that bartending job of yours 
why 
i hate the thought
of all those guys hittin  on you 
 laughs  i can handle it 
i m sure 
besides  the money is good 
and some of the guys are cute 
and you are in no position to be jealous 
who said i was jealous 
i did 
you know  i d like to do it
at your house sometime 
i must admit  the idea of doin  it in my
sister s bed gives me a perverse thrill 
i wish i could just come right out
and tell everyone ann s a lousy lay 
the beautiful  the popular
ann bishop millaney 
  could be risky 
  how about i just start a rumour  then 
  no  no  i mean doin  it at my house 
  afraid of gettin  caught 
yeah 
you should be 
  can i meet this friend of yours 
  who  graham 
i gotta tell you  we were very close
many years ago  but i   
i think we re very different now 
 doorbell 
  yes 
  ann  uh  my name is graham dalton 
  oh  yeah  sure 
  may i use your bathroom 
uh huh  come on in 
  where is it 
  oh  back there to the left  i m sorry 
do you like strawberries 
i brought you some 
thank you  that s real sweet 
hi  um  john millaney  please 
this is his wife 
that s all right  thank you 
well 
  that was quick 
  false alarm 
have a seat 
i m sorry  we don t let people
smoke in the house 
  but if you d like to  we could go outside 
  oh  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  i   
i can wait  i m   
  do you have any other things 
  yes 
oh  you mean to bring in  no 
i do have some other things  but i don t   
this is all i need to stay here 
have you ever been on television 
television  no  no 
why 
i was just curious 
graham  that s an unusual name 
yeah  yeah  l  uh    i guess it is 
my mother is a complete anglophile 
anything british
makes her drool like a baby 
so she  you know  i think she heard
the name in a movie or something 
she s a prisoner of public television now 
how do you like being married 
i like it just fine 
what about it do you like  i   
  i don t mean to be critical  i m curious 
  no  no  no  no  that s ok  uh   
well    you know the cliche
about the security of it 
well  that s true 
and  um  we own this house 
it s a nice house  and   
john was just made junior partner 
and i really like that 
you know  i like the fact that he s just not 
you know  freelance or whatever 
yes 
so  how long has it been
since you ve seen john 
  nine years 
  nine years 
yeah  i was surprised he invited me
to stay here until i found a place 
  didn t you know him very well 
  oh  no  i knew him very well 
john and i   
were very much alike 
really 
that s kinda hard to believe 
i mean  you just seem so different now 
yeah  well  i would imagine
we are pretty different now 
  i m ready to use the bathroom  finally 
  ok 
graham  i gotta tell you  i almost
called the cops when i saw you today 
i thought to myself
 this couldn t possibly be the same guy
that once held private services in
the back of the chapel on a weekly basis  
  you did that 
  everybody has a past  that s mine  so   
so  what s with the get up 
  somebody die  or    
   ann  john 
  i m sorry  did     i m sorry 
  no  no  no 
nobody died 
  so   
  i mean   
what do you think the greeks d
think of this rather sombre attire 
i don t know 
  dinner was very good 
  yeah  it wasn t bad  honey 
usually ann achieves a kinda critical
mass with the salt  but  uh  tonight was   
i always tell her  you can always
add more  but you can t take it away 
yeah  you say that  don t you 
  so  do you have family here 
  mm 
mother  father  my sister 
  sister older or younger 
  younger 
are you close 
i m sorry  i m    i m prying again  i m sorry 
were you prying before 
i was grilling ann about your marriage 
  how d it go 
  well  i    very well  uh   
so  i was asking about your sister 
yeah  well   
we get along all right  it s just that  uh   
well  i think she s an extrovert 
i just think she s loud 
she probably wouldn t agree 
no  i mean  definitely wouldn t agree 
so  listen  are you gonna
see elizabeth while you re here 
uh    i don t know 
  who s elizabeth 
  a girl graham dated in school 
well after the chapel episodes 
she still lives here 
to the best of my knowledge 
so graham and i
were talking about apartments 
and i told him that they ve got lovely
little apartments in the garden district 
  and they got nice garage apartments   
  there s critical crime in that district 
  oh  john  come on  that is not true 
  no  there are   
i don t know what kind of place you re
lookin  for  there s plenty of apartments   
     in any one place 
  i m sorry 
no  i just    right now i have one key 
you know  everything i own is in the car 
i like that 
if i get an apartment  that s two keys 
if i get a job  you know  i might have
to open or close  that s more keys 
i buy some stuff  i m afraid it s gonna
get ripped off  and i get more keys 
  i just like having the one key  it s clean 
  you don t have to worry about losin   em 
get rid of the car when you get
the apartment  still one key 
i like having the car  you know 
the car s important  you gotta be mobile 
in case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry 
yeah  or go someplace in a hurry 
ex cuse me 
  do you want some help 
  no  no  really  i m fine 
there s not that much to do 
graham  do you pay taxes 
yeah  i pay taxes 
yeah  i pay taxes  what do you mean 
you don t pay taxes  you re a liar 
i m not a liar 
liars are the second lowest form
of human being on the planet 
   ann  what s the first 
  lawyers 
oh  that s you  honey 
annie  why don t you go with graham
to hunt for apartments 
show him how the city s changed 
  would you mind  graham 
  no  i d love that 
  i d like that  too  let s do that 
  all right  how about tomorrow 
  that d be great 
  good 
one key  huh 
 john  great idea 
 phone rings 
  yeah 
  cynthia  john

no  it ll just be me 
  are you a student 
  no 
you can hang
a shower curtain in the bath 
make sure you put somethin 
in the tub so you won t fall 
you said about 350 
yeah  and  uh  plus

  all right  will you lease month to month 
  not for 350 
how about 400 
i could live with that  i could live with that 
  ok  it s a deal 
  all right 
  ready 
  yeah 
  john 
  in here 
well  ain t you a picture 
well  do you like it 
it s lovely  is it for me 
yeah  it s for you 
is that for me 
yeah  that s for you 
you re amazing  dear 
 ann  can i tell you something personal 
it s up to you 
can i tell you something personal 
yeah  yeah 
well  you gotta go first 
ok 
i think that  um   
i think that sex is overrated 
i think that people place
far too much importance on it 
and i think that stuff about women
wantin  it just as bad as men is crap 
i think they want it  i just don t think they
want it for the reason men think they do 
i m getting confused 
  do you understand what i m    
  yeah 
yeah  yeah 
yeah  i remember reading somewhere
that men learn to love
the person that they re attracted to 
and that women become more and more
attracted to the person that they love 
god  that s    that s beautiful 
that s really beautiful  i like that 
oh  i m just quoting 
so  are you gonna
tell me something personal 
  do you want me to 
  yeah  yeah  i do 
i don t want it to be
something gross  about some scar 
i want it to be something
really personal  about yourself 
all right  ok 
  i m impotent 
  you re what 
  lmpotent 
   clears throat  you are 
yeah  i mean  like  well  i can t   
i can t get an erection   
in the presence of another person 
so  for all practical purposes 
i m impotent 
does that bother you 
no 
does it make you feel self conscious 
not usually 
no  uh   
yeah  i m self conscious 
not in the same way
that you are  though 
  me  me  you think i m self conscious 
  well   
i been watching you  i watch you eat 
you know  i watch you speak 
watch you move  and i see somebody
who is extremely aware
of people looking at you 
  my therapist   
  you re in therapy 
aren t you 
no  i    no  i m not 
i was a miserable failure in therapy 
  so you don t believe in therapy 
  no  i believe in it for some people 
i don t know  it was 
you know  silly for me 
i was confused going in 
so i just formed my own theory
that you should never take advice
from someone
that doesn t know you intimately 
well  i know my therapist intimately 
  you ve had sex with your therapist 
  no 
  no  no 
  oh  no  i m sorry  that s what i meant 
somebody you ve had sex with 
oh 
i m    i don t understand 
i mean  how would you know 
  i mean  you know  how    
  oh  no  i wasn t always impotent 
oh  oh  ok 
so  let me see  you said  um   
you said that i should never take advice
from someone that
i haven t had sex with  right 
  basically 
  right 
and  uh  we haven t had sex 
  right 
  no 
so i guess from your own advice 
i shouldn t take your advice 
  i wouldn t 
  you wouldn t  ok 
 ann  all right 
  drive safely 
  yeah  right 
   therapist  how was your weekend 
   ann  it was ok 
  did you confront john about the visitor 
  the visitor 
the friend of john s
that was staying at your house 
  graham 
  graham 
yeah  i mean    no 
that actually
turned out to be interesting 
you know  i was expecting him
to be just like john 
you know  cos they went
to school together and everything 
you know  talking about getting drunk
together and secret handshakes and   
he turned out to be
really this    character 
he s kind of arty 
but ok 
is he still at your house 
no  no  no  he s gone 
so where s he from 
i don t know  he  uh  used to live
in new york and philadelphia 
i think he just kinda travels around 
must be nice 
so  what s he like  is he like john 
no  i don t think john likes him any more 
says he thinks he s gotten kinda strange 
is he  strange  i mean 
no  i mean  if i saw him
on the street i might think so 
but after talkin  to him 
i d just say he s kinda unusual 
mm hm  so  what s he look like 
why 
  i just wanna know  is all 
  why  so you can go after him 
jesus  ann  get a life 
i just asked what he looked like 
besides  even if i decide
to fuck his brains out 
what business is that of yours 
  why do you have to say that 
  say what 
you know what 
you say it just to irritate me 
i say it because it s descriptive 
he doesn t strike me as a person
who would go in for that kinda thing 
  ann  you always underestimate me 
  i wonder why 
i think you re afraid to put us in the same
room  you re afraid he d be drawn to me 
really  cynthia 
i don t think he s your type 
my type 
how would you know what my type is 
oh  i have a pretty good idea 
ann  you don t have a clue 
look  i don t even know
why we re discussin  this 
i mean  i ll just go over
and call him myself 
he doesn t have a phone 
well  i ll call him when he does 
he won t 
what are you talkin  about 
he doesn t like to talk on the phone 
he s not getting a phone 
oh  please 
ok  so give me the zen master s address 
i ll think of a reason to stop by 
please  just let me talk to him first 
why  just gimme the address 
you won t even have to be involved 
i don t feel right just giving you the
address so you can go over there and   
  and what 
  do whatever it is you do 
 do whatever it is you do  
listen to the way you talk 
  i talk fine 
  thank you  i was still smoking that 
what d you lose 
that goddamn pearl earring 
it cost me a fucking fortune 
i must ve left it somewhere 
so  what are you
gettin  momma for her birthday 
i don t know 
i ll get her a card or somethin  
  a card for her 50th birthday 
  yeah  what s wrong with that 
well  the woman gave birth to you 
i think you might be givin  her   
will you stop  jesus 
  i just thought that  you know  maybe   
  ok  ann  ok 
how about this 
you get her something nice 
and i ll pay for half 
  all right 
  fine  fine 
fine  ok  now  if you ll pardon me 
i have to go to work 
 graham  what is the most unusual
location you ve ever masturbated in 
well   
l  um   
one time i was flying from
los angeles to  um  to new york 
and i was    you know 
it was a really crowded flight and i was   
i was sitting in the middle 
i didn t get a window  i didn t get an aisle 
it was really funny 
and i was    i was just bored 
my magazines were just boring 
i think i had  like  a woman s magazine 
and they touch on a lot of sexual issues
and stuff  and i was thinking to myself
 god  that s what i need  i need a little   
something to take my mind off this trip  
so  i was just  you know 
just thinking away  and then i just   
i just did it on the plane 
just between these two people 
   knocking at door 
  nobody knew 
 graham  how were you able
to not betray what was going on
to the people around you 
well  you know 
i have really strong muscles 
it s open 
  hi 
  hello  ann 
  i hope i m not botherin  you 
  no  no 
  i would ve phoned  you busy 
  no  no  i can finish later 
i just wanted to see what
the apartment looked like with furniture 
yeah  well  i m afraid
there s not much to see 
i m sort of cultivating
this minimalist vibe 
  you could use a bookshelf 
  yeah  yeah  you think so 
they re    you know 
they re all library books 
  what are these 
  uh  those are videotapes 
i can see that  of what 
it s a personal project
i ve been workin  on 
what kind of personal project

  what kind of personal project 
uh  a personal project
like anyone else s personal project 
mine s just a little more   
personal  i guess 
who s donna 
  what 
  donna  it says  donna  here on the tape 
donna was a girl i knew in florida 
oh  you went out with her

what about sex 
uh  everything about sex 
like what 
what they ve done  what they do 
what they want to do but are afraid to ask
for  what they wouldn t do even if asked 
anything i can think of  oh  your ice 
  you just ask them questions

and they answer  em 
yeah  uh   
mostly  sometimes they do things

so  uh  what are you doin  here 
  you want me to leave 
  no  i just wanna know why you re here 
well  like i said  ann is my sister

that i didn t hear 
i don t have any idea  really  what you
or ann said about me or anything else 
  do you want some iced tea 
  sure 
i don t have any lemons 
the last time i saw ann she left here
very confused  i d say  and upset 
she still is 
so  are you here to make me feel bad
for makin  her feel bad 
no 
  she didn t tell you why she was upset 
  no 
thanks 
so  i don t understand
what made you wanna come here 
i can t imagine ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me 
yeah  well  see  um  i don t really
listen to ann when it comes to men 
i mean  look at john  for christ s sake 
but then  you went to school
with him  didn t you 
you re probably friends or somethin

i was eight years old  and  um 
michael green  who was also eight 
asked if he could watch me take a pee 
and i said he could
if i could watch him take one  too 
so we went to the woods
behind my house 
and i got this feeling he was chickenin 
out cos he kept sayin   ladies first  
so i pulled down
my little panties and urinated 
and he ran away before i even finished 
was it a topic of conversation
between you after that 
no  he kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer 
and then his family moved away 
to cleveland  actually 
what a shame 
when did you finally see a penis 
when i was 14 
so  what d you think 
was it what you expected it to be 
no  not really  i   
i didn t    i sorta pictured it  um   
i didn t think it would have
veins or ridges or anything 
i just thought it would be smooth 
like a test tube 
it s weird  thinking about it now 
the    organ itself seemed like
a separate thing  a separate entity to me 
i mean  when he finally pulled it out
and i could look at it and touch it 
i forgot that there was a guy attached to it 
i remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me 
  what did he say 
  he said my hand felt good 
then what happened 
and   
then i started movin  my hand 
and then he stopped talkin  
 buzzer 
  yeah

  my sister  for one 
  for god s sake  ann 
  is that who it is 
  ann  i m not fucking your sister 
i don t find her that attractive 
for one thing 
  is that supposed to comfort me 
  no  i m just saying 
i m just saying i didn t get paranoid
when you didn t wanna make love to me 
i could have assumed that you didn t want
to because you were having an affair 
  i m not 
  well  i m not either  now  come on 
  then why don t i believe you 
  oh  look  this is ridiculous 
  maybe when you have evidence   
  there s evidence 
that s not what i m saying  i m just
saying that we shouldn t not ever talk 
just don t give me
conjecture and intuition 
  always a lawyer 
  goddamn right 
i mean  can you imagine   your honour 
i m positive the man is guilty  
   i can t place him at the scene    
  all right 
   but i have this strong feeling    
  all right  you made your point  ok 
all right 
i m sorry 
i m sorry 
i m just under a lot of pressure
with this    this kirkland thing 
i mean  you know
it s my first big case as junior partner 
i work all day and i come home 
i look forward to seeing you 
it hurts that you d accuse me like that 
i m sorry 
what  come on 
i ve just got all this time
on my hands  and i just sit around
and start inventing these 
like  intricate scenarios 
and then i don t want to have wasted
all my time  so i wanna believe  em 
  isn t therapy helpin  at all 
  oh  john  i don t know 
i just feel so stupid sittin 
talkin  about my little problems
when i know
those poor children are starving 
well   
quitting your therapy s not gonna   
not gonna feed the children in ethiopia 
i know 
you never used to say the word  fucking  
fuck 
it s so stupid  i have a hard time
believing you did it 
  what s so stupid about it 
  well  you   
  you don t even know the guy 
  well  you know him 
he s a friend of yours 
do you think he can be trusted 
i don t know 
i don t know 
from what you ve told me  i don t know 
i shoulda known when
he showed up dressed like
some undertaker for the art world 
i like the way he dresses 
what if this tape
gets into the wrong hands 
 the wrong hands   john  we are not
talking about military secrets here 
they re just tapes he makes
so he can sit around and get off 
and he doesn t have sex
with any of them  they just talk 
they just sit around and talk 
i could almost understand it
if he had sex with them  i mean  almost 
why doesn t he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or somethin  
doesn t work  he has to know the people 
he has to be able to interact with them 
interact 
whatever that means 
did you have to masturbate
in front of him 
i felt like it  goddamn  you and ann
make such a big deal out of this 
  you told ann about this 
  she is my sister 
  i tell her almost everything 
  i wish you hadn t 
it s just something i d prefer
she didn t have to know about 
  she s a grown up  she can handle it 
  ann   
  ann is just very   
  hung up 
  it just wasn t a smart thing to do 
  oh  god 
did you sign any sort of paper 
or did he have a contract with you
saying that he wouldn t
broadcast these things 
no  sir 
you realise you have no recourse legally 
 laughs 
it s not funny  it s not funny  cynthia 
these tapes could show up anywhere 
they won t  i trust him 
you trust him  that s funny 
yeah  i do 
a hell of a lot more than i trust you 
  what do you mean 
  just what i said 
i d trust him before i d trust you 
  it hurts that you say that to me 
  you re fucking your wife s sister 
you re a liar  but at least i know that 
i know  i know  second lowest form
of human being  and the first 
  what are you talking about 
  nothing  you re lying to ann  too 
yeah  right  but i didn t take a vow in front
of god and everyone to be faithful to ann 
look  are we gonna do it or not 
actually    no  i ve changed my mind 
i shouldn t have called 
well  i m here now 
i need to do somethin  
would you like
to help me straighten up 
jesus 
is there one chair
in this place that works 
well  why don t you
go sit somewhere else 
come on  john  you should be happy 
we ve gone this far without ann findin 
out  i m makin  it real easy on you 
  just walk out of here 
  did he put you up to this 
  who 
  graham 
no  he didn t put me up to this  jesus 
i don t need people to tell me what to do 
i ve just been thinkin   that s all 
now just    leave 
maybe i don t wanna leave 
maybe i wanna talk 
john  we don t have
anything to talk about 
yeah  you re right 
things are gettin  complicated 
no  they re gettin  real simple 
it s open 
hello 
want something to drink 
yeah  thanks 
i m sorry  i don t have any iced tea left 
thank you 
john and cynthia have been    fucking 
yes  i know 
  you know 
  yes 
how did you know 
she said it on her tape 
thanks for telling me 
i really appreciate it 
well  i    i haven t seen you 
and i don t think i would ve told you
even if i had seen you 
why not 
because it s not really my place 
my life is shit 
it s just shit 
nothing s what i thought it was 
john s a bastard 
let s make a videotape 
no  i   
  i don t think that s a good idea 
  why not 
because i don t think it s a choice that
you d make in a normal frame of mind 
and what would you know
about a normal frame of mind 
that s a good question 
  so  what do you have to do to get ready 
  uh   
load a tape and turn on the camera 
do it 
so  where do you get your money from 
for rent  and tapes  and stuff like that 
underneath my mattress 
and what are you gonna do
when this money runs out 
it won t 
are you comfortable there 
yeah  i m comfortable 
ok  i m recording 
tell me your name 
ann bishop millaney 
margaret  hi  it s john  fine 
listen  have you seen ann at all today 
this afternoon 
uh    well  no  i just   
she s home  bye bye 
everything s fine  thanks  bye 
thank god  you had me worried sick 
i come home 
the door is open  the car is gone 
i thought you d been
abducted by some mad fucker 
  are you all right 
  i want out of this marriage 
what 
i    want    out    of this marriage 
why 
why 
you re asking me why 
i m married to you
and you want out of this marriage 
i think you could tell me that 
fuck you  fuck you 
all right 
  can you tell me where you went 
  i drove around 
  then i went over to graham s 
  graham s 
graham 
goddamn that son of a bitch 
the backstabbin  son of a   
oh  mr honesty  huh 
mr apostle of truth 
well  i know you didn t fuck him 
did you make one of
these goddamn videotapes 
annie    answer me  goddammit 
goddammit  answer me  did you 
  yes  i did 
  ah 
god 
don t you touch him 
ok  i m gonna   
   footsteps 
  what 
hello 
john  what the hell are you doing here 
what are you doing 
 graham  ok  i m recording 
tell me your name 
ann    bishop    millaney 
so  what do you wanna talk about 
  what do you usually talk about 
  sex 
ok  let s talk about sex 
do you have sex 
not very often  no 
when you do  who usually initiates it 
he does 
is the sex satisfying 
i don t know 
i don t know  i don t know what you mean 
do you have orgasms 
i don t think so 
i mean  i guess  since i m not sure 
that i ve never had one 
have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband 
here we go 
here we go 
  why don t we stop 
  no 
i don t wanna stop 
have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband 
i ve thought about it 
  did you act on it 
  no 
why not 
because that s how cynthia thinks 
i hate it when i have feelings that she has 
it bothers me when i think about men 
because i know that s the way she thinks 
what other men have you thought about 
i thought about you 
  have you thought about me 
  yes 
what did you think 
i thought about what you would
look like having an orgasm 
i d like to know
what i look like havin  an orgasm 
can you do that 
give a woman an orgasm 
yes 
could you do that for me 
  no 
  why not 
because i can t 
  can t or won t 
  i can t because i won t 
  you said you weren t always impotent 
  no  yeah  that s correct 
  so you have had sex 
  yes 
so  what happened 
was it so bad it turned you off  or    
  no  that wasn t the problem 
  what was the problem 
i was the problem  i was a   
i was a pathological liar 
or i am  i should say 
the lying is   
lying is like alcoholism 
you re continually recovering 
so that s it 
you lied 
  that was part of it 
  so  what else happened 
well  at that time  uh    i   
i used to express my feelings nonverbally 
and often scared people
that were close to me 
are you still like that 
no 
no 
so you re never gonna make love again 
i don t    i haven t made any plans  so   
  if you were in love with me  would you 
  i m not in love with you 
  but if you were 
  i can t answer that 
  why not 
  i told you 
  but i don t understand 
  ann  forget about the sex  you know  i   
i m not the same person that i was   
even remotely  you know 
i m different in so many ways 
it d have a profound effect on the way that
i relate to other people  communicate 
this  for instance  the way she and i are
talking  it could never have been possible 
 she    the way she   
she and i are talking  
   she   who s  she  
  i m sorry  i was   
  that isn t what i was   
  she s elizabeth  is that who it is 
is that the girl that john
talked about  is that who it is 
  i guess  i    i m sorry 
  so  you re still in contact with her 
  with elizabeth 
  no  i m   
what do you think elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes 
i can t imagine her
bein  too understanding 
but you re gonna tell her about them 
right  since you don t lie any more 
as i said  i don t know
what i m gonna do  exactly 
i mean    perhaps i won t do anything 
so  you just came back here
so that you could think about it 
no  i moved back here for some   
a sense of closure  you know 
resolution of some sort 
i wanted somebody who was very
important to me to understand that 
that s    that s pathetic 
i mean  you can t just   
oh  my god  graham 
you just can t walk up to her
and show her you ve changed
like it s some gift or somethin  
and look what you ve changed into 
nine years  nine years 
and this is what you come up with 
is this what you wanna be
the rest of your life 
why are you doin  this 
can you tell me that 
why are you doin  this to yourself 
  are you gonna answer me 
  please  don t do that 
  why not 
  don t do that 
i wanna ask a few questions  like why
do you tape women talkin  about sex 
why do you do that 
can you tell me why 
come on  i m just gonna keep askin  
i don t find turning the tables
very interesting 
well  i do  tell me why  graham 
  why 
  what 
what  what do you want me to tell you 
 tell me why   why 
ann  you don t even know who i am  you
don t have the slightest idea who i am 
am i supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment
and just hope that it s coherent 
that it makes some sort of sense to you 
it doesn t make any sense to me 
you know  i was there 
i don t have the slightest idea who i am 
and i m supposed
to be able to explain it to you 
and why  you tell me why 
why do i have to explain myself to you 
because maybe i can help you 
  help me with what 
  your problem 
my problem  do i have a problem 
i look around me in this town and i see
john and cynthia and you  and i   
i feel comparatively healthy 
you ve got a problem 
you re right 
i ve got a lot of problems 
but they belong to me 
you think they re yours  but they re not 
everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem 
anybody that comes in contact with you 
i didn t wanna be
part of your problem  but i am 
i m leavin  my husband 
and maybe i would have anyway 
but the fact is that i m doin  it now 
and part of it s because of you 
you ve had an effect on my life 
this isn t supposed to happen 
i ve spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didn t happen 
you know  i never told you this 
cos i knew it d crush you 
but now   
i fucked elizabeth 
before you broke up 
before you were havin  trouble  even 
she s no saint 
she was good in bed 
she could keep a secret 
that s about all i can say about her 
   john  i gotta make a call 
   man  yeah  sure 
 ringing tone 
  kirkland s office 
  john millaney for brian kirkland 
  just one moment  please 
  all right 
anyway  as i ve always said 
work is critical 
i can be happy without a marriage  but if
you take away my work  that s different 
and if ann can t handle that   
  well  that s her problem 
   janet  mr millaney
