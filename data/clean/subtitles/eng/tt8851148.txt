 continues translating 
indistinct 
i m sorry 
how long was i doing that 
i lost feeling
about an hour ago 
  so i m not sure 
  why didn t you say something 
um  the movie is
a bit of a downer  so   
it s a love story 
 sniffles 
i mean 
not all love stories are downers 
all the good ones are 
romeo and juliet 
anna karenina 
  the english patient 
  mm hmm 
i think it s the ending
of a relationship 
that s what makes
a love story so memorable 
what about
pride and prejudice 
jane eyre 
those both have happy endings 
that s only because the writer chose
to end their love stories prematurely 
wow  that is
a really interesting way
of not admitting
you re wrong 
 laughing 
come on  okay  picture this 
picture that leonardo dicaprio
didn t die at the end of titanic 
  do i have to  oof 
  you have to 
jack dawson is a jobless 
penniless gambler 
who possessed  at best 
marginal artistic talent 
  he saved rose s life 
  right  of course 
but he also love bombed her and
stole her away from her fiancé 
and poor rose was just so
hypnotized by that steamy car sex 
that she really thought that he d give
her a life of passionate adventure 
please  come on  that s a life of abject
poverty and dehumanizing infidelity 
titanic 2  if you thought
part one was a disaster   
oh  my gosh 
 clears throat 
  i   
   sherman  time to go 
jesus  this guy is getting
a one star review  for sure 
so  um  how did you get
so good at speaking french 
my dad is a foreign
languages professor 
so by the time i was 12  he had me
fluent in french  spanish  and italian 
oh  oh  my gosh 
if i could just read dante s
inferno in the original italian 
  my life would be complete  i think 
  i get that a lot 
  really 
  no  no  i ve never gotten that before 
that s some pretty old gear you got there 
you don t shoot digital 
no  i don t  i get a much
higher dynamic range on film 
plus  i m also kind of addicted to
the smell of the developing chemicals 
the fumes make me a little delirious 
 laughs 
kind of like what your eyes
are doing to me right now 
ooh 
that   
 both chuckle 
  that was really cheesy 
  no  no 
it was    it was   
a little cheesy  yeah 
it sounded perfect
in my head 
  oh  okay  then let me imagine that for a sec  okay

somehow  i don t know 
   door opens

bad dream 
you called out his name 
it s called a visitation dream 
we see lots of  em around here 
it s all part
of the grieving process 
i know  it just felt
like skylar was really here 
  doris would love to hear about that 
  who s doris 
  a patient writing a book on the afterlife 
  okay 
the other day 
she offered to read my aura 
i politely declined 
  what is that 
  your belongings from the crash 
they closed
the accident report already 
well  neither driver had drugs
or alcohol in their system 
that s usually
the end of it 
they never even
interviewed me 
you said you didn t remember
anything about the accident 
  i don t 
  maybe that s for the best 
 dr  sarkisian 
i m very encouraged  tessa 
the scan shows
your right ventricle
is functioning quite well 
despite the tear 
finally  some good news 
it is more than good 
ninety nine out of 100 with this
same injury die on my table 
i did die 
only for a short time 
i could see skylar 
like  he was in this   
this crazy white light 
what is that 
was she  you know  hallucinating 
when the body undergoes
severe trauma   
   heartbeat thumping 
     the hypothalamus can flood the brain
  with pain relieving endorphins 
   vickie  so when can we take her home 
 dr  sarkisian  end of the week  tessa needs
to be extremely careful these next few months 
any chest pains
or shortness of breath 
you call 911 immediately 
understand 
 shower running 
 heartbeat thumping 
 crying 
 crying continues

 laughing  relax 
i m not psychic 
  jasmine told me you might come looking for me 
  oh

excuse me 
from the accident 
did you hurt your hands at all 
  no  why 
  ta da  huh 
oh  come on  come on 
 chuckles 
so  what is your book about 
it s about adc s 
after death communication 
okay  so you believe that
dead people can contact us 
along with billions
of other people
from faiths
that span the globe 
sometimes  the departed 
they call out
to us in voice 
and other times  we can smell their
cologne or perfume in the air 
no matter how they communicate 
the message is the same 
 i m still here 
and your grief 
like a beacon 
calls me to your side  
and when the separation
has been traumatic 
like with you
and your boyfriend 
there s often
unfinished business 
like regrets or something 
like things left undone
or unsaid 
   door opens 
   vickie  tessa 
we signed you out 
it s time to go 
he s in the in between

i took back in february 
is that how you spend your free
time  taking pictures of trees 
well  it s actually
not a tree  asshole

disguised as a tree

artificiality of modern life 
 school bell rings 
it s a lovely photo  tessa 
your technical skills have
taken huge leaps this year 
  oh  thank you

but i think you have a good shot of getting

thank you  i just   
my work s not ready for that yet 
oh  what do you feel
is missing 
just like a point of view 
you know  something to say
that s my own 
well  maybe it s time for
your subject matter to evolve 
after all  there is something
notably missing from all your photos 
yeah  i know  color 
no  people 
you know  tessa 
before an artist can find her voice 
she has to find
a subject she loves 
who or what
do you love  tessa

  i love your
precious heart  
  i  
  i was standing  
  you were there  
  two worlds collided  
  and they could never
tear us apart  
i have spent every summer of my
life down here with my grandfather 
how have i never
heard of this place 
well  that s my favorite
part about taking photos 
it s like you just stumble and
wander and find places like this 
right  but what   
what drew you to this spot specifically 
the view 
that view 
 seagulls squawking 
it was called
the empyrean 
it was a honeymooners 
resort back in the  60s 
it s so surreal 
it s unbelievable 
you ve gone in there 
unarmed 
i ll do anything
for a great photo 
 empyrean  
that s where dante
meets god  right 
highest of all heavens 
a place of pure love 
look at it  if that s not a metaphor
for love  then i don t know what is 
can i see your photos 
they re not on my phone 
i don t shoot digital  remember 
well  how do people
see your work 
i don t show it 
unless i have to for class 
how come 
 cause i m not
good enough yet 
i find that seriously
difficult to believe 
okay  so if you won t
show me your photos 
  maybe you can give me a tour 
  of the empyrean 
yeah  show it to me 
i wanna see it  you know 
through your eyes 
  never tear us apart 
playing 
 both laughing 
  we could live  
  for a thousand years  
  but if i hurt you
i d make wine  
   tennis ball thwacking 
   both grunting 
  from your tears
i told you  
  that we could fly  
   cause we all have wings  
  but some of us
don t know why  
  i was standing  
  you were there  
  two worlds collided  
  and they could never
ever tear us apart  
 piano keys playing 
do you know how to waltz 
  no 
  okay  just step back this way 
  okay 
  and then your back foot forward 
and then it s like one  two  three 
straighten your leg 
one  two  three 
okay 
and then you have to put
your chin up and then lead 
like you don t want to pay any
attention to the other person 
  don t slip 
   both laughing 
  you don t ask me  
    you were standing  
    you know it s true  
    i was there  
    worlds collided  
    two worlds collided  
    we re shining through  
  and they could never
tear us apart  
  i  
  i was standing  
do you want to see what it s
like to be inside of a camera 
  yeah 
  okay  close the door 
it works just like
a camera lens 
i kind of made it myself 
whoa

newlyweds past

 in deep voice

you re my wife 
what does the bride say 
well  the bride
is saying  um

  okay 
  you want me to walk you to your door
so your parents don t think

what 
or like someone   
a serial killer 
that s okay 
um  they re not my parents  actually 
i  uh    i m just a genetic stranger
that lives under their roof 
 a genetic stranger  
yeah  it s  uh   
it s a long story 
for another time 
when can i see you again

so did you call
the phone company

you were right  they just said that skylar

in the server or something 
but that doesn t explain why my phone just
turned on after it was completely trashed 
can you explain that 
i can t  no 
 sighs 
hey 
it s totally normal
to read into things 
my mom did the same thing
after her sister died 
every rainbow was a sign 
every butterfly
was a message from heaven 
 door opens 
meet my computer on wheels

i can t believe he s gone 
it s like i close my eyes
and i see us meeting
for the first time 
and i remember every word
that he said to me 
i remember every expression
on his face 
and then i open my eyes
and it s like   
did i  like  just dream
our entire relationship up 
  did i dream him up 
  hey  i was there 
he wasn t a dream  okay 
your head s just
a little scrambled 
that happens when two tons of
metal comes crashing into you 
i don t even remember the
last thing i said to him 
  come on 
  i m serious 
we were fighting
that last week  remember 
hey

 school bell ringing 
 phone chimes 
i heard about
what happened  tessa 
i m terribly sorry 
if you were my daughter 
i d tell you to use it

the pain  the emptiness 
channel it 
through your camera 
some of the greatest works of art
were produced by intense grief 
  okay 
  tessa 
risd portfolio day

thank you 
 seagulls squawking 
  perfect day  playing 
  just a perfect day  
  drink sangria

  we go home  
  just a perfect day  
  feed animals in the zoo  
  then later a movie too
and then home  
  oh  it s such
a perfect day  
  i m glad
i spent it with you  
  oh  such a perfect day  
  you just keep me
hanging on  
  you just keep me
hanging on  
 mel  so that s it 
you re just giving up
your photography 
it sure looks like it 
this is the same crap
your mom used to pull 
she d become obsessed
with things 
baking  yoga  pottery 
one day  lose interest 
move on to the next 
that s why she could never
get any traction in life 
are you done 
you think skylar
would have wanted this 
i don t know 
why don t you go ask him 
 sighs 
   skylar  it s okay  i won t tell the  80s police

  why do you need to talk to doris so bad 
  it s just   
it s about what she was telling me before 
it s about the afterlife 
maybe that old coot
isn t so crazy after all 
  what do you mean 
  your heartbeat is fast  but it sounds healthy 
wait  what do you    what were you saying 
what do you mean 
doris told me you d
come looking for her 
she even left you something 
her book 
tessa  i have seen a lot of dying
and grieving in my time here 
looking back
never helped anyone 
there s either life
or there s death 
there s no place in between 
i m gonna find him 
 doris on video  what does
the in between look like 
well  we as living beings can never
imagine it  we have no reference 
it would be like trying to
describe a sunset to a blind man 
technological advances have made
ghost hunting a legitimate field 
my friend darlene  she let me borrow
her full spectrum digital camera 
this baby can pick up light
well beyond the human eye 
with infrared night vision   
   shannon and tessa laughing 
   thunder rumbling 
well  happy fourth of july 
  i don t know  i actually kind of like this weather 
  don t call me 
so  you think this means
the fireworks are canceled 
  i think so  yeah 
  yeah 
  hey 
  hey 
  you okay 
  yeah 
skylar  tess says
you re going to brown 
  congrats 
  thank you 
what are you gonna study 
  probably latin 
  that ll come in handy 
you never know when you re gonna
meet the pope or something 
or need to conduct
an exorcism 
nice  that s nice 
i don t know  i just don t want
to have any regrets  you know 
i wanna live a bunch
of different lives 
what s the point of speaking
all these languages
if i m not gonna travel the
world and use them  you know 
let s go  we are going to
watch the fireworks on tv 
are your parents home 
do you want
to talk about it 
not really 
okay 
my mom filed
for divorce today 
i m really sorry 
you know  i know this doesn t
help right now  but   
just because
they re splitting up
that doesn t mean that they
don t care about each other 
it means they ve given up 
  i don t think that s fair 
  fair to who  you or them 
 sighs  when you re rowing a race
and you get to the last 20 meters 
your entire body
is telling you to stop 
your muscles are on fire 
your lungs are screaming at you 
everything inside you wants to
quit  make the pain go away 
but if you want to win 
that s exactly when you dig
deeper and you row harder 
you really don t like
to let things go  do you 
  you noticed 
   laughs 
 fireworks boom 
 whistling  booming 
 sighs 
you re just starting to make
me believe in happy endings 
  oh  no  the photo  no 
  oh  oh   
  what 
  it s totally ruined  it s totally ruined 
now you see why i don t
let anyone up here 
i am pretty amazed that you ve
let me into your inner sanctum 
yeah  well 
if you tell anyone 
i ll poison you 
oh  you don t have to   
  hmm 
  you don t have to look through that 
  no  no  no  okay 
  yeah 
it s cool 
i like this one 
  that s  um   
  that s a cell phone tower 
  yeah 
  it s an allegory
for something    technology
co opting our natural environment 
really 
really 
i know you hate compliments 
but this work is incredible 
i m serious  it s like you can
see things that no one else can 
that just shows how much
you know about photography 
 laughs 
i mean  i think
you can sell this stuff 
maybe on etsy 
there is something
that s missing
from like all
of your photos 
yeah  i know 
it s color 
no  you 
i just don t really think the
world needs another selfie 
oh  come on  what is wrong with stepping in
front of the camera every once in awhile 
i believe that a photographer
should point her lens outward 
  toward the world 
  yeah 
yeah  so you can try
and understand it 
what about trying
to understand yourself 
if you had my past 
you wouldn t ask that question 
you ever gonna
tell me about it 
 chuckles 
 sighs 
come on 
i ll walk you home 
i never met my real father 
he ran off before i was born 
and my mom   
the kind way to describe her
would be flaky 
  wow 
  instead of counting sheep
to go to sleep
when i was a kid 
i would count her fiancés 
and mel was
one of them 
yeah  he was
the last one 
her final victim before
she ghosted us for good 
and that s when
he took you in 
well  he tried 
but the court 
they just didn t really look too
kindly on a middle aged bachelor
wanting to adopt
a young girl 
so then where did you go 
ah  family services 
foster care 
oh 
you know how you said
that i notice things
that no one else does 
mm hmm 
when you live with strangers
who can hurt you 
and i bounced around a lot 
you have to really just
observe everything 
when you re a foster kid 
you learn the hard way to   
never put your guard down 
yeah 
anyway  about a year ago 
mel and vickie got married
and then the court
let them take me in 
so that s why you call
yourself a genetic stranger 
 buzzing  clicking 
  i did that 
   scoffs 
  one day  playing 
  sister don t mind
that i m not on time  
  she knows that
i m through with that  
  sick of trying  
  true and kind  
  call me aside
and i will now be  
  and i will be
fine with that     
 vickie  good god 
  how early is it 
  super early 
a little splash
of almond milk  right 
uh  yeah 
i like your necklace 
yeah  shannon
lent it to me 
you know  if you ever want to borrow anything
from me  clothes or makeup  jewelry   
all righty 
i ll see you later  vick 
  oh  one day  
see ya 
  i ll be fine with that  
  you don t leave me now
do you love me back   
 shutter clicks 
when a rower dies 
this is what heaven looks like 
for me  heaven is paris in the rain 
like cobblestone streets 
  yeah 
  yeah 
is everything
in black and white 
get out of my head 
you ever been  to paris 
someday 
avec moi 
i guess i could use
a translator 
my parents had
their honeymoon there 
so i ve been saving up
to send them
for their 25th anniversary 
  what if they don t want to go 
  i mean  who doesn t want to go to paris 
yeah  but what if they don t
want to go with each other 
it s not a crime to fall out of
love  you know 
  tessa 
  hmm 
love never dies 
what 
you just sound like someone
who s never been hurt by life 
you putting me on notice 
 laughs  no 
um  what the hell is that 
this   
  is a rowboat 
  i m assuming you want me to get in that 
  you are getting in this with me 
  no 
we spent four hours in your dark
room doing what you love to do 
let me show you
what i love to do 
 birds squawking 
chittering 
   tessa  hands under your    thumbs there 
   skylar  thumbs here 
and then it s gonna go simple like that 
you press it down 
  okay 
  and then you tilt it and then you pull it 
  hmm 
  and then you re pressing down

and then pull it 
  okay  i m gonna try and go forward again 
  all right 
  don t help me 
  i won t

 exhales sharply 
 tessa  oh  my god 
  this is awful 
   skylar laughs 
  oh  i m tired now 
  you re flying 
 skylar playing harmonica 
i love you  tessa 
 stammers softly 
we should probably
head back  yeah 
 slow pop music playing 
 moans softly 
 students chattering 
hey 
 the in between  
that s just what
doris calls it 
but every culture
has its own version of it 
so  it s where we go
after we die 
not me  i m going
to jamaica 
i m serious  shannon 
it s like a waiting room
for our souls 
okay  so you think skylar
is reaching out to you
from this waiting room 
they were color photos  shannon 
i don t    i don t shoot in color 
i don t even own
the chemicals to develop it 
  but you can t show me the photos 
  no  i told you 
the fixer didn t work 
i don t know why 
but maybe spirits can t be captured
on film or something  i don t know 
all right 
tess  i want to believe
you  i swear 
but messages
from the other side 
i just think he wants
the same thing i want 
to see me one last time so that we can
actually say goodbye to each other 
you loved him 
and he knew that 
what more is there to say 
 teacher 
two minute warning 
please take your seats
and set your phones
to silent mode 
dude  we need
to focus  okay 
you re not even
listening to me 
yes  i am 
i just don t think
this is about color photos or
waiting rooms or the in between 
  then what is it about 
  a girl who won t let go 
just think about it 
okay 
 door close 
 sighs 
 laughs 
sorry 
 ringtone 
 never tear us apart  
cell phone use is prohibited
during the test 
  that we could fly  
 ringtone spreads to all cell
phones  overlapping 
 students murmuring 
  that we could fly     
   cause we all have wings  
  but some of us
don t know why  
  i was standing
you were there  
  two worlds collided  
  and they could never
ever tear us apart  
didn t i tell you
the drive would be worth it 
this negative s made of glass 
it s coated in collodion 
then dipped in silver
nitrate  which is crazy 
because after that  you only ave
a few minutes to take the photo
or the chemicals
completely dry up 
hmm  that s exactly
what i was gonna say 
it s only ten grand 
it s a little
out of my budget 
but i can offer you
a gluten free cracker
  with rotting cheese on it 
  you re so generous  it s crazy 
sorry  am i interrupting 
no  julian  hi 
  we were just talking about how much we love the photo 
  oh  yeah 
it s wonderful  isn t it 
i just love how
he prioritizes
mood and atmosphere
over subject 
that is a very sophisticated
insight for a girl your age 
julian  meet my very
sophisticated girlfriend 
hi  i m tessa 
nice to meet you 
  congratulations on this  this is great 
  oh  thank you 
okay  kids  follow me 
i wanna show you something 
doesn t it look amazing
all lit up like this 
  like it belongs here 
  it does belong here 
tessa  you have
an extraordinary eye 
i don t understand 
it s for sale
for  1 000 
yeah  and we already have
two serious inquiries 
   heartbeat thumping 
  uh  this photo
is not for sale 
this was a gift to skylar 
can t you print
another one 
i really just don t want
anyone looking at it 
can we please take it down 
are you serious 
  take it down 
  hey  it s okay  i ll take it down 
thank you 
 heartbeat continues 
   no audible dialogue 
   train whistle blows 
that s exactly why
i brought you here 
to prove that your photos are
great  even julian thinks so 
i don t want this photo
hanging on the wall
of some random stranger 
this is my photo 
that means i get to decide
who i share it with
and i shared it with you 
you re right 
i m sorry  i should have
asked you first 
i just wanted you to see
how amazing you are 
and that you can
get into risd 
who said anything
about risd 
shannon said your art teacher
thought you could get in 
  i m gonna kill her 
  it is the best art college in the country 
and it s in providence 
which is in the same city as brown 
which if you get in 
we could be together 
  i   
  for real  without a ticking clock 
even if i could
get into risd 
which i totally doubt 
  i cannot afford that 
  you re going to get into risd 
  no 
  and you could just get a scholarship 
skylar  jesus 
just give it up 
this is   
you can t fix everything 
what 
your parents  marriage
and me 
some things are
just beyond repair 
is that why you
won t say you love me 
because you re   
beyond repair 
okay 
that s   
   machinery rattling 
   chattering on screen 
 phone chimes 
   knocking on door 
   pop music playing on stereo 
 footsteps approaching 
hey  8 00  i m here
like you asked  what s up 
i would like to take
your portrait 
  uh    can i change first 
  no  you don t have to  you can just put that on 
what s that 
it was my mom s 
this really brings me
back to college 
i had a boyfriend who was an art major 
made me pose for him 
so    mel isn t the first person
that you ve been in love with 
gosh  no 
i ve loved a few men 
maybe even one woman 
did you love any of them
more than they loved you 
oh  probably 
didn t that scare you 
knowing that someone could you hurt
you more than you could hurt them 
yeah  maybe at first 
but then i think i realized if you
protect yourself from the lows 
you just end up missing
all the highs too 
you love skylar  don t you 
i think i m screwing it up 
yeah  if it s not opening old
wounds  it s probably not true love 
i just don t
know what to do 
how do i get skylar
to understand that   
i love him   chuckles 
you start by saying it 
you need to hear
the words  tessa 
you mean  he needs
to hear the words 
no  you need to hear
yourself say them 
out loud 
so the world knows
your feelings count 
that you count 
vickie  i m sorry 
for how i ve treated you 
hey google  dim the lights 
  yes 
  oh  man  no smoke machine 
shh 
we begin this invocation
by asking the
archangel michael
to protect us against
any malevolent spirits
  that may be seeking a gateway into this earthbound sphere 
  you wrote this 
  you re interrupting my invocation 
  i m sorry 
it s just    this is crazy 
did you read all of
these books in two days 
bitch  yes  you know speed
reading is my super power 
enjoy your own funeral 
yeah  that happens
to be a classic
of the paranormal
metaphysical genre 
  now hush 
  okay 
 pop music playing 
we seek to communicate
only with the disembodies spirit
formerly known as skylar adams 
no other spirits  please 
okay 
  a ouija board 
  please  tess  this is a planchette 
there s a pencil tip
attached to the bottom 
we ask questions and skylar
communicates by moving our hands 
just like he did in the gym 
here  fingers right there 
okay 
close your eyes 
   gasps  oh  my god  it moved 
  sorry that was me  my bad 
it s called scrying 
the deceased use the mirror
as a gateway to the world
of the living 
all you have to do is stare into
the mirror in a trance like state 
  that s it 
  okay 
yeah  i m sorry 
can we cover up gambino and drake 
they re like really
distracting me 
instrumental
trans communication 
the spirit uses the tv monitor
as a bridge to our world

you know 
i love coming out here at night
to watch the shooting stars 
my angels are
calling me home 
skylar knows
the end is near 
you don t have much time 
he s been communicating
with you 
well  i m much closer
to his world than you are 
 chuckles 
what does he want 
my help 
to bring
the two of you together 
can you 
please 
in ancient folklore 
the souls of the departed
returned to places where they experienced
their greatest moments of love 
that s where they were able to
cross the life death barrier 
now  perhaps if
you and skylar went back
to where you felt
the most love 
the window between worlds
might open 
okay 
but be careful 
if you do manage
to cross the barrier   
there may be no way back

  all right  bye 
see you later 
ever since i was
a little girl 
people always told me that i see
things that no one else does 
it wasn t just that my camera was
a way for me to express myself 
it was the means by which
i captured the unseen 
it was only recently that i discovered
something that i had been blind to 
a ghost 
all of us 
each and every one of us 
are haunted by ghosts 
the ghosts of
childhood trauma 
the ghosts of
unfulfilled dreams 
the ghosts of lost love 
like so many people 
i believed that 
if i just ignored
these ghosts 
they would
eventually go away 
this turned out
to be a mistake 
just like all of
our worst fears 
these invisible spirits
gain strength in darkness 
if we run from them 
they run faster 
if we push them away 
they just push back harder 
what are we supposed to do 
it has taken   
great personal loss
for me to discover the
answer to this question 
we must attend
to our ghosts 
we must welcome them
into our lives
as though they are part of us 
because they are part of us 
it s only when we acknowledge their presence
will they make room for new possibilities 
in the end  i ve learned that our
ghosts are part of who we are 
part of who we hope to be 
these hauntings
stay inside us 
tethered to our
hearts forever 
in life 
in death 
and    everywhere
in between 
  in between
the day and the night  
  in between
the dark and the light  
  in between what s
wrong and what s right  
  i ll find you  
  i m not really sure
i just work here  
  my heart is broken
and i m scared  
  walls are coming down  
  my defense is
on the ground  
  i m falling  
  in between
the day and the night  
  in between
the dark and the light  
  in between what s
wrong and what s right  
  i ll find you  
  i don t want to lose you
can t stand the pain  
  i wanna feel the sun
not always feel the rain  
  walls are coming down  
  my defense is
on the ground  
  i m falling  
  in between
the day and the night  
  in between
the dark and the light  
  in between what s
wrong and what s right  
  i ll find you  
  i ll find you  
  i ll find you  
  forever beside you  
  beside you  
  i ll find you
