youd break her lens

its been a year
signing a piece of paper doesnt make us her parents
actually it does
i want to be free
remember how
we used to be
sit at home and dream
stare at each other
like tv
shutter clicks
teenage headache dreams
come back to me at night
and try as though i might
to live for now
teenage headache dreams
seems like
the good times over
but nothings really
over anymore
just take control
i want to be free
romanticize reality
reminds me what it means
to be me
teenage headache dreams
ill give up
on the fight
to try as though id like
to leave the moment
i dont know how
teenage headache dreams
up all night
oh back again

instrumental music
playing on screen
people shouting
alarm ringing
zorg speaking french
sherman where are
the subtitles
you watch ill translate
speaking french
its the first time
weve met in daylight
speaking french
but youre very early
i think im just gonna go
tell the theater owner
i mean theres nothing he can do about it
they obviously sent him the wrong print
i can get my money back
ive seen this film before
i dont think you want to miss it
does it have a happy ending
no definitely not
okay then ill say
speaking french
you gonna eat
all that chili by yourself

continues translating
indistinct
im sorry
how long was i doing that
i lost feeling
about an hour ago
so im not sure
why didnt you say something
um the movie is
a bit of a downer so
its a love story
sniffles
i mean
not all love stories are downers
all the good ones are
romeo and juliet
anna karenina
the english patient
mmhmm
i think its the ending
of a relationship
thats what makes
a love story so memorable
what about
pride and prejudice
jane eyre
those both have happy endings
thats only because the writer chose
to end their love stories prematurely
wow that is
a really interesting way
of not admitting
youre wrong
laughing
come on okay picture this
picture that leonardo dicaprio
didnt die at the end of titanic
do i have to oof
you have to
jack dawson is a jobless
penniless gambler
who possessed at best
marginal artistic talent
he saved roses life
right of course
but he also lovebombed her and
stole her away from her fianc√©
and poor rose was just so
hypnotized by that steamy car sex
that she really thought that hed give
her a life of passionate adventure
please come on thats a life of abject
poverty and dehumanizing infidelity
titanic 2 if you thought
part one was a disaster
oh my gosh
clears throat
i
sherman time to go
jesus this guy is getting
a onestar review for sure
so um how did you get
so good at speaking french
my dad is a foreign
languages professor
so by the time i was 12 he had me
fluent in french spanish and italian
oh oh my gosh
if i could just read dantes
inferno in the original italian
my life would be complete i think
i get that a lot
really
no no ive never gotten that before
thats some pretty old gear you got there
you dont shoot digital
no i dont i get a much
higher dynamic range on film
plus im also kind of addicted to
the smell of the developing chemicals
the fumes make me a little delirious
laughs

both chuckle

okay
the other day
she offered to read my aura
i politely declined
what is that
your belongings from the crash
they closed
the accident report already
well neither driver had drugs
or alcohol in their system
thats usually
the end of it
they never even
interviewed me
you said you didnt remember
anything about the accident
i dont
maybe thats for the best
dr sarkisian
im very encouraged tessa
the scan shows
your right ventricle
is functioning quite well
despite the tear
finally some good news
it is more than good
ninetynine out of 100 with this
same injury die on my table
i did die
only for a short time
i could see skylar
like he was in this
this crazy white light
what is that
was she you know hallucinating
when the body undergoes
severe trauma
heartbeat thumping
the hypothalamus can flood the brain
with pain relieving endorphins
vickie so when can we take her home
dr sarkisian end of the week tessa needs
to be extremely careful these next few months
any chest pains
or shortness of breath

oh

thank you
are your hands injured
excuse me
from the accident
did you hurt your hands at all
no why
tada huh
oh come on come on
chuckles
so what is your book about
its about adcs
after death communication
okay so you believe that
dead people can contact us
along with billions
of other people
from faiths
that span the globe
sometimes the departed
they call out
to us in voice
and other times we can smell their
cologne or perfume in the air
no matter how they communicate
the message is the same
im still here
and your grief
like a beacon
calls me to your side
and when the separation
has been traumatic
like with you
and your boyfriend
theres often
unfinished business
like regrets or something
like things left undone
or unsaid
door opens
vickie tessa
we signed you out
its time to go
hes in the inbetween
but he wont be there for
long a few weeks at most

artificiality of modern life
school bell rings

well maybe its time for
your subject matter to evolve

notably missing from all your photos

part about taking photos
its like you just stumble and
wander and find places like this
right but what
what drew you to this spot specifically
the view
that view
seagulls squawking
it was called
the empyrean
it was a honeymooners
resort back in the 60s
its so surreal
its unbelievable
youve gone in there
unarmed
ill do anything
for a great photo
empyrean
thats where dante
meets god right
highest of all heavens
a place of pure love
look at it if thats not a metaphor
for love then i dont know what is

of the empyrean
yeah show it to me
i wanna see it you know
through your eyes
never tear us apart
playing
both laughing
we could live
for a thousand years
but if i hurt you
id make wine
tennis ball thwacking
both grunting
from your tears
i told you
that we could fly
cause we all have wings
but some of us
dont know why
i was standing
you were there
two worlds collided
and they could never
ever tear us apart
piano keys playing
do you know how to waltz
no
okay just step back this way
okay
and then your back foot forward
and then its like one two three
straighten your leg
one two three
okay
and then you have to put
your chin up and then lead
like you dont want to pay any
attention to the other person
dont slip
both laughing
you dont ask me
you were standing
you know its true
i was there
worlds collided
two worlds collided
were shining through
and they could never
tear us apart
i
i was standing
do you want to see what its
like to be inside of a camera

it works just like
a camera lens
i kind of made it myself

what
her family took her home this morning
there was nothing more we could do
are you okay honey
um i just havent
i havent eaten today
um
you know what let me check you out
why do you need to talk to doris so bad
its just
its about what she was telling me before
its about the afterlife
maybe that old coot
isnt so crazy after all
what do you mean
your heartbeat is fast but it sounds healthy
wait what do you what were you saying
what do you mean
doris told me youd
come looking for her
she even left you something
her book
tessa i have seen a lot of dying
and grieving in my time here
looking back
never helped anyone
theres either life
or theres death
theres no place inbetween
im gonna find him
doris on video what does
the inbetween look like
well we as living beings can never
imagine it we have no reference
it would be like trying to
describe a sunset to a blind man
technological advances have made
ghosthunting a legitimate field
my friend darlene she let me borrow
her fullspectrum digital camera
this baby can pick up light
well beyond the human eye
with infrared night vision
shannon and tessa laughing
thunder rumbling
well happy fourth of july
i dont know i actually kind of like this weather
dont call me
so you think this means
the fireworks are canceled
i think so yeah
yeah
hey
hey
you okay
yeah
skylar tess says
youre going to brown
congrats
thank you
what are you gonna study
probably latin
thatll come in handy
you never know when youre gonna
meet the pope or something
or need to conduct
an exorcism
nice thats nice
i dont know i just dont want
to have any regrets you know
i wanna live a bunch
of different lives
whats the point of speaking
all these languages
if im not gonna travel the
world and use them you know
lets go we are going to
watch the fireworks on tv
are your parents home
do you want
to talk about it
not really
okay
my mom filed
for divorce today
im really sorry
you know i know this doesnt
help right now but
just because
theyre splitting up
that doesnt mean that they
dont care about each other
it means theyve given up
i dont think thats fair
fair to who you or them
sighs when youre rowing a race
and you get to the last 20 meters
your entire body
is telling you to stop
your muscles are on fire
your lungs are screaming at you
everything inside you wants to
quit make the pain go away
but if you want to win
thats exactly when you dig
deeper and you row harder
you really dont like
to let things go do you
you noticed
laughs
fireworks boom
whistling booming
sighs
youre just starting to make
me believe in happy endings
oh no the photo no
oh oh
what
its totally ruined its totally ruined
now you see why i dont
let anyone up here
i am pretty amazed that youve
let me into your inner sanctum
yeah well
if you tell anyone
ill poison you
oh you dont have to
hmm
you dont have to look through that
no no no okay
yeah
its cool
i like this one
thats um
thats a cell phone tower
yeah
its an allegory
for something technology
coopting our natural environment
really
really
i know you hate compliments
but this work is incredible
im serious its like you can
see things that no one else can
that just shows how much
you know about photography
laughs
i mean i think
you can sell this stuff
maybe on etsy
there is something
thats missing
from like all
of your photos
yeah i know
its color
no you
i just dont really think the
world needs another selfie
oh come on what is wrong with stepping in
front of the camera every once in awhile
i believe that a photographer
should point her lens outward
toward the world
yeah
yeah so you can try
and understand it
what about trying
to understand yourself
if you had my past
you wouldnt ask that question
you ever gonna
tell me about it
chuckles
sighs
come on
ill walk you home
i never met my real father
he ran off before i was born
and my mom
the kind way to describe her
would be flaky
wow
instead of counting sheep
to go to sleep
when i was a kid
i would count her fianc√©s
and mel was
one of them
yeah he was
the last one
her final victim before
she ghosted us for good
and thats when
he took you in
well he tried
but the court
they just didnt really look too
kindly on a middleaged bachelor
wanting to adopt
a young girl
so then where did you go
ah family services
foster care
oh
you know how you said
that i notice things
that no one else does
mmhmm
when you live with strangers
who can hurt you
and i bounced around a lot
you have to really just
observe everything
when youre a foster kid
you learn the hard way to
never put your guard down
yeah
anyway about a year ago
mel and vickie got married
and then the court
let them take me in
so thats why you call
yourself a genetic stranger
buzzing clicking
i did that
scoffs
one day playing
sister dont mind
that im not on time
she knows that
im through with that
sick of trying
true and kind
call me aside
and i will now be
and i will be
fine with that
vickie good god
how early is it
super early
a little splash
of almond milk right
uh yeah
i like your necklace
yeah shannon
lent it to me
you know if you ever want to borrow anything
from me clothes or makeup jewelry
all righty
ill see you later vick
oh one day

okay so you think skylar
is reaching out to you
from this waiting room
they were color photos shannon
i dont i dont shoot in color
i dont even own
the chemicals to develop it
but you cant show me the photos
no i told you
the fixer didnt work
i dont know why
but maybe spirits cant be captured
on film or something i dont know
all right
tess i want to believe
you i swear
but messages
from the other side
i just think he wants
the same thing i want
to see me one last time so that we can
actually say goodbye to each other
you loved him
and he knew that
what more is there to say
teacher
twominute warning
please take your seats
and set your phones
to silent mode
dude we need
to focus okay
youre not even
listening to me
yes i am
i just dont think
this is about color photos or
waiting rooms or the inbetween
then what is it about
a girl who wont let go
just think about it
okay
door close
sighs
laughs
sorry
ringtone
never tear us apart
cell phone use is prohibited
during the test
that we could fly
ringtone spreads to all cell
phones overlapping
students murmuring
that we could fly
cause we all have wings
but some of us
dont know why
i was standing
you were there
two worlds collided
and they could never
ever tear us apart
didnt i tell you
the drive would be worth it
this negatives made of glass
its coated in collodion
then dipped in silver
nitrate which is crazy
because after that you only ave
a few minutes to take the photo
or the chemicals
completely dry up
hmm thats exactly
what i was gonna say
its only ten grand
its a little
out of my budget
but i can offer you
a glutenfree cracker
with rotting cheese on it
youre so generous its crazy
sorry am i interrupting
no julian hi
we were just talking about how much we love the photo
oh yeah
its wonderful isnt it
i just love how
he prioritizes
mood and atmosphere
over subject
that is a very sophisticated
insight for a girl your age
julian meet my very
sophisticated girlfriend
hi im tessa
nice to meet you
congratulations on this this is great
oh thank you
okay kids follow me
i wanna show you something

i really just dont want
anyone looking at it

heartbeat continues
no audible dialogue
train whistle blows
thats exactly why
i brought you here
to prove that your photos are
great even julian thinks so
i dont want this photo
hanging on the wall
of some random stranger
this is my photo
that means i get to decide
who i share it with
and i shared it with you
youre right
im sorry i should have
asked you first
i just wanted you to see
how amazing you are
and that you can
get into risd
who said anything
about risd
shannon said your art teacher
thought you could get in
im gonna kill her
it is the best art college in the country
and its in providence
which is in the same city as brown
which if you get in
we could be together
i
for real without a ticking clock
even if i could
get into risd
which i totally doubt
i cannot afford that
youre going to get into risd
no
and you could just get a scholarship
skylar jesus
just give it up
this is
you cant fix everything
what
your parents marriage
and me
some things are
just beyond repair
is that why you
wont say you love me
because youre
beyond repair
okay
thats
machinery rattling
chattering on screen
phone chimes
knocking on door
pop music playing on stereo
footsteps approaching

it was my moms
this really brings me
back to college
i had a boyfriend who was an art major
made me pose for him
so mel isnt the first person
that youve been in love with
gosh no
ive loved a few men
maybe even one woman
did you love any of them
more than they loved you
oh probably
didnt that scare you
knowing that someone could you hurt
you more than you could hurt them
yeah maybe at first
but then i think i realized if you
protect yourself from the lows
you just end up missing
all the highs too
you love skylar dont you
i think im screwing it up
yeah if its not opening old
wounds its probably not true love
i just dont
know what to do
how do i get skylar
to understand that
i love him chuckles
you start by saying it
you need to hear
the words tessa
you mean he needs
to hear the words
no you need to hear
yourself say them
out loud
so the world knows
your feelings count
that you count
vickie im sorry
for how ive treated you
hey google dim the lights
yes
oh man no smoke machine
shh
we begin this invocation
by asking the
archangel michael
to protect us against
any malevolent spirits
that may be seeking a gateway into this earthbound sphere
you wrote this
youre interrupting my invocation
im sorry

did you read all of
these books in two days
bitch yes you know speed
reading is my super power
enjoy your own funeral

to be a classic
of the paranormal
metaphysical genre

only with the disembodies spirit
formerly known as skylar adams
no other spirits please
okay
a ouija board

communicates by moving our hands
just like he did in the gym
here fingers right there

the deceased use the mirror
as a gateway to the world
of the living

with you

chuckles

my help
to bring
the two of you together
can you
please
in ancient folklore
the souls of the departed
returned to places where they experienced
their greatest moments of love
thats where they were able to
cross the lifedeath barrier
now perhaps if
you and skylar went back
to where you felt
the most love
the window between worlds
might open
okay
but be careful
if you do manage
to cross the barrier
there may be no way back

speaking french
doctors nurses chattering

the best day of my life

hurt that i feel right now
i dont regret a thing

of feeling this way
makes life worth living
i dont want

a happy ending yeah
hey
no more dying okay
chuckles
oh my god
it smells so good
sit down theres plenty
i cant i gotta go
good luck tessa
love you
go get em
all right bye
see you later
ever since i was
a little girl
people always told me that i see
things that no one else does
it wasnt just that my camera was
a way for me to express myself
it was the means by which
i captured the unseen
it was only recently that i discovered
something that i had been blind to
a ghost
all of us
each and every one of us
are haunted by ghosts
the ghosts of
childhood trauma
the ghosts of
unfulfilled dreams
the ghosts of lost love
like so many people
i believed that
if i just ignored
these ghosts
they would
eventually go away
this turned out
to be a mistake
just like all of
our worst fears
these invisible spirits
gain strength in darkness
if we run from them
they run faster
if we push them away
they just push back harder
what are we supposed to do
it has taken
great personal loss
for me to discover the
answer to this question
we must attend
to our ghosts
we must welcome them
into our lives
as though they are part of us
because they are part of us
its only when we acknowledge their presence
will they make room for new possibilities
in the end ive learned that our
ghosts are part of who we are
part of who we hope to be
these hauntings
stay inside us
tethered to our
hearts forever
in life
in death
and everywhere
inbetween
in between
the day and the night
in between
the dark and the light
in between whats
wrong and whats right
ill find you
im not really sure
i just work here
my heart is broken
and im scared
walls are coming down
my defense is
on the ground
im falling
in between
the day and the night
in between
the dark and the light
in between whats
wrong and whats right
ill find you
i dont want to lose you
cant stand the pain
i wanna feel the sun
not always feel the rain
walls are coming down
my defense is
on the ground
im falling
in between
the day and the night
in between
the dark and the light
in between whats
wrong and whats right
ill find you
ill find you
ill find you
forever beside you
beside you
ill find you
